EfiKTON, DEI'EMUEK 10, 1887.
s
The Republican National Committee
met on Thursday in Washington, and
selected Chicago as the place, and
June 19th, 1888, as the time for the
meeting of the next Republican Natio
nal Convention.
The doctrine of State sovereignty,
only one phase of which was involved
in or settled by the war, comes in very
handy now to sustain the prohibition
law of Kansas. The Supreme Court
of the United States declares that the
prohibition law of that State is not un
constitutional, though it makes no provi
sion for compensation to brewers whose
business is broken up. The State has
a right to regulate its internal concerns
and to abate what its constituted
authorities declare to be a nuisance.
Referring to the license of speech
allowed Anarchists in this county, one
of our exchanges very truthfully says
that a man who sets up as a revolu
tionist in his native country, can plead
that he did not choose the place of his
birth, and that he has no choice but to
revolt against oppression that has
become intolerable. But a man who
deliberately adopts a country of which
he is not a native, applies for citizen
ship in it, and makes use of his citizen
ship to disturb the peace and attack
the institutions oi the nation that has
received and naturalized him, is a wan
ton and a pestilent scoundrel for whom
there is no excuse to be made. The
Americans are a very patient people,
but the limit of their toleration for for
eign mischief-makers is very nearly
reached.
The Supreme Court of the United
States has decided in the notorious
Virginia coupon cases that the State
cannot be proceeded against without its
own consent for refusing to honor its
own obligations in payment of taxes.
In view of this apparent evasion of the
Stale’s financial responsibilities, what is
to prevent any other State from nego
tialing loans and issuing coupons, and
then when the State obligations mature,
repudiate them by refusing its con
sent to honor its own indebtedness
incurred in good faith, and so recog
nized by tne holders of its obligations ?
It would seem that the whole matter of
State credit would rest in the hands of
a few State officials, who it they hap
pened to be unscrupulous men, could
plead as a precedent for repudiation of
honest Stale obligations the precedent
just set in the Virginia cases. To laymen
it looks like a dangerous decision.
The organized industries of the
United States are already on the war
path in protest against President Cleve
land's free trade theories as contained
in his message. “The wool-dealers
v and wool-growers of the United States,
representing a capita! of over five hun
dred millions of dollars and a consti
tuency of a million wool-growers and
wool-dealers, assembled in conference
in the city of Washington this 7th day
of December, 1887, having read the
first annual message of the President
to the Fiftieth Congress declare that
the sentiments of the message are a
direct attack upon their industry, one
of the most important of the country,
and in positive violation of the natio
nal Democratic platform of 1884, as
interpreted by the party leaders, and
accepted by the rank and file of the
party ; that the argument made by the
President for the removal of our pro
tection against foreign competition is
the old one, repeatedly made hy the
enemies of our industrial progress, and
effectively answered in nearly every
school district of our land, and so thor
oughly disproved by the logic of facts
and the demonstrations of experience
and history as to need no answer
from us.”
Thai conservative journal the Phila
delphia Ledger is very outspoken in
its opposition to President Cleveland’s
plan of reducing the surplus in the
Treasury, by attacking the tariff on im
ports, instead of abolishing the system
of internal revenue taxation, which is
essentially a war system and not needed
in times of peace. “It is almost in
conceivable,” it savs, “that a man of
the usual solid sense and general good
judgment of Mr. Cleveland could have
written in such a strain in a State paper
that is to take permanent place among
the archives oi the country ; yet there
in the message are the extravagant
statements and the forced phrases just
quoted, which express his two theses.
To quote them is to give the keynote
of the argument brought forward to
sustain them. The readers of the
Ledger will hardly expect this journal
to go into detailed discussion of state
ments coucned in such terms. They
know that the country was not last
summer, and is not now, in a situation
“presaging financial convulsion and
widespread disasterand they know
jhat there arc more ways than one of
preventing any dangerous accumula
tion or excess of money in the Federal
IT asury. They are aware that last
summer there were men diligently at
work trying to get up a panic for the
purpose of procuring the intervention
of the officers of the Federal Govern
ment, but sagacious, solid, experienced
men in financial affairs felt no sucli
“alarm” at that time and do not now.
They are aware also that if Congress
iiad done its duty in the way of pro
viding for what Samuel J. Tildcn graph
ically and truly described as the “de
fenceless condition of our coasts if
it had provided establishments for man
ufacturing tiie armor plates and the
heavy ordnance the country needs for
its own protection ; if it had devoted
sufficient money to pul upon the sea a
fleet of thirty to fifty swift cruisers that
would have made tne American navy
respected, instead of a shame and re
proach ; if they had in a word done the
things for the common defense ami
general welfare that have already been
postponed far too long, there would
have been much less of a “surplus’ ’ to
be used as a makeshift for an assault
upon the manufacturing industries of
the country. They are some of the
things which the people of the country
do know, and they are to be placed as
offset to the things they do not know,
although they see such alarming .c
--counts of them set forth in the mes
sage. And they likewise know that if
the leaders of that school of economists
into whose ranks the President seems
to have rushed headlong really believed
that the surplus was “fraught with
danger” and “peril to the country,”
“presaging financial convulsion and
widespread disaster,” they would not
put off relief from session to session
and from year to year, obstinately in
sisting that the one only way to stop
the surplus and avert such dangers,
perils, convulsions and disasters is to
revise “the vicious, inequitable and
illogical tariffbut they would seize
instantly upon the plainest, straightest,
surest means and abolish the internal
taxes, which never before were con
tinued in time of peace. What sort of
patriot would he be —what sort of ad
viser is the President, who, seeing the
country in imminent danger of “finan
cial convulsion” and “widespread dis
aster"—halls for months and years to
consider whether that ruin which could
be instantly and certainly prevented by
taking off the internal taxes shall be
precipitated upon the country unicss
Congress agrees to reduce the duties
on sugar, iron, cotton and woollen
goods ? Certainly Mr. Cleveland could
never have contemplated putting the
President of the United States in a
corner like that 1 Who can escape the
belief that that frantic cry about “fi
nancial convulsions’’ presaging “wide
spread disaster,” which has been given
to the President by the tariff revisers
is an unmitigated sham? They don't
believe it; tney can’t believe it; or the
internal taxes wouldn't rest another
day without a bill to abolish them being
put on swift passage through the House
of Representatives. Mr. Carlisle’s ad
herents are patriotic enough at least
for that. They have deluded and en
trapped the President and put him, as
well as themselves, in a most absurd
position.”
Although President Cleveland’s first
message to the Fiftieth Congress is a
short one, yet the effect of it will be to
stir the country from the centre to the
circumference, simply because it cannot
be interpreted as any thing short of an
indirect assault upon the manufacturing
industries of the country. It is a
noticeable document in many respects,
its plain, unpretentious, and outspoken
language being its not least conspicuous
feature. It undoubtedly will be the
subject of very pronounced attack, sim
ply because it can be fairly accepted as
an authoritative declaration of the atti
tude of the Democratic party upon the
subject of protection, and foreshadows
the political platform of ISSB, on which
Mr. Cleveland hopes to secure a re
election to the Presidency. However
justly the party to which Mr. Cleveland
belongs may be accused of dodging the
free trade issue, he at least cannot be
charged with duplicity on this import
ant issue, since his outspoken advocacy
of a tariff for revenue only places his
party where it properly and consistently
belongs—on a free trade platform. We
do not see that Republicans have any
just cause to complain of the President’s
honesty and frankness in fixing the
position ol his party in the next presi
dential campaign. He has simply
recognized the eternal fitness of things
in placing himself upon the platform
most acceptable to the greatest number
of those who constitute the party by
which he expects to be renominated for
the Presidency, and in doing so has
simply defined the issue between them
and the Republicans. As Republicans,
we believe that a truly protective policy
is the necessary condition for the pros
perity and welfare of this country : not
merely for its manufacturing classes
but as well for the farmer, the merchant,
and every industrial class. While
Republicans as a general rule believe
in the doctrine of protection of Ameri
can industries, their Democratic oppo
nents have almost as unanimously held
free trade theories and ideas. The
President’s message will precipitate the
issue, and it may he reasonably assumed
that it will he warmly discussed in 1888.
We very readily recall how in the Prcsi
dential contest of 1880 the State of
Indiana was saved to the Republicans
by the precipitation of the issue of pro
tection in that Stale and that, too, late
in the campaign of that year. In fact,
up to August, 1880, the drift of public |
sentiment was decidedly in favor of
General Hancock, the Democratic j
nominee for the Presidency. Our read- j
ers will remember that in the Rcpubli- !
can National Convention of that year, ■
held at Chicago, there had been a warm \
contest between the friends of General 1
Grant and Mr. Blaine for the presiden- ,
tial nomination, and that the candidacy ;
of General Garfield was altogether unex- 1
peeled, and was the result of a com- ;
promise between the friends and adher !
ents of the two more prominent candi 1
dates. Like all other compromise I
nominations, Gen. Garfield’s was at the
moment a disappointment to both sides j
and did not excite the popular enthusi. 1
THE CECIL WHIG, ETHITOTT. DECEMBER 10, ISS7.
asm that the nomination of either of the
other candidates would have excited.
Phis apparently apathetic condition of
the Republicans very naturally excited
the hopes of the 1 iemocrats, only to
disappoint them. All thiough the
months of June, July and August, so
far as the general drift of public send
ment indicated it, the probabilities
seemed to favor General Hancock’s
election. But Indiana held a State
election in October, and was a doubt
ful State. Both sides looked for victory
there as a forerunner of success in
November following. Knowing that
the manufacturing industries of that
State were growing into importance,
the Republicans wisely made the pro
tection of American industries their
campaign issue with the local free
trade doctrinaires, and won the State.
It is a matter of history that that result
turned back the current of opinion
which had been running so steadily
towards General Hancock’s election,
and which his own subsequent unfortu
nate utterances on that question so
quickly changed to defeat.
We refer to this little bit of history
simply to signify our behel that the
issue now precipitated by President
Cleveland, and whose position is sub
stantially that held by the Democrats
of Indiana in 1880, can be as success
fully met by the friends ol American
industries in 18SS, as it was in Indiana
seven years ago. As a campaign! doc
ument for free traders next year the
President’s message is undoubtedly
admirable, but we doubt indeed whether
it will be acceptable even in the South,
where manufacturing and industrial
interests have recently been making
rapid strides forward.
Mr. Blaine on tlie Message.
As President Cleveland in nis mes
sage sounds the Democratic key note
of the campaign of i.sSS, so Mr. Blaine
in his timely comment on it, voices sub
stantially the opinions of the great body
of Republicans on an important ques
tion of governmental policy.
Mr. Blaine’s views will be received
by the country with profound attention,
not only because they are those of the
most popular American statesman, but
because they are thoroughly American.
He calls particular attention to the
gratification entertained in England, at
the prospect of our system of protec
tion of American industries being broken
down for the benefit of British manu
facturers, and which prospect the Piesi
dent’s message encourages. Mr.
Blaine’s opinions as to the disposition
of the treasuiy surplus are wise and
statesmanlike.
He would abolish the internal revenue
tax on tobacco and make that commo
dity free along with corn and wheat.
The whisky tax he would apply to the
building of fortifications on our sea
coast, and in this connection he ford
bly refers to the absolutely defenseless
condition of every harbor on the shores
of the Atlantic and Pacific. He opposes
the removal of the tax on whisKy
because “there is a racial side to it.”
With whisky reduced to twenty cents a
gallon he rightly concludes that there
would be an enormous increase in the
consumption, and a proportionate in
crease of crime, immorality and
poverty.
In discussing the subject of trade
Mr. Blaine alludes to the foreign treat
ises upon political economy as being
totally inapplicable to the United States,
a tact which the free trade and low
tariff theorists on this side of the water
have apparently never realized. He
points out that our present unprece
dented prosperity is due, firstly, to our
protection from foreign competition,
ar secondly, to the free trade that
exists between our thirty eight states
and our territories, with their sixty mil
lions of people.
In the short space of a newspaper
interview Mr. Blaine could do no more
than outline his views as to the effect
which the adoption of those of Mr.
Cleveland would have upon the country,
but he has performed his task well. He
shows conclusively that the United
Stales is not y, t ready to abandon that
system of protection which has made
this nation the most prosperous on
earth.

H 4vlies, the Maine member of the Nation
a! Kt publican Committee, waKattbe Fifth
Avenue Hotel today. He says he is in
favor of holding the convention in the
Fast, preferabp in New York. ‘There i
is a feeling, however,” ne said, ‘’among
many of Mr. Blaine's friends and sup
porters that perhaps Ids interests will bt
better served if the convention is held in
a certain locality.’*
‘•Do you mean Chicago?” he was asked.
‘‘Well, not far from Chicago.”
He does not think the National Com
mittee will consider the interests of any
candidate in selecting the place for fhi
next convention. It will be governed
entirely by what is best for the party <
‘ I do not think.” he says, “that Mr
Blaine would decline a renomination, hu‘
ho is not in a position to make a light for <
it. I moan he would feel some delicacy
about taking such a course. Mr. Blaine i
made a contest for th** nomination in IbTtl i

would feel highly complimented to receive i
the unanimous nomination of the R■•pub

an expression by the party that our defeat t
in ISS4 was due to other causes and not (
to Mr. Blaine. I think Mr. Blaine will •

Francisco, as has been rumored. Ho has j
sai<l nothing about it to any one that 1
know of. Mr. Blaine may, of course, re- f
turn that way, but, as I said. I think it ■
very doubtful. Mr. Blaine is not a very j

FARMERS’ CONVENTION, j
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS DEBATED.
Action on Taxation of .Mortgages, Tobacco
1 nnpcctioii. Speculation In f.rain—Small
Attendance, but an I merest lux Meeting.
The Maryland Formers* Convention
met Wednesday morning last at Maryland
Hall, Mulberry anti Cathedral streets,
Baltimore. The report of the committee
on taxation, with accompanying bill, sub
mitted at the September meeting, was
adopted.
The attendance was smaller than usual
on such occasions. Among the absentees
was ex-Gov Wm.T. Hamilton, president
of the convention, who telegraphed to
Secretary Sands Irom Hagerstown, eighty
miles away, as follows : ‘‘Too severely
indisposed to leave the house this morn
ing, to inv great regret. Not able to
endure walking W. T. Hamilton.” The
question of taking up a subscription to
pay the president’s railroad I are was not
discussed. The subject of equitable tax
ition took up the greater part ol tlie in
formal discussion before the meeting was
called to order. One farmer reinarl ed
that in view id tin early meeting of the
Legislature he wis in favor of ‘‘doing
something towards taxing everybody ex
cept farmers.”
WHO WERE THERE.
Among those present were the follow
nig gentlemen, well known in Baltimore
and in their resp.-ct.we counties: Henry
0. Hollowed, Alien Bowie Divis, E. C.
Gilpin, Arthur S-abler, W. E. Mamkee
and L. H. Duvall, of Montgomery c unity;
ex Senator E M Allen, John Moores,
A. M Fulford, Beiij. Silver, Jr., J. P.
Silver, Garrett Amos and C. C. Kinsey,
of Harford; H. S. C udou. E. Noyes, Dr.
R. C. Mac kali and G W. Crnikshank, of
Cecil; (’. T. Cockey, Samuel M Price,
E. S. Choate. C. Lyon Rogers, L II
Painter, E. P. Paret, Fred'k von K *-pfi,
Win. Fell Johnson and S C Hurd, of
Baltimore county; Dr. W W. Waring, of
Prince George’s; John G. Chapman, ol
Charles; James T. Clarke and H. ()
Devries, of Howard: David Do Id, ol
Queen Anne’s; Gen. E L F. Hardcastle
and Dr. I L. Adkins, ol Talbot; T. Alex.
Seth, of the Maryland Agricultural and.
Mechanical Association.
SELECTING A CHAIRMAN.
The hour set for the convention to as
seinhle was 11 o’clock in the morning, but
as the delegates in attendance at that
hour were few in number the time was
passed over, and the farmers kept drop
ping in one or two at a lime until about
halt past 11, when, after a little delay
caused by the question ol seniority, no
body being willing to admit chat he was
Hie eldest, Mr. Henry C. Hallowell, ol
Montgomery county, was called to the
chair. Mr. Hallowell said he could not
bo expected to make an elaborate ad Ires-,
having anticipated the presence of the
great, farmer of Western Maryland. He
regretted that the hall was not full, as
there had never before been a time when
the agricultural interests needed wiser
counsels. Tlie Legislature was about to
meet, and the farmers should assemble
and express their views to aid those mem
hers of the General Assembly who were
always willing to look after the interests
of the farmer. “However,” he eonclud
ed, “we are here, and I trust we may do
no harm and much good.”
BEGINNING BUSINESS.
The first question rai ed was to the
right of the convention to go into elect ion
of officers. The chair ruled that it could
not. The annual meeting iu last January
had provided for a meeting in December
on account ol the probably inclement
weather in January, and this meeting
could only he cousideied as an adjourned
meeting, to dispose of unfinished bust
uess and to propose new business.
THE QUESTION OF TAXATION.
The real business of the meeting, the
report of the committee on taxation, was
then considered. The chairman of the
committee, Senator elect Edward Stake,
of Washington county, was not present.
Secretary Sands read the bill Through
ind it was then taken up section bv sec
tion. Some of those present were op
posed to the main feature, the taxation
of mortgages. They worked hard to
defeat it by motions and counter-motions,
carrying the discussion over tlie recess
and well toward the close of the session,
when 1 he committee’s report vs as adopted
with a slight ammidment affecting the
mortgage taxation question.
LIMITED DEBATE,
Ex-State Senator Allen, of Harford,
said he was glad the bill was the only
work of a committee, for he was satisfied
that its adoption would set the State back
twenty years.
A motion to limit each speech to ten
minutes, and that each member speak
but once on the same subject, was adopt
nd. Mr. Kdw Stabler, of Montgomery,
said that the president had done himself
great credit in appointment of the corn
mittee, and the committee had done well,
i d all the convention could do was to
indorse their action. It would save time,
lie proposed that, the association approve
of the report ol the committee, that the
president appoint a committee of one
from each county to present the matter
to the Legislature, ex-Gov. Hamilton to
represent Washington county, and to he
president of the committee, and that the
Legislature appoint a special commission
to take the whole subject into considera
tion, and recommend such changes iu the
tax lav’s as in their judgment they might
deem best. A motion by T. Alex. Seth
‘o pass these resolutions was opposed by
Dr. M .ckall and others, who wanted the
matter tally discussed. W. E. M.mikee,
if Montgomery, during the discussion
said they wou’d have a much stronger
ease il they did not go before the Legis
lature with a measure that had the ap
pear nice of being railroaded through.
Fhe resolutions wore not. passed, and the
proposed law was read by sections.
TilE TAX St: 11.1 KCT DKHATED.
The proposed bill brought out a diver
ity of opinions. The principle difference
between the committee’s bill and the
present law is that the one under discus
sion provided lor annual list ing of prop
-ity and for exempting property from
■ axa!urn io the extent of the mortgage,
vhicn latter it Was proposed to tax in
the hands ot the holder in this State. A
morion ot L. H Fainter, ot Baltimore
county, who had made objections to sev
eral sections, that, the whole matter be
rabied. was not seconded
L. H. Fainter said the objections were
made to the present law—that of 1870—
not beease it was not a good law. but be
cau*e of subsequent exemptions that hail
been made which had defrauded the far
mars and other honest taxpayers. The
convention wanted to ciiange the exemp
tions that had crept in through the cor
ruption of thv Legislatures, and that the
face of every mortgage should have a
cause saying that it it. were ever taxed
the borrower would pay the tax. It the
law made that provision unlawful people
would find away to avoid it by increas
mg the rare of interest. He advised the
convention to demand the repeal of every
“xempiioii granted since IS7G.
\V. H. Armstrong, ol Washington
countv, when ex Senator Allen at one
rime became rather warm in bis remarks,
called the ('hair’s attention to the fact
that the taxation committee were entitled
to at least, respectful language. Iu dis
cussing the taxation of mortgages Mr.
Armstrong said he was a holder of m irt
gages, bur that did not make it right;
he bad been a slave-holder, but that was ,
not. right, either.
Benj. Sdv.tr, Jr., of Harford county,
called attention to the clause exempting
the propmt) from taxation to tlie extent i
of any mortgage on it held iu the State.
This meant that if u man borrowed
money iu the State on hi-, farm it. was •
exempt to that amount. It also loft a <
loophole for a railroad to escape taxation. <
Chas. T. Cockey, of Balimore county, t
said his county was much interested. '
Millions ot dollars of valuable property ]
in tlie county was held by Baltimore
city, such as water-works and parks, and \
ho hoped for some law that would make
the city pay taxes on it. If graveyards,
operated for revenue, were taxed and did ]
not pay theirtaxes, w hat would the county <
do—buy them or sell them?
Edward Stabler said that two classes j
would always oppose taxation of mort '
gages—the class who borrow and the .
class who lend.
After recess an amendment proposed (
hy Dr. W. W. Waring was adopted, j
changing the reading of the bill so as to
exempt property to the extent of the ,
mortgage, whether the mortgage was ,
held in or out of the State. On motion j
of Mr. Collins, of Talbot, the report and
bill were adopted as a whole. A motion
of Mr Fainter that the Legislature he
urged to repeal all passed
since 1870 was not seconded The Chair i
was empowered to appoint a committee t
of one from each county, with ex Gov (
II .milion as chairman, to urge the com
mittee’s hill on the Legislature.
L S Ferry, of Dorchester, offered a '
resolution, which was adopted, calling *
i— iff I- hi ■in—iirrgin ■ 111 -ammemmsm* mhmi
upon the Senators and Representatives
iu Congress fn>,u Maryland, to urge the
passage of an act that will prohibit the
sales of futures and options, and prov d
ing for a commuter ot live to draft a
bill prohibiting the sales of futures and
| options, to be presented to the next Leg
i islature. Tlie preamble to the resolution
recited the evils of gambling in grain
AGAINST TOBACCO INSPECTION
Dr. Waring moved that the convention
urge the repeal of the compulsory to
bacco inspection laws. He said it there
was a law compelling all Eastern Shore
man to send their fruit to Baltimore to
he inspected before being sent, to market
the people would not stand it a minute.
Even if the withdrawal of the income
Irom compulsory inspections made the
warehouses draw on the State for sup
port, it was no justification for continu
ing the burden on the people of lower
Maryland. The fault, was not with the
Southern Maryland delegates in the Leg
islature, but with others who listened to
the appeals of politic ms who wanted
Mie warehouses continued as political ma
chines.
Dr Mickallsdd that the politicians
wore beginning to realize that they were
the servants and not the masters of the
people. At the last eleccion the vote in
some ot the counties was so close that a
judicious distribution of 1.000 votes could
nave changed the complexion of the
Legislature He, the speaker was an
old time Bourbon Democrat. Dr. Wai
ing’s resolution was adopted.
Attention was called by Mr. Collins to
the fact that, he had introduced a resolu
at a previous meeting on the subject of
the laiitf It had been referred to the
taxation committee He wanted to bear
from it. Tne secretary explained that
the committee ha t not been app >inted
until alter tlie convention bad adjourned,
and the subject had not reached them.
Charles Armstrong, of tlio committee
on patents, reported resolutions, which

ME, BL4INE ON THE MESSAGE,
ttx|Mesloii of Ills Views of Mr. Cleveland’s
Tariff Recommendations.
New Lire, D c. 7 — The 'tribune's
F.nis correspondent cables to that paper
giving the views of Mr. Blaine on the
President’s message. Mr. Blaine spoke
as follows: “I have been reading an ab
stract of the President's message and
have been especially interested in the
comments of the London papers. These
papers all assume to declare the message
is a free trade manifesto and evidently
are anticipating an enlarged market for
English fabrics in the United States as a
consequence of the President’s recom
mend ttions. Perhaps that fact stamped
the character of the message more clearly
than any words of mine can.”
“You don’t mean actual free trade
without duty?’ queried the reporter.
4 ‘N",” replied Mr. Blaine. ‘*Nor do
the London papers mean that. They
simply mean that the President has
recommended what in the United Stales
is known as a revenue tariff, rejecting
the protective feature as an object, and
not even permitting protection to result
freely as an incident to revenue duties.”
“I don’t quite comprehend that last
point,’’ said the reporter.
“I mean,” said Mr. Blaine, ‘‘that for
the first time in the history of the United
States the President recommends retain
ing the internal lax in order that the
tariff may he forced down even below the
fsir revenue standard. He recommends
That the tax on tobacco be retained, and
thus that many millions annually shall
be levied on a domestic product which
would far better come from a tariff on
foreign fabrics.”
Mr B1 tine favors the repeal of the to
bacco tax’ He said; “I should urge
that it be done at once, even before the
Christmas holidays. It would in the first
place bring great relief to groweis of to
banco al! over tha country, and would,
moreover, materially lessen the pt ice of
the article to consumers. Tobacco to
millions of men is a necessity. The Pres
ident calls it a luxury, but it is a iuxuiy
in no other sense than tea or coffee are
luxuries
“I would not advise the repeal of the
whisky tax. Other con* iderations than
those of financial administration are to
he taken into account with regard to
whisky. There is a moral side to it. To
cheapen the price of whisky is to increase
the consumption enormously. It would
destroy high license at once in all the
States. Whiskey has done a vast ileal of
harm in the United States. I would try
to make it do some good. I would use
the tax to fortify our cities on the sea
board.”
Further. Mr. Blaine informed the Tri
bune representative that, he would main
tain the tax on whisky ‘‘so long as there
is whisky to tax, and when the nation**]
government should have no use for the
money I would divide the tax among the
Federal Union, with the specific object
of lightening the tax on real estate. The
houses and farms of the whole country
pay too large a proportion of the total
taxes. If, ultimately, relief could be
given in that direction, it would, in my
judgment, be a wise and beneficent
policy.”
Concerning protection to wool-growers.
Mi. Blaine said: “I should seriously ob
ject to the repeal of the duty on wool.
T<* repeal that would work great injus
tice to many interests.” The question
labor, Mr. Blaine declared, underlay the
whole subject.
The interview, which is of considerable
length, £ ives a lucid statement of Mr.
Blaine s views on the tariff of 1846 and
its results, one ol which, lie holds, was
the financial panic of 1857, which every
bank in New York was compelled to sus
pend specie payment. Four hundred
millions in g Id had b*en earned out of
the country in eight years to pay for for
eigu go vds that should have been manu
factored at home, and we had years of
depression and distress as an atonement
for our follv.
Attention is given in the report to the
subject of ?h increase of our export
trade, Mr. Blaine asserting the import
ance of this. He said, however, *‘it is
vastly more important lot to lose our
own great market for our own people in
he vain effort to reach the impossible.
It. is the vast domestic trade which is
valuable. It is into t his illimit able trade,
even now m its infancy and destined to
attain a magnitude n >t dreamed ot twenty
years ago, that the Europeans are strug
gling to enter. The genuine free trader
appears unable to see or comprehend that
tins eont.iueiUid trade—not our exchanges
wim Europe—is the great source ol our
prosperity. President Cleveland now
pl duly proposes a policy that will admit
Europe to a share of this trade.”
To the ques ion concerning the effact
of the President’s message in the S mth,
Mr. Blaine said: “I don’t, due to uiswer
that question. The truth has been so
long obscured by certain local questions
of unreasoning prejudice that nobody
can hope for indusTjia) enlightenment
among their lead, rs just yet. But in my
view the South above all sections of the
Union needs a protective tariff. The two
Virginias, North Carolina, Kentucky,
Missouri, Tennessee, Alabama and Gror
gia have enormous resources and facilities
for developing and handling in ami fac
tor's.
‘•They cannot do anything without
protection. Even progress so vast as
some of those Slates have made will he
checked it the President’s message is
enacted into law. Their Senators and
Representatives can prevent it, but they
are so used to following anything labeled
‘democratic’ that verv prob.-hly they will
follow the President and blight the pro
gress already made. By the time some
of the Southern States get free iron and
coal,while tobacco is taxsd, they may have
occasion to sit down and calculate the
value, of Democratic free trade to their
1 >cal iuteres s.”

SENATE.
Wahington, Dec. 5. The Senate
Chamber wore a fresh and tasteful ap
pearance this morning. The floors and
galleries weie newly carpeted, and the
desks glistened in their coat of varnish,
the odor of which mingled faintly with
that of the bouquets and gorgeous floral
devices which enlivened the picture. The
Senator most favored in the matter of
flowers was Mr. Daniel, of Virginia.
The devices were all ot mammoth pro
portions, and covered not only his desk
and chair, bin overlapped upon the
of his neighbors. A huge horseshoe, a
ladder ot half a dozen rounds and a shield
comprising the coat-of-arms of Virginia,
were chief among the pieces. Senator
Ridiilebcrger s desk boro a harp, with
the compliments of the (’lan na Gaol of
Philadelphia. Senator Gorman was the
recipient of a horseshoe upon an easel.
The desks of Senator Harris, BeCK, Pad
dock, Stewart, Mi nderson and Palmer
amt that of the President of the Senate
wee also elaborately adorned with
flowers in various unique aud tasteful
forms.
Tne galleries were early crowded and
to overflowing. Mrs. Cleveland, clad in
a costume of dark gr.en, and accom
panied by Mrs. Gilder, Mrs. Kingsford
and several other lady friends, occupied
ifie seats reserved fur the family of the
President in one of the private galleries.
The Diplomatic gallery was filled by
members of the various Legations, the
front seat being occupied by the Chinese
Ministers, his secretaries and associates.
The Minister wore a magnificent robe of
light blue satin, and Ins companions were
clad as richly, though iu more subdued
1 colors.
The proceedings of the day were opened
witli prayer ty the Chaplain. Rev J. G.
Bu-ler. He asked that Senators might
be endowed with wisdom and strength
to meet the honorable and trving re
sponsibilities oi the day aud all the duties
that gathered round them. The President
of the Senate, Mr Ingall’s, then took
the chair and called the Senate to order.
IL* said he would now place before the
Senate the certificates ot election, the
certificates of appointment and other
papers received since the adjournment.
Tne following papers were thereupon
submitted and i *ad; Certificates of tlie
Governor of Florida making temporary
appointment of J. J. Finlay as Senator
from 4 b of Match, 1887, until the Leg
islature should till the vacancy caused
by the expiration of the term of Senator
Jones; certificate of the Governor of
Florida of the election by the Legisla
ture of Samuel Pasco.
Certificate of toe Governor of New
Jersey of the eh ctiou ol Ruins Blodcett.
Certificate of the Govern i ot Wi st Vir
-1 giuia of Hie appointment by him of
Daniel B. Lucas to fill the vacancy caused
by the expiration ot the term of Senator
1 Camden. Certificate ot the Governor o
West Vugiri.aof a smtnuary of the pro
ceedings by which the Legislature in spe
cial session elected Charles J. I aulkner
as Senator till the vacancy. Creden
tials of William E. (’handler as Senator
from the State oi New Hampshire. Pro
test of Daniel B. Lucas against the ad
ministration of the oath of office to
Charles J. Faulkner. The grounds of
the protest are:
First, That the Executive of the Stats
of West Virginia has not certified tbe
election of Charles J. Faulkner under tb
seal of the Stale, as required by act of
Congress.
Sec mil. For reasons set out in the
brief of Damol B. Lucas, a aopy of which
accompanied the protest.
Third, Because Charles J. Faulkner
was at the lime aud date of his alleged
election, on the sv.h of May, 1887. a Judge
of the Thirteenth Juoical D.strict of
, West Virginia, and, therefore, ineligible
to the office of Senator The protest was
laid on rhe table ami ordered to he print id
in the Record.
The ceremony of administering the
oath of office to the newly elected Sena
tors was then proceeded with, such Sena
tors being called in p irtics of lour and
alphabetical order. The first four Sena
tors thus c riled and sworn (in all instances
with uplifted hand and not on the Bible)
were Aldrich, Bate. B odgett and (’hand
ler. The second lour were Cockrell,
Daniel, Davis and Dawes The third
, four callwere E hounds. Faulkner.
George and Gorman. Mr. Hoar objected,
for the time, to administeiing the oath
of office to Mr. Faulkner. He under
stood that whatever quesuou arose con
cerning the title ol s Senator to a seat
arose on the credentials themselves—the
whole proceedings of tin* Legislature, and
the history of the case being there dis
closed and fully recited.
HOUSE.
Long oefore the hour of noon the gal
leries of the House were crowded to their
utmost capacity with spectators drawn
together to witness the opening scenes of
a new Congress. The ladies were in the
majority, and their gay costumes lent an
air of animation t<* the chamber. On the
floor members congregated and exciiang
ed greetings and c mgratulations. There
were very few floral decorations upon
the desks of members, though Mr. f. J.
Campbell, of New York, was favor* d
with a horseshoe of carnations and ros-es,
the gift of the Oriental Club, of New
York.
At noon the Clerk of the House called
the body to order, and was about to call
the roll when a crank iu the gallery
started a Salvation Army hymn winch
be sang lustily until ejected by a door
keeper. which was not until several min
utos had elapsed, as the crowd impeded
the official in his attempt to reach the
musid*n.
The Clerk then proceeded with the
roll call amid a good deal of contusion
caused by gontlem**n renewing old ac
quaiutances or forming new ones amid
much talk and laught t. The p iges
were kept busy carrying belated bou
quets and floral designs to the proper
recipients. Among the handsomest of
the designs was one presented to Mr.
Lawler, of Illin is. I was a tablet i f
roses on wnicn was inscribed in purpl*'
immortelles “Libor's Champion ”
M. Rami II s desk was embellished
wi’h a harp, and that of Mr. Stahlnecker,
of New Y :k, was aduruvi with a tall
floral vase.
On the call of the roll 313 memh •: i an
swered to their mi r, s, •. i lie Clerk an
uouncod t.ha‘, more man a q iorum being
present, the next business u. order was
the election of a Sp *.*ker.
John G. Carbsl was vat in nomination
by M . Cox, of N w York, and Thom is
If. Reed by Mr. Cannon, of Illinois
At the request of too Cl rk. Messrs.
Randall, Mill '. Long a id .VL K nicy took
their places at tin* Clerk's d. sk to act as
tally keepers, and the roll was aguu
called. The vote resulted as fol’ows,:
Total number of vo es cast 313 For

Carlisle; NumolD, of N *h (V-olina,
and S.niih. of Wisconsin, lor Bmmiu;

The Clerk thereupon decl *:ed Mr. Cai

that gentleman was escort, d to the
Speaker's desk by Messrs. Cox aud Reed
amid loud applause.
The oath of office having been admin
istered by Mr. K lley of Pennsylvania,
the Speader rapped the House to order.
