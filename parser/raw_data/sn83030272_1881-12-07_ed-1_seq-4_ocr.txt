Tue Situation In Ireland
Whomi Mr PtnNrtt nnd his friends wsro
thrown IuitO jail it was asserted by London
newspapers that thu Lamut League had been
crusIiel and that the norent manifesto
would be ummimeeded by time Iri8tm people
When shortly afterward tim Land Courts
begamm tlmcir oPeratimuims by large reductions
of remit iii cases of exemo oppression it
was averred wIth equal confidence that the
flflsS of landlords and tenants WoUIt conic
to terms by urlvate agreemnent in accord
ance with tIme judicial precedents have
these expectations becum fullihied oraro there
aumy signs of their fuhfllnient
It Is not easy to overestimate tIme strain to
which irish tenants were subjected by time
imoremmt manifesto TIm iienait for obeying
it was evIction aiim time British Government
lund given warning that this would be
sterimiy enforced rho winter was coining
on and every tenant was called upon to
decide whether by an net of fidelity to lila
chosen leaders ho would take time risk of ule
prlving his wile and children of food and
shelter It would not have been surprls
lug if mmli had given way under such a
grievous stress ci circumstances it is truly
astonishing that any should hare hind
the courage to respond to time despairing
summmmnons fromim 1tlmumaInimam jail In their
relentless dealing with the Land Leagumo
time GLADSTOn Calulimet havo reckoned on
the wciukmmess of hummmnn nature and it
wellnigh imuetedibia that timeir calculations
ehoulmi prove unfounded For a timo It

It is certaimm that tIme Laud Courts have
been besieged with applicants for inter

of the IrCscnt wcelt wilt scarcely fall almort
of 60000 It tunis nut however timat these
appiicants arm not equally dimtrIbutcd over
the whole of Ireland but arc for time most
part concentrated Iii those distrIcts where

Government is PISCCtI In a most eimibarrmmss
Immg predleanmeat It had taken measures
to ovict by way of examnpie a certain
number of nonpayers but its legal ma
clmiunry Is of course inadequate to such
an anomalous roccediug as turning
time population of a whole county out of
doors Nor would It have the hardlimood
to perpetrate such a crime against society
In iistmiet8 whore the immnjority of tenants

might suiTor Mm Fonsita to deal hmarahly
with time obdurate exceptions In those
Parts of Ireland however where the bulk

So far tiicmm as a large part of Ireland is

and the miimmnber of bimesu undoubtedly will
be greatly augmemmted by fresh applications
from those counties where the weight of
o1uimmiofl favors the recognition of the Land
Courts Of course the appeals of which not
a single oumo imas yet been heard wIll ho
dealt with much more slowly for the re
son that they all must come boforo a single
tribunal We must boar in mind too that
the landlords acting under a resolution of
the Property Defence Association imavo ap
pealed in every Instance whore reductiomma
have been made with the manifest object of
exhausting the patience or pocket of tho
tenant From theso facts it scorns certain
that many years must elapse bolero the
Land Courts will bo able by a final arbitra
tion to effect any nmatevial change in the
relation of iandlordB and tenants
Now It must ho plain to every one that no
such tardy and insignificant results could
have been contemplated by time framers of
time Lanmi aoL They stmpposed that a few
decisions in elccted casos would be gen
orally aeeptcd as rent standards in con
formity with which all differences between
lnndowrers arid occupants wouid be
promptly settled out of court Such would
unquestionably hmmtvn been the caso had Mr
PAILNLLTi been permitted to carry out lila
project and designate the cases to be first
adjudicated provkicci of course tho 0ev
eruuumment had attested their sincerity by as
senting to commaideratulo reductions in timoso
instnimces Not only would timo tenants nut
veremilly have accepted standards pro
nouncomi just by men in whom timoy
hind implicit confidence but wlut Is more
to our present ilumrpose time landioris would
have rccogmuirctl time uselessness of further

supposed to be Mr Buchanans organ For
thin supposition I do not know that there was
tiny foundation excepting that the anper en
joyed some of the advortising patronage of the
Government It might be inferred from Mr
Kings letters to his correspondent that ho
spoke to the President repeatedly about this
paper and that the President did nothing Mr
King does not appear to havo known that the
President rebuked this emlitor for his course in
regard to socession I have in my possession
on President Buchanans files a copy of his

In time multiplicity of matters of the gravest
concern which in tho month oi November 1860
demanded the Prosidonts attentionof which
ad well as of all his conduct down to the 4th of
March 1861 I expect ore long to give to time
public a full accounthe may have net done
everything timat tile anxious friends desiredbe
fore his annual mossago of Doe 8 1860 to ra
here their mind of the approlmension that his
Administration was suffering Injury from this
newspaper and other similar signs that It bar
bored secassionists among Its oflicore or the
objects of its patronage But I take it upon me
toamrmaftertlme mostthorouah study of Mr
Buchanans course and a full examination of
the very abundant materials contained in
his private vapors that from thmo time
of Mr Lincolns election when the secession
cit South Carolina was first threatened down to
the day of Mr Lincolua Inauguration Mr Bu
chmmnan never did an Important act which any
patriot or any friend of his would now wiaimtimat
lie had not done or refrained from doing an
imortatmt act that any patriot or friend of his
would upon close consideration of the facts
say that ho ought to have performed
There to not a more romnarkablo Instance in
all history of limo misconception and mis
reproentatlon with which agreat pubibo man
may bo etirsuod timaa this case of Mc
Buchanan It Is somewhat encouraging
that limo revelations recently mmmdc by tIme
aurvivln mnmmmbors of hits Cabinet Messrs
Black llolt TimQmpson and King have tend
ed to show the peoplo of this country
how mnistakon mutiny of theta bavo been
In regard to him But ii must be
remembered that Gun Dix and Mr Stanton are
10 longer living From them and from Mr
Bolt will come In duo time the most indubit
able proofs put on record Immediately after
time close of hue atlminlstrmttion and when facts
were recent that their authority Is not to be
used to disparage any part of his conduct his
consistency his firmness his fidelity to tho
Constitution and the Union the wisdom of his
mncasures and the propriety of his acts Tim
time has come when Mr Buchanan himself
when the truth as it Is should hnvo a hearing
