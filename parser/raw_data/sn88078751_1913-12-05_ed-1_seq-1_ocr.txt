Fearful Of Present Policy Says The Hay Bill, Which Pro
vides For A Volunteer Army And Which is Rushed
Through The House, Is Part Of The Government's
Plan To Get Itself in Readiness For Hostilities
Essence Of His Remarks
Washington, Doc. 4. James R.
Mann, the Republican leader of the
house, declared In the course of de
bate In tho house that war between
the United States and Mexico is in
evitable and that the president Is
faking arrangements accordingly.
The fact that the Democrats allowed
this statement to go unchallenged
added to Its significance.
Mr. Mann's prophecy of war with
Mexico caino as a surprise and cre
ated a deep impression in the house.
It added to the importance of a bill
called up by Representative Hay of
Virginia, chairman of the house com
mittee on military affairs, and later
passed, authorizing the president to
raise volunteer forces in time of act
ual or threatened war."
Mr. Mann said solemnly that the
Hay bill was part of the plan of the
government to get Itself in readiness
for war with Mexico. Predicting a
conflict, Mr. Mann said: "I should
greatly regret such a war. I do not
see any escape from chaos and an
archy in Mexico under the plan which
which we are now pursuing. Of
course, if that runs very long, it
means war."
Provisions of Hay Bill.
The Hny bill, which provides for a
voluntary army to be raised In tho
discretion of the president, now goes
to the senate. It was said that this
body will take immediate action on
tho measnie. Color Is given the
statement of Mr. Mann that the ad
ministration Is preparing for trouble
by tho haste that marked the pas
sage of tho Hay bill.
Further evidence in support of Mr.
Mann's bellof that the administration
Is preparing for trouble was found In
an announcement made by Demo
cratic leaders that early next week
the house will pass tho naval mili'ary
bill. This bill proposes to enlarge
and render the naval militia more ef
ficient. ,
Mr. Mann told of the situation that
obtained in congress Just before the
war with Spain, and suggested that
tho appearance of tho Hay bill on the
day following President Wilson's
public discussion of the Mexican situ
ation in his message was significant.
"I have no complaint to make," ho
continued, "of the attitude which the
president has taken in his dealings
with Moxlco. I confess I can not see
an end to the road which it is now
traversing. The president told us
that the Huerta government in Mex
ico would soon fall. Very likely. I
think that any government In Mexico
which does not receive the moral
support of our government will not
last a great length of time, and I
doubt whether any government in
Mexico constituted by the so-called
Constitutionalists or the other revo
lutionists will last with the support
of our government."

IN DYING
CONDITION
By A New York Woman In
Chicago
ii
Claims New Law Constitutes
Class 'Legislation,
TEST SUIT FILED AT CHICAGO
Plaintiff Alleges the Act Violates
Fifth Amendment to Constitution
In That It Deprives Her of Prop
erty Without Due Process of Law,
Attorney General McReynolds May
Assist Defense.
Chicago, Dec. 4. Charges that the
Income tax section of tho new tariff
law constitutes class legislation and
is unconstitutional wore made In a
test suit filed here against the Conti
nental and Commercial Trust and
Savings bank on behalf of Miss Elsie
DeWolfe of New York.
The United States government
probably will be asked to aid in de
fense of the bill, according to Levy
Mayer, counsel for the bank, who said
he would seek a conference with At
torney General McReynolds to dis
cuss carrying tho action to the United
States supreme court for a ruling.
The declaration, Oled by Bourke
Cockran of New York and Colin
Fyffe of Chicugo, for Miss DeWolfe,
alleges that the tax violates the fifth
amendment to the constitution, in
that it deprives her of proporty with
out due process of law, and that It
violates the fourteenth amendment,
In denying her equn! protection under
the law.
The graduuted scale of taxation,
the declaration alleges, discriminates
unjustly against persons of Income
under $100,000 a year, "usually gained
from industrial and artistic pursuits,"
in favor of those with incomes of
more than ?100,000 a, 'year. Miss Do
Wolfe was an actress. She retired
from the stage In 1905 and Is at pres
ent In Paris.
The suit was brought to compel the
bank to pay the interest on 30 bonds
of a power company which, the bill
states, the bank had declined to pay
unless Miss DeWolfe filed n certifi
cate of ownership as provided by the
income tax law. Damages ot $1,000
are asked In each of five counts.
The plaintiff alleges that the In
come tax is not uniform and that the
law Is therefore unconstitutional, bo
cause: "It is imposed on only 423,000
in a population of about 90,000,000
and tho persons who would pay tho
tax have not consented to Its Imposi
tion; 'and the tax violates the ele
ments of equality In its graduated
scale of taxation."
The plaintiff points out that she, be
ing an unmarried woman, is subject
not only to a tax of 1 per cent on her
whole income in excess of $3,000, but
is subject to &n additional tax of 1
per cent on that portion exceeding
$20,000 and less than $50,000; an ad
ditional 1 per cent between $50,000
and $75,000, and an additional 1 per
cent between $75,000 and $100,000.
