AMUSEMENTS
Mme. Louise Honrtr.
Measured -tfy the audience that
greeted Mme. Louise Homer yester
day afternoon. Washington is a
music-loving city. This impression,
conveyed by the enthusiasm of a
gathering that Oiled every seat in
the National Theater, was acoented
by an atmosphere of listening ln
tentness that obviously absorbed
every note on the program?includ
ing responses to insistent recalls.
Music lovers, however, are not nec
essarily trained musicians, and for
that reason Mme. Homer is to be
commended for the wisdom of a pro
gram so versatile as to satisfy every
phase of song-hunger, ranging from
oratorio to folk songs, beginning
with Beethoven and ending approxi
mately with Mother Goose.
Artistically good to look upon, in
American beauty satin and with a
red rose in her hair, the singer gave
for her opening number Beethoven's
"Hymn to Nature." voicing the theme
with an inspirational jnelody worthy
of the work that placed probably the
greatest composer of the ages among
the masters of song. Prom Men
delssohn's "Oratorio of St. Paul" she
selected "The Lord Is Mindful of His
Own." in which she visioned, with In
spirational melody, an aria that had
the martyrdom of Stephen for Its
theme.
Handel's "Vo Far Guerre," from his
opera of "Rlnaldo," eloped the first
group, and at Its close Mme. Homer
gave for encore "In the Time of Roses."
Following a second group, in which the
singer received individual recognition
for her numbers from Victor Masse, a
number from "Resplghi" and a beauti
fully melodious rendition of "In Questa
Flera," from "La Glooonda," adapted by
PonchleiU from Victor Hugo's "Angelo."
Mme. Homer received, possibly, her
| greatest ovation for Sydney Homer's set
ting of Joaquin Miller's scathing rebuke
i "To Russia." which she gave with dra
matic tensity. It was greeted by an
Instant's silence, followed by a storm of I
applause.
The remainder of the program con
sisted of Homer's "Sheep and "Lambs"
and "Mother Goose," which were given ]
with the charm of sentiment and joyous
fun that captivated, in turn. Folksongs
f{om the Hungarian. Latvian and Slo
vakian followed, and nothing too fine
could be said of the wisps of sadness
that threaded the deep-throated melody
of "The-Falling Star" or the singing
quality of "Lullaby.'" which carried in
each note the tenderness of a young
mother who sings to a baby that some
how understands.
To speak of the glorious quality of
Mme. Homer's contralto voice would be
telling concertgoers what they already
know, but one cannot resist mention of
the clear enunciation which gives a
story-telling Interest to her work. It is
not a usual gift. Also, if permissible,
the might like to know that following
the concert, many women in the lobby
paid tribute to the exquisite artistry of
a toilet so beautifully remindful of a
day when it was customary to wear
clothes. N. L.

EXPECT AID FOR RUSSIA.
Surplus Medical Supplies of Army
May Be Used to Help.
The War Department 'will be au
thorized by Congress, it wag Indicated
Thursday, to turn , over to the Am - -
lean Relief Administration its sur
plus medical supplies for use In the
famine districts of Russia.
Members of the House military com
mittee have agreed to report favor
ably a resolution authorizing the
transfer of supplies, and it is expect
ed that the committee will formally
report the measure tomorrow ai a
substitute for a bill passed early In
the week by the Senate. The pro
visions of the two proposals are simi
lar except that the House measure
carries a stipulation that the cost
value of the supplies donated for re
lief work shall not exceed $4,000,000.
No move has as yet been made in
the House toward authorizing; an ap
propriation for food for starving
Russians, as recommended by Presi
dent Harding in his message to Con
gress. The President urged that funds
for the purchase of 10,000,000 bushels
of corn and 1,000.000 bushels of seed
grain should be made available for
distribution In Russia.
