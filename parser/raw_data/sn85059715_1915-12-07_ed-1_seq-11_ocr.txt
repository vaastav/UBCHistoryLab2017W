PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE
Chief Executive Details His Plans For
National Preparedness ? Disloyalty
at Home Denounced?Urgent
Need of Our Own Ships.
Following is the message of
President Wilson delivered at
a Joint session of the senate and
e, hoURe at the beginning of the
oixty-fourth congress:
Gentlemen of the Congress-Sinco I
had ">e Privilege of addressing
you on the etnte of the Union the war
of nations on the other side of the sen,
which had then only begun to disclose
its portentous proportions, has extend
ed its threatening and sinister scope
until It has swept within Its tlnrae
some portion of every quarter of the
dobe. not excepting our own hemi
sphere, has altered the whole face of
International nffalrs, and now presents
? prospect of reorganization and re
?onstractlon such as statesmen and
Peoples hnve never been called upon
to attempt berore.
Studiously Neutral,
We have stood apart, studiously neu
tral. It wns our manifest duty to do
*o. Not only did we hnve no part or
Interest In the policies which seem to
have brought the conflict on; It was
'accessary, If a universal catastrophe
was to be avoided, that a limit should
be set to the sweep of destructive war
and that some part of the great fam
ily of nations should keep the process
es of peace alive, If only to prevent
collective economic ruin and the break
down throughout the world of the In
dustries by which Its populations are
11 sus,alne(1- It was manifestly
of ?hi ? ,the scIf governed nations
of this hemisphere to redress. If possl
*',l6,e balance of economic loss nnd
confpsWn in the other. If they con IS
do nothing more. In the day of read
justment and recuperation we earnest
ly hope and believe that they can be
of infinite scrvice.
In this neutrality, to which they
nntl n0t ?"ly by thelr sep
arate life and their habitual detach
ment from the politics of Europe, but
also by n elenr perception of Interna
becnm? S"ltos of AmCrica have
become consc ous of a nc?- and more
ninl ""'ty "f lu,cr,>8t an<J moral
partnership In affairs, more clearly
conscious of the many common sympa
,i,wi "" .luteros,s ?n'l duties which
bid them stand together.
There was n time In the early days
of our own great nation nnd of the
publics fighting their way to independ
wh., Contrnl an<1 South America
"hen the government of the United
States looked upon Itself as In some
sort the guardian of the republics to
the south of her as against anv en
croachments or efforts at political con
trol from the other side of the water
with !tS, d!'ty t0 Plny tllB "art even
? lnvltatlon from them, and I
Ihlnk that we can claim that the task
was undertaken with a true and dlsln
terested enthusiasm for the freedom
of the Americas and the unmolested
self government of her Independent
peoples But It was always difficult to
maintain such a role without offense
<?? the pride of the peoples whose free
dom of action we sought to protect
Without provoking serious mis
conceptions of our motives, nnd every
thoughtful man of nffalrs must wel
come the altered circumstances of the
new day In whose light we now stand,
when thero Is no claim of gunrdlan
shlp or thought of wards, but instead
n full und honorable association as of
partners between ourselves nnd our
neighbors In the Interest of nil Amer
ica. nprth nnd south. Our concern for
the Independence nnd prosperity of the
states of Central and South America
?S i11?,' aIt01cd- Wc rot?lJi unabated the
spirit that hns Inspired us throughout
the whole life of our government and
which was so frankly put Into words
by President Monroe. We still mean
always to make a common cause of
national Independence and of political
liberty in America. But that purpose
Is now better understood so far ns It
concerns ourselves. It Is known not to
be a selfish purpose. It Is known to
have in it no thought of taking advan
tage of any government In this hemi
sphere or playing its political fortunes
for our own benefit. All the govern
ments of America stand, so far as we
are concerned, upon a footing of genu
ine equality and unquestioned Inde
pendence.
Put to th* Test In Maxico.
We havo been put to the test In the
case of Mexico, and we havo stood the
test. Whether we have benefited Mex
ico by the course we have pursued re
mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in
her own bands. But we have at least
proved that we will not take advan
tage of her In her distress and under
lie to Impose upon her an order and
government of our own cliooslug. Lib
erty Is often a fierce and intractable
thing, to which no bounds can bo set
and to which no bounds of a few
men's choosing ought ever io be set
Every American who has drunk at
the true fountains of prlnclplo and tra
dition must subscribe without reserva
tion to the high doctrine of the Vir
ginia bill of rights, which In the great
days in which our government was set
up was everywhere among us accept
ed as the creed of free men. That doc
trine Is, "That government Is or ought
to be instituted for the common bone
fit, protection and security of the peo
ple, nation 'or comma city;" that "of
all the various modes and forms of
sorenunent W Is the best which 1*
capable of producing the greatest de
(tree of happiness and safety and Is
most effectually secured ngulnst the
danger of maladministration, and that
when any government shall he fouud
Inadequate or contrary to these pur
poses a majority of the community
hath an indubitable. Inalienable and
Indefeasible right to reform, alter or
abolish It in such manner as shall be
judged most conducive to the public
weal." We have 'unhesitatingly ap
plied that heroic principle to the case
of Mexico and now hopefully await
the rebirth of the troubled republic,
wblcli had so much of which to purge
itself and so little sympathy from any
outside quarter in the radical but nec
essary process. We will aid and be
friend Mexico, but we will not coerce
her, and our course with regard to her
ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer
ica that we seek no political suzerainty
or selfish control.
The o>. 1 Is that the states of Amer
ica arc ? hostile rivals, but co-op
crating friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community of Interest,
alike In matters political and In mat
ters economic, Is likely to give them a
r?cw significance as factors In interna
tional affairs and In the political his
tory of the world. It presents them as
In a very ilcep and true sense a unit
In world affairs, spiritual partners,
standing together because thinking to
gether. quick with common sympathies
and common ideals. Separated they
are subject to all the cross currents of
the confused politics of a world of hos
tile rivalries; united In spirit and pur
pose they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
None of the Spirit of Empire.
This Is pan-Americanism. It has none
of the spirit of empire in it It is the
embodiment, the effectual embodiment,
of the spirit of law and Independence
and liberty and mutual service.
A very notable body of men recently
met lp the city of Washington, at the
Invitation and as the guests of this
government, whose deliberations are
likely to be looked back to as marking
a memorable turning point In the his
tory of Americn. They were repre
sentative spokesmen of the several
Independent states of this hemisphere
and were assembled to discuss the
financial and commercial relations of
the republics of the two continents
which nature; and political fortune
have so Intimately linked together. I
earnestly recommend to your perusal
the reports of their proceedings and of
the actions of their committees, l'ou
will get from them, I think, a fresh
conception of the ease and Intelligence
and advantage with which Americans
of both continents may draw together
in practical co-operation and of what
the material foundations of this hope
ful partnership of Interest must con
sist?of how we should build them and
of how necessary It Is that wo should
hasten their building.
There Is, I venture to point out an
especial significance Just now attach
ing to this whole matter of drawing
the Americas together In bonds of hon
orable partisanship and mutual advan
tage because of the economic readjust
ments which the world must inevitably
witness within the next generation,
when peace shall have at last resumed
Its healthful tasks. In the perform
ance of these tasks I believe the Amer
icas to be destined to play their parts
together. I am Interested to fix your
attention on this prosi>eet now because
unless you take It within your view
and permit the full significance of It to
command yonr thought 1 cannot find
the right light in which to set forth
the particular matter that lies at(the
very front of my whole thought as I
address you today. I mean national
defense.
No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people for whom we
arc appointed to speak can fall to per
ceive that their passion Is for peace,
their genius best displayed in the prac
tice of the arts of peace. Great democ
racies are not belligerent. They do not
seek or desire war. Their thought Is
of individual liberty and of the free
labor that supports life and the un
censored thought that quickens It
Conquest and dominion are not In our
reckoning or agreeable to our princi
ples. But just because we demand un
molested development and the undis
turbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent, from whntover
quarter It may come, tbe aggression we
ourselves will not practice. Wo Insist
upon security In prosecuting our self
chosen lines of national development.
We So more than that Wo demand It
also for others. We (lo not confine our
enthusiasm for individual liberty and
free national development to the Inci
dents and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel It wher
ever there is a people that tries to walk
lh these difficult paths of Independence
and right From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
of liberty on this side tbe sea and have
deemed it as important that our neigh
bors should be free from all outside
domination as that we ourselves should
be; have set America aside as a whole
for the uses of Independent nations and
political freemen.
Out of such thoughts grow all onr
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting tbe rights of a peo
ple against aggression. And we are
?MB*.';
as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dicta
torial power within ourown nation
as of aggression from without V\ o
will not maintain a standing army ex
cept for uses which are as necessary
In times of peace as In times of war,
anil we shall always see to It that our
military poace establishment Is no
larger than la actually and continuous
ly needed for the uses of duys In which
no enemies move against us. But we
do believe In a body of free cttlsena
ready and sufllclont to take care of
themselves and of the governments
which they have set np to servo them.
In our constitutions themselves we
have commanded tliat "the right of
the people to keep and bear arms shall
not be Infringed." and our confidence
has been that our safety In times of
danger would lie In the rising of the
nation to take enre of Itself, as the
farmers rose at Lexington.
War Disciplined Might.
But war has never been a mere mat
ter of men and guns. It la a thing
of disciplined might. Tf our citizens
nre ever to flglit effectively upon a
sudden summons, they must know
how modern lighting Is done, and what
to do when the summons comes to
render themselves Immediately avail
able and Immediately effective. And
the government must bo their servant
In this matter, must supply them with
the training they need to take care of
themselves and of It. The military
arm of their government, which they
will not allow to direct them, they may
properly use to serve them and make
their independence secure, and not
their own Independence merely, but
the rights also of those with whom
they have made common cause, Bhould
they also be put In Jeopardy. They
must be fitted to play the great role
In the world, and particularly In tills
hemisphere, for which they are quali
fied by principle and by chastened am
bition to play.
it Is with these Ideals In mind that
the plans of the department of war for
more adequate national defense were
conceived which will bo laid before
you, and which I urge you to sanction
and put Into effect as soon as they can
be properly scrutinized and discussed.
Tliey seem to me the essential first
steps, and they seem to me for the
present sufficient.
They contemplate au lncrense of the
standing force of the regular army
from Its present strength of r>,023 offi
cers and 102,Ubo enlisted men of all
services to a strength of 7,180 officers
and 134,707 enlisted men, or 141,843
all told, alt services, rank and file, by
the addition of flfty-two companies of
coast artillery, fifteen companies of en
gineers, ten regiments of Infantry, four
regiments of field artillery and four
aero squadrons, besides 750 officers re
quired for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all Important
duly of training the citizen force of
which I shall presently speak, 71)2 uon
commlssioned officers for service in
drill, recruiting and the like and the
necessary quota of enlisted men for
the quartermaster corps, the hospital
corps, the ordnance department and
other similar auxiliary services. These
are the additions necessary to render
the army adequate for Its present du
tlcB, duties which It has to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders and at our Interior
army posts, but also In tho Philippines,
In the Hawaiian Islands, at the Isth
mus and In Porto Kico.
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part o? Its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale
should occasion arise the plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
by a force of 400,000 disciplined citi
zens, raised In Increments of 133,000 a
year throughout a period of three
years. This It Is proposed to do by a
process of enlistment under which the
serviceable men of the country would
be nsked to bind themselves to serve
with tho colors for purposes of train
ing for short periods throughout three
years and to come to the colors at cull
at any time throughout an additional
"furlough" period of three years. This
force of 400,000 men would be pro
vided with personal accouterments as
fast as enlisted and their equipment
for the field made ready to be supplied
at any time. They would be assem
bled for training at stated Intervals at
convenient places In association with
suitable units of the regular army.
Their period of annual training would
not necessarily exceed two months In
the year.
It would depend upon the patriotic
feeling of the younger men of ? the
country whether they responded to
such a cali to service, or nof. It
would depend upon the patriotic spirit
of the employers of the country wheth
er they made It possible for the young
er men In their employ to respond un
der favorable conditions or not I for
one do not doubt the patriotic devotion
either of our young men or of those
who give them employment-those for
whose benefit and protection they
would In fact enlist. I would loot
forward to the success of such an ex
periment with entire confidence.
At least so much by way of prepara
tion for defense seems to me to be ab
solutely Imperative now. We cannot
do less.
The program which will be laid be
fore you by the secretary Of the navy
Is similarly conceived. It Involves only
a shortening of the time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
out but it does make definite and ex
plicit a program which has heretofore
been only implicit, held to' the minds
of the committees on natal aHali* and
disclosed to tho debates of the two
booses, but nowhere tonanlated or fop
maily adopted. .It seems to me Tew
clear that U will be ,0 tli, advantage
of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the
nary upon a llnnl footing of strength
and efficiency and to pros, that plan
to completion within the next five
year.. We have always looked to the
"".7. "f th? """'fT ?? our flint and
chief line of defense; we hare always
seen It to be our manifest coarse of
prudence to he strong on the sens,
icnr by year wo hnre beon creating a
navy which now rank* very high ln
.deed stnong the nnvlesof the maritime
nations. U o should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete wlint
we have begun and how soon.
The Navy Program.
The program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
vo years of ten battleships, six bat
tle cruiser*, ton scout cruisers, flfty
destroyers, flft?n fl,,et submarines,
elgbty-flTc coast submarines, four gun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni
tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one
repair ship. It Is proposed that of this
number we shall the first year provide
for the construction of two battleships,
two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers,
fifteen destroyers. Ova fleet submarines,
twenty-five coast submarines, two gun
boats and one hospital ship; the second
year two battleships, one scout cruiser
ten destroyers, four fleet submarines,
fifteen cosst submarines, one gunboat
and one fuel oil ship; the third year
two battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet
submarines and fifteen coast subma
rines; the fourth year two battleships,
two battlo cruisers, two scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, ono ammuni
tion ship and ono fuel oil ship, and
the fifth year two battleships, one bat
tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de
stroyers. two fleet submarines, fifteen
coast sntfmarlnes. ono gunboat, ono am
munition ship and one repair ship.
The secretary of the navy Is asking
also for the Immediate addition to the
personnel of the navj of T,r>00 snllors,
2.500 apprentice sesmen and 1,500 ma
rines. This Increase would lie suffi
cient lo care for the ships whloh are
to I* completed within the fiscal year
1B17 snd also for the number of men
which must be pot in training to man
the ships which will be completed
early in 1M8. It is slso necessary that
the number of midshipmen at the Na
val academy at Annapolis should be
increased by Jit least 300 In order that
the force of ofltcers should be more
rapidly added to, and authority Is ask
ed lo appoint, for engineering duties
only, approved graduates of engineer
ing colleges, and for service In the avi
ation corps a certain number of men
taken from civil life.
If this full program should be corried
JWW should have built or building in
1021, according to the estimates of sur
vival and standards of classification
followed by the general board of the
department, an effective navy consist
ing of 27 battleships of the first line 0
battle cruisers, 25 battleships of the
second line, 10 armored cruisers III
scout cruisers, 5 first class cruisers, 8
second class cruisers, 10 third class
cruisers, 108 dostroyers. 18 fleet sub
marines, 157 coast submarines, S mon
itor*, 20 gunboats, 4 supply ships, IB
fuel ships, 4 transports, 3 tenders to
torpedo vessels, 8 vessels of special
types and two ammunition ships. This
would be a navy fitted to our needs
and worthy of our traditions.
But armies and Instruments of war
are only part of what bas to be con
sidered if we are to consider the su
preme matter of national self sufficien
cy and security In all lis aspects
There arc other great matters which
will be thrust upon our attention
whether we will or not. Thero is, for
example, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping Involved In this
Ifrent problem of national adequacy.
It is necessary for many weighty rea
sons of national efficiency and devel
opment that we should have a great
merchant marine. The great mercbapt
fleet we once used to make us rich
that great body of sturdy sailors who
used to cprry our flag Into every sea,
and who were tho pride and often the
bulwark of the nation, we have almost
driven out of existence by Inexcusable
neglect and Indifference and by a hope
lessly blind and provincial policy 0f
so called economic protection. It is
high time we repaired our mistake and
resumed our comnfcrclnl independence
on the seas. c ?
8hlps of Fsscs Needed.
For it Is a question, of Independence.
If other nations go to war or seek to
hamper each other's commerce our
merchants, it seems, are at their mer
cy to do with as they please. We must
use their ships and use them as they
determine. We have not ships enough
Of our own. We cannot handle our
own commerce on the teas. ' Our Inde
pendence Is provincial, and Is only on
land and within our own borders. We
aro not likely to be permitted to use
even the ships of other nations In ri
valry of their own trade and nre with
out means to extend onr commerce
even where the doors are wide open
and onr goods desired. Such a situa
tion Is not to be eodured. It is of capi
tsl importance not only that the Unit
ed States should be Its own carrier on
the sea's and enjoy the economic Inde
pendence which oqly an adequate
merchant marine would give it,'but
also that the American hemisphere as
a whole should enjoy a like Independ
ence and self sufficiency. If It is not
to be drawn Into the tangle of Buro
