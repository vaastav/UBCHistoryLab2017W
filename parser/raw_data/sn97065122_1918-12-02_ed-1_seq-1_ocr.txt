President Declares For Modified Control
Of Nation's Railways Outlines His Re
adjustment Policies; Also Explains His
Peace Trip to Europe In His Message to
Congress This Afternoon.
(By The United Pret.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. Declaring for modified control of
the nation's railroads under unified and greater public regula
tions, President Wilson spoke out against the return to old
conditions of rail corporations in his annual message to the
joint session of congress today.
The president outlined his readjustment policies, at the same
time explaining his peace trip to Europe as one that was his
duty to make.
President Wilson's readjustment program includes the pass
age of woman suffrage, the use of existing government agencies
to effect reconstruction, the immediate resumption of the de
velopment of public works, to provide employment to the re
turning soldiers, the ratification of the Colombian treaty to
improve the pan-American relations, the immediate determina
tion of taxes for 1918 and 1919, lifting as much of the tax bur
den from business as government needs will permit; priority
of distribution of American raw materials to the war-stricken
nations; the complete consummation of the three naval pro
grams. He leaves the determination of the railroads' future
to congress, but recommends against the return to pre-war con
ditions of railroads until modified. He urges that the railroad
control question be studied by congress immediately in order
to quickly remove the doubt of their future reclamation of arid
swamp and cutover land.
The president declared he believed the final peace would
be completed; by, spring. In the meantime, he said,American
business is going ahead with its readjustments.

Senate Military, Affairs Committee
will begin an investigation tomorrow

900 Yanks, Freed,
Arrive In France
BELLEGARDE, FRANCE, Dec. 2.
Nine hundred American soldiers
arrived here today from the German
prison camp at Ullingen, by way of
Switzerland. An American hospital
train was awaiting the party, which
comprised 700 officers and 200 order
lies. Their condition was unusually
good, owing to the fact that food sup
plied to them by the American Red
Cross actually had been delivered to
them. In passing through Switzer
land on their special train, the Amer
icans were cordially greeted by the
Swiss.
WITH THE BRITISH-AMERICAN
ARMIES, Nov. 10. (Correspond
ence.) German deviltry seemed to
know no bounds in the last few days
of . the fighting on the British front
after the Hindenburg line had been
shattered. They attached grenades
to the bodies of dead Hiyis left be
hind in the Germaij retreat, so that
when the bodies were lifted the gren
ades exploded, killing or wounding
the bearers;
Near the town of Le Cateau a
number of Australian stretcher bear
ers were killed by these grenades in
attempting to remove some German
dead from the field in front of an
American machine gun position.
Thereafter no Australian would put
a hand on a dead German. In some
cases the bodies were dragged to
their burial places by means of a
long rope, which allowed the stretcher
bearers to keep out of range of any
exploding hand grenades.
The Americans, on the other hand,
hit upon the plan of making the Ger
man prisoners bury their own dead.
In one instance a boche prisoner wa.
summarily shot because he refused
to remove the body of one of hb
dead companions. An examination of
the body later led to the discovery
that it was mined. The German waf
ware of this fact, and refused to
touch it.
In one small town evacuated by
the Germans many of the beds were
found to be mined. An American
officer, tired and worn by long and
hard fighting, sought rest on a lounge
in a room previously occupied by a
German officer. The lounge blew up
and he was instantly killed.
Another officer picked up a pair
of field glasses left by the Germans
and was adjusting the focus when
the glasses exploded in his hands and
blew away a part of his face.
The Huns had become adept in the
nefarious business of making infernal
machines, mines and time fuses, and
there was scarcely an area where the
electrical and engineering experts of
the allies did not find some new form
of their fiendish ingenuity.
American Third Army Today Occupies
Square Miles of German Territory Lit
tle Hostility Encountered From the Inhabitants.
(By The United Pre...)
WITH AMERICANS IN PRUSSIA, Dec. 1. (Via Courier to
Nancy, Dec. 2.) The American Third army today occupied
four hundred square miles of German territory, including scores
of towns and villages. The Americans have encountered little
hostility from the inhabitants, while hundreds lined the streets.
At Treves there was complete silence as the tired Sixth infantry,
Fifth division, marched in and occupied the city. People stood
staring helplessly or followed quietly behind the Americans
during the march through the city. Church bells tolled, Amer
ican airplanes circled overhead. -Both the Germans and Amer
icans maintained a certain degree of aloofness; there was but
little fraternization. The doughboys maintained a soldierly,
dignified attitude.
Thirtieth Division Will Arrive
Home At Charleston Port
(By The United Pre.)
CHARLESTON, S. C, Dec. 2. Charleston is all set to give

rivalling anything of its kind in the history of the city. An

Lord Northcliffe Gives Out Statement
On President Wilson's Peace Trip
(Copyright, 1918, by the United Press.)v 1
LONDON, Dec. 2. In view of the widespread discussion re
garding President Wilson's decision to attend the peace con
ference, the United Press asked Lord Northcliffe, Great Brit
ain's greatest publisher, for a statement of the European atti
tude toward the president's personal participation in the de-'
liberations.
Responding to this special request Lord Northcliffe today
made the following statement:
"Foreigners have no right to take part in the politics of other
countries. That the president of the United States should at
tend the peace conference has always been regarded here not
as a matter of politics, but as. an essential factor in the situation.
It would be unthinkable to us, for example, that Premier Lloyd
George should, not be at the peace conferences.
"I am not in a position to speak for France, but cannot con
ceive it possible that the peace conferences should take place
without Premier Clemenceau as one 6f the French representa
tivs. "The whole discussion shows the grave danger that always
exists of international misunderstandings, ft is apparently
evident from cables we are getting that many citizens of the
United States, democrats as well as republicans, object to the
president's voyage. I can only say that we cannot comprehend
that situation.
"Britain, and her four sister nations, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand and South Africa, have had nearly 900,000 men killed.
People of all shades of opinion here realize that our head man,
Premier Lloyd George, must be at the peace conferences to
look after the interests of a nation like ours, that has suffered
so terribly.
"The United States lately has played a great part in the war,
and the Germans have consistently addressed the president.
"As a foreigner, although a warm friend of the United States,
I can express no view of American politics though, of course,
I have many views but I may be allowed to say as an expres
sion of personal opinion, that if these conferences were held
without President Wilson, the whole European world would
think there was something very wrong indeed with those conferences."
