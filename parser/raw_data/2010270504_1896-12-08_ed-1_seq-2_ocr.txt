The American eagle is not laying
golden eggs exclusively. The silver-coinage
during November was
$914,000.
The corn crop of Kansas this
year is 82,000,000 bushels above the
average yield oi the state. The
wheat crop is a little below the
average, but there has been an in
crease in the value of live stock.
This would indicate that there is
nothing wrong with Kansas but her
politics.
Senator Elkins has prepared a
bill which will be introduced early
in the session the purpose of which
is to.build up the American merch
ant marine. The bill is in response
to the following clause of llie re
publican platform: "We tavor tne
restoration of discriminating duties,
for the upholding of our merchant
marine and tor the protection of
our shipping in foreign carrying
trade."
In case of another free coinage
campaign the republicans will carry
the war into Georgia. That state in
1892 gave the democrats and popu
list combined 172,325 votes and the
republicans 48,306. At the recent
election the vote was Bryan 94,332,
McKinley 60,190. The republican
gain was 11,885 and the fusion loss
77,993. The Bryn vote in Georgia
is 36,054 less than the vote for
Cleveland alone in 1892, to say noth
ing of the 42,639 for Weaver. Free
silver has been a democratic blight
in the Empire State of the south.

The leading democrats are finally
coming to their senses. Bourke
Cockran remarked the other day
that he did propose ever again to
play the part of a tariff reformer;
and now Chairman Bynum. of the
sound money democratic organiza
tion, isays, "I would not raise any
revenue from tea, coffee and sugar,
buf from articles that compete with
American labor." That is to say,
he is no longer a free trader, nor
even an advocate of a tariff for rev
enue only, but an out-and-out pro
tectionist. These are encouraging
signs.
"THBEE TABIFF OE0UPS.
Under protective tariffs the
United States never has suffered
deficiency of revenue, but always
has had a comfortable surplus
wherewith to meet emergencies.
The tariff revenues of the last ten
years may be divided into three
groups. In 1877, the fiscal year
ending June 30, tariff duties gave a
revenue of S220.275.862; in 1888
they produced 5218,318,536; in 1889
they produced S222, 451,814; in 1890
they produced S228.807.756. Con
cerning this group, it may be said
that a large surplus called a crime
by the democrats was produced.
In 1890 the McKinley tariff was
passed, It was entitled "An act to
reduce revenue, etc" It did reduce
revenue, but it also increased
the measure of . protection to
agricultural products, and to
some of the feebler industries. The
second group comprises the rev
enues of the three years in which the
McKinley tariff was wholly or part
ially in operation. In 1891 the tariff
revenues were 219,592,436; in 1892
they were $177,336,944; in 1893 they
were $203, 142. 989. This McKinley
group represents a period of mod
erate treasury surplus, accompani ed
by a remarkable activity in all
branches of industry.
To the third group belongs the
the Wilson-Gorman tariff-for-rev-enue
returns. In 1894 which falls
partly within the democratic tariff
the reyevenue from duties was
5131,808,758; in 1895 it was $151,
7,558; in 1896 it was $161,000,000.
During these years there have been
continued deficits, frequent foreign
loans to replenish our empty treas
ury, stagnation of all industries,
commercial panic, and individual
suffering. Inter Ocean.

is the president's annual message as
read to congress today:
To the Congress of the United States :
As representatives of the people in the
legislative branch of their government,
you have assembled at a time when the
Btrength and excellence of our free insti
tutions and tho fitness of our citizens to
enjoy popular rule have been again made
manifest. A political contest, involving
momentous consequences, fraught with
feverish apprehension, and creating ag
gressiveness so intense as to approachbittcr
ness and passion, has been waged through
out our land, and determined by the de
cree of free and independent suffrage
without disturbance of our tranquillity or
the least sign of weakness in our national
structure. When we consider these inci
dents and contemplate the peaceful obedi
ence and manly submission which have
succeeded a heated clash of political opin
ions, we discover abundant evidence of a
determination on tho part of our country
men to abide bv every verdict of the popu
lar will,and to "be controlled atall times by
an abiding faith in the agencies estab
lished for the direction of tho affairs of
their government. Thus our people ex
hibit a patriotic disposition, which entitles
them to demand of those who undertake
to make and execute their laws such faith
ful and unselfish service in their behalf as
can only be prompted by a serious appre
ciation of the trust and confidence which
the acceptance of public duty invites.
In obedience to a constitutional require
ment I hereby submit to the congress cer
tain information concerning national af
fairs, with the suggestion of such legisla
tion as in my judgment is necessary and
expedient. To secure brevity and
avoid tiresome narration I shall omit
many details concerning matters within
federal control, which by no means unim
portant, arc more profitably discussed in
departmental reports. I shall also further
curtail this communication by omitting a
minute recital of many minor incidents
connected with our foreign relations which
have heretofore found a place in executive
messages, but are now contained in a re
port of -the secretary
of state, which is
herewith submitted.
The Turkish Troubles.
At the outset of a reference to tho more
important matters affecting our relations
with foreign powers, it would afford mo
satisfaction if I could assure the congress
that the disturbed condition in Asiatic
Turkev had during the past year assumed
a less hideous and bloody aspect, and that
either as a consequence of the awakening
of the Turkish government to the demand
of humane civilization, or as tho result of.
decisive action on the part of the great na
tions having the right by treaty to inter
fere for the protection of those exposed to
the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fanati
cism, the shocking features of the situa
tion had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a soft
ened disposition or protective intervention,
we have been afflicted by continued and
not unfrequent reports of the wanton de
struction of homes and tho bloody butch
ery of men, women and children, made
martyrs to their profession of Christian
faith.
"While none of our citizens in Turkey
have thus far been killed or wounded,
though often in tho midst of dreadful
scenes of danger, their safety in the future
is by no means assured. Our government
attibmc and our minister at Constanti
nople have left nothing undone to protect
our missionaries in Ottoman -territory,
who constitute nearly all the individuals
residing there who have a right to claim
our protection on the score of American
citizenship.
Our efforts in this direction will not be
relaxed; but the deep feeling and sym
pathv that have lieen aroused among our
people ought not to so far blind their rea
son and judgment as to lead them to de
mand impossible things. The outbreaks
of blind fury which lead to murder and
pillage in Turkey occur suddenly and
without notice, and an attempt on our
part to force such a hostile presence there
as might be effective for prevention or
protection, would not only be resisted by
the Ottoman government, but would be
regarded as an interruption of their plans
by the great nations who assert their ex
clusive right to intervene in their own
time and method for the security of life
and property in Turkey,
Several naval vessels are -stationed in the
Mediterranean us a measure of cow tion and
to furnish all possible relief and refuge in
case of emergency. We iuive made claims
against the Turkish government for the
hi .1 .1 x :
pillage aim uusuruutum ui xiussjuunr'
property at Harpool and Marash. during
uprisings at those places. Thus far tho
validity of these demands has not been
admitted, though our minister, prior to
such outrages and Jn anticipation of dan
ger, demanded protection for the persons
and property of our missionary citizens in
the localities mentioned, and notwith
standing that strong evidence exists of
actual complicity of Turkish soldiers in
the work of destruction and robbery.
The facts as they now appear do not per
mit us to douln; the justice of these claims,
and nothing will bo omitted to bring about
their prompt settlement,
A number of Armenian refugees having
arrived at our ports,an order Jias lately been
obtained from the Turkish government
permitting the wives and children of such
refugees" to join them here. It is hoped
that hereafter no obstacles will be inter
posed to prevent tho escape of all those
who seek to avoid the perils which threaten
them in tho Turkish dominions.
I do not believe that the present somber
prospect in Turkey will be permitted to
offend the sight of Christendom. It so

tion that. beJongs to the close of the nine
teenth century rhitfdt .seems hardly possi
ble that the earnest aonwi.d.9 -good people

rective treatment will remain jinan
swered. The War in Cuba.
The insurrection in Cuba still continues
with all its perplexities. It is difficult to
perceive that any progress has thus far
been made towards tho pacification of the
island, or that tho situation of affairs as
depicted in my last annual message has in
tho least improved. If Spain still holds
Havana and tho seaports and all tho con
siderable towns, tho insurgents still roam
at will over at least two-thirds of the coun
try. If the determination of Spain to put
down tho insurrection seems but to
strengthen with the lapse of time, and is
evinced by her unhesitating devotion of
largely increased military and naval forces
to the task, there is much reason to
believe .that the insurgents have gained
in point of numbers and character and
resources, and are none flic Jess inflexible
in their resolve not to succumb without
practically securing tho great object for
which they took up arms. If Spain has
not yet re-established hor authority,
neither have the insurgents yet made gooa
their title to be regarded as on independ
ent state. Indeed, as the contest hw gone
on. tho pretense that civil government
exists on ths island, except so far as Spam
is able to maintain it, has been practic
ally abandoned. Spain does keep on foot
such a government, more or less imper
fectly, in the large towns and their im
mediate suburbs. But, that exception
being made, tho entire country is cither
given over to anarchy or is subject to the
military occupation of one or tho other
party. It is reported, indeed, on reliable
authority, that at the demand of tho com-juander-in
chief of tho insurgent army,
the putative Cuban government has now
gjlven njall 4. tempt to exercise its func
tions, leaving the government confessedly
what there is the best reason for suppos
ing it always to have Ihtea jn fact) a gov
ernment merely on paper. "$yerc the
Spanish armies able to meet their an
tagonists in tho open or in pitched battle,
prompt and decisive results might bo
looked, for, and the immense superiority
of tho Spanish forces in numbers, disci-
J'llino and equipment could "haruly
ail to tell greatly to their advantage,
but they are called upon to face a foe that
shuns general engagements; that can
choose and does chooso its own ground;
that, from the nature of tho country, is
visible or invisible at pleasure, and that
fights only from ambuscade and when all
the advantages of position and numbers
are on its side. In a .country where all
that is indispensable to life in the way of
food, clothing and shelter is so easily ob
tained especially by those born and bred
on the soil, it is obvious that there is hard
ly a limit to tho time during which hos
tilities of this sort may bo prolonged.
Meanwhile, in ajl cases of protracted civil
strife the passions of the combatants grow
more and more inflamed and excesses on
both sides become morefrequentand more
de?he are also participated in by bands
of marauders, who, now in the name of
one party and now in tho name of the
other, as may best suit the occasion, harry
the countrv at will and plunder its
wretched inhabitants for their own advan
tage. Such r condition of things would
inevitably entail immense destruction of
property, even if it were tho policy of both
parties to prevent it as far as practicable.
Bnt while such seemed to be the original
policy of tho Spanish government, it has
now apparently abandoned it and is act
ing upon the same theory as the insurg
ents, namely, that tho exigencies of the
contest require the wholesale annihilation
of property, that it may not prove of use or
advantage to the enemy.
It is to the same end that in pursuance
of general orders, Spanish garrisons are
now being withdrawn from plantations
and the rural population required to con
centrate itself in tho towns. The sure
result would seem to be that tho industrial
value of the island is fast diminishing, and
that unless there is a speedy and radical
change in existing conditions, it will soon
disappear altogether. That value consists
very largclv, of course, in its capacity to
produce sugar a capacity already much
reduced by tho interruptions to tillage,
which""have taken place during the last
two vcars. It is reliably asserted that
should these interruptions continue dur
ing the current year, and practically, ex
tend, as is now threatened, to the entire
sugar producing territory of the island, so
much time and so much money will bo re
quired to restore the land to its normal
productiveness that it is extremely doubt
ful if capital can be induced to even make
the attempt. The spectacle of tho utter
ruin of an adjoining country, by nature
one of the most fertile and charming on
the globe, would engage the serious atten
tion of the government and the people of
tho United States in any circumstances. In
point of fact, they have a concern with it
which is by no means of n wholly senti
mental "or philanthropical character.
It lies so near to ns as to bo
hardly separated from our territory.
Our actual pecuniary interest in it is only
second to that of the people and govern
ment of Spain. It is reasonably estimated
that at least from $30,000,000 to 50,000,000
of American capital arc invested in planta
tions and in railroad, mining anf pthcr
business enterprises on the island.. Tho
volume of trade between the United States
and Cuba, which in 18S9 amounted to
about $04,000,000,' rose in 1893 to about
$103,000,000, and in 1894, the year before
the present insurrection broke out,
amounted to nearly $9(5,000,000. Besides
this large pecuniary stake in the fortunes
of Cuba, the United States finds itself in
extricably involved in the present contest
in other ways both vexatious and costly.
Many Cubans reside in this country and
indirectly promote the insurrection
through the press, by public meetings, by
the purchase and shipment of arms, by the
raising of funds, and by other means,
which the spirit of our institutions and the
tenor of our laws do not permit tobemado
thesubjcct.of criminal prosecutions. Some
of them, though Cubans at heart and in
all their feelings and interests, have taken
out papers as naturalized citizens of the
United States, a proceeding resorted to
with a view to possible protection by this
government and not xumaturally regarded
with much indignation by the coun
try of their origin. The insurgents
are undoubtedly encouraged and
supported the widespread
sympathy the people of fhis country al
ways and instinctively feel fov every strug
gle for better and freer government and
which, in the case of the more adventur
ous and restless elements of our popula
tion, leads in only too many instancos to
active and personal participation in the
contest.
Tho result is that this government is
constantly called upon to protect Ameri
can citizens, to claim damages for injuries
to persons and property now estimated at
many millions of doftars and to ask ex
planations and apologios or .the acts of

sion of rebellion sometimes blinds them to j

ing citizens of a friendly power. It fol
lows from the same caused that the United
States Is compelled to actively police a
long line of sea coast against unlawful ex
peditions, the escape of which the utmost
vigilance will not always suffice to pre
vent. These inevitable entanglements of
the United States with the rebellion in
Cuba, the large American property inter
ests affected, and considerations of philan
thropy and humanity in general, have led
to a vehement demand in various quarters
for wjnie sort of positive intervention
on the part of the United States..
It was at lirst proposed that belligerent
rights should beadcordedihe insurgents
a proposition no longer .weighed because
untimely ;wd in practical operation" clear
ly perilous and injurious to our own inter
ests. It lias sinco been and jsnow some
times contended that thp independence Of
the insurgents should be recognized, But
imperfect and restricted aa the Spanish
government of the island may bo, no
other exists there unless tho will of tho
military officer 4n temporary command of
a particular district can ba dignified as a
species of government. ' It is now also sug
gested that th United States shoujd buy
the island A suggestion possibjy worthy
of consideration if there were ai)F cyidcn.ee
of a desire or willingness on the part fit
Spain to entertain such ft proposai. It js
urged, finally, that, all other methojs fail

should bo terminated by our intervention

States and Spain a war which its advo
cates confidently prophesy could bo nejthnr

The correctness of this forecast need be
neither affirmed nor donied. The United
States has nevertheless a character to
maintain as a nation, which plainly dic
tates that right and not might should be
the rule of its conduct.

longings for territory, preclude all dreams

towards Spain and her dominions has con
stituted no exception to this natiqna". dis
position, is maflo manifest 17 the course
of our government, not only Pius ir tlur"
ing tho present insurrection, but during
the ten vcars that followed the rising at
Tura in 18(8. Xo other great power, it
may safely be said, undop circumstances
of similar iwrplcxity, would have mani
fested the same restraint and the same pa
tient endurance. It may also be said that
this persistent attitude of the United
States towards Spain in connection with
Cuba, unquestionably evinces no slight
respect mil regard for Spain on tho part
of tho American people. They, in truth,
do not forget hur connection with tho dis
coverv of the wpsterji'-iivTisphere, nor do
jfchoy underestimate the1 great'auwiftes of
the Spayijsh people, nor fail to fully rceog
nize their splemljcj patriotisip. and their
chivalrous devotion to tW Rational honor.
They view with bonder' and wjmjration
the cheerful resolution itlj which, jvast
bodies of men arc sent ucross thousands of
miles of ocean and an enormous (lebfc ac
cumulated that the costly possession of tho
gem of tho Antilles may still hold its
place in tho Spanish crown. And ypt
neither the government nor tho people in
the United States have shut thoir eyes to
the course of events in Cuba or have failed
to realize the extent of conceded griev
ances which have led to tho present revolt
from the authority of Spam grievances
recognized bv tho queen regent and by tho
cortes, voiced by tho mostpatriotic and en--lightened
of Spanish statesmen without
fpgard to party, and demonstrated bv re
forms proposed by the executive and ap
proved by the egi$Jativo branch of tho
Sawnlsh KOTomroeDt. 'Ifc'is in-ihe assumed
temper aud disposition of the Spanish gov
ernment to remedy these grievances, forti
fied by indications of influential public
opinion in Spain.that this government has
hoped to discover the most promising and
effective means of composing the present
strife, with honor and advantage to Spain
and with the achievement of all reasonable
objects of the insurrection.
Home Kulo Suggested.
It would seem that if Spain should offer
to Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of
home rule which, while preserving the
sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy all
rational requirements of her Spanish sub
jects, there should bo no just reason why
the pacification of the island might not bo
effected on that basis. Such a result
would appear to be in tho true interest of
all concerned. It would at once stop the
conflict which is now consuming the re
sources of the island and making it worth
less for whichever party may ultimately
prevail. It would keep intact the posses
sions of Spain without touching her honor,
which will be consulted rather than im
pugned by tho adequate redress of ad
mitted, grievances.
It would put the prosperity of the island
and the fortunes of its inhabitants within
their own control without severing tho
natural and ancient ties which bind them
to the mother country, and would yet cn
ablo them to test their capacity for self
fovernmcnt undor tho most favorable con
itions. It has been objected on the ono
side that Spain should not promise au
tonomy until her insurgent subjects lay
down their arms; on tho other side,
that promised autonomy, however lib
eral, is unsufficicnt, because without
assurance of the promise being fulfilled
but the reasonableness of a requirement
by Spain of unconditional surrender on
the part of tho insurgent Cubans before
their autonomy is conceded, is not alto
gether apparent. It ignores important
features of the situation tho stability two
years' duration has given to the insurrec
tion; the feasibility of its indefinite pro
longation in the nature of things and, as
shown by past experience, the utter and
imminent ruin of tho island unless tho
present strife is speedily composed; above
all, the rank abuses which all parties in
Spain, all branches of her government,
and all her leading public men concede to
exist and profess a desire to remove. Fac
ing such circumstances, to withhold the
Sroffer of needed reforms until the parties
omanding thoni put themselves at their
mercy by throwing down their arms has
the appearance of neglecting tho gravest
of perils and inviting suspicion as to tho
sincerity of any professed willingness to
grant reforms. Tho objection on behalf
of the insurgents that promised reforms
cannot be relied upon must, of cowvs -;,
be considered, though we have no right to
assume and no reasqij for assuming that
invthing Spain .undertakes to do for the
relief of Cuba will not be done according
to both the spirij; ajid tbo letter of tho un
dertaking. Nevertheless realizing that suspicions
and precautions on the part of thp weaker
of tho two combatants are always iiatiiraj
and not always unjustifiable being sin
cerely desirous in the interest of both as
well as on its own account that tho Cuban
problem should be solved with the least
possible delay it was intimated by this
government to the government of Spain
some months ago that, if a satisfactory
measuro of home rule were tendered the
Cuban insurgents, and would be accepted
by them upon a guarantee of its execu
tion, the United States would endeavor to
find a way not objectionable to Spain of
furnishing such guaranty.
While no definite responso to this
intimation has yet been received from
tho Spanish government, it is believed to
be not altogether unwelcome, while as al
ready suggested, po reason is perceived
why it should not be approved by the in
surgents. Neither party can fail to sec
the importance of early action and both
nmst realize that po prolong the present
state of things for even ahqrt period, will
add enormously to tho' time and jlabor and
expenditure necessary p) bring' aliqut 'the
industrial recuperation of the island. lib
is therefore fervently hoped oijill grounds
that earnest offorts for healing fjlP
breach between Spain and the insurgent
Cubans upon the linen above indicated,
may be at once inaugurated and pushed to
an immediate and successful issuo. The
friendly offices of the United States, cither
in the manner above outlined, or in any
Other way consistent with our constitu
tion and Jlws, will always bo at the dis
posal of either part'.
Whatever circumstances may irsQ. qin
policy and our interest would constrain us
to object to the acquisition of the island or
an interference with its control by any
other power.
It should bo added that it can not be
reasonably assumed that the hitherto ex-
E octant attitude of the United States will
c indeflnitelv maintained. While wo are
anxious to accord all due respect to tho
sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view the
pendingconflict in all its features and
properly apprehend our inevitably cioso
relations to it and its possible results,
without'considcrlng that by the course 0
events we may be drawn into such an 71ft
usiiai' 'ajid unprecedented condition, tij
wili'fix'a limit tq our patient waiting f0,jf
Spajn to end the contest, either olouV auij
in hoi" 0W.n way, or wth- our friendly
operation.
When the inability of Spain tq deal suc
cessfully with the insurgent' lias becqnip
manifest, and it is demonstrated thli Ufir
sovereignty is extinct in Cuki for all pur
poses of its rightful existence, and when a
hopeless struggle for its re-establishment

,nothing more than tho useless icr!fico of

Deferring the ohoico of yaysfnd meth
ods until the time for action arrives, we
should make them depend upon the precise
conditions then existing; and they should
iibii be determined upon without giving
parcful Heed to oyory consideration in--yolving
our honor add: interest, or the in

a contemplation Of' emergencies that may
arise should lead UH to avoid tlieir crea

have deemed it not amiss to remind tho
congress that a time may arrive when a

nations and their cltlzojiH joined by con

$369,757,470, and the value of free goods
imported, $409,967,470, being an increase of
$6,523,675 in the value of dutiable goods
and 41,231,034 in the value of free goods
over the preceding year. Our exports of
merchandise, foreign and domestic,
amounted in valnc to $SS2,608,938, being
an increase over the preceding year of $75,

525,065 and of silver $28,777,186, being $2,
859,695 less of gold and $8,566,007 more of
silver than during the preceding year. The
total stock of metallic money in the United
States at the olose of tho last fiscal year
ended, on the oOth day of June, 1896, was
$1,228,320,035, of which $599,597,964 was in

Ing the calendar year 1895 is oatimated to
have been 2,251,760 fine ounces of gold of
thoValuo of $46,610,000, and 55,727,000 fine
ounces of silver of tho commercial value
of $36,445,000 and the coinage value of $72,

and 169,1S9,249 fine ounces of silver, of tho
commercial value of $110,654,000, and of
tho coinage value of $218,738,100 according
to our ratio.
The coinage of these metals in tho vari

calendar year amounted to $232,701,438 in
gold and 121,996,219 in silver.
The total coinage at the mints of the

Circulating notes, amounting to $21,412,620.
The tota outstanding circulating notes of
all national bapks on the 3 1st day of Octo

culation during the year ending on that
day was $21,099,429. On October (5, 185)6,
when the condition of national tanks was
last reported, the total resources of the
8.679 active institutions was $3,263,($85,'1 13.

There were organized during tho year
preceding the date last mentioned 28 na

12' were organized in the eastern states,
with if capital qf .1,180,000; six in the west

l0 in the' quthern states, with 11 '.capital of
$1,15)0,000. Uurihg the year, however, 30
banks voluntarily absiudoncd their fran

"TiiriffSuKSestionst.
.Itecurring again, to the statistics of the
treasury department, tho president offers
sonic suggestions regarding the present
a,v and its operation. Ho says: This stat
ute took effect on the 28th day of August,
J85J4, Whatover may bo Jts shortcomings
urt u complete measure of tariff reform, it
.must be conceded that it has opened "the
way to a freer and greater exchange of
commodities between us and other coun
tries, and thus furnished a wider market
for our products and manufactures. Tho
pnjr entire fiscal year during which this
laVs? has lifton in force-ended on the 30th day
of June, 185MJ. ' In tha,yJP '-"!r imports
increased over those of the previous year
more than $6,500,000, while tho value of
the domestic products we exported and
Mrnich fwinu markets abroad was nearly
7o,000,t)00 more'than during fan preceding
year. ' ......, ... ,
Those who insist that the cost to our
people of articles coming tq them from
abroad for their needf uj use should only
be increased through tariff charges to an
extent necessary to meet the" expenses o
f "9 government, as well as those who
claim that tariff charges niay be laid upon
such articles ocyonu tne necessities, w guy
prnmcnt revenue, and with the additional
pifrPQSG of SO increasing their price in our
jnarkets as te give American nianiifac
turers and producers jMJttei' and pioro
profitable opportunities, must agree that
flP n milt iiHnmrllv fustifi od
as sources of revenue to enable tho govern'
onentr to niece the necessary expenses of its
inaintcnance. Considered as to itssuili-
bicncy'in this aspect, the present law can
by no means fall Under gust condemna
tion,; During the only -cohiplete fiscal
vearofits oneratidn it has" yielded nearly
$8,000,000 more revenue thari was received
Jherp was, nevertheless', a ifcficp; between
our receipts ana expenditures 01 a nuio
more than $25,000,000." TJjjs, however, was
not unexpected.
The situation was such in December,
seven, months before the close of the fiscal
year, that the secretary of tho treasury
"foretold a deficiency of 17,000,000. Tho
great and increasing opprohension and
timidity in business jcirclcs and the depre-
1
slon in an activities intervening !mce"That
time, resulting from causes perfectly well
! understood and entirely disconnected with
' our tariff law or its operation, seriously
' checked the imports we would have othcr
j wise received and readily account for tho
! difference between this estimate of tho
secretary and the actual deficiency, as well
as for a continued deficit. Indeed, it
must be confessed that wo could hardly
have had a more unfavorable period than
the last two years for the collection of
tariff revenue. We cannot reasonably
bopo that our recuperation from this busi
ness depression will be sudden, but it has
already set in, with a promiso of accclera-
J tion and continuance. I believe our pres
ent tariff law, if allowed a fair oppor
tunity, willj in the near future, yield a
revenue which, with reasonable econom
ical expenditures, will overcome all de-
I ficiencies. In the lncantimo no deficit that
I has occurred or may occur need excite or
j disturb us.
I To meet any such deficit we "have in tho
treasury, in addition to a gold reserve,
; $100,000,000, a surplus of more than $12S,
. 000,000 applicable to the payment of tho ex
i penscs of the government, and which
' inustj unless expended for that purpose,
1 remain a useless hoard, or, if not extrava
j gantry wasted, must in any event be per-
verted from the purpose of its exaction
i from our people. The payment therefore,
! of any deficiency in the revenue from this
J fund is nothing more than its proper and
legitimate use.
The ffovernmcnt thus annlvin s a surolus
fortunately in its treasury to the payment
of expenses not met in its current revenues,
is not at all likened to a man living beyond
Ins income and thus incurring debt or en
croaching on his principal. It is not one
of the functions of our government to ac
cumulate and make additions to a fund
not needed for immediate expenditure.
With individuals it is the chief object of
struggle and effort. The application of
an accummulated fund by the gov
ernment to tho payment of its
running expenses is a duty.
LAn individual living beyond his income
and embarrassing himself with debt or
drawing upon his accumulated fund of
principal is either unfortunate or improv
ident. Tho distinction is between a gov
ornment charged with tho duty of expend
ing for tho benefit of tho people and for
iroper purposes all the money it receives
rom any source and the individual who is
expected to manifest a natural desire to
avoid debt or to accumulate as much as
possible and to livo within tho income de
rived from such accumulations to tho end
that they may bo increased, or at least re
main unimpaired, for tho future use and
enjoyment of himself and the object of his
love and affection who may survive him.
It is immeasurably better to appropriate
our surplus to the payment of justifiable
expenses than to allow it to becomo an
invitation to reckless appropriations and
extravagant expenditures. I suppose it
will not be denied that under the present
law our people obtain the necessaries of a
comfortable existence at a cheaper rate
than formerly. This is a matter of su
preme importance sinco it is tho palpable
duty of every just government to pinko
the burden of taxation as light as possible.
The people should not be required to relin
quish this privilege of cheap living except
tthder the stress of their governments nec
essarily made plainly manifest.
Currency ICefonu Ursetl.
This reference to tho condition' and pros
pects of our revenues naturally suggests
:n allusion to the weakness and vices of
our financial methods. They have been
frequently pressed upon tho attention of
congress in previous executive communi
cations, and the inevitable danger of their
continued toleration pointed out. With
out now repeating these details, I cannot
refrain from again earnestly presenting
the necessity of the prompt reform of a
system opposed to every rulo of sound
finance and shown by experience to be
fraught with tho gravest peril and per
plexity. The terrible civil war, which :
shook tho foundations of our government
more than thirty years ago, brought in it?
train the destruction of property, the
wasting of our country's substance and
the estrangement of brethren. These are 1
pdw past and 'forgotten. Even the dis
tressing loss of life the conflict entailed is
bjit a sacred memory which fosters patri
otic Sentiment aud keeps alive a tender re
gard for those who nobly died. And yet
Flierc remains with us today, in full
"strength and activity, as an incident of
that trpniepdous struggle, a feature of its
financial necessities, not only urisuited to
our present circumstances, but manifestly
a disturbing menace to business security
ivpd an ever present agent of monetary
distress.
Because we may be en joying a tempora-
ry relief from its depressing influence
tliis should not lull us into a false security
jior lead us to forget the suddonness of
past visitation, I am more convinced
than ever that wo can havp no assured
financial peace and safety until the gov
ernment currency obligations upon which -I
goiu may ho uemanueit irom tne treasury
are withdrawn from circulation and can-.
celled. This might bo done, as has been .
heretofore recommended, but their ex
change for long term bonds bearing a low'

Tare 01 micresc or uy ineir ruueuxxuioa
with the proceeds of such tands.
"' Even if only tho United States notes'
known as greentacks were thus retired,
!t is possible that the treasury notes issued
n payment of silver purchases under tho
act of July "14, 18510", now paid jij gold when
'demanded, would nqt create much disturb
ance fis they might from time to time
whon received in tho treasury bv redenrn-
tion in gold qf otherwjso, be ' gradual lyN
and prudently replaced by silver com.
This plan of issuing bonds for the pur-
Eoso of redemption certainly appears to
e tho most effectivo und direct path to the
needed reform.
In default of this, however, it would be
a step in the right direction if currency
obllgations redeemable in gold, whenever
eo redeemed, should be cancelled, instead
of being re-issued. This operation would
be a-slow remedy, but it would improve
present conditions.
National tanks 'should redcom their own
notes. They should le allowed to issue
circulation to the par value of bonds de
posited as security for its redemption, and i
the tax on their circulation be reduced to '
14 1 per cent.
,:In 'considering projects for the retire
ment of United notes and treasury notes

ppinjqn, that we have placed too much
stress "upon tho danger of pqntiiicting the

gated to the level of a mere appurtenance
to a great machine, with little free will,
with no duty but that of passive obedience
and with little hope or opportunity of ris
ing in the scale of responsible and health
ful citizenship. To tho instinctive belief
that such is the inevitable trend of trusts
and monopolies is due the widespread and
deep-seated popular aversion in which they
arenMd and the not unreasonable insis
tence that, whatever maybe their inci
dental economic advantages, their general
effect upon personal character, prospects
and usefulness cannot be otherwise than
injurious. ,
Though congress has attempted to deal
with this matter by legislation, the laws
passed for that purpose thus far have
proved ineffective, not because of any lack
of disposition or attempt to enforce them,
but simply because tho laws themselves,
as interpreted bv the courts, do not reach
the difficulty. If the insufficiencies of ex
isting laws can be remedied by further
legislation it should be done. It should
be recognized, however, that .all legisla
tion on this subject may fall short of its
purpose because of inherent obstacles, and
also because of tho complex character of
our governmental system, which, while
making tho federal authority supremo
within its sphere, has carefully limited
that sphere by bounds which cannot bo.
transgressed. The decision of our highest
court on this precise question renders it
quite doubtful whether the evils of trusts
and monopolies can be adequately treated
through federal action, unless they seek
directly and purposely to include in their
object transportation or intercourse ba
tween states, or between tho United States
and foreign countries.
It does not follow, however, that this i3
the limit of tho remedy that may be ap-
filied. Even though it may bo found that
edcral authority is not broad enough to
fullv reach the case, there can bo no doubt
of the power of the several states to act ef
fectively in the premises, and there should
be no reason to doubt their willingness to
judiciously exercise such power.
In concluding this communication, its
last words shall be an appeal to tho con
gress for the most rigid economy in tho
expenditure of the money it holds in trust
for tho people. Tho way to perplexing
extravagance is easy, but a return to fru
gality is difficult. When, however, it is
considered that theso who bear tho bur
dons of taxation have no guaranty of honest
care save in the fidelity of their publio
servants tho duty of all possible retrench
ment is plainly manifest. When our differ
ences are forgotten and our contests of
Colitical opinion jire no longer reniem
cred, nothing in tho retrospect of our
public servico will be as fortunate and
comforting as tho recollection of official
duty well performed and the memory of a
constant devotion to the interests 01 our
conflding fellow countrymen.
