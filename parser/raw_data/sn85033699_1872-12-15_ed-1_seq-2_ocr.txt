CLUXS or SOUTH ERK MT4LISTS.
The second annual report of ths Com
mission lo examine and report on the
Southern War Claims should be read by all
who wish to note one of the phases of the
late contest between the sections. From
an abstract of this report, which has found
its way into print, it appears that from
ilarcb, 18T1, the date of the organizition
of the Commission, to Nov. 30, 1872, the
number of claims filed was 17,700 in
which an aggregate of over $43,000,000
was claimed. Of these, 2,788 cases, rep
'resenting 5,424,314 a3 claimed, have teen
disposed of by awards amounliug altogeth
er to about S1,13S,000. About 700 cases,
claiming $2,500,000, have been Investigated
and are under further consideration, the
claims appearing meritorious, but the proofs
Insufficient on which to framo just awards.
This will leavo about 16,000 untouched
cases, amounting to some $37,000,000,
when the commission expires by law, next
March. The claims now reported embrace
345 from Alabama, in which 355,000 are
claimed and 91,000 allowed; 184 from Ar
kansas, in which $210,000 are claimed and
$64,000 allowed; 3 from Florida, in which
$5,800 are claimed and $1,200 allowed; 174
from GeorgU., in which $307,000 ara claimed
and $40,000 illowed; 27 from Louisiana, in
which $711,000 are claimed and $155,000
aiiowed; 212 from Mississippi, In which
$421,000 are claimed and $107,000 al
lowed; 272 from North Carolina, iu
which $234,000 are claimed and $40,000.
allowed; 41 from South Carolina, in which
$71,000 are claimed aud 1S,500 allowed;
397 from Tennessee, in which $3S0,000 are
claimed and $78,000 allowed; 8 from Texas,
in which $14 000 are claimed and $3,300
allowed; and 545 from Virginia, in which
$1,000,000 are claimed and $180,000 allow
ed. It is quite certain that all the claims
will not be disposed or when the official
life of the Commission expires, in March,
1873. The Commissioners think it would
take four years to do full justice to the
subject, and even then many of the cases
would have to be hurried through without
due investigation; and it is, therefore,highiy
probable the Commission will be continued.
They say all kinds of claims are nude; that
some rett upon substantial grouuds and
should be paid, but that there are hundreds
of suspicious cases, manufactured claims,
doctored charges, indirect attacas upon
the treasury. These are supported by ev
idence carefully selected to meet a certain
view of the case, and urged wiili zeal, in
dustry and periiii.C!ty. The principal iw
gradients of this civ a of c.'ss are, rent
for houses and lands occupied by the
United States forces, loss of estimated
profits, money that might have been made,
but was not, and damages occasioned ly
the acts of parsons whoso political or sec
tional affiiliatinn it is hard to determine.
These claims are gjnerally gAupby per
sons who ire prepared for emergencies, and
have tho proof iKcossary lo establish their
points. They are genaraily adepts in
the matter of "doctoring"' such claims, and
they find no scarcity of men who ure
willing to assume tho position of claimants
for one-half the proceeds. An effort will
be made to continue the Commission.
Such a movement will be advocated on the
ground that the claimants have r. light U
ba heard, no matter how much time it take;
and opposed because whilo the Commisilon
is in existence fresh claims will be constant
ly rising to the surface, as they will while
the country is blessed with a class of men
who make their money by their wits.
THE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION.
The proposition for a great Exposition to
ba held in Philadelphia during 3eveial
months of the year 1S73, tho hundredth
anniversary of American Indopandence, ap
pears to drag rather heavily. The ten mil
lions of stock necessary to get up this grand
display, and which wa3 apportioned among
the several States, is not taken up with
anything like the avidity tho projectors of
the enterpriso contemplated. The reports
submitted to tho Centennial Committee in
session in Philadelphia a few days ago, ex
posed a lukewarmues8 for which the friends
of the enterprise were wholly unprepared,
and the New York Tribune regards
the prospects as black enough,
if these reports are to be taken as an index
of its probable success. Sixteen of tho
States, says that paper, turned their backs
and made no reply whatever to the demand
upon them for tubscriptiens, among which
were the newest Western and oldest South
ern States. Half a dozen plead poverty, in
which dolorous company we confess we
were surprised to find Texas. Ohio prom
ised to come up lo her duty, but meant to
lake her time to it. Vermont, with the
quiet dignity becoming a respectable per
son of family, usnres us that she has
ample means and intends to use
them; Litie lt!irde Island asserted
herself rich enough and willing enough,
but ignorant of the whole matter; Connec
ticut, ditto; California was not only igto
raut but indifferent ; Maine would accept
her full share; so would Michigan if her
wealthy citizens had time given to them;
Virginia felt hersrlf patriotic io spirit but
poor in pocket; West Virginia gallantly
sent aaswer that sho would do her -best;
Iowa was ready to come up to tho maik,
provided she conld do it in corn. But the
true old revoluM r!3ry ring, oddly euough
came from Oregon, who, "would not only
take her shares nd psy for in coin," hut
scorned compensation "for her agents, in
suchji matter." Whilo on the other side,
New Jersey aught perhaps be brought to
the starting point for tbo raco if well coax
ed and patted. Pennsylvania finally throws
herself into the breach with an otter to take
all the slock sssigucd to her aud all that
may remain unsubscribed at the end of'a
hundred days. Tho chlvalric determina
tion of the old Keystone, to make heist If
not only keystone hut base and summit of
the whole arch, would throw tho other
Statos into a shameful back-ground if the
reason for their lukewarmnoss was not ap
parent in the reply of New York, who,
with characteristic frankness, declared her
intention of shoving the weight of tho un
dertaking where it belonged on to tho
shoulders of the General Government.
"ACCEPT THE SITUATION!"
There Is no'onewh'o had arrived at man's
estate and was a citizen of the United
States prior to tho war, that has not been
startled by the imperial edicts which havo
been issued from the Executive Mansion at
Washington relative to tho contests ?oing
oa in Louisiana and Alabama. The Presi
dent of the United States assumes to de
termine which Is Ihe legitimate State Gov
ernment upon a hearing from one side,
and straightway declares through his
law officer that Gov.- Pinch
back is recognized "the lawful Execu
tive of Louisiana, and tho body assembled
at tho Mechanics' Institute as tho lawful
Legislature.51 This law officer goes further
and suggests to tho Pinchback Executive
that he make proclamation and set forth
this recognition of the Executive authority
at Washington, and also thst all necessary
assistance will bo given to Ihe Pinchback
Legislature and Governor. I3e
if 'remembered, too, that this ukase
omes in despite of tho protest
the contesting Governor and hundreds
tho best citizens of tho State, who have
Eskod only for a hearing. There may ba
those alive who remember or have heard
something of tho case of tho Cherokee In
dians and the State "of Georgia, in which
that Slate denied the authority of the Su
preme Court of the United States to adju
dicate its rights, aud the Supremo Court;
after full argument against the State, deci
ded that the position takeu by tho Governor
of Georgia was right.
Wherffdoes the President of the United
Stales get the power which he so peremp
torily exercises? It certainly is not to ba
found in the Constitution. That instru
ment says "the United States" shall guar
antee to every State a republican form of
Government, and,- shall in certain contin
gencies protect each of them against do
mestic violence. But the President and
tha Attorney General are not the United
States. The powers of the President are
verv clearlv defined. Ho shall ba
Commander-in-chief of the Army and
Navy; ho may require the written
opinion of the heads of depart
ments; he may reprieve and pardon
he may make treaties with consent of the
Senate; he may appoint to office with the
consent of the Sauate, etc But it is no
where given to him to decido a contested
election between candida'es for Governor,
or to determine the legitimacy or illegiti
macy of the election returns for a State Leg
islature. Suppose Jeffarson, Monroe, Mad
ison, or Andrew Jackson had undertaken
to decide what Gen. Grant so promptly
disposes of. Either one of them would
ha7e had articles of impeachment present
ed within twenty-four hours, and been de
posed within less than thirty days. Now,
the only response we hear is that
we must "accept thesituation." TJhare
must be no criticism, especially from the
South, of the principles, policy and prac
tices of this Federal administration, or we
will b3 denounced as a Bourbon who favors
secession, who is unwilling to be national
ized and have a rehabilitation of the South
Popular sentiment must be suppressed, the
Press must be silenced, or it will be evi
dence conclusive that tin Sonth refuses lo
"accapt tho situation." If we attempt to stay
the march of imperialism and point to the
constitution and reproduce the republican
doctrines of tbe ablest of the founders of the
Union, wo are charged with being guilty of
"sterile agitation," and of refusing to bo
taught by tha inexorable logic of events
We presume that Congress and the Radical
party will sus'ain Geu. Grant i'i his
usurpations, aud that we shall ba forced to
"accept the situation." If so, tho people
of the North will, beforejke end oi another
Presidential term, find that they are as
complete slaves ss we are uow subjects.
WHY 3IR. GntELEY-S WILL IS
CONTESTED.
The Indianapolis Sentinel, which is said
to be edited by a gentleman formerly cou
noctod with the cditorpil staff of the New
York Tribune, says: "It is hardly credit
able that the uncle of Mr. Greeley's orphan
daughters, Samuel Sinclair, the publisher of
the Tribune, is really implicated ia the
wretched business of contesting the dead
journalist's will. There seems no apparent
reason for this contest with tho dead man's
children. Sinclair was undo by Horace
Greeley. Years ago, ho took him into the
Tribune, and ho has prospered by that
groat establishment until ho now holds a
crcat many shares in it." Tha animus of
Mr. Sinclair's course is explained In the fol
lowing extract from the Now York corres
pondence (Dec. 12) of tho Cincinnati Com
mercial :
"The pending lawsuit over the two wills
left by Mr. Greeley is pretty well ascertain
ed to be a contest to obtain control or trie
Tribune. The story is that as soon as Mr.
Greeley died Mr. Sinclair set about bring
ing tho Tribune under his control, and
wrote to Schuyler Colfax offering the posi
tion of editor-in-chief to him, at ten thou
sand dollars a year. Mr. Colfax de
clined, but said that perhaps twenty thou
sand dollars would be an inducement.
It then became necessary to buy up tiie
ten shares of stock controlled by the Misses
Greeley, in order to secure a proper majori
ty. Sonator Conkling agreed to put up the
money, and setting out with one hundred
thousand dollars in hand, Mr. Sinclair call
ed on the young ladies, but they refused,
having promised allegiance to Whitelaw
Reid, who some time before had detected
the drift of things. Sinclair thought of ths
former will of Mr. Greeley, and determined
to outflank Reid by contesting the other
document on tho ground of the insanity
of the testator at tho time it was
drawn. This proceeding lies up ten
shares and gives Iho Sinclair party con
trol of the field, at least for the present
Mr. Reid continues in the editoria
chair as usual, waiting the turn of events.
Mr. Sinclair's chief ally Is J. C. Ayer, of
Lowell, who has been a Grant man through
out. It is also said that ouo of tbo condi
tions of Colfax aud his Senatorial friends,
mado with Sinclair, is that a clean sweep of
the present editorial staff shall bo made,
and also of tho Washington bureau."
Sinclair's is not th9 first case of ingrati
tude, and it is likely not to be the last, but
that makes it none the less infamous in his
case.
Two companies of troops stat ioned at
Little Rock have been ordered to New Or
leans. Grant means to back up the carpet
bagger and usurper Kellogg. He is not so
prompt in sending troops to protect the
Texans from the depredations of the In
dians. Senatgr Ames, credited to Mississippi,
failing to be appreciated, has declined fur
ther service on the Military Committco of
the Senate. He is net so sensitive about
the good opinion of the pooplo of Missis
sippi. Minister Washbiirne -is urging the
pftsssgo of such an act as will enable him to
accept an order, gratuity, or other testimo
nial certifying tho stratification of the Ger
man Gotcijnmons at the manner ia which
be acted aa-a representative of that power
in Paris during the Franco-Prussian war.
As his zeal in this capacity was so great that
M. Thiers stigmatized him as a spy, au im
putation the Minister has never, so far as
we know, resented, the Now York World
suspects the proposed testimonial is doubt
less of commensurate value.
ft Charges of repudiation are made by the
-New York Bulletin egainst the States of
Michigan and Minnesota. According to
the above named journal, both these States
"refuse to pay their railroad dents. Tb-o
s only this difference b3tween them: In
Minnesota it is the politicians who are dis
honest; while ia Michigan it is the people.
The voters of Minnesota have repeatedly
decided la favor of paying their railroad
debt, while tho Legislators refaso or delay
the bill to that effect. But ia Michigan it is
the people and not tho Legislature who
play the block game. The results, how
ever, are the same in both cases, and the
creditors of both are cquallj swindled." On
the other hand, it is alleged that sharp
practice was resorted to in procuring rail'
road legislation in these States, and hence
th3 action complained of in Michigan and
Minnesota.
Mb. Kerr, of Indiana, said in Washing:
ton, a day or two ago, that ho thought, in
view of tho recommendations contained in
the President's message and the various
department reports, that this would bo a
session of "jobs" running through from the
postal telegraph, cotton tax refund and
steamship subsidies to the smallest land
grabs. Ho did not expect much national
good to result.
A MUSICAL DUEL.
The Paris papers tell of a duel on a piano
between two musicians. They played for
forty-efcht hours without food or drink.
Having commenced with pieces of a sedate
character, they passed on to waltzes and
thence to operatic music One had played
tho Miserere in "It lrovatora" uve hundred
and einhty times, and was commenciue the
five hundred and eighty-first performance
of that piece, when he sank to rise no more.
Tho other was conveyed to the liospital, his
hfe being despaired of, and tho tour seconds
are suffering from mental aberration.
