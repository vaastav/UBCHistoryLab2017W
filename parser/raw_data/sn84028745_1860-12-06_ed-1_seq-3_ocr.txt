who are posted in the premises, that the
President's Message is insufficient to meet
the present emergency without the sug
gestion that Cincinnati, being the key-stone
of the arch of the Union (North and South
being tbe abutments), is the best place for
citizens of both sides the line to meet and
receive justico to their respective claims, and
that Steeles's Cloak House, is the very place
to meet with fair and impartial, dealing a
fact of vital importance to the community

MISCELLANEOUS. City News. City Council—Proceedings Last Night.
The Counoil met at the usual hour lait
night, President Torrance in the chair. The
minutes of the previous meeting were read
ana epprovea.
Mr. Weesner offered a number of resolu
tions referring to the arrangement of the
C.ty Building, which were passed unani
mously. ine game mem per onerea a resolution
authorizing tbe Roard of City Improvements
to employ a janitor to take care of the City
Buildinp's, at an annual salary of $500.
Mr. Noble believed thattheuity Building
might be kept clean by the city prisoners,
and thereby save expense. 1
Mr. Wcarncr suid lie believed In practicing
(conomy; but it would be poor economy to
trust to tne prisoners to cieun me ouuaing.
Mr. Snodunus moved to strike out two.
and insert tO per rnonth. Lost.
llie original resolution was pnsaca: ayes
21, navs G.
Mr. Weasner offered a reso'ntion directing
the Law Committee to inquire by hat
authority the Pendleton and Fiflli-stroet
Railroad Company had laid a new curve on
tbe corner of Fourth and Walnut-street,
end by what authority the Cincinnati Com
pany bad laid a track on Baymiller-street
from Seventh to Ninth-streets. Adopted.
Mr. Toohy presented the following com
munication from Samuel II. Ooodin, Presi
dent of the I)yton Short-line Railroad :
"The committee of your honorable body,
heretofore Instituted to inquire into the prop
osition made bv the Ccmpany to sell cer
tain lands to the city for the purpose of a
park, and certain privileges to secure a sup
ply of water, having been discharged from
tlin nnsirlnratinn nf the SubieCt without anv
acticn on its part, the undersigned, in behalf
of the said Railroad company, ana at tue
.inncd anllritatinn nf a larpe number of the
petitioners to your honorable body for a sur
vey and estimate of said proposition, respect
fully pray the appointment of another com
mittee, with instructions that it take the
necessary steps to have said Burvey and esti-
....rlW t,A foithfi.nv made "
IUHIV ouili u"J mui m.. .
Messrs. Mack and Weasner opposed 1
reference, because the scheme was chimerl
cal, and because the Ohio River water was
the best that could be obtained.
Mr. Hollister said that he wanted to get
water elsewhere. The Ohio River water was
the most unhealthy in the world. Its equal
in this respect can not be found between the
equator and the poles.
Mr. Moore had used the Ohio water for
forty years, and in all sickly seasons it was
taken in preference to any other. When
tbe cholera was in this city, it affected those
who drank river water hiss than those who
were supplied from wells and cisterns.
The question was then taken on the refer
ence, and it was lost.
Mr. Jxobie cresentea a petition irora a
large number of citizens of tho Sixth Ward,
asking tbe establishment of a steam fire
engine in that ward.
Mr. Walker moved to amend by requiring
some of the old engines, which are too ho avv
to be run, to be stationed in the ward, with
several thousand feet of hose each.
The amendment was lost, and the original
petition was filed, after a lono; discussion.
A communication was received from John
Horton, Commissioner of the Western Dis
ttict, relative to the grading of Seventh
street, between Freeman and Cutter. He
says that be notified the Railroad Company,
but as it did not respond, he advertised, and
fniind that no contractor would do the work
for less than $000 or $800 more than it usually
charced for such work, inasmuch as Council
would require to collect their pay of

for further instructions. The communication
was filed.
Messrs. Ilirst and Froser, to whom was
referred tbe petition of certain property
holders on East Third-street, reported that
tbe Pendleton Street-railroad Company had
not, in many respects, comdied with the or
dinance of July 1, 1859. In some places they
have cut down below the grade of the street,
and in other. places have laid the track
above it. ......
Tbe coromittee.at their first meeting, passed
the following resolution: ' ., '
-Jitiolved: That the City Civil Engineer
notify the Pendleton and fifth-street Rail-
rnari ilnmnanv to conform to the crade in
laying their tracks on Martin nnd East
Third-streets; or in all cases where they vary
from said grade, they must first yet the con
sent of the property-holders i n each side, put
tbe street in good repair, and hold the city
Hnmplem from anv damaze that may arise
from chaneinir the trade. In all other re
spects to conform to the directions of the City
Civil Engineer, as the ordinance directs.
'The Engineer reports to the Committee
that he has notified eaid Railroad Company,'
and they have failed to comply with the or
iiinince but have nursued their own course,
therefore the Committee recommend the
.iinnimn nf the ffitlnwinrr resolutions:
i' Hnintri 'i tint ma resolution imnscu
the Special Committee to whom was referred
the communication of property-holders
Martin-street, be and the same Is hereby
.nr,4ar1 Kv thin Ttnnrrf.
". Jt'srJ, further: That the City Civil
Engineer, and City Commissioners of
Eastern District, notity tne renaioion
Fifth-street Railroad Company to bring their
track to a level with the grade of East Third
and Martin-streets, except in such places
they may get property-owners on each
to consent to a change of the grade of
streets, and in all Buch cases, said consent
must be led in writing with the Board
tity Improvements, and their consent given
thereto, and shall put the street in good con
dition. If ' said Railroad Company fail
comply without dolay vo me noiiucaiiou
eiven by the officers above-named,
officers shall proceed at once to enforce
compliance with all tha legal force
possiss, and If they fail for want of
they shall immediately report .to the
Council. A failure on the part of aither
both the above-named officers to comply
strictly with this resolution, . shall
deemed sufficient cause for impeachment.
The report was adopted.
Mr. Walker presented an ordinance
all the heads of departments,
Clerk of tbe School Board excepted, to
to the Mayor, on tbe Ht of March
each year, and requiring that official
transmit the same to the Council by
H Wednesdiiv of Anril. Passed.
Mr. Walker presented a resolution direct
ing the City Solicitor to draw up an
requiring the street railroad
to comply with the directions of
city officials who have the superintendence
of laying down the tracks. Adopted.
Mr. Eggleston offered the following

MISCELLANEOUS. City News. City Council—Proceedings Last Night. AMUSEMENTS.
PiKi'a OpinA-norsi. The audience last
evening at the Opera-house was small, and
Jlamtel was not as Well performed as we
have seen It at this theater, though Mrs.
Waller s "vpuolia was excellent. Mr.
Waller's "natnlet" we can not like; it Is too
artificial and stagey he is the self-conscious
avttor always.
This evening tne inmous iwtntn 0 mwji
will be repeated, with Mr. Waller as "Duke
Ferdinand," and Mrs. waller as "Marina."
Her creatness in this part is beyond ques
tion, and his personation is perhaps the best
fje unaertaK.es. no one iona 01 siartiiiie
effects and the horrible in tragic art should
fuil to witness Webster's horrible drama.
National Thiatib. This evening, iV
rarro, by Von Autenherg, not nouone, as
the bills and the critics usually have it, will
be eiven, with the young artistr as "Elvira."
This is a difficult part,' less fitted to Miss
Ince than the character or "Cbra," but still
EDO will, we think, tender "Pizarro's" mis
tress with credit and judgment.
Tbi Hiart or ma Aunts. This wonder
ful pioture is still on exhibition in the
concert-room of Pike's Opera-bonm, aud
should, be seen by all lovers 01 art. we con
fess, until we beheld this, we never saw a
landscape beside it all others appear insipid.
Its beauty and greatness are absolute. It
realizes one's ideal of painting, for it seems
Nature itself the highest attainment of the
plastic art. Not to have seen the "Heart of
the Andes" is a misfortune we would not
willingly endure. .

PROBATE COURT.
The Cincinnati and Spring-grove-avenue
Company and the Cincinnati and Spring-grove-avenue
Street-railroad Company t.
A. Smith and H. O. Gilbert. Judge Hilton
charged tbe jury. The plaintiffs made ap
plication to this Court to condemn certain
property belonging to the defendants, sixty
feet wide and 214 'A feet in length.
The Jury should estimate, the absolute
value of the property, not only of tho real
estate, but of the fixtures, taking into con
sideration only tbe damages that wore
natural, proximate and immediate, and not
those that were remote and contingent.
Private property could not be taken for
public use, or for the use of this corporation
without full compensation. The distillery
was runninsr. and the Jury would have to
say whether there was evidence that it was
necessarv to stoD it: and. if so, what would
be the absolute expense or outlay by that
delay. .
The case has now gone to the Jury, who
will commence meir ucuocnuiuus w-ucj.

What is more intolerable than an officious
intermeddler with other people's affairs?
One of the most busy of the tribes was travel
ing in the cars not long ago, and exercising
his talent iu a manner at once amusing and
mischievous. "Hallo!" cries Mr. Meddler,
to a dtcrcpid old gentleman, just as tho train
was leaving a wuy-utation, " Wake up, and
step lively I This is the place where you
want to get out." The old man had barely
time to put his tottering legs on the platform
of the depot, when the train was ngain in
mntinn. 'Good Gracious!" exclaimed Mr.
Meddler, on returning to his seat wbicu was
rext the one which the old gentleman had
occupied "Good gracious! the old fellow
has gone ana ich ui carpet nag 1 m no
kindly threw it out of the window.
Hull an nour later, a young mii rauis iu
from another car and inquired for a mUiing
carpet-bag. " It was on this seat," sud tho
stranger, pointing 10 we spot, wimrw nm vm
gentleman had heen silting. " Good gra

how came the old man to leave the train ?
"Wty," said 3Ir. Meddler, "I thought
heard him say he was going to Middleport,
so when we came to the depot, I told hitn be
was there, and bad better get out. That's
how it was." .
" Yon had better have minded your own
business," said the young man, rathe
sharply. "That old gentleman was going
Middlebury, to see a dying son. who will now
be dead and buried, probably, before
father can get there. That's one of the
of your officious intermeddling with
things that don't concern you. And that

thus sneaks of beauty:
That beauty is the normal state, is shown
by the perpetual effort of nature to obtain it.
Mirabeau had an ugly fitce on a handsome
ground; and wo see lace every dy which
have a good type, but have been marred in.
tbe casting; a proof that we are all entitled
to beauty, should have been beautiful, if our
ancestors hsd kept tho laws as every lily
and every rose is well. But our bodies do
net fit us, but caricature and satirize us.
Thus, short legs, which constrain us to short,

mincing alalia, - r
and contumely to the owner, and long stilts,
again, put him at perpetual disadvantage,
anrt 7iWda It llTl tn atrx.n to the treuoral lovel of
mankind. Martial ridicules a gentleman oi
bis day whose countenance resomblod the
face of a swimmer seen under waUr. Saadi
describes a schoolmastor "eo ugly "tl crabbed
that a sight of him would derange the ocsta
cies of the orthodox." Faces are rarely true
to any ideal type, but are a record in sculp
ture of thousand anecdotes of whim and
folly. Portrait painters say that most face
and forms are irregular and unsymmetricol;
have oue eye blue aud oue gray; the none not
straight; ana ot.e suouiucr inguw -
othe.; the hair unequally distnuuteu, uo.
The man is physically as well as metaphysi
cally a thing of shreds and patches, borro wed
unequally from gooa auu uu uumw.-, -a
miafit from the start.
A beautiful person, among me ui com,
thought to betray by this igu eoino secret
f. Z . ,k. imnw.rtjil nods: aud we ton
pardon pride, when a woman possesses suU
a. riouro that where ever she stands, or moves,
or leaves a shadow on the wall, or sita tor
portrait to the artist, sue wuiun a mvor uu

The Senate afterwawd adjournod.
HOUSE Mr. Sherman, from- the Com
mittee of Ways nnd MfHns, reported a bill ;
making appropriations for the payment of
invalid and other pensions; also, o bill for
the support of the West Point Military
Academy. Referred to the Committee of.
tbe Whole on the state of the Union.
Tbe House, by 68 against 125-, reflised tt
lnvnn the table Mr. Grow'e motion to re
consider the vote by whist the Homestead
Bill was referred last session to the Com
mittee of the Whole. '
The vote was then reconsttrered, a4- the
bill wan thus brought up for action.
Mr. Grow did not desire to discuss the
matter, the principle involved having been
familiar to the country for tbe past tea
years. This bill, however, avoids the promi
nent objections in President Buchanan's
veto message. It does not propose to do
nate lands, but requires the payment of $10
ftp 160 acres. He might, if necessary, quote
Jackson against Buchanan, to show that the)
former was of the opinion that the publio
lands should not be a source of Federal
revenue. He moved the previous question,
nnder the operation ot which the biu
passed 132 to .G.
After some debate on other matters, the-
House went into Committee on the Military
Academy Bill, which, as well as the Pension
Bill was passed.
