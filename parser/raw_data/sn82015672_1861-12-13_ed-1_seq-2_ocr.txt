THe Mason-snneii Cist.
By the arrival of the Africa, we have for-
eign papers containing articles upon the
question of the seizure of Slidell and Ma
Eon, although the news of their capture had
not reached England when the Africa sail
ed. The discussion arose from the fact that
the James Adger, an American steamer,
was reported to be in seafrh of Slidell and
Mason, and rumors were afloat that the Ad
ger intended to take thein forcibly from
the British mail steamer. We make the
following extract from an article on the
subject referred to, from the Edinburg
Scotsman :
It has been ascertained to be the opinion
of the Una officers of the Crown that, accord-
inn to Ihe interpretation of the law, u laid
down in former decisions, the relations of
Lrtiatn to tlie American belligerents art, per
haps, such that thtre might have been fair
It gal grounds for the American cruiser seix-
MM the mail steamer as a prize, even in Brit-
ish waters, if it could have been shown that
she knowingly harbored the persons anil prop
erty of enemies of the United Stales, in the
shape of the deuyatcs and thetr despatches.
Although it was not at all evident that
the Jaruca Adger was in search of Slidel
and Mason, yet the zeal of the rebel agents
in bringing her case before the authorities
has had the effect of prejudging that of the
Trent, and binding the British law officers
by their own declarations. The paragraph
quoted from the Scotsman, settles the case
of the Trent in our favor. The Captain of
the Trent could not plead ignorance of the
cbaracU
of Slid-11 and Mason, when he
took them on board. They were the ob
ject of peblic ovation in Havana, and their
character was well known. The message
of Jtff. Davis settles the point as to their
official capacity, and thns the last doubtful
poiot as to the legality of their capture is
wept away. The English newspapers, how
ever, Will make a great Bh'ow of indigna
tion over the affair, and by the ueit steam
er we shall have the news of what was said
and done in England, when the lacl trans
pired that Mason and Slidell had really
been taken by force from a British mail
steamer.
Ilalleck's Programme.
A Sedalia correspondent of the Burling
ton Hawk-Eye has it from " reliable author
ity," that General Halleck will soon make
a move in the right direction. He says it
has been ascertained to a certainty that
Price is at Osceola, on the Osage, and is so
situated that he will be compelled to fight.
ne then gives the programme, which, for
the benefit of the speculative, we copy en
tire: ''The whole division of this department
will move upon him from five different
points at the same time. Hunter, with his
division from the West, to prevent a possi
bility of his going into Kansas, and thW
prevent his devastating that State or escap
ing in that direction. Generals Wjman
and Asboth, from Rolla, will proceed by
way of Springfield or Bolivar, to prevent
his retreating South. General Pope, from
Syracuse, will go by way of Warsaw, and
General Steele's division from Sedalia.
These different divisions will constitute n
force of about 50,000 men, with about 4,000
cavalry and two or three powerful batteries.
With this programme well executed, it will
be miracle if.he should escape. As to
numbers the two armies will probably be
nbout equally matched."
Tb'rs is all very nice on the part af cor
respondent eforesaid; but the etory is one
of that class that sailors insist should be
"fold to marines." The people are heartily
si. k of listening to the very wonderful
things our great Generals are going to do.
They ean't avoid seeing what they don't
do The past casts shadow of doubt
over the future.
General Price, according to this sagacious
correspondent, is encamped at Osceola.
Five divisions of otr army are to march on
hira from five different points, and he oaa't
escape. The whole mnmber of both armies
aro estimated to bo about equal. Gen
eral Prire'6 army is consolidated while ours
is to be Jt np into fire parte, so as to af
ford the rebel General an opport unity to
overpower tbem in detail.
Gen. Hclleck's experience la not likely to
induce him to commit each a blunder as
that. But Price is in oo danger. Mis road
to retreat is always open. Our troops
would have near double the distance to
march from Rolla to Springfield, that
would have t be passed over by the rebels,
and consequently the lltr could reach that
place in advance of the federal, in spite of
ail they could do.
it is all folly to taik about any more
campaigns in MiwK.uri this wiuter. The
troops must go i'j'o vrinter quarters, if they
are not all to be cVeiroved by dise-we, as
jave many alteudy. Our information from
Missouri is, that 'hey are preparing winter
quarters. Gen. Price will also, we presume,
stop operations for the winter ; and, as be
has the State to select from, choose some
healthy locality for his army to build bute.
Ij AST NIGHT'S MAIL.
A private letter from on board one of the
vessels engaged in the fight at Fort Picken3,
dated Nov. 26th, states that the fight was
commenced by the steamer Vermont, at 10
o'clock on the 23d. She suffered badiy, one
shell passing through her bulwaiks and ex
ploding, killing the captain of one of the
g'las and wonnding six men, and lifting
the vessel almost out of the water. At
that date Fort Pickens ha 1 lost one man
killed and seven wounded.
From Kentucky we learn that Generals
Rousseau, Negley, and Johnson's brigades
had crossed .Green river via Mumfonlsville.
There is likely to be warm work in Ken-
tuaky soon. Nine of the Indiana regiments
are ordered to hold themselves in readiness
for marching orders, and several will start
this week. The 11th Michigan Regiment,
1,200 strong, passed through Indianapolis
on Tuesday night for Keutucky.
Second Lieut. Lorin G. Wood, of Ihe 17th
Indiana regiment, having absented himself
without proper authority, is mustered out
of service, by order of Gen. Buell.
A correspondent of the Cincinnati En-
qnirer thinks Zollicoffer will soon find
himself in an exceedingly tight place. Al
ready he says " a federal force of 15,000 13
in his rear, and his capture is inevitable."
The correspondent draws largely on Ii Is im
agination. Gen. Scboepff was being re-in-forced,
and would not fall back any further
than Stanford.
Another correspondent of that paper,
thinks General Buell is not very popular
with the Colonels, and even with the Di
vision commanders. He refuses to hear
the complaints of the Colonels, and will
not consult with the Generals. All he re
quires of them is to obey bis commands
and execute his orders. His plans and in
tentions are known only to himself. The
same correspondent says, "intelligence has
been received hero that Captain McGowan's
Kentucky Company of Cavalry, connected
with Colonel Jackson's Regiment, were sent
out on a scouting expedition from Ohiim
bersbarg and has never been heard from
since. The Captain has quietly crossed
over with all of his horses, trap.?, Ac, and
joined the Confederate Army.'' We doi.V
believe a word of it.
Jackson's theu are
not of that, stripe.

We fiiiti tiss following piragrapb.3 in the
Louisville papers, of WedncHsy evening:
The-Nashville-Loulsville Courier shvs

of four hundred and eighty beef belonging

The Fortv-niuth Indiana regiment, en
camped near Jeffersonville, has been or

A telegraphic despatch says that Colo
nel Garrard wrote from London, Ky., 00
Saturday afternoon that Gen. George B.
Crittenden is at Cumlierland Gap with a
large force, and 5,000 men at Morristown,
coniing on to join him. He says that Crit
tenden has thirty days rations, and will,
he fears, invade us from that point. The
Tennessee Brigade and Col. Garrard's regi
ment having gone to Somerset, there are,
at this time, no troops to check Crittenden.
Moving. A train of loaded army wag
on, a mile nnct a nan in lengm, pneseii
through the eity this morning. The tegi
menta to which they belong had gone for
ward, with the exception of a nutnher suffi
cient to strike tents and pack up. Thi
gives evidence of work.

Prof. G. W. Warren, for a serenade last ey

Long life to the gallant 15th and its band.
Lou. Democrat, lOiA
The Bank of Louisville has declined to
answer the call for a loan to the Military
Uoard. It the banks ot this (Jommou-
wealth, created by the Legislature with
certain valuable privileges, in a crisis like
this, withhold their quota of funds, as a
means of crippling the actions of the State,
we trust the Legislature in its wisdom will
adopt such action as will speedily ascertain
the reason why. If the sympathies of the
director? in this bank are so completely en
listed in the cause of the enemy that they
fatl to respond to the call of the Military
Board, it should be known at once. Or, it
may be, that through bad management the
bank is uuablo to respond to the call. In
either case, a searching inquiry should be
instituted by the Legislature, and the facts
made known. Louisville Democrat.
FoBTiiMOATiow or Nahvili,e. We learn
on very good authority that the rebels
commenced the work of fortifying Nashville
about ten days ago. We presume that Geu.
Buell is aware of this fact, and is taking
his measures accordingly.
Arrived. The First Regiment of Ohio
Cavalry, Col. Rawson, arrived this morning
on the steamers Izetta, Lady Jackson, and
Great Western. They are well armed and
equipped.
The Eleventh Regiment Michigan Infant
ry, with a cavalry company attached, under
command of Colouel May, arrived by the
Jefferson rilte Railroad, and marched through
the city to Oakland, where they camp until
the cavalry ran be supplied with saddles,
bridles, and arms.
The Forty-Ninth Reg mien t Indiana In
fantry, Colouel Ray, came over from Camp
Joe Holt, and have gone on to tho wars.
Tho Thirteenth Ohio, Col. Smith, also
came over from the Indiana shore, and
marched through the city.
Outraok in OBrrnmai County. We
learn, through a gentleman who has just
arrived from Crittenden county, of an out
rage committed one day last week in that
county. A party of rubels undertook to
arrest a Union man ou account of his senti.
meaus, and in the attempt one of the crowd
vac shot, aad the Unionist escaped.
That night, or she n xt, a party of rebels
went to the house of Mr. S. Scott, a very
old man, aud dragging him from his bed
and the bouse, riddled biiu with balls, kill-
log bim insMntly. Tbey then proceeded
iO the bouse of Mr. Cannon, and in a situi-
lar manner shot and killed him. The only j Startling Development An Abolition

from Buelmr's army, the Union men wonld

The Charleston Mercury reviews the Sli
dell and Mason seizure, and thinks that if
Great Britain is hard up for cotton, that it
will be glad of making the "outrage" a
pretext for declaring war against the United
States.
Gen. Tom Thumb visiled the estate of
Mr. Ira Matthew, on the Kalamazo, last week,
and indulged in a hunting expedition. The
little fellow shot a deer, whose length,
when measured, proved to bo six feet one
inch, girth three feet nine inches, and his
antlers twenty two inches in length;
weight about 142 pounds. A fine specimen
of those denizens of the forest.
We have already stated that a young
"lady " belonging to SiidcU's party slapped
Lieutenant Fairfax on the face when he no
tified the "Embassador" of his arrest. We
learn from the account of an eye witness,
furnished to the Panama Star, that the fe
rocious female alluded to was Slidell's
daughter, aud that not content with pitch
ing into the Lieutenant, she melodramat
ically bared hur breast and bade him strike
her dead.
The Board of Delegates of American Is
raelites coiqposed of representatives from th

The bustle and activity continues 00
Long wlinrf, Huston, in connection with the
forwarding or SOppUeS for General Butler's
expedition. Immense piles of hard wood,
large quantities of lumber ot all varieties,
and many thousand of brick, show thnt our
soliii nra are to be provided with substantial
r.tructtues on the rebel coast, and be com
fortably warmed. The ships Georgo Green,
Idaho, and Bullion aro rapidly filling with
these materials and with provisions, small
steam engines being used to facilitate the
loading of each vessel. They will be ready
to sail in a few days.
Proposed Remodelino of Italy. It is
said that the project of the new Italian Con
federation proposes a Northern kingdom,
with Victor Emanuel at its head; a Papal
State, including Umbria and the Marches,
and a Neapolitan kingdom under Francis
II. Venice would be given to the Northern
kingdom. The great obstacle to the realiza
tion of this plan is Baron Ricasoli ; but
every kind of intrigue was at work to
displace hira. The financial condition of
France was still very precarious, and M.
Fould was exercising all his ingenuity in
order to lay the basis of a new budget.
The Defender of Port Royal Aukested.
A letter addressed to a Georgia officer
from his sister iu South Carolina was captur
ed in Virginia a few days ago. The fair
writer ii very much enraged at the cap
ture of Port Royal and Beaufort, and ays
many of the wealthy families of the latter
place are now ruined, and are hiring houses
in Charleston for 512 per month. She
says Gen. Drayton, who commanded the
South Carolina forces at Port Royal, has
been arrested as a traitor, because be order
ed a retreat before there was any necessity,
as they had time to save everything; in
stead of which they retreated with such
precipitation as to leave their arras behind.
The officers even left their swords.
Fatal Accident. We learn from the

on Tuesday, during the march of the let

Wiih several others, he wns trying to get

marks that he was reported to have made in
favor of Lincoln and hi3 dynasty; he was
watched ; the result of which was that he

160-Our advices from Frankfort this
morniuir seem to leave no doubt that Zolli
coffer has crossed the Cumberland river, and
an engagement with the Union troops, near
Somerset, was expected yesterday. Gen.
Bhoepff's force consisted of six regiments
and two batteries, including three Ohio
regiments. Nine thousand is the minimum
estimate of the enemy's strength, and
the highest figure i3 fifteen thousand. .That
is too bad. But the opinion prevails at
Frankfort that Gen. Schoepff will maintain
his ground. CXn. Gas.

says :
The editor of tbe Louisville Journal
seems to bava argued himself into a perfect
frenzy over the President's message, but, so
far as we can learn, his diatribes have bad
no effect upon any one else. He commenced
his lectures upon a telegraphic mistake, but
he is so excited and elated over bis wonder
ful articles that he has not had time to dis
cover bis mistake; ana, propably, if he
should discover it, making the proper cor
rection would be too humiliating at this
time, before the ink in which his denuncia
tions are recorded is dry. We think he
had bettor go ahead, and not stop this side
of tho Confederate lines.

INFORMATION k FACTS
FOR THE COlfftlDERATION OF
SINGLE AND MARRIED GENTLEMEN!
It is tho desire of all to Dress Neatly, Tastefully, Genteelly, and as Economically
as possible.
Now, "let us reason together," and endeavor to ascertain what will be the proper
course to pursue, in order to attain tho desired end.
First. We should purchase Good Articles of Apparel, that will retain their color
and gloss, as all inferior, cotton-mixed cloths will, in a rery short time, lose their
color and gloss, and give the wearer a superannuated appearance, and cause him to look
as though the' sun of his prosperity was on the wane.
Secondly. A Good Fitting Garment, properly adjusted to tbe foim and prrpor
tions of the wearer, is much more Bervicable and satisfactory than a graceless fitting
article. And Clothing properly made, cnt in good style, and trimmed durably and
neatly, will wear fully twico as long, look much better while it does wear, and coat but
little nioro than common Machine-tnado, Slop-Shop Goods.
Thirdly. In order to obtain Clothing combining tho qualities above mentioned,
we recommend the citizens of Vanderburgh and rtro adjoining countiee, and also our
riends In Kentucky, to call at
O
Who receives fresh aupplies of fine Clothing and Furnishing Goods every day, by Ex.
press, from New York, and in order to place first-elrss Clothing within the reach of nil;
he is determined to sell Fine Clothing lewxr than it can be bongbt at any other House
in tbe State. He bas now on bands a
Stock of Fine Clothing and Furnishing;
the people.
