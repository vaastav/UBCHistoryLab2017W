: PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Washixotox, D. C, Dec, 5,1870.
' To tlie Senate and House of Representatives:
A j ear of peace and general proHperi
ty to tLis nation has passed since the last
a&soniMiiig of Congress. Wo have, through
a kind Providence, been blessed with
abundant crop?, and have been Fpared
from complications and war with foreign
nations. In our midst comparative har
mony has been restored. It is to be re
gretted, however, that a free exercise of
the elective franchise has; by violence and
intimidation, been denied to citizens in ex
ceptional cases in several of the States
lately in rebellion, and the verdict of the
people thereby been reversed. The States
of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas have
been restored to representation in our Na
tional Councils. Georgia, the only State
now, without' representation' may confi
dently be expected to take its place there
also at the beginning of the New Ye:ir,
and then let us hope will be completed
the work of reconstruction. '
With an acquiescuce on the part of tha
whole people iu the national obligation to
pay the public debt, created as the price
of our Union, the pensions to our disabled
soldiers, their widows .and orphans, and ia
thd changes oi the Constitution, whtcu have
a war.
S:ou after, the existing war broke out
in Europe, the prelection of the United
State.-! Minister iu Paris was invoked in fa
vcr of the North Germans domiciled m
rVem-h territory. Instructions were is
sued to gruut the protection. This has
been followed by an extension of Ameri
can protection to citizens of other coun
tries. As soon as I learned that , a republic
had been proclaimed at Palis, und that
the people of i- rance had acquiesced in
the change, the Minister of . the United
States was ordered by telegraph to'reeog
riize it : and tender my congratulations
aud those i.f the peojde of the Ui.iicu
States Government.. The re-eslallish-i!it-iii
in France of a system of Govern
ment disconnected with th dyuasty tra.
dit ions' of Enrcpe, appeared to he a pros
per subject fi.r the i'elicitaliou of Ameri
cans, should the present struggle roult
in. attaching the. h&irts of the French
to our simple forms of representative gov
ernment, it will be a subject tf .-till iur
ther satisfaction to our people. While v.e
make no. ciVort to impose our iatitutious
ujiou the iuhahitauts of other countries,
neutrality i:i civil contests close where, we
cannot be iudiiTcrcnt to the spread of
American political ideas iu a great and
highly cn ilied country tike France. Vv"e
were ushed by the low government to use
our goo . 1 cilices jointly with those of Eu
ropeon poweis in the interest of peace.
Ai ver was n:ade that the established
ptdi. i. saud the true interests of the Uni
ted Sn.tcs forbade them to interfere in l'u-
rupeau qnestir.r.s jointly with European
jmjwcvs. I ascertained informally and un
officially, that the Uovcrrmcnt of North
Germany was not then disposed to listen
to such repre.ssiitatii.siiS from any power,
and though earnestly wishing to the
bhvinr-s of peace restored, to the beliger
ents, to i.ll of n horn the ITnited States are
on tertuii of friendship, I declined, ou the
part of this Government, to take a sttp
which could only result iu injury to our
true interests, without advancing the ob
ject lor which our intervention was in
voked. Should the time come when the
action of the United States can hasten the
return of peace by a single hour, that ac
tion will be heartily taken. I deemed it

It is not understood that the condition
of the insurrection in Cuba has naturally
changed since the close of the last session
of Congress. In an early stage of the con
test the authorities of Spain' inaugurated a
scheme of arbitrary arrests, of close con
finement, of military trial aud execution
of persons suspected of complicity with the
insurgents, and of summary embargo of
their proportion aud requisition of their
revenues by Executive warrant. Such
proceedings', as far as I hey effected the per
sons and property of citizens of the Uni
ted States, vvere in violation of the treaty
o'i "l7;., Jiitwecn the United. States and
Spain.
llepresentations of injuries re
sulting to several persons, claiming to be
citizens of tne U. States by reason of such
violation, were made to the Spanish Gov
ernuicnt, troni April, lftu,to June last.
The Spanish Minister at Washington had
been clothed with a limited power to aid
in the redress of such wrongs. That pow
er was 'found to be withdrawn in view, as
it was said, of the favorable situation in.
which the Island of Cuba was then, which
however, did net1 lead to revolution or
.suspension of the extraordinary and arbi-"
trarv function exercised by the Execu
tive power in Cuba, and wo were obliged
to make our. conrplauit jitMadrid. Iu the
negotiations thus, opened and standing,
these United States only claimed that for
the future the rights secured to their cit
izens ' by - treaty s-liould be respected : in
Cuba, and that as to the past, a joint tri
bunal rhpnld be established in the United
States with full jurisdiction over all such
claims. Before such an impartial tribu
nal each claimaut should be required to
prove his case. On the other hand, Spain
would be at liberty to traverse every ma
(errarfact and 'thus complete equity would
be'doife i A ca.se 'which,' at' one time,
threatened seriously to affect relations be

ing negotiation unfortunately aud ' unex
pectedly Le without tins result, it will
soon become my duty to commuuicate this
fact to Congress, and invite its action
on the subject. i The long deferred peace
conference between Spain and the allied
South American llepublics has been in
augurated uuder the auspices of the Uni
ted States, pursuant to the recommenda
tion contained in a resolution of the 17th
cf December, 18CG. The Executive .De
partment of the Government ' offered its
friendly offices for the propiation of peace

Ministers of Spain Peru, Chili and Ec
quiidof. Inconsequence of the absence of
a representative from Uoli via, the. confer
ence was adiourned until the attendance
of the plenipotentiary from that Kepublic
could be secured or other measures could
be adopted towards composing its object.
The allied and other republics of Spanish

wiil eoasj. Our policy should be shaped
in view of this probability, to jo clly the
commercial interests of the Spanish-American
States more closely to our own,
and thus give the United States all the
advantage which Mr. Monroe, Mr. Adams
and Mr. Clay coutcinplared when they
proposed to join the Congress of Fauania.
During the last session of Congress a
treaty for the annexation of the -llepublic
of Siin Duiniugo.tu the United States fail
ed to receive tiie two thirds vote of the
Senate. I was thoroughly convinced that
the best interest ;.f the country, commer
cially and materially', demanded its rati
ciitio;i. Tiias has only conCnned me iu
this view. I now Grn.ly believe that tho
moir.ci.t it i. known that the United States
l.ive entirely abandoned the- project of j
accepting as a rurt.of its territory the Is-
laud of San Doininiro, a free poit will be
negotiated 'by European' nations.
The President continues, at some length,
to urge the advantage of , acquiring San
Domingo, and concludes as follows :
In icw of the iniortance of this ques
tion, 1 earnestly' urge upon Congress early
action expressive of its views as to the best
means oi" w:quirir:g San Doiuingb. My
sugecation is, that by a joint resolution of
the two houses of Congress, the Executive
be authorized to appoint a commissioner to
negotiate for a treaty w ith the. authorities
of San Doiuiugo, .for the, acquisition of
that island p aud that an appropriation be
made to defray the expenses of such com
mission. The question may then be de
termined by the two houses of Congress
ujxin a resolution of annexation,' as in the
case of the acquisition of Texas.
The massacre of French and Russian
residents at Tein-Tsin, under circumstan
ces of great barbarity, were supposed , by
some to have been premeditated, and to
indicate a purpose among the populace to
exterminate foreigehers , in the Chinese
Empire. The evideuce fails to establish
such a proposition but shows complicity
by the local authorities and the mob. : The
Government at Pekin, however, seems to
have beeu disposed to fulfil its treaty obli
gati6n.si far as it was able to do so. Un
fortunately, the hews of the war between
the German States and France, was receiv
ed soon after the massacre. It would ap
pear that the popular mind became pos
sessed with the idea that this contest, ex
tending to ChinescTwaters, would neutral
ize the Christian mhiienee and power, ani
that the time was coming when the super
stitious mass might expell all , foreigners,
and restore the Mandarin influence. An
ticipating trouble from this cause, I . invit
ed France and North Germany to mak?
an authorized r suspension. of : hostilities in

Since the adjournment of Congress the
ratifications of the treaty with Great' Urit-
aiu the abolishing the mixed courts for tue
sunnresion of the sliive trade has been' re
cognized. It is believed that the nlave
trade is now. confined to the eastern coast
of Africa, where the slaves are taken to
the Arabian markets. Ihe ratifications of
the naturalization conventions ' between
Great Britain" and the United States, have
also been exchanged during the recess, and
thus a long standing dispute between the
t,wo governments has been settled in , ac
cordance with the principles always' con
tended for by the United State9. I re
gret to say. that no conclusion has been
reached for the adjustment of the claims
against Great Britain.1 growing out of the
course adopted by "that Government du
ring the rebellion. r . .
"' The Cabinet of London, so far as its
views have been expressed, does not ap
pear to be willing to concede that Her
Majesty's Government", was guilty of negli
gence, or did not permit, any act during the
war by which the United States has just
cause to complain. Our firm and unalter
able convictions are 'directly the reverse,
and therefore recommended to Congress to
authorize the appointment cf a connnis-sion
to take proof oftbe amounts aud, the
owuefiibip of their claims, on notice t the

the honor and dignity of both nations. -.
.'. The course pursued by the Canadian au
thorities toward the fishermen of the Uni
ted States during the present season,- has
not been marked by a friendly feeling.
By the, first article of the convention of
1818 between Great Britain and the Uni
ted' States, it was agreed that the inhabit
ants of the United States should have for
ever, in common with the British subjects
the right of taking fish liu certain waters
therein defined ; in waters not included in
the limits named iu convention within
three' miles of the ports of the. .British
coast.' It has been the custom for many
years to givo to the trading fishermen of
the United States a rcasuuable warning of
their violation of the technical righU of
Great Britain. . ,, : ' - ..
The Imperial Government is understood
to have delegated the whole or a share of
its jurisdiction to the control of these fish
ing grounds, to the colonial-authority
known as the Dominion of Canada, and
this same independent . but irresponsible
agent has exercised its delegated powers
in f.n unfriendly Way. ' Vessels have been
seized without notice or warning, in viola
tion of the custom previously pievailiug
and have been taken iato colonial ports.
their .voyages brokcu up, and vessels con
demned, and there is reason to believe that
this unfriendly and vexatious treatment
was designed to bear harshly upon the har
dy fishermen of the United States. With
a view to political efiest upon the Govern-,
mcnt, the statutes of the Dominion of Can
ada nssmne still brondor and more untena
ble jurisdiction over vessels of the United
btates. , bey -authorize the olaeers or per
sons to bring the vessels hovering withiu

It is not known that any condemnation
have becu made under this statute. Should
the authorities of Canada attempt to en
force it, it will become my duty to take
such steps as may be necessary to protect
the rights of citizens of the United States.
Anticipating that an attempt may possibly
be made by the Canadian authorities in
the coming .season to repeat these unncigh-bo-ly
acts toward our fishermen, J recom
mend you to confer upon the Executive
the power to Mispeud by proclamation the
operation of laws authorizing the transit
of goods, wares, and merchandise in bond
across the territory of the United States to
CauaJa : aud further, should fcuch an ex-
trcinn lnrr.sure become necessary, to sus-
j.en(1 tlie (1j,erations of any laws whereby
vesscs 0f the dominion of Canada are per-
lnitted to enter the waters of the United
Ststos. ' ' .''".'.
Our 'depressed commerce is a subject to
which I called especial attention at the last
session, and suggested that we will in fu
ture have to look more to countries south
of us and to China and Japtia. , Our rep
resentatives to all those Governments have
exerted their influence to encourage trade
between the United States and the coun
tries to which they are accredited, but the
fact exists that the carrying is done almost
entirely in foreign bottoms, aud while this
state of affairs exict we can not control our
due share of the commerce of the world.
That between the Pacific States and China
and Japan is about all the carrying trade
now", conducted in American vessels. I
would recommend a liberal policy toward
that line of American ships, one that will
insure its success, and even increase its
usefulness. The cost of building iron ves
sels, theories that will compete with for
eign ships in the carrying trade, is ho, much
greater in the United States than in for
eh'u countries that, without some assis
tance from tho Government, they can : pot
be successfully, built. There will be sev
eral propositions laid before Congress in
the course of the present session looking to
a remedy for this evil. Even if it should
be at some cost to the national treasury, I
hope such encouragement will be given as
will secure American shipping on the high
seas and American ship building at home.
The estimates for the expenses' of the
Government for the fiscal year are $1,X21,-'
113,001, less than for the current one, but
exceed, the appropriations for the preterit
year, for the same items, $81)7,212,75(5.
In this estimate, however, is included $-'2,-338,27.s.
37 . for public works heretofore
begun under Congressional provision, and
of which only so much is asked as Con-
cress may choose to give. The appropri
ations for the same works for thepresent
fiscal year was $ 1 1 ,0? 1 ,5 1 8 08. ; , 1
The a verage value of gold, as compared
with national currency, for the, whole of
the year lftGU, was about 134, and for ele
inouths of 1870 the sauie relative value
has been about 1 V). Tlie approach to a
specie basis is very gratifying, but the fact
can not be denied that the instability of
the value of our currency is prejudicial to
our prosperity; tends to keep up pri
ces, to the detriment of trade,' and '.. the
evils of a depreciated and fluctuating cur
rency are so great that now when the pre
mium on gold has fallen so much it would
seem the time had arrived when when, by :
wise and prudent legislation,' Congress
should look to a policy which would place
our currency at par with gold at no dis
tant day. The revenue collected ' from
tho people has been reduced more than
."0,O0U,O0O per annum. By steadiness
in our present course there .is no" reason
whv. in a few short yearB, the national tar
calherer may not disappear from the door
of the citizens almost entirely. . With the

it means this,' has my hearty support. If
it impliesa collection' of all the . revenue
for the snppoit of the 'Government, for

.public debt, pens-ion, etc., by directly tar
ing the people, then I am against such re-

True revenue reform cannot be made in
a day, but must bo the work of national
legislation and of time, As soon ; as the
revenue can be dispensed, with, all tlutjr
should be removed from coffee, tea, and
other articles of univorsal use not produced
by ourselvos. The necessities of the coun
try compel "s to collect revenue from .our
imports,. An army of assessors and collec
tors is nOt a pleasant sight to the cituen.
but that of a tariff for revenue is necessary.
Such a tariff, so far as it acta in encour

duty which so much eiubarresses the Exe
