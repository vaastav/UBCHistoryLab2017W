THE PRESIDENT'S
LAST MESSAGE
THOSE WHO expected the dom
inant note of the President's
annual message to Congress to be a
war-ory urging on the fight for the
League have been disappointed.
Neither have those who looked for a
document filled with biting sarcasm
for the opponents who thwarted his
efforts been gratified, for there Is In
it no call to battle, no song of victory,
nor no denunciation. .
A great figure movng off the stage,
who has upheld a great cause, and
been stricken while so doing, pauses
for an Instant to point out to his
countrymen what he considers the
vital principle by which, and by
which alone, the affairs of not only
this nation, but of the world, can be
ordered aright.
The tone Is one of retroprospect.
Of or3 who is consciously through
With a great task and looks far into
the future, and like an undertone
can be detected the sadness of fare
well. In the President's own expres
sive phrase it is a "confession of
faith."
At this supreme moment his "mind
turns to that other srea American
President with whom in the years to
come his name will be so often link
ed and In that sentence of Lincols's
"Let us have faith that right makes
might, and in that fath let us dare
to do our duty as we understand it,"
a sentence which he calls immortal,
be finds his text.
This he says is the "essential faith
of the nation, the faitu in which it
was conceived, and the faith in wltich
it has grown to glory and power," and
points out that upon this faith rests
the hope of the world for a "new
order in which reason and right would
take precedence of covetousness and
lorcc."
Then follow a few concrete sug
gestions calling the attention of Con
gress to some of the obvious needs of
the moment among the more salient
points of which were:
Revision and simplification of the
tax laws.
A fiscal programme to retire the
floating debt of $2,500,000,000, and
to pay at maturity in 1923 part of
the Victory loan and war savings
certificates of $5,000,000,000.
A workable budget system, in the
hands of a single body.
Medical care, rehabilitation and
vocational training for war victims,
Federal licenses for corporations
engaged in interstate commerce,
With provision for labelling with cost
tags all goods sent to cold storage.
A loan to Armenia such as was
made to the Allies during the war.
I Grant the people of the Philip
pines the independence "they so
honorably covet."
Quite enough to keep an efficient
Congress busy during the three
months of the present session; more
man enougn ior many montns gauged
by the past performance of the sixty-
aixth Congress.
Then in clothing the President's
mind turns again to the reasons for
tha.faith whicn is in him and he says
"I have not so much laid be
fore you a series of recommenda
tions as sought to utter a confes
sion of faith, of the faith to
stand by until my last fighting
day. I believe this to be the
faith of America, the faith of the
future, and of all the victories
which await national action in
the days to come, whether in
America or elsewhere."
It is a worthy summons to higher
things in national life and aspiration.
Woodrow Wilson's fellow citizens
can well afford to give it more than
perfunctory attention.
that China was building them for
the United States. These two ships,
which are ' now nearing completion.
constitute half an order placed In
China by the United States Shipping
Board, two other ships of identical
size being still on the ways.
China now has four shipbuilding
yards capable of turning out a mod
ern ocean carrier complete. These
yards are located at Shanghai, Foo
chow, Canton and Taku, just outside
Tientsin. These yards are capable of
turning out these great boats complete
in all particulars. Not only this but
they are equipped with the most
modern appliances. Great ten and
twenty-ton electric cranes, the best
of lathes, drill presses, and punches.
electric and gas welders, air riveters
and the like are all looked upon as a
matter of course in these plants.
The readiness with which the
Chinese mechanic "takes" to foreign
tools Is said to be remarkable. No
mechanism, whether operated' by
hand, steam or electricity, seems too
complicated for them to grasp and
grasp quickly. As a result the ship
yards in China have been able to
show production charts which com
pare favorably with those of Amer
ican and European yards.
China is lacking in both wagon
roads and railroads, the bulk of do
mestic transportation being carried
by water. For this reason the de
velopment of the shipbuilding indus
try is of immense importance to the
nation and also to outside nations
which trade with her. It will now
be possible for China to supply herself
with the great fleets of small shal
low boats of high power needed to
navigate the upper reaches of the
great rivers and In which the pro
ducts of the interior can be carried
to the seaports for trans-shipment to
all parts of the world. Progressive
Chinese are now realizing that the
old junks are not equal to the trans
portation needs of the country and
they propose to displace man power
with steam power and there Is little
if any, doubt that the results will be
the same in China as In every other
country where similar progress has
been made.'
countries. This leaves only Argen-
tina, Australia and the United States 1
to furnish the world with its wheat
and the supply is short. ,
"For that reason it Is improbable
that there will . be any permanent
drop of any "account In the price of
wheat and as a result in the price
of bread this year.
"Bakers have to buy their supplies
of flour at least three months in ad
vance. There is . not a baker in
Bridgeport who has not at least 90
days' supply on hand and some of
them much more. It is a physical
impossibility to make good bread out
of flour that' has not had an oppor
tunity to ripen. That can not be
done in less than three months.
"During fihe war, and for some time
after, the bakers were not allowed to
set their own .prices .on bread. Her
bert Hoover's department prevented
them from doing it. Not until they
could show that they had begun to
use the flour that cost them more
maney were they allowed to raise the
price. Four times this occurred. A
year altogether thebakers were kept
from realizing the profits of a rising
market as other lines of business were
doing. Now, having done that, it does
not seem as though they should be
expected to cut the price of bread
faster than they use up their present
stocks of flour and commence to use
"that bought at a lower price."
Frank Cunningham of the Steinert
Company said: "We are satisfied with
business and business conditions, Our.
business is fairly good and I do not
see any reason for thinking it is not
going to be. It can not be expected
that business Is going to always" be
just the same every month in the year
and every year 'in. concussion as the
boy said.
"The only people who need to be
anxious when a little lull in business
comes are the people who have over
borrowed or have made foolish
moves; who have over-played their
hand as it were. I Imagine that all
this wail of pessimism that we are
hearing comes from that class of bus
iness. ,"I do not think that any business
which has been managed on conser
vative lines has any reason for worry
ing at all. There is plenty of busi
ness to be had by going out after it.
In fact I think that a little slowing
up in business is a good thing for the
men engaged in it. ,
"For a spell back men In business
have Just been taking orders. People
have come in in large numbers ready
to buy and all a salesman had to do
was to name prices and write down
orders. Now he has to become a
salesman again; find out where the
potential business is, exercise his in
genuity and salesmanship in getting
at it, and making it actual. It is a
much more healthy condition.
"There is nothing - to be alarmed
over in this shutting down 01 lac
tones. It had to come and everyone
will be better off for it. During the
war period large numbers of men
without previous experience obtained
jobs at very high wages as mecnanics
and skilled workers. They are what
you might call weeds. They need to
be gotten rid of. The only way it
can be done is to shut down plants
and discriminate when re-employing
the men again.
"No in my opinion there is no rea
son for pessimism. If men will only
take an optimistic view or me sit.ua
tion and go out and create business
everything will be all right.'
M. B. Erlanger, District Manager
for the P. & Q. Organization, is of the
opinion that the downward trend of
prices has reached its limit and that
from now on they will be more or less
stable.
Mr. Erlanger, who had just come
from New York, said: All the mer
chants and manufacturers with whom
I talked seemed to agree that not only
are prices lower here but we are sell
ing goods at the lowest prices that
can be had for some time. c If there
are any reductions later, on in the
season they will he on left-overs and
less desirable goods, r The . public is
buying the cream of the merchants'.
stocks now and those who wait think
ing to get 'just as good' later on are
likely to be disappointed. Howard
Figg of the Department of Justice
has also said he felt that low prices
had now been obtained. . -
"Manufacturers and experts with
whom I came in contact seemed to be
of the opinion that merchants and re
tailers generally were giving the pub-
lie goods at prices which the econom
ics of the situation hardly warrants.
Goods In many cases are selling for
much less than the cost of produc
tion. "As manufacturers we are endeav
oring in every way possible to get
down to figures for next spring- and I
feel sure than spring prices will be
prettw nearlv on a level with those
prevailing this fall."
David Lustig, of Lustig's millinery
store, feels that "Everything will be
all right if all hands will get busy
and stop rocking the boat. I do not
believe there Is anything to be con
cerned over in the situation. All
there Is for merchants to do here in
Bridgeport is to watch the New York
market -and when that drops, drop
with it, and take losses if necessary.
Of course, a man in Business can
no more expect to go on and, never
take a loss any more than the public
can expect to never make a profit.
During these readjustment periods
losses have to be taken and the quick
er they are the quicker a merchant's
business will be in a shape to make
the profits he must have to stay in
business and pay his bills. We took
our medicine last week- and a good
dose of it, too. 1 .am looking for a
heavy business the last two weeks
before Christmas. It is unfortunate
for it to come that way for it is less
satisfactory to both the merchant and
the "customer, but tf it comes that
way we will have to do the best we
can.". , ,
. Frank Todd, of the firm of Reid
and Todd, said "I do not see any
reason why we should not ha.ve a
good -season. I look for as good a
year as we had last ySar."
DR. BURNS DID
NOT TAKE BODY
OUT BY COAL HOLE
(Continued from Page One.) .
cident has been the direct cause of a
grave injustice to men who would
not under any circumstances have
permitted the body of a faithful em
ployee to be treated except "with the
utmost dignity and respect.
The officials of the City National
Bank did not cause the body to be re
moved, through a coal hole It was
not removed through a coal hole, but
Dy an adjacent broad stairway, by the
best and most convenient and most
efficient means.
The police reported asvpart of their
investigation that Dr. Burns now says
that he knows tof no dereliction of duty
on the pnrt of the police. He saw
two or three policemen there. They
were keeping the crowd back, and he
did not ask them for any other as
sistance.' The Times reporter who took the
fac's from Dr. Burns, was skeptical
about the term 'coal hole." He says:
"I was in doubt, and I went back to
Dr. Burns, and asked him if lie meant
coal hole, and if that was correct.
Dr. Burns said- that was correct. He
appeared to be vexed, and lie Is Ptill

made an honorary member of Salaam

FROM PRODUCER
TO CONSUMER
OBITUARY
IT IS NOT the longest recommen
dation that necessarily repre
sents the most profound conse
quences. President Wilson renews a
suggestion, made to congress in a
previous message. He says:
"It would be most serviceable
if it were provided that all goods
released from cold storage or in
terstate shipment should have
plainly marked upon each pack
age the selling or market price
at which they went into storage.
In order that the purchaser might
be able to learn what profits
stood between him and the pro
ducer, or the wholesale dealer.
Indeed it would be very service
able to the public if all goods
destined for interstate commerce
were made to carry upon every
packing case whose form made it
possible a plain statement of the
price at whioii they left the
hands of the producer."
This simple recommendation if put
into law and efficiently executed
would probably do more to regulate
prices and make the transition from
the producer to the consumer one of
fewest profits. That congress paid
practically no attention to this pro
posal when it was first given is sub
stastlal evidence that the peoples rep
resentatives have yielded no more
lip service to sound principles of
trade.
