CANAL TREATY IS RATIFIED
SENATE PASSES IT BY DECISIVE
VOTE OF 79 TO 0.
Action Taken In Executive Session
Shortly Before Five O'clock Yesterday
Afternoon Bacon, Blackbnrn, Cal
binon, Mallory, Teller and Tillman
the Six Men Who Toted Against the
Convention.
"Washington, Dec, 16. The senate to
day ratified the Hay-Pauneefote isth
nilan canal treaty by tha decisive vote
of 72 to 6. The vote was reached i
few minutes before 5 o'clock, after al
most five hours' discussion behind
closed doors. There were no sensation
al Incidents during the entire time. The
debate was confined exclusively to
discussion of the merits of the agree
ment and the policy of its provisions.
a he principal speech or the day was
made by Senator Teller in oppostion to
the treaty and he was followed in rapid
succession by twelve or fifteen other
senators who spoke briefly either for or
against the motion to ratify.
Among the other speakers of the day
were Senators Clay, Fairbanks, Mc
Cumber, McLaurin of Mississippl.-Cul
berson, Mallory, Mason, Tillman, Bacon
and Bate. Senator Clay was one of the
southern sentors who epoke in advoca
cy of the treaty. He contended that
the treaty should be ratified because It
secured abrogation of the Clayton-Bul-
wer treaty.
Senator Mason made a strong plea
for the treaty, expressing his gratiflca
tion that American diplomacy had suc
succeeded in securing such a triumph as
was this treaty over the original Hay
Pauneefote agreement. Senator Bacon's
, speech was made in connection with a
motion to amend the treaty. In pre
senting this amendment he said he was
in favor of a canal and would vote for
the treaty with the Davis amendment.
He said he opposed the' treaty because
he did not believe it would give the
United States full control of the canal.
He said that Great Britain rejected the
amended Hay-Pauncefote treaty but
sent us another treaty about Identical
with the former treaty as mended, ex
cept as regards the Davis amendment.
He considered that fact the most im
portant feature of the whole contro
ersy. There was an exceptionally full sen
ate when the time arrived for a vote,
but the certainty of ratflcation had be
come so apparent that there was com
paratively little interest in the. pro
ceedings. The votes on the amend
ments succeeded each other quickly.
Senator Culberson offered an amend
ment to Insert the Davis fortification
amendment of the last session. This
was defeated, 15 to 62.
Senator Bacon then offered an
amendment striking out the preamble
in reference to the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty the words "without impairing
the general principle of neutralization
established in Article VIII of that con
vention;' also the followins: words in
Article II, relating to the purchase of
stock, "subject to the provisions of the
present treaty;" also all of Article III,
relating to the neutralization of the
canal; also all of Article IV, declaring
against change of territorial sovereign
ty. All of this was embodied in one
amendment and defeated, 18 to 60.
The treaty then was ratified by a vote
of 72 to 6 as follows:
Yeas Aldrich, Allison. Bard, Bate,
Berry, Beveridge, Burnham, Burrows,
Burton, Carmack, Clapp, Clark (Mont.),

RESIGNATIONS IN GERMAN ARMY.
Further Proof of Kolnei'i Determina
tion to Suppress Duelling.
Berlin, Dec. 1G. Count von Eulen
berg, grand court marshal of Prussia
and commander of the first division of
infantry, has resigned from the army.
It is understood that Count von Eu
lenberg's action is a result of the Blas-kowitz-Hildebrand
duel. This, together
with the recent resignation of General
von Alten, commander of another East
Prussian infantry division, is taken to
mean that Emperor William is reso
lutely determined to suppress duelling
except under the most unusual condi
tions. These forced retirements of Germany
army officers of high rank have natur
ally 'excited lively discussion and con
siderable disapproval in military circles.

PROF. ATWATER ON ALCOHOL
STILL MAINTAINS IT IS A FUEL FOR
THE BODY.
Injury from Wrong Dietary Habits
Greater Than That from Excessive
Use of Alcohol line of the Stimulant
in Disease Does Not Require Diges
tion, It Is Easily Assimilated and Af
fords Heat and IHnscular Power lis
Abuse.
Hartford, Dec. 16. At a meeting of
the Hartford Medical society this even
ing, Professor W. O. Atwater, of Wes
leyan university, gave an address on
The Nutritive Values of Ordinary
Foods and Alcohol," reviewing the re
sults of late experimental inquiry. Ha
described the Investigations on food
and nutrition which are being carried
out under the auspices of the United
States department of agriculture, by
authority of congress and with aid from
the treasury, at universities, colleges
and experiment stations and in connec
tion with philanthropic organizations
JfAVAL ARCH rRO.Tt.CT GIVEN VP
Dissensions In Navy us Result of Schley
Trial the Cause.
New York, Dec. 16. Park Benjamin,
president of the Naval Arch commis
sion, the organization having charge of
the proposed naval arch and water gate
at the Battery in this city, announced
to-day that the project has been given
tip, for the present at least. The arclv
and gate were to have cost $1,300,000,
and $500,000 had aliady been pledged.
Mr. Benjamin madlPthe announcement
after a conference with Colonel It. M.
Thompson, treasurer of the finance
committee, saying in part:
"Colonel Thompson and I are agreed
that work on the naval arch project
must stop. We are of the opinion that
the outcome of the Schley triR.l reveals
do much dissension, even in the high
est ranks of the navy, and is bound to
reopen so many other matters for argu
ment and dispute, that it would be al-
together inexpedient at the present time
to do anything further in the matter.
!A model of the proposed arch has been
built, complete in all its detaib, at the
expense of Colonel Thompson. He in
forms me of his intention, with the con
sent of the proper authorities, to place
It in the Metropolitan Museum of Art

York of what might be done by the Na
val Arch association, and which I sin

Will be able to do."
in different parts of the country, liter
ally from Maine to California and from
Minnesota to Alabama.
The speaker also dwelt upon errors
In the dietary habits. The opinion of
many physicians that, taking the coun
try at large, the injury that comes
from wrong dietary habits is, on the
whole, greater than that from the ex
cessive use of alcohol, finds a good
deal of support in these inquiries. They
emphasize, aiso, the need of mora
Wilful cooking. The movement to
ward the teaching of such subjects In
our public schools is one of the hope
ful signs of the times.
Coming to the subject of alcohol, Pro
fessor Atwater referred to the large
amount of experimental inquiry which
has been devoted to the subject in the
United States and especially in Europe
in later years. The final conclusion is
that while alcohol cannot biSld up the
bodily machine and repair it as it is
worn out, it can and does serve as fuel
for the body. Taken in excess, how
ever, its well known action upon the
nervous system is euch as to counter
act its nutritive effect. The terrible re
sults of long continued excess are too
well known to require comment.
Professor Atwater also spoke of the
use of alcohol in disease. It does not
require digestion, it is easily assimi
lated, It contains a large amount of en
ergy for supply of fat and muscular
power and thus, from the standponit of
the physiological chemist, seems espe
cially fitted to help the body to tide
over a time of stress. But it will not do
to forget that it is one of those things
which may be very useful and also very
harmful.
Professor Atwater emphasized his be
lief that In the past alcohol has been
prescribed by physicians to an extent
which, on the whole, was not desirable.
Former British Premier's Long Ex
pected and Much Heralded Speech lie
voted Mostly to an Attack on the Gov
eminent and to Advloe to the Liberal
Party Signs of Ittberal Convalescence
Attltnde Toward War Goes so Far
as to Place Himself at Disposal of the
Country.
Chesterfield, Eng., Dec. 16.Lord
Rosebery's long expected and much
heralded speech delivered here to-night
was received with marked enthusiasm
by an Immense crowd. It can hardly
be said to have thrown much light
along the pathway of the Liberal party.
That the speech was a finished ora
torical effort was amply testified to by
the frequent applause with which the
speaker was interrupted.
lie eaid he had come by Invitation
and did not wish to indulge in phrase
ology, but to speak his mind and offer
the Liberals some dispassionate advice.
The Liberal party, he continued, had
passed through a long and trying ill
ness, but was now approaching conval
escence, one of the signs of which was
that it had gotten rid of the Irish alli
ance. The Liberal party must now re
gain unity, though he would not pre
tend to advise just how this should be
done.
In urging his fellow Liberals to re
organize Lord Rosebery quoted the fol
lowing words from the message of
President Roosevelt:
"We hope to keep going by alow
steps, not by bounds. We must keep
our eyes on the stars, but we must also
remember that our feet are on the
ground."
The- following was the tenor of the
former premier's speech:
The ministry was wrong but the Lib
erals should be very careful how they
tried to set it right.
Turing from the Immediate outbreak
of the war Lord Rosebery touched upon
education, in which he said Great Brit
ain was woefully behind her sister na
tions. Her commercial development
was sadly atrop! led, said the speaker,
and the time would soon come when
Britain would be forced to fight for
trade supremacy. She would then be
as helpless as though armed with bows
and arrows.
Lord Rosebery maintained a discreet
vagueness on the question of his per
sonal inclinations concerning the lead
ership of the Liberal party. He said
he could not Imagine himself in the po
sition of a minister but in the next
breath he told how he would reorganize
the war office if it fell to his lot. He
said this reorganization, however,
should be postponed until after the
war and the speaker's receipt for the
proposed reorganization of this office
was a characteristically American one,
namely the appointment of a commission.
WILT, NOT SEND CHEW TO HENLEY
Pennsylvania Oarsmen Not to Go
Abroad Next Year.
Philadelphia, Dec. 16. Thomas Reath,
chairman of the University of Pennsyl
vania rowing committee, to-day made
the statement that the university
would not send a craw to England or
Ireland next year. Speaking of the let
ter received Friday from the Rublin
university officials quoting the invita
tion of Lord Chief Justice O'Brien to
compete in the Henley regatta, Mr.
Reath said: "The crew is formed and
trained for events here, and our races,
especially the intercollegiate race,
should not suffer. -V we were to send
a crew either to England or Ireland
next year we should have to send a
coach with the boys, and Ward's ser
vices are needed here too much to allow
him to depart. Then, again, we should
cripple our 'varsity crew not only for
the intercollegiate race, but for our
other races. The 'varsity crew would
be only a second crew, and Cornell, Co
lumbia and Wisconsin could hardly
look upon it as a compliment if we pit
ted a second crew against them."

GOVERNOR GRKOORY DEAD.
Rhode Island's Chief Executive Passes
Away at WlcUford.
Wickford, R. I., Dec. 16. William
Gregory, governor of Rhode Island,
died at his home here at 3:15 o'clock
this afternoon of acute Blight's disease,
following a succession of illnesses.
Governor Gregory, the twenty-nintll
governor under the constitution, was an
example of a self-made man. From a
loom fixer he became mill superintend
ent and finally owner of two worsted
mills. He was president of a national
bank and a director of several of the
foremost banking Institutions in the
state. Governor Gregory was born in
Astoria, L. I., Angust 3, 1S49, and re
ceived his early education in Westerly.
In 1875 he married Harriet Vaughan,
who, with her two children, survives
him.
Governor Gregory is the first gover
nor of Rhode Island to die while in
office.
AMI. ANARCHY LEGISLATION.
CESSION OF DANISH WEST INDIES.
Last Obslacles Reported to Have Been
Overcome.
Washington, Dec. 16. As a result of
the negotiations that have been in prog
ress between Secretary Hay and Mr.
Brun, the Danish minister, the last ob
stacle of consequence to the prepara
tion of the treaty of cession whereby
the United States will become possess
ed of the Danish West India Islands,
have been removed. It is said that the
points of difference have been adjusted
in a manner to ensure the pecoptance
of the treaty by the United States and
it is even possible that the convention
may be laid before that body before the
holiday recess. The decision of the su
preme court in the insular cases has
made easier the preparation of the
treaty on satisfactory lines, it is said.
House Appoints Committee Action by
the Senate.
Washington, Dec. 16. Chairman Ray
of the house committee on judiciary to
day appointed the special committee to
draft an anti-anarchy measure as fol
lows: Ray of New York, Jenkins of
Wisconsin, Overstreet of Indiana, Lit
tlcfield of Maine, republicans; and
I J.anham of Texas, Elliott of South Car
olina, Smith of Kentucky, and Fleming,
democrats. The special committee will
meet after the holidays, and in the
meantime the chairman will introduce
a measure which will be the basis of
the commlte action.
In the senate a resolution heretofore
offered by Mr. Vest of Missouri in
structing the committee on the judi
ciary to inquire into the subject of an
archy and to report to the senate a bill
or otherwise a constitutional method by
which congress may legislate for the
suppression of anarchy and for the con
trol of the anarchists, was adopted.
Excellent Addresses Made on Topics Re

Their Relation to the Present Splen

Blemllers Elected. '
The Forefathers' day meeting of the
New Haven Congregational club held
last evening was one of the club's most
Interesting meetings of the year. It
was held in Davenport Congregational
church, commencing at 6 o'clock. After
a half hour of social intercourse those
present, numbering 225, enjoyed a most
excellent supper served by the ladles of
the church. The menu comprised most
of the delicacies of the season.
Three new members Were elected to
the club Rev. Andrew Burns Chalm
ers, pastor of the Grand avenue Con
gregational church; Abnef N. Mclntyre
and Norman A. Tanner.
At the conclusion of the supper all re
paired to the auditorium of the church,
where the programme was most Inter

ganist, A. B. Clinton, and the opening
prayer Miss Sara Martin rendered in an

The first speaker of the evening was
Rev. John G. Davenport, D. D., pastor
of the Second church in Waterbury and
who is a lineal descendant of the first
pastor of the New Haven colony. , His
subject was "The Puritan in the Old
World." He confined himself, for the
most part, to a relation of the trials and
tribulations of the Puritans previous to
the time of their coming to this coun
try. He also told tow in the rule of
Elizabeth two laws were passed which
made her the virtual ruler of the church
and. all religions, and empowered her to
The Recommendations Made by the
Special Commllteo Failed to Secure a
Two-Thirds Vote A movement to
Secure Some Proposition for a New
Contract from the Water Company
Started by a Resolution of Anthony
Carroll.
The board of aldermen last night re
coh'ed the report of the special commit
tee on estimates recommending several
minor changes in the estimates as sub
mitted by the board of finance and
failed to adopt any of those recom
mendations. The appropriations made
by the board of finance will therefore
probably remain unchanged. 1
As soon as the board had been called
to order last night it was voted on mo
tion of Alderman Moyle to proceed at
once to a consideration of the estimate
committee's report. This report, which
was made up by a minority of the cqm
mittee, after a majority had voted in
favor of its recommendation was
hended,"Minoiity Report." The recom
mendations were that the item for
street sprinkling be amended to provide
that cars or carts might be used, that
the item for permanent pavements be
reduced from $1,000 to $200, that a new
item for $490 for placing new seats in
parks, that an item for $5,953,74 be in
serted in the lamp department esti
mates for contingent expenses, that the
item for $6,000 for East Rock park be
reduced to $500, that the appropriation
of $500 for Fourth of July celebration be
transferred to an item for band con
certs, that the appropriation for salary
of the clerk of the paving commission
be reduced from $200 to $50, and that
provision be made for payment from
the sundry account in the controller's
department of the expenses of revision
of the ordinances.
After the committee report had been
read President Hubbard stated that he
had received from Grand Army men a
! request that one of their representa
I tives be permitted to address the board
in relation to the East Rock park ap-
I propriation. The board voted to grant
I the request, and E. S. Wheeler, repra
sentrng a delegation from Admiral
Foote post appeared. He said that the
post had learned with astonishment
that the monument at the top of East
Rock was being neglected. He said that

SCHLEY'S Rl QUEST OR ANTED.
Long Olvrs Him Until Frliliiy to File
TCI 1 1 of Objections.
Washington, Dec. 16. Late In the day
Secretary Long acknowledged in a for
mal letter, the receipt of the request
from Admiral Schley for permission to
file a bill of objections. The secretary's
response was brief and purely formal.
It granted the request and allowed un
til Friday next in which to submit the
bill.
Schley's request was made in the
following communication to Secretary
Long:
"Washington, Dec. 16, 1901.
"Sir: I have the honor to most re
spectfully request that you withhold
your approval from the findings of the
court of inquiry recently held at the
navy yard in the city of Washington,
of which Admiral George Dewey was
president, until such time as I may
have an opportunity to file a statement
of objections therto and therefore re
quest that you do not dissolve the court

Herself In Steamer's stateroom.
New York, Dec. 16. Mrs. Una Perry,
a young and beautiful woman of thia
city, committed suicide in this city this
evening in a stateroom of the Fall
River steamer Priscllla just befortf the
steamer left for her sound trip.
Mrs. Perry purchased a ticket and
was assigned to a stateroom about an
hour before the Priscllla was scheduled
to leave. Within half an hour a stew
ardess found her body hanging by a
cord attached to a berth. The purser's
register showed that Mrs. Perry lived
on West Ninety-ninth street and word
was sent to the house. After the body
had been removed to the pier waiting
room the mother came. She was so
completely prostrated by the sight of
her dead daughter that little could be
learned from her of the motive of the
tragedy. It was gathered, however.
that some domestic trouble was at least
one of the moving causes,
Mrs, Una Perry was the daughter of
the late Wallace Redman, who was an
engineer in the United States navy and
for five years was well known in Wash
ington. Mrs. Redman came of a well
to-do family, that formerly lived in
New Milford, Conn. Their daughter
Una, who was twenty-eight years old,
had married when very young George
