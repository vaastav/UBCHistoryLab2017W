v President Roosevelt Transmits
Message to the Senate
Dealing With Critics of the Pan
ama Canal Transaction.
HE BLAMES PULITZER.
President Makes Clean Cut Con
vincing Statements.
Ought to Be Prosecuted for Li
beling the Government.
"Washington, Dec. 15. President
Roosevelt today sent to the senate a
statement concerning the purchase
of the Panama canal property by the
United States, denouncing in strong
language charges that there was any
thing wrong in the acquisition by the
United States of the canal property.
"These stories," he continues,
were first brought to my attention as
published in a paper in Indianapolis,
called 'The News' edited by Mr.
Delavan Smith. The stories were
scurrilous and libelous in character
and false in every essential par
ticular. Mr. Smith shelters himself
behind the excuse that he merely ac
cepted the statements which had ap
peared in a paper published in New
York 'The World' owned by Mr.
Joseph Pulitzer. It is idle to say that
the known character of Mr. Pulitzer
and his newspaper are such that the
statements in that paper will be be
lieved by nobody; unfortunately, thou
sands of people are ill-informed in
this respect and believe the state
ments they see printed, even though
they appear in a newspaper published
by Mr. Pulitzer."
Summarizing charges made in this
connection, the president says:
"These statements sometimes ap
peared in the editorials, sometimes in
the news columns, sometimes in the
shape of contributions from in
dividuals either unknown or known to
be of a bad character. They are false
In every particular from beginning to
end.
"The wickedness of the statements
Is only surpassed by their fatuity.
So utterly baseless are the. stories that
apparently they represent in part matt-rial
collected for campaign pur
poses and in part stories originally
concocted with a view of positive
blackmail.
Defends Man Assailed.
"The inventor of the story about
Mr. Charles P. Taft, for instance, evi
dently supposed that at some period
of the Panama purchase Mr. W." H.
Taft was secretary of war, whereas
!n reality Mr. W. H. Taft never be
came secretary of war until long af
ter the whole transaction In question
had been closed. The inventor of the
story about Mr. Douglas Robinson had
not taken the trouble to find out the
fact that Mr. Robinson had not had
the slightest connection directly or
Indirectly, of any kind or sort with
any phase of the Panama transaction
from beginning to end. The men
who attacked Mr. Root, in the mat
ter had not taken the trouble to read
the public document which would
have informed them that Mr. Root
had nothing to do with the purchase,
which was entirely arranged through
the department of justice under the
then attorney general Mr. Knox.
"Now, these stories as a matter of
fact need no investigation whatever.
No shadow of proof has been, or can
bo. produced In behalf of any of them.
They consist simply of a string of in
famous libels. In form they are part
libels upon individuals, upon Mr. Taft
and Mr. Robinson, for instance, but
they are in fact wholly, and in form
partly a libel upon the United States
government. I do not believe we
should concern ourselves with the
particular individuals who wrote the
lying and libelous editorials, articles
from correspondents or articles in
the news columns. The real offender
Is Mr. Joseph Pulitzer, editor and
proprietor of the World. While the
criminal offense of which Mr. Pulitzer
has been guilty Is in form a libel upon
Individuals the great injury done Is in
blackening the good name of the
American people. It should not be
left to a private citizen to sue Mr.
Pulitzer for libel. He should be
prosecuted for libel by the eovern-
Tnental authorities. In point of en-
ouragement of Inlauitv. in Doint of
lmamy, or wrong doing, there is noth
ing to choose between a public ser
vant who betrays his trust, a public
servant who is guilty of blackmail, or
theft, or financial dishonesty of any
kind, and a man guilty as Mr. Joseph
Pulitzer has been guilty in this in
stance. A National Duty.
"It is therefore a high national
duty to bring to justice this villifier of
the American people, this man who
wantonly and wickedly and without
one shadow of Justification seeks to
blacken the character of reputable
private citizens and to convict the
government of his own country in the
eyes of the civilized world of wrong
doing of the basest and foulest kind,
when he has not one shadow of
Justification of any sort, or description
for the charge he has made. The at
torney general has under considera
tion the form in which the proceed
ings against Mr. Pulitzer shall be
brought."
The president refers to various pa
pers which he transmits with his mes
sage and calls attention to numerous
utterances and acts relating to the
canal and its purchase. He cites the
act of congress by which he was au
thorized to pay $40,000,000 for the
canal property and says it was no con
cern of the president what the new
Panama Canal company did with the
money.
Explaining the method of conclud
ing the purchase, the president says:
"The Panama canal transaction was
' actually carried through not by either
the then secretary of state, Mr. John
Hay, or the then secretary of war, Mr
Elihu Root, both of whom, however
were cognizant of all the essential
features; but by the then attorney
general. Mr. P. C. Knox, at present
senator from Pennsylvania. I directed
or approved every action and am re
sponsible for all that was done in
carrying out the will of congress; and
the provisions of the law, enacted by
congress after exhaustive examination
and discussion, were scrupulously com.
filed with by the executive. While
the transaction was pending I saw Mr.
Cromwell but two or three times and
my communications with him were
limited to the exchange of purely
formal courtesies. Secretary Hay oc
casionally say him in the same man
ner; I doubt whether Mr. Root held
any conversation with him. The at
torney general saw him frequently as
he was counsel for the Panama com
pany, their communications were offi
cial as representing the two sides."
VVlioUy Uninfluenced.
' The action of the government, he
says, was wholly uninfluenced by any
question of who were or were not
stockholders either in the" new or the
old company.
"If as a matter of fact." he explains,
"the canal company, either or both,
had been owned by American citizens
or by citizens of any other nationality,
it would not have altered in the slight
est degree the action taken by this
government. Our concern was to get
the canal property which was owned
by the French company, and to see
that the title was clear. Our transac
tion was carried on openly and was
published in detail and we dealt solely
(so far as the interests of the old
Panama Canal company were con
cerned) with the liquidator appointed
by the proper French -governmental
body, the civil tribunal of the Seine
and it was the decree of this same
tribunal, with the new Panama Canal
company which also went into liquida
tion upon the sale to the United States.
All our transactions were carried on
openly and were published in detail."
The president states the money was
paid through the New York banking
house of J. P. Morgan & Co., acting as
fiscal agents of this government, into
the Bank of France, in Paris.
"In these navments." he says, "we
followed to the letter the decree of the

proceeds of sale was purely a question
for the civil tribunal of the Seine the
French governmental body, with which
this nation had nothing whatever to
do.
Nothing to Do "With Cromwell.
"Under these circumstances there was
not the slightest need for Mr. Cromwell
to give any information on the subject
of the companies for which he had been
counsel. This government has no con
cern with Mr. Cromwell's relation to
these companies or either of them, or
with the amount or nis proiessionai
compensation; it was not the affair
of this government to inquire who were
the security holders of the companies.
Nevertheless Mr. Cromwell, of his own
accord, has submitted to me together
with a copy of his statement published
on the 11th instant, and which I trans
mit herewith, a full list of the stock
holders of the new Panama Canal com
pany of France on January 15, 1900,
(numbering over 6,000) and a list of all
stockholders who were present at a
special meeting of the company held
February 28, 1902, immediately after the
cable offer of the company was made
to the United States. (January 9-11.
1902) to accept the appraisement of
$40,000,000 made by the Isthmian canal
commission and to sell for said sum
the Panama canal, concessions, and
other property and the shares of the
Panama Railroad company."
Referring to accompanying docu
ments, the president says no payment
will be made upon the stock of the
old Panama Canal company and he is
informed the payment on the bonded
indebtedness will be but ten per cent.
About 6.000 shareholders of the new
Panama company will receive pay
ment and they will recover their
original investment with annual in
terest of about three per cent.
"The accounts and records or tnis
liquidation which was concluded in
June last." he says "are on deposit
with the Credit Ljonnaise or .fans a.p
a proper custodian of the same ap
pointed upon such liquidation. Re
cently a request was made by a pri-
vate individual to inspect the records! cob van Heemskerk observed the "23
of these payments, but answer was J De Mayo" in the offing, took posses
made by the custodians that they saw sion of her and sent a prize crew
no proper reason for granting such I aboard. . The Venezuelan crew which
request to a stranger, and inasmuch j had been in charge of the "23 De
as there is not the slightest ground i Mayo" was sent ashore In the small
for suspicion of any bad faith in the i boats of the captured ship. The Van
transaction it hardly seems worth Heemskerk then proceeded back to
while to make the request; but if the
congress desires I have no doubt that
on the request of our ambassador; in
Paris the lists of individuals will be
shown him.
'As a matter of fact, there is noth
ing whatever in which this govern
ment is interested to investigate about
this transaction. So far as this gov
ernment is concerned every step of
the slightest importance has been
made public by its executive and every
step taken in France has there been
made public by the proper officials."

STATE OF REAL WAR
Exists Between the Castro Gov
ernment and Holland.
There Is Not a Yankee Warship
in the Neighborhood.
Washington, Dec. 15. The exist
ence of what amounts practically to
a state of war between Holland and
Venezuela, the absence for the first
time in many years in an acute crisis
of this kind of American warships
from their proper sphere of influence;
and the profession by the state depart
ment officials of their ignorance of
the intentions of Holland, constitute a
most curious and interesting inter
national situation. The fact that
America has a quarrel of her own
,1 i t Vi VAtic.iiila arrt had

jii,Q ..i.tmno nih that r.n,,ntrv
: ,ves u t doubt as to tne accuracy
.......
. n th existence of anv formal
agreement between America and The
Netherlands, the government of the
latter country is proceeding with the
consent of America, to bring to an end
the chaotic conditions that have pre
vailed in an international sense in
: Venezuela for the past two years.
So long as the Dutch ships act
! strictly within the lines of the Mon-
: roe doctrine as construed ln the an.
, nual me e to con&ress of Presl
as no attempt Is made to seize
Venezuelan ships, the blockade of
PrtS and the attempt to redress the
affront to Holland's honor there
w! be no interference on
ment. Of course it is inconceivable
that this government has not already
received some assurances from Hol
land on this point, but it is probably
the case that these have not been re
duced to writing but are simply mat
ters of mutual understanding.
The experience of the allied powers
who operated against Venezuela sev
eral years ago, would seem to have
indicated to Holland the necessity of
coming to some understanding with
the United States before proceeding
, to the point of actual hostilities, which
after all is the situation on the
Venezuelan coast notwithstanding
diplomatic disclaimers.
Logically, the next step will be the
declaration of a blockade, and of this
due notice must be given by Holland
to all maritime nations in order to
prevent the lodgment of claims for
unwarrantable injury Inflicted upon
neutral commerce. Meanwhile the ac
tion of the Dutch cruisers in seizing
Venezuelan ships is calculated to have
a depressing effect upon the trade of
Venezuela and to discourage prospec
tive shipments of merchandise in the
present unsettled conditions.
Dutch Take Another Vessel.
Willemstad. Dec. 15. The Dutch
battleship Jacob Van Heemskerk ar
rived in the harbor at 8 o'clock this
morning towing as a prize the Vene
zuelan coast guard vessel "2 3 De
Mayo." Word of the capture had al
ready been received here and a great
throng of people lined the docks to
w itness the entrance of the Dutch bat
tleship conducting her capture within
the harbor.
The flag of the Netherlands had
been hoisted to the peak of the cap
tured Venezuelan coast guardship,
and. astern the Dutch flag floated the
Venezuelan colors. Although the Ven
ezuelan flag was still shown It was in
minor contrast to the Dutch pennant
flying from main mast and foremast,
both of the warship and its prize.
The capture of the "23 De Mayo'
was effected on December 13, at a
point a little north of Cumana on the
Gulf of Curacoa. The battleship Ja-
this port, escorting her prize.
The Dutch cruiser Gelderland left
here yesterday for the Venezuelan
coast. She had on board a seaman
thoroughly acquainted with the small
bays and inlets along the Venezuelan
shore.
The "23 De Mayo." while classed as
a coast guard vessel, is a unit of the
Venezuelan navy, but her size and
etrtkncrtVi are lnsiffnifinTit fa rt
130 tons and Is armed with one ma
chine gun.
She is after the Venezuelan torpedo
boat Margarita, a steel vessel of 97
tons and armed with four three
pounders and two torpedo tubes. The
vessel is supposed to be at the island
of Margarita.
The Jacob Van Heemskerk will
leave here tomorrow to resume her
patrol service on the coast.
RUNOUT OF TOWN.
Schlatter Leaves Macomb, 111., Pursued
by a Mob.
Macomb, 111., Dec. 15. Declaring at
a meeting here that President McKin
ley was an anarchist, that he had
turned more people loose to prey on
society than any man ln the world and
that the assassination of McKinley was
all right excepting that it did not hap
pen soon enough, the self styled "Di
vine Healer" Schlatter only escaped
personal violence from a mob through
intervention of the police. The officers
escorted Schlatter to a hotel and to the
first train out of town, followed by a
mob of citizens threatening violence if
he did not leave at once.

Madison and Campbell Toted
Against Uncle Joe.
Washington, Dec. 15. At the outset of
the proceedings In the house today the
roll was called on a motion by Mr.
Gardner, Republican, Massachusetts, to
discharge the committee on foreign af
fairs from further consideration of the
resolution calling on the secretary of
state for a statement as to whether he
has in his possession Information as to
whether or not the British house of
commons has appointed a committee to
report on the advisability of changing
its rules and that the resolution be con
sidered by the house.
Mr. Gardner is one of several so-called
"insurgents" who believe that the
rules of the house of representatives
should be changed. :
The motion of Mr. Gardner prevailed,
146 to 134, and thereupon he offered an
amendment eliminating all reference to
the demand on the secretary of state for
information and leaving in the reso
lution simply the provision for the ap
pointment of eight members to report
on the question of revising the rules.
Messrs. Payne, New York, Dalzell,
Pennsylvania, were quickly on their
feet with noints of order, both insist
ing that as a portion of the resolution
would be stricken out the resolution no
loneer privileged.
Against that contention Mr. Gardner
vigorously arrayed himseii ana ne citea
several precedents to support his argu
ment. With equal vigor. Mr. Fitzgerald,
(Dem.) New York, upheld the conten
tion of Mr. Gardner.
In an elaborate opinion, the speaker
sustained Messrs. Dalzell and Payne,
holding that the : character of the
resolution had been changed in such
a way. as to render it non-privileged.
Air. Gardner promptly appealed
but, alert to the importance of the
proposition, Mr. Payne moved to lay
the appeal on the table and on that
motion a roll call was forced.
By a vote of yeas 149, noes 136,
present 4, the speaker was sustained.
Twenty Republicans voted against
the speaker as follows:
Boyd, Neb.; Campbell, Kan.; Caul
field, Mo.; Cooper, Wis.; Davis, Minn.;
Ellis, Mo.; Fowler, piew Jersey; Gard
ner, Mass.; Gronn, 1 N. D. ; Howland,
Ohio; Hubbard. West -Virginia; Lind
berg, Minn.; McKinley, Cal.; Madison,
Kan.; Nelson, Minn.; Nye, Minn.;
Pearr, Md.; Pollard, Neb.; Sturgis,
W. Va.; Colstead, Minn.
The resolution then on motion of
Mr. Gardner, after he had further at
tacked the rules of the house was laid
on the table 137 to 4 2 which has the
effect of killing the whole proposition.
A NEW TOPEKA FACTORY
McDonald Sliirt Company Operating
New Plant Here.
The R. I. McDonald Manufacturing
company, a new enterprise, which man
ufactures shirts in wholesale quanti
ties 4s an institution that opened its
doors in Topeka for the first time Mon
day morning. The new establishment
is quartered in the rooms formerly oc
cupied by the Mail and Breeze at Fifth
and Jackson streets.
This is a branch of a St. Joseph in
stitution that has been contemplating
opening a Topeka establishment for I
some time. A few weeks ago Mr. Mc-
Donald, the president and manager of i
the company, came to Topeka, and 1
placed an ad in the State Journal ask
ing that a hundred girls report for
work. One hundred and seventeen girls
replied to the ad. The number and
quality of the applicants was all that
was needed to induce the company to
come here.
A. B. Poole, secretary of the Com
mercial club, had been after the insti
tution for several months and much
credit belongs to this organization for
getting the company here.
At the present time, but 25 girls are
employed. Others will be added just as
soon as the present force can be put
into good working order and the full
hundred asked for will be given work
Just as soon as they can conveniently be
broken in to the work. Most of the
work of cutting will be done in St.
Joseph for a while, but will later be
transferred to Topeka. Tn the mean
time the local factory will content it
self with sewing the garments. A. O.
Vaughn, of St. Joseph, is manager of
the Topeka branch house.
WANT A FLAT RATE.
Window Glass Workers Demand In
crease of 25 Per Cent.
Cleveland, Dec. 15. A general in
crease of practically 25 per cent on
their wage scale, to take effect Decem
ber 19 next, will be demanded by the
National Window Glass Workers.
A. F. Faulkner, president of the
union, said today that the members
would make the fight of their lives in
order to obtain the higher rate of com
pensation. The new scale was announced today
at the close of a five days' session of
the national scale committee of the
union. It will affect every window
glass factory in the United States, both
hand and machine, and includes 7,000
skilled employes.
A fiat rate is provided in the new
scale instead of the present sliding
scale whereby wages are affected by
business conditions.
Shoulder Straps for Young Roosevelt

appointment of Theodore Roosevelt.
Jr., as an aide de camp on his staff
with the rank of major.
ROOSEVELT TELLS
The President Himself Made an
Investigation
To Find Out "Who Got the Mon
ey" in Canal Deal.
WHOLE TRANSACTION
Is Found to Be "As Clean as a
Hound's Tooth."
Information Gained Was Made
Basis of His Message.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 15. President
Roosevelt's special message, sent in
these dispatches tells clearly and point
edly "who got the money" which the
United States paid for the Panama ca
nal. He has the full Information in his
possession, in the shape of certified
copies of the records of the new Pan
ama canal companies, taken from the
books in Paris for William Nelson
Cromwell, the attorney for the com
pany, who negotiated the sale to this
country. Cromwell got $220,000 for his
work. His fee was passed upon by
the French court.
With this information the president
submits caustic remarks concerning the
New York World and what it has said
repeatedly about his part in the pur
chase of the canal.
No American Stockholders.
The information in the president's
possession shows that no Americans
were concerned in the purchase of the
canal property by this government.
There are no American names in the
long list of stockholders of the New
Panama Canal company. There are,
however, the names of certain banks
which received some money in the final
liquidation of the company's affairs.
It is, of course, possible that Ameri
cans might have been interested in the
money thus paid to banks by the liqui
dators, but the total sum so distributed
was so small that even if Americans
were the ultimate receivers of it they
did not profit much by their transac
tion. No Speculation in "Panama."
It is made certain by this information
that there was no general speculation
on a large scale by Americans in the
shares of the new Panama canal. It
was concerning only the shares of this
company that any allegation or insin
uation of such speculation by Ameri
cans has been made. There was never
any such question regarding the shares
of the old Panama Canal company,
which were distributed among many
holders.
ln the course - of the investigation
made by the New York Times last week
concerning the papers bearing on. the
canal purchase now in the possession of
the war, state and justice departments
here. It was found that there was noth
ing to show what final distribution was
made of the money paid to the French
companies. .
Roosevelt's Vigorous and Successful
Search.
Thereupon President Roosevelt vig
orously undertook to secure such infor
mation. He had exhaustive searches
made in the files of the departments,
and cabled to the isthmus to ascertain
if anything among the papers of the
canal commission on file there would
disclose the facts he sought. He also
called on Senator Knox, who, as attor
ney general at the time of the canal
purchase, conducted the proceedings
leading to the formal transfer of the
property, after having made a thorough
examination of the title of the French
companies to it, and their power to dis
pose of It.
Cromwell Sent the Papers.
Senator Knox replied that the govern
ment had never had in its possession
anything which would show the facts
desired by the president. He himself
had not considered it necessary to se
cure such information. "We bought the
property not the company," said Sen
ator Knox, "and therefore we never had
the stock ledgers or transfer books or
even a list of the stockholders." The
publication of the fact that the presi
dent was making such an investigation
brought It to the notice of William Nel
son Cromwell in New York and he sent
one of his confidential men to Washing
ton with all the papers, w-hich were
duly delivered to the president last
week. i 1
"Clean as Hound's Tooth."
Since then the papers have been ex
amined carefully by several officials of
the administration, including Secretary
Root and the solicitor general of the
department of justice, Mr. Hoyt. They
show, as has been said, that the 40
million dollars paid by the United
States for the canal property went al
most entirely to French citizens. In
the language of an administration
official who has examined the docu
ments they demonstrate that the whole
transaction "w-as as clean as a hound's
tooth." ,
There have been numerous confer
ences at the White House since the
papers were placed in the hands of
the Dresident and several senators and
representatives in the confidence of the
White House were informed of what
was coming. It was this circumstance
w-hich gave rise in the last few days to
the several rumors that the president
was preparing a message on the sub
ject of the canal purchase. He has
been preparing such a message, but it
was not guessed by the rumor mongers
that it would contain the sort of in
formation which it will deliver to con
gress. . .
Roosevelt Gets Quick Returns.
The president was very much elated
at obtaining the Information, especial
ly at a time when the publication of
his letter to William Dudley Foulke
regrading the Insinuations of the New
York World and the Indianapolis
News had given rise to such a gen
eral demand for an Investigation by
congress aimed at disclosing the very
information he now will make public.
The continued agitation of these and
other newspapers for an official inves
tigation by congress has kept the
president's anger at them from cooling
down, and that accounts in part for
the compliments which he pays the
New York World in the special mes
sage. Weather Indications.
Chicago, Dec. 15. Forecast for
Kansas: Rain or snow lata tonight or

DEFENDS OUR SHIPS.
Bob Evans Says New Fifrhtlng Ma
chines Superior to Dreadnaughts.
New York, Dec' 15. That the latest
battleships built by this country are
vastly superior to England's Dread
naught, is emphatically stated by Rear
Admiral Robley D. Evans ln a maga
zine article wherein he strongly de
fends the American navy and replies to
criticisms of it made some time ago
by Henry Reuterdahl and others.
"I do not for a moment claim that
the Indiana and her sister ships are
equal to the Dreadnaught of the Eng
lish navy," he says, "only that she is
the equal of the English ship designed
at the same time. But I do claim that
our latest ships are vastly superior to
the Dreadnaught and I believe that
every fighting man who has given the
subject intelligent consideration will
agree with me."

SIX INTHE BOX.
Chances Good for Completing
Hains Jury Today.
Court Says That Members Will
Sot Be Locked Up.
TRIAL TO BE SHORT.
Probably Will Be Concluded
Early Next Week.
Defendant Comes In Manacled to
a Deputy Sheriff.
Flushing, L. I., Dec. 15. With six
jurors In the Jury box; and counsel
for both sides hopeful that the other
six may be selected during the first
session of court the state's case
against Thornton J. Hains, charged as
an accessory to his brother. Captain
Peter C. Hains. jr., in the killing of
William E. Annis, at the Bayside
Yacht club last summer, is likely to be
presented in court today. Tho de
cision last night of Justice Crane not
to lock up the Jury has removed a fear
among talesmen that if selected to
act in the case they might be locked
up over Christmas. ;
"Considering the prominence of the
case I think we have made extremely
good time in the selection of six
jurors." said John F. Mclntyre. chief
of Hains counsel, today, "and now
that the talesmen know that they
won't be locked up in a room over
night and perhaps through Christmas,
I think we will be able to fill the jury
box very quickly. With regard to a
subpoena issued by the district at
torney demanding that I produce in
court all papers in the case, includ
ing those that have passed between m.v
client and myself I want to say that
I will go to jail first."
Mr. Mclntyre expressed the opinion
that the trial would probably be con
cluded early next week.
An Inkling of one of the points of
Hains's defense was contained in an
Interrogation to a talesman during
the session of court last night.
Hains's counsel will endeavor to show
that the defendant's action in drawing
a. revolver when Captain Hains shot
Annis was taken in defense of his
brother, over whom he had been
made guardian by the Hains family.
An additional panel of 100 tales
men, drawn last night, filled the trial
room to overflowing today and when
Thornton Hains was brought into
court, his wrist locked with steel to
a deputy sheriff he had to edge his
way through the throng. Haines
does not like being manacled to a
deputy sheriff, declaring that he
tunltr "0t escape lf Klve" the oppor-
T.i!!T5e7 .c.OUId turn hlm out of Lo
island Jail every morning unattended
ana he would come immediately to
court." said Mr. Mclntyre.

the events that transpired from the
time of tho arrival nt tti. utn w .

caused today when it was developed
that William F HkpV.f v, ...

lntyre said he would ask the county
Judge to have the order vacated.
The examination of talesmen was
then resumed and Mr. White aa spec
ial prosecutor, undertook the ques
tioning of talesmen.
Of the first six talesmen examined
some had fixed and definite opinions
of the case, one had a prejudice
against the carrying of fire arms and
another failed to comprehend th
character of counsel's questions and
ten pleaded Illness.
The seventh talesman examined.
Alexander Jardin, a plumber, of Long
Island City, was selected aa - the
seventh Juror In the case. Up to a
