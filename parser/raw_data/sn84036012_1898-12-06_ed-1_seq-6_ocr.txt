---as f Mark Hanna or somebxody nad
gone over the manuscript with a blue
en.il, striking out everything that
coald possiAybe constrmed as a sentence
or classe committing the president to an
Idea. The subject that is uppermost in
the mlads of the people, the govern
znent and disposition of the Philippines,
s polUtely dismissed with a wave of the
hand. The president eagerly avatle
himself of the excuse that the treaty
of peace between the United States and
Spaln. although agreed upon. has nt
peen signed. sealed and delivered, tandl
that therefore a promulgation at this
time of his views regarding the man
agement of the Philippines would Ie
premature and fraught with bad last,.
He generously Intimates that w hen. the
treaty is ready for formal ratification.
he may favor congress with a few re
marks; but until then his sphinx-lik.
attitude will be maintained and th"

cupation for a long time to come. The
president treats our foreign relations
and the more or less unimportant die.
putes that have arisen between the
United States and other nations. In a
spirit of fairness and thoroughness. As
to the Nicaragua canal the president
dwells upon the circumstances that
"suggest the urgency of some definite
action by the congress at this session if
the labors of the past are to be utilised
and the linking of the Atlantic and Pa
cfic oceans by a practrial waterway is
to be realized." The president ex
presses the hope that our exhibit at the
Parts exposition shall "rank among the
first in that unparalleled competition
of artistic and inventl. e production.
and thus counter-balance the disad
vantage with which w, start as com
pared allh other countries whosP ap

Hawaiian affairs aie treated in a
purely historical way Tie czar's peace
rroposal is lauded The annual report
of the secretary of the treasury is sum
marized and the question of "currency
reform" is brought up In a mild sort of
fashion. the president renewing the
recomnmendation he made in his annual
message of 1191 "that when any of the
1'nlted States notes are presented for
reemption and are redeemed in gold.
such notes shall be kept and set apart
and only paid out In exchange for gold."
The president then Indulges In some
gl;ttcring generalities as to the curren
cy and luminously suggests that "the
subject in all Its parts is commended
to the wise consilderatihn of the ren.
gress."
The president endorses the prqoposl
lion to Increase the standing arnmy to
100.000 men, and declares his purpose
"to muster out the entire v. lunteer
army as soon as the congresps shall pro
lide for the Increase of the regular es
tabllshment. ThlI slll I he only ain art
of justice and will be much appreciateed
by the brave men who left their homes
and employments to help their country
In an emergency." On the remodeling
of the military service there is not
a word. As to the pension
rll. the president gives a few gRneral
facts and figures. but offers no recom
mendations-the penInsinc bring another
live theme which the president seems
afraid to touch. Thb' work of the ,"v

for a tl|anilh-Amertian overnment.
The un.it, was u-hercd in by elaborate
celebrations at Amapels on November
1. Under the pr..psed form of gov
ernment the adminltratloa was to pass
into the control of a representative
from each of the three republics-Dr.
Salvador Collego. of Salvador; Senor
Miguel Agelugarte,. of Rondura,. and
Manuel Coerrorel Matus, of Nicaragua.
These were to continue in power until
March 14 next. when they were to elect
a president of the United States of Cen
tral America. to hold olice four years.
It was understood that the three states
had virtually agreed upon Senor J.
Roes Pacose. of Salvador. for the ex
erutive chair. In the meantime the
prelidents of the three republics were
to assume the grade of governors, and
there was to be an election in Salvador.
where the principal gubernatorial aspi
rants were General 'Thomas Regalado.
Horaclo Vllevlicencal and Carlos Me
lendes, the first named being tile mo t
popular candidate. The people of Sal
vador were fearful that the hlurden of
the expense for the federal government
,.ould fall upon them. and General Re
galad,, headed an Insurrection which
Niicaragua declined to put down and
which HIonduras could not put down.
So the' United States of Central Amer
ica are dissolved.
SHE trial of Margaret E. Cody.
charged with the attempt
ed blackmail of the Jay
Gould heirs. Is in progress at
Albany. N. Y. Jay Gould, by the
humbleness of his origin became a
shining mark for blackmailers. The
story with which Mrs. Cody undertook
to "do" the Gould heirs out of a small
fortune was not lacklng in plausibility.
She presented a Mrs. Angell as the wid
ow of Jay Gould. whom she as
serted the millionaire had married
when he was a poor young fellow. Mrs.
Angell had had a daughter by Jay
Glould. So. at ieast. she said. But while
the case was pending Mrs. Angell's
nerve deserted her and she made ;:n
affidavit confessing the fraud of the
whole scheme, and implicating Mrs.
Cody In it. Hence the arrest and trial
of Margaret E. Cudy. If the facts are
what they have been stated to be. Mrs.
Cody ought to we retired a few years.

To-night pure and spsrkliag comedy
will bold forth at the Margart theater.
when "Ton Tonson" will be ee, whickh.
by the way. is the first time the play
hia been in Awncond& for six years
and where it has always been popaglar.
Its rendition by Ben Hendricks and
a select company under the manage
ment of Jacob Att. Is said to be receiv
ed with delighted approval. It is mid
that Hendricks in the character of the
Swede portrays very successfully the
sterling honesty and Instinctive sense
of right and justice so often found
among that people. The play. as here
tofore, wilt be given a marvelous scen
lc production, and the thrilling logl-am
scene In act second is one of the main
features. The company this season
comprises several well-known people
besides Hendricks. including Beatrice
Norman. Belle Francis. Oeorgie Bry
ton. E.dward J. Mack, George A. Wel
ler and E. H. Bender. incidental to
act second. the famous Lumb,'rman't
quarte'te, composed of Messrs. Scott.
Earl, I.owles and Lynn. and who have

Comedy Four. will render new and ap
propriate songs. Taken altogether.
"Y,n Yonson" should prove a big win

"Sewing the Wind."
If there were not a number of more
or less good flays now before the pub

of the sexual law. "Bowing the Wind."
by Sydney Grundy, would mark an
epoch in dramatic literature. As it is,
it is said to be the greatest and admit
tedly the cleanest of them all. It han
dles a great question boldly. yet with
the utmost delicacy, garnished w'th the
trace of superlatively excellent English
and devoid of offensive flippancy. Few
plays of the generation have given so
strong evidence of power to falscinte,
interest and hold the play-going public.
We will understand the reason when
