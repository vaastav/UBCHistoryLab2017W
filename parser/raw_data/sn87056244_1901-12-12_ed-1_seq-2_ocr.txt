THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
AXATICIIY.
A grim commentary upon the folly
of the anarchist pcsition was afforded
bv the attitude of the law toward
m
this very criminal who had just taken
the life of the president. The people
would have torn him limb from limb
if it had not teen that the law he de
fied was at once invoked in his behalf.
So far from his deed being committed
on behalf of the peopie against the
government, the
government
was
obliged at once to exert its full police
power to save him from instant death
at the hands of the people.
Moreover, his deed worked not the
slightest dislocation in our govern
mental system, and the danger of a
recurrence of such deeds, no matter
how great it might grow, would work
only in the direction of strengthening
and giving harshness to the forces of
order. o manwill ever be restrain
ed from becoming president by any
fear as to his personal safety. If the
risk to the president's life became
great, it would mean that the office'
would more and more irae to be rilled
by men of a spirit which would make
them resolute and merciless in deal
ing with every friend of disorder.
This gi eat country will not fall In
to anarchy, and if anarchists should j
ever become a serious menace to
institutions, they would not merely
be stamped out, but would involve in
their own ruin every active or passive
sympathizer with their doctrines.
The American people are slow to
wrath, but when their wrath is once
kindled it burns like a consuming
flame.
Prosperity.
During the last five years business
confidence has been restored, and the
nation is to be congratulated because
of its present abounding prosperity.
Such prosperity can never be created
by law alone, although it is easy
enough to destroy it by mischievous
laws. If the hand of the Lord is
heavy upon any country, if Hood or
drought comes, human wisdom is
powerless to avert the calamity.
Moreover, no law can guard us against
the consequences of our own folly.
The men who are idle or . credulous,
the men who seek pains not by gen
uine work with head or hand but by
gambling, in any form, are always a
source of menace not only to them
selves but to others. If the business
world loses its head, it loses what
legislation cannot supply.
Fundamentally the welfare of each
citizen, and therefore the welfare of
the aggregate of civizens which makes
the nation, must rest upon individual
thrift and energy, resolution and in
tellegince. Nothing can take the
place of this individual capacity; but
wise legislation and honest and intel
ligent administration can give it the
fullest scope, the largest opportunity
to work to good effect.
THE NEW INDIAN.
If the Indian is made to labor like
other people, and if his tribal rela
tions are destroyed as suggested by
the - president in his message, then
will all the romance and poetry and
every unique, characteristic be taken
away from the red man and he will be
but a common every day plodding
citizen. The Indian must come to it,
though.
This is a practical age that has lit
tle to do with traditions and senti
ment of the past. Lo must under
stand that his brow has got to sweat
and he will be obliged to use his
strong right arm in daily toil if he
cares to live. lie must put away hi3
gun, his scalping knife, his trinkets,
his beads, his feathers, his buckskin
attire, his blankets, his indolence and
his dreams of the - war path, of over
coming the white man and re-possesj-ing
the land once owned and ruled by
his fathers, and go to work.
A new Indian is coming upon the
scene of action. All of his powers
which have ever naturally been of the
best, will be developed under the new
order of things. He will be thrown
upon his individual resources, made
to feel that he is a man and all of his
manly traits brought to the front. If
this had been done long ago instead of
keeping the Indian as a national ward
to be misused by unscrupulous govern
ment agents, and made to think he
was nothing but a child constantly
needing a parent's care, the .race
would have been much better off and
the country spared an immense ex
pense. The Roosevelt idea that "the
Indian should be treated as an in
dividual like the white man," is the
right one and no time should be lost
in making a practical application of
the idea in abolishing the agencies,
destroying tribal relations and giving
tlie Indian an opportunity to rise in
the world on his own meiits. In a
few years he will never be referred to
as Lo, with the untutored mind.
South Bend Tribune.
CONSERVATISM IN PROSPERITY,
In the great prosperity of recent
years Indiana's golden share of it has
been so marked as no longer to occa
sion surprise, 'mere was and is so
much in Indiana on which to base
solid prosperity that favorable trade
conditions only were needed to ac
count for the large increase in wealth
and population that has been the
state's happy history in recent years.
The phenomenal gas field, which a do
zen years ago began to lay the found
ations of a new Indiana, is still a source
of immense wealth. Succeeding it
even too fast is the oil development
which promises to add to wealth in
the future as gas has added in the
past. Happily, Indiana's coal fields,
as yet an almost undisturbed source
of wealth, are here to supply the
scarcity of other kinds of fuel, and in
their development to become another
source f prosperity. The inexhaust
ible stone fields must increase their
business with the country's prosperi
ty. More than this, the fine clays are
coming to their own in a growing ap
preciation of their possibilities, while,
we are just at the beginning of the
development of the Portland cement
industry, in which the State promises
to take a lead.
Meanwhile in all other of the feat
ures of a prosperous community, Ind
iana is growing mightily. . The exten
sion of the free rural delivery system,
greater in proportion in this state
than in any other, and the multipli
cation of inteurban roads become
great factors in aiding in the distribu
tion, and to a certain extent in the
creation Of wealth, With all this ex
perience teaches that now is thft time
to be conservative. "We' know that
prosperous times can not last always.
As the secretary of the treasury has
pointed out in his report, "it is a
familiar fact in the past, and it will
be a recurrent fact in the future that
unsettling influences come in at unex
pected periods to disturb finances and
menace credit operations. One or
more events occurring in succession or
possibly operating together, disturb
confidence in the situation";and then
the secretary goes on to cite "a mark
ed example in the so-called panic of
1893," when within a period of less
than twelve months, bank credits
were contracted bv more than $400,
000,000. Confessedly in the opinion of bank
ers and fianciers as well as bv the' earn
est words of the comptroller of the
currency and the secretary of the
treasury, neither our banks nor our
currency system are as easily to en
counter these adverse conditions. The
secretary, in striking phrase, says,
"admirable in many respects, exper
ience shows that oar banking system
is devised for fair weather, not for
storms." So great business interests
and small business interests are vital
ly concerned in shaping a course that
may hold fast if a storm comes, and
may avoid the storm as far as possible.
There is so much in the present pros
perity in Indiana that has the solid
est of foundations that we should be
short-sighted were we to fail to be as
conservative in all ways as possible,
to be slow to enter on speculative ven
tures, remembering that dull times
as well as prosperous times come and
may not be stayed, but that those who
in the prosperous times have shaped
their ventures right and have preserv
ed the fruits of them, are they who
ean tide over lean years with a mini
mum of distress. The people of Indi
ana are In a position to illustrate this
as they did during the last "hard
times." They will show their wis
don and self-restraint by following
such a course. Indianapolis News.
Obituary of Charles Irvin.
. Charles Irvin was born April 13,
1878, and died at the home of his
brother-in-law, Lester Miller, north
east of Argos, Sunday Dec. 1, 1901,
at the age of 23 years, 7 months and
18 days. Of his toy hood we have but
little knowledge, says the Argos Re
flector, but during his riper years he
has made such demonstrations of self
reliance, industry and "honesty that
speak louder praise for him than
mortal tongue can utter. Left when
but a boy to fight his battles practical
ly alone, he strove with such diligence
and determination as to accomplist
adequate rewards for his efforts, at the
same time winning the esteem and
confidence of all who knew him. He
was united in marriage Aug. 3, 1901,
with Miss Effie Finney who with a
large circle of relatives and a host of
sympathising friends is left to moum
her sad loss. Funeral services were
conducted at the residence by, Rev.
Kemp, Dec. 3. Interment in Maple
Grove cemetery.
WAR TAX NO LONGER NEEDED.
In the course of an annual report
which presents several important sug
gestions as to banking and currency
reforms Secretary Gage offers one rec
ommendation which calls for early
and practical aetion. With a surplus
which last June was reported tobe
more than $77,700,000 the secretary
offers estimates to show that existing
revenue laws would produce a surplus
of $100,000,000 for the year ending
with June of 1902. He maintains that
it would be within the limits of safe
and conservative policy now to reduce
revenue to the extent of $50,000,000,
ai.d as a first step in that direction
he recommends the repeal of all the
existing war taxes, which are "in their
nature vexatious, in some instances
oppressive, and, separately considered,
yield but small revenue."
mat taxation measures which are
designed to meet the special emergen
cy of war should cease when that
emergency no longer exists and its
financial effects are no longer felt is a
self-evident proposition. At the pre
sent time there appears to be reasons
why the removal of the war taxes
would be both safe and wise. They
are not only unnecessary but they
threaten to amass in the treasury a
surplusage for which the people have
more use than does the government.
The knowledge that the surplus, more
over,is not an indefinitely growing
quantity, but has its limitations, is
likely to be beneficial in restraining
congressmen from the reckless, expen
ditures to which they are always prone.
If another reason for prompt action
were needed it would be found In the
arbitrary character of the tax itself.
There is no reason why certain indust
ries should bear a certain proportion
of the cost of government while the
favored breweries and other interests
are let off on relatively easier terms.
The early repeal of all these meas
ures of war revenue will be generally
regarded as a wise and timely meas

SANDOVAL MFG. CO.
Buys the Novelty Works and Will
Occupy it Soon.
Tim cr-inrlnvfti Manufacturing com-
panv, of Sandoval, III., bought the I
ground and buildings of the old Ind
iana Xovelty Cf . Tuesday morning and
mfu'le the first payment by telegraph
through the Dearborn National bank,
of Chicago. The Estey Sc Camp piano
company was prepared to submit a
proposition for the same property to
the Plymouth Business Men's associa
tion and was headed off by the prompt
action of the Sandoval people.
It is the intention of the new own
ers to incorporate under the laws of
Indiana, to remove to Plymouth and
occupy the property as soon as possible
and enlarge the scope of their busi
ness by making an additional line of
goods. There is amp1, capital back
of the enterprise, which is an old-established
concern. Itsremoal is due
to a desire to increase and extend its
facilities for manufacturing and ship
ping. Negotiations are on foot looking
toward the early occupancy of the va
cant wagon works' by a factory that
will be advantageous to this city and
it is hoped that the sutseription list
taken for the now defunct piano enter
prise may be held intact for that pur
pose. While it is not absolutely certain
that the deal with the Sandoval peoT
pie will be completed and that they
will own and occupy the desolate Nov
elty plant, there seems, to be nothing
in the way to obstruct the plans. The
company has accepted the property
after full investigation, the terms are
agreed upon and a part of the pur
chase price has been paid to the pres
ent owners. There remain only to
prove "title, make the deed and pay or
secure the balance of the price. While
the. new proprietors have made the
"deal themselves without the interven
tion of the Business Men's association
or any Plymouth agency aad therefore
have made no representations as to
what they will do and are under no
obligations to citizens here to do any
thing, enough is known of them and
their intentions to give cause for con
gratulation that such an enterprise is
to locate with us..' Whatever it adds
to the business of the city will be ap
preciated and the conversion of the
big, empty, bat-haunted building into
a busy hive of industry will in itself
be an inestimable gain. These plans,
If consummated, lea ve the local asso
ciation free to take up the matter of
filling the wagon factory as the next
progressive step, and already there is
"on the string" a concern, now in a
distant town, that wants to get near
er tcTChieago and its market.

SOME USEFUL SPIDERS
5 IJY S. FRANK AARON j
We should all try to understand the
economy of nature. The time wil
surely come when we shall learn to
regard all commcn forms of matter in
their true character, when we shal
realize that everything has its place
in the great scheme, and when this
understanding will fully influence our
attitude toward creatures great or
small, to us ill-favored or beautiful,
beneficial or injurious. There is row
much ignorance, often indifferent to
truth, still oftener influenced by mere
sentiment, concerning those creatures
that have, often unaccountably, be
come to us loathsome and disgusting.
Spiders for example, as with snakes
and lizards, as well as many insects
are objects of almost universal anti
pathy. They are popularily believed
to be harmful, poisonous, worse than
useless, fit only to be shunned, feared,
or trodden oa. Few. even of the most
sensible-people, take any interest in
spiders except to inquire as to their
venomous qualities.
It must be admitted, of course, that
their appearance is not in their favor.
Few animated objects are more re
pulsive to the sight than the so-called
tarantula of the tropics, a huge mem
ber of the spider family, and when to
its ugliness is added its supposed pois
onous character, it becomes a proper
object of aversion. The great hairy
legged spiders of temperate climes are
most unsightly, and the popular
notion endows them with venomous
power, whether they deserve it or not.
Even their handiwork, their delicate
and truly wonderful webs of gossamer,
are unnoticed except to be trodden
down on the lawn, or brushed from
the walls by the broom.
But it can be readily proved that
spiders are rarely, if ever, poisonous
or even harmful, that certain species
are really useful and beneficial, and
that they all play an important part
in the great scheme of nature. Their
chief service to man lies in their de
struction of noxious insects. "To be
sure," says the reader, "spiders kill
flies, and flies are a nuisance." True,
and flies are not only a nuisance; they
are carriers of disease, spreaders of
pollution. Spiders also kill mosquitos,
moths and other flying and crawling
pests that stray into their webs.
The grassv-bank spider, Agalena
naevia, whose dew-spangled web is
often seen on the lawn in the early
summer morning, preys upon many
kinds of noxious insects. A larger
species of AgalCna, common in woods
and about stone piles and fences,
makes larger and stronger webs, in
which bigger insects, such as locusts,
grasshoppers, and Junebugs, are often
trapped. The webs of all the A gale
nas lead down into dark and secret
tunnels where the spider retreats
when danger threatens. Even the
sudden visit of a wasp or bumble-bee
will sometimes drive the owner of the
web into this hiding place.
The jumping spiders (Attus) are
also active fly-catchers and destroyers
of. noxious insects. They build no
web except a very small receptacle in
which to hide their eggs and to pro
tect their young when hatched. They
are the tigers of the insect world,
springing upon their prey with true
feline energy. The orb-weavers,
Eperia, are equally useful to man,, and
their webs reach the highest develop
ment of mechanical skill.
It is worthy of note that insects in
jurious to man form the chief prey of
the orb-weaving and grassy-bank
spiders, as well as of the jumping spe
cies. It is true that beneficial in
sects, such as ichneumon flies and pre
daceous beetles, may stray into their
nests, but the noxious flies, the cater
pillars, grasshoppers and leaf-eating
beetles arc their far more numerous
victims. '
But the most useful of all our
spiders are those which prey upon the
caterpillars that infest our shade and
fruit trees and destroy their foliage.
Attached to the branches of trees,
particularly to the cherry, apple,
maple, elm, ash and linden, may often
be seen large, unsightly w ebs or nests,
sometimes covering a good-sized
branch. These nests are constructed
by the lirvae of several kinds of web
worms, and each nest is the home of
a colony of the worms, hiding there by
day, and crawling forth at right to
devour the surrounding ' leaves. A
single web often contains hundreds of
these worms, and were it not for a
few spideTS that also inhabit the nest
and suck the life-blood of the cater
pillars, the latter would undoubtedly
increase in such numbers as to strip
our fruit and shade trees almost bare
of foliage. The webs which protect
the caterpillars from birds also enable
the spiders to feed in safety upon
their prey. No web-worm's nest is
free from its spider parasites.
The willow web-worm, a clely al
lied species, found not only on Willows
but also on our common silver poplars,
folding the leaves together In a smaller
web, also has its spider parasites. But
these intruders are by no means all of
the same species.. Some webs contain
Attus spiders only; others harbor a
spider with longer legs resembling the
Epiera; and still others are infested
by a spider of reater size. iViave
even seen all these various kinds living
in the same nest and devouring the
unfortunate caterpillars at their leis
ure. This would seem an exception
to the rule that "two of a trade can
never agree."
The actual number of individual
spiders in any one nest is never large,
1J i -w
seiuom more man iour or live, it is
remarkable that so few spiders can
destroy so many caterpillars. They
begin when the latter are very small,
sucking their juices rapidly one after
another and always leaving their bod
ies t ) dry up. It is probable that
when a spider attacks a full-grown
caterpillar, it absorbs only a part of
the vital fluid enough, however, to
cause death. In many cases, the few
spiders in such a nest manage to de
stroy every worm in the colony, leav
ing not one survivor.
May we not then realize that spiders
can justly be classed among our most
useful and beneficial forms of life?
Too much can not be said in favor of
protecting from destruction our insect-
eating birds. But may not our hum
bler friends, the spiders, also enjoy
our favor? Yet they can well üro-
tect themselves, and we can best pro
mote our own interests by simply and
fairly letting them alone.
