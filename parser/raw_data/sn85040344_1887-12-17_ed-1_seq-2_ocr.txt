—The lowa courts have decided
that Arensdorf who has been on trial
for the murder of Key. Haddock at
Sioux City, was not guilty. On the
first trial it has been proven that
eleven of the jurymen were bribed in
the interest of the prisoner, and there
hi no room to doubt but that all of
the jury and the court as well, were
bribed at the second trial. The evi
dence was of both a positive and cir
cumstantial character, and it would
be difficult to got evidence more cleir
and convincing, but all to n • purpose,
ami the low born, rum soaked coward
ly assassin goes free, and Souix City
says to her grog shop keepers, when
decent men oppose your business
shoot them down. It will be more
tolerable for Sodom in that day than
for Sioux City.
—Jacob Sharp’s country place,
where he will probably go to rest for
a spell, lies just outside of Rome,
N. V., and comprises 1,500 acres, all
told. The house is a handsome one,
the barns large and substantial, and
the walks, which cut it into plats are
covered with the whitest gravel. Of
course it would never do to send such
a man to the penitentiary for a little
thing like bribing a few naturally
corrupt aldermen, so the court of ap
peals has virtually set him free by
granting him anew trial on some
trifling tcclinacality someone Ims
found in the proceedings. Sharp
has evidently put some of his ready
cash “where it will do the most good”.
—Say, all you good fellows who
make and sell beer and liquors, don’t
it make you feel a little squeemish to
have the Supreme Court of the United
States declare the business a public
nuisance and order the same abated?
Come, now boys, don’t you think it is
time to quit such a business and turn
your attention to some honorable pur
suit. Making a local application, you
are a good looking, big hearted, in
telligent and well informed lot ol men
and well fitted for tradesmen, mech
anics or the professions. Turn the
key' on the nuisance business, and
turn your attention and energies to
something higher and nobler.
—George William Curtis told the
truth last week for the first time in
three years. He said that he and the
other mugwumps did not vote for
Cleyeland because of his free trade
ideas, nor yet for his civil service
ideas and promises, but simply be
cause it was the only way to beat Mr.
Blaine, a man they did not like.
Mr. ( urtis cares no more for civil
service reform than a monkey does
for a rotten cocoanut, but to beat Mr.
Blaine, a man who Mr. Curtis cannot
control, he would vote for Mr. Cleve
land, the Deyil or any other man.
Such is George William Curtis.
—The Superior Lumber Company
of Ashland is one of the largest in the
United States, and W. F. Vilas, late
Postmaster General, and present as
pirent for the office of Secretary of
the Interior, is said to be the heaviest
stock holder in the concern. The
company is interested in the Omaha
and other lands no doubt, now in
controversy, and the decisions of the
Secretary of the Interior would he
very important to him and his associ
ates. Garland and Vilas should form
a co-partnership. What a pretty pair
for a presidents cabinet.
—Senator Sawyer is chairman of
the senate committe on post office and
post roads, and is also a member of
the committees on education and
labor, commerce, pensions and rail
roads. Senator Spooner is chairman
of the committe on claims and also a
member of the committees on Dis
trict of Columbia, privileges and
elections, and to investigate the con
dition of the Potomac front.
—The bum element of Sioux Cilv
held a jubilee oyer the result of the
Arensdorf trial, and the attorneys,
Argo and Erwin, who defended the
man were presented wih gold headed
canes. Arensdorf, the man whom
everybody believes shot Haddock, was
the lion of flic evening. Such is the
law decisions that breed mob violence.
The President thinks the tax on
tobacco ought to remain, but since
the Democratic members of congress
have heard from Mr. Blaine, they
have been seized with a desire to
place tobacco on the free li.-t. The
Democratic flock does not seem to
have much respect for its shepherd.
—The tobacco tax amounts to S3O,

you will at the same time remove

THE CAMPAIGN OPENED.
President Cleveland Fires the
First Gun.
His to be Successor, James G.
Blaine, Replies with
Solid Shot
The great political campaign of 1883
was formally opened last week, when
on Tuesday the President’s message was
read to congress. In common par
lance this was the first gun fired in
the great battle by the Democratic
commander. Hardly had the echoes
died away, when with a promptness
little expected there comes across the
sea from that gallant, fearless well
train and general and leader of the Re
publican hosts, James G. Blaine, a
solid shot that turned the il ink of the
enemy and set them quaking in their
boots.
The President in his message throws
down the gauntlet of Free Trade, and
Mr. Blaine is nut slow to take it up
in defence of the poor and laboring
classes of his country. Mr. Blaine
was in Paris when the President’s
message was first seen by him, and a
correspondent of the New York Tri
bune interviewed him immediately
and sent it by cable to that paper.
There is no uncertain sound, iu Mr.
Blaines words and we wish we had
space to give all that he said, hut we
must he content with a little of it, at
least for this time. He said:
“I have been reading an abstract
from the President’s message and have
been especially interested in the com
ments of tlie London papers. These
papers all assume to declare that the
message is a Free Trade manifesto,
and evidently are anticipating an en
larged market for English fabrics in
the I nited .States as a consequence of
the President’s recommendations. Per
haps that fact stamped the character
of the message more clearly than any
words of mine can.”
“You don’t mean actual free trade
without duty?” queried the reporter.
“No, no,” replied Mr. Blaine. “Nor
do* the London papers mean that.
They simply mean that the president
recommended what is known in the
United States as a revenue tariff, re
jecting the protective feature as an
object and not even permitting pro
tection to result us an incident to re
venue duties.”
“I don’t know that I quite compre
hend that last point,” said the report
er.
“I mean.” said Mr. Blaine, “that
for the first time in the history of the
United States the President recom
mends retaining an internal tax in
order that the taritf may he forced
down even below the fa:- revenue
standard. He recommends that
THE TAX OX TOBACCO
he retained and that many millions
annually he levied on a domestic
product which would far hotter come
from a taritf on foreign fabrics.”
“ 1 hen you mean to imply that you
would fayor the repeal of the tobacco
tax.”
“Certainly, I mean just that,” said
Mr. Blaine. “I should urge that it
he done at once, even before the Christ
mas holidays. It would in the first
place bring great relief to growers of
tobacco all oyer the country, and
would, moreover, materially lessen (he
price of the article to consumers. To
bacco to millions of men is a necessity.
The President calls it a luxury, but it
is a luxury in no other sense than tea
and coffee are luxuries. It is well to
remember that the luxury of yesterday
becomes a necessity of to-day. Watch,
if you please the number of men at
work on the farm, in the coal mine,
on the railroad, in the iron foundry,
or in any calling and you will find 65
to 100 chewing while they work.
After each meal the same proportion
seek the solace of a pipe or cigar.
These men not only pay the millions
ot the tobacco tax, but pay on every
plug and every cigar an enhanced
price which the tax enables the manu
facturer and retailer to impose. The
only excuse for such a tax is
THE ACTI’AL NECESSITY
under which the government found
itself during the war and the years
immediately following. To retain the
tax now in order to destroy the pro
duction which would incidentally flow
from raising the same amount of
money on foreign imports, is certainly
a most extraordinary policy for onr
government.”
“W ell, then. Mr. Blaine, would you
advise the repeal of the whisky tax
also?”
“No. I would not. Other condi
tions than those ot financial adminis
tration are to ho taken into account
with regard to whisky. There is a
moral side toil. To cheapen t lie price
ot whisky is to increase the consump
tion enormously. There would be no
s n-e in urging the reform wrought
by high license in many states if the
national government neutralizes the
good effect by making whisky within
the reach of every one at 20 cents a
gallon. Whisky would he everywhere
distilled if the surveillance of the
government were withdrawn by the
remission of the tax. and illicit sales
could not then he prevented even by
policy as vigorous and searching as
that with which llus-ia pursues the
Nihilists. It would destroy high lic
ense at once in all the states. Whisky
has done a vast deal of harm in the
I nited >?ates. 1 would try and make
il do some good. I would use the tax
to fortify our cities on the seaboard.
In view of the powerful letter address
ed to the Democratic party on the
srn.iEcr ok fortifications
by the late Samuel J. Tildeu in 1885,
1 am amazed that no attention has
been paid to the subject by the Dem
ocratic administration. Never before
in the history of the world has any
government allowed great cities on
the seaboard, like Philadelphia, New
\ork, Boston, Baltimore, New Or
leans and San Francisco, to remain
defenceless.
W hile Mr. Cleveland would repeal
the duty on wool and woolen goods,
Mr. Blaine would protect and foster
the wool trade and make sheep rais
ing a profitable industry for the
American farmer. Being asked if he
thought the presidents reccomracnda
tions if carried out would increase onr
| export trade, he replied. “Possibly in
; some few articles of peculiar construc
tion it might, hut it would increase
our import trade ten fold as much in
the great staple fabrics, in woolen and
| goods, in iron, in steel, in all the
thousands and one shape in which
they are wrought. How are we to
export staple.fabrics to the markets
of Europe unless we make them
cheaper than they do in Europe, and
how are we to manufacture them
ch caper than they do in Europe un
less we get cheaper labor than they
have in Europe?”
Then you think that
THE QUESTION OK LABOR
underlies the whole subject?”
“Of course it does,” replied Mr.
Blaine. “It is, in fact, the entire
question. Whenever we can force
carpenters, masons, iron workers and
mechanics in every department to
work as cheaply and live as poorly in
the I idled States as similar workmen
in Europe, we can, of course manu
facture just as cheaply as they do in
England and France. But I am to
tally opposed to a policy that would
ebtail such results. To attempt it
is equivalent to a social and financial
revolution —one that would bring un
told distress.”
“But those holding the president’s
tariff views,” remarked the reporter,
“are always quoting the great pros
perity of the eooiiUy under the tariff
of 1846.”
“That tariff did not involve the
one destructive point recommended
by the president, namely, the retain
ing of direct internal taxes in order
to abolish indirect taxes leiyed on
foreign fabrics. But the country
had peculiar advantages under it by
the Crimean war involving England,
France, and Russia and largely im
pairing their tra le. All these inci
dents, or accidents if you choose,
were immensely stimulating to trade
in the United States, regardless of
the nature of onr tariff. But mark
the end of this European experience
with the tariff of IS Id, which for a
time gave an illusory and deceptive
show of prosperity. Its enactment
was immediately followed by the
Mexican war; then in IS4B by the
great convulsions in Europe; then
in 1840 and succeeding years by the
enormous gold yield in California.
The powers made peace in 1856, and
at the time the output of gold in Cali
fornia fell off. Immediately the
FINANCIAL PANIC
of 1857 came upon the country with
disastrous force. Though we had in
these years minded a yast amount of
gold in California, every bank in
New York was compelled to suspend
specie payment. Four hundred
millions in gold had been carried out j
of the country in eight years to pay |
for foreign goods that should have
been manufactured at borne, and we
had years of depression and distress as
an atonement for our folly.
“It is remarkable that President
Polk recomended the tariff of 1846 on
precisely the s une ground that presi
dent Cleveland recommends a simi
lar enactment now, namely, the stir- 1
plus in the treasury menacing ttie |
prosperity of the country. History is i
repeating itself. By the way,” Mr. j
Blaine added, after a moment’s re- I
flection, “it is worth notice that Mr. |
Polk insists on emptying the treasury I
by the free trade tariff, then imediate- !
ly rushed the country into debt by 1
borrowing Sl50,0o0,()00 for tlie Mex- !
ican war. I trust nothing may occur
to repeat so disasterous a sequel to
the policy recommended by President
Cleveland. But
THE URIFOUM FATE
has been for fifty years past that the.
Democrat party when it goes out of
power always leayes an empty treas
ury. and when it returns to power al
ways finds a full treasury.”
“Then do you mean to imply that
there should be no reduction of the
national revenue?”
“No, what I have said implies the
reverse. I would reduce it by a
prompt repeal of the tobacco tax, ami
would make here and tiicre some
changes in I lie tariff—not to reduce
protection, but wisely to foster it.
“But what about the existing sur
plus?”
“ J he abstract of the message I have
seen, replied Mr. Blame, “contains
no reference to that point. I therefore
make no comment further than to
indorse Fred Grant’s remark that a
surplus is always easier to handle than
a deficit.”
The reporter repeated the question
whether the president’s recoin in nd
alion would not, if adopted, give us
the advantage of a large increase in
exports.
“1 only repeat,” answered Mr.
Blaine, “that it would vastly enlarge
our imports, while the only exports it
would seriously increase is our gold
and silver. That would flow out
bounteously, just as it did under the
tariff of 1864. The presidents recom
mendation enacted into law would re
sult, as did an experiment in drainage
of a man who wished to turn a swamp
into a productive field. He dug a
drain to neighboring river, hut it hap
pened unfortunately that the leyel of
the river was higher that the level of
the swamp. The consequence need
not he told. A parallel would be
found when (he president’s policy in
attempting to open a channel for an
increase of exports should simply suc
ceed in making way for a deluging in
flow of fabrics to the destruction of
home industry.”
“How will the president’s message
lie taken in the South?”
“I don t dare answer that question.
1 lie truth has been so long obscured
by certain local questions and un
reasoning prejudice that nobodv can
hope tor industrial enlightenment
among their leaders, just yet, hut in
my view the South above all sentiona
of the Inion needs protective tariffs.
4he two \ irginias, North Carolina,
Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Ala
bama and Georgia, have enormous
facilities for developing and handling
manufactures.
THEY CANNOT I> ANYTHING
without protection and even progress
so vast as some of those states made
will he checked if the presidents mes
sage is enacted into law. Their Sen
ators and representatives can prevent
it. but they are so used to fol'ow any-

i bably they will follow the president

i By the time some of the Southern
; states get free iron, ore and coal, while
i tobacco is taxed they may haye oc
| casion to sit down and calculate the
1 value tf Democratic free trade
to their coal interests.”
“What must le the marked and
general effect of the president's mes
sage?” It will bring the country
where it ought to ho brought— to
A FVU-, l AIK CONTKST
on the question of protection. The
president himself makes it the one is
sue by presenting no other in his mes

question settled. The Democratic
party in power is a standing menace
to the industrial prosperity of the
country. The menace should he re

should he made certain. Nothing is

tainty, and nothing so paralyzing as

Hon. Chas. S. Taylor, onr present
assemblyman, is spoken of by several
papers in connection with the next
senatorship. The llice Lake Tunes
says he will have the support of the
Baron County delegation, and the
Cumberland Advocate is not acquaint

trict ' who could represent it more
creditably. The Superior Times -and

Object! Of course we object, and
with good reason, too, and there are
many others that will object to his
nomination and election, sufficient
probably to defeat him. The idea of
“Little" Taylor for State Senator!
W by, it is absurd, and lie must have
the cheek of a book agent to think of
it for a moment. If the party of
Baron county chooses to take him up
and inflict him upon the good people
of that county,—very well; (hut we
can’t imagine what they have done to
deserve this great puni-hment), but
they should have some regard for the
people outside. We do not beleive
he can get the delegation from Barron
and if he did it would he Something
lie had never done before. His friends
there, if he ever had any must have
fallen away from him since his legis
lative experience of last winter, for of
all incompetent members of that Leg
islature he was a little the worst. As
for the editor of the Advocate, we
can only sa\ that he must he a per
fect stranger to this district, and he
cannot have formed any acquaintances
yet but “Little” Taylor and “Liar”
Swift. But there is no danger of this
calamity falling on the district, the
party is not so foolish.—Oraulsbu g

Our city fathers evidently mean
business, and also mean that the or
dinances they issue are not intended
for mere holiday reading matter, but
that they are to be cnforcen and the
man who thinks he is going to defy or
dodge them is going to get badly left.
When they say the brutal prize ring
must go, it simply goeth. When
they say the saloon men must not sell
liquor on Sunday they mean just that
and nothing else. Mr. Kane's bar
tender thought the Village fathers
said they mustn’t just for political
effect, and to see how it would look in
print, and kept right on selling last
Sunday as usual, lie found out his
mistake Monday and will not pav any
more fines experimenting with or
dinances. Another ordinance says
the saloons must close at 11 o'clock
every night, and it means 11 o’clock
p. m., not 1, 2 or 3 o’clock a. m.

| ' Tlie supreme court of the I'-iite-i
States ha-t re-'i lcro l a deci-iou of far
reacliiug importance in the Kansas
I liquor ciwes, which were taken he.f rc
it by the liqu-ir rn n of that .state !•
test the con-ututionality of the pro
hibition law in effect there. The ap
peal to the supreme c urt was based
on two points. Tie* Kaunas law pro
’ hihits the manufacture or sale in that
state of intoxicating liquors. The
first joint raised was that a state has
no right to prevent any edizen from
manufacturing for his jicrsonal use,
or for export or storage, any article
which, from its nature, may be manu
facture 1, stored or exported without
injury to, or infraction upon the
rights of, others. The second was
that persons engaged in the manu
facture o p malt and spiritous liquors
in Kansas had the value of their pro
perty destroyed by the prohibitory
law, and that a state has not the right
to take away the value of a man’s
property without compensil ng him
for tho loss thus inflicted.
On the first point the court holds
that while the proposition as stated is
a sound one, the right to determine
what article may or may not he
manufac'ured and stored or exported
without danger to others rests in the
state, and not in t tie individual.
The state in question haying decided,
through the action of its legislature, !
that the manufacture of intoxicants j
for any purpose is dangepous to the
community, they must be so regarded
iu Jaw. On the second point tiie de
cision is that, the state having con-.
.atructivcly declared the manufacture |
of and traffic in liqu- r inimical to the
welfare of its people, legislation to |
prohibit either, or h -lh, is in the na-'
ture of taking justifiable steps to
abate a nuisance, and th< se whose:
property interests suffer in conse
quence have no recourse.
The decision is conclusive as to the
rights of a state to do pretty much
whatever it elects to do toward re
striction or interdiction of the liquor
traffic, and it is naturally hailed with
delight by the prohibit is mi ts.
