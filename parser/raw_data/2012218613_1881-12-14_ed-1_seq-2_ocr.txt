, ; would not I In* eighty dollars* worth of ;

of! merchant has two thousand dollars on

that he has tweniy-tive hundred dolir

liover is free to admit that the iner- j

take the money and put it to other j

is the converse 01 the proj>o>ition truiv;
that because the amount u>ed by the]

?Mr. Shaler Smith ha* "riven the results
of extensive observations in re

wind. The most violent gale recorded
by him was at East Sr. L<>uis, in 1*71.
when the wind overturned 21 locomotive,
the foreo d veloped in so doin?r
being no le?8 than ninety-three pounds
per square to< t. At St. Charles a jail
was d? 6troyed in 1*77, the pressure required
being e'ghty-ji'Ur pounds per
square foot. At MarshtiMd, in 1-380, a
briek mans'on"was m*v e 1. the force
1 ecessar being fifty-eight pounds per
squure toot. tJclovv the'extraordinary
pressures, Mr. Smith instance* numer
ous eases of trains blown off rails, and
bridges, etc., blown down by gale* ot
twenty-four to thirty-one pounds per
square foot. In all the example* the
lowest force required to do the observed
damage has been taken as the maximum
power of the wind, although, of
course, it may have been higher.
?Enthusiasts who make a special

of being the agent through which
the effects are manifested upon our
