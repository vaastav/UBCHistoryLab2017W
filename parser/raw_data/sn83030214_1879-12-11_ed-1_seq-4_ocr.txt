When the negro exodus beOTBB in the Mis?
sissippi Valley, the Democratic press repre
sented it to be the result of a wicked con?
spiracy plotted in BaSBBBb or some other hot?
bed of ahealtlosiBiaoi bet wees Radieal peliticiaM
ami "rrnsjnnj; stiecuiators, to entice the OOlorod
people away fiom their c unforlalile homes.
The object was two-fold. It was to colonize
Republican voters in the Northwest, ami to
open a market for otherwise unsalable rail?
road lands. The emigrants almost invariably
directeii their steps toward Kilians, where (so
effectosiiiy did tin old Border-Roflbvii Detnoc
racy settle the poUtiee ot the State for all tune)
the importation of Republican voters would
have been about as useful as a project lor
taigating the Atlanlic Ocean; but to tins fact
the Democratic journalists shut their oyOO.
With equally calm disdain they surveyed the
further fact thai the land alleged to be'in the
tnaiket was in a region lar nway tiom the
fuKiltvcs' line of ui.uch ; indeed, thut it lay
lnhiud them. In time these luisrepreeentu
tions were silenced, principilly perhaps be?
cause nobody would believe them. The BOSTOOI
found work und shelter in Kunsas, und their
simple story of the wronifs they hud siilleted
aud the reusous for their removui convinced
everybody who heard it.
At the time of tli^> Kunsas iBJBllglltloaj it
was statetl by iniiny persons who had UHeOli
gated this curious movement that the colmed
BSSJSBS all over the Cotton States were tesi
b-sH and dissatisfied, and that a much more
extensivi exotlus might lie looked for at the
eloSC of the Winter. It BBS begun msoiht than
we expt-cU'd. Laige parties have ?et out from
N'Tih Carolina and have passed thtongh
Washington, their objective point being the
State of Indiana. Some hundreds are moving
toward the same destination through Teti
iH'.vic, I he Houibon new>]>aji<Ts treat the
subject now as foolishly as they did in the
Spriuj. We are gravely assured that the
fliirht ft urn North Carolina has its
origin m the machinations of two or
three colored men who bad to run
away on account of bad conduct. These fugi?

It is not the lea-it serious feature of the
cai-e that the BBOdHI bus boett regularly
organ-zed In advance and with the
utmost secrecy. No white people seem
to have Ik in aware of the pioject.
The Irecdmcn discussed it among them
Ki?lve-, in theii church moctings or by other
agencies of eomuiunication which they learned
how to employ in the days of slavei"J. and
then they sent forward one or two discreet
nu n of their raco to spy out the land. If
these explorers did not pojpooelyotwceatltheir
object, they wi nt iibmit it nt any rate very
quietly, and the public had no suspicion of
what ??s going on until Hie emigrants sud?
denly forsook tin ii fajhltaO. and in parties of
two hundred ot more followed these leaders
to the new homes which had been selected
for them. In some instances families
went together; in others the men went
alone, purposing to send for their wives
and children ns soon ns they found work and
shelter. It is impossible to tell bow far the
preparations tor removal have e.xt? mb d ; but
all over the .Smith the planters are dreading
the Spring. The fact th it the few thousands
who have already cone North have generally
prospered is ominous of further di-t in banco.
We can hardly doubt that full account" of
the experiences of the Kansas parties have
been wnl back b) their tiicmlsat the South.
It tue whites are wise they will conn trying
to persuade themselTea that this movement is
a political trick (which tiny know it is not),
and, looking at the situation calmly und rea?
sonably, will impure into the arils Which have
caused the exodus and the 'remedies which
will stop if. They have treated the nogfO
with cruel injuatioe, believing thai he could
novel assort bJi political right*agalnal a solid
" superior race." It never recurred to them
that it he could not overcome wrong he would
evade it by moving a Way.
OUMJY IND Till l i t \n /;[>/ h( us.
The conduct of Chiei Onrnj since the White
Rivei maasaen baa done much to remove pub- I
lie prejudice against bis race. Every fnit
minded man n u t acknowledge that be has
acted with a moderation, intelligence and
stem aenae of even justice arbieh would do
credit to n greater ruler. For Ouray, we j
should remember, is in hia pott) way a ruler,
and apt to be prejudiced in favor of his own
subjects. The tie bet0*000 him and the guilty
Utes is even Stronger than that between a
king snd his subjects, nml resembles
more the kinship of a S ottish chief- !
tain and his clan. Under those circum- i
stances it argues exeeidional moral eottr go in
Ouray that be bus iiisi-ted on giving up the
IUU1 derera lit all, uguinst the evident fit rce
opposition of the fighting men of the tribe,
aud ht certainly had the right to ask that
they ahOttM I ive a lair trial.
The Basel IgB-acaal white men in the coun?

as i; human being, and to judge iiim by the
sane- laws of light and wrong us other men
whom (Sod has made ; nnd even they can
aec that the " red devils" in thla nft*:ir have

Neither Colorow, Dottglaoa nor Jack knew any?

Statesmen who all at once are troubled
with a nervous dread of disturbing the
( uirt'iicy?<u "middling with ihe currency,"
as the phrase goes?would do well to remiud
themselves that the currency is in dUonk
danger of tlisturbance so hing ns it has
no changeless value of its own. The
~!iic way to secure u stable currency and put
it above being " un-dd led wiih" to the coun
tt\*s hint by Congress, is to prepare at OttCO
for n return to lirst principles, so that a
prOBEBM ta ]11v a dollar entiled he legally
made to do duty as a genuine dollar.
St itBBaaOn who say that they favor the
leioinim mlatious of the President and Sic
rBtaiy ol the Treasury, but yet advise the
policv of waiting for better times, or some
note COB VOn lent BBBaOB, should remind
them l ives that the DoBBUtHBlitl patty al?
ways DppOOQfJ the llesumptioil Acl on the

m -.inn |d ion, or "grow up into" resumption.
People are iml in the habit of growing up or
(.lilting into the pa vim nt of their d. bta.
Some rule of action must be can fully laid
down and sternly and persistently followed.
Without the lb sumption Act there would
have been no resumption. Nor will
the payment of the debt represent cd by the
Treasury notca ever be accomplished without

of another, i ml statesmen who stand tcoly
to adopt any financial opinion, or who
desire to conceal the opinions tOOJ pos?
ses*, so that they may inflict DO injury
upon their party in the next Presiden

that the party which wins next year
will he a party with conviction.', and n
party which does not shrink htm expressing
them. This is one question winch BUS) l?e
squarely met. It cannot be kept out of a Presi?

the puit of Wieden to choose the
right sitle and choose it at once.
There is a dominating moral element in the
financial questions which have Im e i before the
jKHiple for the last twenty years, and, with the
history of these years fie-h in iinnd, the
man who enmot trust the moral sense of
the people is worse than an infidel.
The country has a collective conscience. It
belie yea ia paying debts, and paying them in
thespi.it of the contract. The Bepablican
party has acbiered Ho most signal racorssei
when it has declared most openly and earn?
estly for honest money, even in States which
have been swept ovei bv flnsneisl h< resh .
It that party wins next year, it will win bc
canse it takes the higbeet moral gronnd on

fact, therefore, that 1SS0 is a Presidential
year, so far from justifying or excusing
the ebenen Republican leaders lor Invita?
tion in taking advanced ground on this sub?
ject, is the most urgent reason for a prompt
and vigorous SSBOrtioO of their faith. The
men who serve the patty best are the men
who stand ready to Ight fOf the best ideas of

HM| thin line picture with which Mr. Wallaek long

With St. Peter'* outline ill silver kgbt, is tastefully

and rieh and handsome. The cast of parts, which
is given below, la seen to be judicious.

delight by all who know and admire the art of
acting. There i* a i ch womanhood in the ner-orm
tion of the heroine by Miss Ada Dvaa. She makes
0 tual the Ideal of a woman for whom love ung'.it
make a hero out of a criminal, and lead any m.iu to
lace di ith. Her passion in tho bra< clet scene is tm
iiffectedly human, and deeply pathetic. Mr.
Eyre, if sane what lacking in the indefinable quality
that fascinates, is yet earnest and strong as the
iinfortiiu to adventurer. Miss Rose Wood might
well he less artificial in demeanor, and would Is- w ise
to reefify a strong tendency to nasal enunciation.
Mr. Harry Edwarns has but a slight opportunity?
slighter, even, than was afforded to him in the
comedy of "Oir(i trls." In that he could and did
depict, with subtle skill, the path* tie condition of
a laj?hiaj da?a gentleman. In this he ha? but to ex
ptl M, -vith dignity and sweetness, a parent's solici?
tude. The characteristics of this actor are a noble
"I I ? BS, l Hue intellect, a ru h, sweet voice, lively
