This
and Your Success
Many men have started in business with a capital only of
ability, hard work, honesty and a good reputation. It is
no uncommon thing for men thus handicapped to win out
and make a success in their undertakings. You probably
know of several such instances. ,
An important factor to their success, in almost every
instance, you will find, was their bank account. Their
bank deposits mav not have been larye, but their connec-
tion with the bank, coupled with their energy, honesty
and character, was the basis of the credit they were able
to establish, and through credit, success was possible.
If you are starting out for yourself without capital, by
all means have a bank account with this bank. It will be
a help to you in many ways

been installed near the big water tank
iu the south part of town. It Is quite
an intricate piece of mechanism, so
arranged that when the pressure gauge
at the pumping station shows the tank
to bo full, by merely pressing a button
the engineer closes the vaive at the
tank.
The valve was In working order and
P. was to be surrounded with concrete
to protect it. When the workmen
went home on the night In Question
they carefully covered It up with sacks
of cement. On their return the next
morning the cement had been scat
tered and the electric valve was found
battered to pieces, apparently with a
heavy hammer, rendering It useless.
Besides the cost of the valve, the
city is put to the additional expense
of keeping a man at the tank to open
and close the pipe line until a new
valve can be obtained.

If 24 men who voted against the

have been different. While the plu

the total vote being 1,163, a vote of
582, or any number more than one-half
of the total, would have carried it.
The total vote was larger than was
anticipated, voting being heavy toward

a little over 200 short of the total vote
that was cast on prohibition in the No

Officer at Henryetta in
v Trouble Marshal is
Arrested
Okmulgee, Okla., Dec. 16 Samuel
Higginbotham, city marshal of Henry
etta, has been indicted by the Okmul
gee county grand jury for taking a
bribe. The Indictment was returned
Tuesday night, but It was not made
public until he came here Thursday
and gave bond for $5,000.
The grand jury adjourned Thursday,
returning thirty-eight more indict
ments, making a total of 132 returned
since it began sitting December 5.
Eight of the Indictments are for fel
ony, and it is reported on good author
ity that some other county officers
have been Indicted for offenses similar
to that of Higginbotham's. The rest
of the indictments are for offenses
against the prohibitory laws.
The grand jury was called principal
ly because of the charge made by Hen
ryetta citizens that officials in that
town were allowing illegal places to
run by means of fines collected at regu
lar periods. Judge William Barnum, In
instructing the grand jury, stated that
while unlawful places were often per
mitted to run by the fine system, that
it, was in violation of the prohibitory
law and that officials who permitted It
were violating the law.
The information of the grand Jury
against Higginbotham charges that on
May 10, 1910, he accepted a bribe from
H. h. Moore, a law-violator, of Heuty-
etta.
According to Information that has
reached here the method of licensing
at Henryetta was this way: The keep
ers would report to the city cmirta at
regular inteiprr.ls und would pay a
stated fine. Approximately half of the
fine was taken by the officials for costs
and the rest was turned into the town
treasury.
Nine or ten places ran there Tot
months with apparent immunity from
the town officials. The names of other
officials indicted, if there tire any, will
not be made public util.II they are ar
rested. The grand jury apparently made a
clean sweep of the bootleggers of the
county, as Couuty Attorney J. S. Eaton
said Thursday evening that the indict
ments represented practically every
part of the county.
he will give a concert. Prof. Bistolfi
Is noted as a musician and the press
gives him very complimentary notices.
He played for the Elks at El Reno last
night and the Daily American thi3
morning speaks very highly of his mu
sio. ' i
