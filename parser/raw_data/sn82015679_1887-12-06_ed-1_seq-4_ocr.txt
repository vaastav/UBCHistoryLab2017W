President Sadi-Carnot is hardly a hered
itary "ruler, but he may be regarded as a
itatesman by virtue of descent.
Mr. Turpie is not oat of the woods yet.
The committee on elections will consider his
lose, and the fraud is likely to be vigorously
ixposed.
THE first feeling among the Republicans of
Indiana over the Turpie case will be that ot
Surprise and regret; the next will be that of
indignation.
There was no contestant for the seat of
Mr. -Turpie other than the Republicans of the
-State and every decent citizen who opposes
trime and revolution in politics.
Mr. Harpeb, of the late Fidelity Bant,

Yesterday was just the day for Christmas
(hopping, and a good many people who had
read the advertisements in the Sunday
Journal spent it pleasurably and profitably
in that way.
There are men, possibly, who have twenty
two thousand words to say that the American
people would care to hear, but Mr. Cleveland
Is not one of them. This is a busy world,
Und cannot stop to listen to platitudes.
One report says the President's message
will treat only of the tariff question, and an
other that it will contain about 22,000 words.
It he unloads 22,000 words on the tariff
question, there will be trouble in this country
sure.
A New YORK writer has devised what he
ealls a "millennium" scheme for the revolu
tion of base-ball. This nomenclature is of a
character to alarm the public. Are we really
to have base-ball in the millennium, and is it
h:ue that the two can be co-existent?
An undertaker of Nashville is authority for
the statement that, in accordance with the
dying request of a lady buried in that city
recently, her new bonnet was interred with
her. This is without doubt to be regarded as
one of those cases where the ruling passion is
strong in death.
The offer by a Chicago theatrical manager
of a California corner lot to each purchaser of
a reserved seat is a natural result of the
development of the modern drama. A corner
lot is, in fact, hardly a sufficient recompense
to the -ufferer who ha3 attended the average
peripatetic show.
Our Washington special says that it was
the legi? 'ative compromise that gave a prima
facie cae to Mr. Turpie. That compromise
recognised Green Smith and gave an appear
ance of validity to his signature to the cre
dentials of the claimant. That compromise
was a bad piece of politics, and the end may
not be yet.
Mrs. Lockwood, who was the candidate of
the National Woman's Suffrage Association
for President in 1S8L says there will be a bit
ter fight between Miss Susan B. Anthony and
Mrs. Lucy Stone for the nomination next
year. Mrs. Lockwood intimates that she her-
1 elf may come in as a dark horse, if that is a
correct expression.
The compositors in the public printing
office were compelled to swear solemn oaths
that they would not "give away" a word of
the President's message. This was poor
policy. If they had been instructed to give
away about 17,000 words of it, the remainder
Would have answered every purpose, and
would have been read by the public.
Congressman Brower, a Republican who
last year carried a district in North Carolina
herefore Democratic, says the Republicans
expect to carry the State next year. The
change in his district last year was more than
sufficient to wipe out the Democratic majority
in the State in '84. The situation in North
Carolina resembles that in Virginia. With
proper organization and effort, the Repub
licans can carry both States next year.
The Journal did not believe that the Senate
t the United States would be turned into a bear
garden to suit anybody, but that whatever
was done would be done decently and in
prder. The only result of a preliminary con
tea over Mr. Turpie's case would have" been a
dead-lock at best, and according to Mr. Hoar
his credentials were probably sufficient to give
m a prima facie title. The dignity of the
Senate was preserved, and let us hope that
mbstantial justice may finally be done.
The Philadelphia Telegraph calls the tt
tention of the people who are indulging in
peculations as to a possibility of a compro
mise between Mr. Randall and Mr. Carlisle on
the tariff question, to the fact that Mr. Ran
iall is not a changeable person, and that if
there is a compromise the opposition will have
to make the concessions. "The essence of
the whole matter is," says the Telegraph,
'that Uncle Randall's views on the subject of
tariff revision are perfectly well known, and
" "
ire ow what they always have been, and are
especially what they have been during the
last two Congresses while the tariff-smashers
'have been playing their antics. The question
of the moment is not what Randall thinks
and is willing to do in the way of reducing
taxation, but what Messrs. Carlisle & Co. are
thinking about attempting in the way of sav
ing the party matters next year without back
ing down further than the exigencies of very
practical politics imperatively demand." All
of which is very true, and its truth not of a
nature to console the tariff "reformers."
HS. TUBPIE'S CASE.
Mr. Turpie was permitted to take his seat
in the Senate yesterday , without objection,
and took the oath in due form. While this
action will be somewhat of a surprise and dis
appointment to the Republicans of Indiana,
it is not conclusive of the case. It is a recog
nition of Mr. Turpie's prima facie right, but
he takes his seat subject to investigation and
report by the committee on elections and to
the future action of the Senate. The action
yesterday transfers the contest for the present
to the committee, where the case will be
thoroughly investigated and Mr. Turpie's
claim be sharply fought. As the Journal has
repeatedly said, the whole case rests with the
Senate, and it is for that body to decide on
the legality of Mr. Turpie's claim. The Sen
ate is the judge of the qualifications of its
members. It can make its own record and
choose its own company, but it cannot compel
popular indorsement of its decision unless
they are in accordance with law and equity.
Whatever the ultimate decision of the Senate
may be in Mr. Turpie's case, that of the Re
publicans of Indiana is unalterably
fixed that his claim is invalid, that
his pretended election was illegal and uncon
stitutional, and that ha stands before the
country to-day as the representative and re
suit of a high-handed revolution. Mr. Turpie
has no right to a seat in the Senate. He was
not elected by the Legislature of Indiana, nor
in accordance with its Constitution and laws.
The Senate may permit him to hold the seat
he has temporarily captured, and may toler
ate for a term of years the presence of a man
whose title is not only tainted with fraud, but
is the very embodiment of political crime
this the Senate may do, but it cannot change,
the essential facts of the case. The frauds
for which Mr. Turpie's friend and client, Joe
Mackin, is now serving a term in Joliet
prison, did not differ in principle and were no
more iniquitous than the methods on which
rests his fraudulent claim to a seat in the Sen
ate. The Republicans of Indiana know
this, and the Senate can know it
if it choose to. We believe it
will choose to, and that Mr. Turpie's
fraudulent claim will be so thoroughly aired
in the Senate that his seat will be a very un
pleasant one for an honorable man to hold.
Perhaps, in the final conclusion, the Senate
may conclude that the awful dignity of that
body will be better served by throwi ng the
mantle of oblivion over the tattered rags that
serve for Mr. Turpie's senatorial toga. In that
case, the Republicans of Indiana will wish the
Senate much joy of its acquisition, and will
transfer the contest to another field. The
Democratic party in Indiana has so many po
litical sins to answer for that its leaders may
possibly think a few more or less will make no
difference, but it will find the burden very ma
terially increased by the addition of Turpie.
Turpie in the Senate would be an object les
son for the inspiration of Republicans. Per
haps, after all, the Senate could not in any way
more directly and powerfully contribute to
ward making Indiana Republican next year
than by admitting Turpie.
THE WB0NGS OF A NATION.
Mr. Edward H. House, a gentleman whose
name has become familiar to magazine read
ers as the writer of pleasant sketches of Japa
nese life, contributes to the Atlantic Monthly
for December a paper on the wrongs of the
Japanese as a nation, which is of a rather re
markable character and should be widely
read. Mr. House is an American who has
spent many years in Japan, and he writes as
one who has an intimate acquaintance with
the facts of which he speaks and who holds
strong convictions in regard to the matter.
The American public is vaguely aware that
negotiations looking towards the revision of the
treaty with that Western empire have been
in progress from time to time, and have aa
often failed of accomplishing anything; but
few are sufficiently well informed to know
that the United States is assisting to hold in
bondage a nation which deserves its sympa
thy and hearty support a thraldom, too, for
which this country is directly, though unin
tentionally, responsible. The treaty which
was negotiated more than thirty years ago, at
a time when Japan was regarded in the light
of a barbarous nation, contained harsh condi
tions and oppressive restrictions, but it is to
to the credit of the Secretary of State, who
dictated its provisions, that he considered it
but a temporary arrangement. Unfortunate
ly, however, by a careless wording of the in
strument, he made it possible for his own and
for foreign governments wh ich had imposed
similar restrictions to continue the same
terms indefinitely. Prompt advantage was
taken of this verbal accident, and for a quar
ter of a century every effort of Japan to se
cure a favorable revision of the agreements
which were entered into on her part under a
misapprehension, and a rescinding of the objec
tionable stipulations has been in vain. One
of the chief injuries and disabilities from
which Japan suffers under the treaties in
force is due to the fact that she is bound
to an unalterable scale of tariff charges
upon all the imports and exports customs
duties upon all goods imported not being al
lowed to exceed 5 per cent, ad valorem and
is thus deprived of the power of regulating
the revenues. The revenue from customs,
which in some countries defrays a greater por
tion, if not all, of the government expenses,
amounts in Japan to but one thirtieth of the
amount required. As a consequence the nec
essary funds are obtained mainly by taxing
the agricultural classes. As an inevitable re
sult all the trades suffer and the burden upon
the farmers has become almost insupportable.
Financial ruin stares the empire in the face,
and the publio tranquillity is greatly disturbed.
" "
Another outrage imposed upon the country
is the establishment within her territory of
foreign courts of justice, with power of juris
diction ia all suits against their own citizens.
To measure the harm and humiliation which
these two conditions inflict, Mr. House savs,
it is necessary for an American citizen only
to imagine Congress relinquishing the right
to regulate the tariff and turning it over to
European rulers and to contemplate the exist
ence of European tribunals in the seaports of
the United States, exercising unlimited au
thority over the natives of the countries var
iously represented.
Such a condition of affairs is simply slavery,
and the Japanese are justified in refusing to
be longer bound by the treaties. Every hint
at such a proceeding, however, is met with
threats of violence, representatives of En
gland, which country profits most by the
present arrangement, being the most aggress
ive. Overcaution and a native timidity have
thus far prevented recourse to this remedy,
and the political leaders have sought instead
to win the United States to their support. A
strong backing is all that is necessary to
secure for this nation of intelligent, pro
gressive people, all her rights and privileges;
but,'although the United States can well
afford to assume the responsibility, and
though it has always professed an especial
friendship for Japan, its diplomates have
steadily refused to procure relief. At present
the oppressed people are looking hopefully
to Germany, and should they secure that
government as an ally a greater disadvantage
to American trade would result than through
the annulment of the treaties at the instiga
tion of this country. .Whatever may be the
attitude of the United States government
toward' Japan, however, the sympathies of
all American citizens who understand the
situation must be with the patient and
much-enduring people of the island empire.
The meeting at Masonic Hall last night
was one of the largest and best ever held in
Indianapolis for a similar purpose. The ad
dress of Mr. O'Conner was a peculiarly able,
clear, dignified and dispassionate statement of
the case of Ireland. It was pitched upon
the key of splendid reserve that has charac
terized the whole parliamentary struggle
under Mr. Parnell, and which has won for
the struggling people he represents the sym
pathy and support of the civilized world.
Not a harsh or questionable word marred the
speech from beginning to end, and it must
have received the assent of the veriest Tory
had he listened to it. Mr. Esmonde "cut
loose" a little more than Mr. O'Conner, and
there were some expressions he used that
might be tortured into the idea that the con
tention of the Irish party was to break up the
British empire, which is the charge made by
the enemies of Ireland, and which is the sole
basis of the present attitude of such men as
John Bright and the Liberal-Unionist party.
But when Mr. O'Conner and Mr. Esmonde,
too, for that matter said that 'what the
Irish people are fighting for is for that meas
ure of home rule which the States of the
American Union enjoy, he stated a proposi
tion that must enlist the heartiest sympathy
and support of every true citizen of the
United States. On that platform the Irish
people are invincible. The strong and
earnest words of ex-Governor Porter and of
General Harrison, who were on the stage, and
were called out by the large audience, repre
sented the unanimous feeling of the Amer
ican people. The visits of such representa
tives as the two distinguished gentlemen who
spoke last night can but result in renewed
support for the Irish cause from the generous
and liberty-loving people of this free country.
The Journal's Washington dispatches are
full of interest this morning, and not the
least public interest will attach to the decis
ions of the Supreme Court that are reported.
The decision in the Virginia case is in the
line the court has been going for some time
in the assertion of the rights of States; but the
most important is the Kansas decision, which
vindicates the right of the State to pass pro
hibitory liquor laws without being subject to
claim for property that may be practically de
stroyed thereby. The decisions of the court
have always been clear that States could pass
prohibitory laws, but the contention has been
that such a statute practically deprived brew
ers and distillers of their property without
due process of law. The opinion exhaustively
reviews the scope and effect of prohibitory
laws, and broadly asserts the right of States
to pass such laws for the public benefit. It
also says that the effect of such laws is not to
deprive any one of his property, but simply
declares that property must be so used as not
to interfere with the interests of the people,
which is the condition under which all prop
erty is held and used in this country. The
decision is in the most comprehensive terms,
and will serve to further the fast-growing
public sentiment that the liquor traffic is one
for the strictest regulation and restriction in
the interest of the public good. The decision
will have a depressing effect upon those liquor
dealers who are mailing an effort to elevate
their business to the plane undisputedly occu
pied by business and industries that are not
under the ban of the law, and do not conduce
to pauperism and crime. Justice Field
dissented from certain parts of the decision.
Mr. Harris, Third Assistant Postmaster-
general, a pod-auger Democratic statesman
from Georgia, has tried his hand at issuing an
order. It directs that hereafter all daily
newspaper mail editions shall be weighed at
the postoffice instead of at the railroad de
pots, as the custom has been, in order to
catch early trains. Reformer Harris comes
from a section of country where they have no
daily newspapers nor early morning trains to
speak of, and he evidently doesn't know what
he is about After he has fooled with the
buzz-saw a little he will know more.
The Chicago newspaper which is on Mr.
Blaine's trail will now have to send over another
emissary to look after Miss Gail Hamilton. One
poor, miserable reportorial spy cannot well dog
the steps of both; and on the Democratic theory
that even Mr. Biaine's most distant relative is
politically dangerous, Gail needs watching.

THE EIGHTS OF THE STATES
The United States Supreme Court Deter
mines Two Highly Important Cases.
A State lias a Eight to Prohibit Manufacture
of Intoxicants, Is ;ot Liable for Damages,
and Cannot Be Brought Into Court.
Washington, Dee. 5u A very important de
cision, and one likely to be far-reaching in its
consequences, was rendered in the United States
Sapreme Court to-day, in the so called Kansas
prohibition cases of Mugler against the State of
Kansas, and the State of Kansas against Ziebold
and others. The judgment of the conrt was pro
nounced in a long and elaborate opinion by Mr.
Justice Harlan, who said:
"The general question in each ease is, whether
the prohibition s tat a tea of Kansas are in conflict
with that clause of the fourteenth amendment
which provides that no State shall make or en
force any law which shall abridge the privileges
or immunities of citizens of the United States,
nor shall any State deprive any person of
life, liberty, or property without due process
of law.' That legislation by a State prohibiting
the manufacture within her limits of intoxicat
ing liquors, to be resold or bartered for general
use as a beverage, does not necessarily infringe
any right, privilege or immunity secured by the
Constitution of the United States, is made clear
by the decisions of this eonrt, rendered before
and since the adoption of the fourteenth amend
ment. It is, however, contended that, although
the State may prohibit the manufacture ot in
toxicating liquors for sale or barter within her
limits for general use as a beverage, no conven
tion or Legislature has the right, under our
form of government, to prohibit any citizen from
manufacturing, for his own use or for export or
storage, any article of food or drink not
endangering or affecting the rights of others.
The argument made in support of the first
branch of this proposition, briefly stated, is:
That in the implied compacts between the State
and the citizen, certain rights are reserved by
the latter which are guaranteed by the constitu
tional provisions for the protection of life, lib
erty and property against deprivation without
due process of law, and with which the state
cannot interfere; that among those
rights is that of manufacturing, for ones
own use, either food or drink; that, while accord
ing to the doctrines of the commune, the btate
may control the tastes, appetitites, habits, dress,
food and drink of the citizen, our system of gov
ernment, based upon the individuality and intel
ligence of the people, does not claim to control
him except as to his conduct to ethers, leaving
him the sole judge as to all that only affects
himself.
"It will be observed that the proposition and
the argument made in support of it, equally
concede the right to manufacture drinks for
one's personal use. subject to the condition that
such manufacture does not endanger or affect
the rights of others. If such manufacture does
prejudicially affect the rights and interests of
the community, it follows from the very prem
ises stated by counsel that society has the pow
er to protect itself by legislation against the in
jurious consequences of that business.
As was said in Munn vs. Illinois,
(91 U. S. 124), while power does not
exist with the whole people to control
rights that are purely and exclusively private,
government may require each citizen so to con
duct himself and so to use his own property as
not unnecessarily to injure another. Bat by
whom or by what authority is it to be determined
whether the manufacture of particular articles
of drink, either for general use or for the per
sonal use of the maker, will injuriously affect
the public? Power to determines such questions,
o as to bind all, must exist tomewhere, else
society will be at the mercy of the few who, re
garding only their own appetites or passions,
may be willing to imperil the peace and security
of the many, provided only they are permitted
to do as they please. Under our system that
power is lodged with the legislative branches
of the government. It belongs to that depart
ment to exert what are known as the police
powers of the State. It must determine prima
rily what measures are appropriate or needful
for the protection of the public morals, the
public health, or the public safety. It does cot
at all follow from these principles that
every statute enacted ostensibly for the pro
motion of these ends is to be accepted as a
legitimate exertion of the police powers of the
State. There are, of necessity, limits beyond
which legislation cannot rightfully go. As the
courts mast obey the Constitution rather than
the law-making department of government,
they must, upon their responsibility, determine
whether in any particular case these limits have
been passed. The courts are not bound by mere
forms, nor are they to be misled by mere pre
tenses. They are at liberty, indeed, also, under
solemn duty, to look at the substance of things
whenever they enter upon the inquiry whether
the Legislature has transcended the limits of its
authority. If, therefore, a statute purporting to
have been enacted to protect the publio health, the
publio morals, or the public safety, has no real
or substantial relation to those objects, or is a
palpable invasion of the rights secured by the
fundamental law. it is the duty of the courts to
so adjudge, and thereby eive effect to the Con
stitution. Keeping in view these principles as
governing the relations with each other of the
judicial and legislative departments of govern
ment, it is difficult to perceive any ground xor
the judiciarv to declare that the prohibition by
Kansas of the manufacture or saie witnin ner
limits of intoxicating liquors for eeneral use
there as a beverage, is not fairly adapted to the
end of protecting the community against the
evils which confessedly result from the exces
sive use of ardent spirits.
"There is here no justification for holding
that the State, under the guise merely of police
regulations, is aiming to deprive the citizen of
his constitutional rights; for we cannot shut out
of view the fact, within the knowledge of all.
that the public health, the public morals and
the public safety, may be endangered by the
general use of intoxicating drinks. Nor can we
ignore the fact, established by statistics accessi
ble to evervone, that the disorder, pauperism
and crime prevalent in the country are in large
measure directly traceable to this eviL If,
therefore, a State deems the absolute prohibi
tion of the manufacture and sale within her
limits of intoxicating liquors for other than
medical, scientific and manufacturing pur
poses, to be necessary to the peace
and security or society, the courts cannot.
without usurping legislative functions,
override the will of the people as
thus expressed by their chosen representatives.
It is a fundamental principle in our institutions,
indispensable to the preservation of publio lib
erty, that one of the separate departments of
government shall not usurp powers committed
bv the Constitution to another department.
And so, if in the judgment of the Legislature,
the manufacture of intoxicating liquors for the
maker's own use as a beverage would tend to
cripple, if not to defeat their efforts to guard the
community against the evus attending tne ex
cessive use of such liquors, it is not lor tne

courts, noon their views as to wnas is iess ana
safest for the community, to disregard the legis
lative determination of that question. So far
from such a regulation being inappropri
ate to the general end sought to
be accomplished, it ia easy to be seen
that the entire scheme of prohibition.
as embodied in tne i;onsiiiuiiou ana iw u
Kansas, might fail if the right of each citizen
to manufacture intoxicating liquors for his
own use as a beverage were recognized. Such
a right does not inhere in citizenship. Nor can
it be said that the government interferes with
or impairs any one's constitutional rights of
liberty or of property, when it determines that
the manufacture and sale of intoxicating
drinks for general or individual use as a bever
age are or may become hurtful to society and to
every member of it, and is therefore a business
in which no one can lawfully engage. This con
clusion is unavoidable, unlets the fourteenth
amendment of the Constitution takes from the
States of the Union those powers of police
that were reserved at the. time the original
Constitution was adopted. But this court has
declared, upon full consideration (in Barbier vs.
Connelly, 113 U. S. 31), that the fourteenth
amendment had no such effect.
"With reference to the assertion that the pro
hibition of the manufacture and sale of liquor
deprives liquor-dealers of their property with
out due process of law. tee court says tnat all
property, under our form of government, is sub
ject to the obligation that it shall not be used so

rounity and thereby become a nuisance. The
State of Kansas bad a rignt to pronioit tne
liquor traffic It did not thereby take away the
property of the brewers. It simply abated a
nuisance. The property is not taken away from
its owners; they are only prohibited from nsing
it for a specific purpose wnicn the Legislature
declared to be injurious to the eommuuitv.
"For the reasons stated," says Justice liarlan,
we are of opinion that Mugler, the plaintiff in
error, has not been denied by the judgments of
the Supreme Court ot Kansas, aoy rignt, privi-
eee or immunity secured to him by the Consti
tution of the United States, and its judgment in
each case ia accordingly affirmed. We are also
of opinion that the Circuit Court of the United
States erred in dismissing the bill of the State
in her suit against Ziebold and 11 age I in. The
decree in that case is reversed and tne eause
remanded, with directious to enter a decree
granting to the State such relief as the Act of
March 7, lSSo, authorizes."
Justice Field concurred in the opinion as it
related to the two eases In which the State of
Kansas was defendant, but dissented as to
the case of the State of Kansas vs. Zei
bold. He agreed, he said, to so much of
the opinion as sustains the validity of the aet of
Kansas prohibiting the sale of intoxicants
which are manufactured in the State after the
passage of the act. He was not prepared, how
ever, to say that the prohibition of the manu
facture of such liquors, if earned for exporta
tion, can be sustained, nor that the State can
forbid the sale, under proper regulations for the
protection of the health and morals of the
people, of any article which Congress may au
thorize to be imported. He was not ready V
admit that New York or any other coast State
can thus defeat an act of Congress. Neither
could he concur in the validity of the thirteenth
section of the Prohibition act of Kansas, because
be believed it authorized the destruction of
property without due process of law. He could
cot see upon what principle the Legislature,
after closing a brewery, can order the destruc
tion of the liquor, which it admits may be valu
able for medicinal or mechanical purposes; nor
could he see why the protection of the morals
of the State required the destruction of bottles
and other utensils, after the liquor had been
emptied from them.
THE VIRGINIA HABEAS CORPUS CASE.
A decisi on was also rendered in the Virginia
habeas corpus cases of Attorney -general Ayers
and Commonwealth's Attorneys Scott and Me.
Cabe, who were imprisoned by order of Judge
Bond, of the United States Circuit Court, for
disobedience to a restraining order forbidding
them to bring suits for the collection of taxes in
eases where tenders have been made by tax
receivable coupons cut from State bonds. The
court, iu a very long and elaborate opinion by
Justice Matthews, holds that the suit in which
Judge bond issued the restraining order in the
Circuit Court, although nominally a suit against
individuals, is in reality a suit against the State
of Virginia, and as such forbidden by the
eleventh amendment to thefedsral Constitution;
that the United States Circuit Conrt had there
fore no authority to entertain such suit; that in
so doing and in issuing a restraining order to
prevent the officers of the State from
discharging their duties under the
laws of the State, Judge Bond
was acting without constitutional warrant, and
that the restraining order and all subsequent
proceedings under it, including the arrest and
imprisonment of the petitioners, were illegal
and without authority. The court therefore
directs that the petitioners. Attorney-general
Ayers and Commonwealth's Attorneys Scott and
McCabe, be at once discharged. The opinion,
which is that of the whole court with the ex
ception of Justice Harlan, who dissents, de
clares that the suit of Cooper vs. Marye, out of
which these proceedings arise, was a suit by
subjects of a foreign State against the State of
Virginia. To a suit of that character the judi
cial power of the Un ited States cannot, by the
eleventh amendment to the Constitution, be ex
tended. The object of that suit was to enjoin
the Attorney-general and the Commonwealth's
Attorneys from bringing any suits in the
name of the Commonwealth to enforce
the collection of taxes for the payment of which
coupons originally attached to bonds had been
tendered. To enjoin the officers of the Common
wealth charged with the supervision and man
tmmtnt of legal proceedings in her behalf from
ging suits in her name is nothing less than
v oin the Commonwealth herself, for only
t r officers can such suits be instituted and
pr .euted. "It cannot be doubted," Justiee
Matthews says, speaking for the court. 'that
the eleventh amendment to the Constitution
operates to oreate an important distinction be
tween contracts of a State with individuals and
contracts between individual parties. In
contracts between a State and individuals,
by virtue of the eleventh amendment
to the Constitution, there being no
remedy by a suit against the State the con
tract is substantially without sanction except
that which arises out of the honor and good faith
of the State itself, and these are cot subject to
coercion; although the State may, at the incep
tion of the contract, have consented to subject
itself to suit, it may subsequently withdraw
that consent and resume its original immunity
without any violation of the obligation of its eon
tract in the constitutional sense. The very ob
ject and purpose of the eleventh amendment
were to prevent the indignity of subjecting a
State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals
at the instance of private parties. It was thought
to be neither becoming nor convenient that the
several States, invested with that large residuum
of sovereignty which bad cot been delegated
to the United States, should be summoned as
defendants to answer the complaints of private
persons, or that the course of their pubiie poli
cy and the administration of their public affairs
should be subject to control by the mandates of
judicial tribunals, without their consent and in
favor of individual interests. By a fair and lib
eral interpretation of the eleventh amendment
it must be held to cover not only suits brought
against a State by name, but those also against
its representatives, where the State, though not
named as such, is nevertheless the only real
party against which alone relief is asked, and
against which the judgment or decree effectively
operates. But this is cot intended in any way to
infringe upon the principle which justifies snitt
against individual defendants, who, under coles,
of the authority of unconstitutional legislation
by the State, are guilty of personal trespass and
wrongs. It need not be apprehended that the con
struction applied to the eleventh amendment in
this ease will embarrass or obstruct the execu
tion of laws of the United States in cases where
State officers are guilty of acting in violation of
thfm, because the United btates deals witn them
as individuals owing obedience to its authoriiv.
The penalties of disobedience may b
visited upon State officers without
regard to the character in which they assume t
act or the nature of the exemption they mi
dead. No thine can be interposed between tb(
individual and the obligation he owes to tbr
Constitution and laws of the United States. If,
therefore, a State officer, under color of Stat,
laws, comes into conflict with the snperiot
authority and valid laws of the United States,
he is stripped of his representative character
and subjected to the consequences of his eon-
duct. The State has no power to impart to mm
any immunity from responsibility to the su
preme law of the United States."
Judge Gresliam's View.
Louisville Courier-Journal.
Judge Walter Q. Gresham, of the United
States Circuit Court, was at the Gait House, last
evening, on his way to Chicago.
The Judge had been spending the day in Har
rison county. Indiana, where his mother resides.
He makes it his custom to come rroni cnicago,
or wherever he is holding court, every month tc
see his mother, who is now becoming quite aged
and feeble.
Sneaking about pontics, the Judce said he waf

As to the mention of his name in connection
with the presidency or vice-presidency, it wat
not warranted. Whilst he had many friends i?
politics, he did not consider it proper to say any
thing particular on this matter while occupying
a position on the bencb,

The vastly superior ability of the Republican
Congressmen, and their training in the school of
Republican legislation that has accomplished
greater beneficent results than have been woo
by the statesmanship of any other country in
the present century, will be the saving element!
of a Congress in which the Democrats are di
vided on every living issue, and only kept to
gether by the ties of a partisanship that is in
spired by no common convictions, and only com
tinues for the purpose of capturing the whole
government and dividing its spoils.
