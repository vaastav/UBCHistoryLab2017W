WASHINGTON'. Dec 7. The Gridiron
Club, compos-'! of forty Washington cor
respondents, scored another notable success
to-nUht on the occasion of the December
dinner. About Ij guests assembled around
the gridiron table at the Arlington Hotel,
which was beautifully decorated for the oc
casion. As usual, the entertainment con
Sifted of burlesques and satires upon pub
lic event and thing, and numerous public
tnjn and tromlnent guests were treated to
the usual course of gridiron broiling, which
Is always of a good-natured kind. Arthur
V. Dunn, the president of tha club, at the
beginning of the dinner announced that
serious affairs of the world would be re
terved for other times, or treated in a
lighter vein, and this was the keynote of
the subsequent proceedings.
The features, as usual, touched upon pub
lic events in a Jocular manner and began
With a menu with a "New Alice In Won
derland." liy the moat delicate Inference
tha illustrations and quotations could be
applied to ?ome of the events in the life of
President Roosevelt.
The arrival of the "Collier Merriment"
(Merrlmac) with a supply of champagne
to fill the bunkers of the diners wa3 a
laughable skit, and the selection of a dele
gate to London to attend the coronation
furnished opportunity for the nomination
of a number of guests for the place and
their rejection for various reasons.
There was quite a large number of rail
road men present, and they were all
brought out in a competition for a beauty
Bhow, and, finally, the prize was awarded
to U. W. Wrenn. The comments of the
members of the club upon the various
qualifications and appearance of these rail
way oificials caused the room to echo with
laughter.
Another laughable skit was a fake meet
ing of an alleged cabinet, in which various
sporting characters appeared and tried to
pass themselves off as the real thing. They
were rinally hustled out unceremoniously.
Among those- who made excellent
l etches were I'ostmaster General Smith,
Senators Allison and Mitchell; the Chinese
minister. Former Senator Carter and Gov
ernor Francis both now connected with the
Louisiana l'urshase Kxposition; Represent
ative Landis. of Indiana; Solicitor Genera!
Richards of the Department of Justice, ami
others. The musical programme, as usual,
was excellent, consisting of solos, quartets
and chorust-.-. as well as catchy topical
EOngs.

AN OFFICE BOY'S STORY.
Says lie Curried Letters from Lutvyer
Sullivan, to JJuilHT Lynch.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7. A number of wit
nesses whose evidence was wanted to show
that ex-Bailiff J. J. Lynch was often in
the office of Alexander Sullivan when the
latter was attorney for the West Chicago
6tret-rallway Company, occupied the
stand in the Sullivan conspiracy case to
day. Emery Warne, Edward Turner, 1.
A. Maroney and Robert Hill, all formerly
connected with the traction company's
legal department, and F. Richardson, for-
rr.srly In the city law department, testi
fied. Hill, who was an otlice boy for Mr. Sul
livan, was sprung as a surprise on the
defense late yesterday. Hill was recalled
the first thing to-day. He said he had
carried letters from Sullivan to Lyncn
aiid that he had brought verbal com
munications for Lynch to meet Sullivan.
He had seen Lynch and Attorney St. John
In Sullivan's olüce many times ns often
as twice and thrice a week sometimes.
On cross-examination the defense brought
out the fact that letters were delivered
in the open courtroom of Judge Clifford,
where Lynch acted as bailiff.
Then Assistant State's Attorney Rarnes
asked: "You didn't wave them in the air
did you?"
'No." Hill answered. "I slipped them to
him quietly."
The testimony of Warne, Turner, Ma
roney and Richardson supported Hill's
story that Lynch called often on Mr.
Sullivan. The defense on cross-examination
brought out assertions that there
seemed to be nothing suspicious about the
meetings. Maroncy stated that he had
often seen Dan Coughlln in Sullivan's of
fice also.
John Gordon, husband of Josephine Gor
don, was a witness and told of forwarding
to Lynch in New York, under the name of
Connors, money which he received from
Dennis Ryan, the custodian of a fund of
J1.5X which had been provided for the
eupport of Lynch during his exile. He
was followed by his wife Josephine, who
corroborated Lynch's narrative wherein it
concerned her and told of conversations
she hid had with St. John about her
brother.

Who Admitted JikIr Iinncey Und

"Writs of Huben Corpus.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7. Andrew M. Lawrence,
nr.anaglng editor of Hearst's Chicago
American, and II. S. Canfield, a reporter,
who were sentenced recently by Judge
Hanecy to forty find thirty days, respec
tively, in the county jail for contempt of
court, were discharged from custody by
Judge Dunne to-day.
In granting a writ of habeas corpus to
the relators, the court ?ald the case hinged
on whether the case on which the Chicago
American commented had been disposed of
by Judge Hanecy, or was still pending.
Judge Dunne held that tho case in question
had been finally disposed of by Judge Han
ecy when he gave his decision from the
bench. The fact that tho clerk had not
entered tho order when the comment on
the decision was printed and published
therefore does not show that the ca?e was
still pending. The act of entering the
order on the record was merely a minis
terial act. Judge Dunne said.
Judge Dunne admitted that the articles
and cartoon which Judge Hanecy objected
to were clearly calculated to intimidate
and coerce the court, had the court not al
ready rendered its decision. Judge Dujine
admitted that the cartoon in evidence was
probably libelous and the articles possibly
so. Harsh criticism. Judge Dunne re
marked, 13 one of the incidents and bur
dens of public life. "I tc no reason," he
said, "why a Judge should be offered a
different remedy fur attacks in the public
prints than a president, or a governor, or
a congressman. Criticism of a public of
ficial, if Just, will do good; if unjust, will
do no harm."
In concluding the court said: "I am clear
ly of the opinion that the language used
in open court by Judge Hanecy amounted
to a linal order disposing of the case under
consideration, and that being a linal order,
under the doctrine of 'contempt, ' as laid
down in this State by our Supreme Court,
in Story vs. the People, that the relators
had a right to comment and criticise that
decision, even to the extent of libeling tho
honored and respected jud who rendered
that opinion without exposing themselves
to prosecution for contempt of court."
Following is Judge Hanecy's comment on
Judge Dunne's decision: "Judge Dunne
had the ;uvtr to so decide, but he did not
have the right. Any Judge has the power
to let every prisoner out of the peniten
tiaries, but thty have not the riht, nor
dews anybody expect that they will."
The contempt case and the habeas corpus
hearing which followed grew out of r.n ef
fort made by the Chicago American to se
cure an order for uuo warranto proceed
ings to compel the People's (JuslUht
and Coke Company to show by what right
they operated in Chicago. Judge Hanecy
lefused to allow the quo warranto pro
ceedings and following this refusal the
American printed articles and a cartoon
strongly intimating that the Judge had
ben unduly Influenced and that when ha
again came up for election he would dis
cover that the people had no confidence in
him. Judge Hanecy cited Lawrence and
Cantleld, with oth-.-rs of the paper, for con
tempt and found Lawrence and Canneld
guilty. W. II. Hearst, owner of the paper,
Clare Briggs and Homer Davenport, car
toonifts, have not letn within the Juris
diction of the court and the contempt
charge still pnds against them. The evi
dence heard by Judge Hanecy was re
viewed before Judge Dunne.

HALO OF HEVELIUS.
Great Sun. Circle, Itnrely Seen, Oli-
Kcrvcd 1y n Professor of Pliynlos.
CLEVELAND, O., Dec. 7. A remarkable
meteorological observation that will un
doubtedly become historical in astronomy
was made here yesterday by Rev. Frederick
Odenbach, S. J., professor of physics in St.
Ignacius College. The observation was that
of the great sun circle, or halo of Hevelius,
which has only been observed three times
before, and probably never eo perfect. Pre
ceding a period of low barometric pressure,
halos are often noticed about the sun. The
commonest öf these halos is one that ap
pears at a distance of 22 degrees from the
sun. An outer halo, at a distance of 4S de
grees, is also occasionally noted. But the
great halo of Hevelius, at a distance of SO
degrees, as observed by Professor Oden
bach, is a great rarity, and hundreds of
years may pass before It is observed again.
The inner circle of 22 degrees was com
plete, portions of the 4S-degree circle were
distinct and the great circle of Hevelius
was distinct for half Its circumference.
ITO KLFISED A PASS.
JapancHC Itallronds Compel All Trav
elers to Pay.
Saturday Evening Post.
Marquis Ito, the Japanese statesman,
said, while In St. Paul recently, that of all
the American customs that impressed him
ns peculiar the free transportation ex
tended by the railroads of this country
seemed most odd.
"Why," said he, "should a railroad give
away tickets? Every bit of mileage to
them is the same as a piece of cloth to a
dry goods firm. In Japan every one has
to ray for his transportation. I never rode
on a Japanese railroad for nothing in my
life."
When the Marqulsa and party decided to
proceed east from St. Paul .over the Mil
waukee line the officials of the road ex
tended to the distinguished Japanesa and
his companions the courtesy of the line
and informed Mr. Ito's private secretary
that the tickets and the private car coit
nothing. The secretary was visibly em
barrassed and shook his head dubiously as
he left the office of the company to convey
the startling information to hU master.
Shortly afterward Marquis Ito appeared at
the railroad office and insisted on paying
for the tickets and the use of the special
car.
"I have no claim to your esteemed com
pany," said the Oriental. "I should not feel
riht in traveling over your most excellent
road without paying for the great pleas
ure." And so the Milwaukee officials were ob
llged to carry the Marquis and his party
over their line in the same way as if they
were Just plain, every-day Americans.
Luxuries for Prisoners.
New York Commercial Advertiser.
It has always been the boast that
Americans treated their prisoners better
than any other country, but If the state of
affair3 at Fresnes. just outside Paris, is
typical of all French prisoners, America
is left sadly in the rear. We find on the
list of things provided for next year such
items as 1,: kilos o apple marmalade,
i squares cf chocolate, -J ) kilos of ti-s.
2-) kilus of plums, 1X0 kilos of Spanish
licorice, 150 kilos of caramel, 1.2j kilos
of coffee and 2,"J kll-.es of sugar. The
authorities of Fresnes are arguing that it
is better to turn a well man out of prison
than a sick one, and good food and varied
Is the best thing for euch a purpose. The
result is that the prisoners will be fed
much better than many of the taxpayers
and Fresnes prison is likely to become very
popular.

UiNCLE SAM'S PLAYTHINGS
CURIOUS COLLECTIOX OF TOYS
FOl'.ND IX NATIONAL MUSEUM.
Dolls of AU Nation nnd n, Variety of
GnniCH Played by Children of
Far Countries.
VT. II. Chandle?, in St. Nicholas.
It will doubtless surprise many readers
of the December St. Nicholas to learn
that Uncle Sam has one of the largest
collections of toys in the world. He keeps
them in the National Museum at Washing
ton, where they may be seen by hundreds,
nicely arranged and labeled, in the exhibi
tion hall. But on the balcony in the west
end of the big building is the real Santa
Claus shop. Lie tho spider's parlor in the
nursery song, tho way to this wonderland
is "up a windln? stair."
On each sido of the long balcony Is a
range of tall pine cases fitted with drawers
in which are stored toys and games from
all parts of thei world. To be sure, these
drawers contain many ether interesting ob
jects besides, for it is in this department
that everything relating to ethnology i3
sorted and catalogued for exhibition. Eth
nology is the science which tells us of
human races in thtir progress from sav
agery to civilization how people in all
parts of the world live, of the things they
use in every-day life, and how they use
them.
The toys and games In Uncle Sam's col
lection have been gathered, by his agents,
from every known country. Many of them
are rare and costly, and beautifully made;
but tha mot interesting and unuual are
tha product of uncivilized hands. Some
are gorgeously colored and decorated with
beads and shells, while others aro grimy
and pitifully mean; but they have each
brought their measure of joy to some child
ish heart, somewhere.
MANY KINDS OF DOLLS.
Of dolls alone there are enough to give
any little reader a new one every day
until she becomes too old to care longer
for them! ivory babies from Alaska, dress
ed in little coats of deer fur to protect
them from an Arctic winter; South Sea
island puppets with scarcely any clothes at
all; Indian papooses decked with beads and
buckskin; pink-cheeked waxen beauties
from Paris; ulmond-eyed Japanese in red
kimonos; black wooden images from the
Kongo; and various other dolls fashioned
from clothes-pins, pine cones, and corn
husks: Some In rags,
Some in jas.
And some in velvet gowns.
Uncle Sam is especially rich In Alaskan
dolls. Some of them are of ivory, no bigger
than your thumb, but the clothing Is made
viith the greatest care from the s.iftit
sealskin, trimmed with bend and edged
with white hair from the lt of the deer.
Others are two or three feet In height and
are carved from wood and equally well
dressed, even to thtir mittens, kin caps
with earnajs. and their perfectly correct
snowshoes. Then there are the dolls of
the Zunl and the Moqui Indians of Arizona
and New Mexico. These are a brüll. nt and
cheerful gathering and occupy a drawer all
to themselves. Some are made of wood
ar.d others of baked clay, and all are paint
ed in gaudy colors. Some among them have
real hair done up In tunny little knots
above their tars, er in braids, with feath
ers and red flannel. I show you a picture
of one of them; he represeutH a fire dancer.
HU body Is painted black and is spangled
all over with glistening tinstl. which makes
him appear as if he were- covered with
parks.
TOYS OF THE ESKIMOS.
Many of the more beautiful toys were
made by the Eskimos. During the long
Arctic nights th.ce wonderful little people
carve, from the tueVs of the walrus, figures
of evcrv conceivable Ehare and dtsln.
Often entire villages are made, the huts,
bldarkees (or canoes) and dog sledges be
ing in perfect miniature. The dogs aro
cut of fine-grained white wood, and
are most natural in their attitudes.
Tho toy makers of Nuremberg or of
Switzerland could not have done more
skillful work. The art of these Arctic folk
Is the more wonderful when one considers
the very primitive tools which they have to
use. The knife with which they carve the
dainty little figures is seldom more than
a bit of steel barrel hoop ground down to
an edge and lashed with thongs of walrus
hide to a handle of bone or drift wood.
The toys of the Zuni Indians are modeled
in clay and baked to prevent them from
crumbling. Cows, goats and frogs, streaked
and spotted with paint, hold the first place
In this collection, but there are also clay
whistles and bird warblerc, the latter quite
like the tin ones seen In our shop windows.
The bird is made to sing by tilling its hol
low body with water and blowing through
a tube inserted in its back. There are also
clay rattles of various shapes and sizes in
the Zunl exhibit, and wooden birds that
flap their Jointed wings like those we hang
upon our Christmas tree.
INDIAN AND PERSAN GAMES.
In the collection of games there are a
great many objects interesting either for
the oddity of their shape, curious opera
tion, or beauty of workmanship. One novel
game consists of four pieces of bone at
tached by a brad string- to a long steel bod
kin. The bodkin is held in one hand and
the bonee tossed up into the air. A skillful
player may succeed in catching one or mors
of the bones upon the steel point, and
scores accordingly. This game Is a favorite
with the Indians, and is not unlike our own
game of "cup-and-ball."
A card game from Persia, valued at many
hundreds of dollars, has its board inlaid in
folid gold; and a set of chessmen from
India are of beautifully carved ivory, each
"man" being at leas-t four inches in height.
Another curious game, from which our
"Jack straws" is probably descended, con
sists of a bundle of arrows of carved ivory
or wood. It was an ancient custom to tcss
these arrows into the air, and after they
tell to the ground they were drawn out ly
tho men grouped around them. In thH
tr.anner, and according to the' numbers and
j-ymbols upon the arrow, captains were ap
pointed in the army and various duties
were assigned to the soldiers.
The so-called "bull-roarer." one of the
oldest of toys, has an interesting history.
It is nothing more than a bit ot wood at
tached to a string, which on being whirled
around rapidly, produces a loud, rumbling
sound. The ancient Pgyptians believed that
the tumbling of the "bull-roarer" would hi
answered by the rumbling of thunder; con
sequently, during a drought th men would
sally forth "bul'.-roan rs" In hand, to in
voke the ruin-god to send them water from
the skies. This curious toy U .-tili used by
some savage tribe?, who be-Ihve its roaring
noise will frishten away evil Fpirits that
may be lurking near.

are light brown, with black manes and
very swift, with wonderful agility. They
know well how their ancestors once swept
Europe, and they have a Arm belief that
some day a leader will arise and regain
their lost kingdom.
To me there is something: very pathetic
in this confidence among race? once pow
erful, but now subjected, that the dr.y will
I coma when they will relnherlt their own.
i Perhaps It ie well they should have this
little glow of patriotism In their hearts.
To-day the Uurlats arc pastoral. They
live chit-Hy on milk, millet, and sheep killed
on feast days. Their wealth consists in
immense herds of cattle; some of them
even nossess fnrtv nr fiftv thousand head.
I In the cases of families owning great herds
! the life Is quite partlarchal. Though sons
and daughters marry, tho new wives ana
new husbands must come and live in the
family camp. Dung is used as fuel. The
commonest is that of horses pounded under
foot by tho women and then sun-dried.
That of goats and sheep gives the fiercest
heat, and is k pt for winter use.
In religion the-y are Buddhists, bu j have
only been so for three centuries. They are
fond of making pilgrimages to Ourga.
where there is a "living Buddha." So
great Is this devotion that a Burla t will
frequently surrender the whole of his prop
erty to some shrine on condition he receives
just enough to live upon.

We saw clusters of tents exactly like the
red Indian tents. They belonged to the
aborigines, Buriat Mongols, who are van
ishing before the Muscovites n. the red
skins are vanishing hefore the Saxons.
Whtn the train halted I had ood opor
tunity for seeing th se ieopI. They are
first cousins to the Chinese, but all I rn t
stiuck m3 as being broader, more sturdily
built than the Chinee. Thfir faces are
round rather than long, but their cheek
bones are prominent. The eye is a wann,
good-natured brown. Their skins are r.t
the Chinese sickly saliow. but a ruddy
bronze. They are all good-looking mt n.
and had I met them in Nevada, it would
never have struck me they were not red
Indians.
The women folk, however, would have
put me riht. Without bing accused cf
lark of gallantry, the Indian squaw is one
of the laat ladles on earth for whom it
would be possible to roue admiration
coare, fat to unwleldiness. and with as
much expression as a potato. But these
Buriat women are often handsome with
tie kind it good lor.ks you fometlmes s e
among Spanish Jewesses, only much dark
er. The features were well cut. the nose
refined, and the eyes black and brilliant.
Thir hair was really black. As they
walked about In their gay. red print frocks
and no other color would suit then so
well they h:id a long, easy swing of the
limbs that showed good physique. The
elder women get wrinkk-d-faced and rather
uncertain in their gait. Yet distinction re
mains with them.
About both men and women there Is a
Chicago Times-Herald.
"Workmen are receiving 5 to 10 cents an
hour premium over and above the union
scale of wages in several trade? In the
building industry because of the great de
mand for their servic s in keeping pace
with the unprecedented building boom in
Chicago and throughout the countiy. In
the mechanical branches all are employed
and so many more are wanted that. Chi
cago contractors are scouring the country
for good men and offering special induce
ments in the way of wages and accommo
dations. As for Chicago, contractors agree that
the present building boom eclipse i the
palmy days of the world's fair time, and
surpasse. anything of the kind in the his
tory of the city. Because of the scarcity
of good workmen many builduics have
been delayed sev ral weeks in their, erec
tion. The rush of work of the world' fair
season did not last as long as tho present
boom.

The occurrence of tetanus in some ch!l

should ! scrupulously '1 an, and the part
