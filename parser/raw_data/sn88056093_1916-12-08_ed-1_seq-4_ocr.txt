Washington. Nov. 20.—Ten members
of t'ongress. five Senators and five
mem hers of the House of Representa
tives, began here today an inquiry Into
the subject of public control and su
pervision of railroads that may lead to
the revolutionizing of the whole scheme
of governmental regulation of the coun
try's transportation lines. Incidentally
the committee is to look into the ques
tion of government ownership of rail
ways, telephone and telegraph lines
end express mmpanies.
The members of the committee
which will conduct this important In
vestigation are Senator Newlands of
Nevada, chairman; Senators Robinson
of Arkansas Underwood of Alabama,
Cummins of Iowa and Rrandegee of
Connecticut, and Representatives Ad
amson of Georgia, Sims of Tennessee,
l ollop of Indiana, Esch of Wisconsin
nil I Hamilton of Michigan. The in
quiry was recommended by President
Wilson in his message to Congress in
I »ecember of last year. He described
as its purpose to determine what could
he done "for bettering the conditions
under which the railroads are operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole."
Prominent Men as Witnesses.
In order to obtain the views of all 1
interests affected by the operations of I
the transportation lines the committee I
bus Invited prominent shippers, hank- !
'•is, representatives of commercial
ganizatipns, railway executives, econo
mists and others to appear before them.
The first to he heard are railroad
commissioners of various states who ■
began their

testimony is dire ted chiefly to oppos- j

the commission may devote Its ener

With the commission thus relieved
of some of its present duties and equip
ped to bandle Its business more prompt
ly., the railroads will urge that the pe
riod during which the commission may
now suspend proposed increases In
rates be reduced from ten months to
110 days, with provision for reparation
to be paid to the shippers If the ad
vance shall he declared unreasonable.

They will also ask that the commis
sion be given the power to prescribe
minimum as well as maximum rates
so that in meeting complaints of dis
crimination the commission may order
the advance of a rate which it consid
ers too low.
One of the most important recom
mendations for which the railroads
will ask favornble consideration Is
that the commission lie specifically
authorized to take into account in
rate regulation the effect of rates
upon total earnings in the light of ex
penses.
While the Newlands Committee is
required, under the resolution creat
ing it, to submit a report by January
2 next, it is not anticipated tliut the
Committee will have coiue anywhere
near completing its labors then.
