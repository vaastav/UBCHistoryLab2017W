JUDGE .1. K. IIA9QN
In the death of Juiee .1. K. ?Mann
tnis community has sustained a groat
loss. He was an upright, just man.
an able judge and conscientious in
the discharge of his otbeial duties al?
most to a fault, if such a thing wot o
possible. His menta! capacity and
inclination for work were far be?
yond his physical strength,and there
is little doubt but the* too close ap?
plication to the discharge of his du?
ties shortened his days and deprived
this judicial circuit of many years of
able service at his hands. Judge Ma?
son was a man of courtley manners
and charming personality and it is
doubtful if he had an enemy in the
world. In the estimation of lawyers
and friends he had elevated the ju?
diciary of the State and his place will
be hard to til!. His stricken family
will have the sympathy of this entire
community and we unite with them
in mourning his loss.
THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
President Taft's message to <\>n
gress exceeds in length any previous
message and covers almost, if not
every, topic of public importance.
some briefly and some at length.
The message is marked by conserva?
tive utterance, which can ?always ?be
expected from Mr. Taft.and contains
nothing calculated to disturb busi?
ness conditions at this time and
therefore in this respect is pleasing.
The President in view of the late
election evidently did not fed that
he could indulge in any very fervid
defence of the tariff bill, though he
g >es so far as to say that it has l?<.?-n
misrepresented and misunderst'n??i.
He is careful not to repeat that it is
the best tariff bill the country has
ever had and in fact takes up nearly
all Ute space devoted to th
?s discussion of tl mission
on whoa
gress "
?
? ? ?
recori.in?.r..:. ?the future.
?the mcaaeg?
ing with the law's delays will meet
hearty approval as will a numU-r of
other minor r?. commendations. On
the whole the message is what was
exp?ect-?d from Mr. Taft.
Had our colored population in?
creased on the same ratio with the
white Frederickburg woulc
have passed the 6,000 mark, and
would have done so anyhow had tht
Council secure?! the annexation of
the adjoining territory to which
many of our people have removed.
Congress starts up again and the
weather is no doubt in keeping with
the feelings of the many lame ducks
in both houses.
ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE SENT
BULLET INTO ANTI-SALOON OFFICE
T. J. Bums an electrical contractor.
Monday cleared up the mystery sur?
rounding the bullet which was fired in?
to the office of the Anti-Saloon League
Sunday afternoon and which would
have killed Rev. J. D. McAllister had
be been at his desk. Burns states that
be was repairing a revolver and the
cartridge was accidentally discharged.
He paid no attention to the matter, for
be did not dream until Monday that the
bullet had passed through the door. As
?soon as he ascertained the bail had
gone into the building across the alley,
he notified the police and explained how
tbe thing happened.
SUGGESTS FOOTBALL CHANGES
The abolition of the forward pass
over the line of scrimmage, re?
duction of the distance to t>e gain?
ed in four downs from ten to sev?
en yards, and allowing the runner
to "tack on" to another playr in
hitting the line, are three football
changea that George Foster San
ford, the "man who built Yale's
wonderful defense thla year," be?
lieves would greatly help the game
Sanford says the rules committee
haa plenty of work to do before
the game reaches the desired pop?
ularity. The three changts men?
