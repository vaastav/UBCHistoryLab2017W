TUB PRESIDENTS ITTKSSAGi
Washington Dec 1 1884
President Arthurs annual message wuti
transmitted to Congress to day At tho ouV
ret tho President refers to the recent politic d
contest which resulted in the election Jf
Cleveland as President He remarks that it
Is a subject of general congratulation that
after tho controversy despite the closenos of
the vote the public peace has suffered no dis
turbance and the people awaited the result
patiently and quietly Nothing could mow
strikingly illustrate tho temper of
citizens and their loyalty to law
signally demonstrate the strength
American
nor more
and wis
dom of our political Institutions
FOItEION BKLATION8
Our relations with all foreign Powers ron
tinuo amicable The Congo question is com
mented upon as one of great international
importance Tho rich prospective trade of
tho Congo ValloyMeads to the conviction that
it should be open to all nations on equal
terms The necessary legislation to make ef
fective our Mexican commercial treaty Is rec
ommended as one of the first measures to
claim attention from Congress The Nica
rauguan Treaty recently concluded which
authorizes the construction of a canal and
railway by the San Juan and Lake Nlca
raugua Route tjie President believes will
command universal approval at home and
abroad to the United States and the ooinmer
cial and political advantages of the treaty
cannot bo overestimated Tho approval of
the new Spanish Commercial Treaty which
is soon to be submitted to the Senate id
urged
The question of an International copyright
law Is brought to tho attention of Congress
He recommends the enlargement of tho
scope of neutrality laws to cover acts of hos
tility committed within our territory and
aimed at the peace of friendly nations He
sees no reason why overt perpetrations in
this country for tho commission of buch
criminal acts should not be alike punishable
whether intended to bo committed in our
own or lua foreign country with which we
are at peace
A reorganization of tho diplomatic and
consular servko is recommended
ON THE SUIUECT OF F1NANCB
The President concurs with the Secretary of
tho Treasury recommending an immediate
fcuspeiifdon of tho coin ago of silver dollars
and tho issuance of silver certificates Tho
fact that of tho 1850000UG coined during
tho past six years but little more than 40
000000 is in actual circulation seems to fur
nish n cogent argument for the repeal of the
statute
TAXES
Ho reuows his recommendations of 1S33
favoring tho abolition of all taxes except
thoso relating to distilled spirits If thewj
taxes are abolished the rovenua remaining to
tho government will not sufllco to meet all
reasonable expenditures but will afford a
surphu largo enough to penult such a tariff
reduction as may seem advisable when tho
results of tno recent revenue laws and com
mercial treaties shall have dhown in what
quarters these reductions can bo most Judi
ciously effected
FOHEION CARRYING TRAPK
Tho President says that although fully sen
sible objections aro made to the appointment
of a commiss on to ascertain the most effective
mVarnof Increasing our foreign trade still
be believes this Will be tho most speedy anil
efficacious method He endorses the recom
mendation of the Secretary of the Treasury
favoring liberal subeldles to mall steamship
Jines as an Incentive to the Investment of
American capital in American steamships
and declares that unless that courso be pur
sued the foreign carrying trade will remain
as It Is to day almost exclusively In the hands
of foreigners
NATIONAL BANK CIRCULATION
On tho subject if a basis for national bank
circulation he says tho three per cent bonds
of the Government to the amount of more
than 10000000 havol since his last message
boen redeemed by the Treasury Uonds of
that Issue still outstanding amount to a little
over 00000000t about one fourth of which
will bo retired through tho operations of the
Sinking Fund during the coiiilijc year A
these bonds still continue the chief basis fpf
the circulation of the Rational banica
the question how to avert a con
traction of tho currency caused by
their retirement is one of constantly
increasing Importance It teoms to bo gen
erally coiiAHlod that tho law governing tills
matter exacts from tho banks nu excessivu
security that upon their present bond de
08it8 a larger circulation than is now allowed
may bo granted with safety It hopes tho
bill which poised tho Senate at tho last session
of Cofigre permitting the Issue of notes
equal on their face valuo to deposited bonds
will commend itsolf to tho approval of tho
House of Representatives
CONCERNING SEA HOARD DEFENSES
For our cities recommended by the Secre
tory of War ho says Tho time has now
come when such defenses can be prepared
with confidence that they will not prove
abortive when a possible result of delay in
making such preparation is seriously consid
ered the delay seems inexcusable For tha
most important cities those whose destruc
tion or capture would bo a national humilia
tionan adequate defense inclusive of guns
may be made by the gradual expenditure of
sixty million of dollars a sum much less than
the victorious enemy could lovy as contribu
tions An appropriation of about one tenth
of that amount is asked to begin the work I
concur with the Secretary of War in urging
that it be granted
MANUFACTURE OF CANNON
Ho renews his recommendation contained
in his spocial message to the lost Congress
favoring the establishment of two Govern
ment factories ono for tho army and one for
the navy fcV the manufacture of heavy-cannon
and urges Congress to act so as to enable
the Government to construct its own ordi
nance upon its own territory and provide
armaments demanded by the considerations
of our national safety and honor Concern
ing tho reconstruction of
THE NAVY
He says In this tho last of my State mes
sages I shall havo tho honor to trauBmit to
Congress I cannot too strongly urge upon
its attention the duty of restorlug the navy
as rapidly as possible to tho high state of ef
ficiency which formerly characterized it As
a long peaco that has lulled us Into a sonso of
fancied security may at any time be dis
turbed it Is plain policy that strengthening
this arm of the service is dictated by consld
eiatfons of wise economy a just regard and
a true appreciation of the dignity and honor
of a republic
THE POSTAL SERVICE
The report of the Postmaster General says
It discloses tho gratifying fact that the loss tc
the postal revenues during the last year froiri
a reduction of letter postage to two cents has
been less than was expected only 22750001
This he considers a trustworthy indication
that the revenue will soon bo restored to if
former volume by the natural increase o
Eealed correspondence
He approves the recommendation of th
unit weight with first class mall matter an 1
It should be an ounco instead of a half ounj
as it now Is He recommends a reduction of
postage on drop letters to ono cent and re
commends an extension of the free deli Tory
system
rRE EMPTION LAWS
lie concurs with tho Secretary of tho Inte
rior In adyising the repeal of the pre emption
laws and enactment of the Rtntutos resolving
tho present legal complications touching
lapsed grants to railroad companies and the
funding of tho debt of several pf tho Pacific
railways undr such a guaranty as shall ef
fectually socure 1U untlinato payment
POLYGAMY
Ho believes that if polygamy can be sup
pressed in Utah by law it can only be dona
by the most radical legislation consistent with
tho restraints of the constitution and recom
mends Congress to assume absolute political
control of the Territory of Utah and provide
for the appointment of Commissioners with
mch governmental powers as In its judge
ment may justly and wisely be put Into their
hands
OUR FOREIGN TRADE
The President devotes much Bpace to a con
sideration of the olicy of the Government
regarding the extension of our foreign trade
Tho mafn conditions of tho problem aro thus
stated We aro f peoplo apt In mechanical
pursuits and fertile in invention we cover a
vast extent of territoiy aro rich in agricul
tural products and nearly nil tho raw ma
terials needed for successful manufac
ture Wo have a system of productive
ehtablhhments more than sufficient to supply
our own demands The wages of labor aro
nowhere else so groat tho scale of living by
our artisan eJaases Is such as tends to secure
their iwronal comfort and development and
these higher moral and Intellectual qualities
that go to making good citizens Our
system of tax und tariff legislation
is yielding a revenue In excess of
tho present needs of tho Government Theo
are elements from which Is sought to dovlso
a scheme by which without unfavorably
changing the condition of tho workmgman
our merchant marine may bo raised from its
enfeebled condition to now markets provided
for the sale beyond our own borders of tho
manifold fruits of industrial enterprise Tho
problemn is complex It can bo solved by no
single juea suro or Innovation or reform Tho
countries of tho American continent and ad
jucent islands are for tho United States
the natural marts of supply and
demand It is from thorn we
should obtain what wo do not produce or
do not prod tico In sufficient quantity and It
Is to them that the surplus productions of our
tIttt ir iRini1 Ir
filis mills ami workshops should flow Un
d conditions thai will equalize or favor
ttom In comparison with foreign competition
four paths policy tho President says soems
to point to this oud
First A series of reciprocal commercial
treaties with countries which shall foster be
tween us and thorn tho unhampered move
ment of trade The conditions of theso
treaties should be tho free admission of such
merchandise as this country does not produce
In return for the admission free or under a
favored scheme of duties of our own pro
ducts The benefits of such an oxchange to
apply only to goods carried under
the flag of parties to the contract of removal
on both sides from vessels so privileged ot
all tonnage dues aud national imports so that
thoso vessels may ply unhindered between
our ports and thoso of other contracting par
ties though without infringing upon tho re
served homo coasting trade the removal or
reduction of burdens on exported products of
thoso countries coming within tho benefits of
treaties and tho nvoldancj of technical re
strictions und penalties by which our inter
course with those countries is ut present ham
pered
Secondly Tho establishment of a consular
servjea of tho United States on a salaried foot
Ingthu3 permitting tho relinquishment of con
sular fees nut only as respects vessels under
the national flag but tils the vessels of treaty
nations carrying goods entitled to tho benefits
of thoso treaties
Thirdly The enactment of measures to
favor the construction and maintenance of u
steam carrying marine under tho flag of tho
United States
Fourthly The establishment of a uniform
currency on a basis for countries of America
so coined from the products of
our own mines that It may circulate on equal
terms throughout tho whole system of com
monwealths This would require a monetary
anion of rAmerica whereby the output or dui
Hon producing countries and circulation in
those which yield neither gold nor
rilver could be adjusted in con
formity with the population wealth
tnd commercial noeds of each
As many of the countries furnish no bullion
to tho common stock tho surplus produc
tion of our mines and mints initrht thus be
JtilJzed and a stop bo takon toward a general
remonetization of silver to accomplish these
1 mds As for as can bo attained by the sep
irate treaties the negotiations already con
cluded and now in progress have been di
rected in fvor of which this enlarged policy
iias thus fur received warrants the belief its
i jorations will ere long embrace all or
aeorly all tho countries of this hemisphere
it Is by no means desirable however that
he policy under consideration shon bo ap
plied to those countries alone A healthful
mlargement of our trade with Europe Asia
ind Africa should bo sought by reducing the
j ariff burdens on such of their wares as
wither we nor other American States
ire fitted to produce thus enabling
urselves to obtain in return a better
narket for our supplies food raw materials
ind manufacturers in which we excel It
teems tho embarrassing elements in tho great
latlonal conflict production and free trade
nay thus be turned to good account that
ha revenue may be reduced so as to no longer
vertax people Protective duties may bo
retained without becoming burdaisome Our
ihlpping Interest may bo judicially encour
iged and the currency fled on a
3rm basis and above all such a
anity of interests established among tho
States of the American system as to be to the
rreat and ever Increasing advantage to them
ill All treaties in the line of this policy
tvhlch havo been negotiated or are in pro
cess of negotiation contain a provision
leemed to bo requisite under a clauso of tho
Constitution limiting to the House of Ropro
icntatives authority to originate bills for
raising a revenuo

RESPECTING CIVIL SERVICE

A BANKRUPT LAW
The President in view of the general de

llfferenco of seutiment heretofore preventing
It may not outlast the present session of Con
gress
OTOER TOPICS

A FLOOD OF WHISKY
Canadians bbjeet to thaftf roam Io tir
ing lit CJpon Them
Joronto Ont Doc 2 The prospect of
ood of cheap Ajuerican whisky has cre
iled a Mutation In this city and in tho Prov
ince The distillers will probably seek pro
tective legislation to keep it out and tho
ttmpcranco party will bo compelled to back
iiem up as they say There Is too much in
he country now of our own make let alone
f our neighbors production Tho hotel
lion thoso that will bo left by tho Scott act
ppelcomo the prospects of tho flood as they
lay they will need all the profit that can bo
iqueezed out of tho business Thero was a
Jme when whisky was twenty flvo cents a
mllon in this country If something Is not
lone to keep out the Kentucky aiticle it will
Do ul in or t as cheap again
This trepidation among tho Canadian liquor
nen arises from the fact that two Americans
epresentatives of several of tho leading dls
illeriesof tho United State have just been
ui Toronto endeavoring to make nrrange
nents for exporting into Canada a portion of
ho enormous quantity of whisky now lying
n bond in the United States and which mus
do taken out in a very short time ns Con
gress has decided that tho duty must bo paid
ihnost immediately Thoy interviewed the
nland revenue officers and others josted on
he subject and also talked with reprosentn
ives of tho Canadian distilleries though it is
ertaln that theso latter did not look with a
nvornblo eye on tho intruders In
heir own reserves Tho inquiries of
ho two Americans were not altogether satls
actory but they aro determined luivorthe
ess to send In a lot of tho Kentucky stuff
mil mako of Canada a sacrifice market They
rould sooner sell it cheap iu Canada than in
ho United States It will be remembered
bat an attempt was made some time ago to
xjort the bonded whisky of tho United
States into Canada and then immediately re
jxport It to tho United States thereby got
Jng round the revenuo laws Tho action of
ho Canadiun Government however pre
sented the scheme from being realized

noticeable that tho vigorous warfare inaugur
ated against moousbinars several years ago
has suppressed much of tho illegal traffic and
tome of tho most notorious distillers have
given up tho business forever Five or six
venrs ago there were at every term of the
