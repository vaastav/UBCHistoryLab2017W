The Spectator last week had a report of th
Council proceedings at the session on the nlgb
of the 3rd Instant. The consideration of th
ordinances for the government of an Electri
Street Railway was then further conslderei
and postponed to an adjourned meeting, th
sth Instant, at which were present Messrs
Berkeley, President, Armentrout, Bell, Butti
Crimmens, Crowle. McQualde, and Tams—_
Absent, Messrs. Bargamln, Craig, Summ-rsoi
and Weller— 4. The session was for genera
purposes, and Mr. McQuaide, of the Stree
Committee, which has ln charge the orders c
the Council respecting the forfeited franchls.
granted a telephone company, made a verba
report as a sequel to the pioceedlngs of thi
previous session to this effect—Mr. McClure re
presenting the Bell Telephone company whlct
has the present exclusive right of the Ameri
can Bell Telephone, and i_r. Rosenberger wh(
represents the company who own the poles
and wires, had agreed upon terms whereby the
Bell company could re-establish the exchange,
and the agreement had gone forward to head
quarters for ratification.
Mr. Tarns called up the question of the pro
posed franchise for a street railway. A num
ber of citizens were presont «nd occupied seat-
In tbe Council Chamber. George S. Ligbtner,
Esq., Attorney for the signers to the petition
opposing the franchlso. being present, was In
vited to state tho views of those be represent
ed. This he did ln a olear, logical, and forcible
address, from the stand-point be occupied, cit
ing Light Street, Baltimore, the center of tbe
heavy trade of th»t city as A ugusta street Is ol
I Staunton, and upon Light street, the street
railway franchise had always been refused.
Ho presented the views of the signers to the re
monstrance. They were not antagonists, as
Ken slated, to tho progress and advance
of the olty ln Its trade and growth and
rlty—on ihe contrary, they were the fast
i«f all proper development, and he pro
to name other streets where the railway
could be placed without harm to the commence
It would damage if laid dowu ou Augusta St.,
between the Chesapeake and Ohio Depot and
Frederick street. Many other than the name*
signed to the paper could have been obtained,
but ln this mutter the consideration was con
fined to the ob,eo.ions as stated. He had ex
pected to see heie, Mr. J A Fauver, Mr. B F
Eakie, Mr. Frank Alexander, and others, who
had moved ln this matter, aud asked for a fur
ther postponement of the question till all the
lights could be thrown upon It.
Mr. Tarns replied to the views presented by
Mr. Lightner. He knew tbe signers were all
Interested as property-holders and business
men and citizens, and sincere ln their convic
tions, but at the same time he was as well sat
isfied that they were mistaken ln their can
elusions. The ordinances prepared, as well as
those previously adopted, had been long and
thoroughly considered. When It was proposed
to confer the franchise upon the Staunton Im
provement company, thete were no objections
to it, and he could not see why there should be
now, when It is proposed to extend It upon the
some streetß to the company now willing to
accept It under more favorable guaranties to
the city and its citizens. He had mad* tbe
whole matter of narrow streets (the point in
the objection now presented) a careful study
ulded by personal examination ln New York,
Philadelphia and Baltimore. Chesnut, the
great business street of Philadelphia, is only
twenty-six feet w.de between the cuib-stones,
and upon It was a street railway and a com
merce conducted by wagons, drays, carriages,
etc., In a constantly going and coming stream,
Lbe street cars moing at the same time, and
yet there was perfect regulation and not a seri
ous jar at any time. He said the trouble was
that wagons bearing trade for Staunton were
allowed to stand on Augusta street indefinite
ly,—that It was, lv fact, a wagon yard—and tbi«
■ bould not be so. There was no necessity for
such privileges, and they should be discon
tinued. He knew of no new facts to be consld
ered, and he c. c-sired to see the question ended;
for If it be the purpose of tbe Council to grant
the franchise, it should he doao now iv justice
to the parties who will accept it, as well as to
the public.
Mr. Bell concurred ln the views presented by
Mr. Tarns and said that when he r«ad tbe
names of the signers to the remonstrance he
was inclined to reconsiderhisown conclusions*
for those gentlemen were of our best citizens,
largely engaged ln ttade aud should be heard
ln every particular. Whilst pondering the
matter, he had gone upon Augusta street that
afternoon and saw a large number of wagons
there and trade briskly going on, and yd he
•aw no confusion, and at no time did he see
tuat there would ba the least difficulty for
street cars to pass during the thioog of busi
ness.
Mr. Butts was ofthe same opinion, and was
an advocate lor a street-railway. Us resided
out on Augusta street. Whilst others wanted
it to go out. he wanted It to come ln, and favor
ed It for Ihe growth aud prosperity of the city,
end could not see that it would be detrimental
to trade. Referring to the siguer_.,he said they
were of course entitled to lull constdeiatlon.yel
they were few, in number.
Mr- Ligbtner replied to the three members o:
the council who had spoken, and, If po3_lble,ln
a more vigorous speech than ho made at first.
He referred again to Light-Street in Baltimore
which Mr. Tarns had tailed to consider when
he stated tbe case as It existed ln Baltimore.
The question was then called for and the votf
demanded. Tne ordinance governing the fran
chise was again read, and Ihe roll called, when
all the members present, eight in number, vot
ed aye, and the same was declared passed.
Afier the disposition of same other business
the Council adjourned.

ginians have found a home in Baltimore that
the Monumental City has come to be consid

any rate it has so strong a flavor of our good

love for it. This f.eliug is doubtless strength
ened by tbe popularity in this State ofthe Bal
timore Sun, which is a household word ln every
part of tbo Commonweal:h and a familiar
friend at thou, ands of our firesides. Ihough
published ln Baltimore, It seems almost like a
Virginia institution, and its readers here take
as much pride In it as if It were a local publi
cation. There are few newspapers which have
go thoroughly deßervad their sucoes-. It Is
clean, honest and brave, scrupulously avoids
coarse and vulgar sensationalism, and while It
does not hesitate to throw Its light upon the
public acts of public men, It never suffers lis
columns to be made the vehicle of attack upon
private reputation. It gives Virginia news
special prominence, and has carelul corres
pondents lo all parts of this State. When the
Sun says anything people may be sure that
they can rely on It.

■"Representative O'Ferrall called at the

the Postmaster General on the subject ef
the postmaster at the University of Virgin

democrat, but his retention is recommend
ed by many republicans who are served
with mail at that office Mr. Wanamaker
told Mr. O'Ferrall that no democratic post
master should hold offloe under this admin
istration even if local republicans desired it.
Mr. Bibb will therefore "go."
That is Wannamaker's mode of civil-ser
vice reform, yet the Republican party and
its President are committed in the most
positive manner by their professions to civ
il-service reform. O, ye hypocrites, "a
whip of scorpions should be put into every

It should have read "married," bat the

observation. Thousands of husbands are
constantly worried almost to despair by the
ill-health that afflicts their wives, and often
robs life of its comfort and happiness.
There is but one safe and sure way to
change all this for tbe better. Tbe ladies
should use Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescrip
