\\ EPNESDAY EVENIKG, DEC. 6,1871.
FORTY-SECOND CON&RESS-211 Session i
<
Titksday, December stit, I s 7l. I '
sevvti:
Mr. Kellogg 'introduced bill to_ author- j
ize mail steamship service fn the Gulf of
Mexico between the port of New I h ieaus (
and certain ports of the republic of Mexico. ;
Mr. lllair moved to take up the resolu
tion offered by him yesterday, calling on (
the President for his authority to declare |
martial law ia curtain counties of South (
Carolina. Mr. Blair said the resolution ;
contemplates that the President shall lay j
before the Senate the manner in which ho \
has executed the extraordinary powers ,
conferred upon him by Congress. lie had
heard that of the many citizens of South
< 'arolina arrested, nine-tenths of them had
been arrested charged with crimes commit
ted before the act of April 20, 1871. The
facts alleged in connection with these of
fences he recognized as having been brought
to the attention of the Ku-Klux committee
anterior to the passage of the Ku-Klux act.
Mr. Edinund-i suggested that it was not
proper to discuss the merits of the resolu
tion on a motion to take, up, nod the Vice
President So decided.
Mr. Morton said niucli of thu information
called for was given in the message of the
President, and he also eonsiderered that it
was best to delay action until the report of
the committee in the late insurrectionary
States had been suomttted.
Mr. Blair said the information called for
was not given in the President's message.
The President says he had information to
justify him in his action, but does not
state from Whom he received it. He cer
tainly did not get it from the committee,
for the committee had authorized no one to
give him any information, and as a member
of the committee, he (Mr. JJ.) was of the
opinion that no facts had been brought be
fore the committee, which would justify
his action.
Mr. Conkling was opposed to taking up
the resolution for the reasons staled by
Mr. Morton, and farther because the reso
lution was not in the nature of good faith.
It was full of assertion and intimations.
Tlie motion to take up was then put and
lost—ayes, 11; nay., 43.
Mr. Keilogg introduced bill to reorganize
the district courts of tho United Slates in
the State of Louisiana.
IIOtSE Or KEI'KKSEYi'A'm ES.
Mr. Wells introduced a bill to make ap
propriation for a site in St. Louis for a cus
tom-house and postoffice building. Referred
to Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds.
Mr. lliil introduced a bill authorizing the
Postmaster General to issue one ceut "cor
respondent" and "post" cards. Referred
to the Commiitee on Postoffiees.
On motion of Mr. Dawes, the House
went into the Committee of the Whole on
' the President's .Message, with Mr. Wheeler
in the chair.
Mr. Dawes ofi'erred a resolution to refer
the several parts of the President's Message
to the appropriate committees.
Mr. Wood objected to the proposed re
ferreoo. of certain matters to the select
committee on the insurrectionary States.
There was no such a standing committee
in this House. He denied that there were
any such things in this country as insur
rectionary Stales. A committee was ap
pointed at last session to investigate certain
matters in the South, and us functions
ceased when that duly had been per
formed. It was improper to refer any
thing to tho commiitee, as it would con
tinue it, and that was not intended.
Mr. Dawes said he could not enter upon
o. discussion of a question of fact with Mr.
Wood, and that gentleman must know that
there is such a committee of the House as
that on insurrectionary States.
Mr. Wood denied that the committee WW)
intended to be continued in existence be
yond the pi'c.,ent session of Congress.
Last Congress we had a committee called
the Committee on Reconstruction, and the
gentleman's Colleague from Massachusetts,
(Mr. Butler.) made numerous efforts to
have it continued. The Committee on In
surrectionary States will cease after it shall
have reported to the House. A reference
to it was a recognition of the
committee, and the effect of the reference
would be to continue it. He was opposed
to making committees in this manner.
Mr. Dawes said that if a simple reference
would continue a committee, then this com
mittee would already be continued, because
matters had been referred to it yesterday.
The committee lias not reported yet, and
until it does report, certainly all matters
pertinent may be referred to il. The com
mittee was made to inquire into disorders
in the South, and no one could .->ay whether
its continuance would be necessary until
after the report had been submitted.
Mr. Wood said that instead of leading
to order, the committee wa, one which was
calculated to promote disorder. He (Mr.
W.) would go as far as any gentleman in
the House, or as far as the administration,
to promote peace and order in the South ;
ljut tins was not the way to do it, and he
protested against continuing committees
as agencies to promote disorder in the
South.
Mr. Dawes hailed with jo v the announce
ment of Mr. Wood that the latter would
unite with the Republicans and tfic admin
istration for peace and order at the South,
and if that was done he thought peace and
order would soon be at hand.
Mr. Maynard said the committee refer
red to was started for a special purpose,
and be thought the report would demon
strate not only the necessity of its original
organization, but the necessity of continu
ing it. Be did not want it to be thought
that this proposition of reference was a
mere side-winder to continue the commit,
tee.
After further discussion, the subject was
referred to the Committee on Appropria
tions by a vote of lv.l lo 88,
—The country, ju-,1 now, has a very se
vere attack of the Blairs. Between' the
venerable Montgomery and the youthful
Frank, the blaring is terrific. ]n fact, our
"ears are stunned with lhe thundering
blare." The ancient fo_-il of Maryland has
unbosomed himself to a newspaper re
porter. Governor Gratz Brown, the A. F.
thinks, would make a splendid candidate
for the hydra-winged Democracy. The
Bo'eniiau that stanled tne elder Blair from
his brown study ought to b-.- sent to Botany
Bay. Frank at one end of the line, de
iiu.niciog ("resident Grant for nepotism,
and Montgomery at the other end, throw
ing up in* lile and cheering for Missouri's
Governor, ju-t as though tne entire family•
were not blood relation*. (. .u.-s.n Grata
will, of cour.-e, in the estimation of Cousin
Frank, make a splendid candidate,' There
is no doubt on this question whatever.
The Biairs are v uni! on Brown-Stout and
Stout-lJiown is a unit on the Blairs. How
interesting ilu.s triumvirate would he at the
head of National attaint. If the hope of
thecouatry i- m the "Passive Policy,"
and the success of that policy i- dependent
on the trio owned, we may us well throw
up the sponge and quit.

The Ku-Kilix Trial, ia South Carolina.
Charleston, Dec. 4.—ln the Ku-Klux
trials at. Columbia to-day, Mr. Stanbcrry,
for the defence, moved to quash the indict
ment against Crosby and others, upon
these, among other grounds: That the
names of the persons injured are not men
tioned in the indictment; that the grand
jury had decided as to the law, instead of
the facts ; that the indictment was defective
in stating the deprivation to vote as taking
place at a future day, as the United States
constitution and law does not secure to
any citizens the right to vote ; and that the
Slate, and not the Federal courts, must re
dress such personal grievances as those
complained of. Mr. Stanberry argued for
two hours in support of his objections.
Mr. Corbin, for the government, asked
for time, and replies to-morrow.
Charleston, Dec. 3.—ln the Ku-Klux
trials to-day, at Columbia, Messrs. Cham
berlain and Corbin, for the government,
made elaborate replies to Mr. Stanberry's
argumeot of yesterday, the main point of
both replies being that the indictment was
drawn in the exact words of tho Congres
sional statute, and was, therefore, potent.
Hun. Keverdy Johnson will begin tlie
closing argument for the defence on the
motion to quash the indictment, to-morrow

VALUABLE SULPHUR SPRINGS
PROPERTY
IN THE COirNTY OF BOTETOURT, VA.
Pursuant to a decree of the District Oonrtof
the United Slates for the Eastern District of Vir
ginia, made on the 6th day of October 1871, in
the matter of John F. Shields, bankrupt, I shall,
as assignee of said bankrupt, proceed to sell at
public auction, to the highest bidder, on
TUESDAY, 12th DAY OF DECEMBER, 1671,
on the premises, the following valuable real
estate, to wit:
A TRACT OF LAND,
lying in ihe county of Botetourt, Virginia,
CONTAINING 473 ACRES,
on which Is sitnated the celebrated watering
place, known as
DAGGER'S OR DIBBRELLS SPRING.
This apring is beautifully situated at the fool of
Garden mountain, in the connty of Botetourt,
Virginia, nine miles from Clifton Forge, on the
Chesapeake and Ohio railroad, and directly on
the proposed line ot said road down the James
river, and three miles from James river. The
Improvements are neat, appropriate, and com
fortable, are in good repair, and sufficient to ac
commodate 200 persons, consisting of a
LARGE HOTEL,
and a row of collages
CONTAINING THIRTY-SIX ROOMS.
The mineral properties of the water are diu
retic, aperient, and general alternative. This
spring has been visited for the last fifty years by
persons afflicted with dyspepsia, diarrhoea, nu
ratgtn, diseases of the bladder and kidneys, and
female diseases, who have experienced great re
lief from the use of the water, and in many in
stances have been entirely cured. Thia Spring
is still a place of considerable resort, having had
200 visitors the present summer (1871); aud were
it now in the hands of an enterprising proprie
tor, would be one of the most valuable pieces of
property in Virginia, and is one of the best in
vestments capitalists can make. Dr. Moorman,
