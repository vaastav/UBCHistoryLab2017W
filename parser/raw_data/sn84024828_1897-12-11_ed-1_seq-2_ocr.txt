It is reported that 100,000 people
will go into Alaska next spring and
summer.
Smallpox is epidemic in San
Marcial, New Mexico, but so far
only one death is reported.
The Nogales Oasis is now the
best weekly paper published in
Arizona and Editor Bird Bhould
feel supremely happy.
Two thousand prospectors have
left Dawson for Fort Yukon and
other places on the Yukon river
where the food supply is sufficient
to carry them through the long winter.
Yavapai county had two mur
ders this week. "One of the mur
derers, at least, should have been
executed first and had his trial af
terward. The murder was a most
cold-blooded one.
Judge Sloan has decided that the
Wolfley claim against the territory
for 7,500$ is a valid one. Tho
Board of Control audited the claim
for 3,500$ and tho Prescott Courier
cried fraud, boodle, etc. Now that
over 9,000$ will have to bo paid
by order of court the Courier says
never a word.
Keports continue to como from
the Yaqui country and they are
not of a nature to cause the whole
country to rise up as one man and
flock there. Gold is found along
the river and the ravines debouch
ing into it, but not of sufficient
richness to be worked profitably.
Arizona is today tho best country
on the globe for miner and prospector.
Jerome Booth is now editor of
the Needles Eve. Mr. Booth is a
Needles boy and we hope the peo
ple will give him a liberal patron
age and feel ass ired that his work
on tho Eye will be for Needles' good.
Arizona loan commissioners have
floated the new five per cent bonds
to the amount of 258,000$. This
completes the funding of Arizona's
indebtedness and will save the tax
payers many thousands of dollars
yearly.
In Fall River, Massachusettes,
the cotton manufacturers' associa
tion has decided to make a ten per
cent cut in employes wages, to take
effect January first. It effects 28,
000 employes with a weekly pay
roll of 180,000?.
The president has appointed j
Blanche tv. liruce to be register ot
the treasury. Dear reader, Blanche
is not a lovely female as you may
suppose, but a male negro from
Mississippi, who during reconstruc
tion days was a member of Con
gress from that state.
Tho miners of California are pre
paring a unique invitation to Pres
ident McKinley to attend the min
ers golden jubilee next year. The
invitation will be on a polished piece
of quartz plentifully sprinkled with
gold. It will be one of the most
beautiful quartz specimens to be
found in the state.
Mohave county ships yearly to
the Colorado smelters 1,000,000$ in
silver and gold besides hundreds of
tons of rich lead and copper. This
great product goes to swell Colo
rado's output of mineral Undoubt
edly the other counties of Arizona
ship to the smelters enough to
make the total over 2,000,000$.
President McKinley submitted
Irs annual message to Congress
Monday. It deals largely with Cu
ban, Hawaiian, and monetary af
fairs. The president urges the im
mediate annexation of Hawaii and
contra that Cuba be turned over to
the tender mercies of Spain. We
are at a loss to know hov the pres
ident arrived at the conclusion he
has regarding the two applicants
for onr protection. Hawaii is 1000
miles off our westernmost coast
while Cuba is almost a stone's
throw from the coast of Florida.
Annexation is not asked for Cubaj
simply that it be given belligerous
rights. Regarding monetary affairs
the president assumes that all our
obligations are payable in gold
This is the same policy that Grover
Cleveland carried out. It is Gage's
policy and it will continue to be
the policy of every president domi
nated by eastern influences. He
refers to the incomplete work of the
international monetary commission
and hopes that in the end it will
succeed in establishing a double
standard. France received hearty
thanks for assistance rendered our
commissioners and for the apparent
willingness to agree to open the
mints to the free and unlimited
coinage of silver. The message con
tains 13,00(1 words, but as a state
document cannot be said to be
above the ordinary.

A Santa Rosa, Calif., man writes
from Dawson City that he is pay
ing 300? per month for board in a
private family. That is not exces
sive. Twenty years ago it cost
miners in Mohave county 100? per
month for grub and they had to do
their own cooking, washing and
ironing, besides furnishing their
own rooms and bedding.
Congressman Hartmn, of Mon
tana, takes issue with Senator Car
ter, of the same state, who pro
possed that legislation doing away
with all paper money below the
denomination of 10$, in order to in
crease tho use of silver, be adopted
at this session of Congress, and
gives notices that the silver repun
licans will not accept that or any
other compromise of the silver
question. Mr. Hartman also ex
presses his opinion of Senator
Chandler and other republicans,
who, ho says, ''still proposes to
chase the will-of-the-wisp of inter
national bimetallism, in spite of
the knock-out blow dealt to it by
Lord Salisbury in his reply to the
proposals of Senator Wolcott's com-
