-for subsidies to build and navigate ocean
steamers. But what do the Prohibition
ists want with more ships ? Their doc
trine is to cut off trade with foreign
oouutries, and not buy anything from
them that can be made at twice or thrice
the cost at home. Their underlying
principle is non-intercourse with other
countries as far as possible. What use
have these people for ocean ships f Take
the English, French or German price ol
goods and add the protective tariff there-
to, and you have the price ot domestic
'protected'- goods. It is absurd to talk
of shipping such goods to foreign mar
kets. But Roach wants to be subsidiz
ed. He is alter plunder." Yes, and

THE OUBSE OF OPTIOBT DEALBJQ--
It we were asked what was the greatest
curse tbat visited Lafayette county da
ring the year 1881, now so rapidly draw
ing to a close, we should not answer
draught or chinch bugs, but option
dealing. It is strong language, proba
bly, to say that ibis mania for it has
amounted to tbat here is a curse, but
the words are none too forcible.
A few months ago the fact becoming
apparent in this section ot the country
that drought would cut our corn crop
short, a few gentlemen took pains to as
certain whether or not a similar condi
tion was general, and finding it So they
invested largely In futures, and made a
good deal of money in one or two in
stances fortunes. . This success was
phenomenal, as it is not olten the city
dealers let their country cousins who are
their especial pet "lambs," make much;
but in this case there was such a deci
ded reason lor an upward tendency that
the market could not by any possibility be
depressed. The good luck of the few
gentlemen here alluded to, at the begin
ning of the advance In corn, was a mis
fortune to their fellow citizens it seem
ed so easy to make money that way; no
labor, no care, no long-waiting ; doiens
of them began to invest in options on
corn, wheat, lard, pork, anything. The
consequence was inevitable; their ''luck"
was not so good a the pioneers in spec
ulation ; many of them lost money, some
of them heavily, and a few to tbe ruin
of their credit. Tbe latter were like the
gentleman who hearing option dealing
discussed remarked tbat the secret ot the
thing was to know when to quit. He
said that he had been a large operator,
but that be had appreciated when it
was time to leave off. Being asked
what had been the time to stop in his
ease, he replied that he "backed at it"
vigorously until Us day that he only
had money enough to pay for moving his
wife's trunk to his father-in-law's house.
Seriously, tor the subject is a serious
one, we know of nothing so demoralis
ing to a community as the development
in it of a habit ot gambling. A gentle
man of much intelligence and knowl
edge ot the world assured as a tew days
ago.ibat we would be astonished to know
how rainy men in his neighborhood
were dealing in options small farmers,
who could ill afford to run risks with
their slender means ; and young meni
borrowing money on their expectations,
to hazard it on a game more uuoertain
than the turning of a oard at faro or
tbe chance of a color at rouge t noir,
Not a few of these men re members
ot tbe church of Christ, and would be
horrified at tho idea of being caught in
a gambling hell, yet they engago in a
business more demoralizing than that of
the common gambler, because more in
sidnons. It will hardly be oontended that option
dealing is anything better than gamb
ling. It has been so held by court alter
court. It contains the practical and
moral elements of gambling a some
thing tor nothing, and a parebase in
which goods are never to be delivered,
but where chance and events over
which the investor has no control deter
mine as to whether he shall gain or lose.
Conceded that it Is gambling none will
deny that it is injudicious, immoral and
hurtful. It has always buen held to be
a vice,and legislation against it is recor
ded as far back as tbe Roman republic
and empire. As little charity as the world
is wont to extend to the rich this, sin is
not so lraughl with evil in them as in
the poor. A rieh man may : indulge
himself in the risk of some of his sur
plus in order to gratify his appetite for a
mental stimulus. If he loses it is a
small matter to him; he has plenty left,
and is not seriously incommoded; but
what right has a poor man to risk the
bread and shelter of his wife and babes
upon a game ol chance ? None. How
can a business man who deals in options
oxpect to have anv credit? No banker
can safely loan him money. If he de
murs to this as unjust he has only to ask
himself if he would entrust his cash to a
clerk who gambled.
The evil of option dealing cannot be
exaggerated. It impairs confidence,
destroys credit, unfits mea for legiti
mate business, and, persisted in, brings
ruin and disgrace; tor the sharks ot the
street are always watching and sooner
or later gobble up the lam' s who are
out of their element when tbey venture
to cope with them. It is a violation ot
tbe edict ot God, who has declared that,
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
bread." It demoralizes a community in
which it becomes common, and unless
desisted from will sooner or later bring
disaster, disgrace and distress. Belter
the slower but more trustworthy and
honorable paths of diligence and indus
try, which It they do not so soon enrich
give us peace of mind, standing wi'h
our neighbors and self-respect.
THE RIVER 00SVEKTI0N.
To Ma feopt of Zafayttto County.'
Tbe Missouri Sirer Improvement Convention
held at St. Joseph, November SStb and Mtb,
which I attanded aa a delegate from this Boun
ty, was, in my opinion, aeaond in importance
to no meeting for a commercial purpose tbat
has ever been held in this stale; ana u seems
proper to call your attention parliealarly to
the matter. Aa the uroeeedinm of the vnvn-
tion were publiabed in the papers and will be
pat in pamphlet form, I will not attempt to aire
tbem here. Missouri. Kansas. Nebraska, loara
and Dakota, were represented. Senator Ingalls
or Kansas, made a most tavorable impression
bv ais el qaent and sensible address, and was
cnoteo permanent onairman. lie and bis peo
ple axe cviaemiy iu earnest in their uesire to
forget past differences and see the states of the
treat valley united in endeavors aa thev are in
interests. Dr. Root, of Kansas, who has rep
resented our Dation a) rovi, made ihe happy
remark that "the Mias m. I river once separated
Missouri and Kansas, but now it unites them."
The convention, in the name ot the people
of the Missouri Valley, demanded an appro
priation of ten millions of dollars lo improve
the river from its mouth, to Sioux City, Iowa,
as competent engineers estimate that with tbia
sum a channel of twelve feet in low water can
be secur d and o'erflnws in bign water pre
vented. 'Property in tbe river bottoms will
thua become secure from destruction by tbe
river; tlelds and towns there instead of reeking
with deadly malaria will rival in improie
menta. productiveness and salubrity the rich
and beautiful oountry lying on the lower Rhine.
We provided for two committees to go to
Washington lo back up the senators and rep
resentatives in tbia demand, and recommended
that all localities Interested send such p'TSOos
as would be useful to aid them In ibis object.
I tried to get the name or Col. MV V. L. He.
Cleliand ol our county on one of tbe commit
tees, but the other localities were so much
more numerously represented than our county
that it was Impossible.
Tbe benefits of the revival of the river trade
will not accrue solely to the river towns. Every
town in, aud every part of, our county will he
benefited; for low freights from river towna
will oompel low freights from every
railroad town in our county. It ia expected
tbat numerous narrow-gauge railroads owned
at home, will run out Irom the river towns to
the interior and bring in tbe produce that ia
to be ahipped by river.
Whilst leelmg it a duty to give an aenount
of my stewardship (Messrs. Sbankland and
Lesueur the other two delegates from this coun
ty b attended be ng unable to remain until
the close of the convention.) I am constrained
to urce you in the strongest terms to arouee
yourselves at once and do everything possible
or necessary in aid of this great work. Very
respectlully, your obedient servant.

To the Senate and House of Representatives of
the DnlUMl States: ....
Washihotok, D. C, December 6. An ap
palling calauiitv lias betalion tlie American peo
ple since their 'chosen representatives last met
In the halls where yoa are now assembled We
might else recall with unalloyed content the
prosperity wliu whioh throughout the year the
nation has been blessed. Its Harvests have b-en
plenteous, its varied industries have thrived,
the b altb of its people baa been preserved, it
bas maintained with foreign governments the
undisturbed relations of amity aud peace.. For
these manifestations or Mis favor we owe to
Him, wo bold our destiny in his bands, the
tribute of our graterul devotions; to thai mys
terious exercm ol will which has laken Irom
us tbe loved and illustrious eitizeu who was but
lately tbe bead of the nation we bow In sorrow
and submiasion. The memory ot his exalted
character, bis noble achievements and ol his
patriotic life, will be trea,ured forever, for a
aacrad possession of tbe whole people. Tbe an
nouncement ol his death drew Irom foreign
governments and people tributes of sympathy
and aorrow, which history will record as signal
tokens of the kinship of nations and the feder
ation of mankind.
BBL4.TI0KS WITH BSQLAMD.
The feeling or good will between onr own gov
ernment and tbat ol Great Britain was never
mere marked than at preaeat.
RELATIONS WIT SI FRANCE.
The presence at tbe Yorktown celebration of
representatives oi isiaye,iB auu ma
compatriot, who were our allies in tbe revolu
tion, has served to strengthen tbe spirit of good
will whioh haa always existed between the two
nations.
BXLATIOXS WITH OKBKAinT AND SPAIN.
No new Question respecting the status or our
naluralizau citizens iu Germany have arisen
during the year, and causes of 'complaint, es
pecially in Alsace and Lorraine have practically
ceased, through tbe liberal action of the imperi
al government in accepting our often expressed
views on the subject. Tbe application of the
treaty ol 1868 to tbe lately acquired Rhenish
provinces bas received vary earnest attention. A
definite and lasting agreement on this point is
coi llitently expected. Tbe participation of tbe
Jesc.endanls ot Baron Von Steuben in the York
ann fMilTitlea. and their sabseanent reception
by their American kinsmen, evinced the tie of
goon will wnicn unite tuo uuii iicvpu
our own.
BILATIOKS WITH HUSSIA AND ITALY.
The senate resolutions ot condolence on the ae
sa.sination ol the Czar Alexander II were ap
propriately communicated to the Russian gov
ernment which, in lurn, has expressed Its sym
pathy in our late national bereavement.
The consular agroement.wlth Italy has been
sanctioned and proclaimed, which puts at rest
conflicts oi' jurisdiction in the case of crimes on
shipboard. Several important ioternaUonal
conferences have been held in Italy during tbe
year.
Tbe insecurity of life and property in. many
parts of lurkey bas given rise lo a correspond
ence with the porta, looking particularly to Ibe
batter protection of American missionaries in
tbe empire. Tbe condemned murderer ot the
eminent misslonarv. Dr. Justin W. Persons,
has not jet been executed, although this govern
ment bas repeatedly demanded it.
BOUMANIA, SXEVIA AND MBX1CO.
The treaties of commerce aad navigation, and
for the regulation ol consular privileges, have
been concluded with Roumanla and Servia siuce
their admtssloa into the family of European
states. As is natural with 'configuous suites,
bavlna- like inatitutiona and like alms of ad
vancement aud development, tbe friendship of
tbe united seates anil Jaexico nas oeeu con
stantly maintained.
The government baa lost no occasion of en
couraging Ihe Mexican, government to a benefi
cial realisation of tbe mutual advantages which
will result from more intmata commercial in
tercourse, and from Ihe opening of tbe rich in
terior of Mexico to railway enterprise. I deem
it important tbat means be provided to restrain
tbe lawlessness nnlortunately so cosumon on the
frontier, and to suppress the lorays of tbe reser
yatlonlndiaos on eiiber side of IheBto Grande.
TBK CBNTBAL AHBBIOAN STATES.
The neighboring states of Central America
nave preserved internal peace, ana tneir out
ward relatione toward us have been those ol in
mate friendship.
THE CANAL TROUBLES.
The questions growing out of the proposed
inter-ooeanio-water way acroaa me ismmua 01
Panama are of grave national importance. Tbia
government baa not been unimnuful of Ibe
solemn obi mat ions iuiuused uuon it bv its com
pact of 1816, with Joiouibia, the Independent
anu sovereign miairess ol we territory croaseu
by the canal, and has somrht to render them
effective by fresh engagements with (heC'olom-
oiao repuuuo, loosing to tne practical execu
tion of the negotiations lo this end. Alter tbey
bud reached what appsarcd to be a mutually
satislactory solution here, they were met iu
Colombia by a disavowal of the powers, which
its envoy bad assumed, and by a proposal lor
renewed nefiruliaiiuns on a modified- basis.
Meanwhile this government had learned tbat
voioiuuia naa proposea to tne KUiopean powers
to join inn guarantee or the neutrality or the

his duty lo place before tbe Jbluropean powers
tbe reasons whicb make the prior guarantee of
tbe United States indispensable, lor which tbe
interjection of any lore i it u guarantee might be
regardsd as a superfluous and unlrlendly aot.
rorseeing the probable reliance of the British
government on tbe provisions of tbe Claytou
and Bulwer treaty of 18M. as affording room for
a shre in the guarantee which , tbe United
States covenanted with Colombia four years be
fore, I have not hesitated to supplement the
action ol my predecessor by proposing to ber
majesty's government Ihe modification of that
ioetrument, and the abrogation of such clauses
thereof aa do not comport with tbe obligations
of the United Slates toward Colombia, or with
toe vitul needs ol the two friendly parties to tbe
vuuifiaut.
THB SOUTH AMERICAN WAB. "
This government sees with great concern tbe
eontinuance of the hostile relations between
Chili, Bolivia and Peru. An early Deuce be
tween these republics is much lo be desired, not
only that tbey may be spared further misery and
uioousneo, nut oecause their continued autag
oniem tnrealeus oonsequences which are, in my
Judgment, dangerous to tbe iuterestsoi a repub
lican government, and calculated to destroy the
swat elements of our tree and peaceful civiliza
tion. As in the present excited condition of popular
feeling in theee.countrtes, .there has been pre
vious misapprehensions of tbe position of tbe
United States, aud as separate diplomatic inter
course with aaob tbiough iudenendent ministers
is sometimes subject, owing lo the want or
prompt reciprocal communication, to bring on
misunderstanding, 1 bare deemed it judicious at
me present time to sena a apeoiai envoy, ac
cretUta l lo all and each of them, and furnished
with general instructions which will, I trust, en
able ihem lo bring these powers into friendly
relatione.
CHINA AND JAPAN.
I am eMad to inform toii that the traatr
lately negotiated with China bas been duly rat
ified on both sides, and the exchange made at
Pekin, and legislation is necessary to carry the
provisions into effect. The prompt and frieadly
apirit with which the Chinese government, at
the request of tbe United States, conceded tb
modification of existing treaties should secure
coruiai regaru lor tne interests and susceptibil
ities of th'. government in the enaotmeutol any
laws relating to Chinese immigration. Those
clauses of the treaty which lorbid the partici
pation of vessel of Ibe United States in the
opium trade, will doubtless receive your ap
proval. The intimacy between our country and Japan,
the most advanoed of tbe eastern nations, con
tinues to be cordial. I am advised that the em
peror contemplates the establishment of a con
stitutional aovernmeiit. and that he haa air-l
summoned a parliamentary congress lor the
purvuse oi enecung a cuange. bucn a remark
able step toward complete assimilation with the
western system can not fail to bring Japan into
viuevt nuu uiurv ucueuoiai r lationsnip With
ourselves as tbe chiel Pacific power. -
Relations of unimpaired amity bave been
maintained throughout the year with Ihe res
pective governments of Austria," Hungary, Bel
gium, Denmark, Hay li, Paraguay and Uruguay,
Portugal and Sweden aud Norway. This may
also be said of Greece aud Equador. Although
our relations with those stales bave for some
years been severed by the withdrawal ol ap
propriations lor diplomatic representatives at
Athens and Quito, it seems expedient to rea:ore
the missions, even oa a reduced scale, and 1
decidedly recommend suoh a courae with re
spect to Equador. wbich is likely witl in the
near future to play an important part aiuoag

requirements ol the sinking fund for tbe year
amounted to $90 788 964 02. which sum includes
s balance ol $49,817.128 78 not provided for.
During the previous fiscal year the sum of $71 -18u.201.05,
was applied to this fund which left
a deficit ot $16,205,873.17. Tne inorense of the
revenue for 1881 tver ihose of the previous year
was $29,852,901.10. Ii is esiimaied that the re.
celpts during the present fiscal year will reach
$400,000,000, and Hie expenditures $270,000 000,
leaving a surplus of 13e,0u0,000 applicable to
tbe sinaing lund and the redemption ot the pub
lic debt. I approve the recommendation of Ibe
secretary of tbe treasury tbat provision be made
for the early retirement of silver certificates,
and that the act requiring their issue be rope-tied.
Tbey were issued in pursuance of the poli
cy of the government to maintain sllv.r at near
tbe Hold standard; and were accordingly made
receivable lor all customs, taxes, aud public
duos. About $66,000,000 of them are now out
standing, and tbey are found an un necessary ad
dition to the paper currency a sufficient amount
of which may be readily
snrrLiBD bt thb national banks.
In accordance with the aot of February 98. 1878,
ihe treasury department has monthly caused at
least $2,000,000 in value of silver bullion lo be
eninail inn standard silver dollars. One hun
dred and two n illion of these dollars hare been
already coined, while only about SM.ooo.oej are
iu circulation.
For reasons which be specifies, I concur in
the secretary's recommendation, that the pro
vieioi for coinage of a fixed amount each month
be repealed, and that heiaifter, only ao muoh be
coined as aball be necessary to supply tbe de
mand. Tbe secretary advises that the issue of
gold certificates should not foi tbe present be
resumed, and suggests that the national banks
may properly be lorba'den by law to retire their
eurreaoy, except upon reasonable notice ol their
Intention so lo do. Such legislation would seem
lo be justified by tbe recent action of certain
banks on the occasion referred lo in the secreta
ry's report
Wf the $15,000,000 or fractional currency still
outstanding; only about $80,000 bas been re
deemed tbe past year. The suggestion tbat this
amount may properly be dropped from state
ments of tbe publio debt seams worthy of ap
proval ; so also does the suggestion of tbe sec
retary as to tho advisability ol relieving the
calendar or the United States court in the south
ern district of Mew York by the transfer to an
other tribunal of the numerous suits there Bead
ing against collectors.
. The revenue from customs for the past fiscal
year was $198,189,676 02, an Increase of $11,
637.611 12 over tbat ot the preceding year
$168,098,862 39 of Ibis amount being collected at
the port ol New York leaving $30,251,113 61 as
the amount oolleotea at all the otber ports of
the country. Or this sum $17,977,131 68 was
collected on eugar and molasses, $37,285,021 78
on wool and Iu manufactures, $21,162,581 34 on
iron and steel and manufactures thereof, $19.
088,685 81 on manufactures of silk. $10,825. 115 21
on manufscturaa of cotton, and $8,469,648 01 oa
wines and spirits, making tbe total revenue
Irom these sources, -$138,058,720 08. The ex
penses ef collection for the paatyear are $8,119,.
3tt 20, an increase over the preceding year of
$387,110 04. Notwithstanding tho increase in
revenue Irom customs over tbe proceeding year
tbe gross value of tbe imports, including Iree
goods, decreased over $25,000,000. Tbe marked
decrease was tbe value of unmanufactured
wool $11,023,683, and in tbat ot scrap and pig
iron, $12,810,671, Tbe value of imports or
sugar, on the other hand, showed an increase
of $7,157,171, or steel rails $4,341 ,621, of bars
$2,161,201, and of steel in bare, ingots, etc.,
$820,046. Contracted, the imports were aa fel
lows: Somestlo merchandise, $9,088,925,817;
loreigh merchandise $18,151,899; total, $902 -377.846;
imports pt merchandise, $612,681,628;
exocss of exports over Imports of meichandise,
S5U.712.7iS; aggregate ef exports over Imports,
$1,545,041,974'.:. Compared with Ihe previout
year there was au increase ol $66,738 88$ in
the value or exports of merchandise, aud a de
crease or $25.20,118 in the value ol imports.
The annual averaga of inerease of imports ol
merchandise over exports thereof tor ten years
previous to June 30, 1873, was $101,866,932, bat
for the last six years there has been an excess of
exports over imports of merchandise amounting
to $1, 180,868,103, an annual aveiage of $186,
778 017. Tne specie value of the exports of do
mestic merchandise was $376, 616. 473 in 1870, and
8883.925,917 lu 1881, aa increase of $307,369,171,
er 135 per cent. The value of imports was
$4i5,958,4i)8ln 1870, and $642,661 628 iu 1881, an
increase ol $20,678,220, or 17 perceut. During
each year from 1862 to 1879 incluatve.the exports
of specie exceeded Ibe imports. Tbe largest ex
cess ol such export over imports was reached
during tbe year 1864. when it amounted to
$92,201,929, but during the year ended June SO,
168U, ihe imports ot coin and bullion exceeded
tbe exports by $76,891,381.
THE FIVE AND SIX FER CENTS.
In tbe last annual report ot tbe seoretary of tbe
treasury Ihe attention ol congress was oalled to
the fact that $469,651,050 in 6 per cent, bends and
$203,573,750 in 6 per cent, bonds, would become
redeemable during tbe year. Congress waa ask
d to authorise the refunding of these bonds at a
low rate of interest. The bill for refunding
baying failed to become a law, tbe seoretary o
the treasury in April last notified the holders of
the $195,690,100 $ per cent, bonds tben outstand
ing mat Ihe bonds would be paid at par oa July
1 lollowing, or that they might be coutinued at
the pleasure ol the government to bear interest
at the rate ol 311 per cent, per annum. Under
this notice 178,055, 150 of the 6 per cent, bonds
were (Continued at tbe lower rate, and $17,635,
250 were redeemed. In the month of May a like
notice was giveu respecting the redemption er
coutiuuance of the 4'i9, 84 1,850 ol per cent,
bonds tben outstanding, of these $49l,504.9j0
were continued at 3M per cent, per annum, aud
$38,336,160 redeemed. 1 be 6 per cent, bouds ol
the loan ol February 9, 1866, and ot the Oregon
war debt,- amouutiug together lo $11, 15, SOU,
baviug matured duing the year, the secretary of
tbe treasury gave notice of bis intention lo re
deem the same, and eucU as have beeu presented
have been paid from the surplus revenue. There
bave also bee a redeemed at par $16,179,100 ol
of the 3)1 percent, coutiutieu bonds, making a
total of bouds redeemed or wbich have ceased lo
draw interest, during the year $121,969,650. The
reuuoliou of the anuual interest on the public
debt through these transactions la as lollows:
By reduction of inteiest to 8M percent. $10,
173.952 27; by redemption el bonds, $6,352,310
total,. $16,826.22 27. Tbe SM per cent, b ..nils,
being payable at tbe pleasure ol tue government,
are available for tlo investment of aurplua rev
enue without the payment of premiums. Uuleu
Ibese bonds cap be lunded at a much lower rale
of interest than they now bear, 1 agree with the
secretary of tbe treasury that no legislation re
specting tbem is desirable. It is a matter fur
congratulation that the business of the country
haa been so prosperous during tbe past year, as to
yield by taxation a large surplus ot income to
tbe government. If tbe revenue lawe remain
unchunged Ibis surplus must year by year in
crease, on account ol Ibe reduction of tho nubile
debt and its burden of interest, aad because of
the rapid iucrease ot our population. Iu 160,
just prior, to ths institution of our internal rev
enue system, our pupulatiou but slightly ex
ceeded 30,09.000. By Ihe census of 180 it is
now found lo exceed 50,000,000 It is estimated
that even if the annual receipts aud expendi
tures should continue as at present, tbe entire
debt could be paid iu ten years, lu view, how
ever, oi the heavy load of taxation winch our
people have already borne, we may well con
sider whether it is not ths part of wisdom to re
duce the revenue, even ii we delay a litlle the
payment of tbe iebt.
ABOLISHMENT OV TAXATION.
It seems to me tbat tbe time haa arrived wben
the ptople may justly demaud soaae relief from
their present enermous burden, and that by due
economy in the various branches of tba public
service this may readily be afforded. I there
fore concur with -the secretary, recommendlug
the abolition of all internal revenue taxes,
except tbese upon tobacco in ita various foiins
and distilled epirita and fermented liquors, and
except also tbe speciaLtax upon the mtnulaclu
rers or dealers in such articles. The intention
of tbe latter tax is desirable as afford ng tbe
officers cl the government a proper supervision
ol tbe articles for tbe prevention of fraud. 1
agree with tbe secretary of the treaaury tbat the
law imposing a stamp tax npon matches, pro
prietaiy articles, playing cards, checks aud
drafts, may with propriety be repealed, and ibe
law also by which banks aod baukers are as
sessed noon tbsir capital and deposits. There
seems to bee geueral sentiment in favor of this
course. In tbe preaeut condition of our revenue
tbe tax upon deposits is especially unjust. It
was never imposed, in this country until it was
deuiauded by tbe necessities i f war, and waa
never exacted, I believe, iu aoy other coantry
even ia its greatest exigencies. Bankers are
required to secure tbeir circulation, by pledg
ing with tbe treaur-r ol the United Stales
bouds oi the general government, and tbe inter
est upon tbote bonds, wblcb at Ihe time when
the lax w is imposed was 6 per cent, is now in
most instances 3M per cent, and besides tbe
entire circulation was allowable. When tb
existing banks bad practically a monopoly ol
tbe business, there was force in the suggestion
ttat lor the franchise to the favored parties,
tbe government might very properly exact a
tax on circulation, but lor years tbe system
bas be n Iree and the amount of circulation
reeulated by Ihe pubilo demand Tbe reten
tion of this lax bus been suggested as a means
of reimbursing the government for the expense
ol printing aud furnishing these circulating
uotes. If the tax should be repealed, it would
certainly seem proper lo require the national
banks to pay the amount oi such expense to
the comptroller of Ibe currency. It is, per
haps, doubtful whether tbe immediate leduc
liun of the rale of taxation upon liquor and
tobacco is advisable, especially in view of the
draiu on the treaaury, which mint attend the
payment of arrear of pensions. A compari
son however, of the amount of taxes collected
under ihe varying rates of taxation, which
have at different times prevailed, suggests Ibe
intimation that some r duclion may soon bv
made without materia! diminution of the reve
nue. The tariff laws also need a revision, bat
that a due regard .may be paid to tbe conflict
ing interests ol our cittaens important cbangee
should b mace with caution. If a caralul rr
vimoii can not be made at ibis session a com
mission, such as was lately appoiated by the
senate and is now recommended by the secre
tary of the treasury, would, doubtless, lighten
the labers of congress wbenever this subject
shall be brought to lis consideration.
THE rOSTAL BTSTBH .
The report ol the postmaster-aensral la a
gratifying exhibit of tbe growth aud effl -.iency
ol the uestal service. The receipts from pestsge
and olber ordinary sources during the past flscn)
year were $36,489,816 58. The receipts from the
mosey order business were $293 58 39, noting
a total of $36,785,398 97. Ihe etpeuditure lor
the fiscal er was $69,251,73 16. Tbe deficit
supplied oat of tbe geueral treasury was $21,
811,193 50, or 63 per cent ol the amount. Tne
receipts were $3,168.91 63 in excess of those of
the previous year, aud $1,575,397 97 in excess of
the estimate made iwo years auo, before tbe ;rea
ent period of business prosperity had lalrly be
gun. The whole number of lei tors mailed in
this country in the last fiscal year exceeded
1.000,600,000. The registry yft.-m is reported
to b in an excellent condition, having ben re-
modiled during tue past four years with good
results.
THE MORMON QCBSTION.
The fact that Ibe aiherents of tbcMorroon church,
which rests upon polygamy as itsceraner stone,
have reoently been peopling in lnr.ee numbers
Idaho, Arizona aud oilier of our western ter
ritories is well calculated to excite the liveliest
interest anil apprehension, it imposes npon
congress and the executive the duty of exer
cising against this barbarous system all ibe
power which, under the constitution and the
law, Ibey can wield for its destruction.
POPULAR EDUCATION".
Although our system of fovernmenl dees not
contemplate thst the nation should provide or
support a system for the -ducstion of our pee
ple. no measures calculated to promote that gen
eral intelligence and virtue, upon which the
perpc tttity of our institutions so greatly depeads,
has ever been regarded with indifference by
congress or the executive. A larfie portion ef
the public domain bas bten from lime to time
devoted, lo the promotion of education. There
is nowa soeciul reason why, by setting apart
the proceeds of its sales of public lands, or by
aome other course the governm nl should aid
the work of education. Many who now exer
eise tiie right oi eufiVage are unable to retd the
ballot wbich tbey can. Upon many who had
Just emerged Irom a condition of slavery, were
suddenly devolved tbe responsibilities ol citi
zenship. In that portion ol the country most
impoverished by war I have beeu pleased to
learn Irom the report of tho commissioner of
education, that there baa been latalt a coalmen
Cable increase of interest and effort lor their in
struction, but all thatoaa be done by local leg
islation and private generuslly should be sup-
riltment.d bv such aid as can be consiitullonal
y afforded by the government, if any fund bo
dedicated to this purpose, it may be wisely dia
irlbuted in different states, aeeording to tbe
ratio of illiteracy, as by Ibis means those loca
tions which are mostiu need of suoh assistsnoe
Will reap its especial benefit.
AGBICULTDBE Al'D PENSIONS.
The report of the oommbsioner of agriculture
exhibits results of the experiments in wbich that
department has beei engage - during tbe past
year, and makes importune suggestions in ref
erence to the agricultural development ol the
country, me steady iucrease ol our population
and tbe consequent addition to the number ol
those engaged in tbe pursuit of husbandry, are
giving to tula department a growing dignity and
importance. Tne commissioner's suggestion
touching its capacity lor greater usefulness,
deserves attention, as it more and mere com
mends itself to tbe interest whioh it was created
to promote.
It appears from tbe report of the commissioner
of pensions, that since 1860 789.063 original pen
sions claims bave been filed. Of these. 150,959
have been allowed and inscribed on the pension
roll, 72,5 9 have been rejected and abandoned,
being 13 plus per cent, of tbe wbole number of
claims i ttle i. There are now pending for set
tlement 285,675 original pension claims, 227,040
ol which were filed prior to July 1, 1880. These,
wben allowed, will involve the payment of ar
rears from the date ot discharge In the case ot an
invalid, and irom tbe date ol death or termina
tion of a prior right in ail other oases.
VBOM ALL THB DATA OBTAINABLE
it is estimated that 18 per cent, of the number of
elaiine now pending will be rejected or abandon
ed. This would sbow the probable rejectien of
21,010 eases and the probable admission of abooit
198,000 cases, all of which involve the payment
of arrears of pensions. This number or claims,
193,000, could be acted upon in a period of six
years; and taking January 1,1884. as a near
period from whioh to estimate in eoob cose an
average amount of arrear, it is found that
every case allowed would require for the
first payment upon it tbe sum of $1,390. Bnt
in view of tbe speedy assembling of your body I
have preferred to await such legislation as in
roar wisdom the occasion may seem to demand.
BRIGANDAGE. a
It may perhaps bo tbougbt proper to provide
that tho setting on foot within our own territory
of brigandage and armed marauding expedi
tions against friendly nations and their citizens
sbail be punishable as an offense against tbe
United States. I will add that In theev.ntofa
request from the territorial government for pro
tection by tho United States against domestic
violence Ibis government would be powerless to
render assistance, 'ihe act of 1795, chapter 36,
passed at a time whea territorial governments
received little attention from congress, enforced
this duty of tbe United States only as to state
governments, but the act ol 1807, chapter 39, ap
plied also to territories. This law seems lo bave
remained In force nntil the revision of the stat
utes when provisions for the territories dropped.
I am not adviaed whether this alteratiou was
intentional or accidental, but as it seems to me
that tbe territories should be offered the protec
tion wbich ia accorded to tbe state by the consti
tution, 1 suggest legislation to that end. it
seems to me tbat whatever views may prevail as
to the polioy of recent legislatloh, by whicb the
army bs oeased lo be a part of tbe posse comi
tatus, an exception might well be made for per-u-llting
the military to assist tbe civil territorial
authorities in cnlorcing tbe laws of the United
States. This use of tbe army would not seem to
be within tbe alleged evil against wbich that
legislation is aimed. From spareaees ol popula
tion aud other circumstances, it is often quite
impracticable to summon a civil posse in places
where officers of justice require asistance, and
where a military force Is within easy reaoh.
IMPROVEMENT OF THE MISSISSIPPI.
I advise an appropriation lor such internal
Improvements aa too wisdom of congress
may deem to be of publio importance. The ne
cessity ol improving tbe navigation of the Mia
sissiDui river. Justifies an allusion to that auh-
jeot. I saggest lbs due adoption of some meas
ure tor tne removal oi ooairuotiona wnicn now
impede- tbe navigation of that great channel ef
commerce.
CIVIL SERVICE BEFOBM .
In my letter accepting tbe nomination lor the
vice-presidency, I stated that in my judgment
no man should be the inoumbent of aa office, the
duties of whioh he ia for any cause unfit to per
form, who Is lacking in ability, ndelity or in
tegrity wbisb a proper administration of sueji
office demands. This sentiment would doubt
loss meet with general acquiescence, but opin
ion has been widely divided upon tbe wisdom
aad practicability ot the various reformatory
schemes which bave been suggested, and of
certain proposed regulations governing ap
pointments to publio office. T he efficacy- of such
regulations has been diairusltd, maiulv because
they have seemed to exact mere educational
and abstract testa above general business capac
ity and even of special fitness for tba partic
ular work in band. It aeems to me that the re
sult that should be spplied to ibe management
of tbe nublio service mav nrouerlv conform in
tba main to auch as regulate tbe condition of
successiui private business, original appsint
menta should bo baaed upon ascertained fitness.
The tenure of office should be stable and posi
tions of responsibility sbould, so for aa prac
ticable, be filled by ibe promotion of wonhy
aud efficient officers. The investigation ol all
eomuUinta and tbe punishment ot all official
conduct.
SHOULD BE PROMPT AND THOROUGH,
The views expressed in the foresoina- letter are
those which will govern my administration of
me executive umce. iney are doubtless shared
by all intelligent and patriotic cicisens, how
ever divergent in tbeit opinion, aa to the best
methods of putting tbem into practical opera
lien. For example, the assertion that original
appointments should be based upon an ascer
tained fitness, is not open to -dispute, but the
question how in practice such fitness can be
most effeotually ascertained is one wbioh has
for years excited II lerest and discussion. Tbe
measure, whicb, with slight variation in its
detail, has latery been urged on the attention
ol congiessand the executive, bas as iu prin
cipal leatnre tbe scbeme of competitive exam
ination, save for certain exceptions which need
aot here be specified, this pian would permit
admission to the service only in its lowest grade,
aud would accordingly demand that all vacan
cies in higher positions should be filled by pro
motion alone. In these particulars it is in con
formity with tbe existing civil service system
of Great Britain, and indeed the success which
bas attended that system In the country of its
uirtu ia tue strongest argument wnicn nas oeeu
urged lor iu adoption heie. The loot ehould
not. however, be overlooked that there are
certain features of the English system which
have not generally been received with favor in
tbia country, even among the foremost advocates
oi civil service rsurm Among tbem are; first,
a tenure of office which is substantially a Ills
tenure; second, a limitation of the maximum
age at wnicn an applicant can enter the service,
whereby all men, in middle life or nuder, are,
with some exceptions, rigidly excluded; third,
a reiiriaz allowance nnen e-olnir out of nine.
These three elements are as important lactera
of the problem as any of tbe others. To elim
inate this from tbe Snoiish system would effect
a moat radical change in its practice. Tbe
avowed purpose of tbat system is to Induce
tne euueuiea young men oi tne country to de
vote tbeir lives to publio employment, by an
assurance tbat having once entered upon
THET NEED WEVEB LEAVE IT,
and that after voluntary retirement tbey shall
be recipients of an annual nanaion. That this
system, as an entirety, bas proved very success
iui in vareat jtruain, seems to De generally con
ceded, even by those who once onDosed its adnn-
linn. To a statute which should incorporate all
its essential features, I should leel bound to give
my approval, but whether it would be lor the
best interests of the public to fix upon an ex
pedient for immediate and extensive applica
tion wbioh embraces certain features of the
English system, but excludes er ignores others
of equal imnortanoe. may ba seriously doubted.
even those wbo are impressed as 1 am myself
witn tue grave importance or correcting the
evils wblcb exist in the present methods of appointment-
If. for exaiuole. the Entrliah rnl
which shuts ont persons above tbe age of 25
years irom a targe number of public employ
menu Is not tc be made an easantial part of our
system, it is questionable whether the attain
ment of tbe highest number of marks at a com
petitive examination should ba Ibe criterion by
wbich all applications for appointment should
be put to tbe lest; and under similar eonditions
it saayalao be questioned whether admission lo
tbe service sbould be strictly limited to iu low
est ranks. There are very many characteristics
whicb go to make a model oivil servant. Prom
inent among them are probably industry, good
souse, good habits, good temper, patience,
order, courtesy, tact, self-reliance, manly de
ference to superior officers and manly consider
ation for iuleriors. The absence or Ibeae traiU
is net supplied by a wide knowledge of books,
or by promptitude In answering questions, or
bv any otber quality llkely;to be brought to light
by competitive examination. To mate success
In such a contest, therefore, an indispensable
condition ol tbe public employment would very
likely result In the practical exclusion. of the
older applicants, even though they might pos
sess qualifications far superioi to their younger
and more brilliant competitors. These sugges
tions muf-t nut be retarded as evlnoing aoy spirit
of opposition to tbecompeiulve plan, wbicli has
oeen to some ex teal successfully employed al
ready, and whioli may berealler vindicate the
claims el their most earne-t supporters. Another
feature of tbe proposed system is the selection
by promotion or all officers of the government
above the lower grade, exueot such aa wuuld
fairly be rea-arded as exponents of the policy of
tue wAticunvt: aim principles oi tue uominaot
party to afford encouraaeini-nt to faithful uublin
servants by exciting in their minds tbe hope of
promotion u tuey are louna lo merit it, is much
lobe desired, but would it be wise to adopt a
rule so rigid as to permit no other mode of sup
plying the intermediate walks of the service.

While there, the doctors said I had a hole iu my

over a hundred dollars in doctors and medi

went around that I was dead. I gtve np hope,
but a friend told me of Dr. William Hall's

thinking tbat my case was incurable, but I got
a bottle to satisfy tbem, when to my surprint
