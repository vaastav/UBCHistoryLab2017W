Little to .Say About Tariff.
Washington, Dec. 6, Economy In
government affairs is tho koynoto of
President Taft's annual message rend
"before both houses of congress today,
rrho mcfiHngo approximates 40,000
words and Is one of the longest over
submitted by a presldont.
Conservation ,of tho public domain,
Bhlp subsidy, fortification of tho Pana
ma canal and tho continuation of tho
present tariff board aro tho loading
subjects touched upon. Ho also re
Tlows tho work of tho various gov
ernment departments and concurs In
.recommendation, tending toward the
bettering of tho service, made by sov
oral of tho members of his cablnot.
Economy Is Urged.
In dwelling on tho urgent need for
economy In government expenditures, tho
president Bays: "Every effort has been
mado by each department chief to reduce
tlio cstlninted cost of his department for
tho ensuing ilscal year ending June 30,
3912. I say this In order that congress
may understand that these estimates thus
made pretrnt the smallest sum which will
maintain tho departments, bureaus and
offices of the government and meet Its
other obligations under existing law, and
that a cut of these estimates would re
sult In embarrassing the executive branch
of the government In tho performance of
Its (dutlcs. This remark docs not apply
to the river nnd harbor estimates, except
to those for expenses of maintenance and
the meeting of obligations under author
ized contracts, nor does It apply to the
public building bill nor to tho navy build
ing program. Of course, as to these con
gress could withhold any part or all of
tho rstlmntes for them without Interfer
ing with the rlls' harge of the ordinary ob
ligations of these functions of Its depart
ments, bureaus nnd offices,
"Against the estimate of expenditures
$640,491,013.1:, we have estimated receipts
for next year $(S0.O00,000, making a proba
ble surplus of ordinary receipts over or
dinary expenditures of about MO.OOO.OOO, or
taking Into nceotint the estimates for the
Panama canal, which nro fcW.OKI.SlT.CO, and
which will ultimately bo paid In bonds.
It will leave n detlrlt for the next year of
.about $7,000,000, If congress shall conclude
to fortify tho cnnal."
Wants Forest Limitation Removed.
On the subject of conservation he o.
votes considerable space to forest, coal,
oil and gas. phosphnto lands nnd water
power sites. As to the reservation of
forest lands he snvs: "The law now pro
hibits the reservation of any more forest
lands In Oregon. Washington. Idaho,
Itontnnn, Colorado nnd Wyoming, except
by net of congress. I nm Informed by the
department of agriculture that tho gov
ernment owns other tracts of timber land
in these states which should be Included
In tho forest reserves. I recommend to
congress that the limitation herein Im
posed bo repealed.
"Congress ought to trust the executive
to use the power of reservation only with
respect to land most valuable for forest
purposes, During the pn'sent administra
ting, K,;.vi.VV) acres of land largely non
tlmbcrcd have been excluded from forest
reserves, nnd 3,500.000 acres ov" land prin
cipally valuable for forest purposes havo
been Included In forest reserves, making
a reduction In forest reserves of non
timbered land nmountlng to ?;7&0,0C0
acres,"
Wants Canal Fortified.

dent asserts th.1t utiles unexpected ob

tolls and nnnngement nro made, nnd re
rardlng fortlflcntlon of tbo canal, he
says:
"Among questions arising for present
nolutlon Is the. decision whether the ennal
hall be fortified. I have already stnted
to the congress thnt I strongly favor for
tification and I now relternte this opin
ion and nsk your consideration of tho
mibject In the light of the rnpnrt already
before you mad" bv a competent board.
"Knlltini to fortify the cnnal would

Ship Subsidy.
The president urges such nctlon ns he
behoves will Increase American trade

Urcourse." Criticism of the Tariff.
In the space devoted to tho tariff the
prr.ddent sny:
"The schedules of the rates of duty In
the Payne torlrf act have been subjected
to a great dnal of criticism, son o of It
Just, mom of It unfounded, and too much
misrepresentation, The net was adopted
In putsimnee or n declaration by the par
ty which Is responsible for It that cus
tom bill should bo a tariff for the pri.
tection of home Industries, tho measure
of the protection to be tho difference be
tween the cost of producing the Imported
nrtlclo abroad and the cost of producing
It nt home, together with such addition to
that difference ns might glvo a reasonable
profit to the home producer. The basis
for the criticism of this tariff Is that In
respect to a number of the schedules the
declared measure was not followed, but n
higher difference retained or Inserted by
way of undue discrimination In favor of
certnln Industries nnd manufactures. Lit
tle, If any, of tho vitlclsm of the tariff
has been, directed ngalnst the protective
principle tibovo stated; but tbo main body
of the criticism has been based on the at
tempt to conform to the measure of pro
tection was not honestly and sincerely
ndherert to."
The president also refers to the appoint
ment' of a board of experts to Investigate
the cost of production of various articles
Included In tho schedules of tho tariff,
nnd concludes:
"Whether or not the protective policy Is
to be continued, anil the degree of protec
tion to be accorded to our home Indus
tries, are questions which tho people must
decide through their chosen representn.
tlves. Put whntevcr policy Is adopted, It
Is clear that tho necessary legislation
should bn based on an Impartial, thor
ough ond continuous study of tho facts."
Recommends Parcels Post.
The ndoptlon of the parcels post Is
again adopted. On this subject President
Taft says! "With respect to the parcels
post, I respectfully recommend Its adop
tion on nil rural delivery routes, and that
U pounds tho International limit bo
mado the limit of enrrlngo In such post.
The samo nrgument Is mado ngalnst the

Impossible to do without extravagant ex
penditures." Department of Justice.
Discussing the nffalrs of tho department
of Justice, the president says:
"I Invite especial nttentlon to the prose
cutions under the federal law of the so
called 'bucket shops,' nnd of those
schemes to defraud In which the use of
the mnll Is mi essential part of the
fraudulent conspiracy, prosecutions which
have saved Ignorant nnd weak members
of the public nnd nro saving them hun
dreds of millions of dollars. Tho viola
tions of the anti-trust Inw present per
haps the most Important litigation before
tho department, and the number of cases
filed show. tho activity of the govern
ment In enforcing that statute,
"In a speclnl messago last' year I
brought to the attention of congress the
propilcty and iwlsdom of enacting n gen
eral law providing for the Incorporation
of Industrial and other companies engaged
In Interstate commerce, and I renew my
recommendation In thnt behalf. '
The crying need In the United States
of cheapening tbo cost of litigation by
simplifying Judlclnl procedure and ex
pediting final Judgment Is pointed out nnd
action looking to correction of these evils
Is urged.
Tho president recommends nn Increase
In tho snlarlos of federal Judges.
Postal Affairs.
In regnrd to postal matters the presi
dent points with prldo to its present etll
clent management and the recent reduc
tion In the deficit. Tbo present unre
stricted franking privilege comes In for
comment with a suggestion for the ndop
tlon of better methods for Its regulation.
Abolish Navy Yards.
The president call attention to certain
reforms urged by the secretary of the
navy which he recommends for adoption,
nnd continues:
"The secretary of the navy has given
personal examination to every nnv' yard,
anil has studied tho uses of the navy
yards with reference to the necessities
of our lleet. Willi n tleot considerably
less than half the size of that of the
Prltlsh navy, we hnvc shipyards more
than double the number, and there nre
several of these shipyards expensively
equipped with modern mcldncryi which,
after Investigation the secre(nry of the
navy believes to bo entirely useless for
naval purposes. Ho asks authority to
abandon certnln of them nnd to move
their machinery to other places, whero It
can be made of use." '
Speaking of our foreign relations the
president says: "During the past year
the foreign .relations of the United Stntes
havo continued upon a basis of friendship
nnd good .understanding.
"The year has been notable ns witness
ing tho pacific settlement of two Impor
tant International controversies before the
permanent court of Tho Hague.
"Tho arbitration of the fisheries dispute
between tbo United States and Great
Britain, which has been tbo source of
nearly continuous diplomatic correspond
ence slnco the fisheries convention of ISIS,
has given nn award which Is satisfactory
to both parties. This nrbltintlon Is par
ticularly noteworthy not only because of
tho eminently Just results secured, but
also because It Is tho first arbitration held
under the genernl orbltratlon treaty ol
April 4, 190S, between tho Unltid Stntci
and Oreat Prltnln, nnd disposes of a con
troversy the settlement of which hns re
slsted every other resource of diplomacy
nnd which for nearly ninety years has
been tho cause of friction between two
countries whoso common Interest lies In
maintaining the most friendly and cordial
relations with ench other.
President Tnft makes a few recommen
dations for changes In tho Interstate com
merce law and says:
"Except as above, I do not recommerJ
any nmendment to tho Interstate com
merco law as It stands. I do not now
rocommend nny nmendment to tho anti
trust law, In other words, It seems te
mo that tho existing legislation with
rofcrenco to the regulation of corpora
tions and the restrnlnt of their bustnesi
has reached n point where we can stoj
for a while and witness tho effect of tin
vigorous execution of tho laws of (hi
statute books in restraining tho nbusei
which certainly did exist nnd whloh
roused tho public to demand reform."
