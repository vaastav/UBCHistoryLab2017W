NATIONAL AFFAIRS.
The extra session glided into the
regular session of Congress on Moa
dayNkst, and there being no delay in
organization the President’s message
w*e immediately presented. Being
the first annual message of President
Hayes it was looked for with unusual
intsrest. As it is too lengthy for our
apace we give its main points in brief.
The financial question is discussed at
length. The President favors the
faithful execution of the Uw provi
ding for specie resumption and depre
cates tbe incessant agitation of the
subject in Congress. He iloae not fa
vor the unlimited remonelhudion of
silver. The President makes no
lengthy discussion of his Southern
policy, but states the views lirhich he
entertains of the relations of the two
sections and the necessity of a resto
ration of harmony. Allusion is also
made to the efforts of the administra
tion in the direction of civil service
reform. Although difficult to carry
into successful and satisfactory execu
tion in the present state of party ma
chinery and feeling he earnestly ar
gues tbe necessity of civil service re
form, so that a wise and beneficial
administration of the Government
shall not so continually be interfered
with by the influence of party patron
age and party factions. The message
is in tbe main a sensible, frank and
patriotic paper, free from any taint of
partisanship and pervaded by a spirit
of wholesome earnestness.
A PARTY CRISIS.
Last spring the destinies of
the country hung tremblingly
for mtfny days on the magic
figures Bto 7. Last week the repub
licans of the Senate passed through a
similar crisis. As they suddenly woke
up to the reality that thestste of par
ties stood 39 to 37, with two republi
cans mighty uncertain, there was no 1
little consternation in the. ranks.—
Their control of the Senate seemed to
be suddenly coming to an end. They
were not working in harmony nt the
best. A number of prominent sena- i
tors are very sore-headed. The Pres
idents course is not to their liking.—
But now their party supremacy was
in utmost peril. The wrangling of
factions must cease . It would take
skilful engineering and cool beads in
the leadership to avert disaster and
wreck. The air was full of rumors
with tbe House democratic, and the
Senate rushing to the same condition.
The alarming rumor took foot that
Tilden might attempt a desperate
dash for the Presidential chair in the
French style. The crisis wa serious.
Tbe republican press sounded tbe|
alarm. Anxious solicitude prevailed
in the party ranks as they watched
the greatest contest which now com
menced with the energy of a death
struggle and lasted for a full week.
Tbe sudden trouble was that Con
over, of Florida, and Patterson of
South Carolina, both republicans,
showed signs of kicking in the traces.
Patterson is in a delicate situation.—
An indictment is hanging over hi*
head which may possibly transfer him
to an institution not half so cheerfully j
ventilated as tbe Senate. No wonder
his wrath rose at bearing such fre- >
quent allusions to the penitentiary.— I
He admitted he was going to vote fori
the admission of the democratic claim- 1
ant from South Carolina to a seat in l
the senate. But he was in no unholy!
alliance with tbe democrats. His re-'
publicanism, be said, would bear fa-J
vorable comparison with that of the
present occupant of the Presidential <
mansion. Congress took the floor to I
make like expressions. Both parties'
were wrought up to high excitement. ■
The republicans feared defeat—the'
democrats feared disappointment after
all. A full week was consumed in (
adroit parliamentary tactics and time
killing speeches.
The contest was finally ended two
hours after midnight on Friday with'
the admission of Kellog from Louisi>
ana, by a vote of 30 to 28, and But- 1
ler from South Carolina by 29 to 28,
which is a gain of one Senator to each
arty, Sharon, of Nevada, republi-j
can, stays away from the Senate to
attend to his big silver mine. If.he
will attend to his duty as he ought,
and Patterson keeps clear of that other
ugly institution, the republicans may
reasonably expect freedom from an
other such scare during this session.
Let us have peace.

1 A parly of emigraritsfoY Arkansas
[started from Pittsburg On Wednesday
lon a flat-boat, intending to travel by
| the river, but had hardly got into the
stream when by a collision with a'fleet
'of coal boats their vessel broke up,
[throwing them all into the river.
Five, persons were drowned, includ
ing a man, his wife and two children.
! Laura Bannan, a young lady resid
-1 ingin Baltimore, on Sunday playfully
| pointed a loaded pistol at Mr. James
Murphy, a gentleman who had accom
panied her to church and returned
. home with her. The pistol went off,
and the ball crashed into the unfor
tunate young man’s brain. The
wound was fatal.
It is reported that seventeen hun
dred of the Indians on the ttiarch to
, tbe new reservation on the Missouri
■ river have stampeded and left the
1 main body. This parly of Indians was
joined by 2,800 others when they
started, and tbe short rations caused
by this large increase in the number
,to be provided for may have caused
i the stampede if it Ipas occurred:
ji Isaac Evans, an aged .and infirm
"colored man, residing ; along the,
’! mountain, near BurkiUaville,’ who is
r unable to support hindself, and is
r without friends willing to keep him,
• was taken to Moatevue Hospital on
Sunday last.
Fanny Blair, a bright mulatto girl,
has been arrested in Charles county,
and committed to jail, on the charge
of murdering her fifteen months old
i child by throwing it into an unused
; well near Beantown. The evidence is
1 very strong against her, and the only
reason assigned for the commission of
the horrible crime is, that a man had
| promised to marry her provided she
got clear of the child.
Last Thursday, when the grand ju
ry of Montgomery county asked to be
\ discharged for the term, the court in
structed them to return to their room
and inquire through whos# neglect
the county jail still remains in a dan
gerous and terrible condition, not
_ withstanding frequent reports of
grand juries as to the matter. It is
probable that the county commis
sioners will be indicted for neglect of
their duty in tho premises.
A special dispatch from St. Paul,
dated November 24, says ; ! 'The cap
tive Nca Perces arrived libre about-8
vo'clock and defeat 10 this evening for
1 Fort Leavenworth, via namely Mason
City and Ottumiva arid through
' Northwest Missouri.- Large crowds
of people greet<d them at’the depots,

ed from their fears of treachery, and
are reconciled, to the transfer.
