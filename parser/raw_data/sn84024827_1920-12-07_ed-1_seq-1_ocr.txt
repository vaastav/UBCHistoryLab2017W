ARGENTINA IS IGNORED
Action of South Americans in
Withdrawing Arouses Only
Passing Consideration
GENEVA, Dec. G. By the Asso-
tinted
i
Prcss) The league of nations
assembly
today decided to stick to a.
jslow and sure policy in amending the
covenant and to extend that policy to
the interpretation of the relations be
tween the council and the assembly
with regard to their respective duties
and jurisdictions under the covenant.
The Canadian amendment elimin'at-l
:ng Article 10, and the Argentine
amendment that all sovereign states
I shall be members of the league that
J do not remain outside of their own
I choice were referred to a special com
,'mittee which will study all the pro
posed changes in the covenant and
j report to the next assembly.
Th question as to what are the
I exact relations between the council!
'and assembly was temporarily and
(partially settled by the adoption, of a
!sort of working basis in the fonn of
the four general principles enumerat
ed in the recent report of the commit-
tee presided over by Balfour with
(certain amendments. .
The first principles wmch set forth
that the council and the assembly
each should be invested with particu-
il'ii linu'oi 'inj .liitiit. ...wl fH.i nn!t,.iM
j should have jurisdiction to render de-
'cisions in any matter which had been
expressly committed lo the other.
Lord Robert Cecil declared must be
amended so as to concede to the as
sembly the right to examine any ques
tion within the jurisdiction of the
league. He contended that on the
principle as expressed the assembly
i would he unable to treat with the
important questions of disarmament
and mandates and added that, his
South African delegation would not
accept the report.
The committee also accepted the
proposition to eliminate the word "ex
clusive" from the second principle,
. i .i i . ... . .
.Milieu ueciares inni tne assemDiy nas
ino power to reverse or modify a de
jcision which falls within the exclu
sive competence of the council. On
(the objection of the Canadians, how
ever, this principle was reserved.
The third and tourth principles set
ting fourth the status of representa
tives sitting on the council and the
assembly and making provisions for a
report from the council to the assem
bly were adopted.
The Argentine inc ident, involving
the w ithdrawal of that d legation from
the assembly, was disposed of quickly,
the assembly showing indifference. In
stead of inviting the delegates back. I
the assembly merely expressed regret!
at tneir action through Mr. Hymar.s.
chairman, and Lord Robert Cecil. The
only sign of feeling on the part of the
jthe members was that of approval
when Lord Robert said that no dele
gate body could get on with it's busi
ness if the members were allowed to
leave whenever their ' particular
positions were not accepted.
