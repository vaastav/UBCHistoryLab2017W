FELLOW GinzKxs OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE or
ItEPitEgENTAtivjis: Our heartfelt gratitude la due to
the divine being who holds in his haud3 the destinies
of nations for the continued bestowal, during the
last year, of countless blessings upon our country.
Wo are at peace with all other nations. Our public
credit has greatly imjjroved and ia perhaps now
stronger than ever before. Abundant harvests have
rewarded the labors of Ui03e who till the soil. Our
manufacturing industries are reviving and it Is be
lieved that the general piosperity, which has been so
long anxiously looked for, ia at last within our
reauii.
THE TiELLOW FEV2K.
The enjoyment of health by our people generally
has, however, been interrupted during the past sea
sou by tlio prcvalonca of a fatal pestilence, the yellow
fever, in somo portions of the Southern States, cre
ating an emergency which called for prompt and ex
traordinary measures of relief. The diseaae appeared
at New Orleans and other places ou Hie lower Missis
sippi soon after midsummer. It was rapidly spread by
fugitives from the infected towns and cities, and did
not disappear until early in November. The States
of L'AiUiauit, Mississippi aud Xenneasee have suffer
ed severely. About oue hundred thousand cuses are
believel to have occurred, of which about 20,000,
according to intelligent estimates, proved fatal. It
5s impossible to estimate with any proximate to accu
racy, the loss to the country occasioned by the epi
demic. It is to be rockonud by the hundred millions
of dollars. The suffering and destitution that resulted
excited the deepest sympathy in all parts of the
Union. Physicians and nurses hastened from every
quarter to the assistance of the afflicted communi
ties. Voluntary contributions of money and sup
lilies in every needed form were speedily and gener
ously furnished. Tim government was able to re
spond in tomo measure to the call for help by pro
viding tents, rn diciues and food for the sick and
destitute, ue requisite directions for the purpose be
ing given in the coniident expectation that
this action of the executive would receive
the sanction of Congress. About 1,800
tents and rations of the value of about
S'J5,li00 were sent to cities aud towns which applied
for thorn, full details of which will bo furnished to
Congress by the proper department. The fearful
Bpreiul of this pestilouce lias awakened a very gen
eral ijublic sentiment in favor of a national sanitary
administration, which shall not only control quaran
tine, but have the sanitary supervision of internal
commerce in times of epidemics, aud hold an advi
sory relation to the State and municipal health au
thorities, With powers to deal with whatever endan
gers the public health, and which the municipal and
State authorities are unable to regulate. The national
quarantine act, approved April 29, 1878, which was
passed too late in the last hours of Congress to pro
vide the means for carrying it into practical operation
chirh t'p ii&a'i ocr.MOn, .a a stop in the direction hero
indicated, In view of the necessity for the most ef
fective measures by quarantine and otherwise for the
protection of our seaports and the country generally
from this and other epidemics, it is recommended
ihat Congress give to the whole subject early and
4|rel'ul consideration.
E COX.OII LIMB.
The permaneut pacification of the country by the
complete xn'otection of ail citizens in every civil and
political right continues to be of paramount interest
With the great body of our people. Every step in
this direction is welcomed with public approval and
every interruption of steady aud unit'orm progress
to tho desired consummation awakens general un
easiness and wide-spread condemnation. The recent
Congressional elections have nrnished a direct and
trustworthy tet.t of the advance thus far made iu the
practical establishment of the right of suffrage se
cured by the constitution to the liberated race in the
Southern States. All disturbing influences, real or
imagiuary,had been removed from all of these States.
The constitutional amendments which conferred
freedom and equality of civil and political
rights uiJoii the colored people of
the South wore adopted by tba concurrent
action of tho great body of good citizens who main
tained the authority of the national government and
the integrity and perpetuity of tho Union at such a
cost of treasure aud lifo as a wise and necessary em
bodiment iu the organic law of tho just results of
the war. The people of the former slave-holding
States accepted these results and gave iu every prac
ticable form assuraucea that the thirteenth, four
toeuth and lifteeuth amendments and laws passed in
pursuance thereof, should in good faith bo enforced
rigldiy and impaitiallyiu letter and spirit, to the end
that thu humblest citizen without distinction of raco
or color, should under them receive full and equal
protection iu person and property and iu political
rights and piivileges. By these constitutional
amaudment^ the southern section cf the Union ob
tained a large increase of political power iu Congress
and iu the electoral college, and tho country justly
expected that electious would proceed, as to the en
franchised race, upon the same i ireumstances of
lesjal and constitutional freedom aud protection
which obtained in all the other States of the
Union. Tho friends of law and order looked forward
to tho conduct of these eiec.ions, as offering to the
general judgineut of the country an important op
portunity to measure the degree in which the right of
suffrage cou'd bo exercised by the colored peoplo,
and would be respected by their fellow-citizens. Hut
a more general enjoyment of freedom of auh'rage by
the coloied people, and a mora just aud generous
protection of that freedom, by the communities of
which they form part, were generally anticipated,
than ths record of the elections discloses. In some of
thoso States in which colored people have been unable
to make their opinions felt in the election, tho result
is mainly due to influences not easily measured or
remedied by legal protection, but in
tlio States of Louisiana and South
Carolina at large, and in some particular
Congressional districts outside of the3e States, the
records of fhe election seem to compel tho conclu
sion that the rights of colored voters have beeu over
riden aud their participation in the elections.not per
mitted to be either general or free. It will be for the
Congress for which these elections were had to make
such examination into thoir conduct as may be ap
propriate to determine the validity of the claims of
members to the seata. In the meanwhile it becomes
the duty of the executive and judicial departments
of tho government, each in its province, to inquire
into and puniiih violations of tho laws
of the United States which have oc
curred. I can but repeat what
I said, in this connection, in my last message, that
whatever authority rests with me, to this eud, I shall
not hesitate to put forth, aud I am unwilling to fore
go a renewed appeal to the legislatures, the courts,
tho executive authorities, and the people of the States
where the wrongs have been perpetrated, to give their
assistance towards bringing to justice the offenders
und preventing a repetition of the crime. Ko means
withm my power will bo spared to obtain a full and
fair investigation of the alleged crimes, and to se
cure tho cou\ iction and just punishment of the
guilty.
It is to be observed that the principal appropria
tion made for tho department of justice at the last
session contained tho following clause: "And for
defraying the expenses which may ba incurred in the
act approved Feb. 23,1871, entitled au act to amend
an act approved May 30,1370, entitled au act to en
force tho rights of citizens of tho United States to
vote in the several States of the Union and for other
purposes, or any acts amendatory thereof or supple
mentary thereto." It is the opinion of the attorney
general that the expenses of those proceedings will
largely exceed the amount which was thus provided,
and I rely confidently uyon Congress to mako ade
quate appropriations to enablo tho executive depart
ment to enforce the lawn.
I respectfully uvgo upon your attention that the
Congressional elections in every district, in a very
important sense, are justly a matter of interest and
concern throughout the whole country. Each State
aud every political party is entitled to a share of
power which is oonferred by tho legal and constitu
tional suffrage. It is tho right of every citizen pos
sessing the qualifications prescribed by law to cast
one untimidated ballot and to have his ballot honest
ly counted. So long as the exercise of this
power and the enjoyment of this right are common
and equal, practically as well as formally, submission
to tho results of the suffrage will be accorded loyally
and cheerfully, and all the departments of the gov
ernmentwill leel tho tiue vigor of the popular will
thus expressed. temporary or administrative in
terests of government, however urgent or weighty,
will ever displace the zeal of our people in defense of
tho primary right3 of citizenship. They understand
that tho protection of liberty requires the mainte
ince lull vigor of tho manly methods ot tree
ech free presa and free suffrage, and will sustain
'all authority of the government to enforce ths

depend on the protection afforded to their citizens.
xaero can be no peace without such protection, no
prosperity without peace, and the whole country is
deeply interested In tlra growth and prosperity of all
its parts. While the country has not yet reached
complete amity of feeling and reciprocal confidence
between the communities so lately and so seriously
estranged, I feel an absolute assurance that the ten
dencles are in that direction and with increasing
force, the power of public opinion will override
all political prejudices and all sectional or ?State at
tachments in demanding that all over our wide ter
ritory the name and character of cit zens of tho
United States shall mean one and the same thing
and carry with them unchallenged security and re

PAKIS EXPOSITION.
Our relations with other countries continue peace
ful. Our neutrality in contests between foreign pow
ers has been maintained and respected. The uni
vewal exposition held at Paris during the past sum
mer has been attended by large numbers of our citi
zens. The brief period allowed for the preparation
and arrangement of the contributions of our citizens
to this great exposition was well employed in ener
getic and judicious efforts to overcome this disad
vantage. These efforts, led and directed by the com
missioner general, were remarkably successful, and
the exhibition of the products of American industry
was creditable and gratifying In ssope and character.
The reports of tho United States commissioners,
giving its results in detail/will be duly laid before
yon. Our participation in this international compe
tition for the favor and the trade of the world may
be expected to produce useful and important re
sults in promoting intercourse, friendship and com
merce with other nations.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY CONFERENCE.
In accordance with the provisions of the act of
JTeb. 28,1878, three commissioners were appointed to
an international conference on the subject of adopt
ing a common ratio between gold and silver, for the
purpose of establishing, internationally, the use of
bi-metallc money, and securing fixity of the relative
value between those metals. Invitations were address
ed to the various governments which had expressed
a willingness to participate in its deliberations. The
conference had itB meeting in Paris August last.
The report of the commissioners, herewith submit
ted, will show its results. No common ratio between
gold and silver could be agreed upon by the confer
ence. The general conclusion was reached that it 13
necessary to maintain in the world the monetary
functions of silver, as well as of gold, leaving the
selection of the use of one or the other of these two
metals, or of both, to be made by each. State.
THE HALIFAX AWAi
Congress having appropriated at its last session
the sum of go^OO.OiiO to pay the award of the joint
commission at Halifax, if after correspondence with
the British government on tho subject of the con
formity of the award to the requirements of the
treaty, and to the terms of tlio question thereby sub
mitted to the commission, the President shall deem
it his duty to make the payment, communications
upon the^e points were addressed to the British gov
ernment through the legation of the United States at
London. Pailkg to obtain the concurrence of the
British government in the views of this government
respecting theigward, I have deemed it my duty to
tendor tho sunftiamed within the year fixed by the
treaty, accompsniod by a notice of the grounds of the
payment, acd'ja protest against any othor construc
tion of the same. The correspondence upon this
subject will be laid before you.
CUBAN INSURRECTION.
The Spanish government has officially announced
the termination of tho insurrection in Cuba and the
restoration of peace throughout the island. Confi
dent expectations are expressed of a revival of trade
and prosperity which it is earnestly hoped may prove
well founded. Numerous claims of American citi
zens f*r relief for injuries or restoration of property
have been among the incidents of the long continued
hostilities. Some of these claims are iu process of
adjustment by Spain and the others aro promised
e^rly and careful consideration.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
The treaty made with Italy in regard to reciprocal
consular privileges has been duly ratified and pro
claimed. No questions of grave importance have
arisen with any other of the European powers.
A? AH AND CHINA.
The Japaneso.gpvernment has boen desirous of a
revision of sueh-J*irta of its treaties with foreign
powers as relate to cornrwrco BWSj fia^^&ito^S^S^^^^your favm-aWe^on^o^te
has addressed to each of the treaty powers a request
to open negotiations with that view. The United
States government has been inclined to regard the
matter favorably. Whatever restrictions upon
trade with Japan aro found injurious to that people
cannot but affect injuriously nations holding com
mercial intercouso with them. Japan, after a long
period of seclusion, has within the last few years
made rapid strides in the path of enlightenment and
progreas and not unreasonably is looking forward to
the time when her relations with the nations of
Europe and America shall be assimilated to those
which they hold with each other. A treaty looking to
this end has been made which will be submitted for
consideration of the Senate.
After an interval of Beveral years the Chinese gov
ernment has again sent envoys to the United States.
They have been received and a permanent legation is
now established here by that government. It is not
doubted that this step will be of advantage to both
nations in promoting friendly relations and removing
causes of difference.
BAMOA.
The treaty with the Samoau Islands having boen
duly ratified and accepted on the part of both govern
ments is now in operation, and a survey and sound
ings of the harbor of Pago have been made by a naval
vessel of the United States with a view of its occupa
tion as a naval station, if found desirable to the
service.
RELATIONS WITII MEXICO.
Since the resumption of diplomatic relations with
Mexico, correspondence has been opened and still
continues between the two governments upon tho
various questions which at one time seemed to en
danger their relations. While no formal agreement
has been reached as to the troubles on the border,
much has been done to repress and dimmish them.
The effective force of United States troops on the
Rio Grande, by a strict aud faithful compliance
with instructions, has done much, to iemove the
sources ot dispute, and it is now understood that a
like force of Mexican troops on the other side of the
river is also making an energetic movement against
marauding Indian tribes. This government looks
with the greatest satisfaction upon tvery
evidence of strength in the national
authority of Mexico, and upon every effort put forth
to prevent or to pnulsh incursions upon our terri
tory. Heluctant to assume any action or attitude in
the control of these incursions by military move
ments across the border, not imperatively demanded
for the protection of the lives aud property of oiu
own ci izens, I shall take the earliest oi porrunity
consistent with the proper discharge of this plain
duty to recognize the ability of the Mexican govern
ment to restrain, effectively, the violations of our
territory.
It is proposed to hold, next year, an international
exhibition in Mexico, aud it is believed that the dis
play of the agricultural and manufacturing products
of the two nations will tend to a better understanding
and increased commercial interests between then
people.
SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES.
With Brazil, and the republics of Central and South
America, some stops have been taken toward the
development of closer coxnmercial intercourse. Dip
lomatic relations have been resumed with Columbia
and Bolivia. A boundary question between the
Argentine republic andParaguay has been submitted
by those governments for arbitration to the President
of the United States, and I have, after careful ex
amination, given a decision upon it. A naval ex
pedition up the Amazon and Madeira rivers has
brought back information valuable for scientific and
commercial purposes. A like expedition is about
visiting the coast of Africa and the Indian Ocean.
FOREIGN COMMERCE.
The reports of diplomatic and consxilar officers
relative to the development of our foreign commerce
here, furnished many facts that have proved of pub
lic interest and have stimulated to practical ex ertion
the enterprise of our people.
THE TREASURY.
The report of the secretary of the treasury fur
nishes a detailed statement of the operations of that
department of the government and of the condition
of the public finances. The ordinary revenues from
all sources for the fiscal,year ended June U0, 1878,
were 3257,763,878.70. The ordinary expenditures for
the same period were $'S36,9(U,32S.80 leaving a sur
plus revenue for the year of S20,7y9,551.91'. The re
ceipts for the present fiscal year ending June 30,1879,
aotual and estimated, are as follows: Actual receipts
for the first quarter commencing July 1, 1878,
$73,389,743.43 estimated receipts for the remaining
three-fourths of the year, $191,110,256.57. Total for
the present fiscal year, actual and estimated, $261,-
500,000.
The expenditures for the eamo period, will be,
actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter
commencing July 1st, 1S73, actual expenditures,
$73,344,573.27, for the remaining three quarters of
the year the expenditures are estimated at S168,-
755,426.73 making the total expenditures $2,401,000.0
and leaving an estimated surplus of tho revenue for
the year ending June 30,1879, of 244,000.00.
The total receipts during the next fiscal year, end
ing June 30, 1880, estimated according to existing
laws, will be $264,500,000, and the estimated ordinary
expenditures for the same period will be $236,320,-
412.68, leaving a surplus of $28,179,587.32 for that
year.
THE PUBLIC DEBT.
In the foregoing statements of expenditures, actual
and estimated, no amount is allowed for the sinking
funds provided for by the act approved February 25,
1882, which requires that one per cent, of the entire
debt of the United States sha'-l bo purchased or paid
within e*ch fiscal yoar to be set apart as a sinking
i.nd. Thore has been, however, a substantial com
pliance with the conditions of the law. By ite terms
the public debt should have been reduced between
1862 and the close of the fiscal year 8518,361,836.28.
The actual reduction of the ascertained debt in that
period has been $720,544,739.81, being in excess of
the reduction required by the ticking fund act of
$203,282,933.33. The amount of the public debt less
cash in the treasury November 1,1878, was $2,024,200-
083.18, a reduction since the same date, last year, of
$23,150,617.39.
BEFCNDING THE DEBT.
The progress made during the last year In refund
ing the public debt at lower rates of Interest la very
gratifying. The amount of 4 per cent, bonds sold
during the present year prior to Nov. 23, 1878, is
100,270,900, and 6 per cect. bonds, commonly
known as 5:20's, to an equal amount have been or
will be redeemed as calls mature. It has been the
policy of fhe depaitmeut to place the 4 per cent,
bonds within easy reach of every citizen who desires
to invest his savings, whether small or great, in these
securities. The secretary of the treasury recom
mends that the law be so modified that
small sums may be invested and that through
the post offices or other agents of
the government, the freest opportunity may be given
in all parts of the country for such investments. The
best mode suggested is that the department be au
thorized to issue certificates of deposit of the denom
ination of ten dollars, bearing interest aMbe rate of
3:65 per cent, per annum, convertible at any time
within one year after tbeir issue into 4 per cent, bonds,
authorized by the refunding act, and* to be issued
only in exchange for United Stales nojfes sent to the
treasury by mall, or otherwise. Such a provision of
law, supported by suitable regulation, would enable
any person readily, without cost or risk, to convert
his money into an interest bearing security of the
United States, and the money so received could be
applied to the redemption of 6 per cent, bonds.
The coinage of gold during the last fiscal year
was Sr
the coinage of silver dollars, under
the act passed July 28, 1878, amounted, on the 23d
of Nov., 1878, to 19,814,550, of which amount 84,-
984,947 are in circulation, and the balance, S14,82V
603, is still Jn the possession of the government.
SPECIE RESUMPTION.
With views unchanged with regard to tho act under
which the coinage of silver proceeds, it has been the
purpose of tho socretary faithfully to execute the law,
and to afford a fair trial to the measure. In the pres
ent financial condition of the country I am persuad
ed that the welfare of legitimate business and indus
try of every description will be best promoted by ab
staining from all attempts to mako radical changes
in the existing financial legislation. Let it be
understood, that, during the coming year, the
business of the country will be undisturbed by in
terference with th* laws affecting it, and we may
confidently expect that the resumption of specie
payments, which will take place at the appointed
time, will be successfully and easily maintained, and
that it will bo followed by a healthful and enduring
revival of business prosperity. Let the healing in
fluence of time, the inherent energies of our people,
and the boundless resources of our country have a
fair opportunity, and relief from present difficulties
will surely follow.
OUB AltMT.
The report of the secretary of war shows that the
army has been well and economically supplied, that
our small forco has been actively employed, and has
faithfully performed all {he service required of it.
The morale of the army has improved, and the num
ber of desertions has materially decreased during the
year. The secretary recommends tn^t a pension be
granted to the widow of the late Lieutenant Henry H.
Benner, who lost his life by yellow fever while in
command of the steamer J. M. Chambers, sent with
supplies fcr the relief of the sufferers in tho South
from that diseaae.
The establishment of the annuity scheme, for the
benefit of the heirs of deceased officers, as suggested
by tho paymaster-general the adoption, by Con
gress, of a plan for the publication of the records of
the war of tho rebellion, now being prepared for that
purpose. The increase of the extra per diem of sol
dier teachers employed in post schools, and liberal
appropriations for the erection of buildings for
schools and libraries at the diffcreht posts the re
peal or amendment of the act of June 18, 1878, for
bidding tho use of tho army as a posse comitatus or
otherwise for the purpose of executing the laws, ex
cept in such cases and under such circumitances as
may be expressly authorized by the constitution or
by act of Congress the passage of a joint resolution
of Congress legalizing the issues of rations, tenta and
medicine which were made for the relief of sufferers
from yeliow fever that provision be made for the
erection of a fire proof building for the preservation
of certain valuable records, now constantly exposed

THE NAVY.
The report of the secretary of the navy showes that the
navy has improved during the last fiscal year. Work
has been clone on seventy-five vessels, ten of which
have been thoroughly repaired and made ready for
sea. Two others are in rapid progress toward com
pletion. The total expenditures of the year, includ
ing tho amount appropriated for the deficiencies of
the previous year, were 17,438,302.65. The actual
expenses chargeable to the year, exclusive of these
deficiencies, were $13,306,914.09 or $797,199.18 less
than those of the previous year, and
$4,928,677.74 less than the expenses in
cluding the deficiencies. The estimates
for the fiscal year ending June 30,1880, are $lf,562,-
381.45, excoodiug the appropriations of the present
year only $83,949.75, which excess is occasioned by
the demands of the naval academy and the marine
corps.
As explained in the secretary's report the appro
priations for the prbsent fiscal year are $14,528,431.70,
which, in the opinion of the secretary, will be ample
for all the current expenses of the department dur
ing the year. The amouut d-awn from the treasury
from July 1 to November 1, 1878, is $4,740,544.14, of
which $70,980.75 has been refunded, leaving as the
expenditure for that period $4,669,503.36 or $620,899.21
less than the corresponding period of the last fiscal
ear.
THE POSTAL SERVICE.
The department of the postmaster-general em
braces a detailed statement of tho operations of the
postofiico department. The expenditures of that de
partment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878,
was $31,165,084.49. The receipts, including sales of
Stamps, were $29,277,516.95. The sum of 190,436.90,
included in the foregoing statement of expenditures,
is chargeable to proceeding years, so that the actual
expenditures for the fiscal year eediug June 30, 1878,
are estimated at $365,719.U0 and the receipts, from
all sources, at $20,664,023.90, leaving a deficiency to
be appropriated out of the treasury of $5,907,876.10.
The report calls attention to the fact that the com
pensation of postmasters of railroads for carrying
the mail is regulated by law and that the failure of
Congress to appropriate the amount required for
these purposes doo3 not relieve the government
of responsibility, but necessarily increases the defi
ciency bills, which Congress wDl be called upon to
pass.
In providing for the postal service the following
questions are presented: Should Congress annually
appropriate a sum for its expenses largely in excess
of its revenues, or should such rates of postage be
established as will make the department self sus
taining
Should the postal service be reduced by excluding
from the mails matter which does not pay its way
Should the number of post route3 be diminished?
Should other methods be adopted which will in
crease the revenue or diminish the expenses of the
postal service?
INTERNATIONAL POSTAL CONGRESS.
The international postal congress, which met at
Paris Mayl, 1878, and continued in session until June
4th of the same year, was composed of delegates from
nearly all the civilized covoitries of the world. It
adopted anew conventtou to take tho place of the
treaty concluded at Berne, Oct. 9,1874, which goes
into effect on tho 1st of April, 1879, between the coun
tries whoso delegates have signed it. It was ratified
and approved by aud with the consent of the Presi
dent, August 13, 1873. A synopsis of this universal
postal convention will be found in the report of the
postmaster general, and the full text in the
appendix thereto. In its origin the post
al union comprised tw-^cy-three countries,
having a population of 350,i/\w,000 of people. On
tho first of April next, it will comprise forty-three
countries and colonies with a population of more
than 630,000,000 of people and will soon, by the
accession of the few remaining countries and colo
nies which maintain organised postal services, con
stitute in fact as well as in name, as its new title in
dicates, a universal uuion, regulating upon a uniform
basis of cheap postage rates, the poatal interests be
tween all civilized nations.
Some embarrassment has arisen out of the con
flict between the. customs laws of this country and
the provision of the postal convention iu regard to
the transmission of foreign books and newspapers to
this country by mail. It is hoped that Congress will
be able to devise some means of reconciling the
dfflcultiea which have thus been created, so as to do
justice to all parties involved.
COURT BUSINESS.
The business of the supreme court and of courte
in many of the circuits was increased to such an ex
tent during past years, that additional legislation is
imperative to relieve and prevent the delay of justice,
and possible oppression to suitors, which is thus oc
casioned. The encumbered condition of these dock
ets is presented anew in the report of tho attorney
general, and the remedy suggested is earnestly urged
for Congressional action. The creation of additional
circuit judges, as proposed, would afford a complete
remedy, and would involve an expense, at the present
rate of salaries, of not more than $60,000 a year.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
The annual reports of the secretary of the interior
and of the commissioner of Indian affairs, present
an elaborate account of the present condition of the
Indian tribes and of that branch of the public ser
vice which ministers to their interests. While the
conduct of the Indians generally has been orderly
and their relations with their neighbors friendly and
peaceful, two local disturbances have occurred which
were deplorable in thtir character, but remained hap
pily confined to a comparatively small ntunbor of
Indians.* The discontent among tho Bannocks,
which led first to somo acts of violence on the part

break, appears to have been ansed by an In"
sufficiency of food on the reservation and
this insufficiency to have been owing to
the inadequacy of the appropriations made by
Congress to the wants of the Indians at a time when
the Indians were prevented from supplying the defi
ciency by hunting. After an arduous pursuit by the
troops of the United States, ana several engage
ments, the hostile Indians were reduced to subjec
tion and the larger part of them surrendered them
selves as prisoners. In this connection I desire to
call attention to the recommendation made by the sec
retary of the interior that a sufficient fund be plsced
at the disposal of the executive to be used with prop
er accountability at discretion in sudden emergencies
of the Indian service.
The other case of disturbance was that of & band of
Northern Cheyennes, who suddenly left their reser
vation, in the Indian territory, and marched rapidly
through the States of Kansas and Nebraska. Iu the
direction of their old hunting grounds, committing
murderB and other crimes on their way. From docu
ments accompanying the report of the secretary of
the interior it appears that this disorderly band was
as fully supplied with the necessaries of life as the
4,700 other Indians who remained quietly on their
reservation, and that the disturbance was caused by
men of a restless and mischievous disposition among
the Indians themselves. Almost the whole of the
band have surrendered to the military authorities,
and it Is a gratifying fait that when some
of them had taken refuge in the camp of the Red
Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been in friendly
relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners, and
readily gave them up to the ofacers of the United
States, thus giving new proof of a loyal spirit, which,
alarming rumors to the contrary, notwithstanding,
they had uniformly shown evyr since the wishes they
expressed at the council of September, 1877, had been
compUed with.
MOUNTED INDIAH AUXILIARIES.
Both the secretary of the irierior and the secretary
of war unite in the recommendation that provision be
made by Congress for the organization of a corps of
mounted "Indian auxiliaries," to be under the con
trol of the army, and to be U'jed for the purpose of
keepmg the Indians on their reservations, and pre
venting and repressing distur'jance on their part. I
earnestly concur in this recommendation. It is be
lieved that the organization of such a body of In
dian cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from the gov
ernment, would considerably weaken the restless ele
ment among the Indians by withdrawing from
it a number of young men and giving them
congenial employment under the government,
it being a matter of experience" that In
dians in our service, almost without "exception,
are faithful in the performance of duties assigned to
them. Such an organization would materially aid
the army in the accomplishment of a task for which
its numerical strength is sometimes found insuffi
cient. But while the employment of force for the
prevention or repression of Indian troubles is of
occasional necessity, a wise preparation should be
made to that end, greater reliance must be placed on
humane and civilizing agencies for the ultimate so
lution of what is called the Indian problem.
It maybe very difficult and require much patient
effort to curb the unruly spirit of the savage Indian
to the restraints of civilized life, but experience
shows that it is not impossible.- Many of the tribes
which are now quiet and orderly and self-supporting,
were once as savage as any that at present roam over
the plains or in the mountains of the far West, and
were then considered unaccessible to civilizing influ
ence. It may be impossible to raise
them fully up to the livel of the white
population of the United States, but we should net
forget that they are the aborigines of the country
and called the soil their,own on which our people
have grown rich, powerful and happy. We owe it to
them as amoral duty to help them in attaining at
least that degree of civilization which they may be
able to reach. It is not only our duty, it is also our
interest to do so. Indians who have becoae agri
culturists or herdsmen, and feel an interest in prop
erty, will thenceforth cease to be a warlike and dis
turbing element.
INDIAN EDUCATION.
It is also a well authenticated fact that Indians are
apt to be peaceable and quiet when their children are
at school, and I am gratified to know from the ex
pressions of Indians themselves and from many con
curring reports, that there is a steadily increasing de
sire even among Indians belonging to comparatively
wild tribes to have their children educated. I invite
attention to the reports of the secretary of the in
terior and the commissioner of Indian affairs touch
ing the experiment recently inaugurated in taking
fifty Indian children, boys and girls, from different
tribes, to the Hampton Normal Agricultural institute
in Virginia, to reeeivc-
aneTemeiitary EngHsn edvfcaHon and training in
agriculture and other useful work, to be returned to
their tribes after the completed course, as inter
preters, instructors and examples. It is reported
that the officer, charged with the selection of those
children, might have had thousands of young In
dians sent with him, had it been possible to make
provision for them. I agree with the secretary of
the interior in saying that "the result of this inter
esting experiment, if favorable, may be destined to
become an important factor in the advancement of
civilization among the Indians."
INDIAN TRANSFER.
The question whether a change in the control of
the Indian service should be made, was, at the last
session of Congress, referred to a committee for in
quiry and report. Without desiring to anticipate
that report, I venture to express the hope that in the
decision of so important a question, the views ex
pressed above may not be lost sight of and that the
decision, whatever it may be, will arrest further agi
tation of this subject, such agitation being apt to
produce a disturbing effect upon the service as well
as on the Indians themselves.
HOT SPRINGS COMMISSION.
In the enrollment of the bill making appropriations
for sundry civil expenses at the last session of Con
gress that portion which provided for the continua
tion of tlio Hot Springs commission was omitted.
As the commission had completed tho work of taking
testimony on the many conflicting claims, the sus
pension of their labors before determining the rights
of claimants threatened for a time to embarrass the
interests, not only of the government, but also of a
large number of the citizens of Hot Springs who
were waiting for final action on their claims before
malting contemplated improvements. In order to
prevent serious difficulties which were
apprehended, and at the solicitation
of many leading citizens of Hot Springs, and
others interested ia the welfare of the town, the sec
retary of the interior was authorized to request the
late commissioners to take charge of the records of
their proceedings, and to perform such work as
could properly begone by them under such circum
stances to facilitate the further adjudication of the
claims at an early day, and to procure the status of
the claimants, until their right should be finally
determined. The late commissioners complied
with that request, and report that the testi
mony iu all the cases has been written out
examined, briefed and so arranged as to facilitate an
early settlement as authorized by law. It is recom
mended that the requisite authority be given at as
early a date in the session as possible, and that a fair
compensation be allowed the late commissioners for
the expense incurred and labor performed by them
since the 25th of June last.
TIMBER THIEVES.
I invite the attention of Congress to the recom
mendation made by the secretary of the Interior with
regard to the prc servation of timber on the public
lands of the United States. The protection of the
public property is one of the first duties of the gov
ernment. The department of the interior should,
therefore, be enabled by sufficient appropriations to
enforce the law- in that respect. But the
matter appears still more important as a
question of public economy. The rapid destruction
of our forests is an evil fraught with the gravest
consequences, especially in the mountainous districts
where the rocky steppes once denuded of their trees
will remain so forever. There, the injury once done
cannot bo repaired. I folly concur witu the secre
tary of the interior in the opinion that for this reason
legislation touching public timber in the mouutainous
States and Territories of the West should be es
pecially well considered, and that existing laws in
which the destruction of forests is not sufficiently
guarded against should be speedily modified. A
general law concerning this important subject ap
pears to me to be matter of urgent necessity.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIONS.
Prom the organizations of the government the im
portance of encouraging, by all possible means, the
increase of our agricultural productions has been
acknowledged and urged upon the attention of Con
gress and the people, as the surest and readiest
means of increasing our substantial and enduring
prosperity. The words of Washington are as ap
plicable to-day as -when, in his eighth annual mes
sage, he said: "It is not to be doubted, that, with
reference, either to individual or national welfare, ag
riculture is of primary importance." In proportion
as nations advance in population and other circum
stances of maturity, this truth becomes more ap
parent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more
and more an object of public patronage. Institu
tions for promoting it grow up, supported by the
public purse, and to what object can it be dedicated
with greater propriety Among the means -which have
been employed to this end none have
been attended with greater success than the estab
lishment of boards composed of proper characters,
charged with collecting and difusing information and
enabled by premiums and small pecuniary aids to
encourage and assist the spirit of discovery and im
provement, this species of establishment, contrib
uting doubly to the increase of improvement by
stimulating to enterprise and experiment, and by
drawing to a common centre the results everywhere
of individual skill and observation and spreading
th/unthence over the whole nation. Experience ac
cordingly hath shown that they are very cheap in
struments of immense national benefit.
The great preponderance of the agricultural over
any other interest in the United States entitles it to
all the consideration claimed for it by Washington.
About one-half of the population of the United States
is engaged in agriculture. Tho value of ths agricul
tural products of the United States for the year 1878
is estimated at $3,000,000,000. The exports of agri
cultural products for the year 1877, as appears from
the report of the bureau of statistics, was $534,000,-
000. The great extent of our onntry,
with its diversity of soil and climate,
enables us to produce within dur own
borders, and by onr own labor, not only the neces
saries, but most of the luxuries that are consumed in
civilized countries. Yet, notwithstanding our advan
tage of soil, climate and Inter-communication, it ap
pears, from the statistical statements in the report of
the commissioner of agriculture, that we import an
nually from foreign lands may millions of dollars
worth of agricultural products, whiob could be raised
in our own country.
Numerous questions arise in the practice of ad
vanced agriculture which can only be answered by
experiments, often costly and sometimes fruitless,
which are beyond the means of private individuals
and are a juet and proper charge on the whole nation
for the benefit of the nation. It is good policy, es
pecially in times of depression and uncertainty In
other business pursnits, with a vast area of unculti
vated and unproductive territory, wisely opened to
homestead settlement, to encourage by every proper
and legitimate means the occupation and tillage of
the soil.
The efforts of the department of agriculture to
stimulate old and introduce new agricultural indus
tries, to improve the quality and increase the quan
tity of our products, to determine the value of old or
establish the importance of new methods of culture,
are worthy of your careful and favorable considera
tion aud assistance, by such appropriations of
money and enlargement of facilities as may seem to
be demanded by the present favorable conditions for
the growth and development of this important in
terest.
CRUELTY TO ANIMALS IN TRANSIT.
The abuse of animals in transit is widely attracting
public attention. A national convention of societies,
specially interested in the subject, has recently met
at Baltimore, and facts developed, both in regard to
cruelties to animals, and the effect of such cruelties
upon public health, would seem to demand the care
ful consideration of Congress and the enactment of
more efficient laws for the prevention of these abuses
EDUCATION.
The report of the commissioner of the bureau of
education shows very gratifying progress through
out the country in all the interests committed to the
care of this important office. The report is especially
encouraging with respect to the extension of the ad
vantages of the common school system in sections
of the country where th general enjoyment of the
privilege of free schools is not yet allowed. To edu
cation, more than to any other agency, we are to
look as the resource for the advancement of the peo
ple in the requisite knowledge and appreciation of
their rights and responsibilities as citizens, and I
desire to repeat the suggestion contained in my
former message in behalf of the enactment of appro
priate measures by Congress for the purpose of sup
plementing with national aid the local systems of ed
ucation in the several States.
LIBRARY ACCOMMODATIONS.
Adequate accommodations for the great library,
which is outgrowing the capacity of the rooms now
occupied at the Capitol, should be provided without
further delay. This valuable collection of books,
manuscripts and illustrative art has grown to such
proportions, in connection with the copy-right system
of the country, as to demand the prompt and careful
attention of Congress, to save it from injury in its
present crowded and insufficient quarters. As this
library is national in its character, and must, from
the nature of the case, increase, even more rapidly in
the future than in the past, cannot be doubted that
the people will sanction any wise expenditure
to preserve it aud enlarge ita usefumesi.
NATIONAL MUSEUM.
The appeal of the regents of the Smithsonian In
stitution for means to organize au exhibit and make
available for the public benefit the articles now stored
away belonging to the national museum, I heartily
recommend to your favorable consideration.
THE HEALTH OF CAPITOLIANS.
The attention of Congress is again invited to the
condition of the river front of the city of Washing
ton. It is a matter of vital importance to the health
of the residents of the national capital, both tempo
rary and permanent, that the lowlands in front of the
city, now subject to tidal overflow, should
be reclaimed. In their present condi
tion theso flats obstruct the drainage
of the city and are a dangerous source of malarial
poison. The reciimation wilt improve the navigation
of the river by restricting and consequently deepen
ing its channel, and is also of importance when con
sidered in connection with the extension of the pub
lic ground and the enlargement of the park we&t and
south of the.Washington monument.
WASHINGTON HARBOR.
The report of the board of survey heretofore or
dered by act of Coagress on the improvement of the
harbor of Washington and Georgetown, is respect
fully commended to consideration.
DISTRICT MATTERS.
The report of the canvass of the district of Colum
bia, presents a detailed statement of the affairs of
the district. The relative expenditures by the United
States and the district, for local purposes, is contrast
ed, showing that the expendituras by the people of
the district, greatly exceeded those of the general
government. The exhibit is made in connection
with estimates for the requisite repair of the detect
ive pavements and sewers of the city, which is a
work of immediate necessity, and in the same con
nection a plan is presented for
the permanent funding of the out
standing securities of ^the district. The benevo
lent reformatory and penal institutions of the dis
trict are entitled to the favorable attention of Con
gress. The reform school needs additional buildings
and teachers. Appropriations, which will place all
of these institutions in a condition to become models
of usefulness and beneficence, will be regarded by
the country as liberality wisely bestowed.
The commissioners with evident justice request at
tention to the discrimination made by Congress
against the district iu the donation of land for the
support of the public schools and ask that the same
liberality that has been shown to th. various States
and Territories of the United States, maybe extended
to the District of Columbia. The commissioners also
invite attention to the damage inflicted upon public
and private interests by the present location of tho
dapots and switching tracks of the several lailroads
entering the city, and ask for legislation looking to
their removal. The recommendations and sugges
tions contained in the report will, I trust, receive the
careful consideration of Congress.
Sufficient time has perhaps not yet elapsed since
the rs-organization of the government of district
under the recent legislation of Congress for the ex
pression of a confident opinion as to its successful
operation, but the practical results already attained
are BO satisfactory that the friends of thenew.govern
ment may woll urge, upon Congress the wisdom
of its continuance without essential modification
until by actual experience its advantages and de
fects may be more fully ascertained.
E. HAYES.
EPECUTIVE MANSION, Washington, D c. 2,1878.
National Greenback Address and Caucus.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.Members of the cen
tral executive commit te of the National party
issued an address to the people of the United
States, reviewing the rise and progress of the
party, predicting its continuance, success, and
rapid strides of its principles, and expressing
confidence that the party will elect its candi
date for the Presidency 1880, with majorities
in Congress and in nearly all
tho Btate legislatures. Th address
denounces the action of the banks, speaking
through the clearing house association of New
fork, and says the contest is not between the
Republican and Democratic parties. I is be
tween the money power and the people, be
tween bank bills, based on untaxed bonds, and
a government legal tender currency, and the
people have no chance whatever of ever secur
ing their emancipation from industrial thral
om either through the party of the money
power, the Republican party, or its ally, the
Democratic party.
Appeal is made for organization in the in
terest of the National party in every school
district, city, town and ward.
The Grecnbackers held a meeting this even
ing with closed doors". They claim Bixteen
members in the ne xt Congress who will act in
dependently, not joining either party in cau
cus, and this number, as a balance of power,
will enable them to decide the speaker
ship and claim the clerkship and
chairmanship of important committees.
They say either Ewing, of Ohio,
Kelly or Wright, of Pennsylvania,
would be acceptable to them as speaker, and
their preferences are for a Democrat. They
propose to maintain in Washington an office
for the distribution of political information,
but not, as has been stated, intend to start here
a Greenback organ. Th following resolution
was adopted at tho conference to-night:
Ilesohetl, That the National party, so far as
it is represented by this conference, denounce
the resumption of specie payments as a fraud
and a delusion, impractical in this or any other
country. Yet if persisted in by the secretary of
the treasury, we iusist that it shall bes car
ried out aa to be equal in its operations in all
sections and to all classes, and inforced for the
redemption of national bank notes as well as
for legal notes issued by the government.
When the twelve strokes of midnight sound
ed forth, seven drunks turned uneasily in their
blankets at the city hall. They had been
taken in out of the wet during the night, from
all parts of the town, and in all conditions of
intoxication. Judge Flint will dry 'e this
morning.

quire and report to the Senate whether at the
recent elections the constitutional rights of
American citizens were violated in any of the
States of the Union. Whether the right of suf

class of such citizens, was denied or abridged
by the action of the election officers of any
State in refusing to receive their votes, in fail

ing fraudulent ballots in pursuance of
conspiracy to make the lawful votes of Bitch
citizens of non-effect, and whether such citi

franchise or forced to use it against their wishes
by violence or threats, or hostile demonstra

House of Representatives.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.The galleries to-day
contained the customary crowd at the opening
of Congress. A noon Speaker Randall rapped
the House to order, when the chaplain made a
prayer and the roll was called.
The roll call showed 229 members present.
Two new members, Bailey of New York and
Majors of Nevada, then took the iron clad oath
and Messrs. Atkins, Cox and Garfield were ap
pointed to inform the President that Con
gress was in session.
When the reading of the message was ended.
Mr. Wood, of New York, rose and moved that it
be referred to the committee of the whole of
the House and ordered printed, but first he
desired to make some comments on it. Al
though as a whole the document was highly
satisfactory, yet there was some references in it
which should be met "at the earliest practicable
moment. referred to that part relating to
the Southern States. He Wood, failed to see
where the President saw any disposition in the
South to avoid or annul in any degree the con
stitutional amendments. failed to see any
indication in the South at any election, at any
time under the circumstances for a series of
years of unwillingness to live in entire
amity with the whole country in
regard to laws or to obey government. re
gretted the President, who had commenced his
administration with such noble and patriotic
position &i agai.:st the military despotism ex
ercised by his predecessor, should now indicate
a change of policy. had watched with in
terest the course of tho administration in order
to see whether the President would be forced
from the manly and noble posi
tion taken by him
knew that there was a wing of the Republican
party dissaiisfied with that position, and it had
been a matter of interest to the whole country
to know whether the President would continue
to maintain his attitude. While the President
expressed his views in rery mild and very de
corous language, yet he indicated quite clearly
that the condition of things in the South was
not satisfactory to him. The President bad re
ferred especially to the elections in 8outh Caroli
na and Louisiana. had been able to single out
two States and only two isolated instances in
those States, that was an indication of vacilla
tion on the part the executive and it was
only because it was such an indication that he,
Wood, felt it his duty to declare that there was
no foundation for the allegation of wrong by
the South. I was to be regretted that
while the President's eyes were open to
the Congressional elections in South Carolina
and Louisiana, they were closed, to what oc
curred in the city of New York on the 5t of
November, where 4,000 legal voters were drag
ged to prison by government officials, and hun
dred of them plunged into the vilest dens as
common prisoners, and where besides
these who had been arrested, 10.000
other voters had been intimidated, thus mak
ing a difference of at least 1,500 votes in the
city New York in the last election. Th
President had not seen that. Th Republican
press of New York had not told that to the
President, but had pointed him to the South.
He (Wood) regretted that the President had
thought proper to lend his high
position to a reiteration of the misrepre
sentation organized for him by the Republicn
press. had the highest regard for the
President, believing him to be an honest and
patriotic man. I was a matter of profound
regret that the President shonld permit him
self to be an instrument in the hands of an
ultra wing of the Republican party.
Garfield replied to Wood. characterized
it as very unusual to interrupt the ordinary
form of proceedings, which was simp ly to re
fer the Presidents message and order its print
ing, by debating any of its suggestions, and he
thought the kind of suggestions made by the
gentleman from Ne^York as still more un
usaal. The exact language of that prt of the
message with which the gentleman
found fault J|g W as not in his
(Garfield's) mind but gentlemen, language
was very plain. (Wood) criticised certain
references in the President's message as to
some disturbances in the course of the federal
election in several States, and contrasted that
with what he chose to call the noble beginning f
the administration in favor of self government,
and said that the President has shown vacilla
tion, because he had seen fit to refer to dis
turbances in federal elections.
If the right of a State to attend to its own
loeal eoneerns undisturbed was in any way oon-
NUMBER 323.
sistent with the right of the national govern
ment to attend to national elections, and if
that was what the gentleman called vacillation,
he hoped they should all vacillate in that way.
He, Garfield, had never made himself
a particular advocate or defender of any ad
ministration for its vacillation or want of vac
illation, but if the gentleman, Mr. Wood, eould
make no better case against the administration
than he had made, he had not very well opened
the ball this winter.
He, Garfield, had the impression made on
his mind from a somewhat careful reading of
the public journals, that very considerable ille
gal disturbances had taken place in some of
Southern States. had heard it stated that
bold, open acknowledged intimidation
had been employed notably in South Carolina,
and in districts where there bad been an over
whelming majority of one political party has
appeared at all. This might be an exaggeration
but if so it was one that was broadcast
through the public press and one whice a Con
gress so notable at the prasent ou for
investigating all charges of wrong doing.should
investigate. supposed his friends on the
other side would welcome the President's sug
gestion, as exactly in the line of their conduct
hitherto, he hoped they would not shift the in
vestigation.
Mr. Wood defended the position he bad taken,
and repeated his expression of regret that th a
President had picked out two cases and deemed
them of sufficient importance to present them
to the world in his annual message.
would tell the gentleman that on the
great and fundamental protection of a citizen
in all his rights, there was no radical or cou
servrtive wing in the Republican party,
but there was one party in
the land united to a man on the proposition,
that American citizens, north, south, and
everywhere, should be protected in the exercise
of his constitutional rights.
Mr. Cox, of New York, asked if the gentle
men from Ohio and Maine failed to remember
how the tape worm ticket of California had
been run by the navy yard. Ha they de
nounced tape worm politics? Not much. He

tions. North or South.

the alleged reception, purchase and conceal
ment of large amounts of fraudulently im
ported silk, betv/een the years 1871 and 1877

ants. Th suits were for the recovery of
double the value of the goodB in question, and
the amount involved was nearly a quarter mil
lion of dollars. The court holds the recovery
sought, under the second section of the act of
1823, cannot be had, because that section and
the act were repealed by the act of 1866 and
that it cannot be had, under the act of 1866,
for the reason that the latter contemplated
criminal and not civil proceedings.

No Objection to Social Fraternisation.
[Benson Times.]
Considerable has been said through oar
exchanges, of late, regarding the actions of
Senator Rice at St. Paul in attending the
banquet given in honor of Henry Poehler,
Congressman elect from this district. Al
though it was not exactly right from a polit
ical standpoint,-we cannot see why our of
ficers and poHticians should not fraternize
after the political issues were settled, and
have become things of the past and more
so to heal the bitter personal enmity which
usually exists between candidates of either
patty. After political issues are settled, it
should become customary for the successful
candidates to meet, honor each other, and
extend a hearty welcome and the hand of
friendship.
