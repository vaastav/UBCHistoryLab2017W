It wfll b? curtains for the local schol-j
%stic football season next Saturday with!
the playing of the big game between |
Bellaire and Martins P'erry high schools!
for the Ohio Valley titular honors. J
Wheeling has decided to quit for the'
?eason although It was the intention to!
play Buckhannon the coming Saturday.
Prof. H. B. Johns stated that Buck
hannon had cancelled the game in order
to meet Parkersburg and the following]
keck was offered to the local school, but)
Suo to the uncertainty of the weather and j
the Inability to .'keep the men in proper j
training condition. It was turned down!
^ and the season of 1918 closed. The pr>
"* posed game between Ferry and Llnsly. I
which has created so much comment.)
will not be played this season as Ferryj
Will meet Bellaire Saturday and after
that It will be too late. This announce-!
rri*nt is to be regretted but the Ferry;
management is extremely anxious to
ffie-'t the locals as can be substantiated
In the words of one of the officials.
TJnsly can consider herself the luck
iest team in the vorld for meeting us
on a wot field, even though we were'
lucky to get a tie." So the Bellaire-1
Ferry sett" will wind up the in and out|
reason of the war-torn period assisted!
by the dreaded epidemtc of Spanish ln-j
Gutnza.
Priming.
Bellaire high stock has gone up con-j
piderably and the entire student body is!
Jubilant over the victory over "Wheelingj
and the sudden spurt which will likely
?lead to the pinnacle of the ladder?a vic
tory over Ferry and the valley cham
pionship. This ran he done, and In
nice way, if th* Red ar.d Black '"beef!
trusts" get down to good hard work j
p.nd bolster up - a hit on th^ir offense]
With a stonewall defense, capable ends;
and a well-balanced" backfleld. the cross-)
fiver boys have plenty to work on and;
tvlth the proper coaching will be in a I
fnost commanding position. Playing on)
the Bellaire grounds is the big thing, in]
Bellaire's favor and it is the earnest]
s rpinion of many that Ferry cannot hear
Bellaire on her home lot. Captain Cul-i
fcerlson showed signs of being a fast)
?nd steady line-plunger, while Fitch and;
Kilgore ran nicely who Tvoprtnan prov-j
big a worthy field general. The work1
bf Bellaire's ends in the Wheeling game
"tvfis particularly "ommendnbifsnnd the'
lighting qualities of the team tn^js^mrnl'
"was conspicuous.
Perry. ? I
Coach Graham is playing wise and
knows what is in store, putting his men
through the mill and preparing a s '? d ?
defense for Bellaire while he 1? well,
pleased with the offensive power ??{ his,
classy backfleld. Ferry came out of the]
hard game with Lunsly in fine fettle, not
a man will be out of the game. DailyI
practices are being held and with rhej
confidence and necessary experience the)
Ferrians will not be caught off-guard i
Cr&ver. the classy little bqek. will be at j
his post, and much dependence is put1
upon him to carry the Purple and White]
to the second successive championship.;
Realizing that the contest means alt. .the1
players are bending forth every otter'i
is a defeat w l! spoil the wonderful rcc-|
ord attained and deprive th- school ?'fi
the honors again. Bellutro has every-,
thins to sain and notnrug to lose. Pre- j
partitions are being made to have a weil,
organized'cheering body to cope success
fully with the! ex- client one that repre
sents the Red 'and Black. Cheering will
be a.part of the menu ar.tr much depends
upon the spirit shown.
"Treat 'em Bough.."
Basketball :s beginning to take on the:
new thought of the various schools and
thei popular door games promises to be!
more in-the lintolight than ev.-r before.
Practically ail of the schools In the Ohio^
Valley will be represented on the floor
and with no obstacles in sight, there is I
no reason why everything should not
boom. Cathedral already has started
practice for another championship five,
while the others will watt until after
next week. The season will start earlier
than last year and as Martins Ferry in
tends to have a representative five, more
Interest will bo manifested in the \allc\.
The Ohio Valley scholastic gridiron
title will be decided between Beilaire and
Martins Ferry. It is very seldom that it
has ever heen the case before, and these
teams are taking advantage of the op
portunity. Aside from last year, it is
hard to recall when the last champion
ship went to the other side of the river
w'th the exception of the year of l-l
when Bellaire had a wonderful team and
copped the honors. Touch luck that two
tjeod teams like .T.tnslv and Wheeling
aro out of the running, and the worst
part of it is. Wheeling sp-db-d -t for
I.inslv. depriving this side ol toe honor,
which no doubt would have br?n the re
sult. had I.'.nsly not been trimmed by the
Old Gold and Blue.
Wheeling by losing to Rellalre Tost
confld-nce b*u was willing to meet Buck
hannon this week for the state t u.
Vow Buckhannon desires to play i ark
ersburg Saturday. Wheeling is cheated
out of both valley and stat" honors;
Wheeling certainly has been the "g<>at
1 this year, and It's mighMy tough when
the popular school has always been rec
ognize* as the peer of them all for
i years and year? h*ok. Ask any ox tho
|/ollows who know?
Speaking .of the present football sea
son. it has been devoid of the usual
thrills and features, and no genuine
gridiron ability has been shown as the
?teams and players were father inconsist
ent. Setting aside the r:\rolry that "s
sted between the fains and the eager
ness to hold one another, there were no
?Tt".k:tig features, and the old time.,
sparkling beauty of the open-game Is
sorely missed. The Spanish Influenza
!-a? shown its mark, and there la no way
tc blot out this assertion.
Triadelphla has the best record and
tops the list, winning two games and los
I Ing none. Coach Coberly had a likely
looking "crowd of youngsters and would
have made a good showing.
Many are contenfplating taking a run
over to Beilaire Saturday to see the Bel
laire-Ferry tilt. There is no telling
what, might happen wlmn these teams
meet and whether the frame is interest
ing or not, there Is always plenty of life
find fun in store. Considerable rivalry
exists between the elevens and playing
at Beilaire will give the Ttfd and Black
the advantage and Ferry will have to
make a grandstand effort to hold their
rivftls. It certainly would he some dope
if Beilaire won. after Llnsly t>eat sen
34-0 arid held Ferry to a tie.
Talk about your season of upsets. Its
been that way all over the country. Take
a peep at the wonderful record of
Ceorgin Tech. Pitt put tho kibosh on
her. then tho Cleveland Naval Reserves
came In and walloped- Fitt for the first
time in four years. Ohio State is play
? Ing like a second rate team this year,
the same of "Washington A Jefferson,
while Yale. Harvard. Cornell. Prince
ton. are either not playing or not show
ing any real class. The season has heen
so erratic and has been more of a joke.
Titt's defeat at the hands of tbe Cleve
landers was a raw piece of work and
would not have occurred any other time.

I that hundreds are hotter off in l.uxcin

Prussian government is apparently only '
tol.-rated by its reiterated assertions it J
can obtain food supplies from the allies
for the civilian population.
The question of revicttmlling Germany
iis more more important from a political

I the existing government than from an j
I economic point of view of relieving ul-j

1VITH TJIE AMERICAN ARMY OF
OCCUPATION. Sunday. l>ec. 1.?(By the
Associated Pr- ss.i?Three or four days
will be required, it is estimated tonight,
for the four first line divisions to com
plete their crossing into German terri
tory. although tho start was made soon
after daylight Sunday. Reveille was
sounded shortly after 5 o'clock, the i
? Americans had breakfast by o and the j
{ march began soon afterward.
I. Tiie advance into Germany was held
| up by the limited number of bridges
across the Saner and Moselle rivers. The
principal bridges used were those at
j iCchternach, Kosport and WasscrbilUg.
on the Sauer and Grcvetimacher, Worm
! eldaiigo and Itemich, on the Moselle.
Sevvial small bridges and fords between ?
j these villages were utilized by various
; uuits.
The American divisions marched with
' full war equipment of steel helniot. gas
| mask, rifle and belts tilled with cart
ridges. The heavy artillery also- rum
'bled along the German roads, while the
! ammunition wagons kept step with the
troops.
The main roads encountered during
the first day's march Into Germany were
tin good condition. At several places the
Americans passed small bridges and cul
verts which apparently bad been re
paired in tho last few days. At some
' places between villages on the principal
! highway's the Americans traveled on or- j
I dinary dirt roads. The roads wldch j
| ran through the hilly country east of I
I the Sacucr wore in fair condition do- I
; spite recent rains.
In the village of Cordell. north of j
i Troves, three war-weary German sol- ;
' diers arrived home bv train from the!
j north Just as tho American advance j
i guard reached the .village. A handful j
| of villagers was at the station to meet '
j the returning Germans. The wives of j
i the returning soldiers were in the crowd. |
The appearance of the marching Amor-1
j icans appeared to awe two of the Ger- j
! matis and their families. This was not
? the case, however, with tho third" sol
j dier, whose wife took him by tho hand
and led him through the village street
1 past the columns of Americans.
There wre no lings or other decern- j
! tions in any of the towns through which j
| the Americans inarched, and no music |
i except that furnished by the Americans. [
? Wherever the Americans asked questions (
i regarding roads, they received courteous j
replies. In the restaurauts and stores i
\ tho Germans sold to the American sol- !
! dicrs any goods on hand at war-time |
! prices.
Perhaps the first American tunes !
heard in Germany were played by the j
bands lu the village of Irrcl. just across ?
the Bauer rivor, north of Kchternach. i
i Tho village was entered by the 125thj
infantry while the villagers wore on i
: their way to church. "With the Aineri
l can flag and the regimental Insignia at i
' the head of the column the 125th rcgi- i
i mental band marched into Irrcl. playing!
. sprightly marching airs. The villagers j
j for tho time being stood bewildered,
? watching the khaki clad procession. No j
! emotion was shown anywhere excepting j
? among tho children, who at some places
appeared to regard the khaki as strange
at first afler the weeks of inarching
j troops In German gray.

dends would be in larger amounts than
now. Surely owners of railroad stocks
might well consider any change better
than the situation of today. Not only
investors, but speculators have been,
badly whipped by railroad stocks In 'hi-1
past few years, and the most though tf..l j
of railroad authorities are in utter <1is-|
enuragement as to the future unlessI
some radical step is taken.
Such a change need not discourage '
itintive on the part of capitalists and J
promoters to repress ambition among]
subordinates. No such effect has been j
produced by the organization of the nn-]
tiotnil banks in the federal reserve s; s-!
tern, and that system has been so in-j
citing that many state banks have been ?
glad to get In it. It Is not tHut the pull i
ol' government ownership were to he J
placed over our transportation service.'
The plan would largely repress the pop- ;
tilar disposition to bait the roads and to 1
be everlastingly calling for reduced ?
rates, and on the other hand It would j
he a check on the exploitation of the j
railroads for mere personal profit and!
on the evil of over-capitaltxatJon.
These arc the claims of those who
favor this idea, which Is.litre set forth'
in the rough, and in which it applies- I
lion would require many safeguards I
against excessive government control
and to a sr<>at seal in carrying out per- j
sor.nl purposes. Jt would seem also to
be is nearly freo from tlie evils of po
litical control as anything can be in
which the government has a large func
tion.
questions as to the disposal of the
railroads after peace has been declared
arc perhaps more prominent In the j
minds of thoughtful people than any:
other commercial problem.

he would keep In close touch with all

know nil that I do." He appealed for
the ene.:.urasrement and added strength
of united support from Congress.

only reference to It in the House was

nois. the Republican leader, after the
President had delivered his annual ad
dress at the joint session In the House
cha mbcr.
"I am, not objecting to the President
going abroad." said the Kepublcan leader t
"hut I think some wise gentleman on the I
majority side of the House ought to be
able to inform congress what course is
to be pursued when matters come before
us. Is there any way by which we may
make into law anything put through
congress before the president returns?", j

WAS!flN'OTON", Dee. 2.?Aside from
his tribute to the American soldiers and
rs in the war. there was no praise
todav f- r tite president's message on the
Republican side of congress. Republi
can leaders felt that the President, bad
ivt justified his attendance at the peace
conference, nor had he done anything to
allay the resentment against ills having]
Ignored the senate in the selection of the i
peace delegates.
- P' morratio senators who consented to !
interviews for publication praised the'
messa go.
"It was an occasion of no eon sentience I
said Senator N'ew. Republican, of Indl-J
ana. when asked for his impression of i
the message.
"The message was not revealing, so I
far as ponce terms are concerned" s.ald j
Senator Harding. Republican, of Ohio, j
"but one is not to expect the spokesma/i '
f,.r the western hemisphere to reveal his j
hand in advance. The message lacked
the coeksttreness of many previous utr
t era noes. It was a fine tribute to the ;
soldiers, .and sailors of the republic and
the country's patriotic support of the
war."
Senator Martin. Pemoorat.ie leader;
Senator lodge. Republican lender: Sena
tor Hitchcock, chairman of the foreign
r> bit inns committee, all refrained from
making statements. Some senators did >
comment and there wore numerous
statements on the House side.? .
Representative Kltrhin, of Forth Car
rdinn. Homocratio leader, said: "The j
President's message was a great address, i
and his explanation about liis trip ought j
to satisfy his critics."
Representative Mann, of Illinois. Re
publican leader: "The most important
phase r.f the message was on railroads,
about which h gave no recommenda
tions. N'e\; in importance was the en
tire faijure to take the congress or the!
country into his confidence on his trip]
abroad to the peace .conference."
Speaker Clark: "It was a fine speech."
Representative Longworth, of Ohio,
Republican: "It is not the President's
/
strongest effort- It la Interesting to ob
serve that Congress Is going to be per
mitted to do some-thinking of Its own
on the railroad question." - -
Representative Kahn. of California.
Republican: "The President asks con
gross for Its united support. Congress
tvlll be much fairer I am afraid, in that
respect than the President himself has
been."
Senator "Walsh. of Montana. Demo
crat: "As usual the President presented
with remarkable clarity the outstanding
features of congressional consideration.
I am one of those who believe the Presi
dent is acting In accordance with duty
in attending the peace conference."
Senator P.ced. of Missouri. Democrat:
"There were many admirable things In
the message. Hut I utterly disagree
with the President that the American
hoys were fighting to maintain his four
teen .principles of peace. They were
fighting to lick the Germans, and the
fourteen principles, in fact, were uot
announced until long after we were in
the war. Also. I think there is no ne
cessity or call for the President's .per
sonal attendance at the peace confer
ence."
Senator Calder. -Republican, of New
York. said the President failed to con- j
vincc him in the message, "that his
going to Kurope was necessary."
Representative Gannon, of Illinois. Re.
publican: "I am pleased with the mes
sage. It followed the constitutional
plan'of giving to tho congTess informa
tion of the state of the union and'-left
the information with orders' for it to
consider in connection with Its legisla
tive duties."
Senator Johnson, Republican, of Cal
ifornia, said: "The1 deserved tribute to
our fighting men fround a sympathetic
echo with us a.ll. But the.remainder of
the President's address was Intensely
disappointing, The President leaves us
without an administrative program for .
reconstruction or definite American poll- A

people have the right to know botlL" ^
