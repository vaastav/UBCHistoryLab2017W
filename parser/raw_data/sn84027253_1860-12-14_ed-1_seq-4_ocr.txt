The President argues ably and conclusively
against the right of secession, but at the same
time destroys the force of his argument by
attributing the secession movement to "the
long-continued and intemperato interference
of the Northern people with the question of
slavery in the Southern States," (which is
false,) and aiso by denying the power of the
General Government to coerce a seceding
State into submission. The remedy he pro
poses an amendment to the Constitution
engrafting the Breckinridge platform upon
that instrument—is utterly impracticable
The North will never submit to the further
encroachments ot slavery.
In short, Old Buck has shown himself, in
his last message, to be the demagogue he has
long been regarded. We are glad that his
term of offiev is nearly at on end, and that,
for the next four years, a far-seeing, liberal
minded statesman will take his place. The
"Old Pub. Func." has made a complete botch
at administering the Government. Let us
rejoice that, hereafter, his diatribes will not
encumber the public documents, but will
appear through their appropriate channel
the New York Ledger.
Muscatine.
The Dubuque Herald, in the course of
little sparring with the Davenport Gautte,
publishes the following:
GAKBUSO.—The Davenport Gazette very
unfairly, we think, publishes a portion of a
late article of ours on Dubuque, thereby pro
ducing a very unfavorable impression and a
result totally different from the facts. Does
the Gazette believe that lying about one city
will build up another? If so, our neighbor
has all the mendacity but none of the logic
which we have ascribed to him. There is
room enough on the Mississippi for both Du
buque and Davenport—neither is in the
other s
way hence, we are at a loss to perceive the
force of this persistent misrepresentation in
dulged in by Davenport papers in reference
to Dubuque." Dubuque has
no rivalry towards
Davenport—we are a tub standing on our
own bottom and, were Davenport to grow
to fifty times its present dimensions, it would
not affect us a particle. Wo have our North
ern and ioterior trade—we have, better than
all, our lead mines, and none of these can, by
any amount of garbling, falsification and
blowing, ever fall to Davenport.
Davenport hat a rival and a formidable one.
It is one that, if it can be crushed by news
paper articles, should be wiped out as speedily
as possible. It is now packing ten hogs to
Davenport one—the same in beef its grain
receipts are overrunning those of the Bridge
City, it sells more lumber, it suffered less
during the panic, and is now walking towards
Davenport with a step that will overhaul the
latter and pass it within ten years. Situatsd
at the extreme west end of the great b«nd of
the Mississippi, it has treble the back country
dependent upon it that Davenport has, it has
good railroad communications, and is already
leaping ahead on the track of Progress like a
young athlete. We refer to Muscatine.
We have no quarrel with Davenport and,
if Davenport thinks a newspaper war of any
account, let her walk into Muscatine. There's
need of it—none here. We are not in the
least jealous of any river city if we were,
we should certainly be—not of Davenport—
but of Muscatine.
This is sensible and truthful language. We
have the fullest confidence that, in less than
ten years, Muscatine will be far in advance of
any other city in Central or Southern Iowa.
She is now the fourth city in the State in
point of population, and transacts more busi
ness than some boasting of a greater number
of inhabitants. The future of Muscatine is
full of promise—our position on the river,
and our railroads, when all completed, will
give us command of an extent of trade pos
sessed by no other city in the State.
Hon. Schuyler Colfax, of Indiana, is
prominently mentioned as Postmaster Gen
eral under'Lincoln. Mr. Colfax, unlike
many public men, oan base his claim to
this important appointment as well upon his
ability and experience as upon the aignai
service rendered by him during the iast can*
vase. Never in the history of the country
has the Congressional Committee on Post
Offices and I'ost Roads received the assist
ance and co-operation of so able, efficient
and industrious a chairman rarely haj one
man contributed so much of personal effort
to &• Presidential contest. Mr. Colfax deliv
ered no loss than ninety-two speeches in
fayor of Lincoln's election, and in the
doubtful State of Indiana dirested the battle
to a successful issue. As Mr. Lincoln is
famed for his cocsideration of the "eternal
fitness of tt iogs," it is probable that the
thorough qualifications of Mr. Colfax will
ensure his elevation to the place of honor
and trust ac the head of the Post Office
Department.
':JK COMPLICATED QUESTION.—A very INTER
im case is on trial at Toronto, O. W.
A slave nr.m il John Anderson, of Howard
county, Missouri, the property of one
MoUonald, of Saline county, ran away from
his master, nnd while so doing a farmer
named Dijgs met him, who, after some par
ley, pursued him, and was stabbed by him
while endeavoring to effect a seizure.
Anderson then got away, went to Canada
and was arrested for the orime, a month or
two ago. The United States Government
press for his surrender under the Ashburton
Extradition treaty. The British Govern
ment is bound to give up murderers, but
not fugitive slaves. As Anderson comes
under both categories, the question is com
plicated. The deoision of the Court if
looked for with much anxiety. It is under
stood that the Canadian representatives of
both the American and English Governments
favor the return of Anderson.
w Muscatine gave the largest Breck
inridge vote of any county in the State—86
The next largest in numbers are Scott 79,
Clinton 69, Yan Buren 57, Dubuque 56,
Webster 51, Appanoose 43, Wapello 38,
Polk 37, Pottawattamie 31.
The counties polling the heaviest vote for
Bell are Davis 226, Desmoines 156, Lee

Linn 80, Henry 66, Fremont 66, Dubuque

Total vote in the State for Breckinride
1,030 for Bell 1,750. Thus these factions

Solomon Pangburn. of Rising Sun, lnd
is 135 years old. He was born in New
York when it was a town of five or six hua
dred inhabitants, in 1725.
Ebenezer Mower, of Worcester, Mass., was
initiated as a Mason in 1794, and has there
fore been a Mason nearly G7 years. He is
over one hundred years of age.
Patrick Bryson and his wife, aged about
94 years, died within two days of each oth

Algeria is now connected with France by
the electric cable laid down between that
colony, the Balearic Isles and Spain. The
laying of the eleetric cable between Mar
seilles and Algeirs is to be completed towards
the end of the present year.
Gov. Conway, of Arkansas, says nothing
about Federal relations in his message tc
the Legislature, or even alludes to the gene
ral government at all, He had exhausted
himself in his proclamation a month before,
that the Prince of Wales' visit was all a
contrived plan on the part of England to
win the affections of the North, and so break
up the Union.
Five persons were drowned by a train
being precipitated into Lehigh river, at
Beaver Creek Dam, on the 29th ult., by the
breaking of a rail. Their names were Mrs.
Farrow and sister, of Beaver Meadow, two
Misses Smith, of Mauch Chunk, and Robert
Nichols—the latter conductor of the train.
It was very remarkable that any of the pas
sengers were saved, as the water was twen
ty feet deep, and the cars suiik soon. It
was ooly through the exertions of the hands
on the train, who broke through the roof of
the car, that they were rescued.
BEEOHHB
ON
SECESSION. In his last
Thanksgiving sermon Beeoher illustrated
South Carolina secession thus '-I seceded
once myself from ray father's bonse. I
wouldn't say my catechism, and so wentacd
sat out doors but when night came on, and
I aw the people inside eating their snpper
and enjoying themselves, I was glad enongh
to return, say my catechism, and get my
supper. And South Carolina will soon get
enough of Secession, and be glad enongh to
come back and say her catechism, though
every article in it was Liberty."
The New Orleans Delta, talking of
Louisiana going out of the Union, says
"She will then stand erect in all the dignity
of reasserted indapendence, and all the glory
of recovered sovereignty." This, from
Louisiana, is tropically sweet. We bought
her from France, and paid Napoleon for her.

ELECTION STATISTICS
OF
IOWA.—In 1648
Iowa east 2 {,177 votes, of which Cass, for
President, received 12,093, and Taylor 1J ,084.
In 1852, the vote of the State was ij,253
S-jott rect ived 15,856 Pierce, 17,763 linle
1,604. Total vote in 1856, 89,304, of which
Wremont received, 43,9o4 Buchanan 00,170
Fillmore, 9,180. In 1857, the vote stood
58,135, veloping a decrease of 31,169 com
pared with the vote of the previous year.—
This state of affiirs is accounted for by the
general neglect of the voters to attend the
polls. In the contest for Governor in 1857
Lowe received 30,143 votes, Samuels, 27 992!
In the canvass of 1838, th:re were cast
for Secretary of State 94.823 votes, of which
Sells received 4:,OS5, and Douglass 45 748.
This shows a gain over the vote of 1850 of
5,520, and over 1857 of 36,698.
In 1859, the total vote was 109,715, of
which Kirkwood for Governor received 56
404, and Dodge 53,311.
This ytiir (I860) the popular vote of Iowa
reaches in round numbers 128,000, giving an
increase of 19,000 over the vote of last year.
It shows also a gain of 38,000 over the

fcF-Aneditorofa fancy turn of mind,
having remarked that "Washington guided
t!io totteri- steps of the infant Republic
along the path of Empire" a cotemporary
add*:
'So ho did. And more—he made the little
codger toe the traok of progress he onffed
him along the trail of safety he kicked him
clear over the pools of peril, and by the nape
of the neck he dragged him howling up the
hili of greatness." It will be seen that we
can talk in figures as well as .our neighbor.
GOOD.—There are many kinds of "good.'*
To the trading' community, any man who
can pay his debts is "good." A moral per
son is undoubtedly "good but then, a very
immoral one is often esteemed a "good fel
low." With commercial people goodness
consists in money with the "fancy" in
muscle. In short, everywhere, and with all
sort of folks, "good" expresses simply what
IS much liked or desired. A traveler on the
coast of Africa, writes that a native said to
—you got plenty of shirt 1"

brey, while the latter was arresting him
for a burglary committed a month since, was

statesmen as the Senator from New York,
Mr. Seward, will see the futility of this." He
concluded as follows: War is inevitable.
Let the South lake care. Let the war come
and we will tell the Senator from New Hamp
shire, and all the myrmidons of abolitionism,
in the language of the Honorable Represent
ative from Ohio, Mr, Corwin, in regard to ths
Mexican war, we will welcome them, *with
bloody hands, to hospitable graves.'" [Sen

were made in favor of the Union, ana generally

Mr. Botta opposed the right of secession, and

WINTER SCENI. The following verses,

pen of the old Lnglish poets say of the

Smith, author of the ''Rejeoted Addresses.*1
Every line is a picture:
The mill-wheel's frosen in the stream,
Tae ohuroh is deoked with holly
Mistletoe hangs from the kitchen beam,
To fright away melanoholy.
Icicles clink in the milkmaid's pail,
Younkers skate on the pool below
Blackbirds porch on the golden rail—
And hark, how the oold winds blow
There goes thdr squire, to shoot at snipe,
Here runs Dick to fetch a log [pipe,

In the frosty morning fog.

of winter books, tor reading, and tor presents
at CliriBtmas and New Year's. We will do
them a real kindness by indicating to them
where and how they can buy their books the
cheapest find best. Tiie book store of J. A.
Colby, 118 Randolph street, is one of the
institutions of this citK. There the visitors
will find a stock of books of every kind, un
equalled in extoi.f, completeness and ele

lively and severe ll^tory, Religion, liom-iuce
t'oetry, all find their place on theslu-lves

books are all sold a* low as they oan be

FOR
MARKET
Never kill a bird unless it is fat.
Never cut off the head of a turkey or
goose, but hang them by the heels
where they cannot bruise themselves in
the death struggle, and stick them with
a small knife and bleed them to death.
Ducks and common fowls, if decapita
ted, should be held or tied and hung up
to bleod to death. Never kill your
birds will full crops, you will lose more
than yon gain in weight. Never stran
gle them, so as to leave the blood in.
The best plan is to tie all kinds of birds
to a line drawn from post to post, or
tree to tree, and stick them just in the
forward end of the neck. .You may
pick all sorts of birds dry, if you don't
tear the skin, but you must scald them
afterwards by dipping them suddenly
in and out of boiling water. Don't
scald the legs too much, whether you
pick ffrst or afterwards. Be careful
of that. You must pick them clean,
and this after scalding makes them look
plump and good. Never draw a bird.
It is worth while to pay freight on in
testines, because meat cannot be kept
sweet long after they are drawn and
the air admitted inside of the body.
It is the practice of some of the best
poultryuien, after the birds are plucked,
to plunge them suddenly into boiling
water, and then immediately into cold
water. This gives them a clean,
plump appearancc, and makes them
look fat if they are in decently good
condition when killed. Nothing, how
ever, can make a poor bird look well,
while ill dressing will make tho best
bird look poor. Lay the birds upon
clean boards, in a cold room, till per
fectly cool, but not frozen as at all
times, but especially when there is a
probability of damp, close weather,
great care must be taken that the ani
mal heat is out of them and then pack
in boxes with clean rye and oat straw
so that they must not touch each other,
about three or four hundred pounds in
in a box filled full mark the contents
on a paper inside, and on the lid out
side, and direct it tu your commission
merchant plainly, and send it by ex
press, and the invoice by mail.
WEARING RULBKR SIIOES.—The ten
dency of India rubber shoes is to make
the feet cold, and in such proportion
endanger the health hence, they are
useful only in walking, when the ground
is muddy or slushy with melting snow'
in these cases they are invaluable, and
there is no equal substitute. Two
rules should be observed, whenever it is
possible when rubbers ore on the feet,
persons should keep moving, and re
move them on entering the house, if it
is intended to remain over a few
minutes. If the rubbers have.been on
the feet several hours, both shoes and
stockings are necessarily damp by the
condensation and confinement of the
perspiration, therefore all shall be re
moved, and the naked foot held to the
fire until warm and dry in every part
if then a pair of dry stockings are put
on and a pair of waim and loose slip
pers, or shoes, there will be a feeling
of comfort for the remainder of the
day, which will more than compensate
fo the trouble taken, to say nothing of
the ailments averted. Bat it must not
be forgotten that as India rubber shoes
are impervious to water from without,
and ought to be worn in muddy weath
er, and only then while the wearer is in
motion, so leather shoes, rendered im
pervious to water, by biacking or by
any other means, should be like India
rubber, used temporarily, and when
walking in mud or slush. For common
puiposes, the old fashioned leather
boots and shors are the best, if kept
well blackened, with several renewals
of dry socks during the day, if tho feet
perspire profusely. As cold and damp
feet are the avenues of death to multi
tudes every year, a systematic atten
tion to the above suggestions would
save many a valuable life.—Hall's

U. W. Conner was elected by one vote over S. M.

who were not resident tax payers on the Island, as
required by law. The controversy is to be settled
on the 24th inut., before a board of commissionera
appointed for that purpose.
