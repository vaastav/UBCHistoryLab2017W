THE WASHINGTON TIMES

A Credit o Wnshlnntnu
Vitli the eyes of the lresident of
Hie United States nml a large share
of tlie people of Washington upon
them tlie oliccincn ami firemen of
tlie Capital yesterday passed in an
nual review
They made a brave showing livery
inch of uniform and every piece of
apparatus demonstrated that the ut
most care had been taken The pro
cession was attractively arranged and
the marching- of a high order
Owing to the hazard of their occu
pations and the fidelity of their ser
vice the blu coats and the lire fight
ers deserve much of tlie people Kver
ready to risk their lives as a matter
of duty they stand out conspicuously
as an element In the public employ
whose ollicc cannot be dismissed
from consideration after the payment
of a stated salary
Everything should be done to make
them comfortable The departments
should have a snflicient number of
men to permit a reasonable division
of labor aE well as to make them
most effective The police guardians
especially need more help and have
needed it for a long time Many of
the men arc compelled through lack
of numbers on the force to do more
patrol work than they should be
called upon to jn rform
lloth ii the service and out the ser
vants of the community who guard it
against crime and fire deserve the
highest rewards that the people can
bestow
Cntiftp for Alnrm
lnglish shipowners arc frightened
The American ship subsidy bill wor
ries them In fact they wish it to be
understood that they are boldly op
posed to the measure
It is significant that our over water
kinsmen should become aroused liy
Senator Fryes proposition It is pre
of our friends that is just what is in
tended
The American flag has been too
scarce on the sea to suit the Ameri
can people There is plenty of Artier-
students to go on as far as they cm
Hundreds of bright young men and
women capable of doing work in
science historv or literature which
would be of real benefit to the coun
try in one way or another are de
barred from doing so through lack
of money They must earn their tui
tion before thev can take the ad
vanced course which thev need and
meantime their vouth s lips away and
the woik which they might do is lost
because thev must spend their time
in routine labor Mr Carnegies gift
will fin something to icim il this con
dition
llepresentntive Wilson of llrooklvu
wants to have a surgeon on dutv at
the Hou e and if his plan goes
through there are some country mem
bers just economical enough to tum
ble down stairs and bump their heads
for the sake of getting treatment
free
Mr Croker is said to have a double
somewhere in the West That double
chose an unprofitable time to develop
the resemblance
A moonshine plant has been discov
ered in Xcvv York and what with for
est tires and floods and reform tlie
atmosphere of that town is likely to
become trulv rural
The fiat has gone fortli that Am
herst students are not to take
drives with Smith College girls
unless there is a betrothal which in
dicates that the Northampton jewel
ers will do a good and sudden busi
ness in engagement rings
There seems to be a sort of puss
game going on in
regard to committee rooms up at the
Capitol but this does not mean that
there is any kitty business mixed
up in it
liminary proof that the measure will The hide-and-seek campaign in
bring about the restoration of the South Africa continues And glimpses
American merchant marine Hut of General Lord Kitcheners coat tails
f
villi all due respect for the feelings i may be obtained at ficipicnt intervals
as he rounds the kopjes at his best
speed in the vigorous search for Ooi
Pauls representatives
If Congress succeeds in doing about
ican business for new ships owned by of what has been
the sons of Uncle Sam Of course it
will crowd out foreign tonnage but
that is one of the fortunes of com
mercial competition International
trade nowadays is not operated on
the charity organization plan
A merchant marine will be another
link in the lengthening chain of
American prosperity llesides it will
furnish a nucleus for an auxiliary
jiavy in the event of serious misun
derstanding witli another Iovver It
will give the nation its proper place
in salt -water traffic and it will be as
gratifying to our spirit of enterprise
as it is distasteful to our rivals who
will doubtless regard it as another
phase of the hateful American in
vasion
IltOluic Willi PI re
Tlie inference to be drawn from tlie
silence of the lliilgarian brigands Is
that they are not running a bargain
counter in ransoms It is unfortu
nate that their impudent demand can
not be answered with cold lead but
for decencys sake and the safety of
the unfortunate missionary they
must of coiir c be conciliated and
satisfied
If Bulgaria doesnt take a hitch in
its moraK however and pay Mime at
tention to the safety of foreigners
that country will get into a severe
mix up one of these days and there
will be plenty of ammunition back of
the fireworks
Modern Aitterlcnn Hdupnflon
In setting aside ten million dollars
for the cause of education and sjiecl
fying as he has that it is to further
original investigation by men who
might not otherwise be able to en
gage in it Mr Andrew Carnegie has
shown the good judgment winch has
characterized him during most of his
life
Tlie problem of education is per
haps a more serious one here in
America tlian most Americans real
ize It is too often forgotten that
the great majority of the people of
tliis country numerically speaking
ore educating their children much bet
ter than they themselves were edu
cated Of course this is not true ot
tlie more intelligent classes who for
the most part inspire and control na
tional thought but it is true of the
people as a whole Tlie consequence
of this is that in many of our cities
and towns educational affairs are in
the hands of men who arc not in tlie
strict sense of the word educated
and this is a condition of things which
does not exist in any other country
in tlie world
In some vajs it is not a bad con
dition Tlie ambition of young people
is stimulated by the feeling that their
fathers and mothers expect much of
them and they are not immediately
discouraged by coming in contact
with those who have reached heights
which they can never hope to attain
It is probable that the average Ameri
can reaches a higher level of culti
lation than lie would if not encour
aged by the hope often false that
lie may if he chooses become a highly
educated man 1erhaps it is better
to aim at the hundred mark and
trikc fifty than to aim only at twenty-five
and strike that- leoplc who
get impatient with the crudeness of
eciui cdiication will do well to consid
er this
What we seem to need is not col
lege or academic education for llic
man but thorough training in the
elements of culture for everyone
and a chunee for unusually intcliig nt
mapped out for it by ambitious arehi
teets of legislation there will be
enough new laws to keep the coun
try going for some time
Mr Croker has forfeited his title
of Hichard the Silent The Sphinx
may now gloat over its laurels with
out fear of competition

CARNEGIES COLLEGE DONATION
Perplex I nir Problem Connected
With the 100M0 Offer
Prcsldeut Roosevelt has a white ele
phant on his hands la the form of Andrew
Carnegies letter offering to give to the
United States Government as trustee of
the American people 10000000 for the
establishment in Washington of a college
of higher education the nucleus to be the
various Government scientific bureaus
Thc Presidents embarrassment arises
from thc fact that Mr Carnegie did not
put up the cash but Instead makes an of
fer to deposit 10000000 In bonds of the
United States Steel Company Of course
the bonds today are as good or better
than cash but the United States Govern
ment is doing business strictly on a cash
basis
The Government had one experience In
taking bonds at the timo James Smtthson
made his bequest for the establishment
of the Smithsonian Institution The money
contained In this donation was invetted
In Arkansas bonds of which the bottom
afterward dropped out compelling Con
gress to make an appropriation to cover
the deficit If President KooscvcU had
known that Mr Carnegie had made a pro
posal of bonds Instead ot cash he would
not have allowed tho matter to become
public and Indeed It was his Intention
to keep the whole subject a profound
secret until he could make thc offer
known to Congress in a special message
But the President ot the United States
li always at the mercy of his more or
less discreet friends and In this Instance
he has been made their victim
One of his warm personal friends who
has his official ear whenever he wants It
learned from the head of a Western col
lege what was In the wind and tuld the
story to a newspaper man who printed It
Now the President does not know what
course to pursue He does not conceal
his annoyance over thc matter becoming
public end during thc past few days has
been in consultation with some of tho
shrewdest men In both houses of Con
gress particularly thoc In charge of fis
cal affairs All of them have advised him
not to touch the bonds not only because
ot the possibility that they might some
day depreciate In value but becauje of the
political club that would be put in the
hands of the Democratic party If the Re
publican Congress should on the recom
mendation of the Republican President
become as trustees for the Amcricaa peo
ple tie holder of the bonds of vhat is
popularly Jf unwarrantably described as
the greatest trust of all the trusts on
earth
President Roosevelt admits the force of
the argument as thus presented to him
and It Is safe to say that Mr Carnegies
letter will not be submitted to Congress
with the Presidents recommendation un
less it shall be very materially changed in
substance
The generous offer of Jlr Carnegie is
very deeply appreciated by the President
and his friends in ana oui oi ousres
but they all appreciate as well that some
way out of the dilemma musi oe rouna
l
One of the prominent Congressmen who
I called upon the President yesterday at his
request to consult witn mm on mis mat
ter advised that a mutual friend be sent
to Mr Carnegie with a request to with
draw his letter as thc only solution of the
problem
If this action Is taken it Is probable
that a hint will be dropped that If the of
fer should be renewed on a cash basis It
would be accepted with thanks
