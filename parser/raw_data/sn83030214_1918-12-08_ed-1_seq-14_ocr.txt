Seventy-six Men, Unable to
Find Rooiiis. Sleep on the
Floor of Y. M. C. A. Hotel
?Hungry Sightseers Fed
PAR1S, Nov. 29.?Probably the big
gest problem that the Young Men'a
Christian Association has to face in
the city of Paris is the housing of
soldiers who fiock to this city in thou
sands for twenty-four to forty-eight
hours leavc. Every American boy who
comes to France is cager to sec the city
of Paris, and the prices of accommo
daticns at the French hotels is beyond
the possibilities of thcir slender
nirscs. The Y. M. C. A. has several
otels where they can go and for one
franc a night can get a bcd and a
ahower. Mt;>is are served at cost.
The Pavillon ;s the ;argest of these
hotels, and as an illustration the crowd
that flockcd in there the other night
is a gccd one to be guided by. The
hotel was full to overflowing. The
other hotels in the neighborhoed ohj
the overflow list were also crowded to
the limit. The .office also has a long
list of rooms which French families
will rent to soldiers. The list was ex
hausted. Yet the men kept pouring in.
Seventy-six men took ?ff their coats,
xolled them up, made t'nem into pillows
and slept on the floor of the "lounge
rnoin." At 11 all lights were out,
At 11:30 p. m. Miss Elizabeth Gil
roan, of Baltimore. Md.. who has charge
of the canteen service at the Pavillion,
thought she would call it a day's work
wnd "go to bcd. But just as she was
*tarting upstairs, she hcard a pounding
on the door and went to see what it
xvas. ?
She opened the door. to find thirty
four enlisted men who had travelled
nghteen hours on a railroad train.
They wanted cover for the night, and
''for the love of Uncle Sam, sister, food
of some sort." She let them in, went j
upstairs and called- another canteen !
worker. Together they went into the
kitchen and stole the bread that was
hidden in the closets for morning. They
found a key to the storeroom and
dragged out canned meat to make into
tandwiches. They s?arted a fire in the
-tove and made hot chocolate. and the J
thirty-four boys were fed.
Then the two women went into the I
riining room with the tables all set and !
ready for breakfast. and cleared away !
those tables and thc men were only
too glad to roll up on them and on the
floor and sleep the sleep that only
tired, war-weary soldiers can sleep.
This is a situation that the Y. M.
C. A. meets from day to day, in spite
?f the fact that it is renting every
Bvailablo cavant hotel in the city.

Chewinjr Guni in War
Of all the varied means of mastica
tory stimulation which have been re
sorted to by man in all climes and agea
the great American gum seems least
harmful and most helpful. That there
ii a physiological demand for some
;masticatory stimulant is shown by the
Uiliversality of the nractice of c'newing. ?
Vhether it be the tobacco of the Ameri?
can Indian. the betel nut of the East.
tHe cocoa leaves of South America, the
tlipperv elm bark, the tamarack and
the spruce gum of the Down East
Yankee. the sweet gum of the Gulf
etatea, the chicle of the Mexicans, which
jn its American adaptation becomes the
great American chewing gum. man has
alwaya felt the necessity of chewing
something more than hi? meals. That
tiiere is a practically useful side for
this habit is eyidenced by the orders
rlaced bv the quartermaster of the
Inited States army for 2.300.000 nack
Bges of this standard American dainty.
We learn from the War Department
that the commandiry? officer of a tield
urtillery regiment, about to embark,
rtated that 250 pounds of chewing
grum would take the place of hun
rireds of gallons of drinking water
Tvhen water was most needed and least.

Nearing Predicta Wilson'a
Def cat at Peace Tablc
Sorialist Lecturer Deelares the
President Lacks Apprcoia
tion of World's Needs
Speaking beforo an audience of 300
Socialists and radicals at the Peoplc's
House yesterday, Scott Nearing, So
cialist lecturer, declarcd that a careful
analysis off President Wilson's latest
message to Congress discloscd the fnct
that the Presidont had no real appre
ciation of the domestic reconatruction
problem and that he lacked the united
support of the country in his mission
to the peace conferencc.
Dr. Nearing said the Fresident's
latest address was the most disap
pointing o fall his mcssages, aacribing
this to "his inaccessibility for the last
eighteen months." He said the Presi
dent had been surrounded by a "small
coterie of Southern politicians, who
had kcpt from him all knowledge of the
8entiment of the people and what was
taking placc in the country. He said
the peraonnel of the mission was not
representative, that none of the mis?
sion had been elected by the American
people and that it rcprescnted neither
the "plutocratic classes" nor the people.
"If the American people are repub
lican, who is Mr. Wilson to atand in
their way?" he asked. "If they want a
republican delegation. that's their busi
ness. It would have been better to
have Wilson go with four representa?
tive Republicans than with Democrats
who are not representative."
Nearing expressed thc opinion that
President Wilson's influence at the
peace table would be negligible and in
scjgnificant. "If he goes to France un
der the impression that the Allies have
accepted his fourteen principles," said
Nearing, "his entire argument will be
based on a fallacious premise, for only
recently Winston Churchill declarcd
that England was prepared to fight for
her rights on the sea. I believe that
President Wilson is going up against a
Chinese Wall of diplomatic exclusion."

A Super Physique
Europe not only discovers in our
armies in France the existence of the
American type, but notcs that the
American physique is superior to any
of her own. Their mouths exhibit the
beneiit of American dtntistry, and what
good tceth mean to health is .just com
ing to bc underatood. Americans are
I the only soldiers except the British who
really are accustomed to thc bath, and
| what frcquent ablution means to health
1 medical science now appreciatea. But
1 the essential reason for the superiority
of American physique is to be found
in the plentitulness of food in the
United States. The excellence of Cana
dian physique proceeds from a like con
dition, as does that of Australian. Our
people just now are generously re
straining their appetites?incidentally
to the betterment of their health --and
some of them are complaining of high
prices. But, save for those of us who
are recent immigrants, we do not, real
ize that what we waste the French and
, Italians live upon. Europe in our time
never has had enough to eat. Froude
declared that in the reign of Henry
VIII every English family had beef
every day. Even if auch were the case,
never since then has every English
family had beef onco a week. And P]ng
land has long been better fed than the
continent of Europe ever waa. Before
the war wa Americans fancied that we
had our troubles, but they were mainly
in our minds. This United States in
in fact has always been the reality of
ihe fabulous Elysium. l]^ro has been
more to eat and better distribution of
supplies than anywhere or at any time
in Europe. Here are better care for the
body, more comfort, more conveniences,
more ingenius mechanical appliances
devoted to niaking ordinary living
; easier. There is not, perfection her-.
Error still proves us human and v/ron;;s
! still ahow us sinful; but we are farthcr
[ along the roact to fclicity than any soci
) ety in any period of civilization. And
! the average American is a better ani
I ma.l, a better intelligcnce and, no doubt,
| a better moral person than the average.
; He has a better endowment, a better
j chance, a better living, a longer life.?

j SYDNEY, Australia, Nov. - (Cor
j respondence of The Associated Press).
j ?When the French misBion, hcadcd
: by Gencral Paul Pau, which is now
r touting Australia, returns homc it will
urge the governmcnt to appoint trade
commissioners to improve the commer
, cial relationa between France and Aus
j tralia. Dr. Siegfried and M. Mo-tte,
| membern of the mission, have been
j very actively engaged in Sydney and
Melbourne in conferring with commer
cial interests and governmental de
partments with this end in view. Ad
dressing the Commercial Travellers'
Association in Sydney early in Octo
ber, Mr. Motte said that the Gerrnans
had robbcd Northern France of $100,
000,000 worth of wool and woollen
gdods, machinery, leuther, copper and
other things, and he added: "It will
take us some time to reorganize, and
we want support in order to enable us
to rebui'.d trade before Germany can
find her nlaee again."
Subsequently, at a dinner given to
thc mission by tho Cornmonwealth gov
crnment in Parliament House, ??IoI
bourne, the actiiifr Prime Minister,
i William A. Watt, said: "For four y^ars
prior to thc war Australia imported
from France a yearly average of $10,
000,000 worth of goods; while wc say
it with shame during tlie same period
our vearly average with Germany was
?32,000,000. Now we have learned that
it is better to do business with civil
ized and friendly people. If Australia
can by the efforts of *he govern and
Parliament nut France in the position
that Germany formerly was in the gov?
ernmcnt and Parliament will do so
with pleasure. We recognize that
France deserves consideratton among
all the Allies,"
Lille, Rouhaix and Tourooing before
the war were the chief French manu
i facturing ct-ntres. German invasion
j and occupation ruined them, plundcr
I and destruction being the enemy's pol

has been for some time preparing for
the reoccupation of the wool districts,
and it is expected that now the fac
tories will be speedily rebuilt, and the
large consignments of American ma?
chinery will be installed.

Tea wagons deliver your meals. and
the food itself is all home cooked.
The home made pies, cakes, marma
lade and jams have made many reg
ular customers, who, having once
tried the delicacies of Ye Olde Eng
lish CotTee House, have heralded
them among their friends. The es
tablishment is on the lines of the
better type of American home din
