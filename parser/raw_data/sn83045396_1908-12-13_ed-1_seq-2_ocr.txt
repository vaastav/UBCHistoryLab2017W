r 2 ; THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE, SUNDAY MORNING-, DECEMBER 13, 1908. ffrtj
Ii
l occlusive publication in The Tribuno
yesterday of the "find" by Mr. Price
' caused considerable excitement, and it
J the owner is ever found it is believed
Vi that it will bo through the agency ol
V the pross rather than by anything the
1 postoffleo department nan do. There i
mo way to trace 'the paper, as the wrap-
' per bore no postmark, and although Mr.
V Lowe i3 doing everything in his power
,:J tho wheels seem to be ologgod and ap
'j pear to bo at a standstill.
Prom present indications the money
' is the proporty of Mr. Price to do with
1 ; us he soes fit. The government can lay
i , no claim to it, no matter whether an
owner is found or not. and unless somo
body can prove his right to the money
Mr. Price will continue to act as its
, i guard inn. Ho now Jias it on deposit in
I an.Ogden bank.
Postmaster Thomas refused to ciis
ji' cuss tho matter yesterday, but it is
known that an effort has been mado by
V Inspector Lowe to trace tho paper with
t ? out success. Jle has only faint, hopes
K of. ever carryiug the matter to a suc
jV ccsaful climax, ,
I;. LJ" UNABLE TO SOLVE MYSTERY
N OP THE PACKAGE OF MONEY,
tf Special to Tho Tribune.
V OGDEN. Dec. 12, No' real solution of
I ; tho mystery surrounding tho mysterious
pnekage containing $2-110 in bank notes
i which was received at tho Five Points
. li postollico Friday 'afternoon by Charles
H Price, living at 192 Second street, has
r? been reached by tho postal authorities
J4 who are investigating the caso.
')( When Mr. Price was seen at his homo ,
ho appeared not to be rho least con
' corned over tho small fortune- which
K may fall to him. IIo refers to the wad
M of money received by him in the news-
t -paper in tho most matter of fact way.
lsOf course tho money was not meant
J for me," ho declared, "but I suppose
it will bo mtno if nobody else comes!
n forward with a claim to it. When I
saw the money in the newspapor as I
i ', tore off the wrapper I was so completely
surprised that for a minute I could not
say anything.. Then I told tho boys
1 standing around that they could not
fool me with their jokes, I soon re-.
y alized that they were as ignorant as I
about tho money, and then I was con
vinced that it was bogus. I finally de
'l cided to como to tho city and seo Mr,
i.'j Piugree at tho Pingree National bank,
. with whom I do business. Mr. Pingree
told me the bills were real and I left
tho wholo amount on deposit there un
til the matter is settled. When. I tore
j. opon the- package and saw the news
paper was a Dcserot News I couldn t
undorstaud. as I am not a subscriber.
I "thought the paper was a San Fran
cisco Examiner before 1 opened it, as
N ' I take that paper. I was on the point
of throwing it into tho coal scuttle when
, ( something told mo to open it and the
J ' money fell our. I don't know of any
'I other' Charles Prico living hero."
' Postmaster Albert Shaw at Five
li Points was equally surprised at the
I- largo amount of eurrencj' which fell
' K from the folds of the paper. ''The
paper, came out with the regular after-
'i noon mail for tho Fivo Points office
' from Ogden," he said. "I had dis
tributed all the sack when Mr. Price
' came up and I handed him his paper
without any idea of tho big surprise
which would follow the opening ol- the
. jj package. The wrapper bore no letter
ing except the simple address, and thorc
j was .no postofiice stamp or date to tell
' from whore it was posted. 1 reported
the mutter to the postal authorities just
as soon 'as I recovered from my sur
V ' prise." '
Charlos Price,, the, probable bone-
ficiary'of tho mysterious package, is. a
pla3torcr and carpenter,. He has a wife
! ' ' and" several small children and is 50
1 ' years of age,
, , " Two secret service men from the
. postal department are in the city and
' , ' are at work on the case. Both. the post-
14 S office at Five Points and in the city arc
. being kept under close surveillance.
J t .'Many theories have been advanced
"v concerning the posting of the valuable
'vi package. One. theory which is coll
ie Bidcred probable is tliat-the money may
be a portion of loot taken by train rob
k j bcra and mailed in this unusual niaii-
FiJ ner when tho thief found that he was
jj liable to be detected.

m time thev remedied tho matter at the
m Xuutsford, tho instruments were allowed
' to romain, to the sorrow of the com-
. lit puny. They will now be replaced with
the "wall phones;
j' Tho man is described as being about
: fe-j the same ago as the woman, a little over
, tfc medium height, dnrk, and wearing a
tS long black overcoat and black derby.
1! It- is supposed that as soon as ho had
w removed tho telephone ea&h box he
, ift slipped it under his coat, despite the
.If- fact .that they arc vary heavy, and as-
rjjM suming to place his hand in his over-
nl .coat pocket, carried the prize away as
va easily as one could a bundle. Tho
vSw "boxes happen to bo fitted with a steel
, handle, and this made it vastly easier
' f5 to carry the box than othorwiso would
jl have been the cat-e. The boxes taken
are supposed to have contained in nick-
?n els, dimes and quarters in tho noigh-
i "borhood of $30 each.
U From tips which had been received
here, it is believed this is the fcamo
if- pair which has been operating in Spo
m kanc, Seattle. Portland, San Francisco,
In Sacramento and .Denver. A few days
)kj ago Detective Leonard Do Lue of Dcn-
vh vcr was in this .city, and although it
IjU was said by him that he was merely
Pi k liere on a vacation, it was believed at
I Jn tho time that he was in quest of some-
( V body. This is low considered certain,
im ' as it has become known that ho was
jl looking for tho couple who had been
I '? touching tlje telephone company in
- Denver and the hotels as well. ' '

TO CHANGE RULES

ton of Alabama; Hughes, Now Jorsoy,
and Do Armond, Missouri.
In tho opinion of Mr. Henry it was
going too far "to tako a circuitous
route and confer on aliens rights which
havo not been conferred on them b3'
tho constitution." Tho bill was loo
radical, ho said.
Alien Has a Bemody.
Mr. Clayton Kaid thero was not an
alien' in tno country who had not al
readv a romed3' in caso ho is injured
or threatened. Mr. Sherloy took issue
with Mr. Henry, and said thoro was
no law granting tho aliens rights su
perior to citizons.
After further discussion tho bill was
passed. 100 to 99. The voto was so
closo that the speaker ordered a re
capitulation at tho suggestion of Mr.
Henry, Texas. This disclosed that tho
voto actually stood 100 to 100. Tho tio
was broken by the voto of the speaker
in the affirmative, which' again passed
the bill.'
Mr. Do Armond challenged tho speak
er's vote on the ground that ho had no
right to cast it after tho voto had been
closed. Ho contended that tho only
duty of tho speaker in such a caso
was to announco tho rostilt of tho re
capitulation. In an claboralo decision, supported by
precedents which ho read, tho speaker
held that ho had the absolute right to
vote, and ho declared that his voto
would stand.
From tho spcakor's decision Mr. Do
Armond appealed, but in tho mcnutimo
Mr. Jenkins movod to ad.iourn. On that
proposition a roll call was forced, reso
lution aj-eB 99; nays, 95 j and the house
accordingly at 5:27 adjourned.
HARD TO FORECAST
WHAT SENATE WILL DO
WASHINGTON. Doc. 12 Tho action
to be taken by tho Senate in nsserting
its displeasure becauso of President
Roosevelt's messngo in regard to the
secret service, has "not been outlined
with any defiuitcness. It has been un
derstood that a resolution would bo of-
fercd by somo Democratic Sonator pro
viding ior an investigation by the coin- (
mittco on appropriaions of tho. prcsi ;
dent's language. It was argued that I
as a Republican introduced a rcsolu- I
tion in the House, tho selection of a I
Democrat for tho same purposo in the
Senate would give a nonpartisan flavor
to the course being pursued.
Conferences today developed .that a
number of" lenders believe the action
should be taken br a Republican, and
it was suggested that Senator' Burrows
would be tho proper person to offer tho
resolution. Senator Burrows has not
yet consented to do so. It is likely
that tho resolution will be tho same as
that of the House, providing for the
appointment of a select committco of
fhfo to consider the wholo subject.
It is evident that tho House does not
intend to take any hnsty action in re
buking tho president for'the statements
in his message regarding the civil
service action of the Congress. Tho com
mittee appointed yesterday, of which
Mr. Perkins of Now York is chairman,
did not meet today, but is expected to
cqme together on Monday. The under
standing is, however, that no report
will be made until the latter part of
the week. The members of tho select
committee are determined to present
their recommendations boforo adjourn
ment before the Christmas holiday.
CUBA WILL FIGHT
FREE LIST FOR SUGAR
HAVANA. Dec. 12. An action of
tho ways and means committee of tho
United States congress looking to tho
placing of 300,000 tons of Filipino su
gar on the free list, would bo regarded
with gravo apprehension by Cubans
identified with the sugar industry. Tho
Lucha abjures Cuban politicians to
unito with the planters in their efforts
to secure concessions so that continued
Cuban competition in tho mnrkets of
tho United States muy bo possible.
Tho Discussion says that this meas
ure would only bo a preliminary stop
toward freo trade, which would ulti
mately result in tho extinction of Cuba
as a "figure in tho sugar supply "of tho
United States.
Decisive Test Vote.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. What was
practically a test voto on the bill pro
viding for the arbitrary investigation
of differences between employers and
employes in labor disputes wus'laken in
tho house today, when Mr. Tpwnscnd
of Michigan sought to bring it up for
further consideration. Tho opponents of
tho measure rallied their forces and
tho house by a voto of 102 to 11 re
fused to take up the measure.

"There are no important European

"Even Japan is laying hor plans for

will give her an entrance to that mighty

ECHO OF THE DAYNES
JEWELRY ROBBERY
Man Known as Doc Cameron Ar
rested in Little Rock by
Police.
In a special telegraphic dispatch rc
coived by Tho Tribuno from Littlo Rock,
Ark., Saturday Gvcning information
was givon of tho arrest of Doc. Cam
eron, a criminal who- baa been hounded
from coast to coast and who was sup
posed to havo boon implicated in tho
robbery of tho Jahn DayncB & Sons'
,1'oweJry Btoro at 26 Main street on tho
night of April 20, 1907, when nearly
$12,000 worth of loot was stolon.
Although tho Littlo Rock police aro
attempting to make Cameron confess
to having been implicated in the rob
bcrv in this city, they havo mot with
littlo success and notwithstanding tho
fact that the man is under arrest it is
doubtful if tho local police, who think
Cameron received some of tho goods,
will mako any movo to havo him
brought here, an lack of evidence would
fail of conviction.
Camoron was taken into custody
while creating a disturbance on a stroot
car to distract attention from a partner
who was attompting to pick pickets.
IIo gavo his namo to tho polico as J.
H. Franklin.
Following thooDayncs robbery three
men wero arrested m Denver attempt
ing to pawn goods which wero stolen
from tho local store. Captain J. 13.
Burbidge of tho police, now a deputy
sheriff, went to Donvor to get tho men,
Thero ho learned that Harry Monroe,
alias Harry Roberts, alias John Evans,
who was thought to havo been tho ono
to blow the 8alot was in Reno, Iov. Ho
telegraphed polico hcadquartoro hero
and they sent Lieutenant R. L. Shan
non to Rono. Lieutenant Shannon had
Monroo in custody and while on tho
way to iail with him Monroo broko
away and made a successful escape.
Tho three mon arrested in Denver,
Edward Phillips, F. McFarland and
Edward Jennings, -were brought back
to this city and although an effort was
mado to ''stick" thorn for the robbory
th 03' all put up a story that thc3' had
purchased tho goods from Monroe. Tho3'
wero tried for receiving stolen property
and after ecveral months passed in .iail
tho cases against them wero dismissed.
Tho property obtained by tho capture
of tho thrco'was of the cheaper grade
stolen, such ns watches, pins and the
like, whilo Monroe was known to bo tho
man with tho largo amount of.- dia
monds. Detective Sheets sa3-s that Cameron
was undoubtedly among tho gang that
came horo to receive the stolon goods,
but aa far as any case against him for,
the robbco' is concerned nothing could
bo proven against him.

compau3' of eieht in terror, relieved
onl3' by Mrs. Hudson's bravo singing
of hvmns and recounting of Biblo
stories. Tho schooner sprang a leak
and all tho food was nuder wator.
Just as it seemed that tho vessel
must go to pieces a steamer was sighted.
It proved to bo tho Snowdonia. and
all wero rescued in lifeboats. Hardb
