In the interest of peace and harmoay
among our people t nave aeeuea to
withhold my approval of said ordinance
and herewith return it with recommen
dations. If my reasons for doing so
meet your approval then the ordinance
approved September 3, 1GC3, wCI still
be in force and the matter will be as un
settled as it would be should you sus
tain the ordinance as It. now stands.
There seems to be no degree of differ
ence In the general hostility to either of
these ordinances.
I therefore recommend that the final
vote on this ordinance, taken November
27, be reconsidered, and then amended
as follows:
1st. That all of the ordinance of Nov.
27,19)8, after the enacting clause, be
stricken out.
2nd. That the ordiuance described in
the caption thereof, approved Sept. 2,
1908, be amcuded by striking out all
after the enacting clause.
If the course here indicated be per
sued there will then be no occupational
license tax in force in the city, the old
ordinance tax having been repealed,
and . cace will once more prevail In the
municipality; the tempest in the teapot
will subside; the city will be wide open
to all comers; the merchant whose busi
ness is through the whole year, whose
interest are all in Daytona, and for
whose Drosnerity he is ever working.
will take pot-luck with all comers, and
have protection against the horde of
peddlers and dealers who will flock in to
skim off the cream of the winter trade.
As my friend Rowe says, it ia a case of
hustle and survival of the: fittest. The
treasury may run still shorter V funds;
the rough streets may shake the day
lights out of the winter tourists as they
bump their big cars over them; the dust
may fill their eyes on every windy day
and destroy the fine wares exhibited in
the shops and stores of the merchants
because of the lameness of the public
treasury, but the great principle of gov
ernment by the consent of the governed
will not be lost sight of forever.
The Mayor baa been blamed and
cussed and damned for the inception
and passage of these ordinances. He
.diarlaims any such distinction. It would
be discourteous to the Council to enter
tain any such theory.
It is a matter off municipal history
that when he entered upon the duties as
Mayor be recommended to the Council
that , the laws reptiatiaj cirocaes,

Second Day of His Trial for the
Murder of William E.
Annis.
By United Pre.
FLUSHING, L. I., Dec. 15 With
half of the jury selected for the trial of
Thornton Jenkins Haines, accused of
complicity in the murder of William E.
Annis, the task of weeding out was re
sumed this morning before Justice
Crane.
The prisoner and Justice Crane were
the only oues connected with the trial
who did not bear any marks of the
strain of the session of the previous day.
Two other jurors, Alexander Jardine,
plumber, and Hough McCuUough, milk
dealer, were today selected, making
eight in all.
Notice.
In yesterday's daily Mr. Douglass ad
vertised that he has severed his connec
tion with the Daytona Bakery. As so
few people were aware of any connec
tion other than wages, I wish to say
that I bought the Daytona Bakery of
H. E. Quigg, Dec. 1st. '08, and started
out under the name of Lilly A Douglass
with my capital.
Mr. Quigg has taken half interest, and
will do the baking.
Aa to the bills, we have the "dough"
(both kinds) to pay them.

REISN.
' (By United Press.)
LONDON. Dec. 15 From sources of
unquestioned reliability it is learned
today that both the royal family and
the physicians atteuding King Ed
ward are deeply concerned over his
majesty's condition. -
Nothing but reassuring notes are
given to the public but the king's health
is such that the mask must soon be
thrown aside and the grievious facts ad
mitted. That the king realizes his ill
ness is shown by the fart that he is
rapidly throwing many of lus govern
mental responsibilities to the shoulders
of the i rince of Wales. Under the
physician's orders, all royal engage
ments have been cancelled.

it is hia hope to ealarss aad cow to
such proportions aa to do a Ug local
business besides. : v
An excellent home trade woull five
him great encouragement, aad he SI
cater to it. and will put out eistaof
such quality aa to fully warrant local
merchants in handling his stock, llr.
Cave wants, as far as poaa&le. to kSaa
tify himself with his home people, to
supply the borne market, and to isajilnj
largely home help, and the asoaeywCI
be largely turned over and over at
home.
He bas had as many as forty applica
tions from local peopl , mostly Daytoaa
and Port Orange girls, who waatto
learn the trade, and it h Mr. Cave's pur
pose to give them the opportunity, as
girls soon become adepts m the art of
shaping the smokers. The cigar saaau
factory business is one of very few
where women receive wages upon the
same scale as men.
There are cigars smoked in Daytona,
says Mr. Cave, in sufficient numbers to
require the services of twenty men in
their manufacture were they made here.
It is a well known fact that cigar work
men spend their salaries largely where
they live. It is easy to sec the advant
age to Daytona of building up as huge a
manufactory here as possible. Daytona
is proud of being one of the most popu
lar tourist towns in Florida and hopes
always to maintain the easy lead she
enjoys, but she can profit still more
largely by securing as adjuncts those
business enterprises which create and
distribute wealth the year round. '
Florida cigars already have a reputa
tion, are regarded as superior to the
l'drto Rico products, and no trouble is
anticipated in selling all that can be
made on the reputation tne state has
established for smokers of pleasing flavor
attd aroma.
One of the great advantages of a fac
tory here rather than in Porto Rica or
C-.ba is the facility with which ord rs
can be rushed to consuming quarters.
The delay ot ordering by boat and re
ceiving shipments by boat is worth con
sidering. Mr. Cave was two years in Porto Rico
and Cuba as purchasing agent for the
Porto Rico Export Co. and handled over
7,000,000 cigars a year. He paid $340
to $360 a week for revenue stamps alone.
The first consignment of sample boxes
has arrived and Daytona's new product
is being packed ready for distribution.
Prominent citizens are Interested in
the enterprise and two schemes ha e
been suggested to Mr. Cave if he wishes
to branch out on a broader field of oper
ations. A number of prominent men ot
means are discussing the feasibility of a
