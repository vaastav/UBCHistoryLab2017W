CONGRESS IN SESSION
Machinery for Organization
of the House Worked
Smoothly.
REED OF MAINE SPEAKER
Pithy Address of the Statesman
Whose Rulings Will Once
More Govern.
ATTENDANCE IN THE SENATE.
Completion of Preliminary Work Prep.
aratory to Receiving the Presi
dent's Message."
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. 2.-The
machinery for the organization of the
House of Representative? worked to-day in
a very satisfactory manner and without
the slightest jar. Mr. Reed of Maine,
in pursuance of the unanimous decision of
the Republican caucus, was elected to the
speakership by a vote of 234 as against 95
for Mr. Crisp of Georgia, the Democratic
candidate, ri for Mr. Bell of Colorado, the
Populist candidate, and 1 for Mr. Culber
son of Texas, Democrat. The six votes for
the Populist candidate were given by
Messrs. Baker of Kansas, Howard of Ala
bama, Kern of Nebraska and Shuford,
Skinner and Stroad of North Carolina.
The one vote for Mr. Culberson was given
by his colleague, Mr. Crane, this being the
only deviation from the party programme.
Mr. Reed's speech on taking the chair
was brief and decisive. He would not
speak for the past, he said, the past could
speak for itself: nor should he speak of the
future, as they were not now putting off
the harness but putting it on. But be
suggested that those who had acted with
wisdom in the past might be fairly ex
pected to act with wisdom in the future.
After the oath of office had been adminis
tered to the Speaker and all the members,
tbe next step in the Republican pro
gramme, the electing of House officers,
was taken, and Messrs. McDowell of Penn
sylvania, Russell of Missouri, Glenn of
New' York, McElroy of Ohio and Couden
of Michigan were chosen as clerk, sergeant
at-arms, doorkeeper, postmaster and
chaplain respectively.
The rules of the Fifty -first Congress,
popularly known as the Reed rules, were
adopted for the government of the House
in the present session, after an assurance
from Cannon (R.) of Illinois, who had
offered the resolution, that they would
hereafter be referred to the Committee on
Rules, and that the House would have an
opportunity to discuss the decision of the
committee. That assurance seemed to
satisfy Crisp, who had raised the question,
and the matter went through without
further contention.
After some further preliminary proceed
ings and a dra wine: for seats in the usual
manner, perhaps somewhat in contraven
tion of the anti-lottery law, and in which
drawing many of the prizes fell to some
of the least known of the members and
many of the blanks to some of the most
distinguished, the House at 3:35 p.m. ad
journed until to-morrow.
The floral tributes as usual, plentiful in
number and unique in design, added an
attractive background to the scene on the
floor and relieved to some extent the dull
ness of the chamber. A bunch of ex
quisite jacqueminot rosts, rising on long
stems from an earthern jar, and tied with
pink ribbons, was one of four hothouse
gifts resting on Mr. Reed's desk.
At noon the Rev. Mr. Bagby, chaplain
of the last House, offered prayer as fol
lows :
"Almighty God, whose kingdom ruleth
over all, as we meet toeether in these halls
of legislation, we would first take thy
name on our lips and acknowledge our de
pendence on thee. Graciously bles=, we
beseech thee, the President of the United
States and his Cabinet, the Senate and
House of Representatives and all who ad
minister the affairs of this Nation. Rule
thou the hearts of our rulers. And may
all men learn to praise thee for the riches
of ;rrace in Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen."
Then Mr. Kerr, clerk of the last House,
called the members to order and the roll
of States was called, beginning with Ala
bama, 341 members responding. Mr.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio rose and said:
"I have the honor to present the name
of Thomas Brackett Reed, a Representative
in this body from the State of Maine, for
the office of Speaker."
Before the sentence had been finished a
hand-clapping was started among the Re
publican members and for a minute or so
the clapping was kept up on the floor and
repeated from the galleries.
Then Mr.*Sayres(D.) of Texas nominated
in the same brief terms Charles F. Crisp,
a Representative from the State of Georgia.
The clerk then asked if there were any
other nominations, and Mr. Kern (P.) of
Nebraska nominated John C. Bell, a Rep
resentative from Colorado. The nomina
tion was greeted with a laugh of derision
from the Republicans. Messrs. Hop Kins
(R.) of Illinois, Loud (R.) of California,
Catchings (D.) of Mississippi and Erdmam
(D.)of Pennsylvania were appointed tellers
and the voting proceeded. The only
break from the political traces was when
Mr. Crane (D.) of Texas cast his vote, not
for Mr. Crisp, but for Mr. Culberson (D.) of
Texas.
\V:.en the rollcall was finished the re-
Bult was announced by the tellers as fol
lows: For Mr. Reed 234 votes, for Mr.
Crisp 95, for Mr. Bell 6, for Mr. Culberson
1; total. .336 votes.
The oath of office was administered to
Mr. Reed by Mr. Harmon of Pennsylvania
(R.), the member who has had the longest
continuous service.
After the usual formalities had been ob
served th<: new Speaker made his opening
address. He sa ;d :
"'i'-ntlemen of the House of Represen
tatives: it will not be unbecoming in me,
I hope, if I express to this assembly and
acknowledge to it that it is very agreeable
to me to stand once more in the place
which I left four years ago. [Applause.]
Of • the past, however, I shall not
speak, for Uw past can spea k for
itself in words more fitting and
suitable than any which can come prop
erly from my lip.-,. Nor sha]] j speak of
the future, for we are not now putting off
the harness, but putting it on.; yet I hope
I may say of the future in the light of the
past that if at any time anything is
done that may seem inadequate, time
wmch has justified on many occasions
may do so agam. Thoss who -h ave acte d
witn wisdom in the fJitst may be fairly ex
pected to act with wisdom in" the future.
Ihe pleasure atsociated with the honor
you have bestowed upon me, an honor
which every American citizen can ap
preciate and for which I give thanks, is but
for a moment, while the cares and respon
sibilities will extend themselves over many
weary days. So far as the performance of
my duties affects the people of the United
States I ask their considerate judgment;
so far as it affects the members of this
House I ask the cordial co-operation of
the gentlemen on both sides of the cham
ber, without which I cannot hope to suc
ceed, assuring them that no effort on my
part will be spared to aid them in the per
formance of their duties by that entire
impartiality which is their just due."
[Loud applause.]
The oath of office was then administered
by the Speaker to members of the House,
whose names were called by States, alpha
betically.
The organization of the House was com
pleted by the adoption of a resolution
offered by Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio electing
the following officers: McDowell of Penn
sylvania, clerk; Russell of Missouri, ser
geant-at-arnis; Mr. Glenn of New York,
doorkeeper; Mr. McElroy of Ohio, post
master, and Rev. Mr. Couden of Michi
gan, chaplain.
A substitute which was offered by Sayers
(D.) of Texas, electing the present holders
of these offices, was put to viva-voce vote.
The Speaker Baid, with an amusing pre
tense of hesitation, that the noes appeared
to have it, and then, after general laugh
ter, he announced that the noes had it.
The newly elected officials had the oath
administered to them and further progress
was made by the adoption of resolutions
for daily meetings of the House at noon,
for notifying the President and the Senate
of the House being in session and having
elected its Speaker and clerks, and for the
appointment of a committee to join a like
committee on the part of tns Senate to
wait upon the President.
Payne (R) of Ohio, Cannon of Illinois
and Crisp (D.) of Georgia were appointed
such committee on the part of the House.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois offered a resolution
that the rules of the House of the Fifty
first Congress be the rules of the present
Congress.
A question was put to him by Crisp (D.)
of Georgia whether the adoption of that
resolution now was intended to prevent
any report from the Committee on Rules
and any opportunity to discuss the rules.
The question was answered by Mr. Can
non to the effect that such was not his de
sire or purpose, but that of course he could
not respond for the majority of the
House.
Dingley of Maine (R.) asked Mr. Can
non whether it was intended that at the
proper time the rules should be referred to
the committee on rules and that ample op
portunity would be given to the House to
discuss the report of that committee.
'•Oh, certainly," Mr. Cannon returned.
"That will be entirely agreeable," said Mr.
Crisp; "I don't in any way wish to inter
fere witn the adoption of any temporary
rules." The resolution was agreed to. The
drawing for seats was then gone through
and when this formality was completed
the House at 3:35 p. m. adjourned until to
morrow at noon, and the cleric gave notice
of a Democratic caucus immediately.
OPENISG OF TUE SENATE.
Tlie Only Interesting feature Was the
Swearing In of -Vetc Members.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 2.— There
was an unusually lar^e attendance of Sen
ators when the Fifty-fourth Congress con
vened to-day, the only recorded absentees
being Hill of New York, Kindsay of Ken
tucky, Wolcott of Colorado and the two
Senators from Louisiana. Palmer of
Illinois aud Jones of Arkansas, absent
during the first part of the proceedings,
came in before the adjournment. The
only interesting feature of the proceed
ings was the swearing in of new Senators.
Being unofficially advised that the Presi
dent's message would not be delivered
until noon to-morrow, the Senate imme
diately thereafter adjourned until that
time.
S?nator Davis of Minnesota was the first
Senator to occupy a seat on the floor. He
came at 10:30 o'clock. At that hour the
public galleries had already quite a sprink
ling of visitors, the ladies' gallery in par
ticular being more than half filled.
The next Senator to appear was Mr.
Stewart of Nevada, who was followed
closely by the venerable Senator from
Vermont, Mr. Morrill, then came Mr.
Pritchard of North Carolina, Mr. Harris
of Tennessee, the Populist Senator from
Kansas, Mr. Pfeffer, and Mr. Teller of
Colorado, and at 11 o'clock came Senator
Hawley of Connecticut. After that they
came in rapidly, and at noon, the hour of
convening, the seats were generally tilled
and the galleries were overflowing.
Promptly at noon the blind chaplain of
the Senate, Mr. Milburn, tapped the gavel
and offered prayer. He returned thanks
that during the recess none of those on
the rollcall had been "smitten by the
shadow feared by man," "But," he added,
"in the midst of a tour of congratulations
and joy our hearts and sympathies turn
to a Btricken home in lowa, where
wife and daughter sit mourning the
departure from earth of a Husband ana
father lately a member of this House."
(alluding to ex-Senator Wilson). Refer
ring to the ancient assistant doorkeeper
(Isaac Bassett) the chaplain said: "Like
wise we commend to thy fatherly tender
ness a time-honored otTicer of this House,
who for more than threescore years has
been in attendance at the opening of
every session of Congress, who now is on
a bed of affliction, worn with' pain and
exhausted by suffering. Raise him, O
Lord, from his couch and bring him Dack
to his accustomed place."
At the close of the chaplain's prayer
Vice-President Stevenson laid before the
Senate the credentials of the Senator from
Idaho, Shoup, which were read and
placed on file in the usual way. Then the
Vice-President called upon the Senators
elect to come forward as their names were
called by the clerk and take the oath of
office.
On motion of Cockrell (D.) of Mis
souri the hour of meeting was fixed at 12
o'clock.
Sherman (K.) of Ohio offered a reso
lution to Inform the President that the
Senate was organized and ready for busi
ness, which was adopted.
On motion of Vilas (D.) of Wisconsin a
committee of two was appointed to join a
similar committee from the House to wait
upon the President, the Vice-President
naming as such committee Vilas and Alli
son.
On motion of Harris (D.) of Tennessee
the Senate then at 12:30 took a recess for
an hour.
Shortly before the hour arrived at which
the Senate resumed its session, Assistant
Private Secretary Pruden made his ap
pearance and at once went to the Vice-
President's room. The impression re
ceived in the Senote chamber was that he
brought a verbal statement from the
President that his message would not be
delivered to Congress until to-morrow.
Immediately after the Senate resumed its
session.
Sherman (R.) of Ohio moved an ad
journment till to-morrow. The Vice-
President put the question and waited a

full half-minute for comment or objection.
None being forthcoming, the motion was
declared carried aud the Senate stood ad
journed accordingly.
The official list of Senators present re

Louisiana Senators, Blanchard and Caf
frey, D. B. Hill of New York, Lindsay of
Kentucky and Wolcott of Colorado.
REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATION.
Two Populist Votes Are Needed to Control
the Senate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 2.— The cau
cus held this afternoon by the Republican
Senators, although devoid of positive ac
tion, demonstrated the fact that a probably
successful attempt will soon be made to
reorganize the Senate in both committees
and elective offices. The Senators were
not in session more than half an hour; but
during that brief period there was a gen
eral clearing of the atmospbere.which had
been somewhat obscured by the action of
a few Senators who met Saturday night
for the purpose of preparing a plan of
action that should result in taking the
management of the Senate out of the
hands of the older members.
The result of this afternoon's talk
is a reconciliation of conflicting ele
ments and the establishment of a sin
cere desire on the part of all those present
to do that which is for the best interest of
the whole party. The caucus met with a
feeling of apprehension in the minds of
some as to what measures Hansbrough,
Pettigrew, Clark, Carter, Mantle, Dubois,
Chandler, GaUinger and Proctor, who held
the conference referred to, intended doing
in the matter of organization. A few of
the leaders of these Western Senators were
determined to force action at once, but
Senators Proctor and Chandler favored
waiting until a more convenient season,
and were not prepared to go to the extreme
to which the course of the others pointed.
Mr. Dubois was opposed to permitting
the chairman of the caucus, Mr. Sherman,
to appoint the committee to fill the exist
ing committee vacancies, as he looked
upon this as inimical to the interests of
the younger members. He had a resolu
tion providing for the selection of a com
mittee of nine for this purpose by the cau
cus.
Mr. Hoar had a resolution prepared in
structing Senator Sherman, as chairman
of the caucus, to name the committee, but
neither proposition was submitted. It is
said that the brief discussion showed quite
plainly that the caucus would not permit
Mr. Dubois' plan to prevail and Mr. Sher
man's privilege was set aside. It was
finally agreed that it would be better to
wait until a future day for the determina
tion of the whole subject.
Senator Frye was suggested as President
pro tern, and no other name was men
tioned. He will be nominated, but it was
deemed useless to do anything in the mat
ter to-day for the reason that no President
pro tern, can be elected so long as the Vice-
President fills the chair. If the Repub
licans can show the Democrats that they
have enough votes to elect the President
pro tempore, the election will be held. It
is understood that Mr. Sherman is to con
sult with the opposition caucus chairman
and arrange for a time for this vote to be
taken. If by that time the Republicans
have agreed upon a candidate for the other
offices the whole ticket will be placed in
the tield.
Of course in order to reorganize the
Senate the Republicans must have two
votes outside of those in their own ranks,
and Senator Stewart and Senator Jones of
Nevada are generally looked iipon as the
men who will vote with the Republicans
on organization. Stewart is bitterly
opposed to Dubois' plan, because he
lays at the door of the young Senator
from Idaho the blame for his removal
from the Committee on Appropriations.
This was one reason that actuated the
committee in proceeding cautiously.
Again, it was pointed out that the silver
men were endeavoring to secure an
organization on monetary lines, that the
Populists were considering a ticket and
the Democrats were not prepared to
surrender their control. The silver Re
publicans and Democrats this morning
informed the Populists that they could
not join in any effort to organize on silver
lines, and as soon as the Poprtlists, who
are the main advocates of this plan, are
convinced they cannot be successful it is
claimed that they will divide according to
their predilections for the two great par
ties—Alien and Kyle with the Demo-
crats and Jones, Stewart, Butler
and Peffer with the Republicans.
The Republicans need two of the
four votes. Republicans say that
all difference will be reconciled, and
that when they place a ticket in the field
it will have the necessary majority. Tt is
hardly probable, however, that this re
organization will be effected before the
holidays.
CMAmnoxs OF silver.
Senators Who Will Force Free Coinage to
the front.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 2. -A con
ference of Senators favorable to the free
coinage of silver was held this morning in
the marble-room. There were present
about fifteen Senators, made up of Republi
cans, Democrats and Populists. Promi
nent among these were Senators Teller,
Stewart, Call, Allen, Tillman and Mantel.
The conference was called for the purpose
of enabling those favoring silver to discuss
the subject in an informal way. No effort
was made to outline a formal plan of cam
paign.
The spirit that animated those present,
however, showed that they intended to
keep up the right in the Senate as vigor
ously as they have in the past. The Presi
dent's message is bound, Mr. Teller says,
to open up a discussion of the fhiancial
question, and there can be no discussion of
that question, he asserts, without a discus
sion of the free coinage question. It was
agreed that no point should be waived,
and that in a general manner the silver
question should be forced to the front
whenever the opportunity presented itself.
Another conference will probably be held
later in the session.
SOME DEMOCRATIC CRUMBS.
Caucua of Minority House Members to
Select Officials.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 2.-Three
hours were consumed by the House Demo
crats in caucus this afternoon, selecting
the four officials of their party to which
they arc entitled by their minority repre
sentation. The veteran Ohioan, Colonel
Isaac Hill, who was the deputy sergeant
at-arms of the last Congress, was elected
special employe over H. W. Moler of Illi
nois, who held the oltlce of cashier in the
Fifty-third Congress. The office of spe
cial employe makes its possessor the legis
lative "whip" of the party, and is worth
$1500 per year.
After a long discussion interspersed
with numerous rollcalls George L. Brown
ing of Virginia and Thomas Cokeley of
New York were elected special messengers
with salaries of $1200 each. Mr. Cokeley
is a well-known member of the Tammany
party. The caucus finished its work by
electing James F. English of California
page.

MENIER BUYS AN ISLAND
The Great French Chocolate Man
Invests in a Canadian
Enterprise.
Failure of an English Syndicate to
Realize Profits at Anticosti
Causes the Deal.
MONTREAL, Quebec, Dec. 2.— A dis
patch to the claim commissioners of the
Island of Anticosti Company (Limited),
late to-day, has caused no end of comment
in political and commercial circles. The
dispatch in question was received from
Paris, by way of London, through the Ex
change Telegraph Company, and states
that it was learned authoritatively that
Menier, the great chocolate manufacturer,
had purchased the Canadian island of An
ticosti, situated in the estuary of the St.
Lawrence P-iver. No exact sum paid for
the inland has as yet been given out, but it
is thought to be in the vicinity of $200,000.
The island, until last year, was con
trolled by an English syndicate who pur
chased the entire island from the Canadian
Government in 1884. Their attempt to
colonize it and to introduce manufactures
was a failure, and early this year the com
pany was in such financial straits that the
only course left was to sell the island.
Numerous offers were received, but that
of the Parisian multi-millionaire was the
largest, and the commissioners having; in
charge the winding up of the affairs of the
company accepted his offer.
In Government circles the greatest in
dignation prevails as to the sale of the
island, as it will be practically a French
colony planted in tne midst of Canadian
fishing grounds and the track of commerce.
Even the most optimistic of the members
of the Government predict trouble from
the establishment of this semi-French
colony. It is stated that Menier will take
control of the island at once.
RECEIVEI> THE RED HAT.
Some of the Vewly Appointed Cardinals
Paid Homage to the lope.
LONDON, Eng., Dec. 2.— A dispatch
from Rome to the Pall Mall Gazette says
crowds of people gathered in the Vatican
early this morning upon the occasion of
the holding of the public consistory. The
Papal procession into the Sala Regia,
where the consistory was held, began at
9 o'clock. First came the Swiss Guard,
followed by the Noble Guard and the Papal
I choir. Immediately following was the
Pope, carried in the sedia gestatoria, the
chair in which he is carried on certain oc
casions. His Holiness was followed by a
number of Cardinals and Bishops and the
members of the Papal court. The services
were very short. Those of the newly ap
pointed Cardinals who are now in Rome
kissed the foot and hand of the Pope and
received from his Holiness the apostolic
embrace. They then received the red hat
from the hands of the Pope, who at once
retired.
UPJIISIXO A.MOXO MOSLEMS.
American Missionaries Killed During
Hie Massacre.
BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 2.— A cable dis
patch was received this morning at the
rooms of the American Board of Foreign
Missions stating that there had been a
terrible uprising among the Moslems at
Corfa, a station of Central Turkey Mission,
on October 28.
The cable dispatch was very brief, owing
to full particulars having not at the time
been received of the massacres, but from
what information was at hand it is certain
that some of the American missionaries
were killed during the massacres.
The dispatch stated that the Moslems
made an attack on the Christian popula
tion of the village of the 28th and that for
two whole days pillage and murder con
tinued unabated. The Turkish soldiers
did not attempt to quell the disturbances,
but witnessed all without attempting to
interfere.
The premises of the American board
was surrounded by armed Christians and
for a time the Turkish populace did not
make any attack on the buildings. Later
in the day, however, a general massacre
was begun, and from that time on no in
formation has been received as to the re
sults. Nearly all the native American
missionaries have fled from the station.
Miss Corinna Shattuck of Framingham,
Mass., was in charge of the station and it
is from the absolute silence which she has
maintained that the officials of the board
feel positive of the death of the American
missionaries.
The massacre took place over a month
ago, but being one of the furthest removed
of the Turkish stations news of the mas
sacre has just reached the board's agent
at Constantinople. The board to-night
dispatched to Washington the text of the
dispatch, entreating the authorities to act
at once.
LIEUTENANT PEARY'S PLAN
The Intrepid Explorer Will
Again Journey to the
Arctic.
Receiving Offers From Many Persons
Who Are Willing to Fit Out
an Expedition.
PORTLAND, Me., Dec. 2.— Lieutenant
Peary has entirely recovered from the
serious illnes3 which attacked him imme
diately after his arrival from the far
North, and which at one time caused the
physicians in attendance to have very
grave doubts as to his recovery.
It was his purpose to have gone to Wash
ington immediately after a two weeks'
rest at bis home in order to fit up the Arc
tic collection brought back in the Kite for
the Smithsonian Institute. His illness
has, however, delayed the work, but he
will start during the coming week to su
perintend the putting of the collection
into the institute.
The chances for another expedition dur
ing the coming year are very bright, and
in all probability the Government will
once more send the intrepid explorer
north. When seen to-day, Lieutenant
Peary stated that he had already received
several offers for another expedition, hut
that at present he was not free to mention
any names. These offers had not been
confined to the North American continent,
but some had been received from Euro
pean countries.
Lieutenant Peary has not as yet made
up his mind as to which of the numerous
offers he will accept, as he is awaiting the
decisive action of the Government in re
gard to the recommendation which has
been made to send another expedition
next year, and in that case he would have
to give up all outside offers and confine
himself to the management of the new ex
pedition.
DEATH FROM CHARCOAL FUMES.
Three Men Fatally Injured and Two Others
Narrowly Escape Death in a New
York Sugar Refinery.
NEW YORK, N. Y.,Dec. 2.— Three men
will die as the result of a remarkable acci
dent in the Molienbauer sugar refinery at
the foot of South Eleventh street, "Wil
liamsburg, this evening.
Two others narrowly escaped with their
lives, and may be laid up for some time.
Mollenhauer's refinery shut down last
Thursday to take account of stock and put
the machinery and boilers in condition.
It was announced that the refinery would
resume operations to-morrow.
This evening, at 7 o'clock, a number of
charcoal workers were ordered to begin
work in the underground charcoal pits,
which were in active operation and gener
ally closed. Five men went into tne pits.
As the thick fumes of the charcoal, which
has accumulated for several days, struck
the men, they fell down insensible, one
after the other, in single file. The two
men nearest the sunken door were pulled
out and revived after a time and went to
their homes very ill.
Fellow workmen broke windows from
the outside of the pits, and after the at
mosphere had cleared hauled out the fol
lowing: Herman Fuchs, Thomas Kohl
mann, Thomas Levy. Fuchs and Kohl
mann were taken to the Homeopathic
Hospital and Levy to the Eastern District
Hospital. It was reported late to-night,
from both of these institntions that all
would die.
OUTRAGES OF WHITECAPS.
After Mysterious Warnings They Carried
Off a Farmer's Family, Poisoned
V Stock and Burned Buildings,
WICHITA, Kan., Dec. 2.— Whitecaps
have appeared in Kingman County, their
victim being William Whitmer, a tenant
on land belonging to the J. B. Watkins
Mortgage Company. The Federal court
had settled a dispute as to the title of the
land by evicting the former tenant and
placing the mortgage company's tenant in
possession. Soon thereafter mysterious
warnings, skulls and cross-bones made
their appearance on Whitmer's outbuild
ings. While he was in Wichita recently
thirty masked men carried his family from
the house, leaving them at a deserted sod
house several miles distant, and destroyed
his furniture. On his returning Whitmer
resumed possession and the mysterious
warnings reappeared. Since then hia
stock has been poisoned and fires of in
cendary origin have destroyed his barns,
grcneries and farm machinery. Several
suspects have been arrested.

FORECLOSURE OF MORTGAGES.
Many Reasons and Plans Urged for
a Settlement of the Vexed
Proposition.
OMAHA, Nebr., Dec. 2.— Senator Thurs
ton's recent interview proposing a new
plan for settling the Pacific roads' debt,
the action of the Trans-Mississippi Con
gress on the subject and the statements of
Receiver Clark that something must be
done this winter by Congress to save the
Union Pacific from utter bankruptcy, has
precipitated a general discussion of the
important subject. The Trans-Mississippi
Congress here last week debated resolu
tions declaring for the immediate foreclose
ure of the Government mortgages on the
Pacific roads or else a reorganization on
such lines as would only allow the rail
roads a reasonable degree of profit.
W. J. Carlson of California presented a
minority report on the latter resolution,
in which he pointed out the utility of the
railroads in the development of the West
and urged that a settlement be effected on
the merits of the ca3e.
The resolution was championed by
President Bryan, who had originally in
troduced it. He declared that the Union
Pacific Railroad was the most iniquitous
corporation in this country. It had
robbed the people, and even attempted to
intimidate the United States courts.
There was no reason why a congress of
Western business men should not go on
record in opposition to this gigantic bur
den on the people. Mr. Carlson spoke at
length in favor of the minority report and
after some further discussion and a gen
eral ventilation of opinions both reports
were referred back to the committee.
Senator Thurston's plan is this: Take a
statement of the Government's claim
against the main line from the Missouri
River to San Jose as it will stand July 1,
1896, and offer the claims as a whole for
sale to the highest bidder who will give 40
or 50 per cent of the principal or interest;
make that the minimum, so the
Government would get nearly or
quite half of its entire claim ; sell
that claim to one purchaser, giving
the purchaser all the rights of the Govern
ment, including its right of entry, posses
sion and foreclosure ; eive to one court of
the United States, presumably of Ne
braska, jurisdiction over a suit to foreclose
on the entire property and on tne fore
closure sale provide that the property
should be sold as a whole, the purchasing
committee to be created as a corporation
and as such to possess all the corporate
powers that Congress conferred upon the
several lines.
Speaking of this new plan of settlement
Edward Rosewater, editor of the Bee, said :
"Those who insist that the Government
shall make a settlement by which repay
ment of every dollar advanced by it to the
Pacific railroads, as well as the unpaid in
terest accrued, shall be secured will object
to any scaling of the Government's
claims. On the other hand, those who
desire to see the water wrung out of the
roads in order that they may be operated
on the basis of actual value will object to
any scheme that would squeeze out only
one-half of the water and leave the other
half in as a dead weight upon the patrons
of the road.
"They will insist upon absolute fore
closure and sale to the highest bidder
under restrictions that will prevent future
fictitious capitalization. On that basis alone
can any reasonable assurance be had that
the Pacific roads will regain prosperity
and the region tributary to the great over
land system be relieved irom burdensome
exactions to meet fixed charges on a
million of million of imaginary capital. I
have held to this view for years. In the
winter of 1887 I was summoned before the
United States Pacific Railway Commission
and asked to present my views as to the
best plan of handling the Pacific roads'
debt. In all essential particulars my views
are the same to-day where conditions have
not undergone a radical change. In refer
ence to liquidating the debt I said before
the commission that of course the first
mortgage would be the first thing to liqui
date.
"I presume the first-mortgage bondhold
ers will come in and claim the road or
they would put it on sale. If the road on
that sale does not bring the amount of the
first mortgage the bondholders lose the
difference between that and what they
paid, and the second mortgage is wiped out
altogether and the people are relieved from
paying this money, for it is all the same.
If, on the other hand, the first mortgage is
satisfied I want the Government, which is
going to take this money out of the hands
of the people, to say at once that there is
no further excuse for excessive transporta
tion tolls.
"I would have the Union Pacific put to a
sale, and if it bring more than the first
mortgage bonds, very good. Its debt
would be donated to the people of the whole
United States. Just as soon as tolls are
reduced it will benefit all the people. If
the road were sold and the stock wiped out
entirely, and the new management had a
railroad for what it is worth in the mar
ket, they would be able to eive the people
rates of transportation that would revolu
tionize Western traffic. Go into the mar
ket and sell the road for what it will bring,
and let it be operated honestly, without
any Government interference whatever."
AFTER THE BOGUS JUOXEY.
Belatives Allege That He Wat Unduly
Influenced.
OMAHA, Nebb., Dec. 2.— The Boggs
will contest, which involves property ap
proximately worth $200,000, was taken up
in the county court this morning. The
brothers and sisters of the late George H.
Boggs are endeavoring to break the will
which was made but a short time before
the death of Mr. Boggs, and allege that
undue pressure was brought to bear upon
him by nis wife, who called to her assist
ance her relatives, and that at the time
Mr. Boegs was not in condition, mentally,
to resist such a pressure or make a good
will. It is also alleged that in a previous
will Mrs. Boggs, who receives outright all
of the property under the will which
it is now sought to break, was given
| only a life interest in the property,
