That Fool Wichita Editor. t
It is wonderful with what urbanity the great American
people permit themselves to be robbed by their represent
ees in the congress, in tne legislature, In the city council
by board-s of supervisors, commissioners, and what not,
and all under the guise of superior statesmanship or of
economical wisdom. Appropriations are to be made for,
the implement of the Missouri mer Many thousands
of dollars are to be expended ostpns bly to deepen the
channel of that degenerate flow of sflUi, which stream
aboriginally meandered a a navigable water, but in reality
expended to strengthen the political cinch of the congress
men who axe navigating the steal There is not a loose
man to be found outsUe the lnaane asylums of Kansas and
Mrsouri who does not know that the only difference be
tween the Missouri river and a rat hole as receptacles for
wasted money lies in the fact that one is wet and the other
dry The destiny of that tawny tide of sand and dampness
is to supply the irrigation ditches ot the future with water
already manured, which fate overtook the pelucent Ar
kansaw. And, by the way, that prophecy rerrunds us of the
fact that formerly appropriations were annually made for
the improvement of the navigable channel of Wichita's
main sewer After the thing had gone on uninterruptedly
for years, from which expenditure the people of this state
received nothing, it all going into the pockets of pet eastern
loafers, the editor of the Eagle wrote to the then congress- annual gge The analysis is not as long as the mes
and ee, forty per cent cheaper than butter and filling a
t want in thousands of families where they have to look at
both s'des of a dime before spending it. Nobody is de
ceived All know what they are bujmg. Here congress
steps in and taxes k out of existence in order to compel
people to buy n?eamery butter. That is now controlled by
trusts on a snmM scale, for butter malting on the farm has
almost gone oat of date.
' There is another interest involved that I have not seen
referred to The high price of cattle is maintained because
ihe packers have reached a point that they can use all of the
products to advantage. One of the most important of these
is the tallow, and this is largely used m the manufacture
of oleo If the packing houses are prevented from using
this in a profitable manner it is found to react on the price
of cattle. Will this, think you, suit the cattle feeders of
the country? I trow not. I am glad to see that our con-gressman-at-large,
Mr Bailey, opposed the Grout bill
most forcibly
If a law is enacted by congress which has been adopted
by some of the states, requiring that this article shall be
plainly stamped, so that it cannot be sold for something
that it is not, it seems to me that it would meet all the re
quirements of justice. But this does not suit the butter
factories They want a club that they can beat the life
oat of oleo, and in the Grout bill they have it. It is neither
right nor Just."

A Postal Abuse and Remedy.
Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith has again
calli the attention of congress to th deficit of millions
for the postoffice service of the country and points out that
the way to remedy it is in shutting fake publications off aa
second dass or newspaper matter, forcing these fakes to
pay third class rates Chairman Loud of the house com
mittee on poetofnees, has been urging the results of this
abuse upon congress for years, but all to no purpose. The
pressure must come from the business men of the country
upon their congressmen, respeoti'v ely, if anything is done.
According to the report of the postmaster general, there
was a deficit of nearly Are and a half millions in the postal
- venues dur'ng the fiscal year closed on June 30 While
iiH shows a marked improvement over previous years, it
iirm &a that conditions are still far from satisfactory. There
- no good reason why the postofflce department should not
1 e elf-sus'alnrag at least
Th remedy for these recurring annual deficits lies in
the corr tion of flagrant abuses which prevail in connec
tion with second class matter. Year after year the post
master pnrral calls attention to these abuses and asks for
in ir cotp tion. Only a year or two ago It was estimated
that the gornment was losing eight millions of dollars a
ear on the transportation of matter which was not right
fuii entitled to the second class rate of postage Last
vrar the postmaster general estimates, such matter was
ctu cl at a loss ranging from twelve to twenty millions.
If a rop were put to this abue bv congress if matter
not errti led to admission to the malls under the second
las rat- of postage were eliminated, not onlv wou'd the
I ostal reenues be sufficient to meet the expenditures, but
tnere w ulu be a comfortable surplus left which might be
epi lied 'oa reduction of letter postage.
outgrown the jury system." He also takes occasion to
criticise that meritorious passage in the president s message
in which he deplorts the fact that the American merchant
marine is a thing of the past and that our flag is not seen
on the seae of the world because of this fact. Mr. Bryan
also refers to many things which Mr McKinley did not say
in his message.

As for the Center of Population.
Is the Star of Empire to cease to take its way west
ward? It seems as if the center of population of the United
States has ceased to tra el w estward, if, indeed, it is not
going in the other direction. A city contemporary says that
not the least remarkable result of the census of 1900 is that
it arrests the westward march of what is known as "the
center of population." This point. Which had been moving
steadily westward at each succeeding census, was estab
lished by the census of 1890 as being in the southern part
of Indiana, at a point a little west of Greensburg, the
county seat of Decatur county, and twenty miles east of
Columbus. Geographically It in latitude 39 degrees, 11
minutes and M seconds, and longitude 83 degrees, 82 min
utes and 53 seconds.
But in the past ten years the population of the states
lying wholly east of this meridian has increased to almost
exactly the same extent as in the states west of It, the in
crease in each case being in round sumbers 6 000 000 out of a
total of 13,225,000 The remaining 1 22" 000 increase is fur
nished by the states of Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Ten
nessee and Alabama And It will require a distribution of
population by census districts to determine whether there
has been any westward advance or not in the center of
population. But at any rate the advance will be trifling,
and the east holds its own with the west in contributing
to the national greatness.
