PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
[CnUnwCfrm Flntitq*.}
it an am believed to be belter in all respects thin
the needle gun, while Us metal la regarded as aa*
perior to the Inner. Tbe Department has already
on band breech-loaders of approved pa terns, ad
equate lor the supply of the mounted Infantry.
aniUBT vovexknts.
Tbe principal movements of troops have been
in Tom and tbe Mexican frontier and territories,
tbe de alls of which are given In tbe accompany
ing teport of General Grant, commanding tbe Ar
mies of th*» United Stales, and ihe reports of
Division and Department commanders, to which
rererenct: la made. General Grant report
fo«s b«« Seen Wept In «n
the lately rebel Stales for the purpose of ln»nrirg
the exccnUon ©flaw, and pi electing life and prop

leccc no lawhnl force—a rfa™ unaiieMn bis
opinion, than conldjxare been expected after such
-* conflict as that through which we b*'* passed—
but sufficient to loeliiv the course which has been
purvned.TMUiiirr movemcnis bate aiso been di
rected with a riei r to the protection
of emigrants on their war to the
Donntaln Terriionci* against the hostility and op
position of tbe Indians. Acave acd carefn racis
tires have Nrec Instituted for successfully and
fpcedilv carrring Into effect the generous provis
ions ofVongress for tbe benefit of surviving sol
dim of the war for tbe Union. The subject of
tbr iiavmem of extra bounties to d'sebargod sol
dim. and extra par to discharged officers, ha * re
reived assiduous attention.
The recent law devolving upon the War
Department, -instead of tbe accounting
officers of tbe Treasury, the duties
of examination trd settlement of claims of the
men, the disbursement of nearly S3!,0o0,00j
among more than a million of claim
arts, soon after the adjournment
of . Congress a competent board of
officers was organized to prepare rules and regu
lations for the payment of the authorized boon
tie*. Diligent application was given to the work,
at'd the regulations having been found to be in
strict accordance with law, were promptly ap
proved. Published, and directed to be carried into
efiecl. To the s«mc Board the subject of bounties
of colored soldier* was also referred, wire a
view to provide anv additional checks that might
guard the bounty from fraudulent assigns, and
ucan it to colored soldiers, and protect Ihe
Trcasr.ry against fraud; and when tbe report was
received parmeut of the bounties was ordered.
As to the other classes of bounties, the
Paymaster General regards it as Im
praciible to make .payment until
all applications shall bavebeen received and claims
classified and registered by States and organiza
tions; but by this preliminary process the ulti
mate payment will, it is believed, be greatly ex
pcdlied. Attempted olbcrwi-c,probably the wort
would n?vcr be lolly accomplished. Of the valu
able public records by which the validity of the
bortity claims ate lo be tested, there is In tbe
archives of (he Government but one copy, already
much worn, lor each period. An examination for
each individual case would soon reduce them to
Illegible t heeds. '
Ihe duty of the Government to the soldiers who
haw been maimed or have fallen mils defence,
has not betn neglected. Much care has been
lak>-u. by precautions and practical tests, to secure
for lire former the most durable, useful and com
fortable artificial limbs. From July IGth (the
dare of the set 0! Congress authorizing artificial
limbs to be tarnished), to July ist.lHW, there have
boon to disabled soldiers, 3,881 legs,
-2,210 arms, 0 feet, 55 bands,' 125 surgical apparatus,
and U la supposed ibat not more thin IjJOU limbs
r.'tnniu (till to be supplied.st au estimated cost of
$771,01 m. In order to { elude unfortunate casra in
which, from (be tatnre of the injury or operation,
no limb or oiher surgical appliance ran bi advan
tageous? adopted, me Surgeon General has re
comimnced that if tbe appropriation for (bis pur
pose sha'l be continued, the monev value of an
artificial 'imb in Hen of me apparatus be given to
the maimed soldier.

FROM EUROPE,
Ily Atlantic Cable—lmmense Reform Meet
ing In London.
London. December S. —An Immense Reform
demonstration is In progress in this city this fore
noon.
London, December B.—lt is estimated that then
were at least fifty thousand persons in the pro
cession which formed the imposing feature of the
Reform demonstration which look place to-day.
Nearly all the Trades Societies werejont in full
force and marched to the place of meeting. Forty
seven of these organized bodies, together
with various branches of the Reform
League were in tbe line, which was
c-.mposed of four grand divisions, under the
guidance of marshals, and led by bands of music,
banners, society insignia, Ac. It was by far the
largest and most important aflalr of the kind
which has ever taken plscelnthis country, not
withstanding the very unpleasant state of the
wea'ber. It is a fact worthy of notice, that the
Jriais and Stripes waved above tbe procession in
many places, and was frequently and loudly
cheered. Tbe bands, too, seemed to have caught
the inspiration of the occasion, and indulged in Ihe
production of national airs of a patriotic char
acter. The meeting took place in the grounds of
the Eeanfoit Bouse, a most convenient location
for so large o gathering. Seven stands were
. erected for the accommodation of (be several
speakers, a large number of whom were present
cn the occasion. The stores la Tali Mall, Piccadilly
and the other thoroughfares through which the
procession passed, were closed, and people
thronged the streets all (the way from St. James
Park, where the proccjslon was formed, to (he
grounds at Beaufort House. The greatest
.-dor was maintained throughout the demonstra
tion, uml great enthusiasm prevailed. The moral
effict of the whole aflaircannotbe over-estimated.

Sm: The transactions of this Bureau during
the past year, as concisely reported In tbe foflow
statement, surpass in importance those of any
like period since its organization. The aggre
gate amount of pen-ion* paid during the fiscal
year ending Jane BU,lßfi2, just prior to tbe pas
sage of the_ liberal and comprehensive
pension act of *nuv 14, 1902, was only $790,381.
At the close oi the four years succeeding that date
tiie annual amount thus paid had increased to
m« rc than $13,000,000. For the current year there
wlll-be a much larger aggregate, and the estimates
for the next fiscal year, the rates of pension hav
ing been increased at the last >ession of Congress,
can (or a sum exceeding $33,000,000. Under the
bounty land ads of IBSU and 1855, the labor de
volving tuioij the Pension Office was very great
for a brief period, yet the entire aggregate value
of all the bounty land warrant* issued under (be
ration* acts B'uce the,formation of the Govern
ment, estimating the public lands so granted at
$1.25 per acre, only amounted, as stated in my an
nual report for 1802, to $32,252,327.50. Tbe whole
amount added during the last four years will not
raise the aggregate above 533.000.0CQ.
PENSION EXPENSES.
Tbe total sum paid in pensions proper down to
18C2, was $00,008,521.0(3. During the four years
lust succeeding, tbe whole amount paid was
$87,518,008 18. The amount of business now an
nually devolving upon the Bounty Land Division
is refativelv Insignificant; whim the pensions
granted during the last year, under all the acts of
a dale prior lotbatofJuly 14,1862, are nomorii
tally unimportant in comparison with those al
lowed under that and the supplementary acta.
In view of the large number of applicants which
continue to be received each month, on account of
casualties In the late war, it Is manifest that the
aggregate annual amount of pensions will con
tinue to swell for some years to come.
BEVOEUTtONABT TENSIONS.
Only one of tbe soldiers of the Revolution
whose names are Inscribed on Ihe pension rolls
Is now living—Samuel Downing, of Edinburgh,
Saratoga county. New York. This veteran, dis
tinguished by fortune as the last known survivor

pensioners has claimed bis pension, and
it is reasonably presumed that ml had
deceas'd before thcoii'horilr of the Federal Gov-
Moment was fully restored in those Slates. Of
the loitj-uine residing in the loyal States, nearly
two-fifths bad dl-appeared from the returns for

thirty survivors. A year later, in 18*13, there re
nutiried but eighteen, and In 16 '-1. but five. Since

Under the operations ot an act approved July 4,

on the restoration of Federal relations with those
Mates, and after the disbandment of their armies,
stricken from the pension rolls. This was ejected by
an ordenssued nnderdatc ot June 10. IH3. Pre

Tbe greatly Increased Isbor duvoiiog upon this
office, by reason of the passage of the pension
act of June Cth and July 25ch.-tß6*, a* well as tbe
continued reception 01 applications In numbers
exceeding whit was anticipated so (hr on In tbe
second year'after the close of the war, render It
necessary (0 ash considerable additions to toe
clerical force now authorized bylaw. The inad
equacy of salaries now allowed to clerk* m the
more responsible positions lo this office, and the
marked inequality between these salines and
tboee paid In other departments to offi
cers entrusted with duties no more ar
duous. and requiring no higher order
of qusltflcallODsin any respect, are urged upon
your earnest atientimi. A partial remedy would
oaveibecn found in a bill “to reorganize tbe clerical
force of ihe Department of the Interior, and for
other purposes,” which seasonably passed the
Senate without a division at tbe last session of
Congress, but which failed to receive the concur
rence of ihe Douse of Keprea-ntalivcs. The
changes in tbe Pension laws abo re alluded to,
made subsequently to the passage of this bill by
the Senate, render it Inadequate to the present
wants of this office, and ilia hoped that a new bill,
more In accordance with the necessities of this
branch of the public service may be framed and
presented for tbe consideration of Congress at an
early day.
Without here Investigating in detail what, in
my opinion, should be asked on behalf of this
office in the way of reorganization It is suggested,
generally, that the appointment of temporary
e’erks be discontinued, and authority granted for
the regular appointment of the full number of
clerks and employee now required.
Of the ten principals beads of division* In this
office, at least five are justly untitled to salaries of
$2,210, and tbe remaining five should in my
opinion, receive J2.00J per annum.
An addition offifty percent throughout to the
salaries of all clerks and employes as fixed by
law, before tbe late war, would hardly make good
the advance which has taken place In the expense
of living. Nor would such increase more than
keep pace with the average advance of wages and
salaries in other callings.
In my last annual report attention was called
to ihe advantages to be derived from the appoint
ment of a Consulting and Supervising Surgeon for
this office. Fuitncrexperieuceonly confirms my
previous opinions as to tbe expediency of legisla
tion providing for such an officer. 1 would also
respectfully repeal my former suggestions as to
the desirableness of more complete information
tlan is at present attainable hero, as to the lor
e>g-> pension systems, and of an per
sonal observation of their practical workings, du
lr imported lo the Government.
The business of this Bureau is in a favorable
coioiiiou, though, for reasons already stated, not
brought up as closely as was hoped at tbe date of
mj last annual report. Ihe number of cases dis
posed ofdnriug tbe fiscal year, without any mate
rial Increase of ihe clerical force, was greater by
about nnc-fourth than during the year preceding.
The labor devolving npon tbe Pension Office
du ing the current year will be nearly or quite
double ihai of any previous year since my con
nection with It. As a consequence without tbe
►utgi-Mvd re-o'ganizattou and increase of force,
the business must Inevitably fall very much in ar
rtari*.
Earnestly deprecating such a result it is my
earnest hope that Congress, at its approaching
session, will take prompt action on tbi* subject.
1 have the honor to ue very respcc'fully,

demonstrates beyond question that the route is
eminently feasible for constructing a first-class
canal.
y.vso/rtd. That tbe construction of this canal,
with a navigable feeder to Sterling aod Dixon, to
gether with the improvement of the niluoU and
Rock Rivers, opening np a grand system of in
ternal navigation, and completing the connection
by water between theMissis-ippiand tbe lakes on
the line of the greatest continental commerce, aie
works of Immediate and lasting importance, the

be derived from them when completed, as well as
to insure cheap transportation to tbe people, wc
are decidedly and emphatically in favor of their

GRIFFITH GAUNT.
. The production of the new sensjuon drama
” Griffith Gaunt” at two diflercut theatres on the
fame evening, created a general cariosity regard
ing It, and despite the bad weather both places
were well attended. The version given at the
Museum is the one executed by Augustin Paly, of
New York, and presented snccessiullyln that city.
That giv.n at McVlcko.-’s Is a dramatization by
Mr. Gcoige J- Aiken, of the Museum. Both
versions while differing materially tbo one
from the other, present a pretty close ap
proximation to tbe plot of Charles IP ad o s
novel. In both much is omitted, and
a coed deal added. The story itself, as given at
(lie Museum, is somewhat intricate and scarcely
admits of such close conicoiiailon as we are com-
pelted,'for want of spate, to give it. Griffith
(taunt is a young man who gets into serious
matrimonial difficulties. He marries a vonng
hcitcss with large estates, hut with stronger reli
gions tendencies than is agreeable to the taste of
i>er hatband. Troubles soon arise. He Is fond
of hunting and amusement, she of fasting and
devotional exercises. A young father Confessor
appears on the scene, and tbe Jcaloos Griffith,
mistaking a pure Platonic mutual regard which
exists between Urn and bis wife, denounces the
latter as a wanton, Cees to a distant shore, and
turns up in a dying condition, ala country inn.
Here be becomes enamored of the landlord’s
daughter who tends bun in his sickness, and
marries her under an* assumed name. But the
secret la discovered by m.-aua of a wandering
piddKr. a kird of relative of the Gaunt family,
and tbe first Mrs. Gaunt comes to bear of it This
occsrioos trouble enough, aid excites tbo anger
of the injured lady to suen a pitch of frenzy that
she threaten* to kill him. Strangely enough a
murder }* done that very night, and subsequent
ly a body is found in tbo lake, which is
supposed ’to be that of Griffith Gannlr The
wjfc is tried (or the murder ot her husband, and
is iu*-t about to be convicted, when to the general
joj-of all. Griffith reaj>pcarji. aiivo and well. I
wa« not him. but the aforesaid peddler, who had
been drowned, and whose dead face bore some
resemblance to bis relative. So everything ends
happily for all except the unfortunate second
vile, of whom nothing morels heard. The play
Is full of incident, and moves along with a rapid
action, disclosing scenes of pathos and of mirth in
every act.
Tbe play was produced at the Mttfteam last
night with pre-eminent success. It weal off ad
mirably, and thoroughly enlisted tbe sympathies
of the audience. Indeed, w-have rot recently
witnessed any performance al this theatre which
was so nMy and so equally MiMaincd. Each mem
ber of lb e corps seemed to have the
verypait culled to his capacity, and without an
exception every pait was rendered with point
and spirit. We have not space to characterize
separately Ihe acting of each of ihc parts, yet we
cannot omit tQnotc the very importau> aid given to
the whole representation by the excellent scenery
produced bv Mr. Voegtlin,the scenic artist. Great
ca>c. as well as superior artistic power, is manl
fesi in crerv scene. Particularly is this shown In
the Fair seme, which la a prominent feature of
the plav, and where so much depends upon the
surroundings. The sepornotueraries were ail
well drilled, 100, and tbe whole scene was a realt
ratio’ ot the old-fashioned English Country Fair.
Griffith promise- to be a taking piece, and will
doub’iess oold the stage longer than the present
week.
Al McVickcr's Theatre the play Is a more lit
eral itanscnpttou of the novel, yet there la a
much closer similarity in the two than might be
exported In two independently written sketches
of the one Ihrrae. The pterc at McVtckes’s I
well put on the stage, but it lacks tbe Fair scene,
with its oddities, which impart so much of inter
est lo the Museum version. Tbe part ol Griffith
Gannt is taken by Mr. (anrence Barrett, who is
well known here from his inimitable delineation
of ‘'Elliot Grey,” in “Roscdalc,” and other char
acters. He sustained the part In an admirable
manner, exhibiting all the hre and energy which
the most fffstidlons critic could desire, yet wita
onl oVrstepping (he bounds of the natural. Ho
was Indifferently well supported. We shall speak
more al length hercaiter.
