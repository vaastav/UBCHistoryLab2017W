The President’s Message.
Congress met on Monday and ad
journed On Tuesday the Message
of the President was laid before both
houses and read. The Message is
very long, and notwithstanding its
length, the larger part of it seems
necessary to lay before the country
what may properly be termed the
nation’s business. This is presented
in a business like way. This said,
Mr Harrison sinks into virtual
obscurity. No element of states
manship will ever be imputed to him
by the future historian. He dies as
it were murmuring tariff! An im
mense array of figures is brought
forward to prove the greatuess and
prosperity of the country by the
gains in wealth it has made; 50, 100
and 200 per cent of increase is shown
in the various lines of business
Admitting that the statistics of this
great national increase of wealth are
all true, which Mr. Harrison brings
to his support, who holds this vast
accumulation of wealth f Is the
bulk of it in the hands of fifty mil
lion of the people ? No. It is in
the hands of a few thousand persons.
Poes wealth in this condition consti
tute the greatness of a nation ? No.
Every nation in history has shown
these symptoms exactly in its decay.
Vet Mr. Harrison seems to think this
is a proof of national greatness, and
a prosperous people, and this unpar
alleled prosperity is almost wholly
owing to the “protective policy.”
Our President is a pains taking
lawyer and careful politician. His
last annual message shows this in
every line. As a student of economic
questions he reveals not a single
trace. Of statesmanship he appears
wholly oblivious. Wages are high
and all classes are on the high tide
of prosperity the Message affirms,
except the farmers. The President
does make a partial exception in
their case, but it s the decree of
Providence, and they should bear
their burdens meekly ! This appears
to be about what Mr. Harrison thinks
of their case.
As a business document the Mes.
sage is exceptionally good ; as a
state paper it is pitiable in the
extreme. But if any one believes
that Mr. Cleveland’s Messages will
rise one iota above President liar
rison’s last Message, he is doomed to
disappointment. They may be couch
ed in more ornate and ponderous
sentences, but in statesmanship they
will not rise a particle higher, while
in perspicuity and business state
ment they wili fall short. And these
are the kind of men we delight to
honor as President of this great
Nation.
Jay Gould Dead.
On last Saturday morning the papers
announced the death of Jay Gould. He
was 50 years too late in dying for the good
of the generation in which he lived. There
is not a paper in the laud had a good word
for his memory, but were unanimous in the
belief that not a tear outside of his own
family was shed for him. Gould was un
doubtedly the greatest scoundrel that Amer
ica ever produced.
The danger of such characters lies more
in the conditions that permit them to inflict
barm on individuals and the community,
than their inclination and natural abilities.
Had our railroads and telegraph not been
placed in the hands of gamblers such mon
strous wrongs as Gould committed never
could have happened. When they are
restored to the people, to whom they nat
urally belong, by placing them under gov
ernment control, such brigandage as Gould
carried on would be impossible.
The results which are springing up from
such conditions, will be crushed in the
not distant future either by the civil power,
or the red band of revolution. We have
already three families established in this
country, the poison fruit of these evil con
ditions, whose founders have arranged to
perpetuate themselves; the Astors, the
Vanderbilts and lastly the Goulds. These
great estates are to be kept together and
added to by the immense incomes of the
properly their founders have grabbed ; aud
if they can inanage to sustain themselves
two or three generations, further bought
privileges from the government, through
bribery of the representatives or “seryants”
whom the people trust with power to harm,
will find their descendents wearing titles,
created by law and conducting themselves
as a privileged class, publicly acknowledged
as such, which iu fact they are already
silently exercising.
There are rnaoy others aiming to achieve
the same power and distinction and by the
same methods, so that year by year this class
of Mammon aristocracy will strengthen
itself for mutal protection by incteasing its
numbers. The railroad, mines, gold banks
and land monopolies are the breeding beds
of Jour future aristocracy, and unless the
people use the ballot more wisely than they
have done in (his generation, they will Unit
themselves confronted by a Triumphant
Plutocratic class with the government and
its army aud navy in their hands, ready to
dispute the right of the people when they
attempt to assert their claims as the source
of all power in which government is lodged.
I f this is doubled the following answer ol
one of this Plutocratic class ought to satisfy
the most skeptical.
Collis P. Huntington, when asked whit
effect in his opinion, Mr. Gould’s death
would have on Wall strecl, said : “None
whatever. Men are individuals; property
•Joei not die. Mr. Gould’s property is left
in just the same shape as it was before his
death, and George Gould is perfectly com
petent to take up the burden where his
gather laid it down.”
THE J'OTTB/IET.A.Ij : FBIDAT, DBOEMTrBtT?, 9, 1892.
Probable Collapse of the S. L. P.
Paper.
The last issue of The People , the leading— |
and as that paper claims to be, the only <
simon pure Socialist paper published in the
English language at least, in this country— I
announces the probable discontinuance of <
the paper on account of insufficient support. <
We cannot say that its suspension would he I
a loss to the reform cause in the long run.
Eike the fabled cow which gave a generous 1
pail of milk but always managed to kick it
over, The I‘cople is yety badly informed on i
some of the most important phases of the I
reform movement, and what makes it a
dangerous adviser to the class it talks for,
it believes its judgment infallible, informa
tion always reliable and its deductions
beyond the possibility of error. The Peo
ple’s party is nearly always alluded to with
a sneer of contempt, as a “small farmers”
party and the principles of the party as all
“class 1 ’ measures, that the laboring class is
never mentioned but ignored, and that the
“small farmers” are nothing more than a
branch of the Capitalistic class, and great
deal more of such misinformation and
erroneous conclusions are weekly placed
before its readers. The honest errors of
The People make it a danger to its party
and the cause it so earnestly espouses, and a
virtual destroyer of the many valuable
trullies it presents and the information
which is gathered and digested in its col
umns. The entire misapprehension of the
status of the “small farmer” and the in
spiration which is impelling his leaders and
their broad minded knowledge of social
economic conditions, places The People in a
position which destroys to a large extent
the usefulness of its enterpise and teaching.
The approach between the living present
and the Elysian fields it directs the eyes of
its diciples to is barricaded by three insur
mountable obstacles which must be removed
before a single step in the direction of those
Elysian fields can ht taken, and these bar
ricades are the monopoly of money, the
monopoly of the telegraph and transporta
tion and the monopoly of unused land.
These three obstacles must be removed
before labor can even dream of the socialist’s
* Utopia - ” It will require the combined
effort of every division of the reform army
to remove these obstacles, before the labor
masses will he able to enjoy a glimpse of
the flowery vistas which stretch out in such
heavenly beauty beneath the eyes of the
eagles of socialism which soar in the sky
above the laboring masses who are confied
to the earth,
Such teachers as The People would mount
right up on eagle wings and sail into the
earthly paradise, without soiling -their
hands with the laborious and tedious work
of removing the barricades manned by
capital armed with the most improved
weapons that legal cunning and social
prestige, buttressed by the church, can
nevise. The People emulates the husband
man who, while he assiduously cultivates a
fruitful vine would plaut a cauker in its
roots. If The People is compelled to sus
pend it will he largely the architect of its
own destruction, it is leading its followers
away from the work that must first be done
before its future can even be brought within
sight of the most penetrating eyes of the
masses whom The People delights to term the
proletariat. The sans-culolte the Capital
istic gentry would say. Fraternity of reform
parties is as essential as fraterniy among
wealth producers, and the teachers who
have not learned this lesson are not fit to fill
the places they occupy. The People evi
dently has not learned it, and the mischief
ils course would cause, if its field was large
enough would out weigh the good. If The
People suspends we trust a successor will
orise and take ils place under wiser man
agement.
Teachers’ Salaries.
The teachers of public schools of
this county have complained, or have |
been complaining, for lo! these
many years, of the small salaries
they get. The complaint is founded
in justice, and the great mass of tax
payers of the county can justly com
plain of the small amount they have
to call their own after expenses nec
essery to secure that pittance have
been paid. The teachers are not
alone in their distress but hays a
large and respectable class associat
ed in misery with them. That these
stinted salaries should be padded by
an addition of several per cent is a
fact that none deny, but owing to
economic conditions which prevail
the tax payers feel that this addition
to the salaries cannot be made
Owing to the very small salary that
the best talent is not secured in the
school room is pretty evident, for
numbers of teachers are not compe
tent to make a correct repott ol their
work to the School Commissions,
which they are required to do. In
any future grading up of salaries
which may take place it should, in
view of this fact, be made a condi
tion of increase of salary, that the
teacher whose reports were not
properly made out should receive no
additional compensation.
It is also made a cause of com
plaint, and a strong plea for aa in
crease of salary, that young bacbe
lors discover the best talent among
the lady corps of teachers and offer
them permanent life partnerships
and steady work, and thug the
schools are depleted of their best
teachers, and that an increase of
salary would tend to check the
annual drain from this cause on ibe
schools. This is worth considering
and we commend it to the School
and County Commissioners.
We suggest for examination by
these bright minds who are employed
in instructing the children howto
think, if there wag more money in
the country if they wouldn't be more
likely to get some ol it through an
increase of salaries. This would
logically lead up to the question why
there isn’t more. A proper solution
of this question is the direct road to
an increase ot their salaries. Try it
teachers and send the Midland
Journal your conclusions for pub
lication.
Found a Dead Body.
Olho Foster while out gunning
found the dead body of a man in a
secluded piece of woods at Bacon
Hill, three miles from Elkton on
Saturday. Coroner Litzenbnrg ac
companied by several citizens repar
ed to the spot where the corpse was
found on Saturday.
The bare skull was found lying
under the arm, and a white silk
handkerchief was found in the coat
pocket, and a small penknife in the
pants’ pocket. Nothing whatever
was found by which the body could
be identified. The body was evident
ly that of a person in good circum
stances, being neatly dressed in a
black cheviot sack coat, woolen
shirt, gray striped pantaloons, dark
slouch (size 7J) hat, and almost a
new pair Congress gaiters.
The bead which was lying by his
side was entirely bare of flesh, &c.,
and the jaw bones were dislocated
Some dark brown hair was found
lying beside the head, which has
evidently been picked bare by buz
zards or some animal. The body
was very much decomposed and very
offensiye, and was that of a man of
about five feet and a half in height,
who in life weighed in the neighbor
hood of one hundred and sixty
pounds. Public opinion is divided
as to the cause of his death. Some
are strong in the opinion that the
man was murdered, and placed in
the lonely spot some distance from
the road way to conceal the crime,
the murderers first relieving the body
of any valuables that it might have
possessed; while others think that
the roan has been sick, and selected
the spot to lie down in and die. The
body when found was lying face
downward, with the legs crossed and
one arm raised, as if for a pillow for
the head. This fact alone, they
claim, shows that he bad not been
murdered, as the murderers would
not have taken the trouble to place
it in this position. The head, they
say, has been pulled from the body
by some animal or buzzard.
Those who believe in the theory of
murder claim the head could not be
severed from the body by buzzards,
no matter how much decomposed
the flesh had become.
The body was in such a state that
it was impossible to tell whether or
not it had any wounds on il, and the
case will probably always remain as
at present—a mystery.
The remains were buried in the
Almshouse cemetery at Cherry Hill.
They Took the Cake.
The Cecilton celebration over the
Celeveland election waß an affair of
large dimensions and took the cake,
beating out of sight all the hurrahs
in the county or surrounding territory
They had a least as was a feast.
Roast ox, roast turkey, chicken and
all the sundries were provided in
profusion. Three thousand five hun
dred hungry stomachs were filled,
so runs report, and several baskets of
fragments were distributed among
the poor after the feast had ended.
A number of ladies, mounted, rode
in line, while several wagons were
filled with the fair sex. William
Deshane was chief marshal and was
assisted by about 20 aids. That is
what we call doing the thing band,
some and is a hint to some folks who
live in the Sixth district to have
plenty of roast beef, turkeys,
chickens, potatoes, cabbage, pickles
and sich when they get up a parade.
As elections are mighty “uncartaiu”
things our advice would be to have
the feast before the election. Such
a spread might draw votes “power
ful.” And let it be known that the
man who gave the most liberally
would stand the best chance for the
post office. Some of the aspirants
would mortgage their places before
they would be out done.
Better Hoads.
A call for a road convention to
assemble in Baltimore, January 11th
has been issued. We hope it will
persuade the public and the farmers
that it is only a waste ot money to
have the latter playing at road
mending and that the only plan like
ly to succeed is a State system that
employes practical road builders,
working to specifications drawn by
civil engineers, who would bring a
scientific knowledge of that class of
business to the work.
Farmers’ organizations, road im
provement societies, the Md. League
of Wheelmen aud all other bodies
who want good roads are invited to
seDd delegates to the meeting.
A constitution and set of by-laws
will be drawn up for a permanent
State road improvement association,
which it is proposed to form and a
committee will be appointed to draw
a bill looking to the general improve
ment of Maryland's roads, which the
Legislature will be asked to pass.
Provision will be made for local
leagues in Ibe counties, and the
question of State aid to the counties
will be discussed.
The speech of President-elect Cleveland,
at the Villard dinner, which went the
rounds of the papers and was claimed by
the democrat papers as something extra
ordinary, revealed only one fact, which was
that Mr. Cleveland is a good deal bewil
dered about what he is going to propose
The speech was little else than a string of
glittering general promises or rather dec
laration of fine hopes. The following is a
sample paragraph ;
“Let us not be misled to our undoing by
other lights of false Democracy, which may
be kind led in broken faith, and which,
shining in hypocrisy, will, if followed, lure
us lo (he rocks of failure and disgrace. If
we see stern labor ahead of us, aud if dif
ficulties loom up ou our horizon, let us
remember that in the thickest weather the
mariner watches most anxiously for his (rue
light.”
There is absolutely nothing in (hi* but a
glitter of words.
