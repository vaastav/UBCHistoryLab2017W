WASHINGTON, Dec 7:— President
Cleveland's message was delivered to
congress shortly after 1 o'clock to
day. It was a long document contain
ing nearly 18,000 words, and the first
part of it was devoted largely to com
ment on the situation in Cuba and
praise for the policy of the United
States administration in connection
with that affair. It calls attention lo
the fact that the Cubans have lons
fcince practically abandoned any pre
tense of having a form of civil govern
ment and are not, therefore, in a
position to claim recognition, but it
also sounds a note of warning to Spain
relative to the cruelty and destruc
tiveness of her officers and soldiers.
The financial situation also receives
attention at the hands of the presi
dent, but the only recommendation is
a reiteration of the one that the gov
ernment's currency obligations should
be retired and canceled.
A summary of departmental reports
is also contained in the message, which
here follows:
To the Congress of the United States:
As representatives ol the people in the leg
islative branch of their government you have
assembled at a time when the strength and
excel.ence of our free institutions and the
fltneas of our citizens to enjoy popular rule
have been again made manifest. A political
contest involving momentous consequences,
fraught with feveiish apprehension and creat
ing aggressiveness so intense as to approach
bitterness and passion, has been waged
throughout our land and determined by the
decree of free-and independent suffrage, with
out disturbance of our tranquillity or the
least sign of weakness in our national struc
ture.
When wg consider these incidents and con-
Kmplate the peaceful obedience and maniy
suNjiission which have succeeded a heated
clash of political opinions, we discover abun
dant evidence of a determination on the part
of our countrymen to abide by every verdict
of the popular will, and to be controlled at ail
timed by an abiding faith in the agencies
established for the direction, of the affairs of
their government. Thus our people exhibit
a patriotic disposition which entitles them
to demand of those who undertake to make
and execute their laws such faithful and un
selfish servkp in their behalf as can only be
prompted by a serious appreciation of the
trust and confidence which the acceptance of
public duty invites.
In obedience to a constitutional requirement
I herein submit to the congress certain in
formation concerning national affairs with the
suggestion of such legislation as in my judg
ment is necessary and expedient. To secure
brevity ana avoid tiresome narration I shall
omit many details concerning matters within
federal control which though by no means
unimportant are more profitably discussed
In departmental reports. I shall also further
cunail this communication by omitting a min
ute recital of many minor incidents connected
with our foreign relations which have here
tofore found a place in executive messages,
but are now contained in a report of the
treasury of state, which is herewith sub
mitted.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Horrors of the Armenian Massacres
Rriefly Considered.
At the outset of a reference to the more im
portant matters affecting our relations with
foreign powers, it would afford me satisfaction
if I could assure the congress that the dis
turbed condition In Asiatic Turkey had dur
ing the past year arsumed a less hideous and
bloody aspect, and that either as a conse
quence of the awakening of the Turkish gov
ernment to the demand of humane civilization,
or as the result of decisive action on the part
of the great nations having the right by
treaty to interfere for the protection of those
exposed to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel
fanaticism, the shocking features of the situ
ation had besn mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a softened
disposition or protective intervention, we have
been afflicted by continued and not infrequent
reports of the wanton destruction of homes
and the bloody butchery of men. women and
children, made martyrs to their profession of
Christian faith.
While none of our citizens in Turkey have
thus far been killed or wounded, though
often in the midst of dreadful scenes of dan
ger, their safety in the future is by no means
assured. Our government at home and our
minister at Constantinople have left nothing
undone to protect our missionaries in Otto
man territory, who constitute nearly all the
individuals residing there who have a right
to claim our protection on the score of Amer
ican citizenship.
Our efforts in this direction will not be
relaxed; but the deep feeling and sympathy
that have been aroused among our people
ought not to so far blind their reaaon and
judgment as to lead them to demand Impos
sible things. The outbreaks of blind fury
which lead to murder and pillage In Turkey
occur suddenly and without notice and an
attempt on our part to force such a hostile
presence there as might be effective for pre
vention or protection would not only be re
sisted by the Ottoman government but would
be regarded as an interruption of their plans
by the great nations who assert their exclu
sive right to intervene in their own time and
method for the security of life and property
Several na-al vessels are stationed In the
Mediterranean as a measure of caution and
to furnish all possible relief and refuge in
case of emergency. We have made claims
against the Turkish government for the pil
lage and destruction of missionary property
at Harpoot and Marash during uprisings at
those places. Thus far the validity of these
demands have not been admitted, though our
minister, prior to such outrages and in an
ticipation of danger, demanded protection for
the persons and property of our missionary
citizens in the localities mentioned, and not
withstanding that strong evidence exists of
actual complicity of Turkish troops in the
work of destruction and robbery, the facts as
they now appear do not permit to doubt the
justice of these claims, and nothing will be
omitted to bring about their prompt settle
ment.
CUBAN REVOLT.
Warnine Conveyed to Spain In Con-
servative Words.
The Insurrection in Cuba stil! continues,
with all its perplexities. It is difficult to per
ceive that any progress has thus far been
made towards the pacification of lhe Island,
or that the situation of afTairs as depicted in
my last annual message has in the least
improved. If Spain still holds Havana and
the seaports and all the considerable towns,
the insurgents still roam at will over at
least two-thirds of the inland country. If
the determination of Spain to put down the
insurrection seems but to strengthen with the
lapse of time, and is evinced by her un
hesitating devotion of largely increased mili
tary and naval forces to the task, there Is
much reason to believe tbat the insurgents
have gained in point of number and character
and resources, and are none the less in
flexible in their resolve not to succumb
without practically securing the great objects
for which they took up arms.
If Spain has not yet re-established her
TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8, 1896.
authority, neither have the Insurgents yet
made their title to be regarded as an Inde
pendent statj. Indeed, as the contest has
gone on, the pretense that civil government
exists on the island, except so far as Spain
Is able to maintain it, haa been practically
abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such
a government, more or less Imperfectly, In
the large towns and their immediate suburbs,
but that exception being made, the entire
country Is either given over to anarchy or
is subject to the military occupation of one
or the other party. It is reported, indeed,
on reliable authority that at the demand of
the commander-ln-chief of the insurgent
army the putative Cuban government has
now given up all attempt to exercise its func
tions, leaving the government confessedly
(what there Is the best reason for supposing
it always to have been in fact) a government
merely on paper. Were the Spanish armies able
to meet their antagonists in the open or in
pitched battles, prompt and decisive results
might be looked for, and the immense su
periority of the Spanish forces In numbers,
discipline and equipment could hardly fail to
tell greatly to their advantage.
But they are called upon to face a foe that
shuns general engagements, that can choose
and does choose Its own ground, that from
the nature of the country is visible or in
visible at pleasure, and that fights only from
ambuscade and when all the advantages of
position and numbers are on its side. In
a country where all that is indespensable to
life in the way of food, clothing and shelter
is so easily obtainable, especially by those
born and bred on the soil, it is obvious that
there Is hardly a limit to the time during
which hostilities of this sort may be pro
longed. Meanwhile as in all cases of protract
ed civil strife, the passions of the acombatants
grow more and more inflamed, and excesses
on both sides become more frequent and more
deplorable.
BANDS OF MARAUDERS.
These are also participated in by bands of
marauders, now in the name of one party,
and now in the name of the other, as may
best suit the occasion, harry the country at
will, and plunder its wretched inhabitants for
their own advantage. Such a condition of
things would inevitably entail Immense de
struction of property, even if it were the
policy of both parties to prevent it as far as
practicable. But while such seemed to be the
original policy of Spanish government, it has
now apparently abandoned it, and is acting
upon the same theory as the insurgents,
namely, that the exigencies of the contest re
quire the wholesale annihilation of property
that it may not prove of use and advantage
to the enemy.
It is to the same end that in pursuance of
general orders, Spanish squadrons are now
being withdrawn from plantations, and the
rural population required to concentrate itself
in the towns. The sure result would seem to
be that the industrial value of the island is
fast diminishing. And that unless there Is a
speedy and radical change in existing condi
tions, it will soon disappear altogether. That
value consists very largely, of course, in its
capacity to produce sugar, a capacity al
ready much reduced by the interruptions to
the tillage which have taken place during the
last two years. It is reliably asserted that
should these Interruptions continue during
the current year, and practically extend, as
Is now threatened, to the entire sugar produc
ing territory of the island, so much time and
so much money will be required to restore the
land to its normal productiveness, that it is
extremely doubtful if capital can be induced
to even make the attempt.
The spectacle of utter ruin of an adjoining
country, by nature one of the most fertile
and charming on the globe, would engage
the serious attention of the government and
the people of the United States in any cir
cumstances. In point of fact, they have a
concern with It which is by no means of a
wholly sentimental or philanthropic character.
It lies co near to us as to be hardly separated
from our territory.
Our actuaJ pecuniary interest in It Is second
only to that of people of the government of
Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at
least from $30,000,000 to $50,000,000 of American
capital are invested in plantations, and in
railroad, mining and other business enter
prises in the island. The value of trade be
tween the United States and Cuba, which in
1889 amounted to about $64,000,000, rose in
1893 to about $103,000,000, and in 1894, the year
before the present insurrection broke out,
amounted to nearly $96,000,000. Besides this
large pecuniary stake in the fortunes of Cuba,
the United States finds itself inextricably in
volved in the present contest in other ways,
both vexatious and costly.
SENTIMENT IN AMERICA.
Many Cubans reside In this country and
Indirectly promote the insurrection through
out the press by public meetings, by the pur
chase and shipment of arms, by the raising
of funds, and by other means, which the spir
it of our Institutions and the tenor of our
laws do not permit to be made the subject of
criminal prosecution, some of them, though
Cubans at heart, and in all their feelings and
interests, have taken out papers as natural
ized citizens of the United States, a proceed
ing resorted to with a view to possible pro
tection by this government, and not unnatur
ally regarded with much indignation by the
country of their origin.
The Insurgents are undoubtedly encouraged
and supported, by the widespread sympathy of
the people of this country who always and in
stinctively feel for every struggle for better
and freer government, and which in the case
of the more adventurous and restless elements
of our population leads in only too many in
stances to active participation in the
contest. The result is that this government
Is constantly called upon to protect American
citizens who claim damages for injuries to
persons and property, now estimated at many
millions of dollars, and to ask explanations
and apologies for the acts of Spanish officials,
whose zeal for the repression of rebellion
sometimes blinds them to the immunities be
longing to the unoffending citizens of a
friendly power. It follows from the same
causes that the United States is compelled
to actively police along its line of seacoast
against unlawful expeditions, the escape of
which the utmost vigilance will not always
suffice to prevent. These Inevitable entangle
ments of the U. S., with the rebellion in Cuba,
the large American property interests affected,
and considerations of philanthrophy and
humanity in general, have led to a vehement
demand in various quarters for some sort of
positive intervention on the part of the United
States.
It wa^ at first proposed that belligerent
rights should be accorded to the insurgents —
a proposition no longer urged because un
timely an in practical operation clearly
perilous and injurious to our own Interests.
It has since been and is now sometimes con
tended that the Independence of the insurg
ents should be recognized. But imperfect and
restricted as the Spanish government of the
island may be, no other exists there — unless
the will of the military officer in temporary
command of a particular district can be dig
nified as a species of government. It 1» now
also suggested that the United States should
buy the island— a suggestion possibly worthy
of consideration if there were any evidence
of a desire or willingness on the part of Spain
to entertain such a proposal. It is urged,
finally, that, all other methods failing, the
existing internecine strife in Cuba should
be terminated by our Intervention, even at the
cost of a war between the United States and
Spain— a war which its advocates confidently
prophesy, could be neither large in Its pro
portions nor doubtful in its issue.
The correctness of this forecast need be
neither affirmed nor denied. The United
States has nevertheless a. character to main
tain as a nation, which plainly dictates that
right and not might should be the rules of
'A PACIFIC POWER.
Further, though the United States is not a
nation to which peace is a necessity, it is
In truth tbe most pacific of powers, and de
sires nothing so much as to live In amity
with all the world. Its own ample and diver
sified domains satisfy all possible longings
for territory, preclude all dreams of conquest,
and prevent any casting of covetous eyes
upon neighboring regions, however attractive.
That our conduct towards Spain and her
dominions has constituted no exception to this
national disposition is made manifest by the
course of our government, not only thus far
during the present insurrection, but during
the ten years that followed the rising at
Yara in 1868.
No other great power, it may safely be.
said, under circumstances of similar perplex
ity, would have manifested the same re
straint and the same patient endurance, It
may also be said that this persistent attitude
of the United States towards Spain in con
nection with Cuba, unquestionably evince«
r.o slight respect and regard for Spain on the
part of the American people. They in truth
do not forget her connection with the dis
covery of the Western hemisphere, nor do
they underestimate the great qualities of the
Spanish people, nor fail to fully recognize
their splendid patriotism and their chivalrous
devotion to the rational honor.
They view with wonder and admiration the
cheerful resolution with which vast bodies of
men are sent across thousands of miles of
ocean and an enormous debt accumulated
that the coetly possession of the gem of the
t Antilles may still hold its place In the Span
ish crown. And if neither the government
nor the people of the United States have
shut their eyes to the course of events in
Cuba or have failed to realize the existence
of conceded grievances which have led to the

the members of the Minnesota delega
tion except Representatives McCleary
and Eddy were in their seats when
Speaker Reed's gavel fell at noon to
day. Representatives Fletcher and
Tawney were well remembered with
floral tokens of various kinds. It ia
said that Mr. Eddy stopped over at
Canton to visit President-Elect Mc-
Kinley on his way East and will be
here in a few days. Representatives
Johnson, of North Dakota, and Pick

The reassembling of congress for the
closing session of the Fifty-fourth con
gress, was an occasion of unusual bril
liancy and interest. The opening days
are always a gala affair, marking as
they do the official inauguration of
the social, as well as the political sea
son in Washington, but today it was all
the more interesting, because of th?
long and hard fought political battle
that had been waged during the recess.
The weather was perfect, clear and
fairly warm. The throngs who
streamed up the hill to witness the
opening ceremonies formed an unor
ganized civic pageant. Gay equip
ages with a rattle of chains, drawn by
prancing steeds, conveyed the diplo
mats, the fashionables and the more
prominent in official life. These ele
gant turn-outs moved sjde by aide with
one horse ramshackle cabs and other
nondescript two wheelers conveying
legislators and visitors. The unnum
bered thousands moved up Pennsyl
vania avenue on foot or in street cars.
The corridors and galleries were soon
thronged. There were demonstrations
for conspicuously prominent statesman
and at last came the drop of the gavel,
and the regular ceremonies attending
the opening of the session, and the re
ception of the presides »'s annual com
munication to congress.
SENATE SESSION.
Opening: Day Devoted Entirely to
the President's Message.
WASHINGTON/ Dec. 7.-The United
States senate began the second ses
sion of the Fifty-fourth congress with
crowded galleries and with that ac
companiment of activity and of greet
ing that usually attends the reassem
bling of congress. But the upper
branch of congress never puts aside Its
dignity and the meeting developed no
demonstrations of dramatic incidents
The reading of the president's mes
sage was the feature of the proceed^
ings, and beyond this, no attempt was
made to enter upon the business of th<=>
session. To many of the foreign rep
resentatives occupying the diplomatic
gallery, the message had a special in
terest and significance, owing to the
part they had taken in the conspic
uous foreign events to which the
president referred. Sir Julian Paun
cefote, the British arabass-ador. and
the new Turkish minister, Moustapha
Bey, were present.
Senor Dupuy d& Lome, the Spanish
minister, was not in attendance during
the day, but two of the secretaries or
the Spanish legation carefully noted
the references to the Cuban conflict.
•Minister Hatch, of Hawaii, and Mr.
Cooper, the Hawaiian minister of
foreign affairs, were listeners, although
the message contained no reference to
WARD M'ALLISTER^S SUCCESSOR.
Mies de Barril has b^fen elected by the
Patriarchs to fill the place of Ward McAllister.
The Patriarch* decided that there must be
some one ' person selected to attend to the
details of their future functions. Miss de
Barril has been their choice.
the Hawaiian island*. The diplomatic
gallery Avas vacated as soon as the
foreign questions referred to In the
message had been read.
OrP* the floor of the, senate, printed
copies of the message Were distributed
and these gave the oppor
tunity to read the salient features In
stead of listening to them. As a result
there was scant attention after th«
reading haa proceeded beyond the first
half hour. The reading of the message
covered one hour and fifty minutes.
The senate chamber was a center
of interest long before the
hour for assembling had ar
rived, and, by 11 o'clock,
the public galleries had been filled and
crowds were at the entrance unable to
gain admission. Sir Julian Paunce
fote, accompanied by members of his
staff, and several members of his
diplomatic corps, were in the galleries
reserved for foreign representatives,
and, with them were several ladies
bearing cards from Secretary Olney.
In the seats reserved for the vice
president's family and friends, sat Mrs.
Stevenson and several ladies. Back of
them in the seats reserved for the fam
ilies of senators were many of the
wives and daughters of those promin
ent on the floor. The gallery crowds
found ease and comfort in the new
theater seats since the last session, al
though it resulted in reducing the
seating capacity almost one-half.
The senators were rather late in ar
riving. Senator Palmer, (dem., 111.),
came about 11:30, and was a center of
interest from the galleries, owing to
his prominence in the recent campaign.
Mr. Tillman, (dem., S. C), also came
in for considerable attention as he
wi-nt to his desk, and busied himself
writing. There was plenty of color to
greet the senator, for the floor of the
chamber looked like a conservatory,
with many of the desks beari/ig sup
erb decorations. The senate officials
were quick to note that the tributes
stood "16 to 1," sixteen being on the
republican side and one on the demo
cratic side, although this proportion
was broken as many democratic tri
butes were brought in just as the ses
sion opened. One for Mr. Walthall
(dem.. Miss.), showed a graceful, floral
crescent bearing the word "Mississ
ippi." Other offerings were to Messrs.
Cullom, Allison, Proctor, Mantle and
Thurston, and to Messrs. Vest, Smith,
Blackburn, Pasco, Morgan and Voor
hees. The latter received a superb tri
bute of pink and yellow roses.
SENATE CALLED TO ORDER.
Exactly at 12 the vice president en
tered the chamber, and going to the
desk of the presiding officer, gave a tap
which brought the senate to order,
while the blind chaplain. Rev. Dr. Mil
burn, delivered an impressive invoca
tion.
The chaplain referred feelingly to
the illness of Mr. Allison, and be
sought his speedy restoration to health.
He spoke of the recent exciting po
litical contest through which the coun
try had passed, marked, he said, by a
freedom from much of the rancor and
scandal monging of former years and
by a quick and calm acceptance of the
result by the whole nation, with all
nations, prosperity to our industries
and the upbuilding of all our people in
the grand brotherhood of American
citizenship, were eloquently invoked.
The roll call showed seventy senators
present. Mr. Cullom was the first to
receive recognition, and his resolu
tion that the house of representatives
be notified that the senate was in ses
sion and ready to proceed witm busi
ness was agreed to without comment.
Mr. Hale followed with a resolution
that the hour for daily meeting be 12
ni., which was agreed to. Mr. Sherman
made the customary motion for a com
mittee of senators and members to
wait upon the president, and upon
adoption, the presiding officer named
Mr. Sherman and Mr. Smith (dem. N.
•J.) as the senators of the committee.
Mr. Morrill (rep. Vt.) was the first
to suggest anything in the nature of
legislative business by presenting sev
eral petitions asking for the passage
of the Dingley bill. He yielded, how
ever, to Mr. Hoar's suggestion that all
business be deferred as a matter of
courtesy until the president and house
of representatives had been communi
cated with, and thereupon, at 12:15 p.
m. the senate took a recess until 1
o'clock.
At 1 o'clock, there was a further re
cess for thirty minutes, and then an
other for fifteen minutes. At 1:45 Sen
ator Sherman reported that the presi
dent had been waited upon and would
communicate his views in writing.
Secretary Pruden, of the White house
staff, immediately stepped forward,
message in hand, and made the for
mal announcement of a communica-
tion from the president. It was taken
to the presiding officer's desk, where
the seal was broken, and there upon
Gen. Cox, secretary of the senate be
gan reading the document. Most of
the " senators remained in their seats
while the reading of the message pro
ceeded, and followed it with much in
terest. Printed copies were distributed,
and the senators ran through these,
picking out the salient features. The
Turkish minister, accompanied by his
secretary and an attache, entered the
gallery shortly before the clerk read the
president's words as to prospective
action to stop Turkish indignities,
which shocked the civilized world.
After the first hour of the reading
the reserved galleries were well nigh
empty and the senators^-who had run
through the prinjed copies, turned to
other business whispering groups, and
retiring to the cloak rooms. Mr. Mor
gan, who was prominent during the
Cuban debate of the last session, made

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.— For the
first time within the memory of old
officials, the secretary of state has
made a regular report to the presi
dent, for transmission to congress, like
the reports of other officers of the cat)
inet This report was laid before con
gress today as an appendix to the
president's message. It treats of many
details of our relations during the past I
year with foreign governments that
tither were not touched upon in the
message or were mere briefly treated.
Under the head of Spain, Secretary
Olney has much to say In regard to
Cuba, and in his report he sets out in
great detail the history of the growth
of the rebellion, the present evil state
of affairs on the island and other facts
upon which the president bases his
broad statements and conclusion. No
reference is made to a report from
Consul General Lee, but the secretary
intimates that this information comes
principally from the United States con
suls, and so must be regarded as con
fidential as to its source. The secre
tary's estimate of the present situa
tion, is disclosed in the following para
graph, made after a preliminary state
ment of the destruction of the indus
trial resources of Cuba:
"From whatever point of view we regard
the matter, it is impossible not to discern that
a state of things exists at our doors, alike
dangerous to good relations, destructive of
legitimate commerce, fatal to the internal
resources of Cuba, and most vexatious and
trying, because entailing upon this govern
ment excessive burdens in its domestic ad
ministration and in its outward relations
This situation cannot indefinitely continue
without growing still worse, and the time
may not be far distant when the United
States must seriously consider whether its
rights and interests, as well as its interna
tional duties, in view of its peculiar relations
to the island, do not call for some decided
change In the policy hitherto pursued."
To begin with, the secretary makes
it plain that the present insurrection
is far more formidable than the famous
"ten-year insurrection," which began
In 1868. He says that startling in the
same portion of the island, it very
early took proportions beyond its pre
decessor and therewith assumed an
aggressive phase. Passing the defen
sive lines or trochas, traversing the
island from north to the south, for
midable bodies of the revolutionary
forces early in the year established
themselves in the rich sugar planting
district of Santa Clara and Cienfuegos,
made hostile iorays almost in sight of
I Havana itself, and advancing west
ward effected a lodgment in the fertile
tobacco fields of Pinar del Rio, which
has so far resisted all efforts of the
Spanish forces to overcome.
GUERRILLA WARFARE.
The secretary says that while no
prominent seaport has been attacked
by the Insurgents, a large part of the
2,200 miles of sea-coast is practically
in their hands, and from its rugged
and wild character, is peculiarly fitted
for guerilla warfare and affords easy
means of receiving clandestine sup
plies of men and arms. The secretary
adds:
"While thus, in fact, controlling the large
area of the whole Island of Cuba, frcm Cape
San Antonio to Cape Maisi, and enioylng
practically unlimited use of an equally* large
part of the coast, the revolutionary forces are
scattered, being nowhere united for any
length of time to form an army capable of
attack or siege, and fit to take the defen
sive In a pitched battle. Assembling sud
denly at a given point often in a single
night, they make unexpected sallies or carry
destruction to the tobacco and cane fields of
Cuba, and at first signs of pursuit or organ
ized assault, they disperse only to reassemble
In like manner at some other spot."
As bearing upon the question of the
recognition of the insurgents, prob
ably soon to come before congress. In
some shape, the following statement by
Secretary Olney is of importance, as
explaining his reasons for declining
recognition:
"So far as our information shows there is
not only no effective government by the in
surgents In the territories they overrun, but
there Is not even a tangible pretense to es
tablish admistration anywhere. Their or
ganization, confined to the shifting exigencies I
of the military operations of the hour, is
nomadic, without definite centers and lacking
the most elementary features of government.
There nowhere appears the nucleus of state
hood. The machinery for exercising the le
gitimate rights and powers of the sovereign
ty and responding to the obligations which
de facto sovereignty entails In the face of
equal rights of other states, is conspicuously
lacking. It is not possible to discern a homo- ■
geneous political entity of possessing and ex- j
ercising the functions of administration and ]
capable, if left to itself, of maintaining or i
derly government In its own territory, and ;
sustaining normal relations with the external i
family of governments."
The secretary illustrates his point as
to the Irresponsibility of the insurgents
by citing their destruction of Ameri- j
can plantations and the oppression of !
American planters who grind cane, i
which he characterizes as acts of an
archy. On the other hand he shows
that in the capital cities and seaports
and all parts of the island with which
the United States or its citizens main- I
tain legitimate normal intercourse, the
Spanish power is supreme, though
often exercised in a vexatious and arbi
trary way, calling for just remon- j
strance, and most of the functions of I
government proceed as in time of peace.
SIGNIFICANT STATEMENTS.
Recurring to his comparison of this
insurrection with those that have pre
ceded It, Secretary Olney makes this
significant statement:
From every accessible indication It is clear
that the present rebellion is on a far more
formidable scale as to numbers, intelligence
and representative features than any of the
preceding revolts of this century; that the
corresponding effort of Spain for its repres
sion has been enormously augmented; and
that, despite the Important influx of fresh
armies and material of war from the metrop
olis, the rebellion, after nearly two years of
successful resistance, appears today to be
in a conditoin to indefinitely prolong the con
test on its present lines.
He also compliments the tactical skill
displayed by the leaders of the insur
rection, saying that when the disparity
of numbers 'and the comparatively in
defensible character of the central and
Western Vega, country are considered,
the passage of a considerable force into
Pinar del Rio, followed by its success
ful maintenance there for many
months, must be regarded as a mili
tary success of a pronounced character.
He adds:
Ths insurgent armies fairly represent the
intelligent aspirations of a large proportion
of the people of the whole island; and it is
shown thai they propose to wage this con
test, on these better grounds of vantage, to
the end and to make the present struggle
a supreme test of the capacity of the Cuban
people to win for themselves and their chil
dren the heritage of self-government.
The secretary speaks of the appalling
phases of the struggle such aa often
appear in contests among the Latin
races of the Western hemisphere; o{

the excesses and forceful and arbitrary
acts of the military, of the ravaging of
private property, the violation of prfn
ciples of civilized warfore by irrespon
sible officials and the killing of non
combatants, In some instances, happily
few, of American citizens. He saja.-
A large part of the correspondence of the
state department with its agen.s in Cuba has
been devoted to these case* of assault upon the
rights of our citizens. In no instance has
earnest remonstrance and energetic appeal
been omitted, but the representatives of the
Spanish power often find It easily practicable
to postpone explanations on the ground of -
al eged Ignorance of facts or for other plaus
ible reasons.
The secretary next treats at length of
the financial and industrial losses in
flicted upon American citizens by the
continuance of the strife, all of which
is summed up concisely by the presi
dent in a portion of his message That
part of the report devoted to Cuba con
cludes with a brief statement of the
Competitor" case which, it appear
has now been remanded by the Madrid*
authorities for re-trial and a statement
of the dissent of the state department
from the requirement of the governor
general of Cuba that all aliens in Cuba
shall be registered within a certain
time under pain of disbarment from the
protection of law.
VENEZUELAN BOUNDARY.
Secretary Olney says very litUe more
than does the president in his message
respecting the Venezuelan boundary
question. He announces with gratifi
cation that amicable counsels have pre
vailed to induce a satisfactory result ot
the attempts at an understanding that
the boundary question and its associ
ated phases have been at last elimf
j nated as between this country and
England. He gives, however, no Ink
ling of the nature of the treaty beyond
the statement that it provides for hon
orable arbitration of the whole contr^
versy. Touching the negotiations for
a general arbitration treaty for the set
tlement of all future disputes between
the United States and Great Britain,
Secretary Olney says both countries*
have given repeated proofs of their ac
quiesence in the great principle in
volved, not only by the relations be
tween themselves, but severally by
concluding like adjustments with other
powers for the adjudication of dis
putes resting on law and fact. The
subject was naturally approached in a
benevolent spirit of agreement, and
the negotiations have so satisfactorily
progressed as to foreshadow a prac
tical agreement at an early date upon
the text of a convention to the desired
end.
The secretary expresses regret that
the British government has refused 'ta
concurrence in a proposed international
commission to devise means of pro
tecting the seal herds; recites 'he
findings of the experts, In effect show
ing that the herd is threatened with
total destruction unless changes aro
made speedily In the award regulations
and hopes that the experts' report will
induce the British government to agree
upon these changes.
The report shows that negotiations
are in progress for a convention to lo
cate immediately that part of the Alas
kan boundary line along the one hun
dred and forty-first meridian by monu
ments and joint survey, while the pros
pects for the precise demarcation of
the ccast line boundary, are said to be
■ good, a preliminary survey having been
| completed and negotiations based on it
about to be undertaken. It is an
nounced that the assent of Great Brit
ain and other maritime state? having
been secured, th.c new rules for the
prevention of collisions at sea will go
into effect July 1 next. _
GERMAN EXCLUSION.
Under the head of Germany, the re
port treats briefly of the exclusion
frcm that country of* American -meat
products. The situation apparently re
mains unchanged and there . has been
no amelioration of the stringent meas
ures adopted by Germany, 'on assum
ed grounds of public health," against
our cattle. "On the contrary, says tht
secretary, "the disposition of Germany,
visible for a number of years past, tc
still further impede and virtually in
hibit this legitimate traffic is evidenced
: by fresh restrictive measures, national
! and local. Their unjustifiability and
the erroneousness of the supposed
premises on which they rest have again
been pointed out and the healthfulnesr
of cur exports supported by amply con
clusive proof."
Hawaii comes in for a single short
paragraph in the report, stating thai
no questions of importance hay«
arisen, that a few claims for indemnity
have been filed in behalf of United
States citizens arrested during the last
rebellion and that the final chapter in.
the history of that attempted revolt
was reached in the pardon of the ex
queen. Samoa is also brifly treated,. '
the situation being unchanged and the
United States necessarily continuing
to exercise all stipulated rights and
duties under the tripartite general act
of Berlin, during the continuance of
that compact, however Irksome and un
natural these rights and duties may
prove to be.
It is indicated th&t the United States
will appoint a successor to Chief Jus
tice Ide, who resigned.
An explanation of the difficulties that
arises in connection with the efforts
to protect United States naturalized
citizens, usually Jews, who return to
Russia, is set forth by the following
paragraph:
"Holding to the old doctrine of perpetual
allegiance; refusing to lessen its authority
by concluding any treaty recognizing the nat
uralization of a Russian subject without prior
consent; asserting the extreme right to pun
ish a naturalized Russian on return to his
native jurisdiction, not merely for unauthor
ized emigration, but also specifically for the
unperniitted acquisition of a foreign citizen
ship; and sedulously applying, at home and
i through the official acts of its agents abroad,
to all persons of the Jewish belief, the stern
restrictions enjoined by Ruaslan law. the
government of Russia takes ground not ad
mitting of acquiescence by the United States
I because at variance with the character ot
I cur institutions, the sentiments of our peo
i pie. the provisions of our statutes and the,
tendencies of modern international comity."
SUMMARIZED POINTS.
Other points in the report may be
i briefly summarized as follows:

Hale claim by offering to pay an indemnity;

of the work left unfinished by the Chilian
claims cominits'ion of 1894; the Chinese gov
ernment has settled all claims of Americana
by loss through the antl-forelgn riots and
