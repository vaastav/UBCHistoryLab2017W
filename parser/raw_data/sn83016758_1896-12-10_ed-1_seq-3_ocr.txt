WAR DEPARTMENT.
flie Exhibit Made the Secretary
I Regarded a Satisfactory.
The report of tne secretary of war ex
hibits satisfactory conditions In the several
branches of the public service intrusted to
his charge. The limit of our military force
as fixed by law is constantly ana" readily
Tnaintained. The*present discipline and mor
als of our ar my are excellent and marked
progress and efficiency are apparent through
out its entire organization.
With the exception of delicate duties In
-the suppression of slight Indian disturbances
alo ng our Southwestern boundary, In which
the Mexican troops co-operated and the
compulsory but peaceful return, with the
consent of Great Britain, of a band of Cree
Indians fr om Montana to the British pos
sessions, no active operations have been
required by the ar my during the year past.
i The organ
ed militia numbers 112,879
men. The appropriations for its support by
-i -th several states approximate $2,800,000
/-^'*annually, a nd $400,000 is contributed by the
V- general government. Investigati on shows
%$ these troops to be usually- drilled a nd in
i spired with much military interest, but in
many instances, they are so deficient in
^IM'" arms and equipment that a sudden
call to active duty wou ld find them lnad-
*J -equately prepared for field service. I there
for recommend that prompt measures be
,taken- to remedy th is condition an'dftthat
-every encouragement be given to this de
serving body of unpaid and voluntary clt-
,1zen soldiers, upon whose assistance we
must largely rely In time of trouble.
I W should always keep in mind that mil-
itary preparation is alone essentially paci
fic in its nature. While it giv es the sense
no
i$i&iti%d'
security due to a consciousness of
strength, it is neither the purpose nor the
effect of such permanent fortification to in
volve us in foreign complications, but rather
to guarantee us against them. They are
"not temptation to war, but security against
^lt. They are thoroughly in accord with alj
the traditions of Our national diplomacy.
POST-OFFICES AND POST ROADS.
CJreater Increase i Receipts than in
Expenditures.
Our postoffice departme nt is in good con
dition and the exhibit made of its opera
tions during the fiscal year endi ng June 30,
1896, if allowan ce is made for imperfections
in the laws applicable to it. is very satis
factory. The total receipts during the year
were $82,499,208.40. The total expenditures
were $90,626,298.48, exclusive of $1.5.Ty,.
J89S.27, which was earned by the Pacific rail
'road for transportation, a nd credited on
their debt to the government. There was
''.an increase of receipts over the previous
year of $5,516,080.21. or 7.1 per cent, and
an increase of expenditures of $3,836,124.02
or 4.42 per cent.
The deficit was $1,679,956.19 less than that
of the preceding year. The chief expendi
tures of the postal service are regulated by
law and are not in the control of the post
master general. All that he can accomplish
by the most watchful administration and
-economy is to enforce prompt and thorough
collection and accounting for public moneys
-and such minor savings in small expendi
tures and in letting tho se contracts for post
office supplies and star service whi ch are
F4
regulated by statute.
JXvf, The deficit for the last year, although
^jLf&is
muo less than that of the last a nd preced-
ing years, emphasizes the necessity for
"legislation to correctto the gowing abuse of
i "second-clas rates whi cr the deficiency
MS^V I mainly attributable.

I recommended that

be at once
to correct these abuss and iatro

a
---s vi duce better business ideas in the regulation
^yof our postal rates. Kxperience a nd obser
vati on have demonstrated that certain im
provements In the organization of the post
office department must be secured before
&4 we can gain the full benefit of the immense
y/Bi'ms expended in-its administration. This
vs. involves the following reforms, which I
s-er.nestly recommend:
There should be a small addition to the
^"-existing inspector service, to be employed
&$Mn the supervision of the carrier force,
which now numbers 13,000 men, a nd per
forms Its service practically without the
8iinelllor.ee exercised over all oth er branch-
|?-os of the postal or public service. Of course
e a lack of supervision a nd freedom fr om
W wholesome disciplinary restraints must in-
sAfrevitably lead to imperfect service. There
^should also be appointed a few inspectors
who should assist the central office in nec
essary Investigation concerning matters of
rt'Stofflce postoffice sites, allowances
for rent, fuel a nd h^hts, and in organizing
and securing the best results from the work
of the 14,000 clerks now employed in first
and second-class offices. I am convinced
that the small expense attendi ng the inaug
uration of these reforms would actually be'
a piofitable investment. I especially rec
omiiifrd such a recasting of the appropria^
tiins by congress to the postoffice depart
ment will perm it the postmaster general
proceed with the work of consolidating
postoffices. This work has aiready been en-
...-red upon sufficiently to fully demonstrate
experiment and experience that such
'J7*i fc* ".VYis'*wr-
consolidation Is productive of better serv
ice, larger revennes and less expenditures,
to say nothing of the further advantage of
gradually withdrawing postoffices from the
spoils system.

Ships the Best That Can Built a
Any Country.
The work of the navy department and its
condition are fully exhibited In the report
of the secretary. The construction of ves-,
sels for our new. navy has been energetical
ly prosecuted by the present administration,
upon the general lines previously adopted,
the department having seen no necessity for
radical changes in prior methods under
which the work was found to be progressing
in a manner highly satisfactory. I has been
decided, however, to provide in every ship
building contract that the builder should
pay all trial expenses, and it has also been
determined to pay no speed premiums in
furth er contracts. The premiums recently
earned and some yet to be decided are feat
ures of the contracts made before th is con
clusion was reached. A-*^ SH^.^
IJ INTERIOR DEPARTMENT^I^
The Remainder of Oar Public Land
Should Carefully Guarded.
The report of the secretary of the interi
or presents a comprehensive and interesti ng
exhibit of the numerous and Important
affairs committed to his supervision. I is
impossible in th is communication to do
more than briefly refer to a few of the sub
jects concerning which the secretary gives
fall a nd Instructive information.. The mon
appropriated on account of this depart
ment for its disbursement for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1816, amounted to
more than $157,000,000, or a greater sum
than was appropriated for the entire main
tenace of the government for the two fiscal
years ended June SO. 1861.
Our public lands, originally amounting to
1,840,000,000 acres, have be en reduced that
only about 600,000,000 acres still rema in in
government control ,excluding Alask a, the
balan ce bei ng by far the most valuable
portion, has been given away to settlers^ to
new states a nd to railroads, or sold at a
comparatively nomin al sum. Tlie patent
ing of land in execution of railroad grants
has progressed rapidly during the yea r, a nd
since the 4th day of March, 1895, abo ut
25,000,000 acres have thus been conveyed
to'these corporations I agree with the sec
retary that the remainder of our public
lands should be more carefully dealt with,
and their alienation guarded by better
economy and greater prudence. i
Pensions.
The diminution of our enormous pension
roll a nd the decrease of pension expendi
ture which have be en so often -confidently
foretold, still fail in material realization.
The number of pensioners on the rolls at
the close of the fiscal year ended June 30,
1896, was 970,678. This is the largest num
ber ever reported. The amount paid ex
clusively for the pensio ns during the year
was $138,14,761.94, a slight decrease from
that of the preceding year, whi le the total
expenditures on account of pensions, in
cluding the cost of maintaining the depart
ment a nd expenses attending pensions dis
tribution amounted to $142,200,550.59, or
within a very small fraction of one-third
of the entire expense of supporting the gov
ernment during the same year. The num
ber of new pension certificates Issued was
90,640. Of these 40,374 represent original
allowances of claims and 15,878 increase of
existing pensions.
The number of persons receiving pensions
from the United States, but residing in for
eign countries at the close of the last fis
cal year was 3,781, and the amount paid to
them during the year was $582,735.38. The
sum appropriated for the payment of pen
sio ns for the current fiscal year endi ng June
30, 1897, is $140,000,000, and for the suc
ceeding year it is estimated that the same
amount will be necessary. The commis
sioner of pensions reports that during the
last fiscal year 335 indictments were found
against violations of the pension laws.
Upon these indictments 167 convictions re
sulted.
In my opinion such statements as these
and such other information and observation
show that the abuses which have be en al
lowed to creep into our pension system have
done incalculable harm in demoralizing our
people a nd undermining good citizenship. -I
have endeavored with in my sphere of offi
cial duty to protect our pension roll and
make it what it should be,a roll of bonor,
containing the names of tko se disabled in
their country's service and worthy of their
country's affectionate remembrance.
When I have seen those who pose as the
soldiers' friends, active and alert in urging
greater laxity and more reckless pension
expenditure, while nursing selfish schemes,
1 have deprecated the approach of a situa
tion when necessary retrenchme nt and en
forced economy may lead to an attack upon
pension abuses, so determined as to over
look the discrimination due to tho se who,
worthy of a nation's care, oug ht to live
and die under the protection of a nation's
git t* tnde.
FARMER MORTON'S WORK.
The Government Should Encourage
the Agricultural Department.
The department of agriculture is so inti
mately related to the welfa re of our peo
ple a nd the prosperity of our nation that
it should constantly receive the care and
encouragement of the government. From a
small beginning, it as grown to be the
center of agricultural science and the source
of assistance to our agricultural efforts.
Large sums are annually appropriated for
tho maintenance of this departme nt and it'
imust be confessed that the legislation relat
ing to it as not always be en in the direc
tion of practical farming, or properly guard
ed agftn st waste or extravaganc e. So far,
however, the public money has been ap
propriated fairly and sensibly to he lp tho se
who actually till the soil, and no expendi
ture has been more profitably made or more
generally approved by the people.
In my opinion the gratuitous distribution
of seeds by. the department as at present
conducted* oug ht to be discontinued. N
one can read the statement of the secretary
on this subje ct a nd doubt the extravagance
a nd questionable results of this practice.
The professed friends of the farmer, a nd
certainly the farmers themselves, are natu
rally expecting to be willing to rid a de
partment devoted to the promotion of farm
ing interests of a feature which tends so
much to its discredit.
The weather bureau now attached to the
department of agriculture, has continued
to extend its sphere of usefulness, and by
an uninterrupted improvement In the accu
racy of its forecas ts as greatly increased
Its efficiency as an aid a nd protection to all
whose occupations are related to weather
conditions.
Omitti ng further reference to the opera
tions of the department, I commend the
secretary's report and the suggestions it
contains to the careful consideration of the
congress.
CIVIL SERVICE.
I Country Congratulated Upon the
Progress Made i the Reform.
The progress made in civil service re
form furnishes a cause for the utmost con
gratul itions. It has survived the doubts of
its friends as well as the rancor of its ene
mies a nd has gained a permanent place
among the agenci es destined to cleanse our
politics and Improve, economize and elevate
the public service. There are now in the
competiti ve classified service upward of
84.000 places. More than half of these have
be en Included fr om time to time since
March 4, 1893. A most radical a nd sweep
i ng extension was made bv executi ve order
dated May 6, 1890, and If fourth-class post
masterships are not included in the state

positions contemplated by the civil service
law are now classified. Abunda nt reasons
exist for including these postmasterships.

the result desired may to a limited extent
be accomplished.
The annu al report of the commissioner

important matter they have in, charge to
the .careful consideration of the congress.
C^l Interstate Commerce.
The interstate commerce commissi on has,
during the la st year, supplied abundant evi
dence of its usefulness and. the- importance-
of the work committed to its 'charge. Pub
lic transportation is a universal necessity,
and the question of just and reasonable
charges therefor has become ojt vital iia
portance, not only to shippers, audi aaxxlars,
but also to the Tast multitude of producers
and consumers. The justice-and equity of
the principles embodied in the existing lawr
passed for the purpose of "regulating, these
charges are everywhere conceded, and. thece
appears to be no question that th policy
thus entered upon has- a permanent place
In our legislation. As, the- present statute
when enacted was* in, the nature of the
case, more less tentative and experi
mental, it was hardly expected, to supply a
complete and adequate- system. While its
wnolesome effects-' axe- manifest and have
amply justified its enactment. It is evident
that all desired reforms in transportation
thods have not been fully accomplished.
I view of the judicial interpretation
which, some provisions'of this statute have
been received audi the defects disclosed by
the efforts made tor its,enforcement Its re
vision and amendment appear to be essen
tial to the end that it may more effectu
ally reach the evils more desired to be cor
rected. I hope the recommendation of the
commission upon this subject will be
promptly a nd favorably considered by the
congress.
lw?M
To meet any such deficit we haTS in the
treasury, in addition to a gold reserve of
$100,000,000, a surplus of more than $128,-
000,000 applicable to the payment of the ex
penses of the governmen t, and which must,
unless expended for that purpose, reaain a
useless hoard, or, if not extravagant!}
wasted, must in any event be perverted
from the purpose of its exaction from our
people. The payment, therefore, of any
deficiency of revenue from this fund, is
nothing but its proper and legitimate use.
The government thus applying a surplus,
fortunately in its trr-nsury. to the payment
of expenses not met by its current revenues,
is not at all to bu likened to a man living
beyo nd his income, and thus incurring debt
or encroaching on nis principal. It is not
one of the functio ns of our government to
accumulate and make additions to a fund
not needed for immediate expenditure.
With Individuals, it is the chief object of
struggle a nd effort. The application of an
accumulated fund by the government to the
prjment of its running expenses is a duty.
A individual living beyond his income a nd
embarrassing himself with debt, or drawing
upon his accumulated fund of principal, is
either unfortunate or improvident. The dis
tinction Is between a government charged
w'th the duty of expending, for the .benefit
of the people, and for proper purposes,* all
the money it receives from any source, and
the individual who is expected to manifest
a natural desire to avoid debt or to accu
mulate as mu ch as possible and to live with
in the Income derived from such accumula
tions, to the end that they may be in
creased or at least remain unimpaired for
the future use and enjoyment of himself
and the objects of his love and affection
who may survive him.
I is immeasurably better to appropriate
our surplus to the payment of justifiable
expenses than to allow it to become an in
vitation to reckless appropriations and
extravagant expenditures. I suppose that
it will not be denied that under the present
law our people obtain the necessaries of a
comfortable existence at a cheaper rate
than formerly. This is a matter of su
preme Importance, since it is the palpable
duty of every just government to make the
burde ns of taxation as light as possible.
The people should not be required to relin
quish their privilege of cheap living except
under the stress of their government's ne
cessity made plainly manifest-

THE TARIFF.*'
Believes That the "Wilson Bill
Should. Given a Better Trial.
I desire to recur to the statements else
where made concerning the government's
receipts and expenditures for the purpose
of venturing upon some suggestions touching
our present tariff law and its operation.
This statute took effect on the 28th day of
Augus t, 1894. Whatever may be Its short
comings as a complete measu re of tariff
reform, it must be conceded that it has
opened the way to a freer a nd greater ex
change of commodities between us and
oth er countries and thus famished a wider
market for our products and manufactur
ing.
The only entire fiscal year during whi ch
th is law has be en in force ended on the_
30th day of June, 1896. In that year our
imports increased over tho se of the previous
year more than $6,500,000, while the value
of the domest ic products we exported and
which found markets abroad was nearly
$70,000,000 more than during the preceding
year.
Those who insist that the cost to our
people of articles coming to them from
abroad for their needful use should only be
increased through tariff charges to an ex
tent necessa ry to meet the expenses of the
governmen t, as well as tho se who claim
that tariff charges may be laid upon such
articles beyond the necessiti es of govern
ment revenue, a nd with the additional pur
pose of so increasing their- price in onr
markets as to give Amerlcaa manufactur
ers and producers tetter a nd more profitable
opportunities, must agree that our tariff
laws are only primarily justified as sources
of revetme to enable the government to meet
the necessary expenses of its maintenance.
Considered as to its sufficiency in this
aspect, the present law can by no means
fall under just condemnation. During the
only complete fiscal year of its operation "t
has yielded nearly $8,000,000 more revenue
than was received from tariff duties in the
preceding year. There was, nevertheless,
a deficit between our receipts and expen
ditures of a little more than $25,000,000.:
This, however, was not unexpected.
The situation was such in Deccri'jcr, sev
months before the efoje of tlie fiscaj.
year,, that the secretary of the treasury
foretold a deficiency of $17,000,000. The
great a nd increasing apprehension and tim
idity in business circles and the depression
in all activities intervening since that time,
resulting from causes perfectly well under
stood a nd entirely disconnected -with our
tariff law or its operation, seriously checked
the imports we would have otherwise re
ceived, a nd readily accounted for the dif
ference between the estimate of the secre
tary a nd the actual deficiency, as well as for
a continued deficit. Indeed, It must toe con
fessed that we could hardly have ad a
more unfavorable period than the last two
years for the collection of tariff revenue.
W cann ot reasonably hope that our recu
peration from this business depression will
be sudden but it has already set in, with a
promise of acceleration and contlcSance. I
believe our present tariff law, if allow ed a
fair opportunity, will, in the near fuinre,
yield a revenue which, with reasonable
economical expenditures, will overcome all
deflcfencInS. In the inrinti-^^ a deficit
that as occurred or cuy cccur hc:'d excite
or disturb us.
presenti ng the necessity of
pcating'* these details, I cannot refrain from
rn
the Iptompt reform of a system opposed to
every principle of sound finance and shown
by experience to be fraught with the.grav
est peiril aad perplexity. The terrible civil
waryVwaach shook the foundations of our
sovernmenit more than thirty years "ago
brought in Its train the destruction of
property. The wasting of our country's sub
stance* and the estrangement of brethren.
These are now past a nd forgotten. Even
the distressing loss of life and conflict n
tailed Is but a sacred memory, which fos
ters .patriotic sentiment and keeps alive a
tend e regard for tho se who nobly died.
Ana, yet theTe Temains with us to-day, in
full strength and-activity, as an incident
of that tremendo us struggle, a feature of
its financial necessiti es not only unsuited
to our present circumstances, but. manifest
ly a~disturbing menace to business security
and a a ever-present agent of monetary dis
tress. Eeeause we may be enjoying a te m
porary relief from its depressing influence,
this should not lull us hi to a false security,
nor lead us to forg et the suddenness of past
vMtatipas.
1 ani more convinced than ever that we
can have no assured financial peace a nd
safety until the government currency obli
gations npon which gold may be demanded
from the treasury are withdrawn from cir
culation and canceled. This might be done^.
as has been heretofore recommended, by
their exchange for long-term bonds bearing,
a low rate of interest or by their redemption,
with the proceeds of. such bonds. Even it
Elythe United States notes, known as
greenbacl s, were thus retired, it is probable
that the treasnry notes issued in payment
of silver purchases under the act of July
14, 1890, now paid in gold when demanded,
would ot create much disturbance,, as they
might from time to time when received in
the treasury by redemption in gold or other
wise, by gradually a nd prudently replaced
by. silver coin.
Tliis plan of issuing bonds for the purpose
of redemption certainly appears to be the
most effective and direct path to the heeded
reform.
In defaul tof .this, however, it wou ld be
a step In the right direction if currency ob
ligations redeemable in gold, whenever so
redeemed should be cancelled instead of be
ing reissued. This operation wou ld be a
slaw remedy, but it wou ld improve present
conditions.
National banks should redeem their own
notes. They should be allowed to issue cir
culation to the par value of bonds depos
ited as security for its redemption, and the
tax on their circulation should be reduced
to one-fourth of 1 per eent.
Ih considering projects for the retirement
of United States notes and treasury notes
issued under the law of 1890. I am of the
opinion that we have placed too much stress
upon the danger of contracting the cur
rency a nd have calculated too little upon
tlie gold that would be added to our cir
culation If invited to ns by better, and safer
financial methods. It is ot so much a con
traction of our currency that should be
avoided as its unequal distribution. This
might to obviated, and any fear of harm
ful contraction at the same time avoided,
by allowing the organization of smaller
banks and in less populous communities
than are now permitted, a nd also author
izing existing banks to establish branches
la small communities under proper restric
tions.
The entire case may be presented by the
statement that the day of sonnd financial
method will ot dawn upon us until our
government abandons the banking business
nnd the accumulation of funds a nd confines
its monetary operations to the receipt of
the money contributed by the people for Its
support, and to the expenditure of such
money for the people's benefit.
Our business interests a nd ail good citi
zens long for rest from agitation and the
inffugration by the government of a re
formed financial policy which will encour
age enterprise a nd make certain the re
wards of labor and industry.

trade, industry or commerce, a nd so stifle
wholesome competition. When these are
defended, it is usually on the ground that
though they increase profits they also re
duce prices to the people. This is not one
of the real objects of these organizations,
nor is their tendency necessarily in that
direction. -If it occurs in a particular case,
it. is only because it accords with the pur
pose or interest of those managing the
scheme. Such occasional results fall far
short of compensating the palpable evils
charged to the account of trusts a nd mo
liopollcs. Their tendency is to crush out
iutHvidi-l iE'Irjcrifi-s: ~3'2 t or
prrr^nt the free use 0i human facilities
and the full developme nt of human char
acter. Through them the farmer, the arti
san and the small trader is in danger of

the level of a* mere appurtenence to a great
lr.achine, with little free will, with no duty
but that ot passive obedience and with lit
tle hope* or opportunity of raising in the
scale of responsible and helpful citizenship.'
the instinctive belief that such is the
inevitable trend of trusts and monopolies is
due the widespread and deep-seated popular
aversion in whi ch they'are held ,aud the
not unreasonable insistence that, whatever
may be their incidental economic advant
ages, their general effect upon personal
character, prospects and usefulness cann ot
be otherwise than injurious. Though con
gress has attempted to deal with this mat
ter' by legislation, the laws passed for that
purpose thus far have proved ineffective,
ot because of any lack of disposition or at
tempt to enforce the m, but simply because
the laws themselves as interpreted by the
courts do not reach the difficulty. If the in
sufficiency of existing laws can be remedied
by further legislation it should be done. I
should be recognized, however, that all fed
eral legislation on this subject may fall
short of its purpose because of inherent
obstacles and also because of the complex
character of our governmental system,
which, while making the federal authority
supreme with in its sphere, has carefully
limited that sphere by methods and bounds
whi ch cannot be transgressed. The decision
of our highest court on th is precise ques
tion renders it quite doubtful whether the
evils of trusts and monopolies can be ade
quately treated through federal action, un
less they seek directly to include In their
objects transportation or Intercourse be
tween states or between the United States
and foreign countries. I does ot follow,
however, that this is the limit of the rem
edy that may be applied. Even though it
may be found that federal authority is not
broad enough to fully reach the case, the re
can be no 'doubt of the power of the several
states to act effectively in the premises,
and there should be no reason to doubt
their willinguess to judiciously exercise
such ,power.
In concluding th is communicatio n, its last
words shall be an appetl to the congress for
the most rigid economy in the expenditure
of the money it holds in trust for the
people. The way to perplexing extravagance
is easy, but a return to frugality is difficult.
When, however, it is considered that these
who bear, the burdens of taxation have
no guaran ty of honest .care save in the
nnelity of their public servants, the duty
of all possible retrenchment is plainly mani
fest. When onr differences are forgotten
a nd our contents of political opinion are no
longer remember ed nothing in the retro
spect of our public service will be as
fortuna te a nd comforting as the recollection
of official duty well performed and the mem
ory of a constant devotion to the interests
of our confiding fellow countrymen.

Washington, Dec 9~ Tne- United
States senate began tlie- seconct session
of the Fifty-fourth congress with
crowded galleries and *witn that ac
companiment of activity xodL of greet
ing that usually attends- the reassem
bling of congress. But the upper
branch of the house never puts aside
its- dignity and the meeting developed
no. demonstrations, -of dramatic inci
deats. .The reading of the president's
message was the* feature of the pro
ceedings, and beyoad this, no attempt
was made to enter upon the business
of the session. To, many of the foreign
representatives occupying the diplo
matic gallery, the message had a spe
cial interest aaad significance owing: to
the part they had taken in the con
spicuous foreign events to which the
president referred. Sir Julian Paunce
fote, the British ambassador, and the
new Turkish, minister, Moustapha Bey,
were present
Senor DuPuy de I^me, the Spanish
minister, was not in attendance dur
ing the day, but two of the secretaries
of the Spanish legation carefully noted
the references to the Cuban conflict.
Minister Hatch of Hawaii, and Mr.
Cooper, the Hawaiian minister of for
eign affairs, were listeners, although
the message contained no message to
the Hawaiian islands.
The diplomatic gallery was vacant as
soon as the foreign questions referred
to in the message had been read. On
the floor of the senate printed copies
of the message were distributed, and
these gave the senators opportunity to
read the salient features, but they
nevertheless listened to the message
attentively. The reading of the mes
sage covered one hour and fifty min
utes, and at its conclusion the senate
adjourned.
i the House.
While the scene attending the. open
ing of the house were both brilliant
and interesting in the crowds that
thronged the galleries and the con
spicuous personages present the pro
ceedings themselves were dull and
spiritless, being distinctively routine.
The house, met, the chaplain invoked
the divine blessing on the work of the
session, the roll was called, a commit
tee, consisting of Mr. Cannon (111.),
Mr. Payne (N. Y.) and Mr. Turner
(Ga.) was appointed to wait on the
president and the latter's annual com
munication was read. The reading
consumed about two hours. It was
Mr. Cleveland's farewell message and
there was much curiosity as to his
views, OH Cuba, especially, but there
was no demonstration either of ap
proval or dissent thftughout its read
ing. TJie haliday nature of the-
day
was saddened b^ the announcement of
the death of ex-Speaker Qrisp, which
Mr. Turner (Ga.) fornJally made to
his" associates. Out of respect to the
memory of the distinguished Georgian
the house, after adopting appropriate
resolutions, immediately adjourned.

Yesesulan Bonndry Dispute Will Be
Arbitrated.
Washington, Dec. 9. Secretary Ol
ney to-day received a cablegram fr6m
Senor Andrade, the Venezuelan minis
ter to Washington, who is now in
Caracas, stating that the Venezuelan
government has accepted the agree
ment reached by the United States and
Great Britain for \he arbitration of the
boundary dispute and that an extra
session of the Venezuelan congress ha*
been called to consider the treaty.
Thus the last obstacle to the amicable
settlement of this important dispute
will be removed. The following state
ment given out by the state depart
ment embraces all of the information
in the possession-of the department re
specting the treatment by Venezuela
of the proposed arbitration treaty:
"Secretary Olney received this morn
ing a telegram from Minister Andrade
at Caracas that the memorandum
agreed upon between Great Britain,
and the United States for the settle
ment of the Venezuelan boundary
question is accepted by the Venezuelan!
government that the memorandum
will be published at Caracas this after
noon and that an extra session of the
Venezuelan congress will be called as
soon as possible in order that the
memorandum may be carried into ef
fect by the necessary, treaty between
Great Britain and Venezuela."
The department has also made pnb
lie the text of the heads of the pro
posed treaty, as they were agreed upon
between Greats Britain and the United
States, showing that the advance pub
lication through the Associated Press
was perfectly correct.

when he read aloud to friends about 11

sentences Mr. McKinley made no ef-H|
