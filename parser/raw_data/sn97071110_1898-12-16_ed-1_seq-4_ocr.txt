YEAR'S WORK IN ALASKA
Progress Made in Mining Development Value of the Salmon Indus
try Agriculture in the Far North Necessary Legislation In
teresting Report of Governor Brady, of Alaska.
One of the most interesting docu
ments recently received at the interior
department is the annual report of John
G. Brady, governor of .Alaska. The
report is very elaborate in its treatment
of subjeots relative to the great Noith
west territory, covering everything from
mission stations to the mining indus
tries. Probably more ' space is devoted
to gold mining than any other subject,
that being the predominating industry
at the present time. Of this, Mr.
Brady says:
"The past year has been one of won
derful progress. During the winter
and spring all sorts of vessels were put
into the "Alaska trade, and were filled
with passengers and cargo to the very
limit. Before long, thousands of tons
of freight could be seen piled upon and
under the snow upon- the summits of
the Alaskan mountains. The United
States contributed by far the largest
number of prospectors, who came Irom.
all quarters, a large number from every
atate in the Union, California, Oregon
and Washington Bending the largest
oontingents. These prospectors.as a
class, were fine specimens of manhood.
"It is calculated that .8,200 outfitted
for Copper river, several hundred went
over the divide at Yakutat, and some
parties went ovei the Dalton trail and
worked their way up the White river,
one of the largest branches of the Yu
kon. Cook Inlet, Resurrection bay,
Solovin bay, Kotzebue sound, Koyukuk
river and many other places have all
been visited by prospectors this season.
The declaration of war against Spain
ohecked the tide. Most of the Amer
icans who proceeded to Dawson com
plained of the mining lules and regula
tions, and the manner in which they
were carried out. This had the effeot
to drive many upon the. Alaska side,
and the claims whioh were abandoned
for the 'first onrushto the Klondike
were relooated, and muoh other valua
ble ground discovered, which will keep
large numbers of men there this winter.
"There is no way of ascertaining the
amount of dust washed out upon the
Alaska side. The amounts given for
the Klondike and its tributaries vary
very much.' ; Several reasons are given
why the output is smaller than was
anticipated the scaroity of supplies,
especially lights, the high price of
jabor, and the 10 per cent royalty ex
noted. Many claims are being held
with the expectation that supplies will
be more abundant and not so dear, and
consequently cheaper labor, and that
the loud complaint against the royalty
will cause the Ottawa government to
abolish it. There will be no lack of
supplies this winter, but there appears
to be a .' determination among' the
miners to koep up wages, and the royal
ty is still demanded. 60 we can expect
the product for the coming year to be
much curtailed." . ',
. Speaking of quartz mining, he says:
"Yerv rich ore was discovered in the
vicinity of Ketchikan, and many loca
tions have been made and developed.
Quartz locations have also been made
at various places around the coast and
upon thejslanda, as far, as Unalaska.
The greater number of these are held
by poor men who are not able to make
developments of any considerable ex
tent. Alaska is a splendid field for a
class of men who can oommand capital
and who cari examine these discoveries
and come to terms with the owners for
the purpose of development and sale.
While important discoveries of gold
have been made on. Pine creek, flowing
into Lake Atlin, the fields in the vicin
ity of Bald Eagle and Sum Dum Chief,
as well as Sheep creek, near Juneau,'
have made even better showings in the
past year than previously."
Favorable reports are made pi the
operations of the large American min
ing companies at work in Alaska, their
efforts seeming to be more abundantly
rewarded than are those of foreign cor-,
porations. .'....'
Land Laws.
So mucli of the land laws as relates
to mineral lands and mining claims,
inasmuoh as they are the same as are
now in force in the United States
proper, have given perfect satisfaction
throughout Alaska, but in the matter
of homestead laws, quite a different
state of affairs exists. The idea 'that a
man may dig out ore upon lands - and
obtain patent for the same but cannot
build a house and improve land .for a
home, nor obtain title to it, is regarded
as highly nnjust and imprudent by the
residents of that country. As a matter
of faot, the, land office has issued but
one patenttinder the law of Maroh 8,
1808, for trade and manufacture, and
the amount of . land an applicant re
ceives depends not on any law, but
entirely on the will of the land officer.
Even the law which-passed last May,
extending the homestead rights , to
Alaska, is found to be practioally val
ueless. . ' '
"There are no surveyed lands in
Alaska, nor has any system of survey
been provided. . It is Impossible, there
fore, for a poor settler to acquire a
homestead. - If he were able and will
ing to stand the expense of a survey,
' , Heaviest Oriental Cargo.
The Nippon YuSen Kaisha steamship
Kinshiu Mam, which sailed from Yoko
hama for Seattle November 29, is bring
ing the heaviest caigo ever shipped from
the Orient for Seattle. It consists of
8,500 tons of tea, silk and our'ios. The
heaviest previous cargo waa brought on
the Agapanthus, which arrived in De
cember, 1896, with" 2, 700 tons. The
Kinshiu is also bringing the marines to
man tho Japanese cruiser Chilose, un
der construction in San Fiancieoo. -
he would have no assurance that it
would beaccepted by the government.
If he settles as a squatter, and makes
improvements, he cannot tell how
future surveys may affect him. In oon
sequenoe of this condition of affairs,
not a single homesteader has attempted
to make entry under the new law in the
land offioe at Sitka."
In the matter of wagon roads, rail
roads, etc., a different condition exists.
As soon as the right of way bill had
passed, numbers of filings were made,
and several roads of various character
are now in ' progress of construction.
At Unga, Berner's bay and Douglass
island there are railways in operation,
although solely for use in connection
with the mines. The Pacifio & Arctic
Kailway & Navigation Company has
probably made more progress than any
of the other large companies, having
completed 14 miles of road over almost
impassable country. Moreover, so
much of the road as is completed is'
constructed of the best material, by the
best of workmen, and is in every way
first-class. Money has not been spared,
and as a result the road stands without
a peer. It might be mentioned, in this
oonneotion, that, owing to the limita
tions of the timber laws,' it was found
best to import a great deal of timber,
and nearly all the timber and lumber
used in building Dyea and Skagway,
their railroads and mills, was shipped
from-Pugest sound. . j
' The governor expresses the hope that
congress, during the short session, will
pass upon a code of civil procedure for
the district of Alaska.
Salmon Industry. '
Of the salmon industry, a great deal
is said. There can be no doubt that
this industry is one of great importance,
for irom figures given it is seen that
the Alaskan output in the last year
marketed at $2,977,019. 1 The ; red
salmon seems to far-outnumber all oth
ers, . although the pink and silver
salmon are found in large numbers.
Comparatively few king salmon were
taken last year. To pack these salmon
for shipment, over 5,000 laborers are
employed, and, strange to say, the most
of them are Chinese.' It has been
found almost impossible to educate the
native Alaskan Indian to. American
canning methods, and this, together
with the tact that Chinese labor is ex
ceedingly cheap, may account, in a
measure, for the large number of Chi
nese in tire canneries. This salmon
trade during the past year was of suffi
cient proportions to keep in constant
useKduring the season, 58 steamers, in
addition to the 712 lighters and small
boats. ' . ... .' . . .
In the opinion of the governor,
Alaska should be well supplied with
inspectors, the present force of two be
ing decidedly inadequate.
Agricultural Possibilities.
"As an agricultural country, Alaska is
still in its infancy, little being known
of its possibilities. ' - Enough can be
learned,: however,- from, experiments
made in the past year, to satisfy those
interested that such crops as potatoes,
cabbage, beets, peas and other ' market
vegetables can, with proper attention
and care, be raised in parts of the coun
try without difficulty., , . But grass, be
yond everything else, promises to bt
the agricultural wealth of Alaska.
This is but 'little appreciated at present.
The native grasses are nutritious, and
grow luxuriantly. Timothy, olover and
other cultivated varieties do well, one
aore of gionnd in grass there, for pas
turgage, being worth several aores in a
'drier climate. There are many varie
ties of native berries, such as currants,
huokleberries, etc., but berries from
the States, as a rule, do well under cul
tivation. ,; " ,
"Of stockraising." says the report,
"but little can be said. Reindeer will
soon be reared in "vast herds. t In the
near future we expect to have the mail
transported by reindeer all over North,
em Alaska during the winter, and al
much less cost than at preser;."
The Governor's Recommendations.
Before closing the report, a numbei
of recommendations are made. Among
them is the suggestion that Japonsky
island be built up as a naval station.
Attention is also called to the fact that
at Kadiak, Unga, St. Michaels, Circle
City and Dyea there is a great lack of
proper courtrooms and jails, as well ar
at Sitka, where the buildings are in
miserable condition. ; ' '
The ; appropriation for Alaskan
schools has been found quite insuffi
cient, being but $80,000 per year. An
appropriation of twice that size could
easily be utilized to good advantage.
A further recommendation is made
to the effect that lighthouses and other
beacons be placed at oonspiouous points
along the coast, as the commerce has
greatly multiplied of late and demands
suoh protection. - 1 . ' j
Governor Brady oloses his report
with an appeal to the Republican party
to live up to its pledge and extend to
Alaska the privilege of sending a dele
gate to the national congress.
1 Hop Outlook. . . ,
A good outlook for the future of the
hop crop of this year is presented, as
there is a good demand for them and a
rather short supply. . The market is at
present buying oautiously. They have
done very little purchasing this year,
so far, and it is almost certain that a
good demand will in conseqeunce re
sult. English buyers are now purchas
ing only very choice hops, ' the price
paid herejaeing about oo and about
18o to the buyer in .England. ' "
ENGLAND WILL CONSENT.
To the Modification of the Clayton
i ' Bnlwer Treaty.
' New York, Dec. 12. A dispatch to
the Herald from Washington "says:
President McKinley is in favor of open
ing negotiations with Great Britain for
the puprose of modifying the Clayton
Bulwer treaty so as to permit jthe con
struction and control of the Nicaragua
canal by the United States. .
Should congress during the present
Bession fail to enact the pending Morgan
bill the president also favors entering
into negotiations . with Nicaragua and
Costa Bioa looking to the construction
of the canal under the auspices and con
trol of the United States.
On the authority of a high official of
the administration it is stated that there
is absolutely no foundation for the re
port that Great . Britain, through Sir
Julian Pauncefote, has protested to the
state department against that feature
oi the president's message dealing with
the canal question. On the contrary,
the authorities have every.reason to be
lieve that the British government will
consent to any reasonable modification
of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty that the
president may desire, so as to remove
the obstacles which it places in the
wayj for the control of the canal by this
government.
So satisfied are the officials on this
point that negotiations will soon be'un
der way which it is hoped , will eul
ruinate in an agreement especially in
tended to give this government the
right to construot and control the pro
posed waterway.
STILL REACHING OUT.
Russia, Germany and France
tin
, Partitioning of China.
Shanghai, i Deo. 12. John Barrett,
formerly United States ' minister to
Siam, has returned here after visiting
Peking and the principal cities and
ports. He says the situation in China
is one of a most critical nature, and
Manchuria is no longer Chinese',, but
Bussian ' territory. He asserts ' that
New Chwang, the" chief northern port
for the movement of American produots,
is also piaotioaily Bussian, and is liable
to be closed any day.
The. only permanent safeguard to par
amount American and British interests,
Barrett says, Is immediate and united
action by the interested governments to
defend their territory in the Chinese
empire, to force reforms' in the govern
ment, to prevent further cessions of
ports find provinoes, and to insist upon
an "open-door" policy in all the ports
of China, including the spbeies of influ
ence of Bussia, Germany and France.
Otherwise, Barrett contends, the im
pending partition of the Chinese empire
will-seriously curtail the field of trade
by disastrously affecting American and
British influehoe in Asia.
WATTERSON FOR EXPANSION.
Where England Has Succeeded, Amer
ica May Experiment.
New York, Deo. 12. The Patria
Club held its fiist meeting of the win
ter tonight, and entertained and listened
to Colonel Henry Watterson, of Louis
ville, the speaker , of the evening.
Colonel Watterson spoke on "Our
Country; Its Dangers and Its Hopes,
Past, Present and to Come. " He de
clared himself in favor of the policy ol
national expansion.
"I am not disposed," he said, "to
agree with the optimistic young Amer
ican who believes that the United
States is bounded on the north on the
aurora borealis, on the south by the
equator, on the east by the rising sun,
and on the west by eternity ,but still I
think somewhat that way. ' .,
"As for expansion, I think that what
England has done with safety, America
may attempt. . If Dewey had only
sailed away but he did not, and where
he nailed the Stars and Stripes, there
they, must stay. We must either go
forward or backward, end we canuqt go
DacKwatd without loss of self-respeot.
"The anti-expansionists ask how we
can 'take these new responsibilities
when our own government at home is
so admittedly corrupt. On the other
hand, we are a nation of producers hin
dered by overproduction. We 'must
have a greater market. Also, the Phil
ippine islands are not further from the
Golden Gate today than was San Fran
cisco from Washington when California
was annexed. The centralized power
of modern civilization annihilated
Bpace and knits all together. All na
tional expansion for, us is but Amerioa,
the'boy, grown to manhood and nat
urally reaohing out.'-'
.SEVERE WIND STORM.
Gale Blew Ninety-Six Miles an Hour at
Point Reyes
San Francisco, Dec. 12. The storm
which raged all over the Pacific coast
last night and today was one of the
most severe ever recorded by ' the
weather bureau. It extended from the
northern border down : to Texas and
from the Paoific as far east as Nebraska.
In this city the wind attained a velocity
of 45 miles an hour, but at Point
Reyes, right in the teeth of" the gale,
the wind swept along at 96 miles an
hour. Considering the great velooity
of the wind, the damage done to ship
ping was slight, and $10,000 will pay
for everything, including the charges
of towboat men for extricating vessels
from dangerous positions. ; '

Explosion at Powder Works.
Wilmington, Del., Dec. 12. Five
powder mills in the yard of the Dupont
powder works, near here, exploded this
morning; - Bobert Mollheny, John
Wright and John Moore were killed.
Eight other men were seriously injured.
Michael MoCann, John Muthin and
Samuel Stewart are likely to die. The
explosion was due to the fact that a car t

' ... To Prevent Freezing.
Some interesting things hare come
to light in the history of the tunnel
boring for' the Jungfrau railway in
Switzerland. ' Blasting gelatine was
used in this work, whioh freezes at a
temperature of about 40 degrees Fahr
enheit. . It is an exceedingly danger
ous substance to handle, being unlike
dynamite in this respect, and so the
contractors engaged , in this work are
keeping their explosives in a sort of
safe heated by electricity, so that the
danger of the gelatine freezing is en
tirely obviated. In this connection is
a proposition to extend this idea to the
thawing out of dynamite by some elec
trical application, as - dynamite is com
monly frozen for safe handling. ;
'. . ; The World's Supply of Wheat. 1 :
An English expert claims that the
wheat producing soil of the world is un
equal to the strain that will be put upon
it. Even now when the food supply is
ample, thousands die because their dis
ordered stomachs fail to digest the food
they take. Hostetter's Stomach Bitters
strengthen and tone up the stomach and
digestive organs.
Light From Sugar.
The flashes of bluish white light seen
in the dark when pieces of sugar are
rubbed together have been studied by
Mr. John Burke, an English physicist.
By rotating a loaf of sugar on a lathe
against a hammer he has obtained al
most continuous luminosity, enabling
him to observe and photograph, the
speotrum. The - light appears to be a
result of some change in the crystals,
and not due to heating or to chemical
action between the sugar and air, as
was supposed.
Makes the Spot Vanish.
A slight rap may cause a bruise, or a
slight blow a blaok one, sore and ten

the use of St. Jacobs Oil, and make the
spot vanish and the soreness heal.
