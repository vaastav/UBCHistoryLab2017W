Dayis 6r ws Gravely Eloquent
Washington 6In the Senate to
day when Edmunds called up his reso
lution providing for the continuance of t
the committees as they existed at the <
close of the last session President pro
tern Davis who temporarily occupied
his former seat on the floor having
vacated the chair to Harris said
Mr President The solemn event
which excited the sympathy of the civil
ized world recently brought about the
unexpected change in the presidency
The Fortyseventh Congress now meets
under tke constitutional successor to the
President who was only inaugurated laal
March and who was stricken down in
the maturity of his manhood after but
four short months experience in the ex
ecutive chair Those stern facts are full
of admonition They teach us how frail
are human hope and how transitory is i
human power In the presence of this
sad instruction ambitk may well pause
and all of us IE ay learn how vain are the
aspirations to which too much of our 1
lives is devoted Great as was the be i
reavement which spread sorrow over
the land rend which touched the heart
of every fireside it was sanctified by the
consolation that the people of aU sections
were brought nearer together by common
grief end thus came to understand each
otber better Through the kindred emo I
tions that had long existed they were
softened and the violence of faction was I
chastened by ffiiclion Although Pres
ident Arthur represents the party that I
elected Garfield his personal position i is
necessarily delicate and u icg He is I
entitled by his whole bearing thrcugh the
critical ordeal to generous countenance
As a Senator I propose to extend to his
administration candid treatment sus I
taining it when right and opposing It
when wrong on all public questions I
Bolding to this purpose and intending to
insist OH a pure economy and just ad I
ministration of the executive trust The
new President ought to bo aided by all
proper legislative cooperation in carry
ing out the general policy he may pro
pose to the country Whatever that
policy in future my be it is entitled to
a fair trial and patient hearing With
this view of my duty I shall vote wil
lingly to continue the committees
in this body az they are now con
stituted It is best that the party
which has the President and House of
Representatives should be held answer
able for all public measures Then there
will be no divided responsibility If the
opposition are wise they will accept this
conclusion At a special session in
March they made but a brief and feeble I
stand against the organization of the
committees which shape the great legis
lation of the country Indeed they al
most conceded that important point to
their adversaries but in the protracttd
contest for offices of the Senate under
the same political conditions my demo
cratic friends yiel cd nQ ground from I
the beginning to the end of it Doubt
less they had satisfactory reasons for this
course of policy Last spring I took oc i
casion to state the reasons why my vote
should be given for the then existin
organizaticn of the Senate Although
circumstances have materially changed
since that time the position which I
voluntarily assumed has not been altered
hence I adhere to that declaration always
reserving to myself the right of rejecting
offensive candidates I am greatly
encouraged in this decision by the
course of my distinguished friend
from Vermont eminent as a leader of
his party as he is also eminent
for public and private worth upon his
motion the present chief clerk distinctly
appointed as a democrat was unani
mously made acting secretary That
graceful deed is a cheering sign which
affords me pleasure applause because
this is the first place where an example
should be set against the common scram I
bling for office that disfigures our politi
cal life The country was almost equally
divided between the two great partiee at
the presidential election The majority
in the House of Representatives is small i
and in this chamber republicans and
democrats confront each other with like
numbers The committees are now held
by the other party From my standpoint
it would be unwise to disturb this cot di i
tion of things and I do not propose to
engage in any struggle that looks to that
object As our parties are organized the
public man who steps outside party lines I
is always exposed to Harsh criticism no
matter how proper his motives may be
The machinery both enforces rigid dis
cipline and denounces revolt as treason 1
For the last ten years my political posi
l tion has been entirely independent of any
organization I have accepted good wher
ever it was found and I have voted for the
beet men whether they were called re i
publicans or democrats Consistency is
not a virtue if it means dogmatic adhe
sion to a given idea when change would
be meritorious Toe greatest statesmen
of modern times have been courageously
inconsistent and have become public
benefactors by abandoning mistaken pol
icy If conviction satisfied me that opin
ions formed long ngo and followed since
then were erroneous it would not cost me
a moments thought to cast them off like a
a worn out garment I believe them to
be sound and so believing I shall stand
by them as moderator between ex
tremes It pleases the majority of the
Senate to confer upon me the highest
distinction in their gift Prized as tint
honor is and ought to be it is doubly val
uable in my estimation because it come
wholly unsought and without the ex
change of a single w rd directly or ind
rectly that could by possibility imp u
an obligation This is the only answer
I I shAll ever makp to the unworthy mu ds
that would maaatire the integrity CJ t
others by their tW1 iw BUnda1 of per
tonal honor The day is drawing near 1
when I shall ratire from this chamber
My only ambition while here IP to be
instrumental in bringing about perfect
peace between the north and south as the
best means for promoting the permanent
prosperity of the whole union When
rude voices of faction which for fifteen I
years past in time of peace have dis
turbed national fellowship that should
have been restored at the close ef the
civil war shall be silenced this
ceuntry will bound forward in a
career of grandeur and glory that
will astound mankind Reconciliation
has nobler aims than mere national
wealth If this experiment of republican
government Is to endure and to be per
petuated as we all humbly pray God it
nay be for unborn generations then the
spirit of forbearance and of toleration in
which it Was created by patriotic of
our father must be revived and imitated
In no other way can a mora perfect
union which their inspired wisdom
formed out of the disjointed confedera
tion be preserved u a shining ht of
higktr cirilizatioiL ui u a refuge for
ke orNHd er all lands
I When referring to his acceptance of the I I
position of President of the Senate Davis I
manifested considerable indignation in
alluding to the various newspaper in
sinuations that he had sold himself the
republicans He was very emphatic in
reasserting that not a single word tending
to commit himself to the republicans
had passed between him and them prior
to his acceptance of the position Hi
speech has rendered the Senate officials
and employees happy ti
