"Those of its w ho knew Jiini intimate- |
!v?who were fortunate enough to be i
elosej ;0 him?knew him to be a man [
fair and always determined to do the 1
right. He sometime? apx>eared some
what gruff on the outside, but l'e was ,
not?he was a kind and considerate man j
when once kr was known. Is it reason- j
able to believe that all of the talents j
of this man should pass out w ith his |

'The effect of the life of William ,

yer, a scientist, a poet, a student of
philosophy, a widely learned man ?t;d 1
one at whose feet one wished to sit.
"The name of William J'. Hubbard is '
linked with the history of West Ylr- '
g:nia and his efforts were always liken <
I with the good that has been done In
West Virginia. He was a soldier and 1
offered his life for his country. He
was a loving husband and a devoted 1
and loyal father. Ho goes from us. i
leaving a memory that will live for
ever. When his work was completed, i
lie laid down Into n peaceful sleep."

PRESIDENT CRITICISED
BY SENATOR HARRISON
Washington, Dec. T.?The Republican
party's leadership, from President Hard
ing down, was assailed in a speech in
rtie senate today by Senator Harrison.
Democrat. Mhsrlssippi. who declared .Mr
Harding was doing the "very thing* for
which he, a* a senator, had denounced
President Wilson." The president's
message to congress yesterday, he add
ed. constituted an appeal to partisan
ship and warning to Republicans to dis
avow their allegiance to "bloc" organi
zation.
Mr Harrison -marked the senate Re
publican leaders. saying they had
"shifted and hopped until none of us
know where or when or why."
Secretary Mellon also was denounced
as seeking. In his annual report of the
treasury department. t<> "help along '
the ideas of President Harding with re
spect "to relieving the rich" of heavy
taxation
The Mississippi senalor added 'hat
he was "pained" to see the teguln- s.-s
slon of congress start off so inausplci
eusly. saying that with the appeal <?:
the president '"for n partisan lineup."
it was apparent that the policy of
"abandonment." whh-h characterizes the
extra session would be continued.
