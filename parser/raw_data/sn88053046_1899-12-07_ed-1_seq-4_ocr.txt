Elsewhere in this issue of the
Gazette will be found the full text of
tho annual message of President Mc
Kinley, which was road in both houses
of Congress yesterday afternoon.
It i 9 impossible, upon a cursory
perusal of such a lengthy paper, to
make any intelligent or fair criticism
of it. So far as that is concerned,
however, our readers may uttend to
this tasa for (hemselvee, as they care
fully read tho message in the privacy
of their homes. But a few of the points
touohed upon may be referred to here.
It will be noticed that th»« President
comes out pretty boldly, for him, iu
favor of the gold standard. Ho is no
longer afraid to say "gold," and
leeommends legislati
enable the Secretary of the Treasury
at any time to sell bonds for the pur
pose of maintaining th«* Treasury goid
reserve. This recomnicudation, how
ever, was mad»* by President Cleveland
several years ago. He further recom
mends that our gold holdings bo put
into a trust fund for the redemption of
greenbacks, tho gri'onbacks when so
redeemed net to be thereafter paid out
except in exchange for gold. But it
will be noticed that tho President dooe
not rooonumiud the establishment of
the gold standard by law. Why should
he have refrained from doing this?
There is no lack of frankness on the
part of tho President in maiutaiuing
and defending his policy of expansion
Ho justifies tho
Tiiserahlo trinity with the Sultan of
Jolo, with its provisions defending
slavery and polygamy, hut claims that
this ie not a recognition of slavoiy by
the United States. Jn justification of
the wat in the Philippines, he
reiterates the dteary platitudes of
"bonevolent assimilai!
that after they have ceased struggling
for liberty aud independence the pcoplo
of tho Philippines will "enjoy a pros
peiity. and freedom they have never
enjoyed bofoio;" that the islabds aro

At tho instance of Ag 6 nt Stout of tho

Tho boy, up«*n being sworn, testified
that ho had been visiting his aunt
Tuesday morning and returned homo
shortly before noon. Ho had Boareely
tored tho house when his father,
who had been drinking, began to up
braid him for not having returned in

the factory of the Ford Morocco Co.
The boy said his father not only whip

Mary T. McLaughlin, daughter of
tho defendant, corroborated tho testi

had sent another brother with the
dinner before James came home.
