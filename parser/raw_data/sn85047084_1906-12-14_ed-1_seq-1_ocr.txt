Would Help Hawaii to Anything Else
-Sundry Race Problems.
(Mail Special to the Advertiser.)
WASHINGTON, D' C, Nov. 30. The
representatives of Hawaii, now in
town, have already begun to talk with
Congressmen about Hawaiian meas
ures at the session of Congress which
begins Monday. As the session is brief,
lasting only three monvhs, much pre
liminary preparation is necessary on
bills of any importance. As a matter
of fact several committees have been
here for a week making ready. The
champions of Hawaii have not been
neglecting their opportunities.
CANNON UNCHANGED.
Speaker Cannos has been sounded
further about the refunding bill which
passed the Senate last winter and was
favorably reported to the House. Mr.
George B. McCIellan had an extended
talk with him on that subject and the
Speaker expressed himself with the ut
most frankness. Mr. Cannon is as
much opposed as ever to the principle
of the refunding bill. He does not be-
lieve it is wise legislation, because of
the precedent it would set for other
communities. He will not do anything
to further the consideration of the
measure, but insists that, it being now
on the House calendar, the bill shall
take its chances with other legislation.
If it can get consideration and a ma
jority of votes he will not try to hin
der. - T
YET FRIENDLY TO HAWAII.
At the same time the Speaker is
very friendly rh his attitude toward
Hawaii. He believes in appropriations
for the Territory and liberal appropri
ations. "Why don't you gentlemen quit
working for that refunding bill," he
asked recently, "and devote your ener-
gies to pressing for the appropriations
you want? I am willing to vote you
more than you would get under the
refunding bill. I favor a good appro

CONGRESS AND CUBA.
An opinion is current that Congress
REFUNDING BILL
may not support with any enthusiasm
the President's declared policy for
another independent government in
Cuba. Hence the added importance of
such pleas as ex-Secretary Foster
makes. Secretary Taft is credited in
inside official circles with being luke
warm toward the President's plan for
the reason that he does not believe
it possible of execution. His sympa
thies are rather with a large contin-
gent of Congress that would establish
a strong protectorate or take the is
land over immediately and have no
further ado about it.
Big debates are in prospect, for the
Cuban question will be threshed out
when it comes to deciding whether the
cost of intervention, now mounting up
to $2,000,000, shall be saddled upon
Cuba. The profligate Cuban Congress
has plunged the island in debt for
about all the people can stand. The
American Congress will have to delib
erate carefully before placing an ad
ditional burden upon their wards.
While the race phase of the situation
will be kept in the background as
much as possible, it is none the less
a fact that the attitude of the Cuban
negroes pnd their utter shiftlessness
are very discouraging to the friends of
Cuban independence. The president is
aware of all these things, disclosures
regarding which have by no means
heartened him for carrying out his
plans.
OTHER RACE TROUBLES.
The race question is coming to plague
the administration from still other
quarters. The Brownsville trouble and
the Cuban trouble ought to suffice, but
the Japanese trouble on the Pacific
Coast is essentially a race question and
the President has his hands full in
finding a solution for it. Secretary of
Commerce and Labor Metcalf is back
here and has told what he found at
San Francisco. Japanese Ambassador
Aoki is going to San Francisco to find
out a few things for himself. The Cal
ifornia delegation in Congress is now
speeding toward Washington, clamor
ing with one voice, for a Japanese
exclusion act.
CALIFORXIANS

Bills for Japanese exclusion will

winter.
Of course, thev have no chance of pass-
,ng. but tne Californians are terribly
m earnest and are planning a long
tuss.ion of Brownsville, Cuba and San
Francisco may contribute something to
the e(iitication of the country. A flood
of European immigrants has begun to
pour into the South within a few
weeks, which makes the negro less de
sirable as a laborer in that section.
This will accentuate race feeling in the
course of :i few years, unless the ne

selves and become more useful in the
community.
THE PHILIPPINES.
The intense ambition of Cubans to
get on the government rolls. Secretary
Taft finds, is shared by the Philippine
wards, in whose welfare he has much
concern. The past week the Secretary
had an afternoon or two with former
Governor General Ide, who explained
to him a lot about what the Philip

PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE
Remarks on Japanese
Capital and Labor
Hawaii.
"Denouncing the exclusion of Japa.
nese pupils from the San Francisco
public schools for white children as a
wicked absurdity, President Roosevelt,
in his message transmitted to Congress
yesterday noon, significantly promises
to use every civil and military force
that he may lawfully employ to en
force the obligations of treaty agree
ment, and asks Congress for an act
specifically providing for the natural
ization of Japanese," says the San
Francisco Call.
"The executive message to the Fifty
ninth Congress on the occasion of the
beginning of its second session's work I
is one of the most remarkable docu
ments prepared by that author of start
ling state papers. Theodore Roosevelt.
Save for a reiteration of the recom- j
inendation for a reduction of the Phil- j
ippine schedules, the message ignores ,
1
the tariff, but is characteristically
(.(iiiiprenejisive in us treatment 01 umer
live subjects, from anti-injunction leg- 1
islation through a long category down !
to a desire to secure the relegation of
the whole subject of marriage and di
vorce to Congress. It is a human in
terest message, and besides the stric
tures laid upon San Francisco and one
or two otier unnamed places for their
alleged ill-treatment of the Japanese,
other striking features are an un
equivocal declaration against legisla
tion impairing the right of injunction:
a recommendation for the withdrawal
from sale or entry of all the Government-owned
coal lands: a flat declara
tion against Government ownership of
public utilities, and a request for a
law prohibiting corporate contributions
to campaign funds, directly or indi
rectly. ' The most remarkable feature of a
remarkable message is its treatment of
the San Francisco public school situa
tion, which caused the President to
st nd a member of his Cabinet to in
vestigate and which has very apparent
ly aroused the executive ire. Nearly
one-tenth of the message is devoted to
the exclusion of Japanese 'from the
common schools' un,'.er the head of in
ternational morality."

WORK OF

Washes Houses Away
and Wrecks Bridges
and Flumes.
The rainfall reported by the U. S.
Weather Bureau for the 24 hours end
ing 8 p. m. yesterday was 3.16 inches.
against an average of 0.49 for the same
date for the past seven years.
The storm began at 8 o'clock on Wed
nesday evening and was going strong
at two o'clock this morning, the down
pour at midnight being particularly
heavy. At that time the weather
showed no sign of moderating.
The most serious damage was to the
lateral storm drain flume in the Ma
kiki district, which was washed away,
involving damage of over $10,000.
As a consequence a great portion of
the Makiki district was flooded, the
1 ditch beinr converted into a roaring
1
j torrent.
Much dirt was swept over the car
track at points on Beretania avenue,
somewhat disrupting the Rapid Transit
schedule and keeping a
number of
i teams busy clearing the debris and
earth away.
The storm yesterday morning swept
away 200 feet of temporary flume at
Nuuanu dam. A quantity of gravel was
washed into the basin, which was tuii
up. to the opening in the concrete core
wall. 'Ihe auwntour which swept the
ilume away occurred between 5 and 5:3
a. m. and lasted about twenty minutes.
1 WTaikiki got its share of the storm,
and a number of algarabo trees in the
district were uprooted.
The water in the Kapiolani Park la
goon had been kept very low in antici
pation of a freshet and this alone pre
vented the place being flooded and
much damage done.
Ihe little bridge on the Diamond
Head road between Judge Dole's resi
dence and the Wilcox place was wash
ed out.
The crossings in the business distrioJ
were impassable all flay and those
whose business kept them outdoors had
a decidedly unpleasant experience.
The roads along the watertront were
a sea of mud. particularly along the
naval station, which was flooded, the
water at times being several inches
deep in the yard.
Palolo Valley 'had the heaviest down
pour in years and seven or eight small
houses belonging to Chinese and na
tives ar; reported to have been wash
ed away.
All the low land in the valley is under
water and the damage to property is
considerable.
The Pnloio stream was swollen to the
i-noiic--nM5, nf a river, and the bridge
at Molllill was awash to the arch. This

REFORMED

Suffragists Fight the Police.
(Associated Press Cablegrams.)
WASHINGTON, December 14. President Roosevelt will re
voke his order for the use of the reformed spelling in official docu
ments.
It is now three months since the President issued his famous order that
the "3QQ words" list was to be enforced in the gorenuaent offices and used
in all government reports and documents. The order was greeted by a storm
of protests stronger than any chorus of approval, while the matter was treated
upon by the press in every possible way. The leading educationalists of the
country refused to have auythiiig to do with the reformed spelling, the New
York school commissioners, who had been thought agreeable to it, turned it
down completely and finally the members of Congress refused to have it' used
in their printing. For once the President has had to take it all back.
BOBBIES ARREST WOMEN SUFFRAGISTS.
LONDON, December 14. Members of the women's suffrage
