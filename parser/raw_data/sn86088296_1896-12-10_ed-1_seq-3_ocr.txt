to cleanse our politics and improve,
economize and elevate the public service.

INTERSTATE COMMERCE COM-
aiissiOA.
xne interstate commerce commission
nas during tne last year, supplied nbund
ant evidence of its usefulness and the im-
8mPpcrs anu carriers, hut also to the vast
""""i"1"-- ui pruuui.-i.Tn mm consumers,
The justice and eanitv of the uriucinles
embodied in the existing . law passed for
the purpose of regulating these charges
are everywnere conceded and tnere ni-
pears to be no Question that the uolicv
tnus entered upou nas a permanent place
in our legislation. As the present stat
ute, when enacted, was in tlie nature of
tne case more or less tentative and ex
perimental it was hardly expected to sup
ply a complete and adequate system.
While its wholesome effects nre manifest
and having amply justified its enactment,
it is evident that all desired reforms iu
transportation methods
have not been
fully accomplished.
In view of the judicial interpretation
which some provisions of this statute
hnve received and the defects disclosed
by the efforts made for its enforcement
its revision nnd amendment appear to be
essential to the end thnt it may more ct
fectua My reach tne evils uestiued to
corrected. I hope the recommendation
of the commission upon this subject will
be promptly and favorably considered by
the congress. I desire to refer to the
statements elsewhere made eonrernin:
the government's receipts and expendi-
lllrts Ior ule purpose ot venturing upon
some suggestions touching our present
tariff law and its operation,
Tins statute took ettect on the ntn day
of August. 1894. Whatever may be its
shortcomings ns a complete measure of
tariff reform, it must be conceded that
it has opened the way to a fr?er and
greater exchange of commodities between
us and other countries nnd thus tumisli
ed a wider market for our products and
manufactures. The ouly entire hscnl
year during which this law hns been in
force ended . on the JUtn day. ot dune.
18!)ii. In the year our imports increased
over those of previous year more than
Sti.COO.000. while the value of the do
mestic products we exported and which
found mnrkets nbrond was nearly $70,-
000,000 more than during the preceding
year.
THE TARIFF,
Those who insist thnt the cost to tur
noonle of articles cominc to' them from
abroad for their needtul use should only
be increased through tariff charges to
an extent necessary to meet the expenses
of the government, ns well as those who
claim that tarilt charges may he laid
nnon such articles bevond the necessities
of government revenue and with the ad-
ditiona purpose of so increasing their
price in our markets as to give American
inanuiactures and producers Detier anu
more profitable opportunity, must agree
tint our tnrnr inws are oniv primarily
justified ns sources of revenue to enable
the government to meet tne neeossnry
pxnpiisps of its maintenance. Considered
as to its sufficiency in this aspect, ihe
present tariff law can by no means tall un-
ifpr inst condemnation. During the only
complete fiscal year of its .operation it
has yielded nearly $8,000,000 more reve
nue than was received from tariff duties
in the preceding year. There was, never
theless, between our receipts and our ex-
iiennitiires n little more than $25,000,000,
This, however, was not unexpected. The
s tiintinn wns such ill Ueceiiioer HIST,
seven months before the close of the
fispnl vpnr thnt the secretary of the treas
ury foretold a deficiency of $177,000,000,
the great and increasing apprehension
nnd timidity in business circles and the
depression in nil activities intervening
since that time from causes pertectiy
well understood and entirely disconnect
led with our tnriit mw ur nn ub.-iuuuii,
seriously checked the imports we would
have otherwise received and re.ulily ac-
ed with our tariff law or its operation.
count for the difference between tins es
timate of the secretary ot the trcasur
and the actual deficiency as well as for
a continued nencn.
Indeed, it must be confessed that we
could hardly have had a more unfavora
ble period than the last two years for
the collection of tariff revenue. We can
not reasonably hope that our recupera
tion from the business depression will hp
sudden, but it has already set in witu
a promise of acceleration and continu
ance. I believe our present tariff law. if
allowed a fair opportnntiy. will, in the
near future, yield a revenue which with
reasonably economical expenditures will
overcome' nil deficiencies. In iho mean
time no deficit that hos occurred, or may
occur, need excite or disturb us.
To meet nny such deficit we liavs m
the treasury, in addition to n gold re
serve of $100,000,000, a surplus of
more than $128,000,000 applicable to the
payment of the expenses of the fovern
iiient. nnd which must, unless expended
for the purpose, remain n useless hoard.
or if not extravagantly wasted, must, in
nny event, be diverted from the purpose
of its exaction from our people, flic
payment, therefore, of any deficiency in
the revenue from this fund is nothing
more than its proper and legitimate use.
The government thus applying a sur
plus fortunately in its treasury to the
payment of expenses not met by its cur
rent revenues, is not at all to lie likened

THE GOLD RESEItVK.
This reference to the condition nnd
prospects of our revenues naturally sug
gests nn allusion to the weakness and
vices of our financial methods. They
hnve lieen frequently pressed nnon thi
attention of congress in previous execu
tive communications nnd the. Inevitable
danger of their continued toleration
pointed out. Without now repenting
these details, I can not refrain from
again earnestly nresentintr the neeessitv
of the prompt reform of a system opposed
to every riue ot sound tmnnee anil shown
by owierionee to be fraught with the
gravest peril and perplexity. The terri
ble' civil war which shook tho founda
tions of oar government more than thirty
years ago brought in its' train the de
struction of property, the wnstmg of our
country's brave and the estrangement of
brethren; these nre now past and forgot
ten. The distressing loss of life- the con
flict entailed is but a sacred memory
which fosters patriotic sentiment nnd
keeps alive a tender regard for those who
nobly died. And yet there remains
with us today in full strength and activi
ty as an incident of that tremendous
struggle a feature of its financial neces
sities not only unsuited to our present.
circumstances, but manifestly n disturb
ing menace to business security 'and an
ever present agent of monetary djstress.
Because we may be enjoying n tempora
ry relief from its depressing influence,
this should not lull us into a false se
curity, nor lead us to forget the sudden
ness of past' visitations. I am more con
vinced than ever that we can have no
assured financial peace and bafety until
the government currency obligations, upon
which gold may be demanded from the
treasury, be withdrawn fr"m circulation
and cancelled. This might be done as
has been heretofore recommended, by
their exchange for long term Iwiids benr-
ine a low rate of interest or by their re
demption with the proceeds of such
bonds.
Even if only tho United States notes
known as greenbacks were thus retired
it is probable that the treasury note
issued iu payment of silver purchases
under the act of July Htn, tsuu. now
nnid in eold when demanded would not
create much disturbance, i.s they might
from time to time when received in the
treasury by redemption in gold or oth
erwise lie gradually and prudently re
placed by silver coin. This plan ot is
suing bonds for the purpose of redemp
tion certainly nnnenrs to bo the most
effective and direct path to the needed
reform.
In default of this, however, it would
be a step in the right direction if enrren
ev nbliffiitiotis redeemable in gold when
ever so redeemed should 1m cancelled
instead of being re-issued. This opera
tion would be n slow remedy, but it
would improve present conditions, Na
tional banks should redeem their own
notes; they should be allowed to issue
circulation to the par value or uonus de
posited as security for Its redemption ana
the tax on their circulation should be
reduced one-fourth of one per cent.
In considering projects tor the trcnt
mpiit nf United States notes and treasury
nr.tes issued under the new law of 1890; I
am of theopinionwehavephicedtoo much
stress upon the danger ot contracting me
currency and hnve calculated too littU
the ffrtld that would Ik? added to our
circulation if invited to us by better and
safer financial methods. It is not so much
contraction of our currency that should
be avoided as its unequal distribution.
This might be obviated and fear of harm
ful contraction at same tune reino.ed
by allowing the organization of small
banks nnd in less populous communities
than nre now. permitted, and also autho
rizing existing banks to establish
branches ,ia small communities under
proier restrictions.
The entire case may be presented by
tho statement that the day of sensible
nd sound financial methods will not
dawn upon us, until our government
bnndotis the banking business nnd the
ccumulation of funds and confines its
monetary operations to the receipt of the
mouev contributed by the people for its
support, nnd to the expenditure of such
money for the'peoplo's benefit. Our busi
ness interests npu all good citizens long
for rest from feverish agitation and the
inauL'iiration by the government of a re
formed financial policy, which will en
courage enterprise and make certain the
rewards oF labor and industry.
TRUSTS ANU MONOPOLIES.
Another topic in which our people
rightfully take a deep interest .may be
here brieflv considered. 1 refer to the
existence of trusts nnd other huge aggre-
ations of capital, the object of which
s to secuic the monopoly' of some partie-
ar braneh of trade industry or com

nd thus imiy benefit the public. It must
reincmU-red. however, that a reduc-
011 of prices to the people is not one of
ie real objects of these organizations.
nor is theij tendency necessarily in'thnt
irection. If it occurs in a particular
ase, it is only necauso it nccoros wnn

possible retrenchment is plainly mani
fest. When our differences nre forgotten

CATARRH VICTIMS.
An Extract From a Recent Lecture by
Dr. Hartman, of the Surgical Hotel,
Columbus, Ohio. .
Everybody has catarrh. If not every
body, ut least nearly everybody. Sumo
have catarrh in the form of a discharge
from, the nose, or hawking from the
throat. Some have it in the head, pro
ducing frontal headache, or crackling in
the enrs, or partial deafness. With some
it is confined to the throat, cr bronchial
tubes, producing hoarseness or sore
throat, cough or pain in the chest. Some
hnve it in ihe form of catarrhal con
sumption. Others have catarrhal dys
pepsiu. catarrh, of the liver, catarrh of
the kidneys, catarrh of the pelvic organs,
producing n host of diseases generally
known ns female diseases. Mitny of
these people do not suspect thut they
have catarrh. Their ail-nent has been
called something else. The reason they
have failed to find n cure is that they do
not suspect the real nature of their dis
ease. If they knew they hnd catarrh
they would take Pe-ru-n.i, ns Pe-ru-na
has come to be recognized everywhere ns
the standard internal remedy for ca
tarrh. This fact is lieyond cavil or doubt.
Thousands know it by happy experience.
A still greater multitude will find it out
during the coming winter, ns the ellicacy
of Pc-ru-na is rapidly becoming known
to the whole people.
Mr. Frank K. Ingalls, Waco, Texas,
writes ns follows:
"Pe-ru-na and Man-a-lin have cured me!
of one of the worst cases of catarrh any
one ever had. I heard that Pe-ru-im
would cure catarrh, and, on trying it,
found immediate relief. My case was so
severe that I was compelled to discon
tinue my business, that of a conductor on
a railroad; but now I am entirely well. I
want to recommend your medicine as be
ing a positive cure for catarrh; I feel it
my duty to do so."
The Pe-ru-na Drug Manufacturing
Company, of Columbus, Ohio, will send
to any address free of charge, a tU-pngu

Death in the
House.
Washington, Dec 7. The reassem
bling of congress today for the closing
session of the Fifty-fourth congress was
nu occasion of unusual brilliancy and
interest.
The opening day is always a gala af
fair, marking as it does the official in
auguration of the social as well as the
political season in Washington, but to
day it wns all the more interesting be
cause of tho long and hard-fought politi
cal battle that had been waged during
tho recess.
' The weather was perfect, cle-ir and
fairly warm. The throngs which
streamed up the hill to wltncBs the open
ing ceremonies formed an organized civic
pageant. Gay equipages, with a rattle
of chains, drawn by prancing steeds,
carried- the 'diplomats and the more
prominent in electoral life. The ele
gant turn-outs moved side by side with
vehicles of various kinds, onveying
legislators and visitors. The . un
numbered thousands moved up Penn
sylvania avenue. The corridors and
galleries were Boon throneed. There
were demonstrations for conspicuously )
prominent statesmen and at last came
the drop of the gavel, with the regulnr
ceremony attending the' opening of . the
session and the receipt . of the presi
dent's annual communication to con
gress. SENATE PROCEEDINGS.

entrance unable to gain admission.
Sir Julian Pauncefotp. accompanied
by members of Iris staff and several
members ot the diplomatic corps, were
in the callcry reserved for foreign repre
sentatives, nnd with them were several
ladies benring cards from Secretary
Olney. In the seats reserved for ladies
were Mrs. Stevenson and several other
ladies. Hack of them were daughters
and wives of many prominent members.
The crowds outside found comfort in
the seats to be had. although it resulted
in reducing the seating capacity almost
one-half,
The sepntors were rather late in nr-
riving.
Mr. Palmer (dem.) of Illinois came in
about 11:30 nnd wns a center of interest
from the gallery, owing to his promi
nence in the recent campaign. , ,
Mr. Tillman (dem.) of South Carolina
also came in for considerable attention
ns he went to his desk and busied him
self at writing. . , i .
There was plenty of color to ' greet
the senators, for tho room looked like a
conservatory, with many of the desks
bearing superb floral decorations,; The
senate officials were quick to note that
the tributes stood 10 to 1. sixteen beinir
on the republican side, although this pro
portion was broken, as many democratic
tributes were brought in just as the
session opened. The di&k of Mr. Wal
thall showed a graceful acknowledgment
of his actions. Senators Proctor, Mau
tie, Vest, Smith, Hlnckburn, Pasco;
Morgnn and Voorlui's were remembered

recognition and his resolution was first
to receive passage.

tion for n committee to await on the
president and had attended to that duty,
Mr. Morrill (rep.) of Vermont was the
first to suggest anything in the nature of
legislative business by presenting several
petitions asking for the pnssnge of the
Dingley bill. He yielded, however, .. to
Mr. Hoar's suggestion that all business
be deferred ns a mutter it courtesy until
the president nnd hoiMe of representa
tives had been communicated with, nnd
thereupon, at l'J:0Ti, the senate took a
recess until 1 o'elock.
At 1 o'clock there was a further recess
of twenty minutes and then at 1:45
Senator Sherman reported thut the presi
dent had been waited upon and would
communicate his views in writing.
Secretary Pruden of the White House
staff immediately stepped forward, mes
sage iu hand, and made the formal an
nouncement of n communication from
the president. It was taken to the pre
siding officers' desk, where the seal was
broken, and the secretary of the senate
began rending the document.
Most of the senators remained in their
seals while the reading was in progress
and followed it with close attention.
Printed copies were distributed and
the senators ran through these, picking
out the salient features, anticipating the
formal rending. .......
The Turkish minister, Mustaphn Bey,
accompanied by his secretary and nn
attache, entered the gallery shortly bo
fore the clerk reached the president's
words as to prospective action to stop
Turkish indignities, which shocked the
civilized world. They left the gallery
immediately after this portion of the
message was rend.
