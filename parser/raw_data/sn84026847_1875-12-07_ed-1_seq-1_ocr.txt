Yes, why nut? There are a great
many things it would be interesting to

Mv'cheap atid it is shrewdly suspected
that the State lo-t a large sum of money
tin-rrhy. and that some friend of the
ll? i al- who was Governor at that time
wss enabled to make a tine speculations
jrely that's a subject worth looking into.
Yet again, it would bo very well to inr
stigale into the truth of the statei
'-nt made by the Intelligencer of
y.fterJay, that when the Radicals
were turned out of power, they turned
v. r to their Democratic successors a full
Trea- ,ry. Certain of the oldest inhabitants
have whispered in our ear, that
when the Democracy took charge, there
was missing from the school fund the

t?o douhtless read with interest: In the

house near the Jackson Cemetery, at the

Clcmmcns, his wife and six children.
The records of the Harrison County
Court show that at a term held on the
j 28th oi November, 1805, the above menllioio
i Abel Clcmmcns was arraigned
upon the charge of having on the night

T!ie opi ning <>! the Forty-fourth Congress
was marked by the presence in amJ

than probably ever before watched tin

and dreary weather seemed to huvelittk
or no cH'ect in restraining the eagernc<;
of the multitude which have flown into tin
city during the past, few days, and from
an early hour the galleries of the Hojis?
wore packed as closely aa possible, and al
the approaches and every available spac<
became giadually tilled up, until as tin
hour of noon approached, it was almost
impossible for one to make his way ir
any direction through the seekers o!

At twelve o'clock the House was ca I let

Ib.use ol the Forty-third Congress, ant
j the hall was cleared of all not entitled t<

was very full, nearly every seat lie1

Mr. Mel'hvr*on then called the names

with Maine.
In regard to representation from tin
d-M di.-lriet ot New York, I ho Clerk reminded
the House that the person tirsl
elected had died, and the person electee
to till the vacancy had presented credentials
.-o peculiar in form that thn Clcrl
preferred t-> submit the question to tin
House.
In reference to the Louisiana delegation
the Clerk said he had received tw<
.-els ??f certificates for the first four ditriets,
both sets indicating the election o
the sutne persons; that as to the tilth dis
triet he had received two certificates,nn<
signed Win. I'itt Kellogg, showing tlx

Address of llie Mpeaker.
The Speaker on taking his position
! said:
Gentlemen of the House of Keprcsen
tatives:?am heartily grateful to yot
i'or the honor which you have conform
I upon ine in calling me to this exaltet
! station. 1 profoundly appreciate the ini
j portarice^and delicacy ot its duties.
.-hall doubtless many times need you
; patient indulgence. I pray that yo
will grant it, and with nothing but kind
Iv feelings towards every member of th
House, i promise that in all my ollieia
acts 1 will divest myself to the utmost >
my ability, of all personal bias and oh
serve complete fairness and impartialit
towards all, and towarda all the gren
and diversified interests of our countr
represented in this House."
Mr. Kelly, of Pennsylvania, as th
oldest member of the House in oontin
I iious service, administered the oath i
1 office to the Speaker. '
! The oath of otlice was thee adminii
tered by the Speaker to the members, bi
ginning with those fri m the New Kng
land States, who on being called range
themselves in the area in front of th
I clerk's desk,* and thera with uplifte
hands went through their part of the cert
I niony. "What is known as the iron cla
| oath was the form administered; to th
[, W. VA., TUESDAY
members unable to take that oath,
the modified oath was administered. j
Mr. Wood, of New York, objected to
| Morey, of Louisiana, and Mr. Garfield |
to Goode, of Virginia. Therefore these !
I gentlemen were not permitted to qualify,
j Subsequently Mr. Wood offered a resolu- j
! tion referring the credentials of Morey
j and Spencer to the Committee on Klec- i
| lions, with instructions to report which
' 1 of them is entitled to a seat. He said ho
I did not propose to raise the question
; as to who was the legal Governor
, of Louisiana. It was not pertincht.
j to th is inquiry to determine that question,
' the sole and exclusive question being us
J to what form of credential-the respective
j claimants presented.
Air. Blaine declared that there.was no j
J more official ground for speaking of John j
McEnery as Goverlior of Louisiana than
I there was for speaking of the gentleman
I [Wood] as Governor of New York.
I This department of the Government had
j never recognized AlcEnery, and the
! House at the last session by a very large
| vote, to which many gentlemen on the
Democratic side of the House were con
| senting and many of them anxious that j
j the resolution should pass, had solemnly
j recognized Kellogg as Governor of Lou- j
j isiana, and for the gentleman from New ;
^ ork to make the statement that the
. i Governorship of L< uisiana was still a
I matter of doubt?was still in suspense,
I i wa.- to place the House in a wrong posii
I lion.
i, | lie thought tliat the Clerk would have
. | been perfectly justified in tearing 'upas
s ! waste paper the credentials signet! by
> | MeKnery. lie trusted that the gentle i
i man from New York did not wishtoopen
. I up the whole Loui-iuna cast on this qi.es|
i tion.
, Air. Wood replied that the papers in
. the ease id' all the members lroni Lotiisil
ana were themselves a sufficient answer
i to the gentleman, for if there was no
f possible question as to who was Goverj
nor ol Louisiana, why was
. | it that all the members of
| that State had deemed it necessary toobI
lain the certificate of MeKnery, unless
; they deemed it important to come here
clothed w ith the certificate of each Govr
ernor? Ho did not propose to raise in
' this inquiry the question as to who was
' j or was not Governor ot L< uisiana. 'i he
. ' question to be determined in tho first
! place was whether Morev presented ero.
i dentials that entitled hint to a seat oil
this lloor.
Mr. Wheeler said lie had trusted
? that the question as to who was Governor
"t of Louisiana hud been set at rest at
' lea-t until the next general election, and
regreled that for tiiis paltry advantage
it should again be raised. Not only had
Mr. Kellogir been recognized as Governor
of Louisiana by the President of the
United States and by both houses, but

solemn statute passed by its Legislature j
1 | at its extra session held last April.
" | Mr. Wood remarked that the question j
1 | settled last session had been confined en*
j tirely to the legislature and not the eleci
tion of Governor.
1 i Mr. Lamar said that the Clerk of the
j House had made known to the House the
1 i existence of the controversy, not only
31 with reference to the merits ot the ques"
i tion, hut with reference to the/>rutnt/ucin
j right to a seat in the Ilouse. The House
' was in possession of the fact that there
' i was such a controversy. It might be a
3 j very simple and a very intelligable
' question, but still it was a question
of la .v as to whether this certificate was
( | signed by the proper governor or not.
jit had lieen crystal i/ed into a regular I
i imrlinmentarv law that a uue.-tion in vol v- I
i iitg iii'ttnu focia right as w -II as the merit
j ol the ease should be referred to the Com'
uiittceon Elections,
Mr. ltlaine asked Mr. J^Titnur whether
in thu history of thejllouso he know of
anv case where tiie credentials or preI
.'tended credentials of a pretended govers
I nor,, who had never been rucogni/ed as
I j governor by at y department of the
' J United States or by his own State had
: been referred to that coiuinitteo. Jle
i trusted that his friend [Mr. Lamar] with
! his well known moderation would restrain
' j his party from placing en record such an
I ' outrage, not only on State rights, of
j which he [Mr. Lamar J was such an cx
| amplar and advocate,|hut on the rules of
* j cointii"ii decency us well.
U Mr. Lamar remarked that the qucsI
Lion, whether one of these pretended
- j (governors was really Coventor or not,
t J was the very question to be referred to
! the committee.
Mr. Elaine- Then I understand the
J gentleman to mean that this is the formal
? i opening of the whole Louisiana case, und
- not merely a question as to the sent of a
I member.
.Mr. Lamar -Tie gentleman simply
> understands that the question which the
- Clerk of the House has remitted to the
r House (whether or not it involves other
- pie.-tiotis as to the validity of the guber- i
I natorial incumbent of Louisiana), is a I
1 question which ought not to be decided |
- informally 011 the mere seating of a
member, but ought to be formally re- |
1 i (Wrcil to h committee, gravely and ma- I
I turclv.
r j Mr. Bluino askrd whether it was not a
f matter of History that last year, in what ;
I was known a.-> the Louimuna adjustment, ,
; it was perfectly understood that the j
r j llou-e declaring Kellogg to be Governor
t' was a fluid settlement; and whether the
} gentleman from Georgia (Stephens), the j
> j very bone of the Democratic party, had |
- ! not voted with the Republicans avowedly j
v | tiial it might be a limii settlement. Del ,
y j his honorable Iriend (Lamar) come here
I. now to head a movement to trample on !
the other side, after agreement, and to !
1 itop? n the whole ea-e?
0 .Mr. Lamar admitted that there had
1 been a compromise fast session and that j
s that compromise did acknowledge Kel- :
i logg Governor of Louisiuna. He hoped 1
tlie gentleman from Mew York [Wood]
would, acting on the suggestion of Mr.
, lloar. modify his resolution by omitting
the preamble and merely rclerring the
- matter to the Committee on Elections
u with instructions to report on the prima
ii | facie case.
1 . .Mr Wood inodilicd hi; resolution aci

1 Slax ioenl of ihc < Irrk.
r i The Clerk of the House with pcrmisu
sion of the House made the following
i-1 statement: The controlling fact, which,
e hi my judgment, required me to accept
d the Kellogg certificate, was that prior to
4 the making up of the roll on the 4th of
?- March last, there had been a recognition
y by the House of Representatives of Win. j
t l'itt Keilogg as Governor of J,oui-inna.
y and that at that time ho was ,U. /? /?
Governor of the Stale. In view
e of this recognition of the executive
i- branch of the government by all of the
f departments of the government and by
. that part of the legislative branch ot the
I. government to which the clerk is response
sible. I tclt myself absolutely concluded
> ! and therefore I inserted the names red
turned by Governor Kellogg, without
e anv reference whatever to the political
d aspect of the ease.
A tier further discussion, participated
d in by Messrs. llolman, Banks, Cox and
e i Jones, the previous question was
MORNING, DEC EM
seconded, and the main question was j
ordered, yeas, 135; nays, 134. The question
was then put on the resolution, an<T
it was rejected.
Mr. Blaine then moved that Mr. Frank
Morey, bavin-- presented credentials j
signed in due form by Governor lyillogg.
be sworn in as a member.
Mr. Randall suggested to strike out of
the motion that purl recognizing Kellogg
as Governor.
Mr. Blaine s?M be was perfectly will- I
ing to do so, and having so modified it,
the motion was agreed to and Mr. Morey
was sworn in accordingly.*
The questions as to the right of Goode
of Virginia were next taken up and after
a short discussion Mr. Goode was sworn
in as a member, taking the modified
oath.
The question as to the Vacancy in the
thirty-third district of Sew York was
then taken up and after statements by
Messrs. Norton and Cox, the representative
elect was sworn in and the technical

Nos. 166 and 167 are those adopted in i

Mr. Randall replied that immemorial

Death from Alcoholic Poisoning.
Coll*mnrs, December <i.?.lames Contry,
a boiler-maker, started on u spree
last Saturday, and list night spent the
evening in a saloon. About ten o'clock,
while playing cards, he was noticed to
drop his cards and apparently fall asleep.
At tir.?t no notice was taken ol his actions,
it lining supposed that he was
merely stupified with liquor, but some
time after it was found impossible to
awaken him. A physician was summoned.
The man remained in a stupor until
5 o'clock this morning, when he died.
Con try came to this city trom Cleveland
in October, arid until recently has'been
sober. A coroner's jury decided that tie
deceased came to bis death from alcoholic
poisoning.

Dreadful ?xplo*ioii In bColliery.
| London, December 6.?The colliery at
which the dreadful explosion aceurred
to-day belongs to Mitchell & Co., and is
I one of the largest in Southern Yorkshire. '
It is joined by underground workings J
with* Edmund's ninin colliery, where j
twelve years ago yesterday over three j
hundred persons perished. The works
extend for many miles. They are entirely
worked with safety lamps, under rigid :
discipline and were considered safe. At (
six o'clock about three hundred men and
boys descended and commenced work as
usual. At *J:30 a 'terrible explosion j
occurred. The exact position of the ex- j
plosion is at present unknown, but the J
i miners of all parts of the pit were j
j startled by a loud report, followed by
| large volumes of smoke, and those who
I were able rushed to the pit bottom, but
the drawing cage was displaced. As
I soon as possiblo volunteers were organ;
izod to search lor the dead and dying,
I and those who had escaped. After being
down for some time the volunteers
j reported that they had met with great
j difficulty. They saw many who were
I alive, hut unconscious. It is impossible
| now to give the number lost. It is
| feared that the tirst report (two hun!
sJrn/ll will h<? <?r?nfirmivl thoiifh
j the managers nt the colliery hope that
many may he saved. The operatives of
I all the collieries of tho district are on
the spot, ready and anxious to do every- j
thing possible lor the relief of the sutlerers.
All the local surgeons have also ar[
rived. All those rescued thus far are
seriously burned and otherwise injured.
Hundreds of men, women and children
are congregated at the inouth of the pit,
arid rus tho bodies are drawn to the surface
the sceno is of the most heart-rend'
ing character.
Latest accounts from the Swaithe colliery
indicalo that the total number ol
lives lost was 140. The explosion was
caused by careless blasting operations.
Another disaster of a similar character is
reported to day, in a coal mine 'near
Pentyreh, in south Wales, in which
twelve persons were killed and injured I

London, December C.?The Mark !
Lane Express, in a review of the grain j
markets of the past week, says: "The i
unusually severe winter having com- j
pletely stopped field <ubor, and partially |
closed tho Baltic, has caused wheat to
harden somewhat, but owing to the
quantity of grain in granary, there is
little prospect of a materiul advance before
spring. Tho character of the
weather, then, will be unusually important.
Should anything happen, an advance
of ten shillings would easily occur.
In l'aris Hour has recovered one
franc. Good samples of wheat are rather
dearer. The same remark applies to
the French provinces, Belgium, Holland,
Germany, Austria and Hungary. Kain
has fallen in Northern Africa."
