WASHINGTON. Dec. 4.? A def- j
inite statement to the world of
America's war aims and of the ,
basis upon which peace will be
considered was made today by
President Wilson in an address
to congress in which he urged
immediate declaration of a state
of war between the United States
and Austria-Hungary ? Germany's
vassal and tool. As to Turkey
and Bulgaria ? also tools of the
enemy ? he counselled delay 6e
cause "th?y do not yet stand in i
the direct path of our necessary i
action."
To win the war. the president
declared in emphatic and ringing I
tones, is the immediate and unal
terable task ahead. He u'-ged
congress, just beginning its sec- j
ond war session, to concentrate j
itself upon it.
The president sharply dis- !
missed the possibility of prima
ture# peace, sought by German in- j
trigue and debated here by men j
who understand neither its nature j
nor the way it may be attained, j
With victo-y an accomplished ;
fact. lie said, peace will be cvolv- j
ed based upon "mercy and jus- j
tice" ? to enemy and friend ? with ,
hope cf partnership of nations to ;
? guarantee future wor'd peace. t

TEXT OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Oentlemen of the Congress: , i
"Eight months have elapsed since I J
last had the honor or' addressing you. I
They have been months ?? row clod with;
?wnts of immense and gravi> slenifi-'
oanco for us. I shall ti"t undertake
to detail or even to summarize these;
events. The practical things of the
part we have played in th'-ni will hu
iatd before you in the reports the
executive departments. 1 shall dls- >
cuss only our present out'.ook upon
these vast affairs, our present duties,
atid the immediate means of accum
pllshing the objects we shall hold
always in view.
Games of "War Obvioa-i.
"[ shall not ?<> hack '?? d.-bate the'
causes of th" war. The intolerable;
wrongs done and planned against us by
the sinister masters of 'ierirany have
long since become too grossly obvious
and odious to every true American to
ne"d to be rehearsed Hut 1 shall ask
you to consider strain and with a very
grave scrutiny our objectives and the
measures by which we m<??n to attain
them: for the purpose of discussion here
in this place is notion, and ? -ur fiction'
must move straight towards definite
ends. Our object is. of course, to win
the war: and we shall no; slacken or
suffer ourselves to diverted until it
Is won. But it is worth i vhlle asking
and answering the question when shall
wc consider the war won?
The People Kno-w. i
"From' one point of view it is r.ot
necessary t'> broach this fundamental
matter, f do not doubt that the Ameri
can people know wha: the war is about:
and what sort of an outcom- they will i
regard a realization of rhe|r purpose
ir It. As a nation wo ar?> united In
spirit ami int-ntion. I pay little
to those who fll ni'- otherwise. I hear
tlip voices nf dissent ? who d<?\s not V I
hear the criticism and lh? clamor of
the noisily thoughtless and trouble- ,
some. I also see toon here anil t h.-r"
fling themselves in impotent disloyalty !
against t ho calm. indomitable power uf
the natl< n. I hoar men debate peace
who understand neither its nature nor
tin; way In which wo may obtain it with
uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits. Hut
1 know that" none of these speaks t'or
the nation. They do not touch the heart
of anything. They may safely 1 ! ?? f t
:o strut their uneasy hour and be for- 1
gotten.
America's "War Aim*.
"But from another point of v>w I he- j
lieve that !t Is necessary to say plainly ;
what we here at the sea'*?f action con- ?
siiler the war to be t'or and what port i
w? mean to play In tho settlement of;
its searching Issues. We arc tho spokes-'
men of the American people and they,
have a right to know whothc-r their ;
purpose is ours. They desire peac* by!
the overcoming of evil, bv the defeat f
once for nil of the sinister forces that!
interrupt peace and render it Impossible 1
and they wish t" know how closely our!
thoughts run with theirs and what r?c-j
ilo? we propose. Thcv are Impatient!
with those who desire peace bv any'
sort of compromise ? deeply mid indlK- !
nantly ' impatient ? but 'they will be i
equally impatient with us If we do not '
make it plain to them what our objec
tives are and what we are planning for
