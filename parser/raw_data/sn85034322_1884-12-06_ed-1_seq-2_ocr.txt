CHESTER A. ARTHUR.

of ««

In tie ciosiug portion
President's message he aoknowl
members
operation
Congress in their oo
to promote the best in
n
generally for the support which they
have accorded him in his adminis
tration.
The American^people,irrespective
of parties,feel that they have strong
reason for this kindly feeling to
ward President Arthur.
Called to the Executive chair
under circumstances mostappalling,
and, to an extent, personally em
barrassing, he has, for over three
years, discharged the duties of his
high trust in a way approaching
nearer to an universal satisfaction of
the Nation than ever befell the lot of
any other President. Toward him
partisan bitterness became assuaged
and wbat might be considered as
beat evidence of his patriotic states
manship, sectional feelings and
fears were obliterated, by a grow
ing confidence in bis wisdom and
impartiality. Indeed, so true is
this, that a good word for the
retiring President is as frequently
heard in Southern homes as through
out the Northern States; and after
surrendering to his successor the
power aud patronage of official life,
he will still, with the affection ot the
people retain the influence ever, in
a republio, attached to wise and
honorable citzenship.
The reasons for the administra
tion of President Arthur living so
popular are the simple ones, that,
though elected to the Vice Presi
dency through the candidacy of a
party, yet on becoming the actiug
President, be kept conscientiously
his oath to discharge the duties as
Executive toward the people of
6V€Vy section And every politics! j
party. A duty accompanied, it
true, with embarrasuients, yet not
beyond tbe power of any executive,
State or Federal. Every iluty he
discharged, every measure lie recoin
mended or approved, evidence« a
common purpose for tbe common
good. He considered the inhab
itants of the States lately in rebel
liou as entitled to the just adminis
tration of the laws; and the
improvement of tlieir rivers ami
harbors as all their material interests
met at bis hands just consideration.
Such course of action, whether in
public or private life, deserves and 1
generally receives just appieciation.
This spirit pervades all the re
oommeudatious of President Ar
thur'« recent message to both
Houses of Congress.
