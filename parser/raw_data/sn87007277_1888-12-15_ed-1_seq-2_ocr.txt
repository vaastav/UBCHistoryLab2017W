A Big Lease for a Cattle Range.
Chicago, Dec. 7th. A dispatch
from Kansas City says: Tho Chero
kee & Live Stock Association will
have to pay $200,000 per year for
their lease during thc next five
years. The Cherokee Cattle As
sociation secured a lease from the
Indians of a portion of the Cherokee
strips for which they paid an annual
rental of $100,000. In October the
lease expired, and the association,
with 200,000 head of cattle on hand,
had no place to graze them. The
Indians were offered $100,000 a
year; then $125,080; then $150,000;
and finally $175,000. The council
at each time ratified the contracts,
but Chief May each time vetoed
the lease, and it could not be pass
ed over his veto. He placed the
rental at $200,000 a year. The
cattlemen refused to look at it. A
temporary arrangement was fixed
upon that would last until January
first, and the cattlemen have had
to give in. President C. M. Koe
wins, of thc association, and S. S.
Hutton, one of the directors arrived
from Tahlequah yesterday, and an
nounced that the lease had been
signed and delivered to them by
v iiitfi .nay ai ;i mcu rental OI

A Remarkable Yield.
Raymond Gazette: A farmer
writing from Vernon parish, La.,
tells how he managed to raise three
bales of cotton on two acres of land,
as follows:
First. The land was old pine
land, which had been in cultivation
ten or twelve years, and the last
crop raised on the land before the
present crop was oats.
Second. In the management of
tho land, I in tho first place took a
shovel plow and ran tbe rows off
4 feet apart. I then filled this
furrow with fertilizing from the
stables and rakings from the tramp
yard, bedded out on that, and then
planted it first Monday in April.
Third. I cultivated it as follows:
When it was large enough to work
I ran a scouter plow around it and
chopped it out to a stand. After
this I used the scouter fastened to
1 8olid 8Weep and whenever the
, m:,l Ji
es became grassy or needed
work I used the junior cultivator,
running in once in a row. I plowed
,

I vation it received,

Washixoton, Dec. 7, 1888.
Senator Blackburn, owing to the
wide advertisement of his recent
misunderstanding with JudgeRuck-1
er, has been the center of attraction
to the visitors in the Senate gallery
this week. He positively refuses
to talk about the matter, but his
friends regard it as ended at least
that is what they say.
Senator Harris, by a motion to
, the Senate bin on the
taU brought out the fact that the

withstandi the fact that 8everal
q( m are known tQ fce biUerlj,
j , tQ certain gecliong of thc
.... - . pvnlflnntlons ... ;vcn
for this action by parties who pro
fess to know. One is that Harrison
has slated that he wants the bill
passed at this session, and that
those republicans that are opposed
to it are afraid to vote against it,
lest they thereby lose their share
of patronage under the new ad
ministration; another is, that they
know the bill will not pass thc
House and only vote for it to keep
up an appearance of harmony in
the republican ranks until after
Harrison is inaugurated, leaving
the quarrel that is believed by
j many people to bo inevitable over
the tariff, until the next session,
when they will control both House
and Senate.
The President's message was an
able statement of the position of
the democratic party on thc tariff
' '
message are ponderous with states
manlike wisdom: "He mocks the
people who proposes that thc
Government shall protoct the rich,
and that they in turn will care for
the laboring poor. Any intermedi
ary between thc people and their
government, or the least delegation
of the care and protection the
Government owes to thc humblest
citizen in the land, makes the boast !
of free institutions a glittering de-1 PxB' brlck-yard, near Tangipa
lusion and the pretended boon of hoa Dr. J. J.Gossis a practic
Amcrican citizenship a shareless H"8 Ph'sician' (,ro88'8t editor of

with all their demoralizing conse
quences should not be tolerated,
cither as a means of relieving the
treasury of its present surplus, or
as furnishing pretext for resisting
a proper reduction in tariff rates."
"It cannot be denied
that the selfish and private interests
which are so persistently heard
when efforts are made to deal in a
just and comprehensive manner
with our tariff laws, are related to
if they are not largely responsible
for, the sentiment largely prevail
ing among the people, that the
general Government is the fountain
1 ot individual and private aid; tnat
I it may be expecced to relieve with
'paternal care any distress of citizons
j communities, and that from
the. fullness of its Treasurv it should

it i: . :i.i .Jdcem
I UP" M" "B"v purine f1""1;
j of promoting the general good, ap-;
. ......... .
ply public tunds to the benefit of
localities and individuals. Nor can
it be denied that there isa growing
assumption that as against the
Government and in favor of privato
claims and interests, the usual
rules and limitations of business
principles and just dealings should
be waived. These ideas have been
unhappily much encouraged by
legislative acquiescence. Relief from
contracts made with the Govern
ment is too easily accorded in favor
of the citizen; the failure to sup
port claims against the Government
by proof is often supplied by no
better consideraiton than the wealth
of tho Government and tbe poverty
of the claimant; gratuities in the
form of pensions are granted upon
no other real ground than the
needy condition of the applicant,
or for reasons less valid; and large
sums are expended for public build
ings and other improvements upon
i representations scarcely claimed to
be related to public needs and ne-
oeseiUes."
The House yesterday by unani
mous consent took up the direct
tax bill,' which caused tbe long
deadlock last spring. It is expect
ed that it will be passed, but hopes
are expressed by its opponents
that Mr. Cleveland will veto it.
Mr. Harrison's backbone is like
ly to suffer a severe strain between
now and the fourth ot March. The
republican leaders here have de
termined upon having an extra
session of the Fifty-first Congress
called to meet late in March or
early in April. There is not the
lightest necessity of an extra ses
sion; the republicans acknowledge
.that their only object in having it
called is to gain the six Senators
land as many Representatives as
, South Dakota, Montana and Wash-
ington, when admitted as slates,!
shall be entltleu to. Iney hsvede
j cided that owing to their very nar-
row margin in both Houses, tins
action is necessary in order to en
able thc new states to organize and
send their Senators and Representa
tives in time for the beginning of
the regular December session. It
remains fur Mr. Harrison to de
cide if he will allow his party
leaders to compel him to call a
needless session for the sake of a
few more votes.
"Murder Will Out."
Magnolia Gazette: Atfouro'clock
onSaturday afternoon, theCoroner's
jury finished its arduous labors
and returned a verdict finding that
Mr. F. H. Varnado came to his
death on the evening of November
22, 1888, from a gun-shot wound in
the body, made and fired therein
by a gun in the hands of Henry
Sheridan, colored, and further,
finding tho said Henry Sheridan
guilty of murder and J. J. (loss
and W. E. Rials, accessories. The
accused have been arrested and
are now in the County jail.
The murder of Mr. Varnado was
the most dastardly crime ever com
mitted in the State. It was planned
and most brutally executed. So
carefully was the plot laid, that it
baffled the skill of an expert. The
investigation of the case was made j
under great difficulties and the j
Coroner's jury deserve great credit
for the faithful and fearless manner I
in which they discharged their
duty. They spent six long and
tedious days in investigating the
case, during which forty witnesses
were examined, several of whom
were placed upon the stand two or
three times. Many of the witnesses
were afraid to testify and the jury
had to adjourn twice to await de
velopments. The principal, Henry Sheridan,
is a negro about thirty-five or forty
years of 8e- He wa8 raptured at
w. mais, tne other accessory,
is founder and general manager of
"The Southern Medicine Com
pany," manufacturers of "Rial's
Lung Balm" and "Indian Lini
ment," and is about fifty years old. j
The preliminary trial began bc-j
fore Justices of the Peace, W. L.
Walker and W. E. Butler, on
yesterday. The State is represent
ed by Messrs. J. C. Lamkin, of
Summit, S. E. Packwood, of Mag
nolia and H. C. Capell, of Centre
ville. Dr. Goss has employed
Messrs. H.Cassedy, of Brookliaven,
Cassedy & Stokes, of Summit, and
J. B. Stcmberger, of Magnolia, to
defend him the other two prison
ers have no counsel at present.
We shall not publish any of the
testimony just now, because we
it unnecessary, if not im-
(
Pj
nrpiiupf
e feel sure that the
accused will be given a fair and
impartial trial and that cvenhand
ed justice will be done them in the
end. With tho present lights be
fore us, we can not see how either
of them could be granted bail.
Farmers' and Laborers' Union.
Meridian, Miss., Dec. 8. The
Alliance and Wheel convention now
in session in this city decided to
make a second change in the name
of their consolidated organization
to-day. The order will now be
known as the Farmers' and Labor
ers' Union of America.
The officers chosen yesterday
are to remain as officers of the new
association. The various com
mittees selected have not up to this
writing made a final report, and in
consequence o$jthe pressure of the
business incident to closing tbe
session, this report will nut be
given to the public until later on.
The secretaries of the various
committees have been busily en
gaged in perfecting their reports,
but want of time before the closing
of the convention will prevent that
full report which will appear later.
The convention will adjourn this
evening, deciding to hold the next
annual convention in St. Louis on
2d of December next.
Many of the delegates aro leav
