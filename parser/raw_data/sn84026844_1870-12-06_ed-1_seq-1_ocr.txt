The Storm Bnd the News.
A fierce storm prevailed yesterday to
the West, and last night in the North and
East. Some of thetclcgrapbs were prostrain],
and the lines not interrupted in this
tvay were so much affected liy the unusual
conditions of the atmosphere as to render
telegraphing tedious, difficult, and at
Irist imixisstylc. In consequence ol
this untoward state of allaire, our general
news report Is Bhnrt this morning,and
that of the President's message far from
perfect. The message began to come between
two and three o'clock in the afternoon
and was not concluded till about
eleven. We have ilono our best to reconcile
the discrepancies in the report and
make the document connected and intelligible,
but have not wholly succeeded.

Views of Senntor Morton.
Wahhinoton, Dec. 4.
Senator Morton, who arrived yesterday,
is confined to bis room by lameness, anu
will be unable to take his sent to-morrow.
On the subject of the projected revenue
reform movement, the Senator savs the
scheme is a very weak one, and has no
possible chance of success; that it is without
organization or strength, and that no
combination coidd be elfeeted between
the Democrats and those of the Kepubliean-a
who favor a new organization. lie
believed that the Republicans were taught
a lesson at the late election which they
will never torget, and that hencelorth the
party will be more united than ever belorc,
and there will be less division and
disagreement*. JJc thinks it not impossible
that some personal controversies may
arise iu the Senate, but lie thinks the party
will prolit by the errors ot the past year.
On the subject of the finances, he believes
that there will be little action during
the session, further than to modi*
Iv the provisions of the Funding Act, on
account of the seeming impossibility ol
floating less than a five j>er cent loan. He
expresses the belie! that Governor Vance
will not be admitted as Senator from
North Carolina, and that Congress will
not accord general amnesty to the rebels,
and that it ought not. Senator Morton is
strongly in favor ot aiding our commerce
by taking advantage ol the pres
cut European complication to placc
United States steamers on the ocean, and
he favors the buying of foreign vessels, to
a certain limit, until we can build them
for ourselves. With this question lie
does not think his tarilf principles have
anything to do, and he believes that il
Congress had followed the President'?
recommendation, in his commercial mes
sage of last July, the United Stales would
now own and have runniug all the German
lines of steamers, and that its commerce
would bo in a prosperous condition.
lie has no doubt that a bill in aid
of our merchant marine will be passed
during the present session.
President's Message,
To the Senate and
House of Iieprctenlatiwi:
A year ol peace and general prosperity
to this nation has passedf siuce the last as
sembling of Congress. VTfc have, througt
a kind Providence, been blessed will
abundant crops, and have beeu sparec
from complications and war with foreigr
nations. In our midst comparative liar
nmny has been restored. It is to be re
gretted, however, that a freo exercise o
the elective franchise has by violence and
intimidation been denied to citizens ir
exceptional cases, in several of the
States lately iu rebellion, and the vcrdicl
of the people has thereby beeu reversed
The States of Virginia, Mississippi ant
Texas have been restored to representa
tion in our national councils. Georgia
the only Suite now without representation
may confidently be expected to take hei
placc there also at the beginning of the
new year, and then let us hope will bt
completed the work of reconstruction
with an acquiescence on the part of th(
whole people, in the national obligation
to pay tuc puoiio ueoi ureauxi u* [no priu
or uur Union, tlio pensions to our dbutblcc
soldiers unci sailors and their widows anil
orphans, and in tho changes to llio Constitution,which
have been made necessary bj
a great rebellion. There Is no reason
why wo should not advance in material
prosperity and happiness as no other na
tion ever did after so protracted and devastating
n war.
Soon alter the existing war broke oul
in Europe, the protection of the United
States Ministry in Paris was invoked it
favor of the North Germans domiciled It
French territory. Instructions were Is
sued to grant the protection. Tills liai
been lollowed by an extension of Atnerl
ran protection to tho citizens of Saxony
Hesse and Saxo-Coburg-Gotha, C'olom
bia, Portugal, Uruguay, and the Domini
can ltcpublic, Ecuador, Chili, Paraguay
and Venezuela In Paris. The charge was
an onerous one, requiring constant ant1
severe labor, as well us tho cxcrcisc ol
putienco, prudence anil good judgment
It has been performed to the entire satis
faction of this government,and as I am ofil
dally informed equally so to the satisfac
tion of the government of North Germany
As soon as 1 learned that n republic had
been proclaimed at Paris, and that tht
people of France had acquiesced In the
change, the Minister of the United Statu
was directed by telegraph to recognize it
and to tender my congratulations anil
those ol the people of the United States
The establishment in France of a system
of government disconnected with tiic dynastic
traditions of Europe appeared to be
n proper subject for tho iellcitation n
Americans. Should the present strugeh
result in attaching the hearts of tin
French to our simpler forms ol represen
tativc government, It will be a subject 01
still further satisfaction to our people.
While we make 110 effort to impose oul
institutions upon tho inhabitants of othci
niunirles, and while we adhere to our tra
ditional neutrality in civil contests elsewhere,
we cannot be Indifferent to the
Wad of American political ideas in t
great and highly civilized countiy like
r'rance. We were asked by the new
government to use our good ofllccs jointlj
with those of Eurojiean powers in the in
iirest of pence. Answer was made thai
Hie established policies anil tho true iuter
wis of the United States forbado them tc
interfere in European quections. Jointly
witli European powers, I ascertained
unofficially that tho Government 0'
North Germany was not disposed U
listen to such representations from anj
powers, and though earnestly wishing tc
see the blessings of peace restored to tht
belligerents, with all of whom tho United
Mates are on terms of friendship, I de
dined on the port of this Government tc
take a step which could only result in ID'
1 Jury to our truo Interests, without advancing
the object for which our Intervention
wits invoked. Should the time come when
the action ol the United Suites can hasten
tho return of peace by a single hour, tiial
action will be heartily taken. I deemed
it prudent, in view of the number of |iersons
of German and French birth living
- in the United States, to issue sixm aftei
official notice of a state of war had been
received from both belligerents, a proclamation
defining tho duties of tho United
States as a neutral and tho obligations ol
persons residing 'within tills territory tc
observe tbelr laws and thu law of nations.
The proclamation was followed
# * * * 4 ? *
Their properties and the requisition ol
their revenues by thu executive warranl
such proceedings. As far as they affected
the persons or property of citizens of the
United States,they were in violation of tin
provisions of the treaty' of 1705, between
the United States and Spain. Representations
of the Injuries resulting to several iter
sons claiming to be citizens of tho United
States, by reason of such violations, were
made to the Spanltli government fron
April, 18(1!), In Juno last Tiio Spanish
Minister at Washington had been clothed
with a limited power to aid 1n redressing
such wrongs. That power was found ti
be withdrawn, in view, as it was said, ol
the lavorable situation in which tbo Islunil

not lead to a revocation or suspension ol
llio extraordinary and arbitmry functions
exercised by the executive [lower in Cuba
and wo were obliged to make our
complaint at Madrid. In the negotiation
thus opened and still pending there tin
United States only claimed that for tin
future tbe rights secured to their citizens
by treaty should be respected ir
Cuba, anil that as to the pasl
a joint tribunal should be established
in the United States, with full jurisilic
tion over all such claims and before sue!
impartial tribunal, each claimant woidd
liu require:! to prove bis case. On the
other lland, Spain would be at liberty U
traverse every material fact, and thns
complete equity would be done. A ease
which at one time threatened seriously tc
nirect the relations between the United
States and Spain, bas already been disnos
ed ot in this way. Tlio claim of tbe Col
Lloyd, of Aspinwall, for tbe illegal seizure
and detention of that vessel, was referred
to an arbitration by mutual consent, and
lias resulted in an award to the United
' States for tiie owners ot tbe same, of $10,
1 702.50 in gold. Another anil a long penu'
ing claim of like nature, that of tbe whulc
' ship Canada, bas been disjwsed of bj
friendly arbitration during tbe presoul
year. It was referred by tue joint con
| sent nf Brazil and the United States, ti
! the decision of Sir Edward Thornton, hei
! Brittanic Majesty's Minister at Washing1
ton, who kindly undertook the laborious
' task of examining the voluminous mas*
' of correspondence and testimony submit1
ted by the two Governments, and awarded
to the United States tho sum of one bun
dred thousand seven hundred and forty
1 dollars and nine cents in gold, which has
never been paid by the Imperial Govern1
ment.
These recent examples show thai
the mode which the United States have
proposed to Spain lor adjusting the pond.
ing claims is just and feasible, and that il
may be agreed to by either nation without
dishonor. It is to be hoped that this
moderate demand may be acceded to lij
Spain without further delay. Should tb<
' pending negotiations unfortunately and
unexpectedly be without result, it wil
i then become my duty to communicatc
i that met to Congress and invite its actior
1 on the subject The long deferred peace
i conference between Spaiu anil tho allied
- South American republics has been inaug
uratcd in Washington under the auspice!
r of tho United States. Pursuant to the rccI
commendations contained in the resolui
tion ot tbe IIoueo of Representatives ol
i the 17th of December, 18U0,the Kxccutlvi
i Department ol the Government ollered
. its friendly ofliccs for tbe promotion o!
I peace and harmony between Spain and
the allied republics, but obstacles occur
, red to tho acceptance of the offer. Ultl,
mutely, however, a conference was arrang
ed and was opened in this city
I on the 2!>tli of October last'
at which 1 authorized the Sccrc,
Wry ol Slate to preside. It was attendee
: by the Ministers of Spain, Peru, Chili and
ficuador, and in cousequence ol the ab
s sence ol tho representative from Bolivia
I the conference was adjourned until tho at
I tendance of the plenipotentiary from thai
ltopubllc could bo secured, ur otucr men'
surea could bo adopted towards com
> pawing its object. The allied and th<
I republics or Spanish origin on this conli
nent may sec in tbis Tact a new proor o
- our sincere interest in their welfare?oui
desire to see thciu blessed with a good
. government capablc ot maintaining order
I and preserving their respective terrltorla
i integrity, and of our sincere wish to ox
i tend our own commercial and social re
lations with them. The time is not pro
t bably far distant when, in the nature
. course of events, the European politics
, conncction with this continent will cease
Our policy should be shaped in view o
. this probability, so as to ally tho commer
' cial interests of the Spanish Amerlcar
States more closely to our own, and lliui
I give the United Suites all the prc-etni
' nenco and all the advantages which Mr,
. Monroe, Mr. Adams tint [Mr. Clay con
tcmplated when they proposed to join t<
- the "Congress of Panama. During tin
last session ot Congress a treaty for thi
, annexation of tho Republic of San Da
I niingo to tliatnl the United States failed tc
i recelvo the requisite two-thirds voto o
i the Senate. I was thoroughly convinced
I then that the best interests oi the country
, commercially and materially demanded iti
I ratification. Timo has only confirmee
, mo in this view. I now firmly bclievt
that tho morncul It is known that lh<
United States has entirely abandoned tin
i projectof tho recognition of the Island
f of San San Domingo as a free port, it wil
: be negotiated for by European nations
) In tho Bay .of Samanaa largo commer
cial city will spring up, to whlcli
f we will bo tributary without rccelv
ingcorrespondnlg benefits. Tho northern
r Senators who arc responsible for the loll)
r of our rejection so agreed. The govern
mcnt ol Sun Domingo has voluntarily
sought this annexation. It is a weak
r power, numbering probably leis than on(
i hundred and twenty thousand souls, and
i yet possessing ono of the richest localitlec
' under tho sun, capablo ol supporting e
' population ot ten millions of people, it
luxury. The people of San Domingo art
t not capablc of maintaining themselves It
their present condition, and must look lot
i outside support. They yearn lor tho pro
tectlon of our free institutions and laws
I our progress and civilization. Shall wi
r reluso them f Tho acquisition of Sai
i Domingo is desirable becauu of its gco
' graphichal position. It commands tin
> entrance to the Carribcan Sea, and th(
i Isthmus transit of commerce. It posseaa
I tho richest soil, tho best and most capa
' clous harbors, the most salubrioui
> climate and tbe most valuable pro
ducts ot the forest, mine and soil
of any of tliu West India Islands.
I Its possession liy the United States will,
i in u few years, build up a coastwise commerce
of immense magnitude, which will
fo lur towards restoring to the United
tatcs our merchant inariue. It will give
to us those articles which we consider
greatly necessary and do not produce,
- thus equalizing our ex|>orls and imports,
i In case o> a foreign war it will give us
command ol oil the Islands referred to,
I and thus prevent an enemy from again
T possessing himself of a rendezvous upon
i our coast. Our coast trade between the
States bordering on the Atlantic and
I those bordering on the Gulf of Mexico Is
by tho Bahamas and tho Antilles twice.
! We must, as it wcro, pass through foreign
; countries to get by from Georgia to tho
I east coast of Florida. San Domingo, with
i a stable government under which her im!
mense resources can bo developed, will
i givo remunerative wages to ten thousand
laborers not nuw upon the island.
This labor will take advantage
. ol every available moans ol transportation
i to abandon the adjacent islands and-seek
i the blessings of freedom and its sequence,
each inhabitant receiving tho rewards of
I his own labor. Porto Rico and Cuba will
have t<> abolish slavery, as a measure of
i self-preservation to retain their laborers.
I San Domingo will become a large consu[
merof the products ol northern lurras and
I manufactories. 1'ha cheap rate at which
I linn nltixuna nun Kn iill-limlinil With fo/lfl
I owing Id the cultivation of the
, island by machinery, will make it necessary
that the contiguous islands should
i have thu same advantages, In order to
! compete with them in the production of
> sugar, eofiee, tobacco, tropical fruits, &c.
i This will open to us a wider market for
i our products. The production of our own
t supply ol these articles will cut off mow
I than $100,000,000 of our annual imports,
besides increasing our cx|x>rts. With such
i a picture, it is oasy to sco how our large
debt abroad is ultimately to be
extinguished. With a balance of
> trade against us, including the
i Interest of bonds held by foreigners, and
s the money shipment of our citizens travi
cling in foreign lands equal to the yield of
I precious metals in ;his country, it is not
so easy to see how this result Is to be
, otherwise accomplished. The acquisition
of San Domingo is an adhesion to the
Monroe Doctrine It is a measure of
national protection, and it is asserting
I our just claims to h controlling iuflucnce
. over the great commercial traffic soon to
flow from the West to the East by way
of the Isthmus of Durten. It iB to build
up our merchant marine. It is to furnish
L new markets for the products ol out farms,
' shops and manufactories. It is to make
i slavery insupportable in Cuba und Porto
Rico at once, and ultimately bo in Brazil.
Ills to settle the unhappy condition of
> Cuba, and end an exterminating conflict,
i It is to provide the honest means of pay
ing our honest debts without overtaxing
I the people. It is to furnish bur citizens
with the ncccssaries of every day life at
cheaper rates than ever bctorc, and it is,
i finally, a rapid stride towards that greatness
which the intelligence, Industry and
enterprise ol the citizens of the United
Suites entitles this country to assume
'i auiong nations, lit view ol tho itnpor.
tance of this quustion, I oarnestly urge
upon Congress early action, expressive of
' its views as to the best means of acquirj
ing San Domingo. My suggestion is, that
. "by joint resolution of the two houses of
, Congress, the Executive bo authorized to
[ appoint a commission to negotiate for a
I treaty with the authorities of Sun Dominf;o,
for the acquisition of that
slunil, that an appropriation be made
i to defrav the expenses of such u coinmisI
slim. The question may be then deter.
mined by the action of tho two Houses of
, Congress upon a resolution of annexation
as in the coso of the acquisition ot Texas.
So convinced am I of the advantages to
' flow from the acquisition ot San Domingo,
, and of the great disadvantages, we might
I almost say, calamities, to flow from hon
acquisition, that I believe the subject
I has only to be investigated to bo approved.
It Is to be regretted that our representations
in regard to the injuries effected,es,
pcciully upou the revenues of the United
States, by tho policy of tho Mexican government
in exempting from import duties
a largo tract of its territory on our bor|
ders, have not only been fruitless'but that
1 it is even proposed in that country to cr.
tend the limits within which tho privilego

.' The expediency of taking into your
I serious consideration the proper
, niojins for counteracting the policy
. referred to, will, it is pro)
sumod, engage your earnest attention. It
. is to tho obvious interests, especially of
I neighboring nations, to provide ngainst
injury to those who may have committed
I high crimes within their borders, and who
may ltavo sought reflige abroad. For this
I purpose ex tradition trcaticshavc been coti.
chilled with several of tho Central Amcri.
can Repuhlios, and others are In progress.
The sense of Congress Is desired as-soon
I an may he (convenient upon the .procoal;
I Ings'ol the Commission on tho claims
against Venezuela, which arc commented
f on in the messages of March 4th, 1801),
. March 1st, 1870, and March 31st 1870.
, It has Dot been deemed advisable to clisi
tribute any of tho money which has been
. received from that government until Congress
shall have acted upon the subject.
. The massacres of tho French and ltus>
sians residents at Tein-Tain, under clr.
cumstancee of great barbarity,' were supj
posed by some to have been premeditated,
. ami to indicate a purpose among the pop,
ulaco to exterminate foreigners in tho
I Chineso Empire. Tho evidence fails to
I establish such a supposition, but shows a
complicity by tho local authorities with tho
! mob. The government at Pekin, howI
over, seems to have i been disposed to <ulj
HI its treaty obligations so far as it was
j able to do so. Onlortunately the newt .of
i tho war between the German States and
[ Franco reached China soon alter .the
[ massacre. It would appear that tho popular
mind became possessed with
. tho idoa that this contest, exteud,
ing to tho Chineso waters, would
. introduce the Christian Intlucnce and
, power, and that the time was coming
, when the superstitious mass might expel
. all foreigners and restore the mandarin
> influence. Anticipating trouble from thu
: cause, I invited France and North Ger,
many to make an authorized suspension
I of hostilities in tho East, wlicro thoy were
i temporarily suspended by tho act of the
, commanders, and to act together for the
, future protection in China of the lives
, and property of Americans and Europeans,
i Since the adjournment of Congress, the
ratification of tho treaty with Great
Britain lor tho abolishing of thu mixod
, courts for the suppression of the slave
i trade, Is now coiitlncd to the eastern coast
i of Africa, whence the slaves are taken to
- the Arabian markets. Tho ratification ol
i tho naturalization convention between
! Great Britain and tho'United States has
i also been exchanged daring tho recess,
- and thus a long standing disputo between
i tho two governments has been settled in
accordance with the principles alway
contended for by the Untied States.
In April last, while engaged in locatinj
? military reservation near Pembina, i
corps of engineers discovered that tin
commonly received boundary lino butwcci
the United States and' the British posses
slons at that placo is about flfty aovei
hundred feet south of the true position 0
tho zenith paralcll, and that the line
when run on what Is now supposed tobi
the true position of that paralcll, wouli
leave the Fort Hudson Bay Company a
Pembmi within the territory ol thi
United States.. This information beinj
communicated to tho British Gov
eminent 1 was requested to con
sent, and I did consent that tin
British occupation of the port by th
Hudson Bay company should coniinu
for the present. I ucem it important
however, that this part ot the boundary
line should be definitely fixed by a join
commission of tho governments, and sub
mit herewith estimates ol the ex
pense ot such a commission on the part (J
tho United States, and reconmieni
an appropriation for that purpose. Th
land boundary Is already fixed am
marked from tho Summit ol the Hock;
Mountains to tho Geoigian bay. It sliouli
be in llko manner marked from the Lak>
of the Woods to the Summit of the.Rockj
mountains. I regret to say that no con
elusion has been reached for the adjust
ment of tho claims against Great Britain
growing out of tho course adopted by tha
government during tho rebellion. Thi
abinet of London, so far as its vlcwi
have been expressed, docs not apoear t(
bo willing to concede that her llujosty'i
government was guilty of negligence, o
aid or |)ermltled any act during tho wa
by which the United States has just causi
ol complaint Ever firm and unalterabli
our convictions ure directly the reverse
and, therefore, we recommend to Congres
to authorize tho appointment of u coinmis
slon to take proof of the amounts nnd tin
ownership of their claims, on noticc ti
tiio representative of liis Majesty at Wash
Ington, and tbnt authority bo given for tin
seitleinent of these claims by the Unitet
Suites, ^o that tho government Bhaii havi
the ownership of tho private claims a
well as tho responsible control of all thi
demands against Great Britain. It canno
be necessary to add that whenever IIu
Majesty's government shnll entertain I
desire lor o full and friendly adjustmen
ofthese claims, the United States will en
ter npon their consideration with an earn
est desire lor a conclusion consistent witl
the honor and dignity of both nations
The courso pursued by the Canadian nu
thoritics toward tho fishermen of the Un
ited States during the past season has no
been marked by a friendly leeling. Bi
the first article of tho convention of 1818
between Great Britain and the Unitci
States, it was agreed that the inhabitant!
oi the United States should havi
forever, in common with British subjects
the right of taking fish In certain water
therein defined, in the water not includei
in the limits named in the convention
within three miles of the ports of thi
British coast. It has been the custom fui
many years to give to men trading am
fishermen of tho United States a reasona
bio wurning of their violations of the tech
nical rights of Great Britain. The im
perial government is understood to havi
delegated the whole or a share oi the juris
diction and control of thu inside fishcrj
grounds to tho colonial authority knowi
us the Dominion of Canada, and this send
independent but irresponsible agent ha
exercised its delegated powers lit an un
friendly way. Vessels have been seize'
without notice or warning in violation o
tho custom previously prevalent, and havi
been taken into the colonial |H>rls, thoi
voyages broken up, and the vessels con
demned. There is reason to believe tba
this unfriendly and vexatious trcatmen
was designed to bear harshly upou tin
hardy fishermen of the United States
with a view to political effect upon thi:
Government. The statutes of the Domin
ion of Canada assume a still broader ant
more untenable jurisdiction over the ves
sels of the United States. They authorial
officers and persons to bring vessels hov
ering within three inarino miles of any o
the coasts, bays, creeks or harbor
ol Canada, into port, to search the cargo
and to examino the master, on outli
touching the cargo and voyage, and ii
intlict upon him a heavy pecuniary pen
alty if true answers were not given; am
if such n vessol is found preparing to fisl
within ilirec marine miles of any sue!
coasts, liays, creeks or harbore, without i
license, or uftcr the expiration of the perloi
named in the last license granted to it the;
provide that the vessel, with Iter tackle
Jcc., shall be forfeited. It is not knowi

of Canada, although to enforce It It wil
become my duty to take sucU stepa a
may be necessary to protect tUo rights o
tlio citizens of the United btates. It liai
been claimed by Iler Majesty's officers
that tbe fishing vessels of tlio Unltei
States havo no right to enter the opt'i
ports of the British possessions in Nortl
. America, except for the purpose of shel
ter and repairing damages, of purchasln;
wood and obtaining water, that they havi
no right to enter at British Custom lions
cs, or to trade, except the purchase <1
wood and water; apu that they must de
part within 24 hours attar notice to leave
It is not known that any seizure of i
fishing vessel carrying the flag of tin
United States has been made uuder thii
claim So far as the claim is founded
on any allegedconstruction pf the conven
tion of 1818, cannot be acquiesced in by th
United States. It is hoped that it wil
not lie insisted on by Her Majesty's Gov
ornmcnt During the conference wliitl
preceded tlio negotiations of 1818, thi
British commission proposed to exprossl;
exclude, the fishermen of the United SUite
from Uio privilege of carrying on trad
with any of Her Majesty's subjects rcsid
ing within the limits assigned for thei
use; and also that it should not be lawfu
for the vessels of the United States cngag
ed in such fishery to have on board an;
goods, wares, or merchandise, wbatovei
except such as may bo necessary for th
prosecution of their voyuge I
and from said fishing grounds
and any vessel of the United States whic!
shall contravene this regulation may li
seized, condemned and confiscated, will
their cargocs. This proposition, whicl
is Identical with tlio construction now pu
. upon tlio language of the Conveulloi
was emphatically regretted by the Br!
tlsh plenipotentiaries, and article one, n
it stands in tlio Convention, was substi
1 tuted. If, liowevcr, it be said that thi
claim is founded on provincial nr colonic
statutes and not upon the Convcntioi
; tills Government cannot but regard tber
as unfriendly, and in contravention of th
i faitbftil execution of which the Imperlr
. Government is alone responsible. Ar
i tlcipallng that an attempt may jiossibl
bo made by the Canadian authorities 1
i the coming session, to repeal tiicso ur
i neighborly acts towards our fishermen,
recommend you toconfer upon the Excct
tlve tlio power to suspend by proclaim
i tion the operations ot tbe laws authoi

- that Great Britain may ground her refusal co

- deny, first, that ill so doing she exercises, mi
I harshly an extreme and hard law. Sec- an
i ondly, that lier conduct with rcspedt to tho be
i, navigation ol tho St. Lawrence is nn
, a glaring and discreditable inconsistency of
) with her condnct with respect to the sol
- navigation of the Mississippi river. On the co
i ground that she possessed a small do- no
l main in which tho Mississippi took its let
i rise, she insisted on this right to navl- zei
? gate the whole volume of its waters. On Isi
1 the ground that sho possessed both banks ac
f of tho St. Lawrence where it disembogues du
, into the sea, sho denies to the United in)
i States tho right or navigation through of
) about one half ol tho waters of Lakes mi

I the whole of Lake Michigan, through

i- is a frail structure, at an inconvenient dls- to

note situation, its Blunder construction,
d the absence ol a supply of water in

and of the many other
luable records and papers left with

recommend an appropriation for

ur reconsideration the propriety of
insferring to the Department of the In ior,
to which they seem more approlately
to belong, all powers and other

io average value of gold as compared
til Katlonul currency, for tho whole of
3 year 1800, was about 1.34, and
11 months of 1870 the
atlve valuo has been about 1.15. The
proach to specie basis is very gratifybut
the fact cannot be denied that tho
liability of tho valao of our currency is
cjudtcial to our prosperity and tends to
ep up prices to the detriment of trade,
le evils ol a depreciated and fluctuating
rrency are so great that, now when the

mid seem that tho time has arrived

no distant day.
The tax collected from the people has
on reduced mora than eighty million
liars per annum. By a steadiness in
r present course there is no reason why
a Tew short years, the national tax
therer may not disappear from the door
tho citizen almost entirely. With the
venue stamp dispensed by tho postisters
In every community, a tax upon
uors of ull sorts and tobacco in all its
-ms, and by a wiso adjustment of the
iff, which will put a duty only upon
ose articles which one could dispense
th, known as luxuries, and those which
i use more of than wo produce, revenue
ougli may be raised after a few
ara of peace and consequent reduction
our indebtedness to fulfill all our oblitions.
A further reduction ol expense
addition to a rcducllon.of the interest acunt
may be relied on to make this practible.
Revenue reform, if it means this,
a my hearty support; it It Implies a
lloction of ail the rovenue for tho suprt
of the Government, on the payment
the principal and interest of the public
bt. pensions, &c., by directly taxing the

d conlidentiy belicvo tho people are
th me. Ifit means a failure to provide
3 necessary means to defray all the oxnses
of the Government, and thereby a
ludiation of the public debt and penins,
then I am still more opposed to
cli kind of revenuo reform. Jicvenue
form has not been defined by any ot its
vocates, to my knowledge, but seems
be accepted as something which is to
pnly every man's wants without any
st or eflort on his pari A true revenue

The necessities of the country

Our army of assessors and col:lors
is not a pleasant sight to the citid,
but that or a tariff lor revenue
lcccssary. Such a tariff, so far as it
is in the encouragement to homo proofs,
affords employment to labor at liv;
wages, in contrast to the pauper labor
the old world, and also in the develop;nt
of home resources. Under the act of
ingress ot the 15th day of July, 1870.
The army has gradually been reduced,
that on the 1st of January, 1871, the
raber of commissioned officers and men
II not exceed the number contemplated

The War Department building is an old
ucture, not lire-proof, and entirely inequate
in dimensions to our present
ints. Many thousands of dollars are
w paid annually for the rent of private
ildings to accommodate the various
reaus of the Department. I recomind
an appropriation for a new War
Tartment building suited to the present
growing wants of the nation.
The report of the Secretary of War
owa a very satisfactory reduction in the
penaes or the army lor tbe last fiscal
ar. For details you are referred to his
companding report.
The expenses of the navy for the whole
the last year, that is, from December,
69, the date of the last report, are less
iu $19,000,000, or about $1,000,000
is than they vera the previous year,
le expenses of the Navy Department in
is fiscal year, since July 1st, show for
e five months a decrease of over $2,400,
0 from those of the corresponding
jntbs of last year. The estimates for
a current year ware $28,205,078 87;
ose for next year are $20,083,817, with
*57,000 additional for temporary and
rmanent improvements. These estiites
are made closely for the mainnance
of the naval establishment as it
without much in the uatnre of permagut
improvements. The appropriation!
ire made for the last and current years,
d were evidently intended by Congress,
d are sufficient only to keep the navy
its present footing, and the repairing
d refitting of our old ships. This
licy must, of course, gradually but
rely destroy the navy, and it is in itself
r from economical, as each year that it
pursued the necessity for more repairs
ships and navy yards, Ac., becomes
are imperative aad mora costly, and
r current expenses are actually ineased
for the mere repair of ships,
my of which most soon be unsoaworthy
d umImj. I hope during the present
uiou of Congress to be ablo to submit
it a plmi by which naval vessels can be
lilt and repairs inadu with great saving
ion the present cost. It cau hardly be
se statesmanship in a government
jich represents a country with over four
thousand milenof ooast line on both oceans
exclusive of Alaska, and containing forty
millions of progressive people, with rein*
itons of every nature with almost every foreign
country, to rest with such inadequate
means of enforcing any foreign policy of
protection or redress. Separated by the
ocean from the nation* of the British
continent, our navy is our only mcuns of
direct protection to our citizens abroad,
or for the enforcement of any foreign
policy. '
The accompanying report of tlio l'ostmaster
General shows a most satisfactory
working of that Department. With the
adoption of the recommendations contained
therein, particularly those relating
to a reform in the franking privilege and
the adoption of corespondence cards, a
self-sustaining postal system may speedily
be looked for, and at no distant day a
further reduction of the rate of postage be
attained. I recommend the authorisation
by Congress to the Postmaster General
and Attorney General to issue all commissions
to officials appointed through
their respective Departments. At present
these commissions, where appointments
are made, are issued by tho Stale Department.
The law in all the departments of
tho government, exceptthosc of the Postoffice
and Justice, authorir.es each to
issue its own commissions, always favoring
practical reforms.
I respectfully call your attention to one
abuse of long standing, which 1 would
like to see remedied by this Congress.
It is a reform in the civil service of the
country. I would have it go beyond the
mere fixing of the term of office of clerks
and employes who do not require the ad- /
vice and consent of the Senate to make
their appointments complete. I would
have it govern, not tne lenure, but <
the manner of making all appointments.
There is no duty which so much
embarrasses the Executive and heads of
departments as that of appointments;
nor is there any such arduous and thankless
labor imposed on Senators and Representatives
as that of Gnding places for
constituents. The present system does
not secure the best men, and often not
even fit men for public place. The elevation
and purification of tho civil scrvice
of the Government will be hailed with

Keform in the management of Indian
affairs has received tho special attention
of the administration from its inauguration
to the present day. The experiment
of mailing it a missionary work was tried
with a few agencies given to the denominations
ol Friends, and has been found to
work most advantageously- All agencies
and superintendences not so disposed of
were given to officers of the army. The
act of Congress reducing ihe army renders
army officers ineligible for civil
positions. Indian agencies being civil
offices, I determined to give all the
agencies to such religious denominations
as had heretofore established misssions
among the Indians, and perhaps to some
other denominations wito would undertake
the work on the same terms, i. e., as
a missionary work.
The societies selcctcil are allowed to name
their agents, subject to the approval of the
Executive, and are cxpectal to watch
over and aid them as missionaries and
christians, anil civilize the Indian and
train him in the arts of peace. The Government
watches over tho official ucts ol
these agents and requires of them as
strict an accountability as If tlicy were
appointed in any other manner, I entertain
tho confident hope that the policy
now pursued will in a lew years bring all
tho Indians upon reservations, where they
will live in houses, linvo school houses
and churches and will be pursuing |>caccfiil
and self-sustaining vocations, and
where they may lie visited by the lawabiding
white man with the same immunity
that he now visits the civilized white
settlements. I call your special attention
to tho report of the Commissioner of Indian
Aflalrs for flill information on this
subjcct
During tho last fiscal year 8,095,418
acres of public land were uisixiscd of. Of
this quantity 3,008,010 acres were
taken under the homestead law, and
2,150,505 acres sold for cash. Tho remainder
was locatod with military warrants,
college or Indian scrip, or applied
in satisfaction of grants to railways, or
other public uses. The entries under the
homestead law during tho post vcar covered
001,545 acres more than those during
tho preceding year. Surveys have been
vigorously prosecuted to the lull extent of
the means applicable to tho purpose. The
quantity ol land In the market will amply
supply the present demand. The claim ol
the settler under the homestead or precmp?lnn

surveyed public land may, to a
mited amount, bO acquired tinder the
fortoer laws iftiifl party entitled to enter
under them will comply wit .lithe requirements
they present Id regard to the residence
and cultivation. Tho actual settler's
preference right of purchase is even
broader, and extends to lands which were
unsurvoved at the tlmo of his settlement.
His right was lormerly confined within
much narrower limits, and at one period
ol our history was conferred only by spoclal
statutes. They were enacted from
time to tlmo to logalizo what was then regarded
as an unauthorized intrusion
upon tho national domain. The opinion
that the public lands should be regarded
chiefly as a source ol revenue is no longer
maintained. Tho rapid settlement and
successful cultivation of them. Is now justly
considered ofmoroimportancoto our well
being than the fund which tho sale of them
would produce. The remarkable growth
and prosperity of our new States and territories
attest tho wisdom of the legislation
which invites the tiller of the soil to
sccuro a permanent home on terms within
tho reach of all the pioneers who will incur
the dangers and privations of a frontier
Hie, ana thus aid In laying the foundation
of new commonwealths, render a signal

to Its special favor and protection.
Thoselawssecurothatobject and
largely promote, tho general welfare.
They should, therefore, be cherished as a
Sjrmanent feature of our land system.
oOd faith requires us to give IU11 effect to
the existing glints. The time honored
and boncllcent policy of setting apart
certain sections of public lands for educational
purposes in tho now States should
be continued. When ample provision shall
havo been made for these objects, I ;sub- 1
mlt as a question worthy of serious consideration,
whether the residue of our '
national domain should not bo wholly dis- 1

and preemption laws. In addition

acres lor railways, canals and
wagon rornls. It is estimated that an additional
quantity of 174,735.533 acrcsis still
due under the grants Tor like uses. The
policy of thus aiding the States in building
works of internal improvement was
inaugurated more than forty.years since
in the grants to Indiana and Illinois. Those
States are opening canals to connect the
waters or the Wabash with those of Lako
Erie, nnd the waters of tliu Illinois with
those of Luke Michigan. It was followed
with sonic modification in the grant of
Illinois of alternate sections of public
lands within certain limits of tho Illinois
Ccutral Hallway. Fourteen States and
sundry corporations have received similar
subsidies In connection with railways
completed, or In process of
construction. As the reserved
sections are rated at the double minimum,
the ?alo of them at the enhanced
price lias thus in many Instances indemnified
the Treasury for the granted lands.
The coLStruction of some of theso thoroughfares
has undoubtedly given a vigorous
impetus to the development of our
resources and tho settlement of the more
distant portions of the country. It may,
however, be true, as insisted, that much
of pur legislation in this regard has been
characterized by indiscriminate and profuse
liberality. Tho United States should
not loan their credit in aid ol any enterprise
undertaken by States or corporations
unless the projected works are of acknowledged
national importance. I am strongly
inclined to the opinion that It Is inexpedient
and unnecessary to bestow subsl
dies or cither description, nut snouin
Congress determine otherwise, I earnestly
recommend that the rights of settlers
and of the public bo more effectually secured
by appropriate legislation.
Daring the year ending September 20,,
1870, there were filed in the Patent office
10,411 applications for paten: s, 8,374
caveats, and 100 applications for the extension
of patonts. 18,623 patents, including
reissues and designs, were issued,
110 extended, and 1,080 allowed but nut
Issued by reason ot the non-payment of
tho final fees. The receipts ot the office
during the fiscal yoar were $180,304.25 in
excess of its expenditures.
Tho work ol the Census Bureau has
been energetically prosecuted. Tho preliminary
report, containing much Information
of special value and interest will be
ready for delivery tho present session.
The remaining volumes will be completed
with all the dispatch consistent with perfect
accuracy in arranging and classifying
the returns. We shall thus, at no distant
day, bo furnished with mi authentic record
of our condition and resources, and
it will, I doubt not, attest tho crowing
prosperity or tho. country, although
during the dread contest which has Just
closed it was so severely tried by the great
war waged to maintain its integrity and
to secure and perpetuate our free institutions.
During the last fiscal year the sum
paid to pensioners,including tho cost of disbursements,
wus $27,780,811 11, and 1,758
bounty land warrants were issued.
At its close 193,080 names were on the
pension rolls. The labors of the Pension
Office have been directed to avoid
fraud. . There has been severe
scrutiny of the evidence submitted
in fa\ or of now claims, and to tho discovery
of fictitious claims which have boen
heretofore allowod. Tho appropriation
lor the employment of special agents for
the investigation of frauds has been jndl- .
ciously used and the results obtainod have
been of unquestionable benefit to the service.
Thesubjectol education and.agriculturo
are of great interest to the success of
our republican Institutions, happiness and
granduurasa nation. In tho interest of
one, a bureau has been established In the
Interior Departincut, the liureuu o
Education, and in the Interests of the
other, a separate department, that of Agriculture.
I belicvo groat general good is
to follow from the operations of both
these burcnus if properly fosterud. I cannot
commend to your careful consideration
too highly tho leports of the Commissioners
of Education and of Agriculture,
nor urge too strongly such liberal
legislation as will secure their efficiency. In
conclusion, I would sum up tlic policy ol
the administration to be a thorough enforcement
of every law; a faithful collecof

disbursements of the same; a prompt
payment of every debt of the nation; a reduction
of taxes as rapidly as the requirements
