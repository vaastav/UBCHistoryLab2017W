A Tittle pool deserted by the tide.
With seaweed fringes motionless, un
stirred. And all its life quiescent, doth abide,
Though distant plash of restless wave is
heard.
What seeth It but rocks, unchanging,
grim.
That forward lean with frown and men
ace drear?
A little pool shut In from rim to rim,
. Though life abundant sweeps so fast
and near.
Tet mirrored in Its heart are sky and
stars.
And faint reflection of the rising moon.
That brings new life to overflow its bars;
The full flood-tide shall break upon it
soon.
Therefore, my soul, with inmost peace
endure
Enforced Inaction in a time of stress;
Here or hereafter is the moment sure.
Thy life's flood-tide shall break on thee
to bless.

The boys had sent for Ashbee to help
them. "She's the sort of thing a fel
low never forgets," Dalbiac had
written. "Sweeps everything before
her without any body being able to
impress her. We fellows are not at
swords' points; I'd God-speed any
lucky chap who got a run on her.
You're a pretty clever one and say
your heart's of marble so you'd bet
ter come over and vindicate us."
After that Ashbee had rather looked
for something superb, and during his
first few moments beside Miss Ro
zelle's hammock was perhaps at some
loss to understand the potency of al
lurements which radiated from so
nondescript a face and figure and cer
tain boyish attitudes that flavored
of a boarding-house hoyden out for
fun. The apple of a score of glowing
masculine eyes and the sole inspiration
of half as many appealingly diligent
tongues, the little lady in the middle
of the evening suddenly leaped out of
her hammock to scamper across to a.
cluster of wall-flowers. A number of
men trailed after her. Ashbee, whose
conversation with her had sparkled,
turned fretfully to Dalbiac with:
"It's her blasted indifference that
drives you donkeys mad. Why don't
you get up a rival game? I see there
are lots here that are worth while."
"That's where you're off it, Goosie,"
Dalbiac answered. "We'll all back
you in anything you try but the chest
nutty jealousy trick is no go. Yon
should see her egging us on! But 1
thought you probably would be get
ting busy with the lady by this time
so made other plans for the evening.
Come along!"
"Thank you, I'll stay here," Ashbee
rejoined thoughtfully, remaining in
the very chair he had first chosen for
an inspection of the lioness, and soon
growing dreamily apathetic to his en
virons. -
Late in the evening when the deso
lation of the verandah had been per
fected and the empty chairs were
ghosts of the earlier mirth, Rozeile
came fluttering back after a book she
had left in the hammock. She glanc
ed at Ashbee but he kept his eyes
fixed upon a widow with her small
boy tracing a lugubrious stroll over
the lawn. Rozeile tossed herself into
the hammock and lay there, keeping
infinitely silent. Well, Ashbee had
been somewhat piqued and if Rozeile
would not speak neither would he. It
seemed a full half hour when she at
last observed:
"I don't believe you care especially
for women's society, do you?"
"That would be a rather rude ad
mission to make to you, Miss Rozeile."
"Oh, no, you mustn't mind me," the
I don't believe you care."
girl laughed. "I think that's fine and
wish I could talk with you. You wont
care Just for one evening will you?
When it's almost over at that!"
This irresistible ingenuousness melt
ed away every barrier to a long and
delectable tete-a-tete. As the two part
ed Ashbee suggested that they go for
a walk on the morrow, and when she
cried "Jolly!" he smiled a thousand
times while reflecting upon the in-
stantaneousness of his success. "A
little coolneat that's all she needed!

not portray the paralysis that seized
the. knot of young fellows and all the
cloud of witnesses at the hotel as one
after another, by little and little they
perceived the miracles that" were be
ing wrought by Ashbee's hands.
It was that gentleman's second
night at the hotel and the moon swam
from out a cloud at half after eleven
to illumine his large frame and to glis
ten on the auburn tints of Miss Ro
zelle's dark tresses as the two mean
dered in and out among the shrubbery
on the lawn. The third night, and
when the circles along the verandah
had been broken up for the night cer
tain discerning eyes spied a rowboat

floating down with the tide, they two
alone within. At the hop a day or
two later Ashbee had Miss Rozelle's
best dances and at Intervals between
bore off with her to lover's crevices
among the palmy decorations. One
morning she tripped over to the sta
tion with him. There was a certain
coquettish unobtrusiveness about their
movements which was past finding out
and made them the more seriouB.
To be sure the men did not stand
by Ashbee as Dalbiac had guaranteed
nor did the aforesaid gentleman wish
him God-speed in his run. "It's all
very well," he remarked gloomily,
"but Ashbee's heart isn't marbly any
more." -
"Comfort yourself with the reflec
tion that the substance that affects
marble is acid," Van Ness laughed in
rejoinder. He alone of all the men had
been impervious to the effects of Ash
bee's glories. The affair had rather
entertained him and that despite the
fact that before the conqueror's arrival
Rozeile had vouchsafed him some few
favors in the way of promenades. Still
he had never made further headway
and seemed contented with whatever
gifts the petite goddess provided him,
always good-naturedly laughing over
the fuming of others, assuring them
that the game was not worth their
agonies.
At about the end of Ashbee's second
week, however, it appeared for tho
moment that the young woman had
returned to the old love. She rose
with her customary abruptness from
the circle of trousers, remarking that
perhaps Van Ness would fancy an air
ing. He sprang up hurriedly to take
advantage of this wonderful sugges
tion with every mark of delight But
they were not away long. Soon Ash
bee, with a suspicion of vainglorlous-
ness, asserted an unimpaired power
over the belle by drawing her away
for a walk of his own, thns summarily
repudiating and avenging his slights.
In the secret places of his heart,
however, there was the most penetrat
ing humility. Its marbleness was
mwe'y a shrine for very penitential
prtyrra. Ashbee had flirted and gay
ly feceived ever since he had first
donned the insignia of his sex's dress
or even before, but he still bewailed
every gentle heart he had afflicted. He
felt now that it would not do to have
this one more girl imagine he was
serious when well, when everything
was a joke Rozeile must be warned,
even if it was going to be very hard
and very awkward. So when they
came out among the walnuts where he
had always waxed most sentimental he
began softly and slowly with:
"Miss Rozeile, I wonder whether
you can understand a really frivolous
man, a regular chump, jou know that
goes and does all sorts of things he
ought not to, plays with fire when he
knows it's going to hurt somebody at
a very vulnerable place and all for
his own amusement?"
Rozeile said nothing.
"Rozeile, girl, you hurt me when yon
are so quiet, and I've got to tell you.
I'm just that kind of a villain. There,
it's mighty tough to Bay it. But don't
you know I've acted the simple since
I've met you. I don't "
His Interlocutor continued ominous
ly suppressed. He blundered the
more. "But there ' are lots of nice
fellows who would roll over In the
mud if they thought it would please
you. I've been thinking, and hoping
that perhaps you cared for Van Ness
a trifle! Now, he's a fine fellow, that
boy. He's worth your while. I'm not;
I'm"
Then the lady spoke.
"Stop it. Mr. Ashbee. Never mind.
It's all right. I'm a villain, too. Mr.
Van Ness has told me all about it
from the beginning. You see I have
known that he's worth while. I I'm
married to him. We're on our honey
moon; we thought we'd do something
out of the ordinary, you know, and it's
been lots of fun. But between you
and me, we're going back to the com
mon rut of cooing bridal couples to
morrow morning, way np In the moun
tains all by ourselves. So good-bye,
Mr. Ashbee, and don't feel too sur
prised and don't try it on other girls."

"There's one thing, Eugenie," he
said, "that discourages me. I try to
keep it from doing so, but I find it
impossible. Ever since I can remem
ber anything I have been imbued with
a feeling that I was intended by Na
ture to be greater than the common
run of men. There has always been
a voice whispering to me t strive on,
that I had a lofty mission, that I was
created for a noble purpone." "It is
strange," she replied, "how old, child
ish notions sometimes cl'ng to us."
Eugenie," he cried, half-iitcllned to be
angry, "are you joking with me?"
'No; I assure you I wouldn't try to
do that. But what were trou going to

much harm. I have been reading
about a number of gvat men lately,
and they all seem to "have had their
failings. Wagner, Carlyle, Byron,
Shelley, Poe it was the same with all
of them. But for the one streak of
genius that made each of them great
they would all have been in jails or
madhouses." "Yes," she assented.
"But what has all this to do with your
case?" "I have been trying to study
myself," he answered; "I have been
endeavoring to find out what kind
of eccentricities I have to prove that
I am a genius, and I can't discover any
at all." "Oh," she returned, permitting
her dimples to assert themselves,
"don't let that discourage you. Go
on and try to develop the streak of
genius. If you could hear some of
the things people say behind your
back you would never let the fear of
a lack of crazy streaks in your make

some reason he kept on doubting, and
hated the girl from that moment.

An American Wit.
The story here related is so typical
of our distlngllshed representative at
the court of St. James that one would
have no hesitancy In vouching for its
genuineness. A semi-state reception
was given at the residence of a certain
lord in London; our inimitable
Choate in his "court dress" of plain
broadcloth was extremely inconspicu
ous in comparison with the gold-laced
and insignia-decorated representatives
of ether countries. When the night was
waning one of the departing guests,
whose indulgence probably made him
forget that English lackeys on such
occasions wore the livery of their
office, approached Mr. Choate and re
quested him to call him a cab. The
response was a blank stare. Upon his
repeating the request, "Won't you
call me a cab, please?" Mr. Choate re
sponded, "Certainly. You're a cab."
Imagine the indignation of the insult
ed Englishman, who, upon making
complaint to the host, was asked as a
favor to point out the offender. After
a search through the crowded saloons
the Englishman was quite at the el
bow of Mr. Choate when he exclaimed:
"That's the man!" The whispered
reply: "Why, that's the United States
ambassador." Philadelphia Tele
graph. Tbe Care of Fish.
Fish should be allowed a gallon of
water each, that is, for every fish of
medium size, say three inches long.
The bottom of the aquarium should
be covered one-half inch deep with
sand; there should be water-plant
enough to furnish the fish with oxy
gen and absorb the carbonic acid, and
also a few tad-poles and snails to act
as scavengers. These conditions are
for a self-sustaining aquarium, where
no change of water is necessary. If,
on the contrary, the fish are kept in
a globe, say of half-gallon to two-gallons
capacity, with four or five full
grown fish, at least half of the water
must be changed daily. If the fish
are but half an inch or two inches
long, and each one has a half-gallon
of water, water need be added only
to replace the loss by evaporation.
Whenever the fish come to the sur
face. It indicates that the water or
part of it at least, should be fresh
ened. They should be fed each day
only as much as they eat up clean.

While Professor Virchow has been
an indefatigable worker in science and

surrendered, years ago, convinced that
it was useless to struggle against his
fate any longer. This thing was the
pronunciation of his name. The Eng

with him through the burning villages
of Manchuria with the conquering

of the battle of Port Arthur with won

Count Tolstoy and his family, among
his peasant neighbors; then dashes

History of New York.
New York was named in honor of
James, Duke of York, in 1654, at
which time it was captured from the
Dutch by the English. It then con
tained a population of about 3,000. The
first settlement on Manhattan island
was made by the Dutch in 1615, and
the first publie wharf was built as late
as 1658. Less than 3G0 years have
passed since the first occupancy of the
spot on which now stands New York,
and in less than two and a half cen
turies her population has increased
from S.000 to 3.500.000.
Drinking- Barber's Crashing Answer.
When it was too lata the barber's
customer discovered that the operator
he had selected to manipulate the
razor had been indulging in strong
drink. But he sank bsck in his chair,
trusting to luck for a successful shave.
The inevitable happened, however,
when the nerve-racked barber jabbed
a piece of - cuticle from the victim's
chin "Now, you see, sir, what hard
drinking will do," walled the damag
ed person "Yes, it does make the skin
tender," said the man of shears and

All Agree That Indian Territory
Should Have It.
"TREATED LIKE A WHITE MAN."
Washington, Dec 7. Members of the
Indian committee of the house and
senate expect the Fifty-seventh con
gress to enact legislation of far reach
ing importance to Indian Territory.
Senators and representatives agree
that some kind of territorial govern
ment should be provided for the 300,000
people of the territory who are now
under a government by the federal
courts. The leaders are greatly en
couraged by the strong words of the
president in his message that "the time
has arrived when we should definitely
make up our minds to recognize the
Indian an an individual and not as a
member of a tribe," and that "the In
dian should be treated as an individual
like the white man."
The secretary of the interior, in lin'
with the policy of the president, is ol
the opinion that congress should pass
a bill establishing a territorial form ol
government for Indian Territory along
the same general plan as that upon
which the government of Oklahoma,
New Mexico and Arizona is based. Ha
will bring this subject to the attention
of members of the Indian committee.
Representative Curtis of Kansas, said
that every member of congress who
had investigated the situation has been
convinced that some kind of legislation
to supplement the laws now in force
was demanded. He predicted that
when congress took the subject up it
would be found that the most practical
way to deal with conditions there
would be by the passage of a bill
creating a complete territorial form of
government with delegate representa
tion in congress.
Gen. Chaffee In Earnest.
Manila, Dec 9. Gen. Chaffee has
issued orders for the closing of all ports
in the Laguna and Batanags provinces.
The quartermasters there will cease
paying rents to the Filipinos for build
ings used for military purposes as it is
known that a large portion of the
money finds its way to the insurgents
in the shape of contributions and Gen.
Chaffee intends that no more govern
ment funds shall find their way into
the hands of the enemy. The reason
for closing the ports is that too many
supplies are found to be getting into
the possession of the insurgents.
Mrs. Booth Stricken.
Colorado Springs, Col., Dec 4. Mrs.
Maude Rallington Booth, of the Vol
unteers of America, was stricken while
delivering an address before the stu
dents of Colorado college, and was
taken to the home of State Senator
Sledomridge. The trouble is a compli
cation of the heart caused by the ex
cessive altitude. Her condition has im
proved somewhat.

Ottawa, Ont., Dec. 9.. Miss Bessie
Blair, daughter of A. G. Blair, Minis
ter of Railways and Canals, and H. A.

party, and, becoming separated a little
listance from the others, broke through
the ice at a point where the river was
liwift.

tains. The thermometers registered 16
aelow zero at Oneonta, 18 below at

ford, 24 below at Bloomville and 33

Comment of English Weeklies.
London, Dec 9. The comment of
the weeklies on President Roosevelt's
message to congress is not generally so
friendly as that of the dailies. The
Speaker devotes the entire space to
acrid comment on the trust references
declaring the president's treatment of
a grave economic situation as trivial in
form and unsatisfactory in substance,
adding: "Did we not believe in the
goodness of the president's intentions,
we should regard his diagnosis of the
industrial situation as insincere."
Younger Men In Command.
Washington, Dec 7. Secretary Root
has prepared a bill providing for the
voluntary retirement of the veteran
officers of the army who have seen ser
vice in the three wars the rebellion,
the Indian wars and the Spanish war
with an additional grade. Only about
201 officers will be affected by this ar
rangement, which the president him
self will urge in the strongest terms as
a measure of justice to the veterans and
would improve the military service by
placing younger men in command.
Crazy Snake In Washington,
Washington, Dec 7. Crazy Snake,
the Creek Indian, of the Creek Indian
nation in the Indian territory and
others of his faction reached here and
called at . the White House and the
interior department. They failed to
see the president. Commissioner of
Indian Affairs Jones advised them to
return home. Crazy Snake and his fol
lowers made serious trouble at the
agency some months ago. They are
here in an effort to secure the contin
uance of the old tribal relations.
Flynn's Statehood BUI.
Washington, Dec 5. Delegate Flynn
of Oklahoma says that he is more
than confident that the house of repre
sentatives would pass the bill admitting
Oklahoma as a state. Mr. Flynn haa
introduced the statehood bill. The bill
has the support of Mr. Knox, of Massa
chusetts, the chairman of the commit
tee on territories. Mr. Flynn is gratified
with the expressed sentiments of other
members of tbe committee. Bills for
admitting New Mexico and Arizona
were also introduced.
More Soldier Wanted.
London, Dec 3. A correspondent in
Pretoria, whose recent dispatehea gin
ing the numbers of the Boer commam
does are supposed to have been allowed
to pass through the censorship as a
warning that more British troops wert
wanted in South' Africa, states ex
plicitly that more men are needed to
accelerate to attrition of the Boers, and
that a further partitioning of the count
try by lines of blockhouses is necessary
to enable the British . columns tc
uciiieve greater success.
