said he believed the salaries 'of minor
clerks of the government should be in
creased on account of the Increased
cost of living. He said he would not

modern society. Mr. Fitzgerald of

(By Lee Redwine.)
Dear Sir: I wish you would put this lett-r in your paper. When I eamo to Los Angeles I saw in the
paper where I was accused of that robbery at the sheriff's office. It is a lie, and furthermore every man
in the aheriff's office knows that I did not know that tha money was there until it wae gone.
The evening it disappeared I was at the asylum with Charley Slankard. We toole a crazy Mexican
out there. I talked to J. M. Burnett about this and he knows that it i not so on me.
The reason I went away from Phoenix wa that I did not want to serve that thirty days in jail. There
was no intent of stealing that $10, and Judge Johnstone knows it and I thank him very much.
If they will declare that thirty days off against me I will go back there aid face everything they can
bring up against me; and furthermore, the man that mentioned my name in this matter is a liar and the
truth is not i- him. I am coming back soon to prove just what I say. I do not think that I ever did anyone
any wrong or any harm; but I think that they tried to do ma wrong.
There is another officer there who had better go, for I know too much atu him, and I am going to
tell about what took place about a vear ago in front of the Owl saloon.
Well, Mr. Spear, look after this and I will be thankful to you. I might not have every word spelled
right, but excuse bad spelling. I remain your friend, LEE REDWINE.
P. S. I am going away from hsr in a short time. So wherever I go I will write and tell you where
to write to. Be sura and have the taxpayers pray for Judge Johnstone, Cod bless him. So goed-bye.
- LEE REDWINE.

.Rome. Dee. 14. Cardinal Ferrari,
Archbishop of Milan, in an Interview
today, on the situation in France, said:
"I believe that the French clergy and
people are right In defending- that lib
erty of conscience which their govern
ment threatens to suppress with a lib
erty killing law ur.predecented in any
country. When Archbishop Ireland
was here a short time ago he described
the magnificent Independence of Amer
ican Catholics. The French clergy and
eople will defend their treasure, in
other words, their faith, but with a
passive defense, the only kind fit for
the church.
Politics do not enter into this matter
The Pope Is a nian of enlightened
kindliness and his disposition was
most conciliatory, but It was impossible
for him to cede, as he defended not
only his own rights but those of the
church. Catholic France agrees abso
lutely with the Pontiff. The storm will
pass and the faith will come out of the
persecution, pure, noble and stronger
than ever."
The Vatican officials declared this
evening that they had received many
manifestations of sympathy from
prominent Protestants. Their names
however, are not given as the authori
ties are not authorized to do so.
