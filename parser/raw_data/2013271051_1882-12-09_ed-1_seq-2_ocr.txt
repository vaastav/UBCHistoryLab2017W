President Arthur's message to
Congress, at its session which
commenced Monday, is a volumin
ous doenment. However interest
ing and valuable it may he as a
publie doenment, it is entirely too
stale and dnll to excite any vivid
interest in the current reader. The
whole «cries of topicB, which neu
ally fill a president's message, and
which may affect the internal and
external relations of the Govern
ment are rnn over and discussed
by the President, The style of the
message, though chaste and cor
rect in form, is rather recitative
than imperative, in its tone. Its re
commendations, even, are bronght
out in an huirible and hesitating
manner, as though its author
donhted the propriety of making
more than a mere timid suggestion
to Congress. The message may
he a very able one in respect to
its scope of information ; it is cer
tainly nota manly one ; it eminently
lacks both vigor and authority.
The thought forcibly thrusts itself
npou ns that when the President
was composing it, he was intently
ruminating upon the recent crush
ing defeat of his party and the
probable disaster which awaits it
in the uear future, and that the
depressing influence of these sore
reflections made themselves very
sensibly felt throughout his mes
sage.
The New Orleans Election Frauds.
[N. O. City Item, Dec. 1.1
The grand jury met yesterday

thirteen parties implicated in the

against the accused is "Forging
public records and publishing as
true," based on section 833 of the
Revised Statutes, which reads as
follows :

When To Elect Congressmen.
[Times-Democrat.]
Attention is being called to the
fact that our election of Congress
men is to use a cant word, decid
edly "too previous." The Forty
eighth Congress meets in Decem
ber '83, and yet its members nre
elected in November, '82, 13
months ahead of time; while the
Oregon member is selected as
early as July, '82, just37 months be
fore he ie needed. Two serious
disadvantages follow from this.
By the time that Congress meets,
a dozen or more vacancies have
naturally ocournd from death in
the new roll. Two deaths have
already been chronicled of mem
bers of the Forty-eighth Congress
—Col. Herron, of this State, and
Dr. TTpdegrafF, of Ohio; and by
December, '82, at the average rate
of mortality, we may expect a
dozen or so more deaths of Con
gressmen long before their term
begins.
The other disadvantage iB that
Congress, instead of being fresh
from the people—as it should he—
to legislate on current questions
of the day, comes a year or more
afterward, when probably the
issues on which it was elected
have long since been laid at rest.
Thus the internal revenue was an
important issue in many districts
in November; hat when the mem
bers who are elected on it meet
at Washington next December, the
probability is that they will find
this same internal revenue ques
tion long since finally settled.
The tact is, that the present
system of electing Congressmen
from a year to a year and a half
ahead of the time when they are
to serve, ie a relict of an old bar
barism. In the old dove of the
republic it took several months j
for a member from the Imekwooils
to reach Washington. The Gali- j
forma representatives had some-1

"Col. Jonas, of Louisiana, was seen

correspondent and interrogated
relative to Benator Kellogg's case.
'His name will be placed on the
roll by the Olerk of the Honse,' lie
said, 'for no other certificate has
been issued to any one else by the
