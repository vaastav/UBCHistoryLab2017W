The galleries of the House were
crowded at au early hour. The absence
of flowers from the desks of the mem

when his personal request that he be
permitted to absent himself for an in
definite period on account of business
was laid before the House 03' the

THIS IS NO MUSHROOM GROWTH
That tho growth of Salt Lake is and will be of the substantial kind is thoroughly assured. There is no
booming, in the common understanding of that word, in the expenditure of millions .of dollars by the railroad com
panies in the installation of permanent improvements in their terminal facilities and in the construction of splen
did passenger stations. Another thing: No railway company will spond millions of dollars on a mushroom town.
Officials of those corporations make large investment only in localities which they know are of sufficient stability
and progrcs-siveness to assure proper returns.
Tho fact that real estate dealers horo aro every day obligod to turn away applicants for businoss quarters be
tokens growth along solid business lines. While several large structures arc to bo orcctod as soon as material can
be brought hero, thcro Is ovory reason to believe that the town's growth will be so rapid and substantial that its
business needs will not be entirely satisfied for some years to come.
Every year this State produces, millions upon millions in all sorts of farm truck; enormous sums come from tho
gold, silver, coppor, load and coal mines; and the beet sugar industry is assuming immense proportions. In them
selves these arc great permanent supports to a thriving community. But there are the mighty iron ore beds of
Utah which so far have not boon touched. The valuo of these runs into so many billions of dollars that any at
tempt at computation would bo usoloss. Sonio day thcro will be great iron furnaces and forges put into Iron county
and another woalth-making industry will be added to tho support of this commonwealth, Thon thorc aro the Humor
ous beds of asphaltum and gilsonito, which have only just boon scratched up to the present time. Thcro. aro proba
bly ton thousand squaro miles of territory in oastorn Utah in which these products abound in groat quantity. Tho
millions which will come from these sources will help this town wonderfully. The fact that', the State is full of
natural resources establishes tho permanency of this city's future it is to be the Solid American Salt Lake.

Discrimination iu Coke
and Coal Rates.
PUEBLO. Colo., Dec. 3. Interstate
Commerce Commissioner E. E. Clark,
assisted by Attorneys Thomas and
Marchand, I his morning began an in
vestigation of "alleged land frauds and
the relations between common carriers
to the production of coal and oil and
the transportation of same'."
This was the way tho Commissioner
explainer! his visit to Puoblo. It is un
derstood that a largo number of wit
nesses will be examined today in con
nection with the coal land holdings of
the Colorado Fuel and Iron company,
the Denver & Rio Grande, the Colorado
& Southern, and the Santa Fe railroads,
for the purpose of securing data' which
will be submitted to Congress for defi
nite action. Should the investigation
bring out facts to warrant it. however,
the matter will be brought to the at
tention of a special United States
grand jury, called for the purpose of
indicting those against whom charges
may be preferred.
Hie hearing in this citj- was held
owing to the fact that it is the dis
tributing center for the vast coal
fields at. Canon City. Trinidad, Walsen
burg and the entire southern portion
of Colorado, and the Commissioner ex
pects to gather some valuable informa
tion. "Within the past few weeks tho
general land office at Washington has
caused lo be withdrawn from cntr3'
more than a million and a half acres
of land said to contain coal in tho
Pueblo district, "to prevent monopoli
zation of the coal industries ot tho
country by railroads and other corporations."
Kate discrimination in other lines of
business rna3 nso bo, lookod into.
At tho conclusion of the hearing here
the Conini'issioricr will go to Denver, to
continue his investigations along similar
lines.
The morning session was devoted to
the examination of Denver & 'Rio
Grande local officials.
Tho principal evidence developed
was the alleged fact that the Colorado
Fuel and Iron company pays a rate of
$2 a ton for coal from Crested Butte
to Pueblo, while tho small local dealers
pa3' $! per ton.
Another piece of alleged discrimina
tion in favor of the Colorado Fuel and
Iron eompav was shown in the mat
ter of the rate on coke from Walsen
burg, being- 75 cents a ton for the
Colorado Fuel and Iron eompam', or
about, half the amount, charged the gen
eral public.

Water Right Decision. jH
A decision by the commissioner of

ceived at the Boise ofiice which is ofj.
great importance. It involves a ques
lion of water rights not previously

Statesman.
On June 22, 1002, Sarah E. Keith MM
made desert entry No. 1773. Final
proof was offered at at Boise land J
office July 9, 1006, in which is was
shown that the desert land had been H
redeemed bv means of artesian wells, !
The local land ofiice held that title. MM
lo all waters in Idaho, whether sur
face or underground, rested in tho
State, and that permit must be oh-
taiucd from the State for the use oi mM

title to the land could be obtained from
the Government.
Tho commissioner of the General
Land office holds that if water be oh-
taincd from artesian wells locnted on H
tho land to be watered no allowing of H
State appropriation is required in H
order to obtain Government title H
through the desert Jand act. H
