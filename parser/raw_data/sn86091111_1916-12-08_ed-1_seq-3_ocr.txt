Washlngton, Dec. 6.—President Wll-M
son today delivered his message to
both houses of congress In Joint ses
slon. The address was as follows :
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this time the duty laid
upon me by the Constitution of com
municatlng to you from time to time
information of the state of the Union
and recommending to your considéra
tlon such legislative measures as may
be judged necessary and expedient I
shall continue the practice, which I
hope has been acceptable to you. of
leavlng to the reports of the several
heads of the executive departments the
elaboration of the detailed needs of
the public service and confine myself
to those matters of more general pub
11c policy with which It seems neces
eary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
thls session and shall make my sug
gestions as few as possible; but there
were some things left undone at the
last session which there will now be
ttme to complete and which It seems
necessary in the interest of the public
to do at once.
In the first place. It seems to me lm
peratively necessary that the earliest
... ,.
possible consideration and act on
should be accorded the remain ng
measures of the program of settle
. , . .. . , , , . .
ment and regulation which I had occa
, ® . •. . .. .
slon to recommend to you at the close
of your last session in view of the pub
11c dangers disclosed by the unaccom
modated difficulties which then existed,
and which still unhappily continue to
exist between the railroads of the
country and their locomotive engineers,
con uctors, and trainmen.
Railway Troubles First
I then recommended:
First, Immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the Interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
In the bill recently passed by the house
of representatives and now awaiting
action by the senate ; In order that the
commission may be enabled to deal
with the many great and various duties
now devolving upon It with a prompt
ness and thoroughness which are, with
tta present constitution and means of
action, practically Impossible.
Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wages In the employ
ment of all railway employees who are
actually engaged In the work of oper
nting trains In Interstate transporta
tion.
Third, the authorization of the ap
polntment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
suits In experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day In railway trans
portation alike for the men and for
the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration by the In
terstate commerce commission of an
Increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoption of the eight
hour day and which have not been off
set by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts dis
closed justify the Increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
of such controversies as the present
by adding to it a provision that, in case
the methods of accommodation now
provided for should fail, a full public
Investigation of the merits of every
such dispute shall be instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
And, sixth, the lodgment In the
bands of the executive of the power.
In case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll
ing stock of the railroads of the coun
try as may be required for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft Into
the military service of the United
States such train crews and adminis
trative officials as the circumstances
require for their safe and efficient use.

The second and third of these rec

thorized the appointment of a com
mission to observe aud report upon the
practical results, deeming these tbe
measures most Immediately needed ;
but lt postponed action upon the other
suggestions until an opportunity should
be offered for a more deliberate coo
Rderation of them. The fourth reo
Immendation I do not deem It neces
»ary to renew. The power of the In
terstate commerce commission to grant

ferred to is indisputably clear and a

The other suggestions—the Increase
In the Interstate commerce commis
sion's membership and In Its facilities
for performing its manifold duties, the
provision for full public Investigation
and assessment of Industrial disputes,
and the grant to the executive of the
power to control and operate the rail
ways when necessary In time of war
or other like public necessity—I now
very earnestly renew.
The necessity for such legislation Is
manifest and pressing. Those who have
Intrusted us with the responsibility
and duty of serving and safeguarding
them ln such matters would find It
hard. I believe, to excuse a failure to
act upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of action
upon them.
Not only does the Interstate com

Other Legislation Urged.
Three matters of capital Importance
await the uetlon of the senate which
have already been acted upon by the
house of representatives : the bill
which seeks to extend greater freedom
of combination to those engaged In pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than is now thought by
to be legal under the terms of the laws
against monopoly; the bill amending
the present organic law of Porto Klco ;
and the bill proposing a more thor
ough and systematic regulation of the
expenditure of money in elections, com
monly called tbe Corrupt Practices Act.
I need not labor my advice that these
measures be enacted into law. Their
urgency lies In the manifest circum
stances which render their adoption at
this time not only opportune but neces
Even delay would seriously
Jeopard the Interests of the country
and of the government.
Immediate passage of the bill to reg
ulate the expenditure of money to elec
tions may seem to be less necessary
than the Immediate enactment of the
other measures to which I refer; be
cause at least two years will elapse
before another election In which fed
eral offices are to be filled ; but It would
greatly relieve the public mind If this
Important matter were dealt with
while the circumstance* and the dan
gers to the public morals of the pres
ent method of obtatniug and «pending
campaign funds stand clear under re
cent observation and tbe methods of
expenditure can be frankly studied in
tbe light of present experience; and a
delay would have the further very se
rious disadvantage of postponing ac
tion until another election was at band

We have not the necessary instruioen- !

deemed to be doubtful whether they
could be created upon au adequate
scale under our present laws. We
should clear away all legal obstacle*
and create a basis of undoubted law
for it which will give freedom without
permitting unregulated license. The
thing must be done now. because the
opportunity Is here and may escape us
If we hesitate or delay.
Porto Rico's Needs.
Tbe argument for the proposed
amendments of the organic law of Por
to It ion is brief and conclusive. The
present laws governing the island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
Its people are not Just. We have cre
ated expectations of extended privi
lege which we have not satisfied.
There Is uneasiness among the people
of the Island aud even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our intentions
concerning them which the adoption of
the pending measure would happily re
move. We do not doubt what we wish
to do In any essential particular. We
ought to do it at once.
There are other matters nlready ad
vanced to the stage of conference be
tween the two houses of which It Is
not necessary that I should apeak,
äome practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be found
and action taken upon them.
