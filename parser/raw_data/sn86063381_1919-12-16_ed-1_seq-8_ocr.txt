IN XMAS APPEAL
FOR ARMENIANS
i n
Former President Taft Leads In
Eloquent Plea tor Support ot
Near East Relief.
To save the live* of 800 000 people
In Armenia and other westerD Asian
countries and to care for more than
J80.000 Orphans who are homeless
therejformer President William How
ard Taft, Henry Morgenthau, former
ambassador to Turkey, and Alexander
J. Hemphill, the New York banker, as
members of the Executive Committed
of Near Bast Relief the former Amer
ican Committee on Armenian and
Syrian Relief, have Issued a Christ
mas appeal for continued support ot
this organization' and Its work
Near East Relief Is now operating
under a government charter and is
practically alone In the v. extern Asian
Held, the Red Cross several months
ago having announced Its withdrawal.
The Christmas letter, a classic of Its
kind. Is as follows:
"Dear FriendAnother little child
has shriveled up and died.
"The mother, creeping back, gaunt
and cold, from the desert, has put
down the thin little bones with those
that strew the road and has sunk be
side them never to rise again.
"Only a little child and a mother
out on the -bleak Armenian road I But
what is that vision hovering there and
what is that voice the cold winds bear
to the ears of our souls'I was hungry
and ye gave me no meat I was naked
and ye clothed me not'
"Today-ryes, todaywhile we are
preparing our gifts for Christmas,
many more of these little children
not a hundred nor a thousand, but
250,000 of themare 'still wandering
uncared for and alone In that dead
land, 'their weazened skins clinging In
fear to their rattling bones.' and they
are crying out with gasping breath, 'I
am hungry, I am hungry!' And the
voice of one who watches us as we
prepare gifts to celebrate his birth
day comes again to the ears of our
souls'I am hungry I I am hungry 11 I
am hungry I!
"Now, the children and the mothers
In Armenia are dreading the winter.
'Just human remnants they are, not
protected, many of them, from the ele
ments by even the dignity of rags.
The most favored have merely shred
ded rags' How shall we sing our
Christmas songs and laugh and light
the candles apd give beautiful gifts
while that pleading voice cries In the
an of our souls, 1 am naked and cold
Hiaked and cold?'
"But we can feed and clothe these
perishing onessome of thembefore
It la too late. Herbert Hoover has ca
bled ffonk the Caucasus, 'It Is impossi
ble that the loss of 200,000 lives can at
this day be prevented, but the remain
ing 600,000 can possibly be saved.'
They need not starve and freeze and
die If we will them. In the name
of him who saw the multitude 'as
sheep not having, a shepherd and was
moved with compassion toward them,'
who exclaimed when his disciples
would turn them away, They need not
depart, give ye them. to eat I* open
your heart and purse and give to
these Christians whom he loves, who
are suffering for hlro and with whom
he is suffering. They need not die.
Give ye them to eat
^Fifteen dollais a month will pro
vide food, clothes, shelter and educa
tion toward self support for one or
phan child.
"Ten dollars a month will provide
food, clothes and shelter for one or
phan child
"Five dollars a month will provide
food for one orphan child.
"He fed 5 000 hungry people In the
wilderness and said to his followers,
The things that I do shall ye do also,
and greater things than these shall ye
do." Today nearly 800,000 destitute
Armenianshis peopleneed food and
clothing.
"He took little children In his arms
and blessed them. Today will you take
one or more of these sad. cold, hungry
little children of Armenia into your
arms and heart in his name and give
them food and warmth and life?
"What a Joyful Chilstmas It will be
when with your songs and your laugh
ter yu bear a voice of wondrous
sweetness speaking to you, 'O, ye
blessed of my Fathei, I was hungry
and ye gave me meat, I was naked and
ye clothed me Inasmuch as ye have
done it to these, my brethren, ye have
done it to me.'
"In his name.
"Faithfully yours,
-WILLIAM H. TAFT.
