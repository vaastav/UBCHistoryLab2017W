We are* reminded or the ‘‘prayer
‘• i iin” formed by certain over-zealous
women to pray McKinley out of office
It is such silly and ill-adyised moves
which weaken the influence of a noble
band of moral and temperance workers.
It was evidently a smooth political
scheme which died abornin’.
Four circuit judges in St. Louis dis
posed of 102 divorce cases at one sit
ting last week. That is “rushing the
growler” with a vengeance, and the
old-fashioned homily about “marrying
in haste and repenting at leisure” is
out of dale in these swift times. The
ease with which divorces can be secur
ed these days in becoming a “social
evil,” and must soon call for a change.
During the recent campaign we
heard considerable about the great
economy of Gov. Rogers’ administra
tion. It now developes that the print
ing fund is exhausted and the reports
of all slate officers must be transmitted
to the legislature in manuscript, in
stead of each member having the bene
fit of a printed copy as usual. Defici
ciency appropriation bills for these fits
of fusion “economy,” promise to be
numerous.
Th ere are four excelsior factories on
the Pacific Coast, located at Eureka.
Cal., Tacoma, Wn., Eugene and Port
land, Oregon. It isestirnated that one
cord of cotton wood or balm makes one
ton of excelsior. The excelsior finds a
market as far East as Denver. ‘ The
total daily output is estimated at ten
tons. The excelsior is baled in ordi
nary hay presses and weights from 140
to 180 pounds to the bale. The light
colored excelsior is made from the out
side of the wood, while the dark colo
red is made from the heajrt.
The Brewer’s association of the
United States already has a represen
tative at Washington to urge the com.
on ways and means to recommend the
repealing of at least a portion of the
beer tax. He tells a pitiful story
about the distress of the poor brewers,
whose business is in a most deplorable
condition because of tax of $2 a barrel
of thirty-one gallons, which he says
is about 40 per cent of the price, and
must be paid by the brewers, because
the saloon-keeper and their patrons
cannot stand it. The consumption of
beer fell off 1,000,000 barrels last year
it is claimed, whereas it is maintained
it ought to have increased 2,000,000
barrels.— Tacoma News.
Within the past two weeks the lum
ber mills of Washington have been re
ceiving a large number of orders from
the Mississippi Valley district, says the
Tacoma Ledger. A greater portion
are for delivery after the first of the
year, all of which is taken as indica
tive that next season there will be a
rush of business to this section from
all over the country. There has also
been a big increase in orders from
Western Nebraska and Colorado, of
which to the present time a greater
number are of immediate delivery.
All the mills of this section are there
fore well stocked up with orders, and
there is every prospect that next sea
son will be a very busy one.—W. C.

| Signature of
The President’s Message*
Washington, Dec. 3.—President Mc-
Kinley, in his message to congress to
day formulated an exceedingly strong
state paper, and clearly indicated a
line of policy for his party and his ad
ministration.
At the beginning he congratulates
the American people that their love
for liberty is so firmly established, and
assures them that the republic was
never so strongly entrenched in the
hearts of the people as now’. Popular
government is stable and secure. In
our foreign intercourse the dominant
question is the solution of the Chinese
problem, and it is declared tbit the
policy of the United States ha- been
from the first to seek such a solution
as shall bring about permanent safety
and peace to China, preserve the ter
ritorial administrative entity and pro
tect all rights guaranteed to friendly
pow’ers by treaty and international law
Treaties with the Argentine Repub
lic, the Austro-Hungarian government
Belgium and the South American re
publics are reviewed at length in re
lation to their effect upon expanding
trade and the protection of investors,
persons accused of crimes and com
mercial interests. Our foreign relat
ions with the minor governments are
summarized as being entirely harmon
ious and the best of good will exist in
our relations with France, Germany
and others of the powers.
The modus vivendi has prevented
friction and open rupture over the
boundary line in Alaska, but is pro
nounced only a temporary makeshift,
and the president announces that he
contemplates a new convention for a
joint determination of the true merid
ian and boundary line.
Jurisdiction for the federal courts in
international cases where the ultimate
responsibility of the federal govern
ment may be involved is again urgen
tly recommended and it is declared
that lynching must not be tolerated,
and courts, not mobs, must execute
the penalties of the law.
Japan is complimented on her de
velopment as a world poiver, and is
given credit for neing a factor for pro
moting the general interests of peace,
order and fair commerce in the far
east. The peace conference at The
Hague is dismissed with a paragraph
and the announcement of the United
States members of the international
board of arbitrators.
Commended to the early attention
of the senate is the convention with
Great Britain to facilitate the construc
tion of the Isthmian canal and to re
move any objection that might be
raised by the Olayton-Bulwer treaty.
The negotiation of a general treaty
of friendship and intercourse with
Spain is commended, and the treaty
of peace by which the Philippine group
whs ceded is reviewed. It is asked
that appropriate legislation be enacted
so that obligation to pay certain Span
ish claims for idemnity may be fulfilled.
The president says the policy of re
ciprocity so manifestly rests upon the
principles of international equity, and
has been so repeatedly approved by the
people that congress ought at once to
give it full effect.
Receipts of government revenue
have increased, while disbursements
have decreased to such an extent that
over $50,000,000 has been added to the
sinking fund.
Congress is urged to provide what
ever further legislation is needed to
insure the continued parity under all
conditions between silver and gold
and is reminded that the party in
power is committed to such legislation
as will better make the currency re
sponsive to the varying needs of busi
ness.
For the first time in history 1 the to
tal of exports and imports for the year
exceeds $2,000,000,000. The exports
are greater than ever before. A re
duction of $30,000,000 in the war tax
es is recommended.
Reviewing American and foreign
shipping, the president says: “lam
satisfied the judgment of the country
favors the policy of aid to our merch
ant marine which will broaden our
commerce and markets and upbuild our
sea carrying carrying capacity.”
Former recommendations regarding
dealing with the trusts are repeated,
and it urged that restraint upon such
combinations as are injurious and
"which are within federal jurisdiction
should be promptly applied.
The president reiterates his purpose
to use his military and civil authority
to the utmost to uphold the sovereign
ity of the United States in the Philip
pines until congress shall have expres
sek its further will. A policy for gov
ernment is strongly outlined, and the
congress is reminded ot its moral and
■material responsibility towards the
millions of Filipinos.
A legislative apportionment in con
formity to the new census returns is
recommended, and there are also reco
met: dalions relating to forest reser
ves, pensions, Alaska, Hawaii, the de
partment of agriculture and other
minor subjects.

Railroads As Reform Agencies.
On many roads the use of liquor by
employes is prohibited, and the know
ledge that he loafs about saloons is
enough to cause his dismissal. Ihis
is a mere matter of self-protection and
incidentally it protects Hie public.
No man in whose keeping rests the
lives of others has any right to under
take his duties while his brain is fud
dled and his judgment warped by the
fumes of alcohol. The restriction has
already resulted in a betterment so
marked that the men so recognize it
and are grateful for it. The railroad
companies held responsible for dama
ges have a right to guard against the
infliction of damages.
One road lias gone further and for
bidden the use of tobacco about sta
tion?, buildings or on passenger cars.
Perhaps this will at first be looked up
on as a hardship, but again the com
pany is within its rights. There are
places in which the use pf tobacco is
dangerous or a nusiance. There are
many men in other callings to whom
the use of tobacco during working
hours is tacitly forbidden. Clerks,
whether in stores or offices, could not
smoke or chew while transacting busi
ness and retain their positions long, tor
their conduct would be offensive.
No corporation would presume to
forbid the use of tobacco absolutely,
and such an order would very prompt
ly and generally be disregarded, but to
say that the smoker shall not imperil
property from fire is different. Tobac
co is recognized as a solace to which
the man who tolls is entitled. Govern
ments supply it to their troops and
the lack of it would cause a greater
protest than .scanty rations would.
Despite all the rules that a railroad
may lay down, the men in its employ
will smoke or chew; most of them will
do both, and all will indulge with con
science clear. Tobacco never has the
effect of making a switch-light dance
or an order read backwards. —Ledger.
No one can reasonably hope for good
health unless his bowels move once
each day. When this is not attended
to, disorders of the stomach arise, bil
iousness, headache dyspepsia and piles
soon follow. If you wish to avoid
these ailments keep your bowels regu
lar by.taking Chamberlain’s Stomach
and Liver Tablets when required.
They arc so easy to take and mild and
gentle in effect. For sale by C. V.

Where Women Vote.
There are four stales in which
women have the unrestricted privilege
of the ballot. This year the ladies
arranged a few feminine surprises,
which gave the male politician the
startling information that he did not
know it all. In Colorado in 1896 46,
720 women voted. This year there
were 86,943 who went to the polls, and
they had a reason for it. They liked
Bryan well enough, but they were not
so bent upon crowning him with laurel
as upon snatching the scalp lock of
Senator Wolcott. This they reached
after with both hands, and they got it
The motive was not political, Wolcott
had owed to his wife his advancement
both in public and private life. Re
cently he divorced her. She is con
siderably his senior, but she had been
this at the time of the marriage. The
women took the view that he had sim
ply tired of her and thrust her aside.
So they have thrust him aside.
Wyoming women have voted so long
that the novelty has worn off and they
go about the duty as calmly as their
husbands. In that slate a Democrat
named Thompson was a candidate for
re-election to the house. He had won
in 1898 with ease, and attributing this
to the feminine voters had written of
the woman vote as something “easy to
get, easy to keep, and easy to manipu
late.” Thompson is wiser now. He
has crawled from under the wreckage,
and observes a lot of women scorned
smiling in a satisfied way. So fearful
were the women that Thompson would
win that they voted the straight ticket
rather limit d ' any scratching. There
can be little ;ebLiuM but that Thomp
son wishes he bad never said it.
Utah’s surprise package was in the
form of a landslide against the only
woman candidate. She was on the
Bryan ticket for elector and ran so far
behind the ticket as to prove that
women are not always loyal to a rep
resentative of their own sex. In Idaho
nothing particular happened, the wo
men not appearing in evidence as a
separate force.
The lesson taught by the results in
Colorado and \V Voming is specific and
ought to penetrate even the understan
ding of the ward heeler. When women
are allowed to vote they will never sup
port a man who has presumed to tieat
them as political inferiors, and in ihis
they are right and they will endeavor
to protect thesaneity of home life, in
which they are rightj too.—Ltdg>r.

MARK E. REED, Manager.
A Model Mess House,
Feeding men by wholesale is a prob
lem that has confronted the Grays
Harbor Commercial Co. at Cosmopolis
Wash., and they have successfully
solved it. The class of men who work
in the lumber mills of the west coast
are likely to be migratory, but their
services are indispensable, and in order
that they may work they must eat.
Feeding fifty men is easy enough,
hut when it comes to setting tables
for five hundred or more, all to eat at
the same time, it becomes quite a dif
ferent thing. Yet the Grays Harbor
Commercial Lumber Co. have tackled
the problem, and this is the way they
solved it. The company mess house
was started a good many years ago,
when the mill of the concern was a
little “dinkey” aftair operated by water
power. This was torn down and since
that time new and larger ones have
been built as necessity required. The
present house contains the dining or
mess room in one large apartment.
Three rows of tables extend the lull
length of the room with ten tables in
each row. Each table seats twenty
men. The tables are covered with oil
cloth and white procelain dishes are
used. Individual chairs, not benches,
are provided/ At meal time, the time
keeper is master of ceremonies. - He
maintains order, listens to complaints,
seats new men, and take care that
each man occupies his own chair.
Formerly Chinamen did all the
cooking, but as their habits were not
all that was desired white cooks have
taken their ulaces. The cooking is
done on three large ranges that look
like immense store counters with a
stove pipe sticking up through the
middle. The large cooking utensils
are round copper affairs of about twen
ty gallons capacity. The frying trays
are four inches deep and about thirty
inches square. Adjoining the kitchen
on one side is the bakery. Here two
men are constantly employed doing

nothing but mixing and baking. A
large brick baking oven stands in the
middle of this room. Most any time
of day, fields of pies, cakes, cookies,
bread, etc., can be seen spread out on
tables to cool.
The meat shop is a building by it
self. The exterior looks like a root
house, but within it is arranged like
an ordinary meat shop, Around the
sides are iron hooks where hang sides
of beef. A large chopping block stands
in the center and there lie the familiar
cleaver and meat saw. On a broad
board-like counter are piled up the cut
meats for the pans. Ten men do the
work of the establishment on the day
shift and four men are employed all
night. The milk for the boarding
house is furnished by seven Jersey
cows.
There is one peculiarity about the
mess house of the Grays Harbor Com
mercial Co. wherein it differs from
any other. When any unusual dish
is to be served it is not doled out in
small quantities to each man, out is
piled up and everyone gets nil he desires
One day during the past summer ice
cream was served for the entire force.
The only complaint heard w-as, after
the meal, from those men who had in
dulged too freely. It is the same with
other dainties, and the reputation of
this company for taking good care of
their men has extended Jar and wide
among west coast operators.—From
Mississippi Valley Lumberman.
Local Legislation For Good Roads.
The national good roads convention
recently held at Chicago, unlike many
other national organizations, did not
devote its time to the promulgation of
theories. It not only awakened much
enthusiasm iu the matter of good
roads throughout the country but out
lined a systematic and practical pro
gram for future work.
A committee was appointed to pre
sent the action of the convention to
the consideration of President McKiu
lc3 and Secretary of Agriculture Wil
son with a view to securing additional
government aid in the construction of
experimental or subject lesson road
ways in each state. In addition there
is to be united action to secure uni
versal changes in the road laws of sev
eral states.
The general outlines of the proposed
measures are to be drafted by the leg
islative committee of the national as
sociation, the intention being to follow
the laws of the state of New Jersey,
which are the model of the good roads
movement. Similar bills will be in
troduced in thirty eight legislatures
meeting in January, i
The bill to be prepared and intro
duced at the coming session of Wash
ington legislature makes the following
radical alterations in the state laws
governing the construction and opera
tion of public roads;
First—The abolition of the present
poll tax, or statute labor system as a
relic of pioneer days and utterly unfit-
ted for present conditions and the sub
stitution therefor of a cash payment
of the road tax.
Second —The creation of a new state
office, with an official known as the
highway commissioner, to have charge
of the construction and maintenance
of all the main trunk roads of the
state.
Third—Authorizing the employment
of convict labor in the preparation of
material for use in the construction of
state roads.
Fourth—The adoption of the legis
lation considered necessary to secure a
proper distribution of the cost of con
struction and the maintenance of good
roads in all parts of the state.
Fifth—The establishment of a state
road fund, to be maintained by sub
stantial appropriations from the legis
lature.
As this conforms with legislation
that will be sought in other states the
various county clubs and others inter
ested in the new movement are expect
ed to urge local members of the legis
lature to vote for the passage of the
measure.
