Undor cover of darkness, a small

forth a reconnoitering party.
Tho latter soon came upon a Ger

minutes later a German cavalry
squadron galloped out of the village,

BRITISH ACCEDE
TO 0. S. PROTEST
Assure State Department
That No Other Vessels of
American Trans-Atlantic
Trade Will Be Taken.
Washington. Dec. 9. Ambassador
Page at London advised the state de
partment today that Great Britain had
acceded to the American protest
against requisitioning of ships of the
American Trans-Atlantic company.
Test cases will bo made of the
steamers Hooking and Genesee which
will not be requisitioned, but held
pending decision of the prize court.
In the meantime, Great Britain as
sures the United States that no other
vessels of the company will be
seized.
Secretary Lansing, In announcing
receipt of Ambassador Page's dis
patch, said Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the
British ambassador,, also had inform
ed him today of the decision of the
foreign office.
Speedy Trial Expected.
A speedy trial of the test cases is
expected. '
Announcement of Great Britain's ac
tion was well received In official cir
cles, where it was feared that requi
sitioning the ships without prize
court proceedings might lead to dif
ficulties. The Hocking and the Genesee, as
well as other ships belonging to the
American company, wore seized be
causo of suspicions that a part of
the money with which they were
bought and registered under the
American flag came indirectly from
the German government. The com
paiiy has denied this absolutely.

FRENCH RETREAT
PURE STRATEGY
Were Compelled to Re-adjust
Lines With View to Shorten
ing Front and Taking
Up Winter Quarters.
Londoh. Dec 9, 1 p. m. The French
retirement from the Krivolak-Carna
positions must bo regarded as a pure
ly strategical move with which the
recent Bulgarian activity in southern
Serbia had little to do, a Reuter dis
patch from Saloniki declares.
After a desperate effort by the
French left to establish a connection
with the Serbian forces making a
last stand at Babuna pass, which lack
of time and resources made Impossi
ble, the dispatch continues, the
French were compelled to readjust
their lines with a view to shortening
their front and taking up winter quar
ters more easily supplied and less
exposed to the inclemencies of the
weather.
Tho French having retired east

GERINYREADY
TO TALK PEACE
Chancellor Declares Govern
ment Will Consider Proper
Peace Proposals at
Any Time.
ANSWERS SOCIALISTS
Would Be Folly for Germany
to Jake Initiative in Mak
ing Peace Proposals.
Berlin, Dec. 9, by wireless to Say
ville. "If our enemies mako peace
proposals compatible with Germany's
dignity and safety, then we shall al
ways be ready to discuss them," said
the Imperial chancellor, Dr. Yon Beth-mann-Hollweg,
In addressing the
reichstag today.
The chancellor mado it clear that in
his opinion it would be folly for Ger
many to propose peace "as long as in
the countries of our enemies tho guilt
and Ignorance of statesmen are en
tangled with confusion of public opin
ion." Answers the Socialists.
The address of Dr. Von Bethmann
Hollweg, which has been awaited with
extraordinary Interest, was mado in
response to the Socialistic Interpella
tion: "Is the imperial chancellor ready
to give information as to the condi
tions under which he will be willing
to enter into peace negotiations?"
In his reply the chancellor said'
"As long as in the countries of our
enemies the guilt and ignorance of
statesmen arc entangled with confu
sion of public opinion, it would be
folly for Germany to make peace pro
posals, which would not shorten but
would lengthen the duration of the
war. First, the masks must be torn
from their faces.
War of Annihilation.
At present they speak of a war
of annihilation against, us We have
to take this fact into account. Theo
retical arguments for peace or pro
posals of peace will not advaucc us,
will not bring the end nearer.
"If our enemies make peace pro
posals compatible with Germany's
dignity and safety, then vc shall al
ways be ready to discuss them. Fully
conscious of our unshaken military
successes, wo decline responsibility
for continuation of the misery which
now fills Europe and the whole world.
No ope can say that we continue the
war because we still desire to conquer
this or that country as a guarantee."
In these words the chancellor, with
impassioned forced stated the posi
tion of the German government on the
question of peace. His remarks were
cheered with great enthusiasm.
Deputies Cheer Chancellor.
When Dr. Von Bethmaiin-Hollwcg
rose to reply to the interpellation
presented by Dr. Scheidemaun, So
cialist leader, silence veil over the
uhole house, but was soon broken by
manifestations of approval. Several
times the deputies Interrupted him
with cheers.
Dr. Von Bethmann-Hollweg began
by saying In the countries at war with
Germany there had been much discus
sion of the Socialist interpellation
pnd that the knowledge that peace
was to be discussed In the reichstag
had been a source of satisfaction to
these countries. This was incompre
hensible, in view of the success won
In tho campaign against Serbia, which
opened tho road to Gormany's Turk
ish allies and threatened the most vul
nerable points of the British empire.
Although this situation wouiu ex
plain a desire for peace on tbo part
of Germany's enemies, be declared,
none of them had made overtures. In
stead they were clinging to the in
tentions which they had announced
publicly "with naive brutality" at the
beginning of the war.
Reviews War Situation.
The chancellor then reviewed re
cent utterances concerning terms of
peace made In countries opposed to
Germany such as the handing over
of Alsace and Lorraine to France, the
annihilation of "Prussian militarism."
the expulsion of tbe Turks, cession of
the left bank of the Rhine and the
creation or a greater Serbia, Includ
ing Bosnia
It was true, the chancellor contin
ued, that there were some persons in
the countries at war with Germany
who took a sensible position, but they
were in the minority and their
voices, like those of certain members
of the English house of lords, were unheard.
Theories Have Lost r-orcc.
Tho theories advanced by Ger
many's enemies, he said, had lost
their force. People had ceased speak
ing of a war of twenty years. The
pretext that the war was being waged
for tho protection of small nations
had lost its persuasive powor in view
of recent events in Greece.
"Small countries are In a serious
plight since England has been fight
ing for them," he remarked.
Principle of Nationality.
He discussed the principle of na
tionality as applied by Germany s
enemies. Ho asked whether the Brit
ish .colonial secretary know that of
1,800,000 Inhabitants of Alsace more
than 87 per cent spoke German as the
mother tongue He asked whether
Poland belonged to Russia by right
of nationality, whether this pnnc pie
losl its powor and value It applied
to India or Egypt. Germany s ene
mies, blinded at the beginning of the
war by falso stories, excited to hatred,
were now able, after military and dip
lomatic defeats, to cling only to the
idea of Germany's annihilation.
Germany Cannot Be Starved.
For this purpose Gormany's enemies
had invented the theory that Germany
could be starved.
On this point the chancellor said
with particujar emphasis that the
wealth and food supply are sufficient;
that the only question is distribution.
Immense Stores of Copper.
As to copper, the chancellor de
clared Germany bad Immense stores,
sufficient for years and years. He
spoke of Germany's success in pro
ducing certain substitutes for certain
articles, such as rubber.
Referring to the discussion whether
Germany's enemies would be able to
bring greatly superior forces Into the
field, tho chancellor mentioned the
fact that France already has called
to tho colors the class of 1917, bring
ing into tbe war the youths under the
usual military age.
Whole House Indignant
The chancellor referred to the
charge that members of the crew of
a German submarine had been shot
while defenseless by the crew of the
British patrol boat Baralong, and said
the English press had concealed the
facts of this case from the nation.
As he made these remarks tho "whole
house arose as an expression of in
dignation. Speaking of the guarantees of the
position of Germany In the future, to
be included in the peace terms, Dr.
Von Bethmann-Hollweg insisted that
the longer the war Is continued wltb
increasing bitterness by Germany's
enemies, tho greater is the need of
such guarantees.
Fighting for Life.
"Wo do not fight in order to subju
gate other nations," he said. "We
fight for the protection of our life
and liberty. For the German govern
ment the war has always been what
it was at the beginning a war o de
fense for the German nation and, for
her future.
"The war can bo terminated only
by a peace which will give the certi
tude that war will not return. We all
agreed about that. There lies only
tho ways and there only will lie tho
strength.
Conscious of her military successes,
the chancellor said, Germany declines
responsibility fpr a further continua
tion of the war. German y, he de
clared, could not bo charged with tho
purpose of fighting on to make fur
ther conquests.
Dr. Scheidemann's Address.
Dr. Scheidemann's address was re
ceived with a degree of interest sec
ond only to tbatLarouseu by the cnan
cellor's speech. He reminded the
house that at the beginning of the
war the Socialists had approved the
attitude of the German government.
A glance at the map, he continued,
would show that Germany, conscious
of her successes and her strength
could not wish for peace without run
ning the risk of being considered
weak-hearted or dispirited.
Denounces Dream of Annexation.
Dr. Scheidemann protested against
the attitude of those who dream of
the annexation of niuch territory, and
spoke with firmness in denunciation
of thoso enemies of Germany who ad
vocate disniemberment of this coun
try. He protested also against the
crusade in foreign countries, in oppo
sition to "Prussian militarism" i be
cause this conception was wrong, and
furthermore because it was a matter
which concerned no one but the Ger
mans themselves. The French, he
said, should abandon the idea of an
nexing Alsace and Lorraine.
Germany's Heavy Sacrifices.
Although Germany had won enor
mous successes with her armies, he
continued, they had been gained at
the price of heavy sacrifices. In
view of the present situation, the
question of peace was important in
all countries. The difficulty lay In
tho fact that statesmen did not know
how to begin negotiations, -fearing
such a step would bo considered a
proof of weakness.
In this connection Dr. Scheidemann
spoke of the statement made recently
In the English house of commons by
Baron Courtney that the British gov
ernment should show itself ready to
nnmit anv nrnnniinl M'hirll WOUld end
the war. " He referred to Italian So
cialists and to the utterances of
Count Andrassy, former Hungarian
premier. He asserted that, according
to reliable private information, the
longing for peace in France was gen
eral. Bringing Europe to Ruin.
Dr. Scheidemann insisted that these
remarks, like those of Baron Court
new could not be Interpreted as a
sign of lessening strength, but were
made In view of the fact that tho war
was bringing Europe to the verge of
ruin. ., , 4
The idea that it was. possible to
starve Germany, he continued, had
been abandoned. According to the
recent census, there wero twenty mil
lion swine and fifty-five million kilo
grams or potatoes in Germany, which
proved there was sufficient food for
all
The proposal of Emperor William
that for Germauy this was no war of
conquest wero recalled by the speak
er Inasmuch as Germany had de
fended her frontiers successiuuy, it
was proper to ask tho chancellor for
an expression In regard to conditions
of peace. He declared that Germany
insisted upon being treated as the
equal of other nations and repudiated
the idea that German hegemony was
the end in view. The present move
ment, he declared, might become an
historic one, since possibly Germany
might gain the glory of having been
the first to dare to speak of peace.

IViorgenpost Violently Attacks Wilson. all
The Morgenpost makes a violent at- ff'Jfl
tack upon President Wilson, saying nl
that It has long shown that he was i'B
ami-German, but that he never be- Kl
fore had given rein to his hatred in K
this fashion. Kl
"This 'neutral' government's head lM
has hardly a word of reproach for the t
shameless incitements of the jingo lM
press against Germany. But he in- t
suits as traitors, anarchists and dls- ?
honorable persons those men in whom M
love for the old fatherland lives, and M
who rise up against the despicable H
things done against them daily." IH
The Krouz Zeltung says that thus H
far there has been no sufficient evl- jJ
deuce of German plots against the H
United States to justify tho words H
of the message. )IH
Germans Do Not Approve Plots. !!"
"Be that as it may," continues the jlH
newspaper, "Germany cannot be made H
responsible for them. There Is no- ;H
body in Germany who approves of ;l
.them. President Wilson, however, .H
seems not to appreciate the psychol- ;B
ogv of those who allow themselves to iH
be" induced to commit such excesses ;fH
through their indignation over the :B
unscrupulous afcd unlimited support 'M
of me enemy oi iuuir u uuwti.ouu, i

The Vossische Zeitung uses over its '"""

the message the headline: "Wilson 'MM
Against the German-Americans," but !"""
does not comment upon the document. !"""
