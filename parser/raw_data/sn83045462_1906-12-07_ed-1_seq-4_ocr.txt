Money in Politics.
This paragraph from the President's message
should be favorably considered by
Congress at once:
"I again recommend a law prohibiting all
firporations from contributing to the campaign
expenses of any party. Such a bill
lias already passed one house of Congress.
Ijrt individuals contribute as they desire,
but let us prohibit In effective fashion all
from making contributions for
any political purpose, directly or Indirectly."
It is highly probable that Uie corporations
liave never given as lil/erally to the managing
politicians as rumor has represented.
Such a topic easily leads to exaggeration.
But they have given largely, and to both
Phi ties, and ever since President Havemeyer
of the Sugar Trust made his admission
on the witness stand In this town
twelve years ago sentiment against the
practice has been growing. It is now very
strong, and the law asked for by the President
should be passed.
We shall not then, however, have solved
the question of too much money in our
elections. Something more must be done
to correct an evil which even then will
lie great. The corporations were prac
tii-all.v barred from the recent campaign,
but neither party went hungry. Both were
well supplied with the sinews of war, and
both made use of all the old devices?some
of thom expensive?for stirring up the
voters ami getting them to the polls. No
individual contribution, with one exception,
was large, but a great many were received,
and the total, in the case of the one parties
of tlie other, was substantial. It still
appeared that we were doing campaign
business on a generous financial scale.
The exception mentioned was startling
\i. ir?.,t
I I 1 < 1 I'll! < ! Olivril, mi. 1 1\ it 1 .) >,
upon his obligation, admitted an expenditure
of a quarter of a million dollars. That
is to say. he had spent at least that much
money in an effort to be elected governor
of New York. Few men can afford such
an outlay, and fewer still are disposed to
make it in quest of political honors. But
the question is, should a man able and
disposed to make it be permitted to do so?
Should he be permitted to buy his way to
place in such fashion? As legislation
should not be sold?and the ruling of corporations
out of politics is to f-revent that
?should offices be left open to traffic?
Had Mr. Hearst been successful at the
polls his bill of expenses would of itself
have been a cloud upon his commission
which nothing could have dispelled.
But how may this sort of thing be remedied'.'
You cannot bar rich men from aspiring
to office, and, as Mr. Hearst has

amount of their campiign contributions is
left entirely to their spirit as spenders and
the stronuofity demanded of them as candidates.
Drunken Men in Police Cells.
Although a coroner's jury has declared
tli.it no responsibility for the death of the
prisoner Colston attaches to the members
of the police department, the public will be
prom- to ask whether this case does not
ii 'innate the demand for a general revision
of the system of treating drunken
in won. i * in the police stations of Washington.
A few months ago a stranger in
tliij* fity. a citizen of West Virginia, died
in h police cell and the case disclosed that
although he had been arrested as a
"drunk" he had probably been given poison
for purposes of robbery. He had received
no medical treatment whatever, and his
death was. apparently, due to the fact
th.it he lay for hours unattended. No one
wis men iormaiiy uiamca jur win* neguin
c. it beins evidently a case which did
lint seriously violate the rules of the department.
Since then, however, orders have
been issued calling for a more frequent examination
of prisoners.
In the Colston case the man was classified
at tile time of his arrest a.s intoxicated.
Jle should have been rated as a patient as
well as a prisoner. He was allowed to
"sleep It off." He slept practically to his
death. Of course the police could not have
known that he had been injured mortally.
But if a nhvslcian had been on duty at the
station house this case would perhaps have
ended differently. At all events the man
would have had a chance for his life.
There should be established here In Washington
a central police station provided
with hospital wards, to which should be
taken all prisoners suffering from illness
or intoxication. These prisoners should
he given medical treatment. This is the
only humane way to dispose of the victims
of the drink habit. They are in need
of attention at all times and they should
no longer be rated as mere incumbrances
Hi.d thrown into cells to sleep or suffer
Slid run lilt? nan in ut-aiu imuus" mancution.
If the police department lacks funds
or authority now to provide such a central
m ?tion it should be provided with the
means through early legislation.
Recent experiences will always leave a
lingfring hope that the Allegheny mountains
may stand as an effectual protection
to the eastern public from a cold-wave
prediction.

The Proposition From Des Moines.
A reply to The Star's inquiry of yesterday
respecting an overhauling of the Constitution
has come more promptly than expected.
The resolutions of the Des Moines convention
now in session considering the question
of e'ecting United States senators by
popular vote, after complaining of the Senate's
refusal to assist In that movement,
contain the following:
"That while this convention would much
prefer that Congress should submit to the
several slates a proposed amendment to the
Constitution for the election of senators by
direct vote of the people, so that the states
might p.iss upon It as a single question, yet
Inasmuch as the Senate persistently refuses
to submit such anendment. it therefore
earnest^ r< commends that the legislatures
of the several states do. in pursuance o(
Article IV of the Constitution of the United
Slates, make application to the Congress tu
call a convention for the purpose of proposing
amendments to the Constitution of
the I'nited States."
A large majority of the states are represented
at this convention by delegates
named by the governors. The Importance oi
lilt.' uiirciiw^ nas iruigniiru, nnu luc uusiness
Intrusted to men of reputation and experience.
Politics does not enter into the
matter at all. Democrats and republicans,
differing widely on other issues, are agreed
as to the question of senatorial elections,
and in discussing that have come to an
agreement as to this larger question.
Well, whv not a constitutional convention?
What but good could come of it?
The debates in themselves would b? of the
greatest value. To such a body none but
men of recognized learning in the law and
nnt-nrn?nnn( nrmiM Kn nnnf o n*1 frAni thijil'
gutri iimriii T?UUm uc ocut. aiiu in/m i"?*-. ?conferences
and discussions everybodywould
be able to extract something of
value. The Constitution as it stands has
occasioned no end of disputes. Great
lawyers and great publicists have all along
been found on either side of the line. We
have had from the beginning, and have
now. a strict construction school ajcid a
liberal construction school, and all sorts
of meanings have been read into, and then
rn'xl ..lit .. f thn mora iiVinnrlint nmvinlniW
? cau VUV Vil ilic ?11VI t lUtlV
of the instrument.
But more vital than this is the fact that
things have changed so much with us in the
past fifty years. In many particulars we
httve a new country. In that time we have
fought two wars, one of them for the preservation
of the government Itself, and from
both inherited new problems of the highest
Importance. The states were welded together
by the civil war. and since then we
have been operating largely on centralized
principles, while as a result of the war with*
Spain we have acquired territory far from
our [tase, ana caning ior new nnuucs iu
the exercise of both executive and legislative
functions.
We are not going backward in our national'life.
and we cannot stand still. For-,
ward is the law of a vigorous body politic,
and if the national chart needs substantial
revision?always preserving of course the
principles of liberty and equality before the
law?revision should be made. At any rate,
why not formally and officially discuss the
whole subject?
"Bob" Taylor on Bryan.
Senator-elect Taylor of Tennessee?people
Insist upon calling him "Bob"?has been
in Kilt fnll II fl t imp trt

talk politics. His admirers, interested as
they are in all he says, seem to care more
for his views about publlQ men ar . public
issues of the day than for his "word-paintings"
of this, that, and the other. At any
rate wherever he goes he is interrogated
about current political matters,- and he always
obliges his interrogators. He tells
them what they want to know, in terms
both to Instruct and to entertain, and never
shies at any topic.
Mr. Taylor is a Bryan man. It must be
the Nebraskan's eloquence that has such a
grip 011 his admiration. Something has, for
despite his two defeats for the presidency,
his ineffective campaign for Judge barker
In 11MJ4 and his equally ineffective effort to
elect democratic representatives this year,
as well as his declaration in favor of government
ownership and operation of railroads.
of which Mr. Taylor does not approve,
Mr. Bryan still appears to the Tennessee
leader as the strongest man in the
democratic party, and the one who should
j be nominated in 1908.
[ Mr. Taylor sees no difficulty in taking Mr.
Bryan and leaving Mr. Bryan's doctrines.
He says that the party will write the platform,
putting Its disapproval on government
ownership of railroads, and then place
the standard in Mr. Bryan's hands. He
does not seem to doubt that Mr. Bryan will
accept on the party's terms, and pledge
himself to be guided by the party's wishes.
In other words. Mr. Taylor sees Mr. Bryanno
loneer the leader but the led, and anx
ions enough now for office to follow where
the party Judgment directs.
Out of what this confidence grows is not
clearly apparent. Mr. Bryan was leading
when he spoke in the Madison Square
Garden, and has been leading ever since,
despite the storm of protest awakened by
that address. Whether before western,
southern, or middle state audiences, he has
continued to expound his railroad views,
in n u-9v to testify to their, absolute, siilr.
eerity. His only concession has been 1n an
admission that he might be ahead of his
party on the issue, but this was coupled
with an intimation that he fully expected
his party to "catch up."
If put to the test suggested by Mr. j
Taylor will Mr. Bryan yield? Were he to
run for President on a platform accepted
as condemning the issue of government
railroads, Mr. Bryan in office could not in
honor move in that direction. The influence
of the presidency while he exercised it
could not be thrown as Mr. Bryan would
feel it should be with regard to a policy
more important in his eyes than any he has
espoused since he staked all on silver.
A Nippy Day.
Boreas and Jack Frost got busy together
early this morning and gave Washington
a nip of the real thing in the way of winter
weather. There was only a sprinkling
of snow, but it served warning of what
may come later. The thermometer shrank
from the chill blasts until it registered
below 30. It was not so very cold, but It
? ~Hica crr?ap?.hlf?. The wind
played havoc. It drove the chill air Into
the houses and rattled the windows and
buffeted the unfortunates who had to venture
abroad. It made a plaything of the
man who carried the banner in the minstrel
parade. He was earning alT that was
coming to him. He was a spectacle worth
watching. Imagine a man carrying a sail
head-on against the wind on a day like
this! Especially in the middle of Pennsylvania
avenue! Watching him, other men
forgot their troubles and laughed loud and
inr.tr miH ahile thus diverted some of them
permitted the wind to toy with their hats
and they went racing oft in pursuit. It
was lively work, today, trying to live in
Washington. And while the cold wind
blew In the open, the hot-air blast on
Capitol Hill did its best to temper the atmosphere,
but without avail beyond the
marble walls. Life is various and diverting
in the capital city at times.
Considering the salaries paid by insurance
companies and other business enterprises.
a request for ?7,D00 a year for a
statesman in Congress does, on the whole,
seem rather modest.
With Mr. Wellman discussing his departure
and Mr. Peary discussing his return
there is no danger inai me suojeci or
arctic exploration will not be well covered.
There would not be so much Indignation
if some of the western coal operators would
be content to raise the price without precipitating
an actual famine.
Mr. Bryan has had his troubles, and had
them on a large scale. But he has never
been seized by any fixed determination to
serve in the ranks.
Russia may yet accumulate enough energy
in Asia to keep the Japanese too busy
to think of war with the other side of the
world.
The coal lands in the west may yet arouse
David B. Hill to re-enter public life with a
i few government ownership suggestions.
Bryan on Professional Soldiers.
Mr "Rrvan riptpots and dpnlorps a "war
like tone" in the President's references to
1 the army and navy. He says: "War ought
! ! to be a last resort, not a first considera'
tlon. It is bad enough to have a few professional
soldiers." Yes, Indeed. A beautiful
sentiment, as a sentiment. But would Mr.
i Bryan have no professional soldiers at all?
' Will he pledge himself if elected President
to recommend smaller appropriations
for West Point and Annapolis, and a return
to the olJ figure of twenty-Are thousand
for the army? We could not have
too little of a bad thing. Mr. Bryan as
a critic In private life, fi^urin* on cam
paigfi material. Is a very different man, we
may be sure, from wh*t he* would be as
President of the United States ehareed
with the duty of making recommendations
to Congress on the subject of the
general welfare.
California hints that President Roosevelt
has not taken the same pains toward informing
himself on the Japanese question
that he has taken with reference to the
Panama canal.

"Above all things," said the sincere friend

Railroad "Accidents."
From the New York Herald.
Do the public realize the enormous number
of nersons killed anuuallv In railroad
accidents in the United btates? Do they
know that In the careless, happy-go-lucky
manner in which our railways are operated
0,7(C5 persons lost their lives and 8<S,00S were
injured during the last fiscal year? This is
not guess work. Those are official figures.
Think of it! Nearly 10,000 dead, and not
for from 100,000 maimed within a twelvemonth,
by systems that send carloads of
freight and passengers rushing over the
country, pell mell, in a devil-may-care fashion,
with the result of trains ditched here,
others ploughing into each other there,
grade crossings having wieir victims at
numerous places, and wrecks such as the
latest holocaust on Thanksgiving day, near
l>ynchburg, Va., constituting another chapter
in the ever continued tale of American
railway tragedies. That is the cold, solid
truth ulukiit it Tt id not tr? hp Hpnipd nr
softened down, or managerially glossed
over with would-be indignant assertion that
accidents are unavoidable and often due to
what old-fashioned bills of lading called
the "act of God."
Why Shop Early P
From the Chicago Post.
There are several excellent reasons why
you should do your Christmas shopping
as early as you possibly can, but the chief
one is?or should be?concern for the cltrks
in the stores who have to bear the brunt
of the extra holiday buying. It is because
of the hardships that holiday shopping
places on the young women, girls, and even
children, in the stores, that a national effort
is being made to induce buyers to be
more thoughtful. for it is merely through
thoughtlessness that many stoppers delay
their holiday buying to the last possible moment.
Newspapers and merchants throughout
the country are joining in an effort to
bring it home to millions of shoppers that
they can benefit themselves and everyone
concerned if they will do their Christmas
buying early in the season and early in the
day, thus lengthening the holiday shopping
period and reducing the disadvantages
usually attendant upon the holiday crowds.
