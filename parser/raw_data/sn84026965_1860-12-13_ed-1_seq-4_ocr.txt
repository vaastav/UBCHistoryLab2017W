Pausa and Think.
, Oh! how many souls are sorrowing
In the suniit world, to-day,
Because Sin, heaven's livery borrowing,
Leadeth trusting souls astray ;
Because men, aU thoughtless rushing,
Dance along on ruin's brink,
And the voice of conscience hushing,
Will not for a moment think!
'Tis the lack of thought that bringetli
Man to where there's no relief;
'4^'Tis the lack of thought that wringeth
All his inner self with grief.
Would he give a moment's thinking
Ere his every step is made,
He would not from light be shrinking,
Groping on in Error's shade!
Think, immortal.' thou art treading
On a path laid thick with snares,
Where a thousand fiends are spreading
Nets to catch thee unawares.
Pause and think! the next step taken
May be that which leads to dea/h:
Bouse thee ! let thy conscience waken ;
List lo, heed the word it snithI
Think, ere thou consent to squander
Aught of time in sinful mirth ;
Think, ere thou consent to wander,
Disregarding heaven-winged truth.
When the wine in beauty shineth,
When the tempter bids thee drink,
Ere to touch thy hand inclineth, .
Be thou cautious?pause and think!
Think, whatever act thou doest:
Think, whatever word is spoke;
Else the heart of friends the trues/,
May be, by thee, thoughtless broke.
How much grief had been prevented
If man ne'er had sought to shrink
From the right :?to nought consented
Until he had paused to think!
The President's Message.
The only part of the President's Mes?
sage, in vriueh South Carolina is intorcs
tedj, is that bearing on the secession of the
State. His positions are anomalous. He
denies the right of a State to secede from
the Union; yet, he denies, also, that ci?
ther the Executive or Congress has a
right to coerce her back into the Union
in case she seccdos. "The Executive has
no authority to decide what shall be the
relations between tho Federal Govern?
ment and South Carolina," should she se?
cede from tho Union; nor has Congress
any power to coerce her. "The Union
rests on public opinion," and "tho sword
was not placed in their hand (Congross)
to preservo it by force." If, thcrofore,
Congress was to attempt to re-enact the
Force Bill, passed in 1833, under the re?
commendations of General Jackson, ho
would bo compelled to veto it. The se?
cession of a Stato fronrthe Union, ho ar?
gues, was an event not contemplated by
the Constitution of tho United States,
and, therefore, not provided for by that
instrument. He spcak^of^tho fort"Jn
_^__ojirJ^Vi^lPS^^ to the
United States." " No attempt to oxpcl
tho United States from their property has
been made ;" but should it bo made, "the
officer in command of tho forts has re?
ceived orders to act strictly on the defen?
sive."
"We infer, thereforo, from these posi?
tions, that the military power of the Uni?
ted States will not bo used by Mr. Buch?
anan to coerce South Carolina, after she
goes out of tho Union. This bugbear is,
therefore, at an end.
It is due to the President and ourselves,
to<eorreet an error we committod with
respect to him. Wo said, in a former ed?
itorial, that the President had voted for
the Force Bill. The President, when
that Act passed, was our Ambassador in
Eussia. He, therefore, did not vote for
this Bill. Hence, the views he presents
in his Message, arc in no way incompati?
ble with any previous act of his political
life. In reading the last annual Message
of a President of tho United States to
Congress, we cannot forbear the expres?
sion of our sympathy with him, as the
head of a great Government dissolving
under his administration. Causes beyond
his control, have driven the ship of State
amidst tho breakers, whieh aro now
shaking her to pieces. We sincerely be?
lieve that he has earnestly and truly
done his best to avert the catastrophe of
a dissolution of the Union. Ho has fail?
ed, where we believe no man could have
succeeded. All he can do now, as a mag?
istrate and a citizen, is to make the disso?
lution of the Union peaceable.?Charles?
ton Mercury.

Georgia.?A' merchant of Charleston
who has just been through Upper Geor?
gia, and who is himself a native Georgian,
thus writes of the onward tendency of
the cause of secession :
Tho people are aread of the politi-.
cians; they have been waiting to seo
which way the current would go. The
tido is upward and onward; and I con?
fidently believe Georgia will go like a
prairie on fire. The people here say let
South Carolina do nothing to bring them
in contact with the present Government.
Act cool, firm and deliberate.
And, again, of the proposition of Ste?
phens for one last demand to be addressed
to the Northern States, hear tho clarion
notes of tho Columbus Times :
All talk about new planks in tho Geor?
gia Platform to meet the present crisis is
ridiculous. It is a postponement of tho
whole question ; a sliding scale to down?
right submission.

Washington, December 4.?The Sen
ate mot at noon.
The President's Message was read.
Mr. Clingman, of North Carolina, mov?
ed that it be printed, although, he said,
he regarded it as unsatisfactory, in the
present condition of things. A number
of the Southern States would certainly
follow South Carolina within sixty days.
He declared that the wisest men now
counselled an equal division of the Gov?
ernment property, after the payment of
the public debts.
The Senate, after some further desul l o?
ry discussion, adjourned.
In the House, a long debate in refer?
ence to the Message sprang up.
A resolution, offered by Hon. A. ~R.
Boteler, of Virginia, was passed, referring
that portion of the Mcssago relating to
secession to a special committee of one
from,each State; and the whole Message
was also,referred to the Committee of the
"Whole on the state of the Union.
Before tho result of the vote was an?
nounced. Messrs. Singleton, of Mississip?
pi; Jones, of Georgia; Hawkins, of Flor?
ida , Clopton and Pugh, of Alabama ; and
Gartrell, of Georgia, refused to vote, for
the reason that their States had respec?
tively called a Convention to settle the
questions involved.
Hon. W. Porcher Miles said that his
State was now out of the Union, except
the mere form, and that the South Caro?
lina delegation would not, therefore, vote.
Thirty-eight votes were cast against
Botcler's resolution?all Abolitionists.
Tho report of the Secretary of War re?
commends no increase of the army.
All hope of the repeal of the obnoxious
laws by tlie Northern Legislatures, is
now gone.
Since the adjournment general gloom
prevails in Congressional and political cir?
cles. The conservatives generally are
very desponding, and unhesitatingly
prophesy a genera', dissolution as not
very distant.
"Washington, Docember 4.?The Pres?
ident's Message is thought to be the
ablest Mr. Buchanan ever sent in, but it
satisfies neither the North or the South?
it blows hot and cold?opposes the right
of secession, but advocates anything but
coercion. Mr. Boteler's committee of
one from each State, to consider the Mcs?
sago, will be packed by Speaker Penning?
ton, and decided Southern sentiment will
have no one to represent it. Its conclu?
sions will be of no value. The signs ap?
parent arc more and more for disunion.
New York is alive to the crisis, but the
rural districts of the North think it all
flummery, and refuse to yjchj, an im h.
Mr. Cobb's resignation to-morrow will
bo accompanied by an address opposing
the President's views concerning scces
ion.
Judge Black, at present Attorney Gen?
eral, will be nominated for the vacancy
on the bench of the Supreme Court, caus?
ed by the death of Judge Daniel.
Some of the New York members count
their city to be free like Hamburg. They
want to got rid of New England at any
price. The rich bankers here are in
great distress. The weather is clear and
cold.
Washington, December 5.?There was
an exciting scene in the Senate to-day.
We had a war speech from that noted
Abolitionist Hale. He waked up the
Senators Wigfall, Brown and Ivcrson,
who responded in patriotic and noble
terms.
Tho speech of Senator Iversoi* created
a great sensation. He declared that five
States at least would go out of the Un?
ion, even if all the Personal Liberty bills
were repealed. It matters not what Con?
gress might ?fter or do. Senator Hale
said that, if secession was persisted in.
war was inevitable. Senator Ivcrson
doubted that there would be any war.
but if it should come to that, ho would
welcome the invaders with blood};
hands and hospitable graves. Senators
Brown and Davis said the}' believed there
would be a peaceable separation.
The House passed the Homestead bill
by 65 majority. The Pension and West
Point Appropriation bills were passed
viva voce. In the Committee of the
Whole the -Message was referred to the
appropriate Committees, and the Com?
mittee adjourned. In the Committee of
Ways and Means, Mr. Phelps, of Missou?
ri, moved that $10.000,000 in treasury
notes be issued to relievo the embarrass?
ments of the Government. The Coinmit
J tec on Mr. Boteler's resolution of ouc
from each State will be appointed on
Monday, in order to allow the Speaker
time to make the best possible selection.
The IIouso Judiciary Committee had
new evidence to-day in relation to the
Watrous impeachment case.
The treasury suspended payment to?
day. A delay of the treasury note bill is
expected.
Washington, Dcc.G.-To-day the Speak?
er's warrants for the pay of the Members
of the House of Representatives were re?
fused at the Treasury Department, ow?
ing to tho want of funds. The warrants
will be formally protested to-morrow.
About ?200,000 only lias been paid to the
Members since the commencement of the
present session.
The proceedings of Congress show a
stern resolution on the part of the South
not. to yield to any proposed compromise.
The antagonism to the North is daily in?
creasing. It is improbable that any pub
lie business of importance will be transact?
ed till the all-absorbing question of com?
promise or secession is settled.
"Washington, Dec. 6.?The Committee
of Thirty-three, to take into consideration
that portion of tho President's Message
having reference to the political distur?
bances of the country, have appointed Mr.
Thomas Corwin, of Ohio. Chairman.
Messrs. Boyce, of South Carolina, and
Hawkins, of Florida, declined serving on
the Committee amid much excitement.
Mr. John Cochranc, of New York, fol?
lowed in a strong Union speech, and was
loudly cheered from the galleries.
Mr. Boyce, of South Carolina, rose to
decline pending the vote on a motion for
adjounment. The vote was taken, and
the Republicans carried it. The House
adjourned to Monday.
The Senate also adjourned to Monday.
Washington, Dec. 6?7.30 p. M.?The
House Committee is considered a dead fail?
ure. Messrs. Boyce. Davis, Winslow and
Taylor all declare they will not serve.
Two or three leading Republican Sena?
tors will speak in a few days. They arc
expected to follow the line of argument
pursued by Hale in bis speech, showing
that peaceable secession is impossible.
The South Carolina members arc unani?
mous in their desire to prevent a prema?
ture collision with the General Covcrn
mcnt.
It is probable that all the Southern
members will refuse to serve on the Com
mitte of Thirty-three, of which Corwin is
Chairman.
Washington, Dec. G. 10.35 p. m.?The
House Finance Committee has resolved
on Monday to report a new Loan Bill of
810,000,000; to meet the wants of the Gov?
ernment. This measure will relievo the
immediate necessities of the Treasury.
Mr. Bon ham, of South Carolina, will re?
sign from tho Military Committee. The
Chairman of the Committee asked him to?
day to attend a metting to consider the
defences of Fort Moultrie, when Mr. Bon
ham inlormcd him that he would withdraw
from the Committee,
Hon. A. If. Stephens writes here that
Georgia will inevitably secede.
Some of the New York members count
their city to be free like Hamburg. They
w'ant (o gel rid of New England at any
price.
In respect to what is said by the Presi?
dent about ihc forts near Charleston, it
may bo added, that the Secretary of War
has declared that he intends to deliver
over all the forts intact to his successor.
Washington, December 4.?Col. An?
derson, in command of Fort Monltric, has
made a demand upon the War lWi:>-?.
mcnt for additional troops and munitions
of war. lie states that the force now
there is inadequate for emergencies which
might arise in case the people or a mob
should attempt to take it. The President
and Secretary of War are understood to
be favorable to complying with the de?
mand. Other members of tho Cabinet
differ as to the propriety of sending an in?
crease of force, lest it might exasperate
the South and lead to trouble. It has not
yet been determined what course the ad?
ministration will pursue in this matter.
-O
The Secession Question in Califor?
nia.?Advices from San Francisco to the
17th of November, state that the people
of California were waiting with dee]) anx?
iety for the Eastern news showing the
disposition of the Southern States on the
dissolution question.
After hearing of Lincoln's election, all
political animositios greatly moderated,
the Republicans as well as the Democrats
seeming to be fearful of serious trouble
from (he present political condition of (he
coin dry.
The Republican illumination in San
Francisco in honor of Lincoln's election
was a complete failure. Not fifty houses
.in the city responded to the call of the
Republican State Central Committee* to
join in a general illumination. The cause
of it was that the Republicans generally
were not in an exultant mood.
. The Sacramento Standard, organ of the
Brcckinridge Democracy, assumes that
the dissolution of the Union is inevitable,
and urges California and Oregon to seri?
ously consider the question of organizing a
separate Republic on the Pacific coast. The
idea seems to obtain little sympathy, and
is denounced by a large portion of the
press.
The McKknna Will Cask.?We learn
that the Mclvenna will case, which for the
past year has strongly exorcised the peo?
ple of Lancaster, has been compromised.
Mrs. Mclvenna, the widow, will receive
one-fourth'of the estate; and the remani?
ng three-fourths will be divided equally
between the Church and Mrs. Mittag.
The entire estate will be worth, after the
expenses of this litigation have been paid,
about two hundred thousand dollars. The
sale will take place, we learn, in Februa?
ry, provided the "crisis" will permit.
Mrs. Mittag's counsel, Messrs. G. W.
Williams and Allison, J. Bolton Smith,
Win. A. Moore, and John Williams, re?
ceive a foe of twenty thousand dollars.
In every point of view, we think the
compromise fair to all parties. It will
certainly be a relief to Lancaster.? York- j

The Georgia Senate has rejected a
bill to call a Southern Convention.
From Mississippi.-^-Ncw Orleans, De?
cember 3.?The Mississippi Legislature
adjurned on the 30th alt. They passed
unanimously the Convention bill; also,
resolutions in favor of secession, and au?
thorizing the Governor to appoint Com?
missioners to co-operate with the slave
holding States.
The stay law and non-importation act
has been defeated. The elections for the
Convention are to be held on the 20th.
and the meeting of the Convention takes
place on the 7th of January.
The Hon. L. Q. C. Lacmar made a great
secession speech, advocating separate
State action, and the simultaneous adop?
tion by the State of the Federal Constitu?
tion. He favored the formation of a Con?
gress of the present delegates from the
Gulf States, and the appointment of Elec?
tors of a President for the Southern.Con?
federacy.

The Raleigh correspondent of the Char?
lotte Bullet in, says:
" There has been much excitement
here during the evening. Hons. Ash more
and Boycc addressed an assemblage at
the Yarborough hotel, upon the principal
topics of the day?each concluding by ad?
vising separate State action. These gen?
tlemen arc on their way to Washington
city, to consult with their Southern
friends beforo resigning their scats.?
Each, in speaking of the action of South
Carolina, said they had been assured that
Georgia, Alabama. Florida, and Mississi?
ppi would join in the contest for Southern
independence. They seem not to despair
of Virginia and 2sorth Carolina.

Affairs in Alabama.?Montgomery,
Dec. 4.?The disunion movement is spee?
dily but' quietly progressing in Alabama.
One-half of the counties will scud seces?
sion delegates without opposition. In
the others the fight will be confined to
those who advocate secession with the
Cotton States and those who are in favor
of separate State action. The latter will
be largely in the majority.
Despatches from Washington in regard
to the position of Mr. Curry, of this State,
excited indignation among his friends
here. His speech delivered before leav?
ing home for Washington was a strong
disunion harangue.
The Grand Jury of the Federal Courl
of this city, before adjourning, presented
the Union as a nuisance.

The Entrance to a Woman's Life.?
There is a touching beauty in the radiant
, look of a girl just crossing the limits oj
youth and commencing her journey
through the checkered space of woman
hood. It is all dew-sparks and morning
glory to her .ardent, buoyant spirit, a>
she presses forward exulting in blissful
anticipations. But the withering heat ol
tho conflict of life creeps on; the dew
drops exhale; the garlands of hope, shat?
tered and dead, strew the path; and toe
often ere noontide, the placid brow and
sweet smile are exchanged for the weary
look of one longing for the evening rest,
the twilight, the night.

Neat Retort.?An Israelite lady, sit?

" Give yourself no uneasiness," replied
the lady. ,; I am a Jewess, and never eat

"Let Her Go."?"I was," said the
reverend gentleman, <;attending divine

While the officiating clergyman was in
the midst of a most interesting discussion,
an old lady among the congregation arose,
chipped her hands, and exclaimed, " Mer?
ciful Father! if I had one nice feather in
my wing of faith I would ny off to glory."

immediately replied, '-Good Lord, stick it
in and let her go; she's but a trouble I

THE, GLOBE,
THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF CONGRESS.
T PUBLISH now my annual Prospectus of THE
J_ DAILY GLOBE, and the CONGRESSIONAL
GLOBE, to remain subscribers, and inform those
?who may desire to subscribe, that Congress will
meet on the lirst Monday of next December, when
I shall resume publishing the above-named papers.
They have been published so long, that most pub?
lic men know their character, and therefore I deem
it needless to give a minute account of the kind
of matter :hey will contain.
THE DAILY GLOBE will contain a report of the
Debates in both branches of Congress as taken
down by reporters, cqueal, at least to any corps of
short hand-writers in this, or in any other country.
A majority of them will each, he able to report,
verbatim, ten thousand words an hour, while the av?
erage number of words spoken by fluent speakers
rarely exceeds seven thousand five hundred words
an hour. When the debates of a day do not make
more than forty-five columns, they will appear in
The Daily Globe of the next morning, which will
contain, "also, the news of the day, together with
such editorial articles as may be suggested by pass?
ing events.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE AND APPEN?
DIX will contain a report of all the Debates in Con?
gress, revised by the speakers, the .Messages of the
President of the" United States, the Annual Reports
of the Heads of the Executive Departments, the
Laws passed during the sessions, and copious in?
dexes to all. They will be printed on a double
royal sheet, in book form, royal quarto size, each
number containing sixteen pages. The whole will
make, it is believed, at least 2,001) pages. This is
acknowledged to be the cheapest work ever sold in
any country, whether a reprint or printed from
manuscript copy, taking for data the average num?
ber of words it contains.
The coming session will, without doubt, be an
unusually interesting one. because the dehates will,
in .1 great measure, be upon the policy of the Pres?
ident elect, and The Globe will be, as it has been
fur many years past, the only source from which
full debates of Congress can be obtained.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE AND APPEN?

A WEEKLY JOURNAL;
DEVOTED to the best interests of the Southern
States of the American Union, conservative in
Politics and Religion, a disseminator of General
Intelligence, and an earnest advocate in the cause
of Literature, Art and Agriculture, is published at
$2 a year, in advance,

PROPRIETORS,

EDITOR.
Newbcrry District being one of the richest Cotton
Districts in South Carolina; her people are largo
consumers of every kind of merchandize. The
CONSERVATIST, therefore, furnishes one of the
best mediums in the State for advertisers, so far as
Newberry District is concerned, while it enjoys a
fair circulation in the surrounding Districts. The
terms for inserting advertisements are certainly as
reasonable as those of any other journal in the
country, especially when it is desired to advertise
by contract.
The CONSERVATIST numbers among its con?
tributors gentlemen of the first talent and soundest
political faith. With their assistance, the editor
I will endeavor to make his journal an acceptable
and ever welcome family newspaper and fire-side
companion.
The political character of the paper is of tho
strongest States Rights stamp. Believing that the
Constitution under which the Confederacy of the
American States was formed, has been repeatedly
and grossly violated, and that "the Plantation
States" have been the only sufferers?that the
Union of these States is no longer a policy founded
on the principles of right and justice, but-that the
bond of Union is "the cohesive power of public
plunder"?the proprietors prefer that their journal
shall rather seem to be a Southern Extremist than
appear an unconditional advocat? of the Union at
any price.
TERMS.?The paper will be regularly mailed to
subscribers out of the town of Newberry at the fol?
lowing reasonable rates of subscription:
One copy, per year, - - $2.00
Three copies, - 5.00
Five copies, - - - 8.00
Ten copies, - 15.00
Twenty copies, - 25.00
fig^ The money upon these terms always to b
paid in advance.
Nc paper will be discontinued until all arrearages
are paid, and no paper mailed until the subscrip?
tion price is received; unless at the option of tho
proprietors, when the circumstances call for a dif?
ferent course.
All business communications should be addressed
to the " Conservatist, Newberry, S. C." Commu?
nications intended for publication should be ad?
dressed to tho " Editor of tbe Conservatist."
