WEDNESDAY, DEC. 5„ 1900.
The Milwaukee wheat market yes
terday was stronger, closing at c
for No. 1 and 71c fomNo. 2 northern.
Flour was steady. Barley closed at
59c. rye at 50c. corn at 35c. and oats
at 25|c. Hogs were steady at $4.50@
4.80. Grain freights were unchanged.
It cost Hon. H. B. Dahle $2,089.25
to be re-elected to congress in this
district. Of this amount he contri
buted $250 to the Republican State
Central committee, S2OO each to the
Dane and Dodge county committees,
and SIOO each to the Jefferson and
Columbia county committees.
At the coming session of the legis
lature an effort will be made to pass a
measure providing for assistant county
superintendents of schools. It is ar
gued that such officials are needed to
give proper attention to the country
schools, the latter being so numerous
and the territory so extensive in some
of the counties that the superintend
ents are unable to perform their full
duties.
In Dodge county political circles it
is rumored that ex-Sheriff E. J. La
buwi. of Rubicon, is bjoked for a big
job under the La Follette administra
tion. He wants to be a member of
the state board of control. It is also
said that William Wegwart, of Wood
land, and Attorney M. H. Umbreit, of
Beaver Dam. are looking for prefer
ment, too. and that, in addition to all
this, D. P. Doty would like to retain
his position as state factory inspector.
The last session of the Fifty-sixth
congress convened at Washington on
Monday. It was a brilliant opening,
made markedly prominent by the feel
ings of joyful congratulation evinced
by the Republicans over the flattering
outcome of the national election. And
still a veil hung over the whole scene,
occasioned by the loss of two such
valuable legislators as Senators Davis
and Gear. The delivering of the
president's message was of course the
important feature of the openirg. The
document is mainly a concise state
ment of governmental affairs and brt
few recommendations of moment aie
made. The president sees principally
a need for reduction in the war taxes,
the advancement of our merchant
marine, uniform legislation through
out the states for the regulation and
control of trusts, and the reorganiza
tion of the regular army on a basis
consistent with our enlarged conditions.
The Second Congressional district,
which is comprised of the counties of
Dane Dodge, Jefferson and Columbia,
cast a total vote of 41.986 for con
gressman. of which Mr. Dahle received
22,175 and Mr. Aylward 18,799. In
most of the Southern states it doesn’t
seem to require so many votes to elect
representatives, as in South Carolina
less than 29.000 votes elected seven
congressmen, while in Mississippi it
takes still less, as seven congressmen
were elected in that state by about
25,000 votes. The “government with
the consent of the governed, 11 which
was harped upon so vigorously as a
campaign issue by the Democrats,
seems to operate in a most peculiar
way in the sections where Democracy
is most dense and it looks as if this
principle of human liberty wasn’t be
ing so scrupulously observed in the
sunny solid South. In ante-bellum
days the average Southerner considered
himself equal to about live Northern
men in military prowess. The South
ern citizen of today may not think
himself the superior of his Northern
brother, bur as far as practical politics
is concerned the voter in Dixie has
about ten times as much political
power as the voter in other parts of
the country. This inequality of repre
sentation accorded the states of the
South is rather striking and should he
remedied in some way, and wffien
citizens are disfranchised representa
tion should be proportionately reduced.

Washington Letter.
i From our Regular Correspondent.!
Washington. U. C., Nov. 30. 1900.
—President McKinley was too long a
member of congress to make the
mistake of attempting to dictate to
senators and representatives the de
tails of the legislation that should be
passed at this session of congress, but
he talks freely to them of the general
legislation he thinks is needed, and he
impresses upon their minds that what
ever is to be done should be done
promptly, as he is particularly anxious
that nothing should be left undone
that will make an extra session of the
next congress necessary, and as all the
congressional party leaders are in
thorough accord with him everything
now indicates that all necessary legis
lation will be put through at this ses
sion.
Rev. Dr. F. M. Bristol, the presi
dent’s pastor, said in replying to the
toast. ‘-The Mission of the American
Republic, 11 at the ninth annual
banquet of Burnside post, No. 8, De
partment of the Potomac, G. A. R.;
“We believe in expansion—the ex
pansion of freedom and principle. We
believe in imperialism —the imperial
ism of right. We believe in sovereign
ty—the sovereignty of man. We be
lieve in royalty —the royalty of ideas.
We believe in the betterment of man,
the enthronement of man. We be
lieve in the sovereignty of man as man.
and the dignity of man as man. the
American principle is now and ever
will be that man shall no longer be
treated as a chattel, but as a king in
his own right. We believe in aristoc
racy—the aristocracy of the common
people, the brotherhood of man.
The fact that the Democratic sena
tors have the power under existing
rules of the senate to prevent needed
legislation at this session of congress
and force an early extra session of the
next congress, if they dare to take the
responsibility of exercising it. is caus
ing renewed agitation of the expe
diency of so amending the senate rules
as to give the majority a right to cut
off debate on a bill when it is evident
that it is being used solely to delay a
vote. This agitation isn't new by any
means. The same thing has been
voted down by the senate any number
of times and in many shapes, ihe last
time was when Senator Mason s reso
lution. providing that after every sen
ator had had an opportunity to speak
once on a measure the majority might
close the debate, was sent to the com
mittee on rules to die. by a vote of 32
to 24. Senator Hansbrough strongly
favors a rule giving senators the right
to move that a \ ote betaken whenever
satisfied that delay was being purpose
ly indulged in. He said; “Such a
rule would make it impossible for any
individual senator to prevent a vote,
as is now the case, and would give to
a majority of the senate the right to
decide when a vote shall be had. If
this majority believed that the meas
ure had not been sufficiently debated,
or that undue haste was being shown
in the attempt to reach a vote, it
would vote down the motion. Other
wise. we would secure decisive action
without prolonged delay. lam sure
that no senator would try to press a
measure to a vote if he was shown
that such action ought to be postponed
for legitimate reasons. 1 ’
From every class in Washington ex
pressions of regret for the death of
Senator Davis, of Minnesota, are
heard. The president will miss him
as a friend and valued counselor; the
senate will miss him in every conceiv
able way, his wide knowledge, person
al geniality and long membership hav
ing made him one of the leading mem
bers of that body, and he will be
missed by thousands who loved him
and knew him for a true and tried
friend. This is Senator Morgan's
tribute to his memory: “Cushman K.
Davis was my friend; a genial gentle
man, a scholar, and a patriot. As
chairman of the senate committee on
foreign relations. Senator Davis was
especially well fitted to assume the
responsibilities of such an office, and
he nobly fulfilled his tasks, 11 With
the death of Senator Davis, Senator
Frye, ranking Republican member,
became acting chairman of the com
mittee on foreign relations, and he
will be likely to continue as such dur
ing this session of congress. He is in
every way fully qualified to fill the
position. The death of Senator Davis
adds the Minnesota legislature to the
number of those that will have thG
duty of electing two United States
senators to perform at their next ses
sion. Governor Lind may, if he sees fit.
appoint a senator to serve until the
legislature acts, and it is presumed in
Washington that he will do so.
Secretary Root, who returned from
Cuba this week, said of his trip: “I
found the people generally peaceful
and contented, and pursuing their or
dinary avocations. The island is grow
ing steadily more prosperous and the
people seem to be more satisfied. 11
Having the assurances of a majority
of the governments interested that
they endorse the attitude, of this gov
ernment President McKinley is natural
ly confident that the harsh and impos
sible demands agreed upon by the
foreign ministers at Pekin will be very
much modified before they are present
ed to China. The agreement of the
ministers was subject to the approv
al of their respective governments,
which under the circumstances leaves
things about as though it had never
been made.
The Best Plaster.
A piece of flannel dampened with
Chamberlain’s Pain Balm and bound to
the affected parts is superior to any
plaster. When troubled with lame
back or pains in the side or chest, give
it a trial and you are certain to be more
than pleased with the prompt relief
which it affords. Pain Balm also cures
rheumatism. One application gives re
lief. For sale by C. A. Gauim.

results of the census of 1900, with
reference to the proposed admission of
new states and representation in con
gress; the meaning of the national
election; the Cuban-Constitutional con

McKinley, the eighth president to be
re-elected for a second consecutive
term.
A Woman’s Awfui Peril.
“There is only one chance to save
your life and that is through an oper
ation, 11 were the startling words heard
by Mrs. 1. B. Hunt, of Lime Ridge,
Wis., from her doctor after he had
vainly tried to cure her of a
frightful case of stomach trouble and
yellow jaundice. Gall stones had
formed and she constantly grew
worse. Then she began to use Elec
tric Bitters, which wholly cured her.

•‘Sonorita” Is a Name.
“Senorita” is the Spanish prefix to
the name of an unmarried young lady.
It corresponds to the French “madem
oiselle,” to the American “miss.” The
use of “senorita” as the Christian
name is extraordinary. Down in Ten
nessee there is a lady upon, whom her
parents bestowed the baptismal desig
nation of “senorita” when she was a
child. It must be admitted, that the
name looks well in print and sounds
well when spoken. ‘•Senorita” Alexan
der lives at Elizabethton, “in the. coun
ty of Carter,” as the official language
has it. And what lends additional in
terest to the fact is that “Senorita”
Alexander has just been appointed and
confirmed postmaster at Elizabethton.
The word postmaster is used advisedly.
Uncle Sam does not recognize officially
a “postmistress.”
New Rubber Plant.
Rubber being in growing demand,
scientific men have been trying to ob
tain it from plants which had not
been available commercially before.
Two French chemists, MM. Arnaud
and Vernuil, have discovered a proc
ess by which it may be obtained from
the Landolfia vine, which grows wild
and luxuriantly in nearly all parts of
Africa. The process of tapping the
Landolfia is impracticable as the flow
ot rubber harden® too quickly. By
the new process the vine is crushed in
hot water, by which means all th©
rubber it contains is extracted.
A Land of Contrasts.
In a recent lecture on the cannibals
of North Australia, given by Dr. Carl
Lumholtz, in New York, he designat
ed that country as the “land of con
trasts, where women are without
beauty, birds without songs, flowers
without fragrance, and where dogs do
not b^k-”

Mr. Major, the famous cement man, of| New
York, explains some very interesting facts
about Major’s Cement.
The multitudes who use this standard arti
cle know that it is many hundred per cent,
better than other cements for which similar
claims are made, but a great many do not
know why. The simple reason is that Mr.
Major uses the best materials ever discovered
and other manufacturers do not use them, be
cause they are too expensive and do not allow
large profits. Mr. Major tells us that one of
the elements of his cement costs $3.75 a pound,
and another $2.65 a gallon, while a large share
ot the so-called cements and liquid glue upon
the market is nothing more than 16-cent glue,
dissolved in water or citric acid, and, in some
cases, altered slightly in color and odor by the
addition of cheap and useless materials.
Major’s Cement retails at 15 cents and 25
cents a bottle, and when a dealer tries to sell a
substitute you can depend upon it that his
only object is to make a larger profit.
The profit on Major’s Cement is as much as
any dealer ought to make on any cement And
this is doubly true in view of the fact that each
dealer gets his share of the benefit of Mr. Ma
jor’s advertising, which now amounts to over
$5,000 a month, throughout the country. Es
tablished in 1976.
Insist on having Major’s. Don't accept any
off-hand advice from a druggist.
If you are at all handy (and you will be like
ly to find that you are a good deal more so
than you imagine) you can repair your rubber
boots and family shoes, and any other rubber
and leather articles, with Major’s Rubber Ce
ment and Major’s Leather Cement.
And you will be surprised at how many dol
Jars a year you will thus save.
If your druggist can’t supply you, it will be
forwarded by mail; either kind. Free of
postage.
