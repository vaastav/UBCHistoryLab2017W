The Succession Passes to Albert,

Brussels, Deo. 17. Tolling bells and
booming cannon announced the death
of Leopold II. king of the Belgians.
Half masted flags of red, yellow and
black fly from the puolic buildings.
Crowds fill the streets and discuss
the king's death and. whatever their
opinions of his personal life, join in
tributes to his greatness.
Leopold died as he lived, relentlessly
repulsing his opponents and clinging
tenaciously to his favorites; and at
death's brink, when he insisted upon
closing u,d certain private business ne
gotiations, he was unable to escape the
Influence of his greatest passion, that
for work and material gain.

Prince Albert, Son of Ijeonold s Youngest Brollier, the Late Prince Philippe,
Who Will Succeed to the Belgium Throne.
Princess Louise of Belgium, eldest
of the three daughters, arrived here
today. The second daughter, the un
fortunate Stephani. was here when her
father died, but was refused permis
sion to sec him until after dfath. When
she was admitted to the chamber she
threw herself beside the body in a
utate of uncontrolled grief. Prince Al
bert, the new kins, was moved with
pity, and, seizing his cousin's hand,
1 nelt with her beside tho body, giv
ing mute expression to his sympathy
for and intended protection of the ban
ished daughter. The group of old ser
vants, who loved all three, wept at
the sad picture.
King Leopold fought death as he bad
fought the world and struggled to the
end. For two days he had survived
r.n operation that wmild have killed
the average man of hi? age and only a
moment before his sudden death he had
talked of revisiting sunny southern
France and "of the blue skies of the
Mditerranean.
The funeral will be held next Wed
nesday. He had expressed a wish for
the simplest rites, but it is understood
the ceremonial observed at the burial
of his father Leopold I. will be follow
ed. Prince Albert will on Thursday take
the oath as king.
The body,, of the king, cloth
ed in the uniform of a lieutenant
general, remains in the chambler of
the palms" where death entered last
night. It is surrounded only by those
who in life had won and had retained
the king's close friendship. The ex
pression on the dead monarch's face is
peaceful, as though the end was pain
less. The body will be placed in a
casket this evening when a period of
mourning officially will begin.
Dr. Thirir said today:
"I knew that the king was suffering
from a malady of the heart. This was
our chief anxiety when operating, but
we decided to resort to surgery in or
der to save his majesty from terrible
suffering. As a matter of fact he died
without suffering at all."
Immediately following Leopold's death
two nuns laid out the body, and
preparations for removing it to the city
proper were made. The obsequies will
take place at the Collegiate church of
St. Gudula.
Temporary Regency.
This morning early Premier Schol
ia ert proceeded to the palace and under
his direction the official Moniteur pub
lished a special number announcing
the formation of a regency council
composed of council and ministers
which will nominally hold the reins of
government until the heir to the throne.
Prince Albert, has taken the oath of
ascension. I
Gofflnet, private secretary to King
Leopold, who is greatly affected by tha
sudden termination of his majesty's ill
ness, described the scene at the palace,
"The king's body," said the baron,
"rests on his bed. His expression is
peaceful. All the household are in tears
gathered about the body. WTe have in
formed the ministers of the sad event."
The newspaper correspondents were
Dot permitted in the palace this morn
lag. It is said that Leopold's will consti
tutes a good sized volume.
The Princess Clementine and her sis
ter Stephanie, with the Countess of
FlanCcrs. left the palace at an early
hour. They were followed soon by his
majesty's intimate friend, Baroness
Vaughan.
Death of the King.
Brussels, Dec. 17. King Leopold of
Leopold II, Kim of Belgium, Wlio
Died This Morning.
Belgium died at 2:35 o'clock this morn
ing, his aged and wasted body being
unable to stand the strain put upon it.
The collapse occurred suddenly- and at
a moment when the doctors seemingly
had the greatest hopes for his recovery.
Throughout yesterday bulletins issued
from the sick room indicated progress
ive improvement. The bulletin posted
at 6;30 p. m. gave the king's tempera
ture, pulse and respiration practically
normal. Apparently the drainage of
L i iv- n wuini do iicxk, uu L. V. I nasi
present during the day,- the king had'
been able to take nourishment.
The public at large was satisfied th"5
king was on the road to recovery but
within the pavillion, where the king
lay "there -was a feeling of "anxiety
chiefly because of Leopold's great age.
- After a restful day the patient was
able to sleep for a brief period early in
the evening, and the night passed quiet
ly. But toward 2 o'clock alarming
symptoms appeared. Suddenly the king
turned and called to Dr. . Tiriar
J'Etouffe, "Doctuer J'Etouffe, I am suf
focating." Dr. De Page was summoned and the
two physicians did everything possible
to prolong life, but without avail.
The end came quickly and, after a
spell of weakness, peacefully.
Prince Albert Arrive.
Prince Albert arrived at the death
bed about 25 minutes later.
He was accompanied by Princess
Clementine. Albert kissed" the dead
king and left the chamber weeping.
Baron Gofflnet. the king's secretary,
started immediately for . Brussels to
notify the royal family.
Shortly after the end came, the min
isters were notified. The first official to
arrive at the death chamber Mvas the
royal chaplain. The ministers remained
in the chamber for a considerable time,
discussing in- subdued tones the sud
den death and matters of state.
The king's coolness and courage dur
ing the heroic struggle won the ad
miration of all, for at no time did he
seem to fear the result. Now that he
is dead it is believed he was able to
Burvive so long by the sheer force of his
mentclity. . .
When Gofflnet emerged from the high
walls of the royal gardens : his pale
face startled the newspaper correspond
ents who "were huddled together outside.
He paused for a . moment and said
solemnly, "The king .is dead."
The Belgian peoplo are heatedly occur
pied with the question as to the posi

household, as the result of a sensation

President of Nicaragua Tenders
Resignation
From the Presidency, in a Mes
sage to Congress.
TO STOP BLOODSHED
And Prevent Intervention hy
the United States.
Successor Will Be Chosen hy
. Legislative Body..
Managua, Nicaragua, ' Dec. 17.
President Zelaya last night cabled a
conciliatory message to President
Taft, saying that he had shown his
good faith by resigning in order that
Nicaragua . might resume friendly
relations with the L'nited States. He
added that he proposed to leave the
country, but stood ready to account
for his acts as president.
' Managua. Nicaragua, . Dec. 17. Jose
Santos Zelaya has resigned from the
presidency of Nicaragua. He has placed
his resignation- in the hands of con
gress- Apparently there was no other
course for him to take. The people were
at Jast aroused. . The guns of the rev
olutionists threatened, the warships of
the United States lay in Niearaguan
ports.
Managua has been seething for days.
The spirit of revolt has spread even to
the gates of the palace. Zelaya sur
rounded himself with an armed guard.
Unchecked, the populace have marched
through the streets crying for the end
of the old proclaiming the new regime.
Who will take up the reins no one
knows or cares. It is sufficient that
Zelaya as dictator will be known no
more. There is no doubt that congress
will act quickly on his resignation, for
the people have demanded it. Dr Jose
Madriz, Judge of the Central Ameri
can court of justice at Cartage, who
has. been close to Zelaya, and is now
his choice for president, is oh his way
here. He will arrive on Saturday.
Madriz had -hia following strong and in
fluential even among the revolutionists,
but General Estiada. under whose com
mand the great body of fighting insur
gents now face Vasquez's : troops at
Rama, will have none of him. Estrada's
word will bear weight in the choice of
president. Zelaya has known, too, that
Madriz is not acceptable to the United
States, and he has sought to learn who
would be looked upon with favor by
that government as . his successor, but
the American government so far as
can be learned, has named no man, and
the choice probably will lie with those
who lave gained the upper Tiaoid; .
;V An Act of Abnegation.
Accoivipariyinr his resignation, - Ze
laya sent the following message to con
press: . , -'
"The painXul circumstances . in which
the. country is plunged caii for acts of
abnegation and patriotism on the par
of the good citizens who are "the wit
nesses of the oppression of the repub
lic bv the heavy hand . of fate. The
country is staggering under a shame
less revolution which threatens the na
tion's sovereignty and a foreign nation
unjustly intervenes In our crisis pub
licly providing the rebels with arms,
which has only resulted in' their being
defeated everywhere through the hero
ism of our troops. '
"To avoid further bloodshed, and for
the reason that the revolutionists have
declared that they would put down
their arms when I surrendered the ex
ecutive power, I hereby place in the
hands of the national assembly the
abandonment of the remainder of my
term of office, which is to be filled by
a substitute of their choosing with the
hope that this- will result in good to
Nicaragua the. re-establishment of
peace and particularly the suspension
of the. hostilities of the United States
to which I do not wish to give a pre
text for intervention."
A commission of five deputies was
appointed to draft a bill looking to the
which is now considered a mere for
mality. News of the president's ac
tion spread throughout the city and
oon great crowds moved through the
streets, shouting for the United States
and Kstrada and the revolution. Held
in control for years by the strong hand
of Zelaya. the people have been quick
to break through restraint when it was
certain that the tlictator could not
breast the tide that has been rising
against him. During the latter days.
Zeiaya has resorted to all the known
tricks and contrivances to hold the peo
ple of Managua with him. Reports of
a; government victory at Rama have
been. frly circulated, and rumors that
a massacre of revolutionists had oc
curred were allowed to spread unchal
lenged and under.ied. It finally became
known that these were without a shred

Sheriff King, accompanied by Justice
Hugh Stewart, went to Latimer, a
small station, northwest of Council
Grove, on the Rock island, to in
vestigate a killing, wh)ch occurred
there Wednesday morning.
A Mexican working with a railroad
gang, was r accidentally; .Jcilled by a
fellow countryman who'.was handling

heart. The fact that :it -was purely
accidental was so evident that no ac

SHE COMES TO LIFE.
Miss XeUic Burns Had Been Declared
Legally Dead.
St. Louis, Dec. 17.--Miss Nellie
Burns missing for ' eleven years, and
declared legally dead three days ago
by the St. Louis circuit court, has
proved that the court' decree was
wrong. As a consequence the girl's
foster mother, Mrs. Annie Bosse, 4218
Lucky street, St. Louis, resigned let
ters of administration granted her by
the probate court and , caused to be
dismissed a suit in which she had al
ready won a Judgment against a life
insurance company.
The two women met today for the
first time since October. 18, 1898,
when Miss Burns disappeared on her
way to school. She was only 8 years
old then but Mrs. Bosse declared her
self satisfied as to the identity of the
young woman, i , .,
It had always been Bupposed by
Mrs. Bosse and the police that Nellie
had been kidnaped. Her story dis
proved this.
"I was on my way to school with
a girl about my own age." she said,
"when two men, my father and my
uncle, seized me and despite my kick
ing and screaming, placed me in a
buggy and drove to a house on Day
ton street. Father told me this was
to be my home and that .1 would never
see mother Bosse again-
"I grieved over, the change for a
time. then, like most, children forgot
my troubles'. A few years later, we
moved ' across the river to East St.
Louis and when I became older I went
to work in a department store." ;
The girl s father is Daniel Burns,
an engineer. He and his wife were
living apart when the latter died, di
recting that Nellie be given into the
care of Mrs. Bosse.. , . i
Both -Mrs. Burns and Mrs. Bosse
had taken out insurance policies on
the girl's life. These matured in 1905
but Mrs. Bosse ' waited - until a few
weeks ago before bringing suit In a
justice court . ;
She won this cas and the com
pany appealed. Monday Judcre With
row of the circuit court sustained
the finding of the lower tribunal, that
the eirl was dead.
Accounts of the case appeared in
th newspapers' nd thereupon' Miss
Burns's aunt telephoned to the com
pany's attorneys the, intelligence that
her niece " ras alive.. Affidavits - to
this effect were sworn to by her uncle
and bv Miss Burns herself.
TAFT GOES TO FUNERAL.
The Presulcnt'f Sister-ln-Law Died in
Baltimore Last Night.
Washington.Dec. 17. President Taft
left Washington this afternoon for
Watertown, Conn., where he will to
morrow attend .the funeral of Mrs.
Horace B. Taft. wife of his brother.
Mrs. Taft died last night in a hospital
at Baltimore. The president probably
will return to Washington Sunday-
morning. It is probable that the presi
dent will cancel nearly all social en
gagements for the White House for
some time to come.
The president was deeply grieved to
learn of the death of his sister-in-law,
although it was not entirely unexpect
ed. It was said formal announcement
of any changes that may be decided
upon in the social program at the
White House will be made after the
president returns to Washington Sun
day morning.
HER DIVORCE STANDS.
Mrs. Guggenheim's Petition to Annul
It Is Denied.
Chicago, Dec. 17. Judge Honore today
entered an order in the circuit court de
nying to Mrs. Grace B. Guggenheim the
right to file a petition asking that the
decree of divorce obtained by her in
1901, from William Guggenheim, one of
the Guggenheims of smelter fame, be
set aside.
The woman who married again short
ly after the decree was entered has
been seeking to have the decree an
nulled on the ground that it was ob
tained by fraud, she not having been a
citizen of Illinois when the case was
tried.
The attempt to annul the decree was
combated by counsel for William Gug
genheim, who also has married again.

MAY BE MURDER.
County Attorney Decides to In
vestigate Richards Deaths.
Bodies Will Be Exhumed and
Examination Made.
MYSTERY IN TRAGEDY.
Douht Whether Gas Could Have
Caused Deaths.
Coroner's Inquest May Be Held
Following Autopsy.
The suspicion entertained by County
Attorney J. J. Schenck and Sheriff J.
D. Norton that foul play figured in the
strange death of the Richards . family
last Sunday afternoon at the home at
1225 Lincoln street, has resulted in the
decision of the attorney to have the
bodies exhumed and a thorough post
mortem examination held under the
supervision of Coroner H. H. Keith.
The uncanny sight which met the
sight of Mrs. Thomas P. Richards, a
daughter of E. H. Hewins, when she
returned from a visit to her father's
house her husband lying at the foot
of a window, dead, his father, John P
Richards, sitting dead in a chair and
his mother lying dead in another room
cn the beck -and which- has- given her
nervous prostration, has- impelled the
officers to a more thorough investiga
tion. The deaths were readily attributed to
gas fumes and so plausibly that the
coroner decided that an inquest was
unnecessary. Yet there was a suspic
ion that the older Richards had been
robbed. That, too. was finally scouted,
however, and the matter was apparent
ly dropped. County Attorney Schenck
made the following statement:
"The case has been one of the most
peculiar on record and at first there did
not seem to be a suspicion as to any
thing criminal. Later developments, J
however, as various conjectures have
been thrown aside as improbable if not
impossible, make me believe there may
have ' been something criminal behind
the deaths and if that is true, we want
to know it by all means.
"I accuse nobody. It is possible I
never shall accuse anybody. But the
circumstances surrounding the death of
three grown persons in broad daylight
at their home in the city is so strange
and the manner of death has lacked
so much of a satisfactory explanation
that I believe the only thing to do will
be to exhume the bodies and subject
them to a severe examination."
One of the points seriously considered
as -discrediting the theory that death
resulted .frpm,. inhaling . gas fumes is
that the bodies when found had been
dead several hours. They ..were discov
ered by Mrs. Richards at 5:30 o'clock.
She had left all three well and uncom
plaining about noon. Hence if they had
been dead several hours they must
have expired shortly after she had
gone out.- Suppositions differ as to the
length of time in which gas fumed
would cause asphyxiation.
Many questions have arisen since the
tragedy in many minds and both Sheriff
Norton and Coroner Keith have been
plied with questions of those who are
not satisfied with the earlier decisions.
The thousands of people using gas for
fuel have also been questioning them
selves and friends concerning the ad
visability of continuing to do so.
"I can not believe," said the county
attorney, "that three persons in their
right minds should nave Deen asleep
in the middle of the day and that the
gas fumes should become so strong as
to asphyxiate them without any. of
them detecting the danger. The fumes
did not prevent Mrs. Richards from en
tering the rooms several hours later
when they should surely have been
much stronger. And why did not the
gas explode when Mrs, Richards struck
a match."
"An inquest will not be called," said
Sheriff Norton, "until after a thorough
examination of the bodies and their
Vital organs has been made and rea
sons found for such action. No specific
time has yet been set for exhuming the
bodies but it will likely be soon."
STILL IN A DEADLOCK.
No selection of National . League
President in Sight.
-New York, Dec. 17. The mag
nates of the National league were ap
parently in a complete deadlock to
day when they met again to select a
president, and Charles W. Murphy,
president of the Chicago club, ad
mitted his readiness. to sit all winter
if necessary to elect John M. Ward,
as the head of the organization.
New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and
Brooklyn presented today an un
broken front for the selection of
Ward, while Cincinnati. Pittsburg,
Boston and St. Louis were seeking to
elect Robert W. Brown of Louisville,
or some compromise candidate. As
suggested by Ward yesterday the
magnates 'will -likely become hope
lessly deadlocked and Mr. Heydler
will continue to-hold the office of
president while a board of three
regents would probably be appointed
to conduct the affairs of the league.
The move of Garry Herrmann in
bringing forward the name of Mr.
Brown for president yesterday instead
of Mr. Heydler was regarded today
as an extremely strategic one in
asmuch as it assured Mr Herrmann
and his friends the absolute support
of Stanley Robison, who favored
Mr. Brown. Mr. Herrmann Is now in
a position to ' offer the name of Mr.
Heydler as a compromise candidate.
Mr. Herrmann said today:
"You know - as much about' the
election as I do I think it a shame
that a good man like Heydler should
be thrown out of a job or,, if , he is
thrown out. not taken care of., The
present situation is ridiculous, because
we can not elect our board of direc
tors until after,; we have elected our
president."
Herrmann said he proposed to look
after Mr. Heydler in case he was not
elected. - .
As the day wore on - prospects, of a
break in the deadlock over the presi
dency did not improve. Statements of
some of the magnates made it look as
if each of the two sides to the contest
was more bitter than ever.
. Garry , Herrmann, president of the
Cincinnati club, declared . that an iron
clad agreement had been reached by
Brown's supporters not to vote for
Ward in any .circumstance.
"The Pittsburg, Boston. St. Louis and
Cincinnati clubs' representatives - have
pledged themselves not to vote for
Ward, whatever happens," said Herr
mann. "Ward can . not possibly be
elected." 4
"Then if his supporters stick togeth
er there . can be nothing but a dead
lock?" was suggested.
"That seems to be about the size of
it,'' replied Herrmann.
It was understood that the anti-Ward
men got together in conference to de
cide their future course. No one show
ed signs of weakening, and the adoption
of the pledge to stand pat against Ward
was cheerfully taken. . , - . .
Heydler's stock took a sudden boom
this afternoon when it became known
that the National league by-laws had
received an important amendment.
Finding themselves deadlocked over
the election of a president, the mem
bers yesterday voted that in the event
of a vacancy either In the presidency,
either from death, resignation or fail
ure to elect, the directors should be
empowered to name a president to act
until the league members should have
a chance to elect. Since the directors
of the league are Dovey of Boston,
Herrmann of Cincinnati, Dreyfus of
Pittsburg, Murphy of Chicago, and
Ebbetta of Brooklyn and the first
named three are Heydler men, it is
evident that If the meetine oroved
hopelessly deadlocked Heydler might
De cnosen as nis own "acting" suc
cessor, and would hold office in
definitely as long as the representa
tives of the eight clubs remain the
same and retain their present
opinions.

A Son of King Leopold and
Baroness Taughan
It Is Said Will Lay Claim to
Throne of Belgium.
IS FIVE YEARS OLD.
Bailiff Attempts to Seize Prop
erty of the Widow.
Attempt to Be Made to Drive
Her From the Country.
Brussels, Dec. 17. A contest over the
succession to the throne of Belgium is
possible. The Vatican is reported to
have confirmed the marriage a year
ago of King Leopold and Baroness
"Vaughan. Two sons are said to have
been born from this union and both
survive. The elder is Lucian. 5 years ;
old. It is reported he will claim the
throne. Prince Albert, the heir pre
sumptive, is a nephew of Leopold II.
The public was admitted to the'
mortuary chamber at 4 o'clock this
afternoon. The body lay in state for '
two hours before its removal to the
palace in Brussels. Thousands passed .
before the bier on the opposite side of'
which stood two officers and two nuns.
The newspaper correspondents also
were admitted to the room whose bare
walls and simple furnishings were in
marked contrast with the surroundings
which the occupant had enjoyed in life.
It is said a bailiff appeared today at -the
residence of Baroness Vaughan with
