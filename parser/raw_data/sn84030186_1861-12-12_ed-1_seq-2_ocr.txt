PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Tlfe annual Message of the President,
though short Tor such a document, is too
long for insertion, entiie, in our columns.
.We, however, prcseut below a synopsis of
its contents, with extracts relating to the
more important subjects which it discusses.
The President opens by the common cx
presions of gratitude to God for good
health and abundant harvest in the midst
of unprecedented political troubles. Our
amicable relations with foreign nations con
tinues undisturbed. Towards Foreign Pow
ers we have practiced liberality and pru
dence, avoiding all causes of irritation.
lie recommends the adoption of ample
measures for maintaining tho public de
fences on ctcry side, and especially our sea-
coast line. He also asks tho attention of
Congress to our great lakes and rivers, and
suggests the erection of some fortifications
and depots of arms and munitidns at well
selected points. He recommends the con
nection of East Tennessee and Western
North Carolina with Kentucky by railroad,
as a military measure. He suggests the es
tablishment of Consular Courts in eastern
countries, to adjudicate and dispose of cases
of recapture, by American sailing vessels,
of any piizes taken by pirates, of United
States vessels, if not objected to by the lo
cal authorities. The propiiety of acknowl
edging the independence aud sovereignity
of Hayti and Liberia is brought to the at
tention of Congress. The operations of -the
Treasury for the past fiscal year is referred
to. The patriotism of tli2 people, in plac
ing at the disposal of the Government the
large means demanded by the public exigen
cies, is commended, and gratification cs
prersed at the fact that the large expendi
tures made necessary by tho rebellion, are
not beyond the resources of the loyal peo
ple. The number of tioops who have ten
dered their services is beyond the force au
thorized by Congress. The organization of
the militia upon a uniform basis is earnestly
piescd upon the atteution of Congress.
Attention is called to the reports of the
Secretary of State and the Postmaster Gen
eial. He refers to the acanciesin tho Su
it i? now definitely asceitained in mili- Preine Couit, and urges at some length the
tary ciicles at Washington, that Boaurenurd
recently tendered his resignation as a Gen
eral in the rebsl army, in consequence of
his difference with Jeff. Davis, as to the
conduct of the war. Violent parties have
sprung up among the Confcdeiates on this
question, Beauregard representing the of
fensive war party, who believe in invading
the. North and win'oring in Baltimore",
Philadelphia, and Now York, and Jeff.
Davis representing tho defensive war paitv,
who trust to time and patient defense of
their own soil to give them independence.
The Beauregard party complain that tho
jolicy of Davis has led to the invasion of
-outa Uiroitua, aud will fill tho Cotton come forfeited, and numbers of the latter
ites with tho horrors of war. and end in thus libeiatcd are already denendenfcnn tbn

be most eagerly looked for is that" referring
to the rebellion. "We give that entire :
Th tough the Secretaries of State and
Inteiior, a plan or system has been devised,
and partly matured, which will be laid
before you, and by irtue of tho net of
Congress, entitled, " An Act. to Confiscate
Pioperty used for Insurrectionary Pur-
coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however,
placed the importance of securing Louisi
ana more on political than commercial
grounds, than on provided loom, for popu-
iation. Including tho appropriation of
money with the acquisition of territory,
does not the expediency amount to absolute
necessity, without which Goernnient can
not be perpetual ?
In considering the policy to be adopted
for the suppression of the insurrection, I
have been jfnxious and careful, that the
inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not
degenerate into a violent aud remorseless
revolutionary struggle. I have, therefore,
thought proper to keep the integrity of the
Union prominent, as the primary object of
tho contest on our part, leaving all ques
tions which are not of vital importance to
the more deliberate action of the Legisla
ture. In the exercise of my best discretion
I have adhered to a blockade of the ports
held by the insurgents, instead of putting
in force by a proclamation the law of Con
gress, enacted at the late session for closing
the ports; also, obeying the dictates of
prudence as well as the obligations of law,
instead of transcending. I have adhered to
the act of Congress to confiscate property
used for insurrectionary purposes. If a
new law upon the same .subject shall be
proposed, its propriety will be duly con-,
sidered. The Union must bo preserved,
and hence ail defensible means be employed.
We should not be iu haste to determine
what radical and extreme measures, which
may reach the loyal as well as tho disloyal,
are indispensable. The inaugural address,
at the beginning of the administration, aud
the message to Congress at the last special
session, were both mainly devoted to the
domestic controversy, at one of which, the
insurrection and consequent war have
sprung. Nothing new occurs to add or sub
tract from the principles or general purposes
stated and expressed in those documents.1
The last ray of hope for preserving the Un
ion peaceably expired at the" assault on
hort bumter, and a general review ot what
has occurred since may not be unprofitable.
What was paiu fully uncertain then, is much
better defined and more distinct now, and
the progress of events is plainly in the
right direction. The insurgents confidently
claimed a strong support fiom North of Ma
son and Dixon's line, and the friends of the
Union were not free from apprehension on
this point. This, however, was soon settled
definitely on the right side. South of the
line," nobic little Delaware vent off right
from the first. Maryland made to seem
against the Union; our soldiers were as
saulted, bridges were burned, and railroads
torn up within her limits, and we were
many days at one time without the ability
to bring a single regiment over her soil to
the Capital, ii'ow her bridges and rail
roads arc repaired and opened to the Gov
ernment. She already gives seven regi
ments to the cause of the Union, and none
to the enemy ; and her people, at a regular
election, have sustained the Union by a
large majority, and a larger aggregato vote
than they ever before gave to any candidate
on any question.
Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt,
is now decidedly and unchangeably ranged
on the side of the Union. Missouri is com
paratively quiet, and, I believe, cannot
again be over-run by the insurgents.
These three States of Maryland, Kentucky
and Missouri, neither of which would
promise a single soldier tit first, have now
an aggregate of not less than 40,000 sol
dicisin the field for the Union, while of
their citizens not more than a third in num
ber are among the insurgents, and they of
doubtful whereabouts. After a somewhat
gloomy stiuggle, the months of winter
closed upon the Union people of Western
Viigiuia,-leaving them masters of their own
country. An insurgent force of about
l,oOO for months dominating the narrow,
peninsular region constituting the counties
of Accomac and Northampton, and known
as the " Eastern Shore" of Virginia, to
gether with some contiguous parts of Mary
iand, have laid down their arms, and the
people there have renewed their allegiance
to, and accepted the protection of, the liar

The Naval Department has sent in,the
ake of the great fleet whioh opened the
outh Carolina oyster, and is now, prob-
oly, penetrated to the meat of tho Georgia
Mncea, a most novel armament for Ocean
v.-nfare. It consists of thirty vessels, some
jf which arc the largest tized whalers, all
jaded with rock. It is not intended to
lurl these missiles at the rebels, but 'they
are sent down with the purpose of assisting

.that some of the States will pass similar
enactments for their Own benefit, irrespec
tive of the operation of which persons of

mend tuat Congress, for accepting such
persons from sucfi States, accordiug to some
mode of aluation, in iieu of pro rate or
direct taxes, or upou ome other plan "to be
agreed upon with such States respectively;
that such persons, on such acceptance by
the General Government, be at oace deem

taken for colonizing both classes, or tho
one first meutioncd, if the other should not
be hi ought into existence, at some place
or pluces in a climate congenial to them.
lit might be well to consider, too, whether
tne tree colored people already in. the Uni-
ltu oiaiL-s, couiu not, so iar as maiviauais
may desire, be included in such colonisa
tion. To Carry out tho. nlnn nf nnlnniznlinn
ilso, we have obtained a footing at each of
the isolated points on the southern coact of
Hattcras, Port lloyal and Tyhce Island, and
we likewise have some genera! accounts of
popular movements on behalf of the Union
men in North Carolina and Tennessee.
These things demonstrate that the cause of
the-Union is advancing steadily southward.
After referring to the retirement of Gen.
Scotr, and suggesting the propriety of some
acknowledgement of the long and faithful
services of that distinguished patriot, the
President concludes his ilessage with a dis
cussion of the relations of capital and
labor.
such a generation can congregate it. these
poiuts, aud enjoy their much loved life of
repined leisure, while the hard fisted clod
hoppers from the land of baked beans and
pumpkin pies, nud liberty, can open such
glorious marts as Port Koyal, and do the

EDITORIAL CORRESPONDENCE.
Lawrence, Kan-.; Dec. 7th, 1861,
Dear Union : Owing to the many
pressing affairs of business which have oc
cupied my time since leaving the fair cily of
Junction, I have been unable to "write you.
This morning, for the first time since my
departure I am possessed of leisure sufficient
to allow of writing a letter, and all I need
is the material out of which to manufacture
the missive. No incident has occured as
yet to mar the pleasure of my trip, or fur
nish an item for your readers.
At Topeka; the people were in excellent
spirits over their success in getting the
Capital. The time intervening since this
grand acquisition, has, of coursebeen too
limited to admit of improvements, though
we observed preparations making by many
for building. The grass which has been so
lono- undisturbed, is now trodden down in
the principal street, and the " lowing herd"
are compelled to find grazing far out in tho
suburbs of the city. ,A plain dirt road has
been marked out through the town, and ef
forts are making to extend it beyond the
city limits. Visitors will not find it diffi
cult to get in or out of the Capital, provid
ing they've got no money.
Already a first-class saloon has been es
tablished there, and rumor was current that
a blacksmith shop would soon be opened.
The benefits derived from this last men
tioned enterprise, it is presumed will be in
calculable. Should the State fail in getting
money to buy boots for the Legislature, it
is proposed to have them shod at the " new
blacksmith shop:" The " new minister"
has arrived there. lie came in on " boss
back," and is reported as favorably impress
ed with the condition of things, which in
cludes salary and perquisites. Jake Smith
keeps tho finest Tinshop in Topeka, He
takes all kinds of rags in exchange for
goods, excepting Lawrence bank bills. By,
way of a joke, Jake says he prefers ' his
own tin." As an inducement to the trade
in Western Kansas, Jake offers to trust
every man in that section. Kellam Bros,
have been erecting a fine brick structure on
the sun-set side of the dirt road. Their in
creasing drug business has made this rash
step necessary. The new establishment is
" bigger'n all out doors." The newspapers
are making a ,s live." At the Tribune we
found matters getting on swimmingly.
Cummings is getting fat and Shepard 'aint.
Hut both arc fast becoming immensely
rich. Cummings has been building a new
dog-kcnncl, and bought a fresh plug of nail
rod the day before I arrived. " Shep" talks
insanely about enlarging the Tribune some
time' within the present kcentury. A new
subscriber has been awarded them by the
City Council for their tremendous services
in securing the Capital at Topeka. This
makes their total subscription twenty-nine.
Ptoss of tho llecord is taking a breathing
spell. He over-exerted himself during the
campaign, and wants four weeks to recuper
ate. Shouldn't wonder if some of his de
linquent subscribers could facilitate his re
cuperation. We found Lawrence "all our fancy paint
ed her." If there is a beautiful Doiufc in
Kansas, this is it. Real Estate i3 selling
here for higher prices than is realized for
second-rate Junction property. Missouri
refugees of a sable hue aro very abundant.
Tho Journal still breathes, or blows at
least, Trask does. As was feared by the
people here, the Republican survives the
defeat of Speer for the Senate, The EI
dridge House still continues to be the best
hotel in America. - This house has been
newly renovated, and every door has been
ornamented, so report says, with a magnifi-
cient gilt lettered placard, set iu gutta-percha
frames, announcing the pleasing intelli
gence that " old man trust is played sut en
tirely." The Eighth Beg. Kan. Vol. are
stationed here, under Col. Wessel, which
gives the city quite a martial appearance.
Our old townsman, the Hon. J. B. Wood
warh, now Surgeon of the Kansas Eighth,
is lying on his back at the Eldridge, suffer
ing from a severe hurt in his leg, caused by
falling up or down stairs when he wag -sober.
He will recover, in time.
Winter has made himself felt hereabouts.
Four inches of snow fell three or four days
ago ; but at the present writing has entire
ly disappeared, leaving mother Earth in a
very moist and disagreeable condition.
I intend to visit Leavenworth as soon as
I can " catch a ride," at which place you
shall hear from me again. In the mean
time may I hope that " though absent I am
not forgotten." Yours, in the enjoyment
of excellent health and plenty of the "evil
root," KING.
PATIENCE.
History is full of lessons of patience.
Here are some reminiscences reproduced
from the Journal des Debates, a lcadiug
Parisisn paper, which may be profitably re
called by such of our countrymen a' are
confessing in querulous tones to a feeling of
impatience at the delay which attends our
military operations, on the Potomac :
"The Americans began the war with
England in 1812 in a deplorable way.
lhe first army which they put into the field
made a disgraceful capitulation. But they
ended it in January, 1815, by a nngnifi
cient triumph, tho victorv of New Orleans.
It was thus that Peter the Great, after de
feat upon defeat, finally succeeded, at Pul
towa, in destroyiug his conquerera. the
Swedes. It was thus that the soldiers of
the French Revolution, who were very poor
soldiers at the outset, became by experi
ence the heroes of Fleurus, of Rivoli, of
the Pyramids and of Zurich. Nor can we
see any reason why it should not be thus
also with the North Ameiicans in the war
of which the year 1SG1 has seen the commencement."
HOME DANGEH.
We called attention, yesterday, to the ex
posed coudition of our river border. One
of the dangers predicted then has since
happened. The river is bridged with ice.
To-night a marauding band from Missouri
may dash into this city while we aro asleep
in fancied security, burn fifty buildings, de
stroy a half million dollars worth of prop
erty ; and escapingi)ack into Missouri, scat
ter among the jungles on the opposite side,
secure and out of harm's way, from any
force that may pursue. We don't say that
this will happen, but the ftrobabilities are
that it may happen before tho river opon3.
We must remember that we are ia a state
of war, aud what is worse, civil war. Iu
such times, the borders alwa3's suffer most.
The destruction of Leavenworth would off
set Osceola. This is talked of on the other
side. What is to hinder a band of bold,
resolute men, from dashing over here at
midnighr, and setting fire to the business
portion of the city. We have no guards
out at night ; no pickets to give timely
warning. We have the aiders aud abettors
of rebellion in our midst, many of them
having no interest whatever with us. Half
an hour's work in a well concerted plan, on
a favorable night, and amid the terrors of
such a scene, might lay (he larger portion
of the city in ruins,.
The military authorities are using great
exertions to meet the emergency ; but it
must be borne in mind that at present they
have a very small force with which to guard
our extended border.
In view of these facts, our citizens should
take immediate steps towards a patrol force
or system of picket guards, by which everj
avenue of approach may bo thoroughly
guarded, and timely warning given of any
hostile demonstration. And thus co-operating
with the forces at the Fort, we will be
perfectly secure; otherwise the danger is
constant. Leav. Times.
GEN.DXNVER.
It will be seen by order No. 2, that Gen
Hunter has assigned fcen. Denver to com
mand all the forces in Kansas.
We have great confidence in Gen. Den
ver, as a man and a soldier. Ho has that
essential quality in military matters of
keeping his own counsels. If he does not
go about making stump speeches in every
town which he enters, we shall have none
the less confidence in him for that. "We be
lieve that while he is in the service he will
be a true soldier, and devote himself solely
to military purposes. Wo like tho appoint
ment. Gen. Hunter has shown good sense
in making it. We have confidence that our
soldiery will now be put on a real war
basis.

Price and Hi Army.
Price is encamped a short disfance below
Osceola with about 12,000 men, and is iQ
no condition to move. His men are poorly
clad and have not half tho tents they need.
The result is a greater amount of sickness
than was ever known in a camp of that
size. In a proclamation published by him
on tho 22d of November, he says he has
lost three men by sickness where he has
lost one by bullets. That proclamation is a
most painful and humiliating appeal for
help. He asks for fifty thousand men, and
a dozen time3 over the demand is reiterated.
He says boys have done the fighting while
men of vigor and wealth have remained
safely at home, and says the cause is lost
unless he can have more and better aid.
In short Price is despondent, and if Hun
ter and Halleck half do their duty he can
be speedily played out. Vor. Leav. Con.

Soldiers Sending Money Home. The
amount of money sent home by soldiers in
the field, to their families, is very remarka
ble. Paymaster Pangborn arrived day be
fore yesterday from Port Ptoyal, iu charge
of remittances from the army in that neigh
borhood. We understand that of 5400,
000 disbursed there, over 250,000 was
sent at once by the soldiers to their fami
lies. Fourteen large mail bag3 were dis
patched for that purpose, containing over
14,000 letters. Surgeon Stone, of the
Tammany Regiment, arrived yesterday,
bringing 11,000 from the men of that reg
iment alone to their families in this city.
The money is enclosed in an envelope, "and
directed to the person for whom it is intend
ed the amount being certified by the
proper officer. -Ar. Y. Times.
