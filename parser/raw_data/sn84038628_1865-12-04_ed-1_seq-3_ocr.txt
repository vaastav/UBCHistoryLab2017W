have laid up for the season. The New Bos
ton went into winter quarters at our boat
yard, on Friday. The Keithsburg has laid
up at Fort Madison. The weather is still very
nne, no ice, and boats could make their trips
wuiiout obstruction. But the owners think
it filter to lay up, as bad weather may cotue,

Stw Drug Store. Mr. Speidel has open

old friends and the public generally. He
has a very neat and tastefully arranged
store, a fine stock of goods, and will careful
ly devote his attention to the wants of tbe
public. An excellent chemist himself he
will Day particular and personal attention to
compounding physicians' prescriptions, and
feels confident that be can give entire satis
faction in that line. We see no reason why
Mr. Speidel ahdbld not do a good business.

New Firm at the Paper Mill, Messrs
Ilutchins & Curtis Lav? leased tbe paper
mill, in thin city, for three years, and are
notr at work. They have purchased and set
in operation a printing press, upon which
they will print, to order, 16 different sizes of
small bags for grocers' use and will print,
to order, wrapping paper, of all sizes and for
all purposes, all upon paper and bags of
their own make. They hope, ere long, to
commence the manufacture of printing paper
but at present will run excluaevely ou wrap
ping. We heartily welcome these gentlemen to
our city, and trust that they will find their
business botb pleasant and profitable.
Democratic Club. There was a good
meeting Saturday evening, and tbe proposed
amendments to the constitution and by-laws
were unanimously adopted.
Committees were appointed to raise money
to pay the rent of the hall for another year in
advance the time to which the rent is now
paid expiring on the 17th of the present
nionth.
Tbe club adjourned to Satu.day evening
the lGth inst., when the committees will re
port. It is hoped that democrats will sub
scribe lihnrallv. for we need, in addition to
the rent, funds to purchase some decorations
fur the hall pictures of distingusbed demo
cratic statesmen, &c, &c.
The Moral Centex. By reference to the
buge advertisement of Devoe & Crampton, it
be seen that a very interesting corres
pondence has taken place between sundry
distinguished individuals upon the subject of
a "pome" in regard to Devoe & Crampton's
book store. A man of tbe keen observation
of Tayard Baylor, Esq., could not fail to see
that Devoe & Crampton keep everything in
the line of books, stationary, toys, wall pa
per, pictures, albums, fancy articles of all
kinds &c, &c, and if you want anything in
that line Devoe & Crampton's is the place to
go for it. Read the whole column down, from
top to bottom it cannot fail to interest you,
and induce you to viwit their store and in
epect their goods. It is a good time, aow, to
be looking out presents you are expected to
make during the holidays.

The N. Y. Ileaall's Sunday correspondent

The house will meet at the usual hour ind go

At noon Mr McPhersou.cIerk proceeded to call
as required by law the roll of the members elect.
While it was being called MrMaynard, oi Ten
nessee, whose name bad not been placed on the
roll, rose and wanted to suggest something, but
the clerk refused to be interrupted. After the
call was completed Mr Msynard again rose to
speak but the clerk again ruled him out of order
One hundred and seventy-five members answer
ed to thir names.
Mr. James Brooks, of New York, made a speech
characterizing the omission ot the names ot the
members from Tennessee from the roll as unpre
cedented, unjust and totally uncalled for He said
if Mr Mayaard was not a loyal man from a union
and loyal state then tbe president of the United
Slates was not a loyal man but an allien and a
stranger.
He charged that tbe adontion of the resolution
excluding the souahern members from this house
by the republican caucus was designed as antag
onistic to the president's forthcoming message.
The house took no action on the subject, but
under the operation ot the previous question pro
ceeded to the election of a sneaker. Hon. Schuy
