Egr-OFFICIAL PAFEB OF HKNBT COUNTY
NAPOLEON, O.,
DEO. 1, 18.
Governor Hoadly is at work on his
annual message.
A factory at Youngstown, Ohio, is
engaged in making nickel-plated shing
les for the New Orleans exposition.
The electors of each State met yester
day and cast their ballots for President
and Vice President of the United States.
President-elect Cleveland has
promised to abolish the office of barber
at the White House which was created
by Grant.
Blaine takes his defeat cheerfully.
Ilepublican.
Yes, as cheerful as a spanked baby.
Wayne Co. Dem.
President Arthur, widower, and
President Cleveland, bachelor, going
arm-in-arm about the capital, will be a
spectacle for all the ladies.
In the event of Hon. Henry B. Payne
being placed in Cleveland's cabinet, the
Wood County Democrat booms John
It. McLean,1 of the Cincinnati Enquirer,
for the Senatorial vacancy. ;
The kind of ci vil service reform we
are ia favor of Is just this: We are will
itg'ttx keep as many Republicans in
oflloo-as there .were Democrats kept in
offloebythe Republicans. That's fair,
isn't it? If not, why not? Zanesville
Signal. ' '
Hhe Sandusky City Local, heretofore
a independent paper, has come out
squarely and declared its intention
hereafter to champion the cause of
Democracy, and makes its bow "as a
Democratic newspaper, not in word but
la deed.".
Postoffiok holding Republican edi
tors speak of the incoming Democratic
administration as the "Confederate"
administration, and yet propose to hold
their offices for the periods for which
they wereappointed,"under the tenure"
of the Civil Service law. How patriotic!
It is strongly hinted that Gov. Hoad
ly does not desire a re-nomination for
Governor In 1885. ; The Immense
amount of campaign racket in a great
State like Ohio is not congenial to his
Keryous system. The Governor is not
overpleased with the dull routine of
official duties which tie him up all the
year, round in a dull, dusty old burg
liite-Gblumbus. Sunday Journal.
The corner-stone of the Washington
monument was laid during President
Polk's administration, when the De
mocracy had just been returned to
flower. Work was resumed upon the
structure in 1878, when Samuel J. Til
den was elected and will not be com
pleted until Grover Cleveland is presi
dent. Hence It is a monument to the
Democracy as well as to Washington.
A spiritualistic crank named Geo,
Burris, weighing two hundred pounds,
tried to cure Mrs. Sarah Walker, near
ML Vernon, of inflammation of the
bowels, by kneeling upon her stomach,
and pounding her head, face, spine and
hips. This treatment was for the pur
pose of driving out of her body the
spirit of a devlish nelghbor,Dick Lybar
ger, recently deceased, but it killed the
patient. It is said the cr&nk Is crazy,
and if ho isn't he should bo strung up
tar murder.
Only 30 hungry Democrats want the
Napoleon Port Offloe and 88 of the
ravenou gang will weep and wall and
swear they were more entitled to it
than the fellow who gets It.
', The above and similar squibs are go
ing the rounds of the Republican press
of the Northwest, and a teeming de
light is taken in classing Democrats as
thV'ra venous gang." While there might
be a half dozen applicants for the posi
tion named, which is no moro than
right and proper, yet Democrats are
not such for mere greed of office. They
are Democrats from principal, or else
their organization would have went to
flinders long ere this. But our Repub
lican friends are judging others by them
selves. They have been bo long in
office that It has become a second nu
ture to them, and they have sacrificed
every principle they ever possessed to
retain their grip upon the purse-strings
of Uncle 8am. The people have wrench
ed It from them and oh how they wail
and howl.
The distress In the Hocking Valley
mining regions appeals not only to the
sympathy and charity of the people,
but to the business sense of business
men and the common sense of working
men. There ought to be a speedy ad
justment of the differences between t
operators and miners, and an early re
sumption of business. If it is possible
to make concessions on both sides, and
arrive at an understanding by which a
picture of desolation may be changed
to a scene of industry and prosperity,
no time should be lost in movements
toward such a change. Each side
maintaining a dogged, immovable
position will protract' tho miserable
spectacle beyond toleration in public
sentiment. The miners can not get
work under present circumstances In
the valley, and can not move away.
They are even "pinched" for the bare
necessities of life. They constitute a
factor which can not be ignored, what
ever course the operators may under
take to pursue. Hasn't each side ex
hibited its staying qualities long en
ough? Isn't the cheapest way, the fair
est way, and the most business-like way,
to get together in a conference in which
each side will be sincere, and In which
nobody is to stumble oVer quibbles and
technicalities? Enquirer.
Perhaps many of our citizens will
visit the great New Orleans Exposition
during the next six months, and will of
course be interested in the exhibit of
Ohio products. Prominent among the
various exhibits made by the Buckeye
State will be that of agricultural pro
ducts, which will be displayed upon an
immense pagoda, built at Columbus,
and shipped this week to New Orleans,
occupying three cars for its transporta
tion. It is an immense affair, and in
both design and ornamentation it is a
model of, art,- The following descrip
tion will give some idea of it: It is 90
feet long, 30 feet wide and the main
part 14 feet long. The arches and
dome will of course rise higher, the for
mer being 25 feet from the base. The
main part will be supported by columns
ten on each side. Running along over
the top of the columns will be a hand
some frieze. At each side will be an
entrance, and over each an arch. With
in the arch will be a triangle contain
ing the word "Ohio." The farm pro
ducts will be arranged in shelves in re
treating step-ladder form against the
pillars at the sides, but not touching
them.. The structure will be placed
within the main building.
The Republican party may not be
dead, but the chances are that it will
never again appear as a leading factor
in a Presidential contest. The past four
years have been sad ones for the "grand
old party." It has declined so rapidly
that the day and the hour of its final
extinction seems not to be distant. In
every State in the Union, except Penn
sylvania, California and Neveda its vote
has decreased to an extent that should
alarm the leaders. Iowa, long the
"banner State" of Republicanism, has
reduced her majority from 78,000 for
Garfield to 19,000 for Blaine. Illinois
gave Garfield over 50,000 majority, and
Blaine but 14,000. Wisconsin gave Gar
field over 30,000 majority, and Blaine
but 9,000. Garfield's majority in Mich
igan was over 50,000; this was wholly
wiped out, and Blaine received a plu
rality of 3,812. In Indiana the plurali
ty of 6,000 for Garfield was changed to a
Democratic plurality of 6,000. The
same monotonous story can be told of
nearly every State from Massachusetts
to Texas and from Minnesota to Flori
da. The Republican party, permeated
with corruption and honey-combed
with rottenness, has lost the confidence
of the people. A 4
, Some persons think that the sign
boards forbidding hunting, fishing, nut
gathering or trespassing upon private
lands are of little account, and that
tbey may be disregarded with impunl
ty. This is a mistake, as tho law makes
it an act of trespass to go upon any cul
tivated or enclosed land for any purpose
without permission from the owner,
even if there is no sign board, and the
owner is entitled to recover actual
damage for such trespass. When the
signboards are properly erected, any
person who trespasses upon land so
guarded Is not only liable to pay the
actual damages, but also a penalty not
exceeding $25.
The Ohio Stato Democratic Club is
making arrangements to properly cele
brate St. Jackson's Day, January, 8th,
at Columbus, the date of the first an
nual meeting of the club. .
Good-Bye, My Lovers, Good-Bye!
The following ticket accounts for the
absence of so many of our citizens, they
seem to have been distributed broadcast
in this vicinity. We hope the "Jim
Blaine" will have a successful voyage.
We understand there Is to be a grand
Re-Union of the Mulligan Guards,, and
their greatest Generals are billed to be
present to greet the gathered millions,

Civil Service Laws.
Much has been said of the civil ser
vice lately for the consolation (if there
be any) of the dethroned party. The
impression pretty generally prevails
that under the law the Republican
government officials will have Just as
secure hold on their places as they have
before the change of administration.
The fact is that only about one-tenth
are protected by the civil service law
and probably every one of the other
nine-tenths have laid themselves liable
to expulsion under the provisions of
that law which they looked to for pro
tection from the Democratic broom..
The civil service law forbids govern
ment employes paying political assess
ments, joining campaign associations
or making themselves conspicuous in
party work, and employes doing any or
all of these things can be lawfully re
moved. There is scarcely a man in the
employment of the Government who
did not participate with clubs or pay
political assessments to secure the elec
tion of Blaine. The civil service law
that the Republicans claim to be so in
love with seems to favor a tolerably
clean sweep.
The President's Message was read to
Congress on Monday. The document
contains about the usual matter found
in like papers, and is probably as good
as any of Its predecessors. It contains
the usual recommendations and sug
gestions, and is most remarkable for its
being tho farewell of the last Republi
can President.

Deo.20th, ISM.
P. MEKK1SON,
dee 4-3t 1891. Probate Judge,
The plague In tho Southern part of
West Virginia and In Eastern Kentucky
Is attracting general attention. Accord
ing to tho best authenticated reports the
centre of the afflicted district la In the
centro of Dickinson county, Virginia,.
In the midst of tho Cumberland moun
tains, and over one hundred miles from
the nearest railway station. The great
est destitution prevails and the cold
weather is sure to cause such a state of
mortality as even the present state of
affairs has not begun to equal. The
last rainfall was on August 3, unless It
has fallen within a week. Business is
at a standstill. Crops are a failure.
Many families have not a bushel of
grain nor a head of live stock left.
Medicines are exhausted, and physic
ians are nearly all dead from overwork.
Corpses lie Tor days unburied. In many
Instances water is carried three and
four miles 'in buckets. There is no
running water left, that which is used
being found In pools in the deeper holes
in creek bottoms. Louis river has not
sufficient water in it to flout a chip,
save in pools. The fish are dead by
tons. Indeed, it U asserted that there
is not a live fish in six or -teven counties.
As the water evaporated, that which
was left naturally retained all the salts
and minerals. It is believed that drink
ing this water produced the disease.
The disease is not contagious. The
patient is seized with vertigo, heavy
fever, complete unconsciousness, with
Involuntary discharges much colored
with blood. Death ensues in about ten
hours, the victim suffering Intensely.
Animals suffer the same symptoms as
men. Mr. W. C. Lester, a prominent
attorney of Williamsburg, Ky., visited
a county in the mountains, in the
neighborhood of the prevailing disease.
He says that "no one seemed to know
the exact nature of the pestilence. Most
of the people called it "flux," and It is
probable an aggravated form of that dis
ease. It begins with griping pains in
the stomach, followed by a debilitating
diarrhoea aud swelling of the throat,
and if not fatal In three or four days
the patient as a rule recovers. All re
ports agree as to the cause of the epi
demic, it being attributed to the use of
impure water by the natives. The sea
son has been unusually dry."

Invisible Architecture in a New Eng
land Parsonage.
"Yes," the said, "our ehlldrcn are married and
gone, andmy bu.band and I ait by our winter Bre
much as we did before the little ones came to widen
the circle. Life is something like a spiral s'alroase;
we are all the time coming around over the tpot w
started from, only ouc degree further np the atalre."
That la a pretty Illustration," remarked her
friend, musingly, gating into the glowing coals
which radiated a pleasant heat f.-otn tho inauy-wln-dowed
stove. "You know wecronot stop toiling up
the hilL though."
"Surely we cannot, and for myself 'I don't Sad
fault with that necesaltr' provided the advance in
life ianot attended with ealamitr or suffering, for I
have had my share of that. Not loug since my
health utterly broke down. Mr system was full of
maiana. Jiy digestion neeame innrongny disor
dered and my nerves were in a wretched atate. I was
languid, ate little and that without eujoylug It, and
had no strength or ambition to perform even my
lrght household duties. Medical treatment failed to
reach the aeat of the irouhle. The disease which
seemed to be weakuese ot all the vital organs pro
gressed until I had several attack rl'c!i my Dbysi-
olana pronounced, to be aouta coaseevlju of the
stomacn. t oe last 01 inee was a aetwuraie strug
gle and I was given np to die. As the crisis had par
tially passed, my husband heard ot the merits of
PABKEU'8 TON IO as an lnvignraut iu lust such
cases as mine, I took it aud felt its good effects at
once. It appeared to-pervade my body, as though
the blessingof new lire had come to me. Taking no
other medicine I continued to Improve, and am now
in better health than I have been for a lone time.
