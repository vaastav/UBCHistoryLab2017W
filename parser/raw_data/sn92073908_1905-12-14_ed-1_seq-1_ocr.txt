Dr.
Miles' Heart Cure
Effected Cure.
Heart disease is curable, but in people of
a ivanced age it does not readily lend ttselt
to ordinary treatment There is, however,
hope for all sufferers in Dr. Miles Heart
Cure, which we know from watching hun
dr"ds of cases and from the letters of grateful
suffere s, will cure where all else has failed.
It is not only a wonderful cure for weak and
diseased hearts, but it is a blood tonic, a reg
t!a:or of the heart's action and the most
effective treatment ever formulated for im
proving the circulation of the blood.
' During the Civil war I contracted heart
di-ease, and in 1896, while living in the grand
old town of Lexington, Va-, I grew so much
wc rse, I left there with my wife to visit my
? MT-in law, Mrs. T. A. Kirby, at Roanoke,
Va. While I said nothing to anyone I never
ex; ected to live to return to the dear old

cured a few bottles of it, al o the Nervine

cou'. 1 fee no improvement, and I despaired
of tver being better, bat my faithful wife in
si. on keeping it up, which I did. Im
pr jvment soon began in earnest and I took
in ; !i ufteen or sixteen bottles. I was re
st ored to perfect health and while I mr70

OBSERVATIONS OF
The two most notable gatherings in the State for some time were the
North Carolina Methodist Conference at Wilson two weeks ago and the
Two Notable Gatherings. Bapti8t state Coavention ,n week
. ago. At both of these gatherings there were
fine and encouraging reports of the work done in the State this year by
these two great religious denominations. The citizenship of the State can
compile no index which will eyen suggest the power for good to all the
people there is in the work of the ministers and laymen in the churches of
all denominations. Eyery man in the State ought to be glad to help sup
port the churches about him whether he has any experimental knowledge
of religion or whether he simply gives assent to its claims upon men.
Without the power of churches our civilization would be a misnomer and
would count for naught.

Many persons in discussing the cotton situation, under the fluctuating
and uncertain prices, such as have prevailed this season and which pre
Uniform Prices.
they say, that the farmer should be able to make reasonably accurate
calculation at planting time what he may expect to get for bis cotton the
next fall.. The correctness and wisdom of this view any one can see at a
glance ; and perhaps every farmer would be glad to see such conditions pre
vail. They do say, also, that the spinners and manufacturers would be
glad to see the same conditions. This would enable the farmers to act
with greater wisdom and prudence in the employing of labor and in the
purchasing of fertilizsrs, and it would also enable the manufacturer to
place his contracts for outputs with more confidence and intelligence.
The speculator might be put out of a job, or the profits to his job might be
lowered, but cf this the farmer would take little note.

In these flush times with the farmers, people in the towns begin to think
about what will bring prosperity to them also. One of the surest ways for
Prosperity to a Town.
mand. This is what farmers are doing. They are producing cotton and
peanuts and tobacco, ehickens and eggs and turkeys, and other things for
which there is a demand. The prosperous towns In JSorth Carolina are the
manufacturing towns, and not those towns that depend upon buying things
from one person and selling them to another. Of course this is done in all
towns, but It is not what brings prosperity. Towns like Charlotte, Greens
boro and High Point, which make things, are the towns that know noth
ing about dull days and hard times. Of course almost any town can now
and then have a period of thrift on the simple commerce of the people, .
but this does not last, unless it has some exceptional advantage in freight
rates, trucking or the like. The towns that are prosperous year in and
year out are the towns that make things, let us say again.

Tub President's message to congress was quite lengthly filling twenty
columns of closely set matter in a newspaper. It is a most readable paper
and deals with perhaps every impoitant subject
Che President's Message. fhe merlcan Congre58. Pre8ident
Roosevelt is a master of English and all his papers aro. attractive in style
and expression. Some able men could have discussed the same subjects
with equal clearness, perhaps, in much shorter space. To many the read
in; of such a long message might seem a task, but to one who feels a real
interest in the affairs of the country the reading of the meesage could hard
ly ba called tiresome. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the message
is what the President has to say about railroads and raiiroad rates. This
discussion be brings under the general, head of corporations. He thinks
that proper industrial conditions both for individuals and corporations
should be secured by ihe National Government, since there is little hope of
doing many things that ought to be done by State governments. And for
certain connections along this line the President believes that if the pres
ent powers of the National Government are not adequate, the Constitution
ebould be amended so as to make them adequate. These observations
about the control of corporations lead to the discussion of Ihe power of
the Inter-State Commerce Commission, and to the discussion of railroad
rates. The President believes that if rates are too high they ought to be
lowered. In his own words : "In my judgment the most important pro
vision which such law should contain is that conferring upon some compe
tent administrative body the power to decide, upon the ctse baing brought
before it, whet her a given rate prescribed by a railroad is reasonable and
just and if it is found to be unreasonable and unjust then, after full inves
tigation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it
shall not be lawful to go the maximum reasonable rate as it is commonly
called this decision to go into effect within a reasonable time and to ob
tain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts" Those who
heard the President's speech m Kaleigh on tte occasion ol his visit to the
State Fair in October, will remember he uttered some such sentiments
there The people generally believe that the President is right in his pos
ition concerning railroad rales. Omitting the many subjects which he,
discussed with clearness and ability, it is interesting to note his emphasis
on the merits of individuals. . It is not, says the President, the question of
Oman's riches or poverty, wisdom or ignorance, that is to decidede his
tZh as a citizen, but his character and real merit and bis just claim to a
