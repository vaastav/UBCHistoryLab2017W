SMILES OR TEARS.
A casual observer ot the plump,
parboiled physiognomy of the editor
of the News and Observer would
not take that versatile genius for a
wit or a humorist; and yet no con
stant reader ot his editorials can
preserve a solemn countenance. The
Caucasian, indeed, firmly believes
i hat, if Mr. Daniels should slowly
pass through a furnace "net seven
teen times hotter than a furnance
kin be het," aud suffer the fiercyest
reductiou that his most implacable
foe would pray upon him, any good
literary analyst could still find,
quietly gleaming in his cold ashes,
distinct traces of the mental quali
ties which make men laugh.
In testimony whereof, read the
following, see the fox's head hid iu
thiu brush, the main part of him ex
poted to the gaze of friend and foe
alike: ft ad and take a smile:
"ine antl Democratic papers are
accepting the statements of the de
feated iu Alabama that the Constitu
tional sunrage a menu men I was
adopted by gross frauds. It is not
true. It was adopted as honestly
aud as fairly as the amendment In
North Carolina was adopted In
August 1900."
The last sentence how unusually
true for such a source! And, at first
sight, as laughable as 'tL, true. For
there is nobody in North Carolina,
whatever his party affiliation,
wnetmr saint or tinner, layman or
pulpiteer, (saving, of course, the d
Fs, which by interpretation is to
say the densely foolish,) but knows
that the amendment in North Caro
lina was adopted in August 1900,
not fairly and honestly, but unfairly
and dishonestly, by those twin
synonyms of anarchy, "force and
fraud" if we may be allowed the
ue of Democratic gubernatorial
campaign parlance.
By force and fraud, of course; by
, redshirtlsrn and rascality; the baintl
shuffling off honesty and religion, as
a mortal coil, to work the wonderful
transformation which should show
the negro counties voting almost
solidly with the machine for so
called "white supremacy" (just as
in Alabama) to overwhelm the anti
amendment white voters elsewhere
in the state.
The immediate result of such
metods do you ask? The transfer of
offices and formal government,
legislative, judicial, and executive,
to those who had plotted by such
methods to obtain them. But this
is not all, nor even the most serious:
the spirit of redshirt anarchy and
atheism abides and bears more bitter
and lasting fruit. Go and ask the
pulpit in North Carolina the cause
of the dearth of spirituality in their
charges, a dearth which they fail to
revival away; and ask anywhere the
cause of increased crimes and lynch
irgs, murders and violence, the
growing irreverence for law, human
and divine, notwithstanding the
party of "good government and or
der" controls, in North Carolina. .
The answer, though unuttered,
lies not far down in the heart of
every thoughtful man.
After all, the paragraph quoted
may be sorrowful rather than funny.
And still, reverting to our first
thought, we may say:
"Sad It is, and yet its sadnens
Tremb'es on the verge of laughter "
PRESIDENT"
ROOEVELTS. MESS
AGE,
The President's message which
was sent to Congress yesterday
while it is long yet is clear and well
written. He recommends legisla
tion to suppress anarchy; the exteu
slon of i he merit system; the build
ing of the Nicaragua canal; the regu
lation of trusts; the exclusion of the
Chinese; a stronger navy; the crea
tion of a new cabinet office secre
tary of commerce and industry etc.'
Usually members of congress do
not listen to the leading of a Presi
dent's message, but this one was
listened to by both houses of con
gress with close attention from be
ginning to end.
We will publish some of the most
nottd parts of this message in oar
next issue.

A sHAMEKUL RECITAL AND A
SHAMEFUL. ALTERNATIVE."
The Charlotte Observer in a re
cent Hitorial under the above head
ing, sayi-:- . '
"It is teen in The Richmond Times
that "ex -Governor Johnston, of Ala
bama, has issued a statement assert
ing that the ratification of the Ala
bama constitution was obtained by
gross f rauds. He says that the coun
ties in which the white voters pre
dominate gave a majority against
the constitution, but that enoigh
votes were fraudulently counted in
the counties where the colored vot
ers predominate to overcome tne
white majority and to secure an ap
parent majority for the constitution.
Ex-Governor Johnston is a Dem
ocrat and a truthful and honorable
man who would .not libel his own
people. His recital is a shameful
one, and our Richmond contempo
rary takes occasion to remark upon
it for its parts that it "would be in
finitely better to proclaim the Vir
ginia constitution than to have it
ratified by trickery and fraud." It's
none of our business but it occurs to
us that the alternative presented is a
frightful one. The Virginia Demo
cratic convention demanded that a
constitutional convention be called
and pledged itself that if this w ere
done the constitution which it
framed should be submitted to the
people. Now it appears that if it is
to become the State's organic law
either this pledge is to be violated
and the constitution "proclaimed"
by the body which frames it, or else
it is to be "ratified by trickery and
fraud." It had better fail than be
come the law by either means, other
wise as grave an accusation can be
brought against Virginia as ex-Gov
ernor Johnston and others find them
selves impelled to bring against Ala
baiua."
And liow comes the News and
Observer which says in reply that
the methods employed in Alabama
to count in their constitution, "are
just as fair and honest as those used
in North Carolina" to adopt the
constitutional amendment.
We apologize to the Charlotte Ob
server for quoting from the News
and Observer as authority, yet that
paper seems to be the mouthpiece oi
the redshirt, ballot-box stuffing ma
chine which is now in control.
THE MISSING GIRL. MYSTERY.
All the country around Eenton
and Elizabeth City is very much
wrought up over the strange disap
pearance of a beautiful young woman,
Miss Ella Cropsey. She disappeared
under strange and mysterious cir
cumstances about ten days ago. She
went on the front porch one night
to bid her visitor and admirer good
night. This was the last seen of the
girl. She did not return and no
one has seen her since. Searching
parties have been looking for her
every day and night. It ts thought
that there must have been foul play
or else she is held somewhere in
captivity by a jealous lover. Mr.
James Wilcox, who was one of her
admirers, has been arrested on suspi
cion. The Governor has offered a $300
reward and other rewards have been
offered making the total about $900.
The mistery is no nearer cleared up
today than when it was learned that
the girl was missing.
Some time ago the North Carolina
Historical Society conceived the idea
of encouraging the writing and pre
servation of North Carolina history
by offering premiums for prize es
says on designated subjects. A prize
of $60 was offered for the best sketch
of the life of Nathaniel Macon. A
number of excellent articles were
written and the prize was secured by
Mr. Clarence E Poe, the editor of
the Progressive Farmer. His ar
ticle is an admirable one and the
first installment of it appears in this
issue of the Caucasian. The North
Carolina Historical Society deserves
great credit for the good work that
it is doing along this line.

A SELF-SUSTAINING UAIL SERVICE.
The First Assistant Postmaster General
Thinks It Will be Bronarht About by
Extension of Free Delivery.
Washington, Dec. 1. A self sus
taining service, brought about by
the yearly increase of the postal
revenues resulting from general ex
tension of rural free delivery, is the
conclusion reached by First Assist
ant Postmaster General W. M. John
son, in his annual report. Of the
gross postal revenues of the United
States for the past fiscal year $74,
295,394 came from 866 delivery
cities. The remaininsr 3,600 provi
dential postoffices yielded $16,U63,
252, while the 75'479 fourth-class
postoffices produced $18,913,519.
Mr Johnson says that the fact
that the postal service in the largest
cities is practically perfect is the ex
planation of why the annual per
centage ox increase in tne revenues
of the free delivery postoffices should
be three times greater than in the
smaller cities and five times as large
as that of the fourth-class offices.
As rural free delivery reaches out
into the country, giving equal facili
ties without regard to the locality,
he says it increases the revenues at
a rate et least equal to that main
tained in the free delivery cities,
where, during the past five years, it
has averaged 8 per cent. At the
end of the present fiscal year 8,600
rural routes were successfully in
operation, 6,000 being in effect by
December 2nd.

The great proportion of women who suffer
never make a serious effort to benefit them
elves. The most of them go on paying no at
tention to their little menstrual disorders, be.
ueving they will eventually wear off. They
grow worst and worse every day. At the
period of menstruation a woman Is peculiarly
susceptible to cold and other external influences
and it is also the most favorable time for the
development of hidden disease germs which
may be lurking In the system. Any physician
knows that disordered menstruation, falling of
the womb and leucorrhoea are blighting lives In
almost every home. No woman should neg

of female diseases. Almost Instant relief can
