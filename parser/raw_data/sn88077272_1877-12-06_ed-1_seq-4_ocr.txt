At Columbia, Tenn., a few days since, a
mob of twenty-five hundred citizens took a
negro from the jail, and hanged him to the
Court-house window. He made a brutal as
sault, a few days previous, on a white
woman.
Governor Hampton, of South Carolina,
has sent his annual message to the General
Assembly. He strongly deprecates repudi
tion of the State's obligations, and argues
that the settlement of the public debt ques
tion shall be made upon a basis which will
not impair the credit of the State. He urges
fostering of the pub'ic school system to give
free education to all classes.
The special investigating committee of the
South Carolina Legislature appointed last
- spring to examine, among other things, into
the election of John J. Patterson, as United
States Senator in 1872, have submitted a
report. - The report gives an epitome of tes
timony taken before the eonlmittees, in
cluding about forty ex-members of th? Leg
islature, white and colored, Republicans,
whose ev'dence concurs in the statement
that Pattersons'! ' election ' was secured
through bribery.

part of the act of January 14, 1875, known
as the resumption act, which authorized the
Secretary of the Treasury to dispose of
United States bonds, and redeem ana cancel
greenback currency, was read by its title,
and referred to the Committee on Finance.
The latter part of the morning honr was de
voted to discussing the resolution submitted
by Mr. Chaffee calling upon the President
for information as to what impediments
exist which prevent him from executing the
laws against the Union Pacific Bailroad and
ita branches. But before reaching a vote
the morning hour expired, and considera
tion waa resumed of the resolution to
discharge the Committee on Privileges and
Elections from further consideration of the
. credentials of M. C. Butler, claiming a seat
as (senator irom couth Carolina, and Mr.
Davis explained the reasons why he fa
vored the motion to discharge the committee.
Mr. Edmunds made a speech in reply, in
which he made an appeal for proceeding
with dneregaid to the rules and regulations
of the Senate, and settling the case with
proper regard for law and justice, and not
introducing in the place of these partisan

bargain, precipitated by the battle which till
then had not taken definite shape. Mr. Mo-
Donald interrupted to ask if Mr.

Patterson thought it necessary to
explain his position. He said he waa not

there was no prospect ot closing the debate.
November 27. Senate Some time passed
bofore a quorum was present, during which
Mr. Wadleigh read from a book the testimony
taken by the committee of the Senate in
South Carolina a year ago. The resolution
of Mr. Thurman, after various remarks, pro

to A), Messrs. ratterson ana Lonover voting
on the side of the Democrats. The resolu

laid over. Mr. Edmunds gave notice that,
immediately after the reading of the journal,
to-morrow, he would call up the highest
matter of privilege, touching the credentials
of Mr. Kellogg, reported from the Committe
on Privileges and Elections. The Senate
then on a motion of Mr. Thurman, by a vote
of yeas, 28 ; nays 27, went into executive
session, and when the doors re-opened, the
Senate after a continuous session of twenty
eight hours, adjourned until twelve o'clock
to-n:orrow Haute Several bills were
introduced and referred. Mr. Crittenden
asked unanimous consent for the considera
tion of his resolution requesting the Presi
dent to state what legal impediments, if any,
exists that prevent him from executing the
law in relation to the Union Pacifio Sail-
road and it branches. Mr. Price objected.
Mr. Crittenden then moved to suspend the
rules and adopt the resolution, this being
one oi the last six days of the session, when
it is in order at any time to move to sus

motion, and the question being put, the
resolution was adopted 129 to 41; two

Report the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue
says in his annual report, after considerable
attention to the Question of chanrine? the
rate of taxation on spirits and tobacco, that
he has come to the conclusion that the
interests of the government and
manufacturers and dealers will be
preserved by allowing the rates of taxation
to remain undisturbed, nor would he recom
mend a change of law in respect to the tax
on fruit brandy.
Collections for the past fiscal year were
$418,870,997, and for the months of July,
August, September, and October of the
present fiscal year 38,772,823, a grand total

for checks, $611,558 ; amount of tax collected

interests of the government would warrant
so great a reduction in its revenues, it
seems to me that in selecting objects to be
relieved from taxation, these wonld com
mend themselves strongly to the law making
power. If, however, in view of the falling
off of receipts from customs, it is deemed
inexpedient to reduce revenues by as large

the law taxing matches could with very

for taxation that could more easily bear
burdens imposed upon it than the capital

tax of 1,889.334 realised from stamns UDon

cost to the government, and as it is realized
from nearly ninety-four and one-half million

He reasoned and persuaded and argued
with it until there wasn t skin eneugn
left on his knuckles to look at without
making- the eves watery, and then he sat
down on his trunk and talked in a man

his thirst was pulling at him like a boy

he got his head through the tramsom,
whatever misgivings he may have had
