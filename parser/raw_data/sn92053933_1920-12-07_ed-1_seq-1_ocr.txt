This ,8 gurprising and proceeds, I
am sure, from failure to unders and
what legislation is now available
for the protection of the public
against interference with the suffi
ciency of coal supply for the nation.
There are some ten thousand soft
coal mines open and shipping coal.
These mines are fully equipped
with underground haulage ways,
ven.ilating systems, mechanical
equipment and employta, so that
u.ey can produce some iOO.OOO.OwO
tons yeany of bituminous coal.
This is 30 per cent more coal tnan
the country usually needs.
With 7,000 producers operating
10,000 mines in 26 different states,
it is nonsense to talk about combi

;no SUccessful combinaUon
among
producers for the restriction of pro
duction unuer such conditions any
more than the farmer can success
fully combine to put up the price
of wheat, corn, cotxin or other ag
ricultural commodities. . You ask,
then, what causes these periodical
shortages of coal. Just two
things :
Poor Transportation.
First, some deficiency of trans-
portation which, for a period makes
it impossible to ship from the
mines the tonnage of coal needed
to meet current demands. That is
a matter, it may be argued, against
which the public should be safe
guarded and protected, I agree.
What is not generally understood,
however, that this already has been
done and the public now, through
ample legislation, is fully protected

Esch-Cummins law and the inter-
state commerce commission have
been subjected to the severest pos
sible testa ot their sufficiency in the
i face of a grave transportation
emergency and they have more than
made good. Clearly, then, no more
legislation is needed to protect the
public against that kind of inter
ruption in its coal supply. '
Strikes Intemni. '
Now the only other serious inter
ruption to coal supply arises from
strkes. This may come from
strikes not tn the coil industry at
all. but among railway employes,
dockmen, truck drivers, etc.. as well
as among coal miners. So far there
is no protection to the public
against that kind of interruption of
its coal supply. .
Let me say. therefore, that" with
the legislation now on the statute
books, it i clear no further law Is

This Is the mission upon which
democracy came into the world.

nation of individuals to make laws

the time of all o:hers when democ

Two Ways to A twist.
There are two ways in which the
Unite! States can assist to accom

offering the example within her

of democracy to make and enforce

nf that nronertv' which is devoted
to the development of industry and
the increase of the necessary
wealth of the world. Second, by
standing for right and justice as
towards individual nations. The
law of democracy is for the pro
jection of the weak, and the influ
ence of every democracy in the
world should be for the protection
of the weak nations, the nation
which is struggling towards ' its
right and towards its proper recog
nition and privilege in the family
of nations. The United States can
not refuse this role of champion
without putting the stigma of re.

1812. I urge you to consider that
the display of an immediate dis
position on the part of congress to
remedy any Injustices or evils that
may have shown themselves in our
own national life will afford the
most effectual offset to the forces
of chaos and tyranny which are

The nation's finances have shown
marked improvement during the
past year. The total ordinary re
ceipts of $6,694,000,000 for the fis
cal year 1920 exceeded those for
1919 by $1,542,000,000, while the to
tal net ordinary expenditures de
creased from $18,5lf,000,000 to
$6,403,000,000.
The gross public debt, which
reached its highest point on Aug.
31, 1919. when it was $26,596,000,
000, had dropped on Nov. 30, 1920,
to $24,175,000,000. There also has

COVERING ALL

Protection Demanded By
Farmers On "From Pea
nuts to Wool" List.
Indianapolis, Ind., Dec: 7. (Unit
ed Press.) Demands for protective
tariffs covering farm products from
peanuts to wool, were demanded by
i delegates to the convention of the
j American farm Bureau federation
in session here today,
President J. R. Howard declared
; sentiment from all sections ot the
country was solidifying behind a
tariff program, though in the past
the farmer has been regarded as a
"free trader."
"Our tariff demands are not radi
cal," Howard said. "All that we
want is equality in tariff legislation
as it pertains, to industrial and ag-
j ricultural products.'
The proposed duty oa foreign
peanuts is not intended to make the
bags at the ball parks smaller, but
merely to afford protection for
southern growers who turn much
of their product into oil. They are
now facing serious i competition
from foreign imports of vegetable
oil.
Delegates from Michigan and Cal
ifornia, the largest bean producing
states, are clamoring for a duty on
Japanese beans, contending that
shipments from that country where
labor js comparatively cheao are
ruining the industry in this coun
try. Canadian shipments of pota
toes also are worrying American
larmers. Canadian farmers can
place potatoes on the Detroit mar
ket cheaper because of the freight
ducers In that my. Howard said".
Sheep producers are' vigorously
opposing shipments duty free of
wool from Australia and meats
from Argentina, claiming the sheep
industry In the United States is
endangered by this competition.
