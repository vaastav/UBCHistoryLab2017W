? Says an Altoona, Pa., dispatch of
December 2: H. B; Goodman, a Chicago
millionaire, who has been in this region
placing machinery in his mines,
was hurt mortally in an accident in
Vintondale shaft last night. Mr. Goodman
had gone down into the pit to direct
the setting of mining machines.
When about half way down a 500-foot
slope, a car on the incline broke from
the chain rigging and started down into
the mine. Mr. Goodman, Superintendent
Claghorn and several laborers
were caught in a narrow- part of the
shaft where escape was impossible.
With courage, Woodman, who was
familiar with mining machinery, ran
a pneumatic digger on the tramway,
but in doing so was caught
in the wreck of the runaway car
with the machine. Both his legs
were crushed and he lay pinioned in the
until the men whose lives he
uai ivn^oo umvi* v?w ? ??- ?
had saved by his courage, were enabled
to dig him out of the debris of twisted
iron and fallen rock. Two of the laborers
were slightly hurt by falling
rock. Mr. Goodman was removed to
the hospital at Johnstown, where both
his legs were amputated. He is perfectly
conscious and pleased that he
saved all the party from horrible death.
The hospital surgeons fear that his life
cannot be saved.
? The secretary of the treasury on
Wednesday, sent to congress the annual
estimates of the expenses of the
government for the coming year. They
aggregate $626,741,762. This is a slight
decrease from the total estimates of
last year. The appropriations for the
present year are $586,655,362. The estimates
cover every branch of government
service and by departments are
as follows: Legislative, $10,956,700: executive,

136; war department, $176,658,345; navy
department, $88,913,248; interior department,
$170,799,705; postofflce department,
$6,295,877; department of
agriculture, $4,669,050; department of
labor, $177,980; department of justice,

affairs. $9,250,571.
? At Tuesday's session of the Cuban
constitutional convention three complete
constitutions were submitted byGeneral
Rivera, Senor De Quesada and
colored eeneral. Morua, respective
ly. General Rivera's proposed constl- j
tution provides for a president, a senate
and. a house of representatives, a
governor for each of the six provinces,
a legislative body for each province
and member of the house of representatives
for each 30,000 inhabitants, with
election by popular vote. His scheme
called also for the election of three
electors in each municipal district,
whose duty it shall be to elect a legislative
body of eleven for the province
in which they reside. This legislative
body shall elect the governor and four
members ot the senace. Finally, the
six legislatures will meet and choose
the president, who must be a native)
Cuban. Candidates for senatorial honors
must have incomes of at least $1,500
a year. General Rivera's plan is to
have the power vested in the central
government and the convention virtually
pledged itself to one state government
at yesterday's secret session. Seaor
De Quesada's proposal would centralize
the government in a president,
senate, house of representatives elect ed
by the people, suffrage being restricted
to educational qualifications.
General Morua offered for approval the
-constitution of the United States, with
the exception that any one who fought
in the war might be elected president.
His proposal leaves the question of
army and navy to be decided by congress.
? The report of the Isthmian canal
* commission was suomumu iu cungieoo
by the president last Tuesday. The
commission estimates the cost of the
Nicaragua route at $200,540,000 and the
two Panama routes, one at $142,342,579
and the other at $156,378,258. To the
Panama routes must be added a large
sum that people who hold concessions
demand. The conclusions of the commission,
while decidedly in favor of the
Nicaragua route, are as follows: "1.
The estimated cost of building the Nicaragua
canal is about $5S,000,000 more
than that of completing the Panama
canal, leaving out the cost of acquiring
the latter property. This measures
the difference in the magnitude of the
obstacles to be overcome in the actual
construction of the canals and covers
all physical considerations. The new
Panama Canal company has shown no
disposition to sell its property to the
United States. Should that company be
able and willing to sell, there is reason
to believe that the price would not be
such as would make the total cost to
the United States less than that of the
Nicaragua canal. 2. The Panama canal,
after completion, would be shorter,
have fewer locks and less curvature
than the Nicaragua canal. The measure
of these advantages is the time required
for a vessel to pass through,
which is estimated for an average ship"
at 12 hours for Panama and 33 hours at
Nicaragua. On the other hand, the
distance from San Francisco to New
Tork is 377 miles, to New Orleans 579
miles and to Liverpool 3S6 miles greater
via Panama than via Nicaragua.
The time required to pass over these
distances being greater than the difference
in the time of transit through the
Nicaragua line, after completion, would
be somewhat the more advantageous
of the two to the United States, notwithstanding
the greater cost of maintaining
the longer canal. 3. The government
of Colombia, in which lies the
Panama canal, has granted an exclusive
concession, which still has many
years to run. So far as can be ascer
tained, the company is not willing to
sell its franchise, but it 'will allow the
United States to become the owner of
part of its stock. The commission considers
such an arrangement inadmissible.
The government of Nicaragua
and Costa Rica, on the other hand, are
untrammeled by concessions."

The first bill Introduced In the house
was Crumpacker's to reduce representation
In the South. The bill will be
debated, no doubt, and at times It will
look as if it were about to pass; but we
have no Idea that the Republicans will
ever allow it to become a law. They
are not looking for so much trouble as
this measure would .bring them.
After receiving a series of ovations
in France, President Kruger, of the
Transvaal, went to Germany; but at
Cologne he got a telegram from Emperor
William in which the latter represented
himself as "too busy" to receive
the visitor. President Kruger was very
much affected by the emperor's message.
It means that German sympathy, which
was four years ago strong for the
Boers, is now with the British on account
of identical political interests in
China and elsewhere.
Senators Tillman and McLaurin
have succeeded in getting through the
senate an appropriation of $250,000 for
the South Carolina Inter-State and
West Indian exposition. If the state's
representatives in the house can do as
well, the success of the exposition on a
tremendous scale will be assured. We
/
believe that the representatives will be
able to get the bill through; but ordinarily
it is much more difficult to get
an appropriation bill through the
house than through the senate.
The Gastonia Gazette, one of the

Grier's valedictory appears in the last
issue of The Gazette. It is a straightforward
business statement. Editor
Marshall's valedictory appears in three
expressive words that show his appreciation
of the responsibility he has incurred.
He says: "In trouble again."
An Indianapolis dispatch of December
5. says that Charles W. Walter, secretary
of the "Middle-of-the-Road"
Populist state committee, has issued a
| call for a conference to be held in In
cnanapons on uecemoer zz ior me purpose
of considering the advisability and
practicability of organizing a new party
to embrace Social Democrats, Silver
Republicans and Reform Democrats.
Walter is quoted as saying: "We
expect that in 1904 our party will be
the second in numerical strength in the
country. We expect that in the West it
will absorb the Democratic party. I
know personally from men close to W.
J. Bryan, that he is in sympathy with
the movement. The names suggested
for the new party are 'Federate,'
'American, and 'Federal.' "
The Spartanburg Journal says that
the tardiness with which taxpayers are
taking up their receipts, is not an evidence
of an inability to pay promptly;
but merely the result of the established
custom of postponing the time for the
payment of taxes. We think The Journal
is exactly right. If the time limit
were fixed at December 31, and taxpayers
knew this would be the last day, all
who are likely to pay without penalty
at all, would pay by that date. As matters
stand now, we have no idea that
all payments will be made by December
31. People feel assured that the
time will be extended. If it is not extended,
the responsible officials who
established the precedent heretofore,
will deserve the bitter condemnation
they are likely to get. For the best Interest
of the public service, however,
and the best Interest of the tax-paying
public, we think the legislature wouli
do well to fix a time limit and stick
to It. The way the thing has been
managed heretofore is almost contemptible.
The cotton market, just at this time,
is somewhat of a puzzle. Although
there is much activity trtroughout the
South just now, there is no doubt of
the fact that many of the heavy buyers
are doing so with considerable doubt as
to what the future may bring. There
is a feeling that if the bureau report, to
be Issued next Monday, indicates a crop
of less than 9,500,000 bales, prices will
take a soar upward. If, on the other
hand, the bureau reports indicate more
than 9,500,000 bales, the probability is
that the tendency will be in the other
direction. Notwithstanding a common
belief that the crop is not so large as
it was last year, it is a fact that up to
this time receipts are considerably
heavier. This, however, does not necessarily
indicate the size of the crop,
for the much higher prices prevailing
this year may have easily operated to
bring cotton out more rapidly. Under
all the circumstances, we do not care to
offer advice. The situation is considerably
involved, and every holder of cotton
must be his own judge as to when
to sell.
It is quite probable that had the
Paris exposition not been on hand,
France would have been at war with
England before the Transvaal struggle
was many months old. French feeling
against England is proverbial, and the
two nations have been at peace as long
as seems reasonably possible. The
French have many grudges against
the British, and are not lacking in
eagerness to seek a favorable opportunity
to take chances on the settlement
of some of them. But the French are
also fond of money, and they could not
think of spoiling the big exposition's
Income by war. Now,that the exposi,o
an/1 thA "RHtlsh n.re still
busy in South Africa, French war talk
is becoming more pronounced. In the
French senate the other day, General
Marcier, commander of the army, stated
that the invasion of England is now
practicable, and was about to unfold a
plan that he claimed would necessarily
succeed; but was checked by the president
of the senate, who held that such
matters should not be publicly discussed.
The unfolding of the plan would
have been interesting. The plan, whatever
it is, is no doubt plausible; it is
just what might be expected of an enthusiastic
Frenchman. It is sincerely
hoped that it will never be attempted.
In spite of their dislike of the British,
the French are a great people who
have done much for the world and to
whom the world is under obligations.
People who really have a kindly feeling
for them would rather not see them try
i
to go into such trouble as would be
theirs. MERE-MENTION.

AN AGREEMENT REACHED.
Beginning to Look as if the Chinese Puzzle Is
Nearing Solution.
Says a Washington special of December
6 to the Chicago Times-Herald:
American diplomacy leads the world.
The great powers have practically
reached an agreement as to the basis
of the future movements in China, and
this basis is that which was proposed
by Secretary Hay. Secretary Hay has
cabled minister Conger to sign for the
United States an agreement which the
ministers reached at Pekin. This
agreement was sent to the home governments
for their approval and with a
oinoric nvnontinn ovprv power has al
ready cabled Its representative at Pekin
to sign the agreement and that
power will probably do so today or the
next day.
Thus the concert of the powers is preserved
and a practical and rational basis
of settlement has been reached at
last, that is due to the skill and firmness
of the American secretary of state.
The chief features of the agreement
are as follows:
"It is stipulated that the punishments
to be meted out to the guilty
Chinese are as severe as it is possible
for the Chinese government to administer,
but not more severe. The government
of China is not to be asked to do
the impossible. It is expected that under
this obligation the government will
punisn severely eleven ring leaders in
the attacks upon the legations and in
the incitement of anti-foreign outrages.
"Some of these will be beheaded.
Others will be banished or degraded.
If Great Britain and Germany had been
permitted to have their way the dynas?
ty would have been compelled to agree
to behead men who are beyond the 11
reach of the emperor's government, j
men who are in the western provinces (
and in command of military forces suf- .
flcient to protect them. Secretary Hay ]
has from the first contended that while I
in Justice all these heads should be tak- <
en. off, it is necessary to catch your
hare before cooking him, and that it
was simply absurd to require the Chinese
government to decapitate men
whom it could not get hold of. These 1
guilty officers will be banished and de- 1
graded and thus it will be made impossible
for them to return to positions
of power."
It is stated in the agreement that the
Chinese government is to formally ad- 1
mit its liability to the powers for damages
and for the expense of military
operations. This done, the amount of
indemnity to be paid each nation is to
be ascertained afterwards by means of
careful inquiry and estimates.
Tnis part of the plan will require i
much time, and while of course it will
give rise to opportunities for troublemaking
powers to precipitate new complications,
it is felt that a great point
nas Deen gained oy maKiqg tne amount
of Indemnity a subject of negotiations
as it should be rather than a preliminary
condition.
Other features of the agreement pertain
to fhe legation guards to be kept
in Pekln, to the razing of the Pekin '
forts and other military particulars
similar to those proposed by the French
government a month ago. To all these
conditions it is understood Li Hung
Chang and Prince Ching, representing
the emperor, will accede.
In official and diplomatic circles here
the belief is expressed that a great step
forward has been taken and that again
there is good prospect for an adjustment
of the seemingly unending complication
without dismemberment and
without destruction of the dynasty.
The agreement now reached points to
an early military evacuation of Pekin
and a return of the court to that capital.
1 GATTIS VS. KIL60.
Story of the' Trouble That la Disturbing North
Carolina Methodists.
This is the most remarkable family
quarrel that has ever disturbed North
Carolina Methodists. It has created
considerable interest in South Carolina,
for Mr. Kilgo was brought up In this
state and was an instructor In Wofford
college a short time. Close observers in
the quarrel claim^that it has already
brought about a decided if not bitter
partisan feeling amongst North Carolina
Methodists. The beginning of this
unfortunte affair came about in this
way. Soon after Mr. Kilgo was elected
president of Trinity college, some of its
friends began to feel as if a mistake
had been made. After he had been
there about two years a resolution was
offered in the board of trustees to elect
nrMlddnt and nrofessors of the col
lege every fifth year Instead of every
year. Objection was made to this and
after considerable discussion the resolution
was voted down. In that discussion,
Judge Clark, a trustee, stated
that the resolution emanated from
President Kilgo, who felt that his influence
and popularity were on the
wane and that he desired to secure in
that way a five years' tenure of the
presidency. He also slated that the
president was a noted clerical wirepuller
who always raised trouble when
possible. Mr. Kilgo being a ready
fighter, and never fearing to strike
back, determined to settle Judge Clark.
An investigation of his charges was
made. The committee was self-appointed,
or selected from Mr. Kllgo's
friends. Clark found himself in the
minority and was forced from the board
of tVustees. During that Investigation
Mr. Kilgo appeared before the committee
in his own defense. He spoke for
two hours or more and was at his best.
The address was a splendid exhibition
of satire, ridicule and invective. His
main attack was on Mr. Gattis, a
preacher, who had been a colporteur
for North and South Carolina. He also
had a bdok and stationery store at Dur
ham. Mr. Gattls had given testimony
before the committee supporting Judge
Clark's statement as to the adroit
manner In which Mr. Kllgo was accustomed
to pull Methodists wires. In his
address Mr. Kllgo was especially severe
on Gattls. John Randolph, In his
best days, could not have strengthened
the epithets of Trinity's president, unless
he had thrown In a few good,
strong, "Old Virginia expressions." So
proud was the president and committee
of their triumph over Judge Clark and
the almost unanimous setting aside of
his charges as to Mr. Kilgo's being a
scheming wire puller, that it was considered
wise to publish the Investigation
proceedings In pamphlet form. Of 1
course Mr. Kilgo's speech was included.
That pamphlet was the basis of
the suit for damages. Mr. Gattls claimed
that his business was seriously injured
by statements made in that ad- ?
dress and that his character for veracity,
honesty and every manly quality .
and Christian grace had been assailed. ,
He brought suit against Mr. Kilgo, Mr. (
Duke, a son of the original Duke, and ,
a Mr. Odell, of Concord, who were in
strumental in the publishing of that j
pamphlet. About a dozen or more ,
prominent law firms were employed. ]
About 14 lawyers were actively engag'*
ulatmeH
ed on me case, xnc n???.?
was $100,000. Judge IJoke presided.
The trial began Thursday, November '
22, and a verdict was reached Satur- ^
day, December 1,. after 10 days. The j
judge made a charge an hour and a (
half long. The jury brought in a verdict
for $20,000 in favor of the plaintiff.
It seems that if there was any
difference of opinion amongst them it i
related only to the amount and not to ;
the question of libel. Mr. Kilgo put up ]
no witnesses in defense, although he had \
a large number present and one of his at- ]
torneys had made two or more visits to ;
this state and had taken numerous af- j
fidavits proving that he had never been i
a wire-puller or a strife-maker in the .<
South Carolina conference. But none ]
of this testimony was used at the trial, i
It was evident that his attorneys ex- ]
pected an adverse decision, for they i
laid the grounds of appeal at every 1
step. Mr. Kilgo and his friends return- i
ed to Durham on Friday, not waiting 1
for the closing arguments and verdict. 1
The students in a body met him and ^
gave him assurances that they would 1
trust him and stick to him in his trou- i
bles. To their manifestations of loy- i
alty he made fitting reply. An appeal <
will be taken to the supreme court of i
the state. Aside from the individuals (
interested in the case, the whole affair i
has been from its inception a great i
stumbling block to Methodists in North \
Carolina. The appeal and consequent'(
litigation will not tend to restore harmony
and bring about a spirit of true
Christian fellowship in the church. It
Is a reflection on tlje church that ministers
would stir up such a strife.?Carolina
Spartan.
McKinley's Head is Level.?President
McKinley declared himself today
as opposed to any proposition looking
to the cutting down of the representation
of those Southern states in which
there have been adopted laws or constitutional
amendments designed to restrict
the suffrage by eliminating the
lgr.orr.nt vote. It has been known to
those close to the president that he
would not favor any of the attempts to
punish the people of the South for this
sort of legislation which have sprung
from the disordered minds of partisan
Republican congressmen; but it was
not until today that he gave open expression
to his views. Senators Daniel
and Martin and Representatives Otrey
and Swanson, all of Virginia, called at
the White House this morning to pay
their respects to the president. The usual
greeting had hardly been exchanged
when President McKinley brought up
the subject himself. He did not say
very much, for a great many words on
the subject were unnecessary; but,
what he did say was decidedly to the
point and gave great satisfaction to his
auditors. He said that he was not in
favor of any mcsvement to cut down
the representation in congress of the
Southern states which had felt impellaH
nut iritA effect these restrictions
to the ballot. There might be abuses
growing out of the conditions In the
South; but he felt these would in time
rectify themselves and that the people
could be relied upon to do Justice. He
did not go Into details to any extent,
but he did make his position clear,'
which Is, of course, the main thing.
This statement is an open declaration
of President McKlnley's position as it
has been understood. A few men like
Judge Crumpacker, and others, who
want to cater to the colored vbtes In
their districts, ^rlll probably continue
their endeavors to agitate the cutting
down of Southern representation, but
these efforts have the sympathy neither
of the president nor other Republican
leaders.?Washington special of
Wednesday to The News and Courier.
Tillman's Law for England.?It
seems that the liquor trade In England
is practically a monopoly controlled by
the great breweries. The Bishop of
Chester suggests the adoption, In effect,
of the South Carolina dispensary. Commenting
on this the Boston Transcript
says:
"In view, of the failure, on another
side, of the restrictive policy of the last
25 years, nobody suggests another trial
of the plan of unrestricted trade In
beer. It Is realized that the existing
monopoly is unsatisfactory, both from
an economic and a temperance point of
view; and quite recently there has been
a movement of opinion in favor of the
" A J~ no o nithUn
uquur irduc ucms ui gauuicu uu ? ^m
trust. The Bishop of Chester Is the
foremost advocate of the new scheme,
which is practically the state dispensary
plan of selling liquor which Senator,
then governor, Tillman, of South
Carolina, Invented and caused to be
adopted in the early nineties in South
Carolina. 'It is being more and more
understood.' wrote the bishop in a letter
to the Manchester Guardian, 'that
to stand delicately aloof from the public
house and to try to regulate it by
merely external restriction is not
enough. You must reform it from
within. The licensing laws and authorities
must have a friend and colleague
inthe publican himself, as the servant
or reforming employers. You miist
change the whole motive of the management
of what is for better or for
worse an inevitable national institution.
You must as nearly as possible reorganize
it on the lines of a public trust.'
This Is the position of the upholders of
the South Carolina plan, which has
worked exceedingly well for that community.
For England the bishop's plan
is amazingly daring; but it has the
merit of being the only practical
one of the many plans which have been
canvassed in England during the thirty
years which parliament nas leit xne
liquor laws without change or amend"
ment."

The State Pension Board.
Columbia State, Thursday: The state
board of pensions held a long session
yesterday and it was one of considerable
importance. The board went over
the whole pension situation very carefully
and adopted a new set of rules
governing the filing and passing upon
applications for pensions. An entire
new set of blanks was also devised. As
soon as these rules and blanks can be
printed they will be sent to the chairnen
of the several new county boards,
[n cases where there are no new boards
the chairman of the old board will get
them. The new rules will require all
,vho wish pensions upon the next distrinution
of the fund to make out and
lie entirely new applications. There
,vill be absolutely no deviation from
this rule. The board yesterday greatly
ncreased its own efficiency by adding
to its membership, Dr. P. E. Griffin,
)f this city, who will be the general
nedical examiner of the body. Dr.
3riffin was for years the efficient superntendent
of the state hospital for the
nsane, and is now practicing in Colimbia.
A veteran himself, his services
>n the board will prove valuable.

THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS.
The county commissioners held their
regular monthly meeting last Wednesday.
All of the members of the board
were present <
At a previous meeting, the board had,
upon an exparte showing, passed a resolution
changing the road from the
Stony Fork creek to the Huey bridge.
At the meeting Wednesday, considera- bfe
opposition was developed, and It
was shown that people interested were
unwilling to give the right of way except
through due process of law. The t
former resolution was rescinded.
Mr. Adger Huey presented a claim
for $25 on account of injuries sustained
by a horse in a bridge. Mr. W. T.
Nevins was allowed $10 on tne same account.
Mr: N. W. Hardin made application *
to have a bridge over Susybole creek
repaired. Captain Crawford was ap- ?
pointed a committee to look into the
matter.
Mr. John B. Bratton asked for $75 on
account of injuries sustained by a
horse on a public highway. Commls- ^
sloner Crawford was appointed a com- ^
ralttee to make further Investigation.
A number of claims were audited and
a few were ordered paid. Nothing else
of especial public Interest was done.

THE COTTON MARKET. y*
Cotton has been comic? into the local ^
market during the past week at an un- '
usual rate, making business lively.
Monday's receipts were practically
nothing, on account of the unfavorable
weather, and also on account of the
fact that salesday Is not generally considered
a good day to sell anyway.
Tuesday's receipts were Jlght; but well r '
up to the'average of the daya of the
preceding week. -J .
On Wednesday, cotton /wagons began
to arrive from all sections In a continuous
stream, and the buyers were
kept busy during the whole day; but (
Thursday broke all previous records for
years. At times the streets were liter- *
ally blocked with wagons, and between
12 and 1 o'clock the reporter counted 62
bales on wagons strung out between
The Enquirer office and the Carolina
and North-Western depot.
During the day, prices ranged from
about 83 for stains, to 9? for the best,
and in all even 290 bales were bought
from wagons by the different buyers as
follows: Latta Bros., 7jJ bales; Riddle
& Carroll, 67 bales: J. M. Heath & Co.,
38 bales; John M. Hope, 31 bales;
Springs, Moore & Co., 27 bales; Beard
& Carroll, 14 bales.
There was a great deal of cotton In
again yesterday, and the buyers had
their hands full; but the receipts were
not so large as on Thursday or even on
Wednesday. *
THE F. H. BROWN PERSONALTY.
Pursuant to the advertised notice, the
ilerk of the court sold the personal
property belonging to the estate of the
late F. H. Brown, on Thursday and
Friday.
The sale took place at the late resllence
of the deceased, Mr. W. H. Mc- *
2onnell serving as auctioneer. It is esilmated
that the number of people
present was somewhere between 500
ind 1,000.
Considering values, the property generally
sold pretty high. Pome few articles
went cheap. For Instance a piano '
ippraised at $200, brought only $25; but
:his was because outsiders did not care
;o bid against a member of the family
vho wanted the instrument. Most of
;he farm machinery sold for less than
ts value for lack of bidders. Mules
jold at from $2.50 to $81, most of them
i shade under their actual value; but /
:here were no real first-class mules in
he lot of 30 or more on the place. The
iggregate of Thursday sales, as neary
as could be estimated yesterday,
vithout an exact calculation, was
lomething like $2,000. The purchase
jrice in many instances, was paid in
cash.
Clerk Wylie and Auctioneer McConlell
returned to Tlrzah yesterday
norning to wind up the remainder of
he business left undone during Thurslay.
They expected to get through
