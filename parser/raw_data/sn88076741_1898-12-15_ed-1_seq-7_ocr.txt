Washington, Dec. 6.—The president's
message was delivered to congress yes
terday, and is one of the most important
jdocuments coming from an executive In
recent years:
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives:
"Notwithstanding the added burdens
rendered necessary by the war, our people
irejoice in a very satisfactory and steadily
Increasing degree of prosperity, evidenced
by the largest volume of business ever
Recorded. Manufacture has been pro
ductive, agricultural pursuits have yield
ed abundant returns, labor in all fields of
ijndustry is better rewarded revenue leg
islation passed by the present congress
'has increased the treasury's receipts to
the amount estimated by its authors the
finances of tho government have been
successfully administered and its credit
advanced to the first rank while its cur
rency has been maintained at the world's
highest standard. Military service under
a common Hag and for a righteous cause
nas strengthened the national spirit and
served to coment.-more closely than ever
the fraternal bonds between every section
of the country."
In reviewing the controversy which led
•up to the war with Spain, tne president
takes up the thread of narrative where it
terminated in his last annual message.
He concluded: "It was honestly duo to
our friendly relations with Spain that she
.. :i should be given a reasonable chance to
realize her expectations of reform to
which she had become irrevocably com
mitted."
It became evident, however, that the
proposed plans were barren of good re
sults. No tangible relief was afforded the
reconcentrados. among whom the rate of
mortality frightfully increased the prof
ferred expedient of zones of cultivation
proved illusory and it was apparent that
nothing save the physical exhaustion of
Spain or the Cubans and the practical
ruin of the island" of Cuba could result
from the struggle then in progress.
At this critical juncture the destruction
of the battleship "Maine" occurred. Con
cerning it, the president says:
"It is a striking evidence of the poise
and sturdy good sense distlnuguishing our
national character, that this unlooked-for
blow, falling upon a generous people, al
ready deeply touched by preceding events
iin Cuba, did not move them to an in
stant, desperate resolve to tolerate no
longer the existence of a condition of dan
ger and disorder at our doors that made
possible sucli a deed, by whomsoever
wrought."
Resuming the war narrative, the presi
dent directs attention to the measures, in
cluding the $00,000,000 appropriation for
national defense, taken to place the coun
.try on a war footing, and adds: "It Is
sufficient to say that the outbreak of war,
when it did come, found our nation not
unprepared to meet the conflict."
Reference is made to the apprehension
of coming strife by the Continental pav
ers, voiced in the address to the president
through their ambassadors and envoj'S,
and to the president's reply thereto. Still
(animated, however, by the hope of a
peaceful solution of the difficulty, and
obeying the dictates of duty, the president
•relaxed no eort to bring about a speedy
ending of the Cuban struggle. Negotia
tions with the Madrid government proved
futile, so far as practical results were
concerned, and when the president pre
sented the question to' congress, saying:
,"In the name of humanity, in the name
of civilization, in behalf of endangered
.American interests, which give us tho
right and duty to speak, and to act, the
'war in Cuba must stop."
The Declaration of War.
The result of this statement of the case
was the adoption of the memorable joint
.resolution by congress, declaring the pur
jpose of the United States to intervene be
itween the Spanish and Cubans. Follow
ing swiftly upon the enactment of the res
olution came the severance of diplomatic
'relations between the two countries, the
proclamation of a blockade of Cuban
ports, the calling for volunteers and the
formal declaration of the existence of a
state of war. All other governments
were immediately notified of the existence
of war, and each proclaimed neutrality.
"It Is not among the least gratifying in
cidents of the struggle, that the obliga
tions of neutrality were impartially dis
charged by all, often under most delicate
and difficult circumstances."
The president reviews at length the
work of preparation for'war, referring
particularly to the enlistment of the vol
.unteers to the material increase of the
navy in both men and ships and to the
I precautionary measures taken for the
protection of the seaboard coast and the
cities.
"The aggregate number of mines placed
was 1,533, in the principal harbors, from
Maine to California."
Referring to "tl-e d'fflcult rnd important
character" of the work performed by the
signal corps, the president says:
"This service was invaluable to the ex
ecutive in directing the operations of the
army and navy. With a total force of
over 1,300, the loss was by disease, in
camp and field, officers and men included,
only five."
As to the authorized loan of $200,000,000,
which was taken entirely by small bid
ders, the president says:
"This was a most encouraging and sig
nificant 11 suit, showing the vast resources
of the nation ard the determination of the
'people to uphold their country's honor."
It is r.r.t within the province of this
message to narrate the history of the ex
traordinary war that followed the Spanish
declaration of April 21st, but a brief re
cital of its more sa'ient features is ap
propriate. The first encounter of the war
in point ol date took place April 27th,
|when a detachment of the blockading
squadron made a reconnoissance in force
'at. Matanzas, shelled the harbor forts and

I The next engagement was destined to
mark a memorable epoch in maritime war
fare. The Pacific fleet, under Commodore
iGeorge Dewey had lain for some weeks at
jHcng Kong. Upon the colonial proclama
tion of neutrality being issued and the
leustomary twenty-four hours' notice be
Ing given It repaired to Mirs Bay, near
JJong Kong, whence it proceeded to the
Philippine islands under telegraphed or
dersto capture or destroy the formidable
Spanish fleet then assembled at Manila.
At daybreak on the 1st of May the
American forces entered Manila bay, and
after a few hours' engagement effected
the total destruction of the Spanish fleet,
consisting of ten warships and a trans
port, besides capturing the naval station
and rorta at Cavite, thus annihilating the
Spanish naval power In the Pacific ocean,
and completely controlling the Bay of
,Manila, with the ability to take the city
,at will. Not a life was lost on our ships,
tne wounded only numbering seven, while

re,uctance
to cause needless loss
of life and property prevented the early
storming and capture of the city, and
therewith the absolute military occupancy
of the whole group. The Insurgents,
meanwlh'ile, had resumed active hostilities
•juspenaed by the uncompleted truce of
December, 1897. Their forces invested
Manila from the northern and eastern
sides, but were constrained by Admiral
Dewey and Gen. Merritt from attempt
ing an assault. It was fitting that what
ever was done In the way of decisive
operations in that quarter should be ac
complished by the strong arm of the
United Stales Aone. Obeying the stern
precept of war, which enjoins the over
coming of the adversary and the extinc
tion of his power wherever assailable as
the speedy and sure means to win a
peace, divided victory was not permissi
ble, for no partition of the rights and re
sponsibilities attending tne enforcement
of a just and advantageous peace could
bo thouEht of.
Operations Off Cuba.
Following the comprehensive scheme of
general attack, powerful forces were as
sembled at various points on our coast to
invade Cuba and Porto Rico. Meanwhile
naval demonstrations were made at sev
eral exposed points. On May 11, the
cruiser Wilmington and torpedo boat
Winslow were unsuccessful in an attempt
to silence the bdtteries at Cardenas
against Matanzas, Worth Bagley and
four seamen falling. These grcvious
fatalities were strangely enough among
the very few which occurred during our
naval operations in this extraordinary
conflict.
Meanwhile the Spanish naval prepara
tions had been pushed with great vigor.
A powerful squadron, under Admiral
Cervera. which hed assembled at Cape
Verde islands before the outbreak of
hostilities, crossed the ocean, and by its
erratic movements in the Caribbean sea,
delayed our military operations while
baffling the pursuit of our fleets. For a
time, fears were felt lest the Oregon and
Marietta, tlien nearing home, after their
lot voyage from San Francisco of over
15,000 miles, might be surprised by Ad
miral Cervera's fleet, but their fortunate
arrival dispelled these apprehensions and
lent much needed reinforcement. Not un
til Admiral Cervera took refuge in the
harbor of Santiago de Cuba, about May
0, was it practicable to plan a systematic
military attack upon the Antillean posses
sions of Spain.
Several demonstrations occurcd on the
coasts Of Cuba and Porto Rico, in
preparation for the larger event. On May
13 .he North Atlartic squadron shelled
San Juan de Porto Rico.
On May 30 Commodore Schley's squad
ron bombarded tho forts guarding the
mouth of Santiago harbor. Neither at
tack had any material result. It was evi
dent that well-ordered land operations
were indispensable to achieve a decided
advantage.
Hobson's Heroic Act.
The next act in the war thrilled not
only the hearts of our countrymen, but
the world, by its exceptional heroism. On
the night of June 7 Lieut. I-Iobson, aided
by S'3ven devoted volunteers, blockaded
tho narrow outlet from Santiago harbor
by sinking the collier Merrimac in the
channel, under a fierce fire from the shore
batteries, escaping with their lives, as by
a miracle, but falling into the hands of
tho Spaniards. It is a most 'gratifying in
cident of the war that the bravery of this
little band of hc-rocs was cordially appre
ciated by the Spaniards, who sent a flag
of truce to notify Admiral Sampson of
their safety and to compliment them upon
their daring act. They were subsequently
exchanged. July 7.
By June 7 the cutting of the last Cuban
cable isolated the island. Thereafter the
invasion was vigorously prosecuted. On
June 10. under a heavy protecting fire, a
landing of (00 marines from the Oregon,
Marblehead and Yankee was effected in
Guantanamo bay, where it had been de
termined to establish a naval station.
This important and essential port was
taken from the enemy after severe fight
ing by the marines, who were the first or
ganized force of the United States to
land in Cuba.
The Santiago Cnmimlg'n.
The position so won was held despite at
tempts to dislodge our forces. By June 10
additional forccs were landed and strong
ly Intrenched. On tine 22 the advance
of the invading army, under 3£aj. Gen.
Shafter, landed at Daiquiri, about fifteen
miles east of Santiago. This was accom
plished under great difficulties but with
marvelous dispatch. On June 23 the move
ment against Santiago was begun'. On
June 24 the first serious engagement took
place, in which the First and Tenth cav
alry and the First United States volunteer
cavalry. Gen. Young's brigade of Gen.
Wheeler's division, participated, losing
heavily. By nightfall, however, ground
within five miles of Santiago was won.
The advantage was steadily increased.
On July 1 a severe battle tooK place, our
forccs gaining the outworks of Santiago
on July 2 El Caney and San Juan were
taken after a desperate cnarge and tne
investment of 'the city wa.s completed.
The navy co-operated by shelling the town
and th-j coast forts.
On the day following this brilliant
achievement of our land forces, July 3,
occurred the decisive naval battle of the
war. The Spanish fleet, attempting to
leave the harbor, was met by the Ameri
can squadron under command of Commo
dore Sampson. In less than three hours
all the Spanish ships were destroyed, the
two torpedo boats being sunk and the
Marie Teresa, Almirante Oquendo, Vlz
caya and Cri.stoboi Colon driven asnore.
The Spanish admiral and over 1,300 men
were taken prisoners, white the enemy's
loss of life was deplorably large, some six
hundred perishing. On our side but one
man was killed, on the Brooklyn, and one
man seriously wounded. Although our
ships were repeatedly struck not one was
serio-usly injured.
"Where all so conspicuously distin
guished themselves, from the commanders
to the gunners and the unnamed heroes
in the boiler rooms, each and all contrib
uting toward the achievement of this as
tounding victory, for which neither an
cient nor modern history affords a par
allel in the completeness of the event and
the marvelous disproportion of casualties,
it would be. invidious to single out any
one for special honor."
In this connection the president says:
"Nor can we be unmindful of the achiev
ments of our builders, mechanics, and
artisans for their part in the construction
of our war ships."
As to the success gained by the arms
of uie United States in Cuba, the presi
dent says that the earnest and lasting
gratitude of the nation is unsparingly ou-.
"Nor should we alone remember the gal
lantry of the living the dead claim our
tears, and our losses by battle and disease
must cloud any exultation at the result
and teach us the awful cost of war. how
ever righteous the cause or signal the
VWnrv."
With the fall of Santiago, the occupa
tion of Porto Rico became the next stra
tegic necessity. Gen. Miles had previous
'y_bpen,assigned to organize an expedi
tion for that purpos?. Fortuna'e hs was
already at Santiago, where he had ar
rived on the 11th of July with reinforce-
xn-SP,
Lr Go. Shafter's army.
With these troops, consisting of 0,415 In
fantry and artillery, two companies of
engineers and one ccmpany of the signal
corps. Gen. Miles left Guantanamo on
July 21, having nine transports convoved I
by the fleet under Capt. Higginson with
•»,
officers and men. On July 27 he entered
Ponce, on' of the most important ports
In the island, from which he thereafter
directed operations for the capture of the
island.
With tho exception of encounters with
the enemy at Guayama, Hormlguercs,
Coamo and Yauco, and an attack on a
force landed at Cape San Juan there waa
no serloua resistance. The campaign was
prosecuted with great vigor, and by the
12th of August most of the Island was In
our possession, and the acquisition of the
remainder was only a matter of a short
time.
At most of the points In the Island our
troops were enthuslasticaly welcomed.
Protestations Of loyalty to the flag and
gratitude for delivery from Spanish rule
met our commanders at every point. As
a potent influence toward peace, the out
come of the Porto Rican expedition was
of great consequence and generous com
mendation is due to those who partici
pated in it.
The last scene of the war was enacted
at Manila, its starting place. On August
15, after a brief assault upon the works
by the land forces, in which the
squadron assisted, the capital surrendered
unconditionally. The casualties were
comparatively few. By this conquest of
the Philippine islands, virtually accom
plished when the Spanish capacity for re
sistance was destroyed by Admiral
Dewey's victory of the first of May, the
fate of the islands was formally sealed.
To Gen. Merritt, his officers and men, for
their uncomplaining and devoted services
and for their gallantry in action, the na
tion Is sincerely grateful. Their long voy
age was made with singular success and
the soldierly conduct of the men, most of
whom wore without previous experience
in the military service, deserves unmeas
ured praise.
The total casualties In killed and wound
ed In the army during the war with
Spain were: Officers killed, 23 enlisted
men killed, 257 total, 280. Officers wound
ed, 113 enlisted men wounded. 1,104 to
tal, 1,577. Of the navy: Killed. 17 wound
ed, G7 died as result of wounds, 1 inval
ided from service, ti total, i)l.
"It will be observed tiiat while our navy
was engaged in two great battles and
numerous perilous undertakings in block
ade and bombardment, and more than
50,000 of our troops were transported to
distant lands and were engaged in assault
and siege and battle and many skir
mishes in unfamiliar territory, we lost in
both arms of the service a total of l.CtlS
killed and wounded, and in the entire
campaign, by land and sea, we did not
lose a gun or a flag or a transport or a
ship, and with the exception of the crew'
of the Merrimac, not a soldier or sailor
was taken prisoner."
The president bears testimony and pays
fitting, tribute "to the patriotism and de
votion of that large portion of our army,
which, although eager to be ordered to
the post of greatest exposure, fortunately
was not required outside of the United
States." They did their whole duty and
earned the gratitude of the nation. The
president then says:
"In tracing those events we are con
stantly reminded of our obligations to
the Divine Master for his watchful care
over us, and his safe guidance, for which
tho nation makes reverent acknowledg
ment and offers humble prayer for the
continuance of his favors."
The peace negotiations which followed
soon after the capitulation of Santiago,
and the preparation and signing of tho
protocol are discussed at length. Refer
ring to the work of the peace commission
ers in Paris the president says:
"These negotiations have made hopeful
progress, so that I trust soon to be able to
lay a definite treaty before the senate,
with a review of the steps leading to its
signature."
Our New Possessions.
"I do not discuss at this time the gov
ernment or tenure of the new possessions
which will come to us ps the result of
the war with Spain. Such discussion will
bs appropriate after the treaty of peace
shall be ratified. In the meantime and un
til the congress has legislated otherwise,
it will be my duty to continue the mil
itary governments which have existed
since our occupation, and give to the peo
ple security in life and property, and en
couragement under a just and beneficient
rule.
"As coon as we are in possession of
Cuba ar.d have pacified the island it will
be necessary to give aid and direction to
its people to form a government for
themselves. This should be undertaken
at the earliest moment consistent with
safety, and assured success. It is im
portant tiiat our relations with this peo
pla should be of tbo most friendly char
acter, and our commercial relations close
and reciprocal. It should be our duty to
assist in every proper way to build up the
waste places of the island, encourage the
industry of the people and assist them to
form a government which shall be free
and independent, thus realizing the best
aspirations of the Cuban people.
"Spanish rule must be replaced by a
Just, benevolent and humane government,
created by the people of Cuba, capable of
performing all international obligations
and which shall encourage thrift, industry
and prosperity, and promote neace and
gocd will among all of the inhabitants,
whatever may have been their relations In
the past. Neither revenge nor passion
should have a. place in the new govern
ment. Until there is complete tranquillity
in the island and a stable government
erected, military occupation will be con
tinued."
The president says that with the one
instance of the interruption of intercourse
with Spain, the relations of the United
States with the family of nations during
the past year has been characterized by
cordiality. Concerning negotiations with
the Argentina government with a view
to removing differences in cable rate
charges imposed against messages passing
from and to tlie United States, the presi
dent expresses his sincere hope of an
international agreement whereby inter
change of messages over connecting lines
may be regulated on a fair basis of uni
formity, and adds:
"it would be strange were the nations
not in time brought to realize that mod
ern civilization, which owes so much of
its progress to the annihilation of time by
the electrical force demands that this all
important means of communication be a
heritage of peoples, to be administered and
regulated in their common behalf."

what surveys l.ave been made or what

embraced In the report of the canal com

the urgency of some definite action by
the congress at this session, if the labors
of the past are to be utilized, and the
Uniting of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
by a practical waterway is to be realized.
That the construction of such a mari
time highway is now more than ever in
dispensable to that intimate and really
inter-communication between our eastern
and western seaboards, is demanded by
the annexation of the Hawaiian islands
and the prospective expansion of our in
fluences and commerce to the Paoilic, and
that our national policy now more im
peratively than ever calls for its control
by this government are propositions
which, I doubt not, the congress will duly
appreciate and wisely act upon.
Concerning the extraordinary events
transpiring in the Chinese empire, the
president says that our position among
nations gives the equitable aim to con
sideration and friendly treatment in this
lvfeaiu, anu that it will be his aim to
subserve our large interests in the Orient
by ail means appropriate to the constant
policy of our government.

It will give me especial satisfaction if I
shall be authorized to communicate to
you a favorable conclusion of the pending
negotiations with Great Britain in respect
to the Dominion of Canada, it is the ear
nest wish of this government to remove
ail sources of discord and irritation in our
relations with the neighboring dominion.
The trade between the two countries is
constantly increasing, and it is important
to both countries that all reasonable fa
cilities should be granted for its develop
ment.
Pending the consideration by the senate
of the treaty signed June 10, 1807, by the
plenipotentiaries of the United States and
of the Republic of Hawaii, providing for
the annexation of the islands, a joint reso
lution to accomplish the same purpose
by the accepting the offered cession and
incorporating the ceded territory into the
Union was adopted by the congress and
approved July 7, 180S. I thereupon direct,
ed the United States steamer Philadelphia
to convey Rear Admiral Miller to Hono
lulu, and entrusted to his hands this im
portant legislative act, to be delivered to
the president of the Republic of Hawaii,
with whom the admiral and the United
States minister were authorised to make
appropria\e arrangements i'or transfer
ring the sovereignty of the islands to the
United States. This was simple, but im
pressively acocmplished on the 12th day
of August last, by thq delivery of a cer
tified copy of the resolution to President
Dole, who thereupon yielded up to the
representative of the government of the
United States the sovereignty and public
property of the Hawaiian islands.
Pursuant to the term of the joint reso
lution, and in exercise of the authority
thereby conferred upon me, I directed
that the civil, judicial and military pow
ers theretofore exercised by the offl
ers of the government of the Republic of
Hawaii should continue to be exercised
by those officers until congress shall pro
vide a government for the incorporated
territory subject to my power to remove
such officers and to fill vacancies. The
president, officers and troops of the re
public -thereupon took the oath of alle
giance to the United States, thus providing

of Illinois Sanford B. Dole, of Hawaii,

Hawaiian islands as they should deem
proper. The commissioners having ful

their report will be laid before you

will benefit both in the highest degree,

I have the satisfaction of being able to
State that the bureau of the American re
publics, created In 1U0, as the orfgan for
promoting commercial Intercourse and
fraternal reflations among the countries of
the Western hemisphere, has become a
most efficient Instrument of the wise pur
pose of its founders, and is receiving tho
cordial support of the countries of the in
ternational union which are actually rep
resented in its board of management. A
commercial directory In two volumes, con
taining a mass of statistical matter de
scriptive of industrial and commercial ine
terests of the various countries, has been
printed in English, Spanish, Portuguese
and French, and a monthly bulletin pub
lished in these four languages and dis
tributed in the Latin-American coun
tries sa well as in the United States,
has proved to be a valuable medium for
disseminating Information and furthering
the varied interests of the international
union.
Alluding to the financial affairs of tho
country, the president says in part:
"The secretary of the treasury reports
that the receipts of the government from
all sources during the fiscal ve-ar ended
June 30. 189S. including !MS4,?51.223 re
ceived from sale of Pacific railroads,
an ounted to !M0r.:t21 ,:«5 and its ex
penditures to .?44j,308,582.
"It is estimated upon the basis of pres
ent revenue laws, that the receipts of the
government for the year ending June 30,
1899, will bo .fri77.R74.fi47 and its expendl
tures $084,874,047, resulting in a deficiency
of $112,000,000.
Currency Legislation.
"In my judgment, the present condition
of the treasury amply justifies the Imme
diate enactment of tho legislation recom
mended one year ago, under which a por
tion 01 the gold holdings should be placed
a,
trust fund from which greenbacks
should be redeemed ut.on presentation,
but when cneo redeemed should rot there
after be paid out except for gold.
"/t's not to be inferred that other legis
lation relating to our currency is not re
quired on the contrary, there is an obvi
ous demand for it."
T?1® importance of adequate provision,
which will insure to our future a money
standard related as our money standard
now is to that of our commercial rivals, is
generally recognized.
The companion proposition that our do
mestic paper currency should be kept
safe, and yet be so related to the needs of
our Industrie's and international com
merce as to be adequate and responsive
to such needs, is a proposition scarcely
less important. The subject in all its
parts is recommended to the wise consid
eration of the congress.
The president says that in view of the
recent acquisition of territory by the
United States, there should be established
regular and frequent steamship com
munication, under the American flag with
the nowly acquired islands.
In view, also, of the increased Impor
tance of the proposed formation of a com
mission of sanitary experts to investigate
the yellow fever problem, owing to the
military occupation of Cuba, the presi
dent recommends that congress should
provide for such commission.
The Army.
Under ths act of congress approved
April 2C, 1898, and authorizing the presi
dent in his discretion, upon a declaration
of war by congress or a declaration by
congress that war efxists, I directed tho
Increase of the regular army to the max
imum of 02,000 authorized in said act.
There are now in the regular army
67,802 officers and men. In said act It
was provided "that at the end of any
war in which the United States may be
come involved the army shall be reduced
to a peace basis by tho transfer in the
same arm of the service or absorption by
promotion or honorable discharge under
sueh regulations $s the secretary of war
may establish of supernumerary commis
sioned officers and the. honorable dis
charge or transfer of supernumerary en
listed men, and nothing contained in this
act shall be construed as authorizing the
permanent increase of the commissioned
or enlisted force of the regular army be
yond that now provided by the law in
force prior to the passage of this act ex
cept as to the increase of twenty-five
majors provided for in section 1 thereof."
The importance of legislation for the
permanent increase of the army is there
fore manifest and the recommendation of
the secretary of war for that purpose has
my unqualified approval. There can be
no question that at this time and probably
for some time in tho future, one hundred
thov.sand men will be none too many to
meet the necessities of the situation. At
all events whether that number shall be
required permanently or not the power
should be given to the president to enlist
that force if in his discretion it shall be
necessary and the further discretion
should be given him to recruit within the
above limit from the inhabitants of the
islands with the government of which we
are charged.
It is my purpose to muster out the en
tire volunteer army as soon as the con
gress shall provide for the increase of the
regular establishment. This will be only
an act of justice and will be much ap-

The following recommendations of the
secretary of the navy, relative to the in
crease of the navy, have my earnest ap
proval
First—Three sea-going sheathed and cop
pered battlesih'ips of about 13,500 tons
trial displacement, carrying the heaviest
armor and most powerful ordnance for
vessels of their class and to have the
highest practicable speed and greatest
radius of' action. Estimated cost, exclu
sive of armor and armament, $3,000,000
each.
Second—Three sheathed and copr°red
armored cruisers of about 12.000 tons Tnal
displacement, carrying the heaviest armor
and most powerful ordnance for vessels
of their class, and to have the highest
practicable speed and greatest radius of
action. Estimated cost, exclusive of ar
mor and armament. $4,000,000 each.
Third—Three sheathed and coppered pro
tected cruisers of about 0,000 tons trial
displacement, to have the highest practic
able speed and great radius of action, and
to carry the most powerful ordnance suit
able for vessels of their class. Estimated
cos*, exclusive of armor and armament,
$2,150,000 each.
Fourth—Six sheathed and coppered
cruisers of about 2.500 tons trial displace
ment to have the highest speed compati
ble with good cruising qualities, great
radius of action and to carry the most
powerful ordnance suited to vessels or
their class. Estimated cost, exclusive of
armamemt. $1,140.SOO each.
I join with the secretary of the navy
In recommending that the grades of ad
miral and vice admiral be temnorarily
revived to be 11
led with officers who have
especially distinguished themselves in the
war with Spain.
The special attention of the congress is
called to that part of the report of the
secretary of the interior In relation to the
five civilized Indian tribes. It is note
worthy that the gen»ral condition of the
Indian shows marked progress. But one
outbreak of a serious character occurred
during the year, and that among the Chip
pewa. Indians of Minnesota, which happily
has been supressed.
While it has not yet been practicable to
enforce all the provisions of the act of
June 28, 1808, "for the protection of the
people of the Indian Territory and for
other purposes," it is having a salutary
effect upon the nations composing the tive
tribes. The Dawes commission reports
that the most gratifying results and great
er advance toward the attainment of the
ou.ects of the government have been se
cured in the past year than in any previ
ous year.
I cannot too strongly indorse the rec
ommendations of the commission and of
the secretary of the Interior for the neces
sitv of providing for the education of the
80.000 white children resident in the In
dian Territory.-
Public Lands.
The pvbllc lands disposed of by the gov
ernment during the year reached 8,453,
896.92 acres, an increase of 614,780.26 acres
over the previous year. The total receipts
amounted to $2,277,995.18, an increase of
$190,003.90 over the preceding year. The
lands embraced In the eleven forest res
ervations. which were suspended by the
act of June 4, 1897, again become subject
to the operations' of the proclamations
of Feb. 22, 1897,. creating them, which
added an estimated amount of 19,931,360
acres to the area embraced In the reserves
previously created. In addition thereto
two new reserves were created during the
jw, the Pine Vorrolala «mi
reserve in California, embracing l.M4*S«
acres, and the Preacott reserve, hi
Arizona, embracing 10,220 acres, while the
Pecos River reserve in New Mexico
been changed and enlarged to include 120,
000 additional acres.
At the close of the year thirty forest
reservations, not Including those of ths
Afogonac forests and the fish culture
reservation in Alaska, have been created
by proclamation under section 84 of the
act of March 3, 1891, embracing an esti
mated area of 40,719,474 acres.
The department of the interior has In
augurated a forest system, made possible
by the act of July, 1898, for a graded
force of officers in control of the reserves.
This system has only been in full opera*
tlon since August, but good results have
already been secured in many sections.
The reports received indicate that the
system of patrol has not only prevented
destructive fires from gaining headway,
but has diminished the number of fire9.
Promoting Agriculture.
The department of agriculture has been
active in the past year. Explorers have
been sent to maniy of the countries of the
Eastern and Western hemispheres
tor
seeds and plar.'ts that may toe useful t®
the United States, and with the further
view of opening up markets for our sur
plus products. The forestry division of
the department is giving special attention
to the treeless regions of our country, and
is Introducing species especially adapted
to semi-arid regions. Forest tires, wmch
seriously intevtere with production, es
pecially in irrigated regions are being
studied that the losses from this cause
may be avoided. The department is in
quiring into the use and abuse of water In
many states of the West and coileciuiig
information regarding 'the laws of then
states, the decisions of the courts and the
customs of the people in this regard so
tha't uniformity may be secured.
Experimental stations are becoming
more valuable every year. The appropria
tion of $702,000 by congress is supple
mented by $40*3.000 from the stations.
Nation wide experiments have been con
ducted to ascertain the suitableness as to
soil and climate and states for growing
sugar beets. The number of beet sugar
factories has been doubled in the past two
years, and the ability of the Uluted
States to produce its own sugar from this
source has been clearly demonstrated.
The weather bureau forecast and ob
servation stations have been extended
around the Caribbean sea to give early
warning of the approach of hurricanes
from the south seas to our fleets and mer
chant marine.
I earnestly urge upon congress the im
portance of early legislation providing for
the taking of the twelfth ceasus. JLMs
is necessary in view of the larpre amount
of work which must be performed in the
preparation of the schedules preparatory
to the enumeration of the population.

There were on the pension rolls on June
30, 1898, 993,714 names, an increase of
nearly 18,000 over the number on the rolls
on the samo day of the preceding year.
The amount of the appropriation by act
of Dec. 22. Ife96, for the payment of pen
sions for the fiscal year 180S was $140,000,

hundred and seventy-two dollars and
forty-six cents was appropriated by the
act of March 3, 1898, to cover deficiencies
in army pensions, and repayment in the
sum of $12,020.33, making a total of $148,
082,892.79 available for the 1 ayment of
pensions during the fiscal year 1898. The
amount disbursed from that sum was

BEARS AS SLY AS FOXES.
Tliey Throw Lumps of Ice at Wal
ruses to Stun and Capture Them.
London Telegraph: In his native home
the polar bear dors not often meet with
small boys anxious to treat him to buns
and other dainties. The consequence is
that Bruin has to devise many curious
ways of securing his food, and none are
more strange and interesting than that
related by two trustworthy travelers in
Greenland, that country of strange sights.
They have known the polar bear to take
a stone or a huge lump of ice in his
fore paws and from a favorable height,
as a cliff or a precipitous ice hill, to
hurl the missile down upon the head of
a walrus—an enormouse brute, often
twice the size of a bear—and so stun him'
that Bruin could rush in and complete
the destruction at his leisure, thus secur
ing a month's rations.
The most useful food of the Ice bear,
as the Germans very appropriately call
this beast, is the common seal of the
arctic regions. The latter is the wariest
animal of the north, and both Eskimo
and polar bear need their best strategy
to catch it.
In the summer time, when the snow Is
off the Ice of the ocean shore and islets,
the seals can be plainly seen as black
dots on the ice, probably asleep, but
always near their holes, which lead down
through the thick ice to the water below,
and into which they can throw them
selves by the least movement. Bryin,
seeing one afar, walks up as near as he
deems safe, and then begins crawling
on his wary prey.
The seal, if the weather be sunny and
pleasant, takes short naps, relieved by
shorter moments when it is scanning the
vicinity for signs of an enemy's approach.
During these times the bear is very quiet
and as still as death itself, with eyes ap
parently closed, though really a corner of
each is kept open, and in this way he
hopes the seal will take him for a heap
of snow, an appearance which his coat
readily helps him to assume.
During the naps he creeps forward with
greater or less rapidity, according to his
nearness to the seal and consequent fear
of being heard or seen. When but ten
or twelve yards away, and the seal is in
the depths of a good nap, the bear rushes
upon him, and with a single blow of his
powerful paw knocks the smaller brute
senseless and so far away from the hole
that he cannot escape by that way, even
if the blow received is not immediately
fatal.
In winter time the ice is covered with
snow, and this is hollowed out by the seal
into a snow house, covering the hole in
the ice and connecting at the top of the
dome with an aperture about the size of a
shilling, callfd the blow hole, for it is
through this that the seal breathes when
he is in want of fresh air.
Here the bear watches for many a long
hour, if necessary, and when the snorts of
the seal are heard he crushes in the frag
ile dome of the snow house with his paw,
impaling the seal on his curved claws,
and proceeds to practically demonstrate
how polar bears can subsist in an arctic
winter.
