WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1887.
OUR STATESMAN PRESIDENT.
Have our readers, or any of them, ever
taken opportunity of reading what by
habit is called the Queen's speech at the
opening and prorogation of the British
Parliament) In reality it is the manifesto
of ministers, and the chief object appears
to be a concealment of legislative inten
tions,, or a glorification of legislative
achievements. - Relations with Foreign
Powers are rejoiced in or deplored as occa
sion serves; the "faithful Commons" are
thanked for the liberality of money sup
plies, and that is all; save, indeed, when
the speech is supplemented by recommenda
tions of greater rigor in dealing with the
mere Irish. And to all these unsatisfac
tory pronouncements meant to conceal
design according to diplomatic ideal there
is ever and always a marked ungram
matacism that would shame the children of
our Common Schools.
With pride we turn to the contrast
which our own "Royal Speech" furnishes
Royal,in that it is the voice of the repre
sentative of the people's sovereignty; and
never in the history of such messages was
there one presented so logical in its array
of facts, so comprehensive in its calcula
tions of the future, so liberal in its esti
mate of home right and international du
ties, in a word, so marked by all the at
tributes which should dignify the ruler of
a great nation, actuated by honest desire
for the nation's prosperity.
And yet they are not happy. Strike
high, strike low, there is no pleasing them,
as the flogging drum-major once observed
"when a soldier victim at the triangle
winced under the cat-o-nine tails. Strike
high, strike low, there is no pleasing the
Republicans of the old-time intolerant
stripe. Keep a glut of money in the treas
ury vaults and the cry would be of wealth
lying in unproductive idleness. . Make
proposition to scatter the hoard broadcast
in the country, to redeem government ob
ligations and save the vast amount paid by
coupons to the bond-holders; to revive
trade by a more extensive circulation of
cash; to remove obstructions to our trade
by a more liberal interpretation of inter
national legislation; to come down, as it
were, to recognition of a Tariff charge
for the needs of revenue only, and on such
commodities as would not interfere with the
industry of our own country, and the just
requital of our own workers. And then
the cry is upraised: "the thin end of the
wedge of free trade is forced in, and our
own labor is threatened in the interests of
wnen snail the prosperity or tne coun
try rise in Republican view superior to the
prejudices of party? "Free Trade" they cry
out in horror unmindful or ignorant of
what Free Trade is. , We are not Free Tra
ders in the ordinary acceptation of the
t9rm we would not have our markets
crowded with the porducts of foreign
workmen without protective measures for
home industry; we would not have the
cheap labor of Europe allowed fo compete
with the honest workmen of this conti
nent; but we would not stretch the pro
tsction too far or shut out by high imposts
or any imposts the raw material that would
but conduce to the promotion of our in
dustry or those articles of vertu and so
forth, which would not only not interfere
with home labor, but promote it, or at all
events lead to increase the material weaith
possessed by the country.
But what need to argue on these points?
Common sense is already convinced. Party
prejudice will never yield a jot. It is suffi
cient that this great ref orm is the recom
mendation of a Democrat to have it de
nounced as a measure of industrial de
struction. The nation will, however, sur
vive the false prophecies; and the message
submitted to the Fiftieth Congress will
stand for all time as the inauguration of a
system of government favorable to our
selves and just to all peoples.
THE DEMOCRAT CRITICIZED.
Of course we were prepared for criticism;
criticism in social circles criticism in
the public press, but we did not calculate
on a private correspondence, in respect to
some of our views which, declaredly, not
being intended for publication we cannot
reply to in detail, and to which, not hav
ing time at disposal we cannot answer by
letter. The writer puts his case plausibly;
he is evidently a zealous adherent of the
TT i .
nenry ueorge movement or wnat was a
movement and he strongly objects to our
animadversions on that distinguished gen
tleman's theories, their impracticalness
and impracticability.
We beg to assure our good friend, who
honors us by his comments, that we did
A 1 1 ( 11 11 " a
not aecry or oemue ine iaea involved in
the phrase "The Fatherhood of God, the
. Brotherhood of Man," but merely question
ed its use as the motto of a movement
which however it might admit the divine
Fatherhood exhibited no positive or prac
tical means by which the human Brother
hood could be presented. Our amateur
critic may have heard,or heard of, the one
time great musical entertainer, Henry Rus
sell. In his repertoire was a song with the
refrain:
"There's a good time coming boys,
But Wait a little longer."
One nicht an enthusiastic . Hibernian
interrupted the entertainer, saying
"Mr Russell if you please." There
was dead silence; when the Voice continued
"We've waited long enough, sir Could
you fix the time?" Now Mr George never
fixed the time of his universal brotherhood.
Dr MeGlynn had nota word to say as to
the probable date for fulfillment of the
pledge. "The platform rung with applause,
but the people received no benefit until, at
length and let our critic take it to heart
the eyes of those most' interested m the
theoretic teachings were opened to their
realistic absurdity as witness the de
crease of Mr George's vote this year in the
City and County of New York from the
vote for the Mayoralty in the year preced
ing. In courtesy we notice our critic's objec
tions, but we really have not time or space
to consider what stands in the condition of
a private anonymous letter. . If he can
show us there is any of God's poor to
whom a Christmas beneficence would be
unacceptable, we shall share in his pride;
if he point that Mr George's land and labor
schemes render unnecessary the exercise of
Christian charitv at Christmas time, we
shall hold our peace; but with all good feel
ing we would inform our correspondent
that we edit the Democrat nere in our
office, and do not favor an assumed ama
teur editorship by proxy on. the part of
outsiders..
Here is a point in the President's mes
sage worthy the attention of working men:
The great State paper says : "The simple
and plain duty which we owe the people is
to reduce taxation to the necessary expen
ses of an economical operation of the gov
ernment and to restore to the business of
the country the money which we hold in
the ' treasury through the perversion of
governmental powers. These things can
and should,, be done with safety to all our
industries, without danger to the opportu
nity for remunerative labor which our
workingmen need, and with " benefit to
them all our people, by cheapening their
means of subsistence and increasing the
measure of their comfort.
The New York Star "the bright par
ticular Star" in our Democratic firmament
prides in the fact that the three great
events of 1887 in Democratic politics have
happened in the closing quarter of the
year. Enumerated in chronological order
they are : l. The platform of the New
York Democracy adopted at the Saratoga
convention. 2. The address of Speaker
Carlisle at the opening of the Fiftieth Con
gress. 3. The President's tax reduction
message." The identity of purpose and
method disclosed in these three great dec
larations evinces the admirable union of
the Democratic party of the country, as
leaders and rank and file animated by
devotion to a common faith, march on to
gether to the crowning victory of 1888.
The Free Trade that is Fair Trade
the international relations of industry that
will duly protect our labor, interests the
great principle of rightful dealing the
world over all find expression in one brief
passage of the President's message. He
writes: "The considerations which .have
been presented touching our tariff 1 laws
are intended only to enforce an earnest
recommendation that the surplus revenues
of the government be prevented by the re
duction of our customs duties, and at the
same time to emphasize a suggestion that
in accomplishing this purpose we may dis
charge a double duty to our people by
granting to them a measure of relief from
tariff taxation in quarters where it is most
needed and from sources where it can be
most fairly and justly accorded.
m
We have "fluttered the Volsces at
Corioli." Yesterday London and the man
ufacturing centres of England were in com
motion aroused by the message to Congress
of President Cleveland. They didn't know
what to make of it, you know. The "St
James Gazette" refers to the President's
action as a remarkably sudden and alto
gether surprising move, and in support of
its criticisms of the message, quotes Lord
Overstone's assertion that "the commerce
of England would receive its first crushing
blow when Free Trade should be adopted
in the United States." That's the point;
we don't want to crush England's com
meree, but we want to promote our own
industry, and the sooner working men in
this country refuse to be influenced by the
special pleadings and specious designs of
capitalist advocates the better for them
selves and for the country.
Yes, that's it, in the England of to-day;
and we are not far from being amenable
to the same humiliating charges in this
country. Fist and feet before mind and
manners; brawn ahead of brain in esti
mate and rewards. Daniel U Jueary can
make tens of thousands a week by a' 'walk-as-you-please"
in the arena, while the toil
er for the press may starve on a pittance
in the garret; and pugilists will grow rich
while the penman may sink in i poverty,
We read to-day that the profits of John L.
Sullivan's tour are $3,000 a week. He has
been loaded, moreover, with social honors,
in the shape of nnmerous invitations to
dinner from . lords and dukes, has been
made an honorary member of the Pelican
club, and is soon to spar before the Prince
of Wales. The pen is mightier than the
sword, but in this age a big pair of biceps
are better than either.
Our esteemed local contemporary, the
"Republican," is evidently in the throes of
a great party perturbation and scents
"treasons, stratagems and spoils" in the
air. It gives the report of the President's
message all the adventitious aid of por
tentous head lines: "Free Trade Flag'1
"President Cleveland Unfurls the Banner"
"His Message a Menace to the Prosperity
of the Country" "It will Elect a Republi
can Next Year." As O'Connell said in the
H.nghsh House of Commons in relation . to
the oath of abjuration and supremacy
"One part of the declaration we know to
be false the other we believe to be un
true." It is false that there is menace or
danger to the country; it is probably un
true wholly untrue that the country will
elect a Republican as next President. There
is no likelihood that we can foresee of Mr
Cleveland changing his party color.
