Question was decided at the mouth of the

that those States had not gone out ot the

Union tinder any circumstances whatever.
Everything was used to . make good , that
determination. The South, finding that
the Northern people were thus determined,
iaii' they, unable to go out of the Union,
threw down their arms and agreed, thence
fbrth to abide with us in the Union. Hence,
the question for our consideration1 is: Shall
we abide by the written terms of the Con-

Message.

?
Tlie following i the portion' of "PW'Jf
Jonal -Governor .Johnson's mossago to ,tho
Georgia. legislature which refers to the po
litical relations pi the JState to the. Govere
"olf th l)t of February lasifc thntNM
of the United State by Joint Resolution,
proposed to the Legislatures ot the several
States of the Union an amendment to the
Constitution ot the United States declaring
that hereafter neither slavery nor involun
tary servitude, except for crime, should ex
it iu the United States, or lu any place
subject to their Jurisdiction; and that Cou
gre&s should have power to enforce the pro
posed article by appropriate legislation.
A copy of the proposed ameuUiueut is at-
attached, and it is submitted to the consid
eration of the Legislature with the hope
and desire that It may be adopted and ratl
lled. A very common objection is made to
U on the ground that it may confer, by im
plication, on Congress the power ol regu
lating, generally, the Internal iiollcy of the
State. Such i construction is believed to
be erroneous, and unfounded and unwar
ranted, either by the language employed or
the objects sought to be attained.
The Constitution of the United States
confers, among other things, npon Congref s
thepowecto regulate commerce with lor
elgn nations and among the States, to de
clare war, to raise and support armies, and
to provide lor calling forth the militia." It is
further provided, that Congress shall have
power to make all laws which shall be
necessary and proper to carry Into execu
tion these enumerated powers; but It has
never been contended that, because of such
authority, Congress was thereby invested
with the right to abolish State courts, to
oreRerlbe theouallticatlon ot Jurors, or to
declare who should exercise the right of
suffrage.- 'Moreover this amendment Is
strictly cumulative, and it is not Intended
by it, either to repeal or modify any. of the
existing provisions of the Constitution:
and, theretore, it will still be for the several
States to prescribe, each lor Itself, who
shall be electors for the most numerous
branch ot their assemblies; and, as a con
sequence, who shall be qualified electors for
members ot cougress. - i .
-. The Comrress nassinK It, the different de
partments ul the Goverumeut, and most of
the Legislatures of the several Status rati
fying it, construe the amendment to be
both ieff more or less than a declaration
against Involuntary servitude, conferring
therewith on Congressthe restricted power
tnna.ro that fin. I u I'll t Intl 1 1I tl P V Pfll 1.11111 hv
necesary and proper laws. Such is the
natural import of the lauguage employed,
ami such, doubtless, will be tue coustruc-
tlon given it by the dillerent departments
of the Government in all controversies that
may hereafter arise,. Under other circum
stances, a proposition to ratity such sn
amendment, would not be entertained by
you. 'Although the "cannon's roar and the
trumpet's clangor are uo longer heard,'?
society still moves on In its resistless way,
and it Is necessary that we should xccom-
niouate our. action u tue incxorauxe ue
inands of Inevitable, results, that the pcr
hianent wellare of our peoplo may be se
cured and our State restored to her former
political rights and relations.
Georgia has,, in good faith, abolished
slavery. She could not revive It if she
would; and the ratification of this amend
ment will make the people of the United
States- homogeneous will remove from
among us that cause of bitterness and sec
tional strife which has wasted our prpperty
and deluged our land in blood. Further
more, bvyiclding to this requlrementreadl;
Iy, we shall submit a most effectual argu
ment, tending to open the balls of the Na
tional Legislature, and the strongest pie:
that . oould be addressed to thecjemency and
of the Government.

Tennessee Loyalty.
;
; The telegraph has informed us that the
bill allowing blacks to testify lu the Courts
of Tennessee, which passed the Senate by
10 to 0. has been defeated In tile Ilouse by
30 to 27 the East Tennessee Unionists gen
erally opposing, while many of the ex-rebels
supported it. This is what we had been
led to expect. Those East Tennessee Un
ionists have been permitted, by a weak and
worthless Union General commanding and
a reverend blackguard who is styled Governor,
to murder two or three negroes to balance
ench of the paroled and returned rebel aolr
diers whom tirey have seen lit likewise to
dispatch, until they have good reason to
deprecate the admission of pegrp testimony;
for it would hang hundreds of them if there
wa? any semblance of law or Justice in that
region. According to our Information, not

should guarantee the freedbm and legal

Under date of Washington, December

It Is a somewhat singular fact that nearly

Daniel Worth. Just elected Governor of
that State, to Mr. Holden. the Provisional

from North Carolina, Including such ftiflil

Holden was an ardents -cessionist, While Mr.
Worth opposed secession before and during

through Lis personal poHilrlty. Undftubt
edlv a larire number ol men who were at

him, because tncy believed ninr noneat ana

Worth has at all times been a Union roan,
