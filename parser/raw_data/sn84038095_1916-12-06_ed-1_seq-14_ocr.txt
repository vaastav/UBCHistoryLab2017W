N "one of the shortest messages
ever tent to congress- President'
Wilson urges that early. action
be taken, to complete his pro
gra o:f "settlement, and, regulation'*
recommended at the last session. The
message In full is as follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this tlm6 the duty
'laid upon me by the constitution of
'communicating to you from time to
.time .information of the state of the
I then recommended:
First, immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the Interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
In the bill recently passed by the house
of representatives and now awaiting
action by the senate in order that the
commission may be enabled to deal
with the many great and various du
ties now devolving upap It with
promptness and thoroughness which
are, with its present constitution and
means of action, practicall^lmposslble.
Second, the establishment
6f
an eight
hour day as the legal basis alike of
work and of wages In the employment'
of all railway employees who are ac
tually engaged In the work of operat
ing trains in Interstate transportation.
Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
salts in expedience of the adoption of
the eight hour day In railway, transpor
tation alike for the men and for the
railroads.
Fourth, cxpllclt approval by the con
gress of tile consideration by the in
terstate commerce commission of an
Increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary bjr. the adoption of, the eight
hour dajr^oid which have not been off
set bjr* administrative readjustments
add economies, should the facts dis
closed justify the increase.
Ftfth, an amendment of the existing
federal Statute which provides for the
mention, conciliation and arbitration
o'f'such controverfties as the present by
adding to It a provision that, in case
the methods of accommodation now
provided for should fail, a full public
Investigation of the merits of every
such dispute shall be instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
Control by the Executive, f,'
And, sixth, the lodgment In the
bands, of the executive of the power,
4n case of milttary necessity, to take
c00tHl)0f such portions and such roll
tog staqk «f the railways of th»:coun
for solitary
Vl|'Md to operate them for. jpUitary
Barpoees/.wlth authority to draft Into
^ailltary service of th^, United
States 'soch train crews and admlhis
tratlfe officials! as the circumstances
require for their safe and efficient use.
The second and thtad of these rec
ommendations the Congress immediate
ly acted on: It established the eight
hovr day as the legal basis of work
and wages In train service and it au
thorised the appointment of a commis
sion to observe and report upon the
'practical results, deeming these the
measures most Immediately needed, but
It postponed action upon the other, sug
gestionsuntil an opportunity should be
oftlertd for a more deliberate consider
ation of th^m.
The fourth recommendation I dp not
deem it necessary to renew. The pow-
OPERATION OF RAILWAYS
SHALL NOT BE STOPPED
To pais a law whieh forbade or
prevented the individual work
man to leave hi* work before re
ceiving the approval of society
in doing s»^ would bo to adopt a
new principle into our jurispru
dence which I take it tor grant
ed we are not prepared to intro
duce. But the proposal that the
operation of the railways of the
country ehall rift be stopped or
interrupted by the concerted ac
tion of organized bodies of mtfn
until a public investigation shall
haVe been instituted which shall
make the whole question at is
sue plain for the judgment of the
opinion of the nation Is not to
propose any euch principle. It is
based upon the very different
principle that the concerted ac
tion of powerful bodies of men
ehall not be permitted to stop the
industrial processee of the na
tion.
Union and recommending to your con
•Ideratlon such legislative measures as er of thfe-interstate commence conntils
Tittay be Judged necessary and expedl- slon to grant an Increase of rates (in
"^cnt I shall conQnue the practice, which
hope lias been acceptable to you, of
Reaving to the .reports of the several
lieads o| the executive departments
the elaboration of the detailed needs
of the mblic service and confine my
self to those matters of more general
-public policy with which it seems nec
'essary and feasible to deal at the pve»
W session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestlons as few as possible. But there
^were some things left undone at the
last session which there will now be1
time to complete and which it seems
necessary in the interest of the public
£o do at once.
The Railroad Problem.
the first place, it seems to me im
peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action
should be accorded the remaining
measures )f the program of settlement
•nd regulation wl^ch I had occasion to
recommend to you at the close of your
last session in view of the public dan
gers disclosed by the unaccommodated
difficulties Which then existed and
which still unhappily continue to ex
ist between the railroads of the covfn
tiy .and thelr locomotlvie engineers,
conductors and trainmen.
the ground referred to is indisputably
clear, and: a recommendation by itlje
congress with regard to such a matter
might seem to draw in question the
scope of the commission's authority or
its inclination to dp justice wheo^here
is no reason to doubt either.
The other suggestion's—the increase
in the Interstate commerce commit
sion's membership and in its facilities
for performing its manifold duties, the
provision for full public Investigation
and assessment of industrial disputes,
and the grant to the executive of the
power to control and operate the rail
ways when necessary in time of war or
otBer like public necessity—I now very
earnestly renew.
New Legislation Necessary.
The necessity for such legislation Is
manifest and pressing. Those who have
intrusted us with the responsibility
and duty of serving and safeguarding
them in such matters would find It
hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to
Act upon these grave matters or. any
unnecessary postponement of action.
Not only does the interstate com
merce commission now find it practical
ly, impossible, with its present member
ship and organization, to perform its
great functions promptly and thorough
ly, but it is not unlikely that it may
presently be found advisable to add MS
Its duties still-others equally heavy and
exacting. It must first be perfected as
an administrative instrument.
The cbuntry cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to. profound Industrial disturbances
for lack of additional means of arbi
tration and conciliation which the con-.
gross can easily and promptly supply.
And all will agree t*. there must be
no doubt as to the power of the execu
tive to pake immediate and uninter
rupted, use of the railroads for the con
centration of the mliltarr. forces
Such
tobacco
enjoyment
as you never thought
could be is yours to
comm&nd quick as
you buy some Prince
Albert and fire-up a
pipe or a home-made
cigarette!
Prince Albert gives
you every tobacco sat
isfaction your smoke
appetite ever hankered
for. That's because
it's made by a patented
process that cuts out
bite and parch! Prince Albert has always
been sold without coupons or premiums.

Urges the Passage of the
Corrupt Practices Act Reg
ulating the Expenditure of
Money In Elections and Fa
vors More Freedom of Com
bination to Those Engaged
In Foreign Commerce.
This is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative efficiency
which argues its own case in the mere
statement of it. With regard to one of
its items, the Increase in the efficiency
of the interstate commerce commission,
the house of representatives has al
ready acted. Its action needs only, the
concurrence of the senate.
To Safeguard Industrial Processes.
I would hesitate to recohimend, and
I dare says the congress would hesitate
to act upon the suggestion should I
makg it, that any man in any occapa
'tlon' 'should be obliged by law 'to con
tin^a In ,an employment'which he de
slretf^o Jfeaye.
To pass "a law which forbade or pre
vented the individual workman to leave'
his work before receiving the appepval
of society fy doing so would be to
adopt a new principle into our juris
prudence. which I take It for granted
we are not prepared to introduce. But
the proposal that the operation of the
railways of the country shall not be
stopped or Interrupted by the concert
ed action of organized bodies of men
until a public investigation shall have
been instituted which shall make the
whole question at issue plain for the
judgment of the opinion of the nation
is not to propose fny such principle.
It is based updn the very different
principle that the concerted action of
powerful bodies of men shall not be
permitted to stop the industrial pro
uiessies of the nation, at any rate before
the. nation shall have had an opportu
nity to acquaint itself with the. merits
of the case as between employee and
employer, time to lorm its opinion upon
an impartial statement of the merits,
and opportunity to condjder all practi
cably means of conciliation or arbitra
tioiL
I can see nothing in that proposition
but the Justifiable safeguarding by so
ciety of the necessary processes of Its
very life. There is nothing arbitrary
or unjust In it unless it be .arbitrarily
and unjustly done. It can and should
be done with a fall and scrupulous re
gard for the interests and liberties of
all concerted- as well as for the per
manent interests of society itself.
Three matters of capital importance
await the action of the senate which
have already been acted upon by the
house of representatives—the bill which
seeks to: extend greater freedom of
combination to those engaged in pro­
V'"'"
THE DENISON REVIEW, WEDNESDAY, DEC. 6, 1916.
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than Is now thought by some
to be legal uhder the terms of the
laws against monopoly, the bill amend
ing the present organic law of~Porto
Rico and the bill proposing a more
thorough and systematic regulation of
the expenditure of money in elections,
commonly called the corrupt practices
act. I need not labor my advice thai
these measures be enacted into law.
Their urgency lies in the manifest cir
cumstances which render their adop
tion at this time not only opportune
but necessary. Evbn delay would se
riously jeopard the interests of the
country and of tlifc government
Immediate passage of the bill to reg
ulate the expenditure of money In
elections may seem to be less neces
sary than the immediate enactment of
the other measures to which I refer,
because at least two years will elapse
before another election in which fed
eral offices are to be filled, but It would
greatly relieve the public mind If this
important matter were dealt with
while the circumstances and'the dan
gers to. the public morals of the pres
ent method of obtaining and spending
campaign funds stand clear under re
cent-observation and the methods of
expenditure can be frankly studied in
the light of present experience. And a
delay would have the further serious
disadvantage of postponing action un
til anoth^election was at hand and
some special object connected with it
might be thought to lie in the mind of
those who urged it. Action can be
