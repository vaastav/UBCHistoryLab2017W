The McNamaras and Ma Man
iffals are not socialists, but an
archists.
So far this season 101 hunters

The Standard Oil Co. has just
been convicted again of rebating
and fined a couple of millions
Paid the fine.' Well, not just
yet; there are still complacent
federal judges to whom the case
can be appealed
John D. Rockefeller has just
retired from active participation
in the affairs of the Standard
Oil Co. However, he will con
tinue to participate in the Stan
da rd's graft from the public as
actively and largely as ever

punished. That $25,000 register

made so much sarcastic comment
to Mr. Akins discredit, has been
located and all the money except
'SSMOO of it recovered. A dis
honest clerk in the registry do

and the Republican party en
dorses it, commits the party to
federal control of the great mono
polistic corporations. His recom
mendation in that respect are
good as far as they go. but fed
eral control of these corporations
that does not also regulate their
charges and profits for the bene
fit of the consumer, will be of
little real utility to the commu
nity. The government has al
ready sustained its right to the
public control of railroad charg
es, and the principle applied
holds good against all great cor
porations. It can regulate, the
price of oil, of packing-house
product, steel products and so
on under the same power that it
uses in dealing with the rail
roads the right to promote the
welfare of the community over
the dominance of individual in
terest and wealth.
Whom were the McNamaras
serving with their dynamite
plots? Certainly net organized
labor, for which John J. Mc
Namara stood as an official re
presentative, for it was as inevit
able that these outrages would
react upon organized labor as it
was that they must sooner or
later be traced to the guilty par
ties. It is, therefore, almost in
credible that men of ordinary
intelligence, and John J. to have
reached the position in labor
circles that he held, must be
somewhat above an ordinary
caliber of intelligence, would re
sort to such practices with the
idea that he was helping the
class of society he represented.
That these men have confessed
their guilty really does not fur
nish the solution of the problem,
for in their confession they fail
to show wherein the act confess
ed to was to benefit the cause
they represented. The vested
interest, while they have suffer
ed a slight material damage from
these dynamite-operations, are
the real gainers from them, since
their prestige before the country
gains in the same ratio that the
McNamaras have brought odium
upon organized labor.

HERE ARE SOME OF THE BARGAINS:
During the special sesion last1
summer we failed to note his
name mentioned among the con
spicuous members of the House,
but this may have been due to
an effort on part of the Washing
ton correspondents to suppress
the news of our representative's
true status m national affair.
But if "Walter is really going to
run on his record, as the News
tells us, why, we can pass judg
ment upon the "critter" when
he brings it to the post.
The De Soto Press informs us
that Congressman Hensley fears
no one the Republicans may put
up against him next year, that
he "will make the race upon his
record." This is the first inti
mation we have had that Mr.
Hensley has established a record
as Congressman from this dis
trict and the Press should give
us a diagram and specifications
of it for our further enlighten
ment. His constituents, who
have been kept in the dark in
regard to this record, have been

By Mrs. J. T. Rice, president of the
Irondale Mothers' Circle.
The child should be started
right by giving him a home
where the housing conditions
are good, the furnishings sani
tary and appropriate, the food
and feeding healthful, and the
clothing comfortable. These
things can be obtained at large
or small expense, according to
our means, hut High cost is not
necessary to g.,od results. The
one thing necessary is informa
tion as to what are proper hous-
ngs, furnishings, foods, feeding
and clothing.
Having started the child right,
ie must be led along the right
way. in accomplishing tins an I
mportant place must be given
to Home Occupations, Play and
Play Material. The home made
doll house and the home made
work bench are valuable in the
roduction of a good home made

very child longs to make real
things, and so become a part of
the life around him. In produc-
ive work, he will learn initiative.
pplication, self-reliance, self-
or.trol. concentration aid re
sourcefulness. By it, the bond
which holds him to the home
will be strengthened, and the
relation of parents to children
will be rendered more close and
intimate.
Can you contrive some some
sort or workshop where your
boj can use his mind, his will
and his his hannds in active
healthful employment at home?
A workbench can be made from
a dry goods box costing Q cents
or less, and the outfit with which
all sorts of crafts, from wood
carving to cabinet making, can
be carried on may be secured for
a moderate sum. Printing out
fits may be had at varying prices,
depending upon the ingenuity,
resourcefulness and persistency
of the boy who hunts for them.
Apparatus for all sorts of nature
work, such as collecting, pre
paring, mounting and classifying
specimens, can be made at home.
With simple tools and materials,
shelters for pets, bird houses
similar to those shown in the
homes exhibit, and other de
vices for the humane care of
domestic and wild animals can
be manufactured. The making
of such things will serve to fix
the humane precepts which every j
home should teach. Kindness)
to the lower animals is not sim
ply a duty to those patient crea
tures which always repay love
with love; but its exercise pro
motes the growth of those qual
ities which make men better in
all relations of life.
Do not think that costly outfits
add greatly to the pleasure of
the work done with them. It is
the finest kindness to the boy to
let him use his own ingenuity.

Concrete Furniture.
Thos. A. Edison, who recently
announced that he would make
it possible to build a concrete
house for $1000, has gone furth
er and declared that in the
near future he would put on the .
market concrete furniture. The
inventor already has made a re
inforced concrete cabinet for the
phonograph, and pieces of furni
ture made in the new style are
on their way to Chicago and back
to show what they can stand in
the way of resisting handling
by freight men.
At present the weight of the
concrete furniture is about 33
per cent greater than wood, but
Edison expects to reduce the ex
cess to 25 per cent. The con
crete surface can be stained,
Edison claims, so as to look like

Which would you rather have,

train of covered Pullmans that
can only "go," or a common,
easily home made train of open
freight cars? The latter, of
course, because witn it you could

one wants, as freight. Oddity
and appearance count for very
little with a child. To be an en

self to active play.
In considering the purchase
of toys, bear in mind that they
should not be given to a child
until the need for them is felt.
Grown-ups too often divert child
ren from initiative play by the
introduction of irrelevant toys.

about Doan's Kidney Pills being a
remedy of merit. I have tested this
remedy on several occasions during
the past two years whenhavingattacks
of the backache and it has never failect
to give me almost immediate relief
My first experience was in the fall
of 1906. At that time I was suffering
from a lame and aching back, and
was often in such a bad way that I
could hardly straighten after stooping.
When Doan's Kidney Pills were
brought to my attention, I procured a
supply and it required less than the
contents of one box to cure me.
About six weeks ago I felt slight
