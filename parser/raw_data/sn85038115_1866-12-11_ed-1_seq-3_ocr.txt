, The beautiful Piano Fortes of Grovestebn

Ultima Thule of instruments of the kind.
We cann it suggest what is wanting to make
a musical Instrument more periect, although
we are Blow to admit that the limit of im-
rprovement can ever be attained. - .
- Before they had brought tlieir ttanos to
their present excellence they had submitted
them to competition with instruments . of the
best makers of this country and Europe, and
received the reward of merit, over all others,
at the celebrated World's Fair. It is but jus.
tice to say that the"judgment thus pronounced
has not been overruled by the musical world.
'.. Still, by th4 improvements .lately applied
by them to their Pianos, it is admitted that a
more perfect . instrument has been made
They have accordingly achieved the paradox
of making excellence more excellent. ' Sure

The AMERICAN ARTISTS' UNION would
add that these premiums are to be considered
only in the light of a free gift to their pat.
rons, as the engravings .are furnished teem
below their market value, and as the cost of
engravings, after the plates are procured, is
very trifling, they can easily afford to make
the distribution, large as it is.
We trust that our numerous friends through-
out the country and Canadas will use their
utmost exertions, so that, if possible.the dis
tribution may be made Boon, and it can be
done if they are at all active. Ladies have
often made excellent Club Agents for us, and
we solicit their kind efforts, which will not
go unrewarded. Let one or more energetio
persons in every town and village in the
country commence as soon as they see this,
and get up as large a club as possible. By so
doing tbey will be the means of introducing
elegant engravings into families,and thus aid
in cultivating a taste for the beautiful and
refined. Address orders, '.
