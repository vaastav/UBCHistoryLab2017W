ALKXAISTPKIA..
monday EVENING. DECEMBER Hi.
One ok the schemes the republicans in
Coogresa are now considering, by which the
Hurpiua revenue can be decreased, bo a9 to
afford a plaueible excuse for the mainten?
ance of the existing high tariff, by which all
the poor people of the country are taxed in
order to increase the profits of a few owners
of protected mines and manufactories, is
the removal of the duty on sugar?a pecu
liarly southern product, and the payment of
a bounty to sugar planters. The tar on
sugar should be removed, but for a less rea?
son than that on salt, coal, iron,-clothing,
and all tbe other necessaries of life, for every
cent of tbe sugar tax goes into the treasury,
as that tax does not hinder the importa?
tion of sugar, while four-fiftha of the tax
imposed on other articles goes into the
pockets of tbe protected manufacturers, by
reason of the fact that that tax does restrict
the importation of those articles. Then, too,
the principles upon which this government
was founded are utterly opposed to the
bounty system. Equal opportunity to all,
epecial favors to none, are what thofe
principles teach : and a sugar plauter Id
Louisiana is no more entitled to a bounty
than a cotton planter in Georgia or a tobac?
co planter in Virginia.
Of COURSK everybody in Virginia would
like tbe world's fair to be held in Washing
toe; bu', for all that, many right thinking
Virginians are sorry, that even for such a
desirable object, the legislature of Virginia
should have, eo early in its session, adopted
tbe objectionable practioe its predecessor
carried to a ridiculous extent, of "instruct?
ing Virginia Senators and requesting her
representatives in Congress",concerning the
eouise tbey shall pursue in the body oi
which they are members. It is only natural
that Congressmen should know better what
to do in matters before Congress than mem?
bers of the Virginia legislature, and if tbe
latter only knew bow such Instructions and
lequeste as those referred to are generally
received, it would be a cold day when they
would repeat tbpm.
A.s ax'j icipatkd by people who read be?
tween tbe lines, tbe latest news from Bra?
zil is not aa rose tinted as the "king killers"
would have it appear. The telegraph, the
press and the mail in Brazil are under the
censorship of tbe revolutionists, so that the
real couditiou of bllairs in Brazil is cot
knowu outside of tbat country; but enough
news leaks through the lines to indicate
pretty clearly that tbe vast body of the Bra
ziliana were unaware of the proposed de?
position and expulsion of their Emperor
until after the consummation of both those
acts, and tbat large numbers of them are
opposed to tbe new order of things there.
No Wonder the repubiicats are so vio?
lently opposed to tbe resolutions of Sena
tors Gibson and Morgan for tbe deportation
of tbe negroes of this country, for, if tbe ne?
groes be sent away, the republican party
would ba nothing but an unpleasant memo*
ry, aud taxes be laid on the luxuries, not on
Jbe nect varies of life.
Lee ou Davis.
The following is a verbatim report of
the remarks made by General William
II. F. Lee at the Davis memorial services at
the Opera House in thia city last Friday
night:
?'My cr.inrades, friends, ladles and gentle?
men. We meet with meltiog hearts and
moist eyee to do honor to him whom we Be
lee'ed for our chieftaiu in the great struggle
which the South made for constitutional
liberty, for ber ?omea and for her firesides,
ilow he bore himsalf during tbose four
long yeara of war, many bere well know.
"lie carried ua through years of Buf?
fering and sorrow, and when all op?
position failed, wh<m further resistance
was impossible, he i'tiered himself as a liv?
ing sacrifice upon tbe altar for those whom
he could not save, but whom he loved bet?
ter than comfort, fortune, home, and even
life itself. I Applause.I
"He bore niu trials uuoomplainlngly, and
lived long enongh to Bee that many of those
who at one tinio viewing him as a traitor,
?ud would have consigned him to a traitor's
doom, respected, if they did not admire
bim. I am not here as bis eulogist, be
cause bis fame has no bounds. It burns
brightly on the beurtatones of every nation,
in every clime where honor and noble
deeds are respected among men. | Ap?
plause j
' We see that monuments built by human
hands scarcely survive over twenty years,
but great deeds far outlive tbat period. It
may be now tbat the shepherd drives
his lljck over those fields where Greoce> once
fought for liberty ; it may be tbat the flocks
go over tbe plains where once was heard
the clang of arms and tbe shout of victory ;
hut the mind is yet warm with tbe fame of
Miltiades. Old Home lies in ruins ; yet bow
we love to study her glorious records, and
how every patriotic heart is warmed as it
dwells on tbe words of Cato, boasting that
he was tbe least of the Romans. And, my
friends, in tbe far future, when the great
character wbich has sprung forth in our his?
tory will stand out like tbe mountains be?
fore the cloudless sky, there will be one who,
like the Peaks of Oster on our own blue j
hills, overtopping them all?there will be
one and it will be tbat of the first, the last, j
*nd only President of tbe Confederate States,
j Loud applause, j
"He was ia disaster as great as be was in
victory, and it may be aa truly said of him
as was said of bis great prototype, Cato,
when asked how be bore himself amidst
the downfall of the liberties of his country;
the reply came "Thou has seen Monat Atlas
-when storms and tempests linger on its
brow and ocean brake its billows at its feet."
Thus stands this haughty man, and glories
^n his height. [Loud applause..

The Treasury Surplus.
To the Editor of the Alexandria Gazdtt
The Ameiican public has beea definitely
informed of the condition of national lit)
aoces through the President's message
This condition is without a precedent in the
history of nations or in the archives of treas
uriee. A net annual surplus b yond a liber
al estimate of expenditures of about one
hundred millions produced with tbe provo
cation of little or no complaint from the
tax-payers is incomparable,
In the same month has been forthcoming
a message from the executive of a compon?
ent of,this union devoted almost exclusive?
ly to the unfortunate condition of its fin?
ances. A report that is not only indicative
of present evils but is productive of disas?
trous consequences in tbe future.
The existence of a vast nurplus in our
federal treasury and a condition of practical
bankruptcy in one of our older States is
prima facie evidence of unjust laws, of in
competent statesmen or of a defective con?
stitution. Suppose we g'ance back to tbe
formation of tbis federal union and to tbe
relation of tbe Spates to one another.
At the close of the revolution the Ameri
can people we're heavily in debt both as in?
dependent colouies and aa a confederation,
and by their divided state they were weak
abroad and consumed by jdaluu-ies end riv?
alries at borne. United, eaeh could et j >y
tbe strength and the resources of tbe whole
and thus preserve re=pect abroad and pros
perity at borne.
It wbs accomp'isbod, and under tbe able
statesmanship of Wasbingtou and Hamilton
every State debt was assumed by the nation.
It was just, for the S:ates had granted to
ihe Uoion tbe two great taxes?toe customs
and tbe ioternal revenue ; and it achieved
unbounded success, for credit was restored
tbougbout the length and breadth of the
land.
But. what is now tbe remit of this great
transfer of revenue from the States to the
Union ?
For a time the assumption of the debts of
the States by tbe national government raised
their credit to par. A half century passi d
away. The spirit of the times called for
vast internal improvements io the construe
tion of railroads and canals from the inland
States to the seaboard ; piivale capital whs
inadequate, and some of the StHte9 assumed
the work and thus became heavily burden
od with debt.
Civil war came about, and onr-third of tbe
States declared their rieht to withdraw
from the Union and establish a sop
arate government. They fought brave
ly, but were conquered and forced
into tbe federal union with their sons torn
and bleeding from tbe strife, their homes in
ashes, their slaves cm.fi-'ca'ed, and burden
ed with the heavy deb s contracted years
before and the interest accumulations there?
on, and with the government of the freed
men.
To preserve the form of a Stats govern
ment 'axes must be levied on these impov?
erished farmland wounded cit zms.
What did the nation do for these unfortu
nate Sta'es in tbis time of dire wretched?
ness? Nothing but add continually to the
burden of their misfortunes by giving tbe
freedman the franchise.
What have our Presidents and Congresses
doDe to allieve these burden* after years
have passed away, when tbe tierce passions
of hrutal war are supposed to have g'veu
place to the broader views of statesmen ?
Be it said to the discredit of an enlighten?
ed people that their public officials have
done nothing. Do they execute tho trusts
aud provisions of the Constitution in ab
Borbing the bulk of th* revenuea of the na?
tion for the accumulation of a vast aud un?
used surplus, while the iodividnal States of
the uniou are iu tbe dum of financial dis?
credit ?
This is not union, it is oppression. Tax*
ntionwithout representation is impossible,
but taxation without benefit should be un?
bearable.
Can Virginia euoply her quota of troop9,
or of resources io a foreign War ? No, she
is a practical hankrnpt.
Again the annual treasury surplus is a Monaco
to the virtue of our institutioi.s and is a prolific
sou reo of care'oss and extravagant,le<Vation.
Has the honr come when our union betius to
bo a failure, when the great mimes uf Wasbiuctoti
and Hamilton must be tarnished by thi narrow
aud nnw >rtby policy of their successors ?
Snperticially the riali jn is in the fu:l fid<- of
prosperity, but in tho midst appear mouuntona
evils.
On what grounds of equity can the ontral gov?
ernment retain and rnonopolu.) nil the great
sources of revenue, receiving sums far in excess of
its needs and proper uses mi i noi distribute the
surplus among the debt-burdenci States as pro?
vided by law ?
Let our statesmen awaken t) a broader sense of
the trusts and responsibilities iruposod by tho
Constitution and this wretched stain upon our
character as a nation will be obliterated and the
South will again feel that the nnion provides
somo real benefits and is no longer a mere engine
of oppression.
