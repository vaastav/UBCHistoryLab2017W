CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT.
For the information of the public It is
announced that a change has been made in
the business management of the Sentine
office, Mr. John I. Cooper, owing to a pres
sure of weighty private business interests de
manding his exclusive time and attention.
tendering his resignation as president of the
company, which, at his own request, was
accepted, and Mr. John C. Shoe
maker, h'a predecessor, was there
upon elected to fill the vacancy. Mr,
Cooper's vigorous and successful ad
mimrtrntinn of the Sentinel during the
late political campaign which comprised
his period of oCioe will be long and grate
fully remembered by democrats throughout
the state. The change of management took
effect Monday.
Is getting rid of such a carpet-bag ecouiv
drel as Spencer the country wilt be glad to
know that Alabama has elected a man ot
commanding talents, who will adorn the
position which his predecessor has degraded.
An exchange says that "Governor George S.
Houston, (dein.) of Alabama, who is to suc
'ceed the carpet-bag Spencer as United
'States senator, on the 4th of next March, is
an "old stager" in politics. Born in Ten
nessee in 1811, he removed ta- Alabama
'when a boy and became a lawyer.- After
holding various state oflicts he was elected
'to the Twenty-seventh congress (in 1S10) and
'was a member for eight years in succession,
'from 1S41 to 1S49. lie declined to be a can
'date for the Thirty-first congress, and was
'succeeded by David Hubbard. He was,
however, elected to the Thirty second con
'gress, as a Union democrat, by 452 majority
'over C. C. Howard (state rights whig) and
was re-elected to the Thirty-third, Thirty
fourth. Thirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth con
'gresses without opposition. He resigned
'January 21, 1861, Alabama having seceded
'from the UDion. He was elected to the
'United States senate in 18C5, but was not
permitted to take his seat . In 18G7 he was
'an unsuccessful candidate for the same
position. He was a delegate to the National
Union Convention in 18G6, and b' been
governor of Alabama since 1871."
llAYtV MESSAGE,
To the exclusion of other matter we make
room for Hayes' message, which was yester
day laid before congress, read and disposed
of, as is usual for such documents. It is in
no sense a remarkable state paper, nor is it,
except as being a communication to congress
by a man acting as president, of special
importance. We do not suppose there
is a man of intelligence in the country who
expected from Hayes any utterance indi
cating statesmanship, for at best he is a man
of exceedingly small caliber and utterly in
capacitated intellectually for the position he
occupies. The message, aside from such
portions of it as reproduce statements made
in "accompanying ' documents," is a mass
of puerile platitudes that could have
been as well said by thousands
of American school boys in their teens, and
itet a few days of comment the message
will be regarded as third class rubbish and
be forgotten. Those portions of the mes
sage which will attract attention relate to
"the policy in the sooth" and to finance.
Upon the southern question we are told that
the executive will exert whatever authority
the constitution and laws confer to correct
election irregularities in southern states.
Hayes is of the opinion that he has net suf
ficient funds to punish offenders, and calls
upon congress to increase appropriations to
enable him to persecute and prosecute south
ern men upon charges concocted by radical
scalawags for the purpose of firing e north
ern heart. As a campaign .ocument radical
leaders will regard this portion of the mes
sage as too insipid for use. There
is not enouzh malignity in it
to please either Conkling or Blaine,
but just enough to indicate to all fair
minded men a purpose to revive the
bloody shirt business for partisan ends, and
if possible create anarchy In the name of
law and order. This portion of the message
will answer a valuable purpose, for it will
awaken a new interest in the history of pro
ceedings which finally placed him in power
in defiance of the will of the
people; and, as if to increase the
weight of his own condemnation, Hayes
declares that "so long as the exercise of this
power and the enjoyment of this right are
common and equal, practically as well as
'formally, submission to the results of suf
'frage will be accorded loyally and cheerfully,
'and all the departments of government
'will feel the true vigor of the popular will
thus expressed. No temporary or admin
iatrative interests of government, however
'urgent or weighty, will ever displace the
zeal of our people in defense of (he primary
'rights of citizenship. They understand that
the protection of liberty requires the main-
'tenance. In full vigor, or the manly methods
of free speech, free press, and free suffrage,
'and will sustain the full authority of gor
eraraent to enforce the laws which are
framed to preserve these Inestimable
-rights."
Thia language will derive freah Import
ance by the report of the Potter Committee,
which will show that the "primary rights ot
gUcsubJ?," M ail other rights, were cloven
down to make blxu president, and that the
villains who accomplished the nefarious job
have been rewarded for their crimes.
Upon financial matters Hayes does not
want anj more legislation, which Is about
equal t'j iiylng that John Sherman and the
national banks may. If they choose, discredit
the silver dollar, lock up greenbacks and
nullify the laws of congress, and that he
will stand by them.
Aside from these questions the message
relates to matters more fully and satisfactor
ily set forth in department reports.
A FRISKY WIDOW.
rwMti Allearatlona Agalast Mrs, W. C.
Ralston The Guardianship of Her rer-
son Sued Far.
lean Francisco Chronlcle.1 ,J
About a year ago the once handsome
widow of the late William C. Ralston at
tracted a considerable share of public atten
inn nd comment bv reason of the state
ment that she had fallen into the toils of
certain skillful and adventurous young and
needy gentlemen of the world, and particu
larly into those ot a New Yorker,, who aban
doned a wife and children for this more
profitable affection. This unfortunate woman
is again brought prominently before the
nnblic. this time in the role of a person in
capable of taking care o, the liberal means
provided , lor ner support uy iuo
friends "of'., her deceased husband,
an anneal bavin been made to the probate
court of this city to provide a guardin for
hop ronton and estate. 'The action was
brought some months ago, and was on the
noint of beiDsr compromised through the in
tervention of A. A. Cohen, who was acting
in the capacity of friend. It was arranged
that she was to have the benefit of the pro
ceeds from an investment of $100,000, con
tributed by the friends already referred to.
but tbat'Bhe was not to have access to the
principal. Subsequently she made a de
mand noon Mr. Cohen for the sum of $20,-
000. Thia he declined to furnish, saying
that she could only receive $500. the amount
of the monthly installment upon the in
vestment for her benefit Thereupon she
withdrew from the arrangement, and se
cured two lawyers to represent .er. To
make the cause of the action clear. It will be
necessary to rehearse a little ot the history
of Mrs. Ralston: After the financial ruin
and tragic death of her husband, W. C.
Ralston, she was, through the generosity
of his wealthy friends, endowed with
a fortune, the income of which was
sufficient to enable her, with ordinary pru
dence, to live In the elegant style to which
as a wife she had always been accustomed.
But little of thiafortune.it is represented,
is now left, and to prevent the too rapid dis
bursement of that little, the appeal men
tioned has been made. The action was com
menced by A. J. Ralston. J. D. Fry and J. C.
L. Wadsworth. and the pleadings allege that
of the fortune of something like $175,000
given to her, Mrs. Ralston had already squan
dered about $120,0u0 in reckless living and
suDDortinir and maintaining one or more
rwrsons having no leiral claim upon her. It
is also alleged that there is in the posession
of Wells, Fargo & Co. some $40,000 belong-
ine to Mrs. R Alston, and of wbich jsbe has
demanded payment, and the prayer is that.
in order to prevent Mrs. Ralston and her
children from becoming beggars and becooi
inr a charge upon public or private charity.
and because of her mental incompetence to
manage her estate, a guardian be appoint
ed to take charge of her estate and of her
person. Tbe order forbidding the payment,
bv Wells. Fanro Co ot the money, was
made until the action should be disposed of,
but by a subsequent order Mrs. Ralstdn was
enabled to obtain $4,000 of the money. The
person usder whose baleful influence Mrs.
Ralston is supposed to be acting is the young
New Yorker, Candor, and it is shrewdly sus
pected he is now in the neighborhood of
Cheyenne or even nearer this city, and pre
pared to come on or run oil. as his necessi
ties may require, a.t a moment's notice. Mrs.
Ralston is now in this city, her home at pres
ent being tbe Palace Hotel. It is said that
she ha? furnished an additional reason for
the appointment of a guardian, besides an
undesirable penchant for roving young ad
venturers, and that a cheering social custom
has eraduated into an acquirement that la
more convivial than commendable. In the
action now pending, Messrs. Coghlan and
MeClure will represent Mrs. Ralbton, while
the trustees will be represented by . H. L.
Barnes.
A Canada Farmer Falls Heir to Two
Million Dollars.
IPerth Courier.
Br tbe death of his aunt in Scotland, Mr.
James McLellan. a farmer living in very hum
ble circumstances In Dalnousie, near Lanark:
Villesre. has become by will heir to $2,000.
000. It seems the party who made this
enormous fortune was a ship owner in Scot
land. who. commiucing with very little
except his native Scotch shrwdness, worked
up a business so extensive tbat at the time
of his death, which happened some years
ago, his possessions footed up to something
like 400.000 sterling, lie lure dying ne
willed the whole of this to tbe above men
tloned Dalhoosie man, who was tbe nephew
of his wife. Tbe will provided, however.
tbat his wife should have the use of this
amount until her death, after which event
it would fall into the ownership of her
nephew, Mr. McLllan. This lady dying in
her turn a short time ago, Mr. McLellan was
notified by the trustees tbat the property
was lying at his disposal, as heir at law, and
rea nesting mm to loos aooui it. inis ait.
McLellan at once proceeded to do, and has
taken the necessary steps to proceed to Scot
land in tbe sunnr. U-ing in very poor ctr
cumstances. Mr. John Armour kindly lent the
old man monev enouith to take him across
to th9old country, where his colossal for
tune awaits him. The fortunate farmer is a
eon of the late Mr. John McLellan, a well
known resident of Perth, who died here a
few vears ao at a ripe old age. He was
known by the sobriquet of "The Convenan
ter," but for what reason we could never
exactly make out. Hes lucky sop, who is
now about GO years old. we learn, stands in
much need of a windfall of this kind, though
its immense size ought to make a stronger
minded man than he doubt whether his
fortune is actually a reality or only a dream.
Walking-.
Halls Journal of Health.!
Walking briskly, with an exciting object
of pleasurable interest ahead, is the most
healthful of all forms ot exercise, except
tbat of encouragingly remunerative, steady
labor in the open air; and yet multitudes in
the city, whose health urgently requires ex
eruise, seldom walk, wben they can ride.
the distance is a mile or more. It is worse
in the country, especially with the well-to
do; a horse or carriage must be brought to
the door, even if lcs distances have . to be
Dsssed. Under the conditions first named
walking is a bliss: it gives animation to tbe
mind, It vivifies the circulation, it paints the
cheek and sptrkles tbe eye. and wakes up
the whole btioK, physical, mental and moral.
We know a family of children tn this city
who. from the ae of seven, hud to walK
nearly two miles to school, winter and turn
mer! whether sleet, or storm, or rain, or
burning sun, they made it an ambition never
to stay from acho.Jl o. account ot lu.t weath
er, and never to be "late," and one of them
was heard to boast that in seven years it had
never been necessary to give an "excuse"
for being one minute behind time, even al
though in winter it was necessary to dress by
goaiigut. They did not average two days'
sickneis in a year, and later they thought
nothing of walking twelve miles at a time in
the Swiss mountains. Sometimes they
would be caught in drenching rains and wet
to the akin; on such occasion! they made it
a point to do one thing, let it rain, and
trudge on more vigorously, until every
thread was dry before they reached home.
THE NEXT PEESDjEUOY.
Views of the Bolii Bouth " With Re
gard to Presifontial Candidates.
Hendricks or Tnurman for the Democrats,
and. Grant for the Republicans.
The Cincinnati Enquirer has interviewed
the entire south, through its various corre
spondents, upon the questions wbich divide
public men, and more especially the import
ant question of the next presidency. Tbe
democrats seem to be pretty well divided
between Mr. Hendricks and Mr. Thurman,
while Messrs. Bayard, Tilden and Hancock
have their special friends who would prefer
to see them at the head of the democratic
ticket. Excepting Mr. Bayard no other
southern man is named by anyone. All
seem perfectly willing that a northern man
should have the nomination, and whoever
he may be, he will be cordially supported.
General Grant seems to be tbe choice of tbe
southern radicals for the presidency. After
him Blaine seems to be the choice, and then
Conkling, while Hayes is not alluded to in
connection with the matter. The first letter
is from
C'aAWARE.
A Mr. Hastings, an extensive manufac
turer, of Wilmington, says that fully 05 per
cent, of the Delaware radicals are in favor of
Grant for a third term. Public feeling among
the Delaware radicals is one of intense satis
faction at the indications of a "solid north"
as an onsst to a "soua soma. iseiaware
democrats are in favor of Mr. Bayard for the
nomination, but Mr. Bayard refused to be
Interviewed.
MARYLAND.
The correspondent from Maryland claims
to have secured the opinions of ail the lead
ing men of both parties of this state. Mr.
Bayard seems to be the choice of the demo
crats, while General urant is that or the
radicals, although up to the last presidential
election James G. Blaine was their over
whelming choice. Since the election in New
York state Mr. Conkling is developing some
strength. A leading democrat of Baltimore
gave as bis opinion that Mr. Tilden would be
tbe choice of many warm, staunch democrats
if. in 1876, he bad promptly stepped to the
front and manfully asserted his claims to the
presidency when he discovered that a con
spiracy was on loot to deprive htm ot it.
The opinion was also expressed tbat the
radical cry of "solid south" was merely a
new party cry substitute for the "bloody
shirt," and had no more substantial material
in its make up.
VIRGINIA.
Tbe politicians of the "Old Dominion"
seem very much divided. While the green
back movement has considerable strength
among the msssps me leaders oi ooin
parties seem to be in favor ot hard money.
General Joe Johnston has no preference for
the presidency, except tbat he desires a
northern man. He thinks the "solid south''
all nonsense and says that "sectionalism was
killed in tbe recent election&and long before
1880 the 'solid north' and 'solid south
will be forgotten terms." He says that the
south recognizes the end of the war but that
long range radicals and latter day warriors
do not seem to realize it General Bradlev
T. Johnston was in favor of Mr. Bayard for the
presidency, while Judge John A. Meredith.
alluded to as a "democrat of prominence,"
favored Mr. Hendricks. The radicals are for
Grant, and some are sanguine enough to
think that be can carry irginia. A. Judge
Hughes says: "Why, pshaw! Talking about
the solid south; the south is all right. Grant
can carry Mrginia and other southern
states."
WEST VIBGISIA.
The democrats seem to be In favor of Thur
man for the presidency, while the radicals
are divided between Grant and Blaine. Gov
ernor Mathews is for Mr. Thurman, with Mr.
Hendricks or General Hancock for second
choice. He claims for his people thorough
loyalty to the Union, and says that the
'solid south" talk, a opposed to a -soua
north," is all bosh. Ex-Lieutenant Governor
Price names either Mr. Thurman or Mr.
Hendricks as his choice.
NORTH CAROLINA.
0!d line whigs, bondholders, bankers, etc.,
say they want urant, and the democrats
favor Thurman. Judge Settle, now of Flori
da, formerly of North Carolina, is spoken of
for the vice presidency along with Grant
The radicals think that "Grant and Settle"
would sweep everything. The judge himself
has been interviewed, and like northern rad
icals, is in favor of Grant and a "strong"
government.
GEORGIA.
Georgia, the empire state of the south, Is
the rnoit important of tboe states under
consideration, and we are glad to announce
that Mr. Hendricks seems to be the favorite
for tbe presidency amoog Georgia democrats.
Senator Gordon expresses himself as having
the "go" on all aspirants, - and
that Grant will be the radical
candidate. The senator thinks tbat as long
as radicals talk "bloody shirt" the
south will be "solid." Senator '.Ui says.
"I'm for Tilden," but then he laughed
quietly aad said, "doa't tell that" He is
preparing a speech to be delivered when the
Potter Committee reports, in wbich he pro
poses to skin Mr. Hayes from the fraud
standpoint Governor Colquitt says that
the sectional cry of the radical leaders pro
daces tbe "solid south " Congressman Speer
says, "Put me down for Tilden ; the republi
caa papers say he is dead, but I notice they
devote a great deal of space to keep on kill
ing him." The republicans are literally
solid for Grant. Colonel Buck, "the best
posted republican in tbe state," says 'that
"he will be elected as sure as the sun shines."
and alludes to Hayes' administration 83
'milk and potato conduct" Alt the radi
cals are enthusiastic for Grant, and violent
ly abusive of Hayes.
FLORIDA.
Dr. Paine, a prominent democrat, an
nounces as his choice "Hendricks and Han
cock." Judge Baker was for Thurman.
Governor Drew prefers him also, but says
that "all that the people of this section want
is to be let alone in tneir local governments
and the north can have tbe national candt
dates." United Staus Marshal Conant is In
tavor of Conkling and Settle, and thinks and
says that "it's all d d nonsense about the
soutk wanting local self government; it's
local anarchy they want" Oihers want
Grant or "any other man" who can win.
ALABAMA.
Mr. Bayard is probably tbe first choice of
the democrats of Alabama, witn Mr. lien
dricVs or Mr. Thurman as the second. The
radicals to a man are for Grant. Colonel 1),
C. Anderson, of Mobile, fays: "The drift of
public sentiment in the south is friendly to
the eovernment. I nave never
heard the expression of a sentiment from
any man in this section which iudicated.that
hia political action in reference to the pres
ent state of things grew out ot any prejudice
or hostility to the north'' this In regard to
the "solid south" tai a.
LOUISIANA.
Lieutenant Governor L. A. Wilts thinks
that the magnificent behavior of tbe north
towards the south during tbe prevalence of
the yellow fever should obliterate all sec
tional feeliug. He prefers Hancock, but
will support any "clean and capable" man.
The financial question does not loom into
prominence In Louisiana, Soma prominent
democrats favor the nomination of a western
man. Grant Is the choice of the ralicals
with one or two exceptions.
MIBHOCRI.
Colonel Sam Owens thinks that he ex
press the opiuions of tbe democrats gen
erally of Central Missouri when he says tbat
he Is opposed to Mr. Tilden's nomination
and that he favors either Thurman or Hen
dricks, and tbat the financial plank of the
platform should be "greenbacks made as
good as gold, and an unlimited coinage of
silver opposition to inflation; and advises
great discretion in the resumption of specie
payment" Tbe Hon. A. J. Garesche,formerly
chairman of the democratic central committee
and a leading lawyer of St Louis, says that
there la danger in talking about a "solid
south" and a "solid north," and lhat he is
opposed to anything whatever that will re
new a discussion of tbe troubles growing out
of the war. The south must be content to
take a back eeat' He respects her
people, .but fx thinks that, it would
be bad . .policy . to put a
southern man at the head of the presidential
ticket in 1880. He is in favor of Hendricks,
Thurman or Bayard at the head of the ticket
Mr. Alex. Graves, a prominent lawyer from
Lexington, Ma, is in favor of a western man
or General McCiellan. Mr. Charles M.
Elleard, a leading citizen of St Louis, and
the man who secured Missouri for Tilden in
the St Louis convention, is non committal
on a choice, and says that 'I am not ready to
say I will attempt the same thing next
time." The radicals ot Missouri are for
Grant as far as heard from.
KENTrCRT.
The Hon. James Speed, an upricht gentle
man, pronounced republican and the attor
ney general under President Lincoln, re
marked that "of late he had been very forci
bly struck with the loyal disposition of the
people of Kentucky, democrats and repub
licans, towards tke general government."
Thurman or Hendricks is the choice of Ken
tucky democrats, whils Grant leads with the
radicals.
( TENNESSEE.
Mr. Hendricks seems to be the favorite in
Tennessee for the presidency, although there
is a general inclination among tbe politicians
to keep quiet and await developments. Some
are for hard money, but the democracy of
Tennessee may be counted for greenbacks.
The radicals are solidly and enthusiastically
for Grant, with Blaine or Conkling for sec
ond choice. A noticeable fact is the hatred
to Hayes.
THE MARUVIH UF LOBSE.
HI Reception at Ottawa address of
Welcome The Governor General lie
ply.
Ottawa, Dec. 2. Although a drizzling
rain continued from early morning until the
arrival of the vice regal train, it did not
lam pen in the slightest degree the emotions
aroused in the hearts of the people of Ottawa
Valley. The city was full of strangers, who
fl c'ied in from every part, and, with citizens
of all classes, irrespective of creed or nation
ality, joined in one grand outburst of enthu
siaim, a filling culmination to the serifs
of princely greetings which have marked
the rrogiess or the vice recal train.
The welcome was broad, hearty and gener

manner the loyalty of her eastern people.
Wellington, Sparks. Reaeau and other

other adornments, which presented a scene
of great beauty. Upon the arrival of the
train, their excellencies were conducted to
the beautifully decorated pavilion by the
mayor and city aldermen, where an address
of the corporation was presented, to which
the governor general replied as follows:

The galleries of the house to-day con
tained the customary crow J at the opening
of a session of congress. At noon Speaker
Randall rapped the bouse to order, when
the chaplain inde a prayer, and the roil was
called.
The roll call showed 2J9 members pres
ent. Two new members Bai'ey of New York
and Majors of Nevada then took the iron
clad oath.
Messrs. Atkins, Cox and Garfield were ap
pointed to inform the president that con
gre?s was in session.
After recess the president's message was
received from Frivate Secretary Rogers, and
read.
When the reading of the message wsa end
ed Mr. Wood of New York rose and moved
that it be referred to the committee of the
whole bouse and ordered printed. But first
he desired to make some comments upon it,
although, as a whole, tbe document was
highly satisfactory; yet there were some
references in it which should be met at the
earliest practicable moment. He referred
to tbat part relating to the southern states.
He (Wood) failed to see where the president
saw any disposition in the south to avoid or
annul in any degree tbe recent constitutional
amendments, lie failed to see any indict
tion in the south, at any election, at any
time, under any circumstances, for a teriei
of years, of unwillingness to live In enti.e
amity with the whole country in regard to
laws or to obey the government.
He regretted that the president, who
bad commenced his administration witn
such a noble and patriotic position
as against the military despotism exercised
by his predecessor,, should now indicate a
change of policy. He had watched with in
terest the course of tbe administration, in
order to see whether the president would be
forced from the manly aud noble position
taken by him. He knew tbat there was a
wing of the republican party dissatisfieJ
with that position, and it had been a matter
of interest to tbe whole country to know
whether tbe president would continuously
maintain bis attitude. While the president
expressed his views in very mild and very
decorous language, yet he indicated quite
clearly that the condition of things in the
south was not satisfactory to him. The pres
ident had referred especially to the elections
in South Carolina and Louisiana. He had
been able to single out two states, and only
two isolated instances in these states. That
was an indication of vacilation on the part
of tbe executive, aad it was only
because it was such an Indication that he
(Wood) telt it his duty to declare that
there was no foundation for the
allegation of wrong by the south. It was to
be regretted that while the president's eyes
were open to the congressional elections in
South Carolina and . Louisiana they were
closed to what occurred in the city of New
York on the 5th of November, where 4,000
legal voters were dragged to prison by gov
ernment officials; wbero hundreds of them
were plunged into the vilest dens as common
prisoners, and where, besides tbose who had
been arrested, 10.000 other voters had been
intimidated, thus makiDg a difference of at
least 15,000 voUs in the city ot New York in
tbe last election. The presldent had not
seen tbat; the republican pre?s of New York
bad not told tbat to tbe president, but it bad
pointed him to the south, lie (Wood) re
gretted that tbe president had thought prop
er to lend bishigb position to reiteration of
misrepresentation organized for him by tbe
republican press. He had the highest regard
for the president, believing him to be an
honest and patriotic no an. It was a matter
of profound regret that the president should
permit himselt to be an instrument in tbe
hands of an ultra wing of the republican
party.
Mr. Garfield replied to Mr. Wood. He
characterized it as very unusual to interrupt
the ordinary form of proceeding, which was
s-m ply to refer the prenident'i message and
order its printing, by debating any of its
suggestions, and he thought the kind of sug
gestions made by tbe gentleman from New
York as still more unusual. The exact lan
guage of tbat part of tho message with which
the gentleman found fiult was not in his
(Garfield's) mind, but the gntleman'a lan
guxge was very plain. He (Wood) critlcircd
certain references in th) president's message
as to some disturbances in the course of
federal elections in several states, contrasted
that with what be chose to call the noble
beginning of the administration in favor of
aelf government, and a id tbat the president
has shown vacilliation, because he had seen
fit to refer to the disturbances In federal elec
tions. If tbe right of a state to attend to its
own local concerns undisturbed was
in any way inconsistent with the right
of the national government to attend to
national elections, and if that was what tbe
gentleman called vacillation, he hoped they
ebonld all vacillate in tbat way. lie (Gar
field) bad never made himself a particular
advocate of any administration for its vacil
lation or want of vacillation, but if the gen
tleman (Wood) could make no better case
against the administration than that he had
made, he had not very well opened the ball
thia winter. That gentleman could not see
that there had been any disturbance in mat
ters of election (after a pause) excepting in
his own state. He (Wood) had seen some
signs, if not of disturbance, at least of vacil
lation, in tbe city of his adoption and in his
state, but tbey were not such instances of
vacillation as the gentleman would have
brought np in discussion. It did not signify
tbat tbe gentleman had not teen any dis
turbances in the national elections else
where. If the president had seen them it
was the president's duty to say so, and the
? resident had said so in bis message,
f the president had seen them, and had not
said so, he would not only have been guilty
of negligence, but of positive fault. The
president had referred to it modestly; he had
invited the attention of congress to It Did'
tbe gentlemen object to having his attention
pointed to it in tbat way; bad he, or any
other gentleman on tbe other side, any rea
son why he did not wish tbe attention of
congress pointed to the elections in the
southern states? For his own part, he wel
comed such calling of attention. The presi
dent ought to be thanked for it by tbe gen
tleman from New York, as it afforded an
opportunity for him to have this vacillation
examined into closely. He (Garfield) had
the impression made on his mind from a
somewhat careful reading of public journals,
that very considerable illegal disturbance
had taken place in some of the southern
states. He had even heard it stated that
intimidation had been employed, notably In
South Carolina, and in the districts V here
these had been there was an overwhelming
majority of one political part v. All this
might be an exaggeration, but "if bo, it was
one that was broad cast through the public
press, and one which a congress, so notable
as the present one for investigating all
chances of wrong doing, should investigate.
He supposed that his friends on the other
side would welcome the presidents' sugges
tion as exactly in the line of their conduct
hitnerto. He hoped they would not stifle
investigation.
Mr. Wood defended the position he bad
taken, and repeated his expression of regret
tbat the president had picked out two cases,
and deemed them ot sufficient importance to
present them to the world in his annual
message. It was an indication that the ultra
wing of the republican party was forcing
the executive to aid it in displaying the
bloody shirt, so that, the party could hold
on to its ill gotten power, and continue that
power by tbe plunder of the treasury.
Mr. Hale said it was alleged by the gentle
man from New York that the president had
been dragooned by the radical wing of the
republican party into the course indicated
in his message, and tbat that wing of the
party was likely to control the administra
tion. He would teil the gentleman tbat on
the great and fundamental doctrine of the
protection of a citizen in all his rights there
was no radical nor conservative wingin the
republican party, but there was one party in
the land united to a man on the proposition
tbat an American citizen north, south and
everywhere should be protected in tbe ex
ercise of his constitutional rights.
Mr. Cox of New York asked if the gentle
men from Ohio and Maine fttiled to remem
ber bow the tape-worm ticket of California
had been run by the navy yard; had they"
denounced tape-worm politics; not much.
He (Cox) shrunk from no investigation into
any election north or south.
Mr. Townsend of New York made some
remark which was not heard by Mr. Cox or -tbe
reporters, but at which some of the
members around him laughed.
Mr. Cox noticed it and said he did cot
know wbat they were laugbirg at, but it
was possibly tor want of thought.
Mr. Townsend said he bad been making a
remark about the cipher telegrams.
Mr. Cox retorted that that was another of
the vacillations of the other side; that there
were vacillations all over the country, but
that with all these vacillations tbe old dem
ocratic party would have the next senate,,
and the house also.
Tbe discussion, which was animated, here
closed, and Mr. Wood's motion to refer and
print the message was agreed to.
The military academy and fortification
appropriation bills were reported and notice
was given of early action on them. The
house then adjourned.
