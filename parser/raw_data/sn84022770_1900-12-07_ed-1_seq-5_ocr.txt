Foreign Questions.
m ASHING ION. Dec. 3.—President Mc-
Ktnley's message went to Congress to
day. It follows:
To the Senate and House of Representa
tives:
With the outgoing of the old and the
Incoming of the new century you begin
the last session of the 56th Congress, with
evidences on every hand of Individual and
National prosperity and with proof of the
growing strength and Increasing power
for good of Republican Institutions. Y'our
countrymen will Join with you In fe
licitation that American liberty Is more
tirmlv established than ever before, and
that love for it and the determination to
preserve It are more universal than at
any former period of our history.
The Republic was never so strong, be
cause never so strongly entrenched in
the hearts of the pecple as now. The
Constitution,with few amendments, exists
as it left the hands of Its authors. The
additions which have been made to 't
proclaim larger freedom and more ex
tended citizenship. Popular government
has demonstrated In Its 124 years of trial
here Its stability and security and Hs
efficiency as the best Instrument of Na
tional development and the best safe
guard to human rights.
When the sixth Congress assembled. In
November, 1800, the population of the
United States was 5.308.483; it is now
76,304.799. Then we hud 16 states: now
we have 45 Then our territory consisted
of 909.050 square miles; it is now 3.846.39.7
square miles Education, religion and
morality have kept pace with our ad
vancement In other directions, and. wnlle
extending Its power, the Government has
adhered to Its foundation principles and
abated none of them In dealing with our
new peoples and possessions. A Nation
so preserved and blest gives reverent
thanks to Gou and Invokes his guidance
and the continuance of his care and favor.
CHINESE PROBLEM.
c»«». That Led I p to the Recent
Troablea.
In our foreign Intercourse the domi
nant question has been the treatment of
the Chinese problem. Apart from tbls
our relations with the powers have been
happy.
The recent troubles In China spring
from the anti-foreign agitation which for
the past three years has gained strength
in the northern provinces. Their origin
lies deep In the character of the Chi
nese races and in the traditions of their
government. The Tal Ping rebellion and
the opening of Chinese ports to foreign
trade and settlement disturbed alike the
homogeneity i nd the seclusion of China.
Meanwhile foreign activity made itself
felt in all quarters, not alone on the
coast, but along the great rivers, arteries
and In the remoter districts, carrying new
ideas and introducing new associations
among a primitive people which had pur
sued for centuries a national policy of
isolation.
The telegraph and the railway spread
ing over their land, the steamers plying
on their waterways, the merchant and
the missionary penetrating year by year
farther to the Interior, became to the
Chinese mind types of an alien invasion,
changing the course of their national life,
and fraught with vague forebodings of
disaster to their beliefs and their self
control.
for several years before the present
troubles all the resources of foreign di
plomacy, backed by moral demonstra
tions of the physical force of fleets and
arms, have I een needed to secure due
reepect for the treaty rights of foreign
ers. and to obtain satisfaction from the
responsible authorities for the sporadic
outrages upon the persons and property
of unoffending sojourners, which from
time to tim> occurred at widely sep
arated points In the northern provinces,
as in the case of the outbreaks In Sze
Chuen and Shan Tung.
Posting of anti-foreign placards be
came a daily occurrence, which the re
peated probation of the imperial power
failed to check or punish. These inflam
matory appeals to the Ignorance and
superstition of the masses, mendacious
and absurd in their accusations, and
deeply hostile in their spirit, could not
but work culmlnatlve harm. They aimed
at no particular class of foreigners; they
were lmparttal tn attacking everything
foreign. An outbreak in Shan Tung. In
which German missionaries were slain,
was the too natural result of the malevo
lent teachings The posting of seditious
placards, exhorting to the utter destruc
tion of foreigners and of every foreign
thing. continued unrebuked. Hostile
demonstrations toward the stranger
gained strength by organisation.
The Boxer Agitation.
The sect commonly styled the Boxers
developed greatly in the provinces north
of the Yangt-e, and with collusion of
many notable officials. Including some In
the Immediate councils of the throne itself,
became alarmlrgly aggressive. No foreign
er's life, outside cf the protected treaty
ports, was safe. No foreign interest was
secure fioin spoliation.
The diplomatic representatives of the
powers In Pekln strove In vain to check
this movement. Protest was followed by
demand, and demand by renewed protest,
to be met with perfunctory edicts from
the palace and evasive and futile assur
ances from the Tsung II Yamun. The
circle of the Boxer influence narrowed
about Pekln. and. while nominally stig
matized as seditious. It was felt that Its
spirit pervaded the capital Itself, that
the Imperial forces were Imbued with its
doctrines, and that the immediate coun
selors of the Empress Dowager were in
full sympathy with the antl-forelgn
movement.
The Increasing gravity of the condi
tions In China, and the Imminence of
peril to our own diversified Interests In
the empire, as well as to those of all
the other treaty governments, were soon
appreciated by this Government, causing
profound solicitude. The United States,
from the earliest days of foreign Inter
course with China, has followed a policy
of peace, omitting no occasions to tes
tlfy good-will, to further the extension
of lawful trade, to respect the sovereign
ty of Its government, and to Insure, by
all legitimate and kindly, but earn
est. means, the fullest measure of pro
tection for the lives and property of our
law-abiding citizens, and for the exer
cise of their beneficent callings among
the Chinese people.
Mindful of this, it was felt to be ap
propriate that aw pwpoaw should be
pronounced in favor of such a course
as would hasten united artion of the
powers at Pekin to promote the admin
istrative reforms so greatly needed for
strengthening the Imperial government
and maintaining the Integrity of China,
in which we believed the whole West
ern world to be alike concerned. To
these ends 1 caused to be addressed to
the several powers occupying territory
and maintaining spheres of Influence in
China the circular proposals of 1899. In
viting from them declarations of th«.r
Intentions and views as to desirability
of the adoption of measures insuring the
benefits of equality of treatment of ail
foreigners throughout China.
With gratifying unanimity, the re
sponses coincided in this common policy,
enabling me to see in the successful ter
mination of these negotiations proof of
the friendly spirit which animates the
various powers Interested In the untram
ineled development of commerce and In
dustry In the Chinese Empire as a source
of vast benefit to the whole commercial
world.
I'oneri Acted In Concert.
In this conclusion, which 1 had the
gratification to announce as a completed
engagement to the Interested powe-s
March 20. 11**0, I hopefully discern a po
tential factor for the abatement of the
distrust of foreign purposes, which for
a year past had appeared to inspire the
policy of the imperial government, and
for the effective exertion by it of power
and authority to quell the critical and
foreign movement in the northern prov
inces most Immediately influenced by the
Manchu sentiment.
Seeking to testify confidence in the will
ingness and ability of the Imperial ad
ministration to redress the wrongs and
prevent the evils we suffered and feared,
the marine guard, which had been sent
to Pekin in the Autumn of 1K99 for the
protection of the legation, was with
drawn at the earliest practicable moment,
and all pending questions were remitted,
as far as wo were concerned, to the or
dinary resorts of diplomatic intercourse.
The Chinese Government proved, how
ever. unable to check the rising strength
of the Boxers and appeared to he a prey
to Internal dissensions. In the unequal
contest, the antl-toretgn Influences soon
gained the ascenduncy, under the leader
ship of Prince Tuan. Organized armies of
Boxers, with which the imperial forets
affiliated, held the country between Pekln
and the coast, penetrated into Manchuria
up to the Kussian border and through
their emissaries threatened a like rise
throughout Northern China. Attacks upon
foreigners, destruction of property ano
-daughter of native converts were re
ported from all sides. The Tsung 11
Yamun, already permeated with hostile
sympathies, could make no effective re
sponse to the appeals of the Legations.
At this critical juncture. In the early
Spring of the year, a proposul was made
by the othet powers that a combined
fleet be assembled in Chinese waters as a
moral demonstration, under cover of
which to exact of the Chinese Govern
ment respect for foreign treaty rights and
the suppression of the Boxers. The
United States, while not participating In
the joint demonstration, promptly sent
from the Philippines all ships that
be spared for service on the Chinese
coast. A small force of marines was
landed at Taku and sent to Pekln for the
protection of the American Legation.
Other powers took similar action until
some 400 men were assembled in the capi
tal as legation guards.
Still the peril increased. The Legations
reported the development of the seditious
movement In Pekln and the need of In
creased provision for defense against It
Tsklsg of Toko Ports.
While preparations were In progress for
a larger expedition to strengthen the
•legation guaids and keep the railway
opeu. an attempt of the foreign ships to
make a landing at Taku was met by
fire from the Chinese forts. The forts
were thereupon sh lied by the foreign ves
sels. the American Admiral taking no
part In the attack, on the ground that
we were not at war with China, and that
a hostile demonstration might consolidate
the anti-foreign elements and strengthen
the Boxers to oppose the relieving col
; umn. Two days later, the Taku rorts
were captured after a sanguinary con
flict Severance of communication with
( P.-kln followed, and a combined force ot
additional guards, which was advancing
to Pekln by the Pel Ho. was checked at
i Lang Fang. The Isolation ot the Leg.t
--' tlons was complete.
! By June 9. the Legations we't cut off.
| kn Identical note from the Yamun or
' dered each Minister to leave Pekln, und r
a promised escort, within 24 hours. To
gain time, they replied asking prolonga
tion of the time, which was afterward
granted, and requesting an Interview with
the Tsung U Yamun on the following
day. No reply being received, on the
morning of the 20th the German Minister.
Baron von Ketteler. set out for the Ya
i mun to obtain a response, and on the
I way was murdered. An attempt by the
legation guard to recover his body was
j foiled by the Chinese.
Pekln Legations Attacked.
Armed forces turned out against the
Legations. Their quarters were surround
ed and attacked. The mission compounds
were abandoned, their Inmates taking
refuge In the British legation, where all
the other legations and guurds gathered
| for more effective defense. Four hundred
i persons were crowded In Its narrow cora
j pass. Two thousand native converts w. re
assembled in a near-by place under pro
tection of the foreigners. Lines of defense
i were strengthened, trenches dug. barrl-
I cades raised and preparations made to
stand a siege, which at once began.
I With the negotiation of the partial
; armistice of July 14, a proceeding which
) was dc übtless promoted by the represen
; tattons of the Chinese envoy In Wash
; lngton, the way was opened for the con
! veyance to Mr. Conger of a test message
I sent by the Secretary of State through
i the kind offices of Minister VVu Ting
: Fang. Mr. Conger's reply, dispatched from
Pekln on July 18 through the same chan
| net, afforded to the outside world the
, first tidings that the Inmates of the le-
gatlons were alive and hoping for succor.
This news stimulated the preparations for
a Joint relief expedition, In numbers suffi
cient to overcome the resistance which
for a month had been organizing between
Taku and the capital. Reinforcements
sent by all the co-operating governments
were constantly arriving. The United
States contingent, hastily assembled from
the Philippines or dispatched from this
country, amounted to some 5000 men. un
der the able command of the lamented
Colonel Llscum and afterwards of Gen
eral Chaffee.
Rescue of Legatlonera.
Toward the end of July the movement
began. A severe conflict followed at Tien
Tsln, In which Colonel I-lscum was killed.
The city was stormed and partly de
stroyed. Its capture afforded the base
of operations from which to make the
final advance, which began In the first
days of August, the expedition being
made up of Japanese, Russian, British
and America.i troops at the outset. An
other battle was fought and won at
Yong Tsun. Thereafter, the disheartened
Chinese troops offered little show of re
sistance A few days later, the Impor
tant position of To SI Wo was taken. A
rapid march brought the united forces to
the populous City of Tung Chow, which
capitulated without a contest.
; On August 14, the capita) was reached.
After a brief conflict beneath the walls,
the relief column entered and the Lega
tions were saved. The United States
soldiers, sailors and marines, oflicers and
: men alike. In those distant climes and
unusual surroundings, showed the same
valor, discipline and good conduct and
gave proof of the same high degree of ln
i telligence and efficiency which have dis
tinguished them In every emergency.
The Imperial family and the govern-
mrnt had fled a few daya before. The
lily was without visible control. The
remaining irnpt rial soldiery liad made.
on the nigiit of the 13th. a last attempt
to exterminate the besieged, which was
gallantly repelled. It fell to the occupy*
ing forces to restore order and organize
a provisional administration.
The Russian Proposition.
The Russian proposition looking to the
restoration of the imperial power in Pe
kin has been accepted as in full con
sonance with our own desires, for we
have held and hold that effective repara
tion for wrongs suffered and an endur
ing settlement that will make their re
currence impossible can best be brought
about under an authority which the Chi
nese Nation reverences and obeys. While
so doing we forego no Jot of our un
doubted right to exact exemplary and de
terrent punishment of the responsible
authors and abettors of the criminal acta
whereby we and other nations have suf
fered grievous Injury.
For the real culprits, the evil coun
sellors who have misled the imperial
judgment and diverted the sovereign au
thority to their own guilty ends, full ex
piation becomes Imperative within the
rational limits of retributive justice. Re
garding this as the initial condition of
an acceptable settlement between China
and the powers, I said in my message
of October IS to the Chinese Kmperor:
"1 trust that negotiations may begin so
soon as we and the other offended gov
ernments shall be effectively satisfied of
Your Majesty's ability and power to
treat with just sternness the principal
offenders who are doubly culpable, not
alone toward the foreigners but toward
Your Majesty, under whose rule the pur
pose of China to dwell In concord with
the world has hitherto found expression
In the welcome and protection assured to
strangers.'"
Taking as a point of departure the
Imperial edict appointing Karl 1.1
Hung Chang and Prince t'hlng
plenipotentiaries to arrange a set
tlement, and the edict of September
25, whereby certain high officials were des
ignated for punishment, this Government
has moved In concert with the other
powers toward the opening of negotia
tions which M". Conger, assisted by Mr.
Kockhtll. has !>een authorized to conduct
on behalf of the United States.
(Jeneral bases of negotiations, formu
lated by the Government of the French
Republic, have been accepted with cer
tain reservations as to details, made
necessary by our own circumstances and
by like similar reservations by other
powers open to discussion In the prog
ress of the negotiations. The disposition
of the Kmperor's Government to admit
liability for wrongs done to foreign gov
ernments and their citizens and to act
upon such additional designation of the
gulllv persons us the foreign Ministers
at Pekin may be In a position to make
gives hope of a complete settlement of
all questions involved, assuring foreign
rights of residence and intercourse OP
terms of equality for all the world
I regard as one of the essential factors
of a durable adjustment the aeeurement
of adequate guarantees for liberty of
faith, since Insecurity of those natives
who mny embrace alien creeds is scarce
ly a less effectual assault upon the
rights of foreign worship and teaching
than would be the direct Invasion thereof.
Matter of Indemnity.
The matter of Indemnity for our
wronged citizens la a question of grave
concern Measured In money alone, a
sufficient reparation may prove to be be
yond the ability of China to meet. All
the powers concur In emphatic disclaim
ers of any purpose of aggrandizement
through the dismemberment of th* em
pire. 1 am dlspoaed to think that due
compensation may be made In part by
Increased guarantees of security for for
eign rights and Immunities, and most
Important of ail. by the opening of China
to the equal commerce of all the world.
These views have been and will be earn
estly advocated by our representatives.
The Government of Russia has put for
ward a suggestion that In the eventrfif a
protracted divergence of views In regard
to Indemnities, the matter may be rele
gated to the court of arbitration at The
Hague. I favorably Incline to this, be
lieving that high tribunal could not fall
to reach a solution no less conducive .to
the stability and enlarged prosperity of
China Itself than immediately beneficial
to the powers.
OTHER FOREIGN RELATIONS
Relatione With Germany.
Good will prevails In our relations with
the German Empire. An amicable adjust,
ment of the long pending question of the
admission of our life Insurance compa
nies to do busintss In Prussia has been
reached. One of the principal companies
has already been readmitted, and the way-
Is opened for the others to share the priv
ilege.
The settlement of the Samoan problem,
to which I adverted In my last message,
has accomplished good results. Peace and
contentment prevail in the Islands, espe
cially In Tutulla, where a convenient ad
ministration that has won the confidence
and esteem ot the kindly-disposed natives
has been organised under the direction
of the commander of the United States
naval station at Pango Pango.
An Imperial moat Inspection law been
enacted for Uermany. While It may sim
plify the Inspections, It prohibits certain
products heretofore admitted. There Is
still greut uncertainty as to whether our
well-nigh extinguished German trade In
meat products can revive under Its new
burdens. Much will depend upon regula
tions not yet promulgated, which we con
fidently hope will be free from the dis
criminations which attended the enforce
ment of the old statutes.
The remaining link in the new line of
direct telegraphic communication between
the United Slates and the German Em
pire has recently been completed, afford
ing a gratifying occasion for exchange of
friendly congratulations with the German
Emperor.
The Boer War.
Our friendly relations with Great Brit
aln continue. The war In South Africa
Introduced Important questions. A condi
tion unusual lit International wars was
presented in that while one belligerent
had control of the scus, the other had
no ports, shipping or direct trade, but
was only accessible through the territory
of a neutral. Vexatious questions arose
through Great Britain's action In respect
to neutral cargoes not contraband In
their own nature, shipped to Portuguese
South Africa, on the score of probable or
suspected ultimate destination to the
Boer states. Such consignments In Brit
ish ships, by which alone direct trade Is
kept up between our ports and South
Africa, were seized In application of 'a
law prohibiting British vessels from trad
ing with an enemy without regard to any
contraband character of the goods, while
cargoes shipped to Delagoa Bay In neutral
bottoms were arrested on the ground *t
alleged destination to the enemy's coun
try. Appropriate representation on our
part resulted In the British Government
agreeing to purchase outright all such
goods shown to be the actual property of
American citizens, thus closing the Inci
dent to the satisfaction of the Immediate
ly interested parties, although unfortu
nately without a broad settlement of the
question of a neutral's right to send
goods not contrband per se to a neutral
port adjacent to a belligerent area.
Alaska Boundary.
The work of marking certain provis
ional boundary points for convenience of
administration around the head of Lynn
Canal, In accordance with the temporary
arrangement of October, 1899. was com
pleted by a Joint survey In July last. Th#
modus vlvendl has so far worked without
friction and the Dominion Government
haa provided rules and regulations for
securing to our citizens the benefit of the
reciprocal stipulation that the citizens or
subjects of either power found by that
arrangement within the temporary Juris
diction of the oilier shall suffer no di
minution of lights and privileges they
have hitherto enjoyed. But. however
necessary such an expedient may have
betn to tide over the grave emergencies
of the situation, it is at best but an
unsatisfactory makeshift, which should
not be suffered to delay the speedy and
complete establishment of the frontier
line to which we are entitled under the
Kusso-American treaty for the cession of
Alaska.
In this relation, I may refer again to
the need of definitely marking the Alas
kan boundary where It follows the 141 st
meridian. A convention to that end has
been before the Senate for some two
years, hut as no action has been taken, I
contemplate negotiating a new convention
for a Joint determination of the meridian
by heliocentrls observations. These, aslt
is believed, will give more accurate and
unquestionable results than the sidereal
methods heretofore Independently fol
lowed. which, as Is known, proved dis
crepant at several points on the line, al
though not varying at any place more
than 700 feet.
The pending claim of R. H. May against
the Guatemalan Government has been
settled by arbitration, George F. B. Jen
ner, British Minister at Guatemala, who
was chosen as sole arbitrator, having
uwarded 1143,750 73 in gold to the claim
ant.
Various American claims against Haytt
have beeen or are being advanced to the
resort of arbitration.
As the result of negotiations with the
Government of Honduras in regard to the
indemnity demanded for the murder of
Frank H. Pears, in Honduras, that gov
ernment has paid SIO,OOO in settlement of
the claim of the heirs.
The assassination of King Humbert
called forth sincere expressions of sif
row from this Government and people,
and occasion was fitly taken io testily
to the Italian Nation the high regard here
felt for the memory of the lamented
ruler.
Money Returned to Mexico.
No noteworthy Incident has occurred In
our .elatlons with our Important south
ern neighbors. Commercial Intercourse
with Mexico continues to thrive and the
two governments neglect no opportunity
to fokter their mutual Interests In all
practicable ways.
Pursuant to the declaration of the Su
preme Court that the awards of the late
joint commission In the I.a Abra and
Weil claims were obtained through fraud,
the sum awarded In tne first case, $103.-
03C 08. has been returned to Mexico, and
the amount of the Weil award will be re
turned In like manner.
A convention indefinitely extending the
time for the labors for the United States
and Mexican international (water) bound
ary commission has been signed.
International Arbitration.
It Is with satisfaction that I am able
to announce the formal notification ot
The Hague, on September 4, of the depos
it of ratifications of the convention for
the pacltlc settlement of the International
disputes by lti powers, namely, the United
States. Austria, Belgium. Denmark Eng
land. France. Germany. Italy, Persia.
Portugal, Houmanla. Russia. Slam. Spain,
Sweden and Norway and The Nether
lands. Japan also has since ratified the
convention. The administrative council
of the permanent court of arbitration has
been organized, and it has adopted rules
or order and a constitution for the In
ternational Arbitration Bureau. In ac
cordance with article 23 of the convention
providing for the appointment by each
signatory power of persons of known
competency In questions of International
law us arbitrators I have appointed ns
members of this court. Hon. Benjamin
Harrison, of Indiana, ex-President of the
United States: Hon. Melville W. Fuiler,
of Illinois. Chief Justice of the United
States; John W. Griggs, of New Jersey.
Attorney-General of the United Slates,
and Hon. George Gray, of Delaware, a
Judge of the Circuit Court of the United
States
The Nicaragua Canal.
The Important matter of an lnteroceanlc
rana l has assumed a new nhase. Ad
hering to Its refusal to reopen the question
of the forfeiture of the contract of the
Maritime Canal Company, which was
terminated for alleged nonexecutlon In
October. 1899. the Government of Nicara
gua has since supplemented that action
by declaring the so-sty'ed Eyre-Cragln
option void for nonpayment of the stipu
lated advance. Protests In relation to
these acts have been filed In the State
Department, and are under consideration.
Deeming Itself relieved from existing en
gagements, the Nicaragua Government
shows a disposition to deal freely with
the canal question, either In the way ol
negotiations with the United Stntes or by
taking measures to promote the water
way. Overtures for a convention to effect
the building of a canal under the auspices
of the United States are under considera
tion. In the meantime, the views of Con
gress upon the subject In the light ol
the report of the committee appointed to
examine the comparative merits of the
various trana-lsthmlan ship caual proj
ects may be awaited.
I commend to the early attention of
ttie Senate the convention with Great
Britain to facilitate the construction ol
such a canal, and to remove any objec
tion whlth might arise out of the conven
tion commonly called the Clayton-Bul
wer treaty.
Relatloas With Spain.
Satisfactory progress has been made
toward the conclusion of a general treaty
of friendship and Intercourse with Spain
In replacement of the old treaty, which
passed Into abeyance by reason of the
late war. A new convention of extradi<
tlon Is approaching completion, and I
would be much pleased were a commer
cial arrangement to follow. I feel that
we should not suffer to pass an oppor
tunity to reaffirm the cordial ties that
existed between us and Spain from the
time of our earliest Independence, and to
enhance the mutual benefits of that com
mercial Intercourse which Is natural be
tween the two countries.
By the terms of the treaty of peace,
the line bounding the ceded Philippine
group on the southwest failed to Include
several small Islands lying west of the
Sulus, which have always been recog
nized as under Spanish control. The oc
cupation of Slbutu and Cagayau. Sulu.
by our naval forces elicited a claim on
the part of Spain, the cesentlal equity
of which could not be gainsaid. In order
to cure the defect of the treaty by re
moving all possible ground of future mis
understanding respecting the Interpreta
tion of Its third article, I directed the
negotiation of a supplementary treaty,
which will be forthwith laid before the
Senate, whereby Spain quits all title and
claim of title to the Islands named, as
well as to any and all islands belonging
to the Philippine Archipelago lying out
side the lines described In said third ar
ticle, and agrees that all such Islands
shall be comprehended In the cession of
the archipelago as fully as if they had
been expressly Included within those lines.
In consideration of this cession the United
States Is to pay Spain the sum of SIOO,OOO.
A bill la now pending to effect the rec
ommendation made In my last annual
message, that appropriate legislation he
had to carry Into execution article 8
of the treaty of peace with Spain, by
which the United States assumed the
payment of certain claims for Indem
nity of Its citizens against Spain. I ask
that action be taken to fulfill this obli
gation.
The King of Sweden and Norway has
accepted the Joint Invitation of the
United States. Germany and Great Brit
ain to arbltra.e claims growing eut of
losses sustained in the Samoan Islands In
the course of military operations made
necessary by the disturbances in 1809.
Our claims upon the Government of the
Sultan for reparation for injuries suf
fered by American citizens in Armenia
and elsewhere give promise of early and
satisfactory settlement. His Majesty's
good disposition in this regard has been
evidenced b ythe issuance of an trade for
"■ebuiiding the American college at Har
pcot.
CONDITIONS IN PHILIPPINES.
Recommendations for a Civil Gov
ernment for tbe Islands.
In my last annual message I dwelt at
some length upon the condition of af
fairs in the Philippines. While seeking
to Impress upon you that the grave re
sponsibility of the future government of
those Islands rests with the Congress of
the I'niled States, I abstained from rec
ommending ut that time a specific and
final form of government for the terri
tory actually held by the United States
forces, and In which, as long as the in
surrection continues, the military arm
must necessarily be supreme. I stated
my purpose, until the Congress shall
have made known the formal expression
of Its will, to use the authority vested
in me by the Constitution aod the stat
utes to uphoid the sovereignty of the
United States in these distant islands, as
in all otht'i places where our tiag right
fully floats, placing to that end at the
disposal of th; Army and Navy all the
means which the liberality of the Con
gress and the people have provided. No
contrary expression of the will of the
Congress having been made, 1 have
steadfastly pursued the purpose so de
clared. employing the civil arm as well
toward the accomplishment of pacifica
tion and the institution of local govern
ments within the lines of authority and
law.
Progress In the hoped-for direction has
been favorable. Our forces have suc
cessfully controlled the greater part of
the Islards. overcoming the organized
forces o.' the insurgents, and carrying
order and administrative regularity to
all quarters. What opposition remains is
for the most part scattered, obeying no
concerted plan of strategic action, oper
ating only by the methods common to
the traditions of guerrilla warfare, which,
while ineffective to alter the general eon
trol now established, are still sufficient
to beget Insecurity among the popula
tions that have felt the good results of
our control, and thus delay the confer

of local self-government, of education
and of Industrial and agricultural devel

By the Spring of this year the effective
opposition of the dissatisfied Tagals to
the authority of the United States was
virtually enoed. thus opening the door
for the extension of a stable administra
tion over much of the territory of the
archipelago Desiring to bring this about,
I appointed In march last a civil com
mission. composed of the Hon. William
H. Taft, of Ohio; Professor Dean C.
Worcester, of Michigan; Hon. I-uke K.
Wright, ol Tennessee; Hon. Henry C.
Ide. of Vermont, and Professor Bernard
Moses, of California. The alms of their
mission and he scope of their authority
are clearly set forth in Instructions of
April 7. 1900, addressed to the Secretary
of War, to be transmitted to them.
PORTO RICO AND CUBA.
Success In the Former—Progress
Toward Cuban Autonomy.
The civil government of Porto Rico
provided for by the act of the Congress
approved April 12. 19U0. Is In successful
operation. The courts have been estab
lished; the Governor and his associates
working Intelligently and harmoniously,
are making a commendable success. On
the 6th of November a general election
was held In the island for members of
the legislature and the body has been
called to convene on the first Monday ot
December.
I recommend that legislation be enacted
by Congress conferring upon the Secre
tary of the Interior supervision over the
public lands In Porto Rico, and that he
be directed to ascertain the location and
quantity of lands the title to which re
mained in the crown of Spain at the date
the cession of Porto Rico to the United
Slates, and that appropriations for sur
veys be made and the methods of the
disposition of such lands be prescribed
by law.
On the 25th of July. 1900, I directed
that a call be issued for an election In
Cuba for members of a constitutional
convention to frame a constitution as a
basis for a stable and Independent gov
ernment In (he Island. In pursuance
thereof the Military Governor Issued the
following Instructions:
"Whereas. The Congress of the United
Slates by Its Joint resolution of April 20.
IKW, declared that the people of the
Island of Cuba are and of right ought to
be free and Independent; that the Un'ted
States hereby disclaims any disposition
or intention to exercise sovereignty. Juris
diction or control over the said Island,
except for the pacification thereof, and
asserts Its determination when that Is
accomplished to leave the government
and control of the Island to Its people;
and whereas the people of Cuba have es
tablished municipal governments, deriv
ing their authority from the suffrages
of the people given under Just and tflual
laws, and are now ready. In like manner
to proceed to the establishment of a
general government whlc% shall assume
and exercise sovereignty, Jurl-d.ctl n and
control over the Island: therefore. It Is
ordered that a general election be held
In the Island of Cuba on the third Sat
urday of September. In ti . year 1900, for
delegates t.> A convention to meet In the
City of Havana at 12 noon on the first
Monday of November, In the year 1900,
to frame and adopt a constitution for the
people of Cuba, and as a part thereof
to provide for and agree with the gov
ernment of the United States upon the
relations to exist between tnat govern
ment and the Government of Cuba, and
lo provide for election by the people of
officers under such constitution and to
transfer the government to the officers so
elected.
"The election will be held In the several
voting precincts of the Island under and
pursuant to the piovlsions of the electoral
law of April IS, 1900, and the amend
ments thereof."
The election was held on the 15th of
September, and the convention assembled
on the sth of November, 1900, and 1s now
In session. In calling the convention to
order the Military Governor of Cuba made
the following statement:
"As Military Governor of the Island,
representing the President of the United
States. 1 call this convention to order. It
will be your duty tlrst to frame and adopt
a constitution for Cuba, and when that
has been done, to formulate what. In
your opinion, ought to be the relations
between Cuba and the United States.
The constitution must be adequate to se
cure a stable, orderly and free govern
ment. When you have formulated the re
lations which. In your opinion, ought to
exist between Cuba and the United States,
the Government of the United States will
doubtless take such action on Its part as
shall lead to a final and authoritative
agreement between the people of the two
countries to the promotion of their com
mon Interests. All friends of Cuba will
follow your deliberations with the deepest
Interest, earnestly desiring that you shall
reach Just conclusions, and by the dig
nity, Individual self-restraint and wise
conservatism which shall characterize
your proceedings the capacity of the Cu
ban people for representative government
may be signally illustrated. The funda
meuUl distinction between true republl
can giivirnmont and dictatorship Is that
the former Is represfntativc of the peo
ple. In whatever office he confines him
self sttlctly within the limits of his de
fined powers. Without such restraint
there can be no free constitutional gov
ernment Under the Older pursuant to
which you have been elected and con
ven»d. you have no duty and no authority
to take part in the present government of
the island. Your powers are strictly lim
ited by the terms of that order.
"When the convention concludes Its la
bor I will transmit to the Congress the
constitution as framed by the convention
for Its consideration and for such action
as It may deem advisable."
FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS
Army Slionld Be 80,000 to 100.000
The Xavy, I'ostottieea, Etc.
The J resent strength of the Army Is
100.000 men—6s,ooo regulars and £>,(M> vol
unteers. Under the act of March 2, 1899,
on the 30th ot June next the present vol
unteer force will be discharged and the
Regular Army will be reduced to 24ii
officers end 20.023 enlisted men. In 18X8
a board of officers convened by President
Cleveland adopted a comprehensive
scheme of coast del'ens and fortifications
which involved the outlay of something
over J100.C00.000. This plan received the
approval of the Congress and since then
regular apropriatlons have been made and
the work of fortification has steadily
progressed. More than 364,000000 have
been invested in a gnat number of forta
and guns, with all the complicated and
scientific machinery and electrical appli
ances necessary for their use. The proper
care of this defensive machinery requires
men trained In its use. The number of
men necessary to perform this duty alone
is ascertained by the War Department,
at a minimum allowance, to be 18 120.
There are 58 or more military posts In
ttie United States other than the coast
defense fortifications. The number of
these posts Is being constantly Increased
by Congress. More than $22.(100.000 have
been expended In building and equipping
them and they can only be cared lor
by the Regular Army. The posts now in
existence and others to be built provide
accommodations for. and. If fully gar
risoned. require 26.000 troops. Many ot
these posts are along our frontier or at
important strategic points, the occupa
tion of which Is necessary. We have In
Cubs between 5000 and 6000 troops. For
the present oui troops In that Island can
not be withdrawn or materially dimin
ished. certainly not until the conclusion
of the labors of the constitutional conven
tion now in session and a government pro
vided »y the National Constitution shCTuld
have been established and its stability
assur- d. In Porto Rico we have re
duced .he garrisons to 1636. which Include
896 na'lvt troops. Th' re Is no room for
further reduction here. We will be re
quired to keep a considerable force in
the Philippine Islands for some time to
come. From the best Information ob
tainable we shall need there for the im
mediate future from 50.6C0 to 60 000 men.
I am sure the number may be reduced as
the Insurgents shall come to acknowledge
the authority of the United States, of
which there are assuring indications.
It must be apparent that we will re
quire an army of about 60.000, and that
during present conditions in Cuba and
the Philippines the President should have
authority to Increase the force to the
present number of 100.000. Included In
this, authority should be given to raise
native troops In the Philippines up to
13 000. which the Taft commission believes
will be more effective in detecting and
suppressing guerillas, assassins and la
drones than our own soldiers.
The full discussion of this subject by
the Secretary of War in his annual re
port is called to your earnest attention.
Tkr Navy.
Very efficient service has been rendered
by the Navy In connection with the Insur
rection In the Philippines, and the recent
disturbance In China.
A very satisfactory settlement has been
made of the long-pending question of the
manufacture of armor-plates. A reason
able price haei been secured, and the
necessity for a Government armor-plate
plant avoided.
I approve of the recommendations of
the Secretary of the Navy for new ves
sels and for additional officers and men
which the required increase of the Navy
makes necessary.
The Hawaiian Islands.
Much Interesting information Is given m
the report of the Governor of Hawaii as
to the progress and development of the
islands during the period from July 7,
1898. the date of ;he approval of the Joint
resolution of the Congress providing for
their annexation up to April 30. 1960, the
date of the approval of the act providing
a government for the territory and there
after. The last Hawaiian census, taken
In the year 1896, jrives a total population
of 109.020, of which 31,019 were native Ha
wnllans. The number of Americans re
ported was 8485. The results of the Fed
eral census taken this year show the
islands to have a total population of 154-
001, snowing an Increase over that report
ed in 1896 of 44.981. or 41.2 per cent. Thern
has been marked progress In educational,
agricultural and railroad development of
the islands.
In the Territorial act of April 90, 1108,
section 7 of said act repeals chapter 34
of the civil laws of Hawaii, whereby the
Government was to assist In encouraging
and developing the agricultural resources
of the Republic, especially Irrigation.
The Governor of Hawaii recommends leg
islation looking to the development of
such water supply as may exltt on th#
public lands, with a view of promoting
land settlement. The earnest considera
tion of the Congress Is Invited to Hjis
Important recommendation and others as
embodied In the icport of the Secretary
of the Interior.
The Twelfth Census.
The Director of the Census states that
the work in connection wl'h the t'th cen
sus la progressing favorably. This Na
tional undertaking, ordered by the Con
gress each decade, has Anally resulted in
the collection of an agregation of statis
tical facts to determine the irdustrtal
growth of the country Its manu'acturlng
and mechanical resources. Its r.chne.-B in
mines and forests, the numbers of Its
agricultural districts, their farms and
products. Its educational and religious op
portunities. as well us ouestlous pertain
ing to sociological co-<'lt'ons.
Precaution Against Extravngaacc.
In our gre.t prosperity we must guard
against the dangers It Invites In ex'rav
agance In government expend'tures and
appropriations, and the chosen repr sen
tatlves of the people w 11.1 doubt n -t. fur
nish an example in thetr leglslat'on of
that wise economy which. In a season of
plenty, husbands for the future. In this
era of great business activity and oppor

not abate but strengthen our conHd ncc.
It will not retard but promote 1 gtlmate

Our growing power brings w'th It temp

principles of equality and justice upon
