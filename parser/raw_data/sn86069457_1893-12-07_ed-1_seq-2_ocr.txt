Sensation at Uniontown
For several weeks tho people in tho
neighborhood of Uniontown havo been
missing fine fattening hogs from their
pens On last Wednesday night fivo
plethoric porkers wero stolen from J
W Cowans place and that gentleman
at once began search for tho missing
hogs He traced them to tho slaugh
ter pen of Wm Hurst butcher De
tcctivo Spencer was engaged to work
up the caso and arrived at Uniontown
yesterday On last night he caused
tho arrest of Wm Hurst Geo North
orp Geo Friend and a German whose
given name is Casper It is thought
that Mr bpenccr who is a jovi il and
innocent looking man ingratiated
himself into the confidence of Geo
Northorp alias Shorty by placing a
few drinks where they would do the
most good and thus got his victim in
a communicative state of mind Mr
Spencer was so exhilarating that Mr
Northorp made a confident of the
Detective and told him tho secret of
running a butcher shop without ex-
pense Ho also gave the names of
those forming the syndicate at Union-
town Mr Hurst denies being an ac
complice in the matter as do the
others Tho prisoners are under
guard awaiting the examining trial
