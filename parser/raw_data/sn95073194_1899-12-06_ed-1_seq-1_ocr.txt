., MANILA. Dec. 2. General Conen
has surrendered 800 officers and men
with rifles, several American and sev-
cnty Spanish prisoners and the garri-
"" son at Bayambong, province of Nueva
: Viscaya. to Lieutenant Monroe with
". fiftv men of thjL Fourth cavalry.
.; - WASHINGTON. Dec. 2. Considcra-
' hlc interest is felt here in the news
that the insurgents at Bayambong
have surrendered, particularly as the
number is said to exceed that captured
by the United States troops ct any one
time.
Bayambong is the city to which Ag
uinaldo at one time contemplated re
treating tor the purpose of locating the
lebel capital after he was forced to
flee from Tarlac. but the American
troops pressed him so hard that he was
unable to carry out his intention. Gen
eral Otis' dispatch of today, repeat
ing information received from General
Lawton. said it indicated tint Bayam
bong had been captured on the 28th of
November and it is thought this is the
same place referred to in the Manila
dispatch. No information regarding
t he-surrender had been received at the
war department up to an arly hour
this morning.
WASHINGTON. Decc. 2. The cab
inet today discussed briefly the presi
dent's message, to which th finishing
touches have been placed, except to
that portion relating to the Philip
pines. This section of the message is
being hc:d up in the hope that the
president may be able to announce the
complete collapse of the insurrection
"before it goes to congress. Members
cf the cabinet are unanimously of the
opinion that the rebellion is on its last
legs and that any day may s-e the end.
"The Philippine question Is solving
itself," is the way one member put it
today.
The president nas decided not to
fend the message to congress until
1 ucsday, as the immediate adjourn
ment of the senate upon the t nnounce
ment of the death or Vice President
Hobart would preclude its being read
on Monday.
NEW YORK. Dec. 2. A special dis
patrh to the Herald from Manila says
General Lawton is at ilambcng. twenty
miles south of Bayambong, in the Cay
gayen valley.
He is in telegraphic communication
with the insurgents over the wire in
their possession, and com masquers tf
the opposing forces are .'jnsidering
propositions made by telegraph look
ing to the surrender of tae rebels to
tr.e Americans.

CINCINNATI. D.. Dec. 2. There is
a movement on this side of the river,
as well as in Kentucky, to present the
name of Governor Bradley for the
nomination for vice president on the
next ticket with McKinley. Soon after
the election of Governor Bradley four
years ago there were factional trou--bles
that defeated Dr. Hunter cs the
republican caucus candidate for sena

doubt about Kentucky sending a solid
delegation to the republican conven
tion for McKinley and Bradley on the
next ticket.

WASHINGTON, Dec 2. At a Con
ference .of about twenty-five promi
nent house republicans held at the
capitol tonight it was decided that thd
eligibility of Representative" Robert?
of Utah to occupy a seat in the house
should be investigated and determined
and that pending the decision he
should not be permitted to take the
cath of office.
This decision was arrived at by
those present without a dissenting
voice. Representative Tayler of Obid,
who will have charge of the matter in
the house, explained after the confer
ence had adjourned that this proceed
ing docs not involve a pre-judgment
of the case, but irrespective of party,
will afford the members an oppor
tunity to vote after a thorough Inves
tigation and complete presentation
of the case for consideration.
Mr. Tayler had made a study of the
allegations and precedents and pre
sented them at length to his col
leagues. He offered a plan of proced-
i ure which was agreed to after a gen
! cral exchange of views. The proced
ure is to be as follows:
When Mr. Roberts appears at the
bar of the house to take the oath ob
jection is to be made upon the ground
that he is ineligible. He will then
step aside and after the other mem
bers are sworn in the member mak
ing the objection who probably will
be Mr. Tayler will recite the allega
tions and offer a resolution for their
investigation by a special committee.
This will give the house an oppor
tunity to vote in the first instance on
the question of postponing the ad
ministration of the oath until after
the allegations have been investigated.
The resolutions have not been for
multed yet, but they will include the
investigation cf the charge that Mr.
Roberts' alleged conviction of viola
tion of the Edmunds act in 1889 ren
ders him inel.gible by the terms of
that act. whether the fact that he is
an avowed polygamist renders him in
eligible and whether tne state of Utah
in electing him has not violated the
compact by which it obtained state
hood. WILL Of HOBART IS fILED.

LONDON, Dec. 1. The Post militaiy
expert says: "Save for the list of .cas
ualties there is still no news from Gen
eral Metheun. He was among the
wounded which may in a measure ac
count for the prolonged uncertainty
as to his 'present position. It is dif
ficult to account for his description of
fighting as desperate and hard, if the
river divided the combatants. It is
boped the wound which General Me
suffered is not sufficiently important
to deprive him of his command.
"News from Mafeking brings our
knowledge of the investment up to
November 24, and despite a somewhat
despondent telegram that supplied our
latest previous information, we are
convinced that Mafeking has in it still
a good deal of fight The government
has at last decided to mobolize the
second division of the second army
corps and it will doubtless be des
patched as speedily as possible. We
are living in a state of suppressed in
terrogation. Every man has his little
question to put at the proper time and
at some one whom he desires to see
pilloried. Before putting the question
with which he is at present choking,
let each man ask himself, when cavil
ling at our unpreparedness, whether he
would willingly pay the price of being
prepared."

as follows in the matter:
"I have not said nor written any
thing for or against any candidate for

NEBRASKA CITY, Neb., Dec. 1.
The condition of Senator Hayward this
evening shows -little change from what
it was twenty-four hours ago. He
passed an uncomfortable night and has
been very restless and uneasy today.
Dr. Whitten spent most of the night at
his bedside and has watched him close
ly during the day. At 6 o'clock tonight
he issued the following bullotin:
"Senator Hayward has had a very
restless day, having slept very little.
His temperature is 100, pulse 89, regu
lar and softer than in the morning;'
respiration 24 and still intermitting.
He is more conscious of his condition,
as he manifested more concern about
himself. Paralysis remains the same."
The fact that the patient is more
conscious of his condition is taken by
Dr. Whitten as a good symptom,, in
that it shows that his mind is brighter.
.and more free, indicating partial ab
sorption of the clot, and yet if he be
comes greatly concerned and worried
the effect is likely to be unfavorable.
Major E. B. Hayward, the senator's
brother, together with his wife, arriv
ed from Davenport, la., at 9:30 this
morning and has been at his brother's
bedside almost the entire day. The
scene in the sick room upon .he major's
entrance was very affecting. Senator
Hayward recognized his brother in
stantly and apparently made a supreme
effort to speak to him. Failing to utter
a single intelligible word, he burst into
tears and could not be quieted for some
time. Mrs. Hayward was finally pre
vailed upon to take a few hours' rest
last night and as a consequence is feel
ing much better physically today. How
ever, her concern about her husband's
condition is as great as ever.

Two Accident?, One Fatal.
NEWPORT, Neb., Nov. 29. Two
bad accidents happened yesterday
southeast of town. The 4-year-old son
of Fritz Newel was playing with the

door yard. On an investigation the
little fellow was found to be suffering
from the effects of a broken leg. It is
thought the boy, who bad a rope, at
tached to the aog, became entangled
with the rope and the dog running to
free Itself, broke the child's leg.
Sunday afternoon John Hagermon

boys were left to amuse themselves
as best they could. They found a bot
tle of medicine whici their father had
procured for summer complaint, com
pounded of some preparation of opium,
and drank it, not knowing of the dan
gerous effects of the medicne. One
of the boys vomited me poison up and
is living. The other little fellow died.

Winter Agrlcaltnral Conrar.
LINCOLN, Neb., Dec. 2. The uni
versity of Nebraska has issued a circu
lar descriptive of the winter course in
the school of agriculture The people
in charge of the school realize the fact
that most farmers' sons and daughters
cannot afford to spend the time and
money required in the preparation for
and completion of the regular college
course and keeping this in view they
have prepared a short practical course
of three months, beginning January 2,
1900, and ending March 17. It provides
for studies of soils, field crops, diseases
of farm animals breeding of live stock,
feeding of like stock, dairying, horti
culture, agriculture, engineering, car
pentry and blacksmithing. insects in
jurious to crops, plant pests, farm ac
counts and English. An explanation
given in the circular of the manner in
which the instruction is gives shows
that the student obtains much of it by
means of actual practice and observa
tion. Not that he will be expected o
do the work on the farm wwith which
he is already familiar, but such opera
tions as stock judging, mi'k testin?.
creamery operations, tree grafting,
treating sick animals, etc. No exam
inations are required for entrance, but
a registration fee of f 1 is charged. The
cost to each student last year for room
rent, table board, books, etc., was
about $36.
In preparing the course of instruction
the object has been to make it as prac
tical as possible, to give the student
something that win be of value to him
when he returns to the farm. The in
struction is given by means of lectures
and actual practice. Excellent facili
ties have recently been piovided at
the state farm for giving Instruction in
the most practical manner. A well
equipped building has been erected,
containing a dairy room, a rtot-g-judg-ing
room and a laboratory for soil
study. The methods of instruction are
adapted to students of all iges. those
having taken the work varying from
16 to i- years of age.
