Uook Same Shows Offered in
Denver and San Francisco.
A. H. Hagan. formerly proprietor of
the Novelty theater in this city, who
returned here a few- days ago, will pro
bably close the deal today for a long
time lease on the old state printing
plant building on East Eighth street,
and acting as agent for the Western
Vaudeville association, will convert that
building into a high class vaudeville
house, playing at 10 and 20 cents all
the biggest vaudeville attractions on
the road.
The proposed new theater will play
nll the attractions which are booked at
Denver and San Francisco playhouses
of the Western Vaudiville association,
and will include all the acts of the so
called Novelty circuit, the Considine
circuit, and other leading vaudeville
circuits.
"People are demanding- a better class
of vaudeville than can be given in the
store room theaters," said Mr. Hagan
today. "They want the more expensive
attractions which demand more room.
That is what the Western Vaudeville
association proposes to put in here at
the state printing plant building, and I
nm here to negotiate for the lease of
that building. I expect the papers will
be signed up this afternoon.
"The new theater will probably be
called The Majestic. It is the purpose
of the Western Vaudeville association
to expend about $15,000 in remodeling
and equipping the building. It will be
converted into a stiictly modern and
vp-to-date vaudeville theater, with all
the modern protections against danger
from fire.
"I expect that the work of remodeling
the building will begin immediately upon
the closing of the deal for the in yeir
lise on the building. It will probably
take 6"' days to get the building ready for
v.se. I will not be the manager of the
theater. I am simply acting for the
Western Vaudeville association in mak
ing arrangements for the possession of
the bulid:n. -
"The proposed arrangement will give us
a ten year lcnj;e on the building, with
( ption to purchase the property at any
time."
The old state printing plant Is in a fine
location for a theater. It fronts on East
Eighth street, and the alley extends along
The whole west side of the building, giving
plenty of opportunity for exits, it Is two
stories hleh. with a very high basement,
making almost the equivalent of three
Ftor'es. The building has' never been cur,
v.p with partitions, having crnsisted of
me lar-e room on ear-h floor, and It Is
thus easily converted into a theater. The
building Is lv feet deep, and has a front
age of 50 feet. The expenditure of T15.000
will put the structure into splendid shape
for the purpose of a vaudeville house.
The building is owned by eastern par
ties, who are represen 3 1 in Torieka by

GO BACK TO A FAIR.
Directors Decide That a Race Meet
Doesn't 1'ill Requirements.
The next state fair held in Topeka will
be one of the real old-time sort, with the
beef steer and his sister, the helpful hen,
and all the other side Issues in evidence.
This was the decision reached by the
board of directors of the Kansas State
Fair association, who held their annual
meeting Friday afternoon. The race meet
held this fail did not come ur to the ex
pectations of the association, and the I
stockholders charge the failure to the i
omission of the regular oid-ttme state fair j
features. i
The race meet held this fall paid a lit
tle more than expenses, but was uniatis- j
factory. In days past the oid-fas-ned
fairs brought In money and were well at
tended by farmers from all over the
country. Tha race mct was attends!
principally by local people, and the In
ducements to the farmers were few. The
business men of the. city profit little from
a race meet, but are largely benefited by
reason of a visitation of outsiders. s the
fairs of the future will be. real fairs.
A special meeting of the board of direc
tors w ill be. called some time in JVnuarv to
further arrange for the fair next tall, and i
the date, of the fair will be decided upon
pt that meeting. It is generally understood '
among the directors tfiat the date will be
set later in the season than -l.retofnre
probably during the last week of Septem
ber. Eighteen out of the twenty-four direc
tors wrj-e present at the meet'ng Friday
afternoon, and complete harmony pre
vailed. 1 he accounts show tht the race
meet of this fall more than pai v e'xpenses.
but that the association was still in debt
on account of unsuccessful fairs of former
years.
With only one exception, the same offi
cers were elected for the next year. bZ. H.
Crosbv succeeds B. F. Pankey as first vice
president. The other officers who hold over
are- President. M A. Low; second vice
president. T. B. Babst; secretary. ' R. - T.
Krelpe- treasurer. C. K. Jewell.
H. A. Heath, editor of the Kansas Farm
er, was elected delegate to the State Board
of Agriculture.
HALE GOT NOTHING.
Made His First Crill for Money on the
County Treasurer.
M- M. H-ale, city treasurer, made his
first Saturday trip to the county treas
urer's office to discover the amount of
taxes due the city, collected and to ac
cept the same on behalf of the city.
This is the first of the weekly trips
on each Saturday which the city treas
urer will have to make under a resolu
tion nassed by the council last week
Monday and introduced by Council
man Hughes.
The city treasurer doesn't think
very much of the resolution and the
end that it is intended for. He was in
clined to feel disgusted this morning.
His trip was fruitless. He went
. through the formality of fallowing the
instructions contained in the resolu
tion, knowing in advance that it would
be impossible for him to get any of the
taxes due the city and returned to his
office at the city hall.
"I knew that's the way it would be,"
aid Mr. Hale. "Why, it's a physical
impossibility for the people down at
the county treasurer's office to tell at
this time what is due the city. So this
Ula la ail for nothing."
WEXT DOWN TO 20 DEGREES.
That Was the Coldest Mark of the
Present Snappy Weather.
There has been no change in the
weather during the last twenty-four
hours and the same conditions with a little-modification
for fair and warmer will
prevail for the next 24 hours. The max
imum today is a little ahead of yesterday
and the minimum a little lower. The
maximum yesterday was thirty degrees
and the minimum this morning was 20

ROSE PAYS $!,562,64.
Settles With the Supreme Court for
His Alleged Contempt.
W. W. Rose, former mayor of Kansas
City, Kan., who was ousted from office by
C. C. Coleman, the attorney general, be
cause of his failure to enforce trie pro
hibitory law in that city and also his con
nivance at its violation, has purged him
self finally from contempt of tlit: supreme
court of the state.
Mr. Rose was rined J1.000 for contempt
for again assuming the office of mayor af
ter he had been ousted fro.-n it. The
United States supreme court affirmed the
decision. Not long ago he wrote a"" letter to
the judges of the court, asking that this
tine be remitted, on the ground that be
did not mean to show contempt lor the
court in any of his actions and that all of
them had been taken on the advice of
"good lawyers." Attorney General Cole
man protesiel against the fine being re
mitted and the court refused Mr. Kose's
request.
Del Valentine, the clerk of the court, re
ceived today by mail a check from Mr.
Hose, paying his line for contempt, ana
also the costs of the actions, which were
charged against him. These costs amount
ed to $502.64. and tne amount of the tine
therefore brought the sum he had to pay
lo the state up to 1, 562.64, and the check
was for this amount.
Mr. Rose had a number of lawyers on
his staff looking after his interests in the
various proceedings against him, so it is
likely that the expense of the whole af
fair 'was several thousand dollars.
KILLlOfi MUST STAY.
Governor Declines to Interfere With
Sentence of Cowley Co. Man.
Governor Hoch has declined to follow
the reco.n mendations of the state parole
board that he extend executive clemency
to Phil Killion. by granting him a parole.
Killion was sentenced in 11M3 to the state
penitentiary for a term of twenty-five
years for manslaughter. He killed a police
officer at Wellington, who attempted to
arrest him. His original term of Imprison
ment was commuted to twenty years by
Governor I'ailey for heroic acts of his at
the penitentiary in putting out a fire in
the mine and helping to quell a mutiny.
For the last few years Killion has be.en
one of the trusties at the prison and his
conduct there has been exemplary. Some
weeks ago the parole board retTTimended
to thegovernor that he be given -his free--dom
tinder a governor's parole." A few
years ago, and while in prison. Killion
purchased some tickets in one ii the Kan
sas City convention hall guess, ng contests
and won a prize of Jo.Oi. Somer-nf-this
money has been invested for him in real
estate and the balance is held by the war
den of the penitentiary. Killion had made
it known that if he was paroled it was
his intention to purchase a small farm and
end his days on it.
The sentiment among- the people of
Cowlev county was strong against execu
tive elemenev be shown hinf and Govern
nor Koch decided not to Issue him a parole
because of his bad record tfeiore he, was
sent to prison. "-:" . ";K

Proxxrty to Sons.
The will of the late Samuel Barnes was
filed just before noon today and leaves
all of his property to his three sons and
entirely ignores his wife with whom he
was having trouble at the time of his
death. The will, which was witnessed by
Ruth Stone and Maybelle Parks, and

MONTANA IS LAUNCHED
Xcw Cruiser Is Christened by Miss
Minnie Conrad.
Newport News, Va., Dec. 15. The
T'nlted States armored cruiser Montana
was successfully launched at the New
port" News ship yard today in the pres
ence of a lar-e number of people. The
vessel was christened by Miss Minnie
Conrad, daughter of W. G. Conrad, of
Montana. Governor Toole of that
state was represented by Martin Ma
ginnis. former territorial delegate in
congress. Senator Carter and Repre
sentative Dixson, also were present.
The navy was not officially repre
sented. After the launching the sponsor's
party was entertained at breakfast.
The Montana is about 58 per cent
completed and is a sister ship to the
North Carolina, launched here Oc
tober 6. Her contract calls for a speed
of twenty-tvo knots.

made a number of recommendations,
was rend today before the constitu
tional convention. One suggestion was
the creation of a board of corporations.
He also urged the convention to adopt
th! initiative and referendum and the
nomination of all officers by the pri
mary system. The committee cn fed

proposal of two amendments to the
United States constitution, one for the
election of the United States senators

SANTA FE TRIES IT
Invention of C. S. L. Uaker In
stalled in Kailway Coach.
H ill Revolutionize Many Known
Principles of Physics.
POWER IS MULTIPLIED.
Depends on Principle of Friction
and Superheated Steam.
Halle Waggner the Man Who
Gave 15aker a Start.
Is C. S. L. Baker, a negro, destined
to go down in history as a man who
has revolutionized heating methods, the
production of mechanical power, and
the foundation principles of physics?
Baker is a man who claims to be able
to take three horse-power of electricity,
and convert it into five horse-power in
steam. On the same principle he can
convert the five horse-power into ten,
and keep on multiplying indefinitely.
This is the heretofore unsolved principle
of perpetual motion.
The Santa Fe railway management
has bo much confidence 1n Mr. Baker's
wonderful invention that it has allow
ed him to equip one of its coaches on
the train which runs between St. Jos
eph and Topeka with his new fangled
heater. ' The work has been done at
the Santa Fe shops in this city, and
the car is now ready for its first trip.
If the heater does what Mr. Baker
says It will." it means that the Santa
Fe will equip all its coaches with the
new system of heating as quickly as
possible.
The Chicago Great Western is experi
menting with a similar heater, and so
is the St. Louis Electric Street railway,
and the Atchison Street railway.
Balie Waggener of Atchison was the
first man to give Mr. Baker a start. He,
allowed him to install one of his heat
ers on an Atchison street car, and it
is giving good satisfaction, so Mr.
Baker says. The heater was put into
service 30 days ago.
Now about the wonderful heater
for it certainly is wonderful. It con
sists of two cylinders of iron. Inside
of the inner cylinder is a core of steel,
and fitted around this core are four
pieces: of hickory wood which occupy
nearly all the remaining space in the
inner cylinder. Between the inner and
outer cylinders are several gallons of
water. By revolving the inner cylin
der with great rapidity, an intense heat
is generated, and th. water is raised to
a boiling point. The steam passes out.
and into a radiator of ordinary type of
manufacture. The steam becomes
superheated, and the heat is tremend-
ous. That s an there is to tne inven
tion. "I don't understand the reasons for
all this." isaid Mr. Baker today. "All
an tnis, sam r. ir uj.iy. A ure! contended for tb,-t .discrimina
Inow is that I have been ligm'trt "tors rates. shWUt.WwHucf.and' u.
1nfrtnlo,)J)eat tOT 2,3 5'eart.er the anntril report of the- company
rn enn onri a vsi r fnr e-rpasp to nre-
Vent heat by friction. Why shouldn't
we save some of that heat? Why let
Mi go to waste? I have studied me
chanics considerably, but neither I rror
anyone else can explain this invention
which I have hit upon for generating
heat. All I know is that it works. The
wooden pieces play against a cushion
of air. There ia no rubbing -on..-t hje
metal. It is the friction of the air
against the metal that heats the water;
But the wood is not heated. I can put
a piece of tissue paper Inside that in
ne 'chamber, and it is not scorched.
The heat all goes outward.
Mr. Baker has interested a number of
Topfka people in the invention. His
brother has had one of the machines on
exhibition in a building on East Seventh
street for some weeks, but Mr. Baker him
self only arrived In town a few days ago.
C. E. Hawley said today: "It is a won
derful invention. I don't understand it.
but it seams to do what Baker says it
will do."
John Purcell. F. C. Fox and a large num
ber of other leading Santa Fe officials
have Inspected the Invention, and whlla
they don't understand it, they have given
Baker a chance to show what the heater
will do in actual work. The he"-ter use 1
on the car is placfd under the floor, and
is operated from the axle of the car. It
costs nothing to operate it. The .machine
is merely a cylinder 38 inches long and 12
inches in diameter. - -
For heating houses Mr. Baker has a
small machine about a foot long which
can be placed in the cellar to operate a
system for the whole house. Th ma
chines are manufactured by the Garvev
Machine oompanv of St. JTiSeph. St.
Joseph is Mr. Baker's home.
Baker claims to have all the financial
backing he needs. He 's not trying to
sell stock but is simply demons; S vting fo
railroad officials and others the possibili
ties fo his invention. -
The most freakish thing rrhout Baker
and his Invention is that he tries to prove
that it Is founded on Biblical principles,
the same principles that protected the He
brew children in the burning fiery furnace.

iVE TBUtilP CARD
City Said to Have Discovered a
Mysterious Something.
Seems to He in the Nature of a
Stuffed Club.
FOR THE EDISON CO,
Claimed That Company Will
Yield in Its Demands.
Contents of the Surprise Pack
age Are Kept Secret.
A big surprise is being prepared for
the Topeka Ediscn company if the de
velopments continue to shape them
selves as they have in the past.
The surprise may be sprung in the
course of a few days and when it does
it will have a close connection -vith the
pending application of that company
for a new franchise.
Simply hints as to the nature of the
surprise are thrown out and the de
tails are being carefully covered. It
is stated, however, that when the sur
prise box is opened it- will have a ten
dency to disabuse the minds of mem
bers of the council who have had a
leaning towards the Etiisoii.. company,
and have felt that the - company has
been greatly abused and browbeaten.
Claims which have beeri held out by
officers of the company and maintain
ed so earnestly to the council that the
statements were believed, will be re
futed, it is said, by findings- secured by
eouncilmeii who have taken the . painb
to investigate these claims more fully.
What these claims are and the re
futation of them cannot be treated in
nioie specific terms, say those back of
them. The whole transaction has to be
clouded in generalities because the time
is not ripe for disclosure. Bufflee to say
councilmen claim they have a trump
card up their sleeve and. will play it.
When it is played the Edison company
will pay for a portion of the Sixth av
enue viaduct repairs, 'whether the new
franchise asked for iS granted or not.
The proportion that the Edison com
pany and the street railway will pay t
is stated, will be considerable of a pro
portion of the entire cost of repairs.
Members of the ways and means
committee deny that there is any likeli
hood of the recommendation of the
pending franchise to the council for
passaaro at the meeting of the com
mittee Monday evening. Certain de
sired amendments contained in the
franchise :incl asked for by the Edison
compaijy may and will probably pass
j the inspection of the committee but
j members of the committee state that
there is nothing further from therr
minds than the recommendation for
the passage of the entire franchise as
it stands this takes in the main feat-

SLOW AND LISTLESS.
Little Interest Shown by Riders 01
Spectators in Cycle Kuce. : "
New York, Dec. 15. There was no
change during the night in the posi
tion of the riders in the bicycle lace
at Madison Square Garden. The
men
did their work mechanically seeming
for the most part K be content with
holding their place in. the race. A few
sprints were attempted' but they did
not last long and Were without result.
The sixth and last day of bicycle racfts
heretofoie held have seen little or no
change in position and "the spiritless
grind that was going pn. 'today, seemed
to indicate that precedent would be
followed in this race. The men were
averaging about la miles an hour early
today and all seemed, content to fol
low this pace. The lack of maintained
speed in the race and the unusual de
lays that have occurred are indicated
by the fact that the riders were nearly
400 miles behind the record early today.
Ten teams remain in the race and
all will probably finish. Vanderstuyft
and Stol End Galvin and Wiley dropped
out of the contest late last night. Both

Multimillionaire Brewer Favors
an Income Tax.
A JHan With Money Should Be

THE STINGY KICII MEN
Prevent the Government From
Obtaining: Its Rights.
Characterizes Their Action as
Silly and Shortsighted.
St. Louis, Mo., Dec. 15. Adolphus
Busch, the multimillionaire brewer,
says that he is in favor of an income
tax law. Discussing that part of Presi
dent Roosevelt's message referring to
an income tax, Mr. Busch said:
"If there were not so many stingy
ich men in. the United States every
man with a decent income would be
paying his fair proportion of govern
ment taxes.
"A man with money is so fortunate
that I believe he should be respectably
liberal. I have "always wondered why
it is that those of us who have so much
of this world's goods still want to get
more and more .still, and never share
our prosperity with others.
"Now, I don't want to decry men for
accumulating money. That's what I
call thrift. We can't have too much of
it in this country. But this thing of
the wealthy man objecting every time
(he government wants to impose a tax
that may affect his Income is silly and
shortsighted."
SETTLEMENT NOT FINAL
Genertil Coleman .Says That Grimes'
Shortage Can Be Farther Investigated.
C. C. Coleman, the attorney general,
says that the adjustment of the differ
ences between the state and Frank
Grimes, the ex-state treasurer, was not
a final settlement of the case. He said
that the case could be reopened by the
next attorney general or by the legisla
ture. "Mr. Grimes," said the attorney gen
eral, "merely paid into the treasury
the money which I believed to be due
the state as a result of the investiga
tion. He paid ail that I believed could
be collected from him, but I did not
attempt to assume the authority to re
lease him from further obligation when
he paid what I demanded into the
treasury. There was been no compro

STATE'S BRIEF FILED.
Contends That International Han-ester
. Suit Should Not Be Quashed.
C. C. Coleman, the attorney general,
and Fred S. Jackson, his assistant,
have filed a brief in the district court
of Shawnee county opposing the mo
tion which is pending befoTe Judge
Dana there for a quashing of the crim
inal proceedings the state brought
against the International Harvester
company of America for a violation of
the anti-trust laws of the state. This
proceeding has as its ultimate object
the fining of this corporation for its
disregard for the law3 of Kansas.
In their brief opposing the motion of
the Harvester company to annul the
proceedings, the state's legal repre
sentatives say, among other things:
lne defendant says no provision to
notify, the - corporation informed
against or to compel its attendance has
been made by statute. The law pro
vides where no rirovision has been
made, the common law must be fol
lowed. The common law method has
been strictly pursued in thi3 case. This
ought to end the controversy. But the
defendant says that this method of
summoning a corporation to court
must bo illegal because our statute
provides, that in all trials where the
offense charged is a misdemeanor, the
defendant must be present either in
person or by counsel, and that there
fore the court is powerless in this case
to render a default Judgment. But is
there not time, enough to cross this
bridge when we reach it? It has no
bearing upon the question raised by
this motion. This motion is a special
appearance to test the validity of the
initial process in the suit. The court
has no right. to presume that no coun
sel reprGsonting the defendant will be
present when the case comes to trial.
Eminent counsel for. the defendant
have attended and watched every step
in the proceedings so far, and even to
the preliminary investigation preced
ing the commencement of the suit. By
what token must the court now as
sume that these valiant defenders are
so suddenly about 'to give up the
ship?' Why if they had the courage
of their seeming convictions, did they
come into the suit at all? If the ser
vice is wholly without authority of
law, it is void and a judgment ren
dered thereon could do them or their
client no possible harm. Is their- ap
pearance merely ex grata or is it for
the purpose of securing the state from
another mistake of this sort?
"But are counsel ri-ht in this con
tention that no trial can be had in the
absence of -the-.defend.ant or his coun
sel? The authorities "cited in the oral
argument show conclusively that judg
ment may be rendered bv default in
such cases, at common law. The only '
answer presented to these authorities
by the defendant is that the sratute
referred to directly and positively for- i
bids a default Judgment.
"But the statute is only declaratory
of the common law- rule on this sub- !
jert. It takes nothing away from and
adds nothing to the common law o?
the law as it existed at the time of the j
adoption of the constitution and the '
admission of the state into the Union.' I
ine constitution requires only that the
defendant be allowed to appear and
defend in person or by counsel."
CftN GOTO HIGH SCHOOL
Japanese Are Barred Only in the Low
er Grades.
San Francisco, Cal., Dec. 15. "Jap
anese children who have passed the
grammar grades have not been and
will not be barred from the high
schools."
This statement was made by Presi.
dent Altmann of the board of educa
tion, yesterday. Accordingly, if any
Japanese sees fit to pursue the higher
education insofar as the public schools
of the city can make a pathway for
him there will be no bar after he
passes through the Oriental school. It
is only in the grammar and prlmarj
grades that any objection is made to
the presence of Japanese and the chief
objection in those grades is to grown
men.
"The board of "education will stand
pat in the position taken," said Mr.
Altmann, fpeaking for the board of
education. "We have proceeded ac
cording to law and it is the move of
the United States., It .is up to Attorney
General Mcody," said United States
District Attorney Devlin. "I have tele
graphed the agreed statement of facts
to him and today have written a letter
explanatory of that end and of the
conditions here. I am ready to move
when ordered."

They absolutely refuse to give out ar.v
of the details bearing on the call for
troops, or the reason why the govern
ment feels that the soldiers of tho
United States army are needed in th
islands which are at this time overrun
by the little brown men.
It is understood that the mikado was
extremely anxious to secure possession
of the Island of Lanai, which is pfivato
property. This island is 50 miles from
Honolulu and could be used as an ex
cellent naval base against the United
States by any foreign power. It ha
two splendid harbors of sufficient
depth to accommodate a large rieet of
war vessels. , .
Last night Attorney George D. Gear
secured an injunction against Governor

to prevent their selling the island to a,

syndicate represents the Japanese gov

COURT PARTIAL TWO.
Penrose and Maoklin to Be Tried for
Brownsville Affair.
Washington, Dec. 15. Two officers
will be court martialed as a result of
the Brownsville "-ttrts, phich led to tho
dismissal of three companies of the
Twenty-fifth infantry. ; Major Charles
W. Penrose and Captain Edgar A.
Macklin must answer the charge that
they failed to perform their full duty
the night of August 13. Charges and
specifications against these officers are
now being prepared" -at the war depart
ment by direction "Of the president.'
The court martial proceedings will
be started within the next week. Major
fenroce was m command of the bat
talion of the Twenty-fifth infantry on
the nis;ht of the riots. Since the dis
charge of the negro soldiers protests
have reached the White House and tha
war department from all sections of
the country. There has also been an
urgent demand for th? court martial
of the officers in command at Fort
Brown, who, it has been charged,
failed to perform their duty in main
taining discipline. It is aiso charged
that they should have discovered tha
guilty Fo'diers.
It appears that the rifles of the men
were not examined until the morning
after the riots, when they were all
found to be perfectly clean. The of
ficers raised the excuse that when thev
heard the firing it was their belief that
the fort was being attacked by . the
citizens of Brownsville. As a result,
they explained, they did not take Im
mediate precautions to ascertain if
any of the negro soldiers were absenf.
Captain Macklin, who will be tried
with Major Penrose, was in command
of company C and was the officer of
the day.
