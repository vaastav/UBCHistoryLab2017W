The oiiustm ! Hie Krii ssou battery fur-uifht-s
a cliaracieribti'' iuslituee of American en
ergy and dispatt-h. The contract for the woik
was signed on the rfh of ctoler last ; the work
it !f was commenced on the 20th of the same
tuouth ; and there is now no doubt that the bat
tery will be finished on or before the l.rth of Jan
MR, ltiv.', wi'hin the specified period. About
10t0 skillful tnecJiitiics art- empleycd on various
portions of the structure and its equipments,
laboi is pn-Su-d both nighl itucj ilay.
The central part of tiie huli and deck is nearly
completed, at the Continental iron works, Greeu
po::it. The principal engines and boilers and
screws ate in an advanced sta;e, at the lMama
ter iron works, foot of Thirteenth stre t. N. R
The Novelty works are rapidly giving shape to
the dcKth-dealiug turret Messrs. Club' Broth
ers, of Sthenectady. will uot be behind with
the turret engines and gnu-can iages. Three
li:-c rolling mills iu this city are employing all
their available forje in the production of iron
plates.
Captain Ericsson invests his undertaking with
no mystery The public are free to know all
about the plan, the dimensions, the armament,
mid the most minute peculiarities of his unique
iuvrution. The billowing description may cvu
vey some idea of it :
The battery rests upon two vessels, an upper
one and a iower one. The upper is built of iroD,
one hundred and sevcnty-toUT feet long, forty
one feet four inches wide, and rive teet deep, with
a draught of three to six inches, leaving only
eighteeu inches of the sides exposed above the
Wht -r lice. Th-sides are covered with a white
oai bulwark, thirty inches thick, hut receive
their principal protection from an a.mor of
rolled plate iron, six inches thick The deck is
male of oak beams, ten inches thick, covered
with plank eight inches thick and a one-inch
iron piate. The upper v-.vt- ! is Mjt-bottoined.
and has a wedge-shaped s.cm and stern, l'he
lower v. ssel, whih is entirely submerg.-d, is
one Luudred and twenty four In t long, thirty
four feet wide, and six teet six Lrches deep. It
contains the working macLiuery. the rudder and
i he anchor, housed away beyond reach of the
enemy's shot. Upon the deck of the upper
es :, and the only conspicuous object on this
" low raking," and terrible craft, is the turret,
twenty feet in diameter, nine feet high, and com
posed 'of nine one-inch irou plates, lapped over
each oilier and fastened with thousands of bolts.
A shell-proof roof, six inches thick, covers the
tdJTet, which is entered through hatchways from
above. The total weight of the tunc! is one
liundred and twenty tuns.
The armament consists of two columbiad,
which are preferable to rifle guns at short
ranges) each carrying a ball of one hundred
jjj I eighty pounds, and working through circu
lar port holes three feet above the deck. The
carnages are made of wrought irou. and move
on tatged iron slides. The urret can ! turned
" at pleasure by a spurwheel and gearing driven
by a double-cylinder engine, and controlled by
a lever iu tiie'tnrret. By thi contrivance the
gacs can 1 aimed, almost instantly, at any
; 'jint of the Imriinii The rylindi rs for the
ina'n engine are forty inches in diameter, with a
piston stroke of twenty two inches. HmMH
tor the boiler and for ventilation are worked by
smell separate engines. The smoke is passed
tin' through gratings in the deck. The entire
cost of the battery will be VT.",000. Guns and
men to work them will be furnished by the
government.
Among the requirements of the contract is
one thut the battery sliall have a speed of not
less than eight milts an hour. Captain Ericsson
believes that this rate is easily attainable. There
i- m.t " remaika'jle " provision, that the bat
tery shall be tested at the shortest ranges before
the enemy's guns. The inventor is not the bast
aiaruird a! this prospective ordeal. It the uine
iuch platings on the turret (she only exposed
part) do not prove strong enough, three more
inch plates can be put on without materially
arTecting the draught or the salcty of the battery
I'.ut it is believed nine inches will be a sufficient
thickness. The best practicable thickness can
tmly be ascertained by actual experiment. TLat
i'nv and a half inches (the thickness of plates
on ihe La (rlorre and Warrior) are not enough,
was aouala.- torily proved by Captain Ericsson,
:n experiua-ir. (.!:!:. te.1 ly him many years
aT0-
"Tbe test to wkUk lite battery will be subjected,
w i.l probably sx-tt'e ail that is unknown about
the resisting power of iron plates. Immediately
upon the completion of the IrtUtery, it will be
taken to a position it front of some ot the ene
my's accessible batteries the most formidable
preferred and ill pitch in " at rallies -from
liwt' to JO" yards, and as much lees than that
as will be necessary 10 silence the rebel guns.
Khonld it not prove potent enough at the tirt
iial about which no apprehension need be
the additional plates can be attached iu a
verv short time, and the success of the battery,
iu the clc.l eugageu.euts and under the heaviest
tire, be pla,loe'eiid any reasonable doubt.
The practical results of this bold and original
invention wi'l be Vvkni lor with great interest
by military and scu .itiftc men in this country
and Europe.

The Kew York Trilmnt's correspondence from
lieaufort is to December "si, and what has been
done since Dupott gave over the work to Sher
man and his land force is summed up as fol
lows :
Reconnoissanct s of all the islands this side of
Pert Koyal harbor, and of the wmJm laud from
,Sa wuah river up to Branfort have been care
fully made. The damages to the captured forts
liave ben repaired, and both put in perfect con
dition for defense against any possible attack.
Hilton Head Island, about twelve miles try
seven, is wholly in miliury occupation, strong
nSketa oceuDvin all imnonaut points, and
Jlraddock's Point, at its extreme end. where
guns were pointed to prevent the landiDg of our
troops, is perinanen ly held. Intrenchmenls
strengthen the positions and encampmtnU ot
the whole of our force, not completed, but
already extensive. Immense quantities of stores
of every description have been lauded f;orn the
transports, in lire most difficult circumstances,
within adequate means and only by incredible
lei.-''! Not less than fifteen hundred soldiers
have been woiking day and night, much of the
time in the water, aud without any but the
simple! help for lifting aud transporting heavy
weights. Everything has been brought on shore
in small boats, the beach shelving gradually,
and. until tfc'1 wL:,r: it finished, no launches or
lighters beii.g able to approach within a con
siderable distance.
The wharf is well advanced in construction.
built of htuzc nine lots, cut three to four miles
away, partly dragged and partly floated Jowu4o
ttie beach. A grea quantity 01 lumoer 101 oiuei
nurnnses has been trot in the same way. That
of which the storehouses were built, was brought
in the transports. Of the storehouses, two are
M by M feet each, two others each J25 feet by
the same width. The stable is MO fret long and
3$ feet w ide, and about as much more is to be
added. The h- avy labor imjiosed upon the
jjoldiers by the refusal of the Va!lepartmeut to
far-nisb laborers, and th large force required for
the pickets, has interfered to some extent with
drill tuid the regular routine of camp lite, yet a
great deal has been done to improve the soldierly
condition of the dii ision. Five to eight hours a
day I am assured has been regularly devoted to
drill, battalion and brigade movements, aud other
instruction lor the xigencies of special service.
The picket duty may be divided into two classes
the inlyiDg. teat which is immediately about
the brigades ; the outlying, much heavieand
harder, ail over the island, holding roads and
ferries and other important points.
Add to this summary the expeditions in all
directions, naval and m.litary, the occupation ol
Tybee IglanFat Savannah and the possession ot
St. Helena Sound to the north, twenty-five miles
nearer Charleston than this harbaT, both having
f ir'tieations which have been abandoned by the
ebels, and I bebe some geneiai notion may
ibe formed of the w ork accomplished up to the
jpesx-nt date.

anJ spirit. I e-, pn.ot say much about. The sick

much of which might have been done iy con
tiabands, u 'he general commanding had chosen
to avail hinu'tflf of their services to a greater ex
tent. Some of the regiments are much better
off than others : snd it is plain that their condi
tion when 1 avk'g home has very much to d
v. tb their present state. The Ix-st armed and
officered regiment iic-re lias had perhaps tlie very
hnrdest work to do, and still has not suffered so
nuch as others. The knse ot feeling remains us
't was, and carries them through e erythiug.
The contraband ouestum is not less interesting
in its features than important in its relation to
the expedition and the whole war. Eact are
tm lumerous that the dirliculty is to select from
the mass of materials those which are most im
portant. I can only repeat, to-day, a few of the
btateux nts. which come to me from the best of
authority, Observing i:i the first place that there
are not more than three hundred iu camp at pres
ent. Their feeling of hostility to their late mas
ters and gratitude to us is uumistakable and
universal, and their readiness to work is shown
in every way. The policy of Ctu. Sherman, or
whoever is r sponsible for his remarkable proc
lamation, I cannot pretend to fathom, nor am I
able to see w hy their sei vices should not relieve
the overworked soldiers from some of the heav
iest tasks imposed upon them. The slaves come
jsiowly into camp tor several reasons. Iheinvi

SIR : In the skirmish which occurred yesterday
betweeu the V. S. forces under my command,
aud your brigade, I regret to be obliged to intorm
vou that Col. St. George Croghan, commanding
your cavalry regiment, as he stated to me, was
mortally wounded. He was shot through the
right wrist and side, and the upper portion ot the
abdomen, the ball passing entirely i rough the
body, aud lived from fl A. M , when he was
wounded, till P.
I saw him iu passing, a lew minutes after he
was wouuded, and he recognized me, conversing
freely but with pain, aud sliaking my hand on
leaving him, lie requested me to state that he
'died the death of a brave soldier " as he did,
iu every way worthy of his gallant and noble
father.
I left him in charge of my brigade and one
other surgeon, with hospital attendants and a
guard, and on mv return this morning from my
camp ground, the hospital steward handed me a
small blank memorandum book, in which was a
history made bv his request, of which I luclose
you a copy. He left his address, etc., with the
chaplain of the. Tenth (Col. Lytle's) Ohio regi
ment. Kev. H. E. O. Higgins, and told me that
his family were residing iu X. wburg New i ork.
I will endeavor to cominuuicate MB them as
early as possible, and send each little memorial
from him as 1 shall be able to collect them, for I
yet cannot ascertain whtre most of his property
Las gone, as the people of the house where he
died would not attend to it. 1 liHve sent his re
jiaius toward Eayetteviih-, where they will be iu
i. it we are not able to take them to Cauley,
tnougii I will, if possible, place the bdy therein
a box with salt, to preserve it for his friends. It
will be subject to the order of Geu. W. S. Kosen-
cranr. ... .
And now, having for the third time the oppor
tunity of extending courtesies somewhat M this
character to your officers at first, in returning
the baggage, uniform, etc., of Colonel Porterfield,
at Phillippi, and afterward, of preserving the
sword, effects, aud body of General Garnet at
Carriek's ford 1 trust j our officers will appre
ciate the desire thus exhibited of mitigating m
mn way the horrors of this fratricidal strife, as
I think you yourself will dome the justice to be
lieve that I most earnestly wish it.
I send this by a private citiz -u. as I thought
you would prefer it to a flag of truce, and on ac
count of the uncertainty of the means dj not
send forward any of the little memorials pre
served. Verv respectfully, your obd't serv t,

The Quarter !eleclel for '! and Mi
dell in BeUl.
The New York Herald's llostou correspondent
writes :
The quarters selected for the use of the rebel
commissioners are precisely the same as tjiose
occupied by the other political prisoners. This
room is a few doors from Coi. Dunmick's head
quarters, in the same row, or rather under the
same roof. The building is of beautiful New
Hampshire granite, the roof forming the treplaiu
af the work It has but one story above ground,
which is divided into sev-ral fiue and airy apart
ments. The basement contains all the neces
saries for culinary operations, with quarters for
servants, etc The largest rooms are about six
teen feet square, with high ceilings, aud lighted
by two large w indows. A marble mantel adorns
the room, and a large grate furnishes the con
venience for a good fire. The furniture of the
room consists of a plain pine table, a few camp
stools, the baggage of the occupants and a low
wooden bedstead. A good straw mattress, M ith
piilows of the same material, and heavy army
blankets, make up the furniture of the room.
To s..v the i'-ast, the ijuarters are moafc bett-r
than liiey dese ve. As to living, they can mess
w ith their friends IU the rate of one dollar per
diem, having ail the staple OMBforts ot tiie mar
ket ou the table.
If they are given to the us.- ot the weed, they
. . . . . . , - - ,, i
can ni'lulge tnat taste, lor smoaing w auoweu,
but liquors a.e prohibit, d. In fai t, almost every
thing but liberty is granted to them.
Ow:u to the decision ot toe government iu
relation to the usage of political prisoners, I think
that some of those enjoyments wiil be curtailed
u:it.i we can learn ttiat tzie gallant vorcoran ami
others are treated better thau they have been.
The PiraU- Miuilh uml Cel. Corcoran.
The Philadelphia Laitr says :
Wihiam Smith, who wa convicted of piracy.
at the last term of the I niled States Circuit
Court, occupies a cell along with his companiou
Kocktnrd. ou the second corridor in the" untried
depart meiit. and is in all respects treated as the
other prisoners in tlie sine department, ins
cell, like the others, is furnished wit a bed and
bedstead, table and stools, aud is well lighted
and ventilated. He.is allowed to see any of his
triendi, and can receive auy articles from them
but such as tlie rules of the prison prohibit and
as to his fare, tlie government provides ample for
that, the amounts allowed for the subsistence of
each United States prisoner being forty-three
cents per day. If Col. Corcorau, who, accor
ding to the acting Secretary of War of the Con
federate States, is to be confined in a cell appro
propriated to convict felons, and to be treated iu
all respects as if such convict, and to be held for
execution in the same manner as Smith, the pi
rate, now in Moyamensing, under conviction,
only receives nan as good treatment as miui is j
now receivmg, he will have no cause to com
plain. Deem sentence is passed, prisoners are
never treated as felons here. They remain ou
toe untried side of the prison until the judgment
of the court is pronounced. Smith has not been
sentenced nor is it probable that he will soon bo.
The trials of the other prisoners have been post
poned until the next term of the circuit court,
and it is not likely that he will be sentenced be
fore that time.
An Abelilieaiat Hrpndinlrd.
The lutun Utmorrct, published at Dayton,
Ohio, a paper which warmly advocated the Union
movement at the last election, flying the Todd
ticket at the head of its columns, says, in discuss
ing the I n i -n State Senator question:
The Cincinnati Emptirtr is right in its re
marks. The I'uion Democrats made no bargain
with Men. Wade. They don't owe lien. Wade
anything. They regard Wade as a pestiferous
politician. In Congress he w as against compro
mise, aud has always been a bitter opponent of
Democratic men and measures. We take it
too, that the old Whigs are not under any obli
gations to Wade. He once declared that " the
Whig party is not only dead, but stiuketh " He
helped to break up the Whig party. Conserva
tive rueu of ail parties are not apt to look on
Wad--! with favor.
It ought not to astonish any man, t' erefore, if
the I 'uion conservative men of Ohio should de
sire the election of some one representing their
views. They certainly are uot in favor of one
who, in part, is responsible, by reas 'U of his ex
treme views aud course as a politician, for the
trouble uow afflicting the country. They are not
in favor of oue who thinks the Chicago platform
worth a civil war. They are not iu favor of oue
who put party before country. The country
can get along without lieu. Wade. ho ought

the valleys of the Miami will cry out for joy.

While the columus were passing in review an
officer rode up to (Jen. McDowell, the senior offi

were being freely sold by a perso-i from his car
riage on the ground, against all orders. The
general authorized the officer to have the offender
arrested. The officer complaining took a squad
of men w ith him, aud started in pursuit of the
alleged vender of intoxicating drinks, and soon
hatted in trout ol a carriage containing a basket
of champagne, the contents of which were being
Ii. . ly dispensed by the proprietor thereof. The
officer made inquiry as to the name of the owner,
anil w as iuformed that the proprietor of the team
and champagne was Russell. "What Russell ;"
asked the officer. "Kussell of the Loudon

quired the officer, pointing to the champagne

away, finding out very soon after that it was
another person who was violating orders by sell

cordingly arrested and placed in the guard house.
President Mkis; in the Cabisbt. Two
candidates for the next Presidency are iu the
Cabinet, aud "act" accordingly. Mr. Seward
gives out, to s the German Erement element
for himself, in the coming Presidential election,
"did not consent to Fremont's removal until
llie very last of the Cabinet," and thus opens a
back fire upon Cameron, Chase, Iiiair, and even
upon the President himself, who, at last, upou
his own responsibility, ordered the removal, lor
high cause. Cameron, th other aspirant for the
Presidency, not to be outdone iu tactics, now
becomes extreme anti-slavery from being the
most conservative member of the Cabinet, chat
ters abolition in Springfield, (Massachusetts.)
and indorses it, Mhea, iu John Cochrane's army
swell ' All this is but iutriirue intrieuc when
the very existence of the nation is at stake, which
everylsidv can see through. If Secretary Sew
ard condemns President Lincoln's removal of
i'reinont, and his revocation of Fremont's free
ueero proclamation, it is his duty to leave the
Cabinet. If Secretary Cameron is nut now of
accord iu this and other matters, it is his duty to
retire too. The President, iu this crisis, uoeds
niity in his Cabiio t is entitled to it. Indeed
ii is a calamiiy to his admiuistratiou that he has

Irom the Richmond correspondence of the New

I presume the history of this distinguished of
ficer is familiar to you. It ought to be lamiiiar
to tlie people of the Confederate Slates. It
would show that in this age, as well as in farmer
ages, circumstances develop genius, and that the
pressure of events is enough to stimulate the
lualitios of the hero, even when heroism his
been latent and unsuspected. Gen Price s cam
paign in Mexico was decidedly one of tlie most
brilliant episodes of the war. His conquest M
New Mexico with a slender force of volunteers;
his fertility of resource and extraordinary energy
aud enterprise, displayed iu suppressing the MD
I irrr ' rebellion, and in his remarkable w inter
campaign against the insurgent Indians, deserve
to be recorded as the most shinir.g page ot the
history of the Mexican war. Among the vieto
rie.s gained by Geu. Price in that war were the
l. i:ii.-s of Taos and Rosal-st the hrttef .ought
against a greatly sucrior force, coinmin lod by

has the following, headed "Stirring Scenes :"
SaM the publication of our last we have wit
nessed stirring scenes. We have made a suc
cessful descent upon the enemy's coast, after
encountering one of the most fearful storms that
desolate the deep, followed uy a lamim ianu
ing, after five hours' naval righting against a
wAl-prepared antagonist, who chose his own
position, and had taken all pains aud added all
the appliances of science, to render impregnable
a position by nature ouly too well adapted to

fi.nmie of war forsake the pale standard of re-
bellion, and we have seen the star-spangled Man
ner wave its rainbow hues in the southern sk'.es,
over the soil of dark, deceitful, perjured South
Carolina. We have seen a sight worth living
fan. mid worth dviuir for. We have seen Sumter
avenged.
Concerning the movements of contrabands
we read :
(juite a number of ' contrabands " have come
into camp since the capture of the island, and
they give some ludicrous and etwee terrific ac
counts of the " shelling out " the " navy boys "
gave the Palmetto f-l!ow-s. One of them says :
" De Georgy fellows run lust, den de Soiit Caro
lina bosses run like de debble, and de Dutch
went after dem, and none of deiu eU-r dun come
back ua-in." Another states that he had come
with some sweet a tates foi de olusa bosses,
aud staid till de place got so mixed he could
ardly see his way out ; and on being asked
how it looked when the storm of shells was hail
iu" on the fort and island, he said it looked " jes
like if de fire aud de brimstone war a comiu
lown, and de airth war a gwme up. and we
loii't doubt that it looked "jes so to more than
one poor fellow ou that hot Thursday uoou.
The state of the weather calls toi th the follow
ing comments:
The omuiurespent theme of speculation aud
small talk, the weather, is here lound iu great
abundance, though thus far pretty much ot a
sameness. For the middle of November we are

Inasmuch as we are the only " Ulack K-'puo-

The Montreal (Canada) Adrirtiser of Satur
day hist contains the following :
Colonel Dae Min. an English gentleman ot
wealth and po-itioii, now staying in this ci.y, ie
Oentij applied to Mr. Oiddiugs, the Coiled
S'.ites consul, for a passport to pass through the
United Stated en mutr for H ililax, to visit his
daughter, married to an officer of oue of the reg
bea ts there. Mr. Ci-ldiugs, not content with
refusing a passport, did so in the most offensive
manner, telliug Colonel Dawson that British sub-j-cts
had no right to expert favors from the gov
ernment of the Coi ted Statute, when they giveaid
and sympathy to the Confederates; and liuaiiy
gpniug into a furious eemliem, the consul de
clared if Eugland wanted to fight, that she
might come on, the 1 n o- l State, was leady for
her.
K- ararkitig oa the above, the Cincinnati Lit
quirer says :
Giddings ought to he romOTed from otiiec- at
once for such rude ami unb-coming conduct,
outrage.ins at any time, but specially foolish
considering the dencete state of our foreign rela
i. . -. When Giddings was Sent to Canada, the
reason given was that we should be rid of a mis
chievous agitator, wh ) would be harmless in a
foreign mission, but wotiid lie dangerous if he
remained at home, liut it seems "Old iid" is
as troublesome in the farmer capacity as in the
latter, and even more so. The Canada papers
from which we quote adds :
It is quite evident that Mr. Giddings is insane;
the excitement of recent events has been too
mash for ins mind, aud his trieuds should re
move him to an asylum before he do s himself
some mischief.
We have thought Oildiugs waj insane for
manv years, but it must be confessed these is
"method iu his madness." It is high time that
the administration closed his career iu Canada.

We have Galveston papers to the lth instant.
The firiwa of that date has the fellow iug:
We are left alone la our glory ! Our e.otem
porary of the fleees has sought the delightful
sha les of Houston, w here his paper is to be pub
lished. Yielding t" the apprehension of the peo
ple generally, and believing it a duty, under the
tiftnmstenrra, to place thai portion of our me
lerial which we do not need, beyond the reach
of danger, we shall send a c insidorable quanti
ty to the up-country, retaining only enough to
keep our business iu opera tioei ou a war basis.
Notwithstanding all the stn'et talk about evac
uation, etc , to be heard iu outside circles, aud
which is gravely published, on the alleged au
thority ot a council of war, by the Houston
Ttltgrapk, we believe that should the enemy
come, Geii. Hebert will afford fighting enough
to accommodate the anxious gentlemen who
haaahaan suilin' for a fight for the last ten
years, aud who have retired to the up country in
disgust, because they think he is disponed to dis
turb their favorite pastime of demolishing Lin
coluites. We believe fighting ground will be
plenty ; and if Galveston should he attacked,
und its fate should be to fall before superior
strength and numbers, we expect to flaunt the
last issue of the Cicttitn iu the fa.-e of tins foe,
and if we can't move our type, sack a printing
office and join our old neighbor and the balance
of the rear guard.

An Kxlraonliaaiy Sull Well.
One of the most extraordinary salt wells on
record, perhaps, is that now being operated at
Wellsville, Colnmbiauu county, Ohio. The well
sunk in auticinatiou of finding oil, but when
at a depth of four hundred aud eighty feet, the
borers struck a vein of gas, which burst forth
with such violence as to eject all the toots used
in boring, together with two hundred feet of pipe
which had been previously iutrod .ced. The
boring had developed a very strong vein of salt
water, and the gas continued to spout the whole
... im'n afmmh and fresh water furnished by the
well, to the height of one hundred aud fifty feet,
for six months. The idea of manufacturing salt
arka then conceived, and alter the nec-ssary
nans, tanks, etc., were put up, the work was
'ominenccd. The gas was brought in pipes
from the gasometer aud introduced into the tur
h, var oits lets, which, ueinr nruiaju, v'
form the whole office of eva- oration without any
other fuel. The furnace glows with an intense
heat, and the flames issue trom the lop oi ue
The salt water flow? at th
about six gallons per minute, and there is more
than sufficient Eras to evaporate the whole. It
rUlmi about a barrel of salt per hour. 1 he gas
furnishes a pressure of one hundred and eighty-
six pounds to the square inch, which is eighty or
