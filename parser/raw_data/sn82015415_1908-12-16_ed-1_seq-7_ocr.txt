AT AUSTRIA BY ITALIAN CABI
NET LEADER.
NEW YORK, December 1C The
World answers Roosevelt's message to
Congress, In which the President de-,
nounces the statements of the Pulitzer
newspapers about crooked work on the
Panama canal and threatens libel suits
In a denunciatory leader. The World
defies the President and quotes his
message as an assertion, for the first
time by an American Chief Magistrate,
of the doctrine of lese-majeste. It
says that neither King Edward nor the
Kaiser would arrogate tb himself such
despotic powers. No other living man,
continues the World, has libeled the
United States as Roosevelt has. It
has been his habit to besmirch Con
gress, bulldoze Judges, assail the inte
grity t)f the courts and slander private
citizens.
ROME, December 3. In the Cham
ber of Deputies today Ex-Premlcr
Fortis, who Is now head of the ma
jority in the present Cabinet, delivered
a remarkable address, In which he
openly opposed the recent action of
Austria-Hungary In the Balkans. Italy,
ho said, had not claimed compensa
tlons because the Italian Government
hopes that the day will soon come
when Italy will bo In a position to say
to Austria that she must stop Increas
lng her armaments or that both coun
tries will resume their liberty of ac
tion.
Slgnor Fortis said that Italy feared
war only tnrougii her any s warnue
preparations, and he added that the
whole country is agreed on the neces
;sity of making new sacrifices for ml
jlltnry defense so that peace might be
gained.
I The address was received with en
thusiasm as Indicating Italy's inten
tion of remaining a member of the

WASHINGTON HOSE CART GOING
TO FIRE BARELY MISSES HIS
CARRIAGE.
WASHINGTON, December 3. Presi
dent Roosevelt had a narrow escape
from serious Injury while driving yes- j
tcrday afternoon. Tho prompt action
of Lieutenant J. B. Lyons of the local
Fire Department, who was driving a
heavy fire-hose cart prevented a bad
accident. The fire horse were travel-
lng at a great speed In response to an
alarm when tho driver, realizing that,
he would dash Into tho President's 1
carriage but for some desperate nc-,
tlon, jerked the animals back and
threw them on their haunches.
Their hoofs, it is said, almost struck
tho vehicle In front of them as they
fell. Tho hose wagon was slightly
damaged.
