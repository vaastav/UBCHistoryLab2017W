COMMENTS OF MESSAGE.
Candidate Docker)- Says the President
Omitted Important Points.
Macon, Mo., Dec. 0. -'The presi
dent's message is adroit in what it
did not nay," remarked Congressman
A. M. Dokery to a small erowd in
Itailroad Commissioner MH'ulley's
office this afternoon.
"There is much said about the iu
fariou.s trusts anl monopolies and a
uniformity of state legislation sug
gested to control them, but the great
breeder of trusts, a high protective
tariff and husiin-ss monopolies will
be largely imp issible. With our
great inventive ami productive ener
gy we must have enlarged foreign
trade relations or lalr will remain
idle and our products unsold.
I believe to-day we are upon the
threshold of one of the brightest busi
ness eras of our history, but to reap
the harvest to its fullest extent w
must remove obstructive taxation
increase t he volume of silver money
and remove the taxes from the shoul
ders of the small property owner and
place it upon incomes and lai jre es
tates. I see the president proposes
to rivet the gold standard to tli
mast head and advocates further
grants of power to national banks
In reply to that we will go la-fore the
people advocating u lower tariff; op
position to imperialism, reiterate the
monetary plank of the Chicago con
vent ion a n 1 ilemantl commercial ex
pansion in its fullest am broadest
Bense. The issues area bout made up

unfair advantage and such a charge

for the interests of the party in the

was urged to recall their appoint

reject them, both were confirmed and
given office lerause there were no
court record to prove that they were
guilty of crime.
In speaking of these cases Mr. Rob
