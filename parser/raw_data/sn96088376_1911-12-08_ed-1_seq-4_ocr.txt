CIVIC IMPROVEMENT '
IN STREET LIGHTING.
Ornamental Globes and Pelts Are Big
Factor In Beutifioation,
Since man must of necessity spend
considerable portion of his time un
der mime sort of artificial Hunt out of
doon It would seem appropriate that
something ho siild here concerning
ilvlc Improveuient lu street lighting.
We are sometimes prone to rvslgu
ourselves to our present eoudltloa with
no thought as to what we niliiht ac
complish alone certain lines It we
merely received the Impetus. This
state of affairs Is only too manifest lu
the street lighting equipment of the
average city. As a rule the citliens of
even a large city are satisfied with a
poorly arranged system of glaring,
sputtering arc lamps lu the business

poles In the residential districts. 8uch
systems or others which are oo bet
ter hnve been in general use so long
that many people have assumed that
nothing better Is used sny where or can
even be attained. Nothing is more er
roneous thun this Idea.
There Is now a street lighting sys
tem in use In many cities of the coun
try which Is attracting widespread fa
vorable comment This modern form
of street lighting Is known undt-.r sev
eral names, but poeslbly the most com
mon Is "ornamental street lighting."
In this system ornamental cast Iron or
concrete posts, surmounted by tung
sten lamps with Inclosing glass ball
globes, are placed at short Intervals
along both sides of the street. Such
posts when properly selected and
placed mid equipped with suitable
lumps and globes will furnish a street
light which Is exceedingly efficient both
In illumination results and In appear
ance. The decorative value of the orna
mental system Is one of Its most Im
portant features. One who has never
seen a city street bounded on each side
by a long row of ornamental posts,
each surmounted by several clear
white ball globes, such as those known
as "alba," can scarcely realize the
decorative effect produced. The re
sult Is not to be compared with that
produced by the old fashioned gas
lamps, the so called "beautiful" arch
system of Incandescent lamps, or the
Inartistic arc lamp. .
The daylight appearance of any street
lighting system should also be con
sidered. A well designed post when
carefully set and equipped with alba
ball globes Is a thing of beauty by
any as well as by night Its appear
ance Is Infinitely better than that of a
blackened wooden pole supporting a
mnze of wires and an ngly arc lamp.
The Illuminating result produced by
any street lighting system Is of prime
Importance and Is certainly a matter
for the consideration of any one who Is
interested In civic Improvement. In
this respect the ornamental system Is
unexcelled. By employing the proper
spacing of posts nod the proper size
of lamps and observing a few other
contributing factors the Illuminating
results obtained from such n system
will be eminently satisfactory. The
illumination will be amply sufficient,
well distributed, comfortable to the
eye. cheap to produce and at the same
time ornamental.
Asphalt and Wood Laid Parallel.
Running parallel with each other

62ND SESSION OF
CONGRESSGONVENES
Regular Session Opened Mon
day With Prospects of Pro
tracted Meeting.
Washington The first regular ses
sion ot the Blxty second Congress
Opened Monday. Having perfected us
organisation when it met In extraor
dinary session lust spring, Congress
waa ready to begin work.
Investigate Anti-Trust Lesgut.
An investigation of the operation ot
the so-called AntlTrUst League was
demanded by Republican Leader Mann
In the House at the opening session,
after a remarkable speech by Repre
sentative Martin W. Littleton, ot New
York, who charged Henry II. Martin,
secretsry of the league, with attempt
ing to defame him. Mr. Littleton as
sailed Martin and others as In con
spiracy to use the Steel invest gating
committee to depress the value of
stocks In Wull Street ,
President Upholds Sherman Law.
President Taft in his message stat
ed that, owing to the number of Im
portant subjects calling for comment,
It was Impossible to Include a discus
sion of them In one message ot rea
sonable length and, therefore, he
would transmit a series of messages
between the opening of Congress and
the adjournment fur the Christmas
holidays. 1
His first message dealt with anti
trust legislation. The President stated
that he was strongly opposed to the
repeal or amendment of the Sherman
law, and suggested that the law
should be strengthened by supplemcn
tal legislation. He Urged the enact
ment of some sort of federal Incorpor
ation act and the creation of a federal
corporation commission.
Must Do Over Extra Session Work.
Much ot the work ot the extra ses
sion which President Taft called In
order to pass the Canadian reciprocity
agreement, must be done over again.
The President vetoed the tariff revi
sion bills passed by the Democrats
and the Republican Insurgents, and
both factions are armed for the tray
once more.
The Democrats have a good work
ing majority in the House, and the
Important bills on their program will
be passed quicsiy.
Tariff and constructive corporation
legislation are the two items of gen
oral Interest standing out from the
rest in the line of serious business.
As soon as President Taft sends In his
tariff message, following the report
made to him by the tariff board, the
Democrats of the ways and means
committee will shape their program.
It is practically assured that whatever
the ways and means committee puts
forward, whether wholly en rapport
with the tariff board findings or not,
will pass the House.
Many Tariff Bills Coming.
The probability Is that there will
be a series ot measures revising vari
ous schedules In conformity with the
plan followed last summer. The real
tariff fight will follow In the Senate
with the result uncertain now and
with the Impending complications
wearying to contemplate In view of
the balance of power held by the In
surgents and the lack of harmony in
the ranks of the Senate Democrats
The corporation legislative prob
lem la even more vexing than that
pertaining to the tariff. The rresl-
dent and his friends are hopeful that
non partisan public sentiment will
force the parties to co-operate and
place a federal corporation' law on
the statute books.
Panama Canal Legislation.
The coming session Is expected to
develop the first legislation for the
operation, maintenance and govern
ment of the Panama canal and the
canal zone. Everything that Congress
has done In the past regarding the
great artificial waterway has been dl
rected toward construction. The
question of tolls tor use of the canal
and ' its permanent fortification are
two of the big subjects that it Is ex
pected will be embodied In legislation
Introduced during the session. It Is
not believed, however, that much leg
islation will be passed on the future
of the canal, It being attempted large'
ly as a formative precaution to test
the sentiment toward the different
plans suggested. 1
Will Do Little Before Holidays.
But little constructive legislation Is
expected before the Christmas holt
days. After the reading of the Presi
dent's annual message both houses
settled down to the introduction of
bills and preliminary skirmishing In
advance of the real' battle that will
begin after the Chiistmas recess.
The House Democrats will then
plunge at once Into the consideration
of the tariff revision bills and the an
nual appropriation measures. The re
port of the tariff board on the whole
schedule "will be submitted shortly
after Congress convenes.
COOKED FOOD FOR STOCK.
Undtr tome CiroumsUnssa It Pays a
Take ths Trouble.
There are perhaps few questions of
lock management In regard to whl n
there Is a greater difference of opinion
than oa that of whether It la worth
while to cook food for stock. There
art those who maintain with great
poaltlveneM that It la. There are oth
ers who, writing from the scientific
side mainly, object that cooking adds
nothing to the dlgeetlblllly or the
nourishing character of the food and
that the cost aud labor ot rooking are
thrown away or at best meet with
but a sninll return In the opportunity
afforded of smuggling Into the stomach
of the animal food which It would oth
erwise reject and which cannot, (here-
fore, be of much feeding value.
The feeder who liaa a good supply
of steam on the farm will frequently
have found It most convenient aud
will hnve satisfied himself on many
occasions that he has been able to
provide palatable rations for his stock
which would otherwise have been un
satisfied had not the convenience for
cooking been nt hand. How far this
has been a gain must of course, de
pend on circumstance. It might have
paid him better to te better supplied
with cakes and roots and other foods.
Hut a man must cut his coat accord
ing to his cloth, and there la generally
on every farm at some time or other
a scarcity of good foods and a variety
of fodder which cannot be classified as
first rate, but which has to be made
the best of, aud If cooking will make
It possible nt small coot to use It It
would seem to be a mistake to refrain
from cooking.
At any rate. It will hardly be dis
puted that food may profitably be
cooked for pigs. The pig I an animal

but as far as possible gets Into It, and
nigs kept together will be noticed In
cold weather huddled up as closely as
possible for warmth's sake.
We contend that particularly in se
vere weather. It Is not a matter of no
ImiHirtnnce whether the sloppy food
given the anluml be comfortably warm
or Icy cold. If the food Is cold It has
to be raised to the temperature or tne
body, and some of the food has to be
used for this purpose. This Is a loss
that would be avoided If the food were
warmed. Moreover, the pig Is chilled.
Its comfort Is Impaired, and the fat
tening process Is retarded, so that there
Is a double loss. It limy be questioned
whether the same rule will hold good
with cattle generally, but the dairy
cows might very well hnve some of
the mashes warm. In the end It re
solves Itself Into a question of ex
pense. If steam Is already available
