NEW YOPvK, Dec. 15.— The
World in the course of its an
, swer to President Roosevelt's
reference to that paper in his
special message to congress today
says:
"Mr. Roosevelt is mistaken. He
can not muzzle the World.
"While no amount of •billingsgate*
\u25a0on his part can alter our determination
to treat him with judicial impartiality
and scrupulous fairness, we repeat
what we have already said, that the
congress of the United States should
make a thorough investigation of the
whole Panama transaction, that the
full truth may be known to the Ameri
can people.
New Doctrine, Says Paper
"The World appreciates the impor
tunce and significance of Mr. Roose
velt's statement when he declared to
congress that the proprietor of the
"World V:!jould be prosecuted for libel
by the governmental authorities* and
that 'thf. attorney- general has under
i consideration the form under which
the proceedings against Mr. Pulitzer
ehall be l)rought.'
•This is the first time a president
ever asserted the doctrine of lese ma
jeste or proposed, in the, absence of
specific legislation th.c criminal prose
cution by the government of citizens
•u-ho criticised the conduct of the gov
ernment or the conduct of individuals
who may have had dealings with the
grovcrnment. Neither the king of Great
Britain nor the German emperor would
venture to arrogate such power to
himself.
Adams* Course Recalled
"John Adams* attempt to enforce the
sedition law destroyed the federalist
party in America. Yet Roosevelt, in
the absence of law, officially proposes
to use all the power ot the greatest
government on earth to cripple the
freedom of the press on the pretext that
the government itseif has been libeled
— and he is the government.
"It is true that the World printed
the public reports concerning the Pan
ama canal affair, which resulted from
William Xclson Cromwell's appeal to
the district attorney's office during the
recent campaign to prevent the publica
tion of a Etory^ which .was said to be
in the hands of the democratic national
committee.
Cromwell Raised Issue
It was Mr. Cromwell's own action
which raised the issue in the campaign.
It is true also that when Mr. Roose
velt made his attack upon D'clavan
Binith. the World called attention to
certain statements which Mr. Roose
velt must have known to have been
false and misleading, and appealed to
congress to end all scandal by a full
and impartial investigation. If this be
treason, let Mr. Roosevelt make the
most «f it.
"Mr. Roosevelt's lamentable habit of
inaccurate statements makes it impos
sible to accept his judgments or his
conclusions. In his message he does
not state correctly even so simple a
matter as the pretended causes of his
jrricvancc.
President's Word Challenged
"The World has never said j that
Charles P. Taft or Douglas Robinson j
made any .profits whatever. Mr. Taft
denied that he was concerned in, the
transaction in .any way. which denial
the World published and' accepted. It
would have been equally glad to print
Mr. Robinson's denial had it succeeded
in obtaining one from him. as it fre
quently attempted.' The World has no
evidence that he was associated with
Mr. Cromwell and would accept his
word to that effect; for. Mr. Robinson is
an estimable gentleman of high charac
ter, whose reputation for veracity is in
finitely better than that of his distin
guished brother in law.
Roosevelt Called Demagogue
•V? the World has libeled anybody we
hope it will be punished, but we do, not
intend . to be intimidated by Roosevelt's
throats or. by Roosevelt's denunciation
or by. Roosevelt's power.
"No other' living man ever/so grossly
libeled the United States as does this
president, who \u25a0 '.besmirches congress,

. XEW YORK. Dec. 15.— Speaking at
the banquet of the Xational civic, fed
eration tonight President " elect "Wil
liam H. Taft said:
"Time was when everybody. who em
ployed labor was opposed to labor
unions.. Time was when these organic
zations were regarded as a menace.
That time has now largely passed
away- and the man who today objects
to the organization , of labor: should be
relegated to the last -century. • Labor
unions have done niarvels for labor and
in the future will do more.

"Labor unions will, encourage work
ingmen, nat to a level down, but to a
level up, and will-fexcmpllfy that those
who lead in energy will have the leaxU
ership and reward.
"I thank Mr. Gompers for saying that
I am to be his president as -much as
anybody's. In the next .congress .and
the one that succeeds it many questions^
will"arise with reference" to legislation
in assistance of laiaor.r. .\u25a0>;; •"..;
- To .nic \u0084oi\e otrthe'^mostwwipprtant

ity act. In my judgment, one of our
greatest dangers. lies in theidelays in
the administration of justice;" civil and
criminal. \ By a reasonableVemployers'
liability act in both- federal and -state
governments we could remove: from- the
courts nine-tenths of the suits for dam
ages growing out of personal injuries,
and have just awards 1 rendered by
quasi judicial tribunals."
Carnegie's Suggestion .-
Carnegie created a storm of approval
when he declared that he believed the
problem of capital and Jabor would be
solved through a profit sharing plan,
which would make all men laborers and
all men capitalists.
Gompers declared that every man as
sociated with organized labor : hoped
that :Taft's administration would be
pre-eminently successful and would
make every effort to the attainment
of that purpose.
Taft was the last of a brilliant
throng of speakers at the" banquet.

was drowned from the police launch

destroyed beyond the possibility of
recognition the body was iri perfectly

cation of the remains was made easy
by the clothing and personal effects.'
Even before the body had been towed
to the shore the identification had
been made, and a squad of mounted
police was waiting at the Mission

honor by the time the launch sent to

then on its 9:15 o'clock transbay trip.
Even as' the body was sighted it was
whirled off into the foaming wake o£
