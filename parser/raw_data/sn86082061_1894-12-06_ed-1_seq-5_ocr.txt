THE BLUEFIELDS DIFFICULTY.
"Prominent among the questions of
the year was the Blueflelda Incident, in
what is known as the Mosquito Indian
strip, bordering on the Atlantic Ocean,
and within the jurisdiction of Nicar
agua. Ey the treat of 1800 between
Great Britain and Miearagua the for
mer government expressly recognized
the sovereignty of the latter over the
strip, and a limited form of self-government
was guaranteed to the Mos
quito Indians, to be exercised accord
ing to their e-Vstoms, for th-msclves
and other dwellers within their limits.
The so-called native government. which
grew to be largely macHe up of aliens,
for many years disputed the right to
maintuiii therein 'a practically Inde
pendent municipal government.
"Early in the past year efforts of
Nk-aragua to mataln sovereignty over
the Mosquito territory led to serious
disturbances culminating In the sup
pression of the native government and
the attempted substitution of an Im
practicable composite administration,
in which Nicaragua and alien residents
were to participate. Failure was fol
lowed by an insurrection which for a
time subverted Nicaragua!! rule, ex
pelling her officers and restoring the
old organization, This, in turn, gave
place to the existing locul government
established and upheld by Nicaragua.
"Although the alfti interests array
ed against Nle'aragua In these transac
tions have been largely American, and
the commerce of that region for some
time has been largely and still is chief
ly controlled by our citizens, we cannot
for that reason challenge the rightful
sovereignly of Nicaragua over this im
portant part of her domain.
For some months one, and during
part of the time two. of our naval
ships have been stationed at Bluellelds
for the protection of all legitimate In
terests of our citizens. In September
last the government at Managua ex
pelled from Its territory twelve or more
foreigners. Including two Americans,
for alleged participation In the sedi
tious or revolutionary movements
ajpralnst the republic, but through the
earnest remonstrance eif this govern
ment the two Americans have been
permitted to return to the pewetful
management of their business.
Our naval commanders at the scene
wf these disturbnnct s, by their eem-
stant exhibition of iirmness and good
Judgement, contributed large by U the
prevention of more serkitw conse
quences and te the retornta f quiet
and order. I regret that In the mldsi
of these eceurrenoes there happened a
most grave and irritating failure of
Xiearaguan justice.
HOW JUSTICE MISCAKXUED.
An American elllxen nameel Wilson,
rcsldir.g at llama, in the Mosquito
territory, was murder -d by one Argu-
eMo, the acting governor f the town.
After some delay the murderer was
arrested, but so insecurely confined or
guarded that he escaped, and notwith

claimed that his recapture has beer.

WORK OF THE NAVT.
Trie estimates for the Increase of
the Navy for the year ending June SO.
1896. are large, but they include prac
tically the entire sum neeesaary to
complete and equip all the new ships
not now in commission, so that unles
new ships are authorized the appro
priations for the naval service for the
fiscal year ending June 30. 1897. should
fall below the estimates for the com
ing year by at leit $12,000,00. I recom
mend that provision be made for th-
contruction of additional battleships
and torpe-do boats. I feel also it my im
perative eluty to can attention to the
recommendation of the secretary in re
gard to the personnel of the line of the
navy. TTte stagnation of promotion in
this, the vital branch of the service, is
s great as to seriously iuipilr lis A
cKiie y. I consider it ut the uti3v..l In".-
pcrt;.;i: e t:.at the ount a..d ;..ij .'
.', f; d O-T.rers should, before the eve
retirement, be perniiltd to r.-acr. a
grade ntitliiig ihcm to act:ve and m-
pe.rtant e'uty.
"The s; stem adopted a few years
ago regulating the employment of la
beir at the navy yards Is rigidly upheld
and has fully demonstrated Its useful
ness and expediency. It Is within the
domain of civil service reform Inas
much as woikmcn are employed
through a board of labor selected at
cch navy yard and are given work
without reference to politics and In the
order of their application, preference,
however, being given to army and
navy veterans anel those having for
mer navy yard experience.
DISPOSAL, OF PUBLIC LANDS.
"The repent of the secretary of the
Interior exhibits the situation of the
numere.us and Interesting branches of
the public service connevtedi with his
department. The public land disposed
of during the year amounte-el to 10,
406.100.77 acres, Including 28,876.05 of
Indian lands. It estimated that the
public domain still remaing amounts
to a little more than 60,0W.0H0 acres,
excluding, however, about .'iSO.liiKJ.OOii
acres In Alaska as well aa military
reservations and railroad and other
selections of lands yet unadjudicated.
The total cash receipts from sale of
lands arimmited to $.'.647,285.79. Inclu
ding $91,9)11.03 received from Indian
lands.
"In the light of experience, and
considering the uncertainty of the In
dian situation and its exigencies in
the future, I am not only disposed to
be very cautious in making allotments,
but I Incline to agree with the secre
tary of the Interior In the opinion that
when allotments are made the balance
of reservatlem land remaining after
allotment. Instead eif being bought
from the lndl;.ns by the government,
and opened for settlement with ruch
scandals and unfair practices as seem
unavoidable, should remain for a time
at least as common land or be sold by
the government em behalf of the In
dians in an orderly way and at fixed
prices.
"The Intelligent Indian ' school man
agement of the past ye'ar has been fol
lowed by gratifying results. Five in
stitutes e.f Indian teachers have been
held during the year, and have prov
ed very beneficial througn tne views
exchanged.
HOW PENSION MATTERS STAND
The pension questiein Is then referred
to. Mr. Cleveland says: "
"At the close e.f the last fiscal year
on the 30th day of June. 1894, there1
were 969,544 persons em our pension
rolls, being a net increase of 3.532 over
the number reported at the end of the
previous yer.
"The se pensioners may be classified
as follows: Soldiers and sailors, sur
vlvors of all wars, 7.i3,98; widows ant.
relatives of decessed soldiers, 215162
army nurses In (he war of the rebel
lion, 414. Of these pensioners 32,039 are
surviving sol.liers of Indian and other
wars prios to the late civil war, and
the widows or relatives of such
soldiers.
soldiers. The remainder, numbering
137,505, are receiving pensions on ac
count of the war of the rebellion, anel
of these 469.341 are on the rolls under
the authority of the act of June 2
1890, Beimetime-S called the dependent
pension law. The total amount expen
ded for pensions during the year was
$139,804,416 (. leaving an unexpended
balance from the sum appreiprlated of
$25.205.712.6.". The sum necessary to
mee-t pens!en expenditure's for the year
ending June 30, 1896. Is estimated at
$1 40.W'fi, 0t0. The commissioner of pen
sions Is of the opinion that the year
18M, being the thirtieth after the close
of the wer of the rebellion, must ac-
ceirdlng to all sensible human calcula-
lon see the highest limit of the pen
sion redls. The number of certificates
Issued was 80,213. The names dropped
freim the rolls for all causes during the
year numbered 37,951. Among our pen-
sleiners are nine widows and three
daughters of soldiess of the revolu
tlem and forty-five survivors of the
war f 1812.
The bare-faced and extensive pen
sion frauds exposed under the direc
tion of the courageous and generous
veteran soldier now at the head of the
buresni leave no room for the claim
hat ni purgation of our pension rolls
was nefde-a. or that continued vigi
lance and prompt action are r.ot nec
essary to the Svime end."
ON AGRICULTURAL TRODCCTS.
The eftisun Is disposed of i a few
evoeds r.Tid with the ttemeTit that It

"A special study has bee-n made oi

months ending September 30.194, 305,

$16.634.001.1. during the same period for
1893. During the first six meinths of
1891 the United Kingdom took, also,
H2.O00.0o pounds of dressed beef from
the United States, valued at $10,600,000,
The report shows that during the nine

2.811 at an average value of $139 per
head.
"There was a falling off In American
wheat expeerls of 13.SoO.000 bushels, and
the secretary Is Inclined to believe that
wheat may not, in the future, be the
staple export cereal product of our
country, but that corn will continue to
advance in importance as an export on
account of the new uses to which It is
constantly being appropriated.
"The exports of agricultural products
from the United State's for the fiscal
year ending June 30. 1894. amounted to
$628,363,038. and the United Kingdom of
Great Britain took more than 54 per
cent nf all farm products finding for
eign markets.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
The advantages to the public ser
vice of an adherence to the principles
of civil service reform are constantly
more apparent: and nothing is so en
couraging to those in official life who
honestly desire gexwl government as
the increasing appreciation by our peo
ple, of these advantages.

COMMENTS ON THE TARIFF.
"The tariff act passed at the last
session of the congress needs import
ant amendments if It is to be executed
effectively and with certainty. In ad
dition to such necessary amendments
as will not e-hanga rates of duty, I am
still very decidedly in fnveir ef putting
coal and Iron upon the free list.
"So far as the si'gar schedule is con
cerned, I would be glad, under exist
ing Aggravations to see every particle
of differential duty in favor of refined
sugar stricken out of our tariff law
If with all the favor now accorded the
sugar-refining interest in our tariff
laws it still languishes to the extent
of closed refineries and thousands of
discharged workmen, it would seem to
preBent hopeless case for legislatlv
aid.
"With the advent of a new tariff
policy not only calculated to relieve
the consumers of our land In the cost
of their dally life, but to Invlle a bet
ter development of American thr'ft
and create for us close and more pi.i
fitable commercial relations with the
ri-st of the world. It follows as a Iori
cal and Imperative necessity that we
should at once remove the chief if not
the only obstacle which has so long
prevented our participation In the for
eign e'arrvlng trade of the se-a.
NEW SHIPPING LAWS.
"A tariff built iipe.n the theory that
It is well to check Imports and that fa
he.me market sheiuld bound the Indus
try and effort of American producers,
was fitly supplemented by a refusal to
allow American registry u vessels
built abroad, though owned aiid navi
gated by our people, thus exhibiting a
willingness to abandon all contest for
the advantages of American trans
oceanic carriage.
"Our new tariff policy, built upon the
thewy that it is well to em-ourage
such Importations as our people need.
and that our products and manufac
tures should find markets in every
irart of the habitable globe. Is consist
ently supplemented by the greatest
possible liberty to our citlze-rs In tr.c
ownership and navigation of ships ir.
which our products and manufacture-
may be tnmsiHirteHi. The millions now
paid to foreigners for carrying Amerl
can passengers and products ataoss the
sea should be turned into American
hands.
INTEREST ON BONDS.
"During the last month the gold re
served In the treasury for the purpose
of redeeming the notes of the govern
ment circulating as money In the
hands of the people became so reduced,
and its further depletion in the near
future seemed so certain that in the
exercise of proper care for the public
welfare It became necessary to replen
Ish this reserve and thus maintain
popular faith In the ability and deter
minatlon of the government to meet, as
agreed, its pecuniary obligations.
"It would be well If In this enter
gency authority had existed to Issue
the bonds of the government bearing a
low rate of Interest and maturing
within a short period; but the congress
having failed to confer such authority,
resort was necesasrlly had to the re
sumption act of 1875, and pursuant to
Its provlsiems bonds were issued drsw
ing Interest at the rate of five per cen-
per annum and maturing ten years
after their isue. that being the shortest
time authorized by the act. I am glad
to say, however, that on the sale of
these bonds the premium received op
erated to reduce the rate of interest to
be paid by the government to lens than
three per cent
"Ne thing could be weirse or further

DRAINS ON THE TREASURY.
inus we nave an enaiess chain in

treasury's gold and never near a final

we have, by a statutory declaration
that It is the policy of the government
to maintain r?ie parity between gold
and silver aided the force and moment
um of this exhausting process and ad
ded largely to the currency obligations
claiming this peculiar gold redemption.
Our small gold reserve is thus subject
to drain from every side. The de
mands that increase our danger also
Increase the necessity of protecting
this reserve against depletion, and It Is
most unsatisfactory to know that the
protection afforded is only a tempor
ary palliation.
It is perfectly and palpably plain
that the only way under present con
ditions by which this reserve when
dangerously depleted can be replenish
ed is through the issue and sale of the
bonds of the government for gold; and
yet congress has not only thus far de
clined to authorize the Issue of bonds
best suited to such a purpose, but
mere seems a aispositiem In some
quarters to deny both the necessity
and power for the issue of bonds at all.
I can not for a moment believe that
any of our citizens are eleliberately
willing that their government should
lefault in its pecuniary oOligations e r
that Its financial op. rations should be
reduced to a :'iivir basis,

"Questions relating to our banks and
currency are closely connected witlt
the subject just rele rred 'to and they
also present some unsatisfactory feat-,
ures. Prominent among them are laelt
of elasticity in our currency circulation
and its frequent coiKentrali..:i :n flit
anclui centers when it is most needed,
in other parts of. the country.
"The absolute divorcement of the
gocernment from the business of Lank
irg is the ide-al relationship of the gov
ernment to the circulation of the cur
rency of tha country.
"Th4s condition can not be Immedi
ately rcae-hed; but us a step in that
direction and as a means of securing
a meire elastic currency and obviating
other object ions to the present ar
rangement of bank circulation, the sec
retary of the treasury presents In his
report a scheme modifying present
banking laws and providing for the is
sue of circulating notes by state banka
free from taxation under certain lim
itations. "The secretary explains his plan so
plainly and its advantages are deve-l-oped
by him with such remarkable
clearness, that any effort on my part
to preserut argument in its support
would be superfluous. I shall, there
fore, content myself with an unquali
fied Indorsement of the secretary'
proposed changes in the law and a
brief and imperfect statement of their
prominent features. .
STATE BANK TAXES.
It Is pre.'.isid to repeal all laws pro
vidiiig or the deposit of United States
bonds as security lor circulation; to
permit national banksto issue circula
ting; notes not exceeding in amount
seventy-five jer cent, of teir paid-up
and unimpaired caiwtal, provided they
deposit with the Govermcnt, as a guar
antee fund, In United Slates legal ten
der note-s, Includlrg Treasury notes of
1890, a sum eqtial in amount to thirty
per cent, of the notes they desire tt
issue, this deposit to be maintained,
at alltlms. but whenever and bank re
tires ary part of its circulation a pro
portional part of its guarantee funel
shall be returned to it; to permit tha
Secretary of the Treasury to prepare
and keep on hand rady of issue In
case an increase in circulation is de
sired blank national-bank notes for
each bank having clculation and to
repeal the porvislons ef the present
law imposing limitations and restric
tions upon banks oSirlrg to reduce or
increase their circulation thus per
mitting such increase or reduction
within the limit of seventy-five per
cent, of captal to be quickly made as
emrgencies arise.
"Another very Important feature of
this plan is the exemption of state
bnnks from taxation by the United
States In 'cases where It Is shown to
the satisfaction of the secretary of ths
treasury ajd comptroller of the cur
rency by bank! claiming such exemp
tion that they have not had outstand
ing their circulating notes exceeding-seventy-ftve
per cent, of their paid-up-
arid unimpaired capital; that their
stockholders are Individually liable for-
the redemption of their circulating-
notes to the full extent of their owner
ship of stock; that the liability of said
banks upon their circulating notes
constitutes under their state law a
first Hen upon their assets; that such
banks have kept and maintained a
guaj-antee fund in United States legal-
tender notes including treasury notes
of 1890 equal to thirty per cent, of their
outstanding circulating notes and that
such banks have promptly redeemed
their circulating notes when presented
at their principal or branch offices." j
