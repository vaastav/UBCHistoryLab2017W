Birmingham. Ala.. Dec 14. — The
eleventh annual meeting of the Amer
ican Federation of Labor convened in
Ibis city at 10 o'clock this morning, be
ing called to order by President Samuel
Gompers. Gov. Thomas (J. Jones deliv
ered an address of welcome on behalf
of Birmingham, and Samuel 11. Free
man on behalf of the local labors.
About one hundred and fifty delegates
from all parts of the United Stales and
Canada are in attendance, and the meet
ing will last at l.uist a week.
President (.Jumpers, in calling the con
vention to order, said he would reserve
the delivery of his annual address until
tomorrow, and proceeded to deliver a
brief address of welcome. It was. he
said, the largest convention of the fed
eration in its history. The growth
of the organization during the oast
year had " been phenomenal, and
the delegates before him represented
more than three-quarters of a million of
organized laborers. Much, however,
as had been accomplished in the past,
much more still remained to be done in
the future. He pave a hearty welcome
to the delegates, and urged them to re
turn to their different organizations de
termined to push
Onward and Upward
forthe future. Continuing, he said:
"It should be our efforts to make each
succeed in convention of the American
Federation of Labor an improvement on
the preceding one, both in num
bers and intelligence, keeping
pace with the ever increasing intel
ligence and pressing demands of the
masses and the development of the in
dustries of our country. On every hand
we rind organization and combination
on the part of those who own or control
the wealth, and usinsi their possessions
to crush out the liberties!, to stifle the
ynice. to prevent the rights, of the toil
ing masses.
■•While it is true that many attempts
Lave been made to grapple "with this
condition of affairs, 7 puny and futile
have been the results. These com
binations can only be successful)
coped with by a compact and thorough
organization of the «vajre workers of our
country. The more thorough our or
ganization, the more complete
our representative capacity in
the conventions of the American Feder
ation of Labor, the more we will dem
onstrate to the world our fitness to
grapple with this nineteenth century
phenomena. The whole cause of hu
manity appeals to us to be true to the
miss on of our class, and help in the
nevci -ending contests for
Reform, Justice ami Iti^ht.
"The perpetuity of the institutions of
c r com try and the freedom of the
citizens and the man. the burdens upon
tie ■ shoulders of our sisters, the
c:;. of the young and innocent
children for ' relief, demand us
to labor all in our power, to exert every
effort we «re capable, to bring about a
condition of affairs more rational and
human, and relieve us from the stigma
of carlessness, and indifference of these
great wrongs by which we are sur
rounded.* 1
At the conclusion of the president's
address the convention went into ex
ecutive session and the doors were
closed. The usual committees were ap
pointed. General Secretary Chris
Evans then presented his annual
financial report, In doing so. lie
-aid: "The work of the past
year has developed many thoughts that
will serve educate and help to formu
late legislation for the wage-earners.
That mistakes have been made no one
v.ill question, but in the discussions that
•will :irise during the proceedings of our
meeting, let our motto be legis
lation for the relief of the masses
as against the selfish greed of the few;
lei the knowledge we have gained by
experience act as a guide for us in the
future to avoid as much as possible a
repetition of the errors of the past.
"The trades union movement is doing
a noble work in the line of reform. We
are not making as rapid progress as we
should. We arts
. lir<!it<-iii:i the ?lisery
and degradation of the wage-earning
class, however [the statement to the
contrary notwithstanding). Let us
move upward; press our claim foi
justice to the wealth producers, and
follow the path marked out by the
trades unions affiliated by the American
Federation of Labor, and success is
turn"
The report proceeded to state that
during the term ending Oct. :Jl, lS'.il,
240 charters had been issued to unions
in thirty states r.s follows: Ar
kansas, Connecticut, 2; Colorado. 4:
District of Columbia. 2: Georgia, "i: 11 li

THE INDIANA STRIKE.
In the face of Discouragemen
the Miners Are Firm.
Brazil, Imi.. Dec. 14.— The situatioi
In the bituminous coal regions of In
diana, in which some 20,000 miners an
on strike, is a gloomy one for the strik
ers, and its outcome may bring the wol
to the dcor of many a delver in tin
bowels of the earth in adjacent states
The Indiana strike is one ot desperatioi
according to the stories told by themei
■" p 3 at '" tjjS "~^k B I — . f
ati<o Baking
Used in Millions of Hoinen —40 $ears the Standard
and certainly the outlook is one of
pinching nuneer. if not actual starva
tion, cold and nakedness.
The mine operators say that the pres
ent strike is in violation" of an agree
ment made by the men last spring not
to ask for an advance m waires for one
year, and that, in view of that fact, they
will not negotiate with the strikers.
The latter say that the mine owners
took advantage of them last spring,
when they were not prepared for a
strike, to force them into si^nine an un
just scale, and that refusing to keep
that contract any looser than necessary
they are no Blare blameful than they
would ue to turn upon a highway rob
ber whenever opportunity ottered.
They declare that the "miners of In
diana have been more oppressed and
ground down than those ot any other
state in the Union; that their wagM
have been less: that they have been
subjected to all sorts of oppression; that
their condition was little better than
that of Russian convicts in Siberian
mines: and that they >truck for more
decent treatment in sheer desperation,
preferring starvation to further snbmis
sion, though their comuiitteemeii are
tryitie to hide the fact, it is nevertheless
true, that many of the men and their
families are already on the rente of
starvation, subsisting on one meal a
day, and have been doing so for two
weeks.
.The relief received thus far has been
very scant and. in some places the
strikers are totally without fuel, the
mine owners having undertaken to
freeze them out by refusing even to sell
j them coal. In the face of all this, how
j ever, the men talk with an air of grim
j determination to liirht it out to the
' death, if need be. There is hope, how-
I ever, that tins will not become neces
sary, as the national executive board
jot the coal miners' association of
! the United States has at last recognized
I the strike and approved it and has
issued a cail to allow its members to
contribute to the relief of the strikers.
This broadens the scope of the fight.
It lias been stated that mine owners in
adjoining states have been supplying
contracts for the Indiana mine owners.
This will be investigated by the board,
and if it cannot be checked in any other
j way, the miners in those states will be
: called out also. _
! GRIP OX THE RAMPAGE:
All Parts of This Country and Eu
rope in Its Clutches.
New Yoi;k. Dec. 14. — books of
j Dr. John Nagle, chief of the bureau of
vital statistics, show that a grip epi
demic is again brewing. Five deaths"
have occurred from the disease this
week, and a number of serious cases
an* reported.
Xashvii.i.i:.' Term., Dec. 14. — In
j fluenza seems to be on a rampage in
I Nashville. The estimate comes from
i good authority that no less than 8,000
I people here are now under, treatment
i ror it.
i Washington. Dec. 14. — Justices
i Lamar and Brown, ofjthe supreme court,
I are confined to their rooms by the
! grip. They are not seriously ill, how
i ever. The grip is quite prevalent.
} New Bedford, Mass., Dec. Phy-
I sicians say there are 101 cases of grippe
I here.
I London*. Dec. 14.— Reports of ravages
J of influenza in various parts of Europe
I are being constantly received. At Per
l igneux, France, twenty of the twenty
! two nuns occupying the convent of St,
i Clare are prostrate with the disease.
i When the nuns finally consented to ad
; mit outsiders, who for several days had
I vainly sought to offer them assistance,
i it was found that the poor women were
jin a starving condition, the only
I remaining food consisting of a small
i quantity of dried beans. "Proper food
1 and medical attendance were promptly
! supplied and the sufferers are now rap
j idly recovering. At Hamburg 1,1)03
! cases of influenza have been reported
| during the past week, and the death roll
| has not diminished. The famous
| pianist, Yon Bulow, is a victim of the
i disease ai.d Is in a critical condition.
i The epidemic is spreading rapidly in
j Jutland. Holland and Denmark.
I St. Pkikbsbubo, Dee. 14.— Influenza
I has assumed alarming forms here. Some
patients become mad and rush wildly
through the streets in violent paroxysms,
then have high fever and utter prostra
tion, often followed by death. In other
cases there are typhoid developments.
TALKING FOR MERUIAM.
Northwestern Republicans Enthu
siastic in His Cause
Chicago, — Prominent Repub
lican politicians of Minnesota, who have
passed through Chicago within the last
few days declare that the Northwest
intends to make a strong bid for the
second place on the Republican na
tional ticket. The man upon whom
they are practically united is Gov.
W. R. Merriam, of Minnesota.'
It is claimed in his behalf that
he is very popular in Minneapolis,
the convention etty, as well as through
out the state, and that the local feeling
cannot fail to make itself felt in the de
liberations of the convention. This is
aside from his actual qualifications for
the vice presidency, which are set out at
length and with a good deal of enthu
siasm.
(Joy. Jlerriani is a man of consider
, able wealth and will be backed in the i
, convention by such men as Thomas ;
■ Lowry, Col. C. H. Graves, Mayor Nut
phin. of Dulutli; Col. Mullen, ofWa
', basha, and many other leading Repub- !
i | Means. He will also, without doubt, be '
. j heartily supported by all the local Re- j
! publican papers. His supporters claim
j that he can have the votes of Montana
and the two Dakota*, besides those of
i I Minnesota, to start with, and that his
. | vote will increase as the contest goes
j on. •

Washington, Dec, 14.— The Repub

ine, previous to the assembling of trie
senate, and listened to the report of the

not make a report until tomorrow after
noon, it is now said. The list prepared
by the Republican caucus committee

It is apparent from the above list that ■
the senators from the Northwestern i
states have been well taken care of in j
the matter of chairmanships and places
on important committees. While
Messrs. Felton.Dubois and Ilansbrough
do not secure chairmanships, they do
get assignments to committees * that
originate a large part of the important
legislation of congress.
The name ot Senator Kyle does not
appear upon Che list, although .Senator \
Peffer, his Alliance colleague, is given
four committee assignments. It is
learned that Senator Kyle was ap- j
proached with a view to ascertaining
his preferences, but that his response '
was non-committal, and vaguely hinted
at an expectation that the Alliance sen
ators would receive committee assign
ments from both the Republican and
Democratic caucuses. Doubt has also
been cast upon his soundness in Repub
lican principles, so that up to this time
the Republican caucus has been unable
to place him, although it may do so to
morrow.
As nearly as can be gathered rom the
expressions of many senators, the as
signments made by the committee are
generally satisfactory. It was found
impracticable to meet all the expecta
tions of the new senators, but the dis
satisfaction that exists is believed to be
confined to less than half a dozen sena
tors. Messrs. Sacadera and Powers, of
Montana, wished to be assigned to (He
committees on appropriations and
finance, but the committee was unable
to comply with their requests in this re
spect.

Clarkson had declared himself for Pres
ident Harrison for renomiuation. "It
is not true.'" said Mr. Clarkson, "1 have
not declared myself for either Mr.
Hlaine or Mr. Harrison. 1 have no pref

about the intentions of either. "I saw
Mr. Blame several days ago and he
looked as well as he did when he re
turned from the Indian territory.. I
have not the least doubt but that the re

Blame are cordial and as friendly as
they always have been.' "Will Mr.
Blame's position be defined very soon."
"I have not heard anything about it."
Mr. Clarkson leaves for Minneapolis to

BRYAN'S BILLS.
A Nebraska Man Will Present a
P«« New Ones.
WAsmxr.Tox. Dec. 14.— When the
house is in condition to proceed to busi
ness. Representative Br^yan, of Nebras
ka, will propose a constitutional amend
ment that will, if adopted, permit any
state to elect its United States senators
by the vote of the people. Another
measure he has in view is in
tended to correct an evil that he says
prevails to a gnat extent in the
Northwest. He proposes to compel the
sale ot all property under United States
court processes in the county where
the property is sold, and causing: the
advertising of the same to be likewise
made in the county. It frequently hap
pens, says Mr. Bryan, that property is
advertised and sold many hundred
miles distant from where it is located.
Another measure he proposes to push
to passage, it he can. i> one providing
that when a certain amount has been
realized the inventor of a patented arti
cle shall cease to be protected.

finish fieht at Occidental Club

Blanche was bleeding at the month.
The right was stopped by the poiice in
