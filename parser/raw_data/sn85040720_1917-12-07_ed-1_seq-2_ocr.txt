FOOTBALL PLAYERS
ENIOY A BANQUET
GUESTS OF ELKS
The triumphant high school foot
ball team and a number of friends
were guests of Watertown Lodge No.
666, B. P. O. Elks Thursday evening as
a fitting close to a most successful
athletic season. The festivities began
at 7 o’clock and a three course dinner
was served. The affair was attended
by more than 100 persons. The ban
quet board was presided over by F. P.
McAdams as toastmaster, whose wit
and humor kept his audience in a
continuous uproar. John Keck presid
ed at the piano for the many songs
that were rendered during the dinner.
Alvin Stallmann rendered several
violin solos that were well received.
Prof. H. C. Reichert accompanied him
on the piano.
The banquet room was decorated in
the school colors with a large blue
and white pennant as the star with
the words “Welcome 1917 Champions.
B. P. O. Elks 666.” The pennant w r as
made especially for the occasion.
Speakers on the program were
Judge J. C. Karel of Milwaukee, wiio
spoke on the “Benefit of Athletics for
the Student;” P. J. Kelley, president
of the Elks lodge of Milwaukee, who
picked out every footballl man and
talked on him in a general w r ay. Mr.
McDonald of Milwaukee, president of
the business college which goes under
his name, proved himself a ventrilo
quist and funny story teller without
a peer and his hearers were highly
entertained.
0. C. Wertheimer delivered the ad
dress of welcome which was pleasing
and original. Prof. T. J. Berto also
spoke in reply to the address of Judge
Karel. Coach Thomas thanked the
Elks for the. entertainment afforded
the boys, and Capt. Fred Henke spoke
for the team. Mayor Charles Mulber
ger thanked the Elks in the name of
the city for the entertainment afford
ed the boys, stating that it showed
how great the interest in the team
was. Asst U. S. Dist. Atty. Arthur Mul
berger spoke on the fine appearance
of the boys in general and complim
ented them on their success.
Judge Karel’s Address.
In speaking of “The Benefit of Ath
letics for the Student” Judge Karel
said:
“Athletics, propel ly interpreted,
form a very important adjunct to
school life.
“While the school work is of para
mount importance, the value and ne
cessity of recreation for a full round
ed character is recognized by nearly
everyone. Recreation must be exerise,
yet it must have another incentive
than exercise; it must be a spontan
eous action of which the exercise is a
mere incidental part. In athletics,
w T here a spirit of contest and rivalry
exist, these conditions obtain.
“The benefits of athletics to the
student who participates is seldom
questioned, but it is urged that ath
letics are a benefit only to the few
w T ho may take part in the contest.
This, in a great degree is due to the
student’s lack of confidence in him
self. Never having tried he does not
think himself capable of doing any
thing in the athletic line. To be sure
some students have a greater natural
aptitude for athletics than others, yet
those who achieve final success are
often the ones who have started seem
ingly without hope of success and
have persisted, rather than those wiio
have shown the aptitude at first. So
no one should refrain from entering
athletics because he has no record.
“Then, too, the more who enter the
contests the more benefit each one ob
tains. The benefit comes chiefly to two
classes, but these two classes com
pose almost the entire student body.
The first is composed of those who
have school work alone to do, and en
ter athletics as their only method of
physical exercise the second class,
those who have other exercises but
enter athletics as a means of recrea
tion.
“The results of the training itself
are very beneficial, certain food, cer
tain hours for exercise and sleep, are
required of the athlete, and by fulfill
ing these requirements his physical
condition is improved, and he is in
better condition to stand the strain of
school work. He will accomplish more,
spending less time on his lessons.
“Again, the benefits are not phy
sical alone. The restraint, self-denial,
the quickness of perception, the rapid
decision necessary to success, and the
self confidence obtained are benefits
which leave a lasting impression on
character.”
“For success in football one must

AT THE CLASSIC TONIGHT.
be content to forget self and try to
make his effort but part of a unit or
team.
“Then again, in athletics, one learns
to take victory modestly and without
boastfulness, and when defeat comes
to take it quietly and without com
plaint, and in it to find a lesson for
future history.
“But like all things which are of
value, there is a tendency on the part
of some to allow athletics to predom
inate. and school work to suffer. This
needs to be guarded against, for ath
letics, while good under control, are
bad when master.”
Captain Henke Speaks.
Speaking for the football team,
Captain Fred Henke said:
In behalf of the team I wish to
thank the Elks for the honor they
have done us tonight. If we are not
already the champions then surely
the good wmrk of our coach, the en
couragement given by our superin
tendent and instructors, and the in
spiration of this affair will surely
bring us back victors. We promise to
play a clean, strong winning game
and above all will so conduct our
selves so as to reflect credit on us and
honor upon our good parents and
teachers. We are proud of our city
and we will fight at Green Bay to
bring added honor and glory to Wa
tertown and to make all of its citi
zens proud of us.
In biding you good night let me say
—We are going. We are coming back
and we are going to be the champions.

The tender of the old Watertown
high school building for a period of
ten years to be used by Dodge and
Jefferson counties as a teachers’

the action of the board of education

to be free. After that'a fair rental will
be demanded, but the upkeep of the
building must be borne by the two
counties.
The date of the Christmas school
vacation was changed to December 21
to January 2 and the spring vacation
will begin on Wednesday preceding
Easter and close on the Monday fol
lowing Easter, making the close of
the school year June 14 instead of
June 21, as formerly.

high school was increased SIOO per
year.

is to be painted and the walls of the
manual training room are to be plas
tered during the holidays.

NEWS GIVES PUBLIC
WILSON'S MESSAGE
EXCLUSIVELY HERE
The Watertown News published ex
clusively on Wednesday the full text
of President Wilson’s message to
congress the afternoon before. As us
ual the Watertown News made ar
rangements to cover this big event
and gave the greatest message ever
delivered by a president of the United
States to the world to its Watertown
readers a few hours following the de
livery and in the first issue of the pa
per following its presentation to con
gress. This message was the most im
portant and momentous address to the
world ever penned by man, and the
News covered the field in Watertown
exclusively.
In this message President Wilson
clearly sets out the aims and objects
of the nation in the worm war In
which most of the civilized countries
of the world are engaged. It should
be spread broadcast all over the
earth as advocating and breathing the
hopes and aspirations of mankind.
That the News was the first in the
local field to give its readers the text
of this important document only
serves to show that this paper will
render the best possible news service,
both national, state and local that can
be secured.
In an effort to establish a newspa
per in Watertown we have been as
sailed at divers times. The principle
of live and let live seems to be lost
to the senses of some malcontents.
After being clouted right and left for
being in existence we are assailed as
being the organ of Mayor Mulberger
and then again of being the organ of
Governor Philipp. If either of the gen
tlemen are on our subscription lists
it is news to the editor..
However, let that pass. Mayor Mul
berger may be a candidate for mayor
next spring, and he may not. If he is,
he will receive a handsome endorse
ment by the people as a worthy suc
cessor to a fine administration of pub
lic 'affairs.
The News is the organ of only one
man while the war lasts, and his name
is Uncle Sam. We have done our bit
in every way we were called upon and
gladly will do more and all within our
power.
No politics will creep up in national
affairs*while President Wilson is guid
ing the ship of state. He represents
the people of these United States and
he will be upheld by all lovers of
liberty and democracy, both at home
and abroad.
For some reason best known to him
self, the editor of the Daily Times has
seen fit repeatedly to assail in the
columns of his paper the man whro
preceded him in the conduct of that
paper twenty-one years and who sold
his interests in* good faith. The News
hts attended strictly to its own affairs
and has not meddled with what con
cerned the other sheet, but repeated
attacks upon us calls for a statement,
and we beg the indulgence of our
readers in bringing this matter to
public attention and we will not again
trespass upon them in this respect.

RARE MUSICAL TREAT
WAS EDDY RECITAL
HERE ON WEDNESDAY
Clarence Eddy’s recital at the Con
gregational church Wednesday regis
tered a success. He gave fine vintage
and cemented many new friends. The
dominant note in Mr. Eddy’s program
was catholicity. Most of his numbers
were modern although he also spoke
to us through the dead. The domin
ant note, however, was exhibited
rather in breath than depth; geogra
phy than age. The numbers included
Bach, Buck, Bonnet, Borowski, Bur
leigh, Martini, Holloway, Lucas, etc.
Men of many countries and not all of
the same color. The compositions
themselves evidence the same note. Mi-
Eddy is a psychologist. He knows the
average audience. The popularity of
his program was due, in part, to two
Things—sharp contrasts. A musical
level within reach. Consequently
there was little of the usual somno
lence. He created an audience keen,
appreciative, awake. And the Master
wove for their delectation melody, ro
mance, song and sonata, an “opus,” a
reverie, a description, an enchanting
alternating appeal to heart and head.
Mr. Eddy’s catholicity extended to
one other chief factor in organ recit
al. There are three besides the music
ian: composers, compositions, instru
ment. The program given us by Mr.
Eddy revealed the organ’s resources.
The arpeggio of the harp accompan
ied a study for the pedals; an orches
tra outburst was followed by the
sweet singing of a song; a pastorale
preceded Bossi’s brilliant Scherzo in
G minor. Those who knew best bowed
in reverent app eciation of the Mas
ter’s interpretive eloquence, bril
liant technique, uncanny facility of
the feet, the smooth lingering im
pressiveness.
Aii innovation was the Rev. N. Car
ter Daniell’s collaboration with Mr.
Eddy. The Rev. gentleman introduced
each number with a brief, apt descrip
tion or analysis. Its value was evi
dent. The terse clear interpretation
awakened expectancy. The audience
knew what to look for. Eagerly they
tested the speaker by the music. To
many, for the first time, music was not
a dead language. It spoke. They un
derstood. Towards the close Mr.
Eddy sought occasion to publicly
thank Mr. Daniell to whose work he
referred as being full of interest both
to himself and to the audience. Very
gracefully he characterized the
“brief, clear, poetic analyses and de
scriptions” as valuations which ap
pealed alike “to sense and sentiment.”
The thanks of the community are
due Mr. H. C. Reichert and Rev. N.
Carter Daniell through whose efforts
Mr. Eddy was induced to come to
Watertown.
SHOULD USE SUBSTITUTES
FOR WHEAT FLOUR NOW
“The shortage of wheat is each day
becoming more alarming,” says Mag
nus Swenson, food administrator for
Wisconsin, “and saving wheat is a
matter of absolute necessity if we are
going to avoid the calamity of being
without bread before the next har
vest.”
In order to enable this country to
make the wheat last until next har
vest it is absolutely necessary to sub
stitute corn or oatmeal for at least
one-third the usual consumption of
wheat bread. It has been very diffi
cult to get the people to do this, ow
ing to the high prices of cornmeal,
which in some cases has been as high
or higher than wheat flour. The new
corn will soon -be available and the
price of cornmeal ought to be greatly
reduced.
In the meantime we ask grocers
and dealers in cornmeal to assist the
Food Administration by selling corn
meal at the lowest possible price.
Make it a leader and try to get the
people to use cornmeal as much as
possible as a substitute for wheat
flour. It is up to every citizen, rich
or poor, to respond to this call, and
we ask the people of the state to en
list in this patriotic duty in order to
obviate one of the greatest calamities
that can befall the nation, a bread
famine. A national calamity that we
must do all in our power to avoid.
The only way to do this is to substi
tute other food for at least one-third
of the wheat bread that you are now
eating.
STENOGRAPHERS WANTED
GOOD PAY IS ASSURED
Now that Uncle Sam has the young
men of the country in training for
military service, he finds that he
needs 10,000 typewriter operators and
steographers and typewriters, both
men and women, for the departments
at Washington. The Civil Service
Commission has notified all of its
3000 boards of examiners that they
should put forth their best efforts to
secure these urgently needed workers.
While examinations are now held
weekly in 450 cities, the Commission
states that arrangements will be made
to have an examination held at any
accessible place where a small class of
applicants can be secured. The en
trance salaries range from SIOOO to
SI2OO a year. Promotion is reasonably
rapid to those whose services prove
satisfactory. No appointments can be
made to these or other positions in
the Federal classified civil service un
less authorized by the Civil Service
Commission under the civil service
law. Any information to the contrary
is unauthorized. This is a splendid op
portunity to serve your country. Full
information may be secured from the
secretary of the board of civil service
examiners at the postofflce in this
city.
