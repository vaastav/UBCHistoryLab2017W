THE POTLATCH HOG
Hog$ and Cattle Are Adding
Quota of Wealth to the Pot
jatch Farmer
A TIMELY HINT TO THE WISE
In the last week their has been
shipped out of the Kendrick market
by the Vollmer Clearwater Co, five
carloads of hogs and threg carloads
stock cattle, part of which went to
the Seattle and papf, to the Spokane
paarkets. Further than this we
iearn that Mr. Atchison has sent to
his brother on the Reservation some
10 head nf stock cattle to be followed
hy others for the purpose of feeding.
?ïhe points worthy of attention in
this item are the gradual increase of
hog-ratsing and stock production In
t;his section and the material benefit
that It has been to our farmers;
where a few years ago there was
hardly an animal shipped out of the
country and consequently not a dol
lar brought in by this method, the
records Show that over 9..............
has been received by. our farmers this
year alone for livestock, while the
cost of raising has been practically
nothing.
We have always been strong ad
vocates Of diversified farming and
would again urge our reader? to
make röom on the farm for a few
bead pf hogs, one or two sheep, and
a hoof or two of cattle; you will be
surprised at the small cost of keep
ing them and will be tickled tp see
the increase and to receive the mon
ey which in a few years will begin to
toll In from this small start.
*T)vej-.54 cars of stocx and hogs
have %en shipped from here this
year, fvblch is not so bad, but then
It shpuld have been over twice that
number and will be If each farmer
will do as outlined. Just try It for
a year or two and prove the above
statement.
