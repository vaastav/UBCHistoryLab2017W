Leboratory
It Is not so long ago that tho text
books on minerals used to describe
quartz as Infusible The electric
furnace has given tho Ho to this sped
fication and now some manufacturers
Iificatlon devices devote special
catalogues to apparatus made of this
substance Thero are two grades on
the marketthe transparent kind
made from rock crystal and looking
almost precisely Hko ordinary glass
and tho cheaper translucent variety
made of common silica and someUmes
called In the trade clectroquartz
Both kinds are valuable in the chem

of either resist all acids but hydro
fluoric and cannot be cracked by
change of temperature however via

To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives
The relations of the United Statea with
all foreign governments have continued
upon the normal basis of amity and coed
understanding and are very generally
satisfactory
Latin America
One of the happiest events in recent
PanAmerican dlplotMcy Wb the pacific
paclncIndependent
Independent settlement by the govern
ments of DoUvla and Peru of a boundary
difference between them which for come
weeks threatened to cause war and even
to entrain embltterments affecting other
republics less directly concerned From
various quarters directly or Indirectly
concerned the Intermediation of the Uni
ted States was sought to assist In a so
lution of the controversy Desiring at all
times to abstain from any undue mingling
In the affairs of sister republics and hay
hayIng
ing faith In the ability of the govern
ments of Peru and Bolivia themselves to
settle their differences In a manner satis
factory to themselves which viewed with
magnanimity would assuage all embit
terment this government steadily ab
stained from being drawn Into the con
troversy and was much gratified to find
Its confidence justified by events
On the ninth of July next there will
open at Buenos Aires the fourth Pan
American conference This conference
will have a special meaning to the hearts
of all Americans because around Its date
are clustered the anniversaries of the In
dependence of so many American repub
Ilea It Is not necessary for me to remind
the congress of tho political social and
commercial Importance of these gather
Ings You are asked to make liberal ap
propriation for our participation If this
be granted It la my purpose to appoint
a distinguished and representative dele
gallon qualified fittingly to represent this
country and to deal with the problems of
Intercontinental interest which will there
be discussed
The Argentine Republic will also hold
from May to November 1310 at Buenos
Aires a great International agricultural
exhibition In which the United States has
been Invited to participate Considering
the rapid growth of the trade of the Uni
ted States with the Argentine Republic
and the cordial relations existing between
the two nations together with the fact
that it provides an opportunity to show
deference to a sister republic on the oc
casion of the celebration of its nation
al Independence the proper departments
of this government are taking steps to ap
price the Interests concerned of the opo
portunity afforded by this exhibition in
which appropriate participation by this
country Is so desirable The designation
of an official representative is also receiv
recelvIn
The PanAmerican policy of this gov
ernment has long been fixed In Its prin
ciples and remains unchanged With the
chanced lrcumstances at the United
States and of the republic to the south
of us most of which have great natural
resources stable government and pro
gressive Ideals the apprehension which
gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be
laid to have nearly disappeared and nel
ther doctrine as It exists nor any
other doctrine of American policy should
Be permitted to operate for the perpetua
tion of Irresponsible government the es
cape of just obligations or the Insidious
allegation of dominating ambitions on the
part of the United States
Beside the fundamental doctrines of our
TanAmerican policy there have grown
jp a realization of political Interests
jommunlty of institutions and Ideals and
i flourishing commerce All these bonds
will be greatly strengthened as time goes
an and Increased facilities such as the
great bank soon to be established In lat
nAmerlca supply the means for build
ing up the colossal Intercontinental com
merce of the future
My meeting with President Dtas and
the greeting exchanged on both Ameri
can and Mexican soil served I hope to
signalize the close and cordial relations
which so well bind together this republic
and the great republic Immediately to the
south between which there is so vast a I
network of material Interests
I am hAPPY to say that all but one of
the cases which for so long vexed our
relations with Venezuela have been set

ment of the United States as a consult

Department of State
I earnestly recommend to the favor
able consideration of the congress the es
timates submitted by the department of
state and most especially the legisla
lion suggested In the eecrtarjr of states
letter of this date whereby It will be
possible to develop and make permanent
the reorganization of the department
upon modern lines In a manner to make
It a thoroughly efficient Instrument In
the furtherance of our foreign trade and
of American Interests abroad The plan
to have divisions of LatinAmerican and
FarCastern affairs and to Institute a
certain specialization in business with
Europe and the near east will at once
commend Itself These politico geograph
ical divisions and the detail from the
diplomatic or consular service to the
department of a number of men who
bring to the study of complicated prob
lems In different parts of the world
practical knowledge recently gained on
the spot clearly ls of the greatest ad
vantage to the secretary of state In
foreseeing condition likely to arise and
in conducting the great variety of corre
spondence And negotiation It should be
remembered that such facilities exist In
the foreign office of all the leading com
mercial nation and that to deny them
to the secretary of state would be to
place this government at a great disad
vantage In the rivalry of commercial
competition
The consular service has been Im
proved under the law of April I 198
and the executive order of June ZI 1908
and I commend to your consideration the
question of embodying In a statute the
principles of the present executive order
upon which the emclency of our consular
service Is wholly dependent
Expenditures and Revenues
Perhaps the most Important question
presented to this administration II that
of economy In expenditures and suffi
ciency of revenue The deficit of the
last fiscal year and the certain deficit
of the current year prompted congress
to throw a greater responsibility on
the executive and the secretary of the
treasury than had heretofore been de
clared by statute This declaration
Imposes upon the secretary of the
treasury the duty of assembling all the
estimates of the executive departments
bureaus and offices of the expenditures
necessary In tho ensuing fiscal year
and of making an estimate of the reve
flues of the government for the same
period and If a probable deficit Is thus
shown It II mado the duty of the presi
dent to recommend the method by
which such deficit can be met
The report of the secretary shows
that the ordinary expenditures for the
current fiscal year ending June 30 1910
will exceed the estimated receipt by
i34OT5620 If to this deficit Is added
the sum to be disbursed for the Pan
ama Canal amounting to 118000000
and Jl 000000 to be paid on tho public
debt the deficit of ordinary receipts
and expenditures will be increased to
a total deficit of t7S075C20 This def
icit the secretary proposes tp meet by
the proceeds of bonds Issued to pay
the cost of constructing the Panama
Canal I approve this proposal
In order to avoid a deficit for the
ensuing fiscal year I directed the
heads of departments In the prepara
tion of their estimates to make them
as low as possible consistent with im
perative governmental necessity
Civil Pensions
I am aware that there Is a strong
feeling In both houses of congress and
possibly In the country against the
establishment of civil pensions and
that this has naturally crown out of
the heavy burden of military pensions
which It has always been the policy
of our government to assume but I
am strongly convinced that no other
practical solution of the difficulties
presented by the superannuation of
civil servants can be found than that
of a system of civil pensions
Frauds In the Collection of Customs
I regret to refer to the fact of the
discovery of extensive frauds In the
collection of the customs revenue at
New York city in which a number of
the subordinate employe In the weigh
Ing and other department were di
rectly concerned and In which the
beneficiaries were the American Sugar
Refining Company and others The
fraud consisted In the payment fft
duty on underweights of sugar The
government has recovered from the
American Sugar Refining Company all
that it Is shown to have been defraud
ed of The sum was received In full
of the amount due which might have
been recovered by civil suit against
the beneficiary of the fraud but there
was an express reservation In the con
tract of settlement by which the settle
ment should not Interfere with or pre
vent the criminal prosecution of every
one who was found to be subject to
the same
Criminal prosecutions are now pro
ceeding against a number of the gov
ernment officer The treasury de
partment and the department of jus
ice are exerting every effort to dis
cover all the wrongdoers Including
the officers and employee of the com
panies who may have been privy to
the fraud It would seem to me that
an Investigation of the fraud by Con
gress at present pending tho probing
by the treasury department nnd the
department of justice as proposed
might by giving Immunity ami other
wise prove an embarrassment In scour
ing conviction of the guilty parties
Tho Tariff Act
mro feature of the new tariff act
call for special reference By virtue
of the clause known as the maximum
and minimum clause It III the duty
of the executive to consider the laws
and practices of other countries with
reference to the Importation into those
countries of the products and mer
chandise of the United States and It
the executive finds such laws and prac
practices
tices not to be unduly discriminatory
against the United States the mini
mum duties provided In tho bill are to
go Into force Unless the president
makes such a finding then the maxi
mum duties provided In the bill that
Is an increase of 25 per cent ad valo
rem over the minimum duties are to
be In force Fear has been expressed
that this power conferred and duty
Imposed on the executive Is likely to
lead to a tariff war 1 bog to express
the hope and belief that no such result
neht be anticipated
The discretion granted to the execu
tlvo by the terms unduly discrim
inatory III wide In order that the
maximum duty shall lie charged against
tho Import from a country It III neces
sary that he shall find on the part of
that country not only discrimination
In its laws or the practice under them
against the trade of the United States
but that the discriminations found
shall be undue that Is without good
and fair reason I conceive that this
power was reposed in the president
with the hope that the maximum du
ties might never be applied in any case
but that the power to apply them would
r
enable the president and the state de
partment through friendly negotiation
to secure the elimination from the laws
and the practice under them of any
foreign country of that which Is un
duly discriminator No ana Is seek
ing a tariff war or a condition in which
the spirit ef retaliation shall be
around
Needs of the Navy
The return of the battleship fleet from
Its voyage around the world In more
efficient condition than when It started
Was a noteworthy event of Interest alike
to our citizens and the naval authorities
of the world Besides the beneficial and
far reaching effect on our personal and
diplomatic relation In the countries
which the fleet visited the marked sue
cess of the ships In teaming around the
world In all weathers In schedule time
has Increased respect for our navy and
has added to our national prestige
Injunctions Without Notice
The platform of the successful party In
the last election contained the following
The Republican party will uphold at
all times the authority and Integrity of
the courts state and federal and will
ever Insist that their powers to enforce
their process and protect life liberty
and property shall be preserved Inviolate
We believe however that the rules of
procedure In the federal courts with re
spect to the Issuance of the writ of In
junction should be more accurately de
fined by statute and that no Injunction
or temporary restraining order should be
Issued without notice except where Ir
reparable Injury would result from delay
In which case a speedy hearing here
after should be granted
I recommend that In compliance with
the promise thus made appropriate legis
lation be adopted The ends of justice
will best be met and the chief cause of
complaint against illconsidered injunc
tion without notice will be removed by
the enactment of a statute forbidding
hereafter the Issuing of any Injunction
or restraining order whether temporary
or permanent by any federal court
without previous notice and a reasonable
opportunity to be heard on behalf of the
parties to be enjoined unless It shall ape
pear to the satisfaction of the court that
the delay necessary to give such notice
and hearing would result In Irreparable
IrreparabeInjury
Injury to the complainant and unless also
the court shall from the evidence make
a written finding which shall be spread
upon the court minutes that immediate
and Irreparable Injury Is likely to ensue
to the complainant and shall define the
Injury state why It is Irreparable and
shall also Indorse on the order Issued the
date and the hour of the Issuance of the
order Moreover every such injunction
or restraining order issued without pre
vious notice and opportunity by the de
Pendant to be heard should by force of
the statute to expire and be of no effect
after seven days from the Issuance thereof
of or within any time less than that pe
rind which tbe court may fix unless
within the Injunction or order Is ex
tended or renewed after previous notice
and opportunity to be heard
Second Class Mall Matter
The deficit every year In the post
office department Is largely caused by the
low rate of postage of one cent a pound
charged on second clas mall matter
which Includes not only newspapers but
magazine and miscellaneous periodicals
The actual loss growing out of the trans
mission ef this secondclass mall matter
at one cent a pound amounts to about
V300000 a year The average cost of the
transportation of this matter Is more than
nine cents a pound
It appears that the average distance ov
er which newspaper are delivered to
their customers U at miles while the
average haul of magazines Is 1049 and
of miscellaneous periodicals 113 miles
Thus the average haul of the magazine
Is three and one halt times and that of
the miscellaneous periodical nearly four
times the haul of the dally newspaper yet
all of them pay the same postage rate of
one cent a pound The statistic of 1907
show that secondclass mall matter con
stituted GUt per cent of the weight of
all the mall and yielded only BIJ per cent
of the revenue
The figures given are startling and
show the payment by the government of
an enormous subsidy to tho newspapers
magazines and periodicals and congress
may well consider whether radical steps
should not bo taken to reduce the deficit I
In the postoffice department caused by
this discrepancy between the actual cost
of transportation and the compensation
exacted therefor
A great saving might be made amount
ing to much more than half of the loss
by Imposing upon magazines and pert
odicals a higher rate of postage They
are much heavier than newspapers and
contain a much higher proportion of aI
vertising to reading matter and the aver
age distance of their transportation is
three and a halt times u great
Postal Savings Banks
The second subject worthy of mention
In the postoffico department In the real
necessity and entire practicability of es
tablishing postal savings banks The suc I
cessful party at the last election declared i
In favor of postal savings banks and al
though the proposition finds opponents In
many parts of the country I am con
vinced that the peoplo desire such banks
and am sure that when the banks are fur
nished they will be productive of the ut
most good
goodFavors Ship Subsidy
Following the course of my distin
guished predecessor I earnestly recom
mend to congress the consideration and
passage of a ship subsidy bill looking to
the establishment of lines between our
Atlantic seaboard and the eastern coast
of South America as well as lines from
the west coast of the United States to
South America China Japan and the
Philippines The profits on foreign malls
are perhaps a sufficient measure of the
expenditures which might first be tenta
tively applied to this method of inducing
American capital to undtirtakn the estab
lishment of American lines of steamships
In those directions In which we now feel
It most Important that we should have
means of transportation controlled in the
Interest of the expansion of our trade A
bill ef this character has once passed the
house and more than onto passed thIS
senate and I hope that at this session a
bill framed on the same lines and with
the same purposes may become a law
Conserving National Resources
In several departments there It present
ed the necessity for legislation looking to
the further conservation of our national
resources and the subject It one of ouch
Importance as to require n more detailed
and extended discussion than can be en
tered upon In this communication For
that reason I shall tale an curly oppor
tunity to send A special message to con

faith but our faith depends on bin
love Our service depends on his love
also We need to feed our faith there
It wo are to servo him at nil If any
man servo me lot him follow me
The way to servo Is to be a disciple
to sit at his feet to learn of him
Ileforo wo can do his work wo must
drink of his spirit and tot him teach
us his secret Before wo can servo
him we must bo humble enough to let
him servo us Behold said Thomas
a Kcmpls all things aro thine which
I have and whereby I servo thee And
yet contrariwise thou rather sorvvftt
me than I thee
This It the root of our faith the
source of our strength and tho very
heart of + ur communion Namely that
the Son of Man came not to bo min
istered unto but to minister Them ur
