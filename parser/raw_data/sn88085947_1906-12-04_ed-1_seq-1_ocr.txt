eral times. The defense introduced
in substantiation a letter written
bylb Mr. Sloane from New York

penniless and wearing dirty linen,
and that if he did not get into tht?
asylum for the shakes, he would
travel as far as Niagrar Kails ana

verge of delirium tremens. Mrs.
Sloane said he reached home all
right.

ther into testimony of this sort
this morning.
Continuing her testimony Airs.

a marked regard between Mr.
Sloane and Sidney. It was so
strong that they Seldom met nnj
where, even on the street, with
out embracing.
She said she noticed her hus
band's falling mind, more particu
larly Ills loss of memory and his
failing to make account of money.
Those characteristics grew on him
as time passed.
Soon after tho direct oxamiua
lion of Mrs. Sloane was continued
tins morning Prosecutor Barnhart
arose and protested that Attorney*
Robertson and Wltherapoon for the
defense were in consultation with-

yesterday. There was a heated
dispute until Judge Huneke inter
posed and told tooth attorneys to
belt quiet. Then he told Robert
son that if a consultation had been
held in hearing of tlie Jury, it must
not happen again. Robertson In
sisted that no such thing had oc
curred. He was so vehement that
the court warned him of punish
ment. Robertson kept on until

Mrs. Sloane testified that her
.boy was subject to uncontrollable
impulse, as shown by his furious
riding cf a bicycle. She tried to
have him write let tot s to his
Ctther, but he would not learn tv
read, write or spell well enough
to compose a letter. He was sub
let to spasms when he was six
months old. He had these fits
again when a year old. At such

In regard to the application of
the injunction process to laboi

NOTEO PIONEER
DEAD
Ono of tho groat men who help
ed to make the state of Washing
ton passed away yesterday in th*»
death of George B. Colo, a resident
of Spokkne. He died suddenly
yesterday in Portland* to which
city he went last Friday to visit,
his 'brothel in law, l>r, .1. It. Card
well. Iv this city he had resides
for several years at the home ot
his nephew, Charles A. Cole, 707
Nora ay.
Ex-Governor Cole crossed the
plains In 1849. Previous to coming
to Washington in IStU ho hao
served in the Oregon legislature
and was postmaster at Corvallls.
While a resident of Walla Walla

as postmaster at Portland 'by

COYLE ON TRIAL TODAY
w. w Coyle, arrested yesterday
OB a charge of robbery preferred
the 'best plan for dealing with the
differences betwen capital and la
bor. Preachers of discontent on
the laborers' side and wealthy
violators of the law are placed in
the same category and the sup
pression of both urged by all regu
lar means.
The operation of the Interstate
commerce law is cited as refuta
tion of the claim that It would
r»gn the railroads on the one hand
and that it did not go far enough
on the other. Greatly increaseu
earnings have been shown by the
roads in the five months the law
has been effective, and the same
period has produced an unprece
dented number of reductions ir,
freight tariffs and fares. Two days
before the law went into effect on
Aug. 27 the commission received
notices of over 5.000 separate tar
iffs, each representing a reduction.
Federal control of the roads is
urged as the hest possible anti
dotes for the agitation toward gov
ernment ownership and socialistic
principles.
The president holds that the
government should not conduct the
business of the nation, but that It
should exercise such supervision
a; will insure its being conducted
in the interet of the nation. This
r.-'e is made applicable to both ot-
BjSnized capital and organized la
b|i.
Hearty concurrence is given the
iJ-.md Army proposition to erect
aji amphitheater for the observ
ance of Memorial day at the Na
t *>nal cemetery at Arlington, near
Y. ashington city.
In regard to the marriage and
d'vorce question the president be
Itevei that problem should b*.
relegated to the authority of the
national congress In order to se
cure uniformity of divorce laws
and also because it would confei
on congress the power to deal
With a razor.
Armstrong warded off the blows

radically and efficiently with
polygamy.
Encouragement to American
shipping Is urged along the line*
laid down in the report Bubraittea
to the last congress.
The president does not press
any particular plan for currency
reform, but argues its necessity
and calls attention to the scheme
proposed by the secretary of tbe
treasury and endorsed by bankers
and business men for securing
elasticity of currency in crop mov
ing times and other periods when
greater volumes of money arc
needed than ordinarily.
Lower tariff or absolute free
trade is recommended for the
Philippines. American citizen
ship should be conferred on the in
habitants of Porto Rico. Attention
is asked for Alaska's needs and
favorable mention made of the
Alaska-Yukon-Pacific exposition to
be held nt Seattle.
The recent, revolution in Cuba
and action of this country is re
hearsed and the coming election In
the island set as the mark for end
ing the provisional government un
less It is shown that the Cubans
are still unable to carry on their
government unaided. The presi
dent promises a full report later
on his visit to Panama.
The need for amending the laws
governing seaftng in the north Is
pointed out in a recital of the
ruthless slaughter of seals that
has reduced the herd on Pribolof
island from nearly 5,000,000 to less
than 200,000. The incident in which
five Japanese poachers were kill
ed laat summer is mentioned and
the government will establish a
still more adequate patrol next
season.
Under the head of peace and
righteousness the president makes
a strong plea for honorable peace,
bubt holds that war is justifiable
and Imperative when peace can be
obtained only by sacrllice of con
scientious conviction or of national
welfare.
Along these the main
tenance of the navy at its present
standard is urged and additional
trained men requested for the
coast defense departments of the
army.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 4 —
The president's attitude on the
