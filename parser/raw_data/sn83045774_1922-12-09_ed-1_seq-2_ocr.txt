hoped to dictate to or destroy the Republican
party through the creation of
a national movement. With two or
three exceptions the comment of promoters
of the farm bloc was impressively
favorable to the President's
clear cut and tangible scheme for providing
relief for the farmers.
Railway Policy Applauded.
The President's precise and accurate
description of the causes and effects
of the conditions which brought about
the railway strike last summer and
added to the other burdens of the
farmers, was also generously applauded.
His statement that a merger
of railway lines into systems, a facilitated
interchange of freight cars, the
economic U6e of terminals, the consolidation
of facilities might be necessary
to bring about badly needed improvements
found instant response and
approval on the part of the vast majority
of Republican legislators and a
great many Democratic.
The President's condemnation of the
obstinacy of both the railway executive
and railway labor groups was
vocally Indorsed, as was the suggestion
that a neutral and non-partisan labor
board with Increased powers might
more fully meet the situation than the
present plan.
Hearty applause followed his declaration
that "it is an impotent civilization
and an inadequate government
which lacks the genius and the courage
to guard against such a jnenace
to public welfare as we experienced
last summer." The President was referring
to the strikes which wrought
such disastrous consequences to the
business of the country.
t l.e?? Applause for Tariff.
There was rather less applause to
his reference to the new tariff law
which the leaders of his party concede
contributed to Democratic advantage
in the recent elections. There was
much more approval when he declared
there was no justification for the assumption
that while this country was
unwilling to assume the correction of
all of the ills of the world such unwillingness
implied any reluctance to
cooperate with other peoples or to assume
all just obligations to promote
human advancement. His denunciation
of the abuse of national hospitality
by the advocates of revolution who
are finding their deluded followers
among those "who ta'ke on the habilipients
of an American without knowing
an American soul" was likewise
deceived with approval.
The greatest outburst of applause
name when the President touched on
t^ho prohibition law, although his con
aemnation or widespread contempt for
that measure brought less of favorable
reaction than this statement regvdlng
the cause of such contempt.
"Constitutional prohibition has been
adopted by the nation. It is the supreme
law of the land. In plain
speaking there are conditions relating
o its enforcement which savor of a
wide scandal. It is the most
ilizing factor In our public life."
Majority Seems Wet.

nent reflects the honest Cong
iOnal view of the prohibition law
a of the members of the two
s are decidedly wet because the
i majority of them united in apdtng
it. with some of the specks
in the galleries Joining in.
ie President's reference to foreign
jlems of which the United States j
tt take cognizance developed mixed i
Hons. The group of Senators who
lOsed the treaties agreed on by tho
iference for the limitation of armants
obviously did not like one or
o references made to them. This
s particularly tru$ of his efe.rence
the four Power treaty "which nbolies
every probability of war on the

in a maintained peace and we can well
believe that it might be made a model

Comment by Republican and Democratic
Senators who opposed the
League of Nations and armaments
treaties reflected their determination
to oppose the implied ambition of the
Government to extend the Pacific
treaties to cov?r the Atlantic as soon
as the former are ratified by nations
which have yet to act on them.
'Death Bnttnllon" Silent.
The leaders of the "Death Battalion"
In the Versailles treaty fight did not
Join In the applause that swept over
the House of Representatives when
the President further touched on the
international situation. They appeared
to find cause for complaint with this
declaration of the President:
"Moreover, we are cognizant of the
world's struggles for full readjust- j
ment and rehabilitation, and we have
shirked no duty which comes of sympathy,
of fraternity or highest fellowship
among nations. . . . Our constitutional
limitations do not forbid
the exercise of moral Influence, the
measure of which is not less than the
high purposes we have sought to
serve. After all, there is, less difference
about the part this great republic
shall play in furthering peace and
advancing humanity than In the man- <
ner of playing It."
The bloc of Senators opposed to all I
foreign alliances appeared to sense In j
the concluding declarations of the ;
President's address an Indorsement et i
Ihe principle* met forth In the Versailles
treaty, which the Senate refused
to approve more than three
years ago. Whether there Is any Justification
for their apprehensions on
this score Is a matter of opinion. Secretary
Hughes refused to elucidate or,
In fact, to discuss the President's
statements in any way.
fnsnrgent* Ttefnse ?o Comment,
Supporters of the President In both
houses attach much significance to the
fact that Senators I>a Follette, Borah
and their associates in the insurgent
and radical group refused to comment
on the President's address. Private
admissions credited to these legislators,
however, clearly reflected their
displeasure over the most important
periods of It, particularly those relating
to the agricultural and labor situations.
Spokesmen for the President contended
that he had taken "an advance
step" In dealing with these
problems and that the effect of his
suggestions would make Improbable
the success of any Insurgent or radical
movements engineered by his critics
in Congress. The President's
friends appeared to think he had
"taken the starch out of the I*a Follette
movement" by winning the supj
port of the agricultural bloc.

Wuthlntlon, D. C., Dec. 8. J
Following Is the full text of the
message delivered to Congress hy
President .Harding to-day:
Members or the Congress:
So many problems are calling fo- solution
that a recital of ail of them, In
the face of the known limitations of
a short session of Congress, wDUld
seem to lack sincerity of purpose.* It
Is four jears since the world war
i-iiucu, dui mu inevnapie reaujusiineni
of the social and econmoic order is not
more than barely begun. There Is no
acceptance of pre-war conditions anywhere
In the world. In a very general
way humanity harbors Individual
wishes to go on with wartime compensations
for production, with prewar
requirements in expenditure. In
short, every one, speaking broadly,
craves readjustment for everybody
except himself, while there can be no
just and permanent readjustment except
when all participate.
The civilization which measured its
strength of genl-us and the power of
science and the resources of industries,
in addition to testing the limits
of man power and the endurance and
heroism of men and women?that
same civilization Is brought to its sevjrest
test ip restoring a tranquil order
and committing humanity to the
stable ways of peace.
If the sober and deliberate appraisal
of pre-war civilization makes It
seem a worth while inheritance, then
with patience and good courage it will
be preserved. There never again will
be precisely the old order; indeed, I
know of r.o one who thinks it to be
desirable. For out of the old order
came the war Itself, and the new order
established and made secure, never
will permit its recurrence. ^
It is no figure of speech to say wo
have come to tne test of our civilization.
The world has been passing?is
to-day passing?through a great crisis.
The conduct of war itself it not more
aimcult than the solution of the problems
which necessarily follow. I am
not speaking at this moment of the
I problem In Its wider aspect of world
! rehabilitation or of International relationships.
The reference Is to our
own social, financial and economlo
problems at home*. These things are
not to be considered soley as problems
apart from all International relationiship,
but every nation must be able
to carry on for Itself, else Its international
relationship will have scent Importance.
Doubtless our own people have
emerged from the world war tumult
less impaired than most belligerent
Powers; probably we have made
larger progress toward reconstruction.
Surely we have been fortunate
In diminishing unemployment, and our
industrial and business activities,
which are the life blood of our material
existence, have been restored
as in no other reconstruction period cf
like length in the history of the world.
Had we escaped the coal and railway
strikes, which had no excuse for their
beginning and less Justification for
their delayed settlement, we should
have done infinitely better. But labor
was insistent on holding to the war
heights, and heedless forces of reaction
sought the pre-war levels, and
both were wrnnir
In the folly of conflict our progress
wri hindered .and the heavy cost has
not yet been fully estimated. There
can be neither adjustment nor the
penalty of the failure to readjust In
which all do not somehow participate.
The railway strike accentuated the
difficulty of the American farmer.
The first distress of readjustment
came to the farmer, and It will not be
a readjustment fit to abide until he
Is relieved. The distress brought to
the farmer does not affect him alone.
Agricultural 111 fortune Is a national
111 fortune. That one-fourth of our
population which produces the food
of the republic and adds so largely to
our export commerce must participate
In the gOod fortunes of the nation,
els^ there is none worth relating.
Agriculture Is a vital activity in our
national life, in It we had our beginning
and its westward march with the
star of the Kmplre has reflected the
growth of the Republic. It has Its
vicissitudes which no legislation will
prevent. Its hardships for which no
law can provide escape. Rut the Congress
can make available to the farmer
the financial facilities which have
been built up under Government aid
and supervision for otherWommerclal
and Industrial enterprises. It may be
done on the same solid fundamentals
and make the vitally Important agricultural
Industry moru secure, and It
must be done.
This Congress already has taken
cognisance of the misfortune which
precipitate deflation brought to American
agriculture. Your measures of
relief and the reduction of the Federal
Reserve discount rato undoubtedly
saved the country from yldesprcad
disaster. The very proof of
helpfulness already given Is the
strongest argument for the permanent
establishment of wider credits heretofore
temporarily extended through
the War Finance Corporation.
The farm loan bureau, which already
has proven Its usefulness through the
Federal Band Banks, may well have Its
powers enlarged to provide ampl4farm
production credits as well as enlarged
land credits. It Is entirely practical
to create a division In the Federal
Band Banks to deal with production
credits, with the limitations of time so
adjusted to the farm turnover as the
Federal Reserve system provides'for
the turnover In the manufacturing and
mercantile world.
Special provision must he made for
livestock produrtl^n credits and the
limit of land loans may he safely enlarged.
Various measures are pending
before you, and the best Judgment of
Congress ought to be expressed In a
prompt enactment at the present session.
But American agriculture needs j

more than added credit facilities. The
credits will help to solve the pressing
problems growing out of war Inflated
land values and the drastic deflation
of three years ago. but permanent knd
deserved agricultural good fortune depends
on better and cheaper transport
tation.
Here is an outstanding problem,
demanding the most rigorous consideration
of the Congress of the country.
It has to do with more than agriculture.
It provides the channel for the
flow of the country's commerce. But
the farmer Is particularly hard hit.
His market, so affected by the world
consumption, does not admit of the
price adjustment to meet carrying
charges.
In the last half of the year now
closing, the railways, broken In carrying
capacity because of motive power
and rolling stock out of order, though
Insistently declaring to the contrary,
embargoed his shipments or denied
him cars when fortunate markets were
calling. Too frequently transportation
failed while prelshable products were
turned from possible proftt to losses
,.,,,,,,>.^1 In tone nt n.illlnnu
I know of no problem exceeding In
importance this one of transportation.
In our complex and interdependent
modern life transportation is
essential to our very existence. Let
us pass for the moment the menace
in the possible paralysis of such service
as we have and note the failure,
for whatever reason, to expand our
transportation to meet the nation's
needs.
The census of 1880 recorded a population
of 50,000,000. In two decades
more we may reasonably expect to
count thrice that number. In the
three decades ending in 1920 the country's
freight by rail increased from
631,000.000 tons to 2,234,000.000 tons;
that is tc say, while our population
was Increasing less than 70 per cent.,
the freight movement increased over
250 per cent.
We built 40 per cent, of the world's
railroad mileage, and yet And it inade- ,
quate to our present requirements.
When we contemplate the inadequacy
of to-day it is easy to believe that the
next fe^r decades will witness the paralysis
of our transportation?using social
scheme or a complete reorganization
on some new bases. Mindful of
the tremendous costs of betterments,
extensions, and expansions, and mindful
of the staggering debts of the
world to-day, the difficulty is magnified.
Here is a problem demanding wide
vision and the avoidance of mere
makeshifts. No matter what <the
errors of the past, no matter how we
acclaimed construction and then condemned
operations in the past, we
have the transportation and the
honest Investment in the transportation
which sped us on to what we are,
and we face conditions which reflect
its inadequacy to-day, its greater
inadequacy to-morrow, and we coiftemplate
transportation costs which
much of the traffic cannot and will
not continue to pay.
Manifestly, we have need to begin
on plans to coordinate all transportation
facilities. We should more effectively
connect up our rail lines with
cur carriers by sea. We ought to
reip some benefit frt>m the hundreds
of millions expended on inland waterways,
proving our capacity to utilize
as well as expand. We ought to turn
the motor truck into a railway feeder
and distributor instead of a destroying
competitor.
It would be folly to ignore that wo
ii>r: ill n. inuiui age, x lie motor car
reflects our standard of living and
gauges the speed of our present day
life. It loing ago ran down simple
living and never halted to inquire
about the prostrate figure which fell
as its victim. With full recognition
of motor car transportation we must
turn it to the most practical use. It
cannot supersede the railway lines,
no matter how generously we afford
It highways out of the public treasury.
If freight traffic by motor were
charged with its proper and proportionate
share of highway construction,
we should find much of it wasteful
and more costly than like service by
rail. Yet we have paralleled the railways,
a most natural line of construction,
and thereby taken away from the
agency of expected service much of its
prontanie tramc, wnicn the taxpayers
have been providing the highways,
whose cost of maintenance is not yet
realized.
The Federal Government has a right
to inquire iwto the wisdom of this
policy because the national treasury
is contributing largely to this highway
construction. Costly highways
ought to be made to serve as feeders
rather than competitors of the rail- j
roods, and the motor truck should
become a coordinate factor in our !
great distributing system.
This transportation problem cannot
be waved aside. The .demand for lowered
costs on farm products and basic
materials cannot be ignored. Rates
horizontally Increased to meet increased
wage outlays during the war
inflation, are not easily reduced.
When some very moderate wage reductions
were effected last summer
there was a 5 per cent, horizontal reduction
in rates. I sought at that
time In a very informal way to have
the railway managers go before the
Interstate Commerce Commission and
agree to a heavier reduction on farm
products and coal and other basic
commofJltlos, and leave unchanged the
freight tariffs which a very large portion
of the traffic wa? able to bear.
Neither the managers nor the commission
paw fit to adopt the suggestion.
so we had the horizontal reduction
too slight to be felt by the higher
class cargoes and too little to benefit
the heavy tonnage calling most loudly
for relief.
Railways a?e not to he expected to
render the moat essential service In
our social organization without a fair
return on capital Invested, but the
Government has gone so far In the
regulation of rates and rules of operation
that It has the responsibility of
pointing the way to the reduced
freight costs so essential to our national
welfare.
Government operation does not afford
the cure. It was Government
operation which brought us to the
very order of things agnlnst which
we now rebel, and we are still liquidating
the coBts of that supreme
folly.
Surely the genius of the rnlhvay
builders has not become extinct
among the railway managers. New
economics, new efficiencies In cooperation
must be found. The fact that
labor takes f>0 to 60 per cent, of total
railway earnings makes limitations
within which to effect economies
very difficult, but the demand Is no
less Insistent on that account.
Clearly the managers are without
(he Intercarrler, cooperative relationship
so highly esentli^ to the best
and most economical operation. They
could not function In harmony when
the strike threatened the paralysis of
all railway transportation. The relationship
of tho service to public welfare,
so InlImately afrected by State
and Federal regulation, demands the
effective correlation and a concerted
drive to meet an Insistent and Justified
public demand.
The merger of lines Into systems,
a facilitated Interchange of freight
cars the economic use of terminals
and the consolidation of facilities are
suggested ways of economy and efficiency.
I remind you that Congress provided
a Joint commission of agricultural
inquiry which made an exhaustive
Investigation or car service
and transportation and unanimously
V YORK HERALD, S J
IF FOR.
recommended In Its report of October
15, 1921, the pooling of freight cars
under a central agency. This report
well deserves your serious consideration.
I think well of the central
agency, which shall be a creation of
the railways thomselves, to provide,
under the jurisdiction of the Interstate
Commerce Commission. the
means for financing equipment for
oarrlers which are otherwise unable
to provide their proportion of car
equipment adequate to transportation
needs. This same agency ought
to point the way to every possible
economy In maintained equipment and
the necessary interchanges In railway
commerce.
In a previous address to the Congress
I called to your attention the
iissufBclency of power to enforce the
decisions of the Railroad Labor
Board. Carriers have Ignored Its decisions
011 the one hand, railway workmen
have challenged Its decisions by
a strike on the other hand.
The Intent of Congress to establish
a tribunal to which railway labor and
managers may appeal respecting questions
of wages and working conditions
cannot be too strongly commended. It,,
i? vitally Important that some such
agency should be a guaranty against
suspended operations. The public
must be spared even tt? threat of
discontinued service.
Sponsoring the railroads, as we do,
it is an obligation that labor shall be
assured the highest justice and every
proper consideration of wage and
working conditions, but it is an equal
obligation to see that no concerted
action In forcing demands shall deprive
the public of the transportation
so essential to its very existence. It
is now impossible to safeguard public
interest, because the decrees of the
board are unenforceaoie against either
employer or employee. .
The labor board itself is not so constituted
as best to serve the public
interest With six partisan members
on a board of nine, three partisans
nominated by tlie employees and three
by the railway managers. It is inevitable
that tlie partisan viewpoint is
maintained throughout hearings and
jn decisions handed down. Indeed,
the few exceptions to a strictly partisan
expression in decisions thus far
rendered have been followed by
accusations of betrayal of the partisan
interests represented. Only the
public group of three is free to function
in unbiased decisions. Therefore,
the partisan membership may well be
abolished and decisions should be
made by an impartial tribunal.
I am well convinced that the functions
of this tribunal could be much
better carried on here in Washington.
Even were it to he continqed as a
separate tribunal there ought to be
contact with the Interstate Commerce
Commission, which has supreme authority
in the rate making to which
wage costs bears an Indissoluble
relationship.
Theoretically, a fair and living
wage must be determined quite apart
from the employer's earning capacity,
but in practice, in the railway service,
they are inseparable. The record of
advanced rates to meet increased
wages both determined by the government,
is proof enough.
The substitution of a labor division
in the Interstate Commerce Commission,
made up from its membership,
to hear and decide disputes relating
to wages and working conditions
which have failed of adjustment by
proper committees created by the railways
and their employees, offers a
more effective plan.
It need not be surprising that there
is dissatisfaction over delayed hearings
and decisions by the present board
when every trivial dispute is carried
to that tribunal. The law should require
the railroads and their employees
to Institute means and methods
to negotiate between themselves
their constantly arising differences.
llmltinc tr? th? /"IriVArn mftnt
tribunal to disputes of such character
as are likely to affect the public
welfare.
This suggested substitution will involve
a necessary Increase In the mombershlii
of the commission, probably
four, to constitute the labor division.
If the suggestion appeals to the Congress
it will be well to specify that the
labor division shall be constituted of
representatives of the four rate making
territories, thereby assuring a tribunal
conversant with the conditions
which obtain In the different rate
making sections of the country.
I wish 1 cculd bring to you the precise
recommendation for the prevention
of strikes, which threaten the
welfare of the people and menace public
safety. It Is an Important civilization
and an Inadequate Government
which lacks the genius and the courage
to guard against such a menace to
public welfare as wc experienced last
summer. **
You were aware of the Government's
great concern and Its futilo
attempt to aid In an adjustment. It
will reveal the Inexcusable obstinacy
which was responsible for so much
distress to the country to recall now
that, though all disputes are not yet
adjusted, the many settlements which
have been made, were on the terms
which the Government proposed in
mediation.
Public Interest demands that ample
power shall he conferred upon the
lahor tribunal nhoilmr tt la *>?**,?
ent board or the suggested substitute,
to require Its rulings to be accepted
by t>oth parties to a disputed question.
Let there be no confusion about the
purpose of the suggested conferment
of power to make decisions effective.
There can be no denial of constitutional
rights of either railway workmen
or railway managers.
No man can be denied his right to
labor when and how he chooses, or
cease to labor when he so elects, but,
since the Government assumes to safeguard
his Interests while employed in
an essential public service, the security
of society itHelf demands his retirement
from the service shall not he
so timed and rclaOd as to effect the
destruction of that service. This
vitally essential public transportation
service, demanding so much of brain
an/1 brawn, so much for efficiency and
security, ought to offer the most attractive
working conditions and the
highest of wages paid to workmen In
tn.v employment.
In essentially every branch, from
track repairer to the man Ht the locomotive
throttle, the railroad worker
Is responsible for the safety of human
lives and the care of vast property.
His high responsibility might well
rate high his pay within the limits
the traffic will beitr: but the same re- |
sponslbillty plus governmental protec- I
tlon, may Justly deny him and his associates
a withdrawal from service
without, a w-nlng or under circumstances
which involve the paralysis of
necessary transportation. We have |
assumed so great a responsibility In
necessary regulation that we unconsciously
have assumed the rcsponsl
nil I ty for maintained service; there- |
fore be lawful power for (he enforcement
of derision* Is necessary to sustaln
the majesty of government and to
administer to the public welfare'.
During Its longer session the present
Congress enacted a new tariff
law. The protection of the American
standards of living demanded the Insurance
It provides against the distorted
conditions of world commerce.
The framers of the law made provision
for a certain flexibility of customs
duties, whereby It is possible to
readju^ them as developing conditions
may require. The enactment haa Imposed
a large responsibility upon the
executive, but that responsibility will
bo discharged with a broad mindfulness
of the whole business situation.
VTURDAY, DECEMBER
FARMER
The provision Itself admits either the
posible fallibility of rates or their unsultableness
to changing conditions.
I believe the grant of authority may
be promptly and discreetly exercised,
ever mindful of the Intent and purpose
to safeguard American Industrial activity
and at the same lime prevent
the exploitation of the American consumer
and keep open the paths of
such liberal exchanges as do not endanger
o.ir own productivity.
No one contemplates commercial
aloofness nor any other aloofness contradictory
to the best American traditions
or loftiest human purposes. Our
fortunate capacity for comparative
self-containment affords the Arm foun- .
datlon on which to build our own
security and a like foundation on
which to build for a future of Influence
and importance In world commerce.
Our trade expansion must come of capacity
and of policies of righteousness
and reasonableness In all our commercial
relations.
Let no one assume that our provision
for maintained good fortune at
home and our unwillingness to assume
the correction of all the Ills of
the world means a reluctance to cooperate
with other peoples or to assume
every Just obligation to promote
human advancement anywhere In th*
world.
War made us a creditor nation. We
did not?seek an excess possession of
the worltfs gold, and we have neither
desire to profit unduly by Its possession
nor permanently retain It. We do
not seek to become an international
dictator because of its power.
The voice of the United States has
a respectful hearing in international
councils, because we have convinced
the world that we have no selfish ends
to serve, no old grievances to avenge,
no territorial or other greed to satisfy.
But the voice being heard Is that of
good counsel, not of dictation, it Is
the voice of sympathy and fraternity
and helpfulness, seeking to assist, but ,
not to lissome for the United States
(burdens which nations must bear for
themselves. "We would rejoice to help
rehabilitate currency systems and facilitate
all commerce which does not
drag us to the very levels of those we
seek to lift up.
While I have everlasting: faith in
our republic, it would be folly, Indeed,
to blind ourselves to our problems at
home. Abusing the hospitality of our
shores are the advocates of revolution,
finding their deluded followers among
those who take on tho habiliments of
an American without knowing an
American soul. There is the recrudescence
of hyphenated Americanism
which we thought to have been
stamped out when we committed the
Nation, life and soul, to the World
War.
There is a call to make the alien
respect our institutions while he accepts
our hospitality.. There is need
to magnify the American viewpoint to
the alien who seeks citizenship among
us. There is need to magnify the national
viewpoint to Americans throughout
the land. More, there is a demand
for every living being in the
United States to respect and abide by
the laws or the republic. L<et men
who are rendering the moral fibre of
the republic through easy contempt
for the prohibition law, because they
think it restricts their personal liberty,
remember that they set the example
and breed a contempt for law which
will ultimately destroy the republic.
Constitutional prohibition has been
adopted by the nation. It Is the supreme
law of the land. In plain
speaking, thire are conditions jointing
to its enforcement which savor of nationwide
scandal. It is the most demoralizing
factor in our public life.
Most of our people assumed that
the adoption of the Eighteenth
Amendment meant the elimination of
the question from our politics. On
the contrary, it has been so intensified
as an issue that many voters are
disposed to make all political decisions
with reference to this single question.
It Is distracting the public mind and
prejudicing the Judgment of the electorate.
The day Is unlikely to come when
the Eighteenth Amendment will be repealed.
The fact may as well be
eordlngly. If the statutory provisions
for its enforcement are contrary to deliberate
public opinion, which I do not
believe, the righteous and literal enforcement
will concentrate public attention
on any requisite modification.
Such a course conforms with the law
and saves the humiliation of the Government
and the humiliation of our
people before the world, and challenges
the destructive forces engaged
in widespread violation, official corruption
and Individual demoralization.
The Eighteenth Amendment involves
the concurrent authority of State and
Federal Governments for the enforcement
of the policy it defines. A certain
lack of deflniteness, through division
of responsibility, is thus introduced.
In order to bring about a full
understanding of duties and responslbiltes
as thus dstributed, I purpose to
Invite the Governors of the States and
Territories at an early opportunity to
a conference with the Federal executive
authority.
Out pf the full and free considerations
which will thus be possible, it
is confidently believed, will enrferge a
more adequate compschcnsion of tha
whole problem and definite policies of
national nnd State cooperation, in administering
the laws
There are pending bills for the registration
of the alien who has come to
our shores. I wish the passage of
such an act might be expedited. Life
amid American opportunities is worth
the cost of registration if it is wortn
the seeking, and the nation has the
right to know who are citizens In the
making or who live among us and
share our advantages while seeking to
undermine our cherished fnstltutbns.
This provision will enable us to guard
against the abuses in Immigration,
checking the undesirable whose irregular
coming Is his first violation of
our laws. More, It will facilitate the
needed Americanizing of those who
mean to enroll as fellow citizens.
Before enlarging the immigration
quotas we had better provide registration
for aliens, those now here or
continually pressing for admission,
and establish our examination hoards
abroad to make sure of desirables
only. By the examination abroad
we could end the pathos at our ports,
when men and women find our doors
closed, after long voyages and wasted
savings, because they are unfit for
admission. It would he kindlier and
safer to tell them before they embark.
Our program of admission and
treatment of Immigrants Is very Intimately
related to the educational
policy of the republic. With illiteracy
estimated at from two-tenths of 1 per
cent, to less than 2 per cent. In ten of
the foremost nations of Europe, It
rivets our attention to a serious problem,
wliui we are reminded of a A per
eent. Illiteracy In the United States.
The figures are based on the test,
which defines kn illiterate as one having
no schooling whntever. Remembering
the wide freedom of our public
schools, wKh compulsory attendance
in many States In the Union, one Is
convinced that much of our excessive
Illiteracy conies to us from abroad,
and the education of ^the Immigrant
becomes a requisite to his Americanization.
It must be done. If he Is fittingly
to exercise the duties, as well
as enjoy the privileges of American
citizenship. Here is revealed the special
field for Federal cooperation In
furthering education.
From the re ry beginning public
education has been left mainly In
the Lands of the States. So far as
schooling youth Is concerned the

policy has been Justified, because no 1
responsibility can be so effective as
that of the local community alive to <
its task. I believe In the cooperation
of the national authority to stimulate,
encourage and broaden the
work of the local authorities. But It
is the especial obligation of the Federal
Government to devise means and
effectively assist In the education of ,
the newcomer from foreign lands, so
that the level of American education
may be made the highest that is
humanly possible.
Closely related to this problem of
education is the abolition of child
labor. Twice Congress has attempted
the correction of the evils incident to ,
child employment.
The decision of the Supreme Court
has put this problem outside the proper
domain of Federal regulation until the
Constitution is so amended as to give
the Congress indubitable authority. I
recommend the submission of such an
amendment.
We have two schools of thought reluting
to amendment of the Constitution.
One need not be committed to
the belief that amendment is weakening
the fundamental law, or that ex- (
cessive amendment is essential to meet T
every ephemeral whim. We ought to
nmBnH tr. m.wf thft demands of the
people when sanctioned by deliberate
public opinion.
One year ago I suggested the submission
of an amendment so that we
may lawfully restrict the issues of
tax-exempt securities and I renew that
recommendation now. Tax-exempt
securities are drying up the sources of
Federal taxation and they are encouraging
unproductive and extravagant
expenditures by States and municipalities.
There is more thah the
menace in mounting public dfbt, there
iR the dissipation of capital which
should be made available to the needs
of productive industry.
The proposed amendment will place
the State and Federal Governments
and all political subdivisions 011 an exact
equality, and will correct the growing
menace of public borrowing which
if left unchecked may soon threaten
the stability of our Institutions.
We are so vast and so varied In our
national interests that scores of problems
aro pressing for attention. I
must not risk the wearying of your
patience with detailed.reference.
Reclamation and ltTigatlon projects,
where waste land may be made available
for settlement und productivity,
are worthy of your favorable consideration.
consuming our timber four times as (
rapidly as we are growing it, we must t
encourage, the greatest possible CO- t
operation between the Federal Govern- t
ment, the various States, and the own- f
ers of forest lands, to the end that
protection from Are shall be made
more effective and replanting encouraged.
The fuel problem Is under study
now by a very capable fact finding *
commission and any attempt to deal *
with the coal problem, of such deep f
concern to the entire nation, must r
await the report of the commission. r
There are necessary studies of great (
problems which Congress mlgdit well c
initiate. The wide spread between c
production costs and prices which con- f
sumers pay concerns every citizen of 1
the republic. It contributes very
largely to the unrest in agriculture
and must stand sponsor for much a
against which we inveigh in that fa- t
miliar term?the high cost of living. ^
No one doubts the excess Is trace- l
able to the levy of the middleman, a
but It would be unfair to charge him c
with nil responsibility before we ap- t

tacked the problem'on one side by the s
promotion of cooperative marketing, j
and we might well Inquire Into the ,
benefits of cooperative buying. H
Admittedly, the consumer Is much to e
blame himself, because of Ills prodigal r
expenditure and his exaction of service,
but government might well serve
t7? point the way of narrowing the
spread of price, especially between the '
production of food and its consump- 1

A super-power survey of the ICast- 1
ern Industrial region has recently been c
completed, looking to unification of *
steam, water and electric powers, and s
to a unified scheme of power dlstrlbu- t
tlon. The survey proved that vast ;
economies In tonnage movement of 1
freights, and in the efficiency of the 1:
railroads, would be effected If the t
super-power program were adopted. I j
am convinced that constructive meas- , r
ures calculated to promote such an r
t industrial development?I am tempted j
to say, such an Industrial revolution? t
would be well worthy the careful attention
and fostering Interest of the
national Government. ^
The proposed survey of a plan to 9
draft all the resources of the repub- tl
lie, human and material, for national s
ueiense may wen nave your approval. p
I commended such a program In case t,
of future war, In the inaugural ad- tj
dress of March 4, 1921, and every experience
in the adjustment and llqui- a
dation of war claims and the settle- ^
ment of war obligations persuades me ^
we ought to be prepared for such unl- '
versal call to armed defense. 1
I bring you no apprehension of war.
The world Is abhorrent of It, and our a
own relations are not only free from
every threatening cloud, but we have
contributed our larger Influence toward
making armed conflict less like- j
ly. Those who assume that we playetf '
our part In the world war and later r
took ourselves aloof and apart, un- 1
mindful of world obligations, give P
scant credit to the helpful part we
assume In International relationships.
Whether all nations signatory rat- <3
Ify all the treaties growing out of the '
Washington conference on limitation s
of armament or rtome withhold ap- e
proval, the underlying policy of limit- t
Ing naval armament has the eanctlon \
of the larger naval Powers, and naval I
competition Is suspended. Of course, t
unanimous ratification is much to be 0
desired. a
The four Power pact, which abol- v
Ishes every probability of a war on
the Pacific, hns Drought new confidence
In a maintained peace, and I
can wo|| believe It might be made a
model for like assurances wherever In p
the world any common Interests are "
concerned. J"
We have had expressed the hostll- '
lly of the American people to a super- e
government or to any commitment a
where either a council or an assembly 1
of leagued powers may chart our c
course. Treaties of armed alliance 11
can have no likelihood of American 1
sanction, but we bellevj) In respecting t'

EDITORIAL OPINION
OF HARDING SPEECH
\
This Morning's Newspapers
Discuss the Demands of
the President.
f '
POSITIVE' ONE COMMENT
Another Is That His Leadership
Will Be Tested in
Besponsc Made.
Following is some of the editorial |,
;omment of newspapers published this
norning on President Harding's meslage
to Congress:
New York Times?It is needless at
he moment to follow tlve President in
he wide field which he traverses. When
lis proposals get off paper into the
:oncrete, it will be time enough to delate
them. The general spirit of his
nessage is excellent. It may be a pity
iiat it cannot all be at once crystalized 1
nto_ the statute book, but no one knows 1
letter than he that it cannot be. Confess
will shower praise upon him for
lis commendable^suggestions; and then
vill perforce pass to the pressing busi- 1
less in hand.
New York World?His message to the
5ixty-seventh Congress in the final ees;lon
of Its discreditable career is quite
he best thins he has .ever done. It is 1
he sincere effort of a well meaning n.an i
o find his way out of this labyrinth and ]
o help the country find its way out. (
Plainly enough, the lesson of the November
election has not been lost on the (
'resident, and with the unsatisfactory
ools at his disposal he is (frying to blaze
b trail for his party. It is not a very
dear trail as yet, but It Is a trail, and j
here is little in his recommendations
hat can be construed as mere partlsanihip.
Some of them arc debatable for
his reason or for that reason, and some |
>f them are anything but sound po- ,
itically or economically ; but the Presllent
now seems to be out .from under
lie tutelage of the Old Guard, terrorized
hough he still may be by the roars and
hreats of the Irreconcilables. He is
eeling his way ahead, however, slowly
ind cautiously, but he Is going forward,
lot backward.
New York Tribune?President Harling's
second annual message to Contress
is full of far driving, constructive
mggestions. It deals with urgent donestlc
problems in the frankest and
nost practical way. It is not covered
>ver with the hard and slippery glaze
if vague political generalization. It Is
ourageculsy concrete?the strongest
ind bluntest which the President has so
ar delivered.
Baltimore American?The President's
iddress to Congress to-day carried the
>osltive and upstanding tone of a man
vho has a grip on his job, even though
t Is a most difficult and perplexing Job,
ma is resay 10 oner lur me aiiiicumos i
ertalri solutions or metnods of allevla- 1
Ion which he believes will commend
hcmselves to the sober thought of the
ountry. It Is a constructive speech,
lerlous, solemn Indeed In phrasing, but i
mbued, nevertheless, with a certain
-tigged optimism which regards ob- i
itacles merely as things to be climbed
?ver. The speech as a whole Is one to
nake Congress and the people think.
Philadelphia Inquirer?President Har- 1
lii^g thinks there Is need to begin with
he coordination of transportation fadlltles
and he asserts that "public lnerest
demands that ample1 power he '
onferred upon the labor tribunal
vhcther the present board or the suggested
substitute, to require Its rulings
o be accepted by both parties to a dls- j
>uted question." Of course he Is right
.. v....v, UV.V V..W ' > ..WW ..nw. j IV,
>e pushed at this session lor want ot
Ime, and he will have & cantankerous
ot of radicals on his hands when the
lext Congress convenes, with the ralload
labor leaders backing up La Fol- j
ette and the latter's bloc against anyhlng
of the aort.
Public Ledger?The measure of Mr.
lardlng s hold upon the Imagination, the i
ympathy, the Interest and attention of
he country will be reflected In the reponss
his words evoke. He offers a
rogram of subjects for debate and con- i
roversy. He tells of some things he 1
hlnks should be done, and for some of '
hem he offers a concrete proposal. The I
cceptance or neglect of the remedies i
e names will be a test of his leadership. 1
Ir. Harding has done his part, as well '
s within him lies. He has disclosed
imself. It is now for public opinion to
ccept or reject.

Pittsburgh Dispatch ? The President I
ioldly tackles the domestic problems of 1
he day In his message to Congress and 1
n the main with constructive recom- t
nendatlons. On the whole. It Is a prac- i
leal message worthy the thoughtful <
erusal of every citizen. I
t
Pittsburgh Post?With President Harllng's
generalities In his 8,000 word 1
ncssago to Congress on a number ot '
ubjccts there will, of course, be gen- 1
ral assent. What Is the main trouble <
nit a lack of thrilling leadership at
Vashlngton? Again and again the !
'resident has been applauded as saying '
he right word, but neither he nor any
f his partisans, In Congress has been '
ble to get that body to respond In a 1
lgorous and helpful manner.
Cleveland Plain Dealer?Practically ''
very Important question that has occu- '
iM the minds of Americans In recent 1
lonths finds a place In the message
rhleh President Harding delivered to '
'ongrces In person. The Kxecutlve
vades nothing, equivocates not at all
.nd discusses matters In plain language.
^ any of the several blocs In Congress .
all this or that proposal treason, let It ,
lake the most of it?as It will. Mr. .
larding gives his colleagues plenty to
hlnk about and the present session will (
ot hear the end of them. j
Insistent on American rights wherever
they may be questioned, and deny no
rights of others In the association of
our own. Moreover, we are cognisant
of the world's struggles for full readjustment
and rehabilitation, and we
have shirked no duty which comes of
sympathy, or fraternity, or highest
fellowship among nations.
Every obligation consonant with
American Ideals and sanctioned under
our form of Government Is wl.llngly
met. When we cannot support we do
not demand. Our Constitutional limitations
do not forbid the exercise of a
mornl Influence, the measure of which 1
Is not less than the high purposes we
have sought to serve.
After all there Is leas difference
about the part this great republic
shall play In furthering peace and advancing
humanity than In the manner
of playing It. We ask no one to
assume responsibility for us; we assume
no responsibility which others
must bear for themselves, unle** nationality
Is hopelessly swallowed up
In Internationalism.

Withhincton. D. Itec. 8. (
Congressional comment on the President's
address was unexpectedly favor
iioie. several uemocrats, as wen as ino
majority of Republican Senators and
Representatives, expressed approval of
ills suggestions relating to agricultural,
prohibition, railway, labor and foreign
problems.
Opinion was pronounced, however, that
new legislation designed to meet the conditions
described by the President could,,
not be considered at the short Congress,
but would have to await the attention of
tho new Congress next December.
Senators and Representatives of an insurgent
or radical'turn of mind regarded
in extra session to consider the problems
unavoidable. The present attltudn
jf the President is not favorable to an
>xtra .session for any purpose.
Capper Kails Farm Flan.
Some of the opinions expressed by
Senators and Representatives regarding
:he President's message follow:
Senator Capper (Kan.), leader of tha'
farm bloc: "The President presented in
a very strong way the needs of tha
rarmp.ru nf tha na t inn anrf ausrerantOfl
sral excellent ways to grant them relief.
At last the Administration seems to bo
awakening to the fact that the farmer Is
a very vital element In our national llfo
and that the Government Is in a position
Lo materially aid him In solving some of
Iris intricate problems. We hope that
the present Congress will enact lpto
legislation the rural credit plan as outlined
by the President In his message.
Dther measures of relief will come along
,n due time."
Senator Willis (Rep., Ohio), leader of
the dry forces In the Senate: "I was
much gratified over the comments by
the President upon the prohibition question.
The President had courageously
grappled with one of the big problems
:onfrontlng the country. His appeal to
he people to stand by the Federal laws
rnd uphold the Constitution undoubtedly
will have a most beneficial effect.
His proposal to hold a conference with
the Governors of the States over plans
'or stricter enforcement of the prohibition
law will undoubtedly lead tcr good
results*" i
Calder Calls Address Masterly.
Senutor Calder (Rep., N. Y.) : "It is
one of the most masterly and statesmanlike
messages ever presented to
Congress. His proposals for the solution
of manv of our nomlprlnB- nattontl
problems deserve and will undoubtedly
receive serious consideration _ by the
Congress. His suggestions to prevent
strikes through the modification of the
Railway Labor Board personnel struck
me as worthy of the serious thought.
I am also impressed by his remarks
on ways and means to solve our Immigration
problem."
Senator Fletcher (Dem., Fia.): "I
think the President's message was a
strong presentation of some of the
many perplexing problems confronting
the nation. It was especially forceful
in dealing with agricultural questions.
However. I am strongly opposed to
the suggestion of tax securities now
free from taxation."
Senator Pomerene (Dem., Ohio): "It
s a very strong message."
Senator Curtis (Rep., Kan.): "I think
It is a very strong message and I
hope Congress will proceed as soon as
possible to enact Into law his timely
suggestions."
Senator Weller (Rep., Md.): "It Impressed
me very favorably. The
President made some very admirable
suggestions. I don't know whether the
legislative jam will enable us to pjit
them Into effect. But it clarified tho
situation in the country. Of course, the
ship subsidy and the appropriations
will occcupy most of our attention la
this Congress."
Donbta It Remedlea Arc Given.
Senator If orris (Rep., Neb.): "The
Presidents message was beautiful. lie
told us a good many things. I doubt It
le suggested any remedies That was
particularly true of the transportation
iltuatlon. He very truthfully said that
atlroad rates are too high and must
orne down. That's absolutely true, but
he President did not tell us how It Is
:o be done."
Henator New (Rep., Ind.): "It was a
rery strong message. The recommenda:lons
were to the point and excellent.
It was one. of the best the President has X
sver written."
Henator Watson fRep., Ind.): "It was
:he best message President Harding has
ver delivered."
Henator MeNnrjr (liep., Ore): It
vas particularly pleased with what the
President had to say on agricultural
redlt and on transportation." ?
Henator Polndexter (Wash.): "It was
l great message. It was comprehensive
ind responsive to the needs of the
nation."
Henator Underwood (Ala.), the Demicratlc
floor leader^ "I would not like
,o express an offhand opinion about the
message. I might discuss It later. Thero
ire some things In It which I approve
ind some 1 do not. Of course, there Is
no chance at this session to consider
many of the things suggested. We may
jet to rural credits legislation."
Henator Simmons, ranking Democrat
>f the Finance Committee: "An exeelcnt
piece of wrttlng; the hest the
President has delivered, but I cannot
ipprove of all of It." The rural credits
cglslatlon suggested, lie said, did not
to far enough and amounted merely to
in elaboration of the farm loan legls
atlon. whereas the farmer needed a
nore clastic loan system than tho
larding program seemed to carry.
Keriinry Indorses Meaanae.
Representative Fordney (Hep., Mlch.)<
hairman of the Ways and Means Com?

nessagc I've heard. I agree that
