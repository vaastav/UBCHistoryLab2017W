THE PBESIDBSTT AM) THE INSl-t
GEN.TS.
Now nnd thon George Balley, nf the
Houston Post" has Iticld mohierits. We
wish he hud more of them; for, ln
pplte ?f Irreverence; he really can (lo
good vork. Hear him:
-lt ls s.ild thal ^resldent Taft hn.
_xtended the ollVe branch to some of
the refractory Senators of his party.
If he would take our vlew he would
use a bludereon wlth spikes ln lt on
these rellows."
Prestdenl Taft was probably broug.it
up on Webs'ter's old Bluo Back Spell
lng Book. and he wlll remember tho
Btory told ln it. aboiil thr old man who
tried persuaslon upon thc boys who
were robblng hls applo orchard, and
finding that Bofl worda would nol
affect them ln thelr course, ho knock
ed them out of thc tree wlth stones
?which lay convenlently al hand. There
havo been a good maViy reports from
Washlngton ahout how the President
lia. been "snuggllng up" t<> the [n
surgents. how lic has callr.l them Into
counsel nnd begged their parclon and
hoped that they would forglve htm,
and all thal; btit if he has done any of
these things. and we doubt it very
much, ho nas made a thistake. Tho
club ls not a very attractlve weapon
to carry around wlth one. It is awK
ivarrt nnd heavy, and cannot be con
cealed, thore ls no place to put it when
one wants to slt down and no placo
;o carry It convejB_*fitiy whon one
wishes to .and up, and we should pro
fer the stiletto to the stlck. It means
a great deal closer .llghtlng, but at
'the same time it means more cffectlve
iightlng, and that is better than bat
trring up ono'a adversary or being
battered up in turn.
.Mr. Taft wlll not he able to make
anything out of the crowd who have
been antagonlzlns him, we mean the
crowd wltnin his own party; people
who are fortunately on tho outside
have the right to antagonlze him, and
lt is thelr duty to antagonlze him; not
pr-rsonally, of course, for ho Is _ very
lovable man, but because of hls poll
tlcs and the party of whicli he is the
head and front. If ho should make n
'treaty of peace wlth tho traltors in
the ranks of hls own party, ho,could
have no assurance that they would not
break the terms of the agreement. Tho
thing, therefore, for hfm to do ls to
Tteep hls head, to follow hls own Judg
ment. to do what he thinks ls right,
and, God helping him, to stand.

SWKI,I,I.\G TIIR FlINU,
Tiir Is.ties of tho CPngrcsBidnul tie
conl for Monday and Tuesday wero
recelved yesterday by thouaand- of
people in every parl of the natlon.
Thero are no Interesting speechcs ln
theB. pagos, hut n, rnndntu perusal of
tho llst Of bills introduced-wlll reveal
the fact thnt ahout l.fiOO new penslon
bills wero presented in thc lirst two
dnys' sesslon. Most of those nre for In?
creases in pcnslons, whlle some are
for new pcnslons and others are to
"eorrect lhe record',1 as to certain 'sol?
diers or near-soldlera or nevcr-wera
Boldlors,
At thls rate, there will be many
thousand penslon bills before Con?
gress nt even thls short sesslon. Tho
enormous riuahtfty of these hllla wlll
afford little opportunity for propor in?
spectlon oC thc merlts and dcmcrlts of
these claims and wlll allow but little
effort In the way of detectlon of fraud.
The penslon inill goos grinding on,
waatlng the public money at every
step, pourlng v.ealth Into the grasp
ing bands of thoso who have no just
cialm ln law and fact to reward.
Take, for lnstance, the bills to "eor?
rect tlie record." That ls a short eut
tci graft. The pretended soldler or
tlie ex-honie guard gets In i>y this
route to plunder and pillage tlie trea?
sury. The Offlciai records do not men?
tlon them, but they gathcr evldence of
a doubtful or spurlous riature, use lt as
0 lever by whieh to prize open a place
for them in the olflclal reeortls, and are
enr'olled as regular soldiers.
The genuine veterans are passlng
rapitlly; President Taft in the message
which he sent to Congress on Monday
declared that old soldiers are dylng at
lhe rate of 3,000 the month, and point?
ed oui that. tlie rate of deaths ls in?
creaslng inevit.ilily ns tlmo paSSOS.
Novorthelcss, after forly-livc years of
I sllence and Inactlvlty, new names are
! being added to the peusion rolls, re
mlndlng as very much of that wiso
saylng Of Dr. .lohnson, "..itriotism is
lhe last refuge of a BC'oundrel."
One of thc be3t things that Presl
tlent Tafl said In his mOssago was:
"Care should bo exerclsed nol to go
to abBurd lengths (in the matter of
1 pcnslons), or dlstribute the bounty of
tho GTovernment to classes of persons
j who may. at thla late day, from a mer
cenary motive. seek to obtaln somo le?
gal relatlon wlth an old veteran now
tottdring nn tho brlnk of tho gra.v< "
Thls utterance did not go to the
root of tho matter, nor did it touch
upon the most Iniqultoua featuros <>f
the penslon system, but lt recalled to
the Amerlcan public that many schem
ing young womeii and women of mld
dle age are mairylng these veterans
wlth an eye slnglc to sccurlng a
wldow's penslon for tiio probably long
remalnder of their lives when their
htlsbands havo died. Such a relatlon
is hardly lnatrlmonial, ln fact, in many
cases tlie relatlon ls not one formally
recoghl.ed by thp law or by rellglon.
Thla glgantlc fraud lakes man;
forms nnil ramlficatlons' It ought to
be Investlgated, and it ls lo l>e hoped
that Congress will look Into lhe mat?
ter thoroughly and ordor lt Investl?
gated from top to bottom. The Gov?
ernment In thls matter ls carrylng- pa
ternallsm too far. Bloro and more
"penslon" is becomlrtg a synonyrn for
graf! and for theft in tho guise of
patriotism.
A GltEAT WORLD POWER NOW.
In nollng tho death of il. H. Iirock
way, lhe last of tho old-tlmeNew York
landlords, tho Waterbury American
says very trulj : "The identlty of tho
proprlotor is no longer important in
the New York hotel. Onyx columns
and sklll in BWeetbreada sons cloche
eontrlbute much more' offoctlvoly to
tho saUsfac'tlbn of patrons, The only
personaitttea which count are those of
the headwalter and tho hartendcr."
But our Waterbury friond forgets
that we aro a natlon now, a great
World Power, lilled with aspirations
Whlch, In tho clrcumstancos, we can?
not aelileve, but a World Power Just
j the same. Wlth tho prlmltlvo virtues

not like that.nt all, and espeelally as

TIIE VALUE OF CIUOUMSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE.
Just a llttlo while ago a man In the
Ohtii penltentiary was convlcted of
murder and aontonced to die on Decem?
bor 81. Thero was a strong chaln ot'
clrcumstantlal evidence against the
man. The prosecutlng attorney evl
dently belleved that the man was gullty
aud convlnced the jury', apparently, that
he was. Tho judge, ln proriounclng tho
death senlencp, must have felt that
justice was being dealt out. The jury
must havo thought that it hnd found
the Iruth, even giving to tho prlsoner
the bo'ni ilt of ull doubts ln tho case.
The -'oiimiunity perhaps thought that
Justice had boen done.
lt now has come to llght that the
man eondemned to death Is lnnocent.
The real murderer has confessed. llo'
owned up lust iu time to save tho liro
of tho eondemned man, Confosslon ia

Tho duty of a Bchool teacher ls to

If the parents of children wlsh to

Is another matter; but It is n matter
wlth Whleh thc teachers have nothing

RETAIN COCK1M-I.I..
The Baltlmore Sun dlrects attention
to the fact that the term of Ex-Senator
Francls Marlon Cockrcll as member of
the Interstate Commerce Commlsslon
Is about to end. Ther.- are nimors
that he wlll not be roappolnted. Ile is
no longer a young man, but Ia us llt
for the position aB any man that can
bo obtalned.
He has already served live years on
tho Commlsslon. Ther. is no doubt
that he has shown rare quallflcatlohs
for thc ofilce. Ho has heard the ovl?
denco iu the important Invcstigatlons
and cases now nwaitlng declslon. A
rare comprohenslon and understanding
of great and vltal questlons has been
dlsplayed by Commlssloner Cockrcll ln
thc work of the Commission for the
last llve years, ln which work hc has
done hls full share. %
A btlgadler-general ln the Confeder?
ate army, Commlssloner Cockroll be?
gan hls servlce in the Unlted States
Senate in 1875. For thirty years ho
was a member of tho higher branch of
lhe Natlonal Legislaturo. Of the high?
est ability and charaeter, he has made
hls work faultless. He ls fair, judl
clal and honost. The only thing
brought ngulnst him ls his age. It ls
certain that that has not Ineapaoitated
him, and his long experlence and ad
mltted ability entltle. him to be con?
tlnued ln office. Ho has had long traln?
ing, ho has rendcred elllclent servlce,
and he is stlll able to render it. The
reappolntment of Commissioner Cock?
rcll ls to be desired.
THE OAS WOHKS SITUATION.
Tho Times-Dispatch has nelther
charged nor assorted that there has
boen an exploslon at the Gas Works.
Thls pajper has sought to prlnt only tho
truth, and has had no Idea of Injurlng
any person or undortaking.
Jt ls well known that on the floor ot
the Common Councll on Monday night
members of the Councll Committee on
l.ight declared that there had been an
exploslon at thc Gaa Works. On tho
.strength of these statements, over tho|
protest of Mr. i-'uller, of the Flnance
Committee, who desired more Informn
tlon, the Council approved flve resolu?
tlons allowing payment to employes
of the Gas Works for tlme lost from
work whlle injured. It appears that
the Councll voted for the llve resolu?
tlons with thc distlnct understanding
lhat there hud been one explosioti
"some tlme in October." One member
of the commlttee descrlbed this ocour
ren'co as "a dareback" or "buckdruft."
On the morning after the action ot
the Council, whicli is a- matter of rec?
ord, was reported in thls paper, Super?
intendent Knowles, of the Gas AVorks,
who was not present at tho Councll
meeting, by the way, vehemently denled
that there hud been any accldent at
the works and "demantled a retractlon."
He asserted that tho report of the
Councll commlttee was injurious lo him
and to the work conducted under hls
direction
Tho Times-Dispatch slmply prlntcd
tlie proceedings uf .tho Councll com?
mlttee. lt reported what was said, and
no more. The statement as to the accl?
dent was generally accepted by the
Council, there was no tlenlal entered
at tlie time, and thls paper slmply re
peated tlu- romarks inndo in meeting.
It now app ars, according to the com?
mittee records, that there were, as lirst
mado known in this paper, flve sepa?
rate aud Indopondent accldents. In?
stead ot happeuing practlcally stmul
laneously, the accldents took place at
dlfferent tlmes und in dilt'erent ways,
Members of the l.lglu. Committee' who
havo slnce looked Into the matter as
sert that tlte claims are all moritorious
-uid should be paid.
The facts that stlll stand out clearly
are that the Councll voted for tho llve
resolutlons under the lmpresalon that
there was but one accident. Also, Su
perlntondont Knowles has not wltli
drawn hla posUlvti dc-nlal that there
v. ,i- aity accldent, nor has hc with
di'awn hla donunclation nt tho prlntcd
rep H'i ot ia,- Common Council.
Tli ? oniv lesaon 10 bo dcrlved from

Tho current Christlan Entloavor

nuch more powerful one ln a phyaieal

CHRISTMAS TREE
IS OF IRISH ORIGIN
lll I.I MUUU l-i: DE FOVrKXOY.
VEKMONT'a proposal to tax the
Chrlatniaa tree, wlth the objeci
->t piacliig sfome chcck upon tho
? \-i---i-. ? cuttlng oi young
frees and saplings which takes
pla;e every year in order to sattsfy
the demand for Christmas trces at
iTuletide, servcs to rccall that thc
Christmas tree, ln co far as its rela
tlon to Christianlty is concerned, ls
distinctly of Irish orlgin.
It was the lllbemlan Salnt Columba
nus (ho must not bc cohfounded wlth
Saint Columba) who when engaged ln
convertlng thc- pagnns of Germany and
Swltzerland t-> Christianlty, found them
so flrtnly linnucd with tlie sacred
character of trees, espeelally of llr
trees, that despalrlng of being able
to -indlcate the cult from their mlnds,
he and hls fellow mlssloniiries con
celved the Idea of endowing it wlth a
Christlan meanlng.
Already ln tho scventh century the.
flr tree began to flguro in Christlan
writings, pTctures nnd carvlngs, as a
symbol ot otcrnal llfe-, wlth Its poren
nlal verdure and Its brllllant llghts;
whlle popular legends dating from that
epoch, represc-nt thc old inun who at
Christmas vlslts each nbode, he lt pal?
ace or hut, to grant the prayer.* and
wlshos of tlie lnmatos, as bearing a
flr tree abluze wlth candles. As tho
chlldren yearned for toys. it was only
natural thut tbe tree ol good Father
Christmas should be hurig wlth gifts;,
and thus we have the Christmas trco
of to-day.
Throughout thc middlc ages, and
untll comparatlvely modern tlmes, the
Christmas tree remalned restrlcted to
Germany, Swltsserland and ScandinavlH
Thus; iu Austrla-Hungary, It only mado
Its- iirst appearance ln 1816, when
Grand Duohess Henrletta, tho Ocrnian
consorl. of Archduke Charles. set up
a monster llr tree, all ablaze wlth
llghts, and londcd wlth costly pres
enta for her young chlldren, who had
nev-..-r aeen anythlng of the kind be?
fore. Tlie ctiatpm <|iiickly spread from
her palace at Vleniui throughout the
Dual Emplre, and 16-ila.y there Is no
liouse, and not even any peasant
dwelilng in tho lonely Alplne distrlct,
whero llie Christmas tree ls not to
be found on Christmas Day. In Eng?
land. the Christmas tree was Introduced
from Uormany by Prlnce Albert, the
Touton consort of Queen Victorla.
it was Queen Dowager Chrlstlna
who tirst set up the Christmas tree ln
Madrld for her chlldren; while ln
France the Christmas tree may be sald
to have been introduced by the expa
triated Inhabltants of Alsaco aiul Eor
raine, aftor tho soizuro of those prov
incos by tho Gcrinans, at the close of
the war of 1870. It was determlncd in
Paris to give the chlldreh of the exiles
a Christmas as much as possible like
Uiat to which they had beon accus
tomijd In their homes on tho othor nlde
of tho Vosges. Tiie eharitable as?
soclatlons organlzed for the rollcf of
the lugltlves, took up tho matter, and
erected enormous Christmas trees,"lond?
cd wlth gll'ts, for the youngsters, at
the Hlppodrome. The Parlslans name
and saw the trees, and were dellghted
with the idea, and now tlio Christmas
tree is almost as unlversal in France as
it ts ln Germany, ln Austrlu, ln Eng?
land and ln this country, into 'whleh
it was Introduced by thc German set
tlers at the closo of tho olghtoenth
century and ln tho lirst half of the
nlneteenth.
