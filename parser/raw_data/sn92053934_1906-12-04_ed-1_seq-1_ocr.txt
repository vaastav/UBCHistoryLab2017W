GOES INTO COURTS
Claim of the State of Illinois for
Back Taxes From the
Central.
COMPROMISE IS ILLEGAL
Governor Deneen Holds Conference
With Attorney General With
View to Early Action.
Springfield, II?., Dec. 4. The state's
claim for back taxes against the Illi
nois Central Railroad company will be
settled in the courts. This fact came
out yesterday when Governor Deneen
held a conference with Attorney Gen
eral Stead and the experts who have
becu-working on the company's books.
When the suit will be filed cannot be
told, as the investigation has 3iist be-
un. .
This announcement . discredits stor
ies sent out from NewYork tnat the
amount claimed by the. grate is .$3,000,
0(H) and that a compromise is certain.
It has developed that the experts are
still working, on the passenger books,
and definite figures will not be secur
ed for some time. When they are sub
mitted they will be applied to the
state's construction of the law, which
means a greater loss of time.
('nil Ilr o ('iiiroiiiitte.
A provision of the statute has been
found which prohibits the legislature
and state officials from altering, re
mitting, or in any way diminishing or
impairing state claims. When Gov
ernor Deneen made his last trip to
New York, staff correspondents sent
stones to the effect that the matter
had been referred to a special commit
tee of. the Central directors, and it
was generally believed a compromise
would be made. When the governor
returned to Springfield he said the
amount ' due. the state was not dis
cussed.
So in promise 1'omnIMc.
When the experts and attorney gen
eral met with the governor yesterday
afternoon it was given out that all
stories regarding a compromise were
groundless, as the statute forbids such
action. The constitution of IS 70, which
appears to have been overlooked by
politicians and others who have been
forecasting a compromise, covers the
Illinois Central case to the letter.

Heretofore, the committee had been
polled on the floor of the senate in

METCALF SEES HO
HOPE FOR THE JAPS
Said to Have Told Frisco School Doard
It Has Acted Within Its
Rights.
San Francisco. Dec. I. School Ii
rector I). H. Oliver stales that Secre
tary Metcalf before his departure for
Washington told the school directors
he believed they were clearly within
their rights in establishing a separate
school for Japanese; pupils, according
to a local newspaper. This would tend
to correct the impression that S-eie-tary
Metcalf had decided to favor the
Japanese in his report te the president .
The secretary's report, it may be as
sumed, will conform to his assurance
tf) the school board. Attorneys versed
in international law believe the treaty
between Japan and America in no way
ceivers the points at issue and the best
that the United States can eio for thn
island empire is to institute a test ease
in the federal courts, as has always
been done.
