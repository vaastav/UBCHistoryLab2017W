The solution of the Roberts case report
ed to hive been reached by the gentlemen
in charge of the matter is evidence of re
turning reason on the part of the House of
Rcprescntatites. It Is now understood that
the Mormon Representative-elect is to be
allowed to take the oath of office and oc
cupy his seat, after which it will be com
petent and perhaps appropriate to expel
him. As the facts stand he is as much
entitled to his seat as Messrs.
Henderson and Richardson are to
theirs. The regularity of his credentials
and of his election is not questioned, and
there is no proof of record that he is not
a citizen of the United States of legal tige.
I)y admitting Roberts and taking the
chances of a tote to expel him later, the
House will avoid the establishment of a
vicious and dangerous precedent. It may
even be said that it will restrain itself from
the commission of a flagrant offence
against our free institutions.
Of late there has been altogether too
much of a tendency in political circles,
particularly among Republicans, to treat
the views, designs, and interests of the
party in power and the Administrate
itpresentlng it as matters of such supe
rior authority that the Constitution and
lams of the country are to be ignored,
etaded, or violated nhencter any one
of these things may be necessary to ac
complish a purpose deemed vital by the
syndicated leaders ofthe Republican or
ganization. This tendency has bred the
disregard for law- illustrated in the sup
pression of. the House of Representatives
by Thomas B. Ueeil, and many acts of ex
ecutle department heads so openly defi
ant of law and decency, that it is Impos
sible to believe they v.oulJ have been at
tempted if the perpetrators had not feit
convinced that all laws and regulations
had been suspended by tacit agreement be
tween the Administration and Congress in
caes where they might prove defeasive of
party ends.
The Sampson scandal furnishes sinister
11 lUCJiLC ui iuc jfictuicuit; ui iiiia luca
among officers of the Administration. In
direct contravention of law this naval cap
tain was given rani; and title which neither
the I'resident nor the Secretary of the
Navy had any statutory power to confer,
and was placed, or rather illegally attempt
ed to be placed, in command over his supe
rior effleer. The facts are entirely clear.
They cannot be denied, and yet in spite of
them the departmental functionaries re
sponsible for such an unblushing assault
upon the rights, honor, and discipline of
the service, go on In contempt of the legis
lative branch of the Government, Insisting
that tbeir creature Sampson shall bs
treated, and receive the bull: of the Santi
ago prize money, not only as if be had been
within a dozen miles of the battle, but as
if his assumption of command over the
legal commander-in-chief of the North
Atlantic Squadron, had been a possibility.
As we have said, defiance of our Consti
tution and laws has become too much a
habit among officials of a certain type, not
to be regarded as an evil demanding drastic
treatment at the hands of our law givers
Certainly they should not help to spread it,
by doing an unlawful thing themselves. If
party necessity or convenience be permit
ted to appear as a higher law, in the pres
ence of which the Constitution and the
Statutes must be looked upon as Inopera
tive, by and by it may come to pass that
any wave of popular passion will be suffi
cient to override all constitutional and
legal principles and forms.
Wc are quite ready to grant the proba
bility that nrigham H. Roberts Is a man
entirely unfit to sit as a Member of Con
gress, and that he ought to be expelled.
But he is entitled to a hearing and a vote
on the proposition to expel him. He Is
charged with being a polygamist. and po
lygamy Is a crime against American civ
ilization, while it is not a crime against
the Constitution. As a question of abstract
justice, considering all the circumstances
of the case, there may perhaps be some
doubt as towhether or noi the pain of ex
pulsion should be inflicted in this case; but
there can be none at all that the House
of Representatives has an unquestionable
right to decide whether a given man Is fit
or Is unfit to sit In its halls as a legisla
tor. Doubtless It will conclude that Rob
erts Is unfit, and that will be the end of
the matter as far as he Is concerned. All
the same, no time should be lost in pro
posing an amendment to the Constitution"
which shall render impossible the recur
rence of such a situation. '

On recount of the" circumstantiality of
the stories concemlug the alleged action
nf the British Lancers at Elaudslaagte,
who aie said to have speared a lot of
Boers after they had surrendered, it is to
be feared that there is a basfs of truth in
the report. At the same time. It would be
wrong to Jump to hstty conclusions in the
"scatter.
Our despatches slate that sundry troop
ers In the regiment havo written letters
home which seem to iudicate that orders
were given to the Lancers not to show
quarter. Now we ere not prepared to be
lieve this without coroboration, yet,, bad
and inhuman as it would seem if true, it
Is possible that it happened as claimed by
the t riters of the letters referred to, and
that it was Justified by some antecedent
violation of the rules ot war by the Boers.
Such a sufficient excuse misht exist and
the troops Immediately involved be quite
Ignorant of it.
Ye all remember that Just after forcing
the war upon Great Britain, President
Kruger declared that it would be of a na
ture to make civilization turn pale. There
are good reasons for fearing that this was
not an Idle threat, and that his subordi
nates are doing their best to make it good.
Time and agajn Boer officers have raised
the white flag for no other purpose than to
get the British opposed to them to show
themselves, when a treacherous volley
would sweep their ranks. Indeed there is
some evidence to prove that these tactics
were deliberately adopted and ordered by a
council of war at Pretoria, two weeks be
fore the outbreak of hostilities. If, for ex
amp!?, the commando afterward charged by
the Lsnccrs, bed srly lu the battle com
mitted the perfidy allud:d to, the laws of
war would Justify the force which over
came them in refusing to grant quarter. Of
course :hls is hard, but it s war, and Gen.
eral Sherman has said that "uar is hell.'
To refuse quarter is no worse then to shoot
cr.eiuifs from under th: protection of the
white flag.
It is all very sad, this descent cf a
struggle between two nominally Christian
people to the plane of a fight between
savage tribes: but it begins to look as if
the war in South Africa was fast coming
to Just that. Schalkburger at Ladysmith.
and the Boer generals In front of Mafe
klng and Kimberley delight in making ar
tillery targets of the British hospitals,
notwithstanding almost dally protests
from the garrison commanders Such
conduct is uncivilized, and so repugnant
to the principles of honorable warfare that
It operates to deprive the responsible perpe
trators of protection as prisoners of wrr,
in case they- should chance to be captured.
While General Joubert was In unchal
lenged control of the Transvaal and Free
State forces, there was some attempt to
observe the laws of war. Hut it is re
ported that his humanity enraged his col
leagues, and that he has been shorn of
much of his original power. If that be so,
it is to be apprehended that atrocities on
one side and retaliation on the other will
make the present campaign much vhat
Kruger threatened it would !).

. The decision of the Kentucky Election
Commission granting the crtiflcate to the
Republican candidate for Governor is prob
ably Just. Taylor had a sufficient plurality
on the face of the returns, and though all
sorts of fraudulent practices were undoubt
edly resorted to on both sides on election
day, it Is most likely that this plurality
represents the popular will.
Outside of its effect on local conditions
we do not think that the Republican tri
umph amounts to much. Kentucky will
have a Republican Governor for four years
or so; but there is little doubt that her
electoral vote next fall will be cast for the
Democratic Presidential nominee.

Interest In that part of the President's
message which refers to our relations, or,
rather, our differences, with Great Britain,
is revived by the report that Her Majesty's
Government is evincing a disposition to
seize the Galapagos Islands, belonging
nominally to Ecuador, and which consti
tute a strong strategic naval position com
manding the Pacific approach to the pro
jected American translsthmlan canal. It
Is understood mat the movement referred
to is suggested by the probability that the
United States will shortly give formal
notice cf its understanding that the riay-ton-Bulwcr
treaty has been abrogated and
is null and void in consequence cf its vio
lation and abandonment by Great Britain
shortly"after its ratification a fact already
notorious everywhere save possibly in the
British Foreign Ofllce.
England, Germany, and France have
each been bidders for the Galapagos Isl
ands, but Germany is satisfied with
her position in the Sanioan group and has
dropped out. The others are still in the
market, but neither of them will be allowed
to acquire the property. Such a transac
tion would not only overthrow the -Monroe
doctrine, but, what is more important, it
would menace the exclusive control of the
Nicaragua Canal by the United Slates,
something friend and foe alike may as
well understand this country will not for
a moment tolerate while it possesses the
power to find money and fight.
As remarked above, this Galapagos Irri
tation renews national interest in what
Mr. McKlnley's messagj had to say con
cerning points at issue with our British
datives, and particularly In connection
with the Joint High Commissioj anJ the
Alaskan boundary question. On the latter
it must be remarked that Mr. McKinley
was perhaps discreetly non-ecmmlttal.
Rather than afford fresh ground for dis
cord he seems to have ignored a rather
significant point In the connection. In
short, he omits to recall the fact that, when
the Joint High Commission was estab
lished, there was no Alaskan boundary
question, and that it was not raised by
the British Government until some time
after the first meeting of the Commission
at Halifax. Up to that time Great Britain
had continued to recognize the Anglo-Russian
delimitation of 1823, as It had done
continuously throughout all the Interven
ing years.
We need not now go into the details of
the strange, baseless, and affronting posi
tion In this matter, assumed by Canada,
apparently backed by the British Foreign
Office. We are in the throes of an era of
good feeling, and should desire to think
the best we can of cousins who were good
to us during the Spanish war; to whom
in return we are good now; and with
wnom we have common interests in the
Orient. Perhaps the President knew what
he was not talking about when he said. In
effect, that our negotiations were pro
gressing with such promise that when they
should be concluded to the entire satis
faction of both parties, each would be
pleased. But the reticence and diplomatic
circumlocution necessarily imposed upon
the White House for state reasons Is aot
mandatory on the press, and we may be
permitted lo say that, although the Ca
nadian claims have not beep abated, al
though Mr. -Chamberlain still poses as ap
proving them, they will never be admitted
cither in fact or in principle. As a leading
Senator remarked yesterday, the Alaskan
situation is quite favorable to our rights,
and to the Integrity ot our boundary lines.
We are in possession. We shall not be
dispossessed with our consent, or without
war, and war is not likely to be forced
upon us by Great Britain in prosecution
of a claim that would not hold for a mo
ment In a tribal court of the Digger In
dians, or of the Voudoo cannibals, of Haiti.
The men who assisted Hobson to sink
the Slerrimac- are to have gold medals of
honor at once, but no arrangement seems
to have been made to confer the decora
tion on Hobson himself. Perhaps the dis
tinction Is to be reserved for Sampson,
who really is entitled to some recognition
for Ills ability and coolness in securing
the destruction of a hulk which it was
highly desirable to get out of the way, in
view of the peculiar circumstances of its
acquisition by the Government. But this
is a matter which the Committee on Ex
penditures in the Navy Department will
have a chance to consider when the Con
gressional Investigation is ordered.
So many hunters have been shot for game
in the mountainous sections of the Empire
State during the current season that an ef
fort is to be made to have the Legislature
provide penalties for the Idiot who strays
Into the forest and -peppers away at what
soever may chance to move within the
range of his vision. Casualties of this de
scription are not, however, peculiar to New
York, for all through the country hunters
have fallen victims to the criminal careless
new of persons with more ammunition than
common sense.
Slf-satisfled modern civilization was in
clined to cast ridicule upon Max Nordau
when he published his theories of degenera
tion, but if Mr. Nordau peruses the account
of the Maysvillc, Ky., outrage upon the
negro prisoner who was vivisected vwhilo
burning at the stake, he may feel Inclined
tu write a special American supplement for
his work.
Leaders of the negro clement in Cuba
are not pleased with Mr. McKlnley's mes
sage and are talking and acting In an un
pleasant manner. Their idea of "inde
pendence" has always been a black repub
lic like that of Haiti, and the chagrin they
feel on seeing all prospect of such a thing
disappear, may lead them and their Igno
rant following into serious trouble. Per
haps it would be well for the Government
to wait awhile before much weakening the
army ofoecupation.
A rather queer story comes from South
Africa in relation to the mental condition
ot President Steyn. of the Orange Free
State. It is said that he has "command
eered" his old political opponent, Mr. Fra
zer, for the Presidency; which we suppose
means that he has ordered that gentleman
to assume the ofllce. Strange things hap
pen in the Dark Continent. Fancy Mr.
McKlnley's getting tired of his job, and
"commandeering" Mr. William J. Bryan
to take it off his hands!

from the furnace.
The inmates consisting of Mrs. AVait,
who is the widow of the well-known ar

with smoke and flames. The woman fled
in their night gowns. A gallery of rare

burned with the house. The loss will
reach 23.000.
The residence was built by former May

The house and effects were partially in

Fire broke out on the lower floor of the
historic north college and, as the room
was filled with inflammable material a
lively blaze followed. The fire department
was prompt lu its response and afia
sharp battle confined the damage to two

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Dec. 9. It was a
high sense ot p?rsonal honor that caused
the late Colonel Egbert, of the Twenty
second Infantry, to leave his family in such
straitened circumstances.
On account of this Mr. Foraker has in
troduced a bill in the United States Senate
to increase the pension of the widow to

years ago. Colonel Egbert In isome way
became interested in a mining scheme, in
which he interested some friends, who in

The mine proved a failure, but Colonel
Egbsrt resolved that no one should suffer
but himself. Every month he deducted a
certain amount from his salary, which he
sent to the men who bad invested and lost

PITTSBURG, Pa., Dec. 9. Circulars
have been sent out by the American Win

biggest cut ever made at one time and Is
Intended as a blow at the independent fac

ALE OP ISLANDS.
Senator I.oilfre Seeking to Verify- at
Newapaner Rumor.
The introduction by Senator Lodge of
a resolution tri she Senate calling for In
formation frdm (the Secretary of State as
to the truth of a newspaper report that
negotiations 'for the sale by Ecuador of
the Galapagqs, (Islands to Great Britain
were being conducted. Is understood to be
preliminary tpja,hoped-for arrangement for
the acquirement ot the islands or one of
them by this country for use as a coaling
station. While Government officials pro
fess to have been ignorant of any inten
tion on the part of Senator Lodge toTnake
the enquiry, there is enough evidence to
show that Mr. Lodge's action is not dls
Dleaslng to the Navy Department, at least.
Its Introduction has been followed by a let
ter on the subject from the Secretary ofthe
Navy to the Secretary of State calling at
tention to the advantages, of the Galapa
gos group for naval purposes and suggest
ing. It Is said, that steps be taken to pre
vent them from falling into the hands of
any foreign power
Meanwhile, th,e State Department is
making enquires with a view to replying
to the Lodge resolution. The Department
had not heard of the report that Great
Britain was attempting to secure the Isl
ands until it appeared in the newspapers,
and there Is little credence attached to it
in official circles. Its publication is re
garded as a feeler, however, and the United
States Government is perfectly willing to
respond to the bait although it would not
have Great Britain understand that any
unfriendly feeling toward that country is
Involved In the desire of this country to
prevent the islands from falling Into tho
hands of England. No such feeling is en
tertained by the Government. The matter
is regarded as one of expediency and if the
Islands are to be disposed ot by Ecuador
this Government wants the first choice.
Ecuador has become very sensitive on the
subject of the sale of the Galapagos group.
That the South American Republic would
like to dispose ot the islands there is no
doubt, but she has probably been prevented
from selling them to some European coun
try for fear of offending the United Srstes.
A search is being made of the State De
partment archives to ascertain the history
of the negotiations concerning the islands.
In which the United States have been con
cerned. So far the search has revealed
th'at when Mr. Blaine was Secretary of
State under President Harrison he directed
Rowland Mahany, ot New York. United
States Minister at Quito, to negotiate with
the Government of Ecuador for the transfer
cf the Islands to the United States. Mr.
Mahany telegraphed the State Department
that he had succeeded in making a treaty
for the sale pf the group to this country.
The State Department has been unable to
find trace of the document. It is certain
that no such treaty was ever tent to the
Senate for ratification. It Is expected at
the department that It will be in a position
in a few days to answer Mr. Lodge's reso
lution positively and deiinittly.
The officials of the Navy Department
would like to obtain a site for a coaling
station in the Galapagos group. Its situ
ation is extremely valuable, from a stra
tegic standpoint There is now no point
on or near the Pacific Coast of the Western
Hemisphere, excepting, of course. United
States territory, which the United States
could use to coal and otherwise supply a
fleet in time of war. For that reason, the
acquisition of a coaling station in the Gal
apagos would' be a distinct adtantage. If
there were arr isthmian canal controlled
by the United States or free to its ships In
time of war, the possession of a coal de
pot In the group would not be so neces
sary. Those who are in favor of securing
one or more of. the islands are rather glad
than otherwise that the rumor that Great
Britain wants the group should be started
at this time, as it brings the importance of
the matter to the attention of the Executive
and Conaress.
THE NEW YORK POSTOFFICE.
l'lstlia fur n One-Story Mrnetnre l'i
lim n In Thai C'll).
Representative Amos Cummlngs of New'
York, will Introduce a bill lu the House
for the construction of a one-story uptown
postofflce building for New York city. The
cost, according to Assistant Postmaster
General Perry Heath, would be from $2C0.
0C0 to 1300,000 according to size and de
sign. From $1,000,000 to $1,300,000 would
probably cover the cost of the ground.
This proposition, it Is stated, has the ap
proval of the New York delegation. The
delegation has come to the conclusion there
might be some difficulty in getting Con
gress to pass a bill for a permanent build
ing, while assurances have been iven that
the Postofflce Department will favor a
temporary building to relieve the situation
in New York. Senator Piatt and Postmas
ter Van Cott, ot New York, have seen the
Assistant Postmaster General on this sub
ject. Speaking of the proposed building,
Mr. Heath said today:
"My Idea was that as the New York de'e
gation would simply be content to buy tha
ground and put up a temporary building,
It could be used Indefinitely until such
time as Congress would be willing to make
an appropriation for a permanent build
ing. "Postmaster Van Cott thinks it the bet
ter plan to' first get a temporary building,
and all of the members ot the New York
delegation with whom I have talked or had
correspondence. Including Senator Piatt
and Mr. Cummings, agree with that plan.
With the temporary building up, one-halt
ot the business could be transferred from
the present New York office to the uptown
office."
SOUTHERN RAILWAY WORK.
TratHe Bejclns Tomorrow on the Sa-
vannah Egtennlon.
NEW YORK. Dec. 9. Samuel Spencer,
President ot the Southern Railway Com
pany, in speaking of the official announce
ment that the Savannah extension of the
Southern's system will be opened for
traffic on tomorrow, said yesterday:
"The determination of the Southern
Railway Company to extend its lines to
Savannah, was reached in March last,
when the Florida Central and Peninsula'
Railroad was sold to a syndicate allied
with the Seaboard system, as the South
ern could no longer expect that the F. C.
& P. would be operated, as theretofore,
as a preferential connection of its lines.
The most logical alliance for the South
ern to seek was. of course, the Plant
System, as, that system has no Interests
north of Charleston, and it would, there
fore, be neutral in its relations with the
Southern, as compared with Its other
Northern 'connection, the Atlantic Coast
Line. I
"The line will be opened at the time
orlglnalllytfixcd last spring, and it is fully
prepared to do the Florida business of the
Southern, as well or better than it has
ever been "done."

CHICAGO, Ills.. Dec. 9. Rumors con
cerning future arrangements of consol
idated Wagner-Pullman Interests are rife,
and all indications point to early end
sweeping changes in the officials and man
agement of the Pullman Company. The
Wagner offices in New York were closed,
and the fact was regarded as significant.
It was said it would not be long before
Broadway headquarters would be estab

was. moreover, hinted that Ro'osrt T.
Lincoln would shortly resign the pres

be succeeded by Dr. Seward Webb, ot New

Mr. Lincoln, It is said, has long been
anxious to resign the presidency, but kept
the office until arrangements could be
completed for the choosing of a successor.
Little information could be obtained at
the offices in thePulllman Building today,
and the officials refused to either confirm
or -deny- the rumor.

NATIONAL COBODTTEE PLANS.
The Republican Body to Meet Here
Next Friday.
The Republican National Committee will
meet at the Arlington Hotel Fri
day next. The principal business
to come before the committee
will be the choice of a city In which
the next Republican National Conventlou
shall be held. The National Committeemen
are arriving In this city already. Messrs.
Scott of West Virginia, Manley of Maine,
Youngblood of Alabama, Lyons ot Georgia,
and Sharp of Idaho are among those who
are already here. The rival cl'ies are en
deavoring to secure pledges from the re
spective committeemen before they reach
the Capital City,
Senator Mark A. Hanna ot Ohio tald to
day that being chairman of the National
Committee, he Is, ot course, not entitled
to vote on the question of the selection of
the convention city. He said that there
may be some force In the suggestion that
with the Presidential nomination practi
cally disposed of to the West, the East
ought to have an opportunity to enthuse
over the selection of the Vice Presidential
candidate.. He was not prepared to an

though he volunteered the remark: that It
will be difficult to find a man In the party
to measure up to the standard set by the
late Vice President Hobart.
Senator Thomas C. Piatt of New York,
who left Washington for New York today,
has said that the convention Is any city's
fight yet. The cities that will ask for It
are New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Buf
falo. St. Louis, Kansas City, and Cincin
nati. Senator Piatt champions the claims of
New York city, and has worked indus
triously to have the Republican Conven
tion held there. During the week, it is
said, he has had conferences on this sub
ject with Senator Hanna, Henry C. Payne,
and other members of the committee.
Col. Charles Dick, Secretary of the Repub
lican National Committee, favors the
claims of Chicago as the convention city.
He believes that city will be chosen.
Members ot the New York delegation in
Congress are working industriously to
capture both conventions. Representative
Jefferson M. Levy has Invited all the
members of the New York city delegation
to dine with him next Tuesday for the
purpose of concentrating their efforts to
secure the Democratic Convention for
New York city.
Representative Ruppert, before leturn
Ing to New York, to remain over Sunday,
said the outlook for securing the Demo
cratic Convention Is very encouraging.
Judging from the friendly expressions
from Democratic members of the House
who hate been spoken to on the subject
He says New York will send to Washing
ton a strong delegation to present its
claims for recognition, and unless the
minds of the committeemen are already
made up In a contrary direction, the dele

win.
CRITICISED THE LITURGY.
Vrenldeut Kllnt. "f Vale, t'reuteii
Stoine hurprlnc.
BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 9. Two rather
startling events took place at the weekly
meeting of the Episcopal clergymen of Bos
ton at. the diocesan house. The first was
that, for the first time in the history of the
club, a president of Harvard, who was not
an Episcopalian, was invited to deliver the
address. The second was that I'resident
Eliot drastically declared himself against
the liturgical form and repetitions of the
Episcopal system of service and prayer.
President Eliot's first objection to the
Episcopalian form, was that it was preju
diced against an; thing new. He compared
it with the Unitarian s stern, which he
described as one always tolerant of any
thing new- and progressive. His next ob
jection was its liturgy, in which appear
ceaseless repetitions. Where repetitions
occur, he said, there necessarily follows a
mental frugality. He said that he attend
ed prajers in Harvard twice a day, ifiid of
the three men who used extemporaneous
prayers, two of these were never guilty of
repetitions iu prayers or methods of con
ducting service.
As a man of scientific knowledge, Le
said, he was forced to condemn many of
the expressions and phrases used in the
Episcopal prayer book. He gave as an ex
ample the expression which appears in the
baptismal service: "Man is conceived and
born In sin." That, to his mind, was
nothing short of blasphemy. From a study
ot heredity such an expression proved its
own irregularity and consistency.
The marriage service, he held, contained
an expression which he could not for a
moment accept. It was: "In the times of
man's innocency." He said that his study
of mankind taught him to believe that
there neter was such a time In the his
tory of man; consequently he could not
accept the phrase. He also objected to
a service which contained a comparison
of the resurrection to a seed. The compar
ison was not exact, and such teaching, he
thought, was dangerous to truth.
He again objected to a portion of the
service for the ordination of priests, where
a clause is seen which gives the right of
the absolution ot sins to a priest. He
could not see, he said, how one man could
have power over the sins of another.
NEW RAILWAY DEAL ASPECTS.
lienor! of nifr Interentw Secured by
the I'enMH) Itanla.
NEW YORK. Dec. 9 It Is said here to
day that so far there has been no official
confirmation or Indeed any material evi
dence of recent reports that a controlling
interest in the Baltimore and Ohio Rail
way had been acquired by a syndicate act
ing in the interests of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, but notwithstanding that, the
matter is commonly accepted as a fact.
Further Interesting and Important devel
opments along the same line are now ex
pected, and doubtless an early step in the
general transaction will be found to be
in the disposition made ot the Chicago
and Alton property. The developments in
this direction however, they may result
eventually, will beyond any question make
tor stability, and as regards the market for
securities, they may safely be placed upon
the constructive side of the account- Hence
their issue may be awaited with hopeful
expectancy.
It seems likely, however, that certain
events are impending in another section of
the country which may have a contrary and
unsettling Influence. Reference is had to
the position ot the syndicate which in the
early part of the year acquired a controlling
interest in the Seaboard Air Line system,
the Georgia and Alabama, and the Florida
Central and Peninsular Company, and
which has since undertaken to connect
these lines through the construction of new
mileage between various points. Some at
tention has already been given in this
column to this matter, and it seems proper
at this time that further attention should
be devoted to the matter in the light of n:w
developments. It was the original inten
tion of the companies or the Baltimore or
the New York interests allied with them,
to become permanent investors in the Sea
board Air Line or Florida Central and Pen
insular. Their plan was to consolidate the
lines, recapitalize them and dispose of the
new securities. It may be many months,
however, before this sjndlcate can be
liquidated on the lines originally planned,
and in tha meantime, the Baltimore trust
companies, the stocks of which broke so
sharply on Wednesday, can enjoy the satis
faction ot counting among their assets the
millions of dollars they have advanced In
this enterprise which was warranted
neither by its merits nor by ths necessities
of the transportation situation in the South
ern States.
Women Asphyxiated by Can.
NEW YORK. Dec. 9. Mrs. Elizabeth

MISSING ACCOUNTED FOR.
Only Tito Bodies Found In Rulua of
the RcatllnK Fire.
READING, Pa.. Dee. 9. After an all
night search of the ruins of the burned
hosiery mill of Nolde & Horst no more
bodies hare been found. The missing, it
is thought, have all been accounted for.
No deaths among the sixty Injured girls
have taken place, but at least a dozen are
in a dangerous condition. MIbs Louisa A.
Clay is the name of one of the dead.
The last reports of the State factory in
spector and State Insurance Inspectors
speak highly of the condition of the fac
tory, the fire escanes. doorways, and stair
ways. Jacob Nolde", President of the com
pany, said in regard to the doors being
locked and the windows nailed shut and
screened:
"The windows leading to the fire es
capes were not nailed shut. Screens pro
tected some of the windows, but they were
so arranged that they could be raised the
same as the windows. As for the doors,
they were not locked. It Is not the rule
of the management to keep them locked,
and they were open at the time the fire
broke out- The accidents to the girls
would not have happened if thy had only
taken their time Id going down the fire
escapes. Instead of this, however, they be
came excited and started to jump. The
ladders at the lower ends of the fire
escaDea were fastened up with stout twine
or rope just strong enough to hold them
up. and anyone could have removed tho
rone and let the ladders down."
The company's big St- Bernard dog,
chained In the yard, perished during the
lire, as he was forgotten. Firemen are
still in the basement up to their waists
in wat-r searching for bodies.

TREASURER HERRLKEN GONE.
A Unlliruor JIan ald to lie Short in
lliH Accountit.
BALTIMORE. Dec. 9. Charles Merri
ken. secretary and treasurer of the Carib
bean Manganese Company and of the Mary
land Clay Company, has disappeared. The
books of the concerns are in the hands cf
an expert accountant, who is endeavoring
to learn accurately the total of Mcrriken's
losses which is estimated to be between
JoO.OCO and $71,000.
Harry A. Parr, the sole owner of Ihe
Maryland Clay Company and a one-quatter
owner of the Manganese Company, says if
Merriken will come back and help straight
en things up he will not prosecute. Both
companies are rich, and neither will be ar
retted. Merriken lived like a lord on a-$2,000
salary. He told his wife he had $50,000,
and lived as if that was his annual Income.
His livery bill alone amounted to $100 a
month. He would bet $100 on the drop nf
a hat, and when pigeon shooting became
a mania with him lost $150 without ado at
an afternoon shoot.
He has made his presence felt in the bet
ting ring more than once, but has bean a
steady loser with it all, though he has com
pelled a bookie on more than one occasion
to "turn his slate." One ot his extrava
gances was to have a doctor call at his
house every morning to examine into the
health of himself, his wife and child. An
other was to take large parties to a Turk
ish bath and foot all the bills. Suppers
and dinners were frequent affairs with

ADVOCATING LESS SLEEP.
3lotenicntt of Student for I.cnfsth
enlnu; WorUinr; llnur.
-MADISON. Wis., Dec 9. A very strange
experiment Is being tried by an organiza
tion of university students to lengthen
working hours. Upon the.theory that sljep
is to a large extent a matter of habit and
can be lessened by proier care or the sys
tem, the members are trying to reduce
sleeping hours to a minimum, consistent
with continuing health. The organization
is not in (he nature of a secret eociety. but
it has been working quietly in order to
get the best representatives among the
students from the various colleges inter
ested m the matter.
The experiment was first begun in tte
Iowa University and white it does not ap
pear to take on the character of an Inter
collegiate organization the Wisconsin
members have organized along the lines of
the Iowa University Club. The theory
upon which the membefs are working is
to get such control over the body as to
keep one part of the sjstem at rest while
the other part works; in other words,
avoiding unnecessary waste of vitality.
Thomas A. Edison, the inventor. Is the
originator of this theory. The method as
it Is given out is to lessen, tha sleeping
hours gradually and so accustom the sys
tem to it by degrees.
