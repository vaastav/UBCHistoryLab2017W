The inau. ural address at the beginning of .he

the late Special Session, were both m linly devoted
to the domestic controversy out of which the insur

now occurs to add to fr subtract from the principles
or general purposes stated aud expressed iu those
do contents.
The 1 i I ray of hope for preserving the Union
peaceably, expired at the assault upon Fort Sum
ter. and a genersj review of what has occurred since
in iy not be unprofitable. What was painfully un
certain then is much better defined and more dis
Unci now, and the progress of events is plainly iu
tlie right dirt'dion The insurgents confidently
claimi'd a strong Mlpport uorlh of Mason and Dix
on's line, and the frieuds r.f tlie Union were not
free from apprehension on this point. This, how -ever,
was soon settled definitely and on the right
side. South ol the line, noble little Delaware Ted

CENtSAL SCOTT.
Sineo your last adjournment Lieutenant General
Scott has retired from the head of the army. Du
ring his lopg life the nation has not been unmind
ful of his merit, yet on calling to mint! how faith
fully, ably and hrii'iantty he has served the coun
try from a time far back in our history, when few
of the now living h;wi been born, and ihcticc forward
continually, I cannot but think that we are siill his
debtor. I submit, therefore, for your considera
tion, whit farther mirk oi recognition h due to
him, and ourselves as a grateful people.
OEM. m'' .e i lax .
With the retirement of Oen. Scott came the exe
cutive duty of appointing if) his stead a General -in-Chief
of the army. It Is a lor lunate circumstance
that neither in council ncr country was there, so
far as Pknow, any ditTeren-e of opinion as to the
proper person to' be selected. The retiring chief
repeatedly expressed his judgment ia favor ol Gen.
.McCleilan for the p sition, and iu this the nation
seemed to give an unanimous concurrence. The
tle-igtiatlotiof Gen McCleilan U, therefore, in a
eonsulerablc degree, the selection of the country
a well as of the Executive. and henee there isrCi-
tktn to hope there will be giveu him the confidence :
..-..i it .1 . . .... t
anu eoroiai siijjpttri inns ny ia T implication prom
is -d, and witli tut which he cannot with so full ef
ficicney sercc the country. It has been said that
one bad General U better than two good ones, and
the saying is true if taken tu mean no more than
that an army is better ürected by a single mind,
though infer lor, than by two superior oms at va
ritince and cross purposes; and ihe same is'true in
all joint operations wherein those engaged can
haie none bufa common end in viewt and can dU
'"r m,,y Ul Ult co'ce oi means. In a storm at

of all political evil. Monarchy tUelf. is ' some
times hinted at as a possible rcfne frra the pow
er of the people. In my present positiun, I could
scarcely be justified were I to omit prising a warn
ing voice againf this npproioli uf retuynieg "h'1
potism. It is nu( needetl nor fitting lure that a
genera) argometit sliouldbe made in favor of pop

conneotioiw, not so hucaiieycd a most othere, to
which I a brici atleption- Il U the effort tu
dI.icc ciiDit.il on an equal footing with, if not above
labor in the structure of Oov't. It is asfumrd!
tliat labor is available only in connection with cap
ital; that nobody lators unless -io-'.m ..ly else, '
owning capital, somclu i , by the use ol it in luces
him to labor.
This assumed, it is next considered whether it Is
best that capital shall hiic laborers und thus induce
tliciD to work by their own consent or buy them
and drive them to it without thuir consent. Hav
ing proceeded so far.it is naturally roncluded that
an taoorers are ctiner utr.-u iiiion-rs orwnaiwe
call slaves. And further', it is assumed, that who
ever is a Ipred I dihser is xe l in th il condition for
life. Now, there is no such relation bctaeeii cap
ital and labor, as assumed, nor is there Wiy such
thing as a freeman being fixed foe life In thi- condi-

Ittghor coi-idcratiou. C ipital has its rights hieb
arc as worthy of protection as any other rights.,
Nor is it denned tint there is, and probably always
will be, a relation between laoor and capital, pro-
ducmg mutual bene lit. 1 he error is hi assuming
tit.it 'he whole labor of 4 ootr.m tnity exists within
that relation. A few men It ivu ctpitil, and that
few avoid lalnr, and with their capital hire or buy
a low to labor for thorn. A large majority belong
to weither class -neither w.rk for others nor have
OlhCT working fur them. In most of the South
em Stiles, a m ijoritv of ths people of all colors
are neither slaves nor masters; while in the North-
eru a large maioritv uro neither hirets nor hired
Ajen with than families, wives, sons and iLiugh-

duct to themselves and asking no favors OT capital
j on the one hand, nor of hired lattorers or slaves on
the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable
; nuinocr ol persons mingle tneir own labor nun
capital; that is they labor with llieir own lunds,
! and also buy or hire othors to labor for them; but
i this is only a mixed and not a distinct class. No ;

i this mixed class. Again, as has alroady been said, ;

From the first taking of our national census to
the last are 70 years, and we find our population nt
the end of the period b times Ja crest as it was al
the beginning The increase of those other things
hieb are deemed desirable has even been greater.
We thus have at one view what the popular prin
I ciple applied to Government, through the machine
ry of the Stutesand the Union, has produced iu a
