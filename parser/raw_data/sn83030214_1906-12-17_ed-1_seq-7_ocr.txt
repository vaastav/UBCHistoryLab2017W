ROYALTY'S "DIETS."

Km word in th English language appeals more
rKmerfully to »• Anointed of the Lord than "diet.-
, It stand- for those parliamentary Institutions which
i>t : esch successive generation are increasing the
legislative restrictions upon the authority and th«
time honored Prerogatives of the monarch*. The
word also constitutes to them an unpleasant re
minder that th-y are compelled to humor, not only
tne will of their people, but also the caprices of
their own royal digestions. Th*se nro for the most
part badly damaged. They are likely to be delicate
by Inheritance, ana Impaired by the lack of sim
plicity in the food and the compulsion to depend
upon highly seasoned dishes and gastronomieal
masterpieces of culinary artists of Gallic origin,
Instead of upon the plain fare with which people
occupying _le«s exalted sphere* In life are obliged
to be content
King Charles of Rumania, whose health Is In an
extremely critical condition, has been restricted
lor many months past to a diet of milk and crack
ers. Emperor Francis Joseph, now In the neigh
borhood of eighty year* of age. ascribes the reten
tion of his amazing physical and mental vigor to
the fact that lie has always been extremely care
ful about his diet, and Is now more strict about It
than ever. Ha seldom touches anything at the
banquets which he gives, rating alone before or
afterward, dishes of the simplest description spe
cially prepared for him. King Edward. In spite of
his reputation as a gourmet, has for the last ten
years observed the utmost caution with regard to
his diet, to the tyranny of which he renders the
mo« complete subjection. Emperor Nicholas and
The Sultan of Turkey are obliged to be still more
careful about their diet— less, however, by reason
of delicacy of digestion than on account of the
serious danger of poison. In fact, the Padishah
never touches a single dish or bottle of water that
does not reach his table sealed, after having been
previously tusied by one of the highest and most
trusted dignitaries of the realm, this office having
been long filled by the gallant old field marshal
Furnamed "The Victorious," who was the hero of
the siege of Plevna In the last Turkish war with
Russia.
Another monarch, who Is a slave to diet Is Leo
pold of Belgium, who restricts himself to the plain
est fare.
The two heaviest eaters of the now living crowned
heads of Eurore are undoubtedly King Charles of
Portugal, who ha* Inherited his voracious appetite
from hi* grandfather, the late King Victor Em
manuel of Ituly. and Klnp Alfonso of Spain, whose
prowess Tvlth the fork i* duo to the fact that he is
a Bourbon. The Bourbons have for hundreds of
years been renowned for their extraordinary ca
pacities in the matter of consumption of food, and
It is not altogether surprising under the circum
stances that most of the Bourbon kings of France,
and many of those of Spain, and of the two Sicilies,
have succumbed to stomach troubles. It Is prob
ably owing to the youth of Don Alfonso that he re
mains for the present so thin, and conveys bo little,
notion by his appearance of the power of his ap
petltlte for food— but not for drink, as h« is a tee
totaller. But the Bulk of King Charles of Portugal
is colossal, and almost as large as that of the late
King of Wurtembcrg. renowned for his gluttony,
and of the Maharajah of Travancor*. The latter
undergoes each year a rather peculiar ceremony In
connection with his avoirdupois. It ie known as
the ceremony of Talanaram. and consists In weigh
ing him against an equivalent weight In gold. The
latter Is thereupon distributed among the poor, who
assemble around the palace gates for the purpose.
It stands to reason, therefore, that the loyal sub
jects of this Indian potentate are extremely Inter
ested in fattening him, with a view to the Increase
of his weight.
The most famous royal glutton on record Is.
however. Louis XVI, of France, who lost his life,
and that of his consort. Queen Marie Antoinette-,
because of h!s slavery to his appetite. For they
would have escaped at the time of their flight to
Varenn-s had not the King Insisted m stopping at
an Inn In order to devour a roast turkey, for which
his stomach experienced an Insatiable craving. Just
as he was finishing his meal his pursuers caught
up with him and placed him. together with the
Queen and the Dauphin, under arrest. They were
taken back to Paris, where the boy died in th«
prt«on Into which they had been thrown, and from
which the King and Queen emerged only to go to
the scaffold.
HOW KING EDWARD -BREAKS" OFFICERS.
President Roosevelt* request for legislation em
powering the Chief Magistrate to dismiss from the
navy, and presumably also from the army, offi
cers without the action of a court martial
Bt'ves to call attention to the fact that this 1b a
prerogative enjoyed by some European rulers and
denied to others. Thus It Is claimed and exercised
by King Edward, whose government may be de
scribed as the most democratic monarchy In ex
istence. He is. by virtue of the terms of the con
stitution, at liberty to dispense with the services of
an. officer or man whom he sees fit to dismiss from
the finny or from the navy. Officers. In particular,
are 1 recently removed from the army without any
court martial or Judicial trial of their com. A
mere notice In "The Ga«tte" to the effect that
"his majesty ha* no further use for the eervlcee
of Captain This or Major That U all that Is neces
sary to "break" an officer and to restore him to
private life with the brand of what i 8i 8 equivalent
to dishonorable discharge in this country. He has
absolutely no redress in law. and. while he may
demand a court martial, the sovereign, in his ca
pacity as commander In chief, is at perfect freedom
to torn a deaf ear to the. application.
This fart was brougit to light at the time of th.
Boer war. when a number of offlcerß were dis
missal, cither for hopeless Incompetence or else
for disobedience. Borne of them conceived that
thoy had been badly used, and were convinced that
D y reason of their having given the greater part
of their life to the service of their country in th«»
a-mv they had a right, at any rate, to a judicial
• artne in the form of a court martial or of a
court of inquiry, before betas dlemlMed. But they
Sly found out their mistake, and that the tenure
of their commission was entirely dependent upon
the pleasure of the sovereign.
The Crown Is absolutely supreme In command of
the army and navy. and has th, *ple and exclusive
power of raising and regulating armies and fleet..
Thi prerogative was disputed and claimed by the
«o cJwl "Urn* Parliament" of Charles I. But

In the very brigades and divisions which they may
have previously commanded. In fact, he lnf.lcted
this penalty two or three years before the war with
Japan upon a couple of generals who. rather the
worse for drink, had disgraced themselves by a
fistic encounter in the prsstnes of their troop*.

NEW- YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. MONDAY. DECE^rBER 17, 1906.
Intolerable, but, although he Is at the head of
what la generally admitted to be the moat perfect
and up-to-date military system In the world, ha
cannot divest an officer of his commission In the
army without a Judicial hearing. In fact, nowhere
do the officers of the army possess so much inde
pendence aa in Germany, where the constitution
and the law of the land stato that officers and
men In the army may b» punished only In accord
ance with the law and as the result of a sentence
recognized by law as Judicial.
This condition of affairs dates back to 1808. Up to
that time the King of Prussia was perfectly free to
dismiss whomsoever he saw fit, either with or with
out the co-operation of a court martial. But after
the crushing defeats by the French, the Prussian
officers came to the conclusion that there was
something wrong In the system, and, accordingly,
with th» sanction of the King and of the legislat
ure, formed themselves into a species of common
wealth, the members of which were governed by
Courts of Honor, then Instituted for the first time
by law. This law of 1805. withdrawing the power
of dismissal, and of other forms of punishment,
from the Crown and vesting it in Courts of Honor
composed of officers, was confirmed and amended
in 1844, and on the constitution of the German Em
pire was extended by Article 61 to the entire Ger
man army, excepting, I believe, the troops of Ba
varia.
GERMAN COURTS OF HONOR.
In fact, the sovereign is rendered by these laws
the mere executor of the decrees of the courts of
honor. To these every officer has a right to appeal
for Justice. And so great is their power that .not
only can no serious punishment, such as dismissal,
be Inflicted without the sanction or by the decree
of these courts of honor, but they even control the
appointment of regimental officers to various corps.
Thus, the Emperor, although ho can grant a com
mission to an officer, cannot appoint him to a regi
ment without the consent of the officers of that
regiment, or against their wishes, as expressed by
the officers assembled in a court of honor.
That Is the reason why the German army, almost
alone among the armies of the civilized world. Is
without any Jewish regimental officers. The Kal
eer Is willing enough to. grant them commissions;
has, Indeed, conferred epaulettes upon them, but
has never yet succeeded in getting any of them
admitted to any regiment, the officers of which,
possessing the same prerogatives as the members
of a club In the selection cf their comrades, in
variably blackballing Hebrew candidates.
How Jealous are the German, and especially the
Prussian, officers of their constitutional rights In
connection with these courts of honor may be
gathered from the fact that some ten years ago
Prince Frederick of Hohenzollern resigned the
command of, the Division of the Guards of the
Prussian army because the Emperor declined to
accept or to act upon the decision of a court of
honor, declaring It to be unjust, and demanding a
reconsideration of the matter by another court of
honor. It is only fair to add that In this, as In
many other matters of the same kind, the Emperor
was championing the cause of liberalism against
the prejudices of military caste.
MUCH THE SAME IN OTHER ARMIES.
In a modified form the earn*, condition of affairs
prevails in the armies of Bavaria and Austria —
that Is to say, the power of punishment and of the
maintenance not merely of discipline but of the
honor among the officers Is vested In the hands of
the officers themselves. While in one way this 13
of advantage, since It safeguards the Interests of
the officers both Individually and as a whole. it has
Its drawbacks, lor It serves to maintain a military
caste possessed of ethics which In many respects
are narrow minded, antiquated and at variance
with the laws of tho lane., and which the sovereign
is powerless to override.
From the above It will be seen that Emperor
William has been handicapped in some of his most
liberal and enlightened projects, as. for Instance, In
connection with the appointment of Jewish officers
to regiments, by the restrictions imposed upon him
by the terrra of the constitution; while, on tha
other hand, the late Queen Victoria and her suc
cessor. King Edward, have never exposed them
selves to any charge of abuse of their power of
dismissal of officers of the army and navy without
Judicial hearing, being guided In this as in other
matters by a tactful appreciation of the will of the
people. MARQUISE DE FONTENOT.
J. D. ROCKEFELLER. JR.. ON WIVES.
"Get Married Early," He Saya, "But Be
Careful in Your Selection."
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., offered some advice
as to the choosing of a wife in his talk to his
Bible claas at tho Fifth Avenue Baptist Church
yesterday. He also advised the members to gret
married as Boon as possible, expressing an opin
ion that a wife, provided she was the right
kind, was one of the best assets a young man
could acquire.
Several of th« members of the Bible class are
married men, and these nodded their heads vig
orously In approval cf their leader's remarks
(although nonq of their respective wives were
present), while the unmarried men listened with
eager attention.
"In selecting a wife, he sure tr» get the right
kind." said Mr Rockefeller. "There is hardly
any question more Important than the choice of
a helpmate. A man's wife can cither make a
man or mar a man's whole life. I have known
young men whoso promlßing careers were
ppolled by an unwise selection in this respect.
If a young- man Is eager to lead a life of
righteousness and to devote himself to Christian
eei-vlce. and he takes unto himself a wife whose
thoughts are absolutely frivolous and selfish,
the result will be disastrous.
"Get married as soon as you cm. but be sure
to select a wife who shares your attitude toward
life. The other kind of woman w ill lead you to
ruin.
"In starting out In life every young man must
makfl his choice. You must decide whether
your life shall be devoted to the pursuit of .st-lf
ish gain or to the service of the Lord. That Is
the great fundamental choice which confronts
every young man. Shall he go in for Christian
service or for materialism, v.hich soon or late
must force a. man to break away from the ties
of the Church?" 1
H. Troxell, the president of the cln^s, has been
re-elected to that office. Mr. Rockefeller yes
terday warmly praised him for his good work
and ' nngratulateii the class upon his re-election.

ARMY OFFICERS TO SEE WORLD.— Secretary '
Taft believes there should be encouragement of the
army to travel in foreign countries, and to this end
he la In favor of legislation to bo Incorporated In
the Army Appropriation bill this session which
shall have the effect of regarding officers as on de
tached service during certain parts of leaves of
absence granted officers who are on duty In the
Philippines. Hitherto officers attached to stations
at a distance from Manila have been obliged to
take the interlsland transports, and much time la
really wasted in petting to and from Manila, If '
this period, sometimes extending over a fortnight,
could be taken out of the officers' leave and re
paided as a period of detached service. It would
give more time for officers in the Far East to travel
and see something of other countries, and perfect
themselves in foreign languages. This concession
to officers will have to be granted by act of Con
gross, and It is expected that there will he no op
position to this supK«stlon of tha Secretary of War .
under the circumstances. I

The recommendations from the various boards re- I
ferring to different staff corps were not in entire
aprtenent. and this was why. In a short session
of Congress, there need be no attempt to reconcile
the differences. It is possible, of course, that the
staff officers themselves, who are interested in ob- i
taining certain things, such as promotion after
thre») years for the assistant paymasters and a re- j
grading of the civil engineers, will seek to obtain :
the legislation Independent of a departmental meas
ure. This might stand some chance of Congres
sional approval were It not that there is little
time In which to work projects of this kind through
tne naval committees, especially when a great part
or the committee consideration must be given up
to the regular appropriation bill. The President's
special message on the naval personnel, which ho
will send in early next week, probably on "Monday,
will make no reference to the staff corps, and It is
considered that much of importance to the service
will be accomplished If Congress enacts the con
templated legislation in behalf of the naval lin^.
WORTH OF, OFFICER'S WORD— corre- j
epondence has been exchanged between a captain j
of Infantry, who was detailed as surveying: officer j
to fix the responsibility for the loss of certain !
public property, and the quartermaster general of
the army, on whose records tho property was car- '
ried The quartermaster general insisted on having
an affidavit from the surveying officer, who de
clined to give it. and stated that he felt it unneces
sary to furnish more than a certificate covering 1
the facts in the case. The correspondence became >
spirited, and the War Department has had to take !
action in the matter, to the extent of calllnsr the '
Junior officer to account and rendering a formal de- ■
cision that the quartermaster general Is entirely
■within his riphtp when he insists upon affidavits
instead of certificates from officers detailed to con
duct purveys of lost or damaged property. Not only
was this information Riven by thr department, but
the surveying officer was informed that he had
subjected hlms<lf to disciplinary measures on ac
count of Insubordination.
CALLS ARTILLERY WEAK.]
General Murray Says It Could Not
Give Reasonably Good Service.
Washington. Dec. 16. — "Both the coast and th<i
field artillery are badly deficient In both per
sonnel and material: neither Is In even approxi
mately proper condition for Instruction In time
of peace, much less In condition for reasonably
efficient service In war, and the time necessary
: to put either In the latter condition Is not a
' matter of days or weeks, but of years."
Brigadier General Arthur Murray, chief of
artillery, thus eums up the condition of his arm
of the service In his annual report, which Is
made publlo to-day, and In which he says It
cannnt be too strongly urged that appropriate
legislation be obtained to make good the de
ficiencies and to correct the defects referred to.
The total coat of the present system of coast
defence of the United States to February 27
last r General Murray says, was $72,760,853. and
the estimated cost to complete the defence of
tho United States, including" estimates for am
munition and cost of sites, is $50,879,339. From
theeo tlgures the deduction 13 made that con
siderably more than half the work of coast de
fence has been completed. The three elements
of defence most needed, vrhlch will give th»i
greatest measure of public safety at the least
cost. General Murray says, are the completion
of the Installation of the approved tsysiom of
range and position finding for all guns mounted,
the providing of necessary searchlights for
harbor defence at night and the completion of
the submarine mine equipment of all fortified
harbors. '
The proper defence of insular ports. It Is esti
mated, will cost $19,573,895, and the entrance to
the Panama Canal, $4, 8.7. 682.
The vulue of submarine mines as an element
of harbor defence, General Murray says, has
been demons; rai<Hl. and he maintains that the
system adopted by the United States arrry is
practically perfect a.s a war weapon. Bains
under complete electrical control froni the short,
lie says, a line ot mines may be rendered in
stantly destructive to an enemy or harmless
t., passing friendly vt-ssels. Therefore, he adds,
having *" many guns and mortars already
mounted in the i:nited States, it Is believed that
the greatest amount ot harbor defence at the
least coat f-an 1>- procured by the completion
of tho mine defence ol all l'ortitted harbors of the
Fniterl States.
■\\'o cannot afford, however," General Murray
further states, "to wait for war before com
pietinj,' our mine defence, but must be pr
beforehand."
Uui even then, he says, a complete equipment
would be of no u»e onleaa there were a trained
personnel to plant the mines, maintain them
tatad Kiid explode them at the proper :
in action.
General Murray calls attention to the matter
of providing power plants for use in com
with 1 oth tuna and mines. The desirability of
separation of coast and lield artillery, i •
Murray says, H apparent.
"The com! inatfuii of the coast and field ar
tillery into a corps as ta now done," h<
•is ii.it only unsound as s military principle,
i>',n the frequeni Interchange of officers tx
them t tticallj untelated arms ta considered to
be dearly detrimental to thf efficiency of both."
