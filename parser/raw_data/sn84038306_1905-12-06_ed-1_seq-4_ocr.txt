STIjc democrat
OPPIOIAL PAPBft Ol OOUNTY AND OITY.
WEDNESDAY, DEC. G, 1905.
The Democrat is one of the first
papers in the country to publish the
President's message in an abridged
or any other form. With the ad
dition of. another paragraph against
the tariff beneficiaries, who are
.charging, unjust prices for their
products, the message would be an
admirable democratic document.
Democrats will take few exceptions
to the President's recommendations.
Something New in the World,
A political strike, a strike of the
laboring masses for the purpose of
securing desired reforms or changes
in existing laws, is something new
in the history of the human race. It
is designed to be a bloodless weapon,
but just as potent in producing re
sults as armies or battleships The
intention of the organization is to
secure desired objects by paralyzing
the industries of a country until the
governing powers yield. In other
words a peaceful revolution.
It seems that the laboring masses
of Russia are organized and deter
mined to use this new weapon until
the Czar and his Grand Dukes
grant the people a liberal share in
the government of that country. The
results thus far have been amazing,
and if the leaders can restrain the
the ruffianly element from deeds of
violence success seems almost assur
ed.
Football must be revised, radi
cally revised, or abolished. The list
of deaths and serious injuries, re
sulting from the brutality of football
players, is little less than appalling.
And these fatalities and injuries are
not the worst features of the game.
It is cowardly it is un-American it
is debasing.
The prize fight rule, which pro
tects a man from being struck when
he is down, is reversed in football as
it is played by the leading college
teams. When a football player is
thrown to the ground and held ther*
by a more powerful antagonist, he
may expect to be jumped upon by
other members of the opposing team
and struck and kicked in the most
vital parts of his body. No manly
man would take such an advantage
of a fallen foe it is un-American to
take such an advantage of a fallen
foe it is cowardly to take such an
advantage of a fallen foe the game
as it is played teaches an unmanly
lesson.
President Roosevelt's annual message
has been delivered to congress. Open
Jng with a plea for the co-operation of
nl] classes in continuing the country')
prosperity and in correcting existing
evils, for a' "square deal" for every
body, the message first takes up the
.question of corporations and railroad
rate legislation. The president say#:
Corporations,
I am .in no sense hostile to corpora
tions. This is an age of combination,
and any effort to prevent all combina
tion will be not only useless, but In the
cud vicious, because of the contempt
for law which the failure to enforce
law inevitably prouuees. The corpora
tion has come to stav, just as the
trades union has come to stay. Each
can do and has done great good. Each
should be favored so long as it does
good. But each should be sharply
checked where it acts against law and
justice.
Experience has shown conclusively
that it is useless to try to get uny ade
quate regulation and supervision of
these great corporations bv state ac
tion. Such regulation and supervision
can only be effectively exercised by a
sovereigu whose jurisdiction is coex
tensive with the field work of the cor
porations—that is, by the national gov
ernment. I believe that this regulation
'and supervision can be obtained bv the
enactment of law bv the congress. If
this proves impossible, it will certainlv
be necessary ultimately to confer in
fullest form such power upon the na
tional government bv affirmative ne
mcnt oL the constitution.
The laws of the congress and of the
several states hitherto, as.passed upon
by the courts, have resulted more often
in showing that the states have no
power in the matter than that the na
tional government has power so that
there at present exists a very unfortu
nate condition of things, under which
these great corporations doing an in
terstate business occup.v the position of
subjects without a sovereign, neither
nuv state government nor the national
government haviug effective control
over them. Our steady aim should be
by legislation, cautiously and carefullv
undertaken, but resolutely persevered
in, to assert the sovereignty of the na
tional government by affirmative ac
tion.
This Is only in form an innovation.
In substance it is merely a restoration,
for from the earliest time such regula
tion of industrial activities has been
recognized in the action of the- law
making bodies, and all that I propose
is to meet the changed conditions in
such manner as will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power it has
always possessed, not only in this coun
try, but also in England before and
since tills country became a separate
nation.
Railroad Itatc Leictalatloii.
As I said in my message of Dee. 0
last, the immediate aud most pressin:
need so far as legislation is concerned
is the enactment into law of some
scheme to secure to the ageuts of the
government such supervision and regn
latlon of the rates charged by the rail
roads of the country engaged iu Inter
state trafhc as shall summarily and el
fectively prevent the Imposition of un
just or unreasonable rates. It must
include putting a complete stop to re
bates in every shape aud form. Tlii
power to regulate rates, like all similar
powers over the business world, should
be exercised with modeiuition, caution
and self restraint, but it should exist,
so that it can be effectively exercised
.when the need arises.
In my judgment, the most important
provision which such law should con
tain is that conferring upon some com
petent administrative body the power
to decide upon the case being brought
before it whether a given rato pre
scribed by a railroad is reasonable and
just, and if It is found to be unreason
able aud unjust then, after full investi
gation of the complaint, to prescribe
the limit of rato beyond which it Bhall
not be lawful to go—the maximum
reasonable rate, as it Is commonly call
ed—this decision to go into effect with
in a reasonable time and to obtain
from thenco onward, subject to review
by the courts.
It sometimes happens at present, not
that a rate is too high, but that a fa
vored shipper is given too low a rate.
In such ease the commission would
have the right to fix this already estab
lished minimum rate as the maximum,
und It would need only one or two such
dccisious by the commission to cure
railroad companies of the practice of
giving improper minimum rates. I call
your atteutiou to the fact that my pro
posal is not to give the commission
tower to initiate or originate rates gen
rnuy, but to regulate a rate already
lixod or originated by the roads upon
mplaint and after investigation. A
neavy penalty should be exacted from
auy corporation which fails to respect
an order of tbe commission. I regard
Ibis power to establish a maximum
rate us being essential to any scheme
of real reform in the matter of railway
regulation.
It is worth while considering whether
it would not be wise to confer on the
government the right of civil action
against the beneficiary of a rebate for
at least twice the value of the rebate.
This would help stop what is really
blackmail. Elevator allowances should
be stopped, for they have uow grown
to such an extent that they are demor
alizing and arc used as rebates.
Private Cnr Linen.
Ail private ear lines, industrial roads,
refrigerator charges and the like
should be expressly put under the su*
pervlsion of the interstate commerce
commission or some similar body so
far as rates and agreements practical
ly affecting rates are coucerned. A re
bate in icing charges or in mileage or in
a division of the rate for refrigeratiug
charges is just as pernicious as a re
bate in any other way.
There should be publicity of the ac
counts of eonunou carriers. Only In
this way can violations or evasions of
the law be surely detected. A system
of examination of railroad accounts
should be provided similar to that now
conducted into the national banks by
the bank examiners. A few first class
railroad accountants, if they had prop
er direction and proper authority to lu
speet books and papers, could accom
plish much in preventing willful viola
tions of the law.
Employer*' Liability Lair,
In my nuuual message to the Fifty
eighth congress at its second session 1
recommended the passage of an em
ployers* liability law for the District of
Columbia and in our navy yards. I re
newed that recommendation In my
message to the Fifty-eighth congress at
its second session and further suggest
ed the appointment of a commission to
make a comprehensive study of em
ployers' liability with a view to the en
actment of a wise and constitutional
law covering the subject, applicable to
all industries within the scope of the
federal power. I hope that such a law
will be prepared and enacted as speed
ily as possible.
There has beeu demand for depriving
courts of tbe power to Issue Injunctions
in labor disputes. Such special limita
tion of the equity powers of our courts
would be most uuwise. It is^true that
some judges have misused this power,
but this does not justify a denial of the
power any more than an improper ex
ercise of tiie power to call a strike by a
labor leader would justify the denial of
the right to strike. The remedy is to
regulate the procedure by requiring the
judge to give due notice to the adverse
parties before granting the writ, the
hearing to be ex parte if the adverse
party "does not appear at the time and
place ordered. What is due notice must
depend upon the facts of the case. It
should not be used as a pretext to per
mit violatiou of law or the jeopardiz
ing of life or property. Of course this
would not authorize the issuing of a
restraining order or injunction in any
case In which it is not already author
ized by existing law.
I renew the recommendation I made
in my last annual message for an in
vestigation b.v the department of com
merce aud labor of general labor condi
tions. especial attention to be paid to
the conditions of child labor and child
labor legislation in the several slates.
Such an investigation should take Into
account the various problems with
which the question of child labor la
connected. In such a republic as ours
the one tiling that we cannot afford to
neglect Is the problem of turning out
decent citizens. he future of the na
tion depends upon the citizenship of
the generations to come. The children
of today are those who tomorrow will
shape the destiny of our land, and we
cannot afford to neglect them. The leg
islature of Colorado litis recommended
that the national government: provide
some general measure for the protec
tion from abuse of children and dumb
animals throughout the United States.
I lay the matter belore you for what 1
trust will lie your favorable consider
ation.
An to Women Who Work.
i.*be department ot commerce and la
bor should also make a thorough inves
tigation of the conditions of women in
industry. Over y.UOO.UOO American wo
men are now engaged in gainful occu
pations, yet there is an almost complete
dearth of data upon which to base any
trustworthy conclusions as regards a
subject as important as it is vast aud
complicated. The introduction of wo
men Into industry is working cbaugc
aiul disturbance in the domestic aud
social life of the nation. The decrease
in marriage, and especially In the birth
rate, has been coincident with it. We
must face accomplished facts, and the
adjustment to factory conditions must
be made, but surely it cau be made
with less friction and less harmful ef
fects on family lite than is now the
case. Tills whole matter in reality
forms one of the greatest sociological
phenomena of our time. It is a social
question of the hrst importance, of far
greater importance than anv merely po
litical or economic question can be.
In any great labor disturbance not
only are employer and employee inter
ested, but also a third party—the gen
eral public. Every considerably labor
difficulty iu which interstate commerce
is involved should be Investigated by
the government and the facts officially
reported to the public.
IUMQrillltaC.
The great insurance companies afford
striking examples of corporations
whose business has extended so far
beyond the jurisdiction of the states
which created them as to preclude
strict enforcement of supervision and
regulation by the parent states. In my
last annual message I recommended
-that the congress carefully consider
whether the power of the bureau of
corporations cannot constitutionally be
extended to cover interstate transac
tions in insurance." Itecent events
have emphasized the Importance of an
early and exhaustive consideration of
IUJS
question, to see whether it is not
possible to furnish better safeguards
than the several states have been ablo
to furnish against conniption of the
flagrant kind which has been exposed.
It has been only too clearly shown
that certain of the men at the head of
these large corporations take but small
note of the ethical distinction between
honesty and dishonesty. They draw
the Hue only this side of what may be
called law honesty, the kind of honesty
necessary in order to avoid falling into
the clutches of the law. Of course the
only complete remedy for this condi
tion must be found in an aroused pub
lic conscience, a higher sense of ethical
conduct in the community at large and
especially among business men and in
the great profession of tbe law, and in
the growth of a spirit which condemns
all dishouesty, whether In rich man or
In poor man, whether it takes the shape
of bribery or of blackmail. But much
cau be done by legislation which Is not
only drastic, but practical. There is
need of a far stricter and more uni
form regulation of the vast Insurance
interests of this country. The United
States should in this respect follow the
policy of other nations by providing
adequate national supervision of com
mercial interests which are clearly na
tional in character.
I repeat my previous recommenda
tion that the congress should consider
whether- the federal government has
any power or owes any duty with re
spect to domestic transactions iu In
surance of an interstate character.
That state supervision has proved in
adequate Is geuerally conceded.
The Revenue*!.
There Is more need of stability than
of the attempt to attain au ideal per
fection In the methods of raisiug rev
enue, and the shock and strain to the
business world certain to attend any
serious chauge in these methods ren
der such change inadvisable unless for
grave reason. It Is uot possible to lay
down auy general rule by which to de
termine the moment when the reasons
for will outweigh the reasons against
such a chauge. No cliauge can be
made on lines beneficial to or desired
by one section or one state only. There
must be sometliiug like a general agree
ment among the citizens of the several
states that the change Is needed and
desired in the Interest of the people as a
whole, aud there should theu be a sin
cere, intelligent and disinterested ef
fort to make It in such shape as will
combine, so far as possible, the maxi
mum of good to the people at large
with the minimum of necessary disre
gard for the special interests of locali
ties or classes, but In time of peace
the revenue must, on the average,
taking a series of years together, equal
the expenditures or else the revenues
.must be increased. Last year there
was a deficit. Unless our expenditures
cau be kept within the revenues then
our revenue laws must be readjusted.
It is impossible to outline what shape
such a readjustment should take, for
it is as yet too early to say whether
there will be need for it Jt should be
considered whether it is not desirable
that the tariff laws should provide for
applying as against or in favor of anv
Odd goods accumulating have
sunk many a business craft. Throw
them overboard, sell them before
they have time to grow old or accu
mulate to go into each season with
new, bright goods, fresh from the
mill and factory, is our rule.

other nation maximum and minimum
tariff rates established by the congress,
so as to secure a certain reciprocity of
treatment between other nations and
ourselves.
Economy la Expenditures.
I earnestly recommend to the con
gress the need of economy and, to this
eud, of a rigid scrutiny of appropria
tions. A11 unnecessary offices should
be abolished. In tbe public printing
also a large saving of money can be
made. There is a constantly growing
tendency to -publish masses of unim
portant information at which no human
being ever looks.
Yet, In speaking of economy, I must
in uowise be understood as advocating
the false ecouomy which is In the end
the worst extravagance. To cut down
in tbe navy would bo a crime against
the nation. To fall to push forward all
work on the Panama canal would be
as great a folly.
Currency.
Every consideration of prudence de^
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity to our currency system. The
evil docs not consist In an inadequate
volume of money, but In the rigidity
of this volume, which does not respond
as It should to the varying needs of
communities and of seasons. Inflation
must be avoided, but soroo provision
should be made that will insure' a
larger volume of money during the fall
and winter months than In tbe less ac
tive seasons of the year, so that the
currency will contract agalnet specula
tion and will expand for the needs ofr
legitimate business. At present the'
treasury department Is at irregularly
recurring intervals obliged In the inters
est of the business world—that Is, in
the Interests of the American public—
to try to avert financial crises by pro
viding a remedy which should be pro*
vided by congressional action.
BoBtnean .Methods In Department.
At various times I have instituted
vestigations Into the organization ana
Conduct ot the business of the execu
tive departments. While none ot these
Inquiries have yet progressed far
enough* to warrant final conclusions,
they have already confirmed and em?,
phaslzed the general Impression that
the organization of the departments is
often faulty in principle and wasteful
In results, while many of their busluess
methods are antiquated and Inefficient
I recommend that the congress consider
this subject.

the congress, but it should go as far as
under the constitution It Is possible to
go and should include severe penalties
against bim who gives or receives a
bribe Intended to influence his:act or
opinion as an elector and provisions for
the publication not only of the expend
itures for nominations and elections of
all candidates, but also of all contribu
tions received and expenditures made
by political committees."
I desire to repeat this recommenda
tion.
All contributions by corporations to
any political committee or for any po
litical purpose should be forbidden by
law, directors should not be permitted
to use stockholders' money for such
purposes, and, moreover, a prohibition
of this kind would be, as far aB it
went, an effective method of stopping
the evils aimed at In corrupt practices
acts.
The Ilmrae Conference.
The first confercncc of uatlons held
at The Hague lu ISO!), being unable to
dispose of all the business before it,
recommended the consideration and,
settlement of a number of important
questions by another conference to be
called subsequently and at an early'
date. These questions were tbe follow
ing: (1) The rights and duties of neu
trals (2) the limitation of the armed
forces on land and sea and of military
budgets (3) the use of new types and
calibers of military and naval guns (4)
the inviolability of private property at
sea lu times of war (5) the bombard
ment of ports, cities and villages by na
val forces. Iu October, 1004, at the In
stance of the Interparliamentary union,
I Issued invitations to all the powers
signatory to Tbe Hague convention to
scud delegates to such a conference
and suggested that it be again held at
The Hague.
From all the powers acceptance was
received, coupled In some cases with
the condition that we should wait until
the end of the war then waging be
tween Russia and Japan. The emperor
of ltussia, Immediately after the treaty
of peace which so happily terminated
this war, in a note presented to tbe
president on Sept 13 took the Initiative
in recommending that the conference
be now called. Tbe United States gov
I ernment In response expressed Its cor
dial acquiescence and stated that It
would as a matter of course take part
In the new conference and endeavor to
further Us aims. We assume that all
civilized governments will support the
movement and that the conference is
now an assured fact This government
will do everything in its power to se
cure the success of tbe conference to

peace, justice aud good will.
Monroe Doctrine.
There are certaiu essential points
which must never be forgotten as re
gards the Monroe doctrine. In the first
place, we must as a nation make it ev

But we must make It evident that wo
do not lutcud to permit the Monroe doc
trine to be used by any uation on thi:
continent as a shield to protect It from
the consequences of Its own misdeeds
against forcigu nations. The Monroe
doctrine does uot force us to interfere
to prevent the puuishiuent of a port
save to see that the punishment doe?
not assume the form of territorial occu
pation in any shape. The case is more
difficult when it refers to a contractual
obligation. This country would cer
taiuly decline to go to war to prcvcut a
forcigu goverumeut from collecting a
just debt. Ou the other hand, it is
very inadvisable to permit any foreign
power to take possession, eveu tempo
rarily, of the custom houses of an
American republic in order to enforce
the payment of its obligations, for such
temporary occupation might turn into
a permanent occupation. The only es
cape from these alternatives may at
any time be that we must ourselves
undertake to bring about some arrange
ment by which so much as possible of
a Just obligation shall be paid.
To do so lusurcs the defaulting re
public from having to pay debts ot an
Improper charactcr under duress, while
it also insures houest creditors of the
republic from bclug passed by lu the
interest of dishonest or grasping cred
itors. Moreover, for the Uulted States
to take such a posltlou offers the only
possible way of iusuring us against a
clash with some foreign power. The
position is therefore in the interest of
peace as well as in the Interest of jus
tice.

Army aud Navy.
I do not believe that any army in the
world has a better average of enlisted
man or a better type of Junior officer,
but the army should be trained to act
effectively iu a mass. Provision should
be made by sufficient appropriations
for maneuvers of a practical kind.
Provision should be made for the pro
motion of exceptionally meritorious
meu over the heads of their comrades
and for the retirement of all men who
have reached a given ago without get
ting beyoud a jtiven rank.
There should be an Increase In the
coast artillery force so that our coast
fortifications can be In some degree
adequately manned. There Is special
need for an Increase and reorganization
of the medical department of the army.
In both the army and navy there must
be the same thorough training for duty
I In the staff corps as In the fighting line.
The importance of this was shown con
cluslvely lu the Spanish-American aud
the Russo-Japanese wars. The work
of the medical departments In the Jap
auesc army and navy is especially
worthy of study.
Our navy must, relatively to the na
I vies of other nations, always be of
'greater size than our army. We have

Wlmt Is now clearly necessary is to
substitute efficient for Inefllcleut uults
as the latter become worn out or as It
becomes apparent that they are use
less. I'rolmhly tlie result would be
attained by adding a single battleship
to our navy caeli year, the superseded
or outworn vessels being laid tip or
broken up as they are thus replaced.
Naturalisation.
On this BuUSect I recommend:
First—A federal bureau of naturali
zation, to be established in the depai-t
ment of commerce aud labor, to su
pervise the administration of the natu
ralization laws and to receive returns
of naturalizations pending aud accom
plished.

Criminal Lam.
In my last message I asked the at
tention of the congress to the urgent
need of action to make our criminal
law more cIToctive, and I most ear
nestly request that you pay heed to
the report of the attorney general on
this subject.
There seems to bc no statute of tlie
United States which provides for tho
punishment of a United States attor
ney or oilier oflleer of the government
who corruptly »Kro«3 to wrougfully So
or wrongfully refrain from doing any
act when the consideration for such
corrupt agreement Is other than one
possessing money value. This ought to
be remedied by appropriate legislation.
Legislation should also be enacted to
cover explicitly, unequivocally and be
yond question breach cf trust In tlie
shape of prematurely divulging offlclu!
secrets by an officer or employee of the
United States uud to provide a suitable
lieualty therefor.
Merchant Marine.
To the spread of our trado In peace
and the defense of our flag in war a
great and prosperous merchant marine
Is indispensable. Wo should have ships
ot our own and seamen ot our own to
convey our goods to neutral markett
and in case of need to re-entorce our
battle line. It cannot but be a source
of regret and uneasiness to us that the
lines of communication with our sister
republics of'South America should be
chiefly uuder foreign control. It is not
a good thing that American, meroliauts
and manufacturers should have to send
their goods aud letters to South Amer
ica via Europe If they wish security
and dispatch. Even on the Pacific,
where our ships have held their own
better than on the Atlantic, our mer
chant flag Is uow threatened through
the liberal aid bestowed by other gov
ernments on their own steam lines. I
ask your earnest consideration At the
report with which the merchant ma
rine commission has followed its long
and careful Inquiry.
It Is a matter of unmixed satisfac
tion once more to call attention to the
excellent work of the pension bureau,
for the veterans of the civil war have
a greater claim upon us than nny other
class of our citizens. To tliem first of
all among our people honor Is due.
