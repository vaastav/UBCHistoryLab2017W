PRESIDENT HAYES' MESSAGE.
/■ *’ How-Citizens of the Senate dial Howie of H •j/re-
Heotdtirre:
I congratulate you on the continued and in
creasing prosperity of our country. By the favor
of Diyine Providence we have been Messed, du
ring the past year, with health, with abundant
harvests, with profitable employment for ail or
people, and with contentment at home, and wim
peace and friendship with other nation.-.
The occurrence of the twenty-fourth election of
chief magistrate has afforded another opportunity
to the people of tile United States to exhibit to
the world a significant example of the peaceful
and safe transmission of the power and authority
of government from the public servants whose
terms of office are about to expire, to their newly
•diosen successors. This example cannot fail to
impress profoundly, thoughtful people of other
■ountrics with the advantages which republican
institutions afford. The immediate, general, and
cheerful acquiescence of all good citizens, in the
result of the election, gives gratifying assurance to
our country, and to its friends throughout the
world, that a government based on the free con
sent of an intelligent and patriotic people possess
es elements of strength, stability and permanency
not found in any other form of government.
SECTIONALISM.
Continued opposition to the full and free enjoy
ment of the rights of citizenship, conferred u ( on
the colored people by the recent amendments to
the constitution, still prevails in several of the
late slave-holding states. It has, perhaps, not
been manifested in the recent election to any large
extent in acts of violence or intimidation. It has,
however, by IVaaduolnt practices in connection
with ballots, with the regulations as to the places
and manner of voting, and with counting, return
ing and canvassing the votes cast, been successful
in defeating the exercise of the right preservative
of all rights, the right of suffrage; which the con
■titntiou expressly confers upon our enfranchised
citizens.
It is the desire of the good people of the whole
country that sectionalism as a factor in our pol
itics should disappear. They prefer that no sec
tion of the country should bo united in sound op
position to any other section. The disposition to
refuse a prompt and hearty obedience to the
equal rights amendments to the constitution, is all
fhat now stands in the way of a complete obliter
ation of sectional lines in our political contests.
As long as either of these amendments is flagrant
ly violated or disregarded, it is safe to assume
that the people who placed them in the constitu
tion, as embodying the legitimate results of the
war for the Union, and who believe them to be
wise and necessary, will continue to act together,
and to insist that they shall be obeyed. The par
amount question still is, as to the enjoyment of
the right by every American citizen who has the
requisite qualifications, to freely cast his vote and
to have it honestly counted. With this question
rightly settled, the country will be relieved of the
contentions of the past; bygones will indeed be
bygones; and political and party issues with re
spect to economy and efficiency of administration,
internal improvements, the tariff, domestic taxa
tion, education, finance, and other important sub
jects. will then receive their full share of atten
tion; but resistance to, and nullification of, the re
sults of the war. will unite together in resolute
purpose for their support all who maintain the
authority of the government and the perpetuity of
the Union, and who adequately appreciate the
value of the victory achieved. This determina
tion proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling
to any part of the people of our country, or to
any of their interests. The inviolability of the
amendments rest upon the fundamental princi
pal of our government. They are the solemn ex
pression of tlie will of the people of the United
.States.
The-sentiment that the constitutional rights of
all our citizens must be maintained does not grow
weaker. It will continue to control the govern
ment of the country. Happily, the history of the
lute election shows that in many parts of the
country where opposition to the fifteenth amend
ment has heretofore prevailed it is diminishing,
and is likely to cease altogether, if firm and well
considered action is taken by congress. I trust
the house of representatives and the senate, which
have the right to judge of the elections, returns
and qualifications of their own members, will see
to it that every ease of violation of the letter or
spirit of the fifteenth amendment is thoroughly
investigated, and that no benefit from such viola
tion shall accrue to any x>erson or party. It will
be the duty of the executive, with sufficient ap
propriations for the purpose, to prosecute unspar
ingly all who have been engaged in depriving
citizens of the rights guarranteed to them by the
constitution.
EDUCATION.
It is not, however, to be forgotten that the best
and surest guarrantee of the primary rights of
citizenship is to be found in that capacity for self
protection which can belong only to a people whose
right to universal suffrage is supported by uni
versal education. The means at the command of
the local and state authorities are, in many cases,
wholly inadequate to furnish free instruction to
all who need it. This is especially true where,
before emancipation, the education of the people
was neglected or prevented, in the interest of
slavery. Firmly convinced that the subject of
popular education deserves the earnest attention
of the people of the whole country, with a view to
wise and comprehensive action by the government
of the United States. 1 respectfully recommend
that congress, by suitable legislation and with
proper sate-guards, supplement the local educa
tional funds in the several states where the grave
duties and responsibilities of citizenship have been
devolved on uneducated people, by devoting to
the purpose grants of the public lands, and, if nec
essary. W appropriations from the treasury of the
United States. Whatever government can fairly
do to promote free popular education ought to be
done. Wherever general education is found,
peace, virtue and social order prevail,
and civil and religions liberty are secure.
CIVIL SERVICE.
In my former annual message, I have asked
the attention of congress to the urgent necessity
of a reformation of the civil-service system of the
government. Aly views concerning the dangers
of patronage, or appointments for personal or
partisan considerations, have been strengthened
by my observation and experience in the execu
tive office, and I believe these dangers threaten
the stability of the government. Abuses so ser- 1
ions in their nature cannot be permanently toler
ated. They tend to become more alarming with
the enlargement of administrative service, as the
growth of the country in population increases the
number of officers and placemen employed.
The reasons are imperative for the adoption of
fixed rules for the regulation of appointments,
promotion# and removals, establishing a uniform
method, having exclusively in view, in every in
stance, the attainment of the best qualifications
for the position in question. Such a method alone
h consistent with the equal rights of all citizens,
and the most economical and efficient administra
tion of the public business.
G mpetive examinations, in aid of impartial ap
pointment# and promotions, have been conducted
~r s'onie years past in several of the executive
departments, and by my direction this system has
''ecu adopted in the Custom Houses and post
office* qfThe larger cities of the country. In the
city of New V ork over two thousand positions in
the oiml service have been subject, in their ap
pointments and tenure of place; to the operation
ot published rules for this purpose, during the
past two years. The results of these practical
trials have been very satisfactory, and have con
firmed. my opinion iu favor of this system of se
lection. All are subjected to the same tests, and
the result is tree from prejudice by personal favor
or partisan influence. It secures for the position
applied for the best qualifications attainable
among the competing appliants. It is an ef
fectual protection from the pressure of impor
tunity which, under any other course pursued,
largely exacts the time and attention of appoint
ing the officers, to their great detriment in the dis
charge of other officials duties, preventing tiie
abuse of the service for the mere furtherance of
private or party purposes, and leaving the em
ploye of the government, freed from the obliga
tions imposed by patronage, to depend solely up
on merit for retention and advancement, and with
this constant incentive to exertion and improve
ment.
These invaluable results have been attained in
a high degree in the offices where the rules for ap
pointment by competitive examination have been
applied.
A method which has so approved itself by ex
perimental tests at points where nob tests may
M fairly considered conclusive, should be cx
ended to ail subordinate positions under the gov
ernment. I believe that a strong aud growing
public sentiment demand# immediate measures tor
eeurnig ai*l enforcing the highest possible
efficiency in the civil service, and its protection
1 oin recognized abuses, and that the experience
referred to has demonstrated the feasibility of
such measures.
The examinations in the east on houses and
post offices have been held under many cinbaras
m-Tits and without provision for compensation
for the extra labor performed by the officers who
have conducted them, and whose comemlable in
terest in the improvement of the public service
has induced pecuniary reward. A continuance of
these labors gratuiottsly ought not to be expected,
and without an appropriation by congress for
compensation, it is not practicable to extend the
system of examinations generally throughout the
civil service. It is also highly important that all
such examinations should be conducted upon a
uniform system and under general supervision.
Section 1 .753 of the Revised Statutes authorizes
the presity nt to prescribe the regulations for ad
mission to the civil service of the United States,
and for this purpose to employ suitable persons
to conduct the requisite inquiries with refer
ence to "the fitness of each candidate, in respect
to age, health, character, knowledge and ability,
for the branch of service into which he seeks to
enter:" hut the law is practically inoperative for
the want of the requisite appropriation.
1 therefore recommend an appropriation of
$25,000 per annum to meet the expenses, of. a com
mission, to be appointed by the president in ac
cordance with the terms of this section, whose
duty it shall be to devise a just, uniform and ef
ficient system of competitive examinations, and to
supervise the application of the same throughout
entire civil service of the government. 1 am
persuaded that the facilities which such a commis
sion will afford for testing the fitness of those who
apply for office will not only be welcome a re
lief to members of congress as it will be to the
president and heads of departments, but that it
will also greatly tend to remove the causes of em
barrassment which now inevitably and constantly
attend the conflicting claims of patronage between
the legislative and executive departments. The
iqost effectual cheek upon the pernicious compe
tition of influence .and official favoritism, in the
bestowal of office, will he the substitution of an
open competition of merit between the applicants,
in which every one can make his own record, with
the assurance that his success will depend upon
is alone.
• . I also recommend such legislation as, while leav
ing every officer a- free as any other citizen to ex
press his political opinions and to use his means
for their advancement,, shall also enable him to
feel a S'safe as any private citizen in refusing all
demands upon his salary for political purposes. A
law which should thus guarantee true liberty and
justice to all who a;e engaged in the public ser
vice, and likewise contain stringent provisions
against the use of official authority to coerce the
political action of private citizens or of official
subordinates greatly to be desired.
THE SPOILS SYSTEM.
The most serious obstacle, however, to an im
provement of the civil service, and especially to a
reform in the method of appointment and re
moval, has been found to be the practice, under
what is known as the spoils system, by which the
appointing power has Mon so largely encroached
upon byAuembers of congress, The first step in
the reform of the civil service must be a complete
divorce between congress and the executive in the
mutter of the appointments. The corrupting
doctrine that “to the victors belong the spoils,’ is
inseparable from congressional patronage as the
established rule and practice of parties in power.
It comes to he understood by applicants for office,
and by the people generally, that representatives
and senators are entitled to dis purse the patronage
of their respective districts and states. It is not
necessary to recite at length the evils resulting
from this invasion of the executive function-. The
true principles of government on the subject of
oppointmeuts to office, as stated in the national
conventions of the leading parties of the country,
have again and again been approved by the
American people, and have not been called in
question in any quarter. These authentic expres
sions of public opinion upon this all-important
subject, are the statement of principles that be
long to the constitutional structure of the govern
ment.
“Under the constitution, tiie president and
heads of the departments are to make nominations
for office. The senate is to advise and consent to
appointments, and the house of representatives io
to accuse and prosecute faithless officers. The
best interest of the public service demands that
these distinctions be respected, that senators and
representatives, who may he judges and accusers,
should not dictate appointments to office’” To
this end the co-operation of the legislative depart
ment of the government is required, alike by the
necessities of the case and by public opinion.
Members of congress will not be relieved from the
demands made upon them with reference to ap
pointments to office until, by legislative enact
ment, the pernicious practice is condemned and
forbidden.
It is therefore recommended that an act be
passed defining the relations of members of con
gress with respect to appointment to office by the
president, and 1 also recommend that the provis
ions of section 17fi7, and of the sections following,
of the revised statutes, comprising the tenurc-of
office act of March 2,1867, he repealed.
Believing that to reform the system and meth
ods of the civil service in our country is one of the
highest and most imperative duties of statesman
ship. and that it can be permanently done only by
the co-operation of the legislative and executive
departments of the government, I again com
mend the whole subject to your considerate at
tention.
POLYGAMY.
It is the recognized duty and purpose of the
people of the United States to suppress polygamy
where it now exists in our territories, and to pre
vent its extension. Faithful and zealous efforts
have been made by the United States authorities
in I tah to enforce the laws against it. Experi
ence has shown that the legislation upon this sub
ject, to be effective, requires extensive modifica
tion and amendment. The longer action is de
layed the more difficult it will be to accomplish
what is desired. Prompt and decisive measures
are necessary. The Mormon sectarian organiza
tion which upholds polygamy has the whole pow
er of making and executing the local legislation
of the territory. By its control of the grand and
and petit juries, it possesses large influence over
the admininistration of justice. Exercising, as
the heads of this sect do, tiie local political power
of the territory, they arc able to make effective
their hostility to the law of congress on the sub
ject of polygamy, and, in fact, do prevent its en
forcement. Polygamy will not be abolished if
the enforcement of the law depends on those who
practice and uphold the crime. It can only be
suppressed by taking away the political power of
the sect which encourages and sustains it. The
power of congress to enact suitable laws to pro
tect the territories is ample. It is not a case of
half-way measures. The political power of the
Alormon sect is increasing: it controls now one of
our wealthiest and most populous territories. It
is extending steadily into other territories. Mho re
eve r it goes it establishes polygamy and sectarian
political power. The sanctity of marriage and
the family relation are the corner-stone of our
American society and civilization. Religious lib
erty and the separation of church and state are
among the elementary ideas of free institutions.
To re-establish the interests and principles which
polygamy and Monnonism have imperiled, and to
fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous immi
grants of all creeds that part of our domain
which has been, in a great degree, closed to general
immigration by intolerant and immoral institu
tions. it is recommended that the government of
the territory of Utah be reorganized.
I recommend that congress provide for the gov
ernment of Utah by a governor and judges, or
commissioners appointed by the president and
confirmed by the senate —a government analogous
to the provisional government established for the
territory northwest of the Ohio, by the ordinance
of 1787. If, however it is deemed best to con
tinue the existing of local government, I
recommend that the right to vote, hold office and
sit on juries in the territory of Utah be con
fined to those who neither practice nor uphold
polygamy. If thorough measures are adopted, it
is believed that iu a few years the evils which
now afflict Utah will be eradicated, and that this
territory will iu good time become one of the
most prosperous and attractive of the new states
of tire union.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Our relations with all foreign countries have
been those of undisturbed peace, and have pre
sented no occasion for concern as to their con
tinued maintenance.
My anticipation of an early reply from the
British government to the demand of indemnity
to our fisherman for the injuries suffered by that
industry at Fortune Bay, in January, 1878,
which I expressed in my last annual message, was
disappointed. This answer was received only in
the latter part of April in the present year, and
when received showed a failure of accord between
the two governments, as in the measure of the in
shore-fishing privilege secured to our fishermen
by the treaty of Washington, of so serious a
character that I made it the subject of a com
munication to congress. in which I recommended
Devoted. to Politics, Agriculture, News, Local Information, and tlio Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.
GRAND RAPIDS, AVIS.. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 16,1880.
the measures which seemed to me proper to be
taken by this government in maintenance of the
rights accorded to our fishermen under the
treaty, and towards securing an indemnity for
the injury these interests had suffered. A bill to
carry out these recommendations was under con
sideration by the house of representatives at the
adjournment of congress in June last.
Within a few weeks I haveroceived a communi
cation from her majesty's government, renewing
the consideration of the subject, both of the in
demnity for the injuries at Fortune Bay, and of
the interpretation of the treaty in which the pre
vious correspondence had shown the two govern
ments to be at variance. Upon both these topics
the disposition toward a friendly agreement is
manifested by a recognition of our right to an in
demnity for the transaction at Fortune Bay,
leaving the measure of such indemnity to further
conference and by an assent to the views of this
government, presented in the previous correspond
ence, that the regulation of conflicting interests
of the shore fishery of the provincial seacoasts and
die vessel fishery of our fishermen, should be
made the subject of conference and concurrent
arrangement between the two governments.
I sincerely hope that the basis maybe found
for a speedy adjustment of the very serious diver
gence of views in die interpretation of the fishery
clauses of the treaty of Washington, which as the
correspondence between the two governments
stood at the close of the last congress, seemed to
be irreconcilable*
INTERNATIONAL FAIRS.
In the important exhibition of arts and inaos
tries, which was held last year at Sydney, New
South Wales, as well as in that now in progress at
Melbourne, the United States have been efficient
ly and honorably represented. The exhibitors
from this country at the former place received a
large number of awards in some of the most con
siderable departments, and the participation of
the United States was recognized by a special
mark of distinction. In the exhibition at Mel
bourne, the share taken by our country is no less
notable, and an equal degree of success is confi
dently expected.
DIPLOMATIC AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONS.
The state of peace and tranquility now enjoyed
by all the nations of the continent of Europe has
its favorable influence upon our diplomatic and
commercial relations with them. We have con
cluded and ratified a convention with the French
republic for the settlement of claims of the citi
zens of either country against the other . Under
this convention a commission, presided over by
a distinguished publicist, appointed, in pursuance
of a request of both nations, by his majesty the
emperor of Brazil, has been organized and has
begun its session in tins city. A congress to
consider means for the protection of in
dustrai property has recently been in session in
Paris, to which I have appointed the ministers of
the United States in France and in Belgium, as
delegates. The international commission upon
weights and measures also continues its work in
Paris. I invite your attention to the necessity
of an appropriation to be made in time to enable
tliis government to comply with its obligations
under the metrical convention.
Our friendly relations with the German Empire
continue without interrupption. At the recent
international exhibition of fish and fisheries, at
Berlin, the participation of the United States,
notwithstanding the haste with which the com
mit ion was forced.to make its preparations, was
extremely successful and meritorious, winning for
private exhibitors numerous awards of a high class,
and for the country at large the principal prize
of honor offered by his majesty, the emperor.
The results of this great success cannot but be
advantageous to this important and growing in
dustry. Thera have been some questions raised
between the two governments as to the proper ef
fect and interpretation of our treaties of natural
ization, but recent dispatches from our minister at
Berlin show that fa vorable progress is making
toward an understanding, in accordance with the
views of this government, which makes and ad
mits no distinction whatever between the rights
of a native and naturalized citizen of the United
States. In practice, the complaints of molesta
tion suffered by naturalized citizens abroad have
never been fewer than at present
There is nothing of importance to note in our
unbroken friendly relations with the governments
of Austria-Hungary. Bussia, Portugal, Sweden
and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Greece.
SPAIN.
During the last summer several vessels belong
ing to the merchant marine of this country, sail
ing in neutral waters of the West Indies, were
fired at, boarded, and searched by an armed
cruiser of the Spanish government, the circum
stances, as reported, involve not only a private in
jury to the persons concerned, but also seemed too
little observant of the friendly relations existing
for a century between this country and Spain.
The wrong was brought to the attention of the
Spanish government in a serious protest and re
monstrance, and the matter is undergoing investi
gation by the royal authorities, with a view to
such explanation or reparation as may be called
for by tiie facts.
The commission sitting in tins city for the ad
judication of claims of our citizens against the
government of Spain, is, I hope, approaching the
termination of its labors.
The claims against the United States under the
Florida treaty with Spain were submitted to con
gress at the late session, and I again invite your
attention to this long-standing question, with a
view to the final disposition of the matter.
MOROCCO.
At an invitation of the Spanish government, a
conference has recently been held at the city of
Madrid to consider the subject of protection by
foreign powers of native Moors in the empire of
Morocco. The minister of the United States, in
Spain, was directed to take part in the delibera
tions of this conference, the result of which is a
convention signed on behalf of all the powers
represented. The instrument will be laid before
the senate for its consideration. The government
of the United States has lost no opportunity to
urge upon that of the emperer of Morocco the
necessity, in accordance with the humane and en
lightened spirit of the age, putting an end to the
persecutions, which have been so prevalent in
that country, of persons of a faith other than the
Moslem and especially of the Hebrew residents of
Morocco.
BELGIUM.
The consular treaty concluded with Belgium
has not yet been officially promulgated, owing to
the alteration of a word in the text by the senate
of the United States, which occasioned a delay,
during which the time allowed for ratification ex
pired. The senate will be asked to extend the
period for ratification.
EXTRADITION.
The attempt to negotiate a treaty of extra
dition with Denmark failed on account of the ob
jection of the Danish government to the usual
clause providing that each nation should pay the
expense of the arrest of the persons whose extra
dition it asks.
CHINESE RELATIONS.
The provision made by congress at its last ses
sion, for the expense of the commission which had
been appointed to enter upon negotiations with
the imperial government of China, on subjects of
great interest to the relations of the two coun
tries. enabled the commissioners to proceed at
once upon their mission. The imperial govern
ment was prepared to give prompt and respectful
attention to the matters brought under negotia
tion. and the conferences proceeded with such ra
pidity and success that, on the 17th of November
last, two treaties were signed at Pekin, one relat
ing to the introduction of Chinese into this coun
try, and one relating to commerce. Mr. Trescott,
one of the commissioners, is now on his way home
bringing the treaties, and it is expected that they
will be received in season to be laid before the
senate early in January.
JAPAN.
Our minister in Japan has negotiated a conven
tion for the reciprocal relief of shipwrecked sea
men. I take occasion to urge once more upon
congress the propriety of making provision for
the erection of suitable fire-proof buildings at the
Japanese capital for the use of the American le
gation. and the court house and jail connected
with it. The Japanese government, with great
generosity and courtesy, has offered for this pur
pose an eligible piece of land.
In my last annual message I invited the atten
tion of congress to the subject of the indemnity
funds received some years ago from China and
Japan. I renew the recommendation then made,
chat whatever portion of these funds are due to
American citizens should be promptly paid, and
the residue returned the nations, respectively,
to which they justly and equitably belong.
NETHERLANDS.
The extradition treaty with the kingdom of the
Netherlands, which has been for some time in
course of negotiation, has, during the past year,
been concluded and duly ratified.
ROUMANIA.
Delations of friendship and amity have been es
tablished between the government of the United
States and that of Roumania. We have =ent a
diplomatic representative to Bucharest, and have
-1 received at this capital the special envoy who has
been, charged by his Royal Highness Prince Charles
to announce the independent sovereignty of Rou
mania. We hope for a speedy development of
commercial relations between the two countries.
MEXICO.
In my last annual message I expressed the hope
that the prevalence of quiet on the border between
tliis country and Mexico would soon become so as
sured a< to justify the, modification of the orders,
then in force, to our military commanders, in re
gard to crossing the frontier, without encouraging
such disturbances, as would endanger the peace of
the two countries. Events moved in accordance
with these expectations, and the orders were ac
eordinglv withdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of
our own citizens and tiie Mexican government.
Subsequently the peace of the border was again
disturbed by a savage foray, under the command
of the Chief A ictoria, but, by the combined and
harmonious action of the military forces of both
countries, his band lias been broken up and sub
stantially destroyed.
There is reason to believe that the obstacles
which have so long prevented rapid and conveni
ent communication between the United States and
Mexico by railways, are on the point of disappear
ing, and that several Important enterprises of this
character will soon be set on foot which cannot fail
to contribute largely to the prosperity of both
countries.
StUTH AMERICAN STATES.
New evoys from Guatemala, Columbia, Bo
livia, Venzeuela and Nicaragua have recently
arrived at this capital, whose distinction and en
lightenment afford the best guarantee of the con
tinuance of friendly relations between ourselves
and these sister republics.
The relations between this government and that
of the United States of Columbia have engaged
public attention during the past year, mainly by
reason of the project of an intcroceanic canal
across the isthmus of Panama, to be built by
private capital under a concession from the Colum
bian government for that purpose. The treaty
obligations subsisting between the United States
and Columbia, by which we guarantee the neu
trality of the transit and the sovereignty and
property of Columbia in the isthmus, make it nec
essary that the conditions under which so stupend
ous a change in the region embraced in this guar
antee should he effected —transforming, as it
would, this isthmus, from a barrier between the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans, into a gateway and
thoroughfare between them, for the navies and
merchant ships of the world—should receive the
approval of this government, as being compatible
with the discharge of these obligations on our
part, and consistent with our interests as the
principal commercial power of the western
hemisphere. The views which I expressed in a
special message to congress in March last in re
lation to this project, I deem it my duty again to
press upon your attention. Subsequent considera
tion has but confirmed the opinion “that it is
the right and duty of the United states to assert
and maintain such supervision and authority over
any intcroceanic canal across the isthmus that
connects North and South America as will pro
tect our national interests.”
The war between the republic of Chili on the
one hand, and the allied republics of Peru and
Bolivia on the other hand, still continues. This
government has not felt called upon to interfere
in a contest that is within the belligerent rights
of the parties as independentsstates. ArcA r c have,
however, always held, ourselves in readiness to
aid in accommodating their difference, and
have at different times reminded both bel
ligerents of our willingness to render such sendee.
Our good offices in this direction were recently
accepted by all the belligerents, and it was hoped
they would prove efficacious; but I am sorrow to
announce that the measures, which the ministers
of the United States at Santiago and Lima were
authorized to take, with the view to bring about
a peace, were not successful. In the course of the
war some questions have arisen affecting neutral
rights; in all of these the minist rs ’if the United
States have, under their instructions, acted with
promptness and energy in protection of American
nterests.
The relations of the United States with the em
pire of Brazil continue te be most cordial, and
their commercial intercourse steadily increases, to
their mutual advantage.
The internal disorders with which the Argen
tine Republic has been for some time afflicted,
and which have more or less influenced its ex
ternal trade, xrc understood to have been brought
to a close. This happy result may be expected to
redound to the benefit of the foreign commerce of
that republic as well as to the development of its
vast interior resources.
SAMOA.
In Samoa, the government of King Malieota
under the support and recognition of the consular
represensatiyes of the United States, Great
Britain, and Germany, seems to have given
peace and tranquility to the islands. While it
does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole the
scheme of tripartite local government, which has
been proposed, the common interests of the three
great treaty powers require harmony in their re
lations to the native form of government, and
this may be best secured by a simple diplomatic
agreement between them. It would be well if the
consular jurisdiction of our representative at
Apia were increased in extent and importance
so as to guard American interests in the sur
rounding and outlying Islands of Oceanica.
THE OBELISK
The obelisk, generously presented by the Khe
dive of Egypt to the city of New York, has ar
rived safely in this country, and will soon be erect
ed -in that metropolis. A commission for the
liquidation of the Egyptian debt has lately con
cluded its work, and this government, at the'
earnest solicitations of the Khedive, has acceded
to the provisions adopted by it, which will belaid
before congress for its informasion. A commis
sion for the judicial code of the reform tribunal of
Egypt is now in session in Cairo. Air. Farman,
consul-general, aud J. AI. Batchclder, Esq., have
been appointed as commissioners to participate in
this work. The organization of the reform tri
bunals will probably be continued for another
period of five years.
A SANITATY CONFERENCE.
In pursuance to the act passed at the last ses
sion of congress, invitations have been extended
to foreign maratime states to join in a sanitary
conference in Washington, beginning the Ist of
January. The acceptance of this invitation by
many prominent powers gives promise of success
in this important measure, designed to establish
a system of international notification by which the
spread of infectious or epidemic diseases may be
more effectu ally cheeked or prevented. The at
tention of congress is invited to the necessary ap
propriations lor carrying into effect the pro
visions of the act referred to.
FOREIGH TRADE.
The effort of the department of state to enlarge
the trade and commerce of the United 8 tales,
through the active agency of consular officers and
through the disssemination of information ob
tained from them, have been uurelaxed. The in
terests in these exports, as developed in our com
mercial communities, and the value ol the infor
mation secured by this means, to the trade and
manufactures of the country, were recognized by
congress at its last session, and provision was
made for the more frequent publication of consu
lor and other reports by the department of state.
The first issue of this publication has now been
prepared, and subsequent issues may regularly be
expected. The importance and interest attached
to the reports of the consular officers, are witness
ed by tiie general demand for them by all classes
of merchants and manufacturers engaged in our
foreign trade, It is believed that the system of
such publications is deserving of the approval of
congress, aud that the necessary appropriations for
its continuance and enlargement will commend it
self to your consideration.
The prosperous energies of our domestic indus
tries, and their immense production of tiie sub
jects cf foreign commerce, invite, and even re
quire :.n active development of the wishes and
interests ot our people in that direction. Especi
ally important is it that our commercial relations
with the Atlantic aud Pacific coasts of South
America, with the West Indies and the Gulf of
Mexico should be direct, aud not through the cir
cuit of European systems, and should be carried
on in our own bottoms. The full appreciation of
the opportunities which our front on the Pacific
ocean gives to commerce wPh Japan, China, and
the East Indies, with Australia and the Island
groups which lie along the routes of navigation,
should inspire equai efforts to appropriate to our
own shipping, aud to administer by our own cap
ital, a due proportion of this trade, whatever
modifications our regulations of trade aud naviga
tion may be necessary or useful to meet and direct
these impulses to the enlargement of our exchanges
and of our carrying trade, I am sure the wis
dom of congress will be ready to supply. One ini
tial measure, however, seems to be so clearly use
ful and efficient that I venture to press it upon
your earnest attention. It seems to be very evi
dent that the provision of regular steam postal
communication, by and from government, has
been the forerunner of the commercial .predomi
nance of Great Britain on all these coasts and
seas, a greater share in whose trade is now the de
sire and the intent of our people. It is also man
ifest that the efforts of other European nations to
contend with Great Britain for a share of this
commerce have been successful in proportion with
their adoption of regular steam-postal communi
cation with the markets whose trade they sought.
Mexico and the states of South America are an
xious to receive such postal communications with
this country, and to aid in their development.
Similar co-oneration may be looked for. in due
time, from the eastern nations and from Australia.
It is difficult to see how the load in this movement
can be expected from private interests. In re
spect of foreign commerce, quite as much as iu in
ternal trade, postal communication seems neces
sarily a matter of common and public administra
tion. and tints pertaining to government. I re
spectfully recommend to your prompt attention
such just and efficient measures as may conduce
to the development of our foreign commercial ex
changes and the building up of our carrying
trade.
In this connection I desire also to suggest the very
great service which might be expected in enlarg
ing and faciliating our commerce on the Pacific
ocean, were a transmarine cable laid from San
Francisco to the Sandwich Islands, and thence to
Japan at the north and Australia at the south.
The great influence of such means of communica
tion on these routes of navigation, in developing
and securing the due share of our Pacific coast in
the commerce of the world, needs no illustration
or enforcement. It may be tiiat such an enter
prise, useful and in the end profitable as it would
prove to private investment, may need to be ac
celerated by prudent legislation by congress in its
aid. and I submit the matter to your careful con
sideration.
An additional, and not unimportant, although
secondary, reason for fostering and enlarging the
navy may be found iu the unquestionable service
to the expansion of our commerce, which would
be rendered by the frequent circulation of naval
ships iu the seas and ports of all quarters of the
globe. Ships of the proper construction and
equipment, to be of the greatest efficiency in case
of maritime war, might be made constant and
active agents in time of peace in the advance
ment and protection of our foreign trade, and in
the nurture and discipline of young seamen, who
would, naturally, in some numbers, mix with and
improve the crews of our merchant-ships. Our
merchants at home and abroad recognize the val
ue to foreign commerce of an active movement
of our naval vessels, and the intelligence and pa
triotic zeal of our naval officers in promoting
every interest of their countrymen, is a just sub
ject of national pride.
FINANCE.
The condition of the financial affairs of
the government, as shown by the report of
the secretary of the treasury, is very satis
factory. It is believed that the present financial
situation of the United States, whether considered
with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing
wealth, or the extent and variety of our resources,
is more favorable than that of any other country
of our time, and has never been surpassed by that
of any country at any period of its history. All
our industry are thriving; the rate of interest is
low; new railroads arc being constructed; avast
immigration is increasing our population, capital
and labor; now enterprises in great number are
iu progress, and our commercial relations with
otner countries are improving.

The amount due the sinking fund for this year
was $37,931,643,55. There was applied thereto
the sum of $73,904,617.41, being $35,972,973.86
in excess of the actual requirements for the
year.
The-aggregate of the revenues from all sources
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1860, was
$333,526,610.98, an increase over the preceding
year ef $59,699,426.52. The receipts thus far, of
the current year, together with the estimated re
ceipts for the remainder of the 3'ear, amount to
$350,000,000, which will be sufficient to meet the
estimated expenditures of the year, and leave a
surplus of $90,000,000,
It is fortunate that this large surplus revenue
occurs at a period when it may be directly ap
plied to the payment of the public debt soon to be
redeemable. Xo public duty has been more con
stantly cherished in the United States than the
policy of paying the nations' debt as rapidly as
possible.
The debt of the United States, less cash in the
treasury and exclusive of accruing interest, at
tained its maximum of $2,756,431,571.43 in
August, 1865, and has since that time been re
duced to $1.886,019,504.65. Of the principal of
the debt $108,758,100 has been paid since March
1.1877. effecting an annual saving of interest of
6,107,593 the hinder of interest has
also been diminished by the sale of bonds bearing
a low rate of interest, and the application of the
proceeds to the redemption of bonds bearing a
higher rate. The annual saving thus secured
since March 1,1877, is $14,290,453.50.
Within a short period over six hundred mil
lions of 5 and 6 per cent, bonds will become re
deemable. This presents a very favorable oppor
tunity not only to farther reduce the principal of
the debt, but also to reduce the rate of inter
est on that which will remain unpaid. I call the
attention of congress t<> tb views expressed on
this subject by t’ *e secrcta.-’v of the t-“surv >
his annual report, and recommend prompt legisla
tion, to enable the treasury department to com
plete the refunding of the debt which is about to
mature.
SPECIE PAYMENTS.
The continuance of specie payments has not
been interrupted or endangered since the date of
resumption. It has contributed greatly to the re
vival of business and to our remarkable pros
perity. The fears that preceded and accompa
nied resumption have proved groundless. Xo
considerable amount of Lnited States notes have
been presented for redemption, while very large
sums of gold bullion, both domestic and imported,
are taken to the mints and exchanged for coin or
notes. The increase of coin and bullion in the
United States since January 1, 1879, is estimated
at $227,309,428.
There are still in existence, uneancelled, $346,-
681.016 of United States legal tender notes. These
notes were authorized as a war measure, made
necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in
which the United States was then engaged. The
preservation of the nation's existence required,
in the judgment of congress, an issue of lesral-ten
der paper money. That it served well Uie pur
pose for which it was created is not (mentioned, but
the employment of the notes as paper money in
definitely, after the accomplishment of the object
for which they were provided, was not contem
plated by the framers of the law under which
they were issued. These notes long since became
like any other pecuniary obligation of the gov
ernment —a debt to b“ paid, and, when paid, to be
cancelled as mere evidence of an indebtedness no
longer existing. I therefore repeat what was
said in the annual message of last year, that the
retirement from circulation of L nited States notes,
with the capacity of legal-tender in private con
tracts, is a step to be taken in our progress to
wards a safe and stable currency, which should
be accepted as the policy and duty of the govern
ment and the interest and security of the people.
THE SILVER DOLLAR.
At the time of the passage of the act now in
force requiring the coinage of silver dollars, fixing
their value and giving them legal-tender char
acter, it was believed by many of the supporters
of the measure that the silver dollar, which it
authorized, would speedily become, under the
operations of the law, of equivalent value to the
gold dollar. There were other supporters of the
bill, who, while they doubted as to the probability
of this result, nevertheless were willing to give the
proposed experiment a fair trial, with a view to
stop the coinage, if experience should prove that
the silver dollar authorized by the bill continued
to be of less commercial value than the standard
gold dollar.
The coinage of silver dollars, under the act re
ferred to, began in Alareh. 1878, and has been
continued as required by the act. The average
rate per mouth to the present time has been
82,276,492. The total amount coined prior to
the Ist ot November last was 872.547.750. Of
this amount 847,084,450 remain in the treasury,
and only $25,763,291 are in the hands of the peo
ple. A constant effort Las been made to keep
this currency in circulation, and considerable ex
pense has been necessarily incurred for this pur
pose, but its return to the treasury is prompt
and sure. Contrary to the confident anticipation
of the friends of the measure at the time of its
adoption, ‘lie value of the silver dollar, containing
412 grains of silver, has not increased. Dur
ing the year prior to the passage of the bill au
thorizing its coinage, the market value of the
silver it contained was from 90 to 92 cents, as
compared with the standard gold dollar. During
the last year the average market value of
the silver dollar has been 88 cents.
It is obvious that the legislation of the last
congress iu regard to silver, so far as it was based
on an anticipated rise in the value of silver as a
result of that legislation, lias tailed to produce
the effect then predicted. The longer the law re
mains in force, requiring as it does the coinage
of a nominal dollar, which, in reality, is not a
dollar, the greater becomes the danger that this
country will be forced to accept a single metal as
the sole legal standard of value, in circulation, 1
and this a standard of less value than it purports
to be worth in the recognized money of the
world.
LEGAL-TENDER MONEY.
The constitution of the United States, sound
financial principles, and our best interests, all re
quire that the country should have as its legal
tender money, both gold and silver coin, of an in
trinsic value, as bullion, equivalent to that which,
on its face, it purports to possess. The constitu
tion, in express terms, recognizes both gold and
silver as the only true legal-tender money. To
banish either ,of these metals from our currency is
to narrow and limit the circulating medium of
exchange to the disparagement of important in
terests. The United States produces more silver
than any other country, and is directly interested
iu maintaining it as one of the two precious met
als which furnish the coinage of the world. It
will, in my judgment contribute to this result if
congress will repeal so much of existing legisla
tion as requires the coinage of silver dollars, con
taining only 412 H grains of silver, and in its stead
will authorize the secretary of the treasury to coin
silver dollars of equivalent value as bullion, with
gold dollars. This will defraud no man, and will
be in accordance with familiar precedents. Con
gress, on several occasions, has altered the ratio of
value between gold and silver, in order to estab
lish it more nearly in accordance with the actual
ratio of value between the two metals.
In financial legislation every measure in the di
rection of greater fidelity in the discharge of pe
cuniary obligations, has been found by experience
to diminish the rates of interest which debtors are
required to pay, and to increase the facility with
which money can be obtained for every legitimate
purpose. Our own recent financial history shows
how surely money becomes abundant whenever
confidence in the exact performance of moneyed
obligations is established.
WAR DEPARTMENT.
The secretary ot war reports that the expendi
tures of the war department for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1880, were §39,924.773.03. The
appropriations for this department for the cur
rent fiscal year, amount to $41,993,630.40.
With respect to the army, the.secretary invites
attention to the fact that its strength is limit
ed by statute (section 1,115, revised statutes) to
not more than3o,ooo enlisted men. hut that pro
visos contained in appropriation bills have limited
expenditures to the enlistment of but 25,000. It
is believed the full legal strength is the least pos
sible force at which the present organization can
be maintained, having in view efficiency, disci
pline and economy. While the enlistment of this
force would add somewhat to the appropriation
for pa;y of the army, the saving made in other re
spects would be more than an equivalent for this
additional outlay and the efficiency of the army
would be largely increased.
The rapid extension of the railroad system west
of the Mississippi river, and the great tide of sel
lers which has flowed in upon new territory, im
pose on the military an entire change of policy
The maintenance of small p sts along wagon and
stage routes of travel is no longer necessary.
Permanent quarters at points selected, of a more
substantial character than those heretofore con
structed, will be required. Under existing laws,
permanent buildings cannot be erected without
the sanction of congress, and when sales of mili
tary sites and buildings have been authorized, the
moneys received have reverted to the treasury,
ami could only become available through anew
appropriation. It is recommended that provis
ion be made, by a general statute, for the sale of
such abandoned military posts and buildings as
are found to he unnecessary, and for the applica
tion of the proceeds to the construction of other
posts. While many of the present posts are of
but slight value for military purposes, owing to
the changed condition of the country, their occu
pation is continue lat great expense and incon
venience, because they afford the only available
shelter for troops.
The absence of a large number of officers of
the line, in active duty from their regiments, is a
serious detriment to the maintenance of the
service. The constant demand for small detach
ments, each of which should be commanded by a
commissioned officer for necessary service away
from their commands, occasions a scarcity in the
number required for many company duties. With
a view to lessening this drain to some extent, it
is recommended that the law authorizing the de
tail of officers from the active list as professors
of tactics and military science at certain colleges
and universities, be so amended as to provide that
all such details be made from the retired list of
the army.
Attention is asked to the necessity of provid
ing by legislation for organizing, arming and
disciplining the active militia of the country, and
liberal appropriations are reecomended in this be
half. The reports of the adjutant general of the
army and the chief of ordinance touching this
subject fully set forth its importance.
The report of the officer in charge of edu
cation in the army shows that there are seventy
eight schools now in operation in the army, with
an aggregate attendance of 2,305 eniisted men
and children. The secretary rccomends the en
listment of one hundred and fifty schoolmasters
with the rank and pay of commissary sergeants.
An appropriation is needed to supply the judge
advocates of the army with suitable libraries, and
the secretary recomends that the corps of judge
advocates be placed upon the same footing as to
promotion, with the other staff corps of the army.
Under the existing laws the bureau of military
justice consists of one officer the judge advocate
general, and the corps of judge advocates, of
eight officers of eoual rank (majors), with a pro
vision that the limit of the corps shall remain at
four, when reduced by casualty or resignation to
that number. The consolidation of the bureau
of military justice, and the corps of judge Advo
cates, upon the same basis with the other staff
corps of the ann3', would remove an unjust dis
crimination against deserving officers, and sub
serve the best interests of the service.
NATIONAL DEFENSES.
Especial attention is asked to the report of the
chief of engineers upon the condition ot our na
tional defenses. From a personal inspection of
many of the fortifications referred to, the secreta
ry is able to emphasize the recommendations
made, and to state that their incomplete and de
fenseless condition is discreditable to the country.
While other nations have been increasing their
means for carrying on offensive warfare and at
tacking maritime cities, we have Teen dormant
in preparation for defense; nothing of imj/ortance
has been done towards strengthening and finish
ing our casemated works since our late civil war.
during which the great guns of modem warfare
and the heavy armor of modem fortifications
and ships came into use among the nations, and
our earthworks left, by a sudden failure of appro
priations some years since, in all stages of incom
pletion. are now being rapidly destroyed by the
elements.
INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT.
The two great rivers of the North American
continent, the Mississippi and the Columbia-, have
their navigable waters vrhollv within the liaiits of
the I nited State®, and are of vast importance to
our internal and foreign commerce. Tire perma
nency of the important work on the South. Pa-s
of the Mississippi seems now to be assured. There
has been no failure whatever in the maintenance
of the maximum channel dnririg the six nnnth
ended August 9 last. This experiment ha-open
ed a broad deep highway to the ocean, ai .Pis an
improvement, up.ai the permanent success of
which congratulations may be exchanged among
people abroad and at home, and especially among
the communities of the Mississippi valley, whose
commercial exchanges float in an unobstructed
channel safely to anil from the sea.
A comprehensive improvement of the Mississip
pi mid its tributaries is a matter of transcendent
importance. These great water-ways comprise a
system of inland transportation spread like net
work over a large portion of the United States,
and navigable to the extent of many thousands of
miles. Producers and consumers alike have a com
mon interest in such unequaled facilities for cheap
transportation. Geographically, commercially and
politically they are the strongest tie between the
various sections of the country. These channel
of communication and interchange are the proper
ty of the nation. Its jurisdiction is paramount
over their waters, and the plainest principles ot
public interest require their intelligent and careful
supervision, with a view to their protection, im
provement, and the enhancement of their useful
ness.
The channel ot the Columbia river, for a dis
tance of about one hundred miles from its mouth,
is obstructed by a succession of bars, which Occa
sion serious delays in navigation, and heavy ex
pense for lighterage and towage. A depth of at
least twenty feet at low tide should be secured ami
maintained, to meet the requirements of the ex
tensive and growing inland and'ocean,commerce it
subserves. The most urgent need, however, for
this great water-way, is a permanent improve
merit of the channel at the mouth of the river.
From Columbia river to San Frandsfcb, a dis
tance of over 600 miles, there is no harbor-on our
Pacific coast, which can be approached during
Stormy weather. An appropriation ol Slob,ooo
was made by the forty-fifth congress for the com
mencement of a breakwater and nartor of refuge,
to be located at some point between the Straits ot
Puea and San Francisco, at which the necessities
of commerce, local and general, will be best accom
modated. The amount appropriated is thought to
be quite inadequate for the purpose intended. The
cost of the work, when finished, will he very great,
owing to the want of natural advantages for a site
at any point on the coast between the designated
limits, and it has not been thought to he advisabh
to undertake the work without a larger appropri
ation. I commend the mutter to the attention of
congress.
The completion of the new building for the war
department is urgently needed, and the estimates
for continuing its construction are especially re
commended.
THE ARMY MEDICAL MUSEUM.
The collections of books, specimens. and record
constituting the Army Medical MuscnJ. and li
brary are of national importance. The library
now contains about 51,500 volumes and 57,00il
pamphlets relating to medicine, surgery, and al
lied tonics. The contents of the Army Medical
Museum consist of 22,000 specimens, ami are
unique in the completeness with which both mili
tary surgery and the diseases of armies are illus
rated. Their .mid be an irreparable
loss, not only to the United States, but to the
world. There are filed in the record and pension
division over 16,000 bound volumes of hospital
records, together with a great quantity of papers
embracing the original records of the hospitals
of our armies during the civil war. Aside
trom their historical value, these records are daily
needed in the settlement of large number of pen
sion end other claims, for the protection of the
government against attempted frauds, as well as
tor the benefit of honest claimants. These valu
able collections are now in a building which is pe
culiarly exposed to the danger of destruction by
fire. It is therefore earnestly recommended that
an appropriation be made for a fire-proof build
ing, adequate for the present needs and reasonable
future expansion of these valuable collections.
Such a building should be absolutely fire-proof;
no expenditure for mere architectural display is
i required. It is believed that a suitable structure
can be erected at a cost not to exceed ■s2. £ o,t)flu.
A PLACE FOR GRANT. M
I commend to the attention of congress the
great services of the commander-in-chief of our
armies during the war for the Union, whose wise,
firm, and patriotic conduct did so much tabbing
that momentous conflict to a close. The.legisla
tion of the United States contains many preced
ents for the recognition of distinguished military
merit, authorizing rank and emoluments to he
conferred for eminent services to the country. An
act of congress authorizing the appointment of a
captain-General of the army, with suitable pro
visions relating to compensation, retirement,
and other details, would, in my judgment,
be altogether fitting and proper, and would he
warmly approved by the country.
THE NAVY.
The report of the secretary of tiie navy exhibit.-
die successful and satisfactory management of
that department during the last fiscal year. The
total expenditures for the year were £ 12,1)10.-
639.45, having unexpended at the close of the year
$2,141,682.23 of the amount of available appro
priations. The appropriations for the present
fiscal year ending June JO, 1881, are $15,995,-
061.45; and the total estimates for the next fiscal
year ending June JO, 1882, are $15,953,751.61.
The amount drawn by warrant from July 4, 18H0,
to November 1, 1880, is $5,041,570.45.
The recommendation of the secretary of the
navy, that provisions be made for the establish
ment of some form of civil government Tor the
people of Alaska, is approved. At the present
there is no protection of persons or property in
that territory, except such as is afforded by the
officers of the United States ship Jamestown.
This vessel was dispatched to Sitka, because of
the fear that, without the immediate presence of
the national authority, there was impending dan
ger of anarchy. The steps taken to restore order
have been accepted in good faith by both white
and Indian inliabitants, and the necessity for thi
method of restraint does not, in my opinion now
exist. If, however, the Jamestown should be
withdrawn, leaving the people, as at present, with
out the ordinary, judicial, and administrative
authority of organized local government, serious
consequences might ensue.
The laws provide only for the collection of rev
enue, the protection of public property, and the
transmissions of the mails. The problem is to
supply a local rule for a population so scattered
and so peculiar in its origin and condition. The
natives are reported to be teachable and self-sup
porting, and, if properly instructed, doubtless
would advance rapialy in civilization, and anew
factor of prosperity would be added to the nation
al life. I, therefore, recommend the requisite
legislation upon this subject.
The secretary of the navy has taken steps to
wards the establishment of naval coaling-stations
at the isthmus of Panama, to meet the require
ments of our commercial relations with central
and south America, which are rapidly g’.-owing in
importance. Locations eminently suitable, both
as regards our naval purposes and the uses of com
merce, have been selected, one on the east side ot
the isthmus, at Cluriqui Lagoon, in the Carib
bean sea, and the other on the Pacific coast, at
the bay of Golfito. The only safe harbors, suffi
ciently commodious, on the isthmus, are at these
points, and the distance between them is less than
one hundred miles. The report of the secretary
of the navy concludes with valuable suggestion
with respect to the building up of our merchant
marine service, which deserve the favorable con
sideration of congress.
THE POSTAL SERVICE.
The report of the postmaster general exhibits
the continual growth and the high state of effi
ciency of the postal service. The operations of
