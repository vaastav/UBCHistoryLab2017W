BLOOMSBURG:
Saturday Morning, Doc. 10,1064.
Peace and its'Enemles.
When wc consider tbo antecedents aud
present composition of tho Administration
party, its rcmarkablo blood thirs tineas is
something rcniarlc'ablo. Old blue light
Federaliila, who in 1812 opposed the war
xvith England as unjust and iniquitous,
ana'gavo whatever influence they posoned
to oonuemn it, aro now fierco trumpeters
t. :si ..i ... s i
knifa against tboso that formerly it wis
considered a prido lo call our countrymen.
Old Lino Whigs, who in 1840 denounced,
the war with Mexico as a pro. slarcry
scheme, and unholy, God defying crusade
against a weaker llcpublio and besought
Mexicans to "welcomo our army with
hloody hands to bospitablo graves," are
now clamoring for daughter as though
thoy bad been born in tho shamblos
Members of'pcaco societies, who a few
ycara ago, through press and pulpit, thun
dered their anathemas against all wars,
dsfousivo and offensive, as contrary to Di
vine commands and Christian spirit, and
urged tho immediate conversion of swrds
info ploughshares and spears into prun
ing hooks, are now tho. most ardent vota
ries of tho God of war,and have conceived
a sudden affection for grape, oannister and
Dahlgrecn guns an admiration that is
marvellous and quite refreshing lo behold.
Consistent members of the Church who a
littlo wbilo ago, like Undo Toby, would
not hava harmed a buzzing fly, who listen
with proper dovolion Sabbath after Sab
bath to tbo ambassadors of Him whose
con ing was announced by the angel's song,
'Pcaoc on earth and good will toward
mon," who bade Peter put up tho sword
drawn in self-defense and said 'Blessed
are tti3 peace makers for they shall bo call
cd.tho children of God," even those peo
ple, the very lalt of tbo earth, the richest
cream from tho milk of human kindness,
now breath out throatenings and scream
for fresh heaps of slain.
Mon who, in their own proper persona,
would Mccivc a cowhiding with perfect
cqpanamity, a kick, as a- fundamental com
pliment, and, if smitten on one oheek(
would proceed to offer the other, have,
apparently, been bitten with some milita
ry tarantula, and aro now for a war to
tbo bitter end without compromise, with
out negotiation, and until every slave is
froe.
Fair ladies, to, who would shrink at
the sight ot a bpider, and faint in the
presence of a hostilo mouse dear daugh
ters, ot EyE, whose only artillery, should
bo bright smiles whose only warfare the
roses, of York and Lancaster 'fighting, for
mastory on cheek and brow these, also,
have thrown their-gloves and scissors into
the scale, forgotten the service of Venus
in tbo charm of Mars, and joinod in tbo
chorus shouting, like the Roman luulti
tude, ('Delcnda est Carthago!"
We hopo theso people will be condstont
Tbo moat of them have been content to
imitate tho war horse of Job, .and "smell
tbo battle afar off. We pray thom to re
form in' this respcct.and having reoommen
ded steel, and. gunpowdor as a panacea for
car national ills, that thoy nou proceed
to swallow their own mcdicino. Let them,
when drafted, not buy a poor African to
atop bullets in their stead, but chceifully
proceed to tho field of battlo by tho first
train ; and finally let them not listen to
syren song of po&co, such as has been
ringing through tbo avenues or tho capi
tal. It is but a trick of tbo beaten eno-
my, irjMig ucbuhh i.uCu. .uw (

Tell Mr. Lincoln to stop bis cars and j
harden Lis heart, and to insist upon war,'
war-eternal war,until the South ia wiped
out of existonco. J

Gibbon tells us that tbo ancient Scy
thians worshipped ,a8 their Doity , a drawn
sword. Having followed thoir example,
see to it-that the rays of your glittering

of white-winged Poaoo.
Tlie President's Message.
We this wcok publish a snynopsii of
President Linooln's third annual message.
Its languago is moro dignified and leas
wandering aad obscure than that of last
year's Messago, and its tone ia moro sub
dued and lcaa suggestive of an effort to
create melodramatic effects. Neverthe
less, it is yaguo and superficial. It deals
carelessly, with tboso points that are of
paramount-interest to tho publio, and evin-
cesno stateimanlike analysis of the politi
oal situation. It shoda no ray of hopo
upon the futuro. Perusing it with a vague
expectation of finding somo oluo tbat may
lead out of the dismal labyrinths of inter
actional dissonsion, tbo patriot will put it

Maryland, Like another foul epirit, being
driven out, it may seek lo tear her, but it
will woo her no moro. At the laht so sion
of Congicse a proposed auie'ndment of tlni
CoiiBtitutiou abolishing slavery throughout
tho United States passed tho Senate, but
failed for lack of tho requisitu two-third
vote iu thc Houso of Ilirpruaeotatives. Al
though the present is too same Congress,
and nearly the same members, and with
out questioning the wisdom aud patriotism
of those who stood in opposition, I ven
ture to recommend tho reconsideration
and passage as tho measure- at the present
session. Of oourse tbo abstract question
ia nut changed, but an intervening election
shows almost certainly tbat tbo next Con
gress will pass tho msasuro if this does not.
tlcnce, thero is only a question of timoaa
to when the pioposcd amendment could
; go to tbo States for their action, and as it
! is to so go at all events, may wo not agreo
; llat the sooacr the better ? It is not claim
yumj aUj mituui iiiuu, aa ,iu uuuutouai
element to be considorod. thoir iud'inent
may bo aflectcd by it. It is tho voico of
the people, now for tbo first time heard
upon the question. In a groat national
oriia like ours, unanmity ol action among
' thoso seeking a oommon end, is very do -
sirable almost indisneusablo. and vet no
annrnaoli to annli nnanimirtr in ollninnt.ln
unless somo deference shall be paid to tho
will of tho majority, simply beoauso it is
tho will of tho majority. In this caso tho

Uuion, aud among the uicsud to toouro ihe
end, sucn will, through the election, ia
