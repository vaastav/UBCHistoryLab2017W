The President's Message.
The first miesageot President Harrison was
r-*ad in both bcuscs of Congress on Tuesday.
It is well written but thoroughly Republican
in its tone.
It first reviews our foreign relations and
recognizes the importance of the Pan-Ameri
can Conference with the representatives of
thirty-three nations.
A treaty with G:cal Britain enlarging the
list of extraditable offences is recommended.
The recognition of the new republic of
Brazil is said to be deferred until the people
of that country have given their complete as
sent thereto.
The Pres'deut says that a general condi
tion ofprosperiiy prevails within our borders,
promising a succctsful season to the merchant
and manufacturer and general employment
of our working people.
He estimates tbal the receipts over expen- '
dilures for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1801, will be over forty three million dollars
or even more. He calls the attention of Con
gress especially to this fad, as showing the
necessity of reducing the receipts of the i
treasury to the needs of the government. He
goes oyer much the same ground taken hy i
President Cleveland, with this difference.— |
President Harrison suggests a revision of the 1
tariff by which its inequalities may be reme- i
died but its protective features maintained.— |
To accomplish this he advocates higher tariff i
duties on some articles, to prevent their im
portation and thereby decrease the amount j
annually collected by the Government, lie j
does not recommend any reduction whatever '
in the war taxes still paid on the necessaries j
of life by the people of Ibis country.
President Cleveland, on the other hand, re- |
commended such a revision and tquluizalloii |
of the tariff as would reduce the cost of living i
without materially impairing the profits of
our manufacturers or prevent them from
competing with foreign-made goods.
President Harrison recommends the put
ting on the free list classes of articles not
made in this country and the removal of the
tax on tobacco and on whisky used in the
arts. This is merely a repetition of the Chica
go Republican platform, demanding free
whisky and tobacco, rather than cheaper
clothing and tin.
His views on the silver question are rather
misty and calculated to give offence to no one.
fie is somewhat indisposed to any considera
ble increase in the present rale of coinage, and
thinks favorably of Secretary Windom’s plan
to hold silver in bulk in the treasury rather
than coin, Hie conversion of the silver into
coin being expensive, and the coin not need
ed for circulation.
He urges large appropriations for coast de
fences.
He recommends that protection lie given
to federal officials and witnesses in federal
courts.
He alleges that the colored population in
parts of the country—meaning especially the
Southern Stales—"is deprived of any (flee
live exercise of their political rights and of
many of their civil rights." He asserts that
the general government has the power to
take the whole direction and control of the
election of members of the House of Repre
sentatives. This is a dangerous doctrine and
will lie resisted to the utmost hy a united
Democratic parly. It would utterly destroy
the rights of Slates to control their own af
fairs, and result in the end iu substituting a
tyrannical supervision of elections hy federal
officials, prolcced hy bayonets, which would
restore the worst evils of the reconstruction
period, and destroy that freedom for which
the blood of revolutionary patriots was shed.
It is, doubtless, a favorite scheme of Presi
dent Harrison hy which the Republican party
may he kept in power indefinitely hy the
negro voters of the South.
The message also advocates the payment
of subsidies to foreign sleamship lines, rather
than encouragement to other countries to
deal with us hy reason of the cheapness of the
goods we have to offer them.
Taken altogether, it is the expression of u
partisan, looking iu all things to the perpe
tuation of power in the hands of bis own
parly and differs widely from the patriotic
and unselfish utterances of President Cleve
land.

The Organization of Congress.
The 51st Congress assembled at noon on
Monday, Hon. Thomas B Reed, Republican,
of Maine, having been elected Speaker. The
Democrats cast their votes for Hon. John G.
Carlisle, of Kentucky. Vice President Mor
ton presided over the Senate. Edward A.
McPherson, of Pennsylvania, wjis elected
Clerk of the House ; A. J. Holmes, of lowa,
Sergeanwu-arms, C, A. Adams, of Maryland,
Doorkeeper; James L. Wheat, of Wisconsin,
Postmaster.
The Republican programme was carried
out without a break until the lime came to
elect a chaplain. Rev. Charles B. Ramsdell
was the choice of the Republicans. The
Democrats nominated Rev. Mr. Milhurn, Hie
blind preacher, who lias been chaplain of the
House for many years. A sufficient number
of Republicans broke away from the caucus
resolutions ami uniting with the Democrats
elected him. The office pays fOOO a year and
requires about five minutes’ attendance on the
days when Congress is in session. This fact
shows by.what a slight tenure the Republicans
hold the House, and does not argue well for
their success in carrying political schemes
through the House against the powerful
Democratic minority.
Contrary to expectations the new Demo*
cratic members were sworn iu without oppo
sition.
In Hie drawing for scats Hon. Herman
Slump was fortunate enougli to secure a seat
lu the second row, in front of the speaker.
The Democratic caucus of the membeis of
the House endorsed the principles of tariff re
form, as embraced iu President Cleveland’s
message and in the St. Louis Democratic
platform, pledging themselves to renew and
continue the contest for a reduction of the
war taxes begun and prosecuted hy the
Democrats in former Congresses.
Very little work will probably he done be
fore the Christmas holidays.
—A great fire occurred in Boston, Mass., on
Thanksgiving Day, involving a loss of from
six millions to eight millions of dollars. The
fire raged for six hoars and burned over two
acres of ground covered with splendid busi
ness buildings. The district burned over is
near that of the great fire of 1872. It is some
what remarkable that the fire originated in a
new stone building, which was supposed to
have been fire-proof, hut which burned like
tinder, though a driving rain storm was pre
vailing.
