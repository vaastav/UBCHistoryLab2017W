thought proper to lend his high position to the
reiteration of misrepresentation organised for
him by the Republican press. He hsd the high
est regard for the President, believing him to
be an honest and patriotic man. It was a mat
ter of profound regret that the President should
|>crmit himself to bean Instrument In the bands
of an ultra wing of the Republican party.
. GARFIELD REPLIES.
Mr. Garfield replied to Mr. Wood, He char
acterised it as very unusual to Interrupt the or
dinary form of proceeding, which was almplv to
refer the President’s message and order <ta
E tinting, by debating anv of Ita suggestions, and
e thought the kind of suggestions made by the
gentleman from Now York as still more unu
sual. The exact language of that part of
the message with which the gentleman found
fault was not, In his (Garfield's) mind, out the
gentleman's language was very plain. He
(Wood) criticised certain rcfcrcncrs in the Presi
dent's message os to some disturbances In the
course of the Federal election in several States,
contrasted that with what ho chose to coll the
noble beginning of the Administration In favor
of self-government, end said that the President
has shown vacillation, becouso lie had seen fit
to refer to the disturbances in the Federal elec
tion. If the right of a State to attend to its
own local concerns undisturbed was in any wa”
Inconsistent wltti the right of the National
Government to attend to National elections,
and if ttiat was what the gentleman called
vacillation, he honed thov should all " vacillate "
in (hat way. lie (Garfield) had never made
himself a particular advocate or defender of
any Administration for Its vacillation or want
of vacillation, but, if the gentleman
(Wood) could make bo better case
against the Administration than ho had made,
he had not very well " opened the ball " this
winter. That gentleman could not see that
there had been any disturbance in matters uf
election, after s pause, except in his own State.
He (Wood) had sccu some signs. If not of dis
turbance, at least of vacillation, in the city of
bis adoption and In bis State, but they were not
such instances of vacillation as the gentleman
would have brought up fn discussion. Itdld not
slgnflv that the gentleman had not seen any dis
turbances elsewhere. If tbo President had seen
them It was the President's duty to say so,
and the President had said so In his message. If
the President had seen them and had not said
so, ho would not onir have been guilty of negli
gence, but of positive fault. The President had
referred to it modestly. Ho had invited the at
tention of Congress to It. Did the gentleman
object to having attention pointed to It in that
wavf Had hcor any gentleman on thcotherilde
any reason why he did not wish the attention of
Congress pointed to elections in Southern
States? For his own part, bo welcomed such
colling of attention.
The President ought to be thanked for It by
the gentleman.from New York, as it afforded an
opportunity to him to have this “vacillation ”
examined Into closely. Ho (Garfield) had had
the impression made on his mind from a some
what careful reading of the nubile Journals that
very considerable illegal disturbance bad taken
place in some of the Southern Stales. He had
even heard it atated that bold, open, acknowl
edged Intimidation had been employed, notabtv
In South Carolina, and In districts where
there had been an overwhelming majority of one
political party no sign of any such majority
bad appeared at all. This might be
exaggeration, but, 11 so, It was one
that was broadcast through the public
press, and one which Congress, so notable os
tbc present one for Investigating all charges
of wrongdoing, sbquld Investigate. Ho sup
posed bis friends on tbo other side would wel
come the President's suggestion os exactly In
tho lino of their conduct hitherto. Jlc hoped
they would not stifle Investigation.
A WORD MORE FROM WOOD.
Mr. Wood defended tbe position be had taken,
and repeated his expression of regret that tiio
President had picked out two cases and deemed
them of sufficient Importance to present them
to the'world In his annual message. It was an
indication that the ultra wing of tho Repub
lican party was forcing tbo Executive to aid It
la displaying the bloody shirt, so tbat party
could hold on to its ill-gotten power, and con
tinue that power by the pluodcr of the Treas
ury.
MR. HALS'S REMARKS.
Mr. Halo said >twos alleged by tho gentleman
from New York that the President Had been
dragooned by tho radical wing of the Republic
an party into tbo course Indicated by bis mes
sage. and that wing of tbc party was likely to
control tho Administration. He would tell the
Scntlcroan that on the groat and fundamental
octrlnea of tho protedlun ofthc citizen lu all
hit rights there was no radical nor conservative
wing In tho Republican party, but there was one
party In the land united to a man on tho propo
sition that the American citizen, North, South,
and everywhere, should bo protected lu tho oxer
clso of hla constitutional rights.
Mr. Cox (N. Y.) asked if tho gentlemen from
Ohio aud Maine failed to remember how the
"tape-worm ticket" of California bad been run
by tbo Navy-Yard. Had they denounced tho
tape-worm policies! Not much. He (Cox)
shrunk from no investigation of tbe elcctluu
North or South.
OTHER REMARKS.
Mr. Townsend (N. Y.) made some remark
which was not beard by Mr. Cox or tho report
ers, but at which some members around him
laughed.
Mr. Cox noticed it, and said ho did not know
what they weru laughing at, but it was possi
bly for tho want of thought.
Mr. Townsend said he had been making a re
mark about 41 cipher telegrams."
Mr. Cox retorted that that was another of the
vacillations of tbo other side, that there were
44 vacillations" all over tho country, but that
with all theso "vacillations" tho old Demo
cratic party would have tbe next tienatu and
House also.
The discussion, which was animated, here
closed, and Wood's motion to. refer aud print
tbe message was agreed to.

THE NATION.
ICeuage of the President of the
United States.
JVlouhCMlu/u of (fu StnaU and IToutt of Hrp •
ruentaUvu: Our heartfelt gratitude ts due to
tbe Divine Being who bolds In His bands tho
destinies of nations, for tbo continual bestowal,
during tbo last year, of countless blessings up
on our conotrr.
Wo are at peace with all other nations. Our
public credit has greatly Improved, and is, per
haps, now stronger thou ever before. Abund
ant harvests have reworded the labors of those
who till tbe soil, our manufacturing Industries
arc reviving, and It la believed thatgeucral pros
perity, which has been so-long anxiously looked
for, Is at last within our reach.
TIIE YELLOW-FEVER.
The enjoyment of health by our people gener
ally has, however, been interrupted, during the
paat aeasoo, by the prevalence of a fatal pesti
lence, the yellow-fever, in lumo portions of the
Southern Stales, creating an emergency which
called for promptuod extraordinary meoaureaof
relief. The diacaae appeared aa au epidemic at
New Orleans, and at other placea on the Lower
Mississippi, toon after raldaummer. It waa
rapidly spread by fugitives from the Infected
dtlea and towns, and did not disappear until
early In November. The States of Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Tennessee have suffered se
verely. About 100,000 cases are be
lieved to have occurred, of which about
20,000, according to intelligent estimates,
proved fatal. It is Impossible to estimate with
any approach to accuracy the loss to the coun
try occasioned by this epidemic. It ia to be
reckoned by the hundred millions of dollars.
The suffering and destitution that resulted ex
cited the deepest sympathy in all parts of the
Union. Physicians and nurses hastened from
from every quarter to the . assistance of the
afflicted communities. Voluntary contributions
of money and supplies, in every needed form,
were speedily and generously famished. The
Government was able to respond In some meas
ure to the call for help, by provldlug tents, med
icines, and food for tho sick and destitute,—the
requisite directions for tbe purpose being given
In the confident expectation that tbla action of
the Executive would receive tbe sanction of
Congress. About 1,800 tents, and rations of
the value of about 935,010, were sent to the cit
ies and towns which applied for them,—full de
tails of which will be furnished to Congress by
tbe proper Department.
The tearful spread of this pestilence hasawsk
ened a very general public aeutlmeut In favor of
national sanitary administration, which shall
not only control quarantine, but have the sani

tbo State and Municipal health authorities, with
power to deal with whatever endanger* the pub
lic health, and which the Municipal and State
authorities are unable to regulate. The Na
tional Quarantine act approved April 20, 1873,
which was passed 100 late In the last session of
Congress to provide tbo means for carrying It
Into practical operation during the past season,
Is a step in the direction here indicated. In
view of the necessity for the most effective
measures, by quarantine and otherwise, for the
protection of our seaports, end the country gen
erally, from this and other, epidemics, It is
recommended that Congress give to the whole
subject early and careful consideration.
SUFFRAGE AT TIIF. SOUTH.
Tho permanent pacification of the country by
the complete protection of oil citizens In every
civil and political right, continues to boot par
amount Interest with the great body of our
people. Every sten In this direction is wel
comed with public anproval, and every Interrup
tion of steady and nnlform progress to the de
sired consummation awakens general uneasiness
and wide-spread condemnation. Tho recent
Congressional elections havo furnished a direct
and trustworthy test of the advance thus far
made in the practical establishment of the right
of suffrage secured by the Constitution to the
liberated race In the Soutbcrn States. All dis
turbing Influences, real or Imaginary, bad been
removed from all of these States.
The three Constitutional Amendments, which
conferred freedom and equality of civil and po
litical rights upon tho colored people of the
Soutt), were adopted by the concurrent action
of the great body of good citizens who main
tained the outhority of the National Govern
ment and tbo Integrity and perpetuity of tho
Union at such a cost of treasure and life, as a
wise and necessary embodiment In tho organic
law of the just reanlla of the War. Tho people
of tho former SlavcholdlngStatcs accepted these
results, and gave, la every practicable form, as
surances that tbo Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and
Fifteenth Amendments, and laws passed In pur
suance thereof, should, In good faith, be en
forced, rigidly and Impartially, In letter and
spirit, to the end that tbo humblest citizen,
without distinction of race or color, should, un
der them, receive full ami equal protection in
person and property and In {political rights and
privileges. By these Constitutional Amend
ments, tho Southern section of tho Union
obtained a large Increase of political power in
Congress and In tbo Electoral College; and tbo
country Justly expected that elections would
proceed, as .to the enfranchised race, upon the
same circumstances of legal and constitutional
freedom and protection which obtained In all
the other States of tbe Union. The friends uf
law and order looked forward to the conduct of
these elections as offering to the general Judg
ment of the countrv an Important opportunity
to measure tho degree In which tho right of
suffrage could bo exercised by tbo colored peo
ple, and would be respected by their fellow
citizens; but a more general enjoyment of
freedom of suffrage by the colored people, and
a more Just and generous protection of that
freedom by the communities of which they form
a part, were generally anticipated than the rec
ord of tho elections discloses. In soma of those
States In which the colored people have been un
able to make their opinions felt in tho elections,
tbc result Is mainly duo to Influences not easily
measured or remedied by legal protection; but,
in the States of Louisiana and South Carolina at
large, and In some particular Congressional dis
tricts outside of those States, tho records of the
elections seem to compel tho conclusion that the
rights of the colored voters have been over
ridden, and their participation In the elections
not permitted to be cither genera) or free.
It wilt bo for tiie Congress for which these
elections were hold to make such examinations
into their conduct os may be appropriate to de
termine tbo validity of the claims of members to
their scats. In tho meanwhile. It becomes tho
duty of the Executive and Judicial Departments
of tho Government, each In Its province, to In*
quire Into and punish violations of the laws of.
the United States which have occurred. 1 can
but repeat what I sold In this connection In my
last message, that whatever suthorityrests with
me to this cud 1 shall not hesitate to put
forth; and 1 am unwilling to fore
go a renewed appeal to the Legis
latures, tbo Courts, tbc Executive authorities,
aad the people of tho States where theso
wrongs have been perpetrated, to give their as
sistance toward bringing to Justice tue offend
ers and preventing a repetition of the crimes.
No means wlthlu my power will bo spared to
obtain a full and fair Investigation of tho alleged
crimes, and to secure tbe conviction end punish
ment of tbe guilty.
It la to bo observed that tbe principal appro
priation made for tho Department uf Justice at
tbo last session contained tho following clause:
"And for defraying the expenses which may bo
Incurred in the enforcement ot the act approved
Fob. 88,1871, entitled 4 An act to amend an act
approved May 80, 1870, entitled An act to en
force tho rights of citizens of tbe United States
to vote in the several States of tho Union, and
for other purposes,' or unv acts amendatory
thereof or supplementary thereto."
It Is the opinion ni tho Attorney-General that
the expenses of these proceedings will largely
exceed the amount which was thus provided,
and 1 rolv confidently upon Congress to make
adequate appropriations to enable tbo Executive
Department to enforce tho laws.
1 respectfully urge upon your attention that
tho Congressional elections In every district, in
a very important sense, are Justly a matter of
political interest and concern throughout tbo
whole country. Koch State, every political
party, ts entitled to the share of power which is
conferred by tiio legal and constitutional suf
frage. It U tno right of every citizen itoasesi
tng tho Quaiifluailoua prescribed by law
to cast one uulnttmlualvd ballot, and
to have his ballot honestly counted.
So lung as the exercise of this power end tho
enjoyment of this right are common and equal,
oraclicully as well us formally, submission to
he results of the suffrage will be accorded loy
ally and cheerfully, and all the departments uf
Government will fee) tbe true vigor uf tho
popular will thus expressed. No temporary or
administrative Interests of Government, how
ever urgent or weighty, will ever displace tho
zeal of our people In defense uf the primary
rights of citizenship. They understand that the
irutectiou of liberty requires the maintenance,
n full vigor, of the manly methods of free
speech, free press, and free suffrage, and will
sustain the full authority of Government to en
force the laws which aie framed to preserve
these Inestimable rights. Thu material progress
and welfare of (he males depend on the protec
tion afforded to their duzen*. There can bo no
peace without such protection, no prosperity
without peace, and the whole country Is deeply
interested in tho growth and prosperity uf ail Its
parts.
While the country has not vet readied com
plete unity of feeling and reciprocal confidence
between the communities so lately and so seri
ously estranged, 1 feel an absolute assurance
Ibat the tendencies are in that direction, and
with increasing force. The power of public
opinion will override all political prejudices and
all sectional or State aitscaments iu demanding
that all over our wide territory thu name and
character of cltisea of thu United States shall
mean one and tbe same thing, and carry with
them unchallenged security and respect.
FOREIGN RELATIONS,
Our relations with other countries continue
peaceful. Our neutrality In contests between
foreign Powers has been maintained and re
spected.
Tho Universal Exhibition held at Paris during
tbe past summer has been attended by a Urge
number of our citixena. Tbe brief period
allowed for tbe preparation and arrangement of
tbe contributions of our dtlxena to this great
Exposition was well employed in energetic and
Judicious efforts to overcome tbla disadvantage.
These efforts, led and directed by tbe Commis
•ioner-Geureal, were remarksblysuccessful, and
tbe exhibition of tbe product# of Americas in
dustry was creditable end gratifying iu scope
and character. The reports of tbe United States
Commissioner!, giving its results in detail, will
be duly laid before you. Our partldpatlou In
this International competition for the favor and
tbe trade of tbe world may be expected to pro
duce useful and Important results, In pro
moting Intercourse, friendship, and commerce
with other nations.
In accordance with the provisions of the act of
Feb. 28, 1878, three Commissioners were ap
pointed to an international Conference on the
subject of adopting a common ratio between
gold and silver, for tbe purpose of establishing,
Internationally, the use of tilmetdllc money,
■nil .ecuting flxltj of rcl.tlre t.luc between
(host* metals.
Invitations were addressed to tho various Gov
ernments which had expressed a willingness to
participate In Its delilicratloas. The Conference
held Its meetings in Paris, In August last. The
report of the Commissioners, herewith submit-
Jed, will show Its results. No common ratio
between gold and silver could be agreed tipon
by Ihe Conference. The general conclusion was
reached, that It is necessary to maintain in the
world tho monetary (unctions of sliver as well
as gold,—leaving the selection of the use of one
or the other of these two metals, or of both, to
be made bv each State.
Congress having appropriated at Its last ses-
Mon the sum rff sV>off,ooo to pay the award of
the Joint Commission ot Halifax, If, after cor
respondence with the British Government on
the subject of the conformity of the award to
the requirements of the Treaty and to the terms
or the question thereby submitted to the Com
mission, the President shall deem It his duty to
make tho payment, communications upon these
points were addressed to the British Govern
ment through the Legation of the United States
atl/ondon. Foiling (o obtain the concurrence
of tho British Government In Urn views of this
Government respecting tho award, 1 have deem
ed It my dutv to tender the sum named within
the year fixed bv the treaty, accompanied bv a
notice of the grounds of the payment, anil a
protest against any oilier construction of the
MR?*. The correspondence upon this subject
will be laid before roa.
The Spanish Government has officially an
nounced the termination of the Insurrection In
Cuba, and the restoration of peace throughout
that Island. Confident expectations are expressed
of a revival of trade and prosperity, which It Is
earnestly Imped may prove well founded. Nu
merous claims of American citizens (or relief for
Injuries or restoration of properly have been
among the Incidents of tho long-continued hos
tilities. Some of these claims are In process of
adjustment by Spain, and tbc others arc prom
ised carlv and careful consideration.
flic treaty made with Italy, In regard to re
ciprocal Consular privileges, baa been duly rati*
fled and proclaimed.
No questions of grave Importance hare arisen
with any other of the European Powers.
Tbe Japanese Government has been desirous
of a revision of such parts of Its treaties with
foreign Powers ns relate to commerce, and, it Is
understood, has addressed to each of the Trcntv
Powers a request to open negotiations with that
view. The United States Government has been
Inclined to regard the matter favorably. What
ever restrictions upou trade with Japan are
found injurious to that people cannot but af
fect injuriously nations bolding commercial In
tercourse with them. Japan, after a long period
uf seclusion, Ims within the past few years made
rapid strides fn the path uf enlightenment and
progress, and, nut unreasonably, is looking for
ward to the time when her relations with the
nations of Europe and America shall bo assimi
lated to those which they hold with each other.
A treaty looking to tiffs’ end has been made,
which will bo submitted for tbe consideration of
tbc Senate.
After an interval of several yean, tho Chinese
Government has again sent Envoys to tbc
United Slates. They have been received, and a
permanent Legation is now .established here by
that Government. It is not doubted that this
step will be nf advantage to both nations in
promoting friendly relations and removing
causes of difference.
The treaty with the Samoan Islands, having
been duly ratified and accepted on tho part of
both Governments, Is now In operation: and a
survey and soundings of the hsrlwr of I’apo-
Fago havo been made by a naval vessel of tho
United Slates, with a view of occupation as a
□aval station, if found desirable to the service.
Since tbu resumption of diplomatic relations
with Mexico, corre«;tondcnco»lias been opened,
and slill continues, between tbc two Govern
ments, upon the various questions which at one
time eccrncd to endanger their relations. While
no formal agreement has been reached as to the
troubles on the border, muvb has been dune to
repress and diminish them. The effective force
of the United State* troopson the Ulo Grande, by
a strict and faithful compliance with Instruc
tions, has done much to remove the sources of
dispute, and it fa now understood that a like
force of Mexican troops on the other side of
tho river is also making so energetic movement
against the marauding Indian tribes. This Gov
ernment looks wltli the greatest satisfaction
upon every evidence of strength fn the national
authority of Mexico, and upon every effort put
forth to prevent or to. punish Incursions unnn
our territory. Reluctant to assume aor action
or attitude In tnc control of those incursions,
by military movements serosa tho border, not
Imperatively demanded for the protection of tho
Uvea ami property of our own citizens, I shall
take the earliest opportunity, consistent with
tbo proper discharge of this Plain dutv, to rec
ognize the ability of >tho Mexican Government
to restrain effectively vtolhtioflsor our territory.
It Is projwsed tobolit next yc«*r an International
Exhibition In Mexico, and It Is believed that the
display of the agricultural and manufacturing
products of the two nations will tend to better
understanding and increased commercial Inter
cuiiasc between tbeir people.
With Brazil, and tho Republics ot Central and
South America, some steps have been taken
toward the development of closer commercial
intercourse. Diplomatic relation* have been re
sumed with Colombia and with Bolivia. A
boundary question between the Argentine Re
public and Paraguay bat been submitted by
those Governments fur arbitration to tbc I’rc.i
-dent of tiio United States, and I have, after
careful examination, given a decision upou it.
A naval expedition up tbe Amazon and Ma
deira Rivera baa brought back Information valu
able both for scientific and commercial pur
jwwes. A like expedition la about visiting tho
coast of Africa aud tbe Indian Ocean. The re
torts of Diplomatic and Consular officers in re
ation to tho development of our foreign com
merce havo furnished many facte that have
proved of public interest, and have stimulated
to practical exertion the enterprise of our peo
ple.
THE TRBAHUIIT.
Tbe report of the Secretary of tbo Treasury
furnishes a detailed statement of the operations
of that Department of the Government, and of
tbo condition of the public finances.
The ordinary revenues from all sources for
tho fiscal year ended June 80, 1878, were $237.*
703,878.70; ttie ordinary expenditure! for the

There bis been, however, a substan

tbe Treasury, Nov. 1,1578, was S2.IXI4,‘JOG, (KM 8.
—a reduction since tbe same date last year of

The progress made during tbe lut year In re
funding tbe public debt at lower rates of inter'

bonds, commonly known as 9-3 Us, to an equal
amuuut, have been or will be redeemed u calls
mature.
It has been tbe policy of the Department to
plscc tbo 4 per cent bonds within easy reach uf
every citizen who desires to invest bis uviogs,
whether small or great, In these securities. Tbo
Secretary of tbo Treasury recommends that tbo
law be so modified that small sums may bo In
vested, and that, through tbe Fost-Olßces or
other agents of tbe Government, tbe freest op
portunity may bo given In all parts of the
country fur such Investments.
Tbo best mode suggested Is, that tbe Depart
ment bo authorised to Issue certllicates of de
posit of the denomination of 910, bearing Inter
est at tbo rate of 3.03 per cent per annum, and
convertible at any time wltblu one year after
their issue into tbe 4 per cent bonds
authorised by tbe Refunding act, and to be
issued only in exchange lor United
Slates notes sent to tbe Treasury by mall
or otherwise. Such a provision of law, support
ed by suitable regulations, would enable aby
person readily, without cost or risk, to convert
bis money into an interest-bearing security of
the United B:atcs: and tho money so received
conirl hcauplied to tho redemption 'of 0 per cent
bonds.
Jcoinage of gold during the last fiscal year
was $ j 3.796.940. The coinage of silver dollars,
under the act passed Feb. 28, 1878, amounted,
on tbo 4M of November, 1878, to 919,814,5C0. of
which amount RLCG/J47 Is In circulation, and
the haiancc, 914,820,1X18, Is stilt In the possession
or the Government.
With views unchanged In regard to the act
under which Urn coinage of silver proceeds. It
has been the purpose of the Secretary faithfully
to execute tbe Jaw, aud to afford a fair trial to
tiio mea-.ure.
Id the present financial condition of thecoun
try, I am persuaded that the welfare of leglll
male business and Industry of every description
will be heat promoted by abstaining from all
attempts to make radical changes in the exist
ing financial Icgulat ion. Let U lie understood
thit during (ho coming \car the business of the
country will be undisturbed by Governmental
Interference with tbc taws affecting it, and wo
may confidently expect Jiiat me resumption ot
specic-pavmcnU, «*hh will lake place at Uio
appointed tunc, wllr be successfully and easily
maintained, and that it will l*j followed by a
healthful and enduring revival of business
prosperity. ,
Let the healing Influence of time, tbe Inherent
energies of our people, and tho boundless re
sources of our country, have a fair opportunity,
and relief from present difficulties will surely
follow.
THE Alt MV.
The report of tho Secretary of War shows
that tbe army has been wetland economically
supplied: that our small force has been actively
employed, and has faithfully performed all tbe
service required of It. The morale of the army
has improved, aud the mitulter of desertions baa
materially decreased during the year.
Tho Secretary recommends:
1. That a pension bo granted to tbe widow of
tbe late Lieut, Henry it. Benner, Eighteenth
Infantry, who lost bis life by yellow fever while
in command of the steamer J. 31. Chambers,
sent with supplies for the relief of sufferers la
the South from that disease.
2. The establishment of the annuity scheme
for tho benefit of Hie heirs of deceased officers,
aa suggested by tbe Paymaster General.
3. The adoption by Congress of a plan for tbe
publication of the records of tbe War uf tbe
Rebellion, now bciug prepared for that purpose.
4. Thu iucreasu ot the extra per-diem of sol
dlvr-lcachers employed in post-schools, and lib
eral appropriations tor tbc erection of buildings
lor schools and libraries at different posts.
5. The repeal oromcndmenl of the act of June
IS, 1978, forbidding the "use of the army as a
posse cumltolus, or otherwise, for the purpose
of executing the laws, except in such cases and
under such circumstances as may be expressly
authorized by tbe Constitution or by act of Con
gress."
0. The passage of a Joint resolution of Con
gress legalizing the Issues uf rations, tents, and
medicines which were made for the relief of
sufferers from yellow fever.
7. That provision be made for the erection of
a fire-proof building for the preservation of cer
tain valuable records, now constantly exposed
to destruction by tire.
These recommendations ore all commended to
your lavorable consideration.
THE NAVY,
The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows
that tbe navy has Improved during the lost fiscal
year. Work has been done on seventy-five ves
sels, ten of which have been thoroughly re
paired and made ready for sea. Two others are
in rapid progress toward completion. Tho total
expenditures of tbo jear, including tbe amount
appropriated for the deficiencies of tbc previous
year, were $17,4(33,392.05. The actual expenses
chargeable to tbe vear, Inclusive of theso de
ficiencies, were $18,300,014.09. or $707,199.16 less
than those of tho nrcvlous year, and $4,938,-
(177.74 less than the expenses. In
cluding tho deficiencies. Tho estimates
fur tho fiscal year ending Juno 30.
1860, arc $14,533.831.45,—exceeding the appro
priations of the present year only $33,949,75:
which excess is occasioned by the demands of
the '■’aval Academy und Marine Corps, as ex
plained in the Secretary's report. The appro
priations lor the present fiscal year ore $14,538.-
431.70, which, in the opinion of tbe Hccrctarv,
will be ample for all the current expenses uf the
Department during the vear. The amount
drawn from the Treasure from July 1 to Nov. 1,
1878. is $4,740,544.14, of which $70,0*9.75 has
been refunded.—leaving a# the expenditure for
that period $4,(509,503,39, or $539,699.24 less than
the corresponding period of tbo lost fiscal year.
THE POST-OFFICE.
Tbc report of the Postinaatcr-Genera) em
braces a detailed statement of tho operations of
the Post-Ofilco Department. The expenditures
of that Department for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1878, were $34,1(55,(184.49. The
receipts, Including sales of stamps,
money-order business, and official
stamps, were $39,277,510.95. Tbe sum uf
$39,436.30, Included In the foregoing statement
of expenditures, ta chargeable to preceding
years, eo that the actual expenditures for the
fiscal vear ended June 30,1878, arc $33,874,047.50.
Tbe amount drawn from the Treasury on up
f roprlutloUß, lu addition to tbc revenuesof tho
lepartment, was $5,307,053.63. The expendi
tures lor the fiscal year ending June BU, 1880,
are estimated at $38,571,900, and tho receipts
from all sources at $30,(534,033.90,— leaving a
deficiency to bo appropriated out of the Treas
ury of $5,907,87(5.10. The report calls attention
to tbe fact that the cum|wnsatioo of Postmas
ters, and of railroads (or carrying tho mail, Is
regulated by law; and that the (allure uf Con
gress to appropriate tho amounts required fur
these purposes docs not relievo the Government
of responsibility, but necessarily increases tho
deficiency Pills which Congress will be called
upon lo pass.
In providing for tho postal service, the follow
lowing questions are presented: Should Con
gress annually appropriate a sum for its ex
penses largely in excess of Its revenues, or
should such rates of postage be established as
will make tbe Department self-sustaining?
Should tbo |tosUl service be reduced bv exclud
ing from the mails matter which docs not pay
Us nay? Should the number of twit-routes be
diminished I Should other methods bo adopted
which will increase the revenue or diminish the
exocnses of the postal service?
The International Postal Congress, which met
at Paris May 1, 1878, and continued In session
until June 4 ol the same year, was composed of
delegates from nearly all tbo civilized countries
of the world. It sdopted a new Convention.—to
take tbe place of the Treaty concluded at
llcrne, Oct. 9,lß74,—which goes into effect on
tbe Ist of April, 1879, between ttio countries
whose delegates nave signed It. It was ratified
and approved, by and with tba consent of the
President, Aug. 13. 1878. A synopsis u( this
Universal Postal Convention will be found lu
tbo report of tho PoUmastcrOcneral, and the
lull text In tbe appendix thermo. In Us origin
the Postal Union comprised twenty-three
countries, having n population of S3O,'OUO I UUO

prise forty-three countries and colonies, with a
population of more than 050,000,090 ol people;
and will soon, by the accession of tho few re
maining countries and colonics which maintain
organised postal services, constitute, lu fast os
welt as in name, us Us new title tunicate*, a
Universal Union, regulating, upon a uniform
basis of cheap |K>stagu-rates, tho postal Inter
course between all civilised nations.
borne embarrassment has arisen out
of (be loufll.t between the cus
toms laws of tbU country and the provisions of
tbo Postal Convention, hi regard to tbe trans
mission of foreign books and newspaper* to this
country by mull, it Is hoped that Congress
will bo able to devise some means of reconciling
the dllHeuliles which bsvo thus been created, so
to do Justice to all parties involved.
THE JUDICIAUY.
The buslucssof the Supreme Court, tod of
tbe Courts in many of the Circuits, has In
creased to such an extent during the just years
tnat additional legislation Is imperative to re
lievo and prevent tbo delay of Justice, and pos
sible oppression to suitors, which are tbus oc
casioned. The Incumbered condition of these
dockets U presented anew In the report
of tbe Attorney-Genera), and tbo remedy
suggested is earnestly uryed fur Con
grcstdomil action. The creation- of addi
tional Circuit Judges, as proposed, would
afford a complete remedy, and would Involve
an expense—at the present rale of salaries—of
not more than lOU.UUU a year.
THE INDIANS.
The annual report of tbe Secretary of tbe In
terior and of the Commissioner of Indian Af
fairs present an elaborate account of tbe prea
cut condition uf tbe Indian tribes, and of that
branch of tbe public aervlce which ministers to
tbclr Interests. Wbilo tbe conduct of tbe Indi
ans, generally, has been orderly, and their rela
tions with their neighbors friendly and peace
ful, two local disturbances have occurred, which
were deplorable in tbclr character, but remain
ed, happily, confined to a comparatively small
number of Indians. Tbe discontent among tbe
Ssuuocks, which led first to some acts of vio
lence on tbo part of some members of tbe tribe.
in<l finally to the outbreak, appears to have
bfen caused I*7 an Insufficiency of food
on the reservations, and this inauftl
rteney to have been owing to the inadequacy of
the appropriation* made by Comtes* to the
wants of the Indiana, at a time when the In
dians were prevented from supplying the de
ficiency by hnntlmr. After an arduous pursuit
by the troopa of tfie United Slates, and several
engagements, the hostile Indians were reduced
to subjection, and the larger part of them sur
rendered themselves os prisoners. In this con
nection, I desire to rail attention to the recom
mendation made hv the Secretary of the In
terior, that a sufficient fund be placed at the
disposal of the Executive, to be used, with
proper accountability, at discretion, In sudden
emergencies of tfae Indian service.
The other case of disturbance was that of a
band of Northern Cheyennes who suddenly left
their reservation In ihc Indian Territory, and
marched rapidly through the States of Kansas
and Nebraska In the direction of their
old hunting-grounds, committing murders
and other crimes on their wav.
Irom documents accompanying the report
of the Secretary of the Interior, it appears that
this disorderly band was as fullv supplied with
the necessaries of life a* the 4,700 other Indiana
who remained quietly on the reservation, and
that the dhturbance was caused by men of resl
, m ••'I? "‘lwhitvous disposition among the In
dians themselves. Almost the whole of this
band have surrendered to the military suthori
tles; and It is a gratifying fact that, when some
?/ taken refuge in the camp of the
Kcd-Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been In
friendly relations, the 9loux held'them as prls
oners, and readily gave them up to the o Ulcers
of the United Slates,—thus giving new proof of
the loyal spirit which, alarming rumors to the
contrary notwithstanding, they have uniformly
shown ever since the wishes they expressed at
the Council of September, 1977, have been com
plied with.
Both the Secretary of the Interior and the
Secretary of War unite in the recommendation
that provision bo made by Congress tor the or
ganization of a corps of mounted “ Indian Aux
iliaries.” to be under the control of the armv,
and to be used for the purpose of keeping the
Indians on their reservations, and preventing or
repressing disturbance on their part. I earnestly
concur In this recommendation. It Is believed
that the organization of such a body of Indian
cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from the Gov
ernment, would considerably weaken the rest
less element among the Indians, by withdraw
ing from It a number of young men and giving
them congenial employment under the Govern
ment,—lt being a matter of experience that In
dians In our service almost without exception
arc faitblul in the performance of the duties as
signed to them. Such an organization would
materially old the army In the accomplishment
of a task for which It* numerical strength Is
sometimes found Insufficient.
13m, while the implorznent of force for the
prevention or repression of Indian troubles Is
of occasional necessity, and wise preparation
should be made to that end, greater reliance
must be placed on humane ana civilizing agen
cies for the ultimate solution of what is called
the Indian problem. It mav be verv difficult,
and require much patient eilort, to' curb tbe
unruly spirit of the savage Indian to the re
straints of civilized life, but experience shows
that it Is not Impossible. .Manv of tbe tribes
which are now quiet, and orderly, and self-sup
porting, were once as savage as any that at pres
ent roam over the plains or lo the mountains of
the Far West, and were then considered inac
cessible to civilizing influences. It may bo Im
possible to raise them fully up to tho level of
the white population of the united States; but
we should not forget that they are the
aborigines of tho country, and called
the soil their own on which our
people have grown rich, powerful, and
happy. We owe It to them as a moral duty to
help them la attaining at least that degree of
civilization which they mav be able to reach. U
Is uot only our duly,—it is also our interest to
do so. Indians who nave become agriculturists or
herdsmen, and fee! an Interest In property, will
henceforth cease to be u warlike and disturbing
element, it Is also a well-authenticated fact
that Indians arc apt to peaceable and quiet when
their catldnsn are at school: and Jam gratified
to know, from the expressions of Indians them
selves, and from manv concurring reports, that
there is a steadily-increasing desire, even among
Indians belonging to comparatively wild tribes,
to have their children educated. I Invite atten
tion to the reports of the Secretary of
the Interior and tbe Commissioner of
Indian Adairs touching the experiment
recently inaugurated, lo taking titty In
dian children, boys and girls, from differ
ent tribes, to the Hampton Normal Agricultural
Institute, In Virginia, where they are to receive
tu elementary English education and training In
agriculture and utner useful work, to be return
ed to their tribes, after the completed course, os
mtcipretero, instructors, and examples, it Is re
ported that the officer charged with the selection
of those ciilldrcn might have had thousands of
young Indians sent with him had it been |>ossi
ble to make provision for them. I agree with
the Secretary of tho Interior in saying that
•• The result of this interesting experiment. If
favorable, may be destined tu imt-ome an impor
tant factor in the advancement of civilization
among the Indians.' 1
T ho question, whether a change in the control
of the Indian service should be made, was, at
the last session of Congress, referred to a Com*
umtve lor inquiry' and report. Without desiring
to anticipate that report, 1 venture to express
the hope that, in tbe decision of so im
portant a question, tbe views expressed
above may not bo lost sight of,
and that tiie decision, whatever it may be, will
arrest further agitation of this subject.—such
agitation being apt to produce a disturbing ef
fect upon tbe service as welt as uu toe Indians
themselves.
TIIE HOT SPRINGS.
In tbe enrollment of the bill making appro
priations for sundry civil expenses, at the last
session of Congress, that portion which pro
vided fur the continuation of the Hot Springs
Commission was omitted. As the Commission
had completed tbe work of taking testimony on
the many conflicting claims, tbe suspension of
their labors before determining tbe rights of
claimants threatened fur a lime to embarrass
tbe Interests, nut only of the (luverument, but
also of a largo number of the citizens of Hut
Springs, who were w aiting for Anal action on
tbe<r claims before beginning contemplated im
provements. in order to prevent serious dull
cullies, which were apprehended, and at the
solicitation of many leading citizens of
ilut Springs, and others Interested in
the weilare of the town, tbo Secretary of tho In
terior was authorized to request the'late Com
missioners to take chaigo ol the records of their
proceedings, sod to perform such work ns amid
properly be dune by them under such circum
stances, to facilitate the future adjudication of
tbo claims at an early day, and to preserve the
status ol tho claimants until their ngnts should
be finally determined. Thu late Commissioners
compiled with that request, and report that tho
testimony lu all the cases has been written nut,
examined, briefed, and so arranged as to faclit-
tatu an early settlement when authorized by
law. it u recommended that Ihu requisite au
thority bu given at as eariy n day In tin session
as possible, and that a fair compensation bu al
low the late Commissioners fur the expense in
curred and tbe labor performed by them since
the tUth of Juno last.
TUB PUIIUC TIMBER.
I Invite the attention of Congress to thu rec
ommendation! made by Ibe Becretury of the
interior with regard to the preservation ol the
timber on the public lands of Ibe yniied States.
The protection of the public pro|*rty is one of
the first dales of the Government. The lie*
psrtmeut ol the Interior should, therefore, be
enabled tv sufficient appioprlatloos to enforce
the laws lit that respect. But this matter ap
pears stilt more Important as a question of pub
lic economy. Thu rapid destruction of our for
ests is an evil fraught with the gravest conse
quences, especially In the mountainous districts,
where the rocky slopes, once denuded of their
trees, will rumaiu so forever. There the injury,
once doue, cannot bo repaired. 1 fully concur
with the Secretary ol the Interior lu thu opinion
that, fur this reason, legislation touching the
public timber In lha mountainous Blaus and
Territories of thu Wist should be especially
well considered, and that existing laws, lu wuicli
thu destruction of the forests U not sufficiently
guarded against, should be speedily modified. A
general law concerning this Important subject
appears to me to be a matter of urgent puuiic
necessity. •
AGRICULTURE.
From the organization ol the Government,
the importance of encouraging, by all possible
means, tbe Increase of our agricultural produc
tions, has been acknowledged and urged upon
tbo attention of Congress and the people aa tbe
surest aud readiest means of Increasing our
substantial and cudurlng prosperity.
The words of Washington are as applicable
to-day as when, In his eighth annual message,
be said: “It U not to be doubted that with ref
erence either to individual or national wel
fare, Agriculture Is of primary importance,
lu proportion as nations advance in
population aud other circumstances of
maturity, this truth becomes mure apparent,
aud renders the cultivation of the soil mure aud
more an object of public patronage. Institu
tions fur promoting It grow up. supported by
Iho public purse: audio what object cauli he
dedicated with greater propriety I Among the
means which have been employed to this end,
none have been attended with greater success
thsn the establishment of Boards composed ot
proper characters, charged with collecting and
diffusing Information, and enabled, by premiums
and small pecuniary aids, to encourage and as
sist the spirit of discovery and Improvement,—
this species ot establishment contributing doubly
to the Increase of Improvement, br stimulating
to enterprise and experiment, and by drawing

f0,0W,000,000. The exuorls of agricultural
products for the year 1877, os appears from the
of L he Bureau of Statistics, were 152*,-
000,000. The great extent of cmintrv. with Us
diversity of soil and climate, enables* us to pro
duce within our own border.*, and by our owu
labor, not only the necessaries, but most of the
luxuries, that arc consumed in civilized coun
tries. Yet, notwithstanding our advantages of
soil, climate, and Intercommunication. It ap
pears, from the statistical statements in the re
port of the Commissioner of Agriculture, that
we import annually from foreign land* many
millions of dollars' worth of agricultural phkl
ucts which could be raised In our own country.
Numerous questions arise In the practice of
advanced Agriculture which can only be an
swered by experiments, often costlv mid some
times fruitless, which are beyond the means of
private individuals, and are a Just nnd proper
charge on the whole Nation for the benefit of
the Nation. It Is good policy, especially In
times ot depression and uncertainty In other
business pursuits, with a vast area of unculti
vated and hence unproductive territory, wisely
opened to homestead settlement, to encourage,
by every proper and legitimate means, the occu
pation and Ullage ot the soil. The efforts of
the Department of Agriculture to stimu
late old and Introduce iuw agricult
ural Industries, to improve the quality
and Increase the qdnntlty of our products,
to determine the value of old or establish ih«
Importance of new methods of culture, are
worthy of your carefnl and favorable considera
tion, and assistance bv such appropriations ol
money and enlargement of facilities as mnv
seem to bo demanded by the present favorable
conditions for the growth and rapid develop
ment of this Important Interest.
The abuse of animals in transit Is widely at
tracting public attention. A National Conven
tion of th»dctlcß specially Interested In the sub
ject has recently met at Baltimore, and tbs
taels developed, both in regard to cruelties tc
animals and tbe effect of such cruelties upon
the public health, would seem to demand the
carelul consideration of Congress, and the en
actment of more efficient laws for tbe pfefeu
tiou of these cruelties.
EDUCATION - .
The report of the Commissioner of the Bureau
of Education shows very gratifying progress
throughout the country In all tho Interests com
mitted lo the care of this important office. The
report Is especially oneouraglog with respect to
the extension of the advantages of the common
school system lo sections of the country where
the general enjoyment of tbe privilege of free

DIHTRICT Of COLUMBIA.
Tbo attention of Congress (s again in*
vJtcd to the condition of the riverfront
of the City of Washington. It is a matter
of vital Importance to thu health of the
residents of the National Capital, both tempo*
rary and permanent, that the low lands in front
of the city, now subject totldal overflow, should
be reclaimed. In their present condition, these
flats obstruct the drainage of the city, and are a
dangerous source of malarial poison. Tns
reclamation will improve the navigation of th<
river by restricting and consequently deepening
Its channel: and Is alto of Importance* when
considered in connection with the extension ol
the public ground, and tbe enlargement of tlu
park, west and soutn of tbo Washington monu
ment. The report of the Board of Survey
heretofore ordered by act of Congress,
on the improvement of the harbor oi
