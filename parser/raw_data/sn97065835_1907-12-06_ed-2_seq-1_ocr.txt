Congress Hears It Read and Then
Adjourns—Large Crowd
.v. •.v.Tf.-.n.r ..! ', ••... .-
Present.
w.
President Roosevelt's message to
h:'^- congress was read Tuesday morning,
Rafter which that body adjourned.
f'f' Briefly, the ground covcrc 1 in the
^message may .be outlined as follows:
i-The chief' executive favors the pos
.u \tal savings bank idea as suggested
-"Vby the postmaster general, and again
''.urges upon congress the necessity of
A .providing an elastic and. emergency
^circulation. The hoarding of money
oiK is given a hard slam basic busi
ly ness conditions at present being in
better condition than ever before,
Vr- the hoarding, of money is held re
sponsible for the recent financial
stringency.
£.'- One of the striking features of the
I-1 message is contained in the sugges
'„v.tion that the government set aside
4 certain sums for the campaign ex
.*•* penses of each political party. A
good time for taking up the ques
UJs^tlon of tariff revision is immediately
Mi
Rafter the next election, is the presi
dent's view.
The abuse of the injunction in
fe^labor disputes, and the anti-militar
|J||iBm spirit are deplored. The anti
Kpjtru8t law, the president states, is in
l^-'-need of revision, to the extent that
t-rjonly combinations that do harm to
^.the general public sholl be prevented.
The eight hour working day
should be the goal toward which the
gpjeountry should bend every effort, and
*J|g,the government is urged to set an
|gpexample In this respect. Further
legislation along the lines of the em
if^ftployer's liability law is urged, and an
'jjjincome and inheritance tax should be
established.
Laws should be enacted so that
railroads may engage, in interstate
„,commerce under certain conditions.
^pJThe need of a uniform grain inspec
tfon system is pointed out. Former
arguments in favor of agricultural
and technical schools are reiterated
and emphasized, and the develop
rneut of irrigation projects is com
manded.
Public land fences are good and
-bad, the message declares, but all
are illegal, and It is not right that
all must be ordered down without
discrimination.
Talk of the inexhaustible re
sources of the country, especially in
connection with the timber supply,
is deemed foolish, and the presidem
would abolish 'ail tariffs on forest
products and says there is needless
waste in the process of getting out
lumber.
Work on the Panama canal is re
ported as going along satisfactorily.
The establishment of a bureau of
mines under the control and direc
tion of the secretary of the interior
/Js desired, also improvement by
"proper legislation of the ocean mail
•service.
In treating of affairs concerning
the army and navy, the chief execu
tive points out that the pay of of
ficers and enlisted men should be in
creased considerably and that en
listed men should not be compelled
to perform menial tasks, but such
duties should be performed by a
service corps maintained for the. pur
pose. Four battleships appear to be
a*bout the right number, to add to
the navy this "year. The Pacific
cruise should prove to be of great
educational value^ states the presi
dent.
The Japanese exposition to be
held in 1912 is given a boost, and it
is hoped that all the nations of
Europe and Asia will lend thefr aid
In making the affair a success.
A special, report on Cuban condi
tions is promised. .when Secretary
Taft gets home'from his continental
jaunt. Compulsary arbitration as a
means of settling labor disputes is
•gain recommended, and the recent
telegraphers' dispute is cited as a
case in point, where such arbitration
would have been of great help to
the country at lar£e.
The president is still ot the opin
lofa that title. t& coal, oil and gas
fleldB should remain with the gov
ernment The pure food laws are
referred to as operating in a man
ner to cause satisfaction.
Si Omaha Market Letter.

It is noticeable ithat the receipts of
the western range cattle are decreas
ing while supplies of cornfeds are on
the increase, although finished gra'de
are comparatively scarce as yet. Bus
iness in stockers and feeders has
been active and the trend of prices
stronger from start to finish. Low
prices stimulated the demand while
supplies have been very limited. Val
ues in general are from 10 to 25c
higher than a week ago and a very
good clearance has been made.
Receipts of hogs this week has
hot been much over half as large as
a week ago or a year ago and as
result the market has in a great
measure recovered from the recent
slumip. Monday was the low point of
the season, the trading being all at
,-«.00 or under, bu/t since then there
has been a steady advance of about
40c and the market has taken on
something of its old time activity.
Pacicers are compelled to pay stiff
prices for the few hogs that are
cam'ng in to supply their demands
for fresh meat but with anything
•like lii* erai supplies it is altogether
probable that prices would again hit
the toboggan. Weight cuts little fig
ure at present although heavy butch
ers sell at the top and underweights
at the bottom of the list.
Sneep receipts have been pretty
much the same as a week and a year
ago and the decline of the fore
part of this week wipes out practi
eally all of the advance of the latter
part of last week. Packers are talc
ing a hold more freely than for some
time past and all decent fed stock
finds a ready sale. On the other hand
feeder buyers are not inclined to do
much and the market for thin and
grass stiufC has been rather dull and
weak throughout.

EXPRESS RATES COME DOWN.
Important Business Transacted by

Last Meeting.
A letter from the American Ex

session of the state railroad commis

express rates from the eastern por

recently been considerably reduced.
A complaint had been filed with the
board, protestipg against the rates
formerly in existence.
C. G. Witt, formerly a prominent
railroad engineer, has been engaged
to secure sufficient data to insure the

THE BLACK HILLS PEDAGOGUES
IN THEIR FOURTH ANNUAL
MEETING.
Black. Hills. Schoolmaster's .Club
Holds Two Days' Session Iu
Gulch City.
The fourth annual meeting of the
iDeadwood School Masters 'club con
vened in Deadwood last week and
discussed various matters of impor
tance in educational circles. On
Friday afternoon the society. met at
the Deadwood High school and dis
cussed the Batavia system of instruc
tion. A banquet at the Franklin ho
tel filled the early evening hours,
after which a discussion of educa
tional topics took place, the principal
one ing the advisability of joining
forces with the State Educational
association. It was pointed out that
a number of advantages would come
to .ne Black Hills organization
through such a move, and a dele
gation will be sent to visit the con
vention at Watertown. on the 30th
with full power to speak for the
sciiool men of this section.
Addresses by Forest Wheeler, of
Lead, Prof. Humbert, of Rapid City,
and Profs. McCain and Lindberg,
forming a very interesting and profit
able portion of the evening's enter
tainment.
A varied program consisting of ad
dresses by President Cook, of Spear
fish Nonmal, D. P. .H. Brown, Supts.
H. C. Pryor and N. P. Lang, followed
by a general discussion that gave way
in turn to a business meeting filled
the greater portion of Saturday
morning.
The afternoon was given over to
the discussion of the topic "English
in the Grades and Secondary
Schools," led by Prof. J. C. Lindberg
of Spearfish, Principal F. J. Kelly, of
Lead, and Supt. T. B. Hanna, of
.urgis.
Prof. A. D. Humbert of this city
represented the State School of Mines
at the convention, and took a prom
inent part in the program, his prin
cipal address being made on Friday
•afternoon, when he took for his ub
ject, "How to give Individual In

ATTACK GOVERNOR CRAWFORD.
Attempt to Make Capital of Gover
nor's Hotel Bills Willie
in Pierre.
A report that Governor Crawford
was running hotel bills at Pierre
without authority received a con
siderable circulation through the
state last week, and the executive's
enemies made much of the alleged
discrepancy. In defense of Mr.
Crawford's action the Press of Sioux
Falls has the following to say on
the subject.
"It is well known that during the
present year it has been very dfflcult,
if not impossible, to rent a suitable
house in Pierre for the governor and
family. Unless he should take his
wife and five children to a hotel
and board or buy a home, he would
be compelled to live in cramped and
inconvenient quarters, subject to
right of possession in case of sale.
This is because of the fact that Pierre
is, and all summer has been, over
crowdied with people.
"The state does not provide a
house at the capital for the governor
to live in. Governor Crawford, on
account of these conditions, has kept
his family at the home in Huron.
The question of whether or not his
expenses at the hotel, Incurred while
there exclusively on state business,
is not properly allowable out of the
appropriation for his office, was re
ferred to the attorney general upon
the personal request of the governor
himself. Some time ago the attor
ney general orally advised the state
auditor that the charge was a legal
one against the appropriation as
made.' The whole amount is about
forty dollars.
"If the old machine is anxious to
compare the governor's expense ac
count with that of his predecessors
more in detail, we promise the pub
lic that the governor will not be the
one who "will suffer by the compari
son." '.jvJ

Car and men went down together in

Jones instantly. Larson got oft with
a badly wrenched foot, but Walker
was less fortunate, sustaining a se
vere facial wound and otherwise was
badly used up.
Information regarding the home or
friends of the dead man has not as
yet been obtained, although inquiries
to different cities iiave been sent by
wire in an endeavor to locate rela
tives or acquaintances.
A coroner's jury consisting of
George Avant, Ed Merchant and
JosepivOtto made atrip to the bridge
Tuesday on a special train and view
ed the wrecked staging, previously
having heard the testimony of several
men employed at the bridge. Upon
their return to the city a verdict stat

faulty staging was returned.
WANT TO WAR ON JAPS.
Russians Get the Idea that America
is After the Easterners—-Taft's
Visit the Cause.
According to the eastern dispatch
es the American ambassador at St.
Petersburg is spending much of his
time these days explaining to eager
Russians that they nre not needed to
help the United States whip Japan,
owing to the non-existence of hostil
ities between the two countries. This
idea and others just as lUciicrous are
said to be in circulation at the Rus
sian capital, on acoount of Secretary
Taft's tour of that country.
THE NEW TRAIN.
Milwaukee Puts on New Service Last
Sunday as Announced.
As announced last week, the Chi
cago, Milwaukee & St. Paul installed
their passenger train service Sunday,
and now every evening a brightly
lighted, vesti'buled train pulls out
from alongside the Crouch Lines de
pot, adding its share to the bustle
of our growing city. The train from
the east gets into town about 6:30
a. m., and is sidetracked for the
day just below the depot. Quite a
num ber of Rapid Cityans have
looked over the equipment, many of
them expressing a particular desire
to inspect the special sleeping cars
the Milwaukee owns and operates,
whose greatest bid for fame lies in
the extra sized berths with which
the cars are .equipped.
DENIES RAILROADS ARE POOR.
They Can Afford to Reduce Passen
ger Rates in the Opinion of the
Asst Attorney General.
Assistant Attorney General
Daughterty has made a return in the
injunction proceedings instituted by
the railroad of the state, to prevent
the enforcement of a 2% cent pas
senger rate, until the matter comes
up 1 efore Judge Carland fo ra hear
ing on the 17th of this month, when
they will put forth their best efforts
to make the injunction a permanent
one.
The Assistant Attorney General in
his presentation of the case, does not
agree with the railroads in their con
tention that rail traffic in South Da
kota is unprofitable, but goes on to
show a reasonable revenue derived
from such sources for the past three
years. Mr. Dougherty further holds
that a lower rate will be of great ben
efit to the roads themselves in the
way of creating new business.
The matter is of .much importance
to South Dakotans generally, and
Judge Garland's decision is awaited
with much interest.
BILL POSTERS DO BATTLE.

lied forth unto Deadwood Tuesday
afternoon and proceeded to affix

Staters claimed permission had been
obtained to do the decorating. The
J. W. Early company, it appears, have
a lease of the bill board privileges in
that vicinity, and incidentally be
long to the International Bill Stick
ers association—the Staters do not—
so when the Earlys caught the In
vaders at their work, the air sud
denly became full of paste brushes,
fists, hammers, etc., much to the dis
comfiture of the Stater tribe, who
are now seeking redress in the justice
courts. The Earlys will no doubt
file counter charges to keep the bal

THE POSTMASTER GENERAL REC
OMMENDS TO CONGRESS
THEIR ESTABLISHMENT
Postmaster General Meyer Empha
sizes Need in His Report to
Congress.
That the postal savings bank idea
has a warm, supporter in Postmaster
General Meyer, is a fact disclosed in
his recent report to the sixtieth con
gress now assembled in Washington.
He believes the establishment
such a system of banks would be of
a great benefit to the country, not
only as a imeans of instilling and
fostering ideas of thrift in the Ameri
can, but they would also prove an
important factor in keeping a large
percentage of the savings that are at
present abroad, within the borders of
this country. The report suggests
that great sums of money are kept
out of circulation through lack of
confidence on the part of its possess
ors who fear to deposit it in the
banks, a state of affairs that would
be done away with to a considerable
extent if the postal banks were in ex
istence, in the opinion of Mr. Meyer.
The postmaster general desires
that authority be extended the in
cumbent of his office to designate
money order postofflces and certai
others as the occasion may require
to receive deposits for savings ac
counts in even dollars, making the
minimum deposit $1.00, while the
total amount on deposit for any one
person must not exceed $500.00. It
it is further suggested that a two
per cent rate of Interest be allowed
on all savings, which may be with-'
drawn at any time, subject to certain
regulations.
To get the mloney thus accruing
back into circulation, authoritly is
asked to turn it over to such banks
as are government depositories in
the states where the deposits were
made.
Another improvement deemed
cessary by the chief of the postal
service is the establishment of a par
cels post for packages originating
on a rural route or at a distributing
postoffice, froim where delivery is
made by a rural route carrier, the
maximum weight for parcels to be
eleven pounds.
A better system of ibookkeeplng for
the department, and the appointment
of an official to a permanent position
as deputy postmaster general or di
rector of posts with a salary of not
less than $10,000 per annum, who
shall be as an expert adviser to the
head of the department and from the
permancy of his position be able to
secure a continuity of policy essen
tial to the usefulness of the depart
ment, are other moves that the post
master general desires to bring about
about as he believes them to be of
the utmost importance in aiding to
place the postal service on an up-to
date business basis.

that body started in on the munici
pal affairs that had accumulated since
the previous meeting, with Mayor
Emrlck in the chair, and the follow
ing aldermen responding to roll call:
Overpeck, .Dodge, Thompson and
Felgle.

ing were read and upon motion oi
Alderman Overpeck, seconded by
Alderman Dodge, they were accepted
and ordered placed on file.
Before taking up the payment of
bills against the city, Attorney Brown
in behalf of his clients, J. P. McElroy
& Son, asked that the sum of $76.50
be paid them from any money the
Sampson-McConnell Company might
l.ave due them, in compliance with
an order made on the city by the
sewer building firm. As it was a
matter of some difficulty to state
just what amount was due the firm
until the alleys in which the ditch
ing took place were declared in a
satisfactory condition, the order waB
placed on file until the streets and
walks committee had passed upon
the condition of the alleys and made
their report to the council.
Fire Chief McElroy made a re
port on the condition of the fire hose
owned by the city and upon his sug
gestion that a quantity of it could
be made serviceable by minor re
pairs, the auditor was instructed to
procure the necessary material to put
the hose in good shape.
The city fathers then passed upon
the following bills which were order
ed paid from the proper .funds:

The next matter taken up for con
sideration was. the purchase of the
pipe for the sewer outlet east of.
town. The auditor was ordered to
procure the samie from the Sioux
City Boiler and Sheet Iron Pipe Co.,
that concern having given a satisfac
tory figure on the material.
Expedients for the proper care of
the waste water from the reservoir

discussed and the Installation of an
automatic valve appeared to be the
proper remedy for abating the min

the necessary arrangements for se
curing such a valve, on motion of
Alderman Felgel, seconded by Aider

Alderman Thomson reported that
for various reasons the shelter or
dered erected for the protection of
certain property belonging to the city
had not been built. Upon inquiry it
developed that part of the material
for which the house was to be con
structed had been used, so the mayor
was of the opinidn that the city may
be spared the-expense.of putting up
the building for a while at: least, to:
which the other membeij'of the coun

NO. 27.
ON THE FLIP OF A COPPER THE
CHANGE IN AFFAIRS ARE
TO BE MADE.
Land Office Officials to he Ch&nged
—Burke for Register and
WiUsie for Rcecciver.
Hinging on the recent coin flipping
contest between Senators Gamble and
Kittredge of this state, there will in
ill probability be a change or two in
the personnel of the local land office
staff in the near future.
The selection of the man for reg
Ister at Rapid City fell to the lot of
Senator Kittrldge, .who had the pres
ent register, George Bennett, in mind
for the post. However, the appoint*
ment of the receiver fell Into the
hands of Senator Gamble who de
sired Myron WiUsie for the place,
which let Mr. Burke out. Mr. Ben
nett was not satisefld with the turn
affairs had taken and decided to
withdraw in favor of 'Burke and so
informed Senator Kittredge, who will
wihtout doubt act accordingly and
present the latter's name for the
office.
Mr. Burke has been connected with
the land office since 1903, and will
undoubtedly prove a worthy succes
sor to Mr. Bennett. That gentle
man, upon being freed from his gov
ernmental connections, will devote
his time to his growing business af
fairs. Mr. Bennett has made him
self an enviable reputation as regis*
ter, and hosts of frlende stand ready
to testify as to his efficiency while
In office.
MEMBERSHIP CAMPAIGN.
Hustlers and Rustlers are Busy Get*
ting Members for the
Y. M. C. A. yj||
The .membership campaign of the
Y. M. C. A. is warming up. The
Hustlers seem to be getting the bet
ter of the Rustlers, although the
Rustlers keep the Hustlers a hustling
to keep ahead of the Rustlers. The
Rustlers say that they are rustling
and expect to make the Hustlers hus
tle at the final outcome for the ban
quet on the 20th day of this month.
At present the Hustlers have secured
about ninety members since the cam
paign started, and the Rustlers
about forty-six, so the HuBtlers so
far have gotten the better of tho
Hustlers. Two of the .Hustlers have
secured fifty-five members, one se
curing thirty and the other twenty
five by their own efforts. This would
seem to indicate that some of the
members are not working as hard
as they can to support their side.
This makes the present membership
of about 250 members.
The RustlerB will meet with John
Fall, the captain of their committee
at the office of T. R. Nelson, chair
man of the membership committee
on Friday evening December 6, at 1
o'clock, at which time future plans
for the campaign will be taken up
and the hustlers will meet with the
captain Dr. LeMar at the same place
at 7:30 on the same evening.
Campaigners get busy. See your

PARKER'S REQUEST,
Introduces Bill for 9175,000 Public
Building in Tills City Last
Tuesday.
The first official step toward the
realization of that goal of all loyal
Rapid Cityans, an up-to-date public
building, was made on Tuesday
when Congressman Parker introduced
in the lower house of Congress, a
bill requesting an appropriation of
$175,000 to be used in constructing
a federal building in Rapid ity.
Some time ago Colonel Parker prom
ised to make this initial move in the
interests of our city and now that
the matter is before the sixtieth con
gress, there is some reason to hope
that the appropriation will be made.
However, the whole thing depends
on whether or not, money is voted to
be expended for internal Improve
ments during the. present session of
congress. Meanwhile many of us will
keep our fingers.crossed to ward off
any misfortune that may threaten to
destroy our latest hope.
