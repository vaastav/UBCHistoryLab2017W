The constitution of the United States, sound
financial principles, and our best interests, all
require that the country should have as its legal
tender money both gold and silver coin, of an
mtnnsie value, as bullion, equivalent to that
which, upon its face, it purports to possess. The
constitution, in express terms, tecognizes both
gold and silver as the only true legal-tender
money. To banish either of these metals from
our currency is to narrow and limit the circu
liu ng uiwlium of exchange to the disparage­
ment of important interests. The UniteaStates
pruds ces more silver than any other coun­
try, and is directly interested in maintaining
it hb one of the two precious metals which fur­
nish the coinage of the world. It wilh in my
ju ijniu-ut. contribute to this result if Congress
vrl repeal so much of existing legislation as
qiiiivi tin: coin ee of silver dollars, contain
only 412£ gr in* of silver, and in its stead
il intliorizc the S^cretsirv of the Treasury to
(.••an Hilvt-r ilollnxK of equivalent value as bull­
ion with g' Id dollars. This will defraud no
in n. and will be in accordance with familiar
precedents Congress, on several occasious,
has altered the ratio of value between gold and
ml ver, in order to establish it more nearly in
accordance with the a:tual ratio of value be­
tween the two metals.
In financial legislation every measure in the
direction of greater fidelity in the discharge of
pecuniary obligations has been found by expe­
rience to diminish the rates of interest which
debtors are required to pay. and to increase the
facility with whicn money can be obtained for
tn^ry legitimate purpose. Our own recent
nnttncial history shows how surely money be­
comes abundant whenever confidence in the ex­
act performance of moneyed obligations is es­
tablished.
The Secretary of War reports that the ex­
penditures of the War Department for the fis­
cal year ended June 30, 1880, were #39,924,
778.03. Tuo appropriations for this depart
nient, for the current fiscal year, amount to
$41,993,6311.40.
With respect to the army, the Secretary in­
vites attention to the fact that its strength is
limited by statute (Section 1,115, Revised Stat­
utes) to not more than 30.000 enlisted men,
but that provisos contained in appropriation
bills have limited expenditures to
the enlistment of but 25,000. It is believed
that full legal strength is the least possible
force at which the present organization can be
maintained, having in view efficiency, discipline
and cconomy. While the enlistment of this
force would add somewhat to the appropriation
for pay of the army, the saving made in other
respects would be more than an equivalent for
Uiis additional outlay, and the efficiency of the
nrmy would be largely increased.
The rapid extension of the railroad system
west of the Mississippi river, and the great
tide of settlers which has flowed in upon new
territory, impose on the military an entire
Change of policy. The maintenance of small
posts along wagon and stage routes of travel
is no longer necessary. Permanent quarters
at points selected, of a more substantial
character than those heretofore constructed,
will be required. Under existing laws, per­
manent buildings cannot be erected without
the sanction of Congress, and when sales of
military sites and buildings have been author­
ized, the moneys received have reverted
to the treasury, and could only become avail­
able through a new appropriation. It is recom­
mended that provision be made, by a general
statute, for the s.ile of such abandoned military
posts and buildings as are found to be unneces­
sary, and for the application of the proceeds to
the construction of other posts. While many
of the present posts aro of but slight value for
military purposes, owing to the changed condi­
tion of the country, then- occupation is contin­
ued at great expense and inconvenience, be­
cause they afford the only available shelter for
troops.
The absence of a large number of officers of
the line, in active duty, from their regiments is
a serious detriment to the maintenance of the
service. The constant demand for small de­
tachments, each of which should be command
by a commissioned officer, and the variou
details of officers for necessary service awav
from their commands, occasions a scarcity in
the number required for company duties.
With a view to lessening this drain to some
extent, it is recommended that the law author­
izing the detail of officers from the active list
as professors of tactics and military science at
certain colleges and universities be so amended
as to provide that all such details be made from
the retired list of the army.
Attention is asked to the necessity of pro­
viding by legislation for organizing, arming,
and disciplining the active militia of the coun:
try, and liberal appropriations are recommended
in this belmlf. The reports of the Adjutant
General of the army nd the Chief of Ord­
nance touching this subject fully set forth its
importance.
The report of the officer in charge of educa­
tion in the army shows that there are seventy
em ht schools now in operation in the army,
with an aggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted
men and children. The .Secretary recommends
the enli.itnient of 15' schoolmasters, with Ult­
rank and pay of Commissary Sergeants. Ai:
appropriation is needed to supply the Jud^e
Advocates of the army with stii.a le libraries,
and the Secretary recommends that the corps ut
Judj.e Advocates be placed upon thesume foot­
ing as to promotion with the other staff corp
o: the army. Under the existing laws th
Cure .u of Mili'itrv Jr.-tiee consists of one of
ticer.the Judge Advocate General, an I thecorp
of Judirt Advocate of el ht officers of tq
rank (.M ij.Ts), with a provision that the linn
of the corps shall m.in at l'our, when reduced
bv casualty or re-ign.,tion to that number.
The consolidation ol' the Bureau of Military
Justice and the corps of Judge Advocates,
upon the same basis with the other staff corps
of the army, would lemove an miju3t discrim­
ination against deserving officers, and subserve
the tent interests of the service.
Especial attention is ashed to the report of
the Chief of Engineers upon the condition of
our national defenses. From a personal in­
spection of many of the fortifications referred
to, the Secretary is able to emphasize the rec­
ommendations made, and to state that their
incomplete and defenselels condition is dis­
creditable to the country. While other nations
uave been increasing their means for carrying
on offensive warfare and attacking mar­
itime cities, we have been dormant
in preparation for defense nothing of im­
portance h.is been done toward strengthening
and finishing our casemated works since our
late civil war, during which the great gang
of modern warfare and the heavy armor of
modern fortifications and ships came into
use among the nations, and our earthworks
left, by a sudden failure of appropriations
seme years since, in all stages of incomple
tion, are now being rapidly destroyed by the
elements.
The two great rivers of the North Amerioan
continent, the Mississippi and the Columbia,
have tbeir navig ble waters wholly within the
limits of the United States, and are of vast im­
portance to our internal and foreign commerce.
The permanency of the important work
on the South pass of the Mississippi
river seems now to be assured. There
has been no failure wlntever in the maintenance
of the maximum channel during thesis months
ended Aug. 9 last. This experiment has opened
a broad, deep highway to the ocean, and is an
improvement, upon the permanant success of
which congratulations may be .exchanged
among people abroad and at home, and
especially among the communities of the
Mi-si-f-ippi valley, whose commercial ex­
changes float in an unobstructed chan­
nel safely to and from the sea.
A comprehensive improvement of the Mis­
sissippi and its tributaries is a matter of tran­
scendent importance. These great waterways
comprise a system of inland transportation
spread like net-work over a large portion of
tne United States, and navigable to the
extent of many thousands of miles,
roducers and consumers alike have a
.•ommon interest in snob unequaled
facilities for cheap transportation. Geograph­
ically, commercially and politically they are the
strongest tie between tne various sections of
-he country. These channels of communica­
tion and interchange are the property of the
nation. Its jurisdiction is paramount over their
waters, and the plainest principles of pnblie
interest require their intelligent and careful
supervision, with a view to thoir protection,
improvement, and the enhancement of their
usefulness.
The channel of the .Columbia river, for a
distance of about 100 miles from its mouth, if
obstructed by a succession of bars, which oo
casion serious delays in navigation, and heav
expense for lighterage and towage. A depth
of at least twenty feet at low tide should be se­
cured and maintained, to meet the require­
ments of the extensive and growing inland and
oaean commerce it subserves. The most urgent
need, however, for this great water-way is a
permanent improvement of the channel at the
mouth of the river.
From Columbia river to San Francisco, a dis­
tance of over 600 miles, there is no harbor on
our Pacific coast which can be approached dur­
ing stormy weather. An appropriation of
$150,000 was made by the Forty-fifth Congress
for the commencement of a breakwater and
harbor of refuge, to be located at some point
between the Straits of Fuca and San Francisco,
at which the necessities of oommerce, local
and general, will be best accommodated.
The amoant appropriated is thought
to be quite inadequate for the purpose
intended. The cost .of the work,
when finished, will be very great, owing to the
want of natural advantages for a site at any
point on the coast between the designated lim­
its, and it has not been thought to be advisable
to undertake the work without a larger appro­
priation. I commend the matter to the atten­
tion of Congress.
The completion of the new building for the
War Department is urgently needed, and the
estimates for continuing its construction are
especially recommended.
The collections of books, specimens and
records constituting the Army Medical Ma
seiim and Library are of national importance.
The library now contains about 51,800 voiumea
and 57,000 pamphlets relating to medicine,
surgery and allied topics. The contents of the
Army Medical Museum coqsist of 23,000
specimens, and are unique in the com­
pleteness witfc which both military mgw
gefy and the diseases of armies are
illustrated. Their destruction would be
an irreparable loss, not only to the United
States, but to the world. There are filed in the
Record and Pension Division over 16,000 bound
volumes of hospital records, together with a
great quantity of papers, embracing the orig­
in il records of the hospitals of our armies dur­
ing the civil war. Aside from their historical
value, these records are daily searched' for evi­
dence needed in the settlement of large num­
bers of pension and other claims, for the pro­
tection of the Government against attempted
frauds, as well as for the benefit of honest claim­
ants. These valuable collections are how in a
building which is peculiarly exposed to the
danger of destruction by fire, it is therefore
earnestly recommended that an appropriation
be made for a new fire-proof building, ade­
quate for the present needs and reasonable
future expansion of these valuable collections.
Such a building should be absolutely fire-proof
no expenditure for mere architectural display
is required. It is believed that a suitable
structure can be erected at a cost not to ex­
ceed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
($250,000).
Tiie recommendation of the Secretary of the
Vavv, that provision be made for the estab­
lishment of some form of civil government for
the people of Alaska, is approved. At present
there is no protection of persons or property in
that Territory, except such as is afforded by
the officers of the United States ship James­
town. This vessel was dispatched to Sitka,
because of the fear that, without the
immediate presence of the national
authority, there was impending danger
of anarchy. The steps taken to restore
order have been accepted in good faith by both
white and Indian inhabitants, and the neces­
sity for this method of restraint does not, ih
uy opinion, no exist. If, however, the James­
town should be withdrawn, leaving the people,
as at present, without the ordinary judicial
und administrative authority of organized local
government, serious consequences might ensue.
The laws provide only for the collection of
revenue, the protection of public property,
!tnd the transmission of the mails. The prob­
lem is to supply a local rule for a population so
scattered and so peculiar in its origin and con­
dition. The natives are reported to be teacha­
ble and self-supporting, and, if properly in­
structed, doubtless would advance rapidly in
civilization, and a new factor of prosperity
would be added to the national life. I, there­
fore, recommend the requisite legislation upon
this subject.
The Secretary of the Navy has taken steps
toward the establishment of naval coaling
stations at the Isthmus of Panama, to meet the
requirements of our commercial relations with
Central and South America, which are rapidly
growing in importance. Locations eminently
suitab'e, both as regards our uaval purposes
and the uses of commerce, have been selected,
one on the east side of the isthmus, at Chiriqui
Lagoon, in the Carribbean sea, and the
other on the Pacifio coast at the Bay of Golfito,
The only safe harbors, sufficientiv commodious,
on the isthmus are at these points, and the
distance between them is less than 100 miies.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy con­
cludes with valuable suggestions with respect
to tlio building up of our merchant-marine
sen-ice, which deserves the favorable consider­
ation of Congress.
The report of the Postmaster General exhib­
its the continual growth and the high state of
efficiency of the postal service. The operations
of no department of the Government, perhaps,
represent with greater exactness the increase in
population and the business of the country.
In 1860 the postal receipts were $8,518,068.40*
in 1880 the receipts were $33,315,479.34. Aii
the inhabitants of the country are di­
rectly and personally interested in hav­
ing proper mail facilities, and
naturally watch the postoffice very closely.
This careful oversight on the part of the pecn
pie has proved a constant stimulus to improve­
ment. During the past year there was an. in­
crease of 2,134 postoffices, and the mail routes
were extended 27,177 miles, making an addi­
tional annual transportation of 10.804,19i miles.
The revenues of the postal service for the en­
suing year are estimated at $38,845,174.10 and
•he expenditures at $42,475,922, lea ring a defi­
ciency to be appropriated out of the treasurv
of $3,630,757.90.
The Universal Postal Union has received the
accession of almost all the countries and
i-ilonies of the world maintaining organized
uostal services, and it is confidently expected
tliHt all the other countries and colonies now
mtside the Union will soon unite therewith,
thus realizing the grand idea and aim of the
founders of the Union, of forming, for pur
es of international mail communication,
single postamerritory embracing the world,
vi complete uniformity of postal charges,
nd conditions of international exchange, for
ill de-cri -ti ns of correspondence. To enable
the Uni ed States to do its full share of this
srreat work, additional legislation is asked by
he Postmaster General, to whose recommen­
dations especial attention is called.
The suggestion of the Postmaster General,
that it would be wise to encourage, by appropri­
ate legislation, the establishment of Amoncan
inies ot' steamers by our own citizens, to carry
t'te mails between our own ports and those of
Mexico, Central America, South America, and of
rr-nspacific countries, is commended to the
sen us consideration of Congress.
The attention of Congress is also invited to
the suggestions of the Posmaster General in
••a^ard to postal savings.
Tt is evident that a delay of justice, in many
instances oppressive and disastrous to suitors,
now necessarily occurs in the Federal courts,
which will in this way be remedied.
The report of the Secretary of the Interior
presents an elaborate account of the operations
of that department during the past year.
It gives me great pleasure to say that
our In&-~ii affairs appear to be in a
more hopeful condition now than
ever before. The Indians have made
gratifying progress in agriculture, herding and
mechanical pursuits. Many who were a few
years ago in hostile conflict with the Govern­
ment are quietly settling down on farms where
they hope to make their permansnt homes,
building houses and engaging in the occupa­
tions of civilized life. Tho introduction of the
freighting business among them has been re­
markably fruitful of good results, in
giving many of them congenial and re­
munerative employment, and in stimulat­
ing their ambition to earn their own
support. Their honesty, fidelity, and efficiency
as carriers are highly praised. The organiza­
tion of a police force of Indians has been equal­
ly successful in maintaining law and order upon
the reservations, and in exercising a wholesome
moral influence among the Indians themselves.
I concur with the Secretary of the Interior in
the recommendation that the pay of this force
be increased, as an inducement to the best class
of young men to enter it.
Much care and attention has been devoted
to the enlargement of educational facilities
for the Indians. The means available for
this important object have been very inade­
quate. A few additional boarding schools
at Indian agencies have been established, and
the erection of buildings has been begun for
several more, but an increase of
the appropriations for this interesting
undertaking is greatly needed to
accommodate the large number of Indian chil­
dren of school-age. The number offered by
their parents from all parts of the country for
education in the Government schools is much
larger than can be accommodated with the
means at present available for that purpose.
The number of Indian pupils at tbe Normal
School at Hampton, Va., under the direction of
Gen. Armstrong, has been tonsiderably in­
creased, and their progress is highly
encouraging. The Indian school established
by the Interior Department, in 1879, at Car­
lisle, Pa., under the direction of Capt. Pratt,
has been equally successful. It has now near­
ly 200 pupils of both sexes, representing a great
variety of the tribes east of the Bocky mount­
ains. The pupils in both these institutions re­
ceive not only an elementary English education,
but are also instructed in housework, agricult­
ure, and useful mechanical pursuits. A simi­
lar school was established this year at Forest
Grove, Ore., for the education of Indian
youth on the Pacific coast. In addition to this,
thirty-six Indian boyB and girls were selected
from the Eastern Cherokees and placed in
boarding-schools in North Carolina, where
they are to receive an elementary English edu­
cation and training in industrial pursuits. The
interest shown by Indian parents, even among
the so-called wild tribes, in the education of
their children is very gratifying, and gives
promise that the results accomplished by the
efforts now making will be of lasting benefit
The Attorney General recommends the
establishment of an intermediate court of
errors and appeals. It is recommended that
the number of Judges of the Circuit Court
in each circuit, with the exception of the
Second circuit, should be increased bv the
addition of another Judge in the (Second
circuit, that two should be added and that
an intermediate appellate court should be
formed in each circuit, to consist of the Cir­
cuit Judges and the Circuit Justice, and fW.
in the event of the absence of either of these
Judges the place of the absent Judge should
be supplied by the Judge of one of the Dis­
trict Courts in the circuit Such an appellate
court could be safely invested with large juris­
diction, and ita decisions wonld satisfy suitors
in many cases where appeals would still be al­
lowed to the Supreme Court. Tho expense in­
curred for this intermediate court will require
a very moderate increase of the appropriations
for the expenses of the Department of Justice.
This recommendation is commended to th*
careful consideration of Congress.
The past year has been unusually free from
disturbances among the Indian tribes. An
agreement has been made with the Utes, by
Which they surrender their large reservation
in Colorado in consideration of an annuity,
to be paid to them, and agree to settle in
severalty on certain lands designated for
that purpose, as farmers, holding individual
title to their land in fee-simple, inalienable
for a certain period. In this way a costly
Indian war has been avoided, which, at one
time, seemed imminent, and, for the first time
in the history of the country, sin Indian nation
has given up its tribal existence to be settled
in severalty, and to live as individuals under
the common protection of the laws of the
country. The conduct of the TnJiann through­
out the ooantjty during the past JMT, with
but few noteworthy exertions, has
been orderly and peaceful. The guerrilla
warfare carried on for two years by
Victorio and his band of Southern Apaches, has
virtually come to an end by the death of that
chief and most of bis followers, on Mexican
soil. The disturbances caused on our northern
frontier by Sitting Bull and his men, who had
taken refuge in the British dominions, are also
likely to cease. A large majority of his follow­
ers nave surrendered to our military forces,
and tbe remainder are apparently in progress
of disintegration.
I ccncur with the Secretary of the Interior
in expressing the earnest hope that Congress
will at this session take favorable action on
the Lill providing for the allotment of lands
on the different reservations in severalty to
the Indians, with patents conferring fee
simple title inalienable for a certain period,
and the eventual disposition of th residue of
the reservations, for general settlement, with
.the consent and for the benefit of the In­
dians, placing the latter under the equal
protection of the laws of the country. This
measure, together with a vigorous prosecution
of our educational efforts, will work the most
important and effective advance toward a solu­
tion of the Indian problem, in preparing th
gradual merging of our Indian population
to
the great body of American citizenship,
A large increase is reported in the disposal of
public lands for settlement during the past
year, which marks the prosperous growth of
our agricultural industry, and a vigorous move­
ment of population toward our unoccupied
lands. As this movement proceeds the codifi­
cation of our land laws, as well as- proper legis­
lation to regulate the disposition of publio
lands, becomes of mere pressing necessity, and
I therefore invite the consideration of Congress
to tho report and the accompanying draft of a
bill, made by the Public Lands Commission,
which were communicated by me to Congress
at the last session. Early action upon this im­
portant subject is highly desirable.
The attention of Congress is again asked to
the wasteful depredations committed on our
public timber-lands, and the rapid and indis­
criminate destruction of otir forests. The Ur­
gent necessity for legislation to this end is now
generally recognized. In view of the lawless
character of the depredations committed, and
the disastrous consequences which will inevita­
bly follow their continuance, legislation has
again and again been recommended to arrest
the evil, and to preserve for the people of our
Western States and Territories the timber need­
ed for domestio and other essential uses.
The report of the Director of the Geologi­
cal Survey is a document of unusual interest
The consolidation of the various geological
and geographical surveys and exploring en­
terprises, each of which has heretofore oper­
ated upon an independent plan, without con­
cert, cannot fail to be of great benefit to
all tho.-e industries of the country which de­
pend upon the development of our min.
eral resources. The labors of the scien­
tific men, of recognized merit, who com
poso the Corps of the Geological Survey,
during the first season of their field
operations and inquiries, appear to have
been very comprehensive, and will soon
be communicated to Congress in a number of
volumes. The Director of the Survey recom­
mends that the investigations carried on by his
bureau, which, so far, have been confined to
the so-called public-land States and Terri­
tories, be extended over the entire country, and
that the necessary appropriation be made for
this purpose. This would be particularly bene­
ficial to the iron, coal and other mining inter­
ests of the Mississippi valley, and of the East­
ern and Southern States. The subject iB com­
mended to the careful consideration of Con­
gress.
The Secretary of the Interior asks attention
to the want of room in the publio buildings of
the capital, now existing and in progress of
construction, for the accommodation of the
clerical force employed, and of the public
records. Necessity has compelled the renting
of private buildings in different parts of the
city for tho location of public offices, for which
a large amount of rent is annually paid, while
the separation of offices belonging to the
same departments impedes the transac­
tion of current business. The Secre­
tary suggests that the blocks surround­
ing Lafayette Square, on the east, north, and
west, be purchased as the sites for new edifices,
for the accommodation of the Government of­
fices, leaving the square itself intact and that,
if Such buildings were constructed upon a har­
monious plan of architecture, they would add
much to the beauty of the national capital, and
would, together with the treasury and the new
State,Navy,and War Department building, form
one of the most imposing groups of public edi­
fices in the world.
The Commissioner of Agriculture expresses
tbe confident belief that his efforts in behalf of
the production of our own sugar and tea have
been encouragingly rewarded. The importance
of the results attained have attracted" marked
attention at home, and have received the special
consideration of foreign nations. The successful
cultivation of our own tea, and the manufacture
of our own sugar, would make a difference of
many millions of dollars annually in the wealth
of the nation.
The report of the Commissioner asks atten­
tion particularly to the continued prevalence
of an infectious and contagious eattlc-disease,
known and dreaded in Europe and Asia as
cattli--plague, or pleuro-piienmonia. A mild
type of this disease, in certain sections of
our country, is the occasion of great loss to
our farmers, and of serious disturbance to
our trade with Great Britain, which
furnishes a market for most of our live-stock
and dressed meats. The valne of neat-cattle
exported from the United States for the eight
months ended Aug. 31, 1880, was more than
twelve million dollars, and nearly double tho
value for the same period in 1879, an unexam­
pled increase of export trade. Your early at­
tention is solicited to this important matter.
The Commissioner of Education reports a
continued increase of public interest in edu­
cational affairs, and that the public schools
generally throughout the country are well sus­
tained. Industrial training is attracting de­
served attention, and colleges for instruction,
theoretical and practical, in agrif' 'hire and the
mechanic arts, including the Government
schools recently established for the in­
struction of Indian youth, are gaining
steadily in public estimation. The Commis­
sioner asks special attention to the depreda­
tions committed on the lands reserved
for the future support of pnblio instruction
•nd to the very great need of help from the
nation for schools in the Territories and in the
Southern States. The recommendation here­
tofore made is repeated and urged, that an
educational fund be set apart from the net pro­
ceeds of the sales of the pnblie lands annually,
the income of which, and the remainder of the
net annual proceeds, to be distributed on some
satisfactoiy plan to the States and Territories
and the District of Columbia.
The success of the public schools of the
District of Columbia, and the progress made,
under the intelligent direction of tne Board of
Education and the Superintendent, in sup­
plying tho educational requirements of tbe
District, with thoroughly trained and efficient
teachers, is very gratifying. The acts of
yongresB, from time to time, donating public
lands to the several 8tates and Territories in
aid of educational interests, have proved to be
wise measures of public policy, resulting in
great and lasting benefit It would seem to bo
a matter of simple justice to extend the bene­
fits of this legislation, the wisdom of which hs»
been so fully vindicated by experience, to the
District of Columbia.
I again commend the general interests of the
District of Columbia to the favorable consid­
eration of Congress. The affairs of the Dis­
trict, aa shown hy the report of the Commis­
sioners, aro in a very satisfactory condition.
In my annual Messages heretofore, and in
my special Messages of Dec. 19, 1879,1 have
urged upon Congress the necessity of reclaim­
ing the marshes of the Potomac adja­
cent to the capital, and I am constrained
by its importance to advert again to the
subject These fiats embrace an
area of several hundred acres. They are an
impediment to the drainage of the city and se­
riously impair its health. It is believed that,
with this substantial improvement of its river
front, the capital wonld be in all respects one
of the most attractive eities in the world.
Aside from ita permanent population, this city
is necessarily the {dace of residence of persons
from every section of the country, engaged in
the pnblio service. Many others reside here
temporarily for tho transaction of business with
the Government
The expenses of Indian education have so
far been drawn from the permanent civiliza­
tion fund at the disposal of the Department of
the Interior but tne fund is now so much re
dneed that tbe continuance of this beneficial
work will in the future depend on specific ap­
propriations by Congress for the purpose, and I
venture ts express tne hope that Congress will
not permit institutions so fruitful of good re­
sults to perish for want of means for their
support On the oontrary, an increase of the
number ot schools appears to be highly advis­
able.
I commend to the attention of Congress the
great services of the Commander-in-Chief of
our armies during the war for the Union, whose
wise, firm, and patriotic conduct did so much
to bring that momentous conflict to a close.
The legislation of the United States contains
many precedents for the recognition of distin­
guished military merit authorizing rank and
emoluments to be conferred for eminent serv­
ices to the country. An act of Congress au­
thorizing the appointment of a Captain-Gener­
al of the army, with suitable provisions relat­
ing to compensation, retirement, and other de­
tails, would, in my judgment, be altogether fit­
ting and proper, and wonld be warmly approved
by the country,
The report of the Secretary of the Navy ex­
hibits the successful and satisfactory manage­
ment of that department during the last fiscal
year. The total expenditures for the year were
$12,916,639.45, leaving unexpended at the
close of the year $2,141,682.23 of tho amount
of available appropriations. The appropria­
tions for the present fiscal year, ending June
30, 1881, are $15,095,061.45 and the total esti­
mates for the next fiscal year ending June 30,
1882, are $15,953,851.61. The amount drawn
by warrant from July 1, 1880, to Nov. 1,1880,
is *5,0*1,$70,
It is obvious that the legislation of the last
Congress in regard to silver, so far as it was
based on an anticipated rise in the value of
silver as a result of that legislation, has failed
to produce the effect then predicted. The
longer the law remains in force, requiring as it
does the coinage of a nominal dollar, which, in
reality, is not a dollar, the greater bpComfcs the
danger that this country will, be forced to ac­
cept a single inetal as the soie legal standard
of valne, ih circulation, ahd this a standard tit
less value than it purports to be worth in the
recognized money of tne world.
It should not be forgotten that the land ac­
quired will probably be worth the cost of re­
deeming it, and that the navigation of the river
will be greatly improved. I therefore again in­
vite the attention of Congress to the importance
of prompt provision for this much-needed and
too-tang-delayed improvement
The water supply of the city is inadequate.
In addition to the ordinary use thioughout
the city the consumption oy Government is
necessarily very great in the navy-yard, arsenal,
and the various departments, and a large quan­
tity is required for the proper preservation of
the numerous parks and the cleansing of sewers.
I recommend that this subject receive the ear­
ly attention 6f Congress, and that, in making
provision for an increased supply, such means
be adopted as will have in view the future
growth of the city. Temporary expedients for
such a purpose cannot but
be wasteful of money,
and therefore unwise. A more ample reservoir,
with corresponding facilities for keeping it
filled, should, in my judgment, be constructed.
I commend again to the attention of Congress
the subject of the removal, from their pres­
ent location, of the depots of tho several rail­
roads entering the city and I renew the rec­
ommendations of my former messages in be­
half of the erection of a building for the Con­
gressional Library, the completion of the
Washington Monument and of liberal appro­
priations in support of the benevolent, reform­
atory and penal institutions of the District

SEWING MACHINE
Is wonderful in its conception, un­
precedented for doing a large range _©f
sewing in textile fabrics and leather, its
motions are continuous, admitting cf an
extraordinary rate of speed, either by
steam or foot power. Every motion of the
treadle makes six stitches, thus produc­

than ether Sewing Machines. It has no
stop motions, and tightens the stitch with
the needle out of the fabric. !t uses t*ic
well-known Wilson Compound Feed on both sides of the needle. !'i
has two-thirds less parts than any other flrst-class Sewing Machine.
Its arm is fully eight and one-half inches long and flvo and one-h
