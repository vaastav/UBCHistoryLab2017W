Tlie increase in Secretary Gaffes
estimates aie not tery great The
appropriations for 1002 footed nji
COC5jGS7T tlie estimates for 1001 ag
gregate 610S278S
It is not in the totals however that
tlie nature of the changes is to be
found but in the setoral items in
which there are increases or de
creases Probalilj tlie most popular
decrease in expenditure will be the
3400000 to be sated on pensions
Tensions for real imaliils and for old
holdiers who hate actually served are
popular but their steady increase
long j ears after the war has excited
suspicion and stimulated attack
Although the estimates do not in
dicate it there is haiilli a doubt that
if the new ruling of the Postofiice De
partment continues in force this
branch of the serwee is soon to be
come self supporting
The country will be glad to sate
nenilt 10300000 on the cost of the
nrmy The daj is coming coining as
oon as the farmers and wage earner
feel tlie pressure of hard times when
the cost of the ami will be the tar
get for the first assault It will be
well then if evert dollar spent can
be justified It has been shown oer
and oter again that the country is
neter pecunious but alwajs approve
of large expenditures for worthy or
popular objects
And this leads to the question
Why cut down the appropriations
for the District of Columbia at the
moment when the work of perfecting
the boautj of the Capital City is ex
citing so much enthusiasm here and
elsewhere Dors anjone suppose that
cheese paring at this point will be
popular
Tenet of Modern Wnrfnre
AVhen Aguinaldo At as made a pris
oner at Manila we took it for gi anted
his capaeitj for harm was at an end
IVhen he took the oath of allegiance
we fondly hoped his capacity for goo 1
had at length begun Unfortunately
the Filipino president after the habit
of conterted rebels lias returned to
his old customs and is proving a
greuter danger to the United States
in his position as a enptite than etcu
lie was as a leader in the field
General Chaftee is not the type of
man to rest quiescent with a disturb
ing element in his local jail He is a
man of action of determination tind
so the subtle Aguinaldo will before
long be shipped back to the United
States for safekeeping Once more
the tenets of modern warfare as de
fined by TlTc Hague Conference arc
leading us into a false and absurd po
sition
The Culinn Question
Some Americans who hate traveled
5n Cuba sav that the main difficulty
in the solution of the Cuban problems
in Congress will be that those who are
called upon to settle the question do
not know anything about it If this
be so it is rather a serious matter for
persons who undertake the decision
of questions of grate importance in
the government of a tropical island
without acquainting thqmsehes with
the conditions can get its affairs into
more different kinds of a snarl than
the statesmen of two generations can
untangle
The unrest and dissatisfaction of the
Cubans is of course the largest and
most significant fact In the situation
Human nature maj sometimes be un
reasonable hut when the people of a
large sectionof country are disquieted
and restless it is nsuallj safe to in
fer that they hate a good reason for
it The trouble in this case seems to
be niainlv that the Cubans hate at
present no market for their sugar
and are therefore poor If thet can
get that market in this country with
reduced tariff they can probably gov
ern themseltes if not the will hate
to ask for annexation
Tlie question appears to be whether
we want a Cuban annex or a revised
tariff and there are those who think
that either would be objectionable
It was once said that there are so
many people in this world who do not
know what the want that those who
know what they do not want can
usually atoid getting it This may be
the ease in the present instance
Meanwhile the Cuban is on the fence
placed there by those to whom he
is f upposed to be grateful and he
does not like it It would fake more
philosophy than most folk hate to
make him like it
Tlie strtttiN of tlie Colonic
The Supreme Court has finally set
lit rest all contentions as to the
status of our new island possessions
It is true that it Is impossible to com
prehend the reasons for the decisions
for they are nearl as many as there
are judges on the pretailing side but
while this may color our opinion of
the individual judges it does not
change the law or our duty under it
The settled law is that newly ac
quired territory becomes part of the
United States on its cession by
treaty that after such cession Con-
greiffl alone has power oter the ter
ritory that the clause of the Consti
tution requiring uniformity of taxa
tion does not apply Congress may
therefore enact a special tax law as
tor a Territory etcn Imposing duties
upon Imports carried into it from
other parts of the United States
Until Congress nets Uo imposts can
be levied In such territory or on
goods coming hre from it the right
of the Kxecutitc to do so by his own
volition ceasing the moment the cf
sion goes into effect
iter siuco the signing of the Treaty
-
of Ieace at Paris this internment has
collected the duties imposed lit the
Dingle law upon goods imported into
the countrt liom the Philippines
Taxes arc also imposed on goods car
ried to the islands The eecutite or
ders imposing these taes are now de
clared illegal and the Treasury must
refund the unmet collected
Philippine trade legislation is now
essential and the question comes up
once more as it eame up with relation
to Porto IJico and is coming up again
as to Cuba Are tte to make conces
sions to our new fellow citizens or
keep up the tariff against them
Apparently it will require the ser
thes of an axe to separate most of
the members of the House minority

of war they should receive tbclr commis

efficiency was due In nearly every case to
lack of training These and -other sug

which would be at once atallablo In case

Arkansas is pretty warm and It Is hard
to predict the winner said Mr Charles
D Greaves a lawyer of Hot Springs at
the Raleigh The fight Is between
Ex Got ernor Clark and James K
Jones our present Senator As I am a
Republican tho outcome is not particu
larly Interesting to me The people of
Arkansas will hold an election next
March and decide as between the two
This tlrtually amounts to a direct popu
lar choice of a Senator for In the pri
maries held then en the same day all
over the State thc people will cast their
ballots designating their preference and
the Legislature will subsequently ratify
the selection made by the voters

I think that commercial travelers gen
erally will agree that this has been the
greatest business year since 1S92 said
Mr Edward B Mldlen of New York at
the Raleigh
In my line sliver goods my 6ales this
season hate gone far ahead of any year
except the one mentioned Washington
is a splendid town to do business In thc
people buy liberally and want a superior
quality In 1892 which was the boom
tine that drummers always go back to
sitter goods retailed for 175 an ounce
today the price is 110 per ounce which
speaks eloquently of the depreciation of
the white metal Everybody now can af
ford spoons forks tea sets and the like
that are tho genuine thing and plated
stuff except of the finest and best sort
has been eliminated

Business Is bad In England Germany
Russia and France said Mr B F
Blyihe an American residing In Paris at
the New Wlllard last nlfc ht
The business men of Europe are losing
ground through the Invasion of commer
cial fields by Americans and the trouble
Is that wherever the Yankee gets a foot
hold h Invariably distances his trans
Atlantic competitor Tbe one article of
shoes Imrorted from the United States
and sold In such quantities abroad tells
the whole story Only In France perhaps
can you buy a shoe made so trim and
fitting so neatly as tbe footgear that
comes from the States but the French
man wants for his shoes from 20 to 20
per cent more than he asks for those of
American manufacture And so it goes
wheretcr we do not surpass them In
workmanship we aru at least their equals
and by reason o Yankee machinery can
always undersell them

I spent eighteen months In the Philip
pines said Mr Lloyd M Robblns an at

It is a country that grows on one for It
takes a long time to understand it thor
oughly Our Congressmen who visited
there this summer may think they got to
the bottom of things In the Philippine
archipelago but they couldnt have done
so In tho limited time of their visit Pec
pie who make a hasty survey of the coun
try often come away saying they would
net live over there If the Islands were
tendered them as a gift This kind of
talk Is based on superficial knowledge
but It pleases the men who have located
there permanently and established them
selves In business becauso if the impres
sion becomes general In th United States
that a white man cant live in the Philip
pines ard that It Is a poor sort of region
anyway Immigration from America will
be checked and a monopoly of the busi
ness of thc Islands will be secured for the
few who went there at an early day

with President Roosetelt for a vindication
of her husband
The latter said at different times and
to different persons that he did not think
Governor Jenkins was guilty of the least
dishonesty but that his blunder was one
of Indiscretion The Presidents memo
randum howcter was in effect a scathing
denunciation of Jenkins she stys and
went much further than a rebuke of bad
Judgment
Mrs Jenkins will appeal to the Presi

clean strong administration It will have
a good effect on the business ot the coun
try I am very much pleased to see that
the President recommends civil service
reform for the District
Representative Loudenslager There
were two features of the message which
impressed me particularly the one In re
gard to trusts and the other affecting
the Chinese question The President has
taken tbe correct stand
Charles J Bell President of the Amer
ican Security and Trust Company It Is
a strong message and very characteris
tic of Mr Roosevelt The aggressive at
tack on anarchy is fine and must meet
with universal commendation It seems
to me that the treatment of the trust
question Is admirable Tbe business In
terests ot the country ar recognized as ot
supreme Importance and nothing must be
done to hamper or impede their legitimate
growth But at the same time legislation
Is needful to prevent the great tiw combi
nations of capital from abusing their
privileges and their power

strongest state papers ever presented
and Is characteristic of President Roose
velt

form be extended to tbe employes of the
District Government meets with my
hearty approval

of a statesman It contains more than
mere words It breathes an original force
both striking and delightful The parts to

William B Gurley Stock Broker A
conservative document that will have a
beneficial Influence on the business inter
ests of tbe country and therefore should
favorably affect the stock market
Representative Moody President Roose
velts message Is the beginning of a new
epoch It contains many utterances in
which I concur but what I observed par
ticularly Is the lmportanco it attaches to
sociological problems hitherto disregard
ed by Presidents topics which in my
opinion ore destined to bo tne tre ques
tions of thc country It is the voice of
a new generation
Mr Southard Parker Banker President
Roosevelt realizes that the country Is
wonderfully prosperous and he Is right
ly and commsndably averse to experimen
tation with this prosperity The recom
mendations that he makes ay eminently
conservative and sound It Is a most
cheerful message advocatlns expansion
commercially and politically and will
meet with thc approbation of business
men generally
Representative Grosvenor It Is an
able well written message that will com
mend itself to the people The eulogy of
the late President Is the most beautiful
that has been uttered President Roose

which ara held by all minds

effect
Representative Crowley In many par
ticulars the Presidents message Is the
most remarkable document ever sent to
the Presidents
Congress His comment en
dents assassination is very strong and
it is calculated to direct to himself the
special attention of cranks This shows
however that tho President Is a fearless
man His position on the question of
trusts Is rather curious He wants a
commission appoint f investigate the
and report its conclusions to
Congress with the view of enacting ad
ditional legislation He Is also in fat or
enactment of tbe Chinese exclu
of the re
under the late decls on
sion act and yet
of the United States Supreme Court the
Philippines are bow a part of thc United
States and therefore the Filipinos who
Infinitely lower in the hum in reach of

intelligence are free to pome to this
country and compete with our laborers

tbe President Is an admirable one It
questions which arc likely

memory of his predecessor has been paid

runs through every line of the msagc

manlike manner I cannot endorse how

A Few Opinions on the
Presidents Message to Conn ess
New York Sun Mr Roosevelt has taken
a conscientious view of his constitutional
duty to keep Consress Informed as to
the state of tho Union and in an earnest
straightforward and most vigorously
comprehensive fashion highly creditable
to his sense of official responsibility he
has presented many problems and dis
cussed many sets of social commercial
and political conditions Long as Is Mr
Roosevelts first annual communication to
the Congress It Is by no mean hard
reading This Is due to the clearness of
his style the Inclslteness ot his thought
and not least of all the spirit ot honest
patriotic endeavor manifest throughout
Its many periods
Senator Hoar The message Is excel
lent It U a very able and clear state
ment ot the opinion and attitude ot the
Republican AdminUtratlon without any
attempt at pomposity or official phraseol
ogy and In a straightforward manly
practical style rising sometimes to a very
high tloqiince It expresses exactly wbt
I think and feel with two exceptions
When he says that we am extremely anx
ious that the natives of tte Philippine
Islands should govern themselves for their
sake and becnute it relieves us of a great
burden and that there is cot the slight
est fear of our not giving them all tbe
liberty for which they are fit and that wo
shall help to make them fit for self-government
after th fashion of really free
nations I think he should state clearly
and emphatically that he means by self
government what the people of the United
Slates hate always meant by
right to natiojal Independ
ence It they dtsirc It I think he should
say in terms that when they have a gov
ernment fairly representing their people
able to mtlntaln Itself and that govern
ment cxrrcsxes Its desire for absolute na
tional independence that the United Slates
will cot he In their way

BERLIN Dec 3 The debate on the
new tariff bill was resumed In tbe Reichs
tag today Count von
Imperial Secretary of State for the
Interior cited the Unfed States as an ex
ample to be followed In the matter of
tariffs His reference to the opponents
ot the tariffs as wanting In sense and
national pride caused an uproar among
the members of the Left
Count von Posadowskt said the present
tariff scheme was comparatively simple
It contained 3S7 sections compared with
654 In Prances scheme and 740 In the
United States tariff The obiect aimed at
was not to admit foreign goods too easily
but yet not to legislate so as to cause
prohibitive duties against foreign coun
tries
It was a mistake to suppose that the
tariff of the United Stales was directed
solely against Germany It was directed
against the entire world
He pleaded strongly the cause ot the
agriculturalists and expressed the firm
Intention of the Government of making
fresh commercial treaties

NEW YORK Dec 3 Amon the pas
sengers sailing for England today on the
Kronprinz Wllhelm was Sir Christopher
Furness M P who has been on a tour
ot thc United States and Canada with
the aim of ascertaining directly both tLe
general trade resources of this country
and Canada and tbe practicability of es
tablishing a great steel manufactory In
tbe Dominion
Sir Christopher is at the head of Fur
ness Withy Co and of the Fumess
Steamship Company and Is connected
with various large shipbuilding railroad
and engineering concerns of Great Brit
ain He owns It is said 125 ships and ex
pects to own twice the number in a couple
of vears
He looked into the mines and coal fields
of Cape Breton with a view it is under
stood of learning where a large steel
plant could be erected and operated with
profit It was said by a member of Sir
Christophers party that the cost of the
contemplated plant would be about 10
OcJ000 but Sir Christopher said be did
not intend Just now to take tho public into
his confidence regarding the steel plant
or the possibilities of one In Canada
He spoke freely about railroads before
he sailed
Our railroads in England will have to
alter their methods he sad If Eng
land is to hold her own in the Industrial
world Just compare the hauling of thirty
cars carrying fifty tons each by one en
gine with what Is done by our Durham or
Northumberland lines It Is astonishing
And the wonder of It Is that the cost of
hauling these 1500 tons is not a bit great
er than would be the cost ot drawing S00
tons on tho other side How- can our
country compete with your railways with
a giant difference ot that kind
