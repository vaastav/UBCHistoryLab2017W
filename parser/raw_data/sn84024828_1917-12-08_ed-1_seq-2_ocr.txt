President Wilson, in his message to
congress last Tuesday, gave a clear
and distinct characterization of Amer
ica's interest and participation in the
world, war and drove home the state
ment that not until Germany has been
'defeated and the plain people of Ger
Imany are ready for a durable peace
will the United States sheathe the
sword. Many consider this address by
the president the greatest war docu
ment and the greatest speech yet
made.
The Miner considers the meisage of
enough importance to publish it in
full. It is as follows:
The president spoke as follows:
"Gentlemen of the Congress
"Eight months have elapsed since
I la3t had the honor of addressing you.
They have been months crowded with
events of immense and grave signifi.
cance for us.
"I shall not undertake to detail or
even to summarize those events. The
practical particular of the part we
have played in them will be laid be
fore you in the reports, of the execu
tive departments.
"I shall discuss only our present out
look upon these vast affairs, our pres
ent duties and the immediate means of
accomplishing 'the objects we shall
hold always in view.
"I shall not go back to debate t the
causes of the war. The intolerable
wrongs done and planned against us
by the sinister masters of Germany
have long since become too grossly
obvious and odious to every true
American to need to be rehearsed. But
I shall ask-you to consider again, and
with a very grave scrutiny, our ob
jectives and the measures by which
we mean to attain them: for the pur
pose of discussion here in this place
is action, and our action must move
straight towards definite ends.
"Our object is, of course, to win the
war, and we shall not slacken or suf- onlv wh thG &rmgn DeoD,G sav to
fer ourselves i to be diverted until lit ius , through properly accredited rep
is won. But it is worth while MnSjrCsentativesfthat they are ready to
and answering the question: When agree t0 a settlement based upon jus
shall we consider the war won? , , Mt; , ,

"From one point of view it is not
necessary to broach this fundamental
matter. I do not doubt that the Amer
ican people know what the war is
about and what sort of an outcome
they will regard as a realization of
their purpose in it. As a nation we
are united in spirit and intention. I
pay little heed to those who tell me
otherwise.
"L hear the voices of dissent who
does not? I hear the criticism and
the clamor of the noisily thoughtless
and troublesome.
"I also sed, men here and- there
fling themselves in impotent disloy
alty against the calm, indomitable
power of the nation. I hear men de
bate peace who understand neither
its nature nor the way in which we
may attain it, with uplifted eyes and
unbroken spirits. But I know1, that
none of these speak for the nation.
They do not touch the heart or any
thing. They may safely be .left to
strut their uneasy hour and be for
gotten. "But from another point of view I
believe it is necessary to say plainly
that we here at the seat of action
consider the war to be for and what
part we mean to play in the settle
ment of its searching issues. We are
the spokesmen of the American peo
ple, and they have a right to know
whether their purpose is ours. They
desire peace by the overcoming of evil,
by the defeat once, for all of the sinis
ter forces that interrupt peace and
render it impossible, and they wish to
know how closely our thought runs
with theirs and what action we pro
pose. "They are impatient with those who
desire peace by any sort of compro
mise deeply and indignantly impa
tient but they will be equally impa
tient with us if we do? not make it
plain to them what our objectives are
and what we are planning for in seek
ing to make conquest of peace by
arms.
"I- believe that I speak for them
when I say two tilings: First, that
this intolerable thing of which the
masters of Germany have shown us
the ugly face, this menace of com
bined intrigue and force which we
now see so clearly as the German
power, a thing without conscience or
honor of capacity for covenanted
peace, must be crushed, and if it be
not utterly brought to an end, at least
shut out from the friendly intercourse
of the nations; and, second, that when
this thing and its power are indeed
can discuss peace whetf the German
people have spokesmen whose word
we can believe and when those
spokesmen are ready in ,the name of
their people to accept the common
judgment of the nations as to what
shall henceforth be the bases of law
and of covenant for the Ufa" of the
world we shall be willing and glad to
pay the full price for peace and pay
it ungrudgingly.
"We know what the price of peace
will be. It will be full, impartial jus
tice justice done at every point and
tq every nation the final settlement
must affect, our enemies as well as
our friends.
. "You catch, with me, the voices of
humanity that are in the air. They
grow a any more audible, more artic
ulate, more persuasive, and they come
from the hearts of then everywhere.
They insist that the war shall not
end in vindictive action of any kind;
that no nation or people shall be
robbed or punished because the ir
responsible rulers of a single coun
try have" themselves done dn and
abominable wrong. It is this thought
that has been expressed in the
formula, 'No annexations, no contri
butions, jio punitive indemnities.'
"Just ' because this crude formula
expresses the instinctive judgment as
to right of plain men everywhere it
has been made diligent use of by the
masters of German intrigue to lead
the people of Russia astray and the
people of every other country their
agents could reach, in order that a
premature peace mirfit be broncrht
.about before autocracv has
taught its final and convincing les
son 'and the people of the world put
in control of their own gestinies.
j "But the fact that a wrong use
! has-been made of a just idea is no
reason why a right use should not be
made of it It ought to be brought un
der the patronage of its real friends.
Let it be said, again that autocracy !
muse nrsr. De shown the utter futility
of its claims to power or leadership
in the modern world.
"It is impossible to apply any stand
ard pt justice so long ai such forces
arc unchecked and undefeated flip

Not until that has been donr; can right
be set up as arbiter and peacemaker
among the nations. But when that has
been done as God willing, it assured
lly will be wo shall at last be free
to do an unprecedented thing and this
is the time to avow our purposes to
do it.
) "We shall be free to base peace on
I generosity and justice, to the exclu
sion of all selfish claims to advantage
even on the part of the victors.
"Let there be no misunderstand
ing. Our present and immediate task
is to win the war, and nothing shall
their rulers have done. They have
done a wrong to Belgium which must
be repaired. They have established
a power over other lands and peoples
itlian their own over the great em
pire of Austria-Hungary, over hither-
to free Balkan states, over Turkey
and within Asia which must be re-
linguished.
"Germany's success by skill, by in
dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise,
we did not grudge or oppose, but ad
mired rather. She had built up for
herself a real empire of trade and
influence, secured by the peace of the
world. We were content to abide the
rivalries of manufacture, science and
commerce that were involved for us
in her success and stand or fall as we
had,, or did not have the brains and
the initiative to surpass her.
"But at the moment when she had
conspicuously won her triumphs of
peace she threw them away to estab
lish in their stead what the world will
no longer permit to be established, mil
itary and political domination by arms,
by which to oust where she could not
excel the rivals she most feared and
hated.
"The1 peace we make must remedy
that wrong. It must deliver the once
fair lands and happy peoples of Bel
gium and northern France from the
Prussian conquest and the Prussian
menace, but it must also deliver the
people of the Balkans and the peo
ple of Turkey, alike'in. Europe and in
Asia, from the impudent and alien
domination of the Prussian military
and commercial autocracy.
"We owe it, however, to ourselves
to say that we do not wish in any
way to impair or rearrange the Aus-txo-Hungarian
empire. It is no affair
of ours what they do with theirf own
life, either industrially or politically.
We do not purpose or desire to dic
tate to them in any way.
"We only .desire to see that their
affairs are left in their own hands
in all matters, great or smalL We
shall hope to secure for the peoples of
the Balkan peninsula and for the peo
ple oil the Turkish empire the right
ana opportunity to make their own
lives safe, their own fortunes secure
against oppression or injustice and
from the dictation of foreign courts
or parties.
