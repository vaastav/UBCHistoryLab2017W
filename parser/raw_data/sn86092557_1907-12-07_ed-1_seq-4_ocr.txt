RECEIVES TAFT
RUSSIA'S KEEN INTEREST IN
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT
IS SHOWN.
ST, PETERSBURG. Dec. G.?Secretary
Taft was received In audience by
| Czar Nicholas at Tsarskoe-Selo and re\
celved from him the frankest expression
of Russia's sentiments of sympathy
and regard for the United States.
The Czar requested Mr. Taft to con-|
vey his greetings to President Roose-j
volt.
| The Secretary spent about five hours |
In company with thd Czar and enjoyed
the honor of a long and intimate con.
vernation regarding the situation In i
the United States and the problems I
'confronting the American government
J The Czarina Is suffering so severs* j
1y from an attack of Influenza that she I
\vas obliged to refrain from tnklng!
part In any of the official ceremony;
f consequently, Mr. Taft did not see her.
He was presented, however, to the other
members of the royal family, and
, to many high mllitary-and court officials.
j On account of the Secretary's ex-1
! pressed desire that be be received unofficially,
no salute was fired, but the
reception was given a military setting
by a parade and regimental festival
jof the Semenoxsky Regiment, the ofil
cm or winch attended the luncheon
with Mr. Tnft.
The Secretary, accompanied by Rrlgadler
General Clarence Tt. Edwards,1
who Is of his party; Capt. S. L. II.
Plocuni, the American military attache
hero, and Count Konltz, the Russian
^jfllcer who Is 'acting ns his aid
during his sojourn In this city, left St.
Petersburg at an early hour on a special
train for Tsarshoe-Sclo. At TsnrFkoe
Sclo the party was met by a state
equipage arm several court officials.
The visitors were driven direct to the
socnllcd "Little Palace," the residence (
'f the Cznr. and escorted through, the1
palace with the usual ceremonial.
"Secretary Taft was received by the;
Czar in Ills private study. He questioned
Mr. Taft concerning his journey
over the Trans-Siberinn railroad, and
drew n contrast between the present
moans of communication and the method
in vogue?three-horse sleighs and
steamers acros the rivers and lakes?
when hp made his trip across Asia
Minor to inaugurate the trans-Siberian
lines. The Czar showed a keen
interest in the problems which the
American government has to solve in
the Philippine Islands, and he asked
many questions concerns ine new
Philippine Assembly. He referred,
also, In a complimentary manner to
the work done by the American government
on the Isthmus of Panama In
its light against yellow fever.
Secretary Taft was the guest of
honor last night at a banquet given by
M. Iswolsky, the foreign minister,
which was attended by the leaders of
i the Russian state. The occasion was
j marked by great cordiality and the oxchange
or mutual hopes that the bonds
of friendship between the two coun'
trios would he strengthened.
' Mrs. Taft learned last night of the
j E'Tfous illness of Mr. Taft's mother,
and decided t oabandon her European
trip and to return with the Secretary

the average, a bank'takes In as much
money (com .lay to .lay at the window
of the receiving teller ns It paaaea out
at the window of the paying teller. It
lei merely neceesary ta keep -on *han?l' \
a. certain percentage/oti-lfo retiree*
as a reserve fund to meet possible
emergencies _when demands for pay
ment tiro much in excess or current j
deposits. The great butk of the re
sources of the bank, meanwhile, is
supposed to be placed in the hands of
business people in the form of interestbearing
loans. No. legitimate condition
of business is ever going to compel
[all depositors to make a wild rush at
I the same time to draw their money out
ot all the banks. ; .
When such; a riisii occurs the reasons
are psychological. People have
I become panic-stricken with the Idea
that the banks are unsafe, and that
the; must get their, money out at the
quickest possible moment." The money
once out is, under such circumstances,
hoarded until the people are
In a different state of. niirid. They
lock it up In sufo-deposit boxes;- or
hide It in various ways about their
homes. It is thus taken out of the
channels of business circulation, and
there ensues?if such a movement is
t fde.-'.pread?a condition that makes
v. hot is called a currency famine. A
;;reat part of the ordinary business of
the country is carried on by mean^of
v. hat is known as credit. Thus, in the
autumn, nil over the country there are'
I roiiucers of corn, whcnt, cotton, and
other natural products who are in the
habit of selling their crops at the nearest
market town to dealers who pay
them In. cash. Theso dealers in turn
/iell to the large market centers, and
the crops are thus distributed for domestic'
and foreign use. This series
of transactions, known as the "movement
of the crops," rests in lnrge part
upon the banks, which are accustomed j
to advance 'the money with which to
pay the farmers and the local dealers, j
Tile crops are so vast and so valuable
that the sums of money engaged in
marketing them, are also enormous.
hut the banks in turn are dependent
upon their regular depositors for
pv they are able to lend for the purpose
of facilitating this vast crop
movement and other analogous trans-'
actions, such as the distribution of the
winter's supply of coal, of dry-goods
and general merchandise,- and so on. J
And if people who usually deposit mon
ey lu the banks are not only afraid
to make fresh deposits, but are simultaneously
scrambling to withdraw all
that they have already deposited, It (
I Is evident that the banks cannot, with i
their usuui confidence and * freedom, j
supply the means with which to lubri-1
cate the marketing of crops, and the j
distribution of other commodities. If |
the banks are suddenly put In a condition
where they cannot extend the customary
credit to the manufacturers,
the johers, and the mercantile community
at large it is easy on reflection
to see what a frightful check my be
placed upon the ordinary freedom of
the' so-called distributive process.
Now it is just tlieso phenomena that
we have been witnessing for some
weeks past in the United States. ?j

The Message
WIDE VARIETY OF VIEWS EXPRESSED
BY THE LEADING
PAPERS.
Washington Herald.
Opinions may differ as to the wisdom
or"the expediency of Mr. Roosevelt's
economic proposals; there Will
lH no doubt as to the ends aimed at,
or as to the means by which he would
attain hiB ends. The President is- a1
thoroughgoing nationalist, as well as
a firm believer in the efficacy of state
action to accomplish social and economic
reforms. On almost every page
v. ".o iutirmi(,c Ilia/ UC lUUIIU BUIIIC Bugpesllon
for what he calls "extension
of federal activity." Ills plans, for
the regulation of railroads and of Industrial
corporations through a federal
incorporation law arc familiar to
the public. Mr. Roosevelt entertains
no doubt as to the existence of federal
power to charter such corporations,
and his conviction that the legislation
he proposes would'bene lit railroad and
other corporations is equally* prono,
inced.
New York Herald.,
Hpon many of the subjects dealt
with In his unmercifully long message
tho President, is either fraternallstlc
or socialistic--fraternallstlc in suggesting
federal. supervision of corporations
and national Incorporation or
national license for railways; socialistic
in commending a federal graduated
tax upon Incomes and inheritances. In
shut, It is a very prolix and soporlflo
message nnd?much of it being academic?it
has the distinct merit of containing
nothing to revive the disturbance
from the effects of which the
country Is now recovering.
New York Evening Post.
if nnj body looked for a retraction of
the President's radical Ideas, or\even
discreet silence about them, lie will
be disappointed by the message'. They
arc all there. Mr. Roosevelt Is still
for widely extending and. vigorously exerting
the powers of the federal government
over rallronds and all other
corporations doing an Interstate business.
He has finally gone over to the
Bryan plan (which Secretary Taft
condemned) of malting railways and
other corporations take out a federal
license.
New York Times.
Wall street and the country receive
the message as a conservative and
chastened document. That thfe* President
heeds even to this extent the criticism
that has been visited upon him
for his too frequent rashness of speech
is of good augury. Nervous people
have a right to take comfort from this
evidence of the new temper that possesses
hlm._
New York Tribune.
Behind practically all of the President's
recommendations stands the realization
that regulation by the community
and for the community is the
surest means of curing the evils which
have sprung from too great an effacemont
of the state and too great an exaltation
of the freedom of the Individual.
This conception accounts for hi3
suggestions as to. the regulation of
milrliids and trusts, the enforcement
on the employer of enlarged liability.
the Imposition of Income and inheritance
taxes, the establishment of au
eight-hour day for labor and the many
other curbs sought to be put on ultralndividunlistic
activity.
Philadelphia Press.
Hut while principles are unchanged,
the manner and method are greatly altered..
The entiro message breathes
a sober appreciation of the profound
change worked. In the perspective of
legislation by tho sudden transition
from teeming prosperity to clouded
financial skies and the chill of Industrial
depression.
Washington Post.
Mr. Roosevelt has utilized the occasion.
