Just at present, the government
Of France finds absorbing occupation
In voting confidence in itself.
It is rumored that, notwithstanding
all the fuss about the transfer of the
Dewey home, the admiral insisted
upon retaining the night key.
After Senator Hanna gets through
making his senseless assertion that
there are no trusts, perhaps he may
be able to explain why he cponds so
much time and energy in defending
them.
If the figures of the experts are re
liable, Boston drinks more whiskey
than any other city in the country
Yet no one has accused her of be
coming boozy enough to fall off ben
6elf-erected pedestal of perfection.
After Speaker Henderson gets all
bis aspirants for chairmanships satis
factordly placed, he should go out in
the cloak rooms and ascertain the
wishes of the hat hooks. There were
days when a former speaker found
those hooks very useful and interest
ing when he desired to count a quo
rum.
It sometimes requires more real
courage to face the battle of life than
to face powder, lead and cold steel.
This is shown in the recent suicide of
Bill Anthony, who distinguished him
self at the time of the blowing up of
the Maine by his cool and matter-of-fact
report of the affair to Captain
Sigsbee.
Members of the House of Represen
tatives who are about to take their
seats and be sworn in have had eleven
months since their election to reflect
on their responsibilities, and have
enjoyed eleven months of government
pay. This ought to prepare them to
vote on one thing at least, to wit, a,
change that will bring the election
and the service of a Congressman
closer together.
The Hon. Chauncey M. Depew has
succeeded in evading the state inher
itance tax on a bequest of $200,000, on
the ground that the money was left to
him "in recognition of his services"
as friend and legal adviser to the tes
tator. We congratulate Mr. Depew
on saving $10,000 that morally be
longs to the state treasury, but we
venture to suggest that a United
States Benator charged with the duty
of making laws for the nation, might
set a better example than that of
dodging the laws of the state. New
York Journal.
If Congress "fires" Roberts it must,
to be consistent, take notice of the
recognition of polygamy in the . Sulu
Islands. The Sultan of the Sulu Is
lands, who is under a salary from the
treasury of the United States, has a
rather more offensive harem than Mr.
Roberts maintains, though the moral
principle involved is substantially the
same in both cases. Congress has a
troublesome question on hand, and
doesn't know what to do with "tt.
The moral and the statutory laws are
getting mixed, and the most adroit
trimmer cannot untangle them.
MINORITY LEADER IN CONGRESS.
In the selection of Hon. James D.
Richardson, of Tennessee, to be the
leader of the Democratic forces In tho
House of Representatives the Demo
crats acted wisely. Mr. Richardson
is a valuable leader, in that he has the
judicial temperament to weigh all
things well. He will make no mis
takes. He is a seasoned member of
the House and an acknowledged par
liamentarian of rare skill. Under his
guidance the best results for the par
ty and the country are assured. Cin

M'KINLEY ON TRUSTS.
In - his message President Mc
Klnley spoke of the dire necessity of
curbing trusts and combinations in
restraint of trade when- his words
were scarcely cold from recommend
ing, in carefully couched language,
the already notorious Hanna-Payne
subsidy bill, which is calculated to
breed one of the biggest trusts ever
known in the way of a merchant ma
rine trust. The Hanna-Papne com
bination will try to get a bill through
Congress which will enable it to draw
several millions a year as subsidies
from the government, said subsidies
to come, of course from the people,
and calculated to amount to $200,000,
000 in fifty years. As the subsidy is
based on tonnage, it is not difficult
to see how easily it will be for a
marine trust to get control of the.
biggest part of the shipping and hence
the biggest part of the subsidies. The
following is the smooth way Hanna's
man recommends this marine trust:
"The other great nations have not
hesitated to adopt the required means
to develop their shipping as a fac
tor In national defense and as one of
the surest and (speediest means of ob-

Any one predisposed to Scrofula can

Consumption. Being such a deep-seated

it is the only remedy which can reach

Scrofula is an obstinate blood disease,
and is beyond the reach of the average
blood medicine. Swift ' Speoiflo

Even the seeming sacrifices, which
at the beginning may be involved

By the "required means" no .doubt
is meant "subsdizlng," and by the
"seeming eacrlfleces involved at the
beginning" is doubtless meant the
burden which the people will have to
bear in order that the Marine trust
may get the subsidies.
THAT "UNDERSTANDING."
(Chicago Tribune.)
When Mr. Chamberlain, after
threatening France with the resent
ment of England, undertakes to speak
for the United States likewise when
he intimates with it American re
sentment it is proper to inquire by
what authority he speaks. Who has
assured the secretary for the colonies
that if the French need drubbing for
caicaturing the Queen the United
States may be counted upon to lend
their moral if not their material sup
port to the proceeding?
Mr. Chamberlain makes public an
nouncement of an understanding be
tween his own government and that
at Washington as well as with the
imperial government at Berlin. With
whom has Downing street negotiated
an alliance express or implied
with this nation? Who has commit
ted the United States to the support
of Great Britain either as against
France or as against any other power?
The question is by no means an idle
one.
We may be sure that Mr. Chamber
Iain is not making such -assertions
without warrant. Whatever may be
thought of his political principles, no
one takes Mr. Chamberlain for a fool
and a fool he would be if he, a min
ister of the crown, were to make pub
11c declarations concerning interna'
tional agreements which could be dis
proved by a tlegram from Washington
Mr. Chamberlain is backed up by the
facta when he declares that there is
an Anglo-American understanding.
The question is, who on this side of
the Atlantic committed the United
States to the understanding?
No treaty has been submitted to
the United States Senate. No mem
orandum for such a treaty has been
announced from .the state department
at Washington. So far as the lawful
and recognized treaty-making power
of this republic Is concerned there has
been no agreement such as Mr. Cham
berlain indicates, and there can be
none prior to the assembling of Con
gress.
But there could be and there un
doubtedly has been action by some
one in Washington. Assurances hav
been given which are fully as effec
tive as a written treaty, seeing that
those assurances proceed from a
source which controls the American
army and navy. The confidence with
which Mr. Chamberlain speaks Is
proof, positive that William McKlnley
or John Hay, acting for William Mc-
Kinley, has secretly usurped the
treaty-making power to an extent
which warrants England in shaking
American sympathy as a club at
France and the rest of the world.
The first proceeding of Congress
should be to demand the correspond
ence of the state department with Am
bassador Choate and Lord Paunce-
fote.

MOUNTAIN BREEZES.
Young Man Who Was Hurt at Wagon
Mound Recovering Politics and
Public Schools Discussed.
Rociada, N. M., Dec. 1. The . as
sault and robbery committed upon the
person of young Matias Bustos at
Wagon Mound, has created consider
able indignation among tbe people up
here. The boy had been employed
during the' summer by John Penda-
rais and thinking that he was not
earning enough money, requested his
parents to let him go somewhere else
in search of work. AKnough he was
not feeling well he started for Las
Vegas where-he found employment
with the grading outfit He grew
worse and while at work at Wagon
Mound suffered from stomach trouble
He then thought lit necessary to go
to Las Vegas and see a doctor.
Your correspondent made several
visits to see him during the last few
days and found him in a serious con :
dlilon. In explaining the case Bus
tos says that he offered a trainman
fifty cents with which to pay for a
ride to a place two hundred yards
from the depot where the scrapers
were, the trainman accepted the offer
and at the place mentioned he got off
the train. It appears that in jump
ing from the car he was knocked
senseless It was at this place that
ue was so brutally pounded and lefl
for what his assailants supposed to be
a dead man. His money was taken
out of his pocket and the would-be-murderers
made , good their escape.
The-probability Is that the boy was
assaulted just at the time of leav
ing the train. .
Parents, relatives and friends of
the boy have been making every pos
sible effort to discover the dastardly
and cowardly perpetrators of the deed
and if caught they would likely be
tried by Judge Lynch who is always
out of politics and never seeks votes
.either for himself or anybody else.
Personal observation of the politi
cal arena ought to satisfy every man
with a fair mind and average Intel
ligehce that there exists among the g.
3. p. bosses considerable bad feeling,
and the symptoms of destruction and
split are very apparent The fight is
not for the welfare of the par'y its
self, is not for gold, is not for silver,
Is not for greenbacks, but It is a strug
gle for supremacy and office holding
It looks to a man up a tree that a
great portion of the g. o. p'e. are yet
is hungry as ever.
Now let us talk a little in regard
to our public schools in San Miguel
county. It seems that in some cases
and districts little or no attention is
paid as to how the public schools are
conducted. The school laws of New
Mexico, at present, are very good and
cover all the ground necessary for
the conduct of a true system of pub
lic schools if properly enforced, '.it
we notice with regret that in s me
cases the law has been wilfully and
maliciously disregarded and too many
fail to appreciate the educational ad
vantages afforded our children by
our statutes.
People who have never attended s
meeting of the Normal Institute for
teachers and who have never at
tempted and could not pass an exam
lnation for teachers, have been em
ployed as teachers, and the worse
feature is that they are entirely un;i
ble to perform their duties as sucl
and entirely incompetent.
An examination of some of the
schools by our school superintendent
will satisfy him that these are facts
and for the sake of the childern con
cerned, as well as the tax-paying
sommunity who foot the bills, a close
Investigation of this matter ought, by
right and justice, be made by those
who are in charge of the educational
affairs of our county.

MEXICO'S GREAT PROSPERITY.
The Silver Republic's Wonderful
Prosperity During the Past Year,
A remarkable and most gratifying
statement has been sent to Congress
by Finance Minister Llmantour and
will be received with Interest by all
bondholders, for it shows the mar
velous improved position of the Mexi
can treasury, which is now able, so
ample are the revenues, to propose to
Congress a reduction of the federal
taxes. The cash revenue for the fis
cal year, ended June last, was $60
022,349, wholly derived from the usual
and normal sources and much in ex
cess of the finance minister's estimate,
most conservatively made, while the
returns for five months of the present
fiscal year show an increase over last
year. In view of this prosperous con
dition of Mexico's revenues Minister
Llmantour sends several bills to Con
gress of ' great Importance. Some
$4,000,000 are appropriated for public
works of prime necessity, including
new school houses in the federal dis
trict, new posofflce buildings
at Vera Cruz, and other edifices.

FHhlng for Health.
When a man breaks down with that
dread disease, consumption, and recognizee
his condition, he starts out to fish for
health. He tries this thing and that thing.
He consults this doctor and that doctor.
He indulges in all kinds of absurd athletic
exercises. He tnes first one climate and
then another. He tries the rest cure and
tbe work cure. He grows steadily Worse.
That is the story of most consumptives.
Finally, when the consumptive dies, the
doctor shrugs his shoulders and pronounces
consumption incurable.- A thirty years'
test of Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Dis
covery has demonstrated that it cures 08
per cent, of all capes oi consumption, n
taken in the earlier stages of the disease,
before the lune;s are too I or wasted, in a
consumptive there is a weaker spot than
even the lungs. That spot is the stomach.
A consumptive never really begins to die
until his stomach gives out. The "Golden
Medical Discovery" not only Draces up
the atomach, but acts directly on the
lungs, healing them and driving out all
impurities. Honest medicine dealers will
not urge yon to take an inferior substitute.
I had a very bad couifh, also night-sweats.
and was almost in my grave with consumption,"
writes Mrs. Clara A. iwcimyre, nox 171, ash
land. Middlesex Co., Mass. !' A friend of mine
who had died with cotisuniptiou came to me in
a dream and told mc to take Dr. l'iercc's Golden
Medical Discovery, and. tiiant tne i.oni, 1 aia
so. By tne lime 1 naa lasea nun ui inc uim
bottle I felt much better. 1 kept on until 1 naa
taken three bottles. That waa all I needed. I
got weU and strong again."
Whenever constitution is one of the com
plicating causes of disease, the most perfect
remedy is Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets,
which are always effective, yet absolutely
mild and harmless. There never was any
remedy invented wliieh can take their
place. They never gripe.
The government further proposes to
purchase some outstanding silver
bonds bearing G per cent interest and
will also abolish export taxes on oof
fee, which will be a boon to the coffee
growers. It will, In addition, reduce
several Internal revenue taxes, not
ably those on bank checks, life insur
ance policies and the tax imposed on
new companies according to the
amount of their capital and other re
forms welcomed by the public.
The government has now a casfa sur
plus of many millions of dollars and is
amply able to carry out its reforms
as revenues from all sources show
natural and gratifying increase.
