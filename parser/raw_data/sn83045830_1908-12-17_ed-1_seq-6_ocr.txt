(By Associated Pre as.)
NEW YORK. Doc. 16.?Then- ?ras
considerable re-purchase of slocks to?
day largely by those who had sold
yesterday and the day before. A re?
covery iu prices was the consequence.
The market, however, continued nar?
row and professional, much of the
buying being attributed to the cover
Ing of short contracts p it out during
the previous selling. {
The upward movement was encour?
aged by some of the events of the
day. The speculation Is still restrict
ed by the diminished resources of the
money market and tb>- situation In
that respect remained the principal
subject of consideration. The posi?
tion has not reached that of stringen?
cy such as forces out speculative
stockholdings by calling of loans, but
available resources are required for
other purposes than speculation.
The level of lntere-st rateB both on
call and on time has now reached
a higher figure than at any time since
January 1. The present condition
has come to prevent sufficient tight?
ness In the money market to remove
the artificial stinrilvs to speculation
which grew out of the bulky accumu?
lation of idle funds in bank reserves.
The official announcemt nt of the
placing of the year's order for steel
rails by the Pennsylvan'a Railroau
was an important event owing to the
long discussion that has gone on be?
tween the parties over the specifica?
tions fn the contract. The waiting
on this settlement has been given as
a motive for holding up of orders for
materials all through the railroad
world, which it is :i.-s;:ui. >i will be re?

probably arrive in Richmond next
week and be placed in the Confeder?

When the veterans <>f Richtn-md

thought that it would be on a par with
that of Stuart and other monumcn**
in the city and some aversion to atae
ing W!rs in so high a place? was ex
1 pressed. Later however, j: was see-i
that the moimment Is a simple shaft

PARTIES UNITE TO

(Continued from First Page).
man. in his piercing voice, "whether
he thinks the Senate has been insult?
ed?''
Mr Hale Insisted that every one
had his own opinion on that subject
and anyone was as able as he to form
an opinion. Coming again to his
feet quickly Mr Tillman said that ac?
cording to the President's message
Congress is composed of a lot of "ras?
cals and scoundrels, who belong In
the penitentiary."
Mr. Hale replied that there had
been a great deal of restlessness and
lmiig.H ion in the Senate."
"There is no re?tlessness at tb>
White House," retorted Mr. Tillman.
"They are cool and calm as can b?
there."
"I think." continued Mr. Bailey, "that
it is remarkable that the question
whether the honor of Congress has
been impeache i should be in any way
connected with a question of the
secret service, except so far as the
secret service was employed to in?
vestigate members of the two Houses
of Congress."
Deliberate Insult. Says Culberson.
Saying he had not heard the mes?
sage when it was read to the Senate
Mr. Culbers'.n said: "It was a de?
liberate, studied and outrageous In?
sult to the Congress by the Prest- <
dent."
He would have preferred to see still
stronger language used in the reso
lutkin. but contented himself with it
as it has l>een agreed upon
Senator New lands spoke at con
siderable length >a.ving thst the qucs
tion at issue was whether the si-cref
service had been used to Investigate
congiessmen in the pursuance of their
legislative duties or was only to de?
tect fraud in the .juries, devolving up?
on the legislative departments.
"But" Interposed Mr. Tillman. "the
President s mess tee shows that h?
has Investigated ris generally, and that
we are a lot of scoundrels that aeed
