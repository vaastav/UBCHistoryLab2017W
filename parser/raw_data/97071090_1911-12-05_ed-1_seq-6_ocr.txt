"Tobacco Trust Decision an Effective

Commission Proposed The Test of
"Reasonableness."
To tho Senate and ITouse of Kepre
pcnttitlvcs: 'This message Is the first of several
which I shall send to coup-ess during
tlie Interval between the opening of
lit) regular session and its adjourn
ment for tho Chrikmas holidays. The
amount of information to be commu
nicated ns to the ojveratloiis of the
government, the number of importnnt
tnibjeets calling for comment by the
executive and tho transmission to con
gress of exhaustive rtqwrts of special
commissions make it Impossible to In
clude In one message of n reasonable
length n discussion of the topics that
ought to bo brought to the attention
of the national legislature nt Its ilrst
regular session.
The Antitrust Law Tha Supreme
'" Court Decisions.
'In May last the supreme court hand
ed down decisions in the suits in equi
ty brought by the United States to en
Join the further maintenance of the
Standard Oil tmst and of the Ameri
can Tobacco trust nnd to secure their
dissolution. The decisions are eiocU
making and serve to advise the busi
ness world authoritatively of the
scope nnd operation of the anti-trust
net of 1S0O. Tho decudlns do not de
part in any substantial way from the
previous decisions of the court in con
struing nnd applying this important
statute, but they clarify those deci
sions by further defining the already
admitted exceptions to the literal con
struction of the act. By the decrees
they furnish n useful precedent as to
tlie proper method of dealing with the
capital and property of Illegal trusts.
These decisions suggest the need nnd
wlsdotnoff additional or supplemental
legislation to make it easier for the
entire business community to square
with the rule of action and legality
thus Anally established and to pre
serve the benefit, freedom and spur of
reasonable competition without loss of
renl efficiency or progress.
No. Change in the Rule of. -Decision,
.Merely In Its Form of Expression.
The stntutc in Its first section de
clares to be illegal "every contract,
combination In the form of trust or
otherwise or conspiracy In restraint
of trade or commerce among the sev
eral states or with foreign nations"
mid in the second declares guilty of n
misdemeanor "every person who shall
mouoiwllze or attempt to monopolize
or combine, or conspire with any other
persou to monopolize any part of the
trade or commerce of tho several Btntes
or with forelgu nations."
vJu two early cases, where the statute
was Invoked to eujoln n transporta
tion rate agreement between inter
state railroad companies, it was held
that It was uo defense to show thnt
tho agreement ns to rates complained
of was reasonable nt common law, be
cause It was said thnt the statute was
directed against all contracts ami com
binations In restraint of trade, whether
reasonable nt common law or not. It
was plalu from tho record, however,
that the contracts complained of in
those cases would not have been deem
ed reasonable at common law, lu sub
sequent cases the court wild that the
statute should tie given a reasonable
construction nnd refused to include
wjthlu its inhibition certain contrac
tual restraints of trade which It de
nominated iih Incidental or us Indirect,
fl'hese eases of restnmt of trade that
the court excepted from the operation
of the stntuto wore Instance. which
at common law would have been call
ed reasonable. In tho Standard Oil
and tobacco casus, therefore, the court
merely adopted the Jests of tjie com
mon law and in defining exceptions to
the literal application of the stntuto
only substituted for tlie test of being
Incidental or Indirect that ol being
reasonable, mid this without varying
lu the slightest tho actual scope nud
effect of tlii statute. In other words,
all tho cases under tho statute which
have now been decided would have
been decided tlie same way If the
court had originally accepted In its
construction tin rule at common law.
-it has been said that the court by In
troducing Into the construction of the
ilntuto common luw distinctions has
ffinsoululod It. This Is obviously un
i up. Hy Its Judgment every contract
uud comblniUluu in restraint of inter
state trade made with the purpose or
necessary effect of controlling price
by stllllnif coinpelltlou or of establish
ing In whole or In part u monopoly of
such trade is condemned by the stnt
ijte. The most extreme critics cannot
Instance u case that ought to bo con
demned under the stntuto wblcdi ia not
brought within lu terms ns thus con-
,-Tlu) suggestion Is also made tliat the
mi promo court by its decision in tho
last two cases has committed to the
court the undefined and unlimited dis
cretion to determine whether a case of
restraint of trado Is within the terms
j of thp statute. Tills Is wholly untrue.
A reasonable restraint of trade nt com
mon law Is well understood and Is
clearly ilcfltiiHl. It docs not rest In the
discretion of tiio court. It must bo
limited to accomplish tlio purpose of n
lawful main contract to which In order
that It shall bo enforceable nt nil It
must ho Incidental. If It exceed tho
Leeds of that contract It Is void.
Tho test of reasonableness was never
applied by the court nt eommnn law
to contracts or combinations or con-
Fpiraclea in restraint of trade whose f
punose was or whoso uecossary effect
would be to stltlc cometltlon. to con
trol prices or establish monopolies.
Fay that such contracts or com)iiu-j
tlons or conspiracies might be lawful
If the lmrtles to them were onl.v mod
crate Hi tno uso or tne power tuus se
cured and did not etact from the pub
lie too groat nnd exorbitant prices, It
is
s true that many theorlts and others
j engaged in business violating the stat
utc have hoped that some sikh Hue
could be drawu by courts, but no court
of authority has ever attempted it
Certainly there Is nothing in the divi
sions of the latest two cases from
which such a dangerous theory of Ju
diclal discretion in enforcing this stat
ute cau derive the slightest sanction.
Force and Effectiveness of Statute a
Matter of Growth.
We have been twenty-one years mak
ing this statute effective for the pur
poses for which It was enaetod. The
Knight cn-e was discouraging and
seemed to remit to the states the whole
available power to attack and suppress
the evils of the trusts. Slowly, howev
er, the error of that Judgmeut was cor
rected, and only in tlie Inst three or
four years has tho heavy hand of the
law been laid upon the great Illegal
combinations that have exercised such
an absolute dominion over Inany of our
industries. Criminal prosecutions have
been brought, aud a number are pend
ing, but Juries have felt averse to con
victing for Jail sentences and Judges
have been most reluctant to Impose
such sentences on men of resjiectnble
htandlng In society whose offence has
been regarded as merely statutory.
Still, as the offense becomes better un
derstood and the committing of, it par
takes more of studied aud deliberate
defiance of the law we can be confi
dent that Juries will convict individu
als and that Jail sentences will be Im
posed. The Remedy In Equity by Dissolution.
In the Standard Oil ense the supreme
and circuit courts found the combina
tion to be a monopoly of the interstate
business of refining, transporting-aud
marketing petroleum and Its products,
effected aud maintained through thirty-seven
different corporations, the
stock of which was held by a New Jer
sey company. It In effect commanded
the dissolution of this combination, di
rected the transfer and pro ratn distri
bution by tlie New Jersey company of
tlie stock held by it in the thirty-seven
corporations to nnd among its stock
holders, and the corporations aud indi
vidual defendants were enjoined from
conspiring or combining to restore
such monopoly, nnd all agreements be
tween the subsidiary corporations tend
ing to produce or bring about further
violatloua of the act were enjoined.
In the tobacco case the court found
that the individual defendants, twenty-nine
in number, had been engaged
in a successful effort to ncqulre com
plete dominion over the manufacture,
sale nnd distribution of tobacco in this
country and abroad and that this had
been done by combinations made with
a puriKiso and effect to stifle competi
tion, control prices and establish a
monopoly, not only in the manufacture
of tobacco, but also of tin foil nnd lic
orice used in Its manufacture and of
Its products of cigars, cigarettes and
snuffs. The tobacco suit pnsented a
far moro complicated and difficult case
than the Standard Oil suit for a decree
which would effectuate the will of the
court and eud the violation of the slat
ute. Thoro was here no single hold
ing company, as lu tho case of the
Standard Oil trust. The main company
was the American Tobacco eoinpanj'.
n manufacturing, selling and holding
compauy. Tho plan adopted to de
stroy the combination aud restore com
petition involved the rcdlvlslou of the
capital und plants of the whole trusf
between home of the companies con
stituting the trust nud new coinpanicj
organized for the punses of tho de
crco and made parties to it and num
bering, new and old, fourteen.
Situation After Readjustment.
The American Tobacco company
(old), readjusted capital ?02,0O0.0CO;
the Liggett & Meyers Tobacco company
(new), capital $07,000,000; the P. Loril
lard company (now), capital 17,000,
000. and the It, 3, Reynold Tobacco
company (old), capital $7,r)2.".00O. are
t-lilofly engaged In the manufacture
nnd Bale of chewing and smoking td
bacco nnd cigars. The former one tin
foil company Is divided into two, one
of $823,000 capital and tho other of
5400.000. The one snuff company Is
divided into three companies, one with
a capital of ? 15,000,000. another with a
capital of $8,000,000 nnd a third with
a capital of $8,000,000. The licorice
companies are two. one with a capital
r$3,759,:WO and another avIUi a capi
tal of $'-000.000. There Is also the
ISritlsh-Auierlenn Tobacco company, a
IJritlsJi, corporation, doing business
abroad with u capital of siJ.000.000.
the I'orto Itlcan Tobacco company,
with n capital of $1,800,000. and tho
corporation of United Cigar Stores
with ii capital of $9,000,000.
Under this arrangement each of the
different kinds of business will be dis
tributed between two or niore compa
nies with a division of the prominent
brands iu tlie same tobacco products,
so us to mako competition not ouly
possible, but necessary. Thus the
Hinoklng tobacco business of the coun ,
try is divided so that the present in-

dependent cflmpdnle- lic l!l.:J9 per
cent, while the American Tobacco com
pany will have KU ht cent, the Lig
gett & Meyers SO.UCi per cent, the Irll
lard company -'"2.82 per cent and the
Heynolds company 2.0; ht cent. The
stock of the other thirteen companies,
both preferred and common, bus lievn
taken from the defendant American
Tobacco company and lias Ih-oh dis
tributed nmoifg Its .stockholder. All
covenants restricting competition have
been declared .null anil further (ht
formance of them has ben enjoined.
The preferred stock of the different
companies hni now lioen given voting
lower which was denied It under tlie
old organization. The ratio of the pre
ferred stock to the common was as 7S
to -to. This constitutes a very decided
change in the character of the owner
ship ami control of each company.
In the orlglnnl suit there were twen-ty-niue
defendants, who were charged
with being the conspirators through
ttuom me ii.egwi couiDinauon acquired
uuu i-Aen-isei lis uuiiiwiui ooillliuoil.
Under the decree thee defendants will
hold amounts of stock lu the various
distributee companies ranging from II
per cent ns a maximum to 2S-A per
rent as a minimum, except in tho ease
of ouo small company, the Porto Itlcan
Tobacco company, lu which they will
hoW 4o per cent. The twenty-nine In
dividual defendants are enjoined for
three years from buyiug nny stock ex
cept Trom each other, nnd the group Is
thus prevented from extending Its con
trol during that period. All parties to
the suit and the new companies who
nro made parties are enjoined jwrpet
ually from In nny way effecting nny
combination between any of tho com
panies in violation of the statute by
way of resumption of the old trust.
Each of the fourteen companies Is en
Joined from acquiring jdock In any of
the others. All these compnnles nre
enjoined from having common direc
tors or officers, or common buying or
selling agents, or common olllcea, or
lending money to each other.
8izeof New Companies.
Objection was made by certain in
dependent tobacco compnnles thnt this
settlement was unjust because It left
companies with very large capital in
nctlvo business and thnt the settle
ment thnt would be effective to put all
on nn equality would bo a division of
the capital nnd plant of the trust into
small fractious in amount more near
ly, equal to that of each of the Inde
pendent companies. This contention
results from a iiilsiiiHtcrstandlng of
the anti-trust law and Its purpose. It
is not Intended thereby to prevent the
accumulation of Inrge capital in busi
ness enterprises. In which such n com
bination can secure reduced cost of
production, sale- and distribution. It
is directed against nuelj an aggrega
tion of capital only when its purpose
Is that of stilling competition, enhanc
ing or controlling price nnd establish
ing u monopoly. If wo shall hnvo by
tho decree defeated these purpose
nnd restored competition between tho
largo units Into which the cnpltnl und
plant have been divided we shall have
accompllbhed the useful purpose of
tho statute.
Confiscation Not tho Purpose of the
Statute,
It la not the purpose of the statute
to confiscate the property nnd capital
of the offending trusts. Methods of
punishment by II no or Imprisonment
of the Individual offenders, by lino of
the corporation or by forfeiture of Its
goods In transportation nro provided,
but the proceeding in equity Is a spe
cific remedy to stop the operation of
the trust by injunction and prevent
the future use of tho plant uud capital
in violation of tho statute.
Effectiveness of Decree,
I -venture to say that not In tho his
tory of American law has a decree
moro effective for hucIi a purpose been
entered by a court than that against
the tobacco trust. As f'iietilt Judge
Noyes said lu his Judgment approving
tho decree:
"Tho extent to which It has been
necessary to tear apart this combina
tion and force ln' "'v forms wjtli
the attendant burdens ouffcht to demon
strate that the fedenll antitrust statute
is n drastic wUituto whJoh accomplishes
effective results, which so long as It
stands on the stntuto books must be
obeyed uud which cannot be disobey
ed without iucuirlnir fnrreachliiir iuoi.

Movement For Repeal of tho Anti-
trust Law.
nut now that the anti-trust act is
seen to bo effecthe for tho uccoiiipllsh
ment of the purpose of its enactment
we nro mot by a cry from many differ
ent quarters for Its repeal. It Is said
to be olsdructiw of business progress.
to be nu attempt to rextbro old fash
loned methods of de'structlvu competl
tloti between small units uud to make
impossible thosu useful combinations
of capital und the reduction of the cost
of production tliut are essential to con
tinued prosperity and normal growth.
In the recent decisions tho supremo
court makes clour that there Is noth
ing in tho statute which condemns
combinations of capital or mere big
noss of plant organized to secure econ
omy lu pioducdoii and u reduction of
its cost. It Is only when the purpose
or necessary effe-t of tho organization
nnd innlutctiiuice of the combination
or the uggrogutlon of Immense size nre
the stilling of competition, actual nud
potential, and the enhancing of prkea
and oHtubllshhig a inonjmoly that tho
Btituto Is violated. Mere sl.e Is no
sin against tho law. The merging f
two or more business plants necessari
ly eliminates competition between the
units thus combined, but this elimina
tion is In contravention or the statute
only whon the combination Is made fo,f
purpose of ending thVpartleuhtr com
petition lu order to Hcoiiro control of

The answer to this hypothetical ense
Is that when men attempt to amass

Federal Incorporation Recommended.
In a special niessago to congress on
Jim. 7, 1DI0, I ventured tn point out
tho disturbance to business that would
probably attundthe dissolution of theso
offending trusts. I imlil;
"Hut such an investigation und pon-
hIIiIi. prosecution of corporations whoso
prosperity or destruction affects tho
comfort not only of stockholders, but
of millions of w,ago earners, employees

T(l0 rna.Htloii which I wish In this

Is whether, lu mder to avoid iiuch a

I renew the recommendation of the
enactment of a general law providing
for the voluntary formation of cor
ponitlon to eiigHMc lu trade aud com
mcrco among the slute and with for

clear now than It was then thnt a
purely iiegathe statute like the anti
trust law may well be supplemented
by sieelfic provisions for the building
up and regulation of legitimate nu
tlounl ami foreign commerce.
Government Administrative Experts
Needed to Aid Courts tn Trust
Dissolutions.
The drafting of the decree In the
dissolution of the present 1 1 tints, with
n view to their reorganization Into le
gitimate corporations, has Hindu It es
pecially apparent that the courts nro
not provided with (he administrative
machinery to make the necesiwry In
quiries preparatory to reorganisation
or to pursue mnu Inquiries, nnd they
should bo empowered to Invoke the
aid of thu bureau of corporations In
determining the suitable rcorguuhm
lion of tho disintegrated parts. The
circuit court aud the attorney general
were greatly aided In" framing the de
cree lu the tobacco tryst dissolution by
an expert from the bureau of corpora
tions.
Federal Corporation Commission Pro
posed, I do not set forth lu detail the term
and sections of n statute which might
supply the constructive lobulation per
mitting nud aiding tile Tnriuullon of
combination-! of capital Into federal
corporations. They should lie Mibject
to rigid rnlci as to their organization
and procedure. Including effwllvo pub
I city, and to the closest supervision as
,'j tho Issue of slock and bonds by nu
excculh'o bureau or commission In tho
department of commerce and labor, to
which In times of doubt they might
well submit their proponed plans for
future business. It tnust he distinctly
Understood that Incorporation under n
federal law could not exempt the com
pany thus formed and Its Incorporators
and malingers from prosecution under
the antl-trusjL law for subsequent' Il
legal conduct, but the publicity of Its
procedure nud the opportunity for fre
quent consultation with the bureau or
imuinlfislon In charge of tho lucorisira
