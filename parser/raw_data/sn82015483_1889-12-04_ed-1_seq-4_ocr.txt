THB INDIANS.
- The report of tha secretary of the interior
exhibits tha transactions of the government
with the Indian tribes. Substantial progress
haa been made in the eduoation of children
of sohool age and the allotment of lands to
adult Indiana. It la to be regretted that the
Dollor of breaking the tribal relation and
deallna with Indiana, aa an Individual, did
not appear earlier la our legielation. Large
reservations, held in common, and the main
tenants, of tha authority of tba ohlefs and
head men have deprived the Individual of
every incentive to the sxerolse of thrift, and
the annuity has contributed an affirmative
Impulse toward a atata of conBrmed pauper
ism. Our treaty stipulations should bs ob
served with fidelity end our legislation should
be highly aonsldsrata of tha best interests of
aa Ignorant and helpless people. The reserve,
tlons are now generally surrounded by white
settlements. We oan no longer pusn tne In
dian baok Into tha wilderness, and it remains
only, by every suitable agency, to push him
upward into tha state of a self-supporting
and responsible eltlsen. For the adult, the
first step is to locate him npon a farm, and
for the child, to place him in a sohool. Sohool
attandanoe should be promoted by every
moral agency, and thna failing, shonld bs
compelled. Tha national schools for Indians
have been very successful and ahould be
multiplied, and, as far as possible, should bs
so organized and oondnoted aa to facilitate
the tranafer of tha school to States or teni
lories In which they are located when the In
diana in a neighborhood nave accepted citi
zenship and have become otherwise fitted for
such a tranafer. This condition of things
will be attained slowly, but it win bs hast
ened by keeping It in mind. In the mean
time, that co-operation between the govern
ment and the mission sohools, whloh has
brought much good, shonld be oordlally and
Impartially maintained.
TBB LANS LAWS.
In ths administration of tha land lawr, the
policy of facilitating, in evsry proper way,
ths adjustment of tba honest claims of indi
vidual settlers npon the public lands haa
been pursued. The number of pending
oasts had during tha proceeding administra
tion bean greatly inoressed under the opera
tion of orders for a time suspending aotlon
in a large part of the oasea originating in the
West and northweet, and by tbe subsequent
use of unusual methods of examination.
Only thoae who are familiar with the con
ditions under whloh our agricultural lands
hsvs been settled can appreciate ths serious
and often fatal oonseonenoes to ths settler of
a policy whloh puts his title nndsr suspicion
or delsya the lssnanoe of his patent. While
care ia taken to prevent and expose frand, it
shonld not be imputed without reason. The
manlteet purpose of the homestead and pre
emption lawa was to promote the settlement
of the pabllo domain by persons having a
bona fide intent to mske a home npon tbe
aeleoted lends. Where this intent is well
established and the requirements of the law
have been substantially complied with, the
claimant la entitled to tha prompt and friend
ly consideration of his ease. But wnsre mere
ia reason to believe thst ths olsimsntia ths
mere agent of another who ia aeeklng to
evade a law Intended to promote small hold
logs snd to seoure by f rsudulent metbode large
tracts of timber and other lands, both prin
cipal and agent should not only bs thwarted
In their fraudulent purpose, but snouia be
made to feel the full penalties of oar crimi
nal atatutea. Tha lawa ahould be so admin
istered as not to oonfonnd these two olssses
and to visit penalties only upon ths latter.
The unsettled state of tha titles to large
bodies of lands in the territories of New
Mexico and Arizona has greatly retarded the
development of those territories. Provision
should be made by law for the prompt trial
and final adjustment before ladlcial tribunal
or commission of all olalma based upon Mex
loan grants. It la not just to an Intelligent
and enterprising people thst thslr peace
should bs disturbed and their prosperity re
tarded by these old contentions. I express
the hope that difference of opinion as to
methods may yield to the urgency of the
PENSIONS.
Ths law now provides a pension for evsry
soldier and sailor who wss mustered in ths
service of the United States during tha otvll
war and la now suffering from wounds or
disease having an origin in tha service and In
the line of daty. Two or three nsoeetary
facte, via: muster snd disability, are usually
susceptible of essy proof; but tbe third,
origin in the servloe, is often dlSoult, and in
many deserving oases impossible to estab
lish. That vsry many of those who endured
the hardships of our most bloody and arduoua
campaigns, are now disabled from disease
that had a real, but not traceable origin in
the service, I do not donbt. Besides these
Is aaotbsr olsss sompoeed of men, many of
whom served an enlistment of three full
yeara and of re-enllsted veterana who added
a lonrtn year of ssrvies, who escaped the
aasnaltlea of battle and tha assaults of dis
ease, who were alwaya ready for any detail,
who were in every battle line of their
command and were mustersd out in sound
hsalth, and have, alnoe the close of the war,
while flgting with tbe same indomitable and
been overcome by disease or casualty.
I am not unaware that tba peneion roll al
ready Involves a vsry large annual expendi
ture. Neither am I deterred bv that fact
from recommending that Congress grant a
Jensloa to noh honorably discharged sol
isrs and sailors of tbe eivll war as having
rendered substantial service daring the wsr
era now dspendsnt npon their own labor for
a malatalnanoe, aad by disease or casualty
are incapacitated from earning it. Many of
tba men who wonld be inoluded in thie form
of relief are now dependent upon publio aid
and it does not, in my judgment, consist
with national honor that they shall continue
to subsist anon ths local relief siren indis
criminately to paupers, instead of npon the
special and generous provision of ths nstlon
may served so gallantly and unselfishly. Onr
people will, I am aura, very generally ap
prove snob legielation. And I am eauallv
aura that the aurvivora of tbe Union army
and navy will feel a grateful sense of relief
when this worthy and suffering olsas of their
oomrades la fairly carad for. There are
soma manifest Inequalities ia tha existing law
that snouia be remedied, to some of these
the secretary of tha Interior has called atten
tion.
It is gratifying to be able to state that, try
tbe adoption of nsw and better methods in
tba war department, tba call, of the pension
offloe for information aa to the military and
nospiiai reeorda of pension claimants are
mors promptly secured, and the injurious
and vexatious delays that have heretofore
occurred are entirely avoided. Thla will fa
cilitate greatly tha adjustment of all pend
ing claims.
miUS Of BAEUMAD MX jr. ,
The attention of ' tbe interstate oommeroe
commission baa been called to the urgent
need of oongresslonsl legislation for ths bat-
tar protection for tbellfea and limbs of those
engsged in operating the great Interstate
lines of the country, and especially of tbe
yardmen and brakemen. A petition algned
by nearly ten thousand railway brakemen
was presented to the commission, asking that
eteps might be taken to bring about the use
of automatic brakes and couplers on freight
ears. At a meeting of State railroad oom-
mtsslonsrs nod their ncandltarl VAnresenta-
Uvea, held at Washington in March fast.npon
tha invitation of tha lntaretate commerce
commission, a resolution was unanimously
adopted urging the commission tooooslder
what can be done to prevent th. Ins. of Ufa I
ana lima in coupling and uncoupling freight i
ears and In handling the brakes of sooh cars, f
During lbs year sndiog Jans 80, 1888, over I
2,000 railroad employes were killed in service statement of a few authenticated facts snd
and more than 2,000 Injured. It is compe- some general suggestions u to lerial

shoold be made at once. It is a reproach to
our civilization that any class of American
workmen should, In tbe pursuit of a necessary
and useful vocation, be aubjeoted to a peril
of Ufa and limb as great aa that of a soldier
in time of war.
TBB WOBUJ'S TAIX.
The propoaltlon to observe the fonr hua-
dredth anniversary of the discovery of Amer-
ica by the- opening of a World's fair or
exposition in some one of our great cities will -
be presented for the consideration of Con-
" TBB OTTIL SIBVTCB COMMISSION.
On the 4th of March last tha civil service
commission had but a single member. The
vacancies were filled on the 7th of May and
slaoe then tha eommiaslonera have been ln-
dustriously,thongh with an Inadequate force,
engaged In extending the law. They were
assured by me that a cordial support would
be given them in tha faithful and impartial
enfereement of the statute and of the rules
and regulations adoptsd In aid of It. There
fore the book of ellgiblea hsa been closed to
everyone, except as certifications were made
npon the requisition of j the appointing effi-
xnis secrecy waa tne source or mucn
ausptolon and of many charges of favoritism
in the administration of the law what is
secret is always suspected; what is open oan
be judged. The commission, with the full
approval of all its members, has now opened
tha list of eligibles to the publio. Ths eligi
ble lists for the classified postoffices and cus
tom houses are now publicly posted in tbe
respective offioes, as are also the certificates
for appointments. The purpose of ths civil
service law was absolutely to exolude any
other consideration in connection with ap
pointments under it than that of merit as
tested by tha examination. The business
proceeds upon the theory that both the ex
amining boards fend ths appointing officers
are absolutely ignorant aa to the politioal
viewa and associations of all persons on the
civil service lists. It is not too mush to say,
however, that some recent congressional In
vestigations have somewhat shaken publio
confidence in the Impartiality of the selec
tions for appointment.
The reform of the olvil service will make
no safe or aatlsfaotory advance until the
present laws are well established in the con
fidence of ths people. It will be my pleasure,
as it is dnty, to see that ths law is executed
with firmness and impartiality. If some of
these provisions have been fraudulently
evaded by appointing officers,our resentment
should not suggest repeal of the law, but
reform In its administration. We have one
visw of the matter and hold it with a sincer
ity thst ia not affected by the consideration
that the party to which we belong is for a
time in power.
EDUCATION AND TBB GOVERNMENT.
The interest of the general government in
the education of the people found an early
expression, not only in tha thoughtful and
sometimes warning utterances of our ablest
statesmen, bnt in liberal appropriations
from the common resources for the support
of education in the new States. No one will
deny that it la of the gravest national con
cern that thoae who hold the ultimate con
trol of all pnblio affairs ahould have neoes
sary intelligence wisely to direct and deter
mine them. National aid to education has
heretofore taken the form of land grants,
and in that form tbe constitutions! power of
Congress to promote the ednoatlon of the
people la not seriously questioned. I do net
think it can be susoeesfully questioned. when
the form is changed to that of a direct grant
of money from the publio treasury. Such
aid should be, aa it always haa been, sug
gested by some exceptional conditions. The
audden emancipation of the elaves of the
South, the bestowal of the suffrage which
soon followed, and the impairment of the
ability or tne states where these new citi
zens were chiefly found, to adequately pro-
viae eauoauonai xaoillties. presented not on-
ly exceptional but unexampled conditions.
That the aituation has been muoh amelior
ated there ia no donbt. The ability and
interest of tbe State, have happily increased.
But the great work remain, to be dona, and
I think the general government ahould lend
it. aid. Aa tha suggestion of a national
grant in aid of eduoation grows chiefly out
of the condition and needa of the emanci
pated slave and his descendants, tha relief
shonld, aa far as possible, while necessarily
proceeding upon aome general lines, be ap-
puaa to in. un mat anggeatea it. it is
essential, it much good ia to be accom
plished, tnat tne sympathy and aotive in
terest of the people should be enlisted, and
that the methods adopted ahould be each as
to stimulate and not enDDlant local taxation
of sohool purposes. As one Congress can
not bind a succeeding one in such a case,
and as ths effort must in some degree be
experimental, I recommend that any appro-
S nation mane lor thla purpose be so limited
i annual amount and aa to the time over
whioh it ia to extend, as will, on the one
hand, give the local school antborlties op
portunity to make the best use of the first
yesr's allowance, and on tha other, deliver
them from the temptation to undulv post
pone the assumption of the whole burden
themselves. The colored people did not in
trude themselvsa npon ns; they were brought
here in chains and held in the communities
where they are now chiefly found, bv a crnel
elave code. Happily for both races, they are
now free.
NIOaOES AND TBB BALLOT.
They have, from a standpoint of Ignorance
and poverty, which was our shame, not
theirs, made remarkable advances in educa
tion and in the acquisition of property. They
hsve, as a people, shown themselves to be
friendly and faithful towards tha white rsce
under temptation, of tremendous strength,
They have their representatives in the na
tional oemeteries, where a grateful govern
ment has gathered tha aehea of those who
disd in Its defense. They have furnlshtd to
our regular army regimenta that have won
high praise from thsir commanding officers
for courage and soldierly qualities, and for
fidelity to the enllatment oath. In civil life
they are now the toilere of their communi
tiee, making their full contribution -to the
widening streams of prosperity which these
communities are receiving. Their audden
withdrawal would atop production and bring
disorder into the household as well as the
shop. Generally they do not desire to quit
their homes, and their employers resent the
Interference of the emigration agents who
seek to stimulate such a desire: but, not
withstanding all this, in msny parts of our
country where the colored population is
large, tha people of that race are, by various
devices, deprived of any effective exercise of
thsir political rights aad of many of their
civil right. The wrong does not expend it
self upon those whose votss are suppressed.
Every constituency in the nation la wronged.
It hss been the hope of every patriot that a
sense of justice and of respect for ths law
wonld work a gradual onre of these flagrant
evlla. Surely no one supposee that the pres
ent can be aooepted as a permanent condi
tion. If it is that these communities must
work out this problem for themselves, we
hsve a right to ask whether they are at work
upon it. Do they suggest any solution! Whsn
and under what condition la the black man
to have a free ballot I When is he in fact to
have thoae full civil rights whloh have so
long been bis in lawl Whan is that equali
ty of Influence whloh our form of government
was intended to seoure to the elections to be
restored I This generation should courageous
ly face these grave qusstions and not leave
them aa a heritage of woe to the next. The
consultation ahould proceed with candor,
oalmness and great patlenoe npon tbe lines
of jnslloe and numanlty, not of prejudice and
ornelty.
No question In our country can be at rest
except npon the firm baa. of justice and of
the law. I earnestly invoke tha attention of
Congress to the consideration of such meas
ures within its well defined constitutional
powers as will seoure to all our people a free
exercise of the right of suffrage and every
other civil right under tha constitution and
lawa of tha United States. No evil, however
deplorable, oan juatify the assumptlon.either
on tha part of the executive or of Congress,
of power not granted; bnt both will be high
ly blameable if oil the powers granted are
not wisely bat firmly nsed to correct these
evils. The power to take the whole direction
aod control of the election of members of the
House of Representatives ia olearly given to
tbe general government. A partial and
qualified supervision of these eleotions is now
provided by law, and In my opinion this law
may be so etrsngtbened and extended as to
seonre, on the whole, better results than oan
be attained by a law taking all the process
of suoh election Into federal control. The
colored man should be protected in all of his
relations to tbe federal government., whether
litigant, juror or witness in onr oourts, aa an
alsctor for members to Congress or aa a
peaoef ul traveler npon onr inter-State rail
ways. A NATIONAL BISQBACB. .
There is nothiug more justly humiliating
to the national pride, and nothing more hurt
ful to national prosperity, then the Inferiority
of our merchant marixe compared with that
of other nations whose general resources,
wealth and seacoaat lines do not suggest any
reason for their supremacy on the sea. It was
not always so; and our people are agreed, I
thlnlr that It shall not contlnna to ba so. It
la not mv purpose in this communication to
discus, the cause, or tne decay or our
ship-
ping Interests, or tbe different methods by ',
whloh it irproposed to restprs then. Ths
one form or another, Is gsnerally known.
That the American lines of steamship, have
been abandoned by us to an unequal contest
with the aidsd lines of other nations, until
they have been withdrawn, or, in the fsw
where thev are still maintained, are
subject to serious disadvantages, is matter of
: common knowledge. The present situation
is suoh that travelers and : merohan
find Liverpool often a . neo-
canary intermediate port between New York
and some oi mo doucu ahikimu Hwiaia
Tha fact that some of the delegates from
South American States to the conference of
American nations, now in session at Wash
ington, reached onr shores by reversing that
line of travel, is very ooaolueire of the nsed
of such a conference, and very auggeative as
to the first and moat nacesaary otep In the
direction of fuller and mora benafioial inter
course with nations that are onr neighbors
npon the lines of latitude, bnt not npon the
linea of established commercial intercourse.
TBB SUBSIDY QUBSTIOH.
I recommended that auoh appropriations
be made for ocean mall servloe in American
steamships between onr ports and those of
Central and South America, China and Ja
pan, and the important Islands in both of
tha great oceans, as will be liberally remun
erative for the servloe rendered, and as will
encourage the establishment and ia some fair
degree equalize tha chances ef American
steamship lines in the competitionwhioh they
must meet. Thst Amerioanj.States lying
south of us will cordially co-operate in estab
lishing and maintaining suoh lines of steam
ahipa to their principal ports I do not doubt.
We should also make provisions for a naval
reserve, to consist -of suoh merchant ships of
American construction and of a specified ton
nage and speed as the owners will consent to
plaoe at the use of the government in case of
need as armed cruisers." England has adopted
this policy, and as a result can now, upon
necessity, at once plaoe npon her naval list
some of the fastest steamships in tne werld.
A proper snpervision of the construction of
such vessels would make thsir conversion to
effective ships of war very easy. I am an ad
vocate of economy in our national expendi
tures; but it is a misuse of terms to make this
word describe a policy that withholds an ex
penditure for the purpose of extending our
foreign commerce; the enlargement and Im
provement of our merchant marine; tbe de
velopment of a sufficient body of trained
American seamen, tha promotion of rapid
and regular mail communications bstween
the ports of other countries and our own.and
the adoption of large and swift Americsn
merchant steamships to naval uses in time of
war, are publio purposes of the highest con
cern. The enlarged participation of our peo
ple in the carrying trade, tha new and in
creased markets that will open for the pro
ducts of our farms and factories, and the
fuller and better-employment of mechanics,
whloh will result from liberal promotion of
our foreign commission insure the wideet
possible diffusion of benefit to all the States
and to all our people. Everything is most
propitious for the present inauguration of a
liberal and progressive rralicy upon this sub
jeot, and we should enter upon it with

The legislation which I have suggested, as
it is sincerely believed, will promote thai

same great end in view.

ENGLISH FIRES.
A Prejudice Against Pip...
London Letter to the Argonaut.
The worst of these changes is that English
people chatter and shiver, and sneeze and
blow their noses, in a determined sort of
wsy, as if there was no remedy tor it all.
"why don't you have a fire, ' said I, one
day, to a lady who was sitting with blue
knuckles in a drawing room that felt like
refrigerator.
"Wbatf" she cried, "a nre In September!
I never heard of suoh a thing. Fancy one's
coal bill!"
"Bat," said I, "what if September is
cold as December!''
"Oh. I never begin fires till, at the varv
lesst, "ths end of Oetober," she answered;
"not till November, II 1 can possibly help
it."
"It is not a question of dates," said I,
"but one of temperature. I abonld think."
"I wouldn't break through my rule for the
world," she replied; "my mother always fol
lowed it, ana so shall I," and she looked over
my head with the grand air of tbe regulation
Primrose Dame. "Fanoya fire in Septem
ber. I never heard of such a thing."
And so it Is, I think you will Had. with
most English people. They prefer to shake
and quiver with oold sooner than "begin
fires" before the regulsr date for them.
Even then tbe nres do not do muoh good.
As a general thing I do not suppose there
are worse warmed houses in the world than
English houses, except perhaps the huts of
the Esquimsux. An English fire is not in
tended to warm the house or room In whloh
it bursa. It is only msant to sit at a sort
of spot where you can warm yourself by
drawing your chair up to it, or standing
with your Back to it, whenever, after sitting
out in the room away from it, you have got
chilled through and through.
'It's unaooonntable to me that you don't
have your houses warmed by hot air or hot
water pipes," I heard an Americsn gentle
man once say to the English owner of one
of the finest houses in the southern ooun
tiss, at whioh he was staying On a visit. "It
would save yon extensively in nres."
"I wouldn't have suoh a thing In my
house," replied the Englishman with a snort;
"imagine the stuffy airl And fancy giving
np one's fires! one's cheerful fireplace of a
winter's nightl The blazing logs are one of
winter's greatest charms."
"To look at," ssid the Ameriosn; "not to
feel. An oil portrait of a fire inserted in
the grate would give as muoh heat twelve
feet away from it."
"But who wants to get twelve feet away
from it!" exolalmed the Englishman; "no
one is suoh a fool as that, I should think:
Draw your chair up to it as dose as you like.
That's the way we do in England."
"If there are a dozen people in the room
what are yon going to do! All draw np to
the fire! Take a pretty big fireplace, I
should judge. Yon oan't squeeze in over
fonr in front of any fireplace I've seen, whsn
yon consider the chairs. Going to let the
other eight freeze before yonr face and eyes!"
Tne Englishman looked cornered for a mo
ment. '
"What! Eh! Oh" and a smile lit np
his face as a happy thought oame to his res
cue "first come, first served. That's my
motto."
"Better warm the whole room and give
everybody a ohanoe; that's my motto then.
Why, I never saw anything like it. It's just
aa you aay. Ths first fellow who gets to the
fire men, generally form a ring round it,
if one or two are not already toasting their
baoka at it with their coat tails spread apart.
The other people eannot even see the fire,
muoh less feel it." . -.
"Why don't the other people look alive
and take possession!" asked the Englishman.
"Then the others wonld have to freeze.
If yon had hot pipes all would ba warm, and
there wonld be no scramble to reooh the fir.,
or cursing and awearing by those who got
left."
"Hot pipes!" exolalmed the Englishman
again; "just fancy the black beetles! They'd
be all over the plaoe."
"The roaches are an abomination in Eng
lish houses, that's a fact. They couldn't be
muoh worse than they are, so far as i can
judge. ' I had two on my pillow last night
great, big, long fellows, with feelers like a
lobster and four on the wall over the head
ef the bed, ready to drop gently down as
soon as I blew out the oandle. It waan't hot
pipes that brought them."
"I'm sure I'm very sorry yonr room should
be so uncomfortable," said tbe Englishman,
stiffly, with a subdued huff in his voice. -
"Why, pshaw!" laughed the American, "I
don't mind it. Down in Arizona I've had a
tarantula and a couple of scorpions in my
bed. It Isn't likely I'd be afraid of a roach.
Bat, no Joke, I'm serious about these hot
isrfuWDER

pipes. Try them. Your whole house will
have the same temperature. There will be
no occasion to read the riot act in front of
your fireplaces, and no cellar like halls and
passages to catch cold in when going front
room to room, or up to bed. Look at the
economy of the thing. In your fireplaces
more than half the heat goes np the chim
ney. What a waste! Send this through
pipes all over your house, or have one fire to
heat water, if you like that better."
. "A pretty penny it would cost putting in
the pipes," said the Englishman.
"The saving in coal would pay for it in a
year. Now, let's see," taking out a penoil
and the envelope of a letter, "what's the
price of iron pipe per foot!"
The Englishman, who had about as muoh
knowledge of the price of anything, beyond
horses and guns, as a Hindoo has of Low
Dutch, said, frankly, he didn't know, bnt
added: "I dare say Robinson would know.
I oan write and ask him." Rebinson was
his family solicitor, whose knowledge on all
subjsots, to judge by the diversity of appli
cations to him for advice, was regarded as
unlimited.
"Well, say lead pipe, then!" .
"Can't tell you that, either."
"Hum."- The American scratched his jaw
with the end of the pencil. "How much is
coal a ton!"
"I'll just ring the bell for Hopkins. He
knows, I haven't a doubt. However," stop
ping, with his hand on the bell rope, "it
can't signify, after all, I shouldn't dream of
having them, you know."
"Just as yon say, then," and the Ameri
can put the pencil and paper back in his
pocket with a sigh; "it doesn't matter to
me."
Now, it is a ourious thing that, about
six months after this, the Englishman let
his house for a year and went abroad.
The people who took it had hot air pipes
put into the house at their own expense
and withont the knowledge of the owner.
After their tenancy waa up I was staying
in the neighborhood, and one day went
over to call.
"So yon put them in after all," said I,
noticing a suspicious looking grating in the
wall of the library.
"No, I didn't, I'm ashamed to say," he
replied; "but the people who had the
honse did. I wss awfully angry when I
fonnd It out. But, " (naming the
American gentleman), "was quite right,
and I've been thinking of writing to him
to tell him and sending him an apology
for my rudeness."
"Then you like them?"
"I never knew what comfort was be
fore." Notice to Out of Town Patron..

An Advanced Opening I. Followed By

Prices of tbe Day.
New Yoar, Dec. 4.
Stocks opened with advances extending to seven
eighths per cent, lathe general list, while excep.
tional gains were made among the specialties, Ten
nessee Coal being up 1, Sugar IK, and Jersey Csn-
tral 2. A meterial reaction occurred in the early
dealings notwithstanding the demand for stocks,
and Sugar lost all of Its Improvement. The stocks
of the regular list, however, were well maintained,
and some marked advances were tcored. Pacific
Hall moving; up over one per cent. Louisville and
Nashville, Missouri Paclflo and Atchison were all
quite strong, and at noon the market was fraction
ally better than the opening prices. The usual
daily raid upon the coalers was then made and
there was a material Impression made upon their
prices in a very short time. The raid was accsm-
panled by a rumor that tha Ooxe suit had been de
cided against the Lehigh Valley, .though no con
firmation of the report was had. Iackawan.a and
Beading were pressed for sale la large quantities,
and the decline In the former extended to three
par cent. The Trusts suffered to a lesser extent, but
the looses in them w.re material. Ancther en
deavor to cover the short. In the last hour resulted
in a marked rally, which extended to the entire
list, and Sugar BeOneries was specially prominent
In th. rise, reaching the best figures of the day,
Missouri Pacific at the time was ralher heavy and
lost a portion of the early improvement. The
market finally closed, only fairly active and firmer
to stronger at the beat prices of the day,
Railroad bonds were a shade more active, the
sales sggregatlng 1,703,000.
