DES MOINES. Dec. 15. (Special.) Tho
city of De3 Moines Is confrontel with about
tho hardest proposition ever presented to a
city, and It Is In connection with the ef
forts which have been made tho last three
or four years to havo tho government build
an army post near Des Moines. Tho latest
phase of the caso Is likely to bring the
matter Into city politics next spring In a
manner to cause much bltternesa In tho
campaign. The government has insisted on
the local committee's living up to Its agree
ment to have city water supplied at tho
nrmy post. The water company, which is
now owned by capitalists tn the east, has
refused to lay the mains out Into tho coun
try for the poor chance of selling enough
water to tho government to pay for thu
same. Tho nrmy post committee finally In
duced tho water company to agrco to, put
the mains out on certain conditions and In
accordance with this agreement tho city
council was induced to pass n resolution
which provides that tho city loan tho water
company an amount, not exceeding $50,000;
that the city Is to pay tho water company
tho usual $350 rental per mile for the mains.
It Is prcrosed to take $50,000 now held In
the water fund and use It for this loan nnd
to do this Is will be necessary to secure
permission from tho legislature.
.Mu j or .Htronnly Oppose.
The resolution was got through the coun
cil by a baro majority and now the mayor
has given It out that ho will veto tho reso
lution. He believes tho wholo transaction
Is Illegal; that tho city has no right to take
ninnuy raised for the purpose of buying or
building a waterworks for tho city and
lending It to tho present corporation with
which to do business, and he holds that Die
terms of tho contract, oven If legal, are
decidedly unfair to tho city. Tho desire to
do anything and overythlng to secure tho
army post Is so great that prominent nnd
reputable citizens havo been urging Mayor
Hartonbowcr to sign tho resolution and go
before the legislature to legallzo tho deal,
but bo Is resoluto nnd will not sign. It
begins to look as though this method of pro
viding for the army post extension of the
water mains would fall and tho commlttco
will havo to turn a new trick. Tho mayor
is a democrat, hut elected as an Indepen
dent largely by republican votes. Ho Is
supposed to bo willing to become a candi
date I.i tho spring for re-election, and If bo
this will bring tho wholo waterworks con
troversy Into city politics. If the council
should succeed In passing tho resolution
over tho mayor's veto and go to tho legis
lature this would throw the fight Into tho
legislature.

by a now and comparatively Inexpensive
method, may bo transformed ' Into clear
water, 6ervlceablo for all purposes and
purer than tho water now supplied to al-
nj0Bt tny city in the world. There Is no
limit to tho quantity of pure water tha
may be thus obtained, nnd bacteriologists
ore imanlmouB In asserting that the dls-euse-broedlng
germ life to bo found In this
water after It has been so treated Is too In
significant to bo taken Into consideration.
As a direct result of theso experiments, re
lates a correspondent of the St. Louis
nlobH-Democrat
Now Orlenns will In a
very short while begin tho construction of
ono of tho fine waterworks plants In thu
world, and the system when completed will
bo superior to that of any other city on tho
continent, for the renson that, In addition
to the high quality of water supplied, the
plpo line system, tho mains and laterals,
alono covering nearly 500 miles of streets,
will be based upon tho present and future
requirements of tho city as a whole, every
foot of which will havo been laid after tho
growth uf tho city had been attained. All
other systems aro more or less Irregular be
cause they were started whou the cities
were email, nnd were added to and extended
as the population and settled area In
creased.
An Indirect result of these Investigations,
according to the best Informed engineering
authorities, will be that In Hmo nil the
cities on the banks of Hie MMsslppI wld
nroflt bv them and put In similar nitration
systems, Ther are no patent rights on
which royalties must bo paid, nnd any engi
neer, guided by tho .report of the New Or

which is soon to bo printed, may design ond
put In successful operation a plant capablo
of supplying tho lnrgest city with pure
water at less cost than Is now tho case.
Tho system Involves tho application of

The dangers of an ocean voyage are many
and were It not for tho extraordinary pro
cautions taken by tho steamship componles
they would bo far greater and moro numer
ous. Those who have not traveled on such
vessels know nothing whatever about tho
manner In which passengers ore protected
from peril.
Chief Officer Armstrong of Celtic, which
Is tho largest ship afloat, gives an Inter
esting account of how tho work of watch
ing Is carried on. Each of tho 313
men who compose tho crow hns his special
duty to perform. Tho burden of responsi
bility Is felt keenly by the men on tho stem
head, or foremost point In tho bow of the
ship; In the "crow's nest," on tho bridge
nnd In tho engine room. On tho stem head
In ordinary weather there arc usually two
men. When It U heavy weather, misty or
hazy three men are there. In the "crow's
nest" there nro also two men. These men
nre prnctlcally tho eyes of tho ship. They
are selected with especial care and rccolvo
more pay than ordinary seamen.
Before a man can become n lookout his
eyesight Is rigorously tested both aB to ills
tanco and color. No one may act aB look
out on n ship llko Celtic without first
obtaining n cortlllcnto as to uhyslcol fltnes
from the Board of Trade. Of course thu
main point for sighting objects when out at
sea Is In the "crow's nest," on tho mast
head. The "crow's nest" men must see
things boforo the officer on tho bridge
eights them. If an oftlfcei on deck makes
out an object before tho "crow's nest" man
detects It the latter gets a reprimand.
At night lookout men havo to bo very
much on the alert for spunds. Both the
hearing and seeing of those men nre tested
nnd their eyes and ears must bo well-nigh
perfect. In a fog the safety of the ship de
pends ns much upon the hearing qualities
of tho lookout as upon anything else.
Lookout man on tho stem head have a
telephone close at hand, by means of which
they may communicate with tho officers on
tho bridge. Lookouts havo two hours on
ranged to determine exactly tho cost and
result of the govern! systems of treatment.
Theso tests wero made by men trained In
tno worn or tlio .Massacuusctts staio uoaru
of Health, and thu method nnd duration
were such as to reach conclusive results.
These tibults nro fo hedged about by scien
tific evidence th-it they command tho con
fidence o' all students of water purifica
tion. Tho tests, which cost between $30,000
and 10,000 each, brought out tho limita
tions of all the detlccs experimented with
and also resulted In deflnlto conclusions
as to tho method of treatment which would
successfully purify the local wntors,
Meantime the New Orleans Water Works
company entered Into n contract with n
filter company for a mechanical filter
plant, which, after construction at great
cost, piovcd a failure In every way so fnr
as practicability was concerned. Coagulant
In oxcesslvo nnd costly quantities added to
such waters Just before nitration brings the
fine particles together so that they aro
caught In the filter, bill does not diminish,
rather Increasing, tho amount of solid mat
ter that must be removed from tho filter
bed by hand from slow filters and by wash
ing back with filtered water In mechanical
filters. This was the method under which
tho mechanical filter company attempted to
do tho work at New Orleans. Conditions
whlrh would lead to successful results on
tho river wero found by Investigation to bo:
1. A certain period of plnln subsidence,
which eliminates tho heovler particles.
2. The addition of a coagulant In propor
tion to tho amount of suspended matter still
remaining In the water.
3. A period of auxiliary subsidence, al
lowing tho lnrger aggregates of suspended
matter brought together by the coagulant a
further opportunity to go to tho bottom.
i. Filtration by either tho slow or rapid
system.
When Now Orleans undertook, a year ago.
to Investigate tho purification of Mississippi
wntcr, It was entirely certain to her ad
visers that the task could be successfully
accomplished along tho above IlnoB, and
that, too, within reasonable cost. Cincin
nati and Louisville Investigations had abso
lutely proven that much, Kxtremc condl-
Hons, however, were encountered at New
Orleans, and the exact method that would
prove most successful-first cost of opera-

Hon and excellence of results being all lnv

practicability of the project.
General Supjrlntendenl Karl of the New
Orleans sewerase and water board, and his
colleagues advise! that the experiment bo
made, nnd planned tho same on an elaborate
scale. Thero kwas, accordingly, erected a
complete laboratory and four small but per

There Is no question of tho genuineness

icrles of llnnnclul misfortune tho clock
passeil out of the hands of the French

The clock was presenteil to Mr. Onuldcr

Success of Elaborate Tests

sand layer on slow filters, nnd of the
amount of wash water, etc., on tho rapid
filters. Periods of plain subsidence from
three up to alx days were tried with slow
filtration, unaided by coagulation, but tho
filter operating with water so treated never
gave n perfectly clarified effluent, and from
tho stnrt was practically out of tho race,
though every eftort n mado to bring It
Into succcrfful operation.
System No. 2 operated continuously with
9,000 gallons of water, and was arranged to
glvo forty-clgbt hours to plain subsidence,
to auxiliary subsidence with coagulation,
and then for slow filtrntlon of a rate of
5,000.000 gallons per day. Systems Nos. 3
and four wero arranged to give time of
thirty-six and sixty hours, respectively, of
subsidence, nnd to divide this time between
plnln subsidence and auxiliary subsidence
after coagulation at tho will of the operator
and for filtration. Each yielded continu
ously a perfect clarified and bactorlally sat
isfactory elliucnt. This water was In every
respect as good a water ns many citizens
of New Orleans now buy at fi cents a gal
lon, and at that rate the output of this
small plant would have been worth a
day.
Perfect and entirely satisfactory results
were obtained by giving telvo hours onch
of plain and of nuxlllary subsidence after
coagulation and then rapid filtration
through snnd, after which tho water Is to
pass directly Into the hlgh-llft pumps, which
will send It Into tho city distributing sys
tem or to rcscrvo clear water resorvolrs.
Mr. Robert S. Weston of Boston was res
Idont expert in chargo of tho Investiga
tions. Mr. Fuller of the board of advisory
engineers ling been In close correspondence
with Mr. Weston In regard to this work,
whllo General Superintendent Oeorgo O.
Hnrl of tho sewerage and water board, who
first suggested the necessity of the Inyestl
gatlan, watched (tho progress mado with tho
keenest of attention, for success or falluro
meant, probably, morp to him than to any
other mnn In Now Orleans.
With the notes of theso tests before him
Mr. Earl says that a water purification and
pumping station for Now Orlenns, designed
to purify and deliver Into tho city distribu
tion system 40.000,000 gallons of water a
day, will cost but little more than $1,500,
000. The amount of mud taken from this
water will be something llko 100 cart loads
n day. Tho new water works systom, en
tiro, will cost littlo more than M,000,000.
vhlch Includes oven service pipes to the
property linos of eve 'y building and resl
aenco In the city, and n system of flro
plugs unequalcd anywhere In the world.
Tho cost of maintaining the purification
plant will bn $300,000 per nnnum. Fur
ther, while New- Orleans Is to have, prob
ably, the best water service In tho country
nt romarkably low cost. Mr. Earl proposes,
at on expense of $90,000, through additional
tests and Investigations, to reduce the
operating expenses at least B per cent. Not
least among the many benefits to be derived
by Now Orleans through such a water
supply will be a greatly diminished firo
waste, tho damage to property through the
me of muddy water by the flro department,
now almost equaling that cnused by flro
dlroct. and this will mean lower Insurance
rates,
Tho cost of tho pure water on entering
the mains, not including plpo lino mainte
nance, will be tnly about 0 cents por thou
sand gallon.
