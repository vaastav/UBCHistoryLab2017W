THURSDAY, DEC. 9, 1886.
The bill authorizing two addi
tional judges for Dakota will be
pushed forward at once.
The second session of the Forty
ninth congress convened Tuesday
noon: It is predicted that this will
be a short, uninteresting session.
A fight is being made on the con
firmation of Public Prihter Bene
dict, owing to the fact that he is
not a practical printer, as the law
prescribes. There is no well ground
ed doubt about the justice of this
law, requiring practical men to
manage the great public printing
house at Washington. Experience
usually shows that a man knowing
nothing about the printing business
is better off out of it than in it.
And there is no reason why it
should not hold good when such a
nan goes to work for the govern
ment. A practical, conservative
printer is much better for this place
than a man who is the reverse.
Investigation into the railroad
wreck, near Mitchell, this territory,
last week on the Milwaukee road,
shows that Conductor McCarthy of
the mixed train got his message to
meet the freight at Lennox, but
there being no night operator at
that point the conductor pulled on
as usual and suddenly crushed into
the freight, having forgotten his
message,—killing Engineer Black
wood and his fireman. McCarthy
will be arrested for manslaughter.
And the N. P. accident, east of
Glyndon about the same time, oc
curred by the train dispatcher mak
ing a mistake in sending a dispatch.
It seems the right thing was on his
mind, but that his hand sent some
thing else, hence the accident fol
lowed. Postal Clerk Linnen has
since died—making two deaths in
this wreck, both postal clerks. The
other clerk's name was Tennis.
Various dispatches from Wash
ington and other opinions axpressed
seem to indicate that the contest for
the governorship of Dakota has
taken ground between Hon. H. M.
Day and Judge Church of the Water
town judicial district. A Pioneer
Press reporter interviewed Attorney
Eddy of Watertown at St. Paul the
other day on Dakota matters, and of
course the young man being a mem
ber of the "state" legislature, expa
tiated upon the beauties of that ab
surd "movement," closing as fol
lows, when touching Judgde Church
and the appointment of a governor:
"He has made many friends since be
came to Dakota. Wherever known
he is as well liked as Mr. Day, al
though the latter has the advantage
of a much more extensive acquaint
ance. If Judge Church is appoint
ed, however, the people of the terri
tory will like him. He is but thirty
eight years of age, and will be, if
appointed, the youngest executive
the territory ever had. He was in
the New York legislature at the
time that Cleveland' was governor,
$ and on many important subjects
was Mr. Cleveland's adviser and
spokesman. He is very near to the
If /president. He knew nothing of his
^appointment as a member of the
supreme court of Dakota until he
received notice by telegraph at his
Jhome in New York. He was not a
7k candidate for any office, and the ap
pointment was a surprise to him.
He hesitated at first about accept
ing the place. I do not think he
l^bas now made any request for pro
motion. If appointed governor the
office will come to bim unsolicited."
The Pioneer Press jj£t hold of "a
gentleman" the other day who went
pa.
at a distressing rate about the
y??'grtftt wrong in the laws of Minne
sota, allowing -mutual insurance
companies to be formed and to do
bugin—» in that state, claiming that
there-were sixty of tbes* "plans of
fjmakiag money" ill the statl, and
jH*t tftrpr^sentsession of the legis
iptetnre had a good subject to work
and that it should do its doty
Tiding them ont o* existence.
tfow the truth jp there *te**rrupt
land dishonest men in the insurance
business, but these are not con fined
to the mutual companies. There is
more injustice and thieving prac
ticed by the big corporations in this
business than by the mutuals. It is
a positive face that no big company
has ever attempted to pay, or seemed
to care whether it paid, for in
stance, its hail losses in this section
or not. They catch the farmer on
all sorts of deceptive papers, collect
his premium notes,—and when it
comes to paying a loss—why, "that's
a horse of a different color." And
the truth is that so systematically
have the farmers been swindled and
stolen from by the "stable compa
nies having money to back them,"
the latter have been literally driven
out of this business. It was and is
a matter of necessity that compels
the farmes to unite in trying to
save their losses and the very fact
that sixty companies are doing a
prosperous business in that state
shows that hard-working and in
dustrious people like the system.
It pays them. And this is business.
These big companies talk about all
their assets and other dead loads of
money—rendering them "stable"—
but when a farmer sustains a loss he
might just as well undertake to'
fight the elements as to fight
"stable" insurance company the
stability consists in the corpora
tion's being able to buy itself into
and out of courts and to take ap
peals, so that the poor farmer cannot
think of following them. Yes, it
would be a very fine thing to turn
the insurance business of the coun
try over into the hands of a set of
money sharks and say, "here, men
must insure their property in this
particular scheme or not at all,"—
that would be very fine for the
sharks! Wherever the mutual
plan is managed on ordinary busi
ness principles and integrity, there
is no reason why it may not do a
serviceable business, and benefit
every man connected with it. But
the moment it sets out on the dead
beat plan, such as we here show the
big companies undertake and ac
complish, of course it goes to pieces
for it has not the "stability" to
fight and brow beat its way through,
The mutual plan is all right, but
it must be conducted honorably or
it can't live. And as we say, there
is more honor and service in this
plan than in the ordinory "stable
affair.
Since Senator Edmunds' return
to Washington he has called in a
mutual friend and thus explains
why he does not want an ill feeling
to exist between himself and Mr
Blaine: "I am not inclined at my
age to bold malice toward any man.
I have my family to think of and
the approaching end of my life, and
I do not want to be involved in con
troversy or bitterness with any man.
you may say as much to Mr. Blaine
for me." And when confronted
with the general construction put
upon the recent letter, that he be
lived Mr. Blaine adishonerableman,
the senator replied "I never at any
time said or believed that Mr. Blaine
was intentionally guilty of a dis
honerable act or dishonerable deed."
This language certainly contradicts
the letter. No man could have read
the letter and thought that Mr. Ed
munds had any faith in Mr. Blaine's
manhood, especially since Mr. Ed
munds refused to aid Mr. Blaine in
the last presidential contest. It
looks more than ever like there is
nothing more than jealousy the
matter with Edmunds, and he is
right in coming to the conclusion
that he does not want to carry it too
far. Mr. Blaine was right in snub
bing the old man, even if it was at
a funeral. However, Mr. Blaine
can now afford to treat the old gen
tleman at least, courteously.
The president's message to con
gress, Monday, was a cumbersome
affair, filling ten columns of solid
fine type. And the first thing
of interest is the discussion
of federal taxation, in which the
president puts himself unmistakably
on the side of revenue reform. He
shows that tariff on imports is too
great fyid is unnecessary to the
maintenance of the better features
in American industry. He shows
there is no virtue in hoarding uplarge
sums of money in the U. S. treasu
ry and the continual building of
additional vaults to hold said money
at needless cost to the farmer and
the laborer. He calls attention to
the fact that there is no virtue in a
further upbuilding of a class of al
ready fabulously rich manufacturers
who may now be able to hold their
own and at the same time protect
the manufacturing interests of this
country. At the same time he
urges proper caution in any legisla
tion Rooking to a change in this
revenue matter. In this matter the
president is of coarse correct. The
itext matter of interest is the silver
question, and he seems strong in the
belief that the coinage a/ this mettal
should be swpeended* thinks other
0L
governments are absorbing our gold
and leaving us with the inferior
money. The president again urges
the enlargement of the present la
bor bureau so as to constitutionally
arbitrate on differences arising be
tween labor and capital. And he
sticks to his civil service ideas thus:
It is a fact worthy of note that
every public officer who has a just
idea of his duty to the people testi
fies to the value of this reform. Its
staunchest friends are found among
those who understand it best, and
its warmest supporters are those
who are restrained and protected by
its requirements." This matter of
civil service works very well in the
ory, but in practice it does not and
never will hold out. However, we
think President Cleveland has done
and is doing all that any one could
do under the circumstances to ob
serve the civil service law. But he
might as well denounce it as a re
publican makeshift as to do what he
is doing.
It seems that recently a grain
committee of Chicago paid St. Paul
and Duluth a visit, from whom it
was learned that there is much dif
ference between the inspection of
grain in Illinois and in Minnesota.
In Illinois the grade is established
on the amount of dirt that may be
found in the grain. The grain itself
may be hard and plump, really first
class when cleaned, but this does
not seem to be taken into account.
It is put down No. 3, or rejected, or
no grade. And once in the hands
of the Chicago elevator people, is
cleaned up and goes for what it is
relly worth—the dirt out of it. But
In Minnesota and Dakota, so much
is taken out for dirt—say sixty
bushels out of a car load, and it is
bought from the producer on its
propei grade—or is supposed to be
graded properly and honestly—pro
viding for the cleaning. It may be,
however, that this favorable system
grows out of the fact that here is
produced the hard grain and that
thus are the grain men compelled to
designate hard from common.

St. Paul, Dec. 5. A meeting of
the Passenger association of the
carnival board was held yesterday
morning. A resolution was passed
fixing the following special rates:
The Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul,
Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &
Omaha, Milwaukee & St. Louis, Chi
cago, Burlington & Northern, St.
Paul & Duluth and Minnesota &
Northwestern will sell round trip
tickets for one fair, or at the rate of
1 and 1-2 cents per mile, taking in
all of Minnesota and portions of Da
kota, Iowa & Wisconsin. The St
Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba,
Northern Pacific, Minneapolis &
Pacific will sell round trip tickets
from any point within 150 miles of
St. Paul at one and one fifth fare or
the rate of two and two fifth cents
per mile. For distances over 150
miles round trip tickets will be sold
for one fare. The selling days are
Jan. 15, 16, 18,19, 21, 24,26, and 28,
and tickets are good to return five
days from the date of sale, Twen
ty-five cents additional will be charg
ed for tickets of admission to the
palace grounds.
The Fargo Republican is correct
in this matter: "The legislature
this winter should provide for the
publication of its general acts in the
papers throughout tffe territory.
The laws are for the benefit of the
public, and measures should be taken
to inform the public what they are.
The cost will not be great. Under
the present system it is several
months before printed copies of the
law can be secured, and then at
large cost, whereas if printed in the
newspapers every person in the ter
ritory may secure a copy within a
few days after adjournment of the
legislature by the outlay of a nickel.
If the legislature wishes to accom
modate the public they should pro
vide for the printing of the laws in
the newspapers.''
It is said that the Southeastern
Dakota is the name of a new com
pany organized to build a line of
road which will be to all intents and
purposes a branch of the Northern
Pacific. The list of incorporators
and director is headed by Robert
Harris, President of the Northern
Pacific, Fergus Falls & Black Hills
branch of the Northern Pacific at
Fairview, and run south through
Richland, Roberts, Grant and Cod
ington counties to Watertowp..
Some work from the northern' ter
minus southward will be done this
year, but the exact quantity has^iofr
yet been determined. The lenith
of the new line will be about 100
miles.
