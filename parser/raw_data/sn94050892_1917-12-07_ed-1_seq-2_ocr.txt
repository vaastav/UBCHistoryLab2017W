WILSON'S GREATEST WORD.
President Wilson's 1 last message to con
gress is, beyond doubt, his greatest state pa
per. It is the greatest because it comes at
just the right time with a straight from the
shoulder blow. It is greatest because it will
do more good to the alped cause than any
other one thing short M a victory in the
field. It is greatest because o its effect up
on Germany and the njeutrals. It is greatest
because of its courage and its firmness and its
practical aims. g
He not only asiJ5 ior war upon ausina,
but aS&i. it in such a manner as to maKe Aus
tria tremble. He not only strikes at Germ
any's web of peace propaganda, but he asks
for power to sternly repress the Hun's acti
Tities over here. .
The test of the greatness of this message
.will lie in its effect upon the civilians of all
the nations making war upon Germany. It
will strengthen them and inspire them and
weld them closer together.
The president, in his message, publicly
pledges his word that every human effort pos
sible will be made by this country to beat the
Hun to his knees. That was the word the
country wanted.
And that France and England wanted,
too.
The mistakes and delays and miscalcula
tions and controversies' and inefficiency of
the governmental machinery will be forgiven
if only the nation is assured that the right
spirit is behind it all. If it is these mistakes
will be corrected and lagging feet will be
spurred forward and incompetents relegated
to the rear. The president's message is a light
ed lamp in the house that is overshadowed by
the clouds of war. .
A PRAYER FROM THE FIELD.
God grant that "in the bitter strife
Which all must face who linger here,
Upon the battered Field of Life,
Or with the laurel swinging near
Along the world's red firing line
The battle of the strong and weak
The fateof all the Fates be mine
I will not show, the Yellow Streak.
If fortune play- me false 6r fair
jf from the shadowland I creep
Or up the heights and linger there
Or topple downward to the deep
Or up the rugged path of Fame
When one man fails another mounts
God grant that I play out the game
For there is nothing else that counts.
Grantland Rice.
WHAT THE RED CROSS DOES.
Without slighting its vast peace work,
the Red Cross has collected $85,000,000 of its
$100,000,000 War Fmid. -25,000,000 from New
York alone, and has' appropriated $40,000,000
by spring it will need more money.
The Red Cross is olten accused of being
a trust. To avoid duplication and banish
waste it should be a trust ; it is costing lss
than 1 per cent, to handle its War Fund. a
welcome contrast, to a war bazaar that ost 09
per cent. Often it is aeeusd of martinet
strictness in accepting work or services: and
it should be strict.
The Red Cross is world-wide in outlook.
It works in Russia, Roumania. Serbia, as well
as in Helgium and France. It hurried to the
relief o fthe Italian retreat. It met the sur
vivors of the Antilles at "the pier. It com
mands the services of devoted men and wo
.men, often without salary. It counts upon
no less than $36,300,000 within a year of
value equivalent in work to be done and ser
vices rendered.
The yearly report of these immense ac
tivities is a record of which Americans can
be proud, especially Americans who by work
or money or both have shared in it. The
number who are to share should keep step in
growth with the pitiable, inevitable, im
measurable need.
Who will "adopt" a soldier boy from
Greenlee County? Send him a. Christmas,
greeting. Let him know he is remembered
by the folks at home. The Red Cross Infor
mation Committee will supply you thenani;
and address.
THE PRUSSIAN DANIEL BOONE
When Daniel Hoone was fighting Indians
he simply imagined what he would do if he
were in the enemy's place, and then proceed
ed to foil that move. It worked with wonder
ful success, because Daniel had a good imagi
nation and understood Indians.
Germany continually uses the same meth
ods in dealing with her enemies.' In military
matters it often works, because modern tac
tics are pretty much the same everywhere.
In diplomacy and other matters depending on
national and racial psychology Germany near
ly always fails, because she lacks Daniel
Boone's imagination.
She tries to put herself in the other na
tion's place, and goes wrong because she can't
do it. Her conclusions are purely German.
The other nation doesn't think in the German
way at all, and so figures things out quite
differently.
All of Germany's relations with America
since the war began have served to illustrate
this fact. She has always been logical, but
it has always been Prussian logic. She has
assumed that Americans were guided by the .
same motives as Germans, and could be hand
led in the same way. She still persists in
that delusion, despite the failure of all her
propaganda and diplomacy.
At present the German government is en
gaged in another error of the same sort. The
German people, and Europe m generally, are
being warned against "the American menace."
They are informed that the United States has
entered the war from lust of money and k
power that our object is to reduce Europe to
vassalage, and thereafter dominate and ex
ploit a helpless world.
, Here is Germany once more attributing
her own motives to us. To the Prussian mind
it's as clear as day, because Prussia in our
place would be aiming at that very thing.
Unfortunately for German logic, it "ain't so."
But we almost despair of that fact ever per
colating through Prussi.m skulls.
The Globe miners union is complaining
again to Secretary of Labor Wilson because
the mining companies in the Globe-Miami dis
trict refuse to employ many of the foreigners
yet remaining in that district, who were
among the strikers last summer. The. loyalty
league of the district, it seems, is keeping tab
on-the disloyal trouble makers and comes in
for denunciation for its anxiety. We have been
led to believe that an administrator had been ,
left in the Globe-Miami district by the presi
dent's labor' commission who was to decide
any differences arising bet. ween the miners'
and their employer.
Federal reserve banks are urging the
people of this country to use as many Liberty
bonds as possible during the approaching
holidays for Christmas presents, urging that
the habit of giving money as presents be aban
doned as the government needs the money.
We trust this adviee will be followed and
that those friends of the Copper Era who have
heretofore sent a box of cigars on Christmas
will this year send a Liberty bond.
Can you imagine the feelings of La Fol
lette and Gore when President Wilson deliver
ed his classic war message to congress? The
fact that two United Slates Senators refused
to stand when every other member of the two
houses rose and gave the president an ovation
is unbelievable. Dissenters in congress on
such inn Iters should not be tolerated.
Arizona, it is announced, made a better
showing lhan any other state in the recent Y.
Al. ('. A. war fund drive, scoring 110 per
cent over the amount of her quota. The
average for the nation was only 46 per cent
over the national' quota. The word "only"
is not used in the preceding sentence as term
of reproach but in e.nnlrast with what Ari
zona did.
While the authorities should be verv
toierant of American Socialists, many of whom
do not know why they i.re Socialists, the self
proclaimed UoMieiki in New York ought to
be closely watched. Their great leader in
Petrograd is known to be in the service of the
enemy.
People who always loow for slogans and
must have slogans should give ear to Gen
eral Pershing, commanding the United States
forces in France:
"There is no ground for the heresy that
Germany cannot be beaten. Germany can be
beaten. Germany must be beaten. Germany
will be beaten."
Propaganda and pacifism say to the con
trary, but the man on the job ought to have
a hearirfg.
With the country at war and industry
strained to the cracking point, there are still
men who get up six-day bicycle "races."
Still, we may as well lake it philosophically.

WHY WE ARE NERVOUS
In perfect health we hardly realize
that we have a network of nerves, but
when strength is declining the same
nervous system gives the alarm in
headaches, tiredness, dreamful sleep,
irritability, and unless corrected, leads
straight to a breakdown.
Scott's Emulsion is exactly what you
should take: its rich nutriment sets
into), the blood and so feeds the tiny
nerve-cells while the whole system
tesprtids to its refreshing tonic force.
