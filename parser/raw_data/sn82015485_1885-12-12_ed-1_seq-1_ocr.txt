There seems to the Courier to -he

That paper thinks tho combination of
farmers to stop promiscuous shooting and

do in preventing tho wholesale slaughter
of quails and paririe chickens.
It is claimed that those in au
thority declare that tho U. P. railway
company will, at an early date, build a
branch line from Oakley, St. John county,
to Colby, Thomas county. The Oakley
Opinion roports surveyors at work on tho
proposed line, and expresses tho belief
that Colby will hear the snort of the iron
horse this side of June.
Frank Douglass and wife live at
"Wacosta, Mich. The Beloit Couiier
learns from Prank's brother, 'Gene, of
Solomon Rapids, Mitchell county, this
state, that Prank's infant was poisoned a
short time ago by being gien a dose of
"Rough on Rats" by a servant girl. Peo
ple can hardly begin to Uncareful enough
in guarding against tho danger of having
preparations used out of tho wrong bottle.
Lee, of the Lane County Herald
is getting mixed up with the railway cor
porations. We rather regret to see this.
When he was poor like the rest of us he
was a capital good fellow, but palace-car
riding is apt to pnff people 'way up. That
paper says: "A privato letter from the
vico president of this (tho Wichita and
Colorado) road to tho proprietor of the
Herald states that tho road will bo built
through Lane county and on west to Col
orado." Our friend, Captain Charlesworth,
of Beloit, is at home on a leave of absence.
The Courier of last week has this to say
of him: "Capfc. Charlesworth's lecture,
descriptivo of the Maderia Island and
Punchal, its capital, at tho rink, on
Wednesday night of last week, was well
received by a fair audience. His resi
dence there as consul gave him excellent
opportunity to study tho character of its
people, and he portrays their customs
very lucidly
There is talk of A. a. McBride
taking another move. Tho report is that
' he will go this tim3 from Kirwin to Ober
lin for the purpose of starting a new pa
per. Mc's orbit in journalism is eccen
tric, but his brilliancy makes him -worth
looking after anyway. His brother, W.
H., the esteemed representative in tho
legislature from Phillips county, seems to
have an interest in the plant. It is un
known, however, at these headquarters
whether he will go to Oberlin.
It is reported as one of the cur
rent facts that tho Democrats are going
to force tho attention of congress to the
Ktz John Porter case this winter. It is
more than passing strange that a body
which elects Stalwart John Sherman its
president by a decided majority contains
a sufficient number of admirers of this
traitor Porter to vote for his restoration
to rank in the army. Thanks to the loy
alty of the Northern people, General Lo
gan is still on deck to do his duty in this
case as a senator!
TiiEQjaJioM just mounts its high
horse and rides with the fury of a north
ern blast, so to speak, because the Grin
nell Golden Belt declared, or was supposed
to have declared, that uutaken govern
ment claims were plentiful within three
miles of Oakley. The Opinion retorts:
"The truth is, the public domain in a
circle of seven or more miles around
Oakley is taken solidly; not an acre of in
anyway desirable land can be taken by
virtue of the homestead, pre-emption,
tftnbot culture or school-land laws."

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
We appeal to the sense of the
Western Kansas World readers
as to whether we do not fill the bill
in furnishing a complete weekly
journal of news.
Not one Kansas veekly in six
will have the president's message
this week. The World gives it to
you in full, although not a daily
paper in the country published it
before Wednesday. We will drop
the hint that this message, in all its
ponderosity, did not come to us
without our having made arrange
ments looking to the certainty of
its doing so.
Considering the contents of the
message, it is pronounced the lon
gest doaument of the kind which has
been sent out for a dozen years past.
Perhaps, in point of literary quality,
it is an average paper of the kind.
For the present, the World will
merely call attention to the position
of the president on the Chinese
question. Mr. Cleveland, we ven
ture to assert, is sincere. He handles
the question as the vexed problem
that it is. At the same time, we be
lieve that the president takes an
ultra view in favor of the Chinaman.
The writer claims to be informed,
at least fairly, concerning the con
dition of the Chinese in their main
stamping ground, in San Francisco.
In or close to the heart of that
great commercial emporium, the
Chinese have literally stunk the
white people out of several blocks,
and hold the buildings from several
stories down in the ground to the
top. The condition of the Chinese
in these dark cellars beneath cellars
is one of perpetual filth, darkness,
opium smoking, unpunished murder
and other crime. In many of the
rooms there are two reliefs of sleep
ers in the , God-forsaken cots, one
relief rising in the middle of the
night and tramping about from then
till morning, while the other relief
sleeps.
These Chinamen undermine white
labor by driving: it from the field
or compelling the laborers to become
as stinkingly depraved as the China
men themselves. Furthermore,
whatever money the Chinese save is
sent back to China, instead of being
used for the benefit of America. Of
the general truth of these utterances,
the position of the people of the
Pacific coast on the Chinese question
is convincing evidence. The Japan
ese are welcomed in San Francisco
by the whites. Why? They are
scrupulously clean in their habits,
take up American custdms and are
courteous in their deportment. .
Like the president, we deprecate
such massacres of Chinamen as the
recent one at Rock Springs was.
But the state of things of which we
have given a dim outline caused that
massacre. Conservatism in dealing
with this question is to be com
mended; but too much conservatism
persisted in on the part of the gen
eral government will bring about, in
the near future,the speedy destruc
tion of every China man, woman and
child in the Pacific coast states.
Then the attempted seceding' of
those states from .the general gov
ernment will be the natural result
of the interference of the latter.
Business is stagnated in San
Francisco. The whites attribute
this condition to the Chinese.
Thousands of men in that city are
crying for the blood of the Chinese.
On a recent Sunday we do not
know how much oftener they met
on the Sand Lots, and called on the
county coroner, a man who is in
debted largely to this class, to lead
in an attack against the Chinese.
The coroner is an agitator, but he
refused to do this at this time. He
persuaded them to wait. On this
occasion, these thousands of men
were armed.
Congress and the president can
modify the enormity of this wither
ing curse on the Pacific coast. They
have it in thr-ir pnwrr to provide
stock: .lancinsra- tecs jbjlsis of ott:e& ustdttstk-iies-
WArKEEKEY, KANSAS, SATURDAY, DECEMBEtt 12, 1885.
absolutely against the admission
into our ports of any more Chinese
immigration. They have it in their
power to provide for the forcible
emigration of the Chinese in a ratio
exceeding the probable number of
births in this country within their
ranks.

TURNED PHILOSOPHER.
We never knew friend Caldwell,
of the Beloit Courier, to try to act
the philosopher until last week.
His eldest daughter, Miss Oral, had
been riding a donkey a low one
the Saturday before, and the mean
beast ran off with her, and for a
time it was kicking and jumping
and having a tempest of a time,
while the unwilling rider was hang
ing to the saddle horn by her riding
skirt. Strange to say, the lady was
not very seriously injured. Now
hear her father:
We feel thankful to Heaven that her
life was spared, as it was a closer call
than we care to experience again. Shall
we forbid her riding hosseback any more?
No. This sad experience has taught her
the great lesson that every person ought
to understand that the only animal j on
don't have to watch is one that don't
breathe. She will, probably, never again
be.oif guard, and always ready to get out
of danger while enjojing the exhilerating
exercise of horseback riding.
You see Colonel Caldwell has
been made a regent of the State
Normal school, at Emporia; hence,
presumably, his philosophy.
HOMESTEAD CLAIMANTS.
A Washington dispatch of the 7th
inst. mentions the fact that much
apprehension has been manifested
in the West in respect to the scope
of Land Commissioner Sparks's re
cent decision to the effect that home
stead claimants who have previously
had the benefit of the pre-emption
act can not commute their homestead
claim.
Members of congress have re
ceived many letters on the subject
indicating a widespread fear that this
decision was to be made retro-active,
which would have the effect of up
setting the titles to many claims
which had passed, by purchase, in
to the hands of third parties. Sen
ator Van Wyck, of Nebraska, on
behalf of many of his constituents,
recently made inquiry of Gen.
Sparks in regard to the matter, and
was informed that the decision will,
unless reversed by higher authority,
be a guide for the future action of
land officers, but that the commis
sioner is not inclined to go into the
actions of his predecessors nor inter
fere with claims which have already
been secured under former rulings
of the land office in this regard, un
less fraud is shown to have been per
petrated in securing such claim.
NOT THE AGENTS' FAULT.
About nine-tenths of the advertising
agencies seem to have an idea that the
weekly papers in the West are so hard up
for advertising that they will accept any
offer made them. Live Stock Indicator.
What hardens the cheek of these adver
tisers is the fact that a very large num
ber of the'newspapersof the state willing
ly, nay joyfully, accept their advertising
propositions just as they are received. A
cool piece of advertising effrontery is the
proposition "just received from a Florida
chap who proposes, for a fragment of
some shrub, an alleged sample of mistle
toe which he encloses, that we give his
paper a long notice, a puff of Florida in
general, and an advertisement of his
mistletoe business all for this precious
piece of Florida weed Kansas Ag. Col
lege Industrialist.
Both of our esteemed contempo
raries are correct.
We have about as little as the
next one to do with advertising
agents. Nevertheless, we venture,
on this occasion to defend them. A
great many papers will take ads. for
a mere song. The ad. agents know
this. They lenow that if low-price
publishers' space was worth more,
more would be charged. The ad.
agent, therefore, contracts the nat
ural habit of sending low offers to
some worthy papers. When the
publisher tells him .fcKat -the price is
too low, he almo&t invariably raises
it.
Excessive rates for advertising are
not to be encouraged, but the low
rate publisher generally has a very
defective circulation, gets up a poor
literary department, and really
charges too much for his space.
The publisher who offers to do home
advertising for fifty dollais a column
offers to work below living rates.
But he charges too much. His low
estimate of the value of his own
offspring proves this. Hence it is
that the cheapest advertising is the
dearest.
BORIN WRONG.
Congressman Hanback is billed for a
lecture Thanksgiving night at Osborne,
for the benefit of the Moravian church.
We never had supposed that there was
any danger of Hanback dying with early
piety. We begin to fear the worst. Wa
Keexet World.
Strange, isn't it, how great minds run
in the sjime channels! We read the iden
tical words above quoted as an original
paragraph in the Leavenworth Times.
But perhaps the Ttmei stole it from the
World. Oberlin Ey e.
And perhaps, after all, you're
Borin in the wrong direction. We
tell you now that the Leavenworth
Times did steal that item from the
World. It was entirely original
with Tilton's pen. A comparison of
the elate of its appearance in the
World with the time it appeared in
the Times will convince any one of
this, if our word is not good. Now,
if you are not satisfied, we will ap
peal to Col. Anthony for a decision.
It would, we cheerfully confess,
be a low-down thing for us to steal
editorial matter after the frequent be
laborings which Ave have administer
ed to others for doing the same
thing. The bane of the country
press to-day, as a rule, is its lack of
individuality. Oureditorials maybe
able or otherwise. We shall con
tinue to use them in preference to
somebody else's.
DEVILTRY AT DIGHTON.
"Dead or Decamped" is the somewhat-sensational
headline number
one of an article in last week's Lane
County Herald. After the smoke
has been cleared away enough to ad
mit of the eyes growing fairly bright,
the point appears clear that G. G.
Browne, a recent contractor and
builder, banking on a pleasant ad
dress and good looks, swindled va
rious Dighton people out of about
$2,000, and left behind about fifty
dollars' worth of property. Browne
went to Wichita, ostensibly to buy
a bill of furniture; on starting, he
had four or five teams sent to Gar
den City to get his goods. The
goods never came. And, after a
while, the depth of Browne's cun
ning dawned by degreess on the
Dightonians. Foul play is suspect
ed by a limited number a number
composed, perhaps, of the unhappy
creditors, who think they have been
hit hard enough, even if Browne
has shuffled off this mortal coil.
The settlers in the western part
of Thomas county, mews the Tom Cat,
are complaining bitterly of the depreda-i
tions of range cattle which have drifted
in from the northwest. We'll bet a wood
en nutmeg that those are Jim Grea
son's cattlo from Atwood. Wa-Keenet
