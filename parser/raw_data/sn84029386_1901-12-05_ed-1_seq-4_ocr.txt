BUT si President Roosevelt's nmil to
congress:
The president begins his first annual
communication with an official announce
ment o( the death of the late President
McKinley, and a eulogy of till former
chief In which he says:
"It la not too much to ay Uiat at the
time of President McKlnley's death hs
in the moil widely-loved man In all the.
United Statea, while wo have never had
any public man of hie portion who Baa
been ao wholly free from the bitter ani
mosities Incident to public Ufa. His po
lltlcal opponenta were the first to near
the heartiest and most generous tribute
te the broad kindliness of nature, the
sweetness and gentleness of character
which ao endeared him to Ms clone asso
ciate. To a standjrd of lofty Integrity
In public life he united the tender affec
tions and home virtues which are al
Important In Iho mukeup of national
character. A gallant soldier In the great
war for the union, he also shone as an
example to all our people because of his
conduct lu the most sacred and Intimate
f home relations. There could be no
personal hatred of him, for he never act.
d with aught but consideration for the
welfare of others. No one could fall to
respect him who knew him in public or
private life. The defenders of those mur
derous criminals who seek to excuse their
criminality by asserting that It Is exer
cised for political ends Inveigh against
wealth and Irresponsible power. But for
this assassination even this base apology
cannot be urged."
"The ihock, the grief of the country, are
Wtter In the minds of all who saw tho
dirk days while the president yet hover, d
between life and death. At last the light
wis stilled In the kindly eyes, and the
breath went from the lips that even In
aiortal agony uttered no words save of
terglveness to his murderer, of love for
lis friends and sf unfaltering trust In the
trill of the Most High. Such a death
crowning the glory of such a life leaves
us with Infinite sorrow, but with such
ride In what he had accomplished and In
Is own personal character that we (eel
the blow not as struck at him, but as
struck at the nation. We mourn a good
and great president who Is dead, but
while we mourn we are lifted up by the
splendid achievements of hla life and the
rranu neroitm wim whiwm "-
oath."
In the same connection lis makes
strong recommendations aa to how the
nation should deal with anarchy. He
urges that the preaching or teaching of
aaarohy be not permitted, and requests
congress to enaot legislation that will
prevent anarchists from fortilgn countries
landing upon our shores. He would also
e7T..- ll. .rBl Anuria gtvail ilirlsdlfltion
over any man who kills, or attempts to
kill, the president of the country, or any
person who Is In line for succession to
Che presidency. He has no fear, however,
that the country will ever fall Into an
archy. 'The federal courts should be given jur
isdiction over any miin who kills or at
tempts to kill the president or any man
who by the constitution or by Inw Is in
line of succession for the presidency,
while tho punishment for un unaucoesslul
attempt should lie proportioned to thi
enormity of the offense ngnlnst our in
stitutions. , . ,
Anarchy la a crime against the whole
human rare, and nil mankind should bawl
gainst the anarchist. Ills crime should
be made an offense against tho law or
nations, like piracy and that form of man
stealing known as the slavo trade, for It
la of far blacker Infamy than cither. II
should be so declared by treaties umnim
sll civilised powers. Such treaties would
mlvn In Ih r 'ft1"- "'"'"i-nrnant the nnw
?1 acslinl with me crime."
The Trusts.
The president sees cause for congratu
lation tur the nation lu Hie business condi
tions of the present, but sees In the 'tre
mendous and hlshly complex Industrial
envelopment which went un with ever ac
celerated rapidity during the lalter half
sf the nineteenth century" a serious social
Srobkrn for the presint and future, lie
oes not believe tTiat the old laws and old
" customs are suflielenl to regulate the uc-
cumulation and distribution of wealth of
the present time. He does not attribute
the creation of great corporate fortunes
to the existence of a protective tariff, "nor
to any other governmental action, but to
natural causes in inc dubious munu, un
crating In other countries as they operaf
In our own." In this connection he says:
"The process has aroused much antago
Blsm, a great port of which Is wholly
without warrant. It Is nut true thst ss
the rich have grown richer the poor have
crown poorer. On the contrary, never be
fore has the average man, the wage
worker, the farmer, the small trader,
been 10 well off aa In this country and
at the present time, There have been
Abuses ennntcted with the accumulation
of wealth, yet II remains true that a for
tune accumulated 111 legitimate business
can he accumulated by the person spe
cially benefited only on condition of con
ferring Immense Incidental benefits upon
others. Successful enterprise of the type
which benefits all mankind can only ex
ist If the conditions are such aa to offer
great prlies as the rewards of success."
Rut while he realises existing condi
tions, he emphasises the fact that congress
In providing remedies must act with cau
tion, aa the men and corporations "who
. nave t,uut up our commerce and driven
railroads serosa the continent have done
van one
great good to our people, snd without
tnsm tne materiel oeveiopmsni or wnicn
we are ao Justly proud could never have
taken place. Moreover, we ahould recog
nise the Immense importance to this ma
terial development of leaving as unham
pered as Is compatible w'th the public
good ins strong and forceful men upon
whom the success of business operations
Inevitably rests. The slightest study of
buainess conditions will eattsfy anyone
capable of forming a Judgment that the
personal equation la the most Important
factor In a business operation: that the
business ability of the man at the head of
sny business concern, hlg or little. Is usual
ly the factor which fixes the gulf between
trikina success and hopeless failure."
Another reason for caution In trust legis
lation which he gives "Is to be found In the
International commercial conditions of to
day. The same business conditions which
have produced the great aggregations of
corporate snd individual wealth have
made them very potent factors In Inter
national commercial competition. Busi
ness concerns which have the largest
means at their disposal and are managed
by the ablest men are naturally those
which take the lead In the strife for com
mercial supremacy among the nations of
the world. America has only Just begun
to assume that commanding position In
the International business world which
we believe will more and more be ken. It
Is of the utmost Importance that thla po
sition be not jeoparded, especially at a time
when the overflowing abundancs of our
wn natural resources and the skill, busi
ness energy and mechanical aptitude of

ON IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.
iy some win nurrer iaT more man omers,
but, speaking generally, a period of good
timeo means mat an snaie mw . -In
them, and In a period of hard times all
feel the stress to a greater or less degree.
He polnta to the fact that In tin past
'the Ignorant or reckless agitator has
h-.n tha really effective friend of Uie
evils which he has been nominally oppos
ing In dealing wlin nusmess
for the government to undertake by
crude and Ill-considered legislation to do
what may turn out to be bad would be
to Incur the risk of such far-reaching na
tional disaster that It would be prefer
able to undertake nothing at all. The
men who demand the Impossible or the
undesirable serve as the allies of the
forces with which they uro nominally at
war, for they hamper those who would
endeavur to find out In rntlonul fashion
what the wrongs reully are and to what
extent and In what manner It Is prac
ticable to apply remedies."
Remedies for the Trust Evil.
But while he says the above Is true, he
yet sees many evils for which there should
be remedies provided. Of ihese evils the
chief Is over capitalisation "bcau.ie o.

reasonable limits controlled, and in my
Judgment this convlciion Is riant.

of the present Chinese exclusion act, In

another atate, and also that ths govern
ment cease being a party to this oempe tt
Hon by not purchasing goods made either
by convict laoor or that In which women
and children are caused to work excessive
hours or at night.
In ths labor unions of the present he sees
much that Is good, In which connection he
says:
"Very great good hai been and will bs
accomplished by associations or unions
of wageworkers when managed with
forethought and when they combine In
sistence upon their own rights with law
abiding respect for ths rights of others.
The display of these qualities In aucb

There should be a comprehensive law

The Tmvll.
The president docs not desire any change
in the present tariff schedule except where
sucn may oe maae in reciprocity treaties,
and recommends the adoption of reclproc
Kv treaties and the general uollcv of reci
procity as a means of opening the doors of
foreign nations to our commerce, in wnicn
connection he says:
"Kvery application of our tariff policy to
meet our shifting national noeds must be
conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the
duties must never be reduced below the
point that will cover the difference between
the labor cost here and abroad. The well
being of the wugeworker Is a prime consld.

because of natural or of economic causes
we are beyond the reach of successful
competition. . . , .
"I ask the attention of the senate to the
reciprocity treaties Isid before it by my
predecessor."
The Merchant Marine.
The president pronounces our merchant
inarlne "discreditable to us as a nation ant.
Intlgnlncanl to that of other nations which
we overtop In other forms of business,
and says we "should not longer suibmlt to
cuci'ltlons under which only a trilling por
tlon of our great commerce Is carried In
our own ships. Of this he says:
"To remedy this state of things would not
merely serve to build up our shipping In
terest, but It would also result In benent
to all who are Interested In the perma
nent establishment of a wider market for
American products and would provide an
auxiliary force for the ravy. Ships work
for their own ccurtrles just as railroads
work for their terminal points. Shipping
llni if established to the principal coun
tries with which we have drillings, would
be of rolltlcal as well as commercial ben
efit. From evirv standpoint It la unwise
for the 1'nlted State. to continue to rely
upon the ships of competing nations for the
distribution of on; gr-ods. It should be
made advantageous 1" carry American
goods In American built ships."
Ills reeommrnrtatlrr, on this subject Is
only that "our government should take
such action as will remedy these Inequali
ties. The American merchant marine
should be restored lo the ocean."

Under tills he acting ihe president recom
mends such licislaiK.ii as will better safe

"Hut after providing iinalr.st any such

which will brlrg the revenues more nearly

He urges the necessity for strict economy
In expenditures, but that "our national
needs forbid us to be niggardly In the mat
ter of providing whatever Is actually nec
essary to our well-being."
Inter-state Commerce,
He points lo defects In the Interstate
commerce law, and recommends amend
ments to correct them, in which connection
he Bays:
"Those who complain of the management
of Ihe railways allege that established
rates arc not malntalnsd, that re
hales and similar devices are habitually
resorted to, that these preferences are
usuallv In favor of the large shipper, that
they drive out of business the smaller
compotltor, that while many rates are too
low many othera are excessive and that
gross preferences sre made affecting both
localities and commodities. Upon the oth
er hand, the railways assert that the law
by Its very terms tende to produce many
of these Illegal practices by depriving car
rira nf that right of concerted action
1 which they claim Is necessary to estab-
.' ..rf Mtklniuln nnnitlaprlmhitf ting rates.
"The act should be amended The rail
way is a public servant. Its rates should
ha Just to and open to all shippers alike.
The government should aee to It that

should provide ept-tdy, Inexpensive and

shortsighted gretd of a few."
"The forests alone cannot, however, fully
regulate and conserve the waters of the
arid region. Great liorege works are nec

it la a rlchi for the national government i
to make the streams snd rivers of the.
arid region useful by engineering works
for water storage as to maae useim ins ,
rivers and harbors of the humid region by
amolneeHns- wnrks of another kind. The
storing of the floods In reservolra at the
headwatera of our rivers Is but an en
largement of our present policy of river

the lower reaches of the same streams.
"The government should construct and
maintain these reservoirs as It does other
i puollc works. Where their purposs is to
regulate the flow of streams the water
should be turned freely Into the channels
In the dry season to take the same course
under the same laws aB the natural flow.
"The reclamation and settlement of the
arid lands will enrich every portion of
our country, Just as the settlement of the
Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought pros
purity to tho Atlantic statea. The In
creased demand for manufactured arti
cles will stimulate Industrial production,
while wider home markets and the trade
of Asia will consume tne larger iouu sup
plies and effectually prevent western
competition with eastern agriculture. In

He counsels against attempting too much
at lite beginning, but auv.sei, trjit we let
experience on a small plan teach the pos
sibilities of greater-undertakings. He also
cites the conditions under much ihe Bot
tlers of the west are attempting lo build
homes on these arid lands, r.r.d says:
"The security and value of the homes
created depend largely on the stability of
titles to water, but the majority of these
rest on the uncertain foundation of court
decisions rendered In ordinary suits at
law With a few cndltable exceptions,
the arid states have failed lo provide for
the certain and Just division of streams In
times of scarcity. Mx and uncertain laws
have made It possible to edabllsh rights
to water In excess of actual uses or ne
cessities, and many streams have already
passed Into private ownership or a control
equivalent to ownership.
"Whoever controls a stream practically
nnirni ihe land It rendprs productive, and
the doctrine of private ownership of water
apart from lard cannot prevail without
causing enduring wrong. The recognition
of such ownership, which has been per
mitted to grow up In the arid regions,
should give way to a more enlightened and

of water.
The Colonic,
rnnslderahle attention Is given the col
onies, and especially the Philippines. This
section of the message begins by citing
tho needs of Hawaii and Porto illco, of
which he soys:
"In Hawaii our aim must be to develop
the territory on tho traditional American
llnea. We do not wish a region of large
estates tilled by cheap labor. We wish a
healthy American community of men
who themselves till the farms they own.
All our legislation for the Islands should
be shaped with thin end In view. The well
being of the average hemfmaker must
ih. ii-ue test of the healthy devel
opment or tne isianus. t whi
should aa nearly as possible be modeled
on our homestcaa system.
Of Porto Rloo he says the Island Is thrlv
i.b .. navar hefore. and Is bi'lt.B admlnla-
i?.n efficiently and honestly. He deems
no legislation necessary except that con
' .,.. ih. nubile lands of the Island,
,,. ?.u. .ttantlnn to the fact that In
Cuba the Independent government of the
Island' Will Soon oe in tuiii, in
same connection urges strongly the need
of reciprocal trade relations with the new
,inn imnn which subiect he says:
"In the case of Cuba there are weighty
reasons of morality and of national Inter
est why the policy should be held to have
a peculiar application, and I moat earnest
ly ask your attention to the wisdom, Indeed
to the vital need, of providing for a sub
stantial reduction In the tariff duties on
Cuban Imports Into the United Statea.
Cuba has tn her constitution affirmed what
we desired that she should stand In Inter
national maliersjn closer anu niortyrieco.
nnIr and we are bound by every consid
eration of honor and expediency to pass
commercial measures In the Interest of
her material well being.-
For the Philippines he recommends muck
In the way of legislation, but again coun
sels caution that we go neither tco far nor
with too great haste. Hesayl: "We hope
tn make our administration of the islands
honorable to our nation by making It of the
highest benefit lo the Filipinos themselves,
snd as an earnest of what we Intend to do
we point to what we have done.
Already a greater measure of material
prosper'ty and of gfernmental honesty
and efficiency has been attained In the
Philippines than ever before In their his-
nrv "
tslsnders "merely what has elsewhere been
done for tropic peoples by even the best
foreign goven mems. We hope to do for
them what has never before been done for
anv people of the t-oplcs-to make them
fit for self-government efter the fashion ef
the really free nations."
HUr tne loen "i "'y k'"'.,

which he says: "To leave Ihe Islands st
this time wouid mesn thst they would
fall Into a w Iter ol nuiru.-rous anarcny.
Such a desertion of duty on our part
would be a crime against humanity."
Hut he believes sufficient progress haa
been made along the Unit under which wt
have been working In the Islands to wsr
rant us In pissing new legislation, but In
this connection he urges the need of cau
tion He believes ihe lime has come when
the irdustrles of which the Islands ars
capable should he encouraged by granting
franchise for their development, and ol
this hs says:
"Nothing better csn be done for the Is

one of the surest preventives of war. Ot

of the islands that he should go In. It Is

The Navy.
The president urges the continued up
building of the navy as a means of per
forming our International duties as well at
a protection and safeguard for our Inter
national rights. He urge that our place
as a first-class power necessitates ths
hniiriin nnt maintenance of a navy in
keeping with our pla"e among the nations
of the world, and says:
"So far from being In any way a provo
cation to war, an s 'equate and highly
trained navy Is the best guarantee against
war, the cheapest and most effective peace
Insurance. The cost of building and main
taining such a navy represenls the very
lightest premium for Insuring peace which
mio nullnn can nnsslblv Day.'
He recommetus both the construction
of more ships and the addition of more
officers and men aa absolutely necessary,
and says:
"There should be no cessation In the
work ot completing our navy. So far In
genuity haa been wholly unable to devlso
. a..t.,.mtA fnr the great war craft whose
hammering guns benl out the mastery of
the high seas. ' It Is unsafe and unwise
not to iirovlde this ytr for several addi

He- also urges ths enactment of legis .
latlon In connection with the militia and i
national guard forces of the nation that ,
they may bo better fitted for active serv
ice In time of war, and says:
"Our militia law is obsolete and worth
lass. The organisation and armament or .
the national guard of the several states,
which are treated at militia In the ap. ,
proprlatlons by the congrcsa, ahould bo
made Identical with those provided for
the regular forses. The obligations and ,
duties of the guard In time of war should
tie carefully defined and a system estab
lished by law under which tns method of
procedure of raising volunteer forces
ahould be prescribed In advance. It It ut

Of war.'f
He praises the veterans of the civil war,
the war with Spain and those who have
rendered the nation valiant service In tho '
Indian uprisings of the west and In tht
Philippines, and counsels continued lib
erality in the natlon'a dealing with them.
Tho Civil lervlce.
Ha recommenda the enactment of legit
latlon that will place under tht rulings
of the merit system many classes of em
ployes not now governed by It. His rec
ommendation for this is as follows:
"I recommend the passsge or a law
which will extend the classified service to,
the District ot Columbia or will at least
enable the president thus to extend It.
In my Judgment all laws providing for
the temporary employment of olerka
should hereafter contain a provision that
they be selectee, under tne civil service
law."
Ha also wishes the merit system to or
tain In the government service In th
colonies, and says:
"Not an office should be filled In tha
Philippines or Porto Rico with any regard
to the man'a partisan affiliations or serv
ices, with any regard to the political, so
cial orpersonsl influence which he may
have at his command. In short, heed
should bo paid to sbsolutely nothing save
tha man's own character and capacity
and the seeds o( the service,
"The administration of tnese itianaa
should be as wholly fret from the sus
picion of partisan politics aa the administration-
of the army and navy. All that
we ask from the public servant In tho
Philippines or Porto Blco Is that he re
flect honor on his country by the way In
whloh he makes that country's rule a
benefit to the peoples who have come un
der It. This is all that we should ask,
and wa cannot afford to be content with
leas."
Other Recommendations.
Amongother recommendations which tha
president makes are those asking for leg
islation that will Improve the consular serv
ice along lines outlined in bills Introduced
at previous sessions, and he seys that:
"It Is true that the service Is now In the
main efficient, but a standard of excellence
cannot be permanently maintained until
the principles set forth In the bills here
tofore submitted to the congress on thil
subject are enacted Into law."
He believes the time hat arrived whoa
the Indian ahould cease to be treated as a
member of a tribe, but aa an Individual,,
and recommends breaking up the tribal
funds, putting a stop to the Indiscriminate
permission to Indians to lease their allot
ments and stopping the ration system. Ha
recommends also the establishment of art
indUBtrlai educational system, snd sn en
deavor to encourage the Indians to become
cattle raisers rather than agriculturists
where tht Ir lands are unsulted to iTTs latter.
He recommends liberal appropriations for
the Louisiana Purchase exposition and an
appropriation covering expenses Incurred
by the Charleston exposition In removing
government exhibits from the Buffalo ex
position to that at Charleston.
Another of his recommendations Is for
a permsnent census bureau, aa It would In
aure better, cheaper and more satisfactory
work In the Interest of business, statistics,,
economic and social science.
The Postal lervlce.
He calls attention to. the growth of tha
postal system and to ths fsct that the an
nual deficit in this department of the gov
ernment service has been reduced to the
small sum of St.i'djtf. This, he says, could '
further be Increased and possibly a surplus
ahown but for the fact that many publi
cations are now securing the pound rata
as second-class mall matter which are not
entitled to the sume under the law, Ot
this he sny:i:
"The full measure of postal progress
which might be realised has long been
hampered and obstructed by the heavy
burden imposed on the government
through I lie Intrenched and well-understood
ahuf.ns which have grown In con
nection with second-class mall matter. .
The extent of this burcen appears when It.
Is stated I hat, while the second-class mat
ter r.ini.c-1 nearly three-fifths of the weight -of
all the mail, It paid for the last fiscal
year only 14,294,4411 of the aggregate postal
revenue of Jlll.Ml.lss. If the pound rate
of postage, which produces the large Iobs
thus entailed and which was fixed by ths
congress with the purpose of encouraging
the dissemination of public information,
were limited to the legitimate newspapers
and periodicals actually contemplated by
the law, no JiibI exception oould be taken.
That expense would be the recognised and
accepted cost cf a liberal public policy de
liberately adopted for a Justifiable end.
But much of the matter which enjoys the
privileged rate Is wholly outslds of ths
Intent nt the law and has secured sdmls-
ainn nntv through en evaBlon of its re
quirements or through lax construction.
The proportion of such wrongly Included
natter is estimaiea oy posisi esjjwna w
be one-half of the whole volume of aecond
class mall. If It be only one-third or one
nuatte.r. tho, magnitude of the burden la-
now underloken to remove the abuaes so
far as possible by a stricter application
of the Inw, and It ahould be sustained la
