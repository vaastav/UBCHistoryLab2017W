Rebellion Impends in Congress
In Connection With the Pos

RICHMOND'S
THE KICU3IOXD PAIJUADIU3I AND SUX-TELEG R A3I, SUNDAY, DECE3IBER 12, 1909.
CONSERVATIVES WILL
FIGHT FOR A DELAY
Men Who Rank in That Class
Will Join With the Tariff Re
visionists in a Demand for
Some Action.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 11. The
fctandpat leaders in congress are fac
ing an insurrection in connection vnth
tbe proposed postal savings bank leg
islation, which promises to be more
serious than that which developed
against the Aldrich tariff law.
In both senate and house ir.en who
rank as conservatives have joined
wfth the tariff insurgents in demand
ing action. The movement is so
strong that the standpat leaders now
tre fighting only for delay iintil after
the report of the national monetary
reform commission shall be made.
This report will recommend a cen
tral bank and, it is believed, the gen
eral scheme of which that Institution
will be the basis will be so compre
hensive as to demonstrate that postal
savings banks are unnecessary.
Influences for Proposition.
It is not probable, however, these
men will have their way. In his an
nual message President Taft asserted
lie saw no reason why the establish
ment of postal savings banks should
be "tied up" with the general plan of
currency reform. Undoubtedly this Is
the view of a large proportion of the
members of the senate and house. The
Influences working in favor of the pro
position are:
Party politics which justify the de
mand that the pledge in the republi
can platform of last fall be carried
out.
The desire of the president, as ex
pressed in his annual message.
The Importance to the republican
party of uniting the two factions upon
at least one issue of popular interest.
The single force which is working
against the proposed . legislation is
made up almost entirely of the bank
ing interests. It has its agents in
Washington who are conducting a de
termined campaign in favor of delay.
These agents have their spokesmen
in both senate and house and they are
devising various ways along which to
shunt the proposition, and the end of
which is the abyss of inaction.
Subcommittee is Significant.
As an Indication of the methods pur
sued, attention 1b called to the per
sonnel of the subcommittee on post of
fices and post roads, which was ap
pointed today, to consider all bills
with reference to the postal savings
banks.
This subcommittee is made up of
four republicans. Representatives Gar
dner of New Jersey, Huff of Pennsyl
vania, Fassett and Durey of New York
and two democrats, Representatives
Moon of Tennessee and Small of
North Carolina.
It will be noted there is not a mid
dle western or western man on this
committee. It is made up of repre
sentatives of the east and south,
where there is comparatively languid
interest in postal savings banks.
Gardner believes there should be no
postal legislation of this character un
til after the national monetary com
mission has made its report. Huff is
a banker. Fassett is vice president
of the Second National bank of Elmi
ra. New York. Durey is president of a
lumber company and has many capi
talistic connections. The two demo
crats do not count.
Plan to Hold Hearings.
It is proposed, after the post office
appropriation bill is out of the way,
that this subcommittee shall grant
hearings. It is true the subject has
been discussed exhaustively, but it is
insisted there are so many features
connected with the distribution of the
money which would be deposited that
it is necessary to proceed in the pre
paration of such a measure with the
greatest caution and consideration,
after the subcommittee completes its
inquiry it will make a report to the
full committee, and that committee
will determine whether or not to sub
mit a favorable report to the house.
This is the ordinary routine and it
furnishes ample opportunity for delay.
There are many members who have
been friendly to the speaker who as
sert they will not stand for any such
tactics. One of these Is Representa
tive Martin B. Madden of Chicago, who
for years has favored postal savings
banks.
Madden last summer mailed 30,000
letters to his constituents asking them
to express their views upon the postal
savings bank bill which he had intro
duced. He received 11,500 replies, and
only one of these opposed the scheme.
Fortified by this backing Mr. Madden
went to Representative Weeks, chair
man of the committee on post offices
and post roads, and in blunt language
declared he did. not propose to coun
tenance Inaction.
Madden Stirs Up Weeks.
Madden told Weeks that whether or
not he favored the legislation he was
responsible to the house as chairman
of one of its committees and he must
act In accordance with the will of the
majority. .
The Chicagoan pointed out also that
every member of congress must act,

not as he individually believes, but as
his constituents desire. Unless the
committee reported a bill Mr. Madden
announced he would bring the matter
up on the floor of the house and put
every man on record so that his con
stituents might know his attitude.
The way in which this can be done
is through an amendment to the pos
tal appropriation bill. Such an amend
ment would go out on a point of order
on the ground that it was new legisla
tion. But Mr. Madden or any other
member could then move for a roll
call and in this way determine the
fate of the project when it is consider
ed in the house.
There is reason to believe that Mad
den's plain talk made an impression
upon Weeks, who, by the way, is him
self a banker. Weeks asserts he nev
er has discussed postal savings bank
legislation with the speaker. But
when the post office and post roads
committee was organized there is no
doubt Mr. Cannon knew the business
and views of every man he assigned
to it.
The same policy of obstruction and
delay which is to be pursued in the
house will be observed in the senate.
The middle and far western senators
generally intend to support the legisla
tion. Senator Aldrich is against it,
preferring that nothing be done until
after the monetary commission reports.
