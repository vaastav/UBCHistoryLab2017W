KLKIXS ON RATE LEGISLATION
u'' wsu"
Washington, December " 5. Senator
Elkins, chairman of the committee on
inter-state commerce, after reading the
President's message today, made the
foIIow;:ir statement regarding railroad
rate legislation:
"As 1 understand it, the President
does not desire to vest in the commis
sion arbitrary and uncontrolled power
to fix rates. He lias respeatedly stat
ed that the action of. the commission
in fixing a rate should be subject to
review by the courts, and that the rail
way companies should be furnished
legal protection against any injustice.
That being the case, a Jaw giving' to,
tbe commission power to fix rates
should not be drawn in such manner
as to give to the commission purely
legislative discretion in fixing rates.
It should ?:;ve to I he eor.iinission pow
r to ' hangs an existing rate, only if
Hie exsituur rate he unreasonable or
ilU r-ality of ibf rate. In other words,
tt shvul'l only give t'j the committee
power to" reduce a rate io the maxi-
umm that would be reasonable and
lawful if originally Imposed by the
railmad ,,oiv.pai!v. A statute can be
