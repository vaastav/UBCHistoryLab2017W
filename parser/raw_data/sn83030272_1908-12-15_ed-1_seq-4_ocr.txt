of his employment under such other branch
of the Government
Representative Tawney of Minnesota
chairman of the suboommlttoo of tho
House Appropriations Committee reply
ing to questions by Representative Par
eons of Now York said
If this provision prevails the people em
ployed In the Secret Service will have their
services limited to the object for which the
service has been created They will be
permanent and I will say here that the
people employed In that service welcome
this provision because It tends to elevate
and standardize the service and protects
thorn from the unreasonable prejudice that
exists throughout the country acatiut the I
Secret Service of the Treasury Department I
You will eee from the testimony of Mr
Moran himself that he would be very glad
to get rid of the matter of keeping men on
tho rolls for the purpose of supplying re
quests of this kind requests from other de
partments for Secret Serviuo men whether
they deem the service necessary or not
Now If the service actually needs Secret Ser
vice men hereafter this provision dOM not
Interfere with their obtaining them They
will have the same opportunity then that
they have now They have no right and
cannot justify the practice which line ob
tained here for the last few years of main
taining a larger force than Is necessary for
tho Secret ServlceVwork In the Treasury
Department In order to supply men In other
departments when their employment In
other departments Is deemed necessary
Hero Is a direct conflict of statement
between Moran assistant chief of tho
Secret Sonloo Representative Tawney
and tho President the President in his
attack on Congress proclaiming that the
measure which he approved prevents
the promotion of employees in the Secret
Service and this further discourages
good effort Speaking further of the
measure which the President approved
and which ho now uses for the basis of his
attack on Congress tho President in his
message said
It b not too much to Bay that this
amendment has been of benefit only to the
original classes If deliberately intro
duced for the purpose of diminishing the
effectiveness of war against crime It
could not havo been bettor devised to this
ond Yet Representative Tawney de
elated on the floor of tho House on May 1
that Moran was in full sympathy with the
amendment which Congress passed and
which President Roosevelt approved when
he signed tho sundry civil act As folks
begin to understand this affair they are
also beginning to grin at tho President
Tho dobato In tho House over the Secret
Service amendment continuing on May t
dovoloped that 215 was expended for
secret service work done in the Navy De
partment and it was on this testimony
that it was admitted that the Secret
Service mon wore used for other than
official purposes The facts are takon
from the Congrttaional Record Repre
sentative Rennet of Now York having
admitted the expenditure < of 24S the fol
lowing debate ensued
Mr TawneyDoes tho gentleman from
New York know what the nature of that
work was
Mr Bennet Yes
Mr Tawney Does the gentleman ap
prove of It
Mr Bennet Absolutely Av long as the
service Is composed of officers and gen
tlemen and charges against one that would
warrant his dismissal from the service
and when the Secretary of the Navy has
exhausted the ordinary sources Inside the
Department itself I say It Is the duty of
the Secretary of the Navy to follow up
that cnse and procure the evidence on
which to convict the officer and turn him
out of tha bervlce for the violation of the
law
lawMr
Mr Clark ot MtAoouri would like to
ask tbo gentleman from New York a ques
tion
tionMr
Jlr Bennet t will yield to the gentle
man from Missouri
Mr Clark What are courtsmartial for I
Mr Uennet To act after you get the
evidence That Is what this I24S In spent
forMr
Mr ClarkDoes Ihe gentleman think
the Government ought to he mulcted In
money to go around and hunt up the pri
ate conduct of these fellows
Mr Bcnnet Xot In many cases but I
submit to the gentleman from Missouri
tbat there may occasionally occur ultua
tlona where the Government ought to do
those things
Mr ClarkNow I would like to ask Ihe
gentleman another question solely for In
formation for myself
Mr Bennet Very well
Mr ClarkDoes the gentleman believe
that the Secret Service men ever kept any
body from being shot
Mr Beanet From being shot
Mr Clark Yes any President or any
functionary of the Government
Mr Bennet How do I know
Mr ClarkThey did not prevent the
shooting of Mr MoEJnley
Mr Smith of Jowa There wan a Secret
Service man standing right by the side of
President McKinley when he was shot
was there not
Mr Bennet Yes and yet the President
was shot
Mr Sherley of Kentucky 11 the gentle
man from New York Indicate what kind
or private conduct by an officer of the
Government be considers should be Inves
tigated by the Secret Bervlce and should
It apply to officers of the navy to officers
of the army men in the Departments mem
bers of Congress Senators or what shall
bo the line
Mr Bennet I shall not attempt to answer
soy such blanket question aa tbat
Mr SherleyWell I will make It a little
lea of a blanket Will the gnetleman
Indicate what private conduct of an officer
or employee of the Government should
be Investigated at the Instigation of the
head of any Department of this Government
Mr Bennet None whatever except such
II affect him In his public capacity
Mr SherloyThat Is a atament that does
not mean anything What does the gentle
man consider should be the class of conduct
and who Is to be the judge of whether it
affects him In his public or private capacity
DOM the gentleman think that beads of
Departments should have the right to de
termine and If they so determine tbat the
private conduct of the Individual affects
him in his public capacity shall they In
vestigate the matter with Secret Service
men
Mr Rennet I think this nary case the
history of which some gentlemen here are
familiar with

maintain that In a croai5j SteTe

Mr Shirley Then whenever a charge
Is made against any officer on leave or not
on leave that he baa been guilty of conduct
unbecoming a gentleman and an officer
the Secretary of the Nary is wananted in
employing the Secret Service men ahadow
that man In order to prove whether those
charges are well founded or note
Mr DennetNot at all and I do not
so state
Mr SherleyThen let UI fled out the
gentlemans point
Mr Bonnet I stated that the Secretary
of the Navy desired to locate the boer
and tbat be was unable through the officer
of tho Navy Department and through the
regular channels
Mr Sherley Tbo man wa on leave
Mr JennetYes
Mr Sherley He had a right to be away I
Mr Bennet On leave and he was charged
with a serious and moat grate crime
Mr Bherlor But let us not confute
the issues
Mr BonnetThat la a part of the Issue
Mr Herley The man was on leave
Mr BonnetYI
Mr Sherley And the gentleman thinks
the Secretary of the Navy was warranted
putting a Secret Service man on that mans
trail S
Mr Itennet think he was not only
Justified but that It Is hla duty an officer
of the navy tslns charged with crime
whether on leave or on duty to send for
that officer to start Investigations to
courtmartial him and If he wai guilty to
separate him from the service
Mr SherUy That docs not necessarily
Involve nod heretofore baa not Involved the
use of a Secret Service man
Mr BennetIt may not be necessary
but It did In this caae Involve It and It has In
other cases involved It and I thick that
when these rare oases arise
Mr Sherley Does the gentleman think
that If the accusation was made against a
member of Congress that he had been guilty
of conduct unbecoming gentleman and a
member of Congress tbat a department
would be warranted In Investigating his
conduct by a Secret Service man
Mr Bennet The gontlenam Is of very
high erudition and he knows of course
Mr Bberlejr Well let us dispense with
the compliments and get down to the case
Mr Bennet Very well now I will give
the gemtleman some facts
Mr Bherley am prepared to admit
that anything that adduces a fecffrom the
gentleman Is warranted
Mr Bennet Very well lie known as
we all know who are lawyers and have
given any thought to be subject that wo
are not Federal officers that we are not
State officers that we are a component
part of the Government There Is nobody
over uIWe are the Congress cf the United
States and the judges ot our own conduct
Mr Sherley The gentleman may be
aware of the fact tbat this Secret Service
at one time was used for the purpose of
looking Into the personal conduct ot a mem
ber of Congroe notwithstanding the gentle
man seems to think that they are answerable
to no one f
Mr Bennet The gentleman Is not aware
or anything of that kind As far as the
gentleman has Inretttgated It ban been
denied
Mr Sherley But bat vu the tact
Mr BonnetThe allegation was made
If tbo gentleman will permit that that
particular Investigation WI18 made not by a
member of tho Secret Service but 6y a
police officer of the city of Washington
wbo when It was ascertained that he bad
done tbat was summarily dismissed rot
the police force The gentleman from New
York has heard that
Further on Mr Sborley spooking of
the tracking of tho naval officer by the
Secret Service men said
nut the location of he man watinot a
question with the Department to knew
where that man was while on leafi but
the location of the man by the Secret Ser
vice was really for the purpose of making
charges against him in connection with
some scandalous conduct of his NOw
I deny that it Is the business of the Secre
tary of the Navy or the Secretary of War
or any other Secretary to emplo Secret
Service men to dig UjJ the private scandals
of men
I do not mean to uphold the scandals
but 1 do not believe this country has leached
a point where it needs that sort of super
vision oe mens conduct by Government
and by Secret Service methods That
is the reason I am opposed toiL lot the
Department come out openly They have
been evading the plain spirit of the law
and they know it There Is not a man wbo
can justify what has been don iti the face
of that statute The statute expressly
says these men shall b used for certain
enumerated purposes and for lone other
Now they could not avoid the meaning
of that statute and s they try to circum
scribe It by detailing by dropping men
from the rolls temporarily in order that
they roiybe picked up by other Departments
ments and they frankly confess that they
keep on their rolls 1 greater number than
the needs of their service require In order
lerce rsqur orer
that they may he able to detail those men
to other Departments It Is treating
Conll and its laws with absolute con
tempt and I desire to voice my protest
against this attempt of the Department
to determine what Is necessary and legal
rather than to let the lawmaking part
or the Government make that determina
tion 1 hop limitation will prevail
The amendment recommended by a
Republican appropriations committee was
passed by a Republican Congress and
approved by President Roosevelt and
yet in his recent message h declared
that this amendmentwaa Intended a a
benefit only to the criminal classes
would prevent promotions in the Secret
Service would diminish effectiveness In
tho service and that the chief argu
ment in favor of the provision was that
Congressmen did not themselves wish
to be Investigated by Secret Service men
In view of the Presidents chance of
attitude toward the measure which he
himself approvod lost spring the com
ment is heard here once it policeman

PRIDENT NOT YET REBUKED
BOVS EVIDENTLY WAITiNG TO
BEAR FROM THE SENATE
It Select Committee Held a Meeting
Yesterday but No Agreement Was
Reached as to What BhunJd Be Done
Denial Tat the Howe Will Yield
WASHINGTON Dec 14 Congress ap
parently intends to move with great de
liberation in rebuking President Roose
velt for his insinuations contained in
tht par of his recent message deal
ing with the activities of the United
States Secret Service Up to date there
have been no developments in the Senate
and the House committee appointed to
draw up a roeolution rebuking the President
dent evidently is waiting for something
to happen in the upper branch I
Today tho House committee hold a
meeting which lasted for several hours
Full consideration was given all tiro data
bearing on the subject While the com
mlttco considered tho situation from
every anglo it Is understood that no
agreement was reached aa to Just whAt
should be done Later Chairman Perkins
visited the Senate chamber and had
vet Bte cmber h con
ferences with leaders in that body E
phatlo denial is given by members to
gven
reports that have been put in circulation
that the House ia getting cold foot
and that chagrin is now expressed that
cognizance was taken of tho Presidents
reference t Congress and the Secret
Service Another mooting of the select
committee will b held tomorrow By
that time it is hoped that some word on
the subject will have been received from
tho Senate
Just what the Senate will do or whether
It will do anything at a has not boon
determined This doll not mean that
the temper of the Senate aroused when
Its attention was first directed to tho
Presidents referenco lo Goneness and
the Secret Service b < if any
degree but is due to clrcumstdnoca that
have developed since that time Friends
of tim President have been saying to
Senators and perhaps they said the Im
thing that the Senate had no quarrel
with the President In connection with I
his Secret Service strictures as ho did
not intend to reflect in any way upon
tao Senate To back up assertions of this
character It is being pointed out to Sen
ators that th provision I the Sundry
Civil Appropratio bill of this year cur
tailing the operations of the Secret Ser
vice and which was the basis for the
Presidents Intimations that Congressmen
were afraid of being Investigated was
rejected by tho Senate when the bill come
from the House It was reinserted in the
bill afterward however by the Senate
and Hqusa conferees and remained In
the mesure when it became a law
To what extent Republican Senators
have been imprrsaod by these represen
tations of Mr Roosevelts unwillingness
to have the language used In lila message
us3
construed as 1 reflection on the Senate
has not appeared but It is not going be I
yond the fact to say that thdy regard b
Fresldqnto utterance concerning Con
grcsaman whether or not It was aimed
at Senators a unjust and indiscreet
The disposition of some of the Senate
loaders is to have tho Senate adopt rose
luUons providing for the appointment
of a special committee to investigate the
reflections cast upon the Congress by
tho President Conferences by those
leaders today resulted In I requgs
reute
by them to Senator Burrows of Michigan
to present such a resolution Senator
Burrows was exceedingly unwilling to
take this step and at last aunt the
action to be tae the Senate had not
been determined
One phase of the agitation in the Senate
over the Presidents criticism Is a source
of some amusement to Republican memo
bets According the story told some
of tho Democratic leaders In the Senate
among them Senator Culberson who
is the official representative of tho minority
dde on the floor went to the Kepublican
leaders and served notice on them tbat
unless the Republicans brought in
an appropriate resolution to got back
at the President the Democrats would
do something themselves whereupon
the Republican leaders told their Demo
crat o brethren that this would be a first
rate disposition of the matter nnd would
remove it entirely from a partisan aspect
because the resolution of investigation
was Intuc In the House by u Re
publican and it would b very appro
priate and nonpartisan to hare a similar
resolution Introduced in the Senate
by a Democrat But the Democratic
leaders were not so insistent on carrying
out this virtual throaty they had made
to the Republicans after the Republicans
showed such a willingness to have their
political opponents go ahead
