-FRIDAY. DECEMBER 7. ISGB
Afior life settlement of the slavery ques
tion, the next great problem for the Amer
ican people to grapple will be that of mono
polies. Slavery itself, the greatest of all
monopolies, required a war of four years, no.
paralleled in its fierceness and cost, for its
final adjustment. It has been brought down
at last, and sooner or later, all the lesser
mosinpolics which are drawing the life blood
of the people, will come tumbling in rains
alter it.
In the approaching contact the press will
m ecss.mly exert a great influence, and, as
we believe, a wise and beneficent one. The
patrons of newspapers are tbe great people.
For every dollar thatacorpcratiou, or a class
intaost, can pay to a public journal, the
people can pay ten, and the people Will not
be blow to discriminate between those jour
nals which are for them and those which are
against them. It is proper that the press
should begin the fight by clearing their own
decks, and ridding themselves both of the
burden and the suspicion of monopoly. The
political power of the Union bring west of
the Alleghanies to-day, and growing more
formidable in this section every decade, it is
fitting that the preliminary skirmish should
take place here.
The Western Associated Press have, with
one or two unimportant exceptions, declared
their independence of the arrogant mono
poly known as the New York Associated
Pre.-s. The public are already familiar with
the main points of the controversy. These
points are succinctly aod pointedly statedin
the Mur of Mr. Halstead, of the Cincinnati
( 'until,' n •’</?, in another column, which ire
commend to general perusal.
The tattle in which the Western press are
cnragi d must be fougbl out in tbe face of
the puh-’c, and it would ho false to assume
that the public are not interested iu it.
Whatever concerns public journalism, con
cerns the people in a very intimate degree,
and any movement to emancipate the press
from the evils of monopoly, is a movement,
jxi?r* to emancipate them-
The fooling against monopolies is bo strong
in the West that even those who support the
New York ring strive to brings charge of
iii».nnp,,ly against the Western Press. Mr.
J. K. Serij'ps, of the Detroit Ahcrtincr and
Tribune, is out with a statement charging
that the loading papers of Cincinnati, Chi
cago and St. Louis are trying to get np a
“ring,** to the detriment and disadvantage
of the Journals in the cities of the second
tizc. Upon reading the production of Mr.
Scripps one is led to exclaim : ,
‘•Against stupidity the Gods themselves fight
cnvic.oiiuns.”
Mr. Scripps is a well meaning man. He is
brim full of those good intentions which a
certain place is said to be paved with, and
while bis statements are totally untrue, it is
easy to perceive that he is not inlentioijajly
lying, but is temporarily obfuscated./'lf Mr.
Si-ripp? bad reflected a moment be would
have seen that it is not the interest of tbc
Chicago Tribune to build up all other Chi
cago papers to ihe detriment of Detroit. It
might be our interest to build up all the pa
pers in Detroit to the detriment of all the
papers in Chicago except our own. Our
ikld of chcnlation touches that of the
Detroit papers only at one point,
and that nt a long distance,
while we have the competition of Chicago
papers here and everywhere. r “lt will not be
doubted, even by Mr. Sc’rlpp?, that there
gonrees of the Chicago Tribune arc greater
than those «>f any other Chicago paper. If
there is any thing to be gained by cheating,
certainly there is much more to be gained by
eliciting our neighbors than by picking up
jx-nnies over at Kalamazoo, or Marshall, in
the Slate of Michigan. If we wished to play
a game of grab, we should use our Influence
to have the general Press despatches made
pour and meagre as possible,
so that mure room might be left for
specials, for which we can assuredly spend
more money than any oilier Journal in this
city. But we believe lliat there Is nothing
to be made in the long run by gouging our
contemporaries either in Chicago or Detroit.
Such a policy belongs to narrow minds, and
the suspicion of it likewise belongs to nar
row minds.
Mr. Scripp? proceeds to say :
'The President of the Western Associated Press

held during the present mouth. Both the
Chicago TmnrSE and the Cincinnati Cbm-
?,;■/•(contained articles proposing such a
meeting, before the cal! of the President was
irsued. It was not the business of Messrs,
lighter*! and While to call tbc meeting.
They had no power to do so.
4 It appears that Hr-New York S.t'itc Associa
tion have determined to adhere to the city
monopoly until the expiration of their
j-r- scr.t contract with them, havingsecured
com t e-ions from the latter, which were uu
doi.Medly extorted from them by the firm
attitude of the Western press. The arrange
meats of the Western Press Committee were
■ pruli- aicd upon the idea that the journals
wliirh they represented were strong enough,
to provide for the collection and Iransmis
-9 sionol tlu-ir own news, and that they were
entitled to be the managers of their own af
-1 fairs. To this position they will adhere.
g| The papers of New Orleans. Washington
City and the South generally, together with
a number of influential journal;* in Baltimore
and Philadelphia, and the IPorfJ in New
Fork, have reached' the same con
clusion. The result is that the
“ring” of five morning newspapers in New
i Yori; has been broking the monopoly Is no
longer a monupoljy Whatever it achieves
hereafter it iiiusl gain with its own*monov
in the laceofauactivc competition, of which
the mw.-papere and the public on both sides
will reap lire benefit. The press are out of

blub r«-ad to excellence and prosperity,

CENTRAL REDEMPTION.
We hope Congress will disregard the re
v iimieiuhition of the Treasury Department
o iiiiikc New York a place of central re
ivmption for the notes of all the National
Jat;ks. Every bank, and the principal tner-
entile and manufacturing establishments m
he country now keep money in New York,
9»pmi which they draw for exchange. To re-
I ' uire the National Banks to provide for the
\ ,'demptlon of their circulation In Now York
I • only a scheme to pile up In that city all
B- surplus money of the country, to housed
•r slock gambling operations. The circula-
I on of the National Banks outside of the
* ty of New York is p-Sribly os far removed
am trouble or danger as Is that ol the banks
- that city. We can understand liom vari
eirci m-tances why the New York bank
“rii-g” want this system of central re.
pßnption established. There arc several of
“ c-o \ auks that are now paying as high as
: per cent interest on deposits, and have
* 'aimer? in all parts cf the country hunt-
up depositors. We submit to the
| ous driven to that extremity are
\ safest depositories either of the public
\ eye or of the redemption funds of other
» ks. The exact character of the business
I auks that pay their depositors six per
\ interest, may be more easily imagined
in described; and as long as that business
arried on, prudence would suggest that
banks bad better be left to redeem their
z. ciiculation, than to require them to
ft. < tbclr redemption funds into such hands.
' jere is neither justice nor sound expediency
requiring all the banks Iu the country
keep large deposits in New York,
r and above their commercial needs. Wo
entirely familiar with the airs put on
t by the New York Associated Banks and
New York Associated Press. The for
; would have us believe that there is some
; mvetcry in finance, and that nulcs*
i r can have oor funds in their vaults, the
, .try w ill go to the d rt gs. The latter assure
1 tail there is some profound mystery about
bufincfc* of getting news by telegraph,
' .that unless we give them a monopoly of
gathering, the whole country will be
F red with Egyptian darkness. Both as
' ; lions are deceptive and Impertinent.
' 'New York banks want to draw interest
on tbclr own money and oars too. That u
the: English of it. Wo do not deem it proba
ble, or even possible, that Con-res' nip
sanction any each monopoly.

_ J“ doll are, for the ostensible purpose of
affording the people of the late Southern
v-tates adequate banking capital to accom
modate their business. As this relief can be
extended to them without an addition to the
present volume of hank notes, the public in
terests forbid the proposed expansion The
C r p ““ ? c ‘ng »«■>« of the Ben
cral hostility to an Increase of currency
proposes „ a compromise that Z J'
his proposed addition to bank cCrcdlarionT
But he may rest assnrea mav mm pruim-i
--*Don win meet with no fixvot in the West.
There is a plain, simple, equitable method
of surmounting the seeming difficulty, and
doing justice to the people of the South
without Increasing the bank currency in cir
culation a dollar, and that ss, by Congress
ordering tbe Comptroller to withdraw twen
ty-five millions of circulation from the banka
of those States which have more than their
proper quota and giving it to new banks in
the cx-Statcs of the South which are de
prived of their just proportion of the cur
rency.
The original act oi March 25,1503. pro
vided for an apportionment of the national
currency to the several States and Territo
ries os follows; One hundred and fifty mil
lions, according to representative population,
and one hundred and fifty millions, accord
ing to banking capital, resources and busi
ness.
Surely this gave to the Eastern States all
they were entitled to under any rule of right
or equity. . But they have managed to get
possession of vastly more than the act of
March 25,1803, contemplated. The Comp
troller thus explains how it was done:
“Ibis requirement wag repealed by the act of
June 3,ISW. which left (he distribution to ‘he
discretion of the Comptroller of the Currency. By
he amendment ot March n, 18G5, rht clause re
ijUiri/ij; fl« apjiorilotiintHt to be made was re-en
•:cl<d{ but a* the same date an amendment to
-emon seven of the Internal Revenue act pro
vided that all existing State Batiks should have
the right (o become National Uautu, and should
have the preference over new organizations np to
•be Ist day of Jnly, )565.
* • • • “ihc Comptroller of tbe Cnr
rcncy so construed tbe amendment as to permit
be conversion of State Banks without limitation,
’ibe eilect ol this action was to make a very une
qual dliUibntion of currency, some of tbe States
iccciring more than they were entitled to by that
afipoitjonmeii:, and leaving but a very limited
amount to be awarded to the Southern and some
of tbe Western States."
What right had the Comptroller of the
Currency to so construe the amendment as
to permit the “ State Banks" to grab all the
currency they coveted ? The amendment
contemplated allowing them to do nothing
• f the kiud. The fair and obvious construc
tion of Uie amendment is, that the “Stale
Banks” were to Lave the preference over
“new organizations” in their respective
States, in obtaining tbc quota of circulation
assigned bj the act of March 25, 18G3, to the
several States. For instance, suppose Massa
chusetts was entitled to $23,000,000 of cur
rency on tbc basis of her population and
capital ; and when the act of March
o, 18C5, passed, suppose that $10,000,003
had been delivered to “ new organizations,”
the State banks changing into “Nationals”
would be entitled to the preference—that is
to the remaining $15,000,000 due the State.
But it is a wild and violent construction of
the law that allows those “State banks” of
Massachusetts, after absorbing their own
quota of currency, to fllch from tbc Western
and Southern States a large portion of their
share. But this is exactly the wrong which
the Comptroller of the Currency, with the
consent of the Secretary of the Treasury, has
allowed to be done.
The plain duty of Congress Is to direct
those banks to disgorge what belongs to
oiherscctions of the Union. The currency
is apportioned as follows:

The nine Western States including Mis
souri, containing a population of nine and a
half millions, have received a bank circula
tion of $53,003,900,0f which the State of Ohio
has $18,375,230, and Missouri only $2,712,490.
The fourteen Southern States including
Delaware, West Virginia and Kentucky with
a population of ten and a half millions have
a bank circulation of only $0,C52,325, while
the little State of Rhode Island with less
population than Chicago has managed to get
hold of a circulation of $12,800,350 ! Massa
chusetts with less population than Indiana
has secured the enormous amount of
$58,000,00) of currency, being five millions
more than bus been assigned to the whole
West; and Connecticut with a population
of less than double that of Cook
Comity has ajclrcnlation equal to that of
Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and lowa ali
combined. Pennsylvania is entitled toabout
what currency her banks have got. New
York has sixty-eight millions,and is entitled
to not more* than fifty millions, and New
England should have rather less than half
the sum she bas gobbled. Tbc bounden
duly ol Congress is, to equalize and rc-dis
tribute tbc three hundred millions of cur
rency but not expand it. Forty millions, nt
the very least, should be taken from tbc
avaricious New England and New York
banks, and two-thirds of that sum should be
apportioned to the South, and one-third to
the West; and after this is done the Eastern
states will still possess nearly two-thirds of
the National Bank currency, while they have
) but enc-third the population of the Union.
TIKE MEETING OF THE FORTI
ETH CONGRESS.
We are gratified that the recommendation
rim nioolimr of the For
date, has been received with nnivereal favor,
not only by Congress, but by the c jnntry.
The act making the change must be passed
by the present Congress, aud the precise
time when the next Congress shill assemble,
whether on thcbtli of Marcher the Ist of
May, can best be decided according to cir
cumstances, as they may be developed this
winter.
The evil to be avoided is along recess during
wliicb the President will be left without the
restraining presence of Congress. As the
law stands at present. Congress would not be
iu session from March 3to December 4—a pe
riod of nine mouths. We see that U h pro
posed to convene the Fortieth Congress on
the fifth of March. It may be that it will be
necessary that there should be no interval
between tbc close of one Congress and the
opening ot the nest; bnt to meet in March,
unless Congress remain in session
during the greater port of the summer,
will involve a recess of some length. Con
gress will undoubtedly provide for the estab
lishment of territorial governments in the
icbel Slates, and it would perhaps be as well
for Congress to be in session until these Gov
ernments shall be safely under way. Audrew
Johnson knows already that he holds olliec
by the merciful permission of Congress, but
in dealing with a man like him, prudence
will perhaps suggest that the means of reach
ing him should not be laid aside. Let the
sword hang above his head, and let the baud
be ready at a moment’s notice to cut the
hair by which it is suspended.
ASSOCIATED pki.ss expenses.
“XbeNew York Associated I’rc-'t here was asked
to abandon il* organization, and to surrenders
nufriiuts n>a< had cost many hundreds of thon
-ai.ds of dollars, and which non* costs tbc daily
.\eiv York Journals thousands of dollj-s per

er, who was disxui-ecd I because we could cot trust
him, merely to accommodate certain gentlemen
who pay the merest fracUon of the expense
.hub the new* which costi* the Chicago Tribune
about seventy dollars per week, costs the New
»ork ItibutH more than live hundred; for the
-oven journals in New York composing me A«so
i jatea Press pay as much themselves as the com
i-iEt-d Western pres*.’'—JV»tc ior~ Tribune.
The full sandhedrimof the New York Asso
ciated Press assured the Western Press Com
■ Utee, a few days ago, that the New York
pipers paid tittu-tenihs of the cost of collect
ing the news known as the Associated Press
despatches, and the outside papers, includ
ing ibe East, West, South and Pacific States,
only thru-tenths. The New York Tribune now
informs us that the Western Press paid one
half. This is getting nearer the truth, but
is still a long way from it.
The New York Tribune says that the news
which costs «* seventy dollars per week, cost.-
than five hundred dollars per week. The un
truth In this assertion consists in the sup
pression of the fact that the news heretofore
furnished to the Chicago Tribune and other
Western papers by tbc New York Associa
tion has not been one fifth of the Associated
Press reports received and published by the
New York papers.
The press report from Washington alone
to the New York morning papers during the
sessions of Congress, will average nearly a
page each day—some days two or more pages
—rarely as little as half a page. But of this
long despatch averaging perhaps 10,(WO
words per day, there was sent to tbc Western
press a mangled driblet, or barren *y nopals
of half a column per day. And ibis mi-era.
blc apology for a despatch c -nstiuited
the New York Associated l‘re.-s
report furnished to the Western
press. They kept the cream and
sold the skim milk to the Western papers.
Tbc same practice prevailed In respect of
all other news of importance, obtained by
that Association. Tbc New York papers
would take full reports for themselves, and
send tbc Western press but a mere skeleton.
But in tbc iaec of these notorious facts; the
New York Tribune has the hardihood to say
“ that the new which costs tbo Chicago
Tribune $«0 per week, costs the New York
Tribune $500.”
The leading Western papers were obliged
to open n news nccncp In New York some
v “ 3 , Cllre , nK °,' „ to '“H'lcmcnt Ike New
York Associated Press reports sent to them,
which has furnished them 1,500 to 2 000
words per day, of extra report, at a cost of
.-100 per week. And the dallies of Chicago
Cincinnati, St. Louis, Cleveland and Pitts'
l.urch, have. In addition to the New York
ikhu-mllk report, and the extra despatch
special despatches. The t *° m

The Approaching Political Campaign
in New Hampshire,
The Republican Stale Central Committee
for New Hampshire have issued a circular to
the Republican voters of the State, in which
they urge the necessity of a thorough or
gauization in every School District, and the
election of men who arc willing to work and
sacrifice some time for the good of the
cause. They say:
‘‘New Hampshire will he the first to speak in
1867, and the anxious eyes of the loyal men all
over the country will lie tuned toward her, and
what report we shall give the country and the
world remains for yon to say. Wo must show
that neither enemies without nor traitors within
can impede the procress ol oar cherished princi
ples. Onr Congress has taken a bold stand to
reconstruct the Government on a sound basis, and
have foiled the foul policy oi the Administration,
'i he next Congress is pledged to do the same.
The loyal men all over the country stand by Con
gress. We shall he called upon next March to

The establishment of a new News Associa
tion. in so fur as it tends to break up the old
monopoly, and improve the quality and
liefchnesß of news furnished the press, is
matter of general rejoicing. There Is great
need of reform lu this respect. Much that
has hitherto been sent over the lines by tbc
Associated Press, os news, has been contra
dicted the next day. Much of it, too, has
been frivolous or worthless gossip, in which
the pnblic felt no interest; and too much of
It bas been devoted to advertising some
body's private business, or promoting the in
terests of individuals. The refusal of the
New York press, composing the old Asso
ciation, to permit the press to take their
news, on paying for it, unless they would de
cline to take news from another agency, was
a piece of dictation to which, 1 hope, the
press of the country will not submit. Let
there be free competition for news, as for
everything else. Craig’s agency, I think,
will do the public a service.
LECTURES, AC,
We have had a surfeit of lectures and con
certs here recently. Last week Monday
Miss Anna Dickinson presented “Rejected
Slone” to a good bouse. Then the Hutchin
son's (tribe of John) announced two con
certs, and gave one. Thanksgiving evening,
Cough attmcled a great crowd to bis lecture
on “Curiosity.” Friday evening be had
nearly half a house to bear bis lecture on
“ London”; and Monday evening, of this
week, he delivered his “Temperance” lee
ture —lor I know not the how many thou
satidlh time—to a very .small audience. The
truth is, it takes a man of greater genius
than Gough cveu to make a lemiterance lec
ture last over twenty years, and keep it ail
the while a* good and as I'rcs-U a* new ; and
if he had not the good taste to select the
choicest gems from tbe best temperance
writers and orators, and rare skill in appro
priation, assimilation and representation, be
could not succeed as well as he does.
THE COURT HOUSE
and jail here Imre been a disgrace to drill*
zalion for many years, and the chief obstacle
to building new cues has been the inability
to agree upon any site. This ditliculty has,
at length, been overcome, and the board of
Supervisors, at their last meeting, fixed the
site in the Fourth Ward, west of the river,
much to t lie dissatisfaction of cast-siders.
We shall non have a Court House where jus
tice u>ay reign, and a jail which criminals
may prefer to the gallows.

BUSINESS
has been unusually good the past fall, hero,
though just now it Is becoming a Utile dull.
Our best houses have sold twenty.fivc per
cent more goods than last year, up to this
time. But there is an apprehension of dull
er sales next spring. Money is in fair sup
ply, and good names command all they
want. Our largest houses borrow at seven
*er ccul, and ordinary ones at teu per cent,
’uper for discount is pretty closely scruti
nized. There has been no light-reefing yet,
hut there arc signs of pro pa ration for taking
in sail, if the horizon should be overcast at
no distant day.
THE WHEAT CROP.
There is much difference of opinion in re
gard to the amount of the wheat cron yet to
be marketed in this Stale. Ordinarily,
the estimate here is that oue-third of the
crop is uuiktied before the close of naviga
tion; one-third between that time and the
opening of navigation In the spring, and the
remaining third between that time and the
receipt o! the new crop. But the high
price of wheat the past fall has
called out an unusual share—some estimate
one-half—of the crop, at this early period.
But I think two-fifths a fair estimate. Up to
the Ist instant about eleven hundred thous
and bushels more had been received at this
port, than for the same time—eleven months
of last year, And the price has ranged so
high that the value of this year’s wheat
crop, iu the market, will fuliv equal. If not
exceed, that of last Tear- We have three

nati ou Monday evening and Tuesday morn
ing, November 10 and 20, to take into consid
eration the apparent opportunity In New
Toik to improve our arrangements for ob
taining news by telegraph.
It was determined that thcExecutivc Com
mittee should visit NewTork unembarrassed
by arbitrary instructions, and take advan
tage of the situation to effect the reform of
certain grievances, long and patiently en
dured by the publishers of Western news
papers.
The princ’pal complaint was that all news
and market reports throughout the country
were made up to suit the New York demand,
and that, while we paid a large proportion
of the cost of collecting news for the Asso
ciated Press of New York, our convenience
was not consulted, or onr wishes in any de
gree respected in its distribution. This, of
coarse, we all recognized as the natural re
sult of the irresponsible monopoly for many
years established in New York.
Upon Mr. D. n. Craig, the agent of the
New York Association from tbe commence
ment of Its potency, public opinion visited
the larger share of the odium attaching to
the management of that Association, and it
is proper to say that when going to New
York my impressions were muavorable to
him, and my expectation was that the exist
ence of his news agency would be useful only
so far as it might enable ns to make better
terms with the New York Associated Press.
Mr. C. D. Brigham, managing editor of tbe
Pittsburgh Commercial and a member of the
Executive Committee, found, upon returning
borne from tbe meeting of the Board of Direc
tors in this city, that it would be extremely
inconvenient for him to go to New York, aod
wrote to Mr. Horace White, managing editor
of the Chicago Tribune, who bad been
added to the committee by authority of a
resolution adopted by the Board, to serve
the Western Press Association in his place.
Mr. White and myself arrived In New York
on the 2fith November, and found persons
connected with the newspapers, both within
and without Hie old “nows ring," taking a
lively interest in tbc business that we had In
hand; and our acknowledgments arc due
for the great personal kindness with which
we were treated by gentlemen to whose
policy we presently became antagonists.
We bad an interview with the representa
tive men of the New York Associated Press
on the afternoon of our arrival. There were
present Mr. Sinclair, publisher of the Tribune ,
Mr. Jones, business manager of the Times,
Mr. Prime, editorof the Journal of Commerce,
Mr. Beach, manager of the Sun , and Mr. Mar
ble of the IVorW. Mr. Brooks of the Express,
was absent laboring with the New York State
press. Mr. James Gordon Bennett, jr., who
Is the reputed wearer of hla father’s big
shoes In the Herald office, was, we were in
formed, engaged in putting bis yacht Rebecca
in trim for a race across the Atlantic, an oc
cupation that in his mind tar transcends the
duties that devolved upon him In running
the Herald.
The first proposition we made was that the
Western Associated Press would take charge
Of the collodion of nows In tbc West, bearing
all expenses in their own territory, and
send to the New York papers a news report
from the point within our lines nearest and
most convenient to them; and that-we
should receive from them in exchange for
Western news the Eastern and seaboard news,
making special arrai.gcmenta for European,
Washington and Pacific Coast despatches,
we agreeing to pay an equitable proportion
of the cost of the same. Wo were informed
at once that this proposition “ could not be
considered.” Why not? Simply because Us
consideration would imply that the Western
Associated Press was to be treated with by
the New York Association ns an equal; and
that, in the view of the New York gentle
men, would be un intolerable humiliation to
them.
We did not break off negotiations with
the New York Association at this point, but
had another meeting with that body in tbc
Tribune office, Mr. Manton Marble, of tbe
ÜbrW, absent, and Mr. Erostus Brooks, of
tbc Expire**, present. It was stoutly urged
upon us that tbc essential thing to be accom
plished was the unity of tbc press of tbc
country, and that the New York Association
being engaged in tbo business of collecting
and selling news, and proposing to remain in
it permanently, could sell us just the article
we wanted.
In return, we assented to the suggestion
that il would be well for the press to be
milted, provided all parties interested could
be represented in tbc organization. We
were not In favor of unity at tbo espouse of
the continued centralization of authority in
the proprietors of seven New York newspa
pers. What we asked was a republican form
of government, to manage our own affairs in
our own territory. Tbc time had come, In
our judgment, when the New York Associ
ated Press could be fairly said to have out
lived Us usefulness, and when it should be
merged into an association comprehending
the active intelligence and enterprise enlist
ed in Journalism throughout the country.
We told the gentlemen of the New York As
invcstea m ine newspaper business, as well
as more profitable Investments, than they
did. This perhaps was not a remarkably
modest statement, and we will hare to de
pend upon its strict truth for justification In
making it. The gentlemen of the Associa
tion would not give any consideration to our
revolutionary ideas. They believed them
selves In possession of great power, and pro
posed to hold it. The condition of the unity
of the Press was that they only should man*
age it.
A third meeting with the Association was
had; and We submitted a proposition that
we wonld take the report known In the West
as the “Regular Report” from the Associa
tion, and appoint an agent la New York who
should collect news from all accessible
sources and transmit it to us. The Associa
tion then resolved that it would permit no
newspaper accepting its news to obtain In
telligence from any rival association. Wo
asked tbc question whether that rule would
be so rigidly construed, that If we accepted
their news, and an agent of onra bought an
Item of Craig, and sent it to ns, our news
supply would be cut off by them. The
answer was promptly in the affirmative.
So it appeared not only that there remain
ed in the New York Association after Mr.
Craig’s connection with It ceased, the old
and well-known despotic exclusiveucss and
intolerance, but that there had been added a
hitherto unknown and most offensive stu
pidity.
As to ftirnishlng the Western papers any
number ol words of news wanted, from any
point, ot any hour of the day or night, we
found the New York Association disposed to
be accommodating, but regarding that
branch of our business the managers of the
telegraph were the real authorities. The
Associated Press of New York had nothing
more to do with the management of the tele
graph than wepiad; and this fact,’we trust,
will allay the apprehensions of some of our
sensitive friends, who have feared that If
they ventured to offend the New York Asso
ciated Press, they should be cut off sud
denly, and that without remedy, from all
earthly intelligence.
Il is not the fault of the New York Asso
ciation, however, that they have not the
whole press of the country in their grasp, for
they have labored with singular assiduity to
contract with the telegraph company to de
liver us into their bands forever. Persons in
formed in mattersof New York journalism are
aware that the special despatches from all
points, with the exception of Albany and
Washington, forwarded to members of the
Association, are manifolded and sent to them
all, each being at liberty to take the des
patches by paying a part of its cost. Thus
the expense ot the special despatches Is di
vided among seven papers ; and the Associ
ation has a contract with tbc American Tel
egraph Company that compels any newspa
per on Its lines outside of New York, to pay
as much per word for a special despatch as
the combined press of New York City pay.
This rule they sought to extend over the
Western Union Lines, that the Western, like
the Eastern, press might be incapable of
enterprise In gathering news competing with
New York ; and they claim that the consol
idation of the telegraph companies already
extends this role over os, and that anyone
Western paper must pay as much for Its
news by special telegrams os all the New
York papers pay for the same quantity of
words. This, too, when it has been the
policy of tbc leading members of the Asso
ciation to keep up the prices of special tele
graphing that they might monopolize the
business. Their claim, however, that their
contract with the American Company Is, by
virtue of its consolidation with the Western
Union, extended over the lines of the latter,
cannot be substantiated.
The extent of the nice sense of propriety
and enlarged liberality claimed in bchall of
the New York Association by themselves,
will be seen in a perfectly transparent atmos.
pberc, Id the fact that tUsaoclation pro
posed to and urged {tpo(he managers of
the Union Telegraph, ;la| certain advan
tageous contracts weetven them, they
would agree that any oinapcr taking news
of the Association, tbanrbt receive a des

or may be erected, pud pay iae Union

log to do that should > refused tb: news of
the Associated Press.
Now, Mr. Craig has,t least so far as the
Western lines are conened, equal facilities
with the New York Asoclatcd Press. The
most experienced ant efficient of the old
telearaph news men fpn Liverpool to New
Orleans, arc with bin. If he is the great
rascal members of the mw York Association
say he Is, It would do!t?s discredit to their
sagacity if they had foiad him out before he
had been for eighteen years their confidential

efficient machinery in land for the collec
tion and diffusion of tbenews of the world,
while his quiet, vigilant, methodical ways
of doing business gave is a measure of con
fidence In his competency much greatertban
we could entertain for hfe competitor, whose
excitement was painfd to witness. We
found Mr- Craig seeking what we suppose
may be termed bis revenge on the Associa
ted Press, and offering tie only opportunity
wc have ever had, and Ihe only one likely to
he presented us, ofcstabi-hlngcoatTETixioN
in news-gathering In Nev York.
He offers, and I have h my possession his
written agreement, to snrender all the fa
cilities of his office and organization, of
every sort, to the press of the country, the
moment it is organized, tc employ them to
compete with the New fork Association.
He proposed to turn them vrer at once, and
act as agent of the Western,as ho had for the
New York Associated Press; but we conld
not accept this offer without assuming re
sponsibilities greater than bad been antici
pated when our Board of Directors met in
Cincinnati.
Alter our mild proposal to take the re
ports of the Associated Press, reserving the
right to obtain additional news in other
quarters, had been so sharply rejected, wc
asked twenty-four hours lor further consider
alion. Duringthis time a despatch from Mr.
Clapp, of Buffalo, the President of the New
York State Press Association, was received,
sajinß:
“A majority of our Executive Committee re
quest that our aventabo pinalitcd to Bead out
eldenuws until our meeting Tuesday.”
Mr. Simonton replied:
44 Our Executive Commlf-ee decide U can’t be
done; that would yield the Thole point at issue.”
The whole point at Isste is here distinctly
assumed to be whether tie New York Asso
elated Press should obtain the control of the
news of the continent; and we saw it was
a clear case that if Craig were crushed out,
the old despotism, of whose heavy band the
press of the country has had unpleasant ex
periences, would be fixed upon us per*
manently.
At our appointed meeting with the Boar
of the Associated Press, on Wednesday, the
2StU of November, Ihad the satisfaction of
telling those gentlemen that, having made
the roost thorough examination of the situ*
ation that we could make, wc bad decided
that it would best so-ve the interests of the
Western Press wc represented, to aid in the
establishment of anopposition in the news
business in New Ytrk, and that we were
ready to supply curatives with news without
any farther assistance from them.
Having stated the ?asc in this form, we re
tired from the Associated Press rooms*, and
the gentlemen of the Association proceeded
to indulge In a lengthy and animated de
bate. Up to that mcmcut they had not af
fected to dispute ouranthorlty to act for the
Western Associated Press, and wc had re
peatedly asserted our representative charac

attempt to punish us os individuals, and
absurdly passed a resolution to deny the use
or the Aesociotca Press news iwnicn wo had
just told them the whole Western Press did
not require any longer.) to the Cincinnati
Commercial and Chicago Tribune.
And in sending over the wires the sorry
fabrication that wc had been dismissed, they
added to it the arrant falsification that wo
had striven to make arrangements with them
to the special advantage of the three most
considerable Western cities—St. Louis, Chi
cago and Cincinnati—at the expense of the
smaller Western towns. This part of their
proclamation was redeemed from the stolid
imbecility of the story tbss wc bad been dis
missed from the New York Association, by
the malicious perversion of a fact ip .-a man
ner somewhat ingenious.
The pretension that tbo New York papers
interfered to prevent the oppression of the
papers of the smallcrWcstem to wns is not only
totally destitute of truth* but of reason also.
The Associated Press was willing to sell us
news in quantities to suit ns. Wc had no
quarrel about that. They were as ready to
sell twenty thousand words per day as four
thousand. And tbatwosall they wouldhavc
Lad to do with it. One trouble with them
is, they have not been quite convinced that
they arc not masters of the telegraph—that
they have not the exclusive right to the use
of i Icetrlcity in sending hformntion about
the world.
We did talk unreservedly of the common
interests and advantages of the great West
ern triangle of cities, and said to the New
York Associates that, if we had nothing to
do but to deal for those cities, our task would
be comparatively an casy.'one, for we could,
at very moderate rates, provide for tele
graphing to them all the news matter we
wanted in that way, and could entirely
avoid duplications and the weariness of ex
tremely late hours. The most embarrassing
circumstance In our interview with the au
thorities in matters of telegraphing, was the
necessity in the West of obtaining two re-.
ports, and arningiugthat the papers of Fitts*
burgh, Wheeling, Cleveland, Detroit, Toledo,
Indianapolis, Louisville and Milwaukee, as
well ns St. Lonis, Chicago and Cincinnati,
report','ll they wcrc‘*ablc 16 pay for itV~W6
stated with perfect distinctness, that, os we
were representing the Western Associated
Press as a body, we would endeavor to do so
in pood faith, and for that reason, and no
other, we would not attempt to initiate ne
gotiations for the exclusive beneflt of the
three cities. This could bo proven clearly
and fully by individual members of the
Board, if It were thought worth while to ap
peal to them.
The telegraph wires concentrate at Cin
cinnati, St- Louis and Chicago, and there are
so many o! them that some can be employed
in the transmission of news at any boor.
The papers of those cities can take a report
as full as the New York papers have, or
have ever had, of any important intelligence,
and publish It simultaneously with its ap
pearance in New York, without extravagant
cost. It is the distribution of news to the
smaller points by telegraph, that is incon*
venient, and. In proportion, expensive.
It was ascertained that if the journals of
the large cities of the West should with
draw from partnership in news getting with
those of the smaller places, and taking a
full, direct report from New York, decline
to take the brief, regular report that is now
generally disseminated, it was likely that
many of the papers of the inferior towns
would not be able to pay for their reports.
The larger towns, I am well persuaded, pay
much more than the fair proportion of the
cost of the news despatches. Acting for the
whole Associated Press of the West, we
could not attempt to adjust this matter;
but 1 think it of consequence, as an agita
tion has been initiated, that the exact, truth
should be made kuown. If any arc Incredu
lous os to my statements in this regard, it is
only necessary to consult any competent
telegraph authority to have them verified.
There is a contract with the Western
Union Telegraph Company for the trans
mission of two thousand words per day, of
news from Buffalo westward, over the coun
try west of Cleveland and Pittsburgh, and
including Wheeling and Louisville. This
contract, it should be remarked, is not with
the New York Associated Press. We simply
look two thousand words per day at Buffalo
of the despatches they furnished the New
York State Press. The contract with the
Telegraph Company we left undisturbed;
and the words to be sent we took from Mr.
Craig instead of the New York Association.
Under the contract for the transmission of
the midnight report to certain Western
towns of the larger class, there was author
ity to increase the quantity taken from fif
teen hundred to two thousand words, at
proportionate increase of cost; and we or
dered the five hundred words to be added.
As to contracts with the New York Associa
ted Press that are binding, that organization
refuses Us news instantly to all papers that
take Craig's despatches, and we suppose the
papers have the same right to refuse to take
its news because the taking is coupled with
such arbitrary regulations. Besides, the con
nection between the New York Associated
Press and the Western Associated Press was
formally dissolved, both parties consenting
to it, ond the pretended expulsion of two
papers of the Western Association was a
foolish afterthought.
There is but one regular report seat Wes
from Buffalo, and that Is prepared by Mr.
Craig. The telegraph managers recognize
the fact and act upon U, and will charge the
papers that take Slmonton’s despatches for
them at the usual special ratSs, and if they
do not pay.for these despatches the New
York Associated Press must do so. The cost
of Simonton’s despatches to scattering pa
pers In the West that may take them will be,
I believe, nearly ten times that of the regu
lar report.
The remedy for the lateness, incongruity
and repetition of despatches so much com
plained of under the recent system, Is sim
ply to stop at once and altogether taking
despatches by the way of Buffalo, and hare
all reports of Eastern news direct from New
York. It would cost a little more to set the
news stralcbt Irom New York, hut the re
muneration in better time, and greater ac
| curacy, and the avoidance of mixtures and
duplications now so annoying, would be am
ple. I learn that 1,200 words per day, direct 1
from New York, will cost as much as 2,000
words do sent from Buffalo; and I am con
vinced there would be more news adapted to
the Western demand In l,00i) words from
INew York direct, than In 2,000 picked oat of
the New York Stale report at Baflalo ; and
besides this would be the great advantage
gained In time.
I venture to recommend the Immediate
and complete organization of the Press In
each city and town In the West. The pre
vailing Informalities hitherto permitted in
the associations of the local press, should no
longer be tolerated. It is proposed there
should be a general meeting of the Western
Press held before the holidays, and I pre-
I wsAti'-gtrmv, m
] efficiently represented.
Active and iollncntlal gentlemen connected
with the Press in the Southwest and along
the Atlantic seaboard, in the iliddle States
and New England, are urging the formation
of associations like that which we have in
the West, or, rather, like that which we
roust make our Western organization. Re
sponsible newspaper men should engage In
this work without delay, that a Convention
of the Boards of Directors of the several
Associations may be held in New York, not
later than the middle of January, to organize I
an association, in which all sections of the
country will be equally interested and equit
ably represented, and accept Mr. Craig’s I
offer to place in the hands of the ontside
press the facilities of bis office.
Sir. Craig is a man of large means—acquir
ed through the rise and expansion of tele
graph stock, and not by robbing New York
papers of the money they never spent—for
they are habitually guilty of a ludicrous ex
aggeration of their expenditure—and he has
no special ambition to continue in the news
business. His quarrel is our opportunity.
When be takes his revenge by establishing a
competition with the old monopoly, we will
have justice. That competition will be es
tablished beyond a contingency, when the
Press of the country is organized for the oc
casion ; and then It can continue Mr. Craig
as New York Agent, if that seems desirable,
or employ a better man. If one can be found.
Instead of being subordinate to the New York
Press, wc will be masters of the situation.
The best men in the New York journals
confess both the evils and the frailties of the
old Association, which they freely denounce,
not only as a despotism, bat as a humbug,
and one which injuriously affects themselves
as well as others. The present is the time
for the building up of a competition, iu the
great metropolis of the country, in the col
lection and distribution of news—a competi
tion that would promote every legitimate in
terest of journalism, und prove of immense
service in every business centre of the coun
try, in promoting the early diffusion of re
iable Intelligence. M. Halstead.

LAW REFORM JK ENGLAND, AND THE NEW
YORK CODE.
sfr. Dudley Field is again receiving com
pliments from the lawyers of England. He
visited us some sixteen years ago, and told
us about the New York code, and our legis
lators listened to him and declared they
rcallv would set to work and give their conn
try a cheap and simple system of law, —bn*
on lecturing to our barristers last Monday
night Mr. Field found us very much In our
old position. The amount of interested and
bigoted resistance has been too much for the
relurmcrs. And yet, Heaven knows how
great Is our want ofa better code of procedure.
The desire for cheap and good law is
not confined to the mercantile man, but ex
tends to every class. The mortgagor, the
mortgagee, the trustee, the vendor, the pur
chaser, the landlord, the tenant, the partner,
all have a direct and practical interest in the
facts debated by Mr. Field on slonday. As
things are, too, the mode of professional
pay, which lies at the bottom of the code,
is so contrived as to make the lawyer spin
out everything into long verbose statements
and to multiply the steps as much as possi
ble. He is paid nothing for what really costs
him trouble, and compensated by a large
pay for what costs him none, and for what a
copyist writes for him. The State, so far
from correcting the abuse, compels this
mode of pay by law. It denies all free trade
here; It imposes n tariff of prices; appoints
officers to see that it is adhered to. and makes
void, and even criminal, barguinsbetween the
lawyer and his client for a different system
of remuneration. This tariff was enforced
when It was thought wise to have an assize
on bread. It still continues in force as to all
the articles the lawyer sells.
After Mr. Field’s lecture on Monday, there
was a discussion in which slr. Robt. Lowe,
51. P., took part. lie said that the late Mr.
Justice Manic used to say that there were two
objections to having a code—one, that no
one In the world could make a code, and an-
OJLhyr c Jb/U. jK..‘TqaljaaPA*«J?epi?l9 thought
afforded an answer to both these objections
He himself had had three experiences of cod
ification ; one in the case of the Limited Lia
bility Act, n measure containing 110 clauses,
which passed both houses of Parliament with
out a single hostile amendment; another in
regard to the revised code issued bv the De
partment of Education, which was at least a
quasi code, in which by rc-arrangcment the
adoption of definitions and other measures
which fcUggcstcd themselves to persons on
gaged in codification, it was found possible
to reduce the regulations from 250 clauses to
ISO; and the third, which was still going on
in his character of one of the commissioners
to whom bad been entrusted tbe task of
preparing a code of laws for India. In this
work they had made some progress. Codes
of civil and criminal procedure had already
been introduced, and bad both worked well,
and they arc now applying themselves to
make a code of law. They had prepared
law? relating to succession in cases both of
testacy and intestacy, and regulating all the
principal matters of contract. and were now
proceeding to deal with the law relating to
bills of exchange. In their work they bad
been much assisted by tbe result of the la
borsofthc New York Commissioners, and on
bis own behalf, and, what was more impor
tant. on that of bis colleagues, he tendered
bis tlianks to slr. Field and bis coadjutors.
The question whether we could have a code
in thi-i country could not be solved by a
priori reasoning, but only by trying the ex
periment, and whatever the'experiment cost
it was well worth trying.
THE ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES.
A good deal of discussion has taken place
lately in tbe English press relative to the
causes lor the strong conservative feeling
which exist? at our two great Universities,—
Oxfotd and Cambridge. You know that the
vouth&at those scats of learning arc always
in favor of reactionary ideas at home and
abroad. The anihor of the Fugitive Slave
Law, slr. 51ason, found no welcome in Europe
so warm os that which was given him at Ox
ford. Ex-Governor Eyre would be only less
popular than Provost slarshal Ramsay, and
1 dare say even the late Captain Wlrtz
would have found there a knot of
admirers. A far more important
subject than tbe passing fancies of these
young men Is the abuses of the Universi
ties themselves; abuses going to the very
root of their existence. Onr writers are
aware, I suppose, that with the present nu
n-formed House of Commons there is no
chance for effecting any further changes, and
so they adjourn even the consideration of the
University system until the representation
of tbe people is made more complete and a
power developed against which the two
Univenities will find it Impossible to con
tend. Though, however, this is tbe case, 1
think those in America who arc interested
in tbe progress of England may like to
know how wc stand in a question so vitally
concerning the highest interests of onr
people.
Tut* University of Oxford Is a kind of con
federation of twenty -one colleges, each gov
erned by its own statutes, and existing upon
ftinds derived from the endo’vment ot Its
founder; and many of them are so rich that
they arc literally at a loss what to do with
their money. 4, New College,” for instance,
has a revenue of £20,000 a year, and the
sfagdalcnc College revenues arc no less a
sum than £35.000 per annum. The latter
college bas called in arcbitects.and painters,
and builders to help it spend its money, but
is nevertheless, often pazzlcd how to dispose
of It. All the colleges possess like revenues
derived from similar sources, viz.: charita
ble bequests lor the education and support
of poor students. Even where the word
poor Is not precisely expressed, that it most
bare been meant is sufficiently obvious to all
who have any knowledge of the middle ages,
when most of these colleges were founded.
In the noble bora of those days, erudition
was considered a blot rather than as an or
nament upon their escutcheons. Polished
helmets and sharpened spcar-polnts stood in
request far before active brains and pointed
goose-quills- It is quite clear that these
colleges with their scholarships and -fellow
ships were established for the benefit of tho
poor; but it is clearer still that they are now
in the possession of the wealthy. In tbe
middle ages, when the population of the
country did not equal one-fonrth of its ex
isting numbers, the number of Oxford stu
dents was five times as great as it
U at present; and this for the
simple reason, that for the times the learning
to be obtained was cheaper, larger in quan
tity and better In quality than now. What
I long to see see is a movement in England
—and wc have it some day—for employ-
in" the immense endowments to -which I
have referred, in making instruction nearly
gratuitous. We shall then have a shoot
of practical utility, in the place of an insti
tution for the production of dandies, ine
(classics have still too large a share or the
education at Oxford, and mathematics at
Cambridge. lam often amazed at the ignor- i
ance of modern history, for example, dla*
played by undergraduates. Numbers of them
who take high honors, could not give
even a meagre description of the
history and origin of the chief Slates
of Europe, and as to America, they arc
iu the darkness of a winter’s night.
One way of carrying the universities to toe
n asses would be to establish colleges amU
aled with Oxford or Cambridge in all our
great cities, with professors and lecturers ap
pointed by the university. The youth ol the
hulk of our mldcle classes might then have
the benefit of university leaching without its
costliness, aud at the same time be under
heme influences. The examination for _ de
forces might bt at the nnivers'ty, as, in these
aavs, distance Is no object. The advantages
of'unlvcrslty life are many; tut those who
know the debauchery and extravagance ol
the greater number of resident undergrade
the niotiunlor waS^^fihl
bitual use of slang terms is unworthy an I
educSTcd Englishman,” As might be ex
pected, this subject elicited a variety of
speeches, some solemn, some jocose, some
witty, some the reverse. On a division It
appeared that twentv-three members were
in favor ol “the foibftiial use of “slang
terms.” while eleven only were of opinion
that the “ habit is unworthy of an educated
Englishman.”
A uew college Is shortly to be established
at Oxford, as a memorial to the late Rev. J.
Kolle, the author of “The Christian Tear.”
For this purpose some £30,000 has
already been raised. It is intended
more especially for students who
propose entering the Church as clergymen.
It is rather significant of what is expected
that the trustees have provided in case of
the relation of the University to the Church
of England at any time so changing as to
make the existence of Kcllc College at Ox
ford undesirable, —should the wants of the
Church be evidently better supplied at any
future time by a College free from restraints
which legislation may press upon Colleges
at Oxford, —in this event the trustees have
power to dispose of their building and re
move the Institution elsewhere.
PUBLIC HONORS IN ENGLAND.
The Derby Government have made several
new peers since their accession to office, and
various baronetcies and knighthoods. A va
riety of common-place men have been creat
ed legislators for life, and their heirs after
them. They receive these honors not for
any services they have rendered to the coun
try—l speak of the new peers—but that they
may cement the oligarchial reign of a few
powerful families. Who have been the bene
factors of England during the last one hun
dred years? Certainly not the peers. If we
look for the authors of our industrial pros
perity, we find them in each men as watt,
Arkwright, Brindley and Stephenson. In
physical service how much do wc not owe
to Davy, Herschel, Faraday.—yet these
never figured among the “knights of the
garter.” For them the lowest recognition
of all was reserved. In Intellectual philoso
phy, what has been done to ennoble Stewart,
Brown, Hartley or Mill? Yet our ruling
class would do well to remember that their
influence cannot be retained by the advan
tages of birth and wealth alone. Lord
Lytton was once favorable to an elective
peerage, and to that possibly we shall come
alter our Reform BUI fins smoothed the way.
ECCLESIASTICAL ALARMS—-JS TUB CHURCH IX
DANGER?
The Church of England rears Us head
amidst the shaken Institutions of Europe
with an dr of security and strength which
seems to lookers-on to speak exemption,
even, from the thought of danger. Especially
is It to be noted that it has. of lute years,
received a new support from the showy, but
somewhat treacherous, alliance of fashion.
The Church of England being the church of
the aristocracy, has just now the benefit of
the icslhetlc religious sentiment which pre
vails. Yet I believe that the labors of the
earnest men who are striving to develop ex
clusively Us anti-Protestant elements, are
doing serious injury to the church, and Rome
has yet to receive many converts whom
Oxford Is preparing for* her. The High
Church party, whose doings just now occupy
so much of the space oT our journals, are
also driving many to the other extreme.
They have striven to make men believe
that if they would not be Catholics,
they must be infidels. Choose between
the cheering security of the Apostolical sue
ceslon, and the gloomy uncertainty of un
belief. With many this reasoning has been
effectual. But when the terror consequent
upon the Identification of Protestantism
with infidelity subsides, clearer heads
begin to ask themselves whether, if
Christianity did mean submission to
priests, it can have any real claim to the
reverence of men. Thus it happens that
while the more timid spirits arc taking refuge
in the bosom of the infallible Church, some
of their holder companions arc beginning to
do homage to Strauss as the latest champion
of truth and the freedom of the human mind.
Wc witness as yd, I am persuaded, but the
beginning of tbe double movement. When
the present fermentation of Ideas ha? reached
a moreadvanced stage, I fear the accessions
to Rome will appear few and trifling com
pared with those that will be gained by infi
delity.
The celebrated Dr. Pusey bas a letter in
ihe 2<mra of this morning, in which he
makes known the following extraordinary
facts concerning the practice of confession
amongst the members of tbe Established
Church ♦
44 1 f we, clergy orpeople, think that It is good
for onr socle to confe-t* our elns specifically, not
only to God, but also to Bis minister, whatever you
may think of oar wisdom in so doing, you would
not dray as (he liberty of so doing. It is not h
question of tbe liberty of the poopi.% not to con
fess their sine, bat of the liberty of clergy and
people to confess their alas, if they wish It. It is
now above a quarter of a century since confession
so much increased, it sprang not from the teach
ing of the clergy, but from our consciences,
whether rU rgy or people. (For 1 suppose that a
larger pro.uordon of rletgy have need rontessioa.
than oi tho laity; ami that no clergyman wonld
receive confessions of other’s sins who did
not alto confess his own.) What was taught
tiOyian* tieo more s'rongly than before was the
great oflenslvcnees and ingratitude of heavy sin,
ucd a somewhat >tcro doctrine of repentance,
the Praycr-hook. not we, tangbt confession. As
a fact, the pracacc of confession was revived,
while nut a word was said üboutahsolntion. The
teaching followed the practice; and as it began,
soil waecnntiuucd. The use of confession among
us all—priests and pesple—ls very large. It per
vades ever* rank, from the peer to Ihc artiste or
the peasant. In the conrsc of tills q natter ofa
century (to Instance my own experience, which I
mnstknow\ 1 have t een applied to receive con
fessions from persons in every rana, of every
age, old as well as young, io every profession,
even those yon wonld thin* least accessible to it,
—army, navy, medicine, law.”
THE JAMAICA COMMITTEE.
The Jamaica Committee, I am glad to say,
have obtained £5,000, the sum necessary to
prosecute Mr. Eyre; and the refusal of the
Jamaica planters to investigate oven the
ease of that ruffian, Ramsay, has intensified
the determination of the friends of human
to taifnc V\vi-rie';'fßf , ijf,tos[ l .^,A t i s ;L cc a
state of disappointment, arising from their
loss of .Mr. Coleridge as their leading coun
sel. It seems that the prosecution is in the
eye of the lawa “conspiracy.” and conse
quently Mr. Eyre contended that
Mr. Coleridge had received no re
taining fee at all, but that hi*
(Mr. Lyre’s) must be accepted. The case
was referred to the Attorney General, who
decided for Mr. Eyre. I cannot believe,
however, that the learned counsel will take
any active part in the defence. If he does,
the hollowness of a barrister’s conscience
will be more proverbial than ever; for he has
spoken very savagely against the ex-Gov
ernor. Other counsel have been engaged,
and no steps "111 be left untried to bring Mr.
Gordon's murderer to account. <l. n. g.
JOHN H. SURRATT. >
His Arrest In tbc Ranks of the Papal
Army—His Escape*
[Florence (Nov. 14) Correspondence of London
Post.]
It is stated that J. 11. Snrratt (one of the
persons charged with complicity in the
assassination of the late President of the
United States, Abraham Lincoln), has been
serving for some time past in the Papal
Zouaves, his company being quartered at
Vetoli, one of the frontier towns of the Ap
peuines, near Frosinoue. lie had assumed
and was Known in his regiment bv the name
of John Watson. Information of this fact
having been communicated to General Rufus
King,"the Minister of the United Stales at
Rome, no time was lost by him in trans
mitting the news to Ills Government, which
straightway instructed the General to take
suclTmcasurcs as might lead to the securing
of Surratt, alios Watson.
In compliance with his instructions, Gene
ral King repaired to the Vat’cau, requested
an audience of Cardinal AntonclH, ana asked
Lis Eminence whether, in the cvcut of bis
proving the identity of Surratt, the Papal
Government would band him over to that of
the United States. The Cardinal Secretary
promised the General all the facilities in bis
powjr. A few days after, on returning to
the Vatican, General King was made ac
quainted by Cardinal Antonelll with the
measures he had taken. These were con
tained in a series of telegraphic Instructions
sent from Rome, with the corresponding tel
egraphic replies from the local authorities
of veroli and Velletrl. They recorded the
order to arrest Surratt alias Watson; the suc
cessive steps taken in compliance with the
order; the actual arrest; the conveyance to
prison ; the removal from prison under a
guard of five soldiers of Ula company; but
the series closed with the announcement
that when thus led out, Surratt, alias Wat
son, made a sudden dash from his guard,
jumped over a precipice more than one hun
dred feet high, and, though hotly pursued
by fifty Zouaves, was enabled, from the fact
of theli preferring a more circuitous route, to
get clear across the frontier into Italian ter
ritory.
Tbc existing relations between the Italian.
and Papal on oil, and more especially extra
dition matters, are notoriously of such a
character that it Is not likely Cardinal An
tonelH has addressed any very urgent com
munication to the Government ofTlorence,
to assist in capturing the individual who
evaded the vigilance of his own Zouaves;
but of course General King lost no time in
communicating the facts to his colleague at
Florence, where tbc American Government
is most honorably and efficiently represented
by Mr. George P. Marsh, the philologist, to
whom the present generation of English
youth owe a lorgc debt of gratitude.
Kin consequence of thejrepresentations Jdst
made by Mr. Marsh to the Italian Govern
ment, telegraphic instructions have been
forwarded to the towns on the Papal fron
tier, and to all the seaports of Italy, to re
capture Watson alia* Surratt; bnt. If I am
not exceedingly misinformed, the Italian
Government, in declaring Its readiness to
forward tbc great ends cf international jus
tice, has Intimated that, even in the event
of giving up Surratt alia* Watson, it will
stipulate that his life be spared.
At Cedar Fans, lowa, on Wednesday evening
of last week, the friends of Eon. Peter Melendey,
cx-Unlted States hlarsbsl, presented him a hand"
some testimonial. In the shape of a splendid
albnm, capable of containing two hundred card
likereaecs, and 1G23 In greenbacks. After this
ceremony was finished, the party, numbering
some serentj-fire, partook of an elegant anpper.

With the expiration of the rebellion, Indian
hostfllllcs have onmnLhed. With a frontier con
etazitlr extending and encroaching upon the bunt*
Inc grounds of the Indian, hostilities, opposition,
atlrsst, freqcently occur. To meet this, and to
protect the emigrant on his war to the moon tain
Territories, trt ops have been distributed to iHve
the best protection with the means at hand. Few
places are occupied hr mote than two, and many
bv but a tingle company. These troops arc Ren*
efally badly sheltered, and are supplied at great
cost. During the past summer inspections
were made by Generals Sherman, Pope, Ingalls,
Sacbctt and Babcock, to determine the proper
place to occnpy to give the best protection to
ravel, and settlements, and to determine the
most economical method of famishing supplies.
The labor of potting op temporary quarters Is
performed by the troops Intending to occupy
them. In tbc course or the next season more
poimancnt l andings will bare to be erected,
however, which will email an expense for material
at least. I would i c-'pectfmly suggest, therefore,
that an appropriation for this special purpose oe
asked.
The permanent peace establishment being much
larger ihati has own heretofore Divided for, an
appropriation for building barracks, store-houses,

now again being under orders that will compel
my departure to-morrow, 1 am forced to slight
the tusk.
Upon the close of tbe great war of the rebel
lien, JttQC 27, IWS. tbe;wholc territory of tnc Uni
ted * tales was divided Into live great military di
visions, of which that entitled the Military Divi
sion of the Missouri fell to my share, ll was
composed of the Department of the oaio. Major
Cieuoia* Ord commanding; the Department of
the Missouri, M>.jor General John Pope com
manding; and tie Department of Arkansas.
Major General J. «J. Reynolds com
manding. The flist business that demmded our
attention was the rti?baurtrncut of (be vast armies
that rad been formed In the war, and the redac
tion of the depots of accumulated stores. This
ptoercssed with great'apldlty mider the orders
of the War Department; but still, on the Slet of
Octob-r, 1565. there rema : nedln service 1,-157 com
missioned officers. and -25,-187 enlisted men. They
were composed of a small proportion of the old
army, and of volunteers who had been enlisted
for the war and who claimed thotr discharge; bnt
they were stationed In remote districts where they
conld not l*e teplacea during me winter season,
and we had no regular troops available for that
purpose. Mill the reduction of all Irregular
uoops was pushed as fast as the season would
permit, even at th« risk of public property; so
that, by the 31st of October, the aggregate
troops In the military division was reported 37S
commissioned officers, and 13,931 enlisted men.
By general orders of the war Department of
August C, ISOt, an entire charge In the territorial
commam.s was made. This military division be
came that of the Missouri. Ihe department of the
Ohio was taken out .entirely, and the territory
lying w est of the Mlssirslupl ana cast or Utc
Rocky Mountains was dMaed Into four depart
ments, via; The Department of Dakota, Major
General Terry commanding: Department of me
Platte, Major General Cooke commanding: De
partment of the Missouri, Major General Uancock
commanding, and Department of the Arkansas,
Major GtncralOrd commanding. This remains
the case at this time, and as alt Irregular troops
have been discharged, Ihave distributed the reg
ular troops os follows:
Department of Dakota: tho Tenth, Thirteenth,
Twenty-second and 'thirty-first regiments of in
fantry, and SOO Indian scouts.
Department of the Platte: Battery C. Third Ar
tillery, Second Regiment Cavalry, the Eighteenth,
Twenty-Seventh and Thirty-sixtb regiments ot
Infantry, and two hundred Indian scouts.
Department of the Missoni 1: Battery B, Fourth
Artillery, Third and Seventh Regiments of Cav
alry, eight companies Tenth Cavalry (colored),
the Tnlrd. Fifth, Thirty-Seventh, Thirty eighth
(colored) Regiments of infantry, and 150 Indian
scouts.
Department ot the Arkansas: Battery B, Fifth
Artillery, fonr companies Tenth Cavalry (col
ored). Nineteenth and Twenty-Eighth Regiments
ot Inlatitry, and flfiy Indian scouts.
Tins distribution of troops was m deratherwhh
a view vo the fttuuc than to (he Immediate condt
doii of oflkirs, and when these regiments arc fnhy
organized, armed, and instructed, 1 think they
will secure the gencial po ice and security of tae
country and of the national intcrc.-ts etrntste-l io
my keeping. The act of Congress piovldtng the
uc'v military peace establishment passed at so late
a date that we could barely expect honew troops
to he ready this year: but as much progress has
been made in the enlistment amt organization of
the Lew regiments as could have have been ex
pected.
In order to an understanding of the great mili
tary problem to be solved, 1 must state in general
terms that this military division embrace tbe vast
region Horn the Mississippi River to tbe Rocky
Mountains, of an average breadth (cast and west)
of one thousand three hundred and fifty miles, and
length (north and south) o! over one thousand
miles, v tz: from the s< utb border of New Mexico
to the Biiti-b line. On the east are the lertlle and
rapidly Improving Slates of Minnesota, lowa, Mis
sotirl and Arkansas, immediately on tbe west are
the Territories and States of Dakota. Nebra-ka,
hansas and the Indian territory. The land on the
eastern border is teitilc ai d well adapted to settle
ment ; bnt ibetr western pare are a vast pralnc,
with good grasses but gvneta'Jy devoid of trees or
minerals, arc subject to droughts, and are not In
viting toe* tilers. N'cxt in order are tbe moun
tainous Territories of Montana, Utah, Colorado
and New Mexico, ccmpo-cd of high plateaus and
mountains, containing minerals of every kind,
with forests ot timber and numerous valleys sus
ceptible of bleb cultivation, either by means of
the ordinary raius, or the more certain system Of
litigation that has been began within a recent
Dcricd, and bae been pushed with an energv and
encccfs that promises the best results. These
new and mountain Territories present a most in
nation, and arc iu my Judgment worthy the lib
eral andfosterlngcareof tbe General Government.
Between these mountain Territories and those
of the rUvr border lie the great plain of Amer
ica, which have been well mapped and described
hy the hundreds of explorers that have traversed
than from the time or the expeditions of IMkr,
and Lewis and Clark, as early as 1603,
'Dill the present moment. These plains
can never be cultivated like Illinois, never be
filled with Inhabitant* capable of s<-lf-govcroment
and self-defence as against Indians and maraud
ers, hut at best can become a vast pastnrc-ficld,
open and free to all lor the rearing ot vast herds
ot horses, mules, cattle and sheep. The mono
mtn Territories seem to be more rapidly improv
ing and assuming a condition of self-protection
aim defence, because the people can acimlre fixed
habitations and their property is generally group
ed in valleys of some extent, or in localulen of
mines capable of sustaining a people etron"
enough to guard themselves against the predatory
bands of nomadic Indians, Mill tbev occupy at
this time an isolated position, presenting a thinly
settled frontier m every direction, with a restless
people branching ont In search of a better place,
or of better mines. To defend thorn perfectly Is
an otter impossibility, and all we can do is to aid
the people in self-defence, until in time they can
lake care of themselves, and to make the roads
by which they travel or bring thilr stores Irom
the older parts of our conn try as safe as the case
admits of.
This brines me to the consideration of the Ques
tion i f the Indians who. in nomadic and predato
ry bands, infest tbe whore country described,
sometimes Iu one place and then in another.
These Indians arc universally, bv tbe people ot
our frontier and of ont Uola'ed* Territories, re
garded as hostile, and wc. the military, charged
with a genera] protection of the infant settlement.}
aud land routes of travel, have to dispose of our
troops and act as though they were hostile; while
by the laws of Congress, and the acta of our Exec
utive authorities, these Indians are construed as
ardor the guardianship and protection of the Gen
eral Government, through civilian agents. This
whole subject bas heretofore been so ably report
ed on by General Pope and others, well qualified
to judge, that 1 will not nere renew tbe discus
sion. but merely state as the result of my own
Judgment that tbe entire management of
tbe Indians should be controlled by the
mi liary authorities, and that the commanding
officers ot tbe troops should have not only the
surveillance of these Indians, bnt should super
vise and control the disbursement of moneys and
distribution of presents to tbe tribes nnder past
and Tutor? treaties. Indians do not read, and only
know ot our power and strength by wbst they see.
and (bey always look to tbe man wbu commands
soldiers a* the representative of onr Government.
The complaints of short payment by (he agents
are universal, and the Indians themselves would
be more likely to receive the ample annuities ap
propriated by Congress if the agents were re
quired to make the semi-annual payments subject
to the inspection and control of the military com
menders, who. as a rule, are not eo liable to be
corrupted bjkthc chances of gain and peculation
as temporary appointees.
The Indians who haw heretofore been located
on reservations, each as tbe Wyandotte, r-bawnces,
Pottawatomie*, Pawnees, Cherokee*. Choctaws,
Creeks, etc., etc., have given little or no trouble
the last year, and do not comewl tom onr super
vision more than onr own people. But the wan
dering fcious.who rove irom Minnesota to Mon
tana, and down as far as tbe Arkansas, have done
acts of predatory hostility almost Impossible to
foresee orto prevent. In like manner the Arapa
hoe* and Cheyennes, Kiowas, Comanchea aud
Apaches, Na'ajocs and Utcs, though supposed to
be restricted to reservation?, w:li not settle down,
but they roam, according to their babbits, over
the vast olatns, and they too hare done acts of
hosrility.vthongh the old men and chief? of the
tribes deny the a«s altogether, or charge them on
their yonng men, wbo, when absent on the hunt,
arc beyond tbeir control.
1 propose the coming year, (with your consent,
and with that of the Secretary of the Interior, In
whose control these Indians are supposed to be.)
to restrict tbe Slonx north of toe Platte, weit of
the Missouri River, and cast of tbe new road to
Montana, whten starts from Laramie for Virginia
City, by way of Forts Reno, Philip, Kearney, C.
F. Smith. Ac. AD btoux found outside of these
limits, without a written pass from some military
commander, defining clearly tbeir object, would
be dealt with sommsil’y. In like manner! should
restrict the Arapahocs, Cheyennes, Comonches,
Klowas, Apaches and Bavajoee south of :bo Ar
kansas and cast of Fort Union. This would
leave for our people exclusively the use of the
wide belt, east and west, between the Plal'e and
tbe Arkansas, in w hlch lie the two great railroads,
and over which passes tbe bulk of travel to the
mountain Territories- As long as these Indians
can bunt the bufialo and antelope within
the described limits we will have the depredations
of last summer, and worse yet, tbe exaggerations
of danger raised by our own people, often for a
very base purpose. It Is our duty, and It shall be
my study, to make the progress of construction
of the great Pacific Railways that lay In this belt
of country as safe as possible, as also to protect
the stage and telegraph lines against any hostile
bands, bnt they arc so long that to guard them
pcrfecily Is an Impossibility, anles* we can restrict
ihe Indians, as herem staled. I beg you will sub
mit this proposition to the Honorable Secretary
of the interior, that we may know that we do
sot violate some one of the solemn trestles made
with these Indians, who ore very captions, and
to the very letter the execution on our part
of those treaties, the obligation of which, they
seem to comprehend perfectly.
In the Department of Dakota I propose tha:

8,753 men, women, and children, on a reservation
of fort* miles i-qnare, at .the Bosque Redondo,
(Foil Sntni.cr,'* and General Haines, my chief coai
mls.-arv, repoila the cost of feedhg them alone at
from sdt',o(-u to f«u,000 a month. This is done on
the supposition that It cotti less to Iced than lL?ht
them. In this connection 1 send herewith a most
full and complete report by General Carlelon, ot
dale October 17. ’.SCO, called lor by me daring my
recent tour. I invite yuar special attention to the
papers endorsed bv him, giving ihe abstracts of
tee Indian scoots for the years ’Ss3and 1304; and I
infer these fights have been much l:ss frequent
since nc has collected Lr.c hostile Indians on the
reserve. You will observe, also, that his
calculation is that the Indians will soon be
I self-supporting. I hope so, f r su’ely wo can
-1 not ailo»d to iced them ar the present rate with
out a-klup a j-pccial appropriation of Congress. 1
also heic subjoin the most valuable and compre
hensive report of General Pope on the same mat
-1 ter?, of date August 13, irCC, and think ‘hat bis
j view? are emitted to very meat weight andcoa
! eidtraiion. I think these Navajoes and Apaches,
theCheyerncs and Arapahoes, with the Kiowa?,
could probably )>c got to reservations near the
Cherokee? and Choctaw's; but between them and
XVc Utes and the Sioux there is a traditional here
ditary war that caucotbe reconciled in one gener
ation. They will not live together; and. indeed,
while by f. cdiug the Indians, we may keep some
quiet, otteis will he as hard (o keep to their reserv
ations as the wild hnSaloes. Alter the next
year's exnerience. I Lope to be able to advise
*nm«> more specific measures tsan are cmbiaccd
herein.
In the Department of Arkansas, General J. J.
Rt-vnolds has managed matters* so quietly and so
skilfully that we have noc a particle of trouble.
In masters connected with tho frei*d negroes, be
was admirably seconded by he CommU.-ioucr.
General bptagoe, a roost accomplished soldier and
gentleman 1 feel assured that Central Ord, wao
has recently succeed-d Scnorai Reynolds, will
continue in that Department to maintain absolute
peace, and that plenty and prosperity will soon
repay the labors of the industrious Inhabitants.
The Indians to the west of Arkan-as are reported
as more nearly approaching civilization than any
Indians ever din on ibis continent. It is worthy
an effort on our part to evdeavor to -prvad their
influence, and to attract to the same quarter all of
the Plain Indians that can be Seduced to remove
there, and by contact and example to learn to cul
tivate land and raise cattle and horses, by which
many of the Choctaws and Chickasaw?, Chero
kee? and Creeks have occorae quite wealthy and

Be said he was directed by the Republican mem
bers of tne Uonse of Representatives to offer their
most sincere and hearty thanks for the noble tes
timony home to what has been charlublv termed
the “ pure patriotism of Congress.” U ’might be
that tongres deserted some of that praise.
Through unexpected events tislted upon the na
tion for its sins, a man had been raised Into power
whom it required all their efforts and
determination to prevent from becoming
a King instead of a President. [Bisses. |
The war of blood had been suspended; he wished
be conld sav ended, but that war wa« not ov*r.
It? main and final object was pursued be the • ne
roy with a relentless vigor. Tne object first had
been to role over at least half the country a* a na
tion of slates.to introduce free trade, and to hu
miliate the North for its prr*it*’cnt advooacy of
freedom. Tte object now was to rule t‘.e u-tole
nation by means of an oligarchy, making negroes
and Copperheads coMrinntc to the increased
power of the South; through ‘he irceiso of the
number ot Its votes, to s-Ue the reigns of
tha Government to Introduce free trade
and to break down the modesty of the free people
of the North. Baring the war Jeff. Davis was
Commander-in-Chlcf of Die rebel army. with bee
as bis chief advisor. Now, Andrew Johnson was
their Commander In-Chief, while poor old Wool
was their ( hief Martial adviser, 'and for the navy
they Lad Semmes and Welles. (Laughter.) The
people were now to decide whether they were to
have Andrew Johnson as President or as King,
for they were told tfiey had no other choice
It-ft. [Lsnghter.j He wanted the encourage
ment of tha soldiers; the enemy had the vantage
ground, having possession ot ihc White House
and was diet ensmg with a corrupt hand the vast
patronage of the nation. And yet be had no feme.
Tne army consisted of citizens as well as soldiers.
It bad a few mcicenary office**, like the Stead
mans, ibeßix’s, and the Wools; but it the Gov
ernment were to older Grant, or Howard, or Par
ragut to do its treacherous work, they would
bieafc their swords rather than obey. With Sheri
dan for a leader, and with 2.’,0C0 or 50,DOi> col
ored soidiers to follow him. they might dey
Andrew Johnson and ail who) would follow bis
lead. Bnt if the time thonld ever come when the
conspirators would mu-ter audacity tonal to their
ambition, and. as once happened hi England, at
tempt ’o tmn the regular army against the people.
Cot gr« s s would not have to rely on the Southern
fretdmen alone. ’lhc men of the bwal Norm
would spring to their tect and their wea-
I pons as they had when they beard the first
1 booming cannon ot Snnuer. Let Con

of the late war would like cute of the

TbeWenona Bread Poisoning; Case.
Oar readers Trill remember the excite-*
meat produced last summer by tbe case of
bread poisoning at Wenona in this State. It
was partially investigated at tbe time, bat
has recently been taken np by Professor
Hereford, of Cambridge, acd the following
summary report upon tbe subject, addressed
by him to the Treasurer of the works where
the self-raising ingredients ore prepared,
shows the poison to have been occasioned
by arsenic:
Wntoxa, Marshal! Co ,
Geo. F. Wi son, Urcasarer Romford Chemical
Works, Providence. B.
Mt Deau 3m; After a long and most careful
investigation of all the facts to be obtained con
cerning tbe late poisoning case which occurred
at Ibe Dillman House in this place, and which was
publicly alleged to have been caused by the use
of self-raising hour, the raising Ingredients of
which were prepared in accordance with my in
structions, in the works under your charge, I
have to report that the polsonin? was evidently
produced oy arsenic, either designedly or sca
t cntally inlrodnced into the biscuit
eaten by those wdo were pois
oned. It is absolutely impossible that any
injurious etfec's whatever should follow the use
of these self-raising Ingredients, because the on
ly bodies ibat could po-sibly result from their
use in the biscuit would be phosphate of lime
and phosphate of soda, both well known os
essential and normal constituents of wheat and
com—in short, of all the cereals—and the total
amount of these two bodies would not quite
equal the quantity removed with the brau from
the flour by the miller. ’ , . , . *
lbe following certificate is volontarly given by
the Physician? and Apothecaries of Wenoua, with
a view to remedy, as or as possible, the injurious
eflecis upon yoorbnamess, and that of your cor
respondents or custotnvw, which was caused by
the first publication of the case.

Ibe undersigned, physicians and druggists of
