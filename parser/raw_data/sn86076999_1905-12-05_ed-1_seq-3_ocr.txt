THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
ANNUAL, LODGE OF SORROW.
ENTERS SUIT.
A FINE TRAVESTY.
Document Which
Goes to
Congress Today.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Congress
opened today at noon. Cannon was
nominated by the Republicans for
speaker and Williams by the . Demo
crats. The former was chosen. Con
gress then adjourned In respect for
Senator Piatt of Massachusetts.
President Roosevelt has written a
message to Congress full of confidence
fcs to the future,, irreatnlng a dee?
'spirit of Americanism, dealing ' with
those questions which he has thru it
to the front in advance of his party
and proposing remedies with a calm'
reliance in the capacity of Congress
'3 handle them.
It is a very long message. Perhaps
such a long message has never bean
written by a President to Congress,
The newspaper that prints it all will
have to issue a supplement.
The part of the message which will
attract the most attention, ; because
it deals with what has been made by
the President the "paramount Issue"
in American politics, is that devotjd
to the railroad question. GeneraOv
the views of the President as to
remedies are those which were "given
by Senator Knox of Pennsylvania in
his Pittsburg speech.
Less- than one page was devoted to
a discussion of a rate question a year
ago, but that was fenfficnt to kejp
Congress in a turmoil throughout its
entire session, in the message which
is to be Tead to Congress Tuesday
much more space will be devoted vj
rates and companion subjects.
It. will be found tnat the President
stands almost where be stood a year
ago, but . not exactly. Then he said
that while It was undesirable to
clothe the Interstate Commerce Coin
mission with general authority to fix
railroad rates, he did believe that the
comission should ba vested "with the
power, where a given rate has been
challenged and after a full hearing to
be found unreasonable, to decide, sub-
a reasonable rate to take its place,
the ruling of the commission to take
effect immediately and to obtain un
less and until reversed by the court
of review."
POWER TO FIX SCHEDULES
rih his message this year the Presi-
- -3 A 11 I J J I . . - 1 1
ueui, ii is uuucrsiuoa, lhkcs iiiw posi
tion that this power should be vested
in the Interstate Commerce Commia-
. sion, or "some other- power" created
j j vuv - vuvi ca vw a uuivui., cauu .nx i
the commission should have the au
thority to fix a maximum rate that !s
to say, a rate above which the car
riers shall " nof go until the matter
has been reviewed by the court. But
the President still stands out for a
law which would put .the rate into ef
feet and keep it there, and to all
intents and purposes his position
tne same as last year, Because mere
would seem to be no liklihood of an
agreement on some rate-regulatii;
body outside of the Interstate Com
merce Commission.
The President is not opposed to a
Federal inspection of the great life
insurance' companies, for the better
protection of the policy holders. He
believes the -work of the., Bureau of
Corporatins in investigating crpora-
tlons Is having a good eff ect
The message strongly denounces the
corrupt -use of money at elections. Th
President would make it unlawful for
any corporation to contribute to , the
fnnda of " a. political committee. ' He
would require the publicity of all con
tributions, of all individuals. He
leaves Congress no excuse for failing
to meet this growing evil.
There Is a full discussion of, the
Panama Carnal. . He describes the
present financial situation, showing
that the money is exhausted and that
more must be appropriated and at
'PCe if the work is not to halt.
I'-ve is a recommendation .th it
Congress pass a law reducing the tax
of national bank circulation secured
by the proposed Panama canal bonds.
so that they will be available for cir
culation on the same, basis as the 3
'per eent United States consols.-
I The President refrains from urging
la revision of the tariff.; He does sujj-
leet however, the granting oi a
lduction in the schedule of import i
ltions from the Phillipplne Islands, and
Vnakes some recommendations for
legislation concerning the Philippine.
I There is a full discussion of our re
lations with China on the cuestion ot
the exclusion' of the Chinese. There
tas been much ground for complaint
n the part cf intelligent' Chinese
gainst the enforcement of the exclu
sion laws. -nd Congress is councel-"!
