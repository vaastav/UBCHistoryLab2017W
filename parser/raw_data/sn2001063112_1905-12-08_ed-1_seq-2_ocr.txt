:'vv To Punish All Subterfuges.
illegal transactions often occur under
the forms of law. It has often occurred
that' a shipper has been told by a traffic
officer to buy a large quantity of some
commodity and then after it has been
bought an open reduction Is made in the
rate to take effect immediately, the ar
rangement resulting to the profit of the
one shipper and the one railroad and to
the
damage ot *11
their
competitors for
it must not be forgotten that the big ship
pers are at least as much to blame as any
railroad in the matter of rebates. The
law should make it clear so that nobody
can fail to understand that any kind of
commission paid on freight shipments,
whether in this form -or in the form of
fiotltious damages, or of a concession, a
tree pass, reduced passenger rate, or pay
ment of brokerage, is Illegal.
It Is worth while considering whether it
would not be wise to confer en the gov
ernment the right of civil action against
the beneficiary of a rebate fer at least
twice the value of the rebate this would
help stop what Is really blackmail. Ele
vator allowances should be stopped, for
they have now grown to such an extent
that they are demoralizing and are used
as rebates.''
Control Over Private Car Lines.
All private-car lines, industrial roads, re
frigerator charges, and the like should be
expressly put under the supervision of
the Interstate Commerce commission or
some similar body so" far as rates, and
agreements practically affecting rates, and
concerned. The private-car owners and
the owners of industrial railroads are en
titled to a fair and reasonable compensa
tion- on their investment, but neither pri
vate cars nor Industrial railroads nor
spur ^tracks should be utilized as devices
for securing preferential rates. A rebate
in Icing charges, or in mileage, or In a
division of the rate for re'frigerating
charges is just as pernicious as a rebate in
any other way. No lower rates Should
apply on goods imported than actually ob
tains on domestic goods from the Ameri
can seaboard to desUnay6n except in
cases wliefg water competition is the con
trolling influence.
Publhsity la Much Needed.
There should be publicity of the ac
counts of comhion carriers: no common
carrier -engaged In interstate business
shdtild keep any books of memoranda oth
er than those reported punittaJit tb law or
regulation, and these books or memoranda
should be open to the Inspection of the
government. Only lnvthis way can viola
tions or evasions of the law be surely de
tected. A system of examination of rail
read accounts should be provided similar
to that now conducted mfo the national
banks by the bank examiners a text flfst
class railroad accountants, if they had
proper direction and'proper authority to
Inspect books and paper*, could accom
plish much in preventing willful viola
tions of the law.
Courts to Act Rapidly.
I urge upon the congress the need of pro
viding for expeditious ftfctlcrn by the In
terstate commerce cotaimjAlon in all these
matters, Whether In regufjiKlng rotes for
transportation or for staring Or for handl
ing property or commodities in trSSifiit.
The .history of the: cases Itttmted under
the present commerce act shows fhat its
efflcac
stro
JM, been to a great degree de-
by the weapon of deliy, almost
.the moat formidable weapon in the hands
of thoso whose purpose it is to violate the
law.
Tho Labor Question.
The question of securing a healthy, self
respecting and mutually sympathetic at
titude .as ^between employer and employe,
capitalist and wage worker, is a difficult
one. All .phases of tho labor problem
move difficult when approached. But the
underlying principles, tho root principles,
in accordance with which the problem
must be solved, are entirely simple. We
can get justice and right dealing only
if.: we put as. of paramount importance
She jprJnciple of treating a man on hla
worth .as a inan rather than with refer
ence to. this social position,. his occiipa
tjon, or the class to which he belongs.
There are selfish and brutal men in all
ranks -of life.
This government is not and never shall
bo government by a plutocracy. This
never si
.government is not and shall be
goverament by a mob. It shall continue
to be in the future what it has been in
the past,, .a 'government based on the
theory '.that each man, rich or poor, is
to be treated simply jind solely on his
worth as a: man, that all his personal and
property rights are to, be safeguarded,
and that lie is neither to wrong others
nor to suffer wrong from others.
To Regulate Life Insurance.
The great insurance -companies afford
striking examples of corporations whose
.business has: extended so far beyond the
jurisdiction of the states which created
them as to preclude strict enforcement of
supervision and regulation by the parent
states. In my last annual-message I recom
mended "that congress carefully consider
whether the power of the bureau ot cor
porations can not constitutionally be ex
tended to cover interstate transactions in
Insurance."
Recent events hav« emphasized the im
portance of an early and exhaiistlvo con
sideration of this question, to see whether
it is not possible to furnish better safe
guards than the several states have been
able to furnish against corruption of the
flagrant kind which has been exposed.
It has been only too clearly shown that
•certain of the men at the head of these
large corporations take but small note of
the ethical distinction between honesty
and dishonesty they draw the line only
this side of what may be called law
honesty. the kind of honesty necessary in
order, to avoid, falling into the clutches of
the law.
State Supervision Inadequate.
I repeat my previous recommendation
that the congress should also consider
whether the federal government has any
power or owes any duty with respect to
domestic transactions in insurance of an
Interstate character. That state supervi-
slon has proved Inadequate is generally
(conceded. The. burden upon Insurance
companies, and therefore their policy hold
ers, of conflicting regulations of many
states, Is unquestioned, while but little
effective check 1b imposed upon any able
and unscrupulous man who desires to ex
ploit the company In his own interest at
the expense of the policy holders and of
the public.
As a remedy for this evil of conflicting,
ineffective, and yet burdensome regulations
there has been for many years a wide
spread demand for federal supervision. The
congress has already recognised that in
terstate insurance may be a proper subject
for federal legislation, for in creating the
bureau of corporations it authorized it to
publish- and supply useful information con
cerning interstate corporations, "including
corporations engaged in insurance." What
is said above applies with equal force to
fraternal and benevolent organizations
which Contract for life Insurance.
Takes Up the Tariff.
There is more need of stability than of
the attempt to attain an .ideal perfection
in the methods of raising revenue and the
shock and strain to the business world
certain to attend any serious change in
these methods render such change Inad
visable unless for grave reason. It is not
possible to lay down any'general rule by
which to determine the moment when the
reasons for will outweigh the reasons
against such a change. Much mus't de
pend, not merely on the needs, but on the
desires, of the people las a whole for needs
and desires are not necessarily identical.
Of course no change can be made on
lines beneficial to, or desired by, one sec
tion or one state only. 'There must be
some thing like a general agreement
among the citizens of the several states, as
represented In the congress, that the
change is needed and desii'ed In the Inter
est of the people. aB a whole. In time of
peace and revenues much on the average
taklng a series of years together, equal the
expenditures or else the revenues must
be increased. Last year there was a de
ficit.
Unless our expenditures can be kept
within the revenues then our revenue
laws must be readjusted.
Too Early tt' Rovise Tariff.
It is as yet too oarly to attempt to out
shape such a readjustment
for ,it is as yet too early to

Need an Elastic Currency.
Bvery consideration of prudence
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity* to our currency system. The
evil does not consist in an inadequate
volume of money, but In the rigidity of
this volume, which does not respond as
it should to the varying needs of com
munities and or seasons. Inflation must
be -avoided but some provision should
be made that will Insure a larger volume
of money during the fall and winter
months than In the less active seaBons
of the year so that the currency will
contract against speculation, and will
expand for the noeds of legitimate bus
ness. At present the treasury depart
ment is at irregularly recurring inter
vals obliged, in the interest of the bus
iness world—that is, in the Interests of
the American public—to try to avert
financial crises by providing a remedy
which should be provided Dy congres
sional action.
Scrutinize Campaign Gifts.
-I desire to repeat this recommendation:
In political campaigns in a country as
large and populous as ours it is inevlt-
able that there should be ''nuch expense
of an entirely legitimate kind. This, of
course, means, that many csntribu'tlons,
and some of them of large size, must
be made, and, as a matter of fact, in any
big political contest such contributions
are always made to both sides. It Is
entirely proper both to give anJ receive
them, unless there is an improper motive
connected with either gift or reception.
If they are extorted by any kind of pres
sure or promise, express or implied, "di
rect or indirect in the Tyay of favor or
immunity, then the giving er receiving
becomes not only improper but criminal!
It will undoubtedly be difficult as a
matter of practical detail to shape an
act which shall guard with reasonable
certainty against such misconduct but
if it is possible to secure By law the full
and verified publiCatlo'h in det'all of all
the suin's contributed to and expe'hded
by the candidates or committees of any
political parties, the result can not but
be wholesome.
Stop Insurance Campaign Funds.
All contrlbutfons by corporations tojany
political commi'ttee or ttft any political
purpose Should be forblOden by law di
rectors should not be permitted tb use
stockholders' money for SdcSh purposes:
and, moreover, a prohibition of thls'k-in'd
would be, as far as if wgftt, an idfffectTve
method of stopping the evils aimed it .in
corrupt practices aefs. Not only should
both the nafidn&l and the several staXe
legislatures forbid ciny officer of e. co^pio
rarion from using the money of the
corporation in or about any election, but
they should also fbrbid such use of
mdney in connection With any legislation
save by the employment of courisel in
public manner for distinctly legal serv
ices.
Takes Up Peace Question.
More and more war is coming to be
looked, upon as in Itself a lamentable and
evil thing. A wanton *tr uSSless w4r or
a war of mere aggression—In short, any
war begiin or carried dn In a ccttiscience
less spirit, is to be condemned as a pecu
liarly atrocious crime against all hu
manity. Whenever it is possible for a
nation or an individual to work for real
peace, assuredly it is failure of duty not
so to strive but if war is necessary and
righteous th'en either the man or the
nation shrinking from it forfeits all title
to self respect. We have scant sympathy
with t}iew sgntlmentajrst who dreads op
pression teas than hljyslcal suffering, who
would prefer a shameful peace to the
pain and toll sometimes lamentably nec
essary in order to secure a righteous
peace.
International Arbitration.
Very much can be done through another
Hague conference In this direction, and
most earnestly urge that this nation do all
In Its power to try to further the move
ment and to rimko the result of the de
cisions of The Hague conference effective.
I earnestly hope that the conference may
be able to dfevtse some way to make arbi
tration between nations the chstomary
way of settling international disputes In
all save a few classes of cases, which
should themselves be as shaisly defihed
ana rlgjdly limited as the present gov
ernmental and social development of the
World will permit. If possible there slroOld
be a general arbitration treaty negotiated
among all the nations represented at the
conference.
The Monroe Doctrine.
One of the most effective Instruments for
peace is the Monroe doctrine as it has
been and is being gradually developed by
this nation and accepted by other na
tions. No other policy could have been as
efflcient in promoting peace in the western
hemisphere and in giving to each nation
thereon the chance to develop along its
own lines, if we had refused to apply
the doctrine to changing conditions it
would now be completely outworn, would
not meet any of the needs of the present
day, and Indeed would probably by this
time have sunk into complete oblivion.
That our rights and Interests are deep
ly concerned in the maintenance of the
doctrine is so clear as hardly to need
argument. This is especially true in view
Of the construction of the Panama canal.
As a mere matter of self-defense we must
exercise a close watch over the approaches
to this canal and this meanB that we must
be thoroughly alive to our interests in the
Caribbean sea.
Not a Means of Aggression.
There are certain essential points which
must never be forgotten as regards the
Monroe doctrine. In the first place we
must as a nation make it evident that we
do not intend to treat it in any shape or
Way as an excuse for aggrandizement on
pur part at the expense of the republics
to the south. We must recognize the fact
that .in some South American countries
there has been much suspicion lest we
should interpret the Monroe doctrine as in
some way inimical to their interests, and.
we must try to convince all the other na
tions of this continent once and for all
that no Just and orderly government has
anything to fear from ui.
Can't Use It as a Shield.
Moreover, we must make it evident that
we do not Intend to permit the Monroe
doctrine to be used by any nation on this
continent as a shield to protect it from
the consequences of its own misdeeds
against foreign nations. If a repub'.lc to
the south of us commits a tort against
a foreign nation, such as an outrage
against a citizen of that nation, then the
Monroe doctrine does not force us to in
terfere to prevent punishment of the tort,
save to see that the punishment does not
assume the form of territorial occupation
in any shape. On the one hand, this
country would certainly decline to go to
war to prevent a foreign government
from collecting a just debt on the other
hand, it is very Inadvisable to permit
any foreign power to take possession,
even temporarily, of the custom houses
of an American republic lit order to en
force the payment of its obligations for
such temporary occupation might turn
into a permanent occupation. The only
escape from these alternatives may at
any time be that we must ourselves un
dertake to bring about some arrangement
by which so much as possible of a Just
obligation Ahall be paid. If is far bet
ter that this country should put through
such an arrangement, rather than allow
any foreign country to undertake it.
The 8anto Domingo Question.
Santo Domingo, in her turn, has now
made an appeal to us to help her, and
not only every principle of wisdom but
every generous lnstlncc within us bids us
respond to the appeal. It Is not of the
slightest consequence whether we grant
the fid needed by Santo Domingo as an
incident to the wise development of the
Monroe doctrine, or because we regard
the case of Santo Domingo as staiiutng
wholly by itself, and to be treated as
such, and not on .general principles or
with any reference to the Monroe doc
trine. The conditions in Santo Domingo
have for a number of years grown from
bad to worse until a year ago all society
was on the verge of dissolution. For
tunately, Just at this time a ruler sprang
up in Santo Domingo, who, with his
colleagues, saw the dangers. threatening
their country and appealed to the friend
ship of the only great and powerful
neighbor who possessed the poorer, and
as they hoped also the will to help them.
There was imminent danger of foreign
Intervention. The previous rulers of
vSan-
to Domingo had recklessly incurred debts,
and owing to her Internal disorders She
had ceased to be Able to provide means
of paying .the debts. The patience of her
foreign creditors had become eath&usted.
and at least two forelgn -nations ^were on
the point of Intervention, and were"Miiy
prevented trdm Intervening "by. 'the "un
official "assurance of this^koverqmeht that

Just, while some were not of a
character which fully renders It obli
gatory on, or proper, tor, Santo Domingo
to pay them In full. But she could not
pay any of them unless some liability
was assured her government and people.
Asks Support for Treaty.
Accordingly the executive department
of our government negotiated treaty
under which we are to try to help the
Dominican people to straighten out their
finances. Ihis treaty 1$ pending before
the senate. In the meantime a temporary
arrangement has been made whicn will
last until the senate has had time to
take action upon the treaty. Under this
arrangement the Dominican government
has appointed Americans to all the im
portant positions hi the customs service,
and they are seeing to the honest collec
tion ot tho revenues, turning over 45 por
cent, to the government for running ex
penses and puttlnr
Into a safe de]
slon in case
among the various creditors, whether
European or American.
This has completely discouraged all rev
olutionary movemertt, while It has al
ready produced such an increase in tho
revenues that the government is actually
getting more from the 45 per cent that
the American collectors turn over to It
than It got formerly when it took the
entire revenue. It is enabling the poor
harassed people of Santo Domingo once
more to turn their attentlo'n to Industry
and to be free from the curse of Inter
minable revolutionary disturbance.
There Is, of course, opposition to the
treaty from dishonest creditors, foreign
and American, and from the professional
revolutionists of the island itself.
The Army and Navy.
We cannot consider the question of our
foreign policy withotit at the same time
treating of the acrpy and navy. We now
have a very small army1—indeed, oile well
nigh Infinitesimal when compare with tho
army of any other la^ge nation.
Of course the army we do haye should be
as nearly perfect of its kind and for its
size as is possible. I do not believe that
any army in the world has a better aver
age of enlisted man or a b«ter type of
junior officer But the a'rmy should bo
trained to act effectively in a mass. Pro
vision should be mac]o by sufficient appro
priations for maneuvers of a practical
kind so that the troop's may learn how
to fake care of themselves under actual
service conBI.tCbns.
The numlrer of posts In which the army
Is kept In time of rfeft-ce should be mate
rially dimrrtffiied find the ptijfrs that are
left mado cbrcejpliridlnftly lMEer.
To acdbmpllsh this effffwe mus't havo nor.
company or re^rftenMl gSVrisons, but
brigade and diVisfon 'garrisons.
For a Big Navy.
Our navy must, relatively to the navies
of other nations, always We of greater size
than our arilfy. We ha\ most wisely con
tinued for a number df years to build up
our navy, and it htts riqy reached a fairly
hlgli standard of efficiency. XKia stand
ard of et0.cl.6ncy must r^QjC only be main-
be increas'ea beyond the prese-nt.^ram,ber of
units. What is no$v clearly neaeSriary is to
substitute efficient for' fnefffclent units as
the latter become worn oilt 5t as.it be
comes apparent that they are useless.
Probably the result would be attained by
adding a single battle ship to our navy
each year, the superseded or outworn ves
sels being laid up or broken up a3 they are
thus replaced.
Publio Land Laws.
One again I call your attention to the
condition of the public land laws. Recent
developments have given new urgency to
the need far such changes wilj (it these
laws to actual present condition's., The
honest disposal and right use of the re
maining public lan,d» is of fundamental im
portance. The iniquitous methods by
which the monopolizing of the public lands
Is being brouglht about under the present
laws are becoming toore generally known,
but the existing laWs do not furnish
effective remedies. The recommendations
of the public lkftds commission upon this
subject aria wise and Bhould be given
effect.
As to the Grazing Land Claim.
The greater part of the remaining public
lands cannot oe irrigated. They are at
present and will probably always be of
greater value for grazing than for any
other purpose. This fact has led to the
grazing homestead of 640 acres in Ne
braska and to the proposed extension of it
to other states. It is argued that a family
cah not be supported on 160 acres of arid
grazing land. This is obviously true but
neither can a family be supported on 640
acres of much of the land to which it is
proposed to apply the grazing homestead.
To establish universally any such arbitrary
limit would be unwise at the present time.
It would probably result on the one hand
In enlarging the holdings of some of the
great land owners, and on the other in
needless suffering and failure on the part
of a very considerable proportion of the
bona fide settlers who give faith to the im
plied assurance of the government that
such an area is sufficient.
The best use of the public grazing lands
requires the careful examinationandclass
Ifica'tion of these lands in ord£r to BfVfi
each settler land enough to support ms
family and no more. While this work is
being done, and until the lands are set
tled, the government should take cbntbol
of the open range, under reasoadtfte regu
lations suited to loca'l needs, following the
general policy already in successful opera
tion on the forest reserves. It is probable
that the present grazing value of the open
public range is scarcely more than half
what It once was or what It might easily
be again under careful regulation.
Favors Merchant Marine.
To the spread of our trade In peace and
the defense of our flag In war a great and
prosperous merchant marine is indispensi
ble. We should have ships of our own and
seamen of our own to convey our goods to
neutral markets, and In case of need to
reenforce our battle line. It can not but
be a source of regret and uneasiness to us
that the lines of communication with our
sister republics of South America should
be chiefly under foreign control. It Js not
a good thing that' American merchants
and manufacturers should havo to send
their goods and letters to South America
via Europe If they wish security and dis
patch. Even on the Pacific, where our
ships have held their own better than on
the Atlantic, our merchant flag is now
threatened through the liberal aid be
stowed by other governments on their own
steam lines. I ask your earnest consider
ation of the report with which the Mer
chant Marine commission has 'followed its
long and careful inquiry.
The Immigration Question.
The question of Immigration Is of vital
interest to this country. Ih the year end
ing June 30, 1906, there came to the United
States 1,026,000 alien immigrants. In Other
words. In the single year that has just
elapsed there came to this country a
greater number of people than came here
during the one hundred and sixty-nine
years of our colonial life which inter
vened between the first landing at James
town and the Declaration of Independ
ence. It is clearly shown in the report of
the commissioner- general of Immigration
that while much of this enormous immi
gration is undoubtedly healthy and natur
al, a considerable proportion is undesirable
from one reason or another moreover, a
considerable proportion of it, probably a
very large proportion. Including most of
the undesirable class, does not come here
ot its own initiative,, but because of the
activity of the agents of the great trans
portation companies. These agents are
distributed throughout Europe, and by the
offer of all kinds of Inducements they
wheedle and cajole many Immigrants, often
against their best interest, to cohie here.
The Chinese Question.
The questions arising in connection
with Chinese immigration stand by them
selves. The cdrtdftlons in China are such
that the entire Chinese coolie class, that
is, the class of Chinese.-.laborers, skilled
and unskilled, legitimately cpme under
the bead of undesirable immigrants to
this .country, because Of their numbers,
the low wages for Whi61i they work, and
their low standard Of "living. Not only Is
it to the Interest of this country to keep
them out, but the Chinese authorities do
not desire that they should be admitted.
At. present their entrance .is prohibited
\by lows amply adequate to accomplish,
this purpose. These ,iaws have been, are
being, .and.will be, thoroughly enforced.
The "yifiltttlons Of them ?are so Sew In"
number as to be infinitesimal andfban be
ihtlreiy disregarded.

FOod Law.
I recommendxlhat a4 lawv:be enacted .to
regulate Interstate commerce In mlibruU-
ve-
ed and adulterated foods, drinks, and!
drugs. Such law would protect legiti
mate manufacture and commerce, and
would tend to secure the health and wel
fare of the consuming public. Traffic In
foodstuffs which havo been debased or
adulterated so as to Injure health or to de
ceive purchasers should be forbidden.
The Indian Question.
During tho year just past, the pit&se of
the Indian question which has been most
sharply brought to public attention is the
larger legal significance of the Indian's
induction Into citizenship. This has made
Itself manifest not only in a great excess
of litigation In which the citizen Indian
figures As a party defendant and In a more
widespread disposition to levy local taxa
tion upon his personality, but in a decision
of the "United States supreme court which
struck away the main prop on which has
hitherto rested the government's benevo
lent effort to protect him against the evils
of Intemperance. The court holds, In ef
fect, that when an Indian becomes, hy
virtue of an allotment of land to him, a
citizen of the state In which, his land is sit
uated, he passes from under federal con
trol in such matters as this, and the acts
of the congress prohibiting tho sale or
gift to him of Intoxicants become substan
tlalJyMnoperative. It Is gratifying to note
that the states and municipalities of the
west which have most at stake In the wel
fare of the Indians are taking up this sub
ject and are trying to supply. In a measure
at least, the abdication of Its trusteeship
forced upon the federal government.
Nevertheless, I would urgently press
upon the attention of the congress the
question whether some amendment of the
Internal revenue laws might not be of aid
in prosecuting those malefactors, known
in the Indian country at "bootleggers,"
who arc engaged at onco in defrauding tho
United States treasury of taxes and, what
is far more Important, In debauching the
Indians by carrying liquors illicitly into
territory still completely under federal
jurisdiction.
Among the crying present needs of the
Indians are more day schools situated in
the midst of their settlements, more ef
fective instruction in the industries pur
sued on their own farms, and a more lib
eral extension of the field-matron service,
which means the education of the Indian
women in the arts of home making.
The Philippines.
During the last year the Philippine
islatMg nave been slowly recovering from
tho scries of disasters which, since Amer
ican occupation, hav"e greatly reduced the
am&Uni of agricultural products below
what was produced in Spanish times. The
waV, the rinderpest, the locusts, the
d-ro"ught, and the cholera havo been unit
ed as causes to prevent a return of the
of the di-aft cattle, because it will take
several years of breeding to restore tho
necessary number of these indispensable
aids to agriculture.
Would Reduce Tariff.
The agricultural conditions of the
islands enforce more stronaiy than ever
the argument in favor of reducing the
tariff on the products of the Philippine
islands entering the United Stares. I
earnestly recommend that the tariff now
imposed by the Dingley bill upon the
products of the Philippine Islands be
entirely removed, excep't the tariff on
sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff
be reduced to 25 per cent, of the present
rates under the Dingley act that after
July 1, 1909, the tariff upon tobacco and
sugar produced In the Philippine Islands
be entirely removed, and that free trade
between the islands and the United States
In the products of each country then be
provided for by law.
A statute in force, enacted April 15.
1904, suspends the operation of the coast
Wise laws of the United' States upon the
tr&d0 between the Philippine islands and
tha United States until' July. 1, 1906. I
earnestly recommend that this suspen
sion be postponed until July 1, 1909.
Would Fortify Hawaii.
In my judgment immediate steps should
be taken for the fortification of Hawaii.
This is the most important point In the
Pacific to fortify in order to conserve
the interests of this country. It would
be hard to overstate tho Importance of
this need. Hawaii Is too heavily taxed.
Laws should be enacted setting aside
for a period of, say, twenty years 75
per cent, of the Internal revenue and
customs receipts from Hawaii as a spe
cial fund to be expended in tho islands
for educational and public buildings, and
for harbor improvements and military
and naval defenses. It cannot be too
often repeated that our aim must be to
develop the territory of Hawaii on tra
ditional American lines.
Citizenship for Porto Ricans.
I earnestly advocate the adoption of
legislation which" will explicitly confer
Amerlca'n cltfisenship on all citizens of
Porto Rico. There is, in my judgment,
no excuse for failure to do this. The
harbor of San Juan should be dredged
and improved. The expenses of the fed
eral court of Porto Rico should be met
from the federal treasury, and not from
the Porto Rican treasury. The elections
In .Porto Rico should take place every
four years, and the legislative should
meet in session every two years. The
S:lep,
resent form of government in Porto
which'provides for the appointment
by the president of the members of the
executive council or upper house of the
legislature, has proved satlafiictory and
has inspired confidence in property own
ers and investors. I do nottdeem It ad
visable at the present tliiie to change
thip form In any material feature. The
problems and needs of tho Island are In
dustrial and commercial rather than po
litical VK$.
Needs qf Alaska.
I earnestly ask that Alaska be given
an elective delegate. Spnfe 'person should
be chosen who can speak with authojrlty
of the needs of the territory. The gov
ernment should aid in the construction
of a railroad from the gulf of Alaska to
the Yukon river, in American territory.
In my last two messages I. advocated
certain additional action on behalf of
Alaska. I shall not now repeat those
recommendations, but I shall lay all my
stress upon the one recommendation of
giving to Alaska some one authorized to
speak for It. I should prefer that the
delegate was made elective, but If this
is not deemed wise then make him ap
pointive.
The Panama Canal.
The treaty between the^Unlted States
and the republic pf Panama, 'under which
the construction of the Betnama canal was
made possible, went Into effect Wlj,h Its
ratification by the United States senate on
•February 23, 1904. The canal properties of
the French' Canal company were trans
ferred to the united States on April 23,
1904, on payment of $40,000,000 to that com
pany. On April 1. 1905, tho commftalon
was reorganized, and It now conslln of
Theodore P. 'Shouts, chairman. Chides E.
Magoon, Bedjamln M. Harrod, Reax-Ad
mIral"Mordecal T. Endicatt, Brig-idter Ueh
eral Peter C. Hatns, and Colonel Oswald
H. Ernst. John F. Stevens was appointed
chief engineer on July 1 last. Active work
In canal construction, mainly, preparatory,
has been in progress for less than a year
and a half. During that period two points
about the canal have ceased' to be ogen to
debate. First, the question of route tbe
canal will be built on tire Isthmus of
Panama. Second, the question of feasibil
ity there are no physical obstacles on this
route that American engineering skill u^ll
not be able to overcome without serious
difficulty, or that will prevent' the coihp'Ie
tlon of .the canal within a reasonable time
and at ia reasonable cost. This Is virtually
the unanimous testimony of the engineers
who have investigated the matter fbr the
government.
Must Build It Rapidly.
The American people Is pledged to the
speediest possible construction ot awca^nal
adequate to meet the demands ijrtilch the
commerce of the world wHl tqake upon
It, and 1 appeal most earnestly to the con
gress to aid in the fuWulmJent "of the
pledge. Gratifying progress has been
made during the past year and especially
duMng the past four mouths.
What is needed now and without delay Is
an appropriation by the congp-ess to meet
the current and Accruing expenses qf the
commission. The first aptfroprlaitqn of
$10,000,000, out of the $135,009/100 authoclced
by the Spooner act, was made tbre$ years
ago. It .is nearly exhausted, ftbere is

Washington, D. C., Dec. 5.—H, R.
Wright of Des Moines, a negro, was
today nominated for consul at Util
la, Honduras.
South Dakotans were appointed
consuls as follows: Gabriel B'.e
Ravndahl at Dawson City 15. E.

Iowa postmasters were nominated
as follows: G. W. Latler, Man
ning T. D. Purcsll, Hampton 1. A.
Maine, Charter Oak A. S. Burnett,
Valley Junction.
Washington, Dec. 7.—The greatest^
news of the session thus far is the an-j
nouncement made today that opposi
tion to the railroad rate bill has been
withdrawn. Senator Gorman has told
its supporters that he is with the bill,
this ending democratic opposition in'
the senate. The republican senators)
who have opposed the bill have agreed!
to support it in consideration of certain"
changes which would simplify it. These-,
changes will eliminate the provision ot":
special methods of appealing to the!
courts and may also do away with tha
specific provision of power to fix maxi-t
.mum and minimum rates. The power,,
however, to declare an existing rate
unjust and to fix and enforce a new onei
will be given in strong terms.
This is considered not only the essen
tial of the measure, but as much .as can
safely be given without danger of un
constitutionality. It is now expected
the bill will pass the senate after the.
holidays.
For Tuberculosis Sanitarium.
Washington, Dec. 7.—When the houst.
met at noon today there was a full!
atten lance of members and the gal
leries were comfortably filled in an
ticipation of the reading of the mes
sage of President Rooseveit.
An appropriation of $100,000 for a na
tional tuberculosis sanitarium is pro
vided for in a bill introduced by Rep-i
resentative Wiley of Alabama today.
Representative Hepburn (Iowa) at
the conclusion of'the reading of the
president's message, asked unanimous
consent of the house for consideration
of the emergency Panama canal appro
priation bill tomorrow. This program
has been agreed upon by republican
leaders.
Formally Appoints Cabinet.
The president today sent the follow
lng nominations to the senate:
Secretary of State—Elihu Root.
Secretary of Navy—Charles Joseph
Bonaparte.
Interstate Commerce Commissioner—
Franklin Lane, California.
In addition to these, all the recess
appointments made since the senate!
adjourned last March were sent to tho
senate.
New Merchant Marine Bill,
Washington, D. C., Dec. 5.—The mer-':
•chant marine commission, consisting
of members appointed by tho senate
and the house, were called together
after the adjournment of congress yes
terday and the bill submitted in the
last session was revised for reintroduc
tion in both bodies on Wednesday.
Two entirely new features were incor
porated in the bill. As it now stands it
carries an increased mail subvention
to the oceanic line from San Francisco
to the Hawaiian islands, Samoa and
Australia of $217,000 a year above the
$230,000 now received by this line under
the postal aid law of 1891.
The commission also adapted a pro-|
vision increasing by $250,000 the com
pensation received by the American line
from New York to Southampton, giv
ing this line for its twenty knot ser
vice a maximum of $1,000,0000 to offset
the new British subvention of $1,100,000
given to the Cunard Steamship com
pany.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 5.—A largei
number of bills and joint resolutions!
were introduced in the house yesterdayJ
They cover a large variety of subjects!}
including Philippine tariff, statehood)
pensions, regulation of the hours ofi
employment in the executive depart-'
ments, merchant marine, increase ofi
salaries of the vice president and mem
bers of the cabinet requiring corpora
tions to make reports of their affairs
to the commissioner of corporations
increasing the powers of the Interstate
Commerce commission investigating,
of campaign funds, of expenditures on'
the Panama canal, of insurance com-'
panies doing an interstate business^
of cotton reports, and of the condition
of the child labor provision for a
six-year term for the president andl
the election of senators by direct vote
of the people.
Admission of Oklahoma and Indian.
Territory as one state was the sub-i
ject of the first bill introduced in the
house. The bill was prepared by Mr.
McQulre, of Oklahoma, and is almost!
identical with the joint statehood bill ofi
the last session.
Mr. Payne, of New Tork, introduced!
a Philippine tariff bill to provide tern-!
porarlly for the revenues of the islands.1
The bill stipulated that all products
grown or manufactured exclusively in'
the islands are to be admitted to thei
United States duty free excepting to-i
bacco and sugar, which are to pay 25!
per cent, of the regular duty on thelri
products. The present duty charges of
such products when they leave the isl-i
ands is to be deducted from the amount!
levied on them when admitted to thisi
country.
Mr. Robinson, of Arkansas, Intro
duced three joint resolutions providlngl
for the investigation of campaign'
funds expenditures on the Panama!
canal and insurance companies having
an interstate business.
The campaign fund resolution pro-
vides for a special commission of fjf
teen members of the house and five
senators and stipulates that campaign
funds be investigated for the years
1892, 1896, 1900 and 1904.
