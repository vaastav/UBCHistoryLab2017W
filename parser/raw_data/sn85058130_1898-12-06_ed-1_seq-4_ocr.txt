THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
The presIdents mesage is a dIsap
poIntment Not because of any unex
pected policy outlined thereIn for It
contains a little of almost everything
else But because of itS remarkable
silence en the queStion of foreIgn policy
at a time when suggestions are In order I
and recommendations are needed
I
TIle message If a chronologIcal reca
pitulatIon of the events ot a year added
to a composite report of depErtment
rctarles may be called a message
contaIns nothIng that has not appeared
alrepdy in the daily pres
For sIx months the newsboys of
America have been crying the accbunts
upon which the president dwells at
great length and the newspapers have
told and retold lS news and mlscel
lany time and again the stories that
constitute the bulk of this anxiously
expected document
There isnt a section of anything
new or original or Instructive It
Would be an interesting narrative had
it not been so recently and so frequent
ly told As it reads It is chIefly val
uable for showing what portion of the
war dIspatches the commanderInchIef
of the Llmy and navy chose to believe
It Is more of a review than a mes
sage It might have been compiled
a from the files of any leadIng dally
newspaper They nearly all printed bet
ter and more complete accounts of the
war more extensive reports from the
various departments more suggestions
even In their news columns than the
president has permItted to creep into
his own
He calls the attention of congress
to a number of matters but there he
leaves congress with its attention fixed
He ratifies the suggestions of cabInet
officials In regard to the next census
the Increase of the LIJ1Y md nan the
present monetary system He leaves
congress to guess his wishes concerning
Cuba Puerto Rico and the PhilippInes
The recent labor rIots are dIscussed In
IL perfunctory way Considerable at
tention Is paid to aquarrel between Ar
gentine and Chili to something done b30
Peru to the BruSsels exposition to
Central AmerIcan revolutions and the
failure of the states to secure a federa
tion to Samoa Siam Hawaii and Ja
pan
He follows the BrItIsh lion into the
China seas dwells for a tIme at WeI
HaiWei Ta Lien Wan and Tlen Tsln
and then he makes a long explanation
of the Cerruti arbitration whatever
that may be drifts Into the forest re
servaUtn vIews the fires wIth regret
talks about sugar celebrations and
sundries until it gets too late to say
anythIng about the war investigation
the health of the army the need of a
tariff that will furnIsh revenues the
best way to govern the PhilippInes the
policy to be pursued with reference to
Cuba or any of the things that con
gress requIred to hear about and that
the people very properly expected to
hear about
On all the other sUbjects however he
gives the people theIr fill
Not until he reaches the last para
graph where he finds that his recom
mendations have been mislald does
PresIdent McKinley play balL He rec
oIlmends to congress a reading of the
reports of the different departments
whh he says discuss many ques
tions upon which the congress may be
called to act
As a rehash of current events it is
fall as a message it Is one of the most
uncertaIn vacillating and unsatisfac
tory thrt ever emanated from the pen
If a candidate for reelection
UNWARRANTED OPPOSITION
An evening contemporary attempts
to explain why there is an opposition
ticket In the Second precinct for the
CmlnL school election But it Is one
of those explanations which do not ex
plain
No objection Is raised to M H
Walker who was regular nominated
It Is not claImed that he is In any way
an improper man for the place No
one thinks hIm undeserving Against
11im lS n man as a publicspIrited
citizen as a taxpayer as a weUqual
jfled applicant for a membership on
the board of education not one word
bas been whIspered even so far as it
has been possible to determine
Mr Walker netids no defense for he
bas not been attacked he needs no
eulogy for no resident perhaps is bet
ter known
But whY was another candidate
placed in the race against Mr Walker
No one IIIlS gIven n sound reason for
thiS action up to date 1t is a pU r11e
eXcuse to fay that Mr Walker is op
posed becaUse the precInct convention
was held during the week of n Sunday
schoOl conference or that Mr Walkers
candidacy Is objected to because the
convention met In UnIty han instead of
the sIxth Yard m tinghouse
The people of the ecand precInct
ohould see to It that Mr Wallier re
I
I calves a majority of the votes cast to
morrow and those who oppose him
should never open theIr mouths again
In favor of a nonpartisan ca1npalgn
for anything There IS no partisan
ship so bItter as that whIch Character
Izes a fight where the differences are

THE NATIONS DEFICIT
In hIs message the presIdent calls attention
ntion to the unsatisfactory condItion
of the nations finances The statements I
are substantially the same as those In
yestordays Herald I
The deficit Is greater than anyone I
had anticIpated From the estimate
furnished by the presIdent the govern
ment will have a shortage five times as
heavy as Secretary Gage thought It
would be
They blame the war but extra funds
for war P urposs have Jbeen raised
enough to pay the expenses of the war
and millions besIdes
The mesaequotes from the treas
ury ports that the receIpts of the
government from all sources durIng the
fiscal year ending June 30 1898
amounted to 05321335 and its ex
pendltures to H33GS582
I He admits a decrease of revenues un I
der the DIngley tariff when he poInts
out that there was a decrease of 58
156690 In dutiable imports In one year I
At the same time there was an increase
of 24212068 in the internal revenue re I
celpts But all this was before the en i
actment of tile war revenue law It was
for the year ending June 30 iSIS
Of thIs year the messags says It is
estImated uOn the basIs of present
revenue laws the receipts of the gov i
ern111ent for the year ending June 30 i
1899 will be 577S746O7 and its experid
1
Itures 68987464 resulting in n dell
clen y of 112000000 I
Admitting thIs estimate tCJ be correct
and taking the customs receipts for last
year nsa baSis for calculation sum I
td ie dethed from internal revenues
wll1be ever 40O0OO0Oi I
Last year without the aid of specIal
taxes the Internal revenues amounted
to O900641 the president says If
this qmount were collected under the
peace schedule It may be deducted
I
from the amount collected as internal
revenues for the current year leaving
230000000 approximately the sum I
raised by thespeciillwar tat levy
The ouisklh cost bt the war is paced
at lI50O0O This shows 5OOOOoo
of a surplus in the war fund There
fore it cannot be truly said that the
expenses of the war have caured the I
I deficit the presIdent has figured out
There Is a leak somewhere that con
gress should make an effort to discover
and stop
When RepublIcans are ready to admit
that the DIngley bIll is a failure and
that the kind of protection it repre I
sents is a fraud when they are willIng I
to revise the tariff and enact a law for I
revenue purposes there wIll be a 1
chance to do away with these deficIts
that grow in spite of the continuation I
of war taxes in time Qf peace

HIS EAR TO THE GROUND
From the annual report of Comp
troUer Dawes pUblIshed yesterday It
would seem that President McKinley
is dIsposed to shirk hIs part of the
responsIbIlIty for currency reform and
the preslants message published this
morning confirms that Impression
The president is not a man of orIg
Inality or decision He Is therefore
very unlike his predecessor In charac
ter however sImIlar may be theIr
financial vIews I
President McKinley always h3 l1i5
ear to the ground So many wires
have bteit laid In and about the capital
that he frequently hears from Wall
street what he takes to be the voice
of the people but now and then some
breathless courIer like Grosvenor or
Allison rushes In with a warnIng as to
the murmurings and real sentiments
of the masses Always counting on a
reelection desirous of keeping the
good will of the money brokers and
I the friendshIp of the people the presi
dent would like to be relieved of any
responsIbIlIty in the currency re
form movement He has already
recommended It in hIs special message
of July 24 1897 and that ought to sat
Isfy the currency reformers without his
being compelled to reaffirm hIs en
dorsement
Comptroller Dawes Is evidently set
apart to perform the functions of me
diator between the president and the
people nhlle Secretary Gage who oc
cupIes the post of honor in the adminis
tration may be relIed upon to keep
the administration on the financial
track laId by the bankers at theIr
currency reform conventions
It 15 weB understood that Mr Dawes
is a close personal frIend of the presi
dent and that undoubtedly his report
was read by the presIdent before it
was put Into print and the assumption
Is that there was no executive disap
proval of the ground whIch Mr Dawes
assumed
I
But hIs posItion whIch on Its face
is unfriendlY to currency reform leg
Islation is diametrically opposed to
the views of the secretary of the treas
I
ury which IndIcates that the admIn
Istration is beginnIng to practice up
already for Its campaIgn specIalty of
riding the opposIte direction horses In
1900The
The comptroller is besIeged with tele
grams and letters from aU over the
country It is said some of which com
mend hIs views while others deprecate
the idea of postponIng currencY re
form aday longer than is absolutely
necessary
There may be a fight after all on
this proposItion sInce RepublIcans
evInce a SlIght fedr of makIng it an
ImmedIate subject for change But the
friends of theCurrency bill do not in
tend to remain inactive They wlll
plead their case before the leaders of
the RepublIcan party In congress a
majorIty of whom according to Chair
man Hanna of the reform commIs
sion are already pledged to Its sup
port Thereis every reason to believe
that a determined effort will be made
In the early weeks alter the ass m
bUng of congress to brIng the leaders
of the party to a realIzation of the
forces behind theIr national organiza
tIon The New York Press forecast
Ing the report and the poliCY contem
plated thCreI says that regardless of
Mr Dawes the campaign for currency
reform vfll be earnestly pushedl Many
influential members of the house and
some senator are known to hold the
pplnlo that it is the part of party
polIcy as well as party hone at
least totattempt some amendments Rf
the currency laWs theneces 4OZi
which was dUlitted not a long time
t
ago by the men who 1101 are opposing
It
ThIs Is understood to be a dlrct hInt
to the president that his specIal mes
sage on the matter Isnot forgotten
In some official quarters says the
Press the opInIon Is ventured that
1Ir D wes declaration against the
wIsdom of attempting currency reform
at this time will be carefully studIed
in its results by those n authority
be plain that the position announced
by Mr Dawes Is in the nature of a
feeler to test publIc sentiment on the
subject
Which Is another way of saying that
the presIdent has one ear on the
ground He should have a care lest
Chahman Hanna steps on that ear

AN INCOMPETENT TREATY
A correspondent writes from Ogden
requ stIng ati ldcotint of the Clayton
Bulwer treaty concernIng whIch there
has been some discussIon in the press
of the colmtry recently
The ClaytonBulwer treaty was nego
tiated In April 1850 for thc purpose of
preventing further dissensIons on the
subject of 5roposed canals and rail
ways across the AmerIcan isthmus In
considerIng the NIcaragua project
whIch is almost sure to be xiushed to
an actual beginning by the present con
gress tIle terms of the ClaytonBulwer
agreement of a half century ago are
now beIng practically reviewed and
aJDUed for the first tithe
Secretary of State Clayton represent
ed the United states and SIr Edward
Bulwer acted for Great BrItaIn The
Monroe doctrIne was Involved owing
to the fact that England although be
ing possessed of BaUze or British Hon
duras since 1183 had but recently ac
quIred a protectorate over the Mos
quito coast and over the Bay ISlands
a grouD located not far from Hon
duras
The dIscussIon continued for several
years GreatBrltaln finally yield
ed1 The BiyJIslands were sCrreiidered
and Nicaragua obtaIned a treaty from
the BrItish government yIeldIng aU
claIm to the MosquIto coast
ThIs ended Ute controversy to all In
tents and purposes In 1860 the secre
tary of state consented to Englands
continued occupation of BaUze and the
president itanounced that all disoutes
under the treaty had been satlsfac
torily settled
No further attention was paid to the
matter untll1881 when Mr Blaine
wrote to 1Iinlster Lowell at London
urgIng the abrogation of the treaty On
the round that it had been formed
thIrty years before and that the cIr
cumstances governIng its formation
had ceased to exIst
The questloniremalns open however
ld the CaytonBuher treaty may
yet be called In as an authority before
the proposed waterway Is completed
REALIGNMENT OF PARTIES
Senator Shoup Is convinced that po
utica contests In the western states
henceforth wIll be on the issues joined
In the national platforms of the two
great parties Populism will cease to
be a factor he thinks just as a lead
Ing Populist of Utah has saId
Every indlctlon says Senator
Shoup in an intervIew prInted In a lIe
publican organ points to realIgnment
pn Republican and Democratic Unes
Side shows will cease to cut any figure
I In > future contests andvoters wIll rallY
under the old party standards The
election In Idaho indicates this tenden
cy There Is a most sIgnIficant In
crease In the number of Republicans in
the legIslature
That realignment has already been
effected in Utah Except In Weber
county the Republicans united In an
endorsement Of the adminIstration and
the support of administration men for
the state offices
The financIal question Is the dIvIding
line Gold Democrats are joIning the
Republican party and silver Repub
licans are joInIng the Democratic
party
The tarIff Issue Is losing itself among
the newly acquIred islands The open
door policy of the adminIstration Is a
long strIde towards a tariff for reve I I
nue only Territorial expansion and
the protective tariff idea are Incom
patible The next campaIgn wIll be
fought on the free coInage Issue
Factions and thIrd parties wIll cut a
very small figure
No one believes for a moment that I
11 H Walker or any other nomInee of
the regular city school conventions
would discrIminate against the em
ployin 1t of Utah people as teachers
In the public schools Any Intimation
to the contrary is unwarranted

MARRIAGE NIRELAND
Shrovetide the Great Nuptial Season
Parents Arrange the Matches
Macmillans Magazine
The great marriage time In Ireland Is
Shrovetide DurIng the forty days or
lent the IrIsh peasantry In obedIence to
the ordinance of the church abstain
from matrimony as well as from eggs
butter and milk Some time before the
approach of that holy season a farmer
with a marriageable son or daughter
wltl
whom he desires to see settled tells his
frIends and neighbors of the fact He
usually conveys the intelligence In an
Indirect offhand manner He meets a

But mind you i00littie Johnny Is very
particular The boy do be syln what a

The subject having thus been broached
the parents discuss It whenever they meet
and it often happens that a lonr time
elapses and many a discussIon and
wrangle takes place before the termeare
finally settled Thefaria hneei fXs goes
wIth the male and the great difficulty In
the arranging of matches 15 the fixing or

sistble
impressionable heart and a deludherng
tongue to render It always necessary
that the parents should make the bar
gain
The youthful couple meet at dances or
on Sunday after massven a wake Is
turned to account for a little courting
