Students of finance will not hesitate to
admit that unreasonable nervousness as
to credit often precipitates that which is
most foured Credit is the sensitive
plant in money dealing and shrinks at
n breath even more rapidly than does
the mimosa at the touch of human hands
Monoy does not vanish In seasons of
pauiu it is material and must occupy
space it is therefore in financial crises
only withdrawn from circulation and
carefully stored in safe places until that
which Is called confidence is regained
To maintain credit publio and in
dividual Is sound financial policy and a
common croaker is a publio enemy who
deserves to bo so branded A hairs
weight determines the balance In mint
scales end a breath turns the tide of
monetarv affairs
At this juncture there is an oppor
tunity for an exhibit of selfishness that
is so enlightened a form as almost to
merit the term generosity This is the
time for creditors to be patient the
money is in the country as business
men of foresight will not ally themselves
with any movement that lends itself to
speculation upon or a continuance of the
state of depression that is temporary
unless so fostered Tho attitude of the
best banks and of men who have invested
largely in stocks is such as to warrant
the assertion that there Is no reasonable
ground for feor solvency and soundess
in large monetary centers Is apparent
A selfishness that would blindly urge
creditors to forcg their demands will not
only extend the time of the panlo but
enlarge its circle and bring ruin upon

Iireckmridge on Monday drove a good
dized nail In the collin of Rackensack
Republicanism
themselves because of Inability on the
part of debtors to meet at once obliga
tions that a little time would make easy
The trdp has ebbed and it would be
the wildest folly to check its re
turnlns flow Already in tho large
cities there is restoration of confidence
and a revival of trade that should have a
favorable effect upon business in towns
remote from these centers Now is the
time for the business men of this city to
stand by eaoh other and not harass
debtors or depreciate the credit of in
dividuals nor moneyed institutions
Good fellowship and good feelinc will
tide over any breakers that threaten
and the solid men of Fort Worth owe it
to themselves and this city that busines8
credit here is not impaired by undue
haste in forcing collections nor by per
mitting statements imperiling the finan
cial standing of tho city or of th busi
ness men to pass unchallenged
THE SPOILS SYSTEM
From now on we may expect to find
that Republican enthusiasm for civil ser
vice reform will gain such headway that
when the next national convention of
that party shall be held the patriots wil1
bo in the proper frame of mind to give it
the most sweeping indorsement just as
they did In 18SS when they pledged the
party to a faithful and honest execution
of it The sweeping indorsement of 1S88
has been faithfully carried out in that
all or nearlv all Democrats found la
the service have been swept out for
better material Such was the pur
port and meaning attached by Republi
cans to a sweeping indorsement Great
virtue was supposed to reside in it aud
much good of a political oharaoter was
expected from tho sweeping execution
that followed the sweeping indorsement
of the law Rut Republican hopes and
expectations were oruolly blasted nnd
disappointed nt tho election of Novem
ber 4 There was scaroely an election
distriot between the Atlantio and the
Rooky mountains iu which the spoils
system added a single vote to the partys
strength Nay more there wasscarcoly
a single distriot in which it prevented a
fall ng off of from tens to thousands of
votes With full command of all the offices
and patronngo which had been carefully
disposed of in a way to do the most
good the party sustained the most
crushing defeat overy visited upon any
party since the foundation of tho gov
ernment The result of that election
has done more to discount the value of
the spoils system as a reliable political
faotor in determining election results
than anything else that may be
thought of
In 18SS whou the Republicans wore
empty handed so far ns spoils went
they won over the Democrats who con
trolled largely the offices Uoth parties
have had similar experiences in this
line Roth have found that no great
weight is to be attached to a control of
the offices when nn election is at hand
All the federal officials at Indianapolis
could not for example prevent that
city from going Democratio at tho re
cent election very much to the chagrin
of Dr Harrison who used all the
patronage at his command to insure a
different result To infer from tho fore
going that the spoils system is wicked or
vicious would bo n jumping at con
clusions Because it cannot determine
lho result of an election and givo tho
party in power un undue ndvantage over
its adversary is no sufficient reason
for lis abolition On the contrary
it is a very dlsticot argument
in fnvor of its retention If the ob
ject sought in giving each administra
tion the right of appointment to all
Federal offices was tho control in it3
favor of subsequent elections and that
control was found to te no control at
all as the Republicans have just found
it would be in order to cry out away
with it Rut as everyone knows
that is not nt all the object nor any
thing like it It is that each admin
istration may have a olerical force in
political sympathy with itself upon
whioh it may rely to havo its policy
aud all measures in pursuance thereof
carried out faithfully and honestly
The Republicans having control o
tho ofTioes can very well nfford to ef
fervesce over the beauties or civil service
reform and bemoan with a profusion
ot crooodile tears their own folly in
kicking it out of their way as some of
them are already doing Their tears
will havo no effect whatever on the
Demoorat whoever he may bo elected
to tho presidency two years hence
They may count on that to a dead
mornl certainty
THE MESSAGE A WINDFALL TO
DEMOCRATS
Democrats have cause to thank Heaven
for Ilarrlson Ho Is the Mrs OSnea of
tho Republican party His message to
congress is almost as welcome a windfall
to the Democrats as the transAtlantio
liaison lately the subject of worldwide
gossip was to the English Tories The
president is said to be headstrong
and obstinate His message is proof
enough that he is Obstinacy hardly
expresses it Mulishness comes nearer
tho mark A year ago he said the
horse was sixteen feet highand ho sticks
to it It that is not mulishness what is
it Think of the recent election and
find if you can a milder form of ex
pression for the spirit that prompted
this high tariff force bill messace
The whole world with the exception
of the protected barons and their friends
agreed that the MoKinley bill and the
force bill caused the popular upheaval of
November 4 Other things as for ex
ample Reedlsm wasteful expenditures
and a general spirit ot proflicaoy in leg
islation contributed a share Rut those
two leading measures were the prime
factors that caused the universal popular
revulsion against Republicanism The
i tjt dU Tt J j a ai aafy ttjf a tjLaaA
result was a sweeping condemnation of
both measures And now in the face
of that great popular verdict comes the
president with a reIndorsement and a
resh recommendation of both He even
turns advocate andarguej with foreign
economists and others to prove to t hem
that the MoKinley tariff is a ulessins
to American industries and American
workingnien They are given to un
derstand that in spite of their rejoicing
over it the law can be of no benefit to
them since it discriminates against
where it dees not actually ex
clude their wares and goods lrom
this market Then to show what a
magnificent contempt ho has for con
sistency he points out the apparent fact
that under the operations of the bill
importatlous have increased rather than
fallen off
Not the leas important feature of
the message is its indorsement of Mr
Blaines reciprocity nostrum But for
the imperative need of something to be
guile the farmers and furnish a counter
irritant for their tariff objections
nothing would induce the president to
adopt Blaines reciprocity foundling
which he dandles before the people as
infant kings are sometimes done to llro
tho patriotlo heart and enthuse the
thoughtless multitude He was in
duoed last summer to recommend It to
congress and now that it is n part ot
tho law employs it as an argument for
ship subsidies without which he consid
ers it practically valueless
The silver question is touched upon so
far as to express a hope for a safe in
ternational agreement for the free use
of silver as a com metal This is the
nearest approach made in the message
to an unqualified indorsement of the
double standard and the free use of sil
ver ns money It is probable that if the
present congress should send him a free
coinage bill he would sigu it
The recommendation ou which he lays
special stress is an efficient election law
that will prevent fraud and injustice
and protect majorities In other
words he is body and soul for the en
actment of the force bill If enacted
into a law he can see iu it a gain of
twentyfivo or thirty Republican con
gressmen at the South but cannot seo
the inevitable loss whioh his party would
as certainly sustain in the North to say
nothing of the social commercial and
race disturbances that would ensue To
these things Harrison is blind On
this subject he is a true Bourbon
learning nothing and forgetting nothing
He is entirely dominated by partisan
rancor and is hopelessly wedded to his
hideous idol For that reasou Blaine
oven could not movo him an inch from
his unholy ground
As congress refused a fow months ago
to pass that Dili at his dictation it will
probably do so acain The South is not
calling for it neither is the West or
North Nobody wants it but the radi
cals greedy for power at any cost As
they do not control the senato the un
holy scheme of trying to pass it will end
ingloriously once more and the rank
idiocy of the president in insisting upon
it will become patent to the world as
it is now to the Amerlan publio

Columisia S C Deo 4 Governor
elect Tillman was inaugurated today
in front of the state house at 10 oclock
in tho presence of a large crowd from all
parts of the state who arrived last night
and this morning on special trains
In his inaugural address he roferred
with pleasure to the national viotory of
the Democratic party and in regard to
the eleotion in his own state said In
our own state of South Carolina the tri
umph of Deinocrioy and white suprem
acy over mongrelistn and nnarchism
and of civilization over barbarism has
jeeu most complete and it is gratifying
to note the fact that this was attended
by a political phenomenon iu which it
was a surprise to all ot us Our colored
fellow citizens absolutely refused to be
led to tho polls by their bosses The
opportunity of having their votes freely
cast and honestly counted which it has
been claimed Is denied the negroes
caused a ripple of exoitement aud the
consequence is that today there
is loss prejudice and more kindly
feeling between the white and black men
In South Carolina than has existed at
any time since 18CS wheu it is clenrly
shown that a majority of our colored
votes urn no longer imbued with Repub
lican ideas The vexed negro problem
will be solved and tho plan of tho re
turn of the negro domination will haunt
us no more Can 1 not opDeal to the
magnauimity of the dominant race can
not I pledge iu your behalf that we white
men of South Carolina stand ready to
listen kindly to all reasonable com
plaints to grant all just rights nnd safe
privileges to those colored people that
they shall have equal proteotion under
the law and guarantee of fair treatment
at our bands
That the colored people have griev
ances it is idle to deny that the mem
ory of wrongs and insults heaped by the
whites on the blacks during the eight
years rule has provoked retaliation and
often injustice It is true it was natural
nnd inevitable but we owe to ourselves
as Christian people owe it to God tho
nemo of our state whioh has been black
ened thereby and Its prosperity re
tarded that such things should bo
stopped We whites have absolute con
trol of the state government and we in
tend to retain it in the intelligent exer
cise of the right of suffrage at once The
highest privilege and most sacred duty of
the oltlzen is us yet beyond the capacity
of a vast majority ot the colored men
We deny tat all men are not an equal
It is not true now and it was not when
Jefferson wrote it Butwe cannot deny
that it is our duty as a governing power
In South Carolina toinsure to every in
dividual black and white a right to life
liberty and pursuit of happiuess
All other state officerselect were also
sworn iu
It is now believed that Senator Hamp
ton will be defeated by Irby Tillman
candidate for the United States senate
to succeed Hampton
