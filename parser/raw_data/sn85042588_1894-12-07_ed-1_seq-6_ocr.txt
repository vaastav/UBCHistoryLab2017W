Mr. Cleveland Presents His Views tc
the Fifty-Third Congress in the
I Usual Manner,
HIS FINANCIAL SCHEME
Principally an Endorsement of That
of the Secretary of the
Treasury.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.—Following is
the message of President Cleveland to
congress:
To the congress of the United States:
The assemblage within the nation's leg­
islative halls of those charged with the
duty of making laws for the benefit of a
generous and free people impressively sug­
gests the exacting obligation and inexor­
able responsibility involved in their tusk.
At the threshold of sucli labor now to be
undertaken by the congress of the United
States and in the discharge of an execu­
tive duty enjoined by the constitution, I
submit this communication, containing a
brief statement of the condition of our nar
tional affairs and recommending such leg­
islation as seems to me necessary and ex­
pedient.
OCR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Advantages of a Firm Bnt Just Foreign
l'olloy Set Forth.
The history of our recent dealings with
other nations, and our peaceful relations
with them at this time additionally dem­
onstrate the advantage of consistently ad­
hering to a firm but just foreign policy,
free from envious or ambitions national
schemes, and characterized by entire hon­
esty and sincerity.
The president then details our dealings
with Brazil, Chili, France, Portugal,
Germany, touching upon the Beliring sea
award, and recommending the tippropria
tion of a sufficient sum to carry out its
provisions. The new government of Ha­
waii has been recognized. A new extradi­
tion treaty i\«ith Italy is needed, but efforts
in that direction have so far been unavail­
ing.
Apart from the war in which the island
empire is engaged Japan attracts increas­
ing attention in this country by her evi­
dent desire to cultivate more liberal inter­
course with us and to seek our kindly aid
in furtherance of her laudable desire for
complete autonomy in her domestic affairs
and full equality in the family of nations.
The Japanese empire of today is no longer
the Japan of the past and our relations
with this progressive nation should not be
less broad and liberal than with other
powers.
Our Southern Neighbors*
Good will fostered by many interests in
common has marked our relations with
our nearest Southern neighbors.
The uprising in Bluefields at one time
promised serious results, but was satisfac­
torily settled.
Modus Vivendi With Russia.
The recent death of the czar of Russia
called forth appropriate expressions of
sorrow and sympathy oil the part of our
government with his bereaved family and
the Russian people.
As a further demonstration of respect
and friendship our minister at St. Peters­
burg was directed to represent our gov­
ernment a the funeral ceremonies.
The .seal ng interests of Russia in Behr
Ing sea. are second only to our own. A
modus vivendi has therefore been con­
cluded with the imperial government re­
strictive of poaching on the Russian rook­
eries and of sealing in waters which were
not comprehended in the protected area
defined in the Paris award.
TheSamoan islands, over which Ger­
many, England and America have a tri­
partite protectorate, have been the scene
of considerable disturbances. The tri­
partite agreement is not altogether satis­
factory, and congress is asked to express
its_ judgment as to the propriety of stepj!
being taken by this government, looking
to the withdrawal from its engagements
with the other powers on some reasonable
terms not prejudicial to any of our exist­
ing rights,
«tHE TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
There Was a Deficit of Nearly Seventy
Millions the Past Year.
The secretary of the treasury reports the
receipts to this government from all
sources of revenue during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1894, amounted to $372,
802,498.29, and its expenditures to $442,605,
758.87, leaving a deficit of $69,803,200.58.
There was a decrease of S15,952,074.06 in
the ordinary expenses of the government
as compared with the fiscal year 1893.
There was collected from customs
1131,818,530.02, and from internal revenue
8147,168,449.70. The balance of the income
for the year, amounting to $93,015,517,97,
Was derived from sales of lands and other
sources.
The values of our total dutiable imports
amounted to §275,199,086, being $140,047,
625 less than during the preceding year,
and the importations free of duty amount­
ed to $399,795 530, being $64,748,675 less
than during the preceding year. The re­
ceipts from customs were $73,576,486.11 less
and from internal revenue $13,836,539.77
less than in 1893.
The total tax collected from distilled
spirits was $85,259,250.25 on manufactured
tobacco $8,617,898.62, and' on fermented
liquors $31,414,788.04.
Our exports of merchandise, domestic
and foreign, amounted during the year to
$892,140,572, being an increase over the pre­
ceding year of $44 495.378.
Ctoid Exports.
The total amount of gold exported dur­
ing the fiscal year was $76,898,061, as
against $108,680,444 during the fiscal year
1893. The amount imported was $72,449,
119, as against $21,174,381 during the pre­
vious year.
The imports of silver were $13,286,252,
and the exports were $50,451,265.
The total bounty paid upon the produc­
tion of sugar in the United States for the
fiscal year was 513,100,208.89, being an In­
crease of $2,725,077.01 over the payments
made during the preceding year.
Estimates For Next Year.
It is estimated that upon the basis of our
present revenue laws, the receipts of the
government during the fiscal year ending
June 30,1895, will be $424,427,748.44, and its
expenditures $444,427,748.44, resulting in a
deficit of $20,009,000.
On the first day of November, 1894, the
total stock of money' of all kinds in the
country was $2,840,773,888, as against $2,
804,651,000 on the first day of November,
1893, and the money of all kinds in circu­

capita, upon an estimated population of
60,887,000. At the same date there was
held in the treasury gold bullion amount
ingto $44,015,177.55, and silver bullion,
which was purchased at a cost of $127,779,
988.
Coinage and Production of Metals.
The total coinage of all metals at our
mints during the last fiscal year consisted
of 63,485,220 pieces, valued at $106,216,730.
06, of which there were $99,474,912.50 of
gold coined $758 in standard silver dol­
lars $6,024,140.30 in subsidiary silver coin,
and $710,919.26 in minor coin. During the
calendar year of 1893 the production of
precious metals in the United States was
estimated at 1,739,323 fine ounces of gold,
of the commercial and coinage value of
$35,955,000, and 70,000,000 fine ounces of
silver, of the bullion or market value of
$46,800,000 and of the coinage value of
$77,576,000.
The circulation was decreased $1,741,563.
The obligations of the banks to each other
were increased $117,268,334, and the indi­
vidual deposits were $277,294,4S9 less than
WAR DEPARTMENT.
No Present Necessity For Increasing the
Arriiy—Coast Fortifications.
From the report of the secretary of war
it appears that the strength of the army
on Sept. 30, 1894, was 2,135 officers and
25,705 enlisted men.
ovel^0,000 m^ The purpose o^congress
the policy of sea fortification, in the
prosecution of which we have steadily en­
gaged for some years, has so far devel­
oped as to suggest that the effective
strength of the army be now made at
least equal to the legal strength. Measures
taken by the department during the year,
as indicated, have already considerably
augmented the effective force, and the
secretary of war presents a plan which I
recommend to the consideration of con­
gress to attain the desired end.
Three llattalion Formation.
Economies effected in the department in
other lines of its work will offset to a
great extent the expenditure involved in
the proposition submitted. Among other
things this contemplates the adoption of
the three battalion formation of regiments
which for several years has been indorsed
by the secretaries of war and the generals
cSmmauding the army.
A" Allusion to Interior Disturbances.
It is ha rSly necessary to recall the fact
that in obedience to the commands of the
constitution and the laws, and for the
purpose of protecting property of the
United States, aiding the process of the
federal courts, and removing lawless ob­
structions to the performance by the gov­
ernment of its legitimate functions, it be­
came necessary in various localities dur­
ing the present year to employ a consider­
able portion of the regular troops. The
duty was discharged promptly, courage­
ously, and with marked discretion by the
officers and men, and the most gratifying
proof was thus afforded that the army de­
serves that complete confidence in its effi­
ciency and discipline wjiich the country
has at all times manifested.
The year has been free from disturb­
ances by Indians and the chances of fur­
ther depredations on their part are con­
stantly becoming more remote and im­
probable.
j. Coast Armament.
The skill and industry of our ordnance
officers and inventors have, it is believed,
overcome the mechanical obstacles which
have heretofore delayed the armament of
our coasts, and this great national under­
taking upon which we have entered may
now proceed as rapidly as congress shall
determine. With a supply of finished
guns of large calibre already on hand, to
which addition should now rapidly follow,
wieilftm nf nrnvifiincf CiUT^
emplacements tor tneir mount can not oe
too strongly urged.
The total enrollment of the militia of
the several states is 117,533 officers and en­
listed men, an increase of 5,346 over the
number reported at the close of the pre­
vious year.
An Honor For Scliofield.
In recognition of the long and distin­
guished military services and faithful dis­
charge of delicate and responsible civil
duties by Major General John M. Sclio­
field, now the. general commanding the
army, it is suggested to congress that the
temporary revival of the grade of lieuten­
ant general in his behalf would be a just
and gracious act, and would permit his re­
tirement, now near at hand, with rank be­
fitting his merits.
THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT.
More Judges for Circuit Courts of Ap­
peal Recommended.
The report of the attorney general notes
the gratifying progress made by the'su­
preme court in overcoming the arrears of
its business and in reaching a condition In
which it will be able to dispose of cases as,
ihey arise without' any unreasonable de­
lay. This result is, of course, very largely
V* H?
i, will furthermore
effect an annual reduction approximating
$250,000 in direct expenditures, besides
promoting generally the health, morals
and discipline of the troops.
Small Ports Abandoned.
The execution of the policy of concen­
trating the army at important centers of
population and transportation, foreshad­
owed in the last annual report of the sec­
retary, has resulted in the abandonment
of 15 of the smaller posts, which was ef­
fected under a plan which assembles or­
ganization of the same regiments hitherto
widely separated. This renders our small
forces more readily effective for any serv­
ice which they be called upon to perform,
increases the extent of the territory under
protection without diminishing the secur­
ity heretofore afforded to any locality, im­
proves the discipline, training and esprit
de corps of £he anjiy^ besides considerably
decreasing the cost of its maintenance.
Though the forces of the department of
the East have been somewhat increased,
more than three-fourths of the army is
still stationed west of the Mississippi,

In the report accompanied by recommend"

at large in previous messages, and at this
time therefore need only be named. I re­

Another subject of pressing moment re­
ferred to by the attorney general is the re­
organization of the Union Pacific Railway
company on a basis equitable as regards
all private interests and as favorable to
the government as existing conditions will
permit. The operation of a railroad by
court through a receiver is an anomalolis
state of things which should be termin­
ated, on all grounds public and private, at
the earliest possible moment.

UNITED STATES HAILS.
Strong Recommendation For Revising
Laws Regarding Second Class Matter.
The report of the postmaster general pre­
sents a comprehensive statement of the
operations of the postoffice department for
the last fiscal year.
The receipts of the department during
the year amounted to$75,080 479.04 and the
expenditures to $84,324,415.15.
The transactions of the postal service
indicate with barometric certainty the
fluctuations in the business of the country.
Inasmuch, therefore, as business compli­
cations continue to exist throughout the
last year to an unforseen extent, it is not
surprising that the deficiency of revenue
to meet the expenditures of the postoflicc
department, which •was estimated in ad­
vance at about $8,000,000, should be ex­
ceeded by nearly $1,250,000 dollars.

meaning
of these terms from time to time have ad­
mitted to the privileges intended for legiti
mate newspapers and periodicals a
Surprising Range of Publications
and created abuses, the cost of which
amount in the aggregate to the deficiency
of the postoffice department. Pretended
newspapers are started by business houses
for the mere purpose of advertising goods,
complying with the law in formality and
discontinuing the publications as soon as relieved from the duty of deciding liti
the period of advertising is over. 'Sample
copies" of pretended newspapers are is­
sued in great numbers for a like purpose
only. The result is a great loss to
the government, besides its humiliating
use as an agencv to aid in carrying out the
scheme of a business house to advertise
its goods by means of a trick upon both
its rival houses and the regular and legiti­
mate newspapers.
Pftper Covered Literature,
Consisting mainly of trashy novels, to the
extent of many thousand tons, is sent
through the lhails at one cent per pound,
While the publishers of standard works
are required to pay eight times that
amount in sending their publications.
Another abuse consists in the free car­
riage through the mails of hundreds of
tons of seed and grain uselessly distribu­
ted through the department of agricul­
ture. The postmaster general predicts
that if the law be so amended as
to eradicate these abuses, not only will
the postoffice departments show no defic­
iency, but he believes that in the near
future all legitimate newspapers and
periodical magazines might be properly
transmitted through the mails to their
subscribers free of cost. I invite your
eassideration of this subject, and
faily indorse «he views or the postmaster
general.
The total number of postoffices in the
United States on the 30th day of June,
1894, was 09,805, an increase of 1,043 over
the preceding year. Of these 3,426 were
presidential, an increase in that class of 68
over the preceding year.
Six hundred and ten cities and towns
are provided with free delivery. Ninety-
this service under the law have not been
accorded it on account of insufficient
funds.
THE NAVY.
Secretary's Recommendation For
Ships and Torpedo Boats Approved.
Attention is called to the report of the
secretary of the navy, which shows very
gratifying progress in the construction of
ships for our new navy. All the vessels
now building, including the three torpedo
boats authorized at the last session of
congress and excepting the first class bat­
tleship Iowa, will probably be completed
during the coming fiscal year.
The estimates for the increase of the
navy for the year ending June 30,1896, are
large, but they include practically the en­
tire sum necessary to complete and equip
all new ships not now in commission, so
that unless new ships are authorized the
appropriations for the navy service for the
fiscal year ending June 30,1897, should fall
below the estimates for the coming year
by at least $12,000,000.
1
Recommends New Ships
The secretary presents with much earn­
estness a plea for the authorization of
three additional battleships, and ten or
twelve torpedo boats. While the unarmed
vessels heretofore authorized, including
those now nearing completion, will con­
stitute a flriftt which it is believed is suffi­
cient for ordinary cruising purposes in
9 j&t
class battleships and but few torpedo
boats. If we are to have a navy for war­
like operations, offensive and defensive,we
certainly ought to increase both the num­
ber of battleships and torpedo boats. I
recommend that provision be made for the
construction of additional battleships and
torpedo boats.
The sacretary recommends the manu­
facture not only of a reserve supply of
ordnance and ordnance material for ships
Df the navy but also a supply for the
auxiliary fleet. Guns and their appurte-
nance®
not
should bo provided and kept on
hand for
both
these purposes. We have
today
a single gun that could be put
on the ships Paris or New York of the
International Navigation company, or any
other ship of our reserve navy.
The manufacture of guns at the Wash­
ington navy yard is proceeding satisfactor­
ily^ and none of our new ships will be re­
quired to wait for their guns or ordnance
equipment.
Both the secretary of the navy and the
secretary of the treasury recommend the
transfer of the work of the coast survey
proper to the navy department. I heartily
concur in this recommendation.
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
A Court For the Adjudication of
Contested Land Claims Desirable.
The report of the secretary of the in­
terior exhibits the situation of the numer­
ous and interesting branches of the public
service connected with his department. I
commend this report and the valuable
recommendations of the secretary^- to the
eareful attention of the congress.
The public land disposed of during the
year amounted to 10,406,100.77 acres, in­
cluding 28,876.03 of Indian lands.
It is estimated that the public domain
still remaining amounts to a little more
than 600,000,000 acres, excluding, however,
as military reservations and railroad and
No appropriation has how- other selections of land as yet unjudicated.
The total cash receipts for the sale of
lands amounted to $2,874,283.79, including
$91,981.03 received from the sale of Indian
lands.
Protection of Timber*
It appears that the appropriation for the
current year on account of special service
for the protection of the public lands and
the timber thereon is much less than
those for previous years and inadequate
form efficient performance of the work.
A l«ger sum of money than has been ap
propriated during a number of years past
1
on this account has been returned to the
government as a result of the labors of
those employed in the particular service
mentioned, and I hope it will not be crip­
pled by insufficient appropriation.
I fully endorse the recommendation of
the secretary that adequate protection be
provided for our forest reserves and that a
comprehensive forestry system be inaugu­
rated.
Cnntested Land Cases.
An exceedingly important recommenda­
tion of tiie secretary relates to the manner
in which contests and litigated cases,
growing out of efforts to obtain govern­
ment land are determined. These cases,
which number 3,000 or 4,000 annually, are
sent by the local officers to the commis­
sioner of the general land office for his ac­
tion. The exigencies of his other duties
oblige him to act upon the decisions of the
registers and receivers without an oppor­
tunity of thorough personal examination.
Nearly 2,000 of these cases are appealed an­
nually from the commissioner to the sec­
retary of the interior. Burdened with
other important administrative duties his
determination of these appeals must be
almost perfunctory and based upon the
examinatson of others, though this deter­
mination of the secretary operates as a
final adjudication upon rights of very
great importance.
I concur in the opinion that the commis­
sioner of the general land office should be
gated
land cases, that anon-partisancourt
should be created to pass on such cases
and that the decisions of this court shall
be final, at least so far as the decisions of
the department are now final.
Condition of Indians*
While the condition of the Indians
shows a steady and healthy progress,
their situation is not satisfactory at all
points.
I have always believed that allottments
of reservation lands to Indians in severalty
should be made sparingry, or at least
slowly and with utmost caution.
In these davs when white agricultur­
ists and stockmen 01 experience and intel­
ligence find their lot a hard one we ought
not to expect Indians, unless far advanced
in civilization and habits of industry to
support themselves on the small tracts of
land usually allotted to them.
I am convinced that the proper solution
of the Indian problem and the success of
•very step taken in that direction depend
to a very large extent upon the intelligence
and honesty of the reservation agents and
the interest they have in their work.
The indications are that the detail of
army officers as Indian agents will result
iO improved management on the reserva­
tions.
In the light of experience, and consider­
ing the uncertainty of the Indian situation
and its exigencies in the future, I am not
only disposed to be very cautious in mak­
ing allotments, but I incline to agree with
the secretary of the interior in the opinion
that when allotments are made the bal­
ance of reservation land remaining after
allotment, instead of being bought by the
for settlement with such scandals and un
fair practices as seem unavoidable, should
remain for a time at least as common land
er be sold by the government on behalf of
I the Indians in an orderly way and at fixed
prices to be determined by its locatiou
New and desirability, and that the proceeds
less expenses should be held in trust for
the benefit of the Indian ppoprietors.
The intelligent Indian school manage­
ment of the past vear has been followed
by the most gratifying.results.
As to Pensions.
At the close of the last fiscal year, on
the 30th day of June, 1864. there were
969,541 persons on our pension rolls, being
a net increase of 3,532 over the number re­
ported at the end of the previous year.
These pensioners may be classed as fol­
lows: Soldiers and sailors, survivors of
all wars, 753,968 widows and relatives of
deceased soldiers, 215,162 army nurses in
the war of the rebellion, 414. Of these
pensioners 32,039 are survivors of Indian
and all other wars prior to the late civil
war, and the widows and relatives of such
soldiers.
The remainder, numbering 937,505, are
receiving pensions on account of the. war
of the rebellion, and the 469,344 are now
under the rolls under the authority of act
of June 27,1890, sometimes called the de­
pendent pension law. The total amount
expended for pensions during the year was
$130,804,461.05, leaving an unexpended bal­
ance from the sum appropriated of $25,-
more than
iftnt
^Uir,_^^u/ 'T4,-
205,712.65. The sum necessary to meet
pension expenditures for the year ending
June 20,1898, is estimated at $140,000,OOO.
Should Soon Reaeh the Limit.
The commissioner of pensions is of the
opinion that the year 1895 being the 80th
after the close of the war of the rebellion
must, acording to all sensible human cal­
culation, see the highest limit of the pen­
sion roll, and after a year it must begin to
decline.
The claims pending in the bureau have
Increased more than 90,000 during the
year. A large proportion of the new claims
filed are for increase of pension by those
now on the rolls.
The number of certificates issued was
80,213.
The names dropped from the rolls for all
causes during the year numbered 37,951.
Among our pensioners are 9 widows and
8 daughters of soldiers of the Revolution
and 45 survivors of the war of 1812.
Purgation Was Necessary.
The barefaced and extensive pension
frauds exposed under the direction of the
courageous and generous veteran soldier
now at the head of the bureau leave no
room for the claim that no purgation of
our pension rolls was needed or that con-' wtonnh.C ^nr
tinned vigilance and prompt action are «ith
Tageanrl
fans, which has for its motive th. sLup. "2SK jS.-fe
ing of a pension and indicates a willing­
ness to be biind to the existence of mean
and treacherous crimes which play upon
demagogic fears and make sport of the pa­
triotic impulse of a grateful people.
AS TO AGRICULTURE.
Operations of the Department and Rec*
ommendatlons.
The secretary of agriculture in his re­
port reviews the operation of his depart­
ment for the last fiscal year, ann makes
recommendations for the further exte
sions of its usefulness. He reports a sav­
ing in expenditures during the year of six
hundred thousand dollars, which is coh­
ered back into the treasury. This sum is
twenty-three per cent of the entire appro
propriation.
A special study has been made of the
demand for American farm products in all
foreign markets, especially Great Britain.

New Lines of Research.
The department of agriculture has un­
dertaken during the year two important
lines of research. The first relates to
PVinfomilmmr»5»•»»pul
*ts mI4*.
the
D0S6 Of instj1,llf*f,mni i* ...
pose of instructing and familiarizing the
people as to the distinctive grasses of the
United States and teaching them how to
introduce valuable foreign forage plants
which may be adapted to this country.
The second relates to agricultural soils
and crop production, involving the an­
alysis of samples of soils from all sections
of the American Union to demon­
strate their adaptability to par­
ticular plants and crops. Mechani­
cal analysis of soils may be of
such inestimable value that it is
foremost in the new line of agricultural
research, and the secretary, therefore, rec­
ommends that a division having it in
charge be permanently established in the
department.
The Weather Bureau.
The amount appropriated for the weath­
er bureau was $951,100. Of that sum
$138,500, or 14 per cent, was saved and re­
turned to the treasury.
AS illustrating the usefulness of this
service it may be Mere stated mat the

telligently prosecute its scientific work chain in operation
and furnish sufficient material for pur-
of agriculture to investigate the report
upon the nutritive value of various arti­
cles and commodities used for human
food, with special suggestion of full,
wholesome and edible rations less waste­
ful and more economical than those in
common use."
Under this appropriation the depart­
ment has prepared and now has nearly
ready for distribution an elementary dis­
cussion of the nutritive value and pecuni­
ary economy of food. When we consider
that fully one-half of all the.money earned
by the wage earners of the civilized world
is expended by them for food, the import­
ance and utility of such an investigation
is apparent.
Scientific Research.
The department expended in the fiscal
year 1892,- $2,354,809 and out of that sum
the total amount expended in scientific
research was 45.6 per cent. Butin the year
ending June 30, 1894, out of a total expend­
iture of $1,948,988,38, the department' ap­
plied 51.8 per cent of that sum to scientific
work and investigation. It is, therefore,'
very plainly observable that the ^ponbmies
which have been practiced in the adihinis
tration of the department have not been
at the expense of scientific research.
The reoommendation contained in th»
report for 1898, that the vicious system o
promiscuous free distribution of its de­
partmental documents be abandoned if
again urged. These publications ruaj.
Well be furnished without cost to public
libraries, educational institutions, and thi
officers and libraries of states and of thf
federal government. But from all indi
vidual applying for them a price covering
the cost of the document asked for should
be required.
The secretary also again recommends
the gratuitous distribution of seeds, anc
that no money be appropriated for thai
purpose except to experiment stations.
The advantages of civil service reform'
are constantly more apparent Recent'ex
tensions have been made in classified lists
and more will soon follow.
The establishment of a national board
of health is also strongly recommended.

REPLENISHING THE RESERVE.

NEEDS AMENDING.
Tariff Act Passed by the Last Congress.
Not Satisfactory.
The tariff act passed at the last session
of congress needs important amendments,
if it is to be executed effectively and with
certainty. In addition to such necessary
amendments as will change rates of duty,.
I am still very decidedly in favor of put­
ting coal and iron upon the free list.
So far as the sugar scheduleis concerned
I.would be glad under existing aggrava­
tions to see every particle of differential
of our tariff law. If with all the favor

Favors Free American Registry.
The ancient provision of our law deny
ing American registry to shins built-
abroad and owned by Americans appears,
in the light of present conditions, not
only to be a failure for good at every port,
but to be nearer a relic of barbarism than,
anything that exists under the permission,
of a statute of the United States. I
earnestly recommend its prompt repeal.

many times by way of drawing gold from

Our small gold reserve is thus subject to
drain from every side. The demands that
increase our danger also increase the ne-
«secretary cessity of protecting this reserve against-
ncrrion .ni-o r, depletion, and it is most unsatisfactory to
know that the protection afforded is onljr
a temporary palliation.
&
Only One Way.
It is perfectly and palpably plain that
the only way under present conditions by
which this reserve when dangerously de­
pleted can be replenished, is through the
issue and sale of the bonds of the govern­
ment for gold and yet congress has not
only thus far declined to authorize the is
•ue of bonds best suited to such a pur­
pose, but there seems a disposition in
some quarters to deny both the necessity
and power for the issue of bonds at all.
I. cannot for a moment believe that any
of our citizens are
deliberately willing that
their government'should default in its
pecuniary obligations or that its financial
operations should be reduced to a silver
basis. At any rate I should not feel that
my duty was done if I omitted any effort
I could make ty avert such a calamity. As
long, therefore, as no provision is made
for final redemption of the putting aside

peatedly and c^nstantly difaw from the
government its gold, and as long as no
better authority for bond issues is allowed
