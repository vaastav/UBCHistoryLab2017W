The President Takes a Gloomy View.
2Ï. O. Picaynne.
Tlie inewwK« which President Cleve
lind li;iü addressed to Cmigre.« , nssem
lib-d in tIit^ lust session «if its fiftieth
term, is aomewhat teniiivkaiile. Nut fur
what it recommends, because, it only re
iterates tlte propositions whi h tiare
heretofore been urged i ».y him, tint which
in the main have l>ei-n disregarded, lint
for tlie jrlootn and almost prophetic
strain in which it reviews the situation
and speaks of the future, wili this docu
ment command attention. Foi the rest,
it is very voluminous and for i he reason
that it ciiticises quite freely the short
comings of Congress during the last un
precedentedly long session it is not like
ly to exeit any special influence on the
porceedinfîs of the present session. He
opens his subject by picturing the be
ginnings of the United States Govern
ment under the constitution, thus :
The citizen of our republic in its early
d iys rigidlv insisted upon full compli
ance with the letter of this bond (the
c institution), and saw stretching oui
before him a clear field for individual
endeavor. His tribute to the support of
hin government, was measured by the
cist of its economical maintenance, anil
he was secure in the enjoyment of the
remaining recompense of his liberty and
contented toit. In those, days the fru
gality of the people was stamped npon
their government, and was enforced by
the free, thoughtful and intelligent suf
frage of the citizen. Combinations,
monopolies and allegations of capital
were either avoided or sternly regulated
and restrained. The pomp arid glitte 1
of govet omenta less free oft-red no
temptation, and presented no delusion
to the plain people, who side by side, ii
friendly competition fought for the en
noblement and dignity of man, for the
solution of the problem of Iree govern
ment, and fur th» achievement of the
gr ind destiny awaitiug the laud which
God had given them.
Ou the 4th of March next, when th«
present Congress shall terminate its ex
istence by limitation of law, a cent nr.*
will have elapéed since the first Con
gress assembled in Philadelphia on the
4th of March, 1789. Let us see with tin
eyes of the President the difference in
the condition of the couutiy and the
people now from what it was when tin
National Legislature commenced itsex
istence. Says the message :
A ceytnrv has missed. Our cities are
the abiding places of wealth and luxu
ry ; our manufactures yield fortune.»
never dreamed of by the fathers of tin
republic ; our business men are madl\
striving ill the race for riches, and im
men-ie aggregations of capital outrun
the imagination in the magnitude of
their undertaking.
VVe view with pride and satisfaction
this bright picture of our country'*
growth and prosperity, while only n
•«loser scrutiny develops a somber shad
ing. Upon more careful inspection wi
find the wealth and liiviiry of niircith-i
mingled with poverty and ivreteliediie«»
ami unremiineiative toil. A crowded
and constantly increasing urban popu
lation suggests the impoveli-dimenr of
rural «entions. The farmer's son. not
satisfied with his father's simple and la
borious life, juins the eager chase fm
easily acquired wealth. VVe discovet
that the fortunes realized by our manu
facturers are no longer solely the reward
of honest industry and enlightened fore
sight, but that they result from the dis
criminating favi.r of the government,
and ire largely built npon undue exac
tioiis from the masses of our peoph
Tue gulf between employers and th
employed is constantly widening, and
classes are rapidly forming, one com
pricing the very rich and powerful,
while iu another are found the toiling
poor.
As we view the achievements of ag
gregated capital we discover the exis
tence of trusts, combinations and mon
o polies. While the citizen is struggling
far in the rear or is trampled to death
beneath an iron heel, corporations,
which should be the carefully restrain
ed creatures of the law and the servants
of the people, are fast becoming the
people's master.
In that century the population of the
country has multiplied itself twentv
fold. The continent is grid ironed with
railways, cities of metropolitan propor
tions and rank have sprung tip in the
lieait of the country, as well as on the
6ea coast, a thousand busy industries
occupy the workers while private for
tunes have grown tocolossal proportions
rivaling in amount the vast taxes laid
on people of the old world for the use of
kings. This enormous show of wealth
for a few and of work for the many does
not dazz'e Mr. Cleveland's prophetic
vision. He thns portrays the present
evil and the future danger :
The existing situation is injurions ♦«»
the health of our entire body politic. It
stifles in, those for whose benefit it is
permitted all patriotic love of country
and substitutes in its place selli-dt greeii
and grasping avarice. DevoMon to Am
erican citizenshin for its own s:ike and
for what it should accomplish as a m
tive to our nation's advancement and
the happiness of all our people is dis
placed by the assumption that the Gov
ernment, instead of being the embodi
ment of equality, is but an instrument
ality through which esnecial and indivi
dual advantages are to be gained.
The arrogan -e of this as«umt<tion is
unconcealed. It appears in the sordid
disregard of all but personal interests ;
In the refusal to abate for the benefit of
others one iota of selfish advantage, and
in combinations to perpetuate such ad
vantages through efforts to control leg
is'ation and improperly influence the
suffrages of the |>eople.
T ie grievances of those not included
wirliiii the circle «if those beneficiaries,
when fully realized will surely arouse
irritation and discontent.
Our farmers, long suffering and pa
tient, struggling in the race of life with
the harden* anil most, unremitting toil,
will not fail to see, in spite of misrepre
sentations and misleading fallacies, that
they are obliged to accent, such prices
for their products as are fixed in foreign
markets where they compete with the
farmers of the world j that their lands
are decliuing in value while their debts
increase, and that without compensat
ing favor thev are fotced by the action
of the government to pay, for the bene
fit of others, such enhanced prices for
the things thev need that the scanty re
turns of their lalwir fail to furnish their
support or leave no margin for accumu
lation. .
Our workingmnn enfranchised from
all dflnsiims, and no longer fiightened
bv the c<y that their wages are endan
gered by "a just revision of our fax laws,
will reasonably demand through such
revision, s+»-ad'er employment, cheaper
means of living in their homes, freedom
for themselves and their children from
the doom of perpetual servitude, and an
open door to their advancement Iteyond
the limits of a laboring class. Other»of
our citizens, whose comforts and expen
ditures are measured by moderate sala
ries and fixed incomes, will insist unon
th« fairness and justice of cheapening
the coast of necessaries for themselves
and »heir families.
When to the selfishness of the benefi
ciaries of unjust diseriminatrnn ander
m»r law* there «liai! be added th» dit»
content of those who suffered from such
discrimination, we will realize the fact
that the beneficent purposesuf our gov
ernnn tit, dependent upon the patriotism
ami contentment of tiui people, aie en
dangered.
Communism is a hateful thing and a
menace to pi -HCeuml oiganized govern
ment, hut. the communism of comhiu
ed wealth and capital, the ontgiowth
of overweening cupidity and selfishness,
which insidiously undermines the jus
lice ami integrity of free institutions, is
not less dangerous than the communism
or oppressed poverty, which, exaspeiat
ed by injustice and discontent, attacks
with wild disorder the citadel of rule.
Ill-natured criticism may declare that
liese are the declarations of a pessimis
tic egotist who predicts ruin for the
ountry because it. is to pass from under
his administration. The thoughtful and
patriotic citizen will see in these fore
bodings the prescience of the statesman
who discovers in the marvelous increase
m the number and influence of money
d monopolies and in the astonishing
growth, side by side, of luxury and pov
erty, ami in the general depaiture from
Republican simplicity and in frequent
ti igrant violations of the spirit of the
constitution, the seeds of swift decay,
which it not checked anil eradicated,
I result in overwhelming national
Illlll.
This is the burden of the President's
message. It will not, make him anj
nore popular. 0;i the contrary, it will
issist to hasten the fall of an avalanche
if disfavor. But it. will fall on one
who is brave enough and honest enough
do his duty regaidless of consequen

MASSACHUS ETTS SLAVERY.
A dispatch from iiotjoke, Mass., to
th-» New Voik Herald of Nov. 22, gives
the following narrative :
The siirht of a man chained hand* am!
i t, ami padlock« d to the beat of a
wagon waiting lo lie sohl to a purchase)
Caarles T. Parsons of Noithampton,
the famous trafficker in immigrant la
bur, caused a htige sensation here*to
day. ,
Parsons keeps att employment btf'rean
in Norihanipton, about nine miles from
iiere. He deals in foreign pauper labor
mly. He mi-» to New Yoik about once
a week and hires forty or fifty of the
most ignorant men women and children
lie can find, taking care that none of
'.«»»e he hiies can read or speak the
English language. Hé takes them hojn**
iiol seIN them out. to fanners, getting
from *40 to §50 for each man. The
faillie)« use them as «la<es. wotkine,
feeding and housing them just the saun*
«s I liev do tin ir cuti le.
At 9 o'clock this morn'ng Parsons
drove to I his city wi ! Il one of these • a'l
er immigrants hi a »agon. His victim
iv;is bound hands and feet with a ß-fool
chain, w hich wm fas'ened bv a bis* pad
<oi k lo 'lie sea' of the wagon. Parsons
milled tin ill a sid<- street, Hhd hitching
bis horse, to a post I 't hi« «luve «ernred
here while he went. Î» is said, to »eek a
• nrt haser. At 10 o'clock Parsons had
•iot le'il'iieil, tndmihe mercury wan
• >nl\ ii few degrees above ze--o the slave
•i » » shivering faim cold. His condi ! inn
wa< noticed and somebody went over to
• lie wagon to invite him indoors. The
tear* were frozen on his face. A pair of
«veral!«, a shirt, a coat and an old pfiir
■ >f shoe« made up his dress. It was then
f otitld that he w-.is chained. and t'-e ru
quickly wen' a round that he was
one of Pars-ins' s'aves
Chief of P lice Whiteomb and an ofii
eer were quickly on the scene, and the
■ hief was in the act of <ma«hing the sea'
of the wagon when Paisons ant ei'ted
and Haid "Hohl on. I will unlock it." a'
• he same time taking a kev froui his
pocket and unlocking the padlock that
secured the man.
"Are you Parson«?" inquired the
Chief.
"Yes, sir," said Parsons.
"r>i«l yon chain this man ?" further
inquired the officer.
••Y'*s, sir, I did. Pie is mine," answer
ed Parsons.
"Y-'U are a nrisoner, you scoundrel ."
sai« 1 the Chief,
T'ien the indignant cowd that had as
sembled i»egan to m-.ike threats.
"Lvnch ! ' "Tak" him away from
the police !" "KiM him !"' and other such
exclamations w ere heard on everv side.
Rut the police hnstled h : m to <he station
and-locked him nn safety. The people
thronged aronnd the no'icp station in
crowds and it was a lucky circumstance
for Parsons that lie was protected be
hind • bars. The mob wns ready for
ivneh law if tt'ey could only have got
the'r hiip-ï» on Parsons.
Meanwlii'«* the released slave was
eatinca Innch that the police had pre
nared for h : m in 'he office He ate 'ike
a man who hadn't eaten anything for a
week. His eyes were dnll «nd «unk in
to his Ix ad. His purple hands wer
«written so as to resemble a pair of
boxing glove«, and the marks of the
iron cl>iiir ä were plainly to be seen on
' is t< gs. When asked hi« name he
shook Iiis head. I hat ded him a penc'l
M«'d i note book, when he wrote in a
Vjjp.lp hand his name and the p'aeo
from whence Ii» came. It read : "Win
cent L'ltm cr.'Zte«. Rnrvntska. \faria
no|«kego, Poland." He is about 20 y ears
of -Ige.
Later a man was found who eonh'
talk to the released «lare. His -story la
'in» h" arrived in Now York on Mav 3.
IflSS Next dav he was engaged bv one
of P usons' agents and taken to North
i'am-'toii He «- is hired ont to a farmer
ami p'omised §13 a month. He never
received a cent for wage» and took his
eliances on running awav a week ago.
H" asked lodgings in the Northampton
no'ice station, but n»'Tt morning P*r
«••ns came and claimed him. He work
••d aronnd Pardons' farm for a week,
and when he a«ked for wages Parson»
«truck him with his fist in the face. He
knocked him down this morning and
ch'iined him.
Parsons i« despised all over the state
He is the man who can«ed a big sensa
tion four years ago by making ice water
for his laborers with the ire that was
nacked around the dead body of his wife
in » casket awaiting hnrial.
Chief Whiteomb handed Parsons a
warrant th's morning charging him with
illegally detaining a man. a prisoner
and with an agvin't. A charge ^ kid
naping with a rie** to sending hpn on*
t>f the «täte ag iin>d his will is now being
m"de ont against him. The penalty nf
this •« a fine of from $1000 to §5000 or
immisonment from, two to ten y#t^ ;
His case «amies up in the police court î"
the niorning.
The story of Parsons'doing is already
well k«own to the readers of the Her

How Shall the lBrr®*»ing Population ol
the TTorld lie led?—An Illustration.
The troubles at the leading centers of
population, the agitation of questions
which are ciosciy comiecf«l with wage
earning, are all barometric indications o?
storms ahead. What shall to done w ill,
the? rapidly increasing population of the
world and how ii shall be provided for so j
as to reduce the f riction of bread winning
to the minimum, are grave problems .
which may enlict with profit the leading j
minds of civilized countries.
Mr. Edward Atkinson, in The Forum,
enters into a consideration of the doc
trines of Malthus and Eicardo. If their
concepts are to be received as demonstra
tious of science, what good, he ask?, will j
result from the efforts to ameliorate the
condition of mankind, to prevent war, to
stop famine and to save life from diseases?
If human passions and human nature
lead to a disp roportion of population iu
ratio to the means of subsistence, or if
the mind of man applied as a factor to
production cannot provide for this ten
dency of population to increase, without
resort either to violent or to purely arii
licial methods of checking it. we mis,ht
as well "eat. think and be merry, for to
morrow we die," without taking any
thought for the future of tho race.
With these [x-ssimiatic doctrines Mr.
Atkinson takes issue. lie thinks tiicy
are based upon very narrow observation.
If Malthuaoi' Eicardo l ad eonccived that
within a short period, savs Mr. At::in
he converted into ;
food for man and bea-it, i;y grinding into i
powder the phnsphoric sh'.g. wiiich ii the
waste pro-luet of the iron fun:. .ce,
neither would have ventured to pre*.
such hypotheses. Mahbua he'd that the
population of the world would increase
faster than means of subsistence cuuld be
found for the additional number, lli
cardo's theory was that a given t.reaof
land of high fertility when cultivated for
a series of years in a certain manner
would yield diminishing returns in pro
portion to the amount of labor and capi
lal expended upon it.
fir. Atkinson reviews these hypotheses
very elaborately, and fnaily concludes
as follows: "The mind of man when ap
plied to the direction of raturai forces is
the principal agent in material produc
tion: in fait, the controlling element.
Those who claim that labor is the source
of all production are utterly misled, be
cause they do not admit this fundamen
tal principle. May it not.thrrelore.be
more consistent with the concepts of an
enlightened faiih of any type in which
order is recognized in the universe to
present an hypothesis that as ti-e mental
faculties of a mat) are mere cevelo;ied
and more intelligently applied to tho
conversion cf the forces of nature into
material products, tho general struggle
for life will become less and not greater ?"
Idr. Atkinson takes the right view. It
Î3 optimistic, but at the same time is based ;
on the experience of oriental nations, j
Theßoil Ü the great reservoir of man's |
subsistence. It is the foundation t'ljen :
which all other industries are based. If
the earth were rocky, and so sterile as to
be alisolutely unproductive. nu.:i himself
could not êxiit. He i;ves virtually on
the soil. Titcre could be no i nimal lile
without the eo'.L For even t he. ct.rnivcr
oai animals indirectly draw tneir sus
tenance from mother earth. The soil
supports those animals on which the meat
eaters live.
Granting that the soU is the Lasisof all
life, what is the proportion of danser that
the theories c-f Maithus and Ricardo will
ever be rca! ized ? 11 seems to be very
small. Man isyit in the adolescent period
of his intellectuality. Ile w-i'J in the fut
ure know much more alxnit the forces of
nature and how to govern and to prac
tically apply them than he does now. All
thia knowledge will be turned into useful
channels. We will understand how to
fertilize and cultivate the soil so that it
can never be exhausted and will produce
the maximum. So long as the soil ia
productive so long will there be no fear
tîiat humanity cannot bo supported.
Take, as an illustration, the case of
China. The area is not more than one
third the size of the United States. It
supports, however, six times as many
people as we have in this country. It
takes care of the increase without any
difficulty. The most careful system of
fertilisation is observed, and the farmer
there be&tows as much care on his farm,
which is mere in the nature cf a garden
than a ferai, as the fl >wt r gardener in
the United bu.te.s bestows on his exotics.
Even Germany, as eteriia as it "i.> in many
part 3, can supply millions more ptcj-Jo
than it docs no w. Tho director cf tho
German statistical bureau has recently
submitted i^iute very interesting figures
on this eubject. His conclusions, wiiich
are based on the rtat:3t : cs gathered, arc
that without any effort G Liar y v, iii li

It will be centuries and centuries before

Verf Peculiar Wedding fling«.
Lieut, von Francois, the African ex
plorer. has recently described a strange
custom f:mon» the Bayanzi. who live for
many miles along the Upper Congo. The
custom w ould seem to make life a good
d ^al of n burden to their married women.
Eruss rods, which are the favorite cur
rency in the country, are welded into
great rings around the necks of the
Many of these rings worn by
the women, whose husbands are well to
. ,] 0< weigh as much as thirty pounds, and
j burden must be carried around by
the poor women as long as they live.
♦•Frequently," says Lieut, von Fran
cois. ' 'one sees a poor woman whose neck
i:? raw and sore under the heavy weight,
and in places the skin is rubbed olf by
j the ring. Tl ;i3 is a sure sign that the
ring has been recently welded around
her neck, for after a time the skin be
comes calloused, and then the strange
ornament produces no abrasion. But
the weight is an inconvenience; they
never get used to it. and it is a perpetual
tax upon their energies. In every crowd
of women may be seen a number who are
supporting the ring with their hands,
and thus for a time relieving their weary
shoulders of the heavy burden. It may
t>e said that with every movement of
their bodies the rings give them discom
fort.
♦•A ring is never put around a wo
man's neck until she is believed to have
attained her full physical development.
Or.ce or , it is no easy matter to get it olf.
The natives have no euch thing as a file.
; i n ,] t though they can hammer a lot of
i | jr ass rocs into one. it is very dililcidi
for t hem to cut the thick mass of metal
in two. Women who increase largely
in flesh after the rings have been fas
tened on their necks are in danger of
strangling to death, and instances of this
s^rt heve lieen known to occur.
"Yet these women regard the cum
brous ornament with pride, imagine that
it enhances th. ir importance and beauty,
an-1 wear the burden with light hearts.
Erass is the money of the country, and
!,v putting it around their wives' necks
the men are pretty certain that it won 't
be btoien or foolishly expended. But it
is an oiid and crucl sort of a savings

A groat and motley throng of brown

Central Asia, is preparing for the pic

The Big Boofstcr'g Indignation,
A disappointed barn yard fowl is often
as cross as if it could show its temper
after the manner of human beings. The
big dominiqne rooster was a very good
natured fellow with hens and young
chickens, and he seldom resented having
kernels of corn, no matter how many,
snatched out from under hi3 beak, when
it was done in a fair scramble. But if
he had begun to crow, and a kernel was
unexpectedly dropped where he certainly,
would have got it, had he not been bo
busy, it was too much to see his share
taken away by sny other fowl. He frc
qncntly jsecke-1 the eilender as soon as he
could stop crowing and showed general
ill temper for a few moments. His in
dignation wa3 so amusing that we fell
into ilie habit of ttasing him in thia way,
until, at Let, the eld fellow began to
practice choking down the rest of hia
crow when cen was thrown in front of
him. Gradually ha managed to st<^>
more and more quickly, and in the end
he wouid swallow his voice with a gulp,
and snatch a bit of food as promptly as
if ho had not been crowing at cil. —Ben

THE NAMES OF JEWS.
Why s oto « Qäre Cfaosen Owrtlle Suruam«.
Kngllsh Form«—Change».
Lord Coleridge touched upon an in
teresting theme the other day when he
inquired of certain Jewish witnesses how
it was that they had adopted the names ;
of Mordauntand Sa ville in lieu of their j
■ t ,, „_ j Com.
native patronymics of Moees ana j
uel. It is not quite correct to sav that ;
Jews ever cliange their original names.
— - . I
In the synagogues they bear tlirougnoui ,
their lives the Hebrew names—in the ,
traditional Oriental form of So-and-so, |
£ o . ta thnm «l'ortlv
son of So-and-so-given to them s.-omy j
after theu- birth. The instability of the !
names by which they are known to tue
world is due to the fact that originally, I
like all Oriental peoples, they had no :
family names, and that wherever they :
have congregated very closely together
the secular use of the traditional genea
logical forms has been tenaciously pre
served. In some countries, euch as Ger
many and Austria, special legislation has
been found necessary to compel them to
adopt fixed surnames. As, at different
times, they have como into closer con
tact with the Gentile world, they have
themselves seen the necessity of eur
, names, and it is not surprising if, under
! these circumstances, 60me of them should
! have chosen the most sonorous and dia
| tinguished they could fiud.
i An examination of the lists of seat hold
| ers in the twelve principal synagogues of
; London shows that less than 5 per cent
i of the names—such as Beddington. Clif
! ford, Coburn. Curtis, Graham. Ilalford,
Hamilton, Ilardinge, Hardy, .Herbert.
Howard, Lumley, Manville, Marsden,
Morton, Montagu, Moriey, Morton.
Neville, Norman, Russell, Sydney, V\ al
ford. etc^aro accounted for on thia
hypothesis.
"The foreign surnames and place names
preserved by the Jews of England form (
a Etna!! epitome of the history of the j
Isra^litish dispersion. Side by side with j
the Hebrew Abrahams, the Egyptian
Moses, and the English Mordaunt, we
have the Greek Alexander and Margolies, ,
the Latin Marcus, and tho Araoic Mocatta. j
Tho«e derived from mediaeval house;
signs are Rothschild, Adler, Ganz, Scii iff, i
Strauss, Silberkron, etc. Some of the
occupation names ure interesting. Rophe
is Hebrew for physician, and Rappoport
is a corruption of Rophe d'Oporto; Jalfou
is Hebrew for moaey changer, and
Mocatta is Arabic for mason.
More strictly Anglo-Jewish are the
natural assimilations of Hebrew and
Jewish names to English forms. ^ Thu3,
Coleman is a corruption of Kidman,
which is an abbreviation of Kalonymos,
the Greek translation of the Hebrew
Shem Tob (Good Name). Donny is de
rived, through Bondi, from a Latin
translation of Yom Tob (Good Day).
Phillips comes from the Hebrew Uri or
Meier, both meaning "light," through
the Greek equivalent Phœbos and its
German-Polish diminutive Pheibul. Sa
viile is a more natural corruption of
Samuel than ia generally imagined, see
ing that in Germany the Scriptural name
has been shortened into Sanvel. and in
England we have the authority of Mr.
Weiler, senior, to Bpell it with a "we.''
Freeman ia from the German Friedmann,
a translation and apocopation of Shalom
ben Menachein. Haymen ia derived
through Ilyman and Uyar. from the He
brew Haim (life). Jessel is from Eches
kel, the Hebrew pronunciation of Eze
k.'el. Yates is from Goetz, an abbrevia
tion of Gottschalk, which in Low Ger
man means "God's servant," and is a
literal translation of Eljakim. Among
simpler changes are Cowan—Cohen,
Lewin —Levi, Victor—Avigdor, Archer
—Asher, Jesaop—Joseph, and Soman
and Slowman—Solomon. Curious in
stances of misdirected translations are af
forded by the names Marchant and Chap
man, both of which are Anglicizations
of the German Kaufmann or Handels
mann. Originally, however, neither of
these names meant "merchant" among
the Teutonic Jews. Kaufmann is a cor
ruption of Koppelman, of which tho first
two syllables are a German diminutive
of Jacob and the third an abbreviation of
Menachem, the whole being a contrac
tion of Jacob ben Menachem. Handels- j
mann has a similar history, being t
derived from Elchanon ben Menachem, j
through Hand!, a recognised German j
diminutive of Elchanon. In the same i
way Seligman is a contraction of Selig
ben Menachem, and Felberman a cor" j
rupted contraction of Phoebus (Uri) beu
Menachem.
Ono of the Q106t curious instance? Of !
'
cn erroneous etymology is the name
Jaffo, which figures among the landed
gentry of county Down. It is the He
brew word for "beautiful," and is a
direct translation of the German 4 'Schon."
As a Jewish eurname, however. Schon or
Sehen lias no meaning. It is simply an
acrostic of the Hebrew Schliach Neeiuon
(faithful messenger). Tnese acrostic
names are peculiarly Jewish, and many
of them are found among English Jews.
For example, Katz. which one of these
days will perhaps be Anglicized into Cat,
is derived from tho initials of Kohen
Tzedek (priest of righteousness); Schatz,
which in Hungary lias actually been
translated into Kincz, the Magyar for
♦•treasure," is from Schiiach Tzibur
(messenger of the congregation): Babad
is from Ben Ab Beth Din (Son of the
President of the House of Judgment);
Sack is from Sera Kadosh (holy poster
ity), and when the name of a town be
ginning with s is addded—as, for exam
ple, Sera Kadosh Speyer (holy posterity
of Speyer) —it becomes Saks or Sacus,
which lias been frequently mistaken for
an abbreviation of Sachsen (Saxony);
Brara ia from Ben Rabbi Moees; Bran
(corrupted into Braun, and translated
into Brown) from Ben Babbi Nachman;
Bard, from Ben Rabbi David; Bersai,
from Ben Rabbi Solomon the Levite, and
Bril from Ben Rabbi Judah the Levite.
The exegetical names are also peculiar
ly Jewish. They consist of equivalents
for Hebrew names, derived from colloca
tions in L-ibiical tests. Thus the com
parisons in Jacob's blessing furnish
equivalents for Benjamin in Wolf, for
Judah in Lion and for Naphtali in Hart.
Fisher is an equivalent for Ephraim, be
cause it was foretold (Oen. xlviii, 10)
that he should multiply exceedingly, and
the fish is n symbol of fruitfulncsa. It is
also conic-timea a substitute for Moees,
because Pharaoh's daughter, in giving
him his name, said (Exodus ii, 10):
♦'For I drew him ouj* of the water."
