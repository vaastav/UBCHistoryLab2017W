Criminal Court of Appeals Hold3 That
This Section is Contrary to the
State Constitution.
Oklahoma City, Dec. 15. That por
tion of the state prohibition law limit
ing the amount ol intoxicating liquor
which may be kept in a place of bus
iness to one quart and in private resi
dence to one gallon was given a knock
out blow by the criminal court of ap
peals in an opinion by Judge Arm
strong yesterday when the statute
was declared in violation of both the
state and federal constitutions. .
Tl.e caf-- was brought before the
court of 1 ;st resort in criminal mat
ters by an application for a writ cf
habeas corpus filed by W. J. Wilson
of Ardmore Who was arrested charged
with having in his possession three
quarts of alcohol. The case was sub-
. mitted upon an agreed statement of
facts and the only question before the
court was the constitutionality of the
statute. The state limiting the
amount which may be kept in a pri
vate home to one gallon was not in
issue, but the question is Identically
the same and it is stated by Judge
Armstrong that the ruling will operate
to also put that provision of the law
out of operation.
Judge Armstrong in the opinion of
- the court cites a long list of decisions
from the federal courts and the high
est courts of many states. It is held
, that the statute is in violation of sec
tion 7 article 2 of the state constitu
tion in that it deprives a citizen of the
state of his property without due pro
cess of law. It ia in violation of the
fourteenth amendment to the federal
constitution which provides that no
State shall pass any law which de
prives any citizen of the United States
of property without due process of
law. 'v'
Under the statute which was abolish
ed yesterday the mere possession of
intoxicating liquor over the amount
stipulated in the- law . waa. sufficient
evidence to render a verdict of guilty
of violation, of the liquor laws and
many conviction's have been obtained
under the statute. The statute- has
been the means of driving many boot
leggers of the state out of business.

Tulsa, Okla., Dec. 13. An amusing
feature of the second annual meeting
of the Oklahoma Municipal League

tallest official in the state, and It. D.

Tax League to Be Organized Here for
Purpose of Making War on
High Taxes.
The meeting of the taxpayers of
Craig county here tomorrow promises
to be one of the most important events
of the year in Vlnita, and it is predict
ed that an organization will be effect
ed at this time that will have an im
portant bearing on the future political
destinies of this county and of Vinlta.
The decision of the taxpayers to or
ganize for the purpose of protecting
themselves from high taxes came as
the result of the action of the state
board of equalization in arbitrarily
raising the value of farm ' and city
property in Craig county, for taxing
purposes, at a much higher value than
this property would bring at a fair
cash sale. It is proposed to organize,
elect officers, levy dues and prepare to
wage air. unceasing campaign against
excessive' taxation. The taxpayers of
the county are all requested to attend
this meeting and it is probable a large
delegation from Welch, Bluejacket,
Big Cabin, White Oak, Centralia and
the smaller towns of the county will
be here to attend this meeting.

POLITICAL PIE
ATTRACTS NUN
Leaders Begin Scramble For District Attorney
Appointments In Two Oklahoma Dis
trictsPresident To Name Federal
Attorneys Early Next Month
Washington, D. C, Dec. 13. There's
political pie to be cut by President
Taft for Oklahoma republicans, about
the first or second week in January
and as the chief executive has long
since learned to expect, when there is
a bit of patronage at stake, the G. O. P.
leaders of the state pre scrambling for
it like a bunch of hungry children after
a jar of jam.
Early next month President Taft
will be called upon to name two Unit
ed States attorneys, one for the west
ern district of the state and one for
the east. It is these Jobs that has
started the republican organization off
in another tug of war, and both sides
are kept busy laying their requests
and recommendations before President
Taft by letter and in person.
Probably the greatest interest is be
ing taken in the contest being waged
in the western district. The term oi"
John Embry as United States attor
ney will expire January 7, and as he
resigned a little over a year ago, but
was prevailed upon to finish his term,
it is not expected that he again will
be a candidate. At the time the resig
nation was announced Representative
Dick T. Morgan took a stand for Judge
Gillet as Embry's successor while Rep
resentative Bird McGuire supported
Robert A. Lowry of Stillwater for the
place. When the matter of a succe
sor was waxing warm, Embry with
drew his resignation and the feudists,
Morgan and McGuire laid down ther
arms for the lime being. I
Now that Eiiibry is almost sure to
leave office In January, arms have beeu
shouldered again and Morgan is urg
ing H. M. Boardman of Watonga fog
the place" while McGuire is again fav
oring Lowry. It is known, however,
that McGuire's second choice for the
place is Attorney Cress of Perry.
Boardman was Morgan's last cam
paign manager and being a close per
sonal friend of the congressman, the
latter will stand back of him through
thick and thin. Even should Embry
again seek to succeed himself. Mor-

of the Choctaw Nation containing
their names, and to restore them to
citizenship as duty enrolled members
of the Choctaw Nation. Messrs. Kap-
pler & Merr'llat and James K. Jones,
attorneys, of Washington, I). C, and
Apple & FrankMn, of Ardmore, Okla.,
represented the petitioners. Justice
Stafford of the supreme court of the
District of Columbia required the sec
retary to show cause by January 10,
next, why the writ of mundanius should
not issuo requiring him to recognize
the persons aa citizens of the Choctaw
Nation and entitled to allotments of
ind selected by them.
The persons filing suit were John,
Mattie, James, Mary M., Nancy E.,
George P. and Bertha M. Harton;
Rachel S. and Viola M. Hunt; John H.
and Charles B. Darken; Maultsea J.
and Willie M. Lawley; Walter and

a ChoctaW' Indian woman named Mar
garet McCoy;1 whose- family is well
known in thfe Choctaw and Chickasaw
Nation. ' '" ,;. ' ' "
The petition in their behalf alleged
that after an unusually prolonged and
careful inquiry they had been found
entitled to enrollment as Choetawa by
blood, with the exception of three,
who were entitled by inter-marriage,
by the Dawes Commission, and that a
limited time was given wkhln which
the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nation
might appeal to the secretary of the
interior from the decision, but that the
two Indian nations acquiesced in the
decision, and the names of the parties
were placed -irflon rolls and the same
forwarded to Washington for formal
approval. It set3 forth that under the
rules and regulations all parties were
entitled to notice before any adverse
step could be taken against them, but
that after rolls-containing their names
had been prepared, but before the
same were Btarnped "Approved," the
attorney general of the United States
rendered a decision In another case
not applicable to their case regarding
the rights of one, William C. Thomp
son, and that without any notice or
opportunity to them to be heard and
show the difference between their case
and that of Thompson, Secretary
Hitchcock stamped the rolls contain
ing their names "Disapproved" with
out authority of law.
The parties in question have select
ed allotments and ask that these allot
ments be confirmed.
Three of the allotments selected
were among the lands which were to
have been sold at Atoka this month,
but the sale, In consequence of the
suit, as to the lands selected by these
people, was declared off and postponed
to await determination of their rights,
the sale proceeding as to other lands
not involved.
