The Baltimore News on Sunday cele
brated the first anniversary of the es-
lablisbment of its Sunday evening
edition. Unlike most Sunday issues, the
News is not a journalistic monstrosity,
but a “news” paper. The news asserts
no paper ever started under such adverse
conditions as did the Sunday edition, and
that few papers have ever made such
progress in their first year.
Col. George W. Goethals, being the
only man who has shown a disposition to
take the job and stay by it, is to be re
warded by a grant of supreme power over
the building of the Panama canal. If
the bill which has been reported by the
House committee parses, Col. Goethals
will be made, in his own province, the
most powerful official ever created under
tbe American Government.
The bill provides for the abolition of
the Canal Commission and tbe creation
in its stead of a director general. Colonel
Goethals is to be appointed in this
position.
In order to. demonstrate methods of
killing fruit tree pests and of pruning
trees, Pennsylvania has selected 1,000
orchards in different sections of the State
where an opportunity will be given fruit
growers and farmers to see men sent by
the State spray and prune trees, as well
as hear them lecture. The expense of
the work is borne by the State and it is
expected in this manner to conduct a
campaign of practical instruction that
will not only redound to the benefit of
- owners of orchards, but be a means of
furthering the fruit growing interests of
the State as well.
Senator Rayner, of Maryland, declares
President Zelaya of Nicaragua, must pay
for the murder of the two Americans rec
ently executed in that country, with his
life. The Senator, in support of his
resolution authorizing the President of
tbe U. S. to take steps to apprehend
Zelaya and bring him to trial for tbe
murder of Groce and Cannon, in a speech
before tbe Senate, branded the Nicaraguan
President as the most, despicable figure
*lhat has ever risen in the revolutionary
history of Central America, standing
without a peer in ihe school of corruption,
dishonor, perfidy and crime.
Notwithstanding President Taft in his
message recommends tbe postal saving
bank, tbe news sent out from Washing
ton is to the effect that Congress will not
pujh the plan until next year. In place
of the postal savings bank, which is op.
posed by Wall street, efforts will be made
by the Aldrich-Cannon crowd, who con
trol Congress, to force through the cen
tral bank, a cut and dried Wall street
scheme. . ...
The central bank, with its branches, is
a plan to place control of finances of the
country entirely in tbe hands of Wall
street, by establishing a big money Irust,
and it would not oply dominate all small
banks but virtually place all business
interests at the mercy of the big finan
ciers. Wall street has been planning the
central bank for twelve years, and hopes
now with Aldrich and Cannon in control
to force it through Congress, despite the
-efforts of the progressive republicans and
the democrats to defeat tbe nefarious
scheme. •
Want Government To Buy Chesa
peake Canal.
The purchase of the Delaware & Ches
apeake canal by the Government is again
to be urged at this session of Congress,
when a bill with this purpose in view is
to be introduced.
The improvement of this canal by the
Government has been the subject of agi
tation for years, and a bill is how being
prepared authorizing such a step. The
outlook for this bill, which will shortly
be introduced, is considered very prom
ising. The Delaware & Chesapeake
canal has been' twice favorably reported
to Congress for'improvement into a ship
canal of a sufficient depth to allow coast
wise liners and the heavier barges free
passage. The Aguns Commission some
years ago recommended that it be pur
chased by the Government for 12,514,289,
and the Committee of Congress on Rail- 1
ways and Canals also reported favorably
on its purchase.
This canal is probably tbe most impor
tant link in the inland coastal project of
the Atlantic Deeper Waterways Associa
tion, and at the two conventions of that
body in Baltimore and Norfolk, Govern
ment action upon it was urged.
WASHINGTON LETTER
The first week of the Congressional ses
sion has been uneventful. Both Houses
have adjourned from day to day and next
to no business of a legislative character
has been transacted. The fact that two
large conventions, one tbe Southern
Commercial agjl Industrial Congress and
the other the Waterways Congress have
been in session in Washington has de
tracted from tbe national Congress by
drawing to its sessions Members and Sen
ators, Cabinet Ministers, and the Presi
dent himself, who made a speech at tbe
opening of this convention. President
Taft spokq discouragingly with reference
to the scheme for the issue of United
States Bonds to tbe amount of half a
billion dollars to be used for the im
provement of tbe Navigable water ways
of the United States. This phase of tbe
question however is so dear to tbe three
or four thousand delegates of the con
vention who are now in Washington and
is urged with so much force and earnest
ness by distinguished men throughout
the country that it is difficult to'under
stand how the bond issue can be success
fully Opposed. The present generation
can scarcely expect to see the com-'
pletion_of an enterprise so vast. Tbe en
joyment of the advantages of tbe im
provements in tbe waterways, undertaken
now, must be mainly by posterity, .a
posterity that will be as much wealthier
and abler to pay the half billion of
dollars as the United States of today is
wealthier and abler than it was before tbe
Civil war.
In the President’s message to Congress
and in the Departmental reports of
the various Cabinet officers much stress
and emphasis has been given to the-sub
ject of economy Economy is no doubt
good in national affairs as it doubtless is
in household management, but it is more
beautiful and easier as a theory than as a
practice. Every one remembers bow re
cently tbe cant of the Simple Life, was on
the lips of everyone. It was promulgated
from the White House; but,Mr. Roosevelt
in the interest of peace urjfced the build
ing of Dreadnoughts at tbe cost of many
millions of dollars. So it has been with
past Congresses and doubtless will be
with the when the budget is
finally made up in June, July or August
next tbe billion dollar mark will have
been passed
V
Tbe Secretary of the Navy is making
most commendable efforts to improve con
ditions in the Department over which he
presides and it is given out that the
young and brilliant. Naval Officers who
have graced the ball rooms and salons
and clubs iu Washington, New York,
Boston and other Naval Stations must
actually go to sea. Naval statisticians
have just discovered that Germany has
taken tbe second place among tbe world’s
naval powers and that this place which
we appeared to bold a year of eighteen
months ago when our great fleet eD.
circled the globe, is ours no louger. It
is further shown that although we spend
many more millions than Germany in
tbe building and maintenance of our
navy that of Germany is stronger in
ships and guns and men than is ours.
These are not pleasant facts but they are
stubborn ones and we would better face
them now than after it will be too late.

With tbe information that tbe Paual
Canal will be finished iu probably less
than five years arises tbe importance of
its proper defense. Military engineers
have recently reported that its protection
will not be difficult. It will not be
necessary to build fortifications on the
island or breakwaters extending at one
end into tbe Pacific and at the other into
tbe Atlantic. It is thought that it will be
only necessary to dredge tbe approaches
to tbe Canal so that they will be narrow,
not more than five hundred feet in width,
permitting the approach of not more than
two ships abreast and these if unfriendly
war ships would be able to fire not broad
side discharges but only with the stem
guns. Batteries could be placed com
manding tbe long and narrow approachea
to the entrance of tbe Canal so as tp be
destructive to vessels coming within five
or six miles of any part of tbe Canal that
might be injured by them.
Another question of interest with re
gard to tbe Canal relates to tbe petty
republic of Colombia through which tbe
Canal passes. Colombia is of course a
Republic or a nation oDly in name or at
the French say ponr rire. The real Gov
ernment there is the Government of
the Canal Zone. All that there ia of law
or order, of Sanitation or of prosperity is
an importation from the United States.
Before the Canal enterprise transfigured
it it was a yellow fever pest hole, a neck
of land over which travelers hurried fear
ing to breathe. Now it is as healthy as
any place in the United States. The
American Minister, Mr. Sqniers, has been
recalled and it is said that any diplomatic
relations of the United States with
Colombia have been permantly discon
tinued. The petty local-Government is
not only not helpful to the United States,
it is annoying in that it is claiming the
acres of land that have been built up in
the sea and lagoons surrounding the
mouths of the canal, from the millions of
cubic yards of earth and stone taken
from the canal prism.
Doep Not Want Judgeship.
Governor Crothers stamps as untrue the
report being circulated that he proposed
to take Judge Pearce’s seat in the Court
of Appeals as the representative of the
Second Judicial circuit, which includes
Cecil county, leaving it to the President
of the State Senate, who will presumably
be Gorman, to fill out t\je
few months remaining of the term. Conv
cerning the rumor, the Governor said :
“There is no truth whatever in it. The
bench has no attractions for me, and I
have never had, the slightest inclination
to return to it. In saying this I have no
purpose, of course, of reflecting on the
judiciary, for the duties attached to those
offices are the most honorable and dignified
in the State. The life, however, does not
appeal to me.”
The gossip linking up the name of Gov
ernor Crothers with Judge Pearce’s seat
in the Court of Appeals was supplement
ed by the announcement that Senator
Gorman, then the acting Governor, would
be the. logical man for the Democrats to
nominate as their candidate, and while in
office he cpuld make a vigorous fight at
the close of his term to wrest the Federal
Senatorship. t from Isador Rayner, the
ambition of State Senator Gorman being
to succeed his-father in the National Sen
ate. Judge Pearce’s term expires in 1912,
but he reaches the age limit in 1911.
Governor Crothers has often declared
his purpose of filling out his term as Gov
ernor and then qnietlyS retiring to Elkton
to continue the practice of law.
Lawyers in Judge Pearce’s circuit are
very much about his retire
ment from the bench. Petitions are now
being circulated for presentation to the
General Assembly asking it to waive the
rule in favor of Judge Pearce so that he
may serve out the full teFm for which he
was chosen. Judge Pearce is as vigorous
today as he ever was. Ap a matter of
fact, he is the mainstay of the courts in
the Second circuit, the court terms in the
counties of the circuit being conducted as
late as o’clock at night in order that
the people may have the benefit of his
services in all the counties. His possible
retirement from the bench is regarded as
a public calamity. The petitions asking
for his retention on the bench are being
signed by all members of the bar regard
less of politics.
