President Advises Step; Congress Will Act at Once
THIS IS A GREAT
DAY IN HISTORY
OF NEW TACOMA
This is the day!
It is the first anniversary of Taeoma's stepping
out.
One year ago it was announced that Secretary
Baker had signed the agreement to place a canton-
ment for not less than 15,000 troops in Pierce coun
ty, if Pierce county would furnish the land.
Well, everybody knows now how Pierce county
did, one month later, vote to do that thing, how the
army city was built in world record time, how, not
15,000, but more than 40,000 soldiers were sent.
Also how shipyards came, as once the flocks of
wild ducks came, to make our tideflats their home.
This is the day. Tacoma is too busy to observe it
as a holiday, but Tacoma is not too wrapped up in
the affairs of the moment to remember and to mar
vel and be thankful.
What Some Tacomans Say
MAYOIt A. V. KAWUKTT—When Secretary Baker placed his |
name to the agreement to locate a permanent army post and can
tonment near this city he fired the magazine of municipal ambition
that has been here waiting for some spark to vitalize it into action.
'Pessimism was blown to flinders on that day and Taroraa became
un optimist with vision. Every day since then she has been materi
alizing that \ i. inn
The Todd shipyards, the Foundation Co., the Wright shipyards,
tl» Tacoma shipyards, the Old Town shipyards are simply mitleposts
of progress in the general schemo of Taeoma's new development.
That greater things are in store for the future no one who Is in
touch with events can for a moment doubt.
Tacoma dreamers for a generation have imagined the tideflats
occupied. The past year has seen the waters of the sound retire un
der the magical touch of electric power and dry land has risen and
la.-torles are running and a street railway has thrust its nose into
the doorway of great enterprises. Where a year ago men went in
rowboats to hunt ducks today they go to build great steel ships for
world commerce, riding on a new municipal electric railway.
Today m*n are beginning to realize there are no limits to the
progress here possble.
Entirely incomprehensible to old methods of thought, the mate
rial advancement of Tacoma has been accompanied by a revolution
also 1n patilotlc, moral and spiritual lines.
Tacoma has given millions to the government and hundreds of
thousands to the Red Cross, the Y. M. C. A. and other public philan
thropies and then she has gone forth to regenerate the city Never
in our history has there been such a •moral awakening and such a
determined effort to have a clean city as has been manifested in the
last twelve months. And we are getting results. Today Tacoma is
advertised from coast to coast as the cleanest city in Tacoma, and
it is worth while.
EDWARD V KKMMKR, sem Jury, Taronin Ooniini«-r«'ial club—
Tacoma has accomplished more during the last year than it had
'for 25 years before the army post came.
In a great many ways it is the greatest city on the coast. With
a nucleus to build on, there is nothing that can keep the city down.
Tacoma is the most talked about city on the coast, and it is known
all over the U. S.
A. It. McLKAN, president, Rotary rlul)—The cantonment has
been the making of Tacoma. It has brought an absolutely new
upirit to the community.
We are Just beginning to realize what Tacoma really is, and we
nre beginning to have confidence in ourselves. We are meeting a
new condition and we are meeting it with a spirit that is going to
make Tacoma grgw. It just proves the old saying that "nothing suc
ceeds like success."
T. 11. Itl:I.I.I V.II \M. chairman of tlio board of county com
missioners—Tacoma has Improved 500 per-cent, surely.
OR. CLARKNCK W. WKYKR, pantor of the First Presbyterian
church—l have been greatly impressed with the progress Tacoma
has made along all lines.
I have been in the city just two years. When I first came the
city was quiet, very conservative, living within Itself Now a new
condition has entered. The old Tacoma has gone.
At first I was afraid of the coming of the army post and the
moral problems it might present. Tacoma lias handled those prob
■• lems mighty well. There Ib a spirit of co-operation here that speaks
well for our city officers and the people who are backing them.
It has frequently been said that Tacoma is a hard city in which
to do church work. 1 have not found it so. I have found It a place
where the people are wonderfully responsive to moral and religious
rppeals.
A. 11. IIOWK, president of the Commercial club and of the Pioneer
Hindcry—Not only has the army post done wonders for Tacoma, but,
I believe, Tacoma has also done something worth while for the army
post and the men of the national army.
The army post is keeping us mighty busy, and I should say that
►at least half our energies at i lie Commercial club have gone in this
direction.
The officers and men at Camp Lewis appear to be well aatls
fled over what Tacoma is doing for them and have expressed their
nppreciation many times.
.1 \Mi;s H. DBGB, clothing merchant—Your editorial last even
ing, "One Year! Tacoma Has hived a Decade In the Last 12
Months," thrilled me as it should every loyal Tacoman.
We have accomplished more in the last year than we have in
the preceding quarter of a century.
Tacoma's future is fecure
The greatest optimist that ever resided here never painted a
picture of the future of our city to equal what it is actually develop
ing into today.
Let it never again be said that Tacoma has not live men who
ran do things in a V>»; way.
Wo must all, every one of us, the bootblack, the banker, the
editor, the merchant, the skilled and the unskilled laborer, work
*• together to meet the responsibilities that are up to us as fit liens
because of this new growth today.
JOHKFH I.VONS, secretary of the T»< <mm Central Labor Council
— The cantonment Vemains as a monument to the patriotism of the
organized workers during its building.

W MESSAGE
Following is the president's
message in full:
Uenttamen of the Congress:
Kiglu months have elapsed
since 1 had the honor of address
ing jon. They have been monHis
crowded with events of immense
and grave significance for us. 1
shall not undertake to detail orl
even to summarize these evwits. I
The practical particulars of the
part we have played in them will
be laid before you in the reports
of the executive departments. I
shall discuss only our present out
look upon these vast affair*, our
present duties and the immediate
means of accomplishing the ob
jects we shall hold always in view.
1 shall not go bick to debate
the causes of the wa.\ The Into'
erable wrongs done and planned
against no by the sinister masters
of (ierrminy have long since be
come too grossly obvious and
odious to every true American to
need to bo rehearsed.
But 1 shall ask you to consider
again and with a very grave scru
tiny our objectives and the meas
ures by which we mean to attain
them; for the purpose of discus
sion here in thiß place of action,
and our action must move straight
toward definite ends.
Our object Im, of i-ourM 1, to
win the war; ami we slmll
not s|j« kmi or suffer oui
■Mv«fc '<> in- diverted until It
is won.
From one point of view It Is
not necessary to broach this fun
damental matter. I do not iluu.n
that the American peoi)le know
what the war is about and what!
sort of an outcome they will ra
gard as a realization of their pur
pose on it.
Pacifists Do Not Touch
Heart of the Nation
As a nation, we are united in
spirit and intention. 1 pay little
h«ed to those who tell me other
wise.
I hear the voice of dissent-
who does not? I hear the criti
cism and the clamor of the noisily
thoughtless and troublesome. I
also see men here and there fling
themselves in impotent disloyalty
against the calm, indomitable
power of the nation.
I hear men deba 1* ix-noe
who iimUM-stanil neither It*
nature nor the way In which
we may attain U with uplift*
ed i.m-s and unbroken apirita.
But I know that none of theae
speaks for the nation. They do
not touch the heart of anything.
They may safely be left to Btrut
their uneasy hour and be forgot
ten.
But from another point of view,
I believe that it is necessary to
say plainly what we here at tha
seat of action consider the war to
be for, and what part we mean to
play in the settlement of its
searching issues.
We ure spokesmen of the Amer
ican people and they have a right
to know whether their purpose in
ours.
They desire peace by the over
coming of evil, by the defeat,
once for all, of the sinister forces
that interrupt peace and render it
impossible, and they wish to
know how closely our thought
runs with theira and what action
we propose.
They are Impatient with those
who desire peace by any sort of
compromise—deepry and indig
nantly Impatient—but they witl
be equally Impatient with us If
we do not make it plain to them
what our objectives are and what
we are planning for in seeking to
make conquest of peare by arms.
Force of Intrigue to
Be Crushed Down
I Ix'lievc tlml I speak for
tlii'm wlien I say two thing*:
First, tlml Mils Intolerable
thing of which Mil' master* of
«;<i niHiij have shown us the
ug'y fact, tills menace of

which we now see m> clearly
a-- tli*- German power, a thing
without conscience or. honor
or rapacity for oon Tenanted
peace, must be crashed anil,
if It be not utterly brought to
an end, at least shut oat from
tin- friendly intercourse of
tiie nations; and,
Srn.iiid, that when thli
thing and Pm power are in
deed defeated and the time
eoiiMM ttmt we can discos*
Peace—when the German
pimple have spoken whose
word we can believe and
when thorn spokesmen are

tiiKl).
W«' know wliat that price will
be. It will be full, impartial
justice -justice done at every
point and to every nation that the
final settlement must affect, our
enemies as well as our friends.
You catch, with m«, the voiced
of humanity that are in the air.
They grow daily more audlMe,
more persuasive and they come
from the hearts of men every
where.
They Insist that the war shall
not «>nd in vindicative action of
any kind, that no nation or people
shall be robbed or punished be
cause the irresponsible rulers of a
siiiKle country have themselves
done deep ;uui abominable wrons-
Refers to Formula
That Is Much Discussed
It is this thought that has been
expressed in the formula, "No
nniiexatlons, no contributions,
no punitive indemnities."
Just because this crude for
mula expresses the Instinctive
judgment as to right of plain men
everywhere it has been made dill
pent use of by the masters of Oer
inan intrigue to )cmi the people
of Russia astray—and the people
or every other country their
agents could reach, in order that
a premature peace might be
brought about before autocracy
has been taught its final and con
vincing lesson and the people of
the world put in control of their
own destinies.
Bat ll»- fact that a wrong
use has been marie of a jiint
idiii In no i« ,i"hpii why a right
iif-;- should nut be mmlr of it.
It ought to be brought un
der the |>nii<iiiMK'' of ils ii ■«l
friends.
Let it be said again, that au
tocracy nniHt first be shown the
utter futility of its claims to pow
er or leadership in the modern
world.
It is impossible to apply any
standard of justice so long as
such forces are unchecked and
undefeated as the present masters
of Germany command.
Not until that has been done
can right be set up as arbiter and
peacemaker among the nations
liut when that has been
done— a»% <iod willing, it iis
nh.mmH.v will be*—we Khali at
leaat be free to do an unpre
cedented thing and this In the
ttine to avow our purpose to
do It. We shall be free to
Inane peace on generosity and
justice to the i\. lunion of
all s4-ili-.ii claims to advant
age even on the part of the
victors.
Win the War; That Is ,
Our One Present Task
Let there be no misunder-
standing. Our present and imme
diate task Is to win the war, and
nothing shall turn us aside from
It until it is accomplished.
Every power and resource we
possess, whether of men, of
money, or of materials, is being
devoted and will continue to be
devoted to that purpose until it
is achieved.
lli..m> who (leMre to bring
peace about before tliat pur
pose X achieved I counsel to
carry their advice elsewhere.
We will "not entertain It. We
shall regard the war as won only
when the German people say to
us, thru properly accredited rep
resentatives, that they are
ready to agree to a settlement
based upon justice and the rep
aration of the wrongs their rulers
have done. i
They have done a wrong to Bel
gium which must be repaired.
They have established a power
over other lands and peoples
than their own—over the great
empire of Austria-Hungary, over
hitherto free Balkan states, over
Turkey and within Asia —which
miust be relinquished.
Germany's success by' skill, by
Industry, by knowledge, by en
terprise we did not grudge or op
pose, but admired, rather.
She had built up for herself a
real empire of trade and influ
ence, secured by tbe peace of th>>
world.
We were content to abide the

WILSON SCORES ALL
TALK OF PEACE NOW
(Inltcd I'icss LMMi Wlrr.)
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 4.~ Immediate declar
ation of war on Austria was asked by President Wil
son today.
Any peace that America makes must not only de
and commerce that were Involved
for us in her success and stand
or fall as we had or did not have
the brains and the initiative to
surpass her.
Not Proposing to
Dictate to Other People
But at -the moment when she
conspicuously won ncr triumphs
of peace she threw them away to
establish In their stead what the
world will no longer permit to be
established —-military and politi
cal domination by arms, by which
to oust where she could not ex
cel the rivals she most feared and
hated.
The peace we make must rem
edy fchat wrong. It must deliver
the once fair lands and happy
peoples of Belgium and North
ern France from the Prussian
conquest and the Prussian men
ace, but it must also deliver the
peoples of Austria-Hungary, the
peoples of the Balkans and the
peoples of Turkey alike In Eu
rope and Asia from the impudent
and alien domination of the Prus
sian military and commercial
autocracy.
We owe it, however, to our
selves to say that we do not wish
in any way to impair or to rear
range the Außtro-Htingarian em
pire It is no affair of ours what
they do with their own life,
either industrially or politically.
We do not propose or desire to
dictate to them In any way. We
only desire to see that their af
fairs are left in their own hands,
in all matters, great or small.
We shall hope to secure for the
peoples of the Balkan peninsula
and for the peop'e of the Turkish
empire the right and opportunity
io make their own lives safe, their
own fortunes secure against op
pression or injustice and from
the dictation of foreign courts or
parties. •
And our attitude and with dun
regard to tier in any herself are of
a like kind.
We intend no wrong against
the German empire, no interfer
ence with her internal affairs.
We should deem either the one
or the other absolutely unjustifi
able, absolutely contrary to the
principles we have professed to
lire by and to hold most sacred
thruout our life as a nation.
Nothing More False
Than German Claim
The people of Germany are be
-1 ing told by the men whom they
now permit to deceive them and
to amt as their musters that they
are fighting for the very life and
existence of their empire, a war
of desperate self-defense against
deliberate aggression.
Nothing could be more grossly
or wantonly false and we must
seek by the utmost openness and
candor as to our real aims to con
vince them of its falseness.
We are in tact fighting for their
emancipation from fear, along
with our own—from the fear, as
well as from the fact of unjust
attack by neighbors, of rivals or
schemers after world empire.
No one Is threatening the exist- j
ence or the independence or
peaceful enterprises of the Ger
man empire.
The worst that can happen to
the detriment of the German peo
ple is that, that If they should
still, after the war is over, con
tinue to be obliged to live under
ambitious and intriguing masters
interested to disturb the peace of
the world, men or classes of men
whom the other peoples of the
world could not trust, it might be
impossible to admit them to the
partnership or nations which must
henceforth guarantee the world's
peace.
Must Not Commit
Our Enemy's Offense
That partnership must be a
partnership of peoples, not a mere
partnership of governments. It
night be impossible, also, in such
untoward circumstances to admit
Germany to the free economic in
tercourse which must inevitably
spring out of the other partner
ships of a real peace.
But there would be no, aggres
sion in that; and such a situation
Inevitable, because of distrust,
would in the very nature of things
sooner or later cure itself, by
nrnfMMi which waulj ■MnvAitW '

the Prussian military and commercial autocracy,
President Wilson said. _
Appealing before a joint session of the house and
senate, the president delivered the message which
will set in motion the legislative wheels of the 65th
congress, whose task it is to aid the country's mili
tary forces toward victory.
Congress will immediately respond. The house and
