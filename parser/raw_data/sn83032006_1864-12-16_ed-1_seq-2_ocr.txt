BEDFORD, PA., FRIDAY, DEC. 16, 1664.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The annual message of the President of the
United States is given in this week's paper. It is
concise, business like, comprehensive and practi
cal. It should be studiously read by every one
who would acquaint himself from the highest
fcoiufoe. with the true condition of thccotthtry. The
patriotic press is very generally more* than sat
isfied with the style and and matter of the mes
sage, while the ''democratic'' press find nothing
in it to commend. The same systematic misrep
resentation and abuse which inade it notorious be
fore the election, characterizes i* liow, and we.
therefore, look in vain for a Word of approval. The
people, however, care nothing for this manifesta
tion of partizan anger and predjudice. They
ce satisfied with the choice they have made, and
if anything wete wanting to confirm the wisdom of
it, it may he found iu this determined Opposition
on the part of the copperhead press, not to l>e
pleased with any actor measure of the administra
tion looking to the restoration of peace and the
unity of the government by the speedy suppres
sion of the reljoilion.
After passing over our relations with foreign
governments, and surveying the condition of our
national finances, both of which are ablv and brief
ly disposed of. the President adverts to his future
policy in dealing with the rebellion and its cause,
slavery. This part of the Message is of such vast
importance that we shall not attempt a summary
of it, but would urge all our readers to read it care
fully and critically. His solemn declaration that
he will abide by the policy enunciated in his
Emancipation Proclamation will he acceptable to
every man r who believes that slavery has been
the cause of this accursed rebellion, and. that its
extinction, is demanded not only by the future
prosperity of the country, hut by every dictate of
reason and humanity.
Koontz and Fuller.
The Governor, it seems has determined hot to
declare Messrs. Koontz and Puller elected to Con
gress from the Somerset and Westmoreland dis
tricts, although satisfied that both of them receiv
ed a majority of the popular vote, the Attor
ney General having decided that the Governor
•cannot go behind the certificates of the return
judges. This is practically giving the return of
Congressmen into the hands of a few unscrupu
lous men who get themselves chosen return judges.
If such be the law, it should be amended as soon
as the Legislature meets. The board of return
judges in these two districts were controlled by
Copperheads, and by illegally rejecting soldiers'
votes they managed to count Daw son and Coffroth
in, contrary to the vote of the people and the
plain letter of the law. If the Governor cannot
legally correct such rascality as this, it is high time
that the power to do so sbo'ild be conferred on him
Congress will set the matter right, if the Gover
nor cannot. — Pittfairgh (itxzete.
The Special Income Tax.
This tax will soou he demanded by the collectors
and the public should be in readinses to make prop
er and prompt returns, under the penalties pre
scribed in the act. This tax, it will be remember
ed, is the second one for 1863. and amounts to an
additional five per cent, on the income. The first
tax was but three per cent., and was paid some
time ago. The intention of the law is that, everyman
having an income over S6OO, shall pay in the ag
gregate for that year, eight per cent. No deduc
tions are allowed on the five per cent, assesinent
for dividends or interests received from any com
pany or association. The full amount of a man's
income, from all sources, must be counted, not in
cluding, however, certain other deduction which
are printed on the back of the return furnished by
the assessor. Every person is obliged to make a
return, and these returns are open to the inspection
of any citizen, so that every jnan in a district
may see that his neighbor complies with the iaw
and bears his proper share of taxation.
How THE MESSAGE WAS RECEIVED IN CON
GRESS. —During the reading of the Message in the
House of Representatives, it was several times in
terrupted by applause, especially the concluding
portion in which he says he will not be the instru
ment to re-enslave such persons as are made free
by the Emancipation Proclamation or by any of
the acts of Congress, and that in stating this as a
single condition of peace he meant simply to say,
the war will cease on the part of the Government
whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those
who began it. The applause was by the clapping
of hands, with exclamations of "good!" "that's
right!" &c. The Speaker rapped his gavel to
prevent a further infraction of the rules of decor
um, although it was evident that he himself shared
in the declarations of the President.
THE PRESIDENTIAL Electoral Colleges of the
seyeral loyal States met their respective State Cap
itols on Wednesday, 9, inst., and cast the vote oftheir

Seerctary. Jno. A. Hiestaud, of the Lancaster
Examiner, was appointed Messenger to Washing

RIGHT. —In the United States House of Repre
sentatives on Thursday last, Mr. Schenck of Ohio
offered a resolution, which was adopted, .nstruet
ing the Committee on the Judiciary to inquire in
to the expediency of passing a law denar.tonalizing
person* who go abroad to escape the draft, and re
quiring application for naturalization in case they
want to be restored to the privilege of citizenship.
We hoi>c that the law will be adopted and the
cowardly shirks receive their deserts.
THE actual election of the President took place
on Weduesday the Bth inst. The Electors of
President and Vice President met on that day in
the capitals of of their respective States, and cast
the Electoral vote of their States. The result is
the same as that before announced, all the States

votes thus cast will be opened and read in Congress
in Eebruary next, after which the arrangements
will be made for the inaugcration.
THE AMENDMENT to the constitution prohibit
ing Slavery': will pass [the present House, the
motion to reconsider, made at the last session by-
Mr. Ashley, of Ohio, will be called up in due sea

Many of the democratic members, who voted a
gainst it last session, having learned a lesson from
the last election, will now vote fir it

THE STATE GRAKP.— It is now officially an
nounced that the men who enlist in the State
Guard, now being organized by Gov. Curtin for
State defence, will be practically exempt from
draft for The United States service. Any mem
bers of the guard drafted by the general govern
ment will be furloughed for the full period of their
term of State service and they will at the same
time be duly credited on the quotas of their res
pective districts. The following is Pupvost Mar

WAR SUMMARY.
Late rebel papers report that Sherman captured
all the powder of Georgia and 3000 stand of arms
at Milledgeville ; that Grant has been reinforced
by from 6000 to 10,000 men; that the Dutch Gap
canal can be made ready in a few hours ; that the
Union troops have effected a lodgement between
Fort Darling and the Howlett House; that one of
our gunboats was sunk on Monday by an iron bolt
from one of the Howlett House guns ; that Gen.
Sheridan and his cavalry appeared at Fredericks
burg on Wednesday; that resolutions in favor of
sending peace commissioners to Washington have
been introduced into the North Carolina Legisla
ture. and that in the South Carolina Legislature
resolutions depreciating peace negotiations until a
dissolution of the Union is conceded have been in
introduced.
The Richmond papers of the 9th instant state
that a heavy column of Federal troops left the
front of Petersburg on Tuesday night, and moved
out the Jerusalem Plank road. On Wednesday
they were at Proctor's, twenty miles from Peters
burg. and on Thursday at Jarret's. thirty-two
miles from Petersburg, on the Weldon Railroad,
and were proceeding towards Weldon. This is,
no doubt, the expedition under General Warren of
which we have already had some account*.
Memphis was excited on the 9th instant in con
sequence of a report that Beauregard was inarch
ing on Fort Pillow with a strong force and heavy
guns, supposed to be intended to be used for the
blockade of the river. Osceola has been occupied
by a small force of rebels. A party of rebels re
cently appeared opposite Memphis, and a force of
negroes which was sent after them was ambushed
and nearly all killed.
Official dispatches have been received from Gen.
Rousseau at Murfreesboro. The railroad south of
that place is believed to be uninjured. Block
houses 5 and 6 were .surrounded, and were aban
doned by the garrisons, who fought their way
through the enemy without loss. On Sunday
night the block-house -at Oreille Creek was attack
ed by infantry and artillery, but was not injured.-
On the same night a force under General Milroy
went out, attacked the rebels and routed them. —
Our loss was small' Our troops then returned to
the fort.
North Corolina advices state that, the rebel
troops having been sent to Georgia, that Stare is
left almost entirely unprotected. The opposition
papers are urging that immediate steps bo taken
for a cessation of hostilities, and a peace on any
terms which the United States government may
propose. The members of Congress who sup
ported the proposition are receiving letters calling
upon them to withdraw from Richmond and aid
the movement in North Carolina.
Army of the Potomac advices state that on Wed
nesday morning, the Fifth Corps, a div ision of the
Second Corps, and two brigades of Gregg's cavalry,
went South. They were subsequently heard from
and had crossed the Nottoway river, on the Jeru
salem road, without opposition.' On Thursday af
ternoon. a rcconoitering party of cavalry went out
on rhe left and encountered the rebel pickets on
the*Vaughan road. The rebels were driven to
Army of the Potomac advices say that the de
monstration made on Friday towards Hatcher's
Run did not result in bringing on an engagement.
No fighting of consequence took place. The troops
returned on Saturday night. Nothing positive has
been heard from Warren.
Hatcher's Run, where they had breastworks. Af
ter some skirmishing the party returned, with a
loss of seven men. It was reported that tiring
was heard in the direction of Stony Creek, and
Warren was supposed to be fighting the enemy.
General Sherman, according to the Richmond
papers of the 10th, was east of the Ogeehee river,
twenty-five u/iles from Savannah, on the Tth. On

The Straggle in Tenncssee--Deteat of the
Rebels-- Six Guns Cnpiurmh
NasilTiMiSj Dec. 6.—Very little of interest
transpired yesterday. Artillery skismishing con
tinued throughout the dayi Yesterday a body of
Rebels attacked block houses NrtS: 6 and ?, near
Murfreesboro. They were dHVen off in confusion,
losing six guns and a number of prisoners. Mat
ters it the ft'ofit to-day are quieter than usual.
NASHVTLLB, Saturday, Dec. 10, 1864. —The sit
uation of affairs remains unchanged. In front of
the Fourth Corps not a shot was fired up to 2
o'clock this afternoon.
Since then some slight skirmishing occurred.
Owing to the slippery state of the ground, the
men fihd it impossible to move about.
The Rebels can be plainly seen from the front of
the Fourth Corps standing about their camp
fires.
Hostilities may be said to have ceased on ac
count of bad weather.
Deserters who come in say that the Rebels have
strong intrenchments. with two rows ol'dmmtx dr
/rise, with wires stretched around to strengthen
them.
Col. Louis Johnson, instead of Coi. G. M. S.
Johnson, commander of the Forty-fourth Colored
Infantry, has received from the General command
ing the highest praise for the the manner in which
he fought his troops at Mill Creek Station No. 2,
having gallantly kept the enemy at bay for sixteen
hours, and finally fought his way out and reached
Nashville with the bss of 115 men, killed and
wounded.
No report has yet been heard from the gunboat
which went down the river yesterday morning.—
No cannonading has been heard heie since their
departure.
The river is three feet deep on the shoals, and
is falling.
Foster's Expedition into South Carolina.
NEW YORK, Dec. 8. —By the steamer Trade
Wind we have Port Royal advices of the 4th inst.
The Palmetto Herald says that on the 29th
ult. an expedition left Port Royal and went up
Broad river, accompanied by several gunboats.—
The troops landed at Boyd's Point and proceeded
inland several miles, meeting with rebel pickets
only. The next morning the enemy appeared in
force on the road leading to Grahamsville' with
cavalry, infantry and artillery. We advanced and
drove them gradually back to a battery and en
trenchments, where they nrnde a stand.
A hot engagement of seven hours ensued, du
ring which there were charges and counter charges
on each side, with considerable loss. Night pat a
stop to the fighting, the lines on both sides re
maining the same. We took a few prisoners and
lost a few. Our casualties are variously estima
ted at from 600 to 1000. During the evening we
fell back a short distance, and since then an ad
vance was made in other directions.
Report of the Postmaster General.
The postal revenues for the year ending the 30th
June last were $12,488,253 78. and the expendi
ture of this deparlment during the same period were
$12,644,786 2<J. showing an excess of the latter of
$206,532 42. The excess of receipts in 1864 over
1861, the first year of the rebellion, was $4,088,957
38. The increase of expenditures in 1804 compared
with those of 1863, is 11 5-8 per centum, and the
increase in the revenue for the same year 11 3-8 per
cent.
During the fiscal year 334,054,610 postage stamps,
of the value of $10,177,827 ; 20,044,300 stamped
envelopes, amounting to $765,612 50, and 1,574,500
newspaper wrappers, amounting to $31,400. were
issued. The total value of these issues was $lO,-
074,320 50, which, compared with the issue of the
previous year, ($10,388,700) shows an increase of
$635,660 50 or aboui 6 j per cent. The value of the
stamps, and stamped envelepes sold was $10,776,-
680 58, and the amount used in the prepayment of
postage was $0,878,155 61.
On the 30th of June last there were in operation
6,083 mail routes, the number ot contractors being
5,063. The length of these routes was 130,173
milco, end itc Dcivicc IM fulluWS, Vl*. . KalUUttll,
22,616 ; steamboat, 6,278 miles : ''celerity, certainty
and security," 109,278 miles —costing $5,818,469.
Inquiry has been made of Lieutenant General
Grant relative to the existing arrangements for sup
plying our armies with mails, with the assurance of
my earnest purpose toco-operate with him in carry
ing into effect any desired improvements of that ser
vice ; and 1 am gratified to learn from his reply, that
the system of receiving and forwarding mails now in
operation is entirely satisfactory, and tnat "our sol
diers receive their mail matter with as much regu
larity and promptness as is possible for armies in the
field, and with perhaps as much celerity and security
as the most favored portions of the country."
The mailing of all letters direct from one office to
another, however situated, in so vast? a territory as
that embraced within the United States, is objec
tionable. The ordinary distributing post-office not
meeting the necessities of the service, experiments
have been commenced with railway or traveling
post-offices. The requisite cars for the purpose are
prepared for one daily line between Washington and
New York, and by means of clerks taken temporari
ly from the post-offices at Washington, Baltimore,
Philadelphia and New York ; letters intended for
distribution at either of those points are distributed
in the cars, and so arranged that they can be dis
patchel without delay on connecting routes. Thus
it is found that the transmission of letters is expedi
ted from twelve to twenty-four hours, being the time
usually lost in distributing offices. Similar experi
ments have been made on the routes from Chicago,
Illinois, to Clinton, Davenport, and Dubuque, lowa,
with equally satisfactory results.
Attention has been given to the putting in opera
tion the railway distribution to other prominent
points, and the companies which have been asked to
furnish the nccessany car facilities have generally
responded favorably On the great eastern and wes
tern routes to Cleaveland, as well as between Wash
ington and New York, the size and importance of
the mails and the amount of distribution to be done
are such as to require accommodations to the extent
of an entire car. West of Cleveland only a portion
of a car will be used on each route.
Including the suspended post-offices, the whole
number on the JOtn June, 1864, was 28,878; of
which 19,976 are in the loyal, and 8,902 in the dis
loyal States. The number of Presidential offices is
705, and 28.173 are under the appointment of the
Postmaster General.
During the year 619 post-offices have been estab
lished, 788 discontinued, and 211 changes made of
names and sites. The number of cases acted upon
was 5,579. Four thousand seven hundred and thir
teen postmasters have been appointed, of whom 3,-
028 were to 511 vacancies occasioned by resignations;
674 by removals ; 259 by death ; 183 by change of
name and sites, and 619 on establishment of new
offices.
The free delivery of mail matter by carrier has
been introduced at sixty-six offices, employing at
present, 685 carriers, at an aggregate annual com
pensation of $317,061 22.
The Act approved May 17, 1861, authorized the
Postmaster General to establish, "under such rules
and regulations as he may fiud expedient and neces
sary, a uniform money-order system at all post-offi
ces which he may deem suitable therefor ; ' and is
further provided that this system should be put into
operation during the fiscal year ending June 30,
1865.
A superintendent and assistant have been appoin
ted, one hundred and forty-one post-offices have
been designated as money-offices, and the operation
of the system commenced on the Ist instant.
The maximum amount for which a money-order
can be issued is fixed by law at thirty dollars, the
object of the system being to afford a cheap, imme
diate, and safe agency for the transfer through the
mails of small sums of money.
Nashville dispatches of Saturday say that the
situation is unchanged. In the afternoon there was
some slight skirinisning. On account of the wea
ther, hostilities have ceased.
A Union expedition which crossed the Missis
sippi Kiverfrom Memphis, Tenn., and went fifteen
or twenty miles into Arkansas, captured on the 30th
alt. j forty Reliel soldiers, including Brigadier-Gen
eral Adams, an Adjutant, three Captains and one
Lieutenant,
Another reeonnoissance towards Hatcher's' Run
was made on Friday moruing by a force consisting
of detachments from several cavalry regiments.—
The enemy's videttes were driven across the run,
and the rebel works on the opposite side were car
ried. The eneniv is believed to have fallen back
to Armstrong's Mills, a stronger position, a mile

Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Mr. Feasenden. in his report, has given a thor
ough and intelligible report of the condition of the
national finances, nnd its candor is not its least val
ue. J.n his introductory remarks, the Secretary ad
mits the difficulties that still confront the Govern
ment, while his whole report furnishe-fevidenoe thnt
the resources of the nation, properly used, are suffi
cient to remove thein. The Republic has now a debt
of seventeen hundred and forty millions six hun
dred and ninety thousand four hundred and eighty
nine dollars and forty cents, the annual interest of
which is, in ronnd numbers, ninety-one millions.
The reduction of this debt is at present impossible.
The daily expenditure is about two and a quarter
millions, while the daily receipts are not quite one
million and a half. Thus we are running In debt at
the rate of one million and three-quarters daily, a
fact which should certainly have serious considera
tion. The only way to reduce this rate is by the im
position of new taxes, by which the daily receipts
according to Mr. Fessenden's estimate, may be rais
ed to two millions. The system of taxation he rec
ommends will produce an internal revenue of three
hundred millions yearly. Yet, even with the addi
tional revenues from customs and other sources, the
debt must .grow, and it is calculated that the increase
during the year ending June 30, 1865, will be $482-
372,,188. These figures are not alarming. On the
contrary, we are surprised that so candid an exhibi
tion of the situation as Mr. Fessenden has made
should be so encouraging. But the facts show that
Congress should earnestly address itself to the en
largement of the national revenue to the full extent
of the national resources. In the last two years we
have laid the foundations of a sound system, and
one of the great duties of the future is its thorough
development. Mr. Fessenden advices the appoint
ment of a commission to examine the subject of
taxation, and this wise and practical suggestion
should have the immediate attention of Congress.
Report of the Navy Department.
This document affords a fine picture of the rapid
progress and glorious achievements of our navy du
ring the past year. Of the passages relating to the
events of that period we have not space to speak,
were it necessary. But the exhibit of the naval
force is something demandinging attention. We
have now 671 vessels, carrying 4610 guns, and of an
aggregate tonnage of 510,306. Other navies may
exceed these figures, but in point of efficiency there
is now no navy surpassing ours. We have no less
than 71 iron-clad vessels of war, carrying 275 guns.
But the pride of our ocean navy are undoubtedly
our 118 wooden steamers, built especially for war,
and carrying 1426 guns, of the ability whereof the
Kearsarge has borne testimony. Secretary Welles
again repeats his urgent recommendation to Con
gress to accept League Island from the city of Phil
adelphia. ana establish thereon a great naval depot
for iron-clad vessels.
As has been anticipated, Mr. Welles, recommends
the establishment of the grade of vice-admiral in
the navy, and that the rank be conferred on Rear
Admiral D. G. Farragut, for his brilliant services
in the Mississippi river and in Mobile bay, in which
we think the loyal masses everywhere will most
heartily cuncur. The number of naval prises cap
tured since the commencement of the war is given
at 1379, of which 267 we steamers, and the gross
proceeds of sales thereof $14,396,250, thenett pro
ceeds above expenses being $12,190,741, of which
one-half goes to the United States government as a
naval pension fund. The expenditures of the Na
val Department during the fiscal year were $85,783-
292, and the whole estimated expenditure of the
Depaitment to the 4th of March next $280,647,261
from the commencement of the present Administra
tion.

T have been directed to make public the following ad
vertisement. The Board nf Enrolment will be i n eos.i„ n
daiiy at l.'haiubcrsburg for the purpose of striking ofl the
the names indicated below, unices absent under orders or
engaged in the more urgent duty of examining drafted
men. It is desired that enrolled men, calling with the
view of having their names stricken off, present tbem-ci.
vo in the afternoon, between one and four o'eloek. The
Board will cheerfully inform applicants by letter of the
quantity and character of proof required in special cam.
GEORGE ESYTER,
Capt. nnd Pro. Mar. Ifith Dist. Pa.
Ia order to secure the assistance and co-operation of the
people in the endeavor to keep the enrolment lists contin
ually correct, the Enrolment Boards have been directed to
have copies of saio lists kept open to the examination of
the public at all proper timet, and shall give public notice
that any person may appear before the Board and have
any name stricken off the list, if he can show, to the satjs
faction of the Board, that the person named is not proper
ly enrolled, on account of,
Ist. Alienage.
2d. Non-residence.
3d. Over age.
4th. Permanent physical disability, of such a degree as
to render the person not a proper subject for enrolment
under the law and regulations.
sth. Having served in the military or naval service two
years during the present war, and been honorably dis
charged.
Especially civil officers, clergymen, and all prominent
citizens are invited to appear at ail times before the Board
to point out errors in the lists, and to give such infin-ma
tion in their possession as may aid in the correction and
revision thereof.
They should understand that it is plainly for the inter
est of each sub-district to have stricken from the lists all
names improperly enrolled, because an excess of names
increases the quota called for from such sub-districts,- and
that it is equally for the interest of each person enrolled
in a given sub-district to place upon the lists all persons
In the sub-district liable to do military duty, because the
greater the number to be drawn from the less the chan.-e
that any particular individual will be drawn. It is the
personal interest of every enrolled man that the quota in
which he is concerned shall not be made to large, and that
his own chances for draft shall not be unjustly increased:
both these objects will bo attained if all parties will aid in
Striking out the wrong names and putting in the right
ones. Especially is this the interest of those drafted men
who by putting in substitutes themselves liable to draft,
have secured exemption, which, by the terms of the law,
holds good only until the present enrolment is exhausted
in their sub-districts. Men who are over 45 years of age,
and in consequence excused by law from the performance
of duty in tho field, owe it to the cause and to the country
to take a zealous and active part in the correction of the
euaolinent lists, a military service of the first importance.
The law requires that the quotas shall be assigned in pro
portion to the enrolment, and the fainness and justness of
this mode of determining the amount of military service
due from each and every section of the country, cannot
be doubted, if the enrolment is made a? nearly perfect aa
it is possible to make it. The amount of service due to
the nation from every town and county, is thus laid fair
ly and plainly before the citizens, and it is expected that
a higher motive than a selfish interest, will prompt all to
do their share in perfecting the enrolment, and securing
a just and efficient execution of the laws for raising troops,
whenever it becomes neeessarv to apply them. By order
