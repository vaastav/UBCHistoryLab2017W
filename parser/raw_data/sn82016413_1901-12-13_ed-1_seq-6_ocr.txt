MISS EDITH PATTEN, THE
Warm, Encounters
IN FEDERAL COURT
Between the Lawyers
V. A. Kinney, of counsel for the
Ulshop Estate, resumed his closing ar
gument to the Federal Jury at the
opening of yesterday afternoon's sit
ting. There was no sordid motive on
the part of defendant, he contended,
In the matter of the option, given as It
was contrary to the advice of Its agent.
The option was glcn In 189S before
annexation was consummated. It was
felt Hint the request for an option
promise of the opening of the harbor.
Counsel said he was far from denying
tho erection of a naval station at Pear!
Harbor. Civic pride nlone made them
regard It as n great thing for tho lsl
nnds at large and the Nation as well
as for owners of adjacent property. It
was considered by the Trustees of the
Dlshop Estate that the option nt ISO an
acre for part of its land was good busi
ness In view of the improvement the
opening of the harbor would be to ad
jacent property. They saw their com
pensation In the reservation of all this
land (Indicating a locality on the map)
fronting on the harbor. Otherwise the
Trustees had no right, they would not
dare, to violate their sacred trust by
selling land at that place for ISO an
acre. Their only Justification lay In
the enhanced aiue of what was left,
because from that they could get back
more than they gave away. Mr. Kin
ney compared the action of the Trus
tees with that of a man In tho Western
States who gave part of his land for
the site of a factory with the hope of
being repaid through tho enhanced
valno of the remainder of his property
from having n factory established in
the town.
Tho Trustees lived up to their option,
but were Informed that the United
States would not be subject to tram
mels. The option therefore expired
and next the United States came In and
took all that land (pointing), including
what was not under long leases. That
hypothetical man out west would not
give so much of his land for a factory '
as would leave nothing for himself.
Now tho Trustees said: "You asked for
000 acres within certain bounds, but
you have taken a great deal more.
You havo taken so much of our prop
city that you cannot fall back on our
original offer." What was there un
fair In that proposition
Mr. Kinney spoko about tho object of
the Ulshop Estato Trust, that of pro
viding for tho education of native, Ha
waiian youth. In conclusion ho nak
ed for no exaggerated verdict, no un
just verdict, but a fair and decent ver
dict for the full and real value of that
land on the 6th of July last. They I
should have no prejudice and no bins,'
but be governed by a determination to '
do equal Justice to both sides. Ho was
glad the responsibility was theirs and,
not his. It would be Impossible to I
pleaBO everybody, but If they satisfied
their own consciences they Might fear
no criticism. Mr. Kinney cautioned
them that It would bo unlawful for
them to strlko an average of dlvcrso
valuation.
Judge Estee asked Mr. Dunne if he
intended to take long in replying for
the government, saying he wanted to
know whether be should charge the
Jury that afternoon. .
Mr. Dunne, having said ho would not
tako up much time, proceeded. The
hour was 2:45. The Federal attorney
said he would not repeat his former
arguments or take up everything said
by opposite counsel, Ho described the
miters auurcss as ueing replete witn
references to "his learned friend," as
If tho Government counsel were on
trial, and with boasting about what
ho (tho defendant's counsel) would
have done If "his learned friend" had
not resisted this and that evidence. In
tho latter respect the remarks were in
reality a criticism of the Court that
ruled out tho evidence In question.
Mr. Dunne contented strongly on the
evasion by defendant's counsel of his
exposure of the extraordinary nature of
Mr. Low's testimony. After touching
on Cecil Drown's "extravagant" valua
tion, tho Federal attorney argued on
BRIDE OF GENERAL CORBIN.
the matters of the tax returns and the
option.
Mr. Kinney objected to commenting
on the tax returns with reference to
evidence that had been excluded by
the Court.
Judge Estee stopped Mr. Dunne un
til the disputed question was cleared
up. After reading the record he said
"If Mr. Dunne is talking on evidence
that was ruled out, he must stop."
Mr. Dunne "I am not discussing
testimony that was ruled out, Blr."
Judge Estee "Well, I am not say
lng you arc, but If you are you must
stop. After further words back and
forth. In which Mr. Kinney spoke of
"misquoting" and Mr. Dunne retorted
sharply that he was quoting the exact
report of proceedings, the Court rend
a stretch of the reporter's transcript
aloud, tho Court said: "Well. It
doesn't seem this testimony was ruled
out. Tho lease was ruled out, but tho
option was not." He asked Mr. Kin
ney to show the part of the record on
which he based his objection.
Mr. Kinney read a little bit and Mr.
Dunne' answered a question from the
Court, on which the latter said to the
Fcdernl (.ttorncy:
. "Well, go ahead."
Mr. Klney persisted In his objection
with a further statement, concluding,
"Is that fair?"
The Court replied that It was a
sworn statement and told Mr. Dunno
It) go en.
Within two minutes Mr. Kinney was
uji again, hotly accusing tho Federal
attorney of misrepresenting his admis
sions during tho examination of wit
nesses. Mr. Dunno warmly resented
the Imputation. Tho Court asked Mr.
Kinney to Indicate Just where the Fed
e'nl attorney was going wrong.
The Ulshop Estate's attorney made
another unavailing attempt to con'
vlnco the Court that be was being
wrongfully treated. Quiet was re
stored for about twenty seconds, when
Mr. Kinney again broke Into the flow
of the pleader's discourse.
Mr. Dunno now angrily protested
against tho continued Interruptions.
He waB following tho record of pro
n cdlngs.
Judge Estee told Mr. Kinney he must
cease Interrupting counsel. "You hav
not shown that the United States at
torney is committing fraud In his ar
gument." tho Court Bald: "I will not
allow you to Interrupt tho argument
any more."
Mr. Dunne, having his path cleared,
concluded Jils ai.drcss within a feu
minutes.
Judge Estee proceeded to read his
charge to tho Jury at 3:3oT first an
nouncing that ho had marked request
ed Instructions In writing from both
sides as "given" nnd "not given" ao
cording to his decisions thereon.
BRITISHERS ON MESSAGE
London, Dec. 4. The London dally
papers this morning, looking at
President Roosevelt's message from
the point of view of Its literary power
and tho wealth of weighty matters
discussed, regard It as one of the most
ciiaracterlstlc and .remarkable, mes
sages ever sent to Congress. At tho
same time tho papers recognlzo Its
conservative and buslncssltko moder
ation, and that no attompt has been
made, as tho Morning 1'ost remarks,
"to strlko an attitude or carrying his
listeners away,"
On tho whole, however, tho news
papers are skeptical of any great out
come from tho President's efforts in
the direction of reform of tho trusts,
nntl-anarchlsm or reciprocity, tho Idea
being that tho Senato will eficctually
step In and prevent nny great changes
In tho oxlstlng systems.
Most of the paporB remark upon the
tono of oxultatlon adopted by Presi
dent Roosevelt, In dealing with tho
cnnal question, but they do not show
tho slightest disposition to cavil
thereat.
No doubt Adjutant General Corbtn
Is In a frame of mind just now that
would load him to forgive even his
worst enemies. Pittsburg Qazettc.
Exhaustive Charge
TCt THE
By
Judge Estcc took Just ti'miartor of nn
hour In , delivering; his 'charge to the
Jury trying United, Stntcg b. Ulshop
Cstntc. Ho concluded nt I o'clock.
Mr. Kinney wanted the Court's reasons
for refusing certain requested Instruc
tlons, hut Judge Kstee fitnteil that ho
found hy the Btatjites of this Terri
tory that no reasons should be glen
and under the United States statutes
the statutes of the Territory snould lie
followed.
Mr. Dunne asked If hoth sides might
not enter exceptions to the charge as a
wnoic. juuge i.siee imti cumc uutusa
proceedings elsewhere that made him
think the course proposed might causa
tiotible in a higher court.
Mr. Klnne( noted exceptions to the
charge, with' special reference, tav.cer-1
turn portlns,lncmiiingrmo8 roianvo
to a falrjpubllc salo and the disregard
ing oMcases. r
Mr.-Dunne excepted, to various por
tions nnd especially to the refusal of
Instructions' requested by the Govern
ment. The Court answered a question by a
Juror, to the effect that tne Jury could
not make a que. lent verdict that la.
by dividing tho sum of diverse valua
tions In the Jury room by twelve.
There being no agreement of th4
Jury up to 7 o'clock, Judge Estee til
lccted them taken to the Hawaiian ho
tel for the night.
Judge Estee's instructions were ex
haustive and complete, and were al
lowed to bo token Into the Jury room
by the Jury. The Court referred first
to the scopo of the action, giving also
a description of tho land sought to bo
condemned, and stating that the ques
tion before tho Jury was, "What Is
the Just compensation to be paid by
the United States to tho owners there
of" He charged the Jury not to let the
circumstance of the United States be
ing a party have any weight upon the
value fixed. The Jury was also warn
ed against fixing any speculative value,
but the limit must be the actual condi
tion of tho property July 6, 1901.
"The burden of proving tho market
value of the Interest of the defendant
to the lands In question Is upon the
plaintiffs; in other words, the claim of
the plaintiff as to tho amount of 'com
pensation to bo nwarded defendant
must be proven by the plaintiff by a
preponderance of the evidence."
In considering the vnltio of Kuahua
Island, the Jury was told to tako Into
consideration the fact that It had nev
er been used for residence purposes,
and that the Island Is surrounded by a
lagoon and tho climate there Is exces
sively hot.
The Court further Instructed the Jury
as to tho different nnd wide range of
values placed upon the lands, and stat
ed that It must all be considered to
gether, and the honesty of all witness
es must be assumed until tho contrary
appears. Referring to the visit made
to tho land by the jury, ibe Court said:
"The knowledge so acquired may be
used by you In determining the weight
of conflicting testimony respecting the
value of tho land but not otherwise."
In concluding the charge to the Jury
Judge Estee summed up the entire
question as follows:
I have told you that tho fair market
value of the4 property as that property
actually stood on July C, 1901, should
be paid for It; and In this behalf I
charge you that what this property
would bring at a fair public sale, where
one party wants to sell and another
wnnts to buy, may be taken as a cri
terion of Its market value. But you
must understand that compensation Is
to be estimated In this case by the
actual rights acquired by the govern
ment, and not by the use which the
government may make of theso rights;
and therefore, I Instruct you, that the
fact that this property may be desired
by or necessary to the government, is
not to be considered by you In fixing
compensation.
I further instruct you that the actual
valuo of this property cannot be en
hanced by reason of tho projected im
provement for which It Is taken; for
this would simply bo to make the gov
ernment pay for an enhancement caus
ed by Its own work. And moreover,
tho willingness or unwillingness of the
Ulshop Estate to part with Its prop
erty Is not a proper element of value;
nor can you consider what the UlBhop
Estate would givo rather than bo de
prived of the property. As I have here
tofore said, you will, In determining
compensation, limit your attention to
the market valuo of the. ropcrty as It
actually stood on July C, 1901, and bo
guided solely by that.
Some evidence has been Introduced
by tho government showing certain
valuations sworn to and filed with tho
assessor, pursuant to tho require
ments of the Territorial statute in that
regard. Upon this subject, I charge
you that such sworn returns to the
assessor are called by law admissions
against Interest and are competent evi
dence tending to show the market
value of the property referred to there
in at that time. You, may therefore,
and Indeed It is your duty to consider
such returns nlong witn the other evi
dence In tho case bearing upon the
question of value, of this property,
I Instruct you also that the option
given by the defendants to the United
States for a portion only of the prop
erty now condemned, subject to exist
ing lensps held by the Honolulu Sugar
Company, Is to be considered by you
only along with all other evidence
bearing on the market value of tho
property condemned. Your duty is to
determine by your verdict the real nnd
true market value of the land In ques
tion on July C, 1901, by considering nil
the evidence bearing on that point.
The leases referred to In the trial of
this case have nothing to do with the
value of tho Interest of the Estate of
Dernlce Pauahl Ulshop, deceased, In
this land.
JURY
Judge Estee
The value of these lenses are to he
determined In the near future hy this
Court In another trial. You cannot set
tle the value of tho Interest of the
Illshoti Ustate therefore In the land In
question hy any reference to these
leases; therefore I Instruct J on to tils-
egard Bald leases entirely, In nrrlv
lng at the value of the Interest of tho
Ulshop Estate In this land
In rendering our Verdict you will
assess, by Itself, and as a separate
Item, tho market value on the Cth day
. of July last, of any improvements that
you may unit irom me ewtiencc to nne
been on the condemned premises nt
that date,
I further chnrgo you thnt no direct
and special benefit or benefits to that
portion of defendant's land not taken
nae been proven in this caso, nnd
you will theicforc, In arrUlng'nt tho
market value of tho portion taken,
make no deduction therefrom for bene
fits to the part not taken.
Gentlemen of the Jury, In arriving at
a crdlct In this case, It must be by the
unanimous assent of all your members.
Under the pleadings In this case, tho
complainant Is entitled to the condem
nation of the land described, nnd you
must find n crdlct In fnor of tho de
fendant for the market valuo of the
lands so condemned; because as I havo
heretofore stated, under tho constitu
tion of the United States, private prop
erty cannot be taken for a public uso
unless Just compensation Is paid there
for. I again finally Instruct you that you
arc to be the sole Judges of the facts In
the case. ESTEE, Judge.
