PRESIDENT ASKS
WAR Ofl AUSTRIA
Message to All the World
Outlining America's
Peace Ideal
Present German Govern
ment Impossible in
League of Honor ,
Washington, Dec. 4. President Wil
son delivered to Congress an address,
considered so Important in its rela
tions to International affairs, that It
has been transmitted in advance by
the Government to practically every
' other capital in the world.
Immediate declaration or war against
Austria-Hungary was recommended by
President WlUon.
, The President did not, however,
recommend a declaration of war
against Turkey and Bulgaria at this
time.
The President spoke, as follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress:
Eight months have elapsed since I
last had the honor of addressing you.
They have been months crowded with
events of Immense and grave sig
nificance for us. I shall not undertake
to detail or even to summarize those
vents. '
The practical particulars of the part
we have played in them will be laid be
fore you In the reports of the executive
departments. I shall discuss only our
present outlook upon those vast af
fairs, our present duties and the im
mediate means of accomplishing the
objects we shall hold always in view.
"Our Object la To Win the War."
I shall not go back to debate the
causes of the war. The intolerable
wrongs done and planned against us
by the sinister masters of Germany
have long since become too grossly
obvious and odious ' to every true
American to need to be rehearsed. But
I shall ask you to consider again and
with a very grave scrutiny our ob
jectives and the measures by which we
mean to attain them; for the purpose
of discussion here In this place Is
action and our action must move
straight toward definite alms.
Our object is, of course, to w,in the
war and we shall not slacken or suffer
ourselves to be diverted until It Is
won. But It Is worth while asking and
answering the question, When shall
we consider the war won?
Prom one point of view It Is not
necessary to broach this fundamental
natter. I do not doubt that the Ameri
can people know what the war Is about
and what sort of an outcome they will
regard as a realization of their pur
pose in It As a nation we are united
In spirit and intention.
"Let Dissenters Strut Their Uneasy
Hours."
I pay little heed to those who tell
me otherwise. I hear the voices of
dissent; who does not? I hear the
criticism and the clamor of the noisy,
thoughtless and troublesome. I bIbo
see men here and there Sing them
selves In Impotent disloyalty against
the calm, indomitable power of the
nation. I hear men debate peace who
understand neither its nature nor the
way we may attain It with uplifted
eyes and unbroken spirits. But I
know that none of these speaks for
the nation. They do not touch the
heart of anything. They may safely
be left to strut their uneasy hour and
be forgotten.
But from another point of view I
believe that It la necessary to say
plainly what we here at the seat of
action consider the war to be for and
what part we mean to play in the set
tlement of Its searching Issues. We
are the spokesmen of the American
people and they have a right to know
whether their purpose is ours. They
desire peace by the overcoming of
evil, by the defeat once for all of the
sinister forces that interrupt peace
and render it Impossible and they wish
to know how closely our thought runs
with theirs and what action we pro
pose. t
They are impatient with .those who
desire peace by any sort of com
promise deeply and indignantly im
patientbut they will be equally im
patient with us if we do not make it
plain to them what our objectives are
and what we are planning for In seek
ing to make conquest of peace by
arms.
"This Intolerable Thing Must Be
Crushed."
I believe that I speak for them,
when I say two things: First, that this
Intolerable thing of which the mas
ters of Germany have shown us the
ugly face, this menace of combined In
trlgue and force which we now see bo
clearly ss the German power, a thing
. without conscience or honor or capac-
ity for covenanted peace must be
crushed and, if it be not utterly
brought to an end, at least shut out
from the friendly Intercourse of the
nations; and second, that when this
thing and Its power are indeed defeat
ed and the time comes that we can
discuss peace when the German peo
ple have spokesmen whose word we
can believe and when those spokesmen
are ready in the name of their people
to accept the common Judgment of the
nations as to what shall henceforth be
SENT ALL OVER THE WORLD
All Known Means Of Communication
' To Spread Tha Message.
New York. President Wilson's ad
dress to Congress was heralded
throughout the world by the United
States Government The achievement
Is regarded aa .probably the greatest
publicity fest ever , undertaken. Dis
tribution of the message abroad was
personally directed (from this city by
Coorge Creel, chairman ot the Com
Rr'itee on Public Information.
the base of law of covenant for the
Ufa of the world we shall be willing
end glad to pay the full price for peace
and pay it ungrudgingly.
We know what that price will be.
It will be full, Impartial Justice Jus
tice done at every point, and to every
nation that the final settlement must
affect, our enemies, as weir as our
friends.
You catch, with me, the voices of
humanity that are In the air. They
grow dally more audible, mora articu
late, more persuasive, and they come
from the hearts of men everywhere.
They insist that the war shall not end
In vindictive action of any kind; that
no nation or people shall be robbed or
punished because the Irresponsible
rulers of a single country have them
selves dona deep and abominable
wrong. It Is this thought that has been
expressed In the formula, 'no annexa
tion, no contributions, no punitive In
demnities.' Juat because this crude formula ex
presses the Instinctive Judgment as to
right of plain men everywhere It has
been made diligent use of by the mas
ters of German intrigue to lead the
people of Russia astray and the peo
ple of every other country their agents
could reach, In order that a prematura
peace might be brought about before
autocracy has been taught Its final and
convincing lesson, and the people of
the world put in control of their own
destinies.
Autocracy Must Be Dethroned.
But the fact that a wrong use has
been made of a Just idea Is no reason
why a right use should not be made of
it. It ought to be brought under the
patronage of it real friends. Let It
be said again that autocracy must first
be shown the utter futility of its
claims to power or to leadership In the
modern world. It la impossible to ap
ply any standard of Justice so long as
such forces are unchecked and unde
feated as the present masters of Ger
many command.
Not until that has been done can
right be set up as arbiter and peace
maker among the nations. But when
that has been dona as, God, willing,
It assuredly will be we shall at last
be free to do an unprecedented thing
and this 1s the time to avow our pur
pose to do it We shall be free to
base peace on generosity and Justice,
to the exclusion of all selfish claims to
advantage even on the part of the vic
tors. Our Task la To Win the War.
Let there be no misunderstanding.
Our present-end Immediate task is to
win the war, and nothing shall turn
us aside from it until it is accom
plished. Every powor and resqurce we
possess, whether of men, of money
or of materials, is being devoted and
will continue to be devoted to that
purpose until it Is achieved.
Those who desire to bring peace
about before that purpose is achieved
I counsel to carry their advice else
where. We will not entertain It We
shall regard the war as won only when
the German people say to us, through
properly accredited representatives,
that they are ready to agree to a set
tlement based upon Justice and the
reparation of the wrongs their rulers
have done.
They have done a wrong to Belgium
which must be repaired. They have
established a power over other lands
and peoples than their own over the
great Empire of Austria-Hungary, over
hitherto free Balkan States, over, Tur
key and within Asia which must be
relinquished.
Teuton Allies Must Be Liberated.
Germany's success by skill, by in
dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise
we did not grudge or oppose, but ad
mired rather. She had built up for
herself a real empire of trade and In
fluence, secured by the peace of the
world. We were content to, abide the
rivalries of manufacture, science and
commerce that were involved for us
In her success and stand or fall as we
had or did not have the brains and
the initiative to surpass her.
But at the moment when she had
conspicuously won her triumphs of
peace she threw them away, to estab
lish in their stead what tLe world will
no longer permit to be established,
military and political domination by
arms, by which to oust where she
could not excel the rivals she most
feared and hated.
The peace we make must remedy
that wrong. It must deliver the once
fair lands and happy peoples of Bel
glum and Northern France from the
Prussian conquest and the Prussian
menace, but it must also deliver the
peoples of Austria-Hungary, the peo
ples of the Balkans and the peoples of
Turkey, alike In Europe and in Asia,
from the impudent and alien domina
tion of the Prussian military and com
mercial autocracy.
Does Not Wish To Meddle In Austria,
We owe it, however, to ourselves to
say that we do not wish in any way to
Impair or to rearrange the Austro-
Hungarlan Empire. It Is no affair of
ours what they do with their own life,
either industrially or politically. We
do not purpose or desire to dictate to
them In any way. We only desire to
see that their affairs are left in their
own hands In all matters, great , or
small. We shall hope to secure for
the peoples of the Balkan peninsula
and for the people of the Turkish Em
pire the right and opportunity .to make
their own lives safe, their own fortunes
secure against oppression or injustice
and from the dictation of foreign
courts or parties.
' And our attitude and purpose with
regard to Germany herself are of a
like kind.
Nearly every known means of com
municationexpress train, telephone,
telegram, wireless and submarine
cable was utilized In transmitting
the address. While an operator in
New York was clicking off its text
on a trans-continental wire direct to
San Fwncisco, where It was imme
diately relayed to the Orient, another
at his side was sending a Spanish
translation to Colon, Panama Canal
Zone, from where it radiated through
out Central and Southern American
Capitals.
It is estimated approximately 36.-
Intanil No Wrong Against German
Empire.
We Intend no wrong against tha
German Empire, po Interference with
her Internal affairs. We should deem
either the one or the other absolutely
unjustifiable, absolutely contrary to
the principles wa have professed to
live by and to hold most sacred
throughout our life as a nation.
The people of Germany are being
tnld by the men whom they now per
mit to deceive them and to act as their
masters that they are fighting for the
vry life and existence of their em
pire, a war of desperate self-defense
against deliberate aggression. Noth
ing could be more grossly or wantonly
fa'se, and we must seek by the utmost
openness and candor as to our real
alms to convince them of Its false
ness.
We are, In fact, fighting for their
emancipation from fear, along with
our own, from the fear as well as from
the fact of unjust attack by neighbors
or rivals or schemers after world em
pire. No one is threatening the exist
ence or the Independence of the peace
ful enterprise of the German Empire.
The worst that can happen to the
detriment of the German people is
this, that If they should still, after the
war Is over, continue to be obliged to
live under ambitious and Intriguing
masters interested to disturb the peace
of the world, men or classes of men
whom the other peoples of the world
could not trust, It might be impossible
to admit them to the partnership of
nations, which must henceforth guar
antee the world's peace.
"Must Be Partnership Of All Peoples."
That partnership must be a partner
ship of peoples, not a mere partner
ship of Governments. It might be Im
possible, also, !n such untoward cir
cumstances, to ad.nlt Germany to the
free economic Intercourse, which must
Inevitably spring out of the other part
nerships of a real peace. But there
would be no -aggression in that, and
such a situation,, inevitable because of
distrust, would in the very nature of
things sooner or later cure Itself by
processes which would assuredly
set In.
Wrongs Must Ba Righted.
The wrongs, the very deep wrongs,
committed in this war will have to be
lighted. That, of course. But they
cannot and must not be righted by the
commission of similar wrongs against
Germany and her allies. The world
will not permit the commission of simi
lar wrongs as a means of reparation
and settlement. Statesmen must by
this time have learned that the opin
ion of the world is everywhere wide
awake and fully comprehends the Is
sues Involved. No representative of
any self-governed nation will dare dis
regard It by attempting any such cov
enants of selfishness and compromise
as were entered Into at the Congress
of Vienna.
The thought of the plain people here
and everywhere throughout the world,
the people who enjoy no privilege and
have very simple and unsophisticated
standards of right and wrong, is the
air all Governments must henceforth
breathe If they would live.
No Opinions Of Their Own.
It Is in "the full disclosing light ot
that thought that all policies must be
conceived and executed in this mid
day hour of tha world's life.
German rulers have been able to
upset the peace of the world only be
cause the German people were not suf
fered under their tutelage to 'share the
comradeship of tha other peoples of
the world, either in thought or pur
pose. .
They were allowed to have, no opin
ion ot their own which might be set
up as a rule of conduct for those who
exercised authority over them. But
the congress that concludes this war
will feel the full strength of the tides
that run now In the hearts and con
sciences of free men everywhere. Its
conclusions will run with those tides.
All these things have been true from
the very beginning of this stupendous
war; and I cannot help thinking that
if they had been made plain at the
very outset the sympathy and en
thusiasm of the Russian people might
have been once for all enlisted on the
side of the Allies, suspicion and dis
trust swept away and a real and last
ing union of purpose effected.
Russian People Poisoned By Lies.
Had they believed these things from
the very moment of their revolution,
and had they been confirmed in that
belief since, the sad reverses which
have recently, marked the progress of
their affairs towards an ordered and
stable government of free men might
have been avoided. The Russian peo
ple have teen poisoned by the very
same falsehoods thnt have kept the
German people in the dark, and the
poison has been administered by the
very same hands. The only possible
antidote is the truth. It cannot be
uttered too plainly, nor too often.
From every, point of view, therefore,
it has seemed to be my duty to speak
these declarations of purpose, to add
these specific interpretations to what
I took the liberty of saying to the Sen
ate In January. Our entrance Into he
war has not altered our attitude to
ward the settlement that must come
when It is over. When I said in Jan
uary that the ' nations of the world
were entitled not only to free path
ways upon the sea, but also to assured
and unmolested access to those path
ways, I was thinking, and I am think
ing now, not of the smaller and weaker
nations alone, which need our counten
ance and support, but also of the great
and powerful nations, and of our pres
ent enemies as well as our present as
sociates in the war.
000 miles of telegraph and cable wires
were called into use in transmitting
the message. v
Chairman Creel received a copy of
the address In this city by special
courier from Washington. A corps of
typists was put at work In a locked
room to make duplicate copies. Mean
while, in an adjoining room, it was
being translated into French and
Spanish. These rooms were guarded
as a precaution against contents of
the message becoming public pre
maturely. Upon receiving word from Wash-
We Are 6oekina World Paaca.
I was thinking, and am thinking now
of Austria barrelf, among the rest, as
well as ot Serbia and ot Poland. Jus
tice and equality of rights can be had
only at a great price. Wa are seeking
permanent not temporary, founda
tion! for tha peace ot tha world and
must seek them candidly and fear
lessly. As always, the right will prove
to be the expedient
"What shall wa do then to push this
great war of freedom and justice to
its righteous conclusion? We must
clear away vlth a thorough hand all
impediments to success and we must
make every adjustment of law that will
facilitate the full and free use of our
whole capacity and force as a fight
ing unit
Declare War Immediately On Austria-
Hungary.
One very embarrassing obstacle that
stands In our way Is that wa are at
war with Germany, but not with her
allies. I therefore very earnestly
recommend that the Congress Imme
diately declare the United States in
a state of war with Austria-Hungary.
Does it seem strange to you that thla
should be the conclusion of tha argu
ment I have just addressed to you?
It ia not It Is, in fact, the inevitable
logic of what I have said. Austria
Hungary la for the time being not her
own mistress, but simply the vassal
of the German Government We must
face the facts as they are and act upon
them without sentiment In this stern
business. The Government of Aus
tria-Hungary ia not acting upon its own
initiative or in response to the wishes
and feelings of its own peoples, but
as the instrument of another nation.
Turkey and Bulgaria Also Germany's
Tools."
We must meet its force with our
own and regard the Central Powers aa
but one. The war can be successfully
conducted In no other way. The same
logic would lead also to a declaration
of war against Turkey and Bulgaria.
They also are the tools of Germany.
But they are mere tools and do not yet
stand in the direct path of our neces
sary action.
We shall go wherever the neces
sities of this war carry us, but it seems
to me that we should go only where
immediate and practical considerations
lead us, and not heed any others.
The financial and military measures
which must be adopted will suggest
themselves as the war and its under
takings develop, but I will take the
liberty of proposing to you certain
other acts of legislation which seems
to me to be needed for the support of
the war and for the release of our
whole force and energy.
It will be necessary to extend In cer
tain particulars the legislation of the
laat session with regard to alien
enemies; and also necessary, I believe,
to create a very definite and particular
control over the entrance and depar
ture of all persons Into and from the
United States.
To Restrain Female Aa Well Aa Mate
Enemies.
Legislation should be enacted defin
ing as a criminal offense every wilful
violation of the Presidential proclama
tion relating to alien enemies promul
gated under Section 4067 of the Re
vised Statutes and providing appro
priate punishment; and women as well
as men should be Included under the
terms of the Beta placing restraints
upon alien enemies. It Is likely that
as time goes on many alien enemies
will be willing to be fed and housed at
the expense of the Government in the
detention camps and it would be the
purpose of the legislation I have sug
gested to confine offenders among them
In penitentiaries and other similar In
stitutions where they could be made
to work as other criminals do.
