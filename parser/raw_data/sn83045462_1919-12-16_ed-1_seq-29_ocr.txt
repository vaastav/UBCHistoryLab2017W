SECRETARY BAKER BACK
FROM THE CANAL ZONE
Secretary Baker and party, includ
ing Mrs. Baker. Hen. March, chief of
start, and Gen. Chamberlain, inspector
general, returned to this city yester
day after an absence of exactly
two weeks. During that period thev
visited the Isthmus of Panama and
inspected the Panama canal and made
a short stop at San Juan, Por.to Hico,
on their way tiome. The trip was made
on the Army transport Great North
| ern.
"I have had a trip." said Secretary
j Baker at the War Department this
! morning as he was about to start
i to the Capitol, "both pleasant and
profitable. It was planned since the
time I became Secretary of War, be
cause of the interests and duties
which devolve on the War Depart
ment in the administration of the
Panama Canal Zone and Porto Rico.
The work done by the United States
at Panama is quite beyond praise or
description. During the past year the
canal has shown gratifying financial
returns and demonstrated that in ad
dition to being a great commercial
asset it is of priceless value as an
adjunct of our military defenses, and
in developing international good will.
Porto Rico is a rich and beautiful
country and will well repay a visit."

SENATE APPROVES
CONFEREE REPORT
ON FOnCREDIT
Senator Gronna, Registering
Protest, Wants Doubie
Stock Liability.
The Senate adopted today tlie con
ference report on the Edge bill au^
thorizing organization of corpora
tions to extend credit in Europe to
stimulate export trade. No record
vote was taken and the measure now
goes to the President.
Senatoj Gronna, republican, North
Dakota, of the Senate banking com
mittee, spoke in opposition to the
conference agreement.
Denying that the bill will regulate
foreign exchange, Senator Gronna
criticised the bill especially because
it fails to place upon stockholders of
proposed financing corporations the
double-value liability imposed on
stockholders of real banks.
"No Share for Public."
"In no way will the public share in
the huge profits of these corporations."
said Mr. Gronna, adding that he doubt
ed if the "ultra-patriots" organizing
the corporations would subscribe for
stock if their liability was doubled.
Chairman McLean, defending the
bill, declared that the financing com
panies must be placed on an equal
footing with other concerns already
organized, whose stock does not bear
the double liability.
Senator McLean urged approval of
the bill, declaring it is the least thai
can be done to assist re-establishing
European countries. Congress, he
said, should permit Americans to financ e
their export trade and thus relieve the
exchange situation.
That the bill will result in increas
ing American high cost of living was
asserted by Senator Gronna. declar
ing that it would send more Ameri
can prqducts abroad and decrease
supply for our own country.
Wall Street journals, the North Da
kota member said, have attacked him
for criticising the bill, and he added
that he regards the attacks as "a
certificate of honor."
"Not Trying: to Defeat BI1L"
Mr. Gronna said he was not trying
to defeat the bill, but wished to state
his position in favor of safeguarding
he legislation in behalf of American
interests. Denying that Congress can
ati'ect foreign exchange by any legis
lation, Senator Gronna said it should
take care that its acts do not give to
men of great wealth the power to dic
tate prices in this country and abroad,
and even to control politics.
Agreeing with Senator Gronna that
legislation cannot stop normal opera
tions of foreign exchange, Senator
Smoot, republican. Utah, predicted
that Germany must adopt new money,
and that Americans speculating in the
present German mark will lost all their
investments.
Urgent Deficiency Bill for
Employes' Compensation
and Health Reported.
| The urgent deficiency bill for the
j employes' compensation commission
and the public health service for th^>
fiscal year 1320, carrying a total of
S3,110,000,# was reported today by the
House committee on appropriations.
The first bill to come out of the
appropriations committee following
the statement by Chairman Good that
the strictest economy would be exer
cised shows that the estimate of $39,
500 for contingent expenses of the
employes' compensation commission
has been cut to $18,000, and the esti
mates of $1,250,000 for the compensa
tion fund have been, reduced to $].
100.000.
Even a harder slash has been given
to the estimates for the publitf health
service for the care of war risk in
sxirance patients and other benefici
aries. The estimates were for $6,000.
000 and the amount recommended in
the bill as reported $2,000,000. The
committee therefore whittled the to
tal estimates ilown'from $7,239,500 to
$3,110,000.
Chairman Explains.
Chairman Good, in making his re
port. pointed out that the amounts
recommended for the employes' com
pensation commission are necessary
to provide payment for claims for
compensation under the provisions of
the act of September 7, 1916. It is es
timated, he said, that at present rates
of payment and allowance of claims
the compensation fund will be ex
hausted by December 24. The differ
ence in the amount estimated by the
commission and the amount recom
mended by the appropriations com
mittee is due to elimination of that
portion of the estimates which provid
ed for the payment of compensation
claims to employes of .the United
States Shipping Board Emergency
Fleet Corporation in the event the
commission should take over that
work.
War Risk Provision.
He explained tllat the amount rec
ommended by the public health serv
ice is necessary for the war risk in
surance patients and other bencfl
ciaries entitled to care and treatment
by that federal agency. The sum of
$4,000,000 was appropriated for this
purpose in the sundry civil act ap
proved July 19, 1919. This fund is
practically exhausted and the esti
mated amount required to complete
the fiscal year of 1920 is $6,000,000. |
The committee recommends the imme- 1
diate appropriation of *2,000.000 to j
sustain the service until the total
needs for this purpose for the current j
fiscal year can be inquired into in
connection with the preparation of I
the next deficiency appropriation bill. I

INOCULATED MONKEYS
DEVELOP INFLUENZA
Tests were conducted recently at
the Army Medical School in this
city to ascertain the effect of in
fluenza on monkeys. Twelve sim
ians were inoculated with B. in
fluenzae under the direction of Maj.
F. O. Blake and Maj. R. L. Cecil,
M. C. It was shown that an acute
self-limited respiratory disease
identical with influenza in man in
its course, symptoms, complications
and pathology, was produced in the
monkeys. Tho inoculation was by
swabbing the upper respiratory
tract with .a culture of B. influenzae
isolated from a case of influenzal
pneumonia in man and subsequent
ly raised in virulence. The incu
bation period was three to six
hours. A similar result was ob
tained in ten monkeys inoculated
intratracheally. except that one
showed no signs of infection and
seven developed pneumonia, as
against only two in the previous
group. None of the twenty-two
monkeys died, except those killed
to study the pathology of the acute
stages of the disease.
RUMOR OF "LEAKS"
IN COURT RULINGS
IS UNJMQUIRY
Alleged That Advance In
formation Supplied Tips
in Stock Market.
Department of Justice officials con
t'?nuT? today investigation of reports
of alleged "leaks" on Supreme Court
decisions which were being used as
t!?S f?r stock speculation. A minor
official of the department and an at
tache of the Supreme Court were im
plicated in the charges, but Capt.
! Burke, chief of the bureau of investi
| gation of the Justice Department, de
clared that so far no basis for the
| charges hart been discovered.
| In a verbal statement last night
iCapt. Burke said that a "Mr. B. E.
Moses." with offices in the Munsey
building, Washington, had been re
ported by Mariin Pew, manager of the
International News Service, for an
alleged attempt to secure financial
backing from a friend of Pew to plav
the stock market on advance informa
tion of Supreme Court decisions.
Monn' Alleged Statement.
"Moses told P?w's friend," Capt.
! Burke said, "that he had been doing
! this for some time, but he did not have
sufficient funds to make the profit he
might make if.he had financial back
ing. The friend of Pew insisted that
before he could get the finances which
Moses desired he would have to be
convinced that advance information
on the Supreme Court decision was
absolutely obtainable. He told him
that on November 26 the man who
furnished him (Moses) was employed
in the Department of Justice in Wash
ington. Furthermore, this man was
with Moses in New York on Sunday,
November 16, and that on Monday
morning they went down town and
played Southern Pacific nhort, closing
out when Southern Pacific dropped
three points. They made some money,
but they did not say how much. Later
Southern Pacific was being played the
other way, so obviously they had cor
rect information on the court's de
cision in the Southern Pacific oil land
cases.
Make Denial When Questioned.
Moses was interrogated by William
Flynn, director of the bureau of in
vestigation of the Department of Jus
? tice, Capt. Burke said, and d(-nied that
I he was getting his information from
, a minor official of the Department o<
! Justice, as was claimed, or that the
I latter was getting it in turn from
an attache of the Supreme Court,
j Moses, according to Burke, said he
, had made his deductions on the fu
ture movements of the stock as any
I lawyer might have done from the
general information on the Southern
j Pacific case. He denied also there
j was a leak in the Supreme Court.
? Capt. Burke said the official in ques
tion holds a minor position inv the
: Department of Justice, and that he
?denied he knew any one in the Pu
: preme Court who would give out any
such information or that he had been
, in any such deals as were charged.
"The attache of the Supreme Court
! denies also that he had any connec
; tion with the affair and there is noth
I ing to show that he did." Capt. Burke
added.'
However, he slid, the investigation
will be continued.
Ju at lee Bran del* Reticent.
Associate Justice Brandeis, who
wrote and delivered the prohibition
opinion yesterday 'n the court, de
clined today to comment upon reports
of a leak.
James D. Maher. clerk of the Su
preme Court, denied today that there
was any "leak" in his office on the
court's prohibition decision yesterday
and said he knew nothing of an in
vestigation being made by the De
partment of Justice.
PLANS GO FORWARD
TO RETURN ROADS
New recommendations from Di
rector General Hines as to the return
of the railroads to private control are
before President Wilson. NeltherMr.
Hines nor White House officials will
say what the recommendations are or
whether they advocate a departure
from the President's announced pur
pose to return the roads by January
1. Nor has there been any indication
as to when the President will issue a
proclamation surrendering the roads
or announce a change in his plans.
Some administration officials be
lieve the fate of railroad legislation
in Congress will be a determining
factor in whatever is done. Manv
officials think it would be disastrous
industrially to surrender the roads
without adequate legislation to meet
their changed status.
I'lan to Return llouda.
Meantime, however, preparations are
going forward at the railroad admin
istration for turning the roads back
in accordance with the decisions an
nounced by President Wils<A in his
message to Congress last May. Ma
terials ordered on contract are being
obtained as far as possible before
the first of the New Tear. Office con
tracts of the railroad administration
contain a thirty-day release clause, so
they can ? be given up at any time
without great loss.
Surrender of the roads would make
little difference in actual operation, in
the opinion of officials, as the lines
now are being operated by their own
employes, and except for a shift in
reports there would be little change.
The legal and accounting divisions
of the railroad administration prob
ably will be materially increased when
the roads are surrendered, to wind up
the government accounts with the
corporations, but the other divisions
will go out of existence quickly,
officials said.
Ready to Release Ronda.
Everything is in readiness at the
railroad administration for immedi
ate return of the railroads to private
control directly government control of
the roads is relinquished, it was said
today.
Committees of experts of the rail
road administration have been in con
stant consultation for three months
straightening out accounts and in
various ways preparing the return of
the roads to their owners. It i^felt
that return of the roads on January
1, 1S20, would be accomplished with
out any hitch.
PARENTS' BODY IS
ANTI-VANSCHA1QK
President of Colored Asso
ciation Details Objections
to Appointment.
Opposition to the appointment of
Rev. Dr. John Van Schaick. jr.. as
District Commissioner on the count*
of his politics, of his not being a resi
dent of the District, and of his prob
able lack of judicial attitude in con
troversies involving the interests of
all citizens, is voiced in a letter of
protest received yesterday by Senator
Sherman, chairman of the Senate Dis
trict committee, written on behalf of
the Colored Parents' Association. The
letter was written by Mrs. F. S. Tan
ner. 1444 Q street northwest, presi
dent of the organization, who this
morning received an acknowledg
ment thereof from Senator Sherman.
Letter "i'roiMti Kamcatly."
The letter sets forth that the
"earnest protest" comes from an as
sociation having: a membership of
more than 25.000 and arranges its
objections as follows:
"1. Because the law governing the
appointment of Commissioners from
civil life positively provides that one
of the Commissioners shall be a re
publican and one a democrat. Mr.
Brownlow. now holding the office. *
a democrat, and should Uev. Van
Schaick be confirmed there will he
two democrats holding the office,
which would be contrary to law.
"2. The Rev. Van Schaick is not
such n resident of the District of
Columbia as is contemplated in sec
tion 19 of the act of Congress, ap
proved July 11, 1878 (20 Stats.. 103 )
"3. Because we believe Ttev. Van
Schaick is not a man who can be de
pended upon to act fairly in any con
jtroversy that might come before him
| where the interest* of all the citizens
are involved, as will be clearly shown
'by reference to the majority and mi
nority report of the fpeoial commit
tee appointed, at the instance of the
Parents' League, to investigate Roa
coe C. Bruce, assistant superintendent
in charge of the colored schools of
the District of Columbia."
Asks for Hearinc
In conclusion the letter of the
league asks that some of its officers
may be allowed to be heard by the
District committee before the ap
; pointment is confirmed.
j "I have your letter of this morning."
Senator Sherman wrote in reply, "l
' note your protest against Rev. Van
Schaick and will give it attention
| when the matter comes before the
Senate."
TO FIGHT CONFIRMATION
| OF REV. DR. VAN SCHAICK
) Piney Branch Citizens to Voice
Again Opposition to His Public
Preferment'
j Steps to oppose the confirmation
j of Rev. Dr. John Van Schaick, jr.. as
: District Commissioner were taken
I last night by the executive commit
! tee of the Piney Bra:ich Citizens' As
j sociation. E. B. Henderson, presi
i dent of the association, appointed a
! committee to appear before the Sen
1 ate District committee and voice the
i opposition of the organization to Dr.
Van Schaick's appointment.
The special committee Is made up
j of the following: George A. Finch.
. Ix)uis G. Julihn. Charles P. McCurdv
; and S. T, Cameron.
| This is not the first time that the
i Piney Branch association has record
: ed itself in opposition to the ap
| pointment of Df. Van Schaick. At
: the regular meeting on May 12 last
i a resolution was adopted protesting
against his appointment to the board
' of education. Several years ago. It
J iras pointed out, when the residents
! of Piney Branch Park were con test
I ing the location in their midst of the
I proposed municipal hospital, it was
' charged that Dr. Van Schaick ?P
i posed their interference and wrote
' a letter to the association in criti
cism of its attitude.
PLAN DDE APRIL 1
i Witnesses at Hearing Favor
i Bureau Within the Presi
dent's Office.
Its findings already delayed by the
rule of the Senate that gave the right
of way to the treaty, the Senate spe
cial budget, committee voted today to
make its report returnable April 1.
The time originally fixed was Decem
ber 1. Members of the committee be
1 lieve it will be possible, however, to
make the report in January.
Hearings were continued today with
; John T. Piatt, chairman of the board
jot directors of the national budget
committee, and William K. WillouRii
| by, director of the institute for gov
ernment research, as witnesses. Both
?advocated the creation of a budget
i bureau within the office of the Presi
(dent and of placing final res-ponsibil
i ity upon the President.
i Mr. Pratt presented in the name of
i the directors of the national budget
1 committee their conception of a leg
I islative act. which differs materially
' from the McCormick bill only in th?
; placing of the bureau in the Presi
dent's office. The McCormick bill
would place it In the Treasury. Mem
bers of the committee which indorsed
the plan suggested by Mr. Pratt are
Paul Warburg. Henry M. Stimson, Jo
seph Cotton. Benjamin Strong and
Samuel McCune Lindsay.
Mr. Willoughby, who was a member
j of the VTaft commission on economy
! and efficiency, supported in the main
features the plan suggested t?v Mr
Pratt. Gov. Lowden. who t. jtified
yesterdav. advocated the plan to place
the budget work in the Treasury,
but he too. would have the President
held responsible. To place the bureau
in the Treasury, Mr. Pratt said,
"would remove it one step from di
rect presidential responsibility."
?l provision in the legislative act
suggested bv Mr. Prait would prevent
the addition of a legislative rider to
any appropriation bill or the addition
of an appropriation rider to any legis
lative bill. He would also make pro
vision for the enforced appearance be
fore a committee of the whole of an>
cabinet officer to explain or to defend
estimates made.
