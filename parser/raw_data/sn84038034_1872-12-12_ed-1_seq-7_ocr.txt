PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
To the Senate and House of Representatives i
In transmitting to you. my fourth annual
message, it is with thankfulness to tne Giver
-of all good, that as a nation we hard bean
blessed for the last year with peace at home
and abroad, and a general prosperity vouch
safed to but few people. With the exception
of the recent devastating fires which swept
from earih with a breath, as it were, millions
of accumulated wealth in the cily of Boston,
there has been no overshado viiig calamities
within tbe year to record. It is gratifying
to note how liiie their fellow citizeus of
the city of Chicago, under similar circum
stances, a year earlier, the citizens of Boston
are rallying under their misfortunes, and the
prospect is that their energy and persever
ance will overcome all obstacles, and show
the same prosperity soon that they would
have have had had no disaster befallen them.
Otherwise, we have been free from pesti
lence, war, and the calamities which often
overtake nations. And, as far as human judg
ment can penetrate the ; future, no cause
seems to exist to threaten our present peace.
When Congress adjourned in June last, a
question had been raised by Great Britain,
and was then pending, which for a time se
riously imperilled the settlement by friendly
arbitration of the differences existing be
tween this Government and that of her
Britannic Majesry, which, by the Treaty of
Washington, had been referred to the tri
bunal of arbitration which had met at Geneva,
in Switzerland. The arbitrators, however,
disposed of the question which had jeopard
ized the whole of tho treaty, and threatened
to involve the two nations in most unhappy
relations toward each other, in a manner en
tirely satisfactory to this Government and in
accordance with the views and the policy
which it had maintained. The tribunal which
had convened in Geneva, in December, con
cluded its laborious session on the 14th day
of September last, on which day, having
availed itself of the discretionary power given
to it by the treaty to award a sum in gross, it
made "its decision whereby it awarded the
sum of 15.000,000 in gold, as the indemnity
to be paid by Great Britain to the United
States for the satisfaction of all the claims
referred to its consideration. This decision,
happily, disposes of a long standing difference
between two Governments, and in connection
-with another award made by the German Em
peror under a reference to him by the same
-treaty, leaves the two Governments withont
.a shadow upon the friendly relations which it
is my sincere hope may forever remain
remain equally unclouded.
The report of the agent of the United
States, appointed to attend the Geneva tri
bunal, accompanied by tbe protocols of tbe
proceedings of the arbitrators, the arguments
of the counsel of both Governments, tbe
award of the tribunal, and the opinions given
by the several arbitrators, is tiansmitted here
with. I ,have caused to be transmitted to the
heads of the three friendly powers who com
plied with the joint request made to them
under the treaty the thanks of this Govern
ment for the appointment of arbitrators made
by them respectively, and also my thanks to
the eminent personages named by theai, and
my appreciation of the dignity, patience, im
partiality, and great ability with which they
discharged their arduous and high functions."
Her Majesty's Government has communi
cated lo me the appreciation by her Majesty
of the ability and indefatigable" industry dis
played by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator named
on the part of this Government, during the
protracted inquirios aid discussions of the
tribunal. I cordially unite with her Majesty
in this aopreciation
It is due to the agent of the United States
before the tribunal, to record my appreciation
cf the marked ability, unwearied patience,
and the prudence tnd discretion with which
he has conducted the very responsible and
-delicate duties committed" to him. And
it is also due to the learned and eminent
counsel who attended the tnbunal on the part
of this Government, to express my sense of
the talent and wisdom which thev brought to
bear in the argument of the lesult so happily
reached. It will be the province of Congress
to provide for the distribution, a aong those
who are entitled to it, of their respective
shares of the money to be paid.
Although the sum awarded is not payable
until -the year from the date of the award, it
is deemed advisable that no time be lost in
making a proper examination of the several
cases in which indemnification may he due. I
consequently reoommend the creation of a
Board of Commissioners for the purpose. By
the thirty-fourth article of the Treaty of
Washington the respective claims of the
United States and of Great Britain in their
construction of the treaty of the 15th June
1S46, defining the boundary line between their
respective territories, were submitted to the
arbitration and award of his Majesty the Em
peror of Germany, to decide which of these
claims is most in accordance with the true in
terpretation of the treaty of-1846. His Ma
jesty the Emperor of Germany having been
pleased to undertake the arbitration has the
earnest thanks of this Government and of the
United States for the labor, pains and care
which he has devoted to the consideration of
this long-pending difference. I have caused
an expression of my thanks to be communi
cated to his Majesty. Mr. Bancroft, the
representative of this Government at Berlin
-conducted the case and prepared the state
ment on the part of the United States with
the ability that his past service justified the
public in expecting at his hands. As a mem
ber of Cabinet at the date of treaty which has
given rise to the discussion between the Gov
ernments ; as the Minister to Great Britain
whn the construction now pronounced un
founded was first advanced, and as the agent
and representative of the Government to
present the case and receive the award, he
una uceu usbuc.aicu witn tne question in all of
its phases, and in every stage has manifested
a patriotic zeal and earnestness in mainten
ance of the claim of the United States. He
is entitled to much credit for the success
which has attended the submission. A fter a
patient investigation of the case and of the
statements of each party, his Majesty the
Emperor of Germany, on the 21st day of Octo
ber last, signed his award in writing, decree
ing that the claim of the Government of the
United States that the boundary line between
the territories of her Britannic Majesty and
the United States should be drawn through
the Haro Channel, is most in accordance with
the true interpretation of the treaty concluded
on the 15th of June. 1846. between the agents
of her Britannic Majesty and of the United
Sates. Copies of the case presented on be
half of each Government and of the state
ment in reply to; each, and a translation of
the award, are transmitted herewith. This
award confirms the United States in their
claim to the important archipelago of islands
lying between the continent and Vancouver's
eland, which for twenty-sis years, ever since
the ratification of the treaty, Great Britain
.has contested, and leaves us, for the first
time in the history of the United States as a
nation, without a question of disputed" bound
ary between our territory and the possessions
of Great Britain on the continent.
It is my grateful duty to acknowledge the
prompt, spontaneous action of her Majesty's
-Government in givir g effect to the award. In
anticipation of any reqnest from tms Govern
ment, and before the reception in the United
States of the award signed by the Bmperor
her Majesty had given instructions for the
removal of her troops, which had been sta
. iioned there, and for the cessation of all ex
ercise or claim of jurisdiction, bo as to leave
the United States in exclusive possession of
, the lately disputed territarv. I am einfofni
to be able to announce that the orders for
the removal of the troops have been exe
cuted, and the military ioint ocennation nf
-San Juan has ceased.-' The islands are now in
the exclusive possession of the United States.
It now becomes necessary to complete the
survey nd determination of that portion of
the boundary line throneh t,h Ham rhannnl
npon which the. Commission which deter
mined the remaining part of the line were un
Me to agree. ..; " ; ,
J I recommend tha'appomimeni of a Com-
j iineaion it- act jointly wita one which may be
named by her Majesty for that
perience of tbe difficulties attending the de-
i.. uiuiouvu via auuubbou ii no oi Dounu&ry,
after th occupation of the territory and its
settlement by thse owinc alieeiancA t t,
respective IJoverBmenta, points to the im-
IJurianceoiesiaoiisaiug, Dy natural objects
or other monuments, the actual line between
the territory acquired by purchase from Rus
sia, and the' adjoining possessions of her
Britannic Majesty. The region is now so
sparsely occupied that no conflicting interests
of individuals, or of jurisdiction, are likely
to interfere to the delay or embarrassment of
the actual location of the line. If deferred
until population shall enter and occupy the
territory, some trivial contest of neighbors
may again array the two Governments in an
tagonism. I therefore recommend the ap
pointment of a commission to act jointly with
one that may be appointed on the part of
Great Britain, to determine the line between
our Territory of Alaska and the co-terminoug
possessions of Great Britain. .
In my last annual message I recommended
the legislation necessary on the pare of the
United States to bring into operation the ar
sooner attended to. To this end I recommend
that a sufficient appropriation be made.
With France, our earliest ally ; Russia, the
constant and steady friend of the Uni
ted States ; Germany, with whose Govern
ment and peaple we have so many causes of
friendship, and so many common sympathies,
and the other powers of Europe, our relations
are maintained on the most friendly terms.
Since my last annual message the exchange
has been made of the ratification of a treaty
with the Austro-Hungary Empire, relating to
naturalization ; also of a treaty with the Gei
man Empire, respecting Consuls and trade
marks ; also of a treaty with Sweden and Nor
way, relating to naturalization , all of which
treaties have been duly proclaimed.
Congress, at its last session, having made
an appropriation to defray the expenses of
Commissioners on the part of the United
States to the International and Statistical Con
gress at St. Petersburg, the persons appoint
ed in that character proceeded to their desti
nation and attended the sessions of the Con
gress. Kepoits shall in due season be laid be
fore you. This Congress meets at intervals
of about three years, and has held its sessions
in several of the countries of Europe. I sub
mit to your consideration the propriety of ex
tending an invitation to the Congress to hold
its next meeting in the United States. The
centennial celebration, to be held in 1876,
would afford an appropriate occasion for such
a meeting.
Preparations are making for the Interna
tional Exposition, to be held during the next
year in Vienna, on a scale of very great mag
nitude. The tendency of these expositions is
in the direction of advanced civilization and
the elevation of industry, of labor, and the in
crease of human happiness, as well as of
greater intercouise and good-will between na
tions. As this exposition is to be the first
which will have been held in Eastern Europe,
it is believed that American inventors and
manufacturers will be ready to avail them
selves of the opportunity for the presenta
tion of their productions, if encouraged by
proper aid and protection. At the last session
of Congress authority was given for the ap
pointment of one or more agents to represent
this Government at the Exposition. The au
thority thus given has been exercised, but in
the absence of any appropriation there is
danger that the important benefits which the
Exposition offers will, m a large degree, be
lost to citizens of the Umted States. I com
mend the subject strongly to your considera
tion, and recommend that an adequate appro
priation be made for the purpose. To fur
ther aid the American exhibitors at the Vienna
Exposition, I would recommend, in addition
to an appropriation of money, that the Secre
tary of tho Navy be authorized to fit up two
naxal vessels to transport between our Atlan
ta tit ic cities and Trieste, or the most con
venient port to Vienna, and back, their articles
for exhibition.
Since your last session, the President of the
Mexican Bepubhc, distinguished by his high
charactered by his services to his country,
has died. His temporary successor has now
been elected with great unanimity by th9 peo
pele a proof of confidence on their part in
his patriotism and wisdom, which, it is be
lieved, will be confirmed by the results of his
administration.
It is particularly desirable that nothing
should be left undone Dy the Government of
either Republic to strengthen their relatiions
as neighbors and friends. It is much to be
regretted that many lawless acts continue to
disturb the quiet of the settlements on the
border between our territory and that of
Mexico, and that complaints of wrong to
American citizens m various p'rta of the conn
trp are made. The revoiutionarycondition in
which the neighboring Kepublic has ao long
been involved has, in some degree, contribu
ted to this distrrbance. It is to be hoped
that with a more settled rule of order through
out the Republic, which may be expected from
the present Government, the acts of which
just complaint is made will cease.
The proceedings of the Commission under
the convention with Mexico of the 4th of July,
1868, on the subject Of claims, have unfortu
nately been checked by an obstacle, for the
removal of which measures have been taken
by the two Governments which, it is believed,
will prove successful. The Commissioners ap
pointed pursuant to the joint resolution of
Congress of the 7th of May last, to inquire
into depredations on the Texas frontier, have
diligently made investigations in that quar
ter. Their report upon the subject will be
communicated to you. Their researches were
necessarily incomplete, partly on account of
tbe limited appropriation made by Congress.
Mexico, on the part of that Government, has
appointed a similar Commission to investigate
these outrages. It is not announced officially,
but the press of that country states that the
fullest investigation is desired, and that the
co-operation of all parties concerned is invited
to Becure that end. I therefore recommend
that a special appropriation be made, at the
earliest day practicable, to enable the Com
missioners on the part of the United States to
return to their labors without dely.
It is with regret that I have again to an
nounce a continuance of the disturbed condi
tion of the Island of Cuba. No advance to
ward the pacification of the discontented por
tion of the population has been made, while
the insurrection has gained no advantages,
and exhibits no more of thtfelements of power
or of tho prospect of ultimate success than
were exhiDited a year ago. Spain, on the
other band, has not succeeded in repression,
ana me parties stana apparently in tne same
relative attitude which they have occupied for
a long time past. This contest has lasted now
tor more man four years. Were it seen at a
distance from our neighborhood we might be
indifferent to its result, although humanity
could not be unmoved by many of its inci
dents whenever they might occur. It is, how
ever, at our door. I cannot doubt that the
continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is
among the strongest inducements to the con
tinuance of this strife. A terrible wrong is the
natural cause of a terrible evil. The abohtion
of slavery and the introduction of other re
forms in the administration of the Govern
ment in Cuba could not fail to advance the
restoration of peace and order. It is espe
cially to be hoped that the present liberal
Government of Spain will voluntarily adopt
this view. The law of emancipation, which
was passed more than two years since, has re
mained unexecuted in the absence of regula
tions for its enforcement. It was but a feeble
step toward emancipation, but it was the
recognition of right, and was hailed as such,
and exhibited Spam in harmony with the senti
ments of humaaity and of justice, and in sym
pathy with the other powers of the Christian
and civilized world. Within the past few weeks
the regulations for carrying out the laws of
emancipation have been announced, giving
evidence of the sincerity of the intention of
the present Government to carry into effect
the law of 1870. I have not f aUed to urge
the consideration of the wisdom, the policy,
and the justice of a more effective system for
the abolition of the great evil which has op
pressed a race and continues a bloody and de
structive contest close to our border, aa well
as the expediency and the justice of conced
ticlas of the Treaty of Washington, of May,
1871, relating to the fisheries, and to other"
matters touching the relations of the United
States toward the British North American pos
sessions, to become operative as soon as the
proper legislation should be had on the part
of Great Britain and the possessions. That
legislation on the part of Great Britain and
its possesions had not then been bad, and
during the session of Congress a nuestion was
raised, which for the time raised a doubt
whether any action by Consrress in the direc
tion indicated would become important a
question which has since been disposed of,
and I have received notice that the Imperial
Parliament and the Legislatvire of the Pro
vincial Government have passed laws to carry
the provisions of the treaty on the matters
referred to into operation. I therefore
recommend your early adoption of the legis
lation in the same direction necessary on the
part of this Government.
The Joint Commission for determining the
boundary line between the United States and
the British possessions, between the Lake of
the Woods and the Rocky mountains, has or
ganized and entered upon its work. It is de
sirable that the force be increased, in order
that the completion of the Burvey and the de
termination of the boundary line may be
ing reforms of which the propriety is uot
questioned. Deeply impressed with thn con
viction that the continuance of slavery is one of
the most active causes of the continuance of
the unhappy condition in Cuba, I regret to
believe that citizens of the United States, or
those claiming to be such, aie large holders
in Cuba of what is there claimed as property,
but which is forbidden and denounced by the
laws of the United States. They are thus, in
defiance of the spirit of our laws, contributing
to the continuance of this distressing and
sickening contest. In my last annual message
I referred to this subject, and I again recom
mend such legislation as may be proper to de
nounce, and, if net prevent, at least to dis
courage American citizens from holding or
dealing in slaves.
It is gratifying to announce tha t the rati
fication of the convention concluded under the
auspices of this Government, between Spain
on the one hand and the Allied Republics of
the Pacific on the other, providing for an
armistice, have been exchanged. A copy of
the instrument in herewith submitted. It is
hoped that this nay be followed by a perma
nent peace between the same parties.
The differences which at one time threat
ened the maintenance of peace between
Brazil and the Argentine Republic, it is
hoped, are in the way of satisfactory adjust
ment with these States, as with the Republics
of Central and Southern America we continue
to maintain the most friendly relations. It is
with regret, however, I announce that the
Governor of Venezuela has mat!e no further
payments on account of the awards under the
Convention of the 25th of April, 1855. That
Republic is understood to be now almost, if
not quite, tr annuitized. It is hoped, there
fore, that it will lose no time in providing for
the unpaid balances of its debt to the United
States, which having originated in injuries to
its citizens by the Venezuelan authorities, and
having been acknowledged pursuant to a
treaty in the most solemn form known among
nations, would seem to deserva a preference
over debts of a different origin and contracted
in a different manner. This subject is ear
nestly recommended to tho attention of Con
gress for snch action as may be deemed
proper.
Our treaty relations with Japan remain un
changed. An imposing embassy from that
interesting and progressive nation visited this
country during the year thaf is passing, but
being unprovided with power for the siscing
of a convention in this country, no conclusion
in that direction was reached. It is hoped,
however, that the interchange of opinions
which took place during their stay in this
country had led to a mutual appreciation of
the interests which may be promoted when
the revision of the existing treaty shall be
undertaken.
In t'lis connection I renew my recommenda
tion of one year ago. that to give importance
and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic
relations with Japan and China, and to further
aid in maintaining the good opinion of these
people, and secure to the United States its
share of the commerce destined to flow be
tween these nations and the balance of the
commercial world, an appropriation be made
to support at least four American youths in
each of these countries, to serve as a part of
the official family of our Ministry there. Our
representatives would not even then be placed
upon an equality with the representatives of
Great Britain or some other powers. As now
situated, our representatives in Japan and
China have to depend for interpreters and
translators upon natives of those countries
who know our language imperfectly, or pro
cure for the occasion the services of employes
in foreign business houses, or the interpreters
to other foreign Ministers.
I renew the recommendation made on a
previous occasion of tbe transfer to the De
partment of the Interior, to which they seem
more appropriately to belong, of all the
powers aDd duties in relation to the terri
tories with which the Department of State is
now charged by law or by custom.
Congress, from the beginning of the Gov
ernment, has wisely made provision for the
relief of distressed seamen in foreign coun
tries. No similar provision, however, has
hitherto been made for the relief of citizens
in distress abroad other than seamen. It is
understood to be CHstomary with other Gov
ernments to authorize Consuls to extend such
relief to their citizens or subjects in certain
cases. A similar authority and an appropria
tion to carry it into eff ?ct are commended in
cases of citizens of the United States sick,
under such circumstances. It is well known
that such citizens resort to foreign countries
in great numbers ; though most of them are
able to bear the expenses incidental to loco
motion, there are some who, through accident
or otherwise, become penniless, and have no
friends at home able to succor them. Per
sons in this situation must either perish, cast
themselves upon the charity of foreigners, or
be relieved ac the private charge of our
officers, who, usually, even with the most
benevolent disposition, have nothing to spare
for such purposes. Should the authority and
the appropriation asked for be given, care
will be taken to carry the beneficence of Con
gress into effect, that it shall not be un
necessarily or unworthily bestowed.
The net reduction of the principal of the
debt during the fiscal year ending June 30,
1872. was $90,960,253.54. The source of the
reduction is as follows : Net ordinary re
ceipts during the year, 8364,694,229.91 ; net
ordinary expenditures, including interest on
public debt, $270,659,695.91 ; total, $94,134,
534.54. Add amount of receipta from premium
on sales of gold, in excess of the premiums
paid on bonds purchased, 2,454.470.89. Add
amount of reduetion of the cash bal
ance at the close of the year, accom
panied with the sales at the commencement
of the year. 3,371,348.65; total, $99,960,353.54.
This statement treats solely of the principal
of the public debt. By the monthly state
ment of the public debt, which adds together
me principal ana interest aue ana unpaid and
the interest accrued to date due, and deducts
the cash in the Treasury, accordingly on the
day of publication the reduction was $100,
544,491.98. The source of this reduction is
as follows : Reduction in principal account,
$99.960,003.55 ; reduction in unpaid interest
account, $3,330,952.96 ; total, $103,290,956.50.
Bednction in cash in hand. $2,746,465.22 ; to
tal, $100,544,491.28. On the basis of the last
table the statements show a reduction of the
public debt from the 1st of March, 1869, to
the present time, as follows : from March
1, 1869, to March 1, 1870, $87 134.782.84 ; from
March 1, 1870, to Merch 1, 1871, $177,819,650,
25 ; from March 1, 1871, to March 1, 1872,
$94,895.348.94 ; from March 1, 1872, to Novem
bor 1. 1872. eight months, $64,047,237.84. To
tal, $363,696,999.87. With the greut reduc
tion of taxation by the acts of Congress at its
last session, tha expenditure of tho Govern
ment in collecting the revenue will be much
reduced for the next fiscal year. It is very
doubtful, however, whether any further re
duction of so vexatious a burdeu on any peo
ple will be practicable for the present. At all
events, as a measure of justice to the holders
of the nation's certificates of indebtedness. I
would recommend that no more legislation be
had on the subject unless it be to correct er
rors of omission or commission in the present
laws, until sufficient time has elansed' to
prove that it can be done and still have suffi
cient revenue to meet the current expenses of
the Government, pay interest on the public
debt, and provide for the sinking fund estab-
usneu oy law. xne preservation or our na
tional credit is of the highest imnortance
Next in importance to this comes a solemn
duty to provide a national currencv. of fixed.
unvarying value as compared with" gold ; and
as soon as practicable, having due regard for
the interests of the debtor class and thn
vicissitudes of trade and commerce, and con-
veruDie into goici at par.
' The report of the Secretary of War shown

tne nscai year ending june su, 1871, to be
$35,799,991.82 ; and for the fiscal year ending
Juns 30, 1872, to be $35,372,157.20, showing
a reduction in favor of the last fiscal year of
8427,834.62.
The attention of Congress will be called
during its present session to various enter
prises for the more certain and cheaper trans
portation of the constantly increasing surplus
of the Western and Southern products to tho
Atlantic seaboard. The subject is one that
will force itself upon the legislative branch
of the Government sooner or later, and I sug
gest, therefore, that immediate steps betaken
to gain all available information to insure
equitable and just legislation. The ronte to
connect the Mississippi Valley with the Atlan
tic, at Charleston, S. C, and Savannah, Ga.,
by water, by the way ol the Ohio and Tennes
see rivers, and canals, and slack water naviga
tion to the Savannah and Ocmulsee rivers,
has been surveyed and report made by an ac
complished engineer of the army. Second
and third n jw routes will be proposed for the
consideration of Congress, namely, by an ex
tension of the Kanawba and James river canal
to the Ohio, and by extension of tho Chesa
peake and Ohio canal. 1 am not prepared to
recommend Government aid to these or other
enterprises, until it is clearly shown that they
are not only of national interest, but that
when completed they will be of a value com
mensurate with their cost. That production
increases more rapidly than the means of
transportation in our country, has been de
monstrated by past experience. That the un
precedented growth in population and pro
ducts of the whole country will require ad
ditional facilities and cheaper means for the
more bulky articles of commerce to reach the
tide water and a market will be demanded in
the near future is equally demonstrable. I
would therefore suggest either a committee
or commisioner be authorized to consider this
whole question, and to report to Congress at
some future day for its better guidance in
legislating on the important subject. The
railroads of the country have been rapidly ex
tended during tbe last few years to meet the
growing demands of producers, and reflect
much credit upou the capitalists and mana
gers engaged in their construction. In addition
to these, a project to facilitate commerce by
the building of a ship canal around Niagara
Falls on the United States side, which
has been agitated for many years, will no
doubt be called to your attention this session.
Looking to the great future of the country and
the increasing demands of commerce, it might
be well, while on this subject, not only to
have examined and reported upon, the various
practicable routes for connecting the Missis
sippi with tide water, but the feasibility of an
almost continuous land locked navigation from
Maine to the Gulf of Mexico. Such a route
along our coast would be of great value at all
times, and of inestimable value in case of a
foreign war. Nature has provided the greater
part of this ronte, and the obstacles to be
overcome are easily within the skill of the
engineer. I have not alluded to this subject
with the view of having any further expendi
ture of public money, at this time, than may
be necessary to procure aud place all the
necessary information before Congress in an
authentic form to enable it hereafter, if deem
ed practicable and worthy, to legislate on the
subject without delay.
It is evident unless steps are taken to
preserve our navy, that in a very few years
the United States"will be the weakest nation
upon the ocean of all the great powers. With
an energetic, progressive, business people
like ours, penetrating and forming business
relations with every part of tho known world,
a navy strong enough to eommand the re
spect of our flag abroad is necessary for the
full protection of their rights. I recommend
careful consideration by Congress of the
recommendations made by the Secretary of
the Navy.
The accompanying repeft of the Post
master General furnishes a full and satisfac
tory exhibit of the operations of the Post
office Department, during the year. Our
postal communication with all parts of the
civilized world have been placed upon a most
advantageous footing by the improved postal
conventions and arrangements recently con
cluded with the leading commercial countries
or Europe and America, and the gratifying
statement is made that, with the conclusion
oi a satisfactory convention with France, the
details of which have been definitely agreed
to by the head of the French Postal Depart
ment, subject to the approval of the Minister
ef Finance, little remains to be accomplished
by treaty for some time to come, in respect
to reduction of rate, or improved facilities for
postal intercourse.
I have heretofore commended the abolition
of the franking privilege, and see no reason
now for changing my views on that subject.
It not having been favorably regarded by
Congress, however, I now suggest a modi
fication of that privilege to correct its glaring
and costly abuses.
I would recommend also the appointment
of a committee or commission to take into
consideration the best method, equitable to
private corporations who have invested their
time and capital in the establishment of
telegraph lines, of acquiring the title
to all the telegraph lines now in operation,
and of connecting this service with the
postal service of the natiou. It is not
probable that this subject could receive the
proper consideration during the limits of a
short session of Congress, but it may be
initiated, so that further action may be fair
to the Government and to private parties
concerned.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
will show an alarming falling off in our carry
ing trade, for the last ten or twelve years,
and even for the past year. 1 do not believe
V- a Tin 1 1 ! i r triM u i- m nan Vo iiettAr ATrmniloil
in the interest of the whole peopte than in
trying to lecever this trade. An expenditure
of hve million dollars per annum for the next
five years, if it would restore to us our pro
portion of the carrying trade of the world,
would be profitably expended. The price of
labor in Europe has so much enhanced within
the last few years, that the cost of building
and operating ocean steamers in the
United States is not so much greater than
in Europe, that I believe the time has arrived
for Congress to take this subject into serious
consideration.
Detailed statements of the disbursements
throuch the Department of Justice will be
furnished by the Attorney General, and
though these have been somewhat increased
by the recent acts of Congress to enforce the
rights of citizens of the United States to vote
in the several States of the Union, and to
force the provisions of the Fourteenth Amend
ment to the Constitution of the United States
and the amendment thereto, I cannot ques
tion the necessity and salutary effect of these
enactments. Reckless and lawless men, l
regret to say, have associated themselves
together in some localities to deprive ct. er
citizens of the right gnranteed them by the
Constitution of the United States, and to that
end they have committed deeds of violence,
but the prevention and punishment of many
of these persons have tended greatly to the
repression of such disorders. I do not doubt
that a grat majority of the people of all
parts of the country favor the full enjoyment
by ell classes of persons of those rights

CO w uicu lliey are buuuou uuuvi me
Constitution and the laws, and to in

to prevent organizations whose objects are by
unlawful means to interfere with those rights.
I look with confidence to the time not far dis
tant when the obvious advantages of good or
der and peace will induce an abandonment of
all combinations prohibited by the acts refer
red to, and when it will be unnecessary to
carry on the prosecutions, or inflict punish
ment to protect citizens from the lawless do
ings of such combinations. Applications have
been made to me to pardon persons convicted
of a violation of said acts upon the ground
that clemency in such cases would tend to
tranquillize the public mind, and to test the
virtue of that pohcy I am disposed, so far as
my sense of justice will permit, to give to
these applications a favorable consideration,
but any action thareoa is not to be construed
as indicating any change in my determination
to enforce with vieor such act so long as the
conspiracies and combinations therein named
disturb the peace of the country. It is much
to be regretted, and is rej.-etted by no one
more than myself, that a necessity has ever
existed to execute the miorcemenc act. rto
one can desire more than I that the necessity
of applying it may never again be demanded.
The Secretary of the Interior reports satis
factory improvement and progression in each
of the several bureaus under the contrsl of
the Interior Department They are all in ex
cellent condition. The work which in some
of them for some years has been in arrears
has been brought down to a recent date, and
to all the current business has been promptly
dispatched.
The policy which was adopted at the begin
ning of the Administration with regard to the
management of the Indians has been as suc
cessful as its most ardent friends anticipated
within so Bhorf a time. It has reduced the
expense of their management, decreased their
forage upon the white settlements, tended to
give the largest opportunity to the extension
of the great railways through the public do
main and the pushing the setltements into the
more remote districts of the country and at
the same time improve the condition of the
Indians.
The policy will be maintained without any
change, excepting such as further experience
may show to be necessary to render it more
efficient. The subject of converting
the so-called Indian Territory, south of Kan
sas, into a home for the Indians, and erecting
thereon a Territorial form of government, is
one of great importance as a complement of
the existing Indian policy. The question of
removal to the Territory has within the past
year been presented to many of the tribes
resident upon other and less favorable por
tions of tbe public domain, and has generally
been received by them as a preliminary step
to the organization of sacb a territory will be
necessary to confine the Indians now resident
therein to farms of proper size, which should
be secured to them in fee.tbe residue to be used
for the settlement of other friendly Indians.
Efforts will be made in the immediate future
to induce the removal of as many peaceably
diBposed Indians only to the Indian Territory
as can be settled properly without disturbing
the harmony of those already there. There
is no other location now available where a peo
ple who are endeavoring to acquire a knowl
edge of pastoral and agricultural pursuits can
be as well accommodated as upon the unoccu
pied lands of the Indian Territory.
Affairs in the Territories are generally satis
factory. The energy and business capacity of
the pioneers who are settling up the vast do
main not yet incorporated into States, are
keeping pace in internal improvements and
civil government with the older communities.
In but one of them, Utah, is the condition of
affairs unsatisfactory, except so far as the
quiet of the citizens may bo disturbed by the
real or imaginary danger of Indian hostilities.
It has seemed to be the policy of the Legis
lature of Utah to evade all responsibihty to the
Government of the United States, and even
to hold a position in hostility to it. I recom
mend a careful revision of" the laws of the
Territory by Congress, and the enactment of
such a law as the one proposed in Congress
at its last session, for instance, or something
similar to it, as will secure peace, tho equality
of all citizens before the law, and the ulti
mate relinquishment of polygamy.
The ninth census is about completed. Its
completion is a subject of congratulation, in
asmuch as the use to be made of the statistics
therein contained depeads very greatly on
the prompitude of publication. The Secretary
of the Interior recommends that a census be
taken in 1875, which recommendation should
receive the ready attention of Congress. The
interval at present established between the
Federal census is so long that the informa
tion obtained at fie decimal periods to the
material condition, wants and resources of the
nation is of little practical value. After the
expiration of the first half of that period, it
would probably obviate the constitutional pro
vision regarding the decimal census, if a cen
sus taken in 1875 should be divested of all
political character, and no apportionment of
Congressional represenation be made under
it. Such a census coming as it would in the
last year of the first century of our national
existence would furnish a noble monument of
the progress of the United States during that
century.
The rapidly increasing feterest in education
is a most encouraging feature in the current
history of the country, and it is no doubt true
that tliis is due in a great measure to the
efforts of the Bureau of Education. That
office is continually receiving evidences which
abundantly prove ,its efficiency, from .the
various institutions ofjearning and educators
of all kinds throughout the country. The
report of the Commissioner contains a vast
amount of educational details of great inter
est. The bill now pending before Congress,
providing for the appropriation of part of the
proceeds of the sales of public lands for edu
cational purposes to aid the States in the
general education of their rising generation,
is a measure of such great importance to our
real progress, and is so unanimously approved
by the leading friends of education, that com
mend it to the favorable attention of Congress.
The report of the Commissioner of Agri
culture gives a very full and interesting ac
count of the several divisions of that depart
ment the horticultural, agricultural, sta
tistical, entomological, and chemical and the
benefits conferred by each upon tbe agricul
tural interests of the country. The whole
report is a complete history in total of the
working of that department in all its branches,
shewing the manner in which the farmer,
merchant and miner is informed, and the
extent to which he is aided in his pursuits.
The Commissioner makes one recommenda
tion, that measures be taken by Congress to
protect and reduce the planting of forests,
and suggests that no part of the public lands
should be disposed of withont the condition
that one-tenth of it should be reserved in
timber where it exists, and where it does
not exist inducement should be offered by
planting it.
In accordance with the terms of the act of
Congress approved March 3, 1871, providing
for the celebration of the one hundredth an
niversary of American independence, a Com
mission has been organized, consisting of the
two members from each of the States and
Territories. The Commission has held two
sessions, and has made satisfactory pro
gress in the organization and in the
initiatory steps necessary for the car
rying out the provisions of the act, and for
exceeding the provisions also of the act of
June 1, 1871, creating a continual Board of
Finance. A preliminary report of progress
has been received from the President
of the Commission, and is herewith trans
mitted. " -
It will be the duty of the Commission at
your coming session .to transmit a report of
the progress made, and to lay before you the
details relating to the exhibition of Amen
can and foreign arts, product", and manu
factures which, by the terms of the act, is to
be held under the auspices of the Govern
ment of the United States, in the city of
Philadelphia, in the year 1876. This cele
bration will be looked forward to by Ameri
can citizens with great interest, as making
a cantury oi greater progress ana prosperity
than is recorded in the history of any other
nation, and pro vine a further eood purpose
in bringing together on our soil tbe people
of all the commercial nations of the earth,
in a manner calculated to secure interna
tional good feeling. .
An earnest desire has been felt to correct
abusB which have crown up in the civil
service of the country, through the defective
method of making appointments to office,
which have been regarded too much as the
raward of political services. Under the au
thority of Coneiess rules have been estab
lished to reeulate the termB of office and the
mode of appointment. It cannot be expected
that any system of rule can be entirely ef
fective and prove a perfect remedy for the
existing evils till they have been thoroughly
tested by actual practice and amended ac
cording to the requirements of the service.
During my term of office it shall be my best
endeavor to so apply the rules as to secure
the greatest possible reform in the civil ser
vice of the Government. But it will require
the direct action of Congress to render the en
forcement ef the system, binding upon my
successors, and I hope that the experience
of the past year, together with appropriate
legislation by Congress, may reach a satisfac
tory tolutwn of this question, and secure to
tte public service for all time a practical
method of obtaining faithful and efficient
omcera and employes. ; , '

Report of the Commissioner of Internal.
Revenue Total Receipts from all Sources
for the Year, 8131,770,946-WhIsky Tax,
849,475,576 Receipta from Tobacco
833,736.170.
The report of the Commissioner of
Internal Kevenue states that the aggre
gate receipts from all sources, exclusive
of the duty on the capital, circulation
and deposits of National Banks were for
the following fiscal years ending June 30 r

...8185,235,867
.. 144,011,175
. 131,770,94ft
These amounts include sums refunded
and allowed on drawbacks. The de
crease in the aggregate receipts for the
last two years is due to the legislation
approved July 14, 1870, which reduced,
the revenue to the estimated amount of
$55,000,000 per annum, but which did
not go into full operation before the
close of the fiscal year 1871; The re
ceipts from spirits show an increase
over the last year of $3,992,046. The
sources are given as follows : Spirits
distilled from apples, peaches or grapes,
$544,848 ; spirits distilled from materirls
other than apples, peaches or grapes,
$32,572,940; distillers' per diem tax,
$2,010,986 ; distillers' special and barrel
tax, $6,489,785 ; wine made in imitation
of champagne, $20; rectifiers, $955,704;
dealers in retail liquors, $4,028,604 ; deal
ers, wholesale liquor, $2,065,563 ; manu
facturers of stills, $1,391 ; stills or worms
manufactured, 426; stamps, distillery
warehouse, $290,264 ; stamps, rectifiers',
$367,920 ; stamps, wholesale liquor deal
ers', $139,602 ; excess o gaugers' fees,
$4,118; total, $49,475,576.
The number of gr un distilleries regis
tered the last year was 511 ; fruit dis
tillers, 338 ; making a grand total of
3,649. The returns to this office for the
last fiscal year show a total production
in taxable gallons from materials other
than ruit, of 68,275,745; from fruit,
757,788; total yearly production, 69.
033,533. By the act of June 6, 1872, the act of
July 13, 1866, so far as it relates to fer
mented liquors, was re-enacted with
some amendments made at the solicita
tion of the principal brewers of the
United States, designed to afford brew
ers better facilities than heretofore for
the conduct of their business under the
Internal Revenue laws. These conces
sions do not appear to have been of a
character to endanger the public inter
ests, as the following statement will
show : " The tax received on fermented
liquors, at $1 per barrel, during the
first quarter of the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1872, was $2,217,191, while the
receipts from the same source during
the first three months of the present
fiscal year amount to $2,684,241, an in
crease of $466,949. The average increase
of about a million dollars annually dur
ing the last three fiscal years, as con
trasted, with the stationary character of
the receipts during the four years next
preceding, is certainly gratifying, but
the increase during the first three
months of the present fiscal year, as
above stated, far exceeds that of any
corresponding period in any other year
since the organization of this office. The
tax received on fermented liquors at
$1 per barrel was for the years.

The total receipts from tobacco for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872,
were $33,736,170, showing an increase
over the previous year of $157,263. The
Commissioner says that, so lar as he is.
able to judge, the law providing for a
uniform rate of tax on all manufactured
tobacco, whether chewing or smoking,is
operating very satisfactorily. There is
now no reason why revenue omcers
should examine into the modes of
manufacturing tobacco employed by
any one, or lor opening or examining
any package, to ascertain the character
of its contents. If the package is a
legal one, and has upon it a proper rev
enue stamp, denoting the payment ot
the tax, with such additional marks,
and brands, and labels as the law pre
scribes, no officer is authorized to exam
ine it further.
Owing to the distributing causes which.
have affected the trade for some months
past, it is now too early to predict with
entire certainty what will be the actual
result of the present uniform tax on the
amount of revenue to be collected. He
has reason to believe that, with the ad
ditional safeguards provided by the new
law against the sale of manufactured
tobacco in Iraud ot tne revenue, ana
with the taxes imposed upon the sale at
retail of raw or leaf tobacco for con
sumption without its being subjected to
any process of manufacture, collections
from tobacco, under the uniform rate of
twenty cents a pound (which is a reduc
tion of more than six cents a pound
from the average rate for the last two
fiscal years), will reach nearly, if not
quite, the sums realized for either of
the same years : " In making this esti
mate I am relying upon making col
lections ef from 8,000,000 to 10,000,000
of pounds more of manufactured , to
bacco in consequence of the restrictions
which the act of June 6, 1872, has
placed upon the sale for consumption of
raw or leaf tobacco.
A Wistern paper says that the lyceum
is now a system of strolling players ; to
which .Harper "Easy;Chair" replies: "If
Froude and Tyndall and Beecher and
Phillips, and Anna Dickinson and Mrs.
Stowe, and Theodore Thomas' orchestra
and Rubinstein, are the stock company,
the strolling players are likely to be of,
some service to the country."
