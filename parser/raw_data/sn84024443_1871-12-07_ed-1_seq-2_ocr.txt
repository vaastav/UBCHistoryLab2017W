Tlio relative strength of Uic parties in
tlio uew Congress which assembled on
tho 4th is ns follows: Senate, fifty-six
llepuhlicnns, seventeen Democrats; in
the House, one hundred nnd forty Re
publicans, nnd one hundred nnd three
Democrats.
Killed.
Jnlinn Frazlcr, son of Rev. Robert
Frnicr, of Jackson, county, Ala., was
killed last week, in Memphis, by falling
from a third-story window. Tho father
of tho unfortunate young man will be
remembered as a former citizen of this
plncc, and editor of tho Athens Courier.
Macon.
There is said to be some old Bacon in
different parts of the county, and we
call attention to the fact that clear sides
are quoted in the markets South at 8 and
9 cents. This fact may be of use to par
ties who propose to '"bacon their hogs''
rather than sell at 4 cents gross.
Atheistic Missionaries.
At a meeting of Free Thinkers and
Infidels recently held in Liverpool, a
resolution was passed to establish agen
cies throughout the country for the cir
culation of trncts. to provide for lectures
nnd for the equipment of missionaries
to propagate free thinking ideas.
"Personalities."
As all the parties to the controversy
in our advertising columns in regard to
Patent Medicines, &c, are our friend,
we must urge them to avoid as much as
possible anything that partakes of per
sonalities. The matter, if it is to be pro-
tractcd, can be conducted without re
sorting to a free use ot expletives, or to
terms of an offensive character.
Railroading-.
Tho Kansas Pacific Railroad is 0-1:1
miles long, and pusses through a coun
try some portions of which are subject
to immense drifts of snow in the win
ter, and the fact there bus been Hub or
no delay in the miming of the trains on
this road shows that science is mastering
the obstacles of winter as well as annihi
lating space.
Municipal Corporations.
A bill to repeal the act exempting
from execution and attachment the
property of municipal corporation, hus
passed a third reading in the Senate.
Before passing, the bill was so amended
as to make all property, personal and
real, of municipal corporations subject
to execution.
Political Disabilities.
All the efforts thus far made to induce
the President to recommend Congress
to pass a general act removing all po
litical disabilities imposed by the Fif
teenth Amendment have proven futile,
thomrh the more prominent Conserva
tive Republicans, both in out of Con
gress, have urged such a course upon
Jiini. So far from favoring general am
nesty, it is stated he will take adverse
grounds, and will ask Congress "to ex
tend that feature of the Kuklux Act,
which provides for the suspension of
the writ of habeas corpus in the South
beyond the end of the present session
to which it is now limited. It is evi
dently intended to hold the martial-law
programme ovei the South beyond tho
Presidential election."

Our acknowledgments aro duo Hon.
J. II. Macill for favors from Nashville,
A "Constitutional Party.''
We print on the outside of our paper
to-day two articles bearing upon the
anomalous condition of tho Democratic
party at this time and its possible action
in reference- to the next Presidential
election. One purports to set forth the
views of (iovcrnor Hoffman, of New
York; the other is from n Republican
source, which advocates (i rani's re-election.
Following is an extract from a
letter written by the Hon. A. II. II.
Stuart, of Virginia. Mr. Stuart think
the namo 'Democrat" was tho chLf
cause of the recent want of success in
the North, and that n different result
will follow if the old cognomon is shuf
fled off nnd "Constitutional Party"' be
substituted. Ho says:
'Let us then unfurl our flag with this
name, so significant of our patriotic
mission, inscribed upon it. Let us ap
peal to the good men of all sections and
parties and shades of opinion to unite
with us in re-building the Temple of
Liberty, and re-placing therein the Ark
of the Covenant the Constitution of
tho United States, as framed by 'Wash
ington. Hamilton and Madison, and ex
pounded by .lay, Marshall and Taney.
Let us seek the co-operation of men tile
Schv.rz, and Trumbull. and ("rat Brown,
and Cox of Ohio, F.varts, and others,
who. however much they may have dif
fered from us in the past, have shown
that when danger threatens the citadel
of freedom they are capable of rising
far above the behests of party to yield
homage to their country.
'If the inquiry be made, how can this
be done? we answer, let sonic promi
nent men say our Conservative Central
Committee at Richmond at once place
themselves in communication with some
trusted friends at Washington, and in
duce them to send, far and wide, to all
parts of the Union, invitations to the
wisest nnd best men of every section to
meet in AVashinglon city about the mid
dle of January, to take counsel with
j each other, and with Senato
and mem
bers, in regard to the wiscsl course to be
adopted in the great crisis which is so
near at hand.
"Such conference can. by no possibili
ty, do harm. In all probability, it would
be productive of most important and
beneficial results. Surely it is worth
t'.ie experiment.''
There seems to be no end to the sug
gestions and plans designed to retrieve
the situation and to rescue the
;overn -
ment from the hands of the Republi
cans, but they all appear to us to point
in the same direction, nnd, when boiled
down, to mean "disband the party" nnd
give every one a permit to go where he
pleases. Havina been an old line Whig
and fought under its Hag as long as it
waved over a national organization, our
Democracy is not of a date so ancient as
to bias us much in favor of the term as
a party signification. Hut we believe
the, proposition to disband at this tims
for the purpose of forming n'nev party",
or to assume what is termed the "pas
sive policy."' which, according to our
view, would be equivalent to disband
ing, will result disastrously will elect
the Republican nominee, whether Grant
or soma one else, by an overwhelming
majority, and jeopardise, the ascendency
of the party in some of the States where
it is now dominant. Indeed, ;hc discus
sion of these various propositions has
already weakened party ligatures, and.
no matter what policy mav be adopted,
we expect the majority in this State will
be heavily reduced in the elections of
next year. Tho cases sometimes cited
that of Senter in Tennessee and Gratz
Brown in Missouri are not analagous,
and the argument cducod therefrom is
fallacious, The issues were local in
their character, and will not bo promi
nent in the Presidential canvass outside
two or three States.
Old ns we aro we hope to livo long
enough to sec the government pass into
hands other than those which shape its
course and wield its power to-day, but
we don t expect a result so desirable to
be accomplished by tho adoption of a
policy which has sclf-imniolation so
palpably traced upon its features. This
much with the utmost respect for our
cotemporaries of the press and for the
many eminent gentlemen who think
otherwise.
Itovt'iiiio Decision.
The Iltintsville Democrat of ono day
last week says, under the instructions of
Judge Busteeil, a jury in the United
States Court, brought in a verdict of
S000 against the Memphis and Charles
ton Railroad Company for carrying
two empty whiskey barrels from Mad
ison to Scoltsboro, with tho revenue
stamps uncancelled. Tho Company
mado proof i hat its shipping agents
woro not aware that tho stamps were
uncancelled, and that tho barrels were
sent for the purpose of filling them with
sorghum molasses. The Judge told tho
jury that the Company were bound to
know whether the stamps wero cancel,
led or not, and ignorance of the fact was
no excuse.
Judge Shields.
The Kuoxville Prcumnul Ue.rahl says
of tho gentleman recently appointed to
tho Supremo Bench, vice Hon. T. A. R.
Nelson, resigned :
J udgo Shields, who has been nniioint-

Court, and has ever woro tho ermine

Legislative.
Tho following occurs in tho Senate
proceedings of the 1st :
Senate bill on third reading to repeal
the act providing for a conventional rate
of interest, was taken up. The Speaker
held its consideration to bo void ns the
question affected tiie Constitution. An
appeal was taken from the ruling, but
the Senate sustained the Speaker.
In the House proceedings we find the
following:
Mr. McCnII, representing three mem
bers of the committee appointed to in
vestigate the condition of railroads in
tho Shite, reported that while they had
not been ablo to r.iako as thorough a
search into tho matter as desirable, had
come to the conclusion that some mil
lions of bonds had been issued and used
in violation of law. The committee re
ported a bill prohibiting the Comptrol
ler and Treasurer from paying any
bonds, or coupons thereof, which have
been issued sinco tho war to railroad
companies or receivers, until the Legis
lature, by subsequent legislation, shall
authorize the same. If other bonds than
those issued since the war aro presented
before the next session of the Legisla
ture, it shall be the duty of the Comp
troller or Treasurer to procure the opin
ion of the Attorney General as to the
validity of said bonds. Tho bill was
passed on its first reading.
There has been a good deal of inves
tigation in the last year or two into rail
road and bond matters, but as far as we
know without any very substantial or
satisfactory result ; and we have no idea
that the present effort will prove more
successful. If there is anything wrong
there ought to be
no insurmountable i
dilllculty in the way of reaching if. Ri. !
thcr make it thorough and linal, with-1
out fear, favor or allection, or quit in-
vesugamig at once, as constant agita
tion has no other effect than to weaken
public credit and depreciate State tecu
ritics. Khode Island.
It Is well known that tho first cotton
mill built in the United States was built
in Rhode Island about 17UD hv Samuel
Slater, who smuggled somo patterns of
cotton-spinning machinery out of Eng.
land, and man u fact u red' and erected
machinery nt Pawtucket. From this
small beginning that Stalo has probably,
become the largest manufacturer of cot
ton, in proportion to area and popula
tion, in the United Slates: and this
branch of industry may justly bo re
garded ns the foundation of tho wealth,
influence and prosperity of that State.
Other iinportout manufacturing enter

How Grant May be Defeated.
Hon. George H. Parker, n lending
Democrat of Davenport, Iowa, has ad
dressed the following letter to tho Chi
cago Times :
Having faithfully served ns n member
of fhc Democratic organization for over
twenty years, and still having tho fullest
confidence in the cardinal principles of
that party. I am impelled fo declare my
convictions that tho organization has
outlived its usefulness, nnd that it is tho
duty of Democrats to openly acknow
ledge that the Democratic party is dead.
All efforts nt departure, or to galvanize
it into life, have proved n failure.
The prestige of its general policy, or
rather tho lack of policy during the War,
will cling to it and prevent success, no
matter how much we may become puri
fied by a change of heart. The result of
the recent elections arc sullleien t proof of
the fact. AVe can organize by forming
some integral imrt of a new party, nnd
probably resurrect our principle's, but
the body must be buried and the stench
of its putrid remains removed from the
public nostrils, 'i'he present is tho
proper emergency to test the patriotism
of members of IIih Democratic party. If
we love our country better than we do
our party, abandon the organization,
and unite with patriots, disregarding
political antecedents, nnd we may rea
sonably hope for a change of Adminis
tration in 1S72, that will protect, nnd
guarantee equal rights to all sections of
our common country. Centralized pow
er will vanish, the war will soon bo
forgotten, and our country again bo
peaceful, prosperous and happy.

Dunn explains.
The New York Sun says the Louis
ville i'nhiii:i rein! is generally a sensiblo
paper: but it falls into ridiculous none
sense v, hen it says that "the editor of
the Sun has a hi iter personal hostility
toward General Grant." We have no
more hostility against General Grant
now than we had in lStitl, when at Yieks
burg we saved him from being relieved
from his command and sent back to sell
sole leather on a salary of SSIU a year.
Supporting him then did not grow out
of personal reasons; neither does op
posing him now. I Ie was a good Gen
eral, but he is a very b id President, and
his continuance in oHice would bean
unmixed evil lo the country. 'Phis is
t he w hole story.

Important Kailroad Movement.
An Atlanta date says, a movement for
a railroad from the Ohio river to the
South Atlantic sea-board is nearly com
pleted The scheme includes a steam
ship line with Europe, an unbroken line
from Louisville to Savannah and I'.nins
wiek. via Montgomery. The projectors
have ample enpila! and experience.
Tmc Attorney General of the United
States has decided that a railroad, aided
by donation of public hinds, is a pub
lie highway throughout ils length, and
the United Slates is not subject to
charges for transportation. Tho opin
ion refers specially to the road from.
Chicago to Mobile.
