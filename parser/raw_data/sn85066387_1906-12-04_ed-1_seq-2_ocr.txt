THAW CASE MAY BE
LONG DELAYED
NEW YORK. Dec. 3.— When Clifford
W. Partridge of counsel for Harry
Thaw appeared before Judge Newber
ger today and asked for the appoint
ment of commissioners to take the tes
timony of Stanford White he met with
a surprise. This came from District
Attorney Jerome, who in agreeing to
the commissioners declared there was
an important witness in South Africa
whom he might like to have testify
before a commission. This is Ada Vera
Fimonton. a writer, who said soon after
the slaying of White that some years
r.go. when Thaw and the actress were
in Europe. White had sent her to the
Nesbitt girl in an endeavor to have her
leave Thaw and return to this country
without him.
One of Thaw's attorneys said to As
sistant District Attorney Garvan as he
was leaving the court: "If you find It
necessary to send to South Africa for
the testimony of this witness it will
be months before the case can proceed."
He had not been prepared for the
move by Jerome, even though wit
nesses he wished to have examined by
commissions are now in : California,
Truxtun Beale and Thomas W. . Me-
Taleb. both of whom dined with Thaw
and his wife on the evening of the
shooting and accompanied them to the
Madison Square Garden. --.»"'-

New witnesses having knowledge of

through the City .Commercial Com
pany, are to be called, and the Investi
gation promises to add considerably to
the graft' revelations already "made.
Three members of the Board of Su
pervisors may be involved in this graft.
The graft was especially profitable im
mediately-after- the- -fire- when
sands of dollars' worth of work was
ordered and rushed through on the plea
that it was for "emergency" purposes.
No attempt was made to secure bids
for a great deal- of this work. It is
said, and the favored firms charged for
it practically what they liked.
Evidence amassed by Special Agent
William Burns in this graft is known
to be of a most conclusive nature, and
that indictments wSll be returned on It
is believed by those who have knowl
edge of Its character.

FLOOD IS RAGING
IN SALT RIVER
PHOENIX, Ariz.. Dec. 3. — Continuous
rains in the watersheds during the last
few weeks have resulted in 'a flood
coming down Salt River. It is supposed
that the crest passed the Roosevelt
dam site, seventy, miles above Phoenix,
late this afternoon, with a volume of
20,000 feet per second.
Twenty-five miles above Phoenix the
Verde River Is adding 14; : ()00 feet a
second, and some fear is felt concern
ing the bridge at Tempe. Chief Interest
centers in the construction of the
Roosevelt dam. By telephone reports
the contractors were warned and pre
pared to resist the flood.
The machinery has all been removed
from the canyon and the only damage
feared will be the loss of time necess
ary to remove water and debris from
the excavation after the flood and to
rebuild the crest of the coffer dam
which has been swept away.

The friends of the ship subsidy bill
are insistent that the measure receive
consideration at this session. The bill
is still in committee in the House, but
its friends think they will be. able'-] to
get it out In due season^ and have it
considered.
Speaker Cannon and many other
prominent members of the House ar
rived at the capitol long before the
opening of the House and engaged in
a reunion and informal discussion, of
probable issues which will occupy
thorough attention.
The Japanese situation was discussed
quite generally by the members, 1 and
the opinion was expressed freely that
measures affecting the Japanese may
be introduced in the House at any time.
Representative Kahn of California
said he did not think the California
delegation would. take immediate steps
to push any legislation affecting the
Japanese. He said that the California
delegatio.n would probably hold a meet
ing within two weeks for the discus
sion of the situation and would doubt
less act as a unit in case -decision is
reached to urge the passage of any
special measure.
Two Japanese exclusion bills, one by
Representative McKinlay of California
and the other by Representative Hayes
of California, are now pending In Con
gress.:
Representative Needham of Califor
nia was the first, member of the delega
tion from that State to reach'the.capi

Francisco district, . and consequently ia
not in close touch with the situation
In that city arising from-the exclusion
of Japanese from the public schools at
tended by, white I children. He said,
however, that' he believed! the present
agitation- would gradually die- out and
the situation, would, quietly, settlo itself.

WASHINGTON," Dec. 3.— Surprise lit

question, together with a complete.list
of the men discharged, .showing^ the.
record of each, the. amount of < the re
tired pay each was entitled to to un
der certain sections of the • Revised
Statues. Foraker said in an interview:
I have no purpose of raising the race
question. The. question involved "is
broader.. It concerns white as well as
colored soldiers. It is a question of
constitutional power on the one - hand
and constitutional and statutory rights
on the other. Until we have a complete
record I do. not know just , what ques
