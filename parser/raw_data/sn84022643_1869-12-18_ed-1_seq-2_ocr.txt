The report of the Postmaster-General furnishes
a clear and comprehensive exhibit of the opera
tions of the postal service and of the financial
condition of the Postomee Denaxtment- Th or
dinary postal revenues for the year ending June
ou, auooBi w 510,04, out, ana the expen
ditures to $23,689, 131, showing an excess of ex
penuiturca over receipts of 5-35.Vfi?0. The
cess of expenditures over receipts for the previous
year amounted to $6,437,892. The increase of
this Department's revenues for 1869 over those of
1S6. was 32,051,909, and tho increase of expen
ditures was $9,975,038. The increased revenue
of 1S69 exceeded the increased revenue of 1868
by $996,336. In the increased expenditures in
1869, were $5,527,570 less than the increased ex
penditures in 1867, showing by comparison this
gratifying feature of improvement, that while the
increase-of expenditures over the increase of re
ceipt in 1868 was $2,439,525, the increase of re
ceipts over the increase of expenditures of 1S9
was $1,084,371. Tour attention is respectfully
called to tho recommendation made by the IV.-t-aoaster-General
for authority to charge rates of
compensation to the main trunk railroad lines for
services in eoin in carrying mails for reorgan
ising and increasing the efficiency of special
agents, for increase of mail service on the Pacific,
and for establishing mail service under the flag of
the Union on tho Atlantic, j and especially do I
call your attention to his recommendation for the
total abolition of the franking privilege. This id
an abiue from which no one receives a commen
surate advantage, It reduces the receipts for
postal service from 25 to 30 per cent., and largely
inorease the service to be performed. The
method by which postage should be paid upon

the Postmaster General.

The. report of the -Secretary cf the Interior
shows that the gnantity of publie lands disposed
of during the year ending the 36th Jane, 18 69,
was 7,666,152 acres exceeding that of the pro
ceeding year by 1.010.400 acres. Of this amount
2,899,544 acres were sold for cash, and 2,731,365
crea seenrea under the homestead laws. The re
mainder was granted to aid the construction
works of internal improvement, approved to
iuucs aa swamps, ana lann warrants and sofip
xuecaan receipts irom all sources were f v4'-
V87, exceeding those of the preceding yerfr $;
840,140.
During the last fiscal year, 23,196 names were
added to the pension rolls, and 4,886 dropped
therefrom, leaving at tho close, 187,663. The
amount paid to pensioners including ihecompen- :
roT disbursing agents was J8,42s,bi4, an
increse of $441,152 on that of the previous year.
The munificence of Congress has been conspicu
ously manifested in its legislation for the soldiers
and orphans who suffered in the struggle to main
tain that unity of Government which makes us
one people. The additions to the pension rolls
of each successive year sinee the conclusion of hos
tilities results in a great degree from the reported
amendments of the act of the 14th of July, 1S67,
which extended its provisions to eases not falling
within its original scope. The large outlay which
is thus occasioned is further increased by the
more liberal allowance bestowed since that date
upon those who in the line of duty were wholly
or permanently disabled. Public opinion has
given an emphatic sanction to these measures of
Congress and it will be conceded that no part of
onr publio burden is more cheerfully borne than
that which is imposed by this branch of the ser
vice. It necessitates for the next fiscal year an
addition to the amount j aptly chargeable to the
naval pension fund of $20,000,000.
During the year ending 30th of September,
1869, the Patent Office issued 13,762 patents, and
the receipts were $636,389, being $213,035 more
than tho expenditures.
I would respectfully call your attention to the
recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior,
for uniting the duties of supervision of the edu
cation of the freedmen with the other duties de
volving upon the Commissioner of Education.
If it is the desire of Congress to make the
census which must be taken during the year 1870
more complete and perfect' than heretofore, I
recommend early action upon any plan that may
be agreed upon. As Congress at the last session
appointed a committee to take into consideration
sack measures aa might be deemed proper in re
ference to the census and - report a plan, I desist
from saying more.
I recommend to your favorable consideration
the claims of the Agricultural Bureau. In a coun
try so diversified in climate and soil as ours, and
with a population so largely dependent upon
Agriculture, the benefits to be conferred by prop
erly fostering' this Bureau are incalculable.
:" I desire respectfully to call the attention of
Congress to the inadequate salaries of a number
of the most important officers of the Government.'
In this Smessage I will not enumerate, but will
mention the Justices of the Supreme Court. No
change has baen made in their salaries in fifteen
years. Within that time the labors of the court
nave largely increased, and the expenses of living
nave at least doubled. During tho same time
Congress has twice found it necessary to increase
largely the cotnpensation-of its own members, and
tho duty which it owes to another department of
tho Government deserves to and will undoubtedly
receive its dne consideration.
v There are many subjects not alluded to in this
message .which might with propriety be intro
duced bat I abstain, believing your patriotism and
statesmanship' will suggest the topics of legisla
tion most conducive to the interests of the whole
people. On my part I promise rigid advocacy of
the laws and their strict enforcement.

The factories in and about Salem, with
the exception of the Woolen Mills, are
turning out the usual amount of articles
in their lines. The lumbering mills are
filling up their yards with lumber for the
Spring trade, and the flouring mills are
preparing wheat for the consumption of
the people. i.t the Salem foundry and
Machine Shop, B. F. Drake, proprietor,
several new and original machines are be
ing put up, among which may bo men
tioned several "stickers" for sash, door
and blind factories : two or three large
"surface planers" for wood, the patterns
for which are being made. here. .A new
brick machine is also being made at the

. : CORPORATIONS. v- j :
A company of four persons from Port

to engage in the purchase, sale, renting,
etc., of real estate in Oregon and else
where. The capital stock is $50,000.
This company is similar in its objects to
the Salem Homectead Company, which
was incorporated about a year since.

Portland last spring which have increased
in value about one-half. The success of
this . company is inducing others to go

blow was partially turned aside by Scott,
who presented a derringer, at the same
time warning Semple of the imminent
danger he was in of becoming a ghost, a
dead quillist, if the ttrxking exhibition
was again indulged in. This derringer
"presentation" acted as a check upon the

Correspondence of the New York Times.l
jf Mexico, Saturday, Nov. 6,1869. -Mr.
'Seward's trip from tho Pacific
coast through Mexico is proving a sort of '
triumphal inarch. It rarely falls to the
lot of publio men during their lives to
be the recipients ot such an ovation ot
gratitude Irom all clashes of citizens in a
foreign State as the Ex-Secretary is re
ceiving in Mexico. At a dinner given
Mr. Seward at Colima, on the 12th alt.,
many toasts were proposed and many
speeches made. The Mexicau journals
call the attention of their readers to the
ideas contained in Mr. Seward's reply to
the speech made by the uovernor ot the
State of Colima. The Governor said :
" The inhabitants of the State oft Col

the eminent statesman who,' irom the
White House, stopped that barbarous in
road that threatened to sow in tho he Ids
of this Republic the seeds of monarchy,
an exotic plant that has proved the bane
of the Old World. The glory of my
country is united to that of the United
States by brotherly bonds. I salute you
in the name of the Mexican people, and
offer you their friendship as sincere as
your sincerity that of the friend you
have proven yourseit to bo ot this na
tion. JVlexieo hails and blesses you.
Mr. Seward replied in the following
strain :
Gentlemen; I thank you with all my
heart for the distinguished hospitality
and for the honors you have showered
upon me in this ancient city of Colima.
Ibe experience of the eighteenth con
tury showed the world two important
changes in the Government of the Amer
ican continent, lurst, that the United
States hencetorth should not form colo
nial dependencies of Europe, but nations,
free and independent, of the American
continent, hecond, that these nations
ought not to have monarchial forms of
government, but should be governed by
republican institutions. .During the
great part of my political - life these
changes of society and government have
been more or less discussed in logical de
bates in Europe, and by the sword in the
battle-fields of America. More than
once these wars have provoked European
intervention. Union of different contig
uous States was found necessary to guar
antee the exit ot the two principles laid
down as above. The United States of
North America took the first step in
these changes, so important to the Amer
ican hemisphere. The Mexican Repub
lic bravely and persistently followed the
example, and Central America, and al
most all South : America, have observed
the examples set them. There yet re
mains an additional principle which should
be well implanted in the . soil of public
opinion to insure a complete success for
the American system, and which might
cause it to be accepted, by various Euro
pean nations. This additional principle
is, that these different Republics should
abstain from intervention with each oth
er's affairs, save in a friendly way. This
U the policy I have endeavored to preach
in my own country, and which, with
your permission, I would recommend to
Mexico. I sincerely hope that attacks
against republicanism in ' Mexico have
ceased, and pray God for its continued
prosperity, unity and independence. ;
