THE DEATH OF THE RENEGADE.
At midnight, on his oilice lounge,
Forney was dreaming of the hour
• When Democrats, in suppliance bent,
Should tremble at his power;
In drcnius to Washington be bore
Election news, as conqueror;
In dreams, his song of triumph sung;
Then heard bold Sumner's words of praise
Then, through old Abratn, made a raise
Of contracts, that in profit pays,
Tlie gold from frccincn wrung.
At midnight, in another square, •
The Democrats their council held ;
The good, the great, the wise were there,
And with high hopes their bosoms swelled
They were the sons of those who stood,
No firmly for their country's good,
In days of Jackson—bold ;
And now, they felt that, without pause,
They'd fight us bravely for our cause,
• The Constitution and the laws,
As did their sires of old.
As time passed on, Forney awoke,
That bright dream was his last—
Ho woke—to hear the ringing shout,
. That heralded the utter rout,
•Of those who, tor the "counterband,"
Would flood with gore our happy land,
And madly into ruin east
A government by patriots formed,
And held by compromise unharmed.
He woke, —to hoar his naino,
That once upon the record stood,
"With those who for their country's good
Would sacrifice their wealth and blood—
Coupled with every shame.
He woke—to hear all good men say.
Thank God, this ends the recreant's power,
The dog is dead—he's had his day,
And 'neath the lash must ever cower.
His traitor comrades clearly saw
Jlim droop, when rang the proud huzza,
And all his hopes were sunk.
Then saw him close his bottle clasp,
And struggle in its deadly grasp
Until lie fell dead drunk.
Come to the bridal chamber, denin i
Come to the mother, when she feels,
For the first time, her first-born's breath v
Come when the blessed seals
That close the pestilence are broke,
And crowded cities wail its stroke ;
Come in consumption's glastly form,
The earthquake's shock the ocean's storm ;
Come when the heart heats liigh and warm
With banquet-song, and dance and miine-
And thou art terrible ! —The tear,
The groan tho knell, the pall, the bier,
Are dreadful; —yet with conscience clear
Wc calmly hide our time.
But to tlbe man whose perjured soul
With every evil thought is crammed,
Thy v<iee sounds like a prophet's word ;
And in its hollow tones arc heard,
The glee of fiends who wait the damned.
John Forney! in thy traitor grave,
Condemned to infamy through time,
Kent thee: thero is no greater knave
Storied in any clime.
Wc tell thy doom without a sigh
For thou notorious now, art Fame's —•
One of the few, dctostod names
Immortal in their infamy.
Buchanan's Final Reply to Scott.
To the Editors of the National Intelligencer:
With a few remarks, I shall close the contro
versy with Gen. Scott, into which I have been
most reluctantly forced by his voluntary and un
expected attack. This has, nevertheless, afford
ed mo an opportunity of correcting many un
founded reports which I had long borne in pa
tience and in silence.
In my answer, I have already furnished clear
and distinct responses to all the allegations of
Gen. Scott; and in his rejoinder he has not call
ed in question any of my statements, with a
single exception. Which of us is correct in this
particular depends upon the question whether
his recollection of an event which occurred
more than eighteen months ago, or the state
ment of Mr. Holt, reduced to writing on the
very day, is entitled to tlie greater credit.
The General, in the introduction of his re
joinder, assigns as an excuse for the criticism
on my public conduct that this was merely in
cidental to his alleged official report to Presi
dent Lincoln on the condition of our fortifica
tions, and was not primarily intended for my
self. From this statement one would conclude
that he had made such a report. Hut where is
this to be found? For it lie refers to the Intel
ligencer of the 21t of October; but there 1
discover nothing but his letter of four points to
Mr- Seward, dated on the 8d Marcli, 1801, ad
vising the incoming President how to guide his
administration in face of the threatening dan
gers to tho country. In the single introducto
ry sentence to this letter he barely refers to bis
"printed views," (dated in October, I860,) which
had been long before the public; but it contains
nothing like an official report on the condition
of the fortifications.
Whether the introduction of this letter to tho
public without the consent of President Lincoln,
by one of tho General's friends, in a political
speech during a highly excited gubernatorial
canvass, had influenced him to prepare his crit-
icism on my conduct, it is not for me to deter
mine.
At what period did Gen. Scott obtain the
six hundred recruits to which he refers in his
rejoiaderl This was certainly after the date of
his "views," OO the 30th October, I860; be-
those 1)0 states emphatically that the

forces then at his command were "in nil five
companies only within reach to garrison or re
inforce (he (nine) forls mentioned in the "views."
Did he obtain these recruits in November?
If so, had he visited Washington or written and
explained to me in what manner this military
operation could he accomplished by the four
hundred men in the live companies, and the six
hundred recruits, I should have given his rep
resentations all the consideration eminently due
to his high military reputation.
But he informs us lie did not arrive in Wash
ington until the I2ih of December. His second
recommendation to garrison these forts must
consequently have been made, according to his
own stalcmcnt, on the 13th, loth, 28th, or 30th
of December, or on more than one of these days.
At tins period the aspect of public affairs had
greatly changed from what it was in October.
Congress was now in session, and our relations
with the Seceding Cotton States had been pla
ced before them by the President's message.
Proceedings had been instituted by that body
with a view to a.compromise of the dangerous
questions lietwcen the North and the South;
and the highest hopes and warmest aspirations
were then entertained for their success. Under
these circumstances it was the President's duty
to take a broad view of the condition of the
whole country, in all its relations, civil, indus
trial and commercial, as well as military, giv
ing to each its appropriate influenrc. It was
only from such a combination that ho could
frame a policy calculated to preserve the peace
and to consolidate the strength of the Union.
Isolated recommendations proceeding from one
department, without weighing well their effect
upon the general policy, ought to be adopted
with extreme dhution.
Hut it seems from the rejoinder (lint Secreta
ry Floyd, at Hichmond, had claimed the honor
of defeating Gen. Scott's "plans and solicita
tions respecting the forts," "it being there,"
says the General, "universally admitted that
hut for that victory over me there could have
been no rebellion." This is, in plain English,
that the secessionists of the cotton States, who
have since brought into the field hundreds of
thousands of undoubtedly brave soldiers, would
have abandoned in terror their unlawful anil re
bellious designs, had Gen. Scott distributed a
mong their numerous forts four hundred meu in
October, or one thousand men in l>eecmber!
This requires no comment.
1 have never been able to obtain a copy of
tfenYScotf refers"bufTTeanfe.Tfell,
at the time and since, from gentlemen of high
respectability; that in this same speech he de
nounced me most bitterly for my determination
In stand by and sustain the Union with all the
power I possessed uuder the Constitution and
the laws.
And here permit me to remark that it is due
to Gen. Scott as well as myself to deny that
there is any portion of my answer which justi
fies the allegation that "the ex-l'resident sneers
at my 'weak tUvicc ,' (the words 'weak device'
being marked as a quotation) for saving the
forts." This mistake I must attribute to his
"accidental visitor."
And in this connexion I emphatically declare
that the General, neither before nor after the
publication of his "views" in the National In
telligencer of the 18th January, 1801, without
my consent, assigned any reason to mo for ma
king this publication, or ever even alluded to
the subject. In this I cannot be mistaken, from
the deep impression which the occurrence made
upon my memory, for the reasons already men
tioned in my answer.
I should have nothing more to add had Gen.
•Scott, in his rejoinder, confined himself to the
topics embraced in his original letter. lie has
extended them, and now for the first time, and
in a sarcastic and no kindly spirit, refers to the
alleged stealing of public arms by Secretary
Floyd and their transportation to the South in
anticipation of the rebellion. The most con
clusive answer to this allegation is that, not
withstanding the boasting of Mr. Floyd at Rich
mond, evidently with the. view of conciliating
his new allies, cited by the General as his au
thority, no public arms were ever stolen.
This fact is established by the report of the
Committee on Military Affairs of the House of
Representatives, now before mo, made by Mr.
Stanton, of Ohio, their chairman, on the 18th
volume of the Reports of Committees of the
House for the session of 1860-61. This re
port and the testimony before the committee es
tablish:
1. That the Southern States received in 1800
less instead of more than the quota of arms to
which they were entitled bylaw; and that threo
of them—North Carolina, Mississippi and Ken
tucky—-received no arms whatever, and this sim
ply because they did not ask for them. Well
may Mr. Stanton have said in the House "that
there are a good deal of rumors and specula
tions and misapprehension as to the true state
of facts in regard to this matter."
2. Secretary Floyd, under suspicious circum
stances, on the 22d December, 18(30, and but a
few Jays before he left the Department, had,
without the knowledge of the I'rcsidcnt, order
ed 113 columbiads and 11 thirty-two pounders
to be transported from Pittsburg to Ship Island
and Galveston, in Mississippi and Texas.
This fact was brought to the knowledge of
the President by a communication from Pitts
burg; and .Secretary Holt immediately there
after countermanded the order of his predeces
sor, and the cannon wero never scut. Tho
promptitude with whichjwe acted elicited a voto
of thanks, dated on the 4th of January, 18(31,
from the Select and Common Councils of that
city, '-to tho President, the Attorney General,
and the acting Secretary of War." (Mr. llolt.)
After this statement how shall we aocount
for tho explicit declaration of Gen. Scott that,
"accidentally hearing early in March that under
this posthumous order (that of Mr. Floyd of
the 22d I>ecember) the shipment of these guns
bad commenced, 1 communicated the fact to
Freedom of Thought tod Opinion.

Secretary Holt, (acting for Secretary Cameron,)

And this is the same Secretury Holt who h vd
countermanded "the posthumous order" in the
previous December. And, strange to say, these
guns, but for the alleged interposition of Gen.
Scott, were about to be sent so late as March
from the Loyal States into those over which
Jefferson Davis had then for some time pre
sided !
Had General Scott reflected, for a moment,
lie could uot have fallen into this blander.—
It is quite manifest he was "without a print
ed ami my (his) own ollicial pa
pers."
3. The Government had on hand in the year
1859 about 500,000 old muskets, which had
been condemned "as unsuitable for public ser
vice," under the acl of 3d of March, 1825.
They were of such a character that although
offered both at public and private sale for $2 50
each, purchasers could not be obtained at that
rate, exuept for u comparatively small num
ber.
Gn tho 30th of November, 1859, Secretary
Floyd ordered about one-fifth of the whole
number (105,000) to be sent from the Spring
field armory, where they had accumulated, to
live Southern arsenals, "in proportion to their
respective means of proper storage." This or
der was carried into effect by the Ordnance
Bureau in the usual course of administration
and without reference to the President.
It is but justice to say that from the testi
mony before the committee there is no reason
to suspect that Secretary Floyd issued this or
der from any sinister motive, its date was
mouths before Mr. Lincoln's nomination for the
Presidency, and nearlya year before bis election,
and whilst (he Secretary was still an avowed
opponent of secession. Indeed, the testimony
of Col. Craig and Capt. .Maynadier, of the
Ordnance, before the Committee is wholly in
consistent with any evil intention on his part.
And yet these "condemned muskets," with a
few thousand ancient rifles of a calibre then no
longer used, are transformed by General Scott
into "115,000 extra mtuketi and rifles, with all
their implements and ammunition." This is the
fust time I have heard—aWainly there was
nothing of the kind before tlic committee—that
ammunition was sent with these condemned and
inferior arms to their places of storage—just as
though they had been intended not for sale but
for immediate use in the field.

The Twelve Puritan Crimes which no
Man Can Gainsay.
Whatever Ilenry Wanl Beeeher, who pre
tends to be a Christian may say, we intend to
day to present a record which even lie dares not
deny. Wet lien present what we cnll thtttccli* Pu
ritan crimes, and let clerical humbugs, who have
displaced the Gospel foV their diabolisms, con
trovert us. We are aware of this, that good
men, theologians, Who are now filling Northern
pulpits, and who get their salaries by succum
bing to Northern prejudices, take ground against
the South. But let us look at the affair as it
stands, and if the vast interests of Christianity
are against the teachings ot the Puritans,
let us ignore them, and turn to the doctrines
of the Bible. This we know may bo difficult,
and the more so, because the wealth of the
Northern churches is, at present, held by the
Abolitionists, and they pay the salaries of the
ministers, alas! too much governed by Mam
mon.
Now what are the tieelce Puritan crimes ? T.et
us record them for the sake ot history, and we
give them because they militate against Freedom,
Humanity and the Union.
First. The crime in the beginning of blind
and cruel persecutions, in putting to death per
sons of other belief than their own, imprison
ing, banishing or killing Episcopalians, and Bap
tists, Hogging Quaker women upon their naked
backs in the public streets, imprisoning and ban
ishing and hanging them, aye, ami hanging even
women as witches.
Second. The crime of stealing negroes by whole
sale and bringing them from Alriea and selling
them as slaves to the South.
Third. The crime, according to their present
theology, of agreeing to the Constitution anil
forming this Union, on the condition of exclu
ding nil foreign ships from the carrying trade
of the South, and securing a monopoly of' the
slave trade for twenty years, thus bringing in all
the slaves that ever were brought into the U
nion, and agreeing to secure protection to sla
very for the contract moiwpoly m, the slave trade.
Fourth. The crime of thus agreeing to the
Constitution, JIB a bond ol Union, and then,
when enriched by the slave trade and slave pro
duce, annulling this covenant with the South
and the Union, and setting to work to break up
the Constitution and destroy the Union!
Fifth. The crime of making slavery, of which
themselves tfere most guilty, (if there be guilt,)
the pretence of this breach of faith, and for
this appalling betrayal of the hopes of man in
self government; this horrible outrago upon
the wido world's freedom and humanity !
Sixth. The crime of treason to the Union in
the war of 1812, striking our national colors
in Canada, under the Puritan Hull, refusing
the government call for troops to defend the U
nion, burning blue lights for the enemy upon
our coasts as treason signals to betray the Union.
Seventh. The crime of the Hartford Conven
tian in 1814 for dissolving the Union—dissol
ving the Union by tho vote of Massachusetts'
| legislation on the admission of Louisiana, and
again, attempting to dissolve thellnion on the ad
mis siou of Texas—the sending of Adams to
Cengress to present petitions for the dissolution
of the Union in 1842 and permitting the trea
son of Hale, who presented ei'j/tt petitions for
tie dissolution of the Union in 1800-0 I 1
Eighth. The crime of persecuting the defend
on! of the Constitution and the Union, among
idiom the foremost was DANIEL WEBSTER, the
nsblest (statesman of the East, whose love for
tlte Union secured for him the hate and abuse
of all the Abolition I'uritans.
Ninth. The great crime of Unitarian unbe
lief, sinking the churches and ministers of New
i'ligland into the emissaries of Anti-Unßisr, de
throning and blaspheming the HOLY SON of GOD
atd setting their "higher law" of Abolition a
btive the word of GOD, and opening wide the
door to Unitnrianism, Abolitionism, Agrarian
ism, to Free Txive, Communism, Fanny Wrighl
ism, Charles Fourierisin, AVomens' Right ism,
aid a whole brood of foolish, wicked, and blas
} .heinous isms, which, by the aid and connivance
of so-called Christian Ministers have swept o
\er the land, defiling, corrupting, and polluting,
in their course, and almost sweeping away the
aicient land-marks of Christianity, but at the
same time, revealing the fact that there is more
| of pure Christianity among the slave popula
tion of a single slave State, than in all of New
England.
[ . Tenth. The crime of fostering societies for
at least thirty years, with the avowed and open
object of dissolving the Union —of teaching the
children to disobey and violate the Constitution
nnil to openly proclaim the great doctrine that
our Union was a "league with hell," and that
the children of the North should ho educated to
hate the South, than all which, wo venture to say,
no fouler treason can exist.
Eleventh. The crime of systematically back
biting, misrepresenting, and slandering the Clirs
tian people of the South, for the purpose of
creating, in this country nnd in Europe, bitter,
wicked, and unjust prejudices.
Twelfth. The crime of stop/ring the education of
staves, and causing laws to be passed against their
learning to read,solely because their ability to read
was advised by Abolition I'uritans —thus teach
ing the slaves insurrection, robbery and murder,
inciting them to rise against our white Union
citizens and to cut the throats of white men and
helpless and unoffending women and children—
thus compelling our white bretlwrii of the South

"Alas! Poor Indian!" .
For some months the country has been exci
te 1 by tales of Indian outrages in Minnesota
—men shot down—•women violated and led in
to captivity, nnd children tomahawked! The
terrible outrages of the early Indian wars ap
peared to be recnacting. Many journals advo
cated the same remedy that the abolitionists
would apply to the rebellion—extermination—
Abolition journals with their constitutional ap
petite for a falsehood at once found the cause
of this Indian outbreak in the machinations of
the "secessionists!" Some did not believe this,
but notwithstanding it was generally received
as the cause of the fiendish acts of the savages.
It now torus out to be all a mistake, this war
like all other wars has two sides, and that the
thieving propensities of the appointees ot this
administration was the real cause!
We find in the Pittsburg Gazette, an impor
tant communication from a reliable western
writer. lie gives the true reason of Otis sav
age war which has depopulated a considerable
portion of a prosperous young State. Ixt the
reader study the picture—count the co3t of
blood and treasure and put it down in the debt
or column of this administration.
But, alas, I find, upon a elosc scrutiny, that
(he foundation for the trouble lies upon a far
different kind of political formation, and that
the Southern rebellion has just as much to do
with the Indian war as the mud at the State
Fair grounds at Chicago, last fall, had to do
with the price of putty in Boston. '-What,"
you ask, "then, is the cause 1" I will answer
it in as few words as possible— dishonesty—the.
most barefaced and unmitigated dishonesty—on the
part of the Indian Agents in the transaction of
their business affairs. This, I know, is a sweep
ing charge, but I will prove it to the satisfaction
of the most doubting Thomas in Christendom.
You may be aware thnt the Sioux Indians, as
well as the North Western tribes, have a trea
ty with the government by which the "Great
Father" Samuel agrees to pay them, 'certain
sums of money, called"annuitics," and further,
the Great Father Samuel agrees to pay these
annuities in silver and gold. The Great Fath
er, Uncle Samuel, has always sent some of his
white children with tho spondulicks promptly
to the usual place of payment, to keep his faith
with his red children. Indeed he did so this
year. The Indian agents received their gold
and silver coin during the first week in June,
while there was not the least prospect of an out
break. But just then "legal tenders" went
down and gold went up, and the delectable ag
ent, with au eye to the main chance, conceived
the happy thought of selling the "yellow boys"
anil the red skins both at the same time. The
gold was bartered off for "green backs," with
which they sought to make the payments. But
tho dodge didn't work with the aborigines.—-
They knew tho difference between white and
yellow, and big and between light and
heavy; but as beWeen "demand" and "legal
tender," "safety fund" and "wild-cat" they
were as ignorant as female tropieanians arc of
tho arts of fashionable dress making. They
had some idea of the uses of metals, but to
them all paper was alike, and only fit for gun
wads. Of course they refused to be paid in a
nytlimg else than that which was properly their
due. The agents argued with them, expkuued
WHOLE NUMBER, 3©

of no use. Johnny Indian's optics were closed,
i and he could not discern the locality. The In
j dians' hunting season was coming on, the prai
ries would soon be tilled with bears, deer and
| dog, and the streams with animals of finer tin )
I but of what use were all these to him ? He
: had not the means with wliieli to trap the one,
| or the arms or ammunition with which to kill
j the other. He could buy nothing of the tra
ders without money, and lie could get no mon
ey of the agents. Starvation stared him in the
face; and, as a last resort, he seized upon the
Indian's only mode of redress, revenge. The
first few minor thefts and robberies were gob
bled up by the guilty agents, and made excuses
to still further defer the payments. Exagger
ated reports of the outrages were forwarded to
I the authorities and protection sought from the
| Government. .Startling stories of "rcoel em
issaries being at work" were heralded all over
i the North ; but not one word was uttered about
the attempt to palm oil' the "greenbacks," and
the final result was a terrible Indian war, in
which over one hundred of the settlers upon
the frontier liavc been killed, projierty to fhca
mount of at least five million dollars destroyed,
and the State set back at least five years in its
prosperity, anil the war has only lieen put down
at an expense already to the General Govern
-1 ment of over three millions of dollars, besides
drawing away from active service in more im
portant fields at least ten regiments of unpa
roled troops.
i The second nature of the official of this ile
lectably patriotic administration, under "honest
Abe!" appears to be to steal. He can't even
resist the temptation of stealing from the poor,
filthy, lousy savage! Let the whole country
be deluged with blood—whole communities be
swept out of existence —murder run riot with
assassinated men, tomahnwked women and
brained children in its train, yet stealing must
go on!
Then follows the remedy of these "only loy
al and christian people"—extermination and
confiscation. "Alas Four Indian 1"

invv..... v - -COOL"
our remarks on "The war and the schools,'
printed in the Gazette a few weeks ago, and
comments on them as follows :
"litis extract is from the educational column
of a late number of the Bedford Gazette, — a
column, by the by, conducted with great spirit
and regularity, it was written while it was
supposed the draft would take away very many
teachers; and, though the evil has in a measure
passed from the system —still most of its sug
gestions remain seasonable and worthy of atten
tion. With the exception of one or two passa
ges, we like its object and tone. The remark,
'•let all who are willing and at all qualified to
teach, be examined. We may be mistaken, but
are of opinion they will find employment j" if
intended to convey the idea that, whether qual
ified or not, such should be employed—is not
based upon a polity that should, at any time,
be adopted. Probably such was not the mean
in" of the writer. No true friend of the system
should be disheartened by any sudden emergen
cy, to the extent of lowering the standard of
the teacher's qualifications to the.grade of all
who choose to oficr their services in a time of
panic. On the contrary, lie will enter n plain
and emphatic protest against a course so suici
dal. Potter, far better to allow a school, here
and there, 1° remain a month or two without a
teacher, t)ia" to insist upon opening them all on
the prescribed day, with such teaojiers as shall
then offer, whether competent or not.
We are no advocates i>f the lazy man's ad
age —"something will turn up" —to excuse his
inactivity or neglect of duty. But in this case
we do say, that if a board of directors have ex
erted itself to the utmost, by advertising for
teachers in time and by offering as large sala
ries as the wants of the schools ami tlio circum
stances of the district render proper, and still
fail to.fill their list-—it will be better for youth
of the district to wait, than to waste the mon
ey of the parents ami the time of the children
by tlio employment of incompetent persons. In
most of such eases "something will turn up;"
some desirable teacher will come along—espe
cially if the call for his services be rendered a
little louder by the addition of few dollars to
the salary; and the result wtll justify the delay.
But if not, the other expedient, recommend
ed and urged by the Educational Editor of the
Gazette, is the right one. In fact, its compul
sory claim to tho notice of directors and its
more general adoption in the southern part of
the State, is one ntiiongst the unlooked for but
lteneficial effects of this awful rebellion. If the
war open up to the intelligent females of the
Ntato more, largely than at present, the profes
sion of teaching; if it cause them properly to
prepare themselves for its duties; if it compel
directors —whether willingly or unwillingly is a
matter of little moment —to consider their fit
ness ami to accept their services; and if it com
mit the schools to the teaching, and tho hearts
and ntinds of the pupils to the infiucnce of fe
male kindness nnd tact, when accompanied with
competent professional qualifications —then will
a great good be effected and the future have at i
least one rodoetning and enduring blessing to bo
grateful for to the convulsion through which the
country Is passing. Tho prejudice against tho
female"teacher has been one of the most stub
born as well as unfounded, encountered in tbo
southern portions of this State. Like other
long settled abuses, perhups it required, in tbo

clement of society, to overcome it. It is now
evidently undergoing that process.
The Gazette gives figures that may mislead as
to the number of females employed in the conn*
tics named. 'Those of males and females ad*
tied together in the counties instanced, make an
aggregate greater than the whole number of
their schools. This is accounted for by the fact
that in most of them there are two terms of
school—the summer and the winter; the sum
mer schools being almost entirely taught by fe
males, and the winter mainly, but not entirely,
by males. Still, the fact generally is as stated,
viz:—that these counties have a very laige per
' rentage of female teachers. Bo is the other fact,
or rather result—that the arrangement has work
ed to the satisfaction of all concerned.
The general conclusion of the article—that
directors can now avail themselves of the high
est grade of female qualification, for the Same
compensation payable for the lowest grade of
male teachers—is both sound and expedient.
We are not amongst those who think that a
competent teacher is to be paid less because a
female than if a male. But we must, for the
present, take things as they arc. The question
is, whether some of the schools shall be opened
at the usual time, or even at all. And if wq
can have them opened, by giving the low salary
of incompetent males to competent fewales, wet
are willing to see them opened on these terms;
satisfied that the success of these "substitutes"
will soon win round hesitating directors to the
policy of their more general employment, and
that common honesty will ultimately lead to
their equal compensation, on the ground of e
qual services rendered. •*
On looking over this article, wo rather sua*
pcct that, in some points, a construction has
been given to the article from the Gazette, not £
intended by the writer. But then we wanted a
text for these remarks; and now conclude by
recommending the views of our editorial broth
er to the reader, in the sense in which, no doubt,
he intended they should be understood. It is •
by such well timed suggestions that the conduc
tors of the local educational press can do the
most good. They hit points of local questions
and give the clue out of local difficulties, which
morn distant and more general observers cannot
possibly reach."
These comments seem to ua to be a sin
gular mixture of acidity and sweetness.—
Mr. Burrowes spanks us with one hand and
throws us sugar plums with the other in a
ted to"make "any ravofablytfisposect juvenile
whimper and simper by turns, as he suffers
the one or swallows the other. Hd likes
the article very much "with the exception
of one or two passagesbut he neverthe- %
less feels it his duty to scold us for urging
the employment of teachers not properly
qualified. Who, except Mr. Bun-owes, ev
er suspected us of holding such views | and
who, except him, would draw such a con
clusion from the passage he quotes? We
took it for granted, in our remarks, that an
examination would show whether candidates
were properly qualified or not, and hence we
said "let all who are willing and at all qual
ified to teacii be examined.' I '' It is true that
our private opinion has long been that ex
aminations do not always show this; and
that the county Super in tendency, as a fea
ture of our school law, has not been so ef
fectual in excluding unqualified teachers as
could be wished. But then we do not al
ways express that opinion—partjy because
its expression would do no good; and part
ly, perhaps, out of respect for Mr. Burrowes
who is the originator and champion of the
County Superintendcncy.
But, after belaboring us soundly, Mr.
Burrowes faces about and says: "Probably
such was not (lie moaning of the writer."
Ah, indeed! very probably it was not. We
do not. like to interfere with Mr. Burrowes'
excellent English, but we submit that he
would have improved the sentence jflst quo
ted, if lie had made it stand thus: "Prob
ably such was not the meaning of the wri
ter, especially as he says nothing at all of
the kind.'' We may hold many erroneous
opinions with respect to education, and shall
always be happy to have them corrected by
authority so eminent as Mr. Burrowes. Bu
we deny that we have Written what can frfir
ly be so grossly misunderstood. We are
unwilling to be placed in the position of hav
ing printed such foggy English.
Again, Mr. Burrowes is afraid our figures
may mislead. So they may, and so may
others taken from the same source. But
as they are taken verbatim from the school
reports prepared by Mr. Burrowes himself,
we hope he will pardon us for not express
ing this opinion before, and for not volun
teering an explanation which might reflect
upon his accuracy as a statistician;
In conclusion, we remind the readers of
the Jownal that the ambiguity- complained
of by Mr. Burrowes, is supposed by him to
be in the article he quotes from the Gazette.
We do this lest some of his readers shonli
attribute it to the wrong writer.
