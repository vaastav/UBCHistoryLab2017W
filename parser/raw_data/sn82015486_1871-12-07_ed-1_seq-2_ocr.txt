an excn for o dinjf, they take to themselves
charges that we never made agBinst theuu ffr
never aaid thev had wild ont,(or wrre Venal,) and
we never aaid ihcy bolted the Bcpnblicou ticket.
We did ay they lent tbcnis.-lvea to throw nmd at
ns for acensing certain men of attempting to to
tray the Republican imrty, wncn they knew we
had stated farts, and when they knew, In-fore the
election, that an attempt waa on foot tn swindle
Republican voter with a frandnlrnt ticket, and
had taken no means to pnt voter nn their gnsnl.
We have no donbf they voted tbestreight nepnb
lican ticket so did we, from tI to bottom and
we have no donbt they are at heart sonnd Repnlr
licaus hence, we did not doubt that tbey pitched
into na to enrry favor with the guilty one whom
we had stirred np with a hot i'ker.
And to this the BeniiMi'i-nse na Beam:

lias bolted ticketa in tbepast, whenever they did

our record and reputation, they give na no uneas
iness, and we hope Hi" Republican will not worry
aboat them. And wo Mispect that all the venal
ity we have exhibited, since BlULE & SAxnonx
li.ivc known ids has been nothing oat of their
purse. The remaining charge, of our having
bolted tickets in the past, is a favorite charge,
nosed over by every new importation that comes
into the County to flourish for a brief season, and
do his masters' ill to he kicked out as soon as
he musters np independence enough to imagine
that he haa a will of his own. For the benefit of
the editors of the Republican, their informers and
prompters, we will give a bit of history, showing
how we bolted the Republican ticket. To begin:
We have never bolted a regularly nominated Ke
pnblican ticket or candidate. Republican County
Conventions were regularly held in this Connty,
from 1857 down to the commencement of the war,
and in the years 151, 1J2, aud 153. There nev
er was a bolt from n ticket during all that time
there was harmony, and a united support of the
ticket, with almost invariable sneers. Hut in
1864, an clement camo into onr Comity politics,
that haa kept up discord and bolting ever since.
In the year 154, a Legislature was to be elec
ted, that would have the choosing of n United
States Senator. Almut tho time a Comity Con
vention was being talked up, a sijuad of olliccrs
from tho army made their appearand- in the Coun
ty, as they did in nearly every Comity in the
State, wboliad lieeu furlonghed by Gou.ToM Ew
INO from his division and his body-guard, for the
purpose of returning to Kansas running fertile
Legislature, and electing Jiim tn the United States
Senate. These men at oucr put their veto upon
a Convention. They would ran, whether or no;
and if they were not given a clear field, they
would divide the Anti-LAXK vote, and insure the
election of Lank men, horn it was desired to de
feat. The issne was then Laxk and Aiiti-LxNK,
and there was a large Anti-LAXK majority in tho
Comity. Rather than see such a result, the Anti
LAXK candidates withdrew, in favor of this de
tachment from the army tho latter pledging
ing themselves to vote against Lank under all
circumstances, n hetlier they could elect the man
of their choice or not. So the Convention was net
aside, and an independent race made. Several of
the body-guard were elected, one was defeated,
and the Lank men managed to take in most of the
County offices. When the legislature met, it was
found that Ewixg was a dead duck, and every
one of his men from this County, in i iolation of
their pledges, voted for Lank for what consider
ation, there has been a pretty unanimous belief
among the people of tho County ever since. We
may remark here, that not one of those men lias
been elected to office in the Connty since, and tho
candidates they have f.ivored, have almost inva
riably been beaten in Convention.
But these gentlemen found the Comity offices
filled by good Republicans, win-so places they
-wanted for their friends. They had come home
to rnn the Comity, and they determined to regu
late things. In order to do this, their independ
ent ticket arrangement wonld not do, for the peo
ple wrre not with them. Therefore, in 13, they
were hot for a Convention they could manage
that. But the old County Central Committee,
that held over from 153, would not ib the men
did not ault them. So they travelled over the
Connty, preaching up the necessity tor a thorough
re-organization of the party in tho Comity, but
received very little encouragement, except from
theirownhangcrs-on. However, they were txtnud
to go it; so they met in mass convention at Troy,
and appointed s Central Committee of their own.
There was no person present from Iowa Township,
bnt they ran across an old seed in the street, who
lived near the month of Wolf, who never" had, and
haa never since, voted the Republican ticket him
they inveigled into the meeting, and made a Com
mitteeman for Iowa Township. Then they called
a Convention, ami held it, and nominated a ticket
of their own. They wrre Umnd to clean out the
nest of thieves and rascals who ocenpicil the Comi
ty offices.
Tho men who hail lieeu keeping up the party
organizatinn, determined they wonld not submit
to the dictation of this-clique of upstarts, who
said Convention or no Convention, as pleased
them, and who coolly went to work to set aside
the rrgnlsr organization, and form one of their
own. They therefore pot forth nn independent
ticket of their own, some of the candidates on
which were veterans from the army, who had lieen
disabled in battle, and had made faithful officers.
We were a candidate on that ticket, and support
ed It; and the whole ticket was elected by a tri
emphaat majority. That was the way we bolted
a Bepnbliran ticket. The ring-leaders of that
Bogt who were thus cleaned out, were the aelf
aaaae men who attempted to run the late Convcn
tion,in this Connty, and who attempted to defeat
a portion of the ticket because they were out-grn-eraled.
-
That is the whole hiotory of our Wring a Re
publican ticket. And now, aa to onr threat of
lmlting again. We gave notiee,a few week since,
uai u any .or the men who went into tho
late Republican Couvrntion, thus tacitly binding
themselves to support its ticket, hut who. for
pita, attempted to defeat a portion of the ticket,
were ever nominated for office by the Republicans
of this Connty, the CkZf would, bolt the ticket.
We propose to stick to that text!

Thrt season of the year is at liand, when every
man whom tiie jrtiutrr owrn is after his money,
nil tt hen ho nerds all that others owe him. We
find it necessary to make ouranuual rail upon our
mlwcriliers.
Last Summer, a the reader Is aware, we en
larged and Improved onr paper. We w ere forced
-to get aew tyn-, for our oM drees was worn out;
and while we were doing so, we endeavored to get
the very beat; ami we made intptirreutcuts be
yond what onr patronage justiBed, and, in fact,
beyond what we were justly able to do. We eal
enlatnl tint the irren-assir$trtronage the improve
ment wonld bring, wwiW make np for the outlay.
Our latnmagu has- been handsomely increased,
bnt still not as much ns it should be, considering
the increase at expense. A gnat many of onr
subscribers ere J'et In arrears for one or more years.
In order to keep onr paper up to its present stan
dard, we- nmst have prompt payment from all.
We nnrst ask, therefore, that every one who has
nut dbno so, make payment in full, without neces
sary delay. We wish to bring our business as
nearly to a rash basis ris possible. An extensive
criilit business Is ruinous to a newspaper. Those
wln do not find the. amonnt of their indebtedness
marked npon their papers, can ascertain it by
applying to this office. Thiainvitation i general.

IV (iKiimik K. Clayton, of Ilmwn County, is
again in trouble, Gkoihif. is always in trouble,
and always has a petition in circulation, repre
senting that he is an injured martyr, and asking
that something that has lieen done to his discom
fort be undone. Once it was the penitentiary
that grieved him now he has been tnrned ont of
tho Claj toiiville 1'ost Office, aud a Republican
appointed in his place; and he has got np a peti
tion, signed by all the men, women and children
in his latitude, including the Kickapno Reserve,
showing that bu is a wronged man, and that the
good of the nation requires bis re-iustatement in
the Post Office. Then ha fills ever two columns
of the Hiawatha DUpalck with bis grievances and
petitions, 'lie therefore prays for the emission of
Skkman!
XV We like the way Judge WKnn, of one of
the Southern Districts of this State, jerks the fil
ling ont of ancient humbugs and modern imposi
tions. Some time since, he pnt the veto npon
jail-birds and professional rascals testifying in his
Conrt; and now he has decided that grand swin
dle, tho Texas cattle law, unconstitutional. Wo
have believed, from the start, that that law was
got npin the interest of cattle speculators in Kan
sas, and that the pretended ground for the law
was a fraud and a humbug. We say, no emliar-
gocs upon tn.de in aud through, Kansas. There
are still other subjects that Judge Wrjin should
try his hand on. ,
3" The Atchison Patriot wishes there were
more jonmals throughout the country, not so
much attached to party. The 'Patriot is a nice
sheet to deprecate attachment to party. Why, if
the Democratic lawgivers were to solemnly de
clare, as a new departure, that it is the duty of
every good Democrat to live on night-soil, the ed
itor of the Patriot would at once provide himself
with a snitable liowl and spoon, and taunt the
Radicals with being arristocratic and over nice!

recently nte aliout one-third of the blanket that
covered him in lied, which caned his death. It
would have lieen had ennngh, had not his connec

respectable connections foundering himself on
second-liand lied-hlanket horrible!
jT Say, you lsiys who are engineering that

IV Marshall County has jnst gone through tho
second heat of her County Seat contest. Marys

voti-s! The licst of the joke is, she wonld have
lieen successful without any illegal votes. The
Central Branch scheme failed, that time.
JVMlLT. Rkyxolds, having at last got ap
pointed to an office, publishes a long editorial,
showing tho ad van! ago of appointing "Rcpresent
atie Men," men of ability and influence, to im
portant offices. Go slow; those fat places are
mighty uncertain in Kansas.
XV Tiie Democrats accidentally got a majority
in the Indiana legislature, last year, and elected
a State rriter. Hriias already stolen ovrrf20,000

goes to stealing. '
t iT HoRNKR, of the Chetopa Ad ranee, and SrK)N

damages, and the latter $25. This should lie a
warning to them to always tell the truth, aa we
do.
XV For the lienent of' the Atchison Patriot,
which publishes an opinion of the Ckirf in italics,
we will say that we consider a man who is right
in some things and wrong in others, a much bet
ter man than one who is wrong in all things.

A Tkxas Cattlk Drcisiox-Onr readers are
all aw are that onr State has a statnte against dri
ving Texas cattle through Kansas during certain
period. We find the following in the Osage Mis
sion Journal, bnt without a fnll statement -of the
rase we are nnable to state what the farts were,
exrept that Judge Webb has declared the Texas
rattle law unconstitutional:
From Messrs. Hutching &. O'Grady. who have
jqst returned from, attendance on thr terms of
court in Allen and Labette Counties, we get the
following item :
James C. Barrett v s. 31. Barnes at al. This rase
was brought by plaintiff in Laliette County against
31. Barnes, sheriff, and John Ryane, Joseph Rov
rmft and D. D. Bray, sureties on bis official lioud,
to recovrr the sum of six t honsand dollars damage
for Texas rattle taken from the possession of the
shrntr, in l-aliette County, and killed by a mob.
3Iesrs. Hntchingt & O'Grady, attorneys for the
sheriff, tiled a demurrer to the plaintiff's petition,
raising among other points to constitutionality of
theTexasrattlelaw. JuilgeWebb,nfthieleventh
district, sustained the demurrer and held the law
uneonstitntional.
The X.Y. 7Vi"4r, which is not tronbled with an
excess of orthodiixv. fuivn- l' , .'
that the IT. 8. Grand Lodge of Odd Fellows, at its
session in Chicago, refused to allow the sulwrdi
nate lodges to meet on Snnday.' Xot that we
tbink.au v specific harm would come merely from
this particular use of the dav; but we are opposed
to anything which teuds to increase the already
too great tenfenry to break down the obser
vance, of the Sabbath. Irrespective of any re
ligions nnestiou, wblrh we do not now and
here discuss, the diftirnlty is that its srcnlari
xation will tend to dimish Its prestige as a
season or rest from physical labor; andjbis wonld
he a consummation to be deprecated, for the rea
aon that in this over active, and, as we sometimes
,mk 5,",V bny country, a very little opportu
nity will set a considerable portion of pnidnrers
at work on Sunday, thus complicating .the labor
question, which. Heaven knows, is complicated
enough alreadv."
The Abilene Chronicle has lieen informal by Mr.
Patrick Hand, who has jnst returned from a trip
np the Solomon Valley to the Colorado and Ne
braska line, that the new settlers have severely
wiffered from the rold and storm. Mr. Hand says
that the fall immigration info the Solomon Valley
is unprecedented. Jlany fainiKcs arrived just
before the late storm, aud the suffrring among
them is terrible. -Haying."no nnnscs, they are
compelled to lire in their "moving wagona," and
the suffering among- the women and rhildreif, par
iirnutny, is very severe. To add to tne nanlslnp
of the situation, the ieople are almost entirely
destitute of food; many uf them having scarcely
tasted a mouthful ofbread since reaching the valley.
They are tn ine to subsist mainlr niwn sneb mine,
as they may lie able to sernre. Tins situation of
affairs exists from Mitchell couuty northward and
northwestward, up both branches of the river.
The people of Mitchell connty have Hersey's mill
at Iteloit, and there is barely grain enoughin that
county for home consumption ; but in counties be-
ond, the pmsieet is gloomy enough until a new
crop can lie raised.
3Ir. Hand says that a great many animals have
perished in the valley in consequence of the storm,
ami that several mm were frozen to death. People
were totally nnpreparrd for cold weather, not an
ticipating that it wonld set in until some time in
December. It is hoped that the old settlers in the
Solomon valley will take prompt measures for the
relief of the new comers.
In some ofthecntsonthe Wathenai. Doniphan
Railroad, near Petersburg, large quantities of
pjriteaof iron aud thin veins of chalk have been
found. The latter might prove profitable mining,
if a vein of sufficient thickness ran be discovered.
So the Wathcua Reporter thinks.
The Clay Centre Independent says" that nn
Wednesday last, Mrs. Payne, living nine miles
north of that plare, had her house burned. It was
one of the coldest mornings of the season. Noth
ing was saved cxcrjtt their night clothes; and in
that condition they were obliged to remain until
her son went one and a half miles to procure help.
Jlrs. Payne's husband is au old gentleman, seven
ty years of ace. and haa been deranced for the
last five years. It required tho ntmost endeavors
of Jlrs. P. to keep her husband from flinging hint-
sen into i lie names. Ills leet nave been oaiuy
frozen. The fire sw opt ever thing they possessed
in the way of clothing and household furniture.
Their neighbors, as w ell as the citizens of Clay
Centre, have ruqKiudnl liderally in relieving
their wants.
A school teacher in Fredonia, named Martin,
lately whipjied a boy named McMhIijii se erely.
In return young 3IcMahan's father assaulted the
teacher, and broke the bridge of the teacher's
nose with a stone. The teacher was fined f 10 for
assaulting the boy, and McMahan was fined fcJO
for assaulting the teacher.
The Leavenworth Time is informed that last
Sunday evening a shooting affray occurred on
Kickaimo Island, above the fort, when one John
T. Wilson endeavored to murder his eon, Wm.
Wilson. He shot him in one of the anus, tho ball
glancing aud striking him in the breast. The boy
was removed to Leavenworth, taken to the hos-
Cital, and a warreut issued for the arrest of Wilson
y Justice Gould of Leavenworth. Tho boy will
probably recover.
The Saliua Journal says many rattle and horses
have been frozen to death ill Sailnu county during
the cold snap. Sixteen head of rattle wrre frozen
in the stock yards at Sauna.
William II. llrazel, of Greenwood county, and
John Hutchinson, of Montgomery county, charged
with counterfeiting, were taken tn the Topeka

Two Wichita stable men, named resiieetivcly
Wilcox and Miller, got into an altercation with
butcher knives, nn Wednesday last. Wilcox suc
ceeded iu cutting Miller slightly in a couple of
places, w hen the city marshal put in an appear
ance and arrested both parties.
Frank Hiiber killed a man at Oswego many
months ago. He was tried at Chetopa last sum
mer, convicted and senfenced to be hung. Gov
ernor Harvey respited him, and tho supreme
court granted a new trial. A change of venue
was obtained to Crawford county. Oil Thursday
night last Hnlter sletit ct t he Clorer House, Oswego,
iu the same bed with his lawyer. J. Crirhton, Esq.,
of Chetopa. The sheriff locked them np and had
tho key to the room, which was in the seceiul sto
ry of the hotel. During the night a hole was cut
in the roof, o er the lied room, and Hnlier escaped.
At last accounts he had not lieen found. It is
said he did the killing in self-defence.
Fihst Daily Papkil We see it stated in a
notice of Charles W. Helm that he edited the tint
daily paer in Kansas, the Leavenworth Herald.
In one sense this is tine, and in another it is not.
As a K-miancnt paper it was. The Kanmt Free
man was the first daily paper except the Daily
Kama Tribune, published a week in April, le35,
ever printed iu Kansas, and was started by E. C.
K. Garvey, in Novemlier, 1855, and published
during the session of the well known Toprka Con
stitutional Convention. JMKrenee Tribune,

The Colnmbns Independent says: We are in
formed that 3I:rjor I'pham's cavalry company,
now stationed at Limestone, has lieen 'ordered to
tho Arkansas river ronntry, to remove settlers
from the Indian Territory. The company will
start in the course of ten days. We hope, how
ever, the weather will moderate Iieforc any action
is taken in the matter, for the greater iortioii of
them wonld rrrtainly suffer if they were removed
now. We imagine that settlers will learn, after
Iieing driven off a few more times, to keep ont of
the Territory.
The Wathcua Reporter says that sometime ago
a young man named Fitzgerald was bitten by a
dog belonging to .Martin .Mack", wlio lives lielow
town. One day last week young Fitzgerald, ac
companied by hi father, proceeded to the resi
dence of 3Ir. Slack, and after breaking down the
door, entered the house and shot the dog. 3lr.
Slack had the parties arrested and taken before
Esquire Dixon, last Thursday, who mulcted them
in .the sum of (40 and costs, the whole amounting
to $50.
Got. Carney, the great grocer, sold his large
warehouse on thernrnrr of Choctaw and the levee,
Leavenworth, to.Cliarles Knnz,theemetient brew

to convert the building into a malt house. The
hnilding originally cost $50,000.
We have reason to believe, at the next session
of Congress, arrangements will will lie made by
which every settler on the Osage Lands will be
enabled tn secure a title to his laud for $125 per
acre. There is, in onr opinion, nn cause for fear.
Jnstice will be done to the settlers. The whole
matter has lieen laid before Senator Pomcrny, who
is now in Washington, and with his earnest sup
port, we have every reason to lieliere that-in no
rase will the settlers lie driven off their Iambi.

As Rnfus Smith and family, recently from 31a

It was ransed by a defective fine in Dr. Perrine's

We are informed by the Neodsha Cithen that a
young man named William G. Anderson came to

town tonic an intrest in his welfare, and treated
him with great kindness and attention. Three
days after coming to the hotel the stranger died.
and on the day following was buried in the ceme
tery, north of town. Before becoming nncon
scions, the young man gave Dr. Blakeslee his
name as iiluun b. Anderson, and his home as
brinjr at Kosciusko, Mississippi. He also gave
the doctor the address of friends at Kosciusko, to
FEArartx Ettect or the Rrccrr Stob. Mr.
Panghoru, correspondent of the Kansas City Jisms,
writes to his iaper the partiealars of an incident
of the late severe storm west of here. He -writes
from Wamegn, and saya that reports from the
plains concerning the storm are of the most har
rowing nature. On Thursday. and Friday, hear
ing a reKirt that thirteen men had been found
frozen tn death near Hays City, he started for
that jsiint tn find out aboat themotter. He says:
Oil the train I found Orderly 8ergeant Harvey,
of the Sixth cavalry, who left Fort Hays on the
ttltlijn charge of a detachment for Leavenworth.
He states that joat at dusk on thatday he discov
ered six men, all of whom bad been badly frozen.
Thry wrre in a ranch on the banks of Smoky riv
er, about seven miles from Hays City, aud were
suffrriug terrible agony.. Three of them were
considered to be in a dangerous condition, while
the others had fared but little better. The ser
geant saw that tbey were well cared for and then
proceeded on bis Journey. When near Five Mile'
hollow on the old Santa Fe road, the sergeant's
party came npon the corpse of a white man, ami a
little farther ou that of a negro, both having per
ished in tiie snow storm. These two had belonged
to the same party as the six pre ionsly men
tioned, having with them abandoned a train. Up
to the time of bis leaving Hays City the sergeant
reports the bringing in of seven bodies, and fears
are entertained that as many as thirty-five or
forty men have perished. It is known that full
that number were embraced in the different hun
ting parties then out, and as yet the company of
cavalry searching the plains have not reported the
discovery of a solitary man.
Relics. Mr. W. F. Steele, while digging post
holes on the grounds of John Marcus, of this of
fice, unearthed the follow ingjnventory of aborigi
nal relics: An old rattle-box, portions of a pair
of moccasins, a chain with a medal bearing some
indecipherable inscription and snrmnnnted with a
crncifix, a pair of ear jiendan ts, a penknife, a glass
stopper, with pieces of bone supposed to belong
tn the human anatomy. There is quite an open
ing in the earth where these relics were found,
and it is not unlikely that it was tho grave of an
Indian child, as the rattler and the moccasin,
which is a small onr, wonld seem to indicate.
Who knows bnt therarth In and around Cnnnril
Grove is destined Iq time to come tn yield rich
stores of Indian relics, and when the uohle Ka w
shall have been removed to greener pastures or
revel in the "happy hunting grounds" in store
for all good Indians, and their existence here
among ns become only a matter of tradition to
the "oldest inhabitant," nn doubt relic hunters
and humanitarians will flock hither from all
quarters and delve in these destined classic
grounds for evidences of the existence of a no

Some of our Kansas exchanges are discussing
the qnestinn of "money iu politics," one or two
going so far a to say that "money" influenced
the choice of U. 8. senator from this State last
winter. Wonldn't it lm as well for some of the
papers referred tn tn qnit their humbug twaddle
and tell ns "how ninch" they received f It would
aid in the "purification" of our politics, even if
some of the papers that know so much alxmt
"how it was done" were rampant "purifiers."
Abilene Chronicle.
A 3Ian' Hkad SruT Open With an Axe. In
the timlier bark of Elwood, a nnmlier of choppers
are engaged in rutting timlwr for the St. Joe
bridge. Tuesday afternoon a man named 3IrNa
mara came near losing his life in a singnlar man
ner. He had rlimtied up into the top of a fallen
tree, was standing on one limb several feet above
the ground, leaning with his hack against anoth
er and cutting a third in front of him. The limb
against which he was leaning suddenly broke,
and he was percipitated to the ground. His axe
was thrown np several leet, and fell, edge down
ward, npon the top of SfcN'auiara's head, rntting
a fearful gash, breaking throngh the skull. His
left wrist was alsn broken by the fall.
Fire at Hiawatha. We are informed that on
Wednesday night, Novemlier 29th, a destructive
conflagration nrcnrrrd at Hiawatha. Kansas, des
troying a largo proportion of the buildings on the
east sidenf theSqnare. Among the houses burned
wrre the hardware store of 3Ir. Blakesl v. the fam
ily grocery store of 3Ir. Dickson, the shoe shops of
.Messrs. .imniernian ami llnttrrnrlil, ami the drug
store of Messrs. 3Iitchcll & Zehntng. The total
loss, it is said, will foot np $20,000.
We have learned no particulars In reference to
tho origin of the fire, and nothing as to the insu
rance. Wo learn from the Ottawa Herald that a sad
affair oceiirreil on Wednesday last, resnltingin the
death of John Holowav, who lived on 3fosquitoe
creek, aliout "twelvo miles southeast of that city.
The particulars of theaffairarcas follows: Young
Holoway, in company w itb three or four neigh
bors, came to Ottawa on that day, and while
there indulged rather freely in strong drink. On
their way home thy stopped at Rock creek tn
water their horses, when it was discovered that
Holoway was insensible. One of the others drove
his team as far a Mr. McNntt's, some six miles
further, when Holoway was put into a cold room
without fire or Iieddinsr. and left for the nichr.
The next morning his father found him bruised
and rovrrrd with blood, and nearly drad. He
wastakriihome,hutdittla!mntfiveo'eiockthranie
evening. The physician who was called pro
nounced death caused by the bursting of a blood
vessel, but at what time this occurred is impossi
ble to tell. Had he received such care as even a
dumb animal is entitled tn when in distress, his
life might doubtless have lieen saved.

The announcement that the Amerirns Club, a
Tammany organization, lias erased tn exist, will
bring mourning, according to thr New York He
rald, tn many an individual w ho has reveled iu
the, lsiiintiesof the defunct Ring in that city. The
"Tiger's'' welcome growl will nn longer lie heard.
"Big six" will no longer invite "the Isiys" to the
groaning festive lioanl, to thrgorgeons'liall room,
tn the grand fete ehamperir at Indian Ifarlsir,
where a guest could keep Jolly while the season
lasted, or as long as lie liehavcd himself. Well
may the memlM-rs of the Amerirns Club and their
many friends exclaim: "Farewell! a long fare
well to all onr joys! farewell to champagne, to ran-vas-liaeks,
to salmon, tn speckled trout! there's
nothing left bnt eel simp and clam chowder for
the boys!"
Look Out. We would have our ritizrns look
out for something authongbt of in insnranre busi
ness. The .Life Association of America seems to
be in a fix, from the fact that David U. Boogher,
heretofore one of its prominent agents, has filed a
bill in equity in tho circuit court of St. Louis, as
king that a receiver be appointed for the Associa
tion, "on the ground that the Board of Managers
oi inai institnnon nave rommitteu nanus anil
conspired to appropriate to their nse for individ
ual benefit, the profits-aiid assets of the Associa
tion." Mr. Boogher, we learn, haa lieen a Ions
time connected with the Association, and is well
posted in all iu workings and management. We
wonld therefore caution our friends to "look be
fore they leap." Hail) Call.
Dkmocbtic Fl-XEHAL. The citizens of 'ew
York are respcctfully'lnyited to attend the
POLITICAL rUXF.tlAL
of Wm. M, Tweed, on Wednesday, the 7th of Xo
vember, at the Connty ronrt honse. The exer
cises will be conducted by Archbishop O'Connor,
with seventy able assistants. The services will
commence by singing that grand old hymn of Dr.
Watts, " Believing we rejoice to see the cnrse re-
movril. ". At too conclusion of singing the hymn,
an eloonent discourse will lie nronouncal by Key.
Edward Pfrrpont, from that most' appropriate
text, "Lord, by this time hestinkctb." This con
gregation are invited to attend.
The Milwaukee Sentinel administers a parting
kick to a eonple of gentlemen wlm figured in the
late canvass in Wisconsin, after this style:
"The two Chicago lawyers, Doolittlr and Bragg,
who came lip to Wisconsin to 'have a little fnn
with tho boys,' have got aliout all they bargained
for, and ran return to Illinois to pursue their reg
ular pettifogging, rerhaps in two years from
this time, when they are wnm ont with profess
ional duties ami need a little recreation, and no
Wisconsin Democrat want to lie beaten, they
may again lie complimented with a place on the
State ticket. Aa the whole thing will be done by
brag next time, we suggest that Brags; lead the
ticket."
Tire Scerecder Party-. The Democratic mr.
ty is casting about desperately for a policy. The
"new drinrtnre." the "passive proposition. " the
-'railroad lease" ideas are all being agitated and
disenssrd. Onr suggestion to them is to take np
the famous "surrender" platform, which was so
popmar witn uemocraey in IBM. Aa a "surren
der" party the modern Democratic organization
has been a decided success. It haa successively
abandoned iUown traditions and those of the
country, the national Bag, the national honor, re
pudiated the national credit, and parted even
with honesty ami self-respect. Xow let it surren
der its existence and name. PiiladeipUa Pro.
It is the opinion of some pork packers that there
will be ten per rent, more hogs this year than
last; others insist that though the bog crop will
show a large increase in Indiana and throughout
the Northwest, there will 13 a decrease in Kentucky.-
There is an immense corn crop, and which
can be made more profitable to a farmer by being
pnt into pork than by being sent to market in any
other way. This, it is cUinjedVwill cause the
farmers of Indiana to fattrn every hog they ran
