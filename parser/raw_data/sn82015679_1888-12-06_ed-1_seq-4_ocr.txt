Yesterday was a good day for persons to
be oat whe lacked sand. The air was fall of
it.
TllE recent election, in this State at least,
was a farce and a fraud, and every intelligent
man in Indiana knows it. SentineL
It was as far as the Democratic managers
with their unlimited boodle and corrupt
schemes couli make it so, but the Republic
an victory was fairly won in spite of them.
Professor Dabney, of Bloomington, who
has suddenly achieved a limited notoriety by
his professed knowledge of the buying of
Totes in his town, at the rate of three glit
tering five-dollar gold pieces for each, should
have a chance to make his information useful.
"We trust that Professor Dabney will be sum
moned before the grand jury without delay.
ONE thing Mr. Cleveland settles in his last
message, beyond room for dispute, and that
is that he and his party are fiat-footed for
free trade, with no nonsensical mask of
'tariff -re form. " If this latest utterance had
been made at the beginning of the campaign,
the hollow pretense of Democratic orators,
that the party policy was something else than
free trade, would never have been ventured.
ilR. Joseph E. McDonald has not profited
by the suggestion made to him by that other
eminent Democrat, Mr. Dick Bright, to the
effect that the best course in case of defeat is
to take the medicine like little men. Mr.
McDonald was not a candidate, but he had a
take in the campaign, and defeat goes even
harder with him than with Thurman, whom
he succeeded in nominating over Gray. The
ex-Senator from Ohio takes his medicine
with few wry faces, but his Indiana brother
sot only refuses to taste it, but continues to
whine.
Private letters received in Boston from
Durham, N. C. aver that the recent expul
sion of a Northern man named Jordan, from
that town was "more of a social than a polit
ical demonstration." "Whether social or po
litical, it was not an occurrence to be regard
ed with favor by Northern men who contem
plate emigrating to the South. The fre
quency of such little "social" attentions to
unoffending residents of Republican procliv
ities has had much to do with making cer
tain parts of the South the unimproved, God
forsaken regions they are.
Horticulture is certainly one of the
State's important industries, and being dis
tinct from agriculture, as the latter is com
monly regarded, should not be confounded
with it - in the estimates of expenses for the
improvement and encouragement of either
ecienee. The Indiana horticulturists have
labored under many disadvantages in tha ef
fort to acquaint the public with the progress
of their work, but they have persevered in in
dividual effort, and, as their reports and dis
plays of fruit indicate, have achieved results
of which they may well be proud. They ask
but little of the State in aid of developing
their theories and making known the result,
and this little the coming Legislature should
cheerfully grant, since the public will receive
all the benefits.
JOEK Bright is evidently very near his
jnd. He is not as old as Gladstone by three
years, but the latter has greatly the advantage
-n mental and physical vigor. Mr. Bright has
ad a long and illustrious career. A member
f Parliament for more than forty years, he
has been prominently identified with nearly
ill the reforms of the most progressive
period in English history. He was not always
in the popular side of every question, but it
jenerally proved to be the right 6ide, and
his earnest convictions, commanding elo
quence and high character have contributed
largely to the success of almost every cause
q has espoused. With increasing years he
ias grown conservative and developed a ten
iency to oppose rather than lead the march of
progress. His rank as a political reformer
nd liberal leader was higher, and his fame
uore symmetrically great ten years ago than
Ihey are to-day, but he is still one of the
rand old men of this century.
The oiEce boys and janitors are apparently
required to do double duty by acting as night
editors of several of the Journal's exchanges.
It was the Chicago News that greeted its
readers on Tuesday morning with the remark
that "No one but a hide-bound partisan can
fail to je aroused to admiration of the man
who, in the hour of political defeat, can still
keep his rudder true and absolutely suppress
all personal feeling in his last official utter
tnces;" and now comes the Philadelphia
Times with the assertion that "President
Cleveland's last annual message to Congress
is a calm, dignified, straightforward document,
in which there is not a trace of the disap
pointment of defeat." With the presidential
sore thumb sticking up out of that message
with the prominence of the Washington mon
ument, such remarkable editorial comments
are hardly excusable even from the office
bey. He should give place to an abler man
in each case, even if it costs the respective
papers a dollar more a week.
OMITTED TOPICS.
. Mr. Cleveland's farewell message is not
more remarkable for what it says than for
what it does iot eay. Next to the tariff ques
tion the two domestic questions of greatest
inter est and importance are civil-servico re
form and the admission of the Territories.
The message does not contain a word about
either. Cleveland came in as a civil-service
reformer aud goes out a civil-service debaucher.
His first message dealt largely with the sub
ject o civil-service reform. He thundered
loudly in the index, but his apparently honest
zeal soon degenerated into false pretenses,
his messages as well as his acts showed a de
creasing interest in the subject, and his last
one makes no reference to it. ' The course of
his administration is strewn from beginning
to end with empty promises aud broken
pledges of civil-service reform, and his last
official message treats it with silent contempt.
Comparative diagrams are sometimes pub
lished to illustrate the rise and fall of prices
or the growth and decline of certain products.
A diagram of Cleveland as a civil-service re
former at the beginning and at the end of his
administration might be represented by .
The question of the admission of the Terri
tories is one of paramount interest and is
attracting a great deal of attention. Their
rapid growth and development, the anxiety
of their people for their admission and their
continued exclusion by the Democracy for
partisan purposes ha3 finally opened the eyes
of the country to the fact that a great polit
ical outrage has been perpetrated. At least
two of the Territories are more than ripe for
admission. Dakota has population enough to
entitle her to eight Representatives in Con
gress, and Washington to four. This would
give the former ten electoral votes end the lat
ter six. These two Territories contain, as many
white voters as half a dozen of the Southern
States that gave fraudulent majorities for
Cleveland. Their exclusion from the Union
is contrary to the genius of our institutions
and a violation of the fundamental principles
of republican government. It has already be
come a source of popular irritation, and would
soon reach the danger point. Yet Mr. Cleve
land does not refer to the subject in his mes
sage. Why did not this brave and fearless
man, this patriotic statesman, this greatest of
American Presidents, as the free-trade
claquers and courtiers call him, save a little of
his time and strength from belaboring the
American people to say a few words in favor
of the admission of those great and populous
Territories? He could not without virtually
condemning his party, and therefore he said
nothing. He could give pages to a howl
about the decadence of American society and
institutions, and the incapacity of the people
for self-government, but not a word to civil
service reform or the admission of the Terri
tories. f
THE FREE-TRADE PESSIMISTS
Scratch a free-trader and you will find a
pessimist a critic of American institutions
and a doubter of the success of popular gov
ernment. The logic of facts forces them into
this position. The American people refuse
to accept their free-trade doctrines, and stub
bornly insist on the opposite policy: there
fore, the American people are unfit for self
government and on the road to ruin. These
students of maxims and side-whiskered pro
fessors of reform point to great fortunes on
one hand and great poverty on the other as
proof positive of the weakness of popular
government and the evil of protection. It
does not occur to them that great wealth and
great poverty are inevitable results of large
populations and high commercial conditions
under any form of government. What would
a country be without great fortunes, and
what sort of a government would it be that
did not permit and encourage their acquisi
tion by honest enterpriseT Other coun
tries may have more than the United
States, but no other has as many that are
nobly used and beneficently bestowed. Poverty
is one of the necessary evils of human society.
The poor we have always with us. ' The world
has never1 been without them and never will
be. But Americans should thank God and
their free institutions, aye, and the protection
of home industry, that there is less of abject
poverty in this country than in any other,
that class distinctions are less marked, that
thousands of the poor are constantly growing
richer and thousands cf the rich growing
poorer, that wealth is more widely and evenly
distributed in this country than in any other,
that the middle class of moderately well-to-do
people vastly outnumbers the very rich and
the very poor combined, and that the condi
tions and elements of individual prosperity
and success exist here in a far higher de
gree than they do or ever did in any
other country. It will do for high
school boys in their society essays and
callow youths in their graduating orations to
lament the failing tendencies of popular gov
ernment, because it does not change human
nature nor cure evils which are inherent in
modern society under all governments, though
infinitely less prominent and aggravated here
than elsewhere. But mature men, who call
themselves Americans, ought to be ashamed
to promulgate such views, even to bolster up
their free-trade theories. Do they suppose
free trade would prevent the accumulation of
large fortunes, or put an end to poverty? We
can hardly think they are euch fools.
We do not care to be assured by a
German free-trade propagandist that our
social and economic systems are all wrong. If
General Herman Lieb thinks so there is no
law to prevent his return to the old country.
Neither do we accept Oliver Goldsmith's
threadbare line concerning the England of a
century and a half ago as applicable to the
America of to-day. We deny that this is a
land where "wealth accumulates and men de
cay." There is communism enough in the
land without adding to it by desseminating
that kind of sugar-coated poison, though
since Grover Cleveland has led off we shall
expect to see all the free-trade doctrinaires
follow his example.
A crowded and constantly increasing
urban population suggest the impoverish
ment of rural sections, and discontent with
agricultural pursuits. The farmer's son, not
satisfied with his father's simple and laborious
life, joins the eager chase for easily-acquired
wealth. Cleveland's Farewell Message.
Why did this great man leave Holland
Patent, Oneida county, New York, to go West
in search of employment? He should have
been content with the "simple and laborious
life" of a clerk in a country store instead of
joining "the eager chase for easily-acquired
wealth." And when he was employed to
assist in compiling the American Herd Book,
happy in the congenial companionship of fat
cattle and blooded beeves, why did he aspire
to positions which would only reveal to him
the vanity of human affairs and the incapasi-
ty of his unfortunate countrymen for self
government? It is sad to contemplate.
Appointments In the Civil Service.
' We have eeveral requests for information con
cerning the civil-service law and appointments
under it, which we reply to in a general way.
The law applies to what is called the classified
civil service, and this embraces the classified
departmental service, the classified customs
service, and the classified postal service. The
first iocludes clerkships in the departments at
Washington, the second includes positions In
custom-houses where there are more than fifty
employes, and the third positions in postofiices
where there are more than fifty employes. No
other offices are embraced in the law. The ex
amination for each branch of the service is dif
ferent, and a person must elect in advance
which branch he desires to enter. "Thus an ex
amination for the departmental service will not
entitle a person to appointment in"the customs
service, but an examination in the departmental
service is good for any of the departments at
Washington. The next examination for the de
partmental service will be held at tbe postofSce
building in the city, on Saturday, the 6th inst.,
beginning at 9 o'clock a. m. Information and
instructions relative to the examination, with
blank forms, etc., can be obtained y address
ing the secretary of the Civil-service Commis
sion at Washington. It is our impression that
a formal application for examination has to be
made and filed with the commission several
days in advance of the examination, and that it
is too late to do this for the examination of the
Sth inst All persons desiring full information
on the subject and blank forms of application
should address either the chairman or the sec
retary of the Civil-service Commission at
Washington.
A prominent Israelite in New York is quoted
as giving his opinion that the time is not far
distant when Hebrews will worship on the first
day of the week. He adds:
"There is no Jewish law forbidding such a
change, and business interests demand the
change as ranch as anything. Jewish merchants
can't close their places of business two days
each week, and if we open onr stores on Sunday
we are roundly censured by the Christians, and
many refuse to patronize us on that account.
The Jewish press is working to brine about the
change, and it is a reform greatly to be desired."

of Italian opera fame, were waiting for the train
tocether. One of the three proposed that they
bare drinks. When the liqnor was set out by
the barmaid Mr. Gladstone took half a erown

A farmer living near Brady's Bend, Pa, has
a golden egg-lsying goose cf which he is very
proud, in the shape of an oil well, the product
of which is refined by nature, so that the owner
el!s the wonderful productto consumers direct.
The residents of that vicinity buy this illurai-
nant and burn it in their lamps, without it hav
ing gone through any process, and it is said to
answer the purpose equally as well as the finest
illuminating kerosene. There is a natural-gas
well alongside of the oil well, which experts say
aids the rafining process. The proprietor does
a thriving business also in selling; sample of the
fluid, as nearly all strangers who visit that lo
cality to inspect the well buy small vials filled
with its product. The flow is very regular and
gives no indication of falling off.
There are some interesting references to lead
ing statesmen ia Principal Tulloch's account of
the marriage of the late Prince Leopold, vide
Mrs. Oliphant's memoir. "Mr. Gladstone looked
like a pale prophet Thsre was a funny con
trast between his uniform and his thoughtful
face." "Mr. Chamberlain, a dapper-looking, by
no means formidable-like Radical, with his class
stuck in his eye, and his uniform, seemed some
what out of place. I wonder if he was thinking
how grand it would be for the Radicals to sack
the whole concern? "John Morley is very
pleasant, and as little like an Atheist and Rad
ical as possible; rather like a dissenting min
ister.' "Lord.Iddesleigh very much changed.
That brat Lord R Charshill, has, I fear, been

Queen Victoria's private estates extend ever
37,372 acres, the annual rental, even at the
lately dspreciatad prices, being 20,733. This
does not include Claremont, which, in the year
1SCG, was granted to the Queen for life, with
the reversion to the country. Some years ago
her Majesty, acting under the advice of Lord
Sydney, purchased the property for the sum of
78,000, estimated at the time as being a little
over half its market value. It is said to be
worth to-day 150,000. Tha Queen also pos
sesses property at Cohurg, and the Princess
Hohenlohe left her the villa Hohenloho at
Baden, one of the best and most valuable resi
dences in the olace. As to personal property,
there was the bequest of a quarter of a million
left to her Majesty by Sir James Camden Neild.
This will was proved in 1852, and at the com
pound interest upon which it has been nurtured
the bequest must now have reached magnificent
proportion. Then there was the property left
by the Prince Consort, estimated to have
reached nearly 000,000, but as this will was
never proved, and so escaped probate duty, the
exact amount is not known. These items are
over and above the Queen's annual savings.

That the Sunday newspaper is an established

Richmond Palladium: The President's mes
sage is very much like himself, very common
place and soon to be forgotten.
Frankfort Banner: Cleveland's last message
to. the Congress of the United States is so
worded as to impress the intelligent people of
the country with tho thougnt that the present
occupant of the White House has become an
Anarchist.
New Albany Tribune: Tbe President's mes
sage is a lecture to Congress, a lecture in the
aense of scolding. He ecolds Congress for the
things it has done and for tbe things it has left
undone. The lecture takes in the country in
mass and he scolds it all, and makes even its
prosperity, growth and wealth a cause for
scolding it

are going tack, and that their lauds are declin
ing in value, may have answered for the cheap

Srecch llefore Ds Moines Tirrfcanoe Veterans.
Another figure in this contest, who for five
months left his own business and through sick
ness and health served the Republican party at
any cost to himself, was General Dudley. To
my own neighbors I wish also in tbe most con
spicuous manner, as an answer to the malice
with which General Dudley has long been pur
sued by the Democratie party, to tell you what
I know of the man. He worked with me iu the
campaign cf 1SS4, and it was his organization
that gave us Ohio in October. 1 have lived in
the same room with him day and night through
out this campaign, and have seen him under
every stress of beguiling coercion and political
temptation, and I want to say, measuring tbe
force and meaning of my words, that in my life I
have never known a man having that mingling
of strength and tenderness which makes the
noblest men, who was nobler in every grace of
manhood than General Dudley. Let me out his
life against Democratic purposes, and tho Dem
ocratic party's fear of him and his power of or
ganization more than any other man in the Re
publican party, as an answer to all and every
slander that may come. He left school a boy to
enter the Union army. He commanded his
regiment when he was eighteen at the battle of
Gettysburg, and was of those whose blood made
the saving scarlet line between the Confederacy
and the Capitol at Washington, which the rebel
army was never able to pass. Ilia leg was shot
from his body, and for forty hours he lay in the
weeds by the roadside, expecting every moment
that death was eommg, and yet meetinc it only
as a Union soldier could meet death. Since tbe
war he has been as honorable and noble in civil
life as in the blue uniform; generous, unselfish
ani true. He is a poor man to-day, and in this
last campaign spent half of the little that he
was worth for the success of the Republican
party. Against any malice of circumstance,
and against any conception of Democratic in
genuity, General Dudley stands aeenre in his
honor. Let me caution any Republican who
would take any Democratic falsehood in and
give it countenance, to remember how, wben he
was Commissioner of Pensions, the Democratie
party ordered an investigation to break him
down, and yet their own investigation showed
that every page of his record stood forth a fair
and open page of honor. I need not ask the
Republicans of Iowa to be just to such a soldier
and such a man.

General Porfirio Diaz, who was installed

years of age he shared in the revolution of 1851.
He took part in various battles during the sub
sequent years of civil war, and was promoted to
a full colonelcy for his services. In June, 1SG1,
be was elected a Deputy to the National
Congress. When Leonardo Marquez at
tempted , to capture the City of
Mexico, he successfully defended it
and afterwards fought the reactionists as an
officer under the command of Gen. Gonzales
Ortega and General Tapia. The invasion of his
native country by the French gave him the op
portunity of earning greater distinction with
his sword than he bad yet attained. He was
ma de diyision general for his valor in the siege
of Puebla. His attempt to hold Oaxaca against
a superior force of French troops was unsuc
cessful and resulted in his being made a prison
er, lie escaped and renewed the struggle. In
October, 18GG, he gained the battle of Car
bonera, where he took 500 Austrian prisoners.
He subsequently captured Puebla and defeated
Marqnez: and, in the same year, 1867, laid
siege to and took the city of Mexieo. Diaz
led in the revolutions of 1S72 and
1876, and became President of Mexico
the first and seoond times at these dates. Gen
eral Gonzales, late President of the Republic,
succeeded him in 1830, in consequence of a rev
olution in which Diaz was overtbrown. His
reinstatement as President, in 1831, gave gen
eral satisfaction, confirmed by the success of
his administration. His re-election demon
strates the public approval of his services.
Diaz is probably the ablest and most ad
vanced statesmen of Mexico. He is well known
iu tbe United States, with the institutions and
spirit of which he is in thorough sympathy. As
President he enjoys opportunities to push
schemes which will improve' the relations and
financial condition of both this country and our
southern neighbor. The purity of his character
and his patriotism are exemplary.
A TARIFF SMASHER.
Secretary Fairchild Nullifying: Decisions of
the United States Supreme 'Court.
New York Preps.
Collector Magone's official correspondence
from Washington yesterday included a formida
ble letter from the Secretary of the Treasury in
regard to the question of duty on hat . trim
mings. When the import of the letter became
known in mercantile circles thare was a great
deal ot adverse comment. Experts in revenue
and statutory laws expressed the opinion that
the Secretary's decision was a nullification of
the decision of the United States Supreme
Court given in October, 1887, iu the case of
Hartranft vs. Langfeld. That decision holds
that imports of ribbons which are chiefly used
in the manufacture of hats shall pay duty as
hat trimmings at tbe rate of twenty per cent
Secretary Fairchild says the imports shall be
classified as manufactures of silks and pay fifty
per cent. duty. His decisions is as follows:
The United States Supreme Court in the esse
of John F. Hartranft, Collector of Philadelphia.
'gainst A. W. Langfeld, decided that materials
commercially known as trimmings and which
are chielly adapted for use in making or orna
menting bats, bonnets and hoods,-are dutiable
at twenty per cent nd valorem. There are a
large number of suits of importers -pending
against the government for the recovery of
duties exacted in excess of the twenty per cent,
and the total amount involved is estimated at
between $700,000 and $800,00.
The Secretary of the Treasury, customs ex
perts say, in fixing the rate of duty on materials
used for hat trimmings at fifty per cent, vir
tually proclaims himself to be superior to the
United States Supreme Court, and in naming a
time for the duty to commence makes himself a
bigger power than Congress, which has said
that the provisions of the tariff shall date from
July 1, 1SS3. It is claimed that by bis course in
ignoring the Supreme Court decision he has
rendered himself liable to impeachment for non
feasance. A similar question to the present one Arose
under a previous tariff as to tbe duty on cut
hoops for baling cotton hoops, and like pressure
was bronght to bear on the powers at Washing
ton for a ruling similar to this one, but the Sec
retary of the Treasury at the time referred the
petitioners to Congress, which granted relief by
act of June 14, 15S0.
Cleveland as a I'rophet.
Memphis Avalanche (Deni.)
The voice of Cleveland is the voice of pro
phecy. His words are those of the patriot and
statesman, and his warning tbe American
people cannot afford to despise. It is impossible
to read his message without entertaining grave
forebodings tor the future of the Republic
unless the course he so clearly points out shall
be pursued. Undismayed by his overwhelming
defeat, ignoring the personal issue aod review
ing the field from the stand-point of the centen
nial of our constitutional existence as a Nation,
he encourages tbe Democratic host to stand
together, not that it may retreat in good order,
but that it may return to the charge and to
victory. If Cleveland's first declaration in favor
of tariff reform'furnished tbe enemies of Democ
racy with weapons cf attack, his second turns
them inward and renders their progress in the
path they are pursuing one of extreme danger
to themselves. They have made promises which
they cannot redeem. They have held out false
hopes to the American people and their delusion
cannot long continue. Cleveland has done his
country a service which marble and bronze in
shafts that pierce the aky can never repay.
Renovating the White Uuuse
Baltimore American.
The busy bands of the workmen have already
made the East Room and the Blue, Green and
Bed parlors look handsomely. The East Room
is fitted up splendidly, and the paint and gild
ing, and the brown 'plush furnituro, light-colored
carret and crystal chandelier give the his
toric room a very attractive appearance. The
outside part of the house has been painted
white, and now the rebuilding of tbe floor of
the center corridor of the second story is under
way. New beams will be laid alongside the old
ones to strengthen them. When the improve
ments are completed tbe floor will be able to
sustain the great strain that will b placed upon
it during the reception seasons. The total im
provements on th buildings 'and grounds will
net fall short of $23,000. The receptions, both
official and private, will not begin before Jan
nary next Visitors who have examined the
structure are surprised at its solidity. The doors
and windows are ss good to day as when the
were first put u Dot little improvement has
been msde in the woodwork in the interior since
the building was put up, and it looks now as if
none were needed for years to come.
JIarrUon'e llridges.
Nebraska State Journal.
In one of General Harrison's speeches in the
Senate he remarked that he "never crossed a
bridge till he came to it" Tho remark is not
original, but it is pretty generally conceded that
it is true of the coming" President, who has vol
unteered so far no bridge crossings in advance
of taking his executive chair. Now, Mr. Cleve
land crossed a numberof bridges before he came
to them previous to being sworn into ofJce, and
when he did come to them he stuck on tbe very
threshbold, and has been sticking there ever
since. The civil-service reform bridge was one
of them, and the silver-dollar bridge was
another, and the "no second term" bridge was
another. The last-mentioned bridge, however,
has lately been crossed, bet the wagon was
pushed from behind, and wo can hardly give
Grover the crsdit of its passage. General Har
rison is fortunate in the fact that he hasn't men
tioned a bridge of any sort in bis writings and
speeches since he was nominated.

James Whitcomb Riley, the Hoosier poet, is
becoming a familiar figure on Broadway. He

other evening perusing a newspaper. His well
built and robust form was enveloped in a large
overcoat, and his head was decorated with a

gave a picturesque appearance to the bard. Mr.
Riley does cot believe in long cavalier locks,
and deprecates any affectations of dress. His
hair is what is known as a brindle sorrel in

What the Wcnieu Are Coming To.
Boston Transcript.
If history repeats itself accurately, and all the
directory and empire fashions are to be adopted,
one after another, then will women have wigs of
many colors to wear at various times of day;
they will demand not only breast-knots and
wreaths of flowers, but flower garlands for tbe
hems of their skirts; and then tbe wigs will be
given up, and disheveled hair will be fashion
able, and every garment, from the outermost to
the innermost, will be embroidered, and the
costliest cashmere shawls will be desired, and
obtained if possible, and it will be necessary to
have many of them, adapted by their color to
various occasions. Dost like the picture, O
man who payest tbe bills?
Posing; for Democratic Applause.
Louisville Commercial.
It does not become Judge Gresham to ssek ic
put a stain upon General Harrison's title to tbs
presidency. These gentlemen were competitor!
for tbe vote of their own State, and General
Harrison was overwhelmingly chosen. They
were opponents at Chicago, and again General
Harrison triumphed. Had Judge lireshara been
the nominee it is not probable that tbe election
would have been any freer from charges of cor
ruption than it is to-day. His failure to reach
tho eminence to which, his ambition has long
turned may have something to do with tbe
Judge's excessive affectation of purity. Gresh
am will make more headway when be ceases to
pose for the applause t the Democratio party.
A Master of Vituperative Rhetoric
Chicago Journal.
Mr. Cleveland is the beet master of vitupera
tive rhetoric that ever occupied the Presidency.
His command of terms is limited, bet they are
strong. His invective is coarse; repetition it
frequent; there is an evidence of labor and lac'4
of skill in forming the sentences, but they come,
out like brickbats thrown by a mob at a street
car with a 'scab" driver. 4,Seltish greed
selfishness," "extortion," "personal interests
"grasping avarice," "inordinately burdened.
"sordid disregard" of others, "selfish advant
ages," "beneficiaries of unjust discrimination.
etc, etc. In the eloquence of a chronic scold,
the President has few equals and no superiors.
A Scandal from tbe Start.
Boston Trsnscript.
There is at least one striking instance of a
claim not justified by the facts in tbe assertion
of Mr. Vilas, Secretary of tbe Interior, that
there is an increase "in the efficiency, zeal and
honesty in the administration of the Indian
agents." If Mr. Vilas really thinks he is able to
see any such gain, his perceptions most be re
markably keen. Tbe present administration of
the Indian Bureau has been a scandal from the
beginning.
Reminder of a Story,
Washington Special.
Many laughable jokes in regard to the elec
tion were passed between Democrats and Re
publicans at tbe Capitol to-day. A Virginia
member amused Mr. Durham, of Illinois, Mr.
Boutelle and others by telling how tha elation
of his party before defeat and dejection after
wards reminded him of a story of a man who
was asked how he became so bow-legged. He
replied that he went up in a balloon and walked
back. '
The People Made No Mistake.
Buffalo Commercial.
The popular notion that Mr. Cleveland is a
"safe, conservative sort of man" is destroyed by
his extravagant statements and un-American
denunciation of the party which has just elected
a wiser and better man to succeed him. The
people will now be more firmly convinced than
ever that they made no mistake in sending Mr.
Cleveland back to private life.
