AYRES DID HAVE A PISTOL
Several of Ayers' Friends Testify
in the Bonine Case.
Washington, Dec. 3.-The case of
Mrs. Lola Ida Bonine, on trial for the
murder of James Seymour Ayres, Jr.,
Is expected to go to the jury the latter
part of this week. Three witnesses,
intimate friends of Ayres, were pnt in
the stand today and swore that they
had seen a revolver in Ayres' room.
The wrapper worn by Mrs. Bonine on
the night of the tragedy was again the
subject of discussion, the defense put?
ting on the stand witnesses whose evi?
dence was intended to discredit that
given by Dr. Shaffer, the government
expert, who liad testified that a careful
examination of the wrapper had failed
to show the presence of any bloodspots
thereon. .
Duncan B. Hubbard, of Mount
Clemens, Mich., who formerly lived at
the Kenmore, testified that he had
seen a pistol in a bureau drawer in
Ayres' room and identified the weapon
in evidence as being very similar to it.
Thomas Ford, of Sanilac county,
Mich., testified that while on a visit
here last January, Ayres had loaned
him a revolver. The witness described
the weapon and said that the one with
which the killing was done closely re?
sembled it, even to certain marks on
the handle. He also * testified that
when Ayres loaned him the pistol it
was loaded. J. P. Stevens also testified
to having seen a pistol in Ayres' room
and partially identified the one in
evidence.
A. E. Berklyn., scourer and dyer,
said it was his occupation to remove
blood spots from garments and that
he had frequently done so in ? man?
ner to leave no trace of the spots.
Witnesses also testified during the
morning session of the court to dances
frequently given in the hotel at which
Ayres aind Mrs. Bonine were present
and to the bloody finger marks on the
window curtain in Ayres' room.
F. C. Rutter testified that he had
particularly noticed Ayres and his
"companions about midnight of the
night of the"tragedy and it was his
impression that they were under the
influence of liquor.
Carl E. Flatter, a detective, testified
regarding the rents and tears in the
wrapper worn by Mrs. Bonine on the
night of the tragedy and Dr. Sterling
Ruffin detailed the various tests com?
monly employed for determining the
existence of blood spots. He said he
had given special study to bloodstains.
He had examined several specimens
from the wrapper in the presence of
Dr. Shaffer and Dr. Carroll, and had
found distinct evidences of blood on
the wrapper. The wrapper also was
torn. The witness was still on the
stand when court adjourned.
NO MOHEY^ORMERS.
lt Will Not be Possible to Pay the
Georgia Teachers a Full Month's
Salary Next Year.
Atlanta, Dec. 5.-The defeat of the
Blalock resolution which would have
made the money collected by taxation
to pay interest cn bonds available for
general purposes will, it appears, have
a far-reaching effect.
It means, Governor Candler says,
that none of the appropriations made
by the present session of the legislature
can be met, and that the Georgia
school teachers cannot be paid their
salaries next year.
The present deficiency is 874,000.
The deficiency next year as the resa.lt
of the neaw appropriations last ses?
sion, will be 8163,000. This will make
the total deficiency $237,000. The state
will owe the school teachers the mid?
dle'of this month $1,040,000. After
taking this from the amount collected
for schools, and also the deficiency,
there will be left only 8228,000 for
school purpose?, and tbat will not pay
the teachers for one month's services.
The indigent widows to whom the
present legislature promised pensions
at its last session, and whose applica?
tions have been approved to the j
amount of 878,000, cannot get them^i
nor will there be any money to pay,
the newly approved indigent veterans
pensions, amounting to $u2,?00.
The appropriation of $10,000 for the
maintenance of the soldiers' home next
year, it is stated, cannot be paid.
This does not include, however, the
insurance money, $19. which will
be used to rebuild the home. But un?
less the trustees can get money for j
maintenance the veterans will have to ;
be sent back to the poor houses j
whence many of them came.
There will be no money for the sup- j
port of the state militia. A bill has j
been introduced appropriating $30,000 i
for this put pose, but the chances are j
it will have to be vetoed.
There are nov/ in this country 2,158
daily papers and ^20,879 publications
of different kinds, but when B.
Franklin was thinking of starting a
paper in 1728 his friends advised him
to go slow because there were already
three papers in the country and he was
running a risk of overdoing the busi?
ness.-Star.
flOTTOII WENT OP FORTY POINTS.
Government's Report Caused a
Panic ; Advance of $2 a Bale.
New York, Dec. 3.-Trading on the
local cotton exchange today was con?
vulsed by the publication of the No?
vember government estimate of a short
cotton crop for the year. The figures
were 9,674,000 bales or nearly 2,000,000
bales less than the trade generally ex?
pected. Cotton jumped $2 a bale in
as many minutes, amid scenes of ex?
citement rarely seen. Brokers fought
with each other to cover short contracts
and the pit became a pandemonium for
.several minutes after the report was
received.
For three hours thereafter the
volume of business transacted was enor?
mous. After the first advance of
nearly forty points a slump developed
which carried prices nearly half way
back to the quotations prevailing be?
fore the figures erwe made known. Be?
fore the close, however, the loss was
regained and the prices were at their
highest. The market was exceedingly
feverish during the morning trading
and brokers were not inclined to enter
into any committments prior to the
publication of the government report.
The principal options were selling
about 7.60 cents a pound. Within three
minutes after the report was read the
tape recorded advances of 40 points in
all options. Everyone talked S cents
cotton and when the market closed
brokers were wondering what influence
the report would have on the Liver?
pool market for it is generally under?
stood that Liverpool estimates were
exceedingly bearish. The houses with
wire connections in the south did an
immense ? amount of business, mainly
profit taking.
Washington, Dec. 3.-The statistics
of the department of agriculture re?
ports 9,674,000 bales as the probable
cotton production of the United States
in 1901-02. The area picked or to be
picked is estima-sed ?t 26,802,239 acres,
a reduction of 730,216 acres or 2.6 per
cent, from the acreage planted.
The total production of lint cotton
is estimated at 4,529, $54,000 pounds,
an average cf 169 pounds per acre
picked or to be picked.
The estimate production by states,
in pounds of lint cotton per acre, is
as follows:
Virginia, 176; North Carolina, 142;
South Carolina, 141; Georgia, 167;
Florida, 177: Alabama, 156; Missis?
sippi, 205 ; Louisiana, 260 ; Texas, 159 :
Arkansas, 173; Tennessee, 136; Mis?
souri, 196: Oklahoma, 196: Indian
Territory, 214.
In addition to the department's
ordinary crop ' reporting agencies,
15,000 ginners and 5,000 bankers and
merchants have furnished valuable in?
formation concerning acreage and pro?
duction. The ginners have also report?
ed the amount of cotton ginned be?
tween August 15 and November 20
this year and last year, with the aver?
age gross weight per bale and the aver?
age weight of bagging and ties.
This has enabled the statistician to
ascertain the average net weight of
bales for each separate State and for
th? entire cotton belt, and these
weights have been used in determin?
ing the total number of bales produc?
ed , which is believed to be the lowest
average in at least ten years. The
large number of light bales being
marketed and also some reduction in
the proportion of light seed cotton are
subjects of frequent comment by cor?
respondents of all classes.
SHOCKING MARINE DISASTER.
British Ship With Whole Crew on
Board Sinks on Oregon Coast.
Astoria, Oregon, Dec. 4.-The tug
Tatoosb, which has just returned to
port reports that the British ship
Nelson, Capt. Perriami, turned turtle
last night and went to the bottom with
her entire crew. The Nelson left
Astoria November 25. Monday night
she was back at the river's mouth and
yesterday was reported to have shifted
her cargo. She had a bad list to star?
board and could go on only one tack.
Yesterday afternoon the tug Tatoosh
wens out and picked up - the Nelson,
passing a hawser. The tug started off
shore with the ship, owing to the gale.
It was the intention of Capt. Bailey
of the Tatoosh to remain with the
ship during the night. The gale that
raged last night was too severe for the
vessel to withstand and she broke
from the tug and then turned turtle,
sinking at once. In the darkness it
was impossible for the tug to render
assistance to the members of the crew
who were carried down and all perished.
The Nelson carried a crow of 28 men
all told. She was an old woolen vessel.
Capt. Geo. Wood, the bar pilot, was
to have been placed aboard thc ship
last night but the weather was too
rough to permit it. Capt. Wood states
that the Nelson went over between li
and 12 o'clock last night during the
height of the gale. The Nelson car?
ried a cargo of lumber and was con?
signed to Capetown, South Africa,
by Taylor, Young & Co., of this city.

THE MESSAGE GIVEN ATTENTION.
Nsw President Judged by His
Declaration of Policy.
Washington, Dec. 3.-Not in many
years h?ve the members of the # honse
listened with such rapt attention to
the annual message of a president of
the United States as they did today
to the reading of the first message of
President Roosevelt. With the most
intense interest every word was follow?
ed from the* announcement of the
tragic death of President McKinley,
in the opening sentence to the closing
wish that our relations with the world
would continue peaceful. The reading
occupied two hours but not over a
dozen members left their seats until
it was concluded. Several times there
was applause and at the conclusion
there was an enthusiastic demonstra?
tion on the Republican side. On
motion of Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio, that
portion of the message relating to the
death of the late president was re?
ferred to a committee to consist of one
member from each State to join a
simiair committee of the Senate to
consider and report by what token of
respect and affection it may be proper
for congress to express the deep sensi?
bility of the nation to the traigc death
of the late president.
Representative Grosvenor's resolu?
tion follows:
"Resolved, That a committee of one
member from each State represented
in this honse be appointed on the
part of the house, to join such a com
mitte as may be appointed on the part
of the senate, to consider and report
by what token of respect and affection
it may be proper for the congress of
the United States to express the deep
sensibiiity of the nation to the tragic
death of the late president, William
McKinley, and that so much of the
message of the president as relates to
that deplorable event be referred to
such committee."
The speaker appointed the com?
mittee in pursuance of the terms of
the resolution.
The speaker announced the appoint?
ment of the committee on ruis as fol?
lows :
Mr. Henderson, of Iowa ; Mr. Dal?
zell, of Pennsylvania; Mr. Grosvener
of Ohio; Mr. Richardson, of Tennes?
see, and Mr. Underwood, of Alabama.
The house adjourned until Friday.
The senate listened to the first mes?
sage of President Roosevelt today and
adopted a resolution similar- to that
of the house prvoviding for the ap?
pointment of a committee to express
the nation's sorrow at the death of
President McKinley. The message
was listened to with marked respect
by the senators. The ffrst portion,
deailngwith the Buffalo tragedy, excit?
ed the most profound interest in the
senate.
At the conclusion of the reading of
the message Mr. Foraker, senior sena?
tor from Ohio, presented the McKinley
resolution and as a further markk of
respect the senate adjourned.
SYNOPSIS OF THE*MESSAGE.
Reviews Condition of Country
Tribute to President McKinley.
Washintgon, Dec. 3.-President
Roosevelt began his first message to
congress with an appropriate tribute
to the late President McKinley.
He dwells upon the evils of an?
archy in our country, and speaks of
the precautions that can be taken to
keep the anarchists in check and the
measures that can be taken to stamp
it out.
The prosperity of the country, com?
mercially and otherwise is touched
upon, and he handles at some length
the question of the benefits derived
from corporations, and the great indus?
trial and social problems before the
public today.
He recommends the re-enactment
of the Chinese Exclusion law.
As to the tariff question, President
holds to the doctrine of his party,
that of the maintenance of the protect?
ive tariff..
He recommends some remedial ac?
tion in regard to our merchant
marine. .
Xext the message treats of the cur?
rency and banking questions and of
inter-state commerce. He speaks of
our policy toward our insular posses?
sions and deals at some length with
the Philippine problem and discusses
the policy to to followed in the future.
The President states that the Monroe
Doctrine should bo the cardinal fea?
ture of the foreign policy of all na?
tions.
He touches upon the need of a Pacific
cable via Hawaii and the Philippines.
The navy comes in for a share of
comment.
He favors the completion of the
Isthmian canal. Thc army he says is
in need of an icren.se in strength
and efficiency.
He discusses the militia, civil ser?
vice and the Indian policy.
The St. Louis and Charleston Ex
ositions are spoken of very favorably,
and he recommends an appropriation
for the Charleston shew.
Thc message concludes with a re?
view of the situation in China and
the Pan-American Congress. Taken
as a whole the message, while lengthy,
is a well written and interesting docu?
ment.
Admiral Endicott's Enormous Es?
timates for Our Expanding Nayy
Washington, Dec. 5. The rapid
growth of the navy is the plea set up
by Rear Admiral Endicott, chief of
the bureau of yards and docks, to
justify the submission of estimates for
the maintenance of the navy yards and
stations and improvements aggregat?
ing $21,526,359. He admits that these
estimates are much beyond the limit
supposed probable when the current
appropriations were made, but states
that all the works named are consider?
ed necessary.
CANAL COMMISSION
FAVORS NICARAGUA ROUTE.
Cost of Building Estimated at
$190,000,000-Will Take Eight
Years to Complete Ditch.
Washington, Dec. 4.-The report of
the Isthmian Canal commission was
sent to congress today, the commis?
sion, as anticipated several weeks ago,
favors the Nicaragua route and makes
an estimate of 8189,864,062 as the total
cost of construction of the canal
through Nicaragua. The estimated
cost of the Panama route is $114,233,
358. but the report says it would cost
$109,141,000 to obtain the Panama
concession. The commission value
the work done at $40,000,000. The
report says the Panama route is feas?
ible as a sea level canal while the
Nicaragua route must be by locks, but
Lake Nicaragua will furnish an inex?
haustible supply of water for the
canal. The Nicaragua route has no
natural harbors at either end, but
satisfactory harbors may be construct?
ed. Harbors already exist at each
end of the Panama route, but consid?
erable work must be done at the en?
trance of the harbor on the Atlantic
side. With adequate force and plant
the commission estimate that the
Nicaragua canal can be completed in
six years exclusive of two years for
prepasation. Ten years is estimated
to complete the Panama canal. The
total length of the Nicaragua route is
183.66 miles and the Panama route
49.09 mi les. The estimated cost of
operating and maintaining the Nicara?
gua cans.l annually is $1,350,000 great?
er than that of the Panama canal.
The estimated time for a deep draught
vessel to pass through the Panama
canal is 12 hours and through Nicara?
gua canal 33 hours.
The Nicaragua route, the report
says, is more advantageous for com?
merce, save that originating on the
west coast of South America. For
the gulf ports in the Atlantic and
Pacific, one day. The Nicaragua
route is said to be better for sailing
vessels, on account of favoring winds.
Hygenic conditions also favor Nicara?
gua. The commission says the United
States should acquire control of a
strip of territory ten miles wide from
sea to sea to build the canal. The con?
sent of Nicaragua and Costa Rica
must be obtained to construct the
canal, but the report says this canal
easily be secured. The concessions
granted by the Colombian government
to the Panama Canal company have
many years to run and new conces?
sions can not be granted to the Uni?
ted* "States. The report concludes as
follows :
"After considering all the facts
developed by the investigations made
by the commission, the actual situa?
tion as it now stands, and having in
view the terms offered by toe
New Panama Canal company this
commission is of the opinion that the
most practicable and feasible route for
an isthmian canal to be under control,
management and ownership of the Uni?
ted States-is that known as the
Nicaragua route."
Geo. S. Morison, a member of the
commission, submits a report favoring
the Panama route. He says the esti?
mates for the Nicaragua canal do not
make sufficient provisions for un?
known conditions and contingencies.
No consideration, he says, has been
given to accidental interruption of
traffic by Nicaragua, which he thinks
would not be so likely to occur at
Panama. He believes that better con?
ditions and terms can be arranged
through the acquisition of the Pan?
ama Canal company's rights than by
any negotiations with Nicaragua and
Costa Rica. The government, after
securing the rights, he says, could ne?
gotiate direct with Colombia for the
right to construct the canal. He clos?
ed by saying :
"The Panama route has advantages
over the Nicaragua route in cost of
construction, in cost of operation and
in convenience when done, while its
use is less likely to lead to local in?
ternational complications. If the
United States government is to build
an isthmian canal the Panama route is
the best."
TWO CANAL BILLS INTRODUCED.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 4.-Two
bills looking to the construction of an
isthmian canal via the Nicaragua route
were today introduced in the senate.
The first of these was presented by
Senator Morgan and provides that the
president be authorized to acquire
from and to conclude agreement with
the States of Costa Rica and Nicaragua
or*either of them for and in behalf of
the United States territory now be?
longing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua
as may be described and necessary on
which to excavate, construct, govern,
regulate, police and protect a canal of !
such depth and capacity as will fi?.'
sufficient for the movements of ships
of the greatest tonnage and draft now
in use, from a point near Greytown on
the Carribean sea, via Lake Nicaragua
io i?reto on the Pacific ocean.
The other bill was introduced by
Senator Perkins. This provides for a
perpetual lease by the United States of
the right of way across Nicaragua and
Costa Rica, and confers military police
and sanitary police control of the canal
routte by' the United States, it
makes an appropriation of $120,000,
oco. of which sum $12,000,000 is io be
expended annually. A non j anisan
commission is to bc appointed by the
president to have charge of the con?
struction of the canal, the members >>f
the commission to be selected from
different parts of the United Slates,
and to be paid $10,000 salary each per
year. The appointment of engineers
is also authorized, lt is further pro?
vided that the canal shall he of the
dimensions recommended by the
Isthmian Canal commisison. The bill
authorizes the president of the Uni?
ted States to make minor changes in
the route adopted for the canal and
the methods of its construction.
FEDERATED LABOR IN CONVENTION.
Many important Measures-The
Color Line Will Come Up.
Scranton, Pa. Dec. 4.-Tonight the
hotel corridors especially that of the
Jermin where the headquarters is
located, are crowded with delegates
from all over the United States and
Canada campaigning for and against
the various measures that are scheduled
to come up in the big convention of
the American Federation of labor,
which will open here tomorrow.
Delegates from the shipbuilding
trades are making a vigorous cam?
paign for a demand from the federa?
tion that the government builds its
own ships and not let the contracts to
private parties, who pay less wages
and exact more labor than does the
government.
Almost every delegate is taking an
active interest in the trades autonomy
matter and_ of all the subjects billed
for discussion it promises to provoke
the most talking. The color line will
also be discussed. It will be
brought before the convention in the
shape of a protest against the seating
of Wm. E. Seqle, delegate of the Cen?
tral labor council of Richmond, Va.
The American Federation of labor
specifically provides in its constitu?
tion that the color line is not to be
drawn by an organization holding a
federation character. The Richmond
trades and labor council has a clause
in its constitution specifying that the
delegate of the council must be a
"male or female white over 21 vears
old."
In Richmond are two lodges of the
tobacco workers composed exclusvely
of negroes, who being barred from
representation in the Richmond coun?
cil, federate directly with the Vir?
ginia State union and thus attain
membership in the American Federa?
tion of labor. They are also members
of the Tobacco Workers' International
union. Through the latter organiza?
tion they projected a fight to have the
federation take away the charter of
the Richmond council, and as a result
of their efforts the Tobacco Workers
union has directed its president, Henry
Fischer of Louisville, to protest
against the seating of the Richmond
trades and labor council delegates.
ANARCHY DISGUSSED IN SENATE.
Senator McComas Made a WelJ
Prepared Speech.
Washington, Dec. 5.-The senate
today entered upon the field of debate.
The suppression of anarchy was the.
theme on which Senator McComas .of.
Maryland made an extended and care?
fully prepared speech, followed by
some brief remarks by Mr. Hoar of.
Massachusetts, on the difficulties in
the way of dealing with anarchist;
assassins. Mr. McComas' service on
the bench gave special interest and
value to the careful examination
which he had made of the legal au?
thorities. He maintained that con?
gress had full power under the con?
stitution to enact a federal law punish-,
ing with death any person killing -a
president, or assaultng the president
with intent to kill, or aiding, inciting
or procuring such an act. He favored
rigid provisions in the immigration
laws for the deportation of alien an?
archists. Much of the speech was de?
voted to an explanation of the danger?
ous doctrines of anarchy and the ex?
tent to which these doctrines had been
propogated within recent years. , "
Senator's Hoar remarks were inter?
esting as coming from the venerable
chairman of the judiciary committee,
who will have much to do with the
framing of any legislation on this sub?
ject. He said" the difficulty was that
assassins of kings and rulers always
gloried in their crimes and were in.no
way deterred by the fear of punish?
ment. For this reason he thought it
was almost useless to multiply punish?
ments. The most effective remedy,
he suggested, would be to have the
civilized nations of the world agree
upon some desolate spot on the earth's
surface to which all anarchists who
uphold assassination or the overthrow
of governments shoould be transport?
ed. In such a community the anar- ;
cbist could carry out his theory .of j
living without a government and thc j
world thus be rid of this presence. '

State to Build Atlanta Depot.
Atlanta, Ga., Dec. 5.-The bill to
erect a union railroad station on the
State on Georgia property in Atlanta
passed the house of representatives this
afternoon by a vote of 107 to 55. The
bill .provides for a commission of nine,
to be headed by the governor of Geor?
gia and consisting of four members
each from the house and senate, to be
chosen by the speaker of thees bodies.
This commission will receive bids and
"inspect plans for the erection of the
depot and advertise the project in the

and Baltimore. One half [million dol?
lars of the State's money is made
available for the project on January 1,
.1903, but the commission is empower?
ed to proceed with the work as soon as
the bill shall have passed the senate,
which is expected by next Tuesday.
A Lawless Grand Jury.
New Orleans, Dec. 5.-Judge James
M. Thompson, in opening the district
court in Washington parish, the scene
of the recent burning of a negro at
the stake, followed by a riot in Ball
town, where several lives were lost
called the attention of the grand jury
to these occurrences and urged it to
take action to maintain the good name
of the community, which had been
much injured. The grand jury, how?
ever, reported that "themen who par?
ticipated in the burning were among
the best ciitzens of the county and
nothing but a desire to protect those
who are nearest and dearest to them
would move them to undertake such

killed and two others were seriously
if not mortally wounded. The dead
man is Wm. P. Taylor, Jr., and the
wounded are J. Q. Stiff and Willie
