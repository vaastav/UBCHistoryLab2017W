DETECTIVES OX THE ALERT.
llolltlny Runli Snverstii the Adoption
of Precuntlonnry Menxnrm.
Holiday shoppers are making an early
start this season in order to avoid a rush
later on, and the dealers are keeping open
their stores later than usual in the even
ings to accommodate them. With ?e in
creased number of shoppers comes the sug
gestion to the minds of the police that per
haps shoplifters may be looking for an op
portunity to operate. In view of this prob
ability. Inspector Mattingiy has instructed
his detectives to pay special attention to
the crowded stores and keep them clear of
people known to be dishonest.
It is not only the shoplifters who give
trouble at this season of the year, but also
the pickpockets. Thus far. however, the
police say, there has been very little steal
ing done. There has not been one case of
pocket picking reported. There is said to
be a considerable amount of petty stealing
in the stores about which complaint is not
made, and in many instances the loss of
the articles is not even known. Private
detectives and door walkers in some busi
ness establishments do police duty, ana fre
quently thefts are detected, but the persons
committing them are not arrested. They
are simply warned and ordered out of the
store.
Several cases are reported of the theft of
goods from a display of articles on the
sidewalks, and last week Detectives ILuller
and Iiaur made five arrests for offenses of
this character.
The detectives are devoting much of meir
time to the stores, and it is likely that
some persons now under suspicion will be
arrested before Christmas.
CIVIL. SERVICE REFORM.
Mrt'linK of the Executive Committee
of Local AsHoelntlon.
An important meeting of the executive
committee of the local Civil Service Reform
Association was held yesterday afternoon
at the office of the secretary. Those pres
ent were Messrs. John Joy Edson, Dr.
Mackay-Smlth, Charles Lyman, H. B. F.
Macfarland, A. L. Sturtevant, George Will
iam Hill, Charles W. Stetson, Adolph Wolf,
H. H. Glassie and the secretary, F. L. Sid
dons. Mr. S. W. Woodward was elect
ed to membership in the association. Mr.
John Joy Edson was elected as the repre
sentative of the local association on the
general committee of the National Civil
Service Reform League. V'pon motion, the
president appointed as delegates to the an
nual meeting of the league the memljers of
the executive committee, consisting of the
above named gentlemen and Mr. Theodore
W. Noyes. A committee of three was also
appointed to arrange for the annual meet
ing of the local association, which, it was
decided, should be held upon the reassem
bling of Congress after the holidays. A
new membership committee was appointed.
Plans to meet the expected attacks upon
the civil service law and regulations were
discussed, and it was the opinion of those
present that while attempts to repeal or
modify the law would be made in Con
gress during this session, there was no rea
son to apprehend that they would succeed;
but It was determined to be prepared for
any emergency, and to resist the annually
recurring efforts to destroy the merit sys
tem.
The meeting of the league at Cincinnati
promises to be the largest ever held.
Throughout the country the friends of the
reform are arousing themselves on Its be
half, and the league meeting will be at
tended by representatives from not only
the civil service reform associations of the
country, but from civic organizations of all
kinds, including beards of trade and other
commercial bodies. The board of trade of
this city has elected delegates who will at
tend, and a considerable delegation from
the Civil Service Reform Association will
also be at the meeting. It is believed be
fore the session of Corgress is over evi
derces of an opposition to any interference
with the law of a pronounced character will
be communicated to the legislative and ex
ecutive authorities.
The membership committee of the local
association is planning to increase the num
btrs cf those enlisted in the organization
from those in sympathy with the principles
It advocates, and is desirous of receiving
applications for membership from all such
persons.

SPANISH SUBTLETY
Senor Quesada Dissects the Plan for
Cuban Autonomy.
TEE DECEITS IK SAGASTA'S DECBEE
The Proposed Reforms Will Never
Be Accepted by Cubans.
SPAIN'S LAST CARD PLAYED
Senior Gonzalo de Quesada, charge d'af
faires of the Cuban republic, was visited
a reporter for The Star this morning in his
apartments at the Raleigh and asked for
his views upon the effect of the plan
for autonomy in Cuba recently promulgat
ed by Premier Sagasta. Senor Quesada
?was much disinclined to talk, but, after
persuasion, consented, realizing that the
matter was of great importance to repre
sc-ntatives and senators, who might
brought to the consideration of the Cuban
question at any time.
"We have at last received the official
text of the so-called home-rule reform
which Spain has announced she has ex
tended to Cuba," said Senor Gonzalo de
Quesada. "It came in the mall last night
and occupies the whole issue of the Im
parcial of November 27. Its perusal show
that all claims made regarding it by the
Cubans are borne out. It is a mere trick
to delay the Inevitable action of the Unite
States in recognizing the Independence
Cuba, and to dupe, if possible, the Cubans
now In arms.
"The very preamble addressed to the
queen gives away the Spanish case," con
tlnued Quesada. "fcr Sagasta in it, speaking
about the powers that will remain to the
bpanish government, says that nothing
iiich Is essential to the sovereignty ha
been forgotten. 'In nothing is the centr
authority (Spain) diminished or lessened
In this same preamble Sagasta speaks about
the right of Cuba to make its tariff, which
has caused such a protest in Spain and
so sure is he that the Cuban chambers
made up of men favorable to Spanish in
terests will arrange this tariff in conform!
ty witn Spanish desires that he says: 'If the
Insular government was already constituted
and we could arrange a system of com
mercial relations with it there would be no
l!?^. ^'ve "1's question proportions
which it has not, or to announce ruin or
misfortune. The Spanish government to
calm the alarms has anticipated events
and instead of leaving the determination of
this question to the natural workings of the
new constitution has fixed from now the
oasis of the future mercantile relations be
tv? een Spain and Cuba.'
"Further on," said Senor Quesada. "in
article 40 of the laws of the reform, the
differential duty in favor of Spanish prod
ucts Is put at the modest figure of yr> per
cent. Another point touched in Sagasta'
preamble is the most important one of the
debt, and here we are told that it will b<
clstributed with equity when 'the termina
tlon of the war will allow its final total to
be determined."
Pull ?' SalKcrfugc and Deceit.
As we shall see further on In discussing
more fully the decree of the alleged reform
It Is filled with subterfuges and deceits
In order to put these decrees into opera
tion a law extending the universal suffrage
of Spain to Cuba has been promulgated
At first sight, this would seem to be :
great concession, but when we conside
that in Spain itself the government In pow
er always obtains control of the elections
determining beforehand the number and
the names of the deputies who shall be re
turned to the cortes, the emptiness of the
effer can be readily seen. In order that I
will not seem to be partial in this opinion '
he continued, "I will quote the words of the
Sp&r.lard. Pi Margall, who says, in regard
to this and to the law of public order
which can be promulgated according to the
decree whenever the governor general of
Cuba sees fit: 'We (the Spaniards) here an;
there take advantage of and defeat the
intention of even the best laws. The Cu
bans cannot fall to fear that the general
government of Spain will not only use to
Its own advantage the law of public order
but that it will thwart the will of the Cu
ban as the ministers constantly do in Spain
notwithstanding the many precautions
taken to prevent It. The want of confi
dence that Spanish colonies have in Spain
will not be the least obstacle to the success
of the effort to get the Cuban rebels to
give up their arms.'
Tlie Culinn l'n rlfument.
Continuing his discussion of the decree
Senor Quesada said:
Coming to the section which provides
for the composition of the upper Cuban
chamber, called the council of administra
tion, It declares that eighteen members
shall be elected and seventeen members ap
pointee! by the governor general In the
name of the king. Any impartial observer
can see that this upper chamber will be
always controlled by Spain", and. If we fur
ther consider the requisites for membership,
no doubt can remain as to this. It Is neces
sary to have an annual income of $4,<kx)
for a men to be either elected or selected
to the the council of administration,
and from this It can be seen that
wealth and not wisdom or ability is
the prime requisite for such preferment.
This Income requirement would keep out
the great majority of representative Cubans
of the professional classes, such as lawyers,
physicians, journalists and the other brainy
men who are usually selected for such po
sitions, and would open the doors to many
Spaniards, who have gained ill-gotten for
tunes by reason of the Cuban war. Amer
icans can judge from this If the decree does
not seek legislation In favor of the privi
leged few, who will i-trive to maintain their
monopoly of Cuban affairs at all hazards.
"Article 7 of the decree." he continued,
"goes on to enumerate the different posi
tions which the councillors to be appointed
by the governor general must have occu
pied In order to make them eligible. This
again reduces the number of possible Cu
bans to such an extent that It can be safe
ly asserted that, even If the crown wanted
to be liberal v.'lth the Cubans, not one-third
of the council could be nominated from
among them. Four years of residence in
Cuba Is the only requisite fcr the appoint
ment of a councillor, and this. It can be
seen, will not work to the detriment of
Spanish appointments.
Condition* May Be Changed.
"Article 0 shows in a more emphatic way
the subtlety of the Spanish Intention to ap
pear sincere when it provides that tue con
ditions necessary for the appointment of
councillors may be changed 'by a law of
the kingdom on the petitioi or request of
the Insular chambers;" as if it would be so
easy for the Insular chambers to agree to
deprive themselves of the sinecures they
enjoy. Further, there is nothing In the
whole decree to tell us whether, in case the
chambers do petition for such changes or
fcr anything else, and Spain does not ac
cede to the lequest. what way will be left
to force such desired changes or requests.
Spain's Subtle Intentions.
"It Is provided that members of the Cu
ban house of representatives?a good name,
by the way, for American consumption
shall be elected for five years. This con
clusively shows that Spain Intends that for
at least the first five years It will have a
Cuban legislature thoroughly under its con
trol anij ready to do its bidding in all di
rections, for there is no possible chance for
the Cubans to secure even a respectable
minority under the existing conditions.
The Parliament Powerless.
"But admitting for sake of argument that
the Cubans would have all the members of
the proposed legislature, let us see what
they could do," continued Senor Quesada.
"It is the King of Spain who can con
voke, stsper.d or 'lose its sessions, and
can adjourn or dissolve separately or
simultaneously either or both houses. It is
true that the law provides that they must
be convoked within three months, but there
is nothing to prevent their immediate dis
solution again or to prevent the use of the
government machinery to elect new houses
in harmony with Spanish aims or de
sires Whenever they may be needed. Fur
ther, the governor general, Spain's crea
ture, of course. Is empowered to Initiate and
tmpoa? colonial laws. A majority In the
chambers constitutes a quorum, and any
law passed by a plurality of votes is legal;
so that. XI the Cubajan fWMld withdraw on
any contingency, the' anrolnted Spaniards
could always legislate as they pleased. The
Inviolability of the representatives is not
extended to any one who will be an author
of articles, books or pamphlets which will
invoke or invite military sedition, attack
the governor general or national sover
eignty. From this weleeeKihat Cuba is
condemned forever to be an autonomous
colony and we will be worse off than be
fore. According to the decisions of the
supreme court of Spain, not against
the law to advocate separatist ideas as
leng as force was not used, but this decree
prevents any possible attempt on the part
of Cubans in the future Jo obtain indepen
dence by evolution. That iX why the Cu
bans are determined to gain it by revolu
tion. ) _
"The law further provides that the Cuban
chambers can only address themselves to
the crown through the governor general,
ar.d in all cases where the latter considers
national Interests injured or prejudiced by
the action of the chambers, he can refer
the case to Spain and postpone any further
discussion of it until the Spanish govern
ment shall decide upon it. The chambers
can only legislate by sufferance of Spain
and then only on matters of no vital im
portance and which do not involve large
appropriations of money or affairs of state,
war, navy, the Cuban debt, police, the ad
ministration of Justice or the church.
The President Misled.
"It is not true, as President McKinley
has been made to believe, according to his
statement in his message, that the cham
bers have 'unlimited power," except as to
these following matters, which are found in
title 0 of the decree. It Is herein provided,
not that it can 'organize courts of Justice
with native judges from members of the
local bar," as the President says, but article
34 says that It can 'propose measures to the
central government,' which Is very differ
ent lrom organizing. Further on the gov
ernor general is given the power to name
all the functionaries of the courts which
the minister of the.colorles does today. It
Is only a change from a Spanish tweedle
dum to a Spanish tweedledee. Neither Is
It true, as President McKinley says, that
?without limitations of any kind, it (the
Cuban parliament) can irame the budget
as to expenditures and revenues," for the
national cortes of Spain will be the author
ity which will determine the amount which
Cuba will pay, leaving Cuba to look lor the
means of payment. Moreover, neither of
the two chambers can pass upon the local
budget without having voted finally upon
the Cuban share of the expenses of the
Spanish sovereignty. In article 3(> is limi
tation enough, as it says: 'To the Spanish
ccrtes belongs the determination of what
shall be considered by their nature neces
sary expenses of the sovereignty and the
Spanish cortes will determine every three
years its amount and the necessary assets
"to cover it, always reserving to itself to
aller this provision.'
"There is an attempt to hoodwink the
Cubans 011 the question of commercial
treaties bv providing that the central gov
ernment will be aided by special delegates
authorized by the colonial government to
draft Pitch treaties with other Countries. ?
but these treaties must always be referred
to the Spanish cortes for final approval,
and in every case Spanish products must |
have the advantage of a differential dut\.
It will be readily seen how little chance ?
Cubans will have to open their markets
to the United States, wh eh is the natural |
outlet for Cuban products.
The Governor General's Power.
"The whole gist of Spain's intentions re- I
garding Cuba can be seen in the authority
which still remains in the governor gen
eral," said Senor Quesada, "and embraces I
the suliordination of all the authorities of
the Island; give him the right to suspend
all guarantees; to apply thfl law of public
order, which is only another name for
martial law: and the exercise of the veto,
for it is he who must sanction and publish |
all the decrees of the insular parliament;
and, as the governor general will always be
.1 Spaniard, it can be well seen how much
Spain means by her boasted reform.
Will Never He Accepted.
"Nothing has been said yet In regard to j
the ar.Tiy which Spain Is to keep in Cuba,
or of the disarming of the Spanish volun- I
teers, or the creation of na,tWe militia, as |
in other autonomous colonies.
"It Is Idle to di?quq?, these reforms which I
are still born. Not ,op?ie Cuban leader has
accepted them, and pTione will," declared
Quesada. "The cables from,.Cuba confirm I
our assertion that only with independence
can peace be obtained in the island, all the
hopes of the Spanish to the contrary not
withstanding. The papers yesterday
morning contain a dispatch from Havana,
saying: 'The business concerns of the city
are much discouraged by the actual situa
tion. They do not now look forward to a
speedy end of the revolution. All say that
they have abandoned the hope 'hit the |
insurgents will surrender or accept the con
ditions of autonomy."
"The 'near future' of which President
McKinley speaks In his message is already
at hand," said Senor Quesada in conclu
sion, "and Spain, with Carlist agitation
at home, the threats of Gen. Weyler. her
treasury ar.d her credit both exhausted,
witli nothing but a sk< leton of an army in I
Cuba, having played her last card, must
soon give tc the Cubcins that for v* nich |
they have so gallantly fought for the last
three years, unaided and alone, and for
which they have deservedly conquered,
their absolute independence."

sion are arriving in the city and expect |
to have a conference with the Secretary
of the Interior In the Immediate future.
Gen. Armstrong was among the arrivals j
yesterday. In an interview he expressed
the opinion that the time had come for |
Congress, after ascertaining the exact con
dition of affairs, to take the management
of affairs in the Indian territory into its |
own hand3 and legislate accordingly.
Dmtractlon of Dlxense UerniN.
From the New York "tribune.
A Russian bacteriologist, who has made
a speclaity of studying the influence of cof
fee in destroying disease germs, Is reported
as having come to the conclusion that,
though coffee Is to some degree a disinfect
ant, the property In question really depends j
not upon the active principle of coffee, or
caffein, which it contains, but upon the
substances developed In the roasting ot' the I
berry. It was found that the various sub
stitutes for coffee are also germicides, and,
like it, develop disinfectant properties dur
ing the roasting process. Thus, a watery
infusion of either coffee or its substitutes
was found to be capable of killing the
germs of cholera within-a few hours, and or
typhoid fever within a somewhat longer
time. The conclusion should not, however,
be drawn from these statements that either
coffee or its substitutes are to be considered
of value on account of their slight antisep
tic properties, as too long a time is required
for the destruction of germs by them.
Truth Crushed1 to -Death.
From tiood Stories.
A worthy colored deacon, fvho had early
impressed upon his only son and heir the
moral of the George Washington cherry
tiee story, was fortunate enough to find
a fat 'possum recently. I** bore it in
triumph to his dwelling, and, assisted by
his son, cooked it to a juicy Jjrown.
"Now,"" said le, d"e best way ter eat a
'possum is col', so we'll jest let him stay
in de pantry, and when mawnln' come
he'll l?e mo' Juicier dan ever."
His son seemed sadly disappointed, but
he made the best of ft, and both retired
for the right.
The old man was up early next morn
ing, but the boy slept on.
On opening the safe the astonished pa
rent discovered nothing but bones in the
dish that had contained the 'possum. He
brought the drowsy youngster to his feet
with one vigorous Jerk, and, dragging
him to the scene of the wreck, he said:
"What does dat mean, eh?"
The boy fell on his knees and cried:
"Daddy, I can't tell a lie; I got up in
de night and eat it wld my little mouf."
The old man cald rJot a word, but, drag
ging the boy to tire front door, he held
him by the collar while he jerked a piece
of weather-boarding from the aide of the
house.
"Daddy!" cried the boy, "is you gwlne
ter lick me fer tellln' the truth?"
"No, you kinky-headed debbll,, you,"
thundered the bid man, "1 gwlne ter frajl
de hide off you lor eatin' de .'possum!"

TO SUSPEND OPERATIONS
Petition of Receiver Schoepf in Matter of
Belt Line Railway.
Expense* in Eieess of Receipt* and
Men Without I'ny-Order to
the Traateea.
In connection with the sale of the Belt
Line Railway, ordered yesterday. Judge
Cox this afternoon in Equity Court No.
1 signed an order requiring the Ameri
can Security and Trust Company, as trus
tee, to show cause tomorrow morning at
10 o'clock why a petition of W. Kesley
Schoepf, receiver, filed today, asking au
thority to suspend the operation of the
Belt railway and to sell the horses owned
by It should not be granted.
In his petition presented by Attorney
John Ridout, Mr. Schoepf stated that the
daily cash receipts of the Belt Railway
Company*:ire about $100, and average daily
expenses for feed and care of the horses,
v.-hi'-h numlier about 225. is $loo, and for
pay of wages, $135. Thus Receiver Schoepf
pointed out the daily expenses exceed the
dally income by about $75.
Arrears of Wnges.
The wages of the men employed in op
erating the road will be one month in ar
rears tomorrow, according to Receiver
Schoepf, that debt amounting to about
$4,000.
It being obviously impossible longer to
operate the road under the state of facts
set forth, in the expressed opinion of Re
ceiver Schoepf, that official. In his peti
tion, therefore, asked that he be author
ized by the court to immediately suspend
the operation of the Belt railroad, and
to sell the horses forthwith at auction for
cash, the proceeds of the sale to be applied
to the payment of the actual expense of
feed and care of the horses from this date
until sold, and the balance to be disposed
of In accordance with the further order
of the court.
Ran His Own Opposition.
From Printers' Ink.
How Is It that a man may make a profit
In running an opposition to himself?. A
canvassing man said he once visited an ad
vertiser in central New York who had a
hair renewer and a cure for the whooping
cough, for each of which he had some sale,
and all the bottles, whether for hair re
newer or cough cure, were filled from the
same tank. It was something not unlike
crude petroleum, and really was rather
good for either complaint.

THE WEALTH OF HAWAII
Conservative Estimate Puts It at
$50,000,000.
Foreigner* Own Two-Thirda of Thia?
Departure of the Native
Delegation.
Correspondence of The Evening Star.
HONOLULU, Hawaii.
November 20. ISD7.
Four of the native delegation to oppose
annexation sailed for Washington on the
20th, on the same ship with Senator Pettl
grew and Mr. Dubois. A great company of
native ladles crowded the wharf anl the
deck of the steamer, piling wreaths of flow
ers upen their shoulders, and covering ti.em
with kisses. The heads of Messrs. Pettl
grew and Dubois al?o were nearly hidden
by piles of wreaths. Washington will prob
ably see the delegates before this letter ar
rives, if no mishap befalls the inexperi
enced travelers In a. strange country and
inclement climate. They found much diffi
culty in collecting funds for the journey,
and are believed to have a scant supply.
Certain white royalists with capital were
applied to, but saw no use In investing in
a delegation so composed. You ran see for
yourselves the style of men they are. good
natured. pleasant gentlemen. It Is uue to
the native Hawalians to say that neither
the two full-natives nor the two part
whites of the delegation rank among the
higher grades of their fellows in ability or
culture. Most of those so ranking are
strongly In favor of annexation.
Statistics recently obtained from the tax
assessor's office are of Interest, as indi
cating the high position of Hawaii as a
land of wealth and prosperity. The total
property of Hawaii is assesred as follows:
Real estate $22,1X1,433
Personal property 17,4'Jl,o?t8
$39,674,901
This averagfs $304 to each of the loiMUO
inhabitants. Of the whole the full and
part-Hawalians own over one-fourth, being
$s.1?l,701. averaging $2uf> apiece, while the
0,758 Americens, British and Germans own
over two-thirds, or $20,701,008, being $3,051
per capita. One-third of this Is probably
owned by not more than fifty persons, al
though the number In easy circumstances
is large. It Is gratifying to believe that
most of the wealthy men have acquired
their property In ways that were honorable
and beneficent to the public, often convert
ing deserts into gardens. In a new cournry,
under good government, property is created
with great facility by men of brains and
enterprise.
The assessed values stated above are. of
course, much below the real values. Fifty
per cent in addition, or sixty millions In
all, Is probably a conservative estimate of
the present market value of property In the
Hawaiian Islands. Thirty years ago there
could not have been one-tenth as much.
With annexation must come a rapid in
crease of white population and develop
ment of resources, and the growth of val
ues must be rapid and great.
To the American people the point of Im
mediate Interest is that this large and
growing wealth Is practically American,
being under the rule and direction of Amer
icans, the islands being thoroughly Amer
icanized. If they continue in nominal inde
pendence, without political union to Amer
ica, this wealth and prosperity will be left
in jeopardy, at the mercy of internal condi
tions which are unsettled and unstable,
owing to diverse and conflicting eltments
of p-opulatlon, which, under annexation,
would soon be outnumbered or assimilated.
Still greater Is our peril from external In
terference. It Is for the United States to
save their noble colony, and build it up
Into a powerful American state.
By opponents of annexation, the Ameri
cans of Hawaii are slanderously described
as adventurers and filibusters. On the con
trary, they are generally men either born
here, or long and permanently Identified
with the Islands; quiet, enterprising and
diligent, who have wholly created the
wealth they own, and who were compelled
to assume control of the government in
order to save the country from the Ignor
ance and caprice of a corrupt monarchy.
Under their five years of administration,
Hawaii has wonderfully prospered and de
veloped, and no class has more prospered
than the native Hawalians themselves.

Security of Klertrlr Elevator..
From the Engineering Magazino.
The cost of electric elevator operation
Is lower than that of any other practical
method. The power required per car mil?
in office buildings varies from 2 kilowatt
hours (with the overbalanced worm pear)
to 4 kilowatt hours (with the underbalano
ed screw). Approximate costs on the cen?
tral service at 10 cents per h. p. hour for
small, and 10 cents per kilowatt hour for
large, consumers are* $11 to $1" for real,
dences, $10 to $31 for apartment houses,
$15 to $4o for loft and small office buildings,
and $40 to $1*0 for tall office buildings, per
mcnth.
In conclusion, and answer to the ques.
tion so often advanced, "Are electric ele
vators safe and reliable?" will not be un
fitting. Electric elevators are the safest
vehicles to travel in known to humanity.
None have ever fallen, nor have people
been killed by them except through their
o? n carelessness?a remarkable record,
considering the novelty and number of
machines installed. L.lke the motor of the
trolley car, they run in positions appar
ently ruinous to line machinery?such as
buildings half completed and damp holes?
without serious damage. They require but
little attention, oiling and cleaning being
necessary only once or twice a day, and
are highly efficient.
Good aid Cheap Roads.
From the Charleston New. and Courier.
The interesting fact was reported by
Abbeville that with road machines and con.
vlct labor the cost of Improving the roads,
even In that hilly and clayey county, wu
only from $T> to $6 per mile. Darlington,
which employs like machine* and labor, re
ported the coat of the convict force last
year at 25 cents a day per convict, and only
IS cents this year. On the basis of "coat"
exhibited In these counties It ought to be
practicable certainly for any county to
make good roc da that wants them. Ander
son paid for Its "machines," which are op
erated by convict labor, by means of "a
^i-mlll levy" and the "commutation tax."
Barnwell, with sandy soil, operates "a road
machine' with convict labor and has found
the system "satisfactory." The "old fcys
tem" still obtains In Chester county, where
"the soil is red and the county hilly," but
systematic ?%rk with the chain bangs has
made the roads "much better," and the
value of property. It Is said, has been "en
hanced by virtue of these Improvement*.'*
Darlington makes a special report, which 1*
of great Interest. The sandy roads In that
county have been "improved" by the plqa
of spreading a layer of clay on their sup.
face. A layer of "six Inches In depth" haa
made a "firm, hard roadway,** wbere thai*
was a soft, sandy one before, which, wlkpt
