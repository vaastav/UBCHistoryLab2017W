week, and asked me when my trial came
off; he had not been in my shop for three

cell I had nothing to do with stealing tbe
watch, but that I wont over tne river with
the watoh; never spoke to that man (point

Mr. Robinson. Am an Attorney at Law.
Wu present at the examination of Jame
Lynch before Justice Foljambe, in August
last. I heard the testimony of Mr. Minck. 7
u given then. (The witness testifies con
cerning that testimony substantially u did
Justice Foljambe on the previous day. He,
in aaamon, Mia tuat it raioeu uurmg tuo
night that he wu watching, and that ne
went home to change his wet clothes and re
turned; he did not remember that police
man Mix wu in tbe scop at the time ot ar
rest.) Minckley said that he saw a German
and his wife and child in the door of the
laughter house; Mr. Plaisted, Birnsmade
and myseir went to had tne log between tne
sessions of Court on the day of examination
ot Lynch. I waa able to find no log on the
grounds of tne orchard; looked over tne lot
and found only a small log in a ditch some
distance from the slaughter house; there wu
an old stump; the upper or out end of the log
rested on the bank; tne roots rested in the
water; under the sida of the log tho dirt had
washed away so that a hole large enough for
a hog to go through had been made; the cut
end of tho log rested on the top of the bank;
some dirt had been moved from the cut end
of the log; a hole had been dog sear the
bank toward the (laughter house which
looked u if it was done with a cane; the soil
wa of olay and did not look u it rain had
fallen on it ainoe the dirt had been moved,
Minckley before being recalled in the after
noon Mid that the hole wu not at tbe side
but at the end of the log. M inckley referred
to Green who wu present while testifying;
Minckley denied leaning against the tailing
in front ef the Johnson House.

1RIU0OI BISBI0K."
Continuation of Robinson's testimony.)
JvroM-Examined I wu present at the
trii J of Lynch before Justice Foljambe; Mr.
Platteid wu with me; I will sot be sure
whe thor anyone else went or not; I presume
that I might have heard something uid
about the ease before this ; Edwin Blade
acted t w an attorney for the prosecution ; I
sent t o hear the trial because I was inter
ested in it; my ourioaity wu excited; I think
Green hid been in the office where I am ; I
knew but little more of the case than that
there wu a prosecution against Green; I did
not goto remember what Minckley testified;
when I went over to the lot I saw that there
was perhaps an acre and a-half in tbe lot ;
did not find the log lying u I saw it at first
when I examined it this morning; I think
the bank has not been wuhing away all
along; the relative position ot the log to the
hnla ia different from what it wu; the log
has been swung around f one what; I have
talked with Green two or three times since
the occurrence; 1 wu not engaged u an at
Vrrney; I counselled him u a friend; Mr.
Q'reen hu been in the office occasionally, but
I u'0 not know that he hu been committed
with any in the office; I have heard him
talking a few words on this matter.
jgpia,'iid I was present at the examination
of Jas. .Lynch before Squire Foljombe, and
heard tl testimony oi jtiincaiey.
(The witness testified as to Minckley's tes-
timnnv Wore the Justice on the trial of
Lynch for burglary. The testimony wu in
substance the same u that given by the pre
vious witnesses on this point)
I (witness) went down to the place where
the Jog wu said to be; I saw no log in me
oreird, nor did I see any anywhere along;
we went up tne river ana saw an oia stump
which had been cut off, and saw by the log
a hole which looked as though it had been
due out of the hard earth with a smooth sub-
B ... :n i : 1 u- c-
stance i.ae a cane; uou nuunu uu mo ouu
a- nioht previous to the trial, and we ex
amined the earth and found all the little
fibres in the earth, so that I am positive that
ihre had been no rain: I was brought up on
clar ground, and think 1 have enough expe-
Hot : the log hu beed moved ; l wu tnere
with Mr. KODinoon: hits not iiee-ru ui xm
' ' f . i . i j v :
timony. Witnes described how the log
had been moved some eignt incite. j n tuny
have been moved by the stream; the log lies
17 rods from the first apple tree; I measured
it with a tone: Mr. Brinsmada was with me;
the stump Is 31 rods and 18 feet from the
slaughter house ooor; uu ug to 1001,
inr-hea long: irom tne jounaou u w un
log I should think it might be from 17 to
200 rods; I may be inside the mark; the
watch wu before the Justice; Minckley re
ferred to it u the same watch which ne caa
found on Green, and which had been buried
by the log.
Proas Examined I went from the exami
nation before the Justice to Edwin Blade's
office. I went alone. Blade said he would
catch Lynch if he could be got. I think
ftroen came into Blade's office just before
Lynch's examination. I don t know 1 nave
ever seen Green consulting with any one in
the office. I think I have seen him talking
with Blade. There wcra no relations between
Green and myself, except that he owes me
$1.50. L went down on tne r mis oecause i
had formed a very favorable opinion of him,
and thought it strange he should turn bur-
f lar all at once; my curiosity waa excited. I
istened to the testimony for the purpose of
using it subsequently, Mr. Blade said ha
didn t believe u ail ngnt, oo i piu
lar attention to the testimony. I listened to
Minckley particularly. When Minckley
cam back from the police office there was no
arrangement to get hold of Minekley's testi
mony and keep it for use. 1 had no preju
oieeagaint Minckley before I heard him tes
tify. I might have some little suspicion
about Minckley after his trial. I watched
hi testimony because it pertained to Green'
guilt, and the Hint reason led me to go to
eround. I did not tell the Dutchmen what
day it wssha uw Minckley at the slaughter
house. Yourself (Jos. Adams) and Mr. Ri
der examined Minckley for the defence. I
never lent word to Minckley that I would
whip him.
A. T. Brinsmada I am a member of the
bar. I waa- at th examination of Lynch
before Justice Foljambe during a part of th
time. I want to examine the orchard with
Mr, Robinson, and Plaisted about boob on
if
the day of theaxamination. Wa looked for
the log through the orchard, and oould not
find It: want along the bank audMW a stump
with the root in the river, anil part of the
tamp on the bank. We examined where
the watch wis said by Mincklav to have been
found, and at the end of the log saw a pile
of dirt. I had tbe impression that it wu
made by prying out with a cane. The dirt,
1 supposed, nau been thore but a short time.
My impression at the time wu that it had
not rained since the earth was dug. I ex
amined lbs log yesterday, and it hu been
moved; the soil, I thought, wu clayey. The
log was, wnon i uw it nivt, straigni out in
the stream; it is now resting with th roots
down stream. I think the log hu been
turned over ainoe.
Cross Examined When I got over there
my first investigation wu to look for the
log, which I supposed wu in tha oro hard.
I wanted to investigate concerning Green,
whom I had supposed to b an honest man.
I have felt some interest in this matter toth
present time. I wu in company with Mr.
Plaisted, and I don't think I wu requested
by any one to go over.
Daniel Eckart (Witness produeed tbe
watch) I reside on Kinsman street, corner
of Burnham. I testified before Esquire
foljambe on the examination ot Jno. lynch
I had this watch at the examination. 1
think this watch wu referred to by Minckley
at the examination of Lynch, The watch
which I hold in my hand wu taken between
tbe hours of 11 P. M. of the 20th and T A.
M. of tho 21st of August from my house.
Mr. Mine n ley brought uie watcn up to my
shop on Thutsday ol the Xla in the after
noon between 8 and 4 o'clock. I went down
to the Police Court directly. Did not see
Minckley the day before. Minckley went up
with me to make the aihidavit. I don't
think that he told me who it wu that wu to
be charged. I didn't read the affidavit.
Margaret Gregor (the witnes wu Ger
man, and wu questioned by an interpreter)
I live near Bholl' slaughter house. I re
member testifying before tsqoir Foljambe
in August. I have Seen Defendant before in
the slaughter house one Saturday. He wu
looking around, and asked my husband a
question. He said to the little girl, "Come,
Bis, go with me." It wu about one o'clock.
I wu scrubbing the floor, which I am in the
habit of doing every Saturday. Ha went
towards the bridge near the slaughter house,
and then towards the town. I never uw
Minckley there before.
Cross-examined. I came to this Court to
be a witneesjeveryiday this week and before;
my husband and myself were here when
Mr. Blade asked me to recognize Minckley.
She neither said ner hesrd anything about
him. She could know him by the mous
tache. There were three men came to see
my husband and self on the same day we
testified. They said nothing to me and I
didn't undorsland what they said to my
husband; I understand but little English.
ThomuGivens. I am employed u u-
sistsnt turnkey at Police Station. Green
and Lynch were brought in on the 21st day
of August, I think Wednesday; I remember
that they were brought in by Minckley and
Mix; Minckley had Green; I should think
it wu about 2 o'clock or thereabouts; Green
was put in the 2nd and Lynch in the 4th
rftl on tha right hand side. I believe there
wu charge made against Green; he wu .
bailed out that night; 1 let .Lynch out just
before Couit in the morning. (Testimony
with regard to Lynch objected to ) I am
under control of Mr. Wizeman,the turnkey,
Minckley and Gallagher. I wu a witness
against Lynch before Foljambe with regard
to declarations made by Lynch in the Watch
House; I don t know whether Lynch left tha
Watch House or not; I lot him out at Mr.
Rider' request. I was ubphonaed in
Lvnch'i case before the Grand J ury ; Minck
ley hu uid nothing to me to induoe me to
swear; he asked me once if I did not hear
Green offer him $100; I uid no; he uked me
if I heard Green make any remark; Miack-
ey has said nothing to me to prevail me to
modify my testimony. I osme before the
Grand Jury about 814 o'clock Monday;
Minckley saw my subphcena; ne Mid notn
ing to me nor gave me any directions; I
went away to the watch house from here;
he uid nothing to me at any time in the
hall; I started away at about 11X o'clock;
I saw Minckley give a key to Mr. Boyd and
I went away with Boyd; i went into tne
Marshal's office then and went to sleep. I
do not know that Minckley came there while
I wu there; 1 don t know how long I wu
there. I know Mary Ann Coleman. - I
don't know that I saw Minckley give any
directions with regard to her more than any
one else.
James Lynch 1 have seen the defendant.
Minckley: I wu connected with the bur
glary wi h Edward Johnson; Johnson went
in and I stood outside of the gate; it wu
committed about two o'clock on Wednesday
morning ; we were stopping on Marshal
street; he buried the watch in the corner of
the cellar at home; it remained there till
right after break fut Wednesday morning; we
came right down town, and the next I saw
of the watch Minckley had it; we were in
Kider s otuce, over Mollen s auction room;
it wu on Thursday about one o'olock;
Minckley, Johnson and myself were there;
Minckley came from outeide; he took the
watch from his pocket and alunr it on tha
table, and said, I have there a time piece;
Johnson said to me, you'd better go and try
and sen it; ne Mid alio, tnattne best way
would be for ma to go down by the pars and
sell it to Green; I'll go over to Green's shop
and try and get him to go down there; John
son went and came back, and sent me down
through the alley; I went down by the
freight oars, and 1 staid there about two
minutes behind a freight car : then I came
out on to the track and saw Johnson at the
foot of Canal street, he beckoning to me, and
I went toward him; went right up Superior
street u far as Mollen's auction room, and
then went over to the Weddell House; we
pursued Minckley, who was standing on the
corner, and went down u far as the back of
the Weddell House; we turned around there
and passed him again and went right down
to Green's shop, I being a little ahead; we
went down into the shop; I went over to
Green, who wu standing there, and showed
him the watch; he wu looking at it, took it
in his hand, and l told mm l wanted to pawn
it to him, end asked him what he gave on
it : I told him I wanted $5 at first, and he
said he could'nt give that, but Mid he'd give
me H for it; ha gave me a $4 Canada bill
which he pulled out) I had the money in my
pocket; Johnson was standing on tbe stairway
and he went up the steps and beckoned to
Minckley; Jiinokley men cam down tne
stops, and Ureen wu standing ia tne corn
er; he uid, ''What's going oft here? What's
the matter? VY nat nave yon got oerer-
He got the watch and took bold of Green
by the collar and arrested us. Mr. Mix
came right down afterwards. Green put on
his coat and Minckley took him on ahead,
and Mix and me were behind. The took us
to the Watch House. Tbey put mem one
cell and Green in another. I remained
there till Friday morning, and Mr. Rider
came and got me out about 8 o'clock.
When we were in Rider's offioe Johnson
uid they wanted to make Green loose some
property. They seemed to have a grudge
. i 1 u . U - , 1 J i..
agaiCBt IllIU; UD BXUU UIS Tfaj KV1UU WO IV
sell him tha watch, and while him and me
were making the bargain he would get
Minckley to catch us at it. Johnson said
first that they'd try it at half-put 1 o'clock;
would send me down to the freight cars;
he uid he would go over to the shop and
try to get a man down to the oars. I went
down to the cars, but Johnson couldn't get
him down there. He told ma that, when
ha got back to the offioe. He then uid
I should gs to the shop at 2 o'clock and try
to m11 it. When we found Minckley at the
corner the second time Johnson kind of
whispered to him but I did'nt understand
what he said. When Minckley got down
in the shop he winked his eye at me.
Minckley and Rider both uid in Rider's
office you won't be there three hours before
you will be let out again. Rider wu there
about five minutes: he must hare known
all about it; after I wu let out of the watoh
houM on Friday morning I met Johnson and
a man who wu charged with fighting and
wa went over to Bate' to get our breakfast.
I gave th Canada Hill to Johnson on Friday
alter I wu let out and he got small bills for
It; I was at Mrs, Boston's on Marshall street
whore me and Ed Johnson stays, and I wa
sitting there snd Minckley cam for me in
a buggy and I went with him to th Polio
Court. He told me what to swear toi he
told me to swear that I went to the barber
shop to get shaved; I swore in the cam and
testified teat I did'nt get say Canada bill and
didn't sell the watch to Green. I went away
after I had sworn.- Johnson remained out
side at the loot of the stairs when I went ia
to sell the watch.
The Court at this (tag adjourned until
nine o'clock this morning.

CAMP QUIGLEY, Dec. 6.
' Ed. LuDitt Our march proved a short
one. We left tbe esmp known In military
report u Jenkins, but in th ecmnaon soldier's
vocabulary it hath for a nam i'Mis
ery," "Desolation," "Mudhol," Ac, ort the
morning of the 6th. Some bade th old
camp good-bye, but most were too glad to
be off to wut breath in adieu. The march,
though brief, wu wearisome. It soon end
ed, and hare we are, one mllo from Louis
ville in B beautiful grove which we christen
ed Haxen, but the modesty of our worthy
Colonol hu caused him to change it to
Quigley. The situation is pleasant iu itself.
and is rendered delightful by contrast with
the one we hay just left. Our worthy com
mender (Col. Hasan) took great pain to se
cure it for us, and uide from the deairable-
U(s of th place in itself, it hu a peculiar
fitness in that two hoar time would put no
either on board the ear for Bowling Green,
or on th river en routt for Columbus, as we
may be needed.
Troop ar still being thrown into Ken
tucky, and towards both the above named
point with grut rapidity. The 19th Ohio
wu encamped within half a mileof ns yes
terday, bat are off on the Nashville road to
day. The probabili ties are that we soon fol
low; but of the day and hour we know not,
bnt always hold ourselves ready for tha word
"forward, match." Our baggag is being cut
down to the lowest passible standard. We
have had 28 wagons, and are to have but 13
for the regiment. Our extra blankets, quilts,
Ao , must be left when w start again, and
also more than half of our hospital stores,
and provisions for health mutt decrease, and
our hardship increase; yet there is little,
ve little, if any complaining. We expect
ed hardship, danger, and perhaps death.
Th cause is safe, and in that success we
triumph and are content.
Capt. Tolls is with us again. Hi arrival
in camp wu greeted with loud and hearty
cheering, and it aeemed hard to determine
whether captain or men moat enjoyed th
re-union.
Our pay ha not come, but is daily ex
pected.
The reports of the 41st were sent to Gen.
Buel's headquarters yesterday. After ex
amining them, he inquired who made them
out, and on being told it wu Bergt. Patch in
Mid, "I have um for him; order Bergt. P. to
report at my quarters." He left ns this
morning, both he and the company regret
ting the separation.
The mail for the 41st, whioh wa sent to
Gallipolis, arrived in camp this afternoon.
The pile wu large, and caused great rejoic
ing. If people at home knew how soldier
prize new from home, they would write far
oftener than they do. Th present i very
endurable, and the prospect of the future,
though hard, are hopeful.

CONGRESSIONAL.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.
SENATE.
Ur. CLandlar offered a resolution inscrucU
ng tbe Milita'V Committee to inquire into
tbe expediency of appointing a Joint Com
mittee of tbe two Boose of Conzresa, who
shall bare power to retire any improper
acers of tbe armv or nary. Agreed to.
Mr. Morrill introduced a joint resolution
for tbe eonncation of tbe property of rebels.
-tnd for tbe sat ib taction of the claim ofloyal
men.

new military and mail rout to Baltimore.
Referred to tbe Military Committee.
Mr. Wilson introduced a bill to Increase
he number of cadets at West Point. Be-
terred to Military Committee.
Mr. lieamith announced the death of hi
-olleague, Edward Dickinson Baker, United
States Senator from Oregon, and paid a brief
ana feeling tribute to bis wortb and bravery,
and offered the usual resolutions of respect to
hi memory.
Mr. McDoogal followed, referring to tb
decease of two distinguished Senators, Messrs.
Douglas and Baker.
Messrs. Browning and Cowan followed.
Mr. Latham closed with a most beautiful,
eloquent and toncbing eulogy on the deceas
ed, when the Senate adjourned.
HOUSE.
Lovejoy offered a resolution instructing the
Committee oa Foreign Affair to report a
bill establiahfng diplomatic relations between
the United States and Hayti and Liberia.
Resolution lies over.
Blair of Mo., offered a resolution, declaring
it just to recognize tne eminent and patnutic
wrvices of the late Gen. Lyon, and tendering
tbe thanks of Congress to the brave officers
and soldiers under bis command, who sus
tained tbe honor of the flag and achieved a
victory at Springfield, Moj and in order to
commemorate the event, each Regiment en
gaged on that occasion bear on its color tba
word Springfield in letters of gold, and that
these resolutions be read at the head of the
liffarent regiments of tbe army of tbe Cnitad
States.
Blair believed tbe Government had taken
o notice at all of the death of Gen. Lyon,
and hence the propriety of tbe passage of tbe
resolution. He knew tbe man well; one,
never lived who cared more for his con try
and less for himself. The resolution wag
adopted.
Mr. Lansings preambla and resolution
offered on Monday, came op.
Stevens ot fenn., said if tbe pa&age of
the resolution is to have a good effect, eepe-
cinlly in the West, the sooner it ia passed tbe
better.
Tne allegation of Gen. Halleck as an ex
cuse for his order that fugitive slaves, whom
he proposes to exclude from bis lives, give
information to tbe enemy, ia too bald a pre
text to justify him. The return of fugitive
slaves was intended by Gen. McClellan, and
had been followed by Generals Dix, Kelley,
and others. Ail these cases are a disgrao to
the profession of arms. If such retoras of
fugitives have been made by orders of th
Commanding Generals they deserve to have
their epaulettes stripped from their shoulders,
and if it has been done by higher authority,
men uoa forgive them, lor they know not
what they do.
Lovejoy, of Illinois, expressed bis honest
conviction that such orders were issued by
tbe commanding Generals of tbe army with
out orders from the President. He wag sat
isfied ot this fact while the President does not
remove and cashier them, as he (Lovejoy)
would. He did not believe that they, tbe
commanding Generals, bad power for such
inhuman and shameful measures.
Blair, of Missouri, said Stevens had evi
dently misunderstood Gen. Halleck's order.
Tbe latter (Halleck) informed him that he
had no idei of doing anything contrary to
the law of the last Congress, and the policy
of the Government.
A debate ensued between Blair aod Love
joy on the subject of Gen. Halleck's recent
order about alaves.
Mr. Julian referred to the case of Colonel
Brown, of an Indiana regiment, who refused
to deliver np fugitives until o ordered by
Secretary Cameron. He presumed the Ad
ministration sanctioned sncb proceedings.
Kellogg assumed to say the Administra
tion had nothing to do with that order, and
would not indicate sncn a policy to tb army.
The resolution which caused this debate
was tabled by 78 to 84.
The resolution looking to the recognition
of the independence of Hayti and Liberia
waa adopted with tba amendment that the
Committee on Foreign Affair enquire into
tb expediency of doing so.
The subject of abolishing the franking
privilege came up.
Colfax remarked the Committee on Post
Offices and Roads had framed a bill to abolish
it.
The bill also requires members to show
the absolute necessity of new post rootea.
Adjourned.
