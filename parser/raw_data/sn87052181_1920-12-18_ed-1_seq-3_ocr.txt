WILSON MESSAGE
President Urges That Our De
mocracy Prove Its Purity
and Power to Prevail.
WORLD'S HOPE RESTS IN US
America Must Make and Enforce Laws
That Are Unquestionably Just, and
Stand for Right and Justice as
Toward Individual Nations.
Washington, Dec. 7. President Wil
son's message to congress was rend In
Jjoth houses by the clerics, Mr. Wilson
having decided not to deliver It In
person. The message In full follows:'
Gentlemen of the congress:
When I addressed myself to per
forming the duty Inld upon the Presi
dent by the Constitution to present to
you an annual report of the state of
the Union, I found my thought domi
nated by an Immortal sentence of
Abralmrn Lincoln's, "Let us have
faith that right makes might, and In
that faith let us dnre to do our duty
as we understand It;" n sentence Im
mortal because It embodies In a form of
utter simplicity nnd purity the essen
tial faith of the nation, the faith In
-which It was conceived, and the faith
In which It has grown to glory nnd
power.
Willi that fnlth nnd the birth of a
nation founded upon It came the hope
into the world that a new order would
prevail throughout the affairs of man
kind, an order In which reason and
right would take precedence of covet
ousness and force, and I believe thnt
I express the wish ahd purposo of ev
ery thoughtful American when I say
that this sentence mnrks for us In the
plainest nmnner the part wo should
.play alike In the arrangement of our
domestic affairs and In our exercise
of Influence upon the affairs of the
world. By this fnlth, and by this faith
alone, can the wo'rld be lifted out of
Its present confusion nnd despair. It
was tills fnlth which prevailed over
.the wicked force of Germany. You
will remember that the beginning of
the end of the war came when the
5erman people found themselves face
rto face with the conscience of the
world, nnd realized thnt right was ev
erywhere arrayed ngalnst the wrong
6hnt their government was attempting
ito perpetrate. I think, therefore, that
'It Is true Jo sny that, this was the
'faith which" won the war. Certainly
this Is the faith with which our gal
lant men went Into the Held and out
uponthe..sens to roal;e sure, of victory.
This Is the mission upon which de
roocracy camp Into the world. Democ
racy Is an assertion of the right of the
individual to live and to bo treated
justly as ngalnst any attempt on the
part of any combination of Individuals
to make lnws which will overburden
iilm or which will destroy .his equality
nmong his fellows In the mntter. of
right or privilege, and I think wo all
realize that the day has come when
democracy Is being put upon Its final
test. The old world Is just now suf
fering from a wanton rejection of the
principle of democracy and a substitu
tion of the prlnclplo of autocracy as
Asserted In the name but without the
authority and sanction of the multi
tude. This Is the time of all others
when democracy should prove Its puri
ty nnd Its spiritual power to prevail.
It Is surely the manifest destiny of the
tJnlted States to lead In the attempt to
make this spirit prevail.
Two Things for Us to Do.
There are two ways In which the
TJnlted Stales enn assist to accomplish
this great object. First, by offering
the example within her own borders of
the will power of democracy to make
and enforce laws which nrcunques
tlonably Just and which ,are equal In
their administration laws which se
cure Its full right to lnbor and yet at
the same time safeguard tho Integrity
of property, and pnrtlculnrly of that
property which Is devoted to the de
velopment of Industry .and the In
crease of the necessary wealth of tho
world. Second,, by standing for right
nd Justice as towards individual na
tions. The law of democracy Is for
the protection of tho weak and the In
fluence of every democracy In the
world should bo for the protection of
the weak nation, tho nation which Is
struggling toward Its right and to
ward Its proper recognition and priv
ilege In the family of nations.
The United States cannot refuse
this rolo of champion without putting
the stigma of rejection upon the great
nnd devoted men who brought Its gov
ernment into exlsfenco and established
It In the face of almost universal op
position and Intrigue, even In face
of wanton force, ns, for example,
against tho order in council of Great
Britain nnd the arbitrary Napoleonic
decrees which Involved us In what we
Itnow ns the war of 1812.
Sample Democracy of World.
I urgo you to consider that tho dis
play of an Immedlato disposition on
tho pnrt of congress to remedy any In
Justices or evils that ,may have shown
themselves In onrjmtlonnl llfo will
nfford tho rnost 'effectual offset to tho
forces of chaos and tyranny which nro
playing so disastrous n part In the
fortunes of tho free peoples of more
than one part of the world. The
United States Is of necessity tho t,am
plo democracy of tho world, and the
triumph of democracy depends upon
Its success.
Recovery from the disturbing and
sometimes disastrous effects of the
late war has been exceedingly slow on
the other side of the water, and has
given promise, I venture to say, of
early completion only In our own for
tunate country; but even with us the
recovery hults nnd Is Impeded at times,
and there ure Immedlato serviceable
nets of legislation which. It seems to
rao, we ought to attempt to assist that
recovery and prove the Indestructible
recuperative force of a great govern
ment of the people. One of these Is
to prove that n great democracy can
keep hope as successfully and In ns
buslness-liko a fashion as any other
government. It seems to me that the
first step toward proving this Is to
supply ourselves with a method of
handling our estimates nnd expendi
tures, nnd bringing them to the point
where they will not be nn unnecessary
strain upon our Income or necessitate
unroasonable taxation: In other words,
a workable budget system, and I sug
gest that two elements are essential
to such a system namely, not only
that tho proposal of appropriations
should ho. In tho hands of a single
body, such as a single appropriations
committee In each house of the con
gress, but also that this body should
be brought Into such co-operation with"
the departments of the government
and with the treasury of tho United
States as would cnablo It to act upon
a complete conspectus of the needs of
tho government and the resources from
which It must draw Its" Income.
I reluctantly vetoed the budget bill
passed by the last session of the con
gress because of a constitutional objec
tion. The house of representatives
subsequently modified the bill In order
to meet this objection. In the revised
form I believe that the bill, coupled
.with action already taken by the con
gress to revlso Its rules and procedure,
furnishes the foundations for an effec
tive national budget system. I ear
nestly hope, therefore, that one of tho
first steps taken by the present session
of the congress will be to pass the
budget bill.
Marked Gain In Finances.
Tho nation's finances havo shown
marked Improvement during the past
year. Tho total ordinary receipts of
$6,094,000,000 for the fiscal year 1020
exceeded those for 1919 by fl, 642,000,
000, while the total net ordinary ex
penditures decreased from $18,514,000,
000 to $6,403,000,000. Tho gross public
debt, which reached Its, highest point
on Aug. 31, 1919. when It' was $26,1596,
000,000, had dropped on Nov. 30, 1920,
to $24,175,000,000. There also has been
a marked decrease In holdings of gov
ernment w r securities by the banking
Institutions of tho country, ns well as
the amount of bills held by the federal
reserve banks secured by government
war obligations.
This fortunate result has relieved
tho banks and left them freer to finance
the needs of agriculture, Industry and
commerce. It has been duo In largo
part to the reduction of tho public
debt, especially of the floating debt,
but moro particularly to the Improved
distribution of government securities
among permanent investors. The ces
sation of the government's borrowings
except through short term certificates
of indebtedness has been a matter of
great consequence to the people of the
country at large, as well as to the
holders of Liberty bonds and Victory
notes, and has had an Important bear
ing on tho matter of effective credit
control.
Tho year has been characterized by the
progressive withdrawal of the treasury
rrom the domestic credit market and
from a position of dominant Influence In
that market. The future course will nec
essarily depend upon the extent to which
economies are practiced one upon the
burdens placed upon the treasury, as well
as upon Industrial development and the
maintenance of tax receipts at a suf
ficiently high level.
Big Bond Issue to Mature.
The fundamental fact which at present
dominates the government's financial sit
uation Is that $7,500,000,000 of Its war In
debtedness matures within the next two
and a half years. Of this amount 12,000,
000,000 are floating debt and $3,000,000,000
victory notes and war savings certificates.
Tho fiscal program of tho government
must be determined ' with reference to
these maturities. Sound policy demands
that the government expenditures be re
duced to the lowest amount which will
permit the various services to operate
efficiently and that government receipts
from taxes and salvage be maintained
sufficiently high to provide for current
requirements, Including Interest and sink
ing fund charges on the public debt, and
at the same time retire the floating debt
and part of the victory loan before ma
turity. With rigid economy, vigorous salvage
operations and adequate revenues from
taxation, a surplus of current receipts
over current expenditures can be realized
and should be applied to the floating debt.
All branches of the government should
co-operate to see that this program is
realized.
I cannot overemphasize the necessity
of economy in government appropriations
and expenditures and the avoidance by
the congress of practices which take
money from the treasury by Indefinite or
revolving-fund appropriations. The esti
mates for the present year show that
over a billion dollars of expenditures were
authorized by the last congress in addi
tion to the amounts shown In tho usual
complied statement of appropriations.
Specific Appropriations Urged.
This' strikingly illustrates -the Impor
tance of making direct and specific ap
propriations. The relation between the
current receipts and current expenditures
of the government during tho present fls.
cat yoar.'as well ns during the last half
of the last fiscal year, has been disturbed
by the extraordinary burdens thrown
upon the treasury by the transportation
act, in connection with the return of tho
railroads to private control. Over $600,
000,000 has already been paid to the rail
roads under this act $350,000,000 during
the present fiscal year and It Is estimated
that further payments aggregating pos
sibly $050,000,000 must still bo mado td, the
railroads during the current year. It Is
obvious that theso largo payments havo
already seriously limited the government's
progress In retiring the floating debt.
Closely connected with this, it seems to
me, Is the necessity for an Immediate
consideration of the revision of our tax
laws. Simplification of the Income nnd
profits taxes has become an Immediate
necessity. Theso taxce performed an In
dispensable service during the war. The
need for their simplification, however, Is
very great in order to savo tho taxpayer
Inconvenience and expense and in order
to make his liability moro certain and
definite. Other and more detailed recom
mendations with regard to taxes will no
doubt be laid betoro you by the secretary
of tho treasury and tho commissioner of
Internal revenue.
Would Aid War Heroes.
It Is my privilege to draw to the atten
tion of congress for every sympathetic
consideration the problem of providing
adequato facilities for tho care and treat
ment of former members of the military
and naval fricea who are sick or disabled
as the result of their participation in tho
war. These herolo men can nevor bo paid
In money for the service they patrioti
cally" rendered the nation. Their reward
will lie rather In realization of the fact
that they vindicated the rights of their
country and aided In safeguarding civili
zation. The nation's gratitude must be
effectively revealed to them by the most
ample provision for their medical care
and treatment as well as for their voca
tional training and placement.
Tho tlmo has come when a more com
plete program can be formulated and
more satisfactorily administered for
I heir treatment and training, and I earn
estly urge that the congress give the
matter Its early consideration. The sec
retary of the treasury and the board for
vocational education will outline In their
annual reports proposals covering medi
cal care and rehabilitation which I am
sure will engage your earnest study and
command your most generous support.
Permit mo to emphaslzo onco more
tho need for action upon certain matters
upon which I dwelt at some length In
my messago to tho second session of the
COth congress: The necessity, for exam
ple, of encouraging the manufacture of
dyestuffs and related chemicals; the Im
portance of ilolng everything possible to
promote agricultural production along
economic lines, to Improve agricultural
marketing and to make rural llfo more
aUructtvo and healthful; the need for a
law regulating cold storage In such a way
as to limit tho time during which goods
may bo kept In storage, prescribing the
method of disposing of them If kept be
yond tho permitted period, and requiring
goods released from storage In all cases'
to bear tho dato of their receipt.
Would Mark Storage Goods.
It would also be most serviceable It
It wer. provided that all goods reUased
from cold storage for Interstate shipment
should havo plainly marked upon each
packago tho selling or markot prices at
which they went Into storage, In order
that tho purchaser might bo able to
lenrri what profits stood between him and
tho producer or tho wholesale dealer. In
deed, it would be very serviceable to the
public If all goods destined for Inter
state commerce wore made to carry upon
every package riso whose form made
it possible a plain statement of lho prlco
at which they left the hands of tho pro
ducer. I respectfully call your attention,
also, to tho recommendations of the mes
sage referred to with -egard to a federal
license for all corporations engaged In
Interstate commerce.
In brief tho immediate legislative
need of the tlmo Is tho removal of nil
obstacles to tho realization of tho best
ambitions of our peoplo In their sev
eral classes of employment and the
strengthening of all Instrumentalities
by which difficulties are to bo met and
removed and Justice dealt out, wheth
er by law or by somu form of media
tion and conciliation. I do not feel it
to be my privilege at present to sug
gest tho detailed and particular meth
ods by which these objects may bo
attained, but I have faith that the In
quiries of your several committees will
discover the waand the method.
Asks for Loan to Armenia.
In response to what I believe to be
the impulse of sympathy nnd opinion
throughout tho United States, I ear
nestly suggest hat the congress au
thorize the treasury of the United
States to make to the struggling gov
ernment of Armenia such a loan as
was made to several of the allied gov
ernments during the war, and I would
also suggest that It would bo desira
ble to provide In the legislation Itself
that tho expenditure of the money thus
loaned should be under the supervision
of a commission, or at least a com
missioner, from tho United States, In
order that revolutionary tendencies
within Armenia itself might not be af
forded by tho loan a further tempting
opportunity.
Allow me to call your attention to the
fact that tho people of the Philippine
Islands have succeeded In maintaining a
stable government since the last action
of the congress in their behalf and have
thus fulfilled tho condition set by the
congress as precedent to a consideration
of granting Independence to the islands.
1 respectfully submit that this condition
precedent having been fulfilled, It Is now
our liberty and our duty to keep our
promise to the peoplo of those Islands by
granting them the Independence which
they so honorably covet.
I have not so much laid before you a
series of reommendatlons, gentlemen, as
sought to utter a confession of faith, of
the faith In whlih I was bred and to
which It Is my solemn purpose to stand
by until my last fighting day. I believe
this to be the faith of America, the faith
of the nation, and of all the victories
which await national action In the days
to come, whether in America or elsewhere.
Vast Crater on the Moon.
The moon, of course, Is pitted nil

eral of the bigger ones are near the
center of the lunar hemisphere which
faces the earth. Ono of these, about
100 miles In diameter, might bo de
scribed as n huge ring of lofty moun
tains surrounding a circular plain.

theater when It is explained that It
would contain nil of the territory be

city, together with those centers of
population. A striking picture Illus
trating this fact is presented In tho
Popular Science Monthly. It shows
Long Island sound, New York bay,
Brooklyn and Manhattan Island within
ono edge of tho crater, while In tho
distance, and within the opposite edge,
ono sees Trenton, the Delnwaro river
and the City of Brotherly Love.

The Messiah bhall be revealed from Mlg.

den. xxxv, 21.
HE sun wns setting In n
blaze of glory, deepening
the shadows which were
beginning to veil from
view the Hebron rond
stretching through the
valley and across the
hills, far to the west
ward. Four shepherds
who were driving In their
flocks from the four
finHnriKJ t F tn lkiit.h)in
gJ) lnnds of the wide plateau
of Bethlehem met lit thu
Mlgdnl Eder (tower of the flock),
which rose from the peufold neur tho
rond to Jerusalem.
Tlie.se were not ordlnnry shepherds.
They were shepherds of the flocks
which were reserved for sncrlllclnl
purposes at the temple, and were re
garded as men of no .mean position.
This was particularly true of Mlsnol,
the chief shepherd, whoso three-score-nnd-ton
years sut upon him with n
lightness and a grace which would
have done credit to any man of forty.
"Children." snlil Mlsnol nn title: nnr.
tlculnr ovenlne- when tliov mit nt tliplr
Mlgdnl Eder, "I have been thinking all
any or the marvelous memories which
hallow our beloved city."
"And not only memories," broke In
Achcel, the flrst assistant, who sought
to imitate everything which he deemed
so admirable In tho leader; "but think
of the prophecy which makes tho fu
ture .so glorious for Bethlehem."
"Yes," said MIsaol, "that Is true,
Acheel; "It is here that the Messiah
Is to bo born; but heaven only knows
when that great event will come to
pass. I had hoped It might be In my
time; but I suppose I am too old now
to dare look forward to so great a hap
piness." Mlsael was Interrupted at this point
by the advent of travelers. It wus
but a smnll party, consisting of an
elderly but robust man, n radiantly
beautiful girl and a donkey on tho
back of which the girl was sitting.
"Friends," said the elderly man,
"we ure belated and fear thnt wo may
not reach tho carnvansttry .at Bethle
hem until darkness hits closed In. Al
though we wero born here, It Is long
since we havo been here. My wife re
members nothing of the city; nnd I,
too. have forgotten Just whore tho
caravansary is. Will you bo kind
enough to direct us to It?"
"I will gladly take you to the cara
vansary," said Mlsael. And giving
hurried directions to his assistants,
'" shepherd led the way toward tho
city.
.Many have been coming through
this way," he said to the travelers. "It
Is on account of tho new census which
the king is making for Home."
The elderly traveler answered, "That
Is what has brought us here, too, to be
enrolled under tho edict of Augustus.
Wo havo been brought up to respect
the law; ntld next to God's law and
our own, thnt of Homo calls for our
obedience now."

Dwarf Owls.
There Is nn owl so small that It
might very properly bo called tho
"vest-pocket edition." Very llttlo Is
known of this Interesting llttlo bird,
becnuso of Its shyness and smnll size.
In Arizona and New Mexico, where
tho giant cactus rises from 15 to 20
feet above the landscape, this little
elf Is found. Its color Is gray or
brown. It Is not much larger than a
sparrow. Its specialty consists In
thu floor for the night if only some
better provision could be made for his
young wife, who, he said, was au ex
pectant mother.
"We have como from Nazareth," he
said, "nnd have, spent three days
Journeying hither."
'If you will accept such accommo
dations as I can afford," said tho
shepherd Mlsael, "I will be glad to give
up my quarters to you. They are In
a cave near ono of the three cisterns
of DnvJd nnd not so very far from
where wo first met."
"My name is Joseph," replied the
elderly traveler, "and I am hut u poor
carpenter; but such thanks as I nm
able to make I liopo you will accept
for your kindness."
With the aid of the other shepherds
Mlsael set the cave in as good order
ns so crude a place with such meager
furnishings permitted. Evidently the
cave had once been used as a stable,
as there still was a manger in one
corner of It.
And then these good shepherds went
away, leaving Joseph nnd Mnry filled
with gratitude toward God for having
provided them with shelter In so
strange a manner and nt so critical u
time.
With the flute nnd song and stories,
the shepherds entertained themselves
until Inte into tho night. The crowing
of n rooster in a distant barnyard
sounded strangely nt variance with
the sweet and mournful strains of tho
song.
"Why, tho stars show that midnight
lias not yet como; I wonder what could
havo caused Hint cock to crow so
early?" said one.
A star, Immensely Inrger thnn any
they had ever seen, gleamed myste
riously In the sky directly over their
heads; and, at the snme time, n lumi
nous mist began settling over tho Mlg
dal Eder, the flock-tower, nenr which
tho shepherds hnd pitched their place
of vigil. The mist grew brighter and
brighter until It shone like the miildny
sun, hut with a more subdued sheen,
which enabled them to look at it with
out being blinded.
In the center of this light tho winged
figure of n young mnn of transcendent
benuty appeared. What followed Is
best and most reverently related Jn
the words of the gospel Itself (St.
Luke , !) to 15) :
"And, lo, the angel of tho Lord
came upon them, nnd tho glory of tho
Lord shone round nhout thorn; nnd
they wero soro afraid.
"And the angel said unto them,
'Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good
tidings of great Joy, which shall be to
all people.

"And It came to pnss, us the angels

"Can It be possible that we have

moments Inter, when they hnd drawn

saw thnt it wns filled with n light
similar to that which hnd shone
around the angel ; nnd Joseph came
out to them and told them of the birth
of the babe, and led them In townrd

And the. four shepherds prostrated
Lthemselves before the babe, and
