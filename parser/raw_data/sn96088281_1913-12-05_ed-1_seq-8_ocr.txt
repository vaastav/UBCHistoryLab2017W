RIG IIAITU; IN .MEXICO
is (osiim;ui;i imminent
Washington, Doc. 4. A big battle
seemed Imminent at Tampico today
between strong forces of Mexicuu reb
els and federals. Having approved
General Huorta's acts as president
nnd dictator, Mexico's congress was
expected to annul tho last election
this afternoon and porhaps ratify a
big railroad concession to a Belgian
company.
Mexico City diplomats smiled at
Huerta's boaBt that he- would stick to
his present post for a year, believing1
ho knows as well as any one that his
reglmo's end Is near. i
Reports that Queen Wllhelmlna of
Holland had offered to mediate In
Mexico and that lluerta had refused
wan skeptically received. I
It developed that when British oil
producers cancelled their contracts
to supply the Mexican National Rail
ways with fuel, they did It merely to
please the rebels nnd that the rail
ways will continue to get their fuel
oil. I
News that Antonio Caballero, north
Mexican millionaire, had boon shot
for plotting against the rebels pro
duced n painful Impression among
Mexico City officials, who feared their
turns would come next. I
President Wilson's message to con
gress was suppressed at Vera Cruz.
General Villa nnnonneed that he
ntid his rebel forces would occupy,
Chihuahua City tonlsht or tomorrow.'
Survivors of tho federals who fled
from Chihuahua City were expected
at thft border this afternoon, but
many were said to hnve died on th
road.
TEXAS SVTFFRS GREAT
DAMXC.E FROM FLOOD
Austin. Texas, Doc. 3. Texas to-;
day was experiencing Its worst flood
In 12 years. Several small towns
were practically wiped out. do?ens of
acres of land were Inundated, levees
were broken, bridges were washed
out and hundreds of families hud
been driven from their homes.
So tar as known here, only 11
persona had been drowned. A dis
patch from Dallas placed the figure
at 20, however. Communication was
nearly stopped into the stricken re-
gion, too, owing to the collapse of
many lines of telegraph, and it was
feared that fullor reports would!
greatly lengthen the death roll.
The damage was done mainly in
the valleys of the Colorado, Brazos
and Trinity rivers, which, swollen by
36 hours of torrential rains, were far
out of their banks.
The Bra'zoB was at the 38-foot
stage, according to Dallas' advices,
and the Colorado had reached the
26-foot mark, and was still rising
rapidly.

cots, on the fourth were smaller
rooms, and on the fifth was a dormi
tory lined with tiers of bunks.
It was among the lodgers on the
top floor that most of the fatalities
occurred. r ' '
"I was awakened by men jumping
on my stomach as they fought to get
out," said Frank Parker, one of the
patrons of the fifth floor dormitory,
who escaped naked, tearing his legs
badly as he slid down a ladder. "I
did not know at first what was the!
matter, but I saw there was danger
and rushed to the door only to be
driven hack by the smoke. Then I
sprang to a window. There were
20 others ahead of me and we fought
to escape. Finally some of us climb
ed out on to the coping. Flames
were whirling below us, but the fire
behind kept us from getting back.
I saw no hope and was about to jump
when the people below shouted to
me that the firemen were going to
raise a ladder. They did raise one
just in time, and I leaped and caught
but I think some who tried to jumpj
fell Into the nlley and were burled i
In the ruins."
