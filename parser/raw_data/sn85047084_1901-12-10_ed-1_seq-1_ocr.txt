J the iluor of the Anglican synod

the bishop's henchmen and the synods-

two members of the synod prevented -
this extreme action, which was clearly
the policy of the bishop.
Through.. ut last night's proceedings
there was every attempt made by
Bishop Willis to show his dislike of
the llMBFll ri of the Second Congrega- I
tion. and of-the Kev. John I'sborn-'s
.mgregation. and his feelings were j
carried so far into the proceedings as
to sanction a resolution that T. Clive :
Davies. delegate to the Episcppal con
vention at San Francisco, from the
Second Congregation, be forced to di
vulge the names of the signers of the
menu-rial" to the convention, as well
as the amounts they subscribed to as
sist in defraying the yearly stipend
f the new American bishop. It was
stated on the tloor. and by the bishop,
personally, that these signers, to him
unknown, had guaranteed to meet half
the expense o the new bishop's sala
ry for Ave years, and he intimated that
he placed no faith in the report. Also
that the presiding bishop and members
of the convention had been imposed
upon by this memorial jnd the claim
of guarantee. Mr. Davies at first re-
fused to speak upon the subject, ex-
. pt in case he be brought before the
bar of the house as a pr'soner. Syn-

said that Mr. Davies was amenable to

ASH1NGTON. December 2
Opinions were rendered in the
Supreme C.urt today in the last
two of the insular cases. One of them
was that known as the "Fourteen Dia
mond King Case." involving the rela
tionship of the I'nited States to the
Philippines from a tariff point of view,
and the other what is known as the
Dooley case No. 2, involving the consti
tutionality of the collection of duty on
goods shipped from New York to Porto
Rico.
In the former case the court, through
Chief Justice Fuller, held that the dia
mond rings brought in from the Phil
ippines, and over which the case arose,
should have been exempt from duty un
der the Paris treaty of peace, as that
treaty made the Philippines American
territory. The decision in the Philip
pine case followed closely that of the
first Porto Rican ease in the last term.
In the Dooley case de ided today it
was held that the duty collected on
goods carried from New York to Porto
Rico was permissible, but that it was
in reality a tax for the benefit of the
Porto Ricans themselves, rather than
an export duty, as was claimed by the

I The decisions were rendered in the
room of the Senate Committee on Ju- j

porarily. and owing to the limited space '
there were comparatively few persons, 1

livery of the opinions in chief, with the
reading of the dissenting opinions, con
sumed a little more than an hour, and
were listened to with the closest at
tention. '
i It is generaly believed that the find
ing in the Philippine case will lead to
early efforts to secure legislation for
the regulation of our commercial rela-
tions with Close Islands. As the Port-.

tionality of the Foraker act. no sucn
necessity will aris.- with reference to
Porto Rico.
Justices Gniy. White, Shiras and

Court's opinion in the Philippine case,
but they filed no written statement be- j

that they "dissented for the reasons

ROOSEVELT'S FIRST
WORD TO CONGRESS
In Hawaii our aim must be to
develop the Territory on the tradi
tional American lines. We do not
wish a region of large estates tilled
by cheap labor; we wbh a healthy
American community of men, who
themselves till the farms they own.
All our legislation for the islands
should be shaped with this end in
view; the well -being of the average
home-maker must afford the true
test of the healthy development of
the islands. The land policy should,
as nearly as possible, be modeled
on our homestead system.

Declares for Reciprocity With Spe
cial Advantages to Cuba, the
Cable and the Canal.
WASHINGTON. D. C. Dec. 3. There was a lull gathering of Senators
and members of the House today for the purpose of hearing the mes
sage of the President. Despite the cold and penetrating rain there
was a great attendance in the galieries. and the interest was intense. When
the committee which had waited upor. the President reported that he would
send the message they were followed in a minute by Major Pruden, who re
ported the message.
There was no demon? trat'.on in the Senate, but in the House whan th''
passages referring to anarchists were read there was applause, and when the
declaration in favor of the Chinese exclusion law was heard there was much
applause from both sides of the chamber. There was a continual show f
interest, and while ordinarily there :.- a small attendance and little Interest,
there were few members who left their seats, but all followed the reading
from printed copies.
Among the most important declarations are those in favor of reciprocity
and the giving to Cuba of all possible advantages: for the cable and the
canal; for the re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion law, and most strongly
in favor of the Monroe doctrine and the increase of the navy. The inesHau -in
part is as follows:
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatlvas: The Congress assembles this
year Under the sli;ilow of a great calam
ity. On the 6th of Sc-pteinber President
McKlnley was shot by an anarchist while
attending the I'.in-Americun Exposition
at Buffalo, and died in that city on tin
14th of that month.
Of the last seven elected presidents he
is the third who has been murdered, ami
the bare recital of this fact is sufficient
to justify grave alarm among all loyal
Aincrcan citizens. Moreover, the circum
stances of this, the third, assassination
of an American president, have a pecu
liarly sinister significance. IJoth Presi
dent Lincoln and President Garneld were
killed by assassins of types un ortunately
not uncommon In history; President Lin
coln falling a victim to the terrible pas
sjons caused by four years of civil war,
and President CSarfield to the revengeftd
vanity of a disappointed office seeker.
1'resident McKinley was killed by an ut
tf rly depraved criminal belonging to that
body of criminals who object to all gov
ernments, good and bad alike, who are
against any form of popular liberty if it
Is guaranteed by even th; most just and
liberal laws, and who are as hostile to
the upright exponent of a free people's
sober will as to the tyrannical and irre
sponsible despot.
It is not too much to say that at the
time of President McKinley's death he
was the most widely loved man in all
the United States; while we have never
had any public man in his position who
has been so wholly free from tie- b.'tter
animosities incident to. public life. His
political opponents srere the first to bear
the heartiest and most generous tribute
to the broad kindliness of nature, the
sweetness and gentleness of character
which so endeared him to his close asso
ciates. To a standard of lofty integrity
in public li.e, he united the tender affec
tions and home, virtues which are all
Important in the make-up of m national
character. A gallant soldier in the great
war for the Cnlon. he also shone as an
example to ail our people In cause of his
conduct In the most sacred and intimate
of home relations. There could be no
personal hatred of him. for he never
acted with aught but consideration for
tile welfare of others. No one could fall
to respect him who knew him in public
and private lite. The defenders of those
mu derous criminals who seek to excuse
their criminality by asserting that It is
exercised for political ends inveigh
against wealth and Irresponsible power.
Put for this assassination even those
base apologies cannot be urged.
President lioosevelt then devotes much
space to his eulogy upon the dead pres
ident and to reflections upon anarchy
and anarchists. iayl:ij In one place:
When we turn from the man to the
nation, the harm done is so j?rear as to
excTte our gravest apprehension-) and to
demand our wisest and most resolute ac
tion. This criminal was a profess.; d an
archist, inflamed by the teachings of pro
fessed anarchists, and probably also by
reckless utterances of those who. on the
stump and in the public press, appeal to
tb.- dark and evil spirits of malice and
greed, envy and sullen hatred. The wind
Is sowed by the men who preached such
doctrines and they cannot escape thrir
share of responsibility for the whirlwin I
that is reaped. This applies alike to the
deliberate demagogue, to the exploiter
of sensationalism and the the crude and
foolish visionary, who. for whatever rea
son, apologizes for crime or excites aim
less discontent.
After further comment, this recom
mendation Is made:
I earnestly recommend to the Con
gress that In the exercise of Its wise dis
cretion it should 'akc into consideration

the coming to this country of anarch. sts
or persons professing principles hostile
to all government and justifying the
murder of those placed in authority.
Such individuals as those who not long
ago gathered In open meetings to glorify
i ho murder of King Humbert of Italy
perpetrate a crime, arid the law should
insure their vigorous punl.-hment . Tliey
and those like them should be kept out
of this country; and ir found here they
should be promptly deported to the coun

thought of the Congress.

in line of succession for the pre-ldeticy,
while the punishment for an unsuccess
ful attempt should be proportioned to tbo
enormity of the offense h gain Ml our In
stitutions. Turning to the condition of the country
at large, the president says business con
fidence has been restored and the nation
i to be congratulated upon Its present
abounding prosperity. He comments up
on the greater growth of cities than the
country, and upon the growth of for
tunes as well, saying that the creation
of the gr.at Corporate fortunes is not
due to the tariff, nor to any government
al action, but to natural causes In the
business world. He comments too upon
the fact that the rich have not rown
richer at the expense of the poor, for the
wacr earner was never .n better condi
tion that at the present time. As to
dealing with corporations he says tho
personal equation is the most important
factor in a business operation. Snd that
the business, ability of the man at the
head of a concern fixes the gulf between
success and failure. He points out the
fact that similar conditions as to cor
porations exist iti all other countries, and
that t" strike at the Interests of one Bel
of men endangers those of all others.
He compares the lean years of IMS, be
ginning in im:!, with the peril i of pjeutj
now existing, and says it is better to
iii.ik" no laws than to enact inconsiderate
legislation, saying the laws of the past
against trusts would have been mis
chievous had they not been Ineffective.
After further comment along these lines,
he says:
All this is true; and yet It is also true
that there are real and grave effls, one
of the chief Win over-capitalization, lie
cause of its many baneful consequences:
and a resolute arid practical effort must
be made to correct these evils.
There is a wldespreatl conviction In the
minds of the American eople that tho
great eorporations known as trusts are
in certain of their features and tenden
cies hurtful to the general public. This
is based upon sincere conviction that
