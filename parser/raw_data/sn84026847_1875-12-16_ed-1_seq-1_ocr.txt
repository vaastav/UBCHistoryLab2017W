Editors of Hit- Register:
1 desire to inform all who are una' 1
quainted with the fact and especially
physicians, that the health ordinance re.
| quires every case of small-pox or varioloid
to be reported to the Health Officer, by
the attending physician, if there be one;
otherwise by the bead of the family ia
; which the case occurs. It this is not done
within twelve hours after the disease is
known to exist, aline of twenty dollars
and costs may bo imposed. This provision
of the law will be ouiorced in every
case that may arise, as it is very important
that every case ot small-pox
I or varioloid be early made known, that
measures to prevent tbe spread of the
disease may bo adopted. As yet, there
' is no cause for alarm, as only three cases
I exist in the city, one of small-pox and j
two ot varioloid, both the latter very |
mild. It is important for the people to
: know, however, that many of the cites .
I aiid towns with whi<h we are in daily I
, ' direct communication, have been lor j
I weeks, infected with this disease. Any
citizen is in constant danger of contract- ,
' ing it, unless well protected by vaccina- f
tion, bv meeting in the street, or in some ^
public gathering, a uersoii who may have ;
came from an infected town; possibly a
I j convalescent, whose person or clothing '
II has not been properly cleaned and freed |
1 from the poison. The origin of two of
' the cases abovo referred to cannot at all >
be traced. This shows the importance!
of h tli.iroiiirh nrotection. which can !
easily, quii kly and surely bo hud by vac? i- j
nation and re vuicinaii >n. If wo p<-r>i?t '
i in neglecting this, wo have none but ?ur- I
j selves to blriuc if oijr city is visited with
a sm&il-pox epidemic. This 1 do not up- 1
preliend at present, but I urn sun we w ill
' not havo anything of thu kind if the {
head of every family does his or her '
j duty in looking after tho private welfare
of thu household. And 1 venture tile
-uggestion that mill owners, nn*l others
I having control of large numbers ot men,
i should insist on the rovaccination of every
one in their employ. It is not enough
that these men and others were vaccinated
in childhood. This often fails to
protect the adult. A successful vaccination
now will thoroughly protect.

menccd a raid upon the mighty army of
Government defaulters yesterday, by ol
1 fering a resolution calling upon the See- j
' retary of the Treasury to explain why |
t rio annual reports ot defaulters, and the
amuunt of their defalcations, had been
I made to Congress since 1hi?6. The Ko"
publicans showed tight, of course, as it
i ' will ho their funeral, and the resolution
, : was laid over until to-day. It may he
added that the Treasury, since 1801, has
' neglected the laws requiring the details
i of the receipts aid expenditures of the
. Department to be laid before Congress
( | every se.,-ion. This neglect was chiefly
j noticeable in Spinner's, Conant's and

The ('hiircti Taxation Scheme.
From the Boston Advertiser (Hep.)
Tho unexpected outbreak of the
I President's message on the taxation of
j Church property?although the General
{ Government could no more meddle with
that question than it could with sur.
pressing the insurrection in Herzegovina
? has t ailed attention to the amount of
property held by the different religious
denomination, in the Cnited States, ex
> einpt from taxation. This, according to
. [ the census of 1S70, was as lollows, tho
Methodists taking the lead:

That these figures are correct

The laws on this subject, made under

i in many of the States the attention of

problems of taxation has been turned to

I The resolution was then, on motion of j
j Mr. liolman, referral to tho Committee j
on Nanking niul Currency,
Kills were further introduced and n I
ferrud as follows:
By Mr. Starkweather -To amend the '
law relating to postago on mailahle mat- j
I ter of the third c lass. Providing that
from the 1st of January, 1870, postage on !

I -hall tw one ce11 tor every two ounce- or 1
' fraction thereof, and that postage on ail
other mailable matter shall remain as
now provided by law. He moved to
suspend the rules and pass the hill.
Mr. ltandnll suggested that the bill Ik?
first considered by the committee,
Mr. Starkweather remarked that the
hill only proposed to carry out the universal
desire of the people.
Sir. Ilandall?I am ijuito a- willing as
the gentleman from Connecticut to have
the postage on newspapers placed where
I it was hulore your side o! the House in|.creased
it.
} Mr. Stark weal her?Both sides of the <
j Houses.
1 Mr. Bandall?But the re aro other ob^ j
, w. VA., TIIURSD^
jections to this bill. The postage on packages
was increased in the interest of a
monopoly, and 1 wish that repealed also.
Mr. Starkweather?I am with the gentleman
in all retornis. The gentleman
says wo made a mistake last year. Ho
made some mistakes himself, and he's now
making a mistake in opposing this bill.
Air. Randall?I am not opposing it,
but 1 want the law of last session gone
over and reviewed by this side of the
House, and I want this bill put in proper
shape by the Committee so as to cure all
abuses in the legislation ot bust year.
Mr. Starkweather?This bill comes
from the Poslolliee Department.
Mr. Randall?1 am not quite certain
that the Postnftiee Department did not
assist iri that infamous legislation.
Mr. Starkweather?1 am quite certain
it did not.
Mr. La wren ce?Does not this bill restore
the law to what it was before it was
repealed?
sir. omrKweHunr?n u<n? as i<> transient
matter.
Mr. IvKiidalI made h point of order
that the motion to stispond tho rules and
pass the bill was not the order of tho day.
The Speaker sustained tin; point of
order
M r. Starkweather then moved the previous
question on the passage of the hill.
The House refused to second the previous
question by a vote of ti-'S to 128, and
the bill was tlien, cn motion of Mr. Kandall,
referred to the 1'estoltiee Committee.
"Bills and resolutions were further introduced
and referred as follows:
By Hewitt?Directing the Secretary
id' War to furnish a list of tlio claims
pending in the Quartermaster General's
Department at the time that leave of absence
was granted Quartermaster Goneral
Meigs, which have been since that
date passed or allowed, together with any
report or statement in regard thereto
made by General Meigs or by the Acting
Quartermaster General. Adopted.
l'ro|??si I loii In Iteiiiovr all I'ollllcal
Disabilities.
By Knndall?To remove all political
disabilities imposed and remaining on
any person by virtue of tho 38th section
of the llth article ot the amendments to
the Constitution, and relieving every
person therefrom; also providing that all
such persons, when elected or appointed
to any office under the I'liited .States,
shall take the modified oath, lie moved
the previous question hi its pas-age.
Mr. Blame expressed the opinion that
no onnosition would he made to the Dill
on the Republican Hide of the llou.se, b'lt
said that some members desired to submit
certain observations in regard to it. He
therefore asked the gentleman from
Pennsylvania on the general proprieties
of legislation, to allow a bill of this magnitude
to be referred, assuring him that
no factious pposition would he made to
having a lair vote upon it.
Mr. Garfield suggested that there was
something in the language of tne hill
which ought to be amended.
.Mr. Randall declined to act with undue
tiaste. The House at its last session
hail unanimously passed a similar loll,
on motion of Mr. .Maynard. He did not
suppose that on account of the political
conugia wiiicu me noose nail linnergolie
this hill would meet with any objection
ironi the Republican side of the House,
but it was enough for him to know that
discussion was desired. He suggested
that it ho made the special order for to.
morrow.
Mr. Blaine suggested that it ho postponed
until after the holidays.
Mr. Randall?I want the holidays to
be real and sincere, ami 1 want every
man to feel at that time that be is relieved
from all past political disabilities.
Mr. Blaine 1 ili.sliko very muen 10
say atiything that would deprive the
gentleman from the most joyous of holidays,
hut J think that lie has had very
many joyous ones since 1 have been,
with all theso gentlemen, under disabilities.
Mr. Randall?1 have enjoyed them
myself, hut some men have been deprived
of such enjoyment, and I want tin; coming
holidays to be a Centennial one in
fact and spirit.
Finally the bill was made the .special
order for next Tuesday.
By .Mr. Vanco?To repeal the acts of
March 2, 1 tS??7 and February-1, 1802, prohibiting
the payments to persons not
known to be opposed to the rebellionHo
moved the previous <jue?tion on its
passage.
Mr. llolman suggested that the bill
should ho referred to a committee, as it
was very general in its provisions.
M r. Vance/replied that a like bill in substance
had passed the House several
times; particularly in regard to the pensionecrs
of the war of 1812.
Mr. Holman said that the act only
concerned persons on the pension rolls
while the bill proposed went far beyond
that. IF- didn't think it safe to legislate
on such a measure without due consideration.
The hill was thereupon referred.
Tax OH Tolmcco,
By Bobbins-?A resolution stating that
tobacco is liable to derangement by reason
of the uncertainty in regard to legislation
concerning tile tax on tobacco, and
that it is desirable to <piiet all apprehensions
on the subject, and declaring that it
is the purpose of the House to allow no
modifications of the present tax on tobacco
to go into effect before the first of
luly, IST'i. He moved the previous
'picslioti on its adoption.
The House refused to second the previous
nimet.inii and the resolution Was re
forred to the Committee of Way* mid
Means.
Several other hills were introduced anii
referred, among others "tie by Mr. Lawrence,
of Ohio, declaring tliat it is the
sense of the House that the policy of
finance shall be strictly pursued which,
without unnecessary check to business,
will ultimately equalize the purchasing
power of the gold and paper dollar. He
remarked that the resolution embodied,
in subslaaco the principle.-! put forth in
the la-t Republican platform of Ohio.
He moved its adoption.
Mr. Holmun moved its reference to the
Committee on Hanking and Currency,
and it was referred.

Mr. Holman ottered tne following resolution:

House, in the present condition of the
financial allairs of the government, no
subsidies of money, bonds or public lands,
endorsement, or pledge ol the public
credit should be granted by Congress to
associations or corporations engaged or
proposing to engage in public or private
enterprise, ami that all appropriations
troni the public treasury at tins time
ought to be limited to such an
amount only as shall be demanded bv
the public service. He moved the previous
question on its adoption.
Mr. Hoar inquired whether the resolution
was intended to cut otr the appro
prialion for the Centi nnial.
Mr. Holman replied that it was net so
it-t-nded and that he Jid not suppose it
would have that effect, though be himself
was willing it should be so construed.
The previous question was seconded and

Office of the Wheeling register. 1
Wednesday, Dec. 15, 1876. /
The general condition of trade during
j ihe past week has been moderately fair.
! In lighter goods, such as toys, eonfeotionaries,
Ac., business has been real brisk,
though there is not the life in the trade
nor the liberality in the purchases by
retail dealers that has characterized !
past years. In this, as in all other I
I branches of business, the disposstion is I
I manifested to buy cautiously and econo- I
| micnlly, and not be caught when the seaj
son over, with a large surplus stock on
| haad which must holdover till next year
Flour is slow at quotations, yet quite
firm.
Little wheat is c .tiling in Ht present. '
The reason Resigned is that holders think j
there will be n further advance.
Provisions aro quiet, with no change t
in figures. Hogs are only in moderate '
demand at present. Messrs. List, l)aven'
port and Parks informed us that they 1
did not think they would kill any more !
this month.
Codecs are very firm and a shade
higher, though no change has boon made
in our quotations. This stillness is
stimulated, no doubt, by the proposition
in the Presidents message to Congress to
[ increase the tax thereon.
In wool tlii! demand is good for choice
wools, hut there is little ottering. I'nI
conditioned grades of wools have very
slow sales.
There is a good demand for all kinds
! of produce, and no doubt it will continue
until aft:r New Years.
Furs?As the season for furs is about
opening, we append the "(dotations. As }
yet there is but little demand, Lnt with j
the lirst good snow, trade will fairly open- |

The demand was very light,
Hous -The arrivals were dUO head

There has been a very large supply ot
hogs, and the market was overstocked.
Just before the cold snap some dealerhad
their stock here nearly a week, and
then drove them otf without
offering. To-day the market wa*
very quiet, and with the indication* of
more moderate weather, it has a droop,
ing tendency.
Sheet?None have heen offered. At
this season of the year, the demand is
very light, in fact hardly sufficient to establish
quotations. It will likely continue
thus until near spring.
