Gilman and Cavanaugh Considered
Most Likely of Candidates.
The two most likely men for the pev

are Joseph T. Oilman and Frank W.
Cavnnaiiirh. The athlic coiuacil bas
considered several candidates, but it is
Ix lieved that the job will go to Oil
man or Cavanaugh, chances favoring
the former. Gilman was voted guard
ou the "All Eastern" eleven ia 1903 and
1('04 by several experts. His football
training was under Walter McCornaek
at both Exeter and Dartmouth. Oilman
bas assisted in Dartmouth's coaching
for the pat two or three seasons. Cav
anaugh was an end on the Hanover

too. He bas siiwss-fully coached west
ern elevens and has alto done evcellent
work with Holy Cross and Wesleyon

to the latter and would probably be
unable to accept the posietion at Part

fare like the other passengers and then
stepped into the motorman's vestibule,
introducing himself to Motorman Miller.
Miller offered to give tip his stool to the
millionaire, but Mr. Rockefeller told hira
he did not need it.
"I'd like to 1 able to run this ear as
ymi are doing," said Mr. Rockefeller to
Miller.
"You can have my job any time you
wish it," replied the motorman cheer-fullr.
Millionaire and motorman talked near
ly all the way to Fifty-fifth street, where
Mr. Rockefeller came inside the car and
sat down. Mr. Rockefeller dropped into
philosophy, and when the motorman in
terjected a remark about the qualities of
sucoess, the oil man said:
"Sucecsi is simply doing something
better than anyone else has been able to
do it." , ,
