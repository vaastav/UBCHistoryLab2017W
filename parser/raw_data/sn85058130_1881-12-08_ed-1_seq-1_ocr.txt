ton special says Despite many rumors
which have been circulated of late con
cerning changes in the cabinet it may be
ffutnofitutiveiy s ated that the only
change contemplated at present will be
the nomination of a secretary of state
When a change is made in the attorney
generalship which however will not be
for some time yet Brewster will receive
the nomination
The first party contest it is believed
will occur in Congress over the admission
of Campbell or Cannon contesting Utah
delegates Democratic leaders claim
that the certificate by using the words
being a citizen implies that the Gov
ernor of Utah has recognized the fact
that some one else not a citizen received
more votes than Campbell ahd that is
without the jurisdiction of the Governor
but is a matter for the committee on elec
tions to decide There are a number of
democrats particularly Chalmers who
were sworn in on prima facie evidence
embodied in the possession of a certifi
cate and these men are particularly
anxious that Campbell should be
seated on the same showing They will
probably however be overruled by their
party The republicans take the same
ground and will claim that the precedent
set in cases of contested democratic
seats should be followed in this Camp
bell though democrat will receive the
solid support of republicans as the first
gun in the battle against polygamy
Cannon will receive the democratic sup
port because the Mormons have made
common cause with democrats in their
fight for supremacy on the Pacific Coast
The battle will be a hot one

THE GUITTEAU TRIAL
i
Washington 1The criminal court
WAS densely crowded this morning
Among the audience were General Sher
man and Rev DeWitt Talmage Today
the prosecution commenced in rebuttal
They will retraverse the ground gone
over by the defense and favor the stand
point of the prosecution will thoroughly
ventilate Guitteaua past life and habits
beginning with his early life in Freeport
and concluding with a vast amount of
the best expert testimony attainable in
the country As soon as the court was
formally opened Guitteau addressed the
court in a rather imperious tone thus
May it please your honor the American
people do not desire that this case should
be tried again and I do not desire it I
say with the utmost respect to this court
and jury and my counsel Scoville that
I am not satisfied with the political situ
ation as developed here in this case That
is the gist of this alleged offence The
President of the United States would
never have been shot if it had not
been for the political situation which
existed last May and June and I say I
have the right as a matter of law of ap
pearing as my own counsel I ask your I
honor that General Grant Senators i
Conkling and Platt and President Ar
thur and those kind of men who were
180 down upon Garfield they would not
speak to him on the street and would
not go to the White House shall be put
on the stand I have the right to show
my personal relations to those gentlemen
that I was cordially received by them
and that I was well dressed and well fed
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel I want to
show my personal relations to those men
I dont want to except to your honors
ruling but I shall be obliged to do so
and I have no doubt the court in bane
will give me a new trial
Judge CoxYour exception has been
noted
Scoville then called up the subject of
President Arthurs testimony and said
ha had not yet received any response to
his interrogatories that the Presidents
evidence was absolutely essential to the
defense
Guitteau interrupted him excitedly
with I dont think it at all necessary
for General Arthur to be here To Sco
ville I dont caro what you want Im
doing this myself I ask as a personal
favor that he shant be dragged into court
I think a goad deal of General Arthur
and he is President of the United States
and I dont think he should be bothered
with this matter striking the desk vio
lently He is President of the United
States and I made him so and I think
I should have something to say in this
matter
It was agreed between the counsel that
the Presidents answers should be i > ut
in as evidence nt any stage of the trial
and Scoville called GenerAl Sherman
The witness simply read the orders he
had issued for the disposition of troops ut
tho time of the assassination Ho identi
fied a letter written by Guitteau and
said he supposed all the time there might
be a conspiracy but afterwards con
cluded that the shooting was the act of
one man n as he left the stand Guitteau
baid 1 thank you general lor hav
ing ordered out those troops
that day If it hadnt been for you I
should not be here today I owe my
life to the protection which you and Gen
oral Crocker gave me during that pe
riod when the riot spirit was rife At
this the general smiled grimly
Edward H Barton a lawyer A Ti
Green and GW Tandie all of Freeport
Illinois testified that they knew the
Guitteau family and considered them all
sane Dr B P Buckley of Freeport testi
fied that he was Guitteaus family doc
tor Ee never saw any indications of
the slightest mental derangement in him
nor in Abraham Guitteau
Mr Atkinson of the Freeport Repub
lican confirmed the testimony of pre
vious witnesses as to the sanity of the
Guitteau family
