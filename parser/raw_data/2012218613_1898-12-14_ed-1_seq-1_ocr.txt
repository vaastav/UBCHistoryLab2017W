President McKinley's Message in
a Nutshell.
w
A VERY MILD DOCUMENT.
r _____
It is More Remarkable for What
L -- - - . - ?.
Does Not Contain i nan
For What it Doss.
President McKinley's second annual
message, which was submitted to Congress
on Tuesday of last week, contained
something like twenty thousand
words. The message may be summed
up as follows:
It is a history of tht war; it is a fervent
expression of thanks to a Divine
f power for the success of American
arms; it is an expression of a nation's
appreciation for the Heroism and patriotism
displayed in battle; it urges an
increase of the regular army to 100,000
r' "men; it reviews our relations with the
^ nations of the world; it reiterates Republican
policy as to the financial question;
it does not discuss the Philippine
problem;jit-does not discuss legislation
for the new Possessions; it does not discuss
the race troubles; it does not dis
cuss the tariff.
Following is a brief synopsis, including
some direct excerpts of the more
important features of the message:
"Notwithstanding the added burdens
rendered necessary by the war, our people
rejoice in a very satisfactory and
steadily increasing degree of prosperity
evidenced by the largest volume of business
ever recorded. Manufacture has
been productive, agricultural pursuits
have yielded abundant returns, labor in
4 all fields cf industry is better rewarded,"
etc.
CONTROVERSY WHICH LED TO THE WAR,
In reviewing the controversy which
led up to the war with Spain, the president
takes up the thread of narrative
where terminated in his last annual
message. He concluded: "It washon*
estly due to our friendly relations with
Spain that she should be given a reasonable
chance to realize her expecta*
- - ^ 1 7
tions of reform to -winch sue naa Deeome
irrevocably committed." It be ,->>
came evident, however, that the proposed
plans wera barren of good ref
suits. No tangible relief was afforded
the reconcentrados. among whom the
rate of mortality frightfully increased;
the proffered expedient of zones of cultivation
proved illusory, and it was apparent
that nothing save the physical
^ -exhaustion of Spain or the Cubans and
the practical ruin of the island of Cuba
could result from the struggle then in
progress.
At this critical juncture the destrucPtion
of the battleship Maine occurred.
43oncerniug it the president says:
^t is * striking evidence of the poise
?^nd sturdy good sense distinguishing
0% national character that shocking
fewatfalling upon a generous people,
Sr . ASPdeeply touched by preceding
Events in Cuba, did not move them to
tjg.'/ -an instant, desperate resolve to tolerate
r>/\ !/vr?tr<vr t.Kft existence of a condition
*v-0 f
of danger and disorder at our doors that
made possible such a deed, by whomsoever
wrought."
Still animated, however, by the hope
of a peaceful solution of the diffif
culty and obeying the dictates of
duty, the president relaxed no effort to
bring about a speedy ending of the Cuban
struggle. Negotiations with the
Madrid government proved futile, so
far as practical results were concerned,
. and then it was the president presented
the question to congress.
The result of this statement of the
' case was the adoption of the memorable
joint resolution by congress, declaring
the purpose of the United States to
intervene between the Spaniards and
Cubans. Following swiftly upon the.
enactment of the resolution came the
severance of diplomatic relations be'
tween the two countries, the proclamation
of a blockade of Cuban ports, the
call for volunteers and the formal declaration
of the existence of a state of
war. All other governments were immediately
notified of the existence of
war and each proclaimed neutrally. "It
? is not. among mc xecist grautijiug iutidents
of the struggle that the obligations
of neutrality were impartially
discharged by all, often under delicate
and difficult circumstances."
Referring to the "difficult and important
character" of the work perfonn~X<ed
by the signal corps, the president
says: "This service was invaluable to
the executive in directing the operation
of the army and with a total force of
1,300 the loss was by disease, in camp
i and field, officers and men included,
only five."
L As to the authorized loan of $200,000,000
which was taken entirely i?y
small bidders, the president says:
"This was a most encouraging and
( significant result, showing the vast resources
of the nation and the determination
of the people to uphold their
?|p"' country's honor."
THE STIRRING EVENTS OF THE "WAR.
? - - % 1 It .1
Taking up chronologically tnc events
.of the war, the president reviews them
f carefully. The first encounter was the
.lulling of Matanzas on April 27th.
was followed by an engagement
wach was "destined to mark a memorable
epoch in maritime warfare." This
was Commodore Dewey's wonderful victory
at Manilla on May 1. '"The effect
of this remarkable victory," says the
president, "upon the spirit of our people
and upon the fortunes of the war
was instant. A prestige of invincibili/?
ty thereby attached to our arms, which
continued throughout the struggle."
The president s'ays that "only reluctance
to cause needless loss of life and
I property prevented the early storming
ft and capture of the city ^'Manila.) and
B therewith the absolute uilitary occup
pancy of the whole group." Following j
it. L-ixi._v.-_
me memorauie trip ui tue osiuesmu
Oregon from San Francisco to Key
West and the bombardment of San Juan
j and forts of Santiago, to which special
reference is made, the president says:
. "The next act in the war thrilled
not alone the hearts of our countrymen
'i>ut the world by its exceptional heroism.
On the night of June 3d, Lieutenant
Hobson. aided by seven uevoted
-volunteers blocked the narrow outlet
from Santiago harbor by sinking the
collier Merrimac in the channel, under
a fierce fire from the shore batteries,
escaping with their lives as by a miracle,
but falling into the hands of the
Spaniards. It is a most gratifying incident
of the war that the bravery of
this little band of heroes was cordially
appreciated by the Spanish admiral."
The campain of Santiago, resulting
in the investment and capture of that
city is referred to as a brilliant achievement
A brief review is then presented
of the decisive naval combat of the
war on July 3d, resulting in the complete
destruction of Admiral Cervera's
fleet. Concerning it the president
says:
"Where all so conspicuously distinguished
themselves from the commanders
to the gunners and the unnamed
heroes in the boiler rooms, each and all
contributing toward the achievement of
this astounding victory, for which
neither ancient nor modern history af
" ? * i 1 _ i.
fords a parallel m tne compieueue&s ux
the event and the marvelous dispropor- !
tion of casualties, it would be invidious
to single out any for a special I
honor." j
As to the success gained by the arms
of the United States in Cuba, the president
says that the earnest, lasting
gratitude of the nation is unsparingly
due. "Nor should we alone remember
the gallantry of the living. The dead
claim our tears, and our losses by battle
and by disease must cloud aoy exultation
as the result and teach us the
awful cost of war, however-rightful the
cause or signal the victory."
TOTAL CASUALTIES DUKING THE WAR.
''The total casualties in the army
during the war with Spain -were:
"Officers killed 23, enlisted men
killed 257, total 280. Officers wounded
113. enlisted men wounded 1,464, total
1,577.
Of the navy: Killed 17, wounded 67,
died as result of wounds 1. Invalided
from service 6. Total 91.
"In the entire campaign by lana ana
sea we did not lose a gun or a flag or a
transport or a ship, and with the exception
of the crew of the Merrimac, not a
soldier or sailor was taken prisoner."
The president bears testimony and
pays fitting tribute "to the patriotism
and devotion of that large portion of
our army which, although eager to be
ordered to the post of greatest exposure,
fortunately was not required outside
of the United States." The President
says: "In tracing these events we
are constantly reminded of our obligations
to the Divine Master for His
watchful care over us, and His safe
guidance, for which the nation makes
reverent acknowledgement and offers
humble prayer for the continuance of ,
His favors."
Referring to the work of the peace i
commission in Paris, the president
says: "
'Their negotiations have made hopeful
progress, so that I trust soon to be
able to lay a definite , treaty of peace before
the senate with a review of the
3teps leading to its signature.
"I do not discuss at this time the
government nor the future of the new

the result of tie war with Spain. Such J
discussion will be appropriate after the
treaty of peace shall be ratified. In the
mean time and until the congress has
legislated otherwise, it will be my duty
to continue the military governments
which have existed since our occupation
and give to the people security in
life and property and encouragement
under a just and beneficent rule."
As to the future of Cuba he says:
'"As soon as we are in possession of j
Cuba and have pacified the island it will
be necessary to give aid and direction
to its people to form a government for
themselves. This should be undertaken
at the earliest possible moment
consistent with safety and assured success."
The president says that with the one
exception of the rupture with Spain,
the intercourse of the United States

the past year has been marked with cordiality.
p.
NICARAGUA^ CANAL REPORT IS READY.
The president expects that the Nicaraguan
canal commission will shortly
be able to report finally. "1 have not
hesitated to express my convictions,"
says the president, "that considerations
of expediency and international policy
as between the several governments interested
in the constriction and
control of an inter-oceanie canal
by this route require the maintenance
of the status quo until the canal
commission shall have reported and the
United States congress shall have had
the opportunity to pass finally upon the
whole matter." He regarded, in
view of our newly acquired interests in
the Pacific ocean, the construction of
A *o r?fttrr mATfl

than ever indispensable.
Concerning the extraordinary events
transpiring in the Chinese empire, the
and its expenditures $689,874,647,
praident says that our position among
nations gives the equitable claim to
consideration and friendly treatment in
this regard, and that it will be his aim
to subserve our large interests in the
Orient by all means appropriate to the
constant policy of our government.
The president reports that the Hawaiian
commission has fulfilled :.ts mission,
and that its report will be laid before
congress at an early day.
Referring to the proposal of the czar
of Russia for a general reduction of the
great military establishments, the president
says: l'His majesty was at once
informed of the cordial sympathy of
this government with the principle in;
volved in his exalted proposal and of
the readiness of the United States to
take Dart in the conference."
Alluding to the financial affairs of
| the country, the president says in part:
The secretary of the treasury reports
that the receipts of the government
from all sources during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1898, including $64.751,223
received from sale of Pacific
railroad, amounted to $405,321,335. and
its expenditures to $443,36S,582.
It is estimated upon the basis of pres
ent revenue laws that the receipts of
the government for the year ending
June 30th, 1899, will be $557,874,647,
resulting in a deficiency of $112,000,000.
GOLD FOR REDEEMING GREENBACKS.
t:In my judgment the present conditions
of the treasury amply justify the
immediate enactment of the legislation
recommended one year ago, under
which a portion of the gold holdings
should be placed in a trust fund from
which greenbacks should be redeemed
TW-otanfofinn VvTlf TpVlOTV TO

deemed should not thereafter be paid
out except for gold. It is not to be inferred
that other legislation relating to
our currency is not required; on H
contrary there is an obvious demand for
it."
The recommendation made by the
secretary of war fcr the increase of the
regular military establishment has the
president's unqualified approval. He
says he will muster out the entire volunteer
army as soon as congress shall
provide for the increase of the regular
establishment.
No mention is made in the message
of legislation for the new possessions.
No specific mention is made of the
Philippine problem.
Tariff is not mentioned. The recent
race troubles in South and North Carolina
are not mentioned.
CUBANS DISREGARD ORDERS.
They Go Through a Street in Santiago
Bearing Arms.
Last Wednesday .was the anniversary
of the death of Gen. Antanio Maceo
and it was celebrated among the Cubans
in Santiago. A memorial service
was held in the morning in the cathedral,
which was crowded.
Considerable annoyance was occasioned
to the United States authorities by
the fact that some 75 men, Cubans
marched the entire length of St Thomas
street, armed with rifles and machetes,
although all Cubans are well aware that
such conduct is strictly against the
i . j t- . J:-~ 4.1?
regulations, armeu ouuies uuiei wau
United States troops not being allowed.
The offenders in question did not ask
permission to march armed, and their
intention was not made known' to the
American authorities. Indeed, the cathedral
had been reached by the paraders
before the fact was reported to headquarters.
Col. Beacon, w'ao is chief in com
mand here during the absence of breu.
Wood, immediately called upon the
mayor regarding t'ae affair, and was by
him referred to Col. Garcia, who sent
an orderly di esting the appearand
of the offenders at headquarters. Meanj
while the armed squad had fired three
volleys, many using ball cartridges,
which Dullets striking the upper portions
of the cathedral, caused the bell
ringers to flee from their post.
In less than a quarter of an hour an
officer from the Fi:th immune regiment
arrived at headquarters with a message
from Col. Sergeant, stating that several
bullets has struck his tent at different
points, and asking information as to
the cause.
Col. Beacon ordered Col. Garcia not
to allow his men to attend the evening
procession armed. The sole reason why
the offenders were not arrested was that
they were within the cathedral limits
at the time.
A band of Cubans on horseback entered
the premises of the Spanish clubhouse
this evening and broke several
lamps with their machetes.
The United States -authorites -acted
promptly. As a result of the outrage
at least half the police force will be
discharged.
ACTUALLY BLOWN TO ATOMS"Mot>
wbn Were Hani ins* a Govern
ment Mine. Cause Unknown.
Fonr men were killed and seven seriouly
injured at Fort Independence, on
Castle island, in Boston harbor Wednesday
afternoon by explosion of a
mine which had been removed from the
channel by a diver. The dead:
Sergt. Morris McGiath.
Hiram Vaughn.
Private Brennan (a diver).
Ryan (a citizen).
Vaughn, Brennan and Ryan had
placed the mine on a team and started
to take it to the place where the other
ammunition was stored. The road
along which they passed was unusually,
smooth, having been constructed with a
view to the necessity of care in transporting
explosive material. Without
- "* * . mi l 5
warning tJie mine Durst, xne norse anu
cart and the tliree men were blown to
fragments. Sergt. McGrath was standing
fully 20 feet away. He was instantly
killed by the concussion. His body
does not bear a mark of any sort. As
soon as possible after the explosion a
careful search was begun by Lieut.
Raymond, who had charge of removing
the mines, but not a fragment of men
or clothing could be found. Lieut.
Raymond states that he cannot explain
how the explosion occurred. He says
that since the order was issued from
Washington hundred of mines have
been handled in precisely the same way
as was this one and transported over
the same road.
Ryan was a civilian assisting in the
frork, Vaughn was a member of the engineer
corps. He had only two weeks
more to serve when he expected to be
transfered to a naval college to take a
course in naval construction.
Sergt. McGrath was the keeper of the
island.
The Very Best Plan.
Gen. Miles's plan of reorganization
for the United States army is founded
on very excellent precedent. The plan
is similar, says Gen. Miles in his report,
to that which was found so effective
in the Confederate army. This
recoenition of the excellence of'the Con- j
federate army is quite remarkable, coming
from Gen. Miles, and it will be a
very bitter dose to the G. A. R. and the
old bloody shirt howlers to have the
"rebel" armies thus officially glorified.
But the tribute could not be withheld.
It was necessary to organize the United
States army on a proper basis, and the
best model obtainable was necessarily
that made by Robert E. Lee, the greatest
captain that America has produced.
?Charleston Post.
Corn Wanted.
The State Department at Washington
has received a special report from

were the other members of the faculty.
The institution has two departments,
the preparatory and collegiate. There
are four instructors in the preparatory

between them and the president is
most cordial and genial. The number
is 170, which is above the average for
the last ten years. The financial income
annually is $11,960. The need
of the University is more money, more
I endowment to meet all expenses with
j the income without having to draw on
| invested funds. At present there is a
! deficit of from $900 to $1 000 annually.
I The main building needs to be repairI
ed. a gymnasium and a library are
needed. The beginning ana tne completion

collection for Furman University, and
the force and power of I)r. Montague's
words were shown by immediate results.

affairs relating to the orphange, and
to make a report which should be a
positive settlement of all orphanage
tmnblfls. Revs. R. W. Sanders and R.
W. Lide and Mr. J. W. Shelorspoke to
the resolutions, and Revs. 0. L. Martin
and C. T. Scalfe spoke against their
adoption.
The speeches were earnest and impressive.
Christian spirit was clearly
manifest and there was no exception
to this, though the interest was ab
sorbing. The recent newspaper controversies
on this subject were absolutely
condemned, aud uo one spoke in
their defence. The question was finally
called aad a division was necessary.
When the vote was at last counted the
resolutions were tabled by a vote of 74
to 79, many members net voting.
The special orders was taken, and the

that we believe Bro. Yass to have been

The test vote finally was upon the
resolutions offered by C. T. Scaife.
which were adopted os follows:
Whereas, the election of a superintendent
of the Connie Maxwell Orphanage
has for two years caused

Resolved, That the election of a superintendent
be taken away from the
beard of trustees and be restored to the
convention.
Second. That we proceed at once, by
nomination and ballot, in open Convention,
to elect a superintendent,
whose term of office shall begin with
the annual meeting of this board in

in 1900.
Third. That his successor shall be

Fourth. That in case of resignation
or death the board shall have power to
fill the vacancy until the succeeding

At half-past 11 o'clock, after two and

Orphanage, under the provisions
of this resolution. Several seconds to
this nomination were at once heard.
Equally prompt was a protest from the
minority, who had no candidate ready.
A peace and unity brother was willing
to proceed and the majority were also
of generous spirit. The resolution provided
for an election, however, and this
after some confused and obscure discussion
was entered upon. Mr. Yass being
the only candidate, it was ordered that
"yes'' or "no" should be written on the
ballots. This was done, voting was
proceeded with and the tellers announced
that of 136 votes cast 89 were
for and 47 against the election of the
Rev. J. L. Vass as superintendent of
Connie Maxwell Orphanage. After the
announcement of the vote the resignations
of W. L. Durst, F. 0. S. Curtis
and John R. Leavell, Jr., as trustees
of Connie Maxwell Orphanage were

Jealousy Led to Murder.
A duiible murder was committed
\ /ednesday in a country church two
miles out from Missouri City, Mo. Miss
Delia Cleveng< i was shot down mortally
wounded and her escort to the meeting
house, George Allen, was instantly
killed. The murderer was Ernest Clevenger,
couis to the young woman who
was one of hi? victims. The tragedy
occurred immediately ^fter the congregation
had been dismissed, as the worshippers
were leaving the church.
YouDg Allen and Miss Clevenger were
walking out together. Ernest Clevenger
slipped up oehind them, placed a
revolver close to Allen s neadand. Urea.
His victim fell dead at his feet. The
assassin turned the weapon upon his
fair young *ousin, shooting her in the
back. She fell across the body of her
murdered escort. The murderer escaped.
Jealousy was the cause.
A Plucky Captain.
With a majority of his crew in irons
having muntined. the British ship Jack
Burrill, Capt. Robertson, hence for
Santos with 3.006 tons of coal passed
seaward from Philadelphia Thursday.
While outward bound the Burrill an
chored at Brandywine shoals and while
there began to leak but only slightly.
All hands were set to work to pump her
out and while thus engaged decided to
protest against going in the ship, on the
ground that she was inseaworthy. After
a most thorough survey the ship
was pronounced seaworthy. This was
told the crew, but still they protested.
Capt. Robertsen faced the issue squarely.
He sent to Philadelphia for a sufficient
number of men to work the ship
clear of the capes and went out Thursday.
The crew to a man were in mutiny,
and will be kept locked up until
they agree to turn to without further
trouble.

One Thousand Kisses Against Thirty
Fine Steers.
Kansas, with her usual reputation
of producing many strange and wonderful
things, is again at the front with
one of the most peculiar election bets
that has so far come to light. Out in
Grant county, which is one of the thirty-six
counties that go to make up the
big Seventh congress district, over
which Jerry Simpson and Chester I.
Long have so bitterly centested for the
past few years, there is situated at the
junction of the north fork of the Cim-^
morATi wTTAr oPiwjin'a rrvanIr
uiaivu 11 r wi a>uu jl iuuiv Juujj wi*v
little town of Golden, a "short-grass"
hamlet, inasmuch as it is situated in
that part of Kansas known as the shortgrass
region. Golden is not what could
be rightfully called a prosperous village,
nor was it expected it would be
when first settled; it consists of one
general merchandise; store, postcffice,
and a few' dwellings. The inhabitants
of the surrounding country are mostly
ranchmen and cowboys who center at
G-olden for the purchase of supplies.
It was Miss Lucy Withers", a resi.
dent of Golden, who brought this isolated
prairie town to the attention of the
public. Miss "Withers is a comely woman
of some twenty Kansas summers,
a school teacher, and lives with her
widowed mother. She has always been
a great admirer of Jerry Simpson from
3Iedicine Lodge and never looses an
opportunity to champion his cause.
A few evenings before election there
was a social gathering in the neighborhood,
and it was during this time that
Miss Withers and a young and well-todo
ranchman, by the name of Harold
uwcusj wuua. uppusiug yicwsuu wue pulitieal
situation. The young teacher
questioned Mr. Owens as to the depth
of his faith in his candidate's election,
and whether or not he was willing to
wager some of his possessions to show
his confidence. This was somewhat of
a set back for the young ranchman, but
he informed her that he had thirty of
the finest steers that ever grazed in
Grant county, all of which he valued
at $1:000, and which he would bet
that Mr. Long would be elected to Congress.
"What have you, Miss Withers, to
show jour faith in the return of Simpson
to Congress? asked the young ranch
man.
Now, the teacher owned no steers,
neither had she anything equivalent to
thirty head of cattle, but she determined
not to be outdone. She hesitated a
moment and said:
"I will wager you 1.000 kisses at $1
each against your steers that Jerry
Simpson wins."
The young ranchman had civilized
bucking broncoes, mastered the lariat
and many oth .-r difficult feats in a ranch
man's life, but, but this offer was the
most perplexing proposition that had
ever been handed him. There was
something fascinating about the collateral
offered and he replied;
"I will accept with the understanding
that in case I win you allow me to
collect my winnings on the installment
plan."
i'Youmay suit your pleasure about
that."
"Then it is an agreement and our listeners
are the witnesses."
The election resulted in a bad defeat
of Simpson. Harold Owens says he
will collect twenty kisses, a week until
the obligation is cancelled.
A TERRIBLE ACCEDEUT..
Happened in a Tall Building in New
York.
An accident to the elevator in the 11story
building at Pine and Williams
street, New York, occupied by the Uni- .
ted States Fire Insurane company Wednesday
resulted in the death of one of
the company's directors, the probable
fatal injury of another director and the
serious injury of a third insurance man.
Several other members of the directorate
of the United States Fire Insurance
company who were in the elevator
at the time of the crash, together with
others, miraculously escaped.

of the company, was instantly
killed.
Thomas W. Caldwell of Morris town,
N. J., also a director of the company,
received a compound fracture of the
skull and is not expected to live. He is
now in the Hudson street hospital.
George H. Smith, head of the firm of
Smith & Hicks, fire underwriters, was
injured about the head and body.
It is not definitely known whether the
elevator fell first from one of the upper,
floors or whether the superstructure sup
porting the elevator fell on top of it
from the roof of the building. There
was a jarring sound and then a crash.
The cables snapped and the counterweights.

roof of the car. One of them struck
Secretary Griffin on the head, crushing
it in. Another struck Director Caldwell
a glancing blow on the back of the
head, fracturing the skull and exposing
the brain. Underwriter Smith was
struck by the torn cables and debris.
The elevator man, Dennis Sullivan,
had presence of mind enough to throw
open the lower gate just as the first
crash came, and the other passengers
in the car were able to get out of the
cagejiu time to save them.
After the accident Sullivan was ar
rested and is held awaiting the action
of the coroner. It appears from statements
made by Manager Belknap of the
Otis Elevator company and from others
in the building that this elevator had
been inspected ten minutes before the
acciden? occurred and pronounced absolutely
safe. Manager Balknap could
not advance any theory as to the cause
of the accident.

shot in the back of the head three times
and almost instantly killed while seated
in the telegraph office there. The murderer
was a boy of McKenzie, named
Hughley McCall. McCall fled to hip
borne committed suicide by taking morphine.
The cause alleged for the murder
was that Bryant arrested McCall

law violations.
JNHiYV bUUMI LAW.
There Will be a Change of System
by February I.
A SYNOPSIS OF THE ACT.
Why The Law For the Change
of System Is Not Yet
_ on the Statute
Books.
It may not be generally remembered
that the State will have practically a
new county government system next
year. The law providing for the change
of system id not in the statute books.
It will not be printed in the statutes
until the acts for next year are published.
This happened in this way: The
General Assembly at its last session
passed the new county government bill
and provided that it should go into effect
in several counties shortly after its
adoption. Representations were made
to Governor Ellerbe that it would not
be well for the new system to go into
effect during last spring and last summer
in the counties indicated, because
of certain work then in progress, which
might be jeopardized by a change of
officers. The Act was '*held-up" and it
does not go into effect until after the
assembling of the General Assembly.
It has neither been approved nor disapproved
by Governor f Ellerbe, but
simply goes into effect by the operations
of the Constitution, tluree days after
the session of the General Assembly ,
begins. The Act will no donbt go into
effect on the 1st of February, when the
new commissioners are to begin their
term of-.office, under the provisions of
the bill. It may be that the machinery
can be started before that time. The
Act provides:
Section 1 provides ''That the office of
county supervisor, as new provided by
law, shall continue, and the successors
of the mesent suDervisors shall be el act
ed by the people at the next general
election, with a term of office for two
years, and until their successors .shall
be elected and qualified."
Section 2 provides "That the Governor
shall before the first day of February,
1899, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, and before the
first day of February of each succeeding
two years, appoint upon the recommendation
of the members of General
Assembly from the several counties or
a majority of them, two persons from
each county who shall be known as the
commissioners of the county, and who
shall act with the supervisor in the
governmental matters of the county,
the said supervisors and commissioners
together to constitutes board to be
known as 'the board of county commissioners.'
The supervisor shall b? the
cn&irman or tne-Doara or county commissioners
so to be constituted."
Section 3 provides "That on the first
day of February, A. D. 1899, the office
of county commissioners and township
commissioners, as now provided to be
appointed by the Governor, shall be
abolished, and the jurisdiction, duties
and powers now devolved by law upon
the appointive boards of county and
township commissioners are hereby de~
volved upon the board of county com*
missioners herein provided for, to consist
of a county supervisor and two commissioners."
Section 4. "The board of county
commissioners and township commissioners
now appointed by the Governor
after the appointment and qualification
of the commissioners provided for in
this Act, shall continue in office as
county boards of equalization and township
boards of assessors until their sue
cessors shall be appointed, and the
Governor of this State is hereby authorized
and empowered, on the recommendation
of a majority of the mem*
bers of the General Assembly of the
respective counties, every two years to
appoint snch county boards of equaliia-.
tion and township boards of assessors
as are now provided by law for- the appointment
of county commissioners and
township commissioners."
Section 5. "That Sections 1 and 2 of
an Act approved March 9, 1896, entitled
'An Act to amend Sections 2,375,
2376 and 2402,Revised Statutes of 1892
be, and the same are hereby, repealed."
Section 6. "The county boards of
commissioners shall have the same
rights and duties with reference to the
preparation of jury lists as are now devolved
by law upon the present, county
hoard of commissioners."
Section 7. That all Acts and parts of
Acts inconsistent with this Act be, end
the same are hereby, repealed."
Section 8. "The provisions of this
Act snail not apply to Bamberg, Barnwell,
Chester. Fairfield, Hampton,
Spartanburg. Kershaw, Charleston and
Cherokee counties."
A Medal For Miss Gould.
Gen. Wheeler, of Alabama, introduced

that a gold medal with appropriate designs

as he may determine."
The Bace Troubles.
The North and South Carolina members
of congress say no plan has been
formulated yet as to congressional action
on the recent race troubles in the
Carolina?. There had been some talk
/ ? ? n /iAnAnol inrTAflft.V4^iAn krtf wa
move in that direction has been made
by the house members and ene of them
said today that it was probable the matter
would be left to Senator Pntchard
of North Carolina, who is said to have
in contemplation some kind of inquiry.
Slew But Sure.
A farmer sent one dollar for a lightning
potatobug killer, which he saw advertised
in a paper, and received by return
?mail two blocks of wood, with directions
printed on it as follows: "Take
this block, which is No. 1, in right
hand, place bug on No. 2 and press
them together. Remove bug and proceed
as before.
