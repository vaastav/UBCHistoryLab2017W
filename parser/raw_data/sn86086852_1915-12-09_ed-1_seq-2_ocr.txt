WISCONSIN TO COMPETE
FOR SEAL SALE PENNANT
Will Strive to Make Campaign Record
in the Anti-Tuberculosis Fight.
Will Wisconsin win the pennant of
fered by the national association for the study
and prevention of tuberculosis to the state
making the highest per capite sale of seals?
Rural communities of Wisconsin,
through the rural school children, will be .asked
to take a larger part in the 1915 real sale than
ever before. The state campaign is well under
way, millions of seals having gone out from the
Milwaukee office during the last week. A force
of twenty-one young men and tvomen worked
all day Thanksgiving in an effort to clear the
decks of the home office for action and put the
ammunition for disease lighting into the hands
of 7,500 generals, colonels and captains in the
various communities throughout the state.
The organizing of the seal sale is
nearly completed and practically every com
munity in the state will take active part. Added
interest will be given this year by the production
of theanti-tuberculosis photo play, “The Power
of the Penny, ■’ enacted in Wisconsin scenes
largely by Wisconsin people.
The Naming of Wisconsin
Counties.
lowa County was named for the
Siouan tribe, which also gave its name
to the State of lowa. The early history
of these Indians is clouded with uncer
tainty. They seem during the seven
teenth and eighteenth centuries to have
moved back and forth between the
Mississippi and Missouri rivers. After
the close of the French regime in Wis
consin, they occupied for a time both
banks of the Mississippi River in the re
gion which later bore their name.
Iron County was named for the im
mense deposits of iron ore to be found
within its borders. This is the center
of the great Gogebic Range which dur
ing the eighties first attracted public
notice and has since become the heart
of a rich mining community.—Wiscon

College Heads Urge Students
to Attend Them.
INTEREST RAPIOLY GROWING
Advisory Committee of University
Presidents Urges Continuation of
Work on Broader Lines to Increase
the Student Enrollment Expects
More Camps Next Year.
New York. —The advisory committee
of university presidents formed to as
sist in the w’ork of building up a na
tional reserve corps among college stu
dents adopted a report recommending
that the heads of all colleges of the
country encourage the students to join
the summer military training camps
established by the government for the
purpose of strengthening the campaign
for national preparedness. The com
mittee, besides passing the resolution
at a recent meeting here, also indorsed
the w’ork that has been done at the
military camps and laid special em
phasis on the educational value of the
training.

ent w’ere President Henry S. Drinker
of Lehigh. President H. A. Garfield of
Williams, Chancellor J. 11. Kirkland of
Vanderbilt university and Brigadier
General E. W. Nichols, superintendent
of the Virginia Military institute.
Major General Leonard Wood, repre
senting the government, was also there
to hear the opinions of the committee
and make recommendations to Wash
ington accordingly.
Others who are members of the com
mittee but were unable to attend the
meeting are Presidents A. Lawrence
Lowell of Harvard. Arthur T Hadley
of Yale, H. B. Hutchins of t * niver
sity of Michigan. George 11. of
the University of Alabama. Benjamin
Ido Wheeler of the University of Cali
fornia. J. G. Schurman of Cornell and
Edmund J. James of the University of
Illinois and Dr. John H. Finley, com
missioner of education of New York.
The members of the committee dis
cussed informally the benefits which
have accrued from the government's
military camps and urged the continua
tion of the work on broader lines to in
crease the student enrollment. Asa
result it is expected that the govern
ment will establish more of these train
ing camps next year for students and
business men.
The committee was formed three
years ago at the suggestion of Major
General Wood, w’ho asked the heads of
various institutions to aid in the devel
opment of the summer training camps
of college students.
The first camps were established in
the summer of 1913 at Gettysburg and
at the Presidio. The course of instruc
tion lasted five w’eeks. There w’ere 300
students in attendance. In 1914 camps
w’ere established at Burlington. Vt.;
Asheville. N. C., and Ludington, Mich.
The number of students attending
jumped to 700. This year more than
1,000 were enrolled, and an additional
camp was opened at Plattsburg.
“We regard this movement as in no
way militaristic.” said a member of
the committee. ”Us object is to train
the students of our colleges and there
fore serve a useful purpose to the
country. The education w’hich the stu
dents receive under officers of the army
is of the greatest value to them and to
the nation, and we feel that the sum
mer camps are agencies for good which
the universities should do their utmost
to encourage.”

PRESIDENT
WILSON’S
MESSAGE
#
Delivered to Congress on Tuesday
Continued from Page Four.
But armies and instruments of war
are only part of w’hat has to be con
sidered if we are to consider the su
preme matter of national self sufficien
cy and security in all its aspects.
There are other great matters which
w’ill be thrust upon our attention
w hether we will or not. There is, for
example, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping involved in this
great problem of national adequacy.
It is necessary for many weighty rea
sons of national efficiency and devel
opment that w’e should have a great
merchant marine. The great merchant
fleet w’e once used to make us rich,
that great body of sturdy sailors w’ho
used to carry our flag into every sea,
and who were the pride and often the
bulwark of the nation. w r e have almost
driven out of existence by inexcusable
neglect and indifference and by a hope
lessly blind and provincial policy of
so called economic protection. It is
high time w r e repaired our mistake and
resumed our commercial independence
on the seas.
With a view to meeting these press
ing necessities of our commerce and
availing ourselves at the earliest possi
ble moment of the present unparalleled
opportunity of linking the two Ameri
cas together in bonds of mutual inter
est and service, an opportunity w’hich
may never return again if w r e miss it
now, proposals w’ill be made to the
present congress for the purchase or
construction of ships to be ow r ned and
directed by the government similar to
those made to the last congress, but
modified in some essential particulars.
1 recommend these proposals to you
for your prompt acceptance with the
more confidence because every month
that has elapsed since the former pro
posals w’ere made has made the ne
cessity for such action more and more
manifestly imperative. That need w T as
then foreseen. It is now acutely felt
and everywhere realized by those for
whom trade is waiting, but w T ho can
find no conveyance for their goods. 1
am not so much interested in the par
ticulars of the program as 1 am in
taking immediate advantage of the
great opportunity which awaits us if
w’e W’ill but act in this emergency. In
this matter, as in all others, a spirit of
common counsel should prevail, and
out of it should come an early solu
tion of this pressing problem
SHOULD AGREE ON POLICY
IN THE PHILIPPINES.
Recommends Early Adoption of Meas
ures Giving Them Fuller Justice.
The president recommends the early
adoption of bills for the alteration and
reform of the government of the Phil
ippines and for rendering fuller polit
ical justice to the people of Porto liico.
which were submitted to the Sixty
third congress. The president refers
to the increased cost of carrying out
the plans for the armed forces of the
nation and tells of the fiscal problems
confronting the government.
On the, 30th of June last there was
an available balance in the general
fund of the treasury of $104,170,105.78.
The total estimated receipts for the
year 1910, on the assumption that the
emergency revenue measure passed by
the last congress will not be extended
beyond its present limit, the 31st of
December, 1915, and that the present
duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar will
be discontinued after the Ist of May.
1910, will be $070,305,500. . The balance
of June last and these estimated rev
enues come therefore to a g: and total
of $774,535,005.78. The total estimated
disbursements for the present fiscal
year, including twenty-five millions for
the Panama canal, tw’clve millions for
probable deficiency appropriations and
$50,000 for miscellaneous debt redemp
tions, will bo $753,891,000, and the bal
ance in the general fund of the treas
ury w’ill be reduced to $20,044,005.78.
The emergency revenue act if contin
ued beyond its present time limitation
w’ould produce during the half year
then remaining about forty-one mil
lions. The duty of 1 cent per pound
on sugar if continued would produce
during the tw’o months of the fiscal
year remaining after the Ist of May
about fifteen millions. These tw T o sums,
amounting together to fifty-six mil
lions, if added to the revenues of the
second half of the fiscal year w’ould
yield the treasury at the end of the
year an available balance of $76,644,-
005.78.
The additional revenues required to
carry out the program of military and
naval preparation of which I have
spoken w’ould. as at present estimated,
be for the fiscal year 1917 $93,800,000.
Those figures, taken with the figures
for the present fiscal year which I
have already given, disclose our finan
cial problem for the year 1917. As
suming that the taxes imposed by the
emergency revenue act and the nres
ent duty on sugar are to be discontin
ued and that the balance at the close
of the present fiscal year will be only
$20,644,605.78. that the disbursements
for the Panama canal will again be
about $25,000,000 and that the addi
tional expenditures for the army and
navy are authorized by the congress,
the deficit in the general fund of the
treasury on the 30th of June. 1917.
will be nearly $235,000,000. To this
sum at least $50,0 0,000 should be add
ed to represent a safe wmrking balance
for the treasury and $12,000,000 to In-
clbiie tlie usvaal deficiency estimates In
1017, and these additions would make
a total deficit of some $297,000,000. If
the present taxes should be continued
throughout this year and the next,
however, there would be a balance in
the treasury of some $70,500,000 at
the end of the present fiscal year and
a deficit at the end of the next year of
only some $50,000,000. or. reckoning in
$02,000,000 for deficiency appropria
tions and a safe treasury balance at
the end of the year, a total deficit of
some $112,000,000. The obvious moral
of the figures is that it is a plain coun
sel of prudence to continue all of the
present taxes or their equivalents and
confine ourselves to the problem of
providing $112,000,000 of new revenue
rather than $297,000,000.
How shall we obtain the new rev
enue? We are frequently reminded
that there are many millions of bonds
which the treasury is authorized under
existing law to sell to reimburse the
sums paid out of current revenues for
the construction of the Panama canal,
and it is true that bonds for the
amount of $222,432,000 are now avail
able for that purpose. Prior to 1913
$138,000,000 of these bonds had ac
tually been sold to recoup the expendi
tures at the isthmus, and now con
stitute a considerable item of the pub
lic debt. But I for one do not believe
that the people of this country approve
of postponing the payment of their
bills. Borrowing money is shortsight
ed finance. It can be justified only
when permanent things are to be ac
complished which many generations
will certainly benefit by and which it
seems hardly fair that a single genera
tion should pay for. The objects we
are now proposing to spend money for
cannot be so classified, except in the
sense that everything wisely done may
be said to be done in the interest of
posterity as well as in our own. It
seems to me a clear dictate of pru
dent statesmanship and frank finance
that in what we are now, I hope, about
to undertake we should pay as w’e go
The people of the country are entitled
to know just what burdens of taxation
they are to carry and to know from the
outset now. The new bills should be
paid by internal taxation.
NATION’S SECRET FOES
SHOULD BE CRUSHED.
Gravest Danger to Country Comes
From Within Our Own Borders.
The president says that the precise
reckonings of the problem to be met
are set forth in the report of the secre
tary of the treasury.
I have spoken to you today, gentle
men. upon a single theme, the thor
ough preparation of the nation to care
for its own security and to make sure
of entire freedom to play the impar
tial role in this hemisphere and in the
world which we all believe to have
been providentially assigned to it. 1
have had in my mind no tbought of
any immediate or particular danger
arising out of our relations with other
nations. We are at peace with all the
nations of the world, and there is rea
son to hope that no question in con
troversy between this and other gov
ernments will lead to any serious
breach of amicable relations, grave as
some differences of attitude and policy
have been and may yet turn out to be.
I am sorry to say that the gravest
threats against our national peace and
safety have been uttered within our
own borders. There are citizens of the
United States, I blush to admit, born
under other flags, but welcomed under
our generous naturalization laws to the
full freedom and opportunity of Amer
ica. who have poured the poison of dis
loyalty into the very arteries of our
national life, who have sought to bring
the authority and good name of our
government into contempt, to destroy
our industries wherever they thought
it effective for their vindictive pur
poses to strike at them and to debase
our politics to the uses of foreign in
trigue. Their number is not great as
compared with the whole number of
those sturdy hosts by which our na
tion has been enriched in recent gen
erations out of virile foreign stocks,
but it is great enough to have brought
deep disgrace upon us and to have
made it necessary that we should
promptly make use of processes of law
by which we may be purged of their
corrupt distempers.
America never witnessed anything
like this before. It never dreamed it
possible that men sworn into its own
citizenship, men drawn out of great
free stocks such as supplied some of
the best and strongest elements of that
little, but how heroic, nation that in a
high day of old staked its very life to
free itself from every entanglement
that had darkened the fortunes of the
older nations and set up anew stand
ard here —that men of such origins and
such free choices of allegiance would
ever turn in malign reaction against
the government and people who had
welcomed and nurtured them and seek
to make this proud country once more
a hotbed of European passion. A lit
tle while ago such a thing would have
seemed incredible. Because it was in
credible we made no preparation for
it. We would have been almost
ashamed to prepare for it. as if we
were suspicious of ourselves, our own
comrades and neighbors! But the ugly
and incredible thing has actually come
about, and w T e are without adequate
federal law’s to deal with it. I urge
you to enact such laws at the earliest
possible moment and feel that in doing
so I am urging you to do nothing less
than save the honor and self respect
of the nation. Such creatures of pas
sion. disloyalty and anarchy must be
crushed out. They are not many, but
they are infinitely malignant, and the
hand of our power should close over
them at once. They have formed plots
to destroy property, they have entered
THURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 19io.
nto conspiracies against tne neutrality
f the government; they have sought
to pry into every confidential trans
action of the government in order to
serve interests alien to our own. It is
possible to deal with these things very
effectually. I need not suggest the
terms in which they may be dealt with.
I wish that it could be said that only
a few men, misled by mistaken senti
ments of allegiance to the governments
under which they were born, had been
guilty of disturbing the self possession
and misrepresenting the temper and
principles of the country during these
days of terrible war. when It would
seem that every man who was truly an
American would instinctively make it
his duty and his pride to keep the
scales of judgment even and prove him
self a partisan of no nation but his
own. But it cannot. There are some
men among us and many resident
abroad who, though born and bred in
the United States and calling them
selves Americans, have so forgotten
themselves and their honor as citizens
as to put their passionate sympathy
with one or the other side in the great
European conflict above their regard
for the peace and dignity of the United
States. They also preach and practice
disloyalty. No laws, 1 suppose, can
reach corruptions of the mind and
heart, but I should not speak of others
without also speaking of these and ex
pressing the even deeper humiliation
and scorn which every self possessed
and thoughtfully patriotic American
must feel when he thinks of them and
of the discredit they are daily bringing
upon us.
What is more important is that the
industries and resources of the country
should be available and ready for
mobilization. It is the more impera
tively necessary, therefore, that we
should promptly devise means for do
ing what we have not yet done—that
we should give intelligent federal aid
and stimulation to industrial and voca
tional education, as we have long done
in the large field of our agricultural
industry; that at the same time that
we safeguard and conserve the natural
resources of the country we should
put them at the disposal of those who
will use them promptly and intelli
gently, as was sought to be done in
the admirable bills submitted to the
last congress from its committees on
the public lands, bills which I earnest
ly recommend in principle to your con
sideration; that we should put into
early operation some provision for
rural credits which will add to the ex
tensive borrowing facilities already
afforded the farmer by the reserve
bank act adequate instrumentalities
by which long credits may be obtained
on land mortgages and that we should
study more carefully than they have
hitherto been studied the right adapta
tion of our economic arrangements to
changing conditions.
Many conditions about which we
have repeatedly legislated are being
altered from decade to decade, it is
evident, under our very eyes and are
likely to change even more rapidly
and more radically in the days imme
diately ahead of us when peace has
returned to the world and the nations
of Europe once more take up their
tasks of commerce and industry with
the energy of those who must bestir
themselves to build anew.
REGULATIONS TO MEET
RAILROAD PROBLEM.
Needed to Make Lines More Useful
Servants of Country.
In the meantime may I make this
suggestion? The transportation prob
lem is an exceedingly serious and
pressing one in this country. There
has from time to time of late been rea
son to fear that our railroads would
not much longer be able to cope with
it successfully, as at present equipped
and co-ordinated. 1 suggest that it
would be wise to provide for a com
mission of Inquiry to ascertain by a
thorough canvass of the whole ques
tion whether our laws as at present
framed and administered are as serv
iceable as they might be in the solu
tion of the problem. It is obviously
a problem that lies at the very foun
dation of our efficiency as a people.
Such an inquiry ought to draw out
every circumstance and opinion worth
considering, and we need to know
all sides of the matter if we mean to
do anything in the field of federal leg
islation.
No one, I am sure, would wish to
take any backward step. The regula
tion of the railways of the country by
federal commission has had admirable
results and has fully justified the
hopes and expectations of those by
whom the policy of regulation was
originally proposed. The question Is
not, What should we undo? It is
whether there is anything else we can
do that would supply us with effective
means, in the very process of regu
lation, for bettering the conditions un
der which the railroads are operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole. It
seems to me that it might be the part
of wisdom, therefore, before further
legislation in this field is attempted,
to look at the whole problem of co-or
dination and efficiency In the full light
of a fresh assessment of circumstance
and opinion, as a guide to dealing with
the several parts of it.
For what we are seeking now. what
in my mind is the single thought of
this message, is national efficiency and
security. We serve a great nation.
We should serve it in the spirit of its
peculiar genius. It is the genius of
common men for self government, in
dustry. justice, liberty and peace. We
should see to it that it lacks no in
strument. no facility or vigor of law.
to make it sufficient to play its part
with energy, safety and assured suc
cess. In this we are no partisans but
heralds and prophets of anew o.ge.
