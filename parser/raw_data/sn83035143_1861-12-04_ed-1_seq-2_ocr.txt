The President's Massage.
We print herewith tha first annual liea-k--se
of Abraham Lincoln, and at such a
lime ai this we Jo not need to Invite for It
the careful attention of every citiinn. It
will be read with Interest, not only through
out our own country, but throughout .the
world, and Its recommendations will be
dijonswJ as fre! in European Capital!
and CablneU as they will be in every school
district in loTal America. Never before WW
there more interest fc-lt U Iti provisions.
Every hnaUct, and almost every family haf a
reprueunUtire In the grand army, and a per
sonal welfare In the Ustie of the war.
President Lincoln gives no lengthy prelude
or preliminary flourish ot rhetoric. He at
once takes hold of the rebellion, and directs
his first attention to the fears of foreign In
tcrference. The ribels have roctived less
foreign aid than they hud expected, for for
eign powers do not tail to see that the furth
rtnoe ot their trade and commerce can beet
be accomplished with the one united nation
i has vuh its divided parts. But the safety
cf this country, the President well remarks,
rent more upon the loyally, patriotism, vir
tue and independence of the American peo
ple than upon foreign aid. Nevertheless, be
recommends putting ourselves in a state oi
defence so far as we can readily do so, espec
ially upon our lakes and rivers. Fortifica
tions and depots at well selected poiuto would
be of importance.
It is recemmendtd as a military measure
that Congress construct a railread to connect
Eastern Tennessee and Western North Caro
lioa with Kentucky. This looks, doubtlesti
not only to future usefulness, but to war
operations in Eastern Kentucky and the for
mer States. In cae of the advance of the
two armies, one from Kentucky and the other
from Charleston and BavBnhahovrards each
other, such a road would be of in.mense ad
vantage, while at all times it woild be
means of commerce and profit to the loyal
Tenaesseeans.
Mr. Lincoln recommends that United
States vessels be empowered not only to de
fend themselves against pirates but also to
recapture prizes, which have been taken by
pirates or privateeis.
The remarks of the President upon re
cognizing the independence of Hayti and
Liberia, ar extremely woll timed.. Those
nations have shown the ability of the color
ed race to take care of and elevate themselves
and we should not be content, in these days
of the slaveholders' rebellion, to be the last
uovernmem uj recugai-t-o men c-hdm;.
JL mgu compliment lb paiu j
of the Treasury for the able manner in which
be has conducted the affairs of his depart
ment, and confidence is expressed in the dis
position of the people to stand by the Gov
ernment. -
The number of men who have volunteered
for the war is greater than the number au
thorized by Congress lo be called out; and
till the patriotism of the people is unabated.
With some recommendations regarding
Chaplains in Hospitals, the President refeis
the public to the report of the Becretarr ol
War.
So treat have been the additions to the
Navy that it may be eaid a new Xavy has
been created which has honored itself and
the country.
-There are three vacancies In the Supreme
Court, caused by the death of Judge Daniel
ne lfcLeanjinil ih Tairn1nn of
President makes some suggestions as to the
Judiciary system of the country,
It U recommended that the Statutes of
tha United States be revised, condensed and
put Into convenient form for general use.
Attention is given to the claims of loyal
citizens upon rebels, which they are unable
to collect through existing laws and the hope
expressed that Congress may divise some
plan by which justice may be administered
in all those parts of the rebel States which
by any manner come under the power of
our arms.
It Is recommended that the District of Co
lumbia, by negotiation with Virginia, be en
larged to Its former boundaries of ten miles
square.
Indian affairs are considered generally fa
vorable, and in a few words the President
give bird's eye view of the operations of
the Postal and Interior Departments.
Coming then, to the rebellion, its connec
tion with slavery and the means employed
to put it down, Mr. Lincoln says that in
the policy adopted toward the insurgents he
has confined himself, so far as possible, to the
enactments of Congress, not having trans
cended them. He has made the restoration
of the Dnion the primary work to be attend
ed to, leaving many minor matters to be de
bated by the national legislature. What to
do with the negroes, is of course a great ques
tion connected with the war. Air. Lincoiii
declares in favor of colonizing them in some
congenial climate. He advocates no general
emancipation, but his language clearly im
plies that he considers all eltve belonging to
rebel masters, who are in any way employed
to aid the rebellion, as liable to contujcation.
Of these and of those who have escaped to our
lines, we have now a great number so many
that something must be done with them. ' It
it recommended that sufficient territory be ac
quired on which to colonize these, as also free
colored persons. " Having practiced the ac
quUitloa of territory for fifty years, it is too
late to discuss its constitutionality " He
considers that this is a case of absolute ne
cessity, if we would perpetuate our govern
ment. '
The despotism of the rebel argnments that
'capital should own labor," is strongly
shown by Mr. Lincoln. " .
This portion ot the Message was written
aftsr the publication of the report of the
Constitutional Committee of the Richmond'
Convention, noticed by us a few days since,
and effectually uses np their flimsy argu
ments. - '
With a brief summing np of the progress
of our cation from its birth to the preeent
time, and with hopes and confidence for the fu
tare, the President close his Message, which,
as a practical business paper, as well as pa
triotic discourse, has never beeu excelled by
any former occupant of the Presidential
chair. -

Fellow dtiietu of the Striata ani JJor.ir of

In the midst of unprecedented political
troubles we have cause of great gratitude lo
God for unusual (rood beHltfland must aounu
ant harvests. You will not be surprised to
learn that in the peculiar essences or the

of
THE REBELLION AND FOREIGN INTERFERENCE
A disloyal portion of the American peo
ple bava, during tbe w note year, boenengiig
el in an attempt to divide and destroy the
Union. A aUoa - which endure tactions
domestic divisions is exposed to disrespect
abroad, and one party, or both, is sura, soon
er or later, to invoke foreiun iutervention.
Nations thus tempted to interfere are not at-
wavs able to resist the counsels ot seeming
expediency and ungenerous ambition, al
though measures adopted under such influ
ences seldom fail to be unfurl uuai and lnju-
iruus to those adoption them.
The dtaloval oitinns of tne united estate
who have offered thr ruin of our country In
reward for the aid and comfort which they
have invoked abroad, have received l
patronasr and encouragetmnt than they
probably expected. If it were just to suppose,
as the insurgents have seemed to assume,
that foreign nations in this case, disregnraing
all moral, social and treaty obligations.wonld
act solely and aelfishly for the most speedy
restoration of commerce, including spec
ially, the acquisition of cotton, these
nations ariDear as yet not to nave eeeu
their way to their object mora uirecuy
or clearlv wrouun tne aesiruciion tiu
throutrh the preservation of the union.
we could dare to believe that foreign nations
are actuated by no higher principle tian this
I am ouite sure a second argument cor Id ne
made to show that they could reach their
aim more readily and easily by aiding
crush this rebellion than by giving encour
agement to the principal lever relied on by
it. : The excltinir ot foreign nations to hos
tility against na, as already Intimated.
is tha embarrassment of commerce.
These nations, however, not improbably caw
from the first that it was the Union which
made as well onr foreign as ou- domesti.
commerce. They can scarcely fill to per
ceive that the effort for disunion produces the
eiistiuor difficulty, and that one strong na
tion promises more darable peace, a',d a more
extensive, valuable and reliablo comncrce
than the same nation broken into hostile
fragments. It is not my purpose to review
our discussions with foreign Sitates, because
whatever mieht be their wishes, or cisposi
lions, the integrity of our couutry rod the
stability of our Government mainly depends
not upon them, but upon tne loyauj, patriot
ism, virtue and intelligence ot the American
people. The correspondence itself, vith the
ususal reservation, is berewitusu emitted,
venture to hope it will appear that we have
practiced prudence and liberality tcwarcs .or
eiim t powers averting . causes cf - irri
tation, and with firmness maintaining our
own rights and honor. Since, hewerer, it is
aDDarent that here, as in every othar State,
foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic
diffbulties, i recommend that adequate and
ample measures be adopted for rnaintnining
the public defences on every siae; wui.e uu
der this treuerai recommendation provision
for defendiud our coast line readily occcr to
the mind.
OUR DEFENCES.
I also, in the same connection,asvths r.ttan
tion of C'onereas to our great lakes and rivers.
It is believed that some fortifications and de
pots of arms and munitions, with harbor and
navigation improvements, at we'd selected
points upon these, would be of great import
ance to the national defense and pressrvatlon.
I ask attention to the views of the Secretary
bf War, expressed in his report rpen the
tome eeneral subject. I deem it of import
ance that the loyal regions of East Tennessee
and Western North Carolina should ce con
nected- with Kentucky and other faithful
narts of tbe Union by railroad.. 1 therefore
recommend as a military measure, that Con
imys Drovide for the construction of such
road as soeedilv as possible. Kentucky will
no doubt co-operate, and through her Legis
lature make the most judicious selection of
the line. The northern terminus must con
nect with some existing railroad, and whether
the route shall be from Lexington or mcno
laeville to Cumberland Gap, or from Lebanon
to the Tennessee line, in the direction ot
easily be' determined. Kentucky and the
General Government co-operating, the vrork
can be completed in a very short time, and
when done, it will be not onlj of vast preeent
usefulness, but also an available psrmanent
Improvement, worth its cost in all the future.
FOREIGN TREATIES.
' Some treaties designed chiefiy for the in
terests of commerce, and having no grave
political importance, have been negotiated,
and will be suhmitted to the Senate lor their
consideration. Although we bf.ve failed to
induce some of the commercial powers to
adopt a desirable melioration for the rigor
of maritime war, we have far removed all
tbe obstacle from the way of their humane
reform, except such as an merely of tempo
rary and accidental occurrence. invite
your attention to the correspondence be
tween her Britanic Uajosty's Minister, ac
credited to this Government, ai:d the Sec
retary of State, relative to the detention of
the British ship Perthshire, in June last, by
the United States steamer Massachusetts,
(or a supposed breach of the blocde. As
this detention was occasioned by an obvious
misrepresentation of the facts, end as jus
tice requires that we should corimit no bel
ligerent act not founded in strict right as
sanctioned by public law, I recommend
than an appropriation be made to satisfy the
reasonable demand of the owneri of the ves
sel for her detention.
THE CHINA CLATMS.
1 repeat the recommendation c-irry prede
cessor, in bis anuuul message :c Congress,
in December last, in regard to the disposition
of the surplus which will probably remain
after satisfying the claims of Americen citi
zens againet China, pursuant to tha ewards
of the Commissioners, under tbe at of the
3d of March, 1859. If, however, !l should
not be deemed advisable to carry the., recom
mendation into effect, I would trtgcst that
authority be given tor investing the princi
pal, over tbe surplus referred to, a good se
curities, with a view to the satisfaction ot
such other j net claim of oar citirens against
China as are not unlikely to arise hereafter
in the course of our eiteusive tn-.de with tbat
Empire.
By the act of the 3th of Augns' last, Con
gress authorized the President to instr'ct the
commanders .'of suitable vesiseis to defend
themselves against, and to capture pirates.
This authority has been exercised ir. a single
instance only. . ...
For the more ellectual protection of our
extensive and valuable commerce in the Eas
tern seas, especially, it seems to ms that it
would also be ad visible to authorize the com
mander of (Ailing vessels "to recapture any
prizes which pirates my make cf United
State veese!s,autheir cargoes, and tbe Con
sular Court established by law in Eastern
Countries to adjudica'e the cases in the event
thatftmi should not be objected to tv the lo
cal authorities.
TBI iaOEPEKDXVCI Of BAYTI AMQ LISIB! A.
: If any good reason exists why we should
persevere longer in withholding cur recogni
tion of the Independence and sov?reignty of
Hayti and Liberia, I am anable to discern It.
Unwilling, however, to inaugnrats a novel
policy In regard to tUom without th appro
bation of Congress, I submit for your consid
eration the expediency of an appropriation
for maintaining a Charge d'Affaires rear each
of these States. It doe not admit of doubt
that important commercial ad vautres might
be secured 'by favorable treali-i with them.
THE TREASURY.
Tbe operations of tbe Treasury during tbe
period which has elapsed since you adjourn
ment, have been conducted with signal sue
oees. ' Tbe patriotism of the people ha

Much of the National Loan has bees

tbe support or the Ouvernment the wuoie
their limited acnuisilious. This fact im
pose peculiar obligation to economy in aiv
bureement aud euergy in actiou.
The revenue from all source, including
lii&ni fnr the financial ver ending on the
30th of June, 1861, was $86,635,900 27, and
the expenditure for the same period, tnclua

The receipts rrom an sonrcee, including tun

and ths expenses, $98,239,733 09 ; leaving a

Estimates tor the remaining three quarters ol
tho year and for the financial year of 1863,
together with bis view of the way and
meins for meeting the demands contempla
ted by them, will be submitted to Congress
br the Becretary ol ire Treasury.
It ia gratifying to know that the expenses
made necescarv bv the rebellion are not be
yond the resources of the loyal people, and
to believe mat me same pairiousm wu u
has thus far sustained the Government will
continue to sustain it until peace and union
shall again bless the land.
THE ARMY.
I respectfully refer to the report of the
Secretary of War for information respecting
the numerical strength ot 'he army, ana lor
recommendations having In view an increase
of it efficiency, and tbe well being of the
various branches ot the service eu trusted to
his care. Ill gratifying to know that the
patriotism of the people ia equal to the oc
casion, and that the number ot troops ten
dered greatly exceeds the force which Con
cress authorized me to call Into the field. 1
refer with pleasure to those portions of his
report which make allusion to the credit
able degree of discipline already attained by
our troops, and to the excellent sanitary
condition of the entire army.
The recommendation by the Secretary for
an organization of the militia upon a uniform
basis, ia a subject of vital Importance to the
future safety ot the country, and is comm -na
to tbe. serious attention ot Congress.
A large addition to the regular army, in
connection with the defection that has so
considerably diminished the number of it
officers, civee peculiar importance to bis rec
ommendation tor increasing the corps of ca
det to the greatest capacity of the Military
Academv.
By mere omission, I presume, Congress ha
failed to provide Chaplains for the Hospitals
occupied by volunteers. Thi ubjeet was
brought to my notice, and I was induced to
draw np the form of a letter, one copy of
which properly addressed to each of the per
sons and at the dates respectively namea, ana
stated in a schudale containing also the form
of the letter marked "A," and herewith trans
mitted: These gentlamen I tinderstandjenter
ed upon tbe duties designated at the time res
pectively stated in the schedule, and have la
bored faithfully therein ever since. I there
fore recommend that they be compensated at
the same rate a Chaplains in the army.
I further suggest that general provisions
be made for chaplains to serve at hospital
as well as with regiments.
THE ARMY. THE NAVY.
ftThe report of the Secretary of tbe
Navr presents in detail the oper
ations ot that branch of the service, and
the activity and energy which have charac
terized ita administration and the results ot
measures to increase lis efficiency and pow
er. Such have been the additions by con
struction and purchase that it may almost be
said a navy has been created and brought
into service since our difficulties commenced.
Betides blockading onr extensive coast,
souadrons lareer than ever before assembled
under our flag have been put afloat and per
formed deeds which have increased our navai
renown. -
I would invite special attention to the
recommendation of the Secretary of the
Navy for a more perfect organisation of the
navy by introducing additional grades in the
service. The present organization Is defec
tive and unsatisfactory, and the suggestions
submitted br the Department will, it is be
lieved, if adopted, obviate the difficulties
allnded to, promote harmony and Increase
th efficiency of the navy.
THE [...].
There are three vacancies on the bench of
the Supreme Court Two by the decease of
Justices Daniel and McLean, and one by the
resignation of Justice Campbell. I have so
far loreborne making nominations to fill
these vacancies for reasons whioh I will now
state. Two of the outgoing Judges resided
within the States now overrun by revolt, so
that if successors were appointed In tbe same
localities they could not serve upon their
circuits, and many ot the most competent
men there probably would not take tbe per
sonal hazard of accepting to serve even here
upon the supreme bench.
I have been unwilling to throw all tbe
appointment northward, thus disabling my
self from doing justice to tbe South on tbe
return of peace, although I may remark that
to transfer to the North one which has here
tofore been in the South, would not, with ref
erence to territory and population, be unjust.
During the long and brilliant judicial career
of Suuge Mclveau, 013 circuit grew into an
an empire altogether too large for any one
Judge to give the courts therein more thsu
a nominal attendance, rising in population
lrom 1,470,000 in 1831, to C,15l,405 in 1860.
Besides this, tbe conntry has generally out
grown our present Judicial system. If uni
formity was at all intended, the system re
quires that all the States shall be accommo
dated with Circuit Court, attended by Su
preme Judges, while in fact Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Florida,
Texas, California, and Oregon, hare
never had any such courts, nor can this be
well remedied without a change of the sys
tem, because tbe adding ot justices to tbe su
preme Court, enough for the accommodation
ot all parts of the country witbCircuitOourts,
would create a court altogether too danger
ous for a judicial body ot any ixt, and the
evil of it be one that will increase as new
States come into tbe Union. Circuit Courts
are useful or they are eat useful. If useful,
no State should be denied them. If not use
ful, no State should have them. Let them be
provided for all, or abolished as to all.
Three modifications occur to VPJ) here,
which I think would be an improvement up
on our present system. Let the Supreme
Court be of convenient number io every
event. Then first let tbe whole country be
divided into circuits of convenient size, tha
Supreme Judges to serve in a number of
them corresponding to their own number, and
independent Circuit Judge be provided for
all the rest; or secondly, tbe Supreme Judges
he relieved from Circuit duties, and Circuit
Judge provided for ell thp Cirpajtfj or
thirdly, dispense with Circuit Court alto
gether, leaving the judifjaj functions wholly
to the Distriet Courts, and an independent
Supreme Court.
THE U. S. STATUTES.
I respectfully reocommend to the consider
ation of Congress, the present condition of
the statute laws, with tbe hope that Congress
will be able to find an easy remedy for the
many inconveniences aud evils which con
stantly embarrass those engaged in the prac
tical administration of tbem.
bince the organization of the Government
Congress ha enacted some S00O acts and
joint resolutions, which fill more than 6000
closely printed pages, and are scattered
through many volumes. Many of these acts
have been drawn in haste and without suffi
cient caution, so that their provisions are of
ten obscure in themscive or in conflict with
each 'other, or at least so doubtful a
jo render it very difficult for even
the best informed persons to ascertain pre
cisely what th statute law is.
It seems lo ma very important that the
statute law should be made as plain and In
telligible as possible, and be reduced to a
small a compass as may consist with the full-
ness and precision of tie will of ths legisla-
ture and the porapioultv of ita language.
These well done would, I think, greatly fa
cilitate the labors of those whose duty it l to
assist in tbe administration of the laws, and
would be a lasting benefit to th people by
placing before them Id a more accessible and
Intelligible form tbe laws which so deeply
concern their Intercuts and their dutle.
I am informed by some whose opinions I
respect, that all the act of Congress now In
force and of a permanent, general nature,
might be revised and re-written o as to be
embraced in on volume, or at least two vol
umes of ordinary and convenient size ; and
1 respecUully recommend to Congress to con
sider th subject, and If my iuggestlon be ap
proved, to devise such a plan a to their wis
dom shall seem most proper for th attain
ment of the esd proposed. . ,
NORTHERN CLAIMS IN REBEL STATES.
One of the unfavorable consequences ot the
present insurrection is the entire suppression
In many places ot all ordinary means of ad-
minlsteriug civil justice by the olficers,aad ia
the forms ot existing law. This is the case in
whole or In part in all the Insurgent States,
and as our armies advance upon and take
possession of part of those States, tbe prac
tical evil become more apparent. There are
no courts or officer to whom the citizen ot
other State may apply for the enforcement
of their lawful claim against citizen ot the
Insurgent States, and there is a vast amount
of debt constituting such claim, some have
estimated it as high as 200,000,000 dollars,
due in large part from insurgents in open re
bell ion to loyal citizen, who are even now
making great sacrifice In tbe discharge of
their patriotic duty to support the Govern
ment. Under these circumstances I have
been urgently solicited to establish, by mili
tary power, courts to administer summary
justice in such cases. I have thus far de
clined to do It, not because i bad any Ooudi
that the end proposed, tbe collection ot debt
was just and right in itself, but because
have been unwilling to go beyond the pres
sure of necessity in the unusual exercise of
power. But .he powers of Congress, I sup
pose, are equal to the anomalous oc
casion; and therefore, I refer tbe whole
matter to Congress, with tbe hope that
a plan may be devised for the admmisvation
of justice in all such parts of the insurgent
States and territories as may be nnder con
trol of this Government whether by a vol
nntary return to allegiance and order or by
tbe power of our arms, ibis, however,
not to be a permanent institution, but a tem
porary sabstitute, and to cease a coon as the
ordinary courts can be reestablished in peace.
CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.
It is important that some more convent.
ent means should be provided if possible for
the adj ustment of claims against tha Uovern
ment, especially in view of their increased
number by reason of the war. It is as much
the dutv ot the Government to render
prompt justice against itself in favor of citi
zens as it is to administer tbe same
between private individuals. The in
vestigation and adjudication of
all the claims In their nature belong to the
Judicial department ; besides it is apparent
that the attention of Congress will be more
than usually engaged for some time to come
with great national questions. It was in.
tended by the organization of the Court of
Claims mainly to remove this branch of bust
nes from the hall of Congress ; but while
the Court has proved to be an effective and
valuable means of investigation, it in a great
degree tails to effect the object of its creation
for want of power to make its judgments u-
naL Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say
the danger, of the subject, I commend to your
careful consideration whether thia power of
making judgment final may not be properly
given to the Court, reserving the right of ap
peal on questions of law to the Supreme
Court, with such other provisions as expen
ance may have shown lo be necessary,
THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT.
I ask attention to the report of the Post,
master General, the following being a sum
mary statement of the condition of the De
partment Tbe revenue from ail sources
during tbe fiscal year ending 30th Jane, 1861,
including- the annual permanent appropria
tion of $700,000 for the transportation of
free mail matter was $9,049,296.40, being
about two per cent, less than the reve
nue ot 1860. The expenditures were $13,'
606,709.11, showing a decrease ot more than
8 per cent as compared with those of the
previous year, and leaving an excess of ex
penditures over the revenue for th last fucal
year of over $557,462 71. The gross reve
nue for the year ending June 30th, 1863, Is
that of 1861, making - $8,683,000: to which
should be added the earning of tbe Depart
ment for carrying free matter, vis: $700,000,
making $9,382,000.. The total expenditures
for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leav
Ing an estimated deficiency of $3,334,000 to
be supplied from th Treasury, it addition to
the permanent appropriation.
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
The present insurrection shows, I think,
that the extension of this district across the
Potomac river at the time of establishing the
capital here, was eminently wise, and conse
quently, tuat the relinquishment of that por
tion of it which lies in tbe Sta'e ot Virginia,
was unwise and dangerous. I submit for
your consideration the expediency of regain
ing that part of the district and the restora
tion of the original boundaries thereof through
negotiation with the State or Virginia.
THE INTERIOR.
The report of the Secretary of the Interi
or, with tbe accompanying documents, exhib
it tbe condition or tbe several branches of
the public business pertaining to that De
partment Tbe depressing influence of tbe
insurrection have been especially telt in the
operations of the Patent and General Land
Office. Tbe caeh receipts from the sales of
publio lands during the past year have ex
ceeded the expense of our land system
only about two thousand dollars. The sales
have been entirely suspended In the South
ern States, while the interruptions to the
business of the country, and the diversion of
large numbers of men from labor to military
service have obstructed settlements la the
new States and Territories of the North
west. Tbe receipts of the Patent Office have de
olined In nine months, about 100,000 dollars,
rendering a large reduction ot the lorce em
ployed necessary to make it self sustaining.
The demand npou the Pension Office will be
hugely increased by the insurrection. Na-
marous applications for pensions based upon
tbe casualltles ot the existing war, have al
ready been made. There is reason to believe
that many who are now upon the Pension
Boll and la receipt pt the bounty of tbe
Government are in toe ranks of the
insurgent army or giving them aid and som?
fort The Seeretary of the Interior has
directed the suspension ef ths payment of the
pension of such persons, upon proof of their
disloyalty. I recommend tbat Congress au
thorize that officer to cause the names of such
persons to be stricken from the pension tolls.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
The relations of the Government vitb the
Indian tribes have been lately disturbed by
tbe Insurrection, especially in tee northern su
perin tendency, and in that of slew Mexico.
Tie Indian conntry south of Kansas is in
possession of insurgents from Texas and Ar.
k an sag. The agents of the United States, ap
pointed since the UU or March lor this gu
perintendency, have been nsabio to reach
their poets, while the most of tbost who
were in office before that time have espoused
the insurraotions-y cause, and assumed to
exercise the powers ot agents by virtue of
commissions from the insurrectionists. It
has been stated In the public press that a por
tion of these Indian bare been organized as
a military force and are attached to tho army
ot tbe insurgents, although the Government
has no official Information upon the subject
Letters have been written to the Commis
sioner of Indian affairs by several promipeot
chiefs, giving assurance of their loyalty to
the United States, and expressing the wish
for the presence of tbe Federal trosps to pro
tect tbem. It Is believed tbat on the re-pos-sessisn
of the country by the Federal forces,
ths Indians will readily cease all hostile de
monstrations and resume their former rela
tions to th Government
AGRICULTURE.
Agriculture, confessedly ths largest Inter
est ot the nation, ha not a department or a
bureau, but a clerkship only aaalgned to It lit
Government While it is fortunate that
this great Interest Is so Independent la it
naturo a not to hav demanded and extorted
more from th Government, I respectfully
aek Congress to considr whether something
more cannot U given voluntarily with gen
eral advantage. Annual reports exhibltins:
the condition of our agriculture, commerce
and manufacture would present a fond of
information of great practical value
to th country. While I make no
suggestion , as to - details, I - venture
the opinion that an agricultural and
statistical bureau mltrtit probably be or-
ganteed.- - .
THE SLAVE TRADE.
The execution of the laws for the
suppression of the African slave trade has
been confined to tbe Department of the In
terior. It U a subject ot congratulation that
th efforts which have been made for ths
suppression of this inhuman traffic have re
cently been attended with unusual success.
Five vessels being fitted out for the Slav
trade have been seized and condemned: two
master engaged in th trade, and on per
son equipping th vessel as a slaver ha
been convicted and subjected to tho penalty
of fine and imprisonment, and one captain
taking np a cargo of Africans on board bis
vessel has been convicted of ths highest
grade of offence nnder our laws, th punish
ment oi Which is death.
THE TERRITORIES.
Th Territories of Colorado, Dakotah and
Nevada, created by tbe last Congress, have
been organized, and civil administration
has been inaugurated therein nnder auspices
specially gratifying, when- it is considered
that ths leaven of treason was found existing
In some of these new countries when the
Federal officers arrived there. T he abundant
natural resources of these Territories, with
the security and protection afforded by or
ganized Government, will doubtless invite to
them a large Immigration when peace shall
restore tbe business of the conntry to Its ac
customed channels. I submit the resolutions
of the Legislature of Colorado, which
evinced the patriotic spirit of th people of
the territory. So far the authority of the
United Slates has been upheld in all the ter
ritories, as it la hoped It will be in the future,
I commend their interests and defence to th
onlightanedand generous care of Congress.
THE DISTRICT.
I recommend to the favorable consideration
of Congress th interest of the District of
Colombia. Tho indirection has been the
cause of much suffering and sacrifice to the
Inhabitants, and as they hav no representa
tive in Congress, that body should not over
look their just claims upon tbe Government
THE WORLD'S FAIR.
At your late session a joint resolution was
adopted authorising ths President to take
measures for facilitating a proper representa
tion, of the industrial interests of the
United States at the exhibition of the Indus
try of all nations, to be holden at London la
the year 1862. .1 regret to have been finable
to give personal attention to this subject,
subject at once so interesting in itself, and so
extensively and intricately connected with
tbe tnater'al prosperity of the world.
Through the Secretaries of the State and In
terlor a plan or system has been devised and
partly matured which will be laid before
you.
THE CONTRABAND QUESTION.
Under and by virtue of the act of Congress,
entitled an act to confiscate property used
for Insurrectionary purpose, approved Aujr.
6tb, 1861, legal claim of certi in persons to
the labor and service of certain other per.
sons have become forfeited, and numbers of
tbe latter thus liberated are already depend
ant on the United States, and most be
provided for in some way besides this.
It is not impossible that some . of tha
States will pass similar enactments for
their own benefit respectively, and by the
operations which persons of tbe same class
will be thrown upon them for disposal. In
such case I recommend tbat Congress pro
vide for accepting such persons from such
Stales, according to same mode of valuatior,
in lieu pro Umlo of direct taxes, or upon soma
other plan to be agreed upon with inch
State respectively; that loch persons
on inch acceptance by th Gen
eral Government, be at onos deemed
i free, and that in any event, steps be taken for
colonizing both olasse. or UwmiMt
tiooed if the other shall not be brought into
existence, at some plaee or places in a climate
congenial to them. It mlgnt be well to con
sider, too, whether the tree colored people
already In the United States could not, so far
as individuals may desire, be Included in such
colonization. To carry out the plan
of colonising may involve th acquiring
of territory, and also the appropnatioi
of money bsyond that to be expended in
tbe T erritiral aqulsition. Having practiced
the acquisition of Territory for nearly fifty
years, the question of Constitutional power
to do so is no longer an open one with us. The
power was hrst questioned by Mr. Jefferson,
who, however, In the purchase of Louisiana
yielded his scruples on the plea of great ex
pediency.
It has been said that the only legitimate
object of acquiring territory is to furnish
homes for white men. This measure effects
that object for the emigration ot colored
men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefl'er
mea leav.S additional room for white
son, however, placed tbe importance of pro
curing JUouisiana more on political and com
mercial grounds than on providing room for
population. On thi whole proposition, in
cluding the appropriation of money with tha
acquisition of territory, dees not the expe
diency amount to absolute necessity that
without which tbe Government cannot be
perpetual.
SUPPRESSION OF THE REBELLION.
In considering tha policy to be adopted for
suppressing the insurrection, I hav bean
anxious and careful that the inevitable con
flict for this purpose shall not degenerate in
to a violent and remorseless revolutionary
struggle. I have therefore, in every case.
thought it proper to keep ths Integrity of ths
l nion prominent as tne primary object or thi
contest on onr part, leaving all questions
which ar not or vital military importance to
the moredeliberato action of th legislature.
In tbe exercise of my best discretion. I
have adhered to the blockade of the port held
oy luc insurgents, losieuu or pniung ;n lore
by proclamation, the law or Congress enacted
at the late session, lor closing thos ports,
alw obeying the dictates of prudence as well
as tne ooiigauons oi law.
Instead of transcending I hav adhered to
the act of Congress to confiscate property
used for insurrectionary purposes. If a new
law upon th same subject should be pro
posed, its propriety will be duly considered.
Tbe Union must be preserved, and hence all
dispensable means most be employed.
we should not na la haste to determine what
radical and extreme measures which may
reach the3oyal as wejl as tha disloyal, are In
dispensable. The Inaugural address at ths beeinains? of
10 aoauoisirauon, ana ue Message to Con
gress at die Ute special session, Var both
mainly aevotea to tne domestic controversv.
out of which the insurrection and consequent
war nav sprung, nothing now occurs to
add or subtract to cr from th principle on
genera) purposes stated and expressed ia
uiose aocumep:.
SUPPRESSION OF THE REBELLION. A REVIEW.
The last ray of hope for preserving the
Union jeaceabiy expired at tha assault apqa
Fort Sasstor, and a general review of what
has occurred since may not be unprofitable.
What was painfully uncertain then, I much
better deined and hiore dfstjnat now, o4
the progress ot events is plainly in ths right
direction. - Th Insurgents confidently claim
ed a strong support from north of Masoa 4
Dixon's line, and tha friend of th Union
were not free from apprehension on this
point This, however, was soon settled defi
nitely and on the right side. South of the
Lisa noble little Delaware led off right from
the first . Maryland was mad to Mem
against tha Union. Our soldier were as
saulted, bridges wer burned and Railroad I
torn tip within bar limits, and ws wen ta&ay j
day at on tim without th ability to bring
a single Regiment over the soli to th Capi
tal, flow her bridges aud Railroads are re
paired and opened to' the Govern
ment She already gives seven Regi
ments to tha cans of ths Union and
none to th enemy, and bcr people at
regular election hav sustained th
Union by a large majority, and- a larger ag
gregate vote than they ever before gave to
any candidate or any question. Ken
tucky too, (or sometime in doubt, is
now decidedly, and I thlik unchangably
ranged on tha side of the Union. Missouri
is comparatively quiet, and I believe cannot
again be overran by th insurgent. These
three stt&tes, Maryland, Kentucky and Mis
souri, neither or which would promise a sin
gle soldier at first, nav now an agrrtgate of
not lee than 40,000 Id th field for ths
Union, while of thlr oltlsen not more than
a third in number ar among th insurgents,
and they ot doubtlul whereabouts and ex.
Ute nee.
After a somewhat bloody struggle of month
winter close on th Union people of West
era Virginia, leaving tbem masters of their
own conntry. A a insurgent fore of about
1500, tor month dominating tha narrow pe
ninsular region constituting tbe counties of
Aecomac ana Northampton and knows
the Eastern Shore of Virginia, together witn
soma contiguous parts of Maryland, have laid
down their arms and ths people there have
renewed their allegiance to and accepted the
protection of th old flag. Thi leave no
armed force north of the Potomac or east cf
th Chesapeake.
Also, w hav obtained a footing at each ot
th isolated points on the Southern coasts of
Hatteras, Port RoyaL Tybee Island near Sa
vannah, and Ship If land, and we .likewise
have some general accounts ot popular move
ments in behalf of the Union in North Caro
lina and Tennessee. These things demon
strate that the causa of the Union Is advanc
ing steadily southward.
GEN. SCOTT.
Sirne your last adjournment Lieut Gen.
Scott has retired from the head of the army.
During his long life the nation has not been
unmindful of his merit ; yet on calling to
mind how faithfully, ably and brilliantly ha
has served tha country, from a time far baok
in oar history, when lew of the now living had
been bom, and thenceforward continually,
I cannot bnt think that we are still his debtor.
I submit, therefore, for yoar consideration
what farther mark of recognition is due to
aim and ourselves as a grateful people.
GEN. McCLELLAN.
With the retirement of Gen. Scott came
the Executive duty of appointing in his
place a General-ln-Chlef of th army. It is
a fortunate circumstance that neither in
council nor country waa there, so far a I
know, any difference of opinion a to the
proper person to be selected. Tho retiring
chief repeatedly expressed - his judgment
in favor of Geo. McClellan for tbe position,
and in this the nation seemed to give
an unanimous concurrence. Tha designation
of Gen. MoClellaa Is therefore in a consider
able degree the selection of ths country as
well as of the Executive, and bene there is
better reason to hop there will be given
him the confidence and cordial support thos
by fair Implication promised, and without
which be cannot with so full efficiency rerve
the country. It ha been said that one bad
General Is bettor than t wo good ones, and th
Baying is true, if taken to mean no more than
that an army is better directed by a single
mind, though inferior, than by two superior
one at variance ani cross purposes, and the
same is true in all joint operations wherein
those engaged can have nene bnt a common
end in view, and can differ only as to th
choice of means. In a storm at tea no one
on board can wish the ships to sink, and yet
not antreqoently all go down together be
cause too many will direct, and no single mind
can be allowed to control. It continue to
develop that the Insnrreotlon ia largely
if not exclusively a war upon the first princi
ples of a popular Government and the rights
of the people. Oonolusiv evidence of this
I found in the most grave and maturely con
sidered public documents as well as lo the
general tone of the insurgents. In these
documents we find the abridgment of the
existing right of suffrage and th denial
the people of all right to participate in th
selection of public officers, except the legis
lative body, advocated with labored argu
meats to prove that large control ef the gov
ernment in the people la th so ore ef all po
uui wru. lnk; tuKir is someume
hinted at as a possible refuge froa the error
ot th people, in my present position
could scarcely be justified, were I to omit
raising a warning voice agalut thi ap-
ot returning despotism. .
CAPITAL AND LABOR.
It Is not needed, nor fitting here, tbat
general argument should be made in favor of
popular institutions, but there la one point
with It connections, not so hackneyed as
most others, to which I ak a brief attention.
It la the effort to place capital on an equal
footing with, if not above, labor, In the struc
ture ot government It Is assumed that la
bor is available only in connection with cap
ital: that nobody labors unless somebody
else, owning capital, somehow by the use of
It, Induces tbeai, to labor. This assumed
it is next considered whether U is best that
capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce
them to work by their own crnsent, or levy
them and drtv them to it without their con
ent Having proceeded so far it is natural
ly concluded that all laborers are either
hired laborers or what we call slaves, and
further, it is assumed that whoever is once a
hired laborer is fixed in that conditron for
ute.
Now there Is no such relation between
capital and labor as assumed, nor is there
any such thing as a freeman being fixed for
lite In the condition of a hired laborer.
Both of these assumptions are false, and all
inferences from them are groundless. Labor
is prior to and independent ot capital. Cap
ital is only the fruit of labor, and could nev
er have existed if labor had not first existed,
Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves
much ths higher consideration. Capital
has its rights which ar a worthy of pro tee
tion as any other rights. Nor is it denied
that there is, and probably always will be
relation between labor and capital producing
mutual benents. Tbe error is in assuming
that the whole labor of community exists
within that relation. A tew men own cap!
tal, and that few avoid labor, and with their
capital hire or buy a lew to labor for them.
A targe majority belong to neither class.
neither work for others, nor hav others
worklag for them. In most of the
Southern States a majority of the
whole people of all color are neith-
slaves nor master, while in the Notth-
era a large majority are neither hirers
nor hired men. Men with their families,
wives, sons and daughters, work for them
selves on their farms, in their houses, and in
their shop, taking th whole product to
themselves, and asking no favor of capital
on the on band, nor of hired laborers or
slaves on ths othar. It is not forgotten that
considerable number of Deraona mintrln
their own labor with capital ; that Is, they
labor with their own hands and, also buy or
h)rj others to hbp,r for them; but this Is
only a mixed and aot a distiost class. No
principle stated is dlsturbexf by th existence
of thia mixed class. : Again, as has already
been said, there is not of necessity any such
thing as th free hired laborer being fixed
for that condition for life. Many independ
ent mea everywhere in these 'State a few
years back in their live were hired laborers.
Th prudent, penniless beggar in the world
labors for wages awbil and saves a I urpios
with which to boy tools or land for blmseli,
then labors on his own account and at length
hires another new beginner to help him.
Tbls Is the just, and genesoof and preeperoos
system which opens the way to all, gives
hope to all and oonsequsnt energy, progress
and improvement of the coodHk-t) tg alj. No
men liviig are mere worthy to be trusted
than those who toil up or on fiom poverty,
none leu inclined to tak or touch acgat
bich they hav not honorably earned- Let
tbem beware of Surrendering a political power
which they already'poseeei. and!which if sur
rendered will sorely be used to oloee the door
of advancement against soch a they, and to
is.-es
if
fix new disabilities and burden npoa them
tU all of liberty shall be lost
Frem the Erst taking of oer national cen
sus to ths last, are 70 years, and w find our
population at the nd of th period eight
" ' great a it wss at the beginning.
The Increase of those othar thinn
hlch men deem desirable, ha been
even greater. We thus have . at .. on
view what the popular prindole anolled to
tha uovernment through th machinery of
uie ouhcs, ana ine union baa produced Id
a given time, and also what if firmly
maintained It promises fox the future.
There are already among us those who,
u zoo union De preserved, will live to
see it contain 150,000,000. The struggle of
to-oay i not aitogetoer ror to-day, it is 'or
a vast futhre also. With a firm relifinee in
Providence all the more firm and earnest let
as proceed in the great task which events
have devolved npoa as.
