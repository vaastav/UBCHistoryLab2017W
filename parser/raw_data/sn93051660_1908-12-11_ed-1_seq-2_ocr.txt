THE PRESIDENTS' MESSAQE
President Roosevelt's annual
message was transmitted to both
houses of Congress Tuesday. It
is a voluminous and exhaustive
document, treating mainly of
the public measures and needs
which Congress has failed to
provide effective laws for during
all the Presidents' administra
tion. The recommendations
made by the President are nu
merous and, if Congress would
enact legislation in accordance
witli the suggestions of the ex
ecutive, the entire nation would
be much benefitted. Among the
most important recommenda
tions are those pertaining to the
national control of combinations ;
the supervision of all railroads
by the Interstate Commerce
Commission; the limit of the
power of injunction and other
salutary measures for the bene
fit of labor; the preservation of
forests and all natural resources;
the improvement of inland wa
terways; the establishment of
postal savings banks and of local
parcels post on rural routes; the
Federal control of fisheries; the
improvement of the army and
navy; the granting of American
citizenship to Porto Ricans; the
admission of Arizona and New
Mexico as separate states and
many other sensible suggestions
for the good of the nation. It
is not at all probable that Con
gress will do any of the good
things recommended by the
President for the reason that the
time will be spent in a senseless
attempt to get even. More's the
rity-
THE CHRISTMAS SHOPPER
The Christmas shopper and
that means everyone who has a
dollar to spend in the Christmas
season is the annual recipient
of abundar.t advice as to the ad
vantages of early shopping. In
a number of cities the promulga
tion of this advice has taken or
ganized form. We have what are
termed "Consumers' Leagues,"
originating, as we believe, in
Philadelphia, the principal pur
pose of which seems to be to en
courage and persuade the pros
pective buyer of Christmas gifts
to buy early and avoid the rush.
The advice is positively good- It
appeals to the sober common
sense of every person; and to ac
cept it and act upon it is demon
strably advantageous to mer
chants, clerks and the purchasing
public. To what extent does it
become effective?
This is a question that is best
answered by the individual pur
chaser. It is a question which
the individual purchaser should

regard as concerning himself or
herself. It really suggests an
individual duty and service of
self interest that, properly appre
ciated, would make the advice
most effective. 'r
-The advantages of early Christ
mas buying to all concerned have
been dwelt uponlso frequently
and so fully as to preclude rhe
utterance of anything new.on the
subject." The better service to
the buyer from the greater leisure
of the seller; the avoidance of the
cruel nervous strain and physical
fatigue of the time-honored
Christmas rush have been forci
bly and convincingly presented.
Bat all this goes for naught, un
less each person who intends to
buy Christmas goods shall con
sider the counsel as a matter of
individual concern. Suppose that
we should abandon the idea that
the suggestion of early buying
was intended for that indefinite
aggregation known as the gener
al public, and that we were to
consider, each in his individual
capacity, that it . was meant for
us; thar. the advantage was ours
and was worth the while. What
would follow? v The Christmas
holiday, in its practical aspects,
would be rationally observed; in
most appreciative manner we
would do ourselves a benefit and
evince our good will toward all
others.
THE NEXT GOVERNOR
Prominent Men Mentioned as
Candidates.
There is now considerable
guessing being done by state
politicians as to who will be the
next candidate for Governor of
Oregon. While the Secretary
of State will fill out Governor
Chamberlain's unexpired term,
in the event of the Governor be
ing elected to the United States
Senate, still the next general
election is not so far distant and
fence building has already been
commenced to corral the big
prize.
Among the prominent Repub
licans who have thus far been
mentioned for the office are the
names of S. L. Kline, of Corval
lis, president of the Oregon Re
tail Grocers' Association; Dr.
James Withycombe, of OAC,
Corvallis; ex-State Senator C.
W. Ilodson, president of the
Portland Commercial Club; J,
II. Ackerman, State Superin
tendent of Public Instruction;
J. W. Bailey, State Food and
Dairy Commissioner; Dr. An
drew C. Smith, former State
Senator; Thomas Ryan, of Ore
gon City, and District Attorney
George J. Cameron. The Demo
crats thus far have given pref
erence to State Railway Com
missioner Oswold West; Mayor
Harry Lane, of Portland, and
ex-District Attorney John Man
ning. llie mention of the name of
La irao asff Bangjm, TdDtD
considering the problem of t
S. L Kline for the highest office
in the state is a compliment both
to that gentleman and to his'
home city. Mr. Kline has a wide
acquaintance throughout the
state and his position as---presi-dent
of the Oregon Retail Groc
ers' and ; Merchants Association
has brought him into personal:
contact with the ' leading, busi
ness men of the commonwealth.
Should he receive the nomina-.
tion and be elected, there is no
question but what he would give
Oregon a conservative and business-like
administration, while
his loyalty to r the Republican
party is unquestionable.
MONEY FOR ROADS
Preciucts of Benton County
Raise Special Fond.
The people of Benton county
are becoming more and more
interested in the vital subject of
good roads. This is evidenced
by the fact that the various pre
cincts in the county have volun
tarily taxed their respective
propertj' owners, and raised a
special fund from the levy, of
$y,929.74 for the purpose of im
proving the public roads.
The regular road and bridge
fund of the county now amounts
to $15,137.27 and with the spec
ial levy referred to will make
$25,067.01 available for road and
bridge work.
Last year the road and bridge
levy was two mills, but the court
this year has under considera
tion a levy of five mills and this,
with the constantly increasing
value of property in Benton
county, will treble the available
road fund and make possible the
permanent improvement of the
highways.

Read this letter from Mr. R. A.
Rollins, a prominent orchardist
of the Flathead, Valley
"Delicious (Stark Delicious) has proven
a success with me and have been foootaing
it for three years. At the State Farmers'
Institute Meeting held at Rollins June 26,
1908, at which were present, Hon. Fred
Whiteside, Prof. Linfield, Mgr. Experi
ment Station, Prof. Wilcox and others,
I exhibited Delicious apples as sound as
when taken from the trees the previous
fall. The flavor was still excellent. I
have therefore, with good reason, given
Delicious a reputation in this valley."
