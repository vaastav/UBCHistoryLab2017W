BUENOS AiRES FINDS IT
SUFFERS FROM WIS
Officials Discover Corporation Men
ace Right at Home After a
, Year's Investigation.
BfKN'OS AIRES, November 20 (Cor
despondence of the Associated Press).?A i
committee of the chamber of deputies |
has discovered after more than a i
year's investigation that Argentina is (
afflicted with "trusts." Wine, flour. !
lime, potatoes, meat and oil and J
naphtha are described in a rece nt re-j
port of the committee as under the,
control of "trusts." which have been j
able to flourish and maintain hitrh 1
prices chiefly because of hiph pro- ,
s tective tariffs or favorable railroad i
' rates, it is charged.
The committee finds that the "most |
typical 'trust'" in Argentina (the;
word "trust" is put in quotation j
marks throughout the report) is the j
"wine trust" in the proat prape-prow- J
Ing province of Mendoza on the slopes
of the Andes. It is charped that this
combination of wine producers is an
"official trust organized by the law of
the province," which is able to pay
the cost of the greater part of its
Administration out of "the local privi
lfpe created by the monopoly of
wine."
Destruction of grapes and wine, ex
portation of wine at a low price and
maintenance of a high price in Ar
gentina are alleged. The "trust" is
able to exist, the report says, by vir
tue of high customs duties, which
discourage the Importation of ordi
nary wines, and by the aid of the
national banks. Reform In the ad
ministration of the banks and in the
tariff laws is demanded.
Standard Oil on the Job.
The committee nnmes the Standard
Oil Company of the United States as the
"trust" which controls kerosene and
nanhtha in Argentina.
The report sets forth that this " 'trust'
Xorteomericano del petroleo" has In Ar
gentina a "powerful subsidiary com
pany, divided in its legal aspect into
one section of production, another of
marketing and transport."
Argentina'* Defense.
"The commercial practices of this
! 'trust.' " says the report, "are those of
a monopoly which wishes, to extend
even more and consolidate.
1 "There Is no proof that the 'trust' has
determined upon increasing the price of
kerosene and naphtha in this country, but
it is certain that its prices represent a
relative increase; that is to say. with
relation to the cost of production."
Argentina's defense against "this in
ternational and almost world-wide mon
opoly." the committee says, consists of
encouraging commerce in and produc
tion of all other materials capable of
l.roduring light and heat and develop
ing the production of petroleum as a
government enterprise, "since every pri
vate enterprise will be annihiliated or
absorbed by the trust." "
"Motherhood insurance," which has
been in successful operation for some
years in the Scandinavian countries,
is about to be given iis first practical
trial in the Unite-.! States by the
American Woolen Company, whose
plan will assure every prospective
mother in its employ of four weeks'
benefits without any cost to her.

NEW RAIL EQUIPMENT IS
NOW NATIONAL NECESSITY
?President Elliott of N. V. Says It
Will Be Needed to Avert Still
Higher Cost of Living.
NEW YORK, December 5. ? New
railroad equipment costing approxi
mately $3,000,000,000 must be bought
within the noxJ^ few years if the
American peopldRre to avert a still
higher cost of living, said Howard
KUiott, president of the Northern Pa
cific Railroad Company, before the
reconstruction conference of the As
sociation of Life Insurance Presidents
here.
Mr. KUiott, who spoke on the sub
ject, "The Efficient Transportation
Machine a National Necessity," said
that there could be no higher func
tion for the great life insurance com
panies at the present time than to
make it plain to all the people that
"our railroads must not be crippled,
but on the contrary they must keep
abreast of the times and be prepared
to serve the great and growing future
of the country."
The speaker said that without an in
crease in freight and passenger rates
a very large number of railroad com
panies would face bankruptcy and
that very few of those who escaped
would be able to pay stockholders
Th? rear would end, there was every
indication, he said, with a deficit o!
perhaps $350,000,000 for all railroad
operations. The country cannot have
an efficient transportation machine
nor can investments in railroad se
curities be protected, he said, unles:
the roads are given higher compensa-.
tion to maintain them efficiently,
Declaring that even today, in the
months of heaviest business, the
nation's transportation machine was
operated virtually at capacity arid
that there was no very small margin
of safety." Mr. Elliott said that the
American standard of living must de
cline if the general development of
the railroads were checked.
"The people cannot survive without
the railroads and our railroads can
not survive without our people," he j
concluded. "They go hand in hand foi
good or ill."

SUPPORT EQUAL RIGHTS BILL.
V
National Women's Trade Union
Leagne Writes to Mr. McLean.
Support of Senator McLean's_ bill
providing that women shall have
equal opportunity with men in ap
pointments to federal civil service!
positions by the National Women's
Trade Union League is assured, ac
cording to Mrs. Raymond Ilobins,
president, and Miss Agnes Nestor ot
the league, in a letter sent to Sen
ator McLean.
"Women have struggled for years
and are still struggling for equal
rights and equal compensation with
men in industry," says the letter to
Senator McLean. "To have the prin
ciple of equality written into the law
of the land will affect not only the
women now and in future to be em
ployed by the government, whom it
directly concerns, but all women who
must earn their living in any occu
pation whatsoever."
NO NEW LINES TO ORIENT
IN IMMEDIATE FUTURE
Chairman Payne of Shipping Board
Tells Pacific Delegation All
Possible Will Be Done.
Because of the shortage of pas
senger vessels and the fact that the
refitting of the former German liners
will require three months. It will be
some time before any new passenger
lines can be 'established between the
Pacific coast and the orient. Chairman
lJayne of the shipping board told a
delegation of Pacific coast shipping
and business men yesterday. He said,
however, that the board would bend
every effort to relieve the situation as
quickly as possible.
Charles O. Moore of San Francisco,
chairman of the delegation. told Mr
Payne that American trade with the
orient was three times as great as
that with South America, and that
American business was greatly handi-,
capped bv the lack of passenger facli/
ities. Practically all of the passengyr
traiiic to the orient is handled by for
eign shipping companies, he said./
The first woman ever appointed col
lector of internal revenue was Mrs. S.
M. Parker, who received the ;uPpoim
ment ill the fourth Indiana diArict in
1873. \
