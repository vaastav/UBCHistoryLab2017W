President Wilson's message to
congress the pungent talk of a
business man who' knows exactly
what he is talking about.
Anyone who still fears we are
about to rush into militarism
hasn't interpreted recent political
events the way they can be put.
Christmas for Logan county
children should be exceptionally
happy thin year. The "good fel
lows" will contribute funds to
make it so.
The builders of the Republic
were pretty thoughtful, after all,
in keeping congress at something
else until the country 'was made
safe.
"A country that has only one
Lloyd-George," moralizes the K
C Star, "is in the same fix with
the country that has only one
Theodore Roosevelt." Wly drag
in Lloyd-George!

tion between being forced into
service by one government and

folks as it seems to be to others.
The McAlester News-Capital
has come to the conclusion the
best way to settle the Mexican
trouble would be for Pershing's
force to go and get Villa and his
band. If Carranza can not appre
ciate the favor, let him make the
most of it, says the Capital.
