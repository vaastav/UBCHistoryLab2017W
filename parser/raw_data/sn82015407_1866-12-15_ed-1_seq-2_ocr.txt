IDAHO WORLD.
JA 8. O'MEARA,
: EDITOR.
SATURDAY, DECEMBER 15. 1866.
President's Message. —The synopsis given
of this important document is too meagre for
fair comment, bat we most heartily approve
bis sentiments and recommendations in the
closing paragraph, as published; But
may as well whistle against Soltis as talk
reason to that Radical Congress.
Quite Alike.— The Radical Congressional
Caucus have a Committee of Ten to manage
and execute their fanatical and malignant de
signs and deeds. There was once, in old
Venice, a Council of Ten. Every reader of
history knows of the bad acts and secret
crimes of that body. That and the Ten
this day differ only in nationality, language
aad time. Very appropriately named Ten.
• Contemptible. —In a long article review
ing the murder of Dr. Robinson in Salt Lake
City lately, the 8. P. Times, (chief Radical
organ) while admitting that the cause of the
of the people was very ably put forward in
the examination into the affair, meanly
enough fails to mention the fact that Gov.
John B. Weller managed it. Had Gov. Wel
ler been a Radical we may be sure the Times
would have given him a column laudatory
notice. !
:—?
Radical Logic. —Because we called atten
tion last weej| to the suppression of Demo
cratic papers iu the North during the war,
aud contrasted the principle involved with
the howlings of the Radicals, now that pa
pers of that kind are not permitted in Mo
bile, the Boise Statesman tries to make it
appear that we favor mobbiog and suppress
ing " a loyal free press in the South." Only
a rogne or an idiot would place such a con
struction on onr language. The Statesman
can decide tbis point for itself. We are not
in the Vigilante habit of mobbing either pa
pers or persons.
Correction.— In copying from one of the
the Territorial papers the list of the mem
bers of the Council and Assembly, we also
copied two errors which appeared in the list,
In the political classification of tbe members,
namely, in placing Hon. M. A. Carter of the
Council, and Hon. H. Ohle of tbe Assembly,
both of Oneida county, among the Radicals.
Both of these gentlemen have requested us to
say that they have never been Radicals, and
rank themselves •" with that party which
gives encouragement and support to tbe Ad
ministration of Andrew Johnson, in opposr
tion to the Radical sentiment of tbe'couutry."
X We most cheerfully do these gentlemen the
justice they request, in making tbis correc
tion, and give them hearty greeting in the
patriotic stand they occupy.
Military Movements.— By late orders of
Major General Halleck, Military Commander
of this coast, Lieut. Col. Marshall bas been
relieved of the command of the District of
Boise, and directed to report to Gen. Steele,
at his headquarters in Portland. Brevet Ma
jor General Crook is appointed to succeed
Lieut. Col. Marshall in the command of tbis
District, and 1st Lieut. Nickerson and 2d
Lieut. Greene are ordered to report to him at
Fort Boise, for duty. While we accord am
ple credit to the retiring commander for hav
ing performed his duty well and faithfully,
and to the full extent of bis means, we join
iu welcoming the new commander to the post.
We have known him by reputation for many
years, and know something .of his valuable
services in the frontier districts of California
and Oregon, where he acquired a goodly ex
perience in Indian warfare, and in every po
sition or emergency proved himself to be a
thorough soldier and most capable officer.—
Under Gen. Crook's command, we are strong
in tbe belief that an effective and determined
course will be pursued against the savage
pests who infest this whole district, and that
our citizens will, in fair time, be better se
cured, in their property and life, from Indian
raids.
Surratt's Arrest. —The dispatches give
intelligence that an U. S. Consul General in
Lgypt has arrested John H. Surratt, and that
he is to be sent to Washington in a Govern
ment vessel. This last item alone will cost
over $50,000. And for what bas be been
arrested? It is said, for complicity in the
killing of Abraham Lincoln. Why, it is dow
thoroughly known that Stanton, Holt, and
the Military Commission on that event, abso
lutely murdered the innocent mother of this
young man, and that Stanton and Holt pro
cured and paid large sums of the public
money to perjured witnesses, whom they ob
tained to swear away the life of Mrs. Surratt,
to 8wear to the complicity of this son, and
also to convict the unfortunate men who
suffered with Mrs. Surratt. If the object in
arresting and bringing to the country this
yopng man Surratt is to use him as a prose
cuting witnegs agpjastStantoprHolt, and the
other chief jaurtfog/ä his mother, the
people willjf Jfy pay their share of the
great exn^$^^jmisequent upon the arrest
/sportatlon,—such atrocious raurdvr
î a^eitlrer Éjkaton or Holt ought to be
roughtto justice at any cost ; but if it is to
ijrepeat tbe mock trial and commit another
military or legal morder, in Surratt's own
case, tbe people will be likely to see to tbe
thing, and to the military or legal murderers
also,XX ;
THE RAD.CAL CONGRESS.
The reflective, rational reader of the pro
ceedings of Congress, as reported in the dis
patches of tbe week, must be convinced thaï
the insanity of Radicalism reigns supreme in
both branches of that body. Even in tbe
Senate, to which tbe people used to look for
grave deliberation, profound wisdom, and
high statesmanship, the base and malignant
passions of the day seem to have deepest
root, and are developed with most obdurate
proscriptiveness. Tbe whole land groans
and sweats under the most oppressive bur
dens—enormous taxes, a stupendous public
debt, and vital disorders in the great body
politic ; yet it is not to relieve the country, or
to ameliorate the condition of the toiling and
suffering millions, that the Senate proceeds ;
bat the recognized Radical leader in that
body, Sumner of Massachusetts, totally dis
regarding the most urgent interests of tbe
people, and ignoring the traditional and con
stitutional rights of citizens, hastens to bis
chronic agitation of tbe negro question, and
his first motion in this Congress is to procure
the elective franchise for negroes in tbe Dis
trict of Columbia. This action he follows by
other efforts about equally divided between
the elevation aud glorification of the negro,
tbe persecution and debasement of the South,
and the overthrow of the President. He
lately declared that none but " loyal" papers
ought to be allowed anywhere in the land
and yet be bad always, prior to the installa
tion of his own party to power, vehemently
clamored for the wildest license to the press
every portion of the Uuion. So, now
while he professes to battle for " impartial
and universal suffrage," and " absolute equal
ity before the laws for all, without distinc
tion of race or color," we find in the class of
bills he presents for the action of Congress
he seeks actually to invest only the negro and
Northern born whites.to the full measure of
these rights and privileges, and to proscribe
early all tbe whites of the South, and the
whole foreign born, naturalized population
from the enjoyment of them. And tbe Rad
ical Senate almost implicitly follows the lead
or slavishly obeys the dictation of Sumner.
The proceedings in the House also clearly
manifest the spirit and intention of the Radi
cals in that body. The demoniac Tbad
Stevens, the Devilshoof of the fanatics, rules
the roast, and nearly every measure so far
broached bears the impress of his diabolically
malignant nature. The steps toward tbe im
peachment of the President ; the disregard of
the Constitution iu tbe mad eagerness to di
vest the President of all power to appoint or
remove Federal officials, and to absolutely
and forever confiscate and declare forfeited
►the lands of the people of the South; and to
reduce the Southern States to territorial con
dition, with the actual citizens divested of
the right of suffrage and of all the rights and
privileges appertaining to freemen therein,
while all these rights and privileges are per
mitted to negroes and emigrant whites,—all
plainly reveal the destroying hand of extreme
Radicalism, which is hurrying on the country
to anarchy, chaos and another terrible war.
We call the attention of the conservative
men of that party, who have cast their lot
in tbis remote region, to deliberate upon the
action of the Radical Congressional caucus,
whereiu tbe members proceeded so speedily
toward the appointment of special commit
tees to investigate the killing of some negroes
and white Radicals in tbe New Orleans Con
vention riot of last summer, and also to look
into the pardoning of some persons in South
Carolina who had been sentenced to death for
killing three Federal soldiers from Maine.
During the pts.st year—and for many years
the same facts are true—hundreds of whites,
men, women and children, have been slaugh
tered in the vast regions west of the .Missis
sippi, while on their way to or from this
coast, or in their new prairie or mountain
homes, and vast amounts of property have
been stolen or destroyed, all by the savages
who infest these distant regions. Congress
has been appealed to in past years to adopt
measures for tbe protection of our people, and
the punishment of the marderous Indians.
To this day Congress has not only not taken
any action in the matter, but turned a deaf
ear to the appeals. The present Congress is
not ignorant of these facts. Yet, while it
ignorant
pays no heed to the numerous massacres by
Indians of white men, women and children,
on the plains and in these far-western terri
tories, its Radical members rush to the work
which promises them an opportunity to shed
more Southern blood by mean3 of military or
Freedmen's Bureau mock trials, to further
glut their hatred of the Southern people, and
wreak their cruel vengeance on the helpless
ones they have already robbed and ruined.
There are now languishing in British dun
geons scores of Irishmen who are citizens of
tbe United States, and who perilled their
lives in fighting "the war for the Union,"
when cowardly natives, who were Radicals
and urged on tbe war, dared not face the for
midable Confederate foe. The lives of some
oftbe8e unhappy men have been declared
forfeited to the law by British courts. We
remember when, under a Democratic Admin
istration, Martin Kotza, the Hungarian refu
gee, wbo had barely declared his intention to
become an American citizen, was held pris
oner by the mighty power of Austria, his im
mediate release and surrender to the United
States was made and enforced. Butthose days
have passed away. The prisoners who suffer
in British prisons are Irish adopted citizens,
and the Congress now s"upreme is Radical. If
no other reasons existed why Congress, while
appointing special committees to bring pun
ishment upon the citizens of the South in re
venge for tbe killing of a few negroes, failed
to intercede iu behalf of the Fenian prisoners
in Canada, the fact that they are Irishmen,
not negroes, is sufficient. All Irishmen woi
thy of the name will remember this«

At Chipman's Drug Store, corner of Main and
Wallstreets, can always be obtained the best of
drugs, chemicals, medicines, prescriptions and all
kinds of perfumeries, toilet articles, and the
countless other things he has to sell.
Clothing. —Louis Emanuel, west side of Main
street, will fit you out in as fine, neat and cheaply
priced a suit of clothes, with underclothing, fur
nishing articles, boots, hat, gloves and all—full
rig, from head to foot—as anybody, or any other
man. Go and try, and try on, till he proves to yon
that he is lightning on fits—in the clothing way.
J. W. ^'ood & Co. have an immense stock of
assorted merchandise, carefully selected expressly
tor this market, of groceries, clothing, furnishing
articles, boots, shoes and hats, They have some
of the finest tobacco ever seen on this coast, and
their large lot of brandy and whiskey is of the
best from the San Francisco market;
Inauspicious. —Already tbe Times, the new
great organ of the Radicals in San Francisco,
has undergone a change of managing editors
—McClatchey having been dismissed, and
Noah Brooks (the "Castiue" of the Sacra
meuto Union a few years ago) appointed in
his place. The Times was too big a puddle
for McClatchey to swim in—he could only
flounder. It is said he will start a small
evening (daily) paper in San Francisco. The
Times is not likely to last long, knowing
ones say.
Holiday Toys.— A holiday week without its
usual time-memorial presentations to the " little
folks," is a gloomy and dreaçy thing to consider.
The house wherein the jolly, cheery, generous old
Santa Claus or Kris Kringle comes not, neither on
Christmas Eve nor New Year's Eve, with*his pre
cious stores of toys and goodies to stuff into the
tiny stockings of the expectant, nervously-anxious
little ones, is not a glad or happy home. But we
trust there will not be houses of that sort in this
community in the approaching, nearly holiday
week. And to guard against failure on the part
of any, to see that Santa Claus shall remember
their "wee lolk," Messrs. Yale <fc Blake, at the
Post Office Bookstore, have on sale a very full,
rare, pretty and attractive assortment of toys, gift
articles, presentation books for young ladies, nice
souvenirs for persons of every age. An early visit
at their store will secure the best selections.
Indicted.— Page, Watson ancl Murphy, the
bogus dust operators arrested in Boise City and
here a few weeks ago, have been indicted by the
Grand Jury of Ada county. Page and Watson
were arraigned in the District Court in Boise
City early in the week, and entered the plea of
not guilty." A s eparate trial was, after argu
ment, granted the pair. Page was on trial at last
advices. " Captain" Murphy has been in jail
here all the time. He will be taken to Boise City
for trial.
Yonr narrow-minded partisanship and proscrip
tiveness led you to expect a "big thing" iu the
Governor's Message in the way of "political cap
ital."—j Boise Statesman.
Your own ponderous broad-hoofed understanding
suggested that.

Photographs.— Loved and dear ones far away
often place morè value upon the photograph of the
"wanderer" from the old family group, or of the
fond absent one, than upon the most beautiful or
rich gift that can be sent them. And the wander
ers and absent ones in this community can luckily
obtain at Junk & Co.'s Photographic Gallery, just
above the Post Office, ou Main street, as fine a
likeness, of the latest style of picture, as can bo
taken anywhere. They employ a new patent fin
ishing process which adds much to the beauty a*
well as durability of their pictures.
