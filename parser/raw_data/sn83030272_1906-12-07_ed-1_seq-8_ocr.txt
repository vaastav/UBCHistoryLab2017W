the Reichstag will approve of the proposed

tain to be made on behalf of tho countries
tries which have had to purchase bylarge

There i no doubt that the Germantariff
tariff law unless again suspended byimperial

ports from the United States to paythe
the maximum duties after the presentprovisional
provisional arrangement shall haveexpired
expired next spring This i known ofcourse
course t Mr ROOSEVELT and if hoomitted
omitted to mention the matter in his message
sage it was because he recognized thohopelessness
i t hopelessness of procuring the Senatessanction

t p of Congress lie could not have foreseen

put upon his silence by a member of thoBritish

We attach no credit to the suggestionthnt
that President ROOSEVELT may haveentered

that our commerce with Great Britainis

Treasury Department has been dealingwith
with a real yellow peril of n purelycommercial

and it the attention

tion of tho Government first in tho earlypart

could not grant and it ruled that thopaihphlets

Tho situation is explained fully byMr IIr

alone keeps Japanese publishers fromforcing

the message before Congress has had an opportunity

Just now the California school question isprominent
prominent not to say acute The Presidenttakes
takes a position that assumes the Japaneseto
to be right and the school authorities of theState
State to b wrong and he even goes so faras
a to Intimate that he may Use the militaryto
to compel the admission of Japanese to theschools
schools Naturally the Japanese Government
ment will think It has some rights In theaffairs
affairs of our country which the local authorities
ities have denied and violated This attitudeof
of the President amounts to rendering judgment
ment In favor of the Japanese althoughwhether
whether or not they have any such rights canonly
only be ascertained by an examination of thetreaty
treaty and also the consideration of whatpower
power the Federal Government has over theschool
school systems of the StatesFor
For the President to fulminate and detonateat
at the State of California Is highly ImproperHe
He thereby gives the Japanese an advantageand
and commits the country 8 far as It can becommitted
committed by his acts A wise course wouldbe
be to leave to Congress the consideration ofsuch
such matters as are within Its province andIn
In a proper case < Invoke the authority ofthe
the courts and abide by their decision andnot
not assume In a message to Congress thatthe8tate
the State Is wrong and that the Japanese areright
right I write this not In the spirit of unfaircriticism
