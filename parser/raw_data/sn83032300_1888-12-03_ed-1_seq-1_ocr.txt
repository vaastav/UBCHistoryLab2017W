WASHlwaTOir, Dm 3. President Cleve
land's annual message Bant te Congress
today opens with review of the. material
pregres- el the country daring the flnrt
eentury of Ita existence as a nation, and an
exhaustive argument in favor of tariff
revision. Nearly one-fourth of the mes
ssge la devoted te a consideration of theee
topics. The preeldent says t
a yen auamble for the discharge of the
duties you have assumed aa the repreoen repreeen
tatlvea of a tree and generous people, yenr
meeting la marked byan Interesting and
Impressive incident With the expiration
of the present session of the Congress, the
first century of our constitutional existenee
as a nation will be completed.
Onr survival for one hundred years la
net sufficient te assure us that we no longer
have dangers te fear In the maintenance,
with all Its premised blessings, of a govern
ment founded upon the freedom of the
people. The time rather admonishes ua te
soberly Inquire whether In the put we
have always closely kept In the course of
safety, and whether we have before ua a
way plain and dear which Ieada te happi
ness ana perpetuity.
When the experiment of ourgevernment
was undertaken, the chart adopted for our
guidance was the constitution. Departure
from the lines there laid down la a failure.
Jtia only by a atrlet adherence te the
direction they Indicate and by restraint
within the limitations tbey fix that we can
furnish proof te the world of the fltmsi of
the American people for aelf-geverrnvnt.
The equal and exact Jnattee of wh eh we
beast aa the underlying principle ei ur
Institutions, should net be confined te tee
relatiene of our cltlmns te eaeh ether. Tee
government itself is under bend te the
American people, that In the exercise el
Ita funotlens and powers it will deal wltb
the body of our citizens In a manner
acrupuleuily henestand fair and absolutely
J ait. It has agreed that American citizen
ship shall be tne only credential necessary
te justify the elalm of equality before the
law, and that no condition in life snail
give rise te discrimination in the treatment
of the people by their government
SIMPLE GOVERNMENT IK EARLY DATS
The citizen of our republle In ita early
days rigidly insisted upon full oempll
anas with the letter of hla bend and aaw
atretehlng out before him a clear field for
Individual endeavor. Hla tribute te the
auppert of hla government was meaaured
by the cost of ita economical maintenance,
and he was secure in the enjoyment of the
remaining recompense of his steady and
oentented toil. In these daya the frugality
of the people was atamped upon their
government and was enforced by the free,
thoughtful and Intelligent suffrage of
the citizen. Combinations, monopolies and
aggregations el eipltal were either avoided
or sternly regulated and restrained. The
pomp and glitter of governments leas free,
eHered no temptation and presented no
delusion te the plain people, who, aide by
aide, In friendly competition wrought for
the enneblement and dignity of man, for
the solution of the problem of free govern
ment and for the achievement of the grand
destiny awaiting the land which Cled had
given them.
A eentury has pawed. Oar cities are the
abiding places et wealth and luxury ; our
manufaoterleayleld fertunesnever dreamed
of by the fatbera of the republle; our
bualeess men are madly striving in 'hi
race for rlebes, and immense aggregatle.
et capital outrun the imagination in the
magnitude of their undertakings.
We view wltb pride and sstlafaetlcn thla
bright picture el our country 'a growth and
prosperity, while only a dener scrutiny de
velops a sembie shading Upen mere
careful inspection we find the wealth and
luxury et our cities mlDgled with poverty
and wretehedness andunremuneratlve tell.
A crowded and constantly Increasing urban
population auggeata the Impoverishment
of rural aeotlene, and discontent with agri
cultural puraulta The farmer's eon, net
satisfied with bis father's simple and labe
rlnus life, joins the eager chase for easily,
acquired wealth.
We discover that the fortunes realized
by our manufacturers are no longer solely
the reward et sturdy industry and en
lightened terealgbt, but that they result
from the discriminating favor of the govern
meat, and are largely built up en undne
taxatlena from the masses of our people.
The gulf between employers and the em
ployed li constantly widening and claatca
aie rapidly forming, one comprising the
very rieh and powerful while in another
are found the telling peer.
OPFBKBSBD BT TRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES.
Aa we view the achievements of aggre
gated capital, we discover the existence of
units, oemotnattona and monopolies, while
the citizen is struggllng'fsr In the rear or Is
trampled te death beneath an Iren heel.
Corporations, wbleh abeuld be the carefully-restrained
creatures et the law and
the servanta et the people, are fast becoming
the people's master.
Btill congratulating ourselves upon the
wealth and prosperity of our country and
complacently contemplating every Inci
dent of ehange lnseperabte from these oon eon oen
dltlonr, it Is our duty as patriotic eltlzsna
te Inquire, at the present stage et our
progress, hew the bend of the government
made with the people has been kept and
performed.
Instead of limiting the tribute drawn
from our citizens te the neeeasltlea of ita
economical aaministrauen, me government
persists In exaetlng from the substance of
the people millions, wbleh unspplled and
raeleas lie dormant In Ita treaaury. This
flagrant Injustice and this breach of faith
and obligation add te extortion the danger
amending the diversion of the currency of.
the oesuiry from the legitimate ebannels of
business. , . . , . ..
Under the same lawa by which these
results are produeed, the government per
mits many millions mete te be added te
the coat et the living of our people and te
be taken from our consumer, whleh un
reasonably awell the profits of a email but
powerful minority.
The people must still be taxed for the
support of the government under the opera
tionef tarilTlawa. But te the extent that
the maie of our citizens are Inordinately
burdened beyond any usetul public
purpose and for the benefit et a favored
kw the government under pretext et
an exerelse of Ita taxing power enter gratu
lteualy lntepartnerahlp with theae favorites
te their advantage ana te the injury of a
vast msjexlty ei our people.
This is net equality before the law. The
existing altuatlen is injurious te the health
et our entire body politic It stifles In
these for whose benefit It U permitted all
Ktrlotle love et country and substitutes la
place selfiah creed and graaplng avarice.
Devotion te American cltlzenablp for Ita
own aake and for what It should accom
plish aa a motive te our nstlen'a advance,
ment and the bspplness of all our
people, la dli placed by tba assumption
that the government Instead et being the
embodiment of equality, la tut au Instru
mentality tbraugn whleh especial and lndl
dual advantages are te be gained.
The arroganee of tbla assumption la un
concealed. It appears In the sordid disre

The arlevaaete of these sol laeluded

government te pay. for the benefit of ethers,
inch enhaneed prieaa for the thlnga they
need that the eeanty returns et their labor
fall te famish their support or leave be
msrgla for aoeumalstleo.
Our werklngmen, enfranchised from all
delusions and no longer frightened by the
cry that their wages are endangered by a
Just revision et our tariff lawa, will reason
ably demand through sueh revision
steadier employment, cheaper meana
of living la their homes, freedom
for themselves and their children from
the deem of perpetual servitude aad aa
open deer te their advancement beyond the
llmlta of a laboring elaat. Otbera of enr
eltlzens, whose oemtorta and expenditure
are measured by moderate salaries and
fixed incomes, will Insist upon the fairness
aad Justice of cheapening the coat et neces
saries for themselves and their families.
When te the selfishness et the benefi
ciaries of unj net discrimination under our
lawa there ahall be added the discontent of
these who antler from eech discrimination,
we will realize the faet that the beneficent
purposes of our government, dependent
upon the patriotism and contentment of our
people, are endangered.
Communism is a hateful thing and a
menace 10 peaee and organized govern,
ment But the communism of combined
wealth and capital, the outgrowth et over
weening eupidlty and selfishness, whleh
insidiously undermines the justloe and
integrity of trte Institution, is net lets
dangerous than the oemmunlam of op.
pressed poverty and tell, which, exasper
ated by injustice and discontent, attacka
with wild disorder the citadel of rule.
WHEN A GOVERNMENT IB UNJUST.
He mocks the people who proposes that
the government aball protcet the rich and
that they in turn will care for the laboring
peer. Any intermediary between the pee
ple ana meir governmtnt,er tne leastaeiega leastaeiega leastaeiega
tlonei theeareand protection the govern
ment ewea te the humblest eltlzan In the
land, makes the beast of free Institutions a
glittering delusion end the pretended becn
of American citizenship a shameless impes
Itlen.
A Just and sensible revision of our tariff,
lawa Bbeuld be made for the relief of these
of our oeuntry men who suffer under pres
ent condition. Such a revision should re re re
oelve the support tit all who love that Jus
tice and equality due te American olllaen elllaen
shlp, or all who realiza that In thin tnstlee
and equality our government rinds Ita
a reegtu nedi's power te protect the citlisn
and hla property, of all who believe that
the contented competence and comfort of
many acoerd better with tbe spirit et our
Inatltutlena than colossal fortunes unfairly
gathered In the bauds of a lew, of all who
appreciate that the fcrbearanes and fra
ternity among our peeple, which recognize
the value et every American Interest, are
the surest guaranty of enr national preg
rets, and of all who desire te see the
prodnets of American skill and Ingenuity
In e,ery tnancet of the world with a result
ing restoration of American commerce.
The necessity of tbe reduotlen of our
revenue la an apparent as te be generally
oenoeded. Bat the meana by wbleh this
end shall be accomplished and the aum of
direct benefit whleh snail result te our
cltlzent, present a controversy of the
utmost Importance. There Bheuld be no
aeheme aoeepted aa aatls'aotery by
whleh the burdens of the people
are only appirently removed. Ex
travagant appropriations of public
money, with all ihe-lr demoralizing
oenaequences, abeuld net be tolerated,
either aa a meana of rellevlng the treasury
et Ita present surplus, or bs tarnishing pre
text for resitting a proper reduction in tariff
rates Existing evils and Injustice Bheuld
be honestly recognized, beluly met and
effectively remedied. There abeuld be no
cessation of the atruggle until a plan is
perfected, fair and conservative toward
existing Industries, but whleh will reduee
the cost te consumers of tbe neeeseariea of
life while It provides for our manufacturers
the advantage of freer raw materiala and
permits no injury te the interests of Amer
can labor.
TARIFF REFORM SHOULD RE PURSUED
The cause for whlelt the battle li waged is
comprised within lines clearly and dis
tinctly defined. It Bheuld never be com
promised. It Is the people's eaure
It cannot be denied that tbeaelfiahand
private Interests which are se persistently
heard, when efforts are made te deal In a
Just and cemprebenslve manner with our
tariff laws, are related te. it they
are net, responsible for, the aenti
ment largely prevailing among the people,
that tbe general government lathe fountain
of Individual and private aid; tbst it may
be expected te relieve, with paternal care
tbe dlitreaa of citizens and communities,
and tbat from the tul'ness el Its treasury it
Bheuld, upon the (lightest possible pretext
of promoting the general geed, apply public
funds te the benefit et localities and indi
viduals. Ner eau it be denied tbat there la
a growing assumption tbst, as against tbe
government and in favor of private claims
and lnterei a, tbe uiual rulea and limi
tations of buaines principles and Just deal
ing abeuld be waived.
Theae ideas have been unhappily mueh
enoeuraged by legislative acquiescence.
Belief from contracts made with the
government Is tee easily accorded In favor
of the eltlzen; tbe failure te support claims
agalnat tbe government by proof, is elten
supplied by no belter conalderstlen than
tbe wealth of tbe government and tbe
poverty of tbe claimant; gratltt I les In tbe
form of penalena are grunted upon no ether
real ground than tbe needy condition of
tbe applicant, or for reasons leis valid; and
large auma are expended for pnblle build
ings and ether Improvements upon repre
sentations scsreely claimed te be related
te public needs and necessities.
The extent te which tbe consideration et
such mattera auberdinate and postpone
aotlen upon subjects et great publle Import
ance aheuld, tbe preeldent thinks, arrest
attention and lead te reformation; and he
thus cites a few et tbe numerous illustra
tions el this condition i
The crowded condition of the calendar et
the supreme oenrt, and the delay te aultera
and dental of Justloe resulting therefrem,
has been strongly urged upon the attention
et the Congress, wltb a plan for the relief el
the altuatlen approved bv these well buIe
te judge of lla merits. While this subject
remalna without eflte'lve consideration,
many laws have been passed providing ter
tbe holding et terms of interior courts at
plaoeate suit the oenvenlenoaof loeillticr,
or te lay tbe foundation of application ter
tbe erection of a new publle bunding.
Kepeated reoemmeodatlona have been
submitted for tbe amendment and change
of tba laws relating te our publle landa se
tbat their spoliation and dlverstqn te ether
uses than as hemea for honest settlers
might be prevented. While a measure te
meet thla coneeded necessity of reform re
malna awaiting tbe action of the Cengrea,
many claim a te the publle lands and ap ap
pllcatlena for tbelr donation, In favor of
stales and individuals, have been allowed.
A plan In aid of Indian management
recommended by these well informed as
oentalnlng valuable feat u tea In furtherance
of the solution el tbe Indian problem, ba
thus far failed of legislative sanction, while
grants nf doubtful expediency te railroad
corporations, permitting tbem te pass
through Indian reservation, have greatly
multiplied.
The propriety and necetslty et the erec
tion el one or mere prisons ler tbe confine.
ment of United States oenviots, and a post pest post
effloe building In tbe national capital, are
net disputed. But theae needs yet remain
unanswered; while scores of puolte build
ings have been ereetel where tbelr necessity

PENSION LAWS NEED HETISION.
A revision et enr pension laws could
easily be made wbleh would rest upon Just
prtnelplea and provide for every worthy
applicant. But while our general pension

These statements can be much eanpha

The president next deals with our foreign
relatiene, wbleb, be says, have during the
pest year been atrengtbened and improved.
These questions whleh attll await eettlement
are all reasonably within the domain or
amicable negotiation and susceptible of
Mtlsfactery adjuatment by frank diplomatic
treatment The fisheries question, he re
grets te aay, Is.net satisfactorily adjusted,
and reiterates that the treaty rejected by
the Senate did supply "a satisfactory, prao prae prao
tleal and final adjustment upon a basis
honorable and Just te both parties of tbe
dlffieult and vexed question te whleh It
rBl&tBds"
Referring te the Lord Saekvllte Incident,
the president prem'ses that tbe correspon
dence in relation te It, whleh will Boen be
laid bsfere Congress, 'will dltolete the
unpBrdonable oenduct of the cfllelal re
ferred te, In his Interference by advice and

subsequent publle declarations te Justify
his action, superadding impugnment nf the
exeeutive ana Ben ate of tbe United States
In connection wltb important questions
new pending In controversy between the
two govern ments."
Regarding tbe offense thus committed aa
most grave, Involving disastrous possibil
ities te the geed relation of tbe United
States and Great Britain, constituting a
gross breach nf diplomatic privilege and an
invasion of tbe purely domestic
affairs and essential sovereignty of the
government te whleh tbe 'envoy waa ac
credited ; ami having first fulfilled tbe Just
demands of International oemlty, by afford
lng full opportunity ter the British govern
ment te act in relief of the situation, tbe
president considered prolongation of dis
cussion unwarranted and thereupon de
clined "te further reoegniza tbe diplomatic
character el the person, wheae oentlnnanoe
In such funotien would destroy tbat
mutual oeufldenoe wbleb la essential te the

The Hamean and Haytlen treublea are

mercial reciprocity treaty with Mexico and
the forthcoming centennial celebration, and

detecting spurious citizenship.

By this plan bends of tbe government

The premium sdded te tbe principal el
theae bends represents an Investment yield
ing about 2 per e&nt Interest for tbe time

government represented by tbe difference
between the amount of Interest at 2 per

premium and what It would have paid for
inierest at tbe rate specified In tbe bends It
tbey had run te tnclr maturity, is about
f27,165,C00.

thus expended for tbe pureuise of benda

cets of any actual need of tbe government,
and web se expended rather tnan allow It
te remain Idle In the treasury. If thla
surplus under tbe operation of Just and
equitable laws bad been left In tbe banda
ei the people, It would have been worth In
their bufciruei at least six per cent p9r

Since the purchase of beadB was under

probably twenty-flye feet east of it Th
tank wheela were off the track and the
wooden eabin en top was en Arc. The men
qulekly procured axes and cut what re
mained et the cabin off. Who ran tbe
engtne from tbe burning beuse no one
knows. The general belief Is tbat some
one dlieavered tbe fire and endeavored te
save tbe engine by running it out. When
he found tbat It bad Jumped the trsek he
probably became frightened and ran away.
The engine house has been left In oharge
et Nathaniel Baiorf,et I.aneaster Junction,
at night for aeme tlme,as he aeled aa watch
man and engine eleaner. It happened en
Baturdsy night tbat he had Just gene down

out At first It waa believed by many that
tbe house waa set en Are, but the railroad
men explain it In a different manner. Tbe
damper la plaeed en tbe smoke stack after
the engine la housed eaeh night, and when
thla la en It causes the gas te rush te the
Are doers and sparks te drop out. Houses
et thla kind are usually greisy from oil
and tbey easily oateh Are.
The cabin of the engine was entirely de
stroyed. The steam and air guagea were
damaged and a clock, valued at W5, was
rendered entirely worthless. The tank and
ether parts of the engine were badly charred.
The damage wsa net ae great tbat tbe en

three years paat it bad been running be

Secretary Endloett haa mine a report te
the president of the administration of the
war department during the fiscal year end
ed June 80 last. The total expenditures
were 141,105,107 ; the appropriations for
the current fiscal year amount te $59,670,
03i and the. estimates for the flaeal year
ending June 80, 1800, aggregate $41,033
607. In commenting en rifle practice, the
secretary makes the suggestion :
"By a generous supply of ammunition
for target practice te colleges where army
officers are serving aa Instructors, It Is pos
sible that competitive contests In rifle
sheeting might In time become as popular
with some of these Inland oellegea aa beat
racing new la at the universities of our
seaboard."
It la suggested that some action should
be taken by Congress te enforeo the rights
of the United States innavigable streams
within the Hrntta of a state, and thus glve
effect te the duty resting upon the govern
ment te protect navigation thereon.
The attention of Congress la again Invited
te the defeneelesa condition of the aeaoeast
and Uke frontiers, and liberal and Immedi
ate aotlen la recommended looking te the
cflbotlve defence of our principal seaports.
The sccretarv says :
"It would appear new mere Important
than evor that sueh action aheuld be taken
at the second session of the present Cen
gress, In vlew of the faet that the last ses
sion gave appropriations for the construc
tion of heavy ordnance. Without heavy
platforms, strong armored protection and
ether permanent emplacements, these guns
and mortars, when finished, will be of com
paratively llttle use."
The building of modern gun and mortar
batterlca requires longer periods of tlme
that the construction of the armament. It
would appear the part of wisdom that the
preparation of these two Important compo
nents of a well equipped defence aheuld
proceed slinulUueeualy,
Fer the beginning of the oenstraotlon of
sueh defences an appropriation of $3,810,
000 Is asked for.
Twe hundred thousand dollars Is asked
for the repair and preservation of existing
works ; for the purchase of torpedoes and
lubmarlne mines and the neoessary appli
ances foreporatlng them for experimenting
'te ascertain the best of the many torpode
Inventions, and for the continuing of the
construction of tbe necessary casemates,
cable galleries, etc, for working the sub
marine mlne and torpode systems, $1,890
000 is recommended.
Th Peaimaatar General's Xlcpert.
The postmaster general's report presents
coneisely the oendltlon snd history of every
braneh of the postal service for the flsjal
year ending June 80, 1889, with many
striking comparisons with previous years,
showing a remarkable expansion of busi
ness and a large Inoreaso In expenditure.
The gross rovenuo for the year was $59,
005.170. The total expenditure, inoluslve
of liabilities for the year unpaid, and em
bracing the amount for transportation of
malls onPaelflo rallreada for which the
government receives credit, waa $30,885.
403. Tbe estimated deficiency, therefore, Is
$4,100,227.
The total estimated gross receipts for the
year ending 3une 80, 1889, U $62,508,058.
The probable amount of expenditure te be
made in carrying en the business of the
postal service for tbe year ending June 30,
1890, as shown by estimates submitted te
the secretary of the treasury, is $03,81?,
073. The deflolcney te be supplied from
the general treasury is, therefore, $3,803,
414. The velume of ordinary mall matter has
largely Inereased, and It la estimated that
tbe revenue en the number of pleces
handled during tbe past year would have
been, without reduction of postage, up
wards of $70,000,000.
The postmaster general submits that ap
propriations for speelal pay te railroads
should be better distributed, or, If need be,
increased, if the policy of speelal appro
priations for increased pay is te be contin
ued. Statistics are submitted contrasting
our service with that of Great Britain, Ger
many and Franee, demonstrating that In
cheapness of postage, gross rovenue and
expenditures, number of postefBoes, ex
tent of mall routes, mlleage of mall ser
vice, and volume of mall matter transmit
ted, the postal system of the United States
Is the leading one of the world.
In connection with the foreign mall ser
vice, and especially in relation te our n.eans
of communication with Seuth and Central
America and Mexico, the postmaster gen
eral vigorously reasserts hla views agalnat
making tbe postal administration the dls
buner of subsidies.
Under the head of "Postal Telegraghy"
he says :
"If the oerrospondonoo of the oeuntry Is
te contlnue te be under the oharge and pro
tection of the government, the vast and in in
ercaalng velume condueted by telegraphy
and right of the great body et people te be
afforded facilities for the best aud qulekest
transmission at rates within tbe reach of
all will press this subject upon the atten
tion of Congreaa with mere and mere
urgoney. The chief difficulties In tbe way
are the great coat of present methods and
the absence of safeguard, which according
te the theory of tbe present mall service,
should protect the privacy of correspond
ence. I have given the subject much con
sideration, and I bellove that the Inveutlve
Senlus of this country has reached a sUge In
Iscevery In eleotrle science when these
problems may be solved. I recommend the
appointment of a commission of competent
aud disinterested mcn.learned in the science,
who may oxainlue inventions and invite
ethers, who shall be authorized te erect
short experimental lines, and who shall re
pert te the president or Congress the result
of their investigations."
Tba Interior Department.
The secretary of the Interior, in his re
port, calls attention te the accumulated
business in tbe land office, and says :
The commission states that a thorough
examination haa been made of all tbe un
finished business In his office, and that the
results presented may be accepted as accu
rate. This Information carries a heavy re
proach against the government, and seems
te call fur action which shall relieve the
condition exhibited."
Of final entries, there were pending en
the 30th of June last 239,150: and the
number of such entries mode during the
last veir was 70,408. This latter number
exceeds all the final entries disposed of by
patent during the last year ; se that Instead
of a dlmlnlshment of arrearages, the ac
cumulatien of eases has increased. The
cnmmlasleuer expresses the hope that It
will be possible te dispose of 75,000 of
these cases during the eurrentyear : a num
ber which will net diminish sensibly the
mass if, aa may be reasonably expected, se
many final entries shall be made during the
current as during the past year. Ne rea rea
aeuable expectation Is therefore held out te
the settler who has met all the require
ments of the law that he can receive the
evidence of hla title for nearly four years
after his proof shall have been submitted.
When it la also considered that in many In
stances defects of proof will require
further action en his part te be followed
by further delays in temring a final dis
position, the default of tbe government te
Its citizens becomes glarlngaud painful.

while In 790, or 8.43 per cnt., thn strikes
were paitly successful, and In 2114 estab

for tbls cause failed.
In 4344 establishments strikes were re
sorted te secure a reduction of the hours of
labor ; In 1053, or 25.20 per cent., suoecss
waa the result J In 900, or 29.24 per cent.,
the strikes were partly iiioecusful ; aud In
2323, or 69.47 per cent., the strtketa were
defeated.
Original pensioners te Uie number nf 60,
253 were added te the pension rolls during
the last flcal year, and Increases were
granted In 45,710 eases. The names of 15,
730 pensioners were dropped from the rolls
for various cattRcs, ae that at the end of

vors of the war of 1812, and 10,787 widows
of thotewho served In that war; 10,000
Moxlean soldiers aud 0101 widows of Mexi
can soldiers.
At the present tlme 103 dllTorent rates of
pension prevail, ranging from $3 per mouth
te $110,00 per month ; but the average an
nual value of eaeh penalen nt tha clone of
the year la shown te be $125,30 ; and the
aggregate annual value of all pensions,
$5$,707,2t0,03. an Increase for the year of
$3, 852,070.70.
The amount paid for pensions during the
year was $73,773,801.03 au Inoreaso ever
tbe previous year of $3,808,680.23 ; the dif
ference betw3cu the actual payments and
the snnual value having been occasioned by
first payments Involving arrears. Thus
there were paid te 04.283 pensioners, ro re ro
eolvlng first payments during the year, the
aum or $22.209, 003'40. and thore remained
In the hands of pension agcnls 0574 eases
of this kind unpaid ou the 00th of June,
upeu which were due $3,405,723,40. The
cost attending the disbursement of this
money, embracing the pay of officers and
empleyes of the bureau, Its agents, sur
geons, special examiners and ethers, was
$3,203,624.07, making the total expenditure
for all purposes by tills bureau during the
year, $83,038,880,00 ; being 21V per cent, et
the total gross luoenio of the United Btates
for that time, and nearly 81 per cent of
the total expenditures of the government
for the flieal year. This entire business
was transacted without defalcation or fi
nancial Irregularity Involving the govern

tbe rapidity of payment.
