OWOSSO. FRIDAY. DEC. 7. 1900.
Generals White and Marsh Pardoned.
The expected has come to pass. The
czar of Michigan, who has still twenty
four days in which to reign supreme, in
Which to pardon criminals, call special
sessions, defy and vilify the courts and
the press, has extended the mantel of
executive clemency and pardon over
two men who were parties to the most
gigantio steal in the history of the state.
The man who has posed as the friend
of reform, the friend of the masses, the
man who would bring about a more
equitable order of things wherein equal
burdens should be placed on all and the
biggest rascals should be punished as
relentlessly as is the common offender,
has pardoned two men. the one of whom
has been a voluntary exile from the '
state for over a year and has only just
returned to plead guilty to the charges
brought against him of conspiring to :
defraud, the state, and the other o"
whom stands convicted of similar charg
es with an appeal to the supreme court
still pending at the time of the extend
ing of the pardon.
Why were they pardoned? Several
reasons will bo given. The most of
people will be contented with sayiDg
that they were pardoned because they
were the "old man's" pets, and it must
be admitted that he has stood by these
men whom he appointed to the respon
sible positions where they disgraced
themselves and him, as well as he could
have done had he been also a party to
their gigantic stoal. But the governor
gives other reasons for bis action.
The governor has set a new precedent to
6rlminal jurisprudence. Hereafter
there are to be no convictions o! crim
inals secured through the old practice
of using state's evidence. If any of the
partiesto the crime are to be set free
for their testimony against themselves
and tho rest then the ethers must also
be set free according to Mr. Pingree bo.
cause it is not fair for them to suffer
unless the rest suffer too. The argu
ment is thin, very, very thin, and even,
when supported by all the vile pro
fanity which probably no other man in
the state of Michigan could command,
the argument is still so thin that few
will even believe that the real reason
for the pardon was given.
Besides as has been pointed out there
was as yet no certainty that the private
citizens, the men connected with the
Henderson-Anies Company who were
also parties to the conspiracy with the
guilty state officials might not also be
brought in some way to justice. Cer
tainly if the man who has just been par
doned after confessing his own guilt
had done what his duty to the state even
now demands of him there would have
been more chance for the conviction of
these other men. But be that as it may,
if there were any persons who were in
clined to feel 6orry for "the old man" be
cause his pets, the military board, had
so disgraced his administration, they
can take back the sorrow and pity that
they gave, for Governor Pingree was
not only responsible for the appoint
ment of the officers who disgraced the
state and his administration, but he has
now done everything that it is possible
for him to do to show that they are still
bound to him or he to them by strange
mysterious ties, by pardoning them on
the flimsy ground that it is not fair to
punish them while some of the other
conspirators go free. The act is a dis
grace to the state which has already
submitted to much in that line from the
hands of its retiring governor.
Thjb Times prints an abridged copy cf
the president's message this week. The
message contains no new and startling In
formation or recommendations, but empha
sixes the Increasing prosperity which tbis
country Is enjoying and Its Increasing pre
tlge abroad. The growth of the nation'
wealth, and the growth of Its trade are
pointed out and the keynote of good will t
other nations Is struck. The message Is
clearly written, In the president's usual In
cisive style.
The resnlt of the official canvass show
Congressman Fordaey's majority to le
4,309.
After all Is said It was only Plngreelsm.
Chas. A. Towoe -has been appointed
United States Senator from Minnesota to
bucceed Senator Davis, deceased. Senator
Towne will kave but a short period in
which to enjoy this distloetlon conferred up
on him by a populittt governor however for
the Incoming legislature of his state will
elect a republican senator among its Urst
acts. There are many friends of Mr. Towne
both In Minnesota and In this state who
wish that he were still eligible for and en.
titled to favors at the hands of the republi
can party at this time Instead of being In
the political company In which he finds
himself.
Governor Pingree Issued a call for another
special session of the legislature Wednes
day afternoon. This, probablv the last
which the governor can convene, Is called
for Wednesday, December 12., and will be
expected to enact an equal taxation measure.
This will be pratlcally the reenaetment of
the Atkinson bill which had been passed
once and pronounced unconstitutional, but
which has now a chance of living, If brought
to light again, owing to the passing of the
constitutional amendment at the recent elec
tion. By this amendment It now becomes
constitutional to tax railway companies and
other corporations on their cash value as
the property of Individuals Is taxed Instead
of taxing them on their earnings as they
have been In the past. The passage of the
bill at this time however seems to be consid
erably imperilled by the supreme contempt
which the action of Qovernor Pingree In
pardoning Generals White and Marsh has
aroused for the chief executive of the state.
. Free Delivery Extension.
In commenting on the growth of the
postal service as an Index to the Increasing
business activity of the country which has
been developed so fast during the last year,
President, McKinley makes some very
interesting statements concerning free rural
delivery. The farmers of the country
should note the fact that the president has
the subject of their rights and needs and
opportunities for helping make their life
more enjoyable, as much In mind Im
mediately after the national election as be
has ever had.
Tbe democratic party did not care enough
about the farmer to even try the experiment
when congress had made an appropriation
for the same. Under the republican
administration which the people of this
country have wisely voted to continue, tbe
free rural delivery of mall will go on until
an assured success Is reached. The
language of the president is as follows:
"The continued' and rapid growth of tbe
postal service is a sure index of the great
and increasing business activity of tbe
country. Its most striking new develop
ment is tbe extension of rural free delivery.
This has come almost wholly within the
last year. At the beglnnipg of the fiscal
year 1899-1900 the number of routes in
operation was only S91, and most of these
had been running less than twelve mouths.
On the l5thof November, 1900, the numbsr
had increased to 2,614, reaching Into forty
four states and territories, and serving a
a population of 1,801,524. Tbe number of
applications now pending and awaiting
action nearly equal all those granted up to
tbe present time, and by tbe close of the
current fiscal year about 4,000 routes
will have been established, providing for
tbe dally delivery of mails at the scattered
homes of about three and a half millions of
rural population. This service ameliorates
the Isolation of farm lift. Conduces to good
roads, and quickens aud extends the dis
semination of general information. Ex
perience thus far has tended to allay the
apprehension that It would be bo expensive
as to forbid its general adoption or make it
a serious burden. Its actual application
has shown that it increases postal receipt?,
and can be accompanied by reductions In
other branches of tbe service, bo that the
augmented revenues and tbe accomplished
savings together materially reduce tbe net
cost. Tbe .evidences which point to these
conclusions are presented In detail In tbe
annual report of the Postmaster General,
which with its recommendations is recom
mended to tbe consideration of tbe Congress.
The full developement of this special service,
however, requires such a large outlay of
money that it should be undertaken only
after a careful study and thorough under
standing of all that It Involves."
HOLMES AND BINGHAM WILL BE
PROSECUTED.
Prosecutor Fraz;r Believes He Can Con
vict the Conspirators Against Mrs. Nor
ton. Tbe Detroit Journal. .
Prosecuting Attorney Frazer, in hand
ing out tho day's work to1 his assistants
this morning, threw a bunch of papers
on Henry Mandell's desk with the re
quest that he draw up requisition papers

The End of the World in 1914
A I amous scientist predicts that the world
will come to an end In 1014, basing his cir
culations on the revelations of the Bible.
If this Is so, It Is well for us to get what
pleasure we can out of the few year that
remain lor us to live. One of the surest
ways to enjoy life Is the possession of good
health, and a well regulated stomach.
Hostetter's 8tomach Bitters will ensble any
one to obtain this. It Is tbe greatest
medicine for the cure of UU that arise from
a bad stomach. It cures dyspepsia, con
stipation fever and ague, malaria, rbeumi
tlam and Insomnia. No other medicine can
show a record equal to Hostetter's 8tomch
Bitter, the standard medicine of tbe
American people for over fifty years.
