CALLS HER A "VAMP1
Asserts Rich Publisher Told
Him "Poetic Soul," Mot
His Wealth Won Her
fGspyrlsht. 1?22. by New York Ameri
can and International News Serrlce.)
NEW YORK, Dec. 12.?Corliss
Rainier had "vamping ways,"
Eichard Middleton told the New
Tork American in an exclusive
Interview, baring: the heart cecrets
of his romance with the^ dashing
miss who is now Eugene V*Brews
ter^ beauty queen. He added:
?ACTED FUNNY."
"Why, she vamped me for six
years before I learned that she is
absolutely incapable of any real
love, except love for herself. I be
lieved when our romance started?
as I confidently believe now?that
Corliss loved me to the best of her
ability. but her ability wasn't
enough to support a real love."
When Middleton was serving a
term In prison on a charge of con
spiracy to defraud, and after be
had asked?he alleges?Corliss to
"give him up" she wrote him many
love missives.
In a letter dated May 8, 1920,
?he complained of him "acting
funny," and added
"I was just waiting to see how
long it would be before I got a
letter or something from you. I
certainly didn't want to quit, be
cause you know I always have
loved you dearly and you know it.
Certainly have missed your dear,
sweet letters."
Corliss. In the foregoing missive,
explained that she had paid a visit
to the Institution where Middleton
was serving as "trusty" and secre
tary to the warden. She added tnat
her call was made after 3 o'clock
and rha' visitors were barred, and
continued*
WANTED TO PROVE LOVE.
"I sure am crazy to see you. for
you know you mean lots to me,
dear. Please don't think 1 am just
kidmg. but you have always
thought that, and in the end it nas
always been you that was kidding.
Wish I had a chance to prove lust
what kind of a friend I am to yoa.
"Lots of kisses." concluded this
as well as many other letters of the
alleged 100 received by Middleton
before, durin* and after his sen
tence was served.
In a June letter, written on the
stationery of the Hotel Macon,
where Corliss was a cigar clerk, she
refers to Middleton'* "precious"
letters and adds:
"You are the sweetest thing in
the world to me."
That she wan "just crazy" to see
him is contained ?' a letter which
forms one of a series now being
published exclusively by the New
Tork American. The epistle con
tinued:
"Please hurry and get out. I can
fesrdly wait for the time to come.
AH I can say is I love you so much
and think of you so. until It makes
my heart ache and head ache. I
am being a pood girl for you, deai\
Kiss yourself a thousand times and
think of your loving Corliss."
PRAYED FOR HIM.
Brewster. Middleton declares, told
him he had won Corliss' affec tion?
not through moneyed power?but
through his poetic soul's call to its
affinity. To this, Middleton replied
that h*-. too. had found Corliss an
Inspiration for poetic outbursts and
what Corliss thought of Middleton
may b- Indicated by the following
note addressed by Corliss to Middle
ton in July of 1920 at the Federal
Prison: ?
"My dear Sweetheart:
"Your precious letter was re
ceived, and. dear, you know you
Write the sweetest letters in all
the world to me. I sure do like
to get them."
Th?- letter adds that Corliss was
longing for her "dear" and goes
on: "I sure wish you could be
with me everywhere 1 go. I am I
sure I could enjoy the times lots,
better If you were along. .1 pray
for you to come every night."
In that missive, Corliss asked for
a photograph of Richard, explain
ing:
"I can't have the original any
too soon. I know you are being
s good hoy. aren't you. For I
know von can't be otherwise where
you ar?* I am certainly being a
good jcirl for my boy and I'll swear
I don't ever cheat on you."

Dr. Emile Coue's Own Story of How to Improve

Through Auto-Suggestion.

"The Madman At Home"
By DR. EMILE COUE. H
According to the principle
propounded in the preced
ing chapUi we may com
pare the imagination to a torrent
\*hich fatally sweeps away the
poor wretch who has fallen into
it, in spite of his efforts to gain
the bank.
This torrent seems indomitable,
but if you know how, you can
turn it from its corn re and con
duct it to the factory, and there
you can transform its force into
movement, heat, and electricity.
If this simile is not enough,
we mav compare the imagina
tion?"the madman at home" as
it has been called?to an unbroken
horse which has neither bridle nor
reins. What can the rider of
such an animal do except to hang
on for dear life and let himself
go wherever the horse wishes to
lake him? Often his mad ride
must end in disaster both to the
horse and rider.
Now suppose that the rider suc
ceeds in putting a bridle on the
horse. The roles are reversed.
The horse no longer goes where
he likes; it is the rider who picks
the way, forcing the erstwhile
independent animal to follow the
path he chooses. %
Now that we have learned to
realize the enormous power of
unconscious, or imaginative, be
ing, I am going to be as easily
controlled as a torrent by dams,
mill races and water wheels or a
horse by bit and spur.
It is necessary to define care
fully at the outset two words
that are often used without be
ing properly understood. These
are the words suggestion and
autosuggestion.
What then is suggestion? It
may be defined as "the act of
imposing an idea on the brain of
another."
Does this action really exist ex
cept on the sine qua non condi
tion of transforming itself into
autosuggestion in the subject?
Autosuggestion may be defined
as "the implanting of an idea in
oneself by oneself."
You may make a suggestion to
someone: if the unconscious of the
latter do^s not accept the sugges
tion?if it has not. as 1t were. di
gested it, in order to transform it
into autosuggestion?it produces
no result.
I have myself occasionally made
a more or less commonplace sug
gestion to ordinarily very obedient
subjects entirely without success.
The reason is that the uncon
scious of the subject refused to
accept it and did not transform it
into autosuggestion.
MEANS OF AUTOSUGGESTION.
Let us now return to the point
where I said that we can control
and direct our imagination. Just
as a torrent or a horse can be
controlled.
To do so, it is enough in the
first place to know that this Is
possible (of which fact almost
everyone is ignorant), and, second
ly, to know by what means it can
be done.
The means is very simple; it is
that which we have used every
day since we came into the world;
used without wishing or knowing
it and absolutely unconsciously;
but which, unfortunately for us.
we often use wrongly and to our
own detriment. This means is
autosuggestion.
Whereas we constantly give
ourselves unconscious autosugges
tions, all we have to do is to give
ourselves conscious ones.
The process consists in this:
First, to weigh carefully In one's
mind the things which are to be
the object of the autosuggestions,
and according as they require the
answer "yes" or "no." to repeat
several times without thinking of
anything else:
"This thing is coming." or "this
thing is going away;" "this thing
will, or will not happen." (Of
course, the thing must be in our
own power.)
If the unconscious accepts this
suggestion and transforms it into
an autosuggestion, the thing or
things will be realised in every
particular.
Thus understood, autosuggestion

SELF-MADE INHIBITIONS.
Such is the case of neuras
thenics. who. believing themselves
incapable of the least effort, often
find It impossible even to walk a
few steps without being exhausted.
And these same neurasthenics
sink more deeply into their de
pression, the more ungulded ef
forts they make to throw it off.
like the poor wretch In the quick
sands who sinks in all the deeper
the more he tries to struggle out.
Let me Insert here as concrete
examples of the operation of auto
suggestion in case of this ailment
?neurasthenia?the following in
dividual "hlstorie#."
M. Y.?. of Nancy has suffered
from neurasthenia for several
years. He has aversions, ner
vous fears, and disorders of the
stomach and intestines. He sleeps
badly, is gloomy and |x haunted
by Ideas of suicide: he staggers
like a drunken man when he walks,
and can think of nothing but his
trouble. All treatments have
failed and he gets worse and
worse: a stay in a special nurs
ing home for such cases has no
effect whatever
M. T.?Comes to see me at the
beginning of October. 1?10. Pre
liminary experiments compara
tively easy. I explain to the pa
tient the principles of autosugges
tion and the existence within us
of the conscious and unconscious
self, and then make the required
suggestion.
For two or three days M. T.
has a little difficulty with the ex
planations I have given him. In
a ?hort time light breaks in upon
his mind, and he grasps the whole
thing. I renew the suggestion,
and he makes It himself too every
day.
The improvement, which is at
first slow, becomes more and
more rapid, and in a month and
a half the cure is complete. The
ex-invalid, who had lately consid
ered himself the most wretched
of men. now thinks himself the
happiest.

Confessed Slayer Says Widow
Wished Showman Would
Be Shot
EXPECT SURPRISES TODAY
Daughter, 18 Years Old, May
Drop Bombshell When She
Takes Stand.
MOUNT HOLLT. N. J., Dec. 12.
?Only in oge instance did Charles
M. Powell, self-confessed slayer of
"Honest" John Brunen and chief
witness for the State, connect Mrs.
Dorla Brunen. directly with the
murder of her husband for whose
murder both she and her brother,
Harry C. Mohr, are now standing
trial.
It was a month or thereabouts
before the tlfcgedy. according to
Powell, that Mrs. Brunen came to
him and confided she was afraid of
her husband. According to Powell,
Mrs. Brunen at that time declared
that "she wished that while Brunen
sat at the window, somebody would
shoot him."
ON STAND MOST OF DAT.
Powell was on the witness stand
for the better part of the day. Ht
will be recalled today.
So far the State has produced no
evidence against Mrs. Brunen suf
ficient to warrant a conviction, ac
cording to officials here.
However, it is the hope of prose
cutor Jonathan Kelsey, to not only
prove that Mrs. Brunen wax cogni
zant of the conspiracy existing be
tween 1'owell and her brother,
llarry Mohr, but that she was an
actual participant.
EXPECT SIKPKIHK SOON.
Before the State closes Its rasp
it is believed that some "surprise"
testimony will be Introduced.
There is speculation as to wheth
er this testimony will come from
Mrs. Hazel Brunen I*arkstrom, 1B
year-old daughter of the slain show
man, or from some other quarter.
The prosecution is silent as to the
nature of their "surprise attack."
