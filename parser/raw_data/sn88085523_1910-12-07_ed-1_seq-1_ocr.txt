President Taft Delivers Annual
Message to Congress With
Recommendations.
SCIENTIFIC REVISION OF
TARIFF BY EXPERTS
Parcels Post, Fortification of Pana
ma Canal and Stimulation of
Trade to Benefit Nation as a
Whole Urged by President
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. « —
Practically all the time In both
houses of congress today was occu
pied in reading President Tart's mes
sage. In the senate three new sen
ators were sworn in. These wer.
Claud A. M. Swanson of Virginia,
Joseph M. Terrell of Georgia, and La
fayette Young of lowa.
WASHINGTON, Dec 6.—The out
standing features of President Taft's
taessage Bent to congress today are
these: He declared it is time to stop
legislation with reference to regula
tion of corporations and to witness
the effect of a vigorous execution of
the laws already in the statue books.
The exact limitations upon business
methods imposed by law will doubt
less be made clearer by pending de
cisions of the supreme court.
Economy of Administration.
Just at this time the president says
lie believes the activities of the gov
ernment in addition to enforcement
of the laws should be directed to
ward economy of administration, the
enlargement *of opportunities for for
eign trade, the building up of home
industries and the strengthening of
confidence of capital in domestic in
vestment.
Mr. Taft recommends strongly
some form of a ship subsidy to in
crease American shipping, especially
to South Amerloa, «
Schedule By Schedule.
The tariff board is not ready to
submit a report on any of the
schedules of the Payne law and Mr.
Taft says he will not recommend any
tariff legislation until the new con
grt.'t convenes in Dec., 1111. He
urges that the tariff board be made
permanent and that all . future re
vision be made schedule oy schedule-
He vigorously opposes any general
revision.
Fortify Panama (anal.
The Panama canal should be for
tified. An appropriation of $19,
--000.0400 is recomended for this pur
pese.
There must be no more "pork bar
rel methods In river and harbor and
public building bills. The latter
should be based upon the report st
a commission of experts,. In the
past congress has appropriated too
much for buildings not needed and
not enouKh for buildings badly need
ed
Recommendations for anti-Injunc
tion and federal incorporation laws
are renewed.
Magazines Must Pay.
It is proposed that secoad class
mail rates shall be readjusted so as
to charge magazines a much higher
rate on their advertising sections.
Strong representations are made
fer the establishment of a new bank
ing and currency system.
Two new battleships and several
auxiliary vessels are urged for the
navy- The president recommends
that coal phosphate and oil land and
water power sites be disposed of in
the future by leasing.
Big Cut is Outlined.
Kstimates for government expen
ditures during the next fiscal year
has been cut to J630U94.013.12,
which is $52,964,887.36 less than the
actual appropriations for the current
year.
The estimated receipts for the next
n>c-al jacar are i5680,004|,«00. The
president urges the extension of the
civil service principle to the diplo
matc and consular corps and the ac
cuisition by the government of resi
dences and offices for its diplomatic
offcers.
Some criticism of the Payne tariff
act are just says the president, but
more are unfounded.
There should be more officers for
the army. The ensnneer corps should
be increased by M. The fortileations
at Corregidor island, Manila Bay and
at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, sneald be
carried to early completion.
Panama CanoJ SatisfartAry.
Regarding the Panama canal, the
president says: The progress of the
work is most satisfactory. It will he
completed well within the time set.
January 1, 1915, and within the es
timated cost of $375,000,000. The
slides in Culebra cut offer no great
reason for delay. Failure to fortify
the canal would leave the United
States powerless to enforc the uni
versal and equal usr or the wit"r
way against a deeperate and Irre
sponsible enemy and would defeat
the object of the canal in increa«in*
the military effectivemess of the Am
erican navy. The tolls should not ex
ceed $1 per net ton. The president
should be authorised to adjust the
rates as necessity «rv»»». The teov

TO ELIMINATE ALL

Among Jobbers and Retailers of
Plumbers' Supplies — Wicker
sham Brings Indictments
Against Another Octopus.
DETROIT, Dec. 6.—The anti-tru?t
campaign of Attorney General Wick
ersham shifted to Detroit this week
With the result that indictments were
returned today against 16 firms and'
32 individuals alleged to have se-1
cured 85 per cent of the annual out-'
put of enamel ironware, bath tubs,
r,!nks. lavatories, etc, in the United
Stote^.
H Is charged that as a result of a
t ;n ('ay's meeting last April at Mount j
Clemens, Michigan, a fund of $7000
wan subscribed to set in motion the
plan that resulted in giving the de
fendants' control of 16 manufacturers
and nearly 400 jobbers representing
the cutput of nearly $10,000,000 per
year.
Combined In Restraint of Trade.
Two Indictments against each de
fendant contains six and four counts
respectively. The charges ara that
they combined to restrain the trade
of manufacturers and lobbera of
plumbing supplies by refusing to nell
to jobbers handling goods of the so
calleu Independents; by fixing sale
prices; by dividing the United States
Into 11 zones and by refusing tv sell
to jobbers who would not maintain
the retail price.
It is charged this had an .effect to
eliminate the competition of Jobbers
as well as of manufacturer i. It is
charged also, that the defendants
compelled jobbers to enter into uni
form contracts and all defendants re
fused to sell to any jobber unless he
would sign such a contra.it.

The noon day luncheon yesterday,
held in the auditorium of tho Y. M. C
A., incidental to the debt canvass
campaign of $20,000 was another oc
casion of rejoicing and enthusiasm be
cause of the spirit of the men and the
success of the canvass; while hardly
up to average for day by day, yet
this will be overcome by the additional
workers added to the teams from now
on until the last day of the campaign
on aext Saturday, and because of the
majority of men now willing to spend
the greater amount of time, inasmuch
as Uie last day is fast approaching.
The thermometer is steadily rising
in the tube until now, fever heat has
been past or a sum of $7126. It
will be hard to find a bunch of men
gathered together around the festal
board with a sense of devotion to
duty and of responsibility as those
assembled every noon day in the as
sociation building and much valiant
work is anticipated on the part of the
Canvassers during the next four days
of the canvass.

MAN KIDNAP!!
HIS OWN SON
Moxee Farmer Declares His Wife's
Former Husband Stole Boy
From School.
IS BELIEVED TO BE
HIDING IN THE CITY
Portland Business Man Is Said to
Have Taken Law in Own Hands
After Court Gave Child to
Mother's Keeping-
Disregarding the court's order giv
ing the custody of his child to It 3
mother upon a divorce being granted
to her ahout seven years ago, William
Davis, of Portland, a former resident
of this city, appeared at the Moxee
school house Tuesday afternoon and
kidnapped his own son, according to
a report brought to the sheriff's office
by George I,ee. step father of the
child. Davis Is known to have driven
into North Yakima, but at an early
hour this morning-, no further trace
of him had been found. It is the op-|
inion of the officers that he is hiding
in the city, it being pointed out that
the constant watch kept over thy
trains last night, he could scarcely'
have made good his escape via the
railroad.
According to the story told by Lee.
David and his wife were divorced in
this county about seven years ago,
I Mrs. Davis being given the custody
of the boy. About a year after the
I divorce, Lee and Mrs. Davis wnrn
married and took up their residence
in the Moxee, where they have since j
resided. Lee says that for tho past'
I year, Davis, who also married
1 again, has repeatedly asked Mrs. Lee
I to allow the boy to come to Portland j
f<.r a visit and that the requests have
all been Ignored.
Stole Boy From School.
Shortly after noon Tuesday, Davis
Is said to have appeared at the Moxee
school house where, without ann
ouncing his business, he strode Into
the room and forced the boy to ac
company him. Lee is authority for
the statement that the teaoher at
tempted to Interfere and was elbowed
out of the way by Davis.
Davis then took the boy In his
waiting buggy and drove rapidly off
in the direction of this city. The
teacher, it is said, immediately noti
fied l>'. who stopped work and gave
chase, arriving in North Yaklma Just
behind Davis and the boy, but while
, Lee was visiting the sheriff's office,
i the other man disappeared.
Lee declined to swear out a icar
rant for Davis' arrest although he
asked the officers to take him Into
custody for having assaulted the
school teacher. For the reason that
Lee is reluctant to complain against
the alleged kidnapper, the sheriff's
office is inclined to believe that the
former's statement is exaggerated.
Howver, if Davis is located, he will!
be detained pending an investigation
of the case.
CUMMINS HAS TARIFF SCHEMK.

Resolution In Senate Today.
WASHINGTON, D. C Dec. 8. —

MERRITT BURIED
BHAMPLIGHT
Train Was Late But Military
Ceremonies Were Most
Brilliant
i WEST POINT, Dec. 6- —General
Wesley Merritt U. S. A. retired, was
buried here tonight by lamp light
with military honors of his rank. His
; body was laid beside his wife in the
; military reservation cemetery. There
was no service in the chapel of the
academy as had been planned.
I A special car bringing the body
1 from Washington was delayed by a
' storm and was an hour or so late
' and it was deemed best to make the
■ ceremonies as brief as due dignity
would allow.
Officers who have attended every
military funeral within the last 30
years could recall no other held by
lamplight. As regulations provide the
fife and drum corps followed by ca
ck-te fell in front on appearance of
, the coffin. Behind them clanked the
escorting battery. As the procession
moved throogh the darkness, the
t Hash of minute gun« flared for an mi
i stant across the fields and the dull
- jar of the report sounded solemnly
; across the river.
f Lanterns guided the procession V>
f the grave and there while the tnouri
] «ts stood bareheaded, the coffin wan
s lowered to Ms Moflna plate. As th«
f words of the burial service were spe

CUMMINS TALKS SUPREME
COURT APPOINTMENTS
tnaurtrrnt l,omio r of Sonnlc Discusses
Applicants with President
Taft.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 6 —
Senator Cummins. Insurgent leader
of the upper house called at the
white house today and spent an hour
In conference with the president. It
was said the senator attain talked to
the president regarding the supreme
court appointments and made a re
port on several suggested candidates
Senators Bacon and Terrell an.l
Representative Rartiott of Oeorsrii,
were at the white house to urge the
appointment of Judge Joseph R. La
mar, democrat. Senators Penrose
and Dick and former Senator Spooner
all talked of the supreme court with
the president. It can be authorit
atively stated that while the list of
eligibles is daily narrowing, no ap
pointment will be announced until

WOMEN WANT
STORES SHUT
W. C. T. U. Members Favor Idea
of Closing to Business on Sat
urday Nights.
SEX IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR PRESENT SYSTEM
Effort Will be Made to Get All
the Women of the City Agreed
on a Public Sentiment Which
Will be Paramount.
The closing of the stores Saturday
nights is to be attempted by members
of the Women's Christian Temperance
unions of the city. While it in real
ized that no effeorl along this line
would be fair until after tho holiday
season is over, they feel that for the
sake of the clerks, who often do not
gel started for their homes until 11:30
p. m., this ought to bo done.
"It in women who are responsible
for the stores keeping: open," said
one member. "Several of the firms
are ready and willing to close, only,
of course, they cannot be expected to
do so, if their business rivals refuse
to. I know personally of women who
do this needless Saturday night shop
ping: women who can go down any
afternoon In the week, but who sel
fishly, thiv.inh perhaps its because
they haven't thought of the matter on
both sides, put off making their pur
chases until late Saturday. Clerks
tell me that any number of women,
promenading up and down the eve
nue, run into this store and that, get
the clerk to take down bolt after
bolt of goods, look them over and
then say, 'Well, I didn't Intend to buy
anything tonight. 1 am .lust looking.
I will come in early In tho week.
And the clerks have to put back all
| those holts of cloth beforo they can
leave the store to go home."
Requires Public Sentiment.
It was suggested that tho matter
was one requiring a public sentiment
and since the women are the chief
offenders, it was thought advisable to
take it up with tho various women's
rlubs of the city, asking members to
personally refrain from Saturday night
shopping and to endeavor to have tho
stores closed.
"Girls ko homo so tired Saturday
nights." said another member "that
they sleep late Sunday mornings, are
too tired to go to church and Sunday
school: .Inst sit around, 10010 of them
have told men, nil day, too tired to
even comb their hair. With many or
them too, working for $r, or $(i B
week, Sunday has to be given over
to washing, ironing and mending. I
know perfectly nlen fjlrls who spend
their Sunday this way. They have to,"
Get Pnrttjf Worker.
At a joint meeting of tlio Xorth
Yakima and Frances Willarrt unions
held yesterday afternoon in the Chris
tian church it was decided to bring
Mrs. Mary Brown, W. C. T. IT. worker
who has done much In tho cause of
social purity under the, auspices of
the West Washington W. C. T. IT. dur
ing the past two weeks, to Yakima
county for two weeks or more, Kf
forts will be made to have Wnpato,
Toppenish, Zillah and tho lower val
ley town get Mrs. Brown to work
with then, also. Meetings for moth
ers will be held, and work done
through th« schools.
"I should like to have n meeting
brought about In which the working
girls of the city could be told some
of tbe things they ought to know,"
said one member.
Talk for Illßli School Girls.
"I should like to have the high
school girle told certain things as
well," said another member.
It was stated that one of the troub
les with the puhllr schools In the city
lay Just here and that any work which
would tend to a betterment of condi
tions was work well worth th<i doing.
Feeling that better progress Is made
1 if a frequent opportunity Is given the
members of all the unions to talk over
such matters as these, a motion was
, carried to have Joint meeting! Of the
urjonw once a month, on a separate
I day from the bi-monthly meetings of
, tbe Individual ufilon*. The flrrt Mon-
Any iifternoon of oarh month was
phofien, and a special Invitation to tin:
1 newly organized Frultva!« union to
attend will tio given.
