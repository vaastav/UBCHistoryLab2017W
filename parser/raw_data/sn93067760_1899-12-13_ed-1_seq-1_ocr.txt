Have Stable Governments.
To tho Sonato and House of Kipreson
tatlvos :
At tho threshold <?f your dollbora
tioiiH, you aro called to mourn with
your countrymen ih>. death of Vico
President llobart, who pushed from
this lifo on tho n.' i nlug of Novombor
21st, last. Iiis groat soul uo'v roata in
eternal poaoe. >T ur'./ato lifo was
puro and elevated, while his public
career waa over distinguished by largo
capacity, Btnlnlens integrity and ex
alted motives. He baa been romovod
from the hlgn ollloo which ho honored
and dignified, but his lofty character,
his dovotlon to duty, hia houoaty of
purpose and noble virtues remain with
us as a prlcelcsa legacy and example.
The fifty-sixth Congress convenes in
Its ?rat regular session with tho emu
try in a condition of unusual pros
perity, of universal good will among
tho people at homo, and in relations of
peace and friendship with evory gov
ernment of tho world. Our foroign
commorco has shown great Increase in
volume and valuo. The combined im
ports and exports for tho year aro tho
largest ever shown by a single year In
all our history. Oar f xports for 1899
alono excoed by more man a billion
dollars our imports and exports com
bined iu 1870. The impor s per capita
aro 20 per cent, less than In 1,870, while
tho oxporta per capita t?ro 58 per cent,
more than in 1870, showing tho en
larged capacity of tho United States
to Batiafy the wants of its own increas
ing population aa well as to contri
bute to those of tho peoploa of other
nations.
Exports of agricultural products
wore $784,770,142. Ol manufactured
products we exported in valuo $333,
602,140, hotng larger than any previous
year. It la a noteworthy fact that the
only years in all onr history when tho
product; of our manufactories Bold
abroad exceeded those bougnt abroad
were 1898 and 1899.
Government receipts from all sources
for tho fiscal year, onding Juno 30,
1809, including $11,708.314 14 part pay
ment of tho Central Pooifio Uallroad
indebtedness aggregated $010.982,004.
30. Customs receipts woro $200,128,
401.75 and those from Internal revonuo
$273,437,101.51. For tho fiscal yoar,
tho expenditures woro *700,093,504.02,
leaving a deficit of $89,111,549 07.
Tho Becretary of tho treasury esti
mates that the rcce pts for the current
fiscal yoar will aggregate ?010,958,112
and upon the basis of present appro
priations tho expenditures will aggro
gate $000,958,112, loaving a surplus of
$40,000,000,000.
For tho ?ecal year onded June 30,
1899, the internal revenue receipts
Increased about $100,000,000.
The present gratifying strength of
the treasury is shown by tho fact that
on December 1, 1899, the availablo
cash balance was $278,004,837.72, of
which $239,744,905.30 was In gold coin
and bullion. Tho confidence which
prevails throughout tho country has
brought gold into rnoro gonoral uso and
custom receipts are now almost entire
ly paid In that coin.
The strong condition of the treasury
with rcBpoct to cash on hand and the
favorable showing made by tho re
venues bavo made It possible for tho
secretary of tho treasury to take action
undor the provisions of 3094, revlsod
statutes, relating to tho sinking fund.
Receipts oxceoded expenditures for
tho first five months of the current
fiscal year by $12,413,380.81 and, as
mentioned above, the secretary of the
treasury estimates that there will be
a surplus of approximately $40,000,000
at tho end of tho yoar. Under such
conditions, it was deemed advisable
and proper to resume compliance with
the provisions of the sinking fund law,
which for eighty years has not been
dono because of doficlonclos in tho ro
venues. Tho treasury department,
therefore, olio red to purchase during
Novombor $25,00u,000 of tbo 6 per cent,
loan of 1904 or the 4 per cent, funded
loan of 1907 at the curront market
price. The amount offered and pur
chased during Novombor was $18,408,
000. The premium paid by tho govern
ment on such pure.hii qs was $2,293,521
and the not saving in Interest) was
about $2,885,000. Tho success of this
operation was sufficient to induce the
government to continue the offer to
purobaso honda to and including the
23rd day of Dccombor Instant, unless
the remainder of tho $25,000,000 called
for should bo presented in tho mean
time for redemption.
, v DEMANDS TUE OOr.D STANDARD.
Tbo attention of Congress Is respect
fully Invited to this important matter
with tho view of ascertaining whether
or not such reaeonablo modifications
can be <\ade in the national bank act
as wi.i render Its servloo in the parti
cular here referred to more respon
sive to tho peoplo's needs. I again
urge that national banks be authorized
to organize with a capital of $25,000.
I urgently recommend that to sup
port tbo existing gold standard and to
maintain " the parity In value of tho
coins of the two motala (gold and
silver), and the equal powor of ovory
dollar at all times in tbo market and
in the payment of all debts," the secre
tary of the treasury bo given addi
tional powor ard charged with the
duty to seil United States bonds and to
employ such other effective moana as
may bo necessary to these ends. The
authority should Inoludo tho power
to sell bonds on long and short time, as
conditions may require, and should
provide for a rato of. nterest lower than
that fixed by the a :t of January 14,
1815. While there la no commercial
fright whloh withdraws gold from the
government, but on the contrary, suoh
widespread contldenoo that gold seeks
the treasury demanding paper money
In exohange, yet the zery situation
points to tho present as the most
fitting time, to make adequate provision
to insure the oonttnuanoe of the gold
standard and of public confidence in
the ability and purpose of the govern
ment to meet all of its obligations In
tho money which, the olvlll/.od world
reeognlzos as the best. The financial
transatlons of the government are con
ducted upon a gold hauls. We receive
gold when we soil United States bonds
and uso gold for their payment. We
are maintaining the parity of all the
money Issued or oolned by the au
thority of the government. We are
doing theso things with iho means at
hand. Happily at tho present timo we
aro not compelled to resort to loans to
supply gold. It has been done in tho
past, however, and may have to bo
dono In tho future It behooves us,
therefore, to provide at once tho best
moans to meet tho emergency when It
arisos and tho best moans aro those
which are the moet eortalu and econ
omical. Those now authorized have tho
virtuo notthor of directness nor econ
omy. Wo havo alroady eliminated ono
of ihe causes of our financial plight
and ornhirrassment during tho years
of 1893, 18114, 1895 and 189?. Our re
ceipts now tquai our expenditures; de
licient revenue no longer creates
alarm. Let ue remove tho only ro
maiuing cuuso hy conferring tho full
necessary power upon tho secretary of
tho treasury and Impose upon tho duty
to uphold the prcsont gold standarJ
and presorve the coins of the two
metals on a parity with each other
which is the repeatedly declared
policy of tho United States.
In this connection, 1 repeat my form
er recommendations, that a portion of
the gold holdings shall be placed In a
trust fand from which greenbacks
shall bo redeemed upon presentation,
but when onco redeemed thall not
thereafter bo paid out except for gold.
DENOUNCES TUB TRUSTS.
Combinations of capital organized
iuto trusts to control tbo conditions of
trade among our oltizens, to stille
competition, limit production and do
turnilno the prices of products used
and consumed by the people, are justly
provoking public discussion and should
early claim tho attention of tho Con
gress.
Tho Industrial commission created
by tho uet of Congress of Juno 18, 181)8,
has been engaged in extended hearings
upon the disputed question Involved
In tho subject of combination In re- 1
strahlt of trade anJ competlon. Thoy
have not yc? completed their iuvesti- 1
gatlon of this subject, and the conclu
sion und recommeudutions at which
they may arrive are undetermined.
Tho subject Is one glvlag rise to many 1
dlvorgcnt vlows as to the naturo and
variety or cause and extent of the in
juries to tho public which may result 1
from largo combinations concentrat
ing moro or less numerous enterprises 1
aud establishments which previous to I
tho formation were carried separate- 1
ly. <
It Is universally conceded that com
binations which engross or control tho i
market of any particular kind of mer
chandise or commodity necessary to i
tho general community, by suppress- i
lng natural and ordinary competition, !
whereby prices are unduly enhanced <
to tho goneral consumer, are obnoxious i
not only to the common law, but also 1
to tho public welfare. There must be i
a remedy for tbo evils involved in such i
organizations. If the present law can '
bo extended moro certainly to control ?<
or cheok these monopolies or trusts, (
It should be done without delay. What- i
over power the Congress possesses i
over this most important subject should t
bo promptly ascertained and asserted.
President Harrison, in his annual ,
message of December 2, 1889, says : ,
" Earnest attention should be given ,
by Congress to consideration of tbo ,
question bow far the restraint of those ,
combinations of capital commonly ,
called 'trusts' Is matter of Federal ,
jurisdiction. When organized, as they ,
often are, to crush out all healthy ,
competition and to monopolize the pro- ,
ductlon or sale of an article of com- |
meroe and general necessity, they are ,
dangerous conspiracies against tho ,
public good, and should be made the ,
subject of prohibitory and even penal |
lcgt-latlon."
An act to protect trade and com- ,
merco against unlawful restraints and ,
monopolies was passod by Congress on .
the 2d of July, 1890. The provisions of (
this statute are comprehensive and
stringent. It declares every contract ,
or combination, in the form of a trust .
or otherwise, or conspiracy In the re- '
stralnt of trado or commerce among .
the sevoral states or with foreign na
tions, to bo unlawful. It denominates
as a criminal evory person who matces ,
any such contract or engages In any
such combination or conspiracy, and
provides a punishment by fine or ira- 1
prison merit. It invests the several elr
cult courts of the United States with
jurisdiction to prevent and restrain
violations of tho act, and makes it the
duty of tho several United States dis
trict attorneys, under the direction of
the attorney general, to institute pro
ceedings In equity to prevont and re
strain suoh violations. It further con
fers upon any person who shall bo la
jured in his business or property by
any other person or corporation by
roason of anything forbidden or de
clared to bo unlawful by the act tho
power to sue therefor in any circuit
court of the United States without re
spent to the amount in controversy and
to recover three-fold tho damages by
til in suatalncd and tho costs of the suit,
Including reasonable attorney feos. It
will bo perceived that the act is aimed
at evory kind of combination in the
nature of a trust of monopoly in re
straint of interstate ot international
com meroe.
Proaeoutlon by the United States of
Offensen under the act of 1890 has been
I frequently resorted to In the Federal
courts, and notable efforts la the re
straint of interstate commoroe, suoh
as the trans-Missouri Freight associa
tion and tho Joint Traino association,
have keen successfully opposed and
suppressed.
President Cleveland in hin annual 1
message of December 7, 1896?more
than six years subsequent to the en
actment of this law?after stating the
evils of the trust combinations says:
" Though Congress has attempted to
deal with this matter bj legislation,
tbo laws passed for the purpose thus
far have proved lnoffeetlve, not be
eauao of any luck of disposition or at
tempt to enforce them, but simply be
cause the laws themselves as inter
Sreted by the courts do not reach the
iffloulty. If the insufficiencies of ex
isting laws oan be remedied by further
legislation, It should be done. Tho
fa it must be recognized, however, that
all Fedoral legislation on this subjeot
may fall short of its purpose, hoeau.o
of 1 uheront obstacle* and also because
of tbo complex oharautor of our gov
ornmootal system, which, while mak
ing tho Federal authority nunrurao
within ite sphoro, had carefully limited
that sphere by metcB ar? bounds
which cannot bo transgressed. The
decision of our highest court on this
precise question renders it quite doubt
ful whether tho ovils of trusts aid
monopolies can bo adequately treated
through federal action, unless they
Beek directly and purposely to include
in their objects transportation or In
tercourse between Stales or between
tho United StatOB and foreign cour
tries.
It does not follow, however, that
this is tho limit of tho remedy that
may bo applied. Even though it may
bo found that Federal authority Is not
broad enough to fully roaeh tho case,
there can be no doubt of tho power of
tho several States to act effectively in
tho premises, and thoro should bo no
reason to doubt their willingness to
judiciously oxerciuo such power."
The State legislation to which Pres
ident Clovoland looked for rollof from
the evils of the trusts has failed to ac
complish fully that object. This is
probably duo to a great extent to tho
fact that different States take dlfforent
views as to tbo proper way to discri
minate between evil and injurious com
binations and those associations which
are beneficial necessary to tho business
prosperity of tho country. The great ,
diversity of treatment in ditToront
States arising from this causo and the .
Immediate relations of all parts of tho |
country to each other without regard- <
Ing State lines in tho conduct of busl- <
ness have made the enforcement of <
State laws dilllcult.
It is apparent that uniformity of
legislation upon this subject in tho
several States Is much to be desired.
It is to be hoped that Buch uniformity
founded in a wise and just discrimina
tion betsvoen what is injurious and
what is useful and necessary in busi
ness operations may bo obtained and
that means may bo found for the Con
gress within the limitations of its
constitutions I powor bo to supplement
an effective code of State legislation
so as to muko a complete system of
laws throughout tho United States
adequate to compel a general obser
vance of the salutary rules to which
we have referred.
The whole question is so Important
and far-reaching that I am sure no
part of It ?will bo lightly considered
but every phase of of it will hayo the
studied deliberation of Congress, re
sulting in wise and judicious action.
THE TENSION HOLL.
On tho 30th of June, 1899, the pen
sion roll of the United Statos num
bered 991,519. Those include the pen
sioners of the army and navy in all our
wars. The number added to the toIIb
during the year was 40,991. Tho num
ber dropped by reuson of death, ro
marrlage, minors by legal limitation,
failure to claim within three years and
other causes were 43,180, and tho num
ber of claims disallowed was 107,919.
During the yoar 89,034 pension certifi
cates wore issued, of which 37,077
were for new or original ponslons. The
amount disbursed for army aud navy
ponslons during the year was $138,355,
052.95, which was $1,051,401.01 less than
the sum of appropriations.
The Grand Army of the Republic,
at Its recent national encampment,
held at Philadelphia, has brought to
my attention and to that of the Con- ?
gross the wisdom and justice of a modi- <
tic tiou of the third section of tho act
>f ? ' one 27,1890, which provides pen- (
5ions for the widows of officers and on- {
listed men who serve ninety days or |
moro during the war of tke rebellion ',
and wero honorably discharged, pro- ;
rlded that such widows are without ,
>tber means of support than their |
lally labor and were married to tho |
soldier, sailor or marine, on account of \
whose service they claim pension prior |
to the date of tho act.
The prosont holding of tho depart- i
meat is that if the widow's income, i
aside from her dally labor, does not
sxceed In amount what hor pension :
would be, to-wit, $90 per annum, she I
would be deemed to be without other 1
means of support than her dally labor, <
and would be entitled to a ponslon 1
under this act, while If the widow's in- 1
some, independent of the amount re '
solved by her as the result of her dally i
labor, sho would not be pensionable <
ander the act. 1 am advised by the i
commissioner of pensions that tho 1
?mount of tho Income allowed beforo <
title to ponslon would bo barred has !
varied widely under different arrange- <
ments of tho pension office, as well as |
luring dlfferont periods of tho same 1
administration and has been the cause 1
)f just complaint and criticism.
With the approval of the seorotary i
:>f the interior, the commissioner of
pensions recommendd that in order to
make practice at all times uniform <
and to do justice to tbo dependent ,
widow the amount of Income allowed
Indepeudent of the proceeds of her
dally labor should be not less than $250 .
per annum, and be urges that the Con
gress shall so amend tbo aot as to per- ,
mit the pension office to graut fen- ,
Blonable status to widows under tho
terms of the third seotion of the aot of
June 27, 1890, whoso Income, asido
from the proceeds of dally labor, Is not
in excess of $250 por annum. I believe
this to be a simple aet of justice and
heartily recommend It.
The Dawes commission reports that
gratifying progress has boon made In
Its work during the preceding year.
The Hold work Of enrollment of four
of the nations has boon completed. I
recommend that Congress at an early
day make liberal appropriation for
educational purposes In tho Indian
territory.
?HE TWELFTH CENSUS.
Ia accordance witb the act of Con
gress approved March 3, 1899, the pre
liminary work in connection with the
twelfth census is now fully under way.
The officers required for the proper ad
ministration of the duties imposed hav e
been selected. The provision for secur
ing a proper enumeration of the popu
lation as well as to secure evidence of
the Industrial growth of the nation Is
I broader and more comprehensive than
I any similar legislation In tke past.
The d lrector advises that every needful
effort Is belngtmado to push this great
wore to completion In the time llmltod |
by the statute. It Is believed that the
twelfth census will emphasize our re*
markable advance in all that pertalas
to national progress.
Under tho authority of the act of
Congress approved July 7, 1808, the
commission, consisting of the secretary
ol tho treasury, the attorney general
and the secretary of the interior, has
made an {agreement of settlement,
I which had my approval, of the lndebt
I r Iness to the government growing out
o" the issuo of bonds to aid in tho con
struction of the Central Pacific and
Western Padfio railroads. The agree
ment secures to the government tho
principal and Interest of said bonds
amounting to $58,812,715,48. There
has been paid thereon $11,762,543,12,
whloh has been covered into the trea
sury and the remainder payable within
ton years, with Interest at thu rato of .'I
pur cent, per annum, payable sotnl-an
uually, la secured by tbo depoait of an
equal amount ol lirst mortgage bonds
of tho Pacific rail way companies.
The amounts paid and secured to bo
pall to the government on account of
tho l'aelllc railroad subsidy claim are:
Unior Paolflo, cash $58,448,223,74;
Kansas Pacific, oash ,$(> 303,000: Oen
tral and W^btorn PauiQo cash $11,798,
314,14; notos, aecurel $ 17,000.172,:i0:
Kansas City dividends, for detlciency
duo United States, cash $S2I 807. 70:
making a total of $124 421,007,95.
Tho whole indebtedness was about
$i:i0,0t0,000, moro than half of which
conalsted of accrued interest, for which
Bum the government has realized tho
entire amount, 'ess about $0,000,000,
within a period o? two years.
AGRICULTURE.
Tho department of agriculture is
constantly consulting thu neuJs of the
producers In all tho States and Territo
ries. It is introducing seeds and plants
of great value and promoting fuller
diversification of crops. Grains,
grasses, fruits, legumes and vegetables
aro imported for all parts of tho United
States. Under this oncouragemcut the
sugar beet factory multiplies in tho
North and far West, eeml-troplles
plants are sent to the South, and conge
nial climates are sought for tho choice
productions of tho far Kaot. Thohybri- .
di/Jng '-ult trees and grains is con- .
ducted ^ ?no search for varieties ad- J
aptod to tho exacting conditions. Tho j
introduction of tea gardens in tho t
?Southern States promises to provide ,
amployment for idle hands, as well as to ?
?upply the homo market wi'h tea Tho j
subject of Irrigation, whero It Is of ?
vital importance) tothopcoplo, is being
carefully studied; stops aro being tak
en to reclaim injured and abandoned
lands, and information for tbe people
along these lines is being printod and
distributed. Markotsaro being sought
and opened up for surplus farm and
factory products in Europe aud Asia.
Tho outlook for tho education of tho
young farmer through agricultural col
leges and oxporiment stations, with
opportunity givon to speciall/.3 in tho
department o.' agriculture, is very pro
mlslng. Tho people of Hawaii, Porto
Rico and the Phllippino islands should
bo helped by the establishment of ex
periment stations to a moro seiontillc
knowledgo of tbe prosecution of coffee,
India rubber and other tropical pro
ducts, for which thero is a demand in
tho United Statos. Thero is wide
spread interest In tho productlcn of our
highways at tho prosent time, and tho
department of agriculture is co-oper
ating with tho people in each locality
in making tho host possible roads from
local material and in experimenting
with steol tracks. A moro Intelligent
systom of managing tho forests of tho
country is being put into operation and
a careful study of tho whole forestry
problem is being conducted throughout
tho United States. A very extensive
and comploto exhibit of tho agricul
tural and horticultural products of tho
United States Is being prepared for tho
Paris oxposltion.
T1IK PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
History of Their Purchase, the incur
reel Ion ami McKinley'? Recommen
dation?.
On the 10th of December, 1898, the
treaty of peace between the United
States and Spain was signed. It pro
vided among other things that Spain
should deed to the United States tho
Archipelago known as tho Philippine
islands, that tho United States should
pay to Spain tbo sum of twenty mil
lions of dollars, and that the civil right
and political status of the native in
habitants of tho territories thus ceded
to tho United should bo dotormlnod by
the Congress. The troaty was ratified
by the Senate on tho 0th of February,
1899, and by tho government of Spain
on the 19th of Marcli following. Tho
ratifications -wore exchanged on the
Uth of April, and the treaty publicly
proclaimed. On the 2d of March the
Congress votod tho sum contemplated
by the treaty and the amount was paid
over to tho Spanish government on
the 1st of May. In this manner tho
Philippinen caice to the Unltod Statos.
The Islands were codod by the govern
ment of Spain, which had beon in un
disputed possession of them for centu
ries. They woro accoptod not merely
by our authorized agents In Paris un
ier tho dlroctlon of the oxecutlvo, but
by the constitutional and well consider
ed action ot the representatives of the
people In both housos of Congross. I
had evory reason to believe and I stli.
believe that this transfer of sovereignty
was in accordance with tho wishes and
aspirations of the great massos of tho
Philippine peoplo.
From tho earliest moment, no oppor
tunity was lost of assuring tho people
of the Islands of our ardont deslro for
tholr welfare and of tho intention of
this government to do everything pos
sible to advance thoir Interests. In
my order of the 19th of May, 1898, the
commander of the military expedition
dispatched to the Philippines was in
structed to declaro that wo came not
to make war upon tho people of that
country, " nor upon any party or fac
tion among them, but to protect them
in their homos, In their employments
and In thoir porsonal and religious
rights "; that there should bo no doubt
as to tho paramount authority there,
on the 17th of August it was directed
that " there must bo no joint occupa
tion with the Insurgents ; that tho
United Statos must preserve tho peace
and protect persons and property with
tbo territory occupied by their military
and naval forces ; that the insurgents
and all othors must rocogni'/e tbo mili
tary occupation and authority of tho
United States." As oarly as Decem
ber 2-lth, before tho cossloa and in anti
cipation Of that event, the commander
In Manila was urged to restore peace
and tranquillty and undortako the es
tablishment of a boneflcont govern
ment which should afford tbo fullest
security to life and property.
On tho 21st of December, aftor tho
treaty was signed, the commander of
the forces of occupation was instructed
I " to announco and proclaim in tho most
fmblie mannor that we oame, not as
n vadorn and conquerors, but an frlonds,
to protect tho natives in their homes,
in tholr employments and In their per
sonal and religious rights."
On the samo day, while ordering
General Otis to see that tho peace
should be preserved in Hollo, he was
admonished that " it Is most important
that there should be no conflict with
the insurgents. On the 1st day of
January, 1899, urgent orders were reit
erated that tho kindly Intentions of
this government should be in every
possible way oommunioated to the in
surgents. On tbe 21st of January, I
announced my inaction of dispatching
to Manila a ooramlss' u composed of
three gentlemen of tL- highest oha.*
aoter and distinction, thoroughly ao
qualnted with tho Orient, who In asso
ciation with Admiral Dewey, and Ma
jor General Oils, were lnstruoted to
" faollitate the most humane and ef
teotlve extension of authority through*
out tho ialauda und to si cure with the
least pussiblo delay tho benefits of u
wiso und generous proteotlon of life
und property to ttio inhabitants."
Those gentlemen wero Dr. Jacob G.
Schurman, president of Cornell Uul
vorslty ; Hon. Charles Dcnby, for many
years minister to China, and I'rof.
D -an Worcester, of tho University of
Michigan, who hud made a moat care
ful study of life In tho i'hilipplncs
V/hilo the treaty of peace was under
consideration In tho iSeDato these com
missioners set out on their mission of I
pood will und liberation. Their char
acter was sufliclont guaranty of the
bcnclieient purpose Jwlth which tboy
wont, ovon if they had not borne tho
positive Instructions of this jrovcrn
nif nt, which made their errand pre
eminently one of peace and friend
ship.
But before their arrival at Manila
tho sinister ambition of a few loaders
of tho Filipinos had created a situation
full of omburrassmcat lor tho United
States and most grievous in its conso
quonces to themsolvos. Tho clear and
Impartial preliminary report of the
commissioners, which I transmit I "re
with, gives bo lucid and oomprohei ve
a history of tho present lnsurrec.on
ary movomont that tho story need not
bo here repeated.
It Is not enough to say that the
clulm of the robol louder thnt ho was
promised independence by any olll
?er in th3 United States in return for
his ussistance has no fouudatiou iu fact
ind is categorically denied by tUo very
witnesses who were called to prove It.
The most tho insurgent leader hoped
or when ho camo to Manila was tbo
iboratlon of tho islands from thn
Spanish control, which thoy had boon
laboring for years without success to
throw off.
The prompt accomplishment of this
work by the American army and navy
gave him other idoas and ambitions,
and insidious suggestions from various
quartors porvorted tho purposes and
intentions with which ho had taken up
arms.
No sooner had our army captured
Manila than tho Filipino forces began
to assume an attitude of suspicion uud
hostility which tho utmost efforts of
our ofllcers and troops woro unable to
discern or modify. Their kindness and
forboaranco wore taken as proof of
cowardice. Tho aggroesions of tho
Filipinos continually lncrouscd until
finally, just before tho time sot by tho
Senate of tho United Slates for a vote
upon tho treaty, an attack:, ovldonlly
prepared lu advance, was made all
along the American linos, which re
sulted In a terribly destructive and
sanguinary repulse of tho Insurgents.
Ten days later an order of tho insur
gent government was Issued to its ad
herents who had remained in Manll;
of which General Otis justly observes
that " for barbarous Intent It is ua
equalled in modern times." It directs
that at 8 o'clock on the tight of Febru
ary 15th, tho territorial military shall
come together In the streotB of San
Pedro, armed with their bolos, with
guns and ammunition where conveni
ent, that Filipino families shall be
respected, but that all other Individ
uals, of whatevor raco they may bo,
shall be exterminated without any ,
compassion, after the extermination of
tho army uf occupation, and adds:
" Brothers, wo must avomjo ourselvoc
on the Americans and exterminate,
that wo may take our rovongo for the ,
Infamies and treacheries committed
upon us. Bavo no compassion upon
them ; attack them with vigor." A
3opy of this fell, by good fortune, into .
the hands of our ofllcerB and thoy woro
Able to take measures to control tho
rising which was actually attempted on
tho night of February 22, a week later
than was originally contemplated.
A considerable numbor of armed la- i
?urgonts entered tho city by watarivayi
snd swamps and In concert with eon
federates Inside, attempted to destroy
Manila by uro. Tuoy were kept in ,
meek during tho night and the next
lay driven out of tho city with hoavy
loss. This was the unhappy condition ,
d affairs which confronted our com
missioners on their arrival In Manila. ,
They had come with the hope and In- ,
lentlon of eo operation with Admiral
Dewey and Major General Otis la es
tablishing peace and order in tho ar- '
3hlpelago, and the largest measure of ?
ielf-governmont compatible with tho
true welfare of the people. What they ,
actually found can be best set forth Id
their own words : " Deplorable as w.. ? I
Is, the one In which wo aro now > - ,
gaged was unavoidable by us. We
wero attacked by a bold, adventurous
end enthusiastic army. No alterna
tive was loft to us except ignominious
retreat.- ,
" It Is not to bo conceived that any (
American would have sanctioned tho
surrender of Manila to the Insurgents.
Our obligations to othe.* nations and
tho friendly Filipinos and to ourselves
and our flag demanded that force
should be met by force. Whatevor tbo
future of tho Philippines may be, there
Is no course open to us now oxcopt tho
prosecution of tho war until tho lr.sur
Roots are reduced t > submission. The
commission Is of the oplnlo i that there
has been no time s'nee tho destruction
of the Spanish squadron by Admiral
Dewey when It was possible to with
draw our forces from tho lalanus, either
with honor to ourselves or with safety
to the inhabitants."
Tho course thus cloarly indicated
has been unflinchingly pursued. Tho
rebellion must bo put down. Givll gov
ernment cannot be thoroughly estab
lished until orderod it restored. With
a devotion and gallantry worthy of Its
most brilliant history, the army ably
and loyally assisted by the navy, has
carried on this unwelcome but most
righteous campaign with richly do
servod success. Tho noblo solf-sacrlflco
with which our soldiers ani sallois
whoso terms of service had oxpirod,
refused to avail themselves of their
right to roturn homo as long as thoy
were nocded at tho front, forms ono of
the brightest pages In our annals.
Although thoir operations have boon
somewhat interrupted and checked by
a rainy soason of unusual violence and
duration, they have galnod ground
steadily in every direction and now
look forward confidently to speedy
oompl/tion of their task. Tho unfavor
able (lrcumetancos connocted with an
active campaign have not boon per
mlttod to interforo with the equally
Important work of reconstruction.
A notable beginning has boon made
In tho establishment of a govornmont
In tho Island of Nogroa, which is de
serving of special consideration. This
was tho first island to accept American
sovereignty. Its citizens unreservedly
proclaimed allegiance to the United
States and adopted a constitution look
ing to the establishment of a popular
governmont. It was Impossible to
guarantee to the people of NegroB that
the constitution so adopted should be
the ultimate form of government. Such
a quoetloa under the treaty with Spain
and In accordance with our constitu
tion and laws oame exclusively within
the jurisdiction of Oongress. The gov
I ernment actually set up by tho Inbabi
taute of Negroa eventually proved un<
satisfactory to tho natives themselves.
A. now system was put In force by or
der of the major general command
ing tho department of which the fol
lowing aro the most importaut tie
menu :
It was ordered that tbe government
of tho island of Negros should consist
of a military government appointed by
t..e United States military governor of
tbo 1'uiiipplncB and a civil governor
and hd advisory council elected by tho
people. The military governor was au
thorized to appoint st cretarics of tbe
trensurv. Interior, ni'rioiilture. ir..l?lir.
Instruction, an attorney general and tin
auditor. Tho seat of government was
fixed at Haeoiod. The military gover
nor exorcises tho suprem? rxecutivo
powor. lie is to soo that tho laws a. e
executed, appoint to olTieo and till all
vacancies In ofliuo not otherwise pro
vided fur, and may, with tho approval
of the military governor for the
Philippines, remove any oflioer from
office, The civil governor advises the
military governor on all public ques
tions, und presides over tho advis
ory council. Ho, In goneral, performs
the duties whicu are performed by
secretaries of state in our own system
I of govornmont.
Tho advisory council consists of eight
members elected by tho people within
territorial limits, which are defined
in tho order of tbo commanding gen
eral.
Tbo timo and places of holding elec
tions are to bo fixed by tho military
governor of tho island of Nogros.
The qualifications of voters aro as fol
lows :
1. And a voter must boa .ualo citi
zen of tho island of Nogros.
'2. Of the nvn of twi>nt.?.f n#? i>?.
3. ilo shall bo able to apeak, read
and write tho English, Spanish or
Vieayaa language, or ho must own
real property worth ?500 or pay a rent
al on real property of tho valuo of
$1,000.
4. Ho must have rcsidod In the Island
not loss than one year preceding, and
In tho district In which he offers to
reglstor as a voter not Iljs than throe
months Immediately preceding the
tltuo he offers to register.
5. He must register at a time fixed
by law before voting.
6. Prior to Puch registration he 6hall
have paid all taxes duo by him to tho
government, provided that no Insane
person eha 1 bo allowed to roglstbr or
70te.
Tno military governor has the right
to vote all bills or resolutions adopted
by the advisory council, and his veto
is linal if not disapproved by the mili
tary governor of tho Philippines. Tho
advisory council discharges all tho or
dinary duties of a legislature. The
usual duties pertaining to said offices
aro to bo performed by the secretary of
tho treasury, interior, agriculture,
public Instruction, the attorney gtneral
and the auditor.
Tho judicial powor Is vei ie.'1 In three
judges, who aro to bo appointed by the
military governor of the island. In
ferior courts are to bo est fished.
Preo public schools are to be estab
lished throughout tho populous dis-1
tricts of the islaad, In which the Eng
lish language shall bo taught, and this
subject will recolva the careful con
sideration of the advisory council.
Tbo burden of govcrnmont must be I j
distributed equally and equitably
among tho people. Tho military aut I
thorltlcB will collect and rccolve tho ,
customs revenue and will control po3tal
matters and Philippine inter island
trade and ooinmorce.
Tho military governmont, subject to I
approval of tho military governor of I
tho Philippines, dotermlnos all quos
tloua not specifically provided for, and I
whi h do not come under the jurisdic
tion of tho advisory council.
I communtcato these facts to the I i
Congress for its Information and ac-11
tlon. Rvorything Indicates that with L
tho speedy suppression of the Tagalo I <
rebellion, lifo in the archipelago will I i
soon rcsumo its ordinary course under I
the protection of our sovereignty and i
tho people of theso favored islands will I
enjoy a prosperity and a froedom which I ;
they bare nover boforo known. Al-I
ready hundreds of schools aro open 11
and filled with children. Ueliglousl
freedom Is sacredly assured and en- <
joyed. Tho courts are dispensing jus-11
tice. Business is beginning to circulate i
in Its accustomed channels. Manila, 11
whoso inhabitants wero fleeing to the 11
country a few months ago is now a It
populous tbrUlng mart of commerce. 11
Tho earnest and unremitting endeavors I
at tbe commission and the admiral and I!
major general commanding the depart-11
ment of the Pacific to assure the peo-11
plo of the benefielrnt Intentions of this
government, have had their legitimate
offect In convincing the great majority I
of them that peace and safety and pros- i
perity and stable government can only
be. found in a loyal acceptance of the
authority of tho Uultod Statos.
" THEY ARB OURS "
The future government of the Philip-1
Bines rests with the Congross of the I
nltsd States. Pow gravor responsi-1
billtlcs have ever beon confided to us.
If we accept them in a spirit worthy of
our race and our traditions, a great op-1
portunlty comes with thorn. The is
lands Ho under tho shelter of our Hag.
They are ours by every title of law and
equity. Tboy cannot bo abandoned. If I
wo dosort them, we leave them at once I
to anarchy and finally to barbarism. I
Wo fling them, a golden apple of dis
cord, among tho rlvl powers, no one of I
which COUld permit another to soizo
them unquestioned.
Their rich plains and valleys would I
be the scone of endless strife and blood
shed. Tho advent of Dewey's floot Inj
Manila bay Instead of being, as wo I
hope, the dawn of a now day of free-1
dem and progress, will have boen the
beginning of an era of misery and I
vlo'ence. worse than any which ha? I
dark rued _ the! r unhappy past. Tho I
suggestion has boen made that we I
could renounce, our authority ovor tbo I
islands and giving thorn independence I
could retain a protectorate over them.
This proposition will not bo found, 1
am suro, worthy of your serious atten
tion. Such an arrangement would <n
volve at the oulsot a cruol breach of
faith. It would place the peaceful and
loyal majority who ask for nothing
octtor than to accept our authority, at
the mercy of tbo minority armed in
surgents. It would make us responsi
ble for tho acts of the Insurgent lead
ers and give us no powor to oontro1
thum. It would ohargo us with tbe
t?sk of protecting them aga'nst each
other and defending thorn against any
foreign power with which they chose
to quarrel. In short, It would tako
from the Congress of tho United States
tbe pov er of declaring war and vest
that tremendoas prerogative In the
f agalo leader of the hour.
' It does not seem desirable that I
should recommend at this time a spool
to and final form of government for
those Islands. When peace shall be
rc3torcd, It will be the du?y of Con
g'_9B to const aot a plan of govern
I ment whlob ?lall establish and main

6till existing and when it terminates
further information will be required
as tu tho actual condition of affairs be
fore inaugurating a permanent scheme
of civil government. Tho full report
of tbo commission, now in preparation,
will contain information and sugges
tions which will bo of value to Congress
and which I whi transmit as soon as
it Is completed. As long as tho Insur
rection continues, the military arm
must necessarily bo supremo. But
thero it no reason why stops should not
bo taken from time to time to inaugur
ato governments essentially popular In
their form as fast as territory is held
or joutrollod by our troops. To this
e^u, 1 am considering the advisability
of the return of tho commission, or
such ol t .c members thereof as can be
secured, to aid tho existing authorities
and facilitate this work throughout
the Islands.
I have believed that reconstruction
should not begin by the establishment
of a central government on tho islands
with its seat at Manila, butrather that
tho work should bo commenced by
building up from tho bottom, first es
tablishing municipal governments and
then provincial governments, a centre I
government at last to follow.
Until Congress chall have made
known tho formal expression of its will,
1 shall use tho authority vested in me
hy the constitution und thu statutes to
uphold the sovereignty of the United
Slates in those distant islands, as wall
as in all other places where the flag
rightfully floats. 1 shall put at the
disposal of the army ant. navy all the
means which tho liberality of Congress
and tho people have provided to cause
this unprovoked and wasteful Insur
rection to ceuso. If uuy orders of mine
woro tequlredto Inoure the merciful
conduct of military and naval opera
tions they would not be lacking, but
every ttep of progress of our troops has
been marked by a humanity which has
surprised even the misguided Insur
gent,. Tbo truest kindness to them
will bo a swift and olTeetive defeat of
their present leader. The hour of vic
tory will be tho hour of clemency and
reconstruction. No ?Hort will be spar
ed to build up the waste places deso
lated by war and by long years of mis
government. Wo shall not wait for
the end of dtrife to begin the bene
ficent work. We shall continue, as we
have begun, to open the schools and the
churches, to set tho courts in opera
tion, to foster Industry and trade and
agriculture and in ovory way la our
powor to make these people whom
providence has brought within our
jurisdiction, feel that It is their liberty
and not our power, their welfare and
not our gain, wo aro seeking to en
hance. Our flag has never waved over
any community but In blessing. I bo
llevo the Filipinos will rocognize tho
fact that It has not lost its gift of bene
diction in this world wide journey to
their shores.
CUBA AND PORTO UICO.
We Must Keep Haoretl the rirdge to
Qlvo Cuba Her Freedom?Our Iso
lations With Spain.
My annual message of last year was
necessarily dovoted in great part to a
consideration of the Spanish war aad
jf the rosults it wrought and tho con
ditions It imposed for the future. I 1
kin gratlfiod to nnnounco that tho
treaty of poaco has restored friendly
relations between the two powers.
Elect has been givon to Its Important
provisions. The evacuation of Porto (
liico having beon already accomplish
ad on October 18, 181)8, nothing re
mained necessary thoro to continue
tho provisional military control of tho
Island, until tho Congross should en
act a suitable governmont for the
uodod territory. Of tho character and
loope of the measures to that end I
shall treat In another part of this
message.
Tho withdrawal of tho authority of
Spain from tho Island of Cuba was of
[ectod by tho first of January so that
the full ro-ostahllshmunt of peaco
found tho relinquished territory hold
by us in trust for tho Inhabitants,
maintaining under thu direction of the
executive such government and con
trol thorein as should conserve public
order, restore tho productive condi
tions of poaco so long disturbed by tho
instability aud disorder which pro
vailed for the greater part of the pre
ceding threo decades, and build up
thai tranquil development of tho do
mestic state whereby alone can bo re
alized the high purpose as proclaimed
In the joint resolution adopted by the
Congress on the 19th of April, 1898, by
which the United States disclaimed
any disposition or control ovor Cuba,
except for tho pacification thereof,
and asserted Its determination when
that was accomplished to lcavo tho
governmont and control of the islund
to its people. Tho pledgo contained
in this resolution is of tho highest hon
orable obligation and must be sacredly
kopt.
1 boliovo that substantial progress
has boon made In this direction. All
the administrative measures adopted
in Cuba have almod to fit for a regen
erated existence by enforcing tho su
premacy of law and justice, by placing
wherever practicable tho machinery
of administration in tho hands of In
habitants: by instituting uocded sani
tary roforms ; hy sproatMng education ;
by fostering Industry and trade; by In
culcating public morality, and, In
short, by taking overy rational stop to
aid tho Cuban people to attain to that
piano of solf-oontcious respect and relf
rollant unity which tits an enllghtenod
community for self govornmont within
its own sphere, while enabling It to
fulfill all outward obligations.
This nation has assumed before tho
world a grave responsibility for tho
future good govornmont of Cuba. Wo
have accepted a trust tha fulfillment
of which calls for honesty and integrity
of perpose and the exorciso ol the
highest wisdom. The now comraittuo
yot to arise from tho ashes of the past
must needs be bound to US by ties of
singular Intimacy and strength If its
enduring wolfaro Is to be assurod.
Whether thoso ties shall ho organic or
conventional, tho dottlnlos of Cuba aro
in somo rightful form and manner
irrevocably linked with our own, but
how and how far Is for tho future to
determlno la tho rlponets of events
Whatever be the outcome, wo must
soo to It that free Cuba oe a reality,
aot a name, a perfeot unity, not a
hasty experiment bearing within its .if
the elements of failure
Our mission, to accomplish which
wo took up the wages of battle, \t> aot
to be fulfilled by turn'ng adrift any
loossly framed common-wealth to
face the vicissitudes which too often
attond weaker Statos whoso natural
wealth and abundant resources aro off -
set by tho Incongruities of thoir poll
tlcal organization and tho recurring
occasions for internal rivalries to sap
their strength itnd dissipate their en
ergies. The ereatost blessing which
can come to Cuba Is the restoration of
her agricultural and Industrial pro
perlty, which will give employment
to Idle men and re-establish tho pur
suits of peace This is her chief and
Immedlato need.
On tho 10th of August, lat, an orders
wan made for tho taking of the census
In tho Island, to bj completed on the
3th of November. Hy the treaty of
peace tho Spanish people on the island
have until April 11, 11)00 to elect
whether they will remain oltiz 'tis of
Soaln or become citizens of Cuba.
Until then it cannot be definite
ly ascertained who shall be onthlod to
participate in the formation of tho
government of Cuba. Hy that time
tho results of tho census will have baen
tabulrted and we shall pr >c od to pro
vide for elections which will commit
the municipal governments of the la
land to tho ofllcors elected hy the peo
ple. Tho experience thus acquired
ahull prove of great value in toe for
mation of a representative convention
of the people to draft u constitution
and establish a general system of inde
pendent government for the island, in
the meantime, and BO long us we ex
ercise eontrol over tho island, the pro
ducts of Cuba should have a market iu
the United Stules on as good terms and
with as favorable rates of duly as a: e
given to tho West India islands under
the treaties of reciprocity which shall
he made.
For the relief of tho distressed in tho
I iland of (Juba, tho war department
has issued supplies todestitute persona
through tho ofliecrsof tho army, which
liavo amounted to 6,493,000 rations, at
a cost of (1,417,654 87.
To promote tho disarmament of the
Oubau volunteer army and in the in
terest of public peace, and the welfare
of tho people tho sum of $75 was paid
to each Cuban soldier borne noon tho
authenticated rolls, on condition that
ho should deposit his arms with the au
thorities designed by the United States.
The sum thus distributed aggrogated
$2,547,750, which was paid from tho em
ergency fund provided for by tho act
of January 5, 1899, for that purpose.
Out of the Cuban island revenues
during the six months, ending June
3o, 18DU, $1,718,014.20 was expended for
si'.ultution, $293,881 70 for charities and
hospitals, and $88,944.03 for aid to tho
destitute.
Following the oxehange of the rati
fications of tho treaty of peace, tho
two governments accrodlted ministers
to each other, Spain sending to Wash
ington the duko d'Arcos, nn eminent
diplomatist previously stationed in
Mexico, while tho United States trans
ferred to Madrid Hon. itolamy Storer,
Its clnistor at Brussels. This was
followed by tho respective appoint
ment of consuls, thereby fully resum
ing the relations interrupted by the
war. In addition to its consular repre
sentation In tho United States the
Spanish government has appointed
consuls for Cuba, who have been pro
visionally recognized during the mili
tary administration of affairs of that
Island.
Judicial lntorcourso between the
courts of Cuba and Porto Rico and of
Spain has boon established, as providod
by tho treaty of peace. Tho C iban
political prisoners in Spanish penal
stations havo been and are being re
leased and returned to tuc'r homes, in
accordance with Article v'l of the
troaty. Negotiations uro about to be
had for defining tho conventional rela
tions betwoon the two countries, which
foil Into abeyance by reason of the war.
I trust thoso will Include a favorablo
arrangement for commercial recipro
city under tho terms of Sections 3 and
4o the current tarllf net. In these, as
In all mattors of international concern,
no effort will he spared to respond to
the good disposition of Spain, and to
cultivate In all practicable ways tho
Intimacy which should prevail between
two nations whoso past history has so
often and In so many ways been marked
by sincoro friendship and hy commun
ity of lntorests.
I would recommend appropriate leg
islation In order to carry into execu
tion Artloio VII of the treaty of peace
with Spain, by which the United
States assured the payment of certain,
claims for Indemnity of its oit'z ns
against Spain.
LAWS POH PORTO RICO.
I recommend that legislation bi had
with reference to tho governing of
Porto Rico. Tho time is ripe lor the
adoption of a temporary form of gov
ernment for tills island and many sug
gestions made with reference to Alas
ka are applicable to Porto Kico.
The system of civil jurisprudence
now atloptod by tho people of this
Island Is described by competent law
yers who are familiar with it, hi thor
oughly modern and scientific, so far u-t
{ it relates to matters of Internal busi
ness, trade, production and social aa i
private rights In general.
The cities of the Island uro governed
by charters which probably reuuire
very llttlo or no change. So that with
relation to mattors of local concern and
prlvato right, it Is not probable that
much If any legislation Is desirable;
but with roforonce to publio adminis
tration and the rolation of the Islauds
to tho Federal government, there aro
many mattors which aro of pressing
urgency. Tho sumo necessity oxists
for legislation on tho part of Congress
to establish Fodoral eourtBund Foieral
jurisdiction in the island as has beon
provlously pointed out by mo With ref
erence to Hawaii. Besides tho admin
istration of justice, there aro the onh?
j iCts of tho public lands, the control of
r'tvors and harbors, the eontro of tho
waters of streams not navigable, which
under the Spanish law belonged io tho
crown of Spain, and have, by the treaty
of ceselon, passed to tho United States;
the Immigration of people from foreign
countries, tho importation of contract
labor, the imposition and collection of
Internal revenue, tho application of the
navigation latfs, tho regulation of the
current money, tho establishment of
postofile.es and postroads, tho regula
