-fl,e occurrence of the twenty-fourth election of
ji^r^^Biief magistrate lias afforded another opportunity
PUKIHK the people of lie United States to exhibit to
world a significant. example of the peaceful
n«l fate transmission of the power and authority
irrn emineiit from the public servants whose
irrns "f -Siei' are about to expire, to their newly
bti?en successors. This example cannot fail to
topress profoundly, thoughtful people of other
buntries with tic"advantages which republican
istitutions afford. The immediate, general, and
acquiescence of all good citizens, in tlie
ult of the election, -rives gratifying assurance to
mr country. and to its friends throughout the

l«t found in any other form of government.
SE TIoS* ALIS.M.
Continued opposition to the full and free enjoy
pentof the rights of citizenship, conferred upon
colored people by the recent amendments to
constitution, still prevails in several of the
te slav e-holding states. It has. perhaps, not
en manifested in the recent election to any large
latent ill acts of violence or intimidation. It has.
however. bv fraaduelnt practice:' in connection
jrith ballots, with the regulations as to the places
inl manner of voting, and with counting, retiirn
jr' and canvassing the \otes cast, been successful
^J,Alefeati ig the exercise of the right preservative
lilt! ^Kfall rights, the right suffrage: which the con-
S^^Etitution expressly eoiiti rs upon our enfranchised
^^Eitizens.
^1 It is ilie desire of the good people of the whole
toimtrv that sectionalism as a factor in our pol
ities should disanpear. They prefer that no sec
lion of the country should be united in sound op
position to any other section. The disposition to
j-efure a prompt and hearty obedience to the
coual rights amendments to the constitution, is all
lli'at no'.v stands in the way of a complete obliter
ation of sectional lines in our political contests.
\s lull" as either of these amendments is flagrant
ly violated or disregarded, it is safe to assume
that the people who placed them in the constitu
(tion. as embodying the legitimate results of the
it-ar for the Union, and who believe them to be
|wiseand necessary, will continue to act together,
id to insist that tliev shall be obeyed. The par
amount question still is. as to the enjoyment of
[tlie right by every American citizen who has the
lre'|iiisite qualifications, to freely cast hi.- vote and
fto have it honestly counted. With this question
I rightly settled, the country will be relieved of the
Icontentions of the past bygones will indeed be
by
guiles and political and party issues with re
lEl'icet to economy and efficiency of administration,
[internal improvements, the tariff, domestic taxa
tion, education. finance, and other important suo
fjeets. will then receive their full share of atten
Ition but resistance to. and nullification of. the re
Isults of the war. will unite together in resolute
(purpose for their support till who maintain the
lauthoriiy of the government and the perpetuity of
ftlie Union, and who adei[itatelv appreciate the
value of the victory achieved. This detcrmina
ition proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling
Ito any part of the people of our country, or to
I any of their interests. The in\iolabilitv of the
(amendments rest upon the fundamental princi
[pal of our government. They arc the solemn ex
j.ression of the will of the people of the United
States.
The sentiment that the constitutional rights of
[all our citizens must be maintained does it grow
tweaker. It will continue to control the govern
Iment of the country. Happily, the history of the
flate election shows that in many parts of the
(country where opposition to the fifteenth amend
Iment has heretoiore prevailed it is diminishing,
|and is likely to cease altogether, if firm and vvell
1
considered action is taken by congress. 1 trust
the house of representatives and the senate, which
have the right to judge of the elections, returns
sand qualifications of their own members, will see
S to it that every case of violation of the letter or
I spirit of the fifteenth amendment is thoroughly
investigated, and that no benefit from such viola
tion shall accrue to any person or party. It will
fix the duty of the executive, with sufficient ap
propriations for the purpose, to prosecute unspar
ingly all who have been engaged in depriving
I citizens of the rights guarranteed to them bv the
constitution.
IV I S E I E
In my former annual message. 1 have asked
the attention of congress to the urgent necessity
of a reformation of the eivil-servii system of tin
government. .My views concerning the danger.
of patronage or appointments for personal 01
partisan considerations, have been strengthened
hy mv observation and experience in the execu
tive office, and I believe these dangeis threaten
the stability of the government. Abuses so ser
ious in their nature cannot be permanently toler
ated. They tend to become more alarming with
the enlargement of administrative service, as the
growth of the country in population increases the
number of officers' and placemen employed.
The reasons are imperative for the adoption of
fixed rules for the regulation of appointments,
promotion? anil removals, establishing a uniform
method, having exclusively in view, in every in-
stance, the attainment of the best qualifications
for the pesition in question. Such a method alone
is consistent with the equal rights of all citizens,
and the most economical and efficient administra
tion of the public business.
Competive examinations, in aid of impartial ap
pointments and promotions, have been conducted
or some years past in several of the executive
departments, and by uiy direction this system has
been adopted in the Custom Houses and post
offices of the larger cities of the country. In the
city of New ork overtwu thousand positions in
the civil service have been subject, in their ap
pointments and tenure of place: to the operation
ot published rules for this purpose, during the
past two years. The results of these practical
trials have been very satisfactory, and have con
firmed my opinion in favor of this system of se
lection. All ar" subjected to the same tests, anil
the result is free from prejudice hy persunal favor
or partisan influence. It secures for the position
applied for the best qualifications attainable
among the competing appliants. It is an ef
fectual protection from the pressure of impor
tunity which, under any other course pursued,
largely exacts the time and attention of appoint
'ng the officers, to theirgrcut detriment in the dis
charge of other officials duties, preventing the
abuse of the service for the mere furtherance of
prorate or party purposes, anil leaving the em
ploye of the government, freed from the obliga
tions imposed by patronage, to depend solely up
wmerit for retention and advancement, and with
this constant incentive to exertion and improve
ment.
These invaluable results have been attained in
a
high degree iu the offices where 'lie rules for ap
pointment bv competitive examination have been
applied.
A method which has so approved itself by ex
perimental tests at points where such tests may
be fairly considered conclusive, should be ex
tended to all subordinate positions under the gov
ernment. I believe that a strong and growing
public sentiment demands immediate measures for
^tiring and enforcing the highest possible
efficiency in the civil service, and its protection
from recognized abuses, and that the experience
feferred to has demonstrated the feasibility ot
sweh measures.
The examinations iu the custom houses and
post offices have been held under many embaras
JJients and without provision for compensation
for the extra labor performed by the officers who
have conducted tlieui. ami whose comendable in
erest in the improvement of the public service
has induced pecuuiary reward. A coutiuuance of
these labors gratuicusly ought not to be expected,
aim without an appropriation by congress for
compensation, it is not practicable" to extend the
system of examinations generally throughout the
en il service. It is also highly important that all
such examinations should be conducted upon a
uniform system and under general suuervision.
section 1.753 of the Revised Statutes authorizes
he president to prescribe the regulations for ad
mission to the civil service of the United States,
this purpose to employ suitable persons
conduct the requisite inquiries with refer
ence to "the fitness of each candidate, in respect
j.oage. health, character, knowledge and ability,
lbe
branch of service into which he seeks to
enter:' but the law is practically inoperative for
Want of the requisite appropriation.
rcf,,re
recommend an appropriation of
*•£,000 per anuum to meet the expenses of a com
•^ssion, to be appointed by the president in ae
coruapce with the terms of this section, whose
aty it ahull be to devise a just, uniform and ef-
,ent
system of competitive examinations, and to
the application of the same throughout
tire civil service of the government. 1 am

titir.r, heck upon the pernicious eompe

oiion!! office, will be the substitution of an
competition of merit between the applicants,
VOL. V.
iu which every one can make his own record, with
the assurance' that his •success will depend upon
if alone.
I. I also recommend such legislation as. while leav
ing every officer as free as any other citizen to ex
press his political opinions and to use his means
for their advancement, shall also enable him to
feel as safe as any private citizen in refusing all
demands upon his salary for political purposes. A
law which should thus guarantee true liberty and
justice to all who are engaged in the public ser
Vicc. and likewise contain stringent provisions
against the use of oSieial authority to coerce the
political action of private citizens or of official
subordinates grcatlv to be desired.
THE SPOILS SYSTEM.
The most serious obstacle, however, to an im
provement of the civil service, and especially to a
reform in the method of appointment and re
moval, has been found to be the practice, under
what is known as the spoils system, by which the
appointing power has been so largely encroached
upon by members of congress. The first step ill
the reform of the civil service must be a complete
divorce between congress and the executive in the
matter of the appointments. The corrupting
doctrine that "to the victors belong the spoils, is
inseparable from congressional patronage as the
established rule and practice of parties in power.
It onics to be understood by applicants for office,
and by the people generally, that representatives
and senators are entitled todispurse the patronage
of their respective districts and states. It is not
necessary to recite at length the evils resulting
from this invasion of the executive functions. The
true principles of government on the subject of
oppointments to office, as stilted in the national
conventions of the leading parties of the country,
have again and again been approved by the
American people, and have not been called in
question in any quarter. These authentic expres
sions of public opinion upon this all-important
subject, are the statement of principles that be
long to the constitutional structure of the govcrn
ncnt.
"Under the constitution, the president and
heads of the departments ate to make nominations
tor office. The senate is to advise and consent to
appointments, and the house of representatives is
to accuse and prosecute faithless officers. The
best interest of the public service demands that
these distinctions be respected, that senators and
representatives, who may be judges and accusers,
should not dictate appointments to office"' To
this end the co-operation of the legislative depart
ment of the government is required, alike by the
necessities of the ease and by public opinion.
Members of congress will not be relieved from the
demands made upon them with reference to ap
pointments to office until, by legislative enact
ment, the pernicious practice is condemned and
forbidden.
It is therefore recommended that an act be
passed defining the relations of members of con
gress with respect to appointment to office by the
president, and 1 also recommend that the provis
ions of section 1707, and of the sections following,
of the revUed statutes, comprising the tenure-of
oflice act of March 2. 18(7. be repealed.
Relieving that to reform the system and meth
ods of the civil service in our country is one of the
highest and most imperative duties of statesman
ship. and that it can be permanently done only by
the co-operation ot the legislative ami executive
departments of the government, I again com
mend the whole subject to your considerate at
tention.
POLYGAMY.
It is the recogniz.'d duty and purpose of the
people of the United States to suppress polygamy
where it now exists in our territories, and to pre
vent its extension. Faithful and zealous efforts
havL'been made by the United States authorities
in Utah to enforce the laws against it. Kxperi
ence has shown that the legislation upon this sub
ject to be effective, requires extensive modifica
tion and amendment. The longer action is de
layed the more difficult it will be to accomplish
what is desired. Prompt and decisive measures
are necessary. The Mormon sectarian organiza
tion which upholds polygamy has the whole pow
er of making and executing the local legislation
of the territory. By its control of the grand and
and petit juries, it possesses large influence over
the admininistration of justice. Kxercising, as
the heads of this sect do, the local political power
of the territory, they are able to make effective
their hostility to the law of congress on the sub
ject of polygamy, and. in fact, do prevent its en
forcement. Polygamy will not be abolished if
the enforcement of the law depends on those who
practice and uphold the crime. It can only be
suppressed by taking away the political power of
the sect which encourages and sustains it. The
power of congress to enact suitable laws to pro
tect the territories is ample. It is not a case of
half-way measures. The political power of the
Mormon sect is increasing it controls now one of
our wealthiest and most populous territories. It
is extending steadily into other territories. When
ever it goes it establishes polygamy and sectarian
political power. The sanctity of marriage and
the family relation are the corner-stone of our
American society and civilization. Religious lib
erty and the separation of church and state are
among the elementary ideas of free institutions.
To re-establish the interests and principles which
polygamy and Mormouism have imperiled, and to
fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous immi
grants of all creeds that part of our domain
which has been, in a great degree, closed to general
immigration by intolerant and immoral institu
tions, it is recommended that the government of
the territory of Utah be reorganized.
I recommend that congress provide for the gov
ernment of Utah by a governor and judges, or
commissioners appointed by the president and
confirmed by the senate—a government analogous
to the provisional government established for the
territory northwest of the Ohio, by the ordinance
of 17S7. If. however it is deemed best to con
tinue the existing of local government, I
recommend that the right to vote, hold office and
sit on juries in the territory of Utah be con
fined to those who neither practice nor uphold
polygamy. If thorough measures are adopted, it
is believed that in a few years the evils which
now afflict Utah will be eradicated, and that this
territory will in good time become one of the
most prosperous and attractive of the new states
of the union.
T'OREIGN RELATIONS.
Our relations with all foreign countries have
been those of undisturbed peace, and have pre
sented no occasion for concern as to their con
tinued maintenance.
.My anticipation of an early reply from the
British government to the demand of indemnity
to our fisherman for the injuries suffered by that
industry at Fortune Bay, in January, 1S7S,
which I expressed in my last annual message, was
disappointed. This answer was received only in
the latter part of April in the present year, and
when received showed a failure of accord between
the two governments, as in the measure of the in
shore-fishing privilege secured to our fishermen
by the treaty of Washington, of so serious a
character that I made it the subject of a com
munication to congress, in which I recommended
the measures which seemed to me proper to be
taken by this government in maintenance of the
rights accorded to our fishermen under the
treaty, and towards securing an indemnity for
the injury these interests bad suffered. A bill to
carry out these recommendations was under con
sideration by the house of representatives at the
adjournment of congress in June last.
Within a few weeks I have received a communi
cation from her majesty's government, renewing
the consideration of the subject, both of the in
demnity for the injuries at Fortune Bay, and ot
the interpretation of the treaty in which the pre
vious correspondence hail shown the two govern
ments to be at ariance. Upon both these topics
tile disposition toward a friendly agreement is
manifested by a recognition of our right to an in
demnity for" the transaction at Fortune Bay,
leaving" the measure of such indemnity to further
conference anil by an assent to the views ot this
government, presented in the previous correspond
ence. that the regulation of conflicting interests
of the shore fishery of the provincial seacoasts and
the vessel fishery of our fishermen, should be
made the subject of conference and concurrent
arrangement between the two governments.
I sincerely hope that the basis maybe found
for a Speedy" adjustment of the very serious diver
gence of views in the interpretation of the fishery
clauses of the treaty of Washington, which as the
correspondence between the two governments
gtooil at the close of the last congress, seemed to
be irreconcilable.
INTERNATIONAL FAIRS.
In the important exhibition of arts and indus
tries. which was held last year at Sydney, New
South Wales, as well as in that now in progress at
Melbourne, the United States have been efficient
ly and honorably represented. The exhibitors
from this country at the former place received a
lar'e number of awards in some ot the most con
siderable departments, and the participation of
the United States was recognized by a special
mark of distinction. In the exhibition at Mel
bourne, the share taken by our country is no less
notable, and an equal degree of success is confi
dently expected.
DIPLOMATIC AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONS.
The state of peace and tranquility now enjoyed
bv all the nations of the continent of Europe has,
its favorable influence upon our diplomatic and
commercial relations with them. We have con
cluded and ratified a convention with the rench
republic for the settlement of claims of the citi­
zens
of either country against the other. Under
this convention a commission, presided over by
a distinguished publicist, appointed, in pursuance
of a request of both nations, by his majesty the
emperor of Brazil, has been organized and has
begun its session in this city. A congress to
consider means for the protection of ln
dustral property has recently been eessicmin
Paris to which I have appointed the ministers ot
si--* 3
-^7
the United States in France and in Belgium, as
delegates. The international commission upon
weights and measures also continues its work in
Paris. 1 invite your attention to the necessity
of an appropriation to be made in time to enable
this government to comply with its obligations
under the metrical convention.
Our friendly relations with tlie Herman Empire
continue without interrupptinn. At the recent
international exhibition of fish and fisheries, at
Berlin, the participation of the United States,
notwithstanding the haste with which the com
mission was t'orced^to make its preparations, was
extremely successful and meritorious, winning for
private exhibitors numerous awards of a high class,
and for the country at large the principal prize
of honor offered by his majesty, the emperor.
The results of this great success cannot but be
advantageous to this important and growing in
dustry. There have been some questions raised
between the two governments as to the proper ef
fect and interpretation of our treaties of natural
ization, but recent dispatches from our minister at
Berlin show that favorable progress is making
toward an understanding, in accordance with the
views of this government, which makes and ad
mits no distinction whatever between the rights
of a native and naturalized citizen of the United
States. In practice, the complaints of molesta
tion suffered by naturalized citizens abroad have
never been fewer than at preset.t
There is nothing of importance to note in our
unbroken friendly relations with the governments
of Austria-Hungary. Russia, Portugal, Sweden
and Norway. Switzerland. Turkey and (ircece.
SPAIN.
During the last summer several vessels belong
ing to the merchant marine of this country, sail
ing in neutral waters of the West Indies, were
fired at. boarded, and searched by an armed
cruiser of the Spanish government. The circum
stances, as reported, involve not only a private in
jury to the persons concerned, but also seemed too
little observant of the fru ndly relations existing
for a century between this country and Spain.
The wrong was brought to the attention of the
Spanish government ill a serious pretest and re
monstrance. and the matter is undergoing investi
gation by the royal authorities, with a view to
such explanation or rcpa-ation as may lie called
for by the facts.
The commission sitting in this city for the ad
judication of claims of our citizens against the
government of Spain, is. I hope, approaching the
termination of its labors.
The claims against the United States under the
Flori'la treaty with Spain were submitted to con
gress at the late session, and 1 again invite your
attention to this long-standing question, with a
view to the final disposition of the matter.
MOROCCO.
At an invitation of the Spanish government, a
jonferenee has recently been lieid at the city of
Madrid to consider the subject of protection by
f'.ireign powers of nativ Moors iu the empire of
.Morocco. The minist'T of the United States, in
Spain, was directed to take part in the delibera
tions of this conference, the result of which is a
convention signed on behalf of all the powers
represented. The instrument will be laid before
the senate for its consideration. The government
if the United States has lost no opportunity to
urge upon that of the cinpererot Morocco the
necessity, in accordance with the humane and en
lightened spirit of the age. putting an end to the
peivecutioiis, which have been so prevalent in
that country, of persons of a faith other than the
Moslem and especially of the Hebrew resident? «f
Morocco.
E I
The consular treaty concluded with Belgium
has not yet been officially promulgated, owing to
the alteration of a word in the text by the senate
if the United States, which occasioned a delay,
luring which the time allowed for ratification ex
pired. The senate will be asked to extend the
period for ratification.
E A IT I O N
The attempt to negotiate a treaty of extra
lition with Denina-k failed on account of th- ob
jection of the Danish government to the usual
•lausc providing that each nation should pay the
expense of the arrest of the persons whose exfra
lition it asks.
IN E S E E A I O N S
The provision made by congress at its last ses
sion, for the expense of the commission which had
been appointed to enter upon negotiations with
the imperial government of China, on subjects of
reat interest to the relations of the two coun
tries enabled the commissioners to proceed at
nice upon their mission. The imperial govern
ment was prepared to give prompt and respectful
attention to tlie matters brought under negotia
tion, and the conferences proceeded with such ra
pidity anil success that, on the 17th of November
last, two treaties were signed at I'ekin. one relat
ing to the introduction of Chinese into this coun
try, and one relating to commerce. Mr. Tresent t,
one of the commissioners, is now on his way home
bringing the treaties, and it is expected that tliev
will be received in season to belaid before the
senate early in January.
Our minister in Japan has negotiated a conven
tion for the reciprocal relief of shipwrecked sea
men. I take occasion to urge once more upon
congress the propriety of making provision for
the erection of suitable fire-proof buildings at the
Japanese capital for the use of the American le
gation. and the court house and jail connected
with it. The Japanese government, with great
generosity and courtesy, has offered for this pur
pose an eligible piece of lund.
In my last annual message I invited the atten
tion of congress to the subject of the indemnity
funds received some years ago from China and
Japan. I renew the recommendation then made,
that whatever portion of tfiese funds are due to
American citizens should be promptly paid, and
the residue returned to the nations, respectively,
to which they justly and equitably belong.
NETHERLANDS.
The extradition treaty with the kingdom of the
Netherlands, which has been for some time in
course of negotiation, has, during the past year,
been concluded and duly ratified.
ROL'M ANI A.
Relations of friendship and amity have been es
tablished between the government of the United
States and that of llouinania. We have sent a
diplomatic representative to Bucharest, and have
received at this capital the special envoy who has
been charged by his Royal Highness Prince Charles
to announce the independent sovereignty of Rou
mania. We hope for a speedy development of
•oinmeicial relations between the two countries.
MEXICO.
In my last annual messagel expressed the hope
that the prevalence of quiet on the border between
this country and Mexico would soon become so as
sured as to justify the modification ot the orders,
then in force, to our military commanders, in re
gard to crossing the frontier, without encouraging
such disturbances, as would endanger the peace of
the two countries. Events moved in accordance
with these expectations, and the orders were ac
cordingly withdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of
our own citizens and the Mexican government.
Subsequently the peace of the border was agnin
disturbed by a savage foray, under the command
of the Chief Victoria, but, by the combined and
harmonious action of the military forces of both
countries, his band has been broken up and sub
stantially destroyed.
There is reason to believe that the obstacles
which have so long prevented rapid and conveni
ent communication between the United States and
Mexico by railways, are on the point of disappear
ing, and that several important enterprises of this
character will soon be set on foot which cannot fail
to contribute largely to the prosperity of both
countries.
SI CTII AMERICAN STATES.
New evoys from Guatemala, Columbia, Bo
livia, Venzeucla and Nicaragua have recentlj
arrived at this capital, whose distinction and en
lightenment afford the best guarantee of the con
tinuance of friendly relations between ourselves
and these sister republics.
The relations between this government and that
of the United States of Columbia have engaged
public attention during the past year, mainly by
reason of the project of an interoceanic canal
across the isthmus of P.-.nairia, to be built by
private capital under a concession from the Colum
bian government for that purpose. The treaty
obligations subsisting between the United States
and Columbia, by which we guarantee the neu
trality of the transit and the sovereignty and
property of Columbia in the isthmus, make it nec
essary that the conditions under which
so stupend
ous a change in the region embraced in this guar
antee should be effected—transforming, as it
would, this isthmus, from a barrier between the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans, into a gateway and
thoroughfare between them, for the navies and
merchant ships of the world—should receive the
approval of this government, as being compatible
with the discharge of these obligations on our
part, and consistent with our interests as the
principal commercial power of the western
hemisphere. The views which I expressed in a
special message to congress in March last in re
lation to this project. 1 deem it my duty ngain to
press upon your attention. Subsequent considera
tion has but confirmed the opinion "that it is
the right and duty of the United states to assert
and maintain such supervision and authority over
any interoceanic canal across the isthmus that
connects North and South America as will pro
ject our national interests."
The war between the republic of Chili on the
one hand, and the allied republics of Peru and
Bolivia on the other hand, still continnes. This
government has not felt called upon to interfere
in a contest that is within the belligerent rights
of the parties as independent states. We have,
however, always held ourselves in readiness to
aid in accommodating their difference, and
have at different times reminded both bel
ligerents of our willingness to render such service.
Evil News Rides Fast, While Good News Baits!
CANTON, D. T., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1880.
Our good offices in this direction were recently
accepted by all the belligerents, and it was hoped
they would prove efficacious but I am sorrow to
announce that the measures, which the ministers
of the United States at Santiago and'Lima were
authorized to take, with the view to bring about
a peace, were not successful. In the course of the
war some questions have arisen affecting neutral
rights: in all of these the ministers of the United
States have, under their instructions, acted with
promptness and energy in protection of American
nterests.
The relations of the United States with the em
pire of Brazil continue te be most cordial, and
their commercial intercourse steadily increases, to
their mutual advantage.
The internal disorders with which the Argen
tine Republic has been for some time afflicted,
and which have more or less influenced its ex
ternal trade, «re understood to have been brought
to a close. This happy re.-ult may be expected to
redound to the benefit of the foreign commerce of
that republic as well as to the development of its
vast interior resources.
SAMOA.
In Samoa, the government-.of King Malieota
under the support and recognition of the consular
l'epresensatives of the United States, fireat
Britain, and (lerniany, seems to have given
peace and tranquility to the islands. While it
does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole the
scheme of tripartite local government, which has
been proposed, the common interests of the three
great treaty powers require harmony in their re
lations to tile native form of government, and
this may be best secured by a simple diplomatic
agreement between them, it would be well if the
consular jurisdiction of our resprcscntative it
Apia were increased in extent and importance
so as to guard American interests in the sur

The obelisk, generously presented by the Khe
dive of Egypt to the city of New York, has ar
rived safely in this country, and will soon be erect
ed in that metropolis. A commission lor the
liquidation of the Egyptian debt has lately con
cluded its work, anil this government, at the
earnest solicitations of the Khediv e, has acceded
to the provisions adopted by it, which will belaid
before congress for its iuforniasiou. A commis
sion for the judicial code of the reform tribunal of
Egypt is now in session in Cairo. Mr. Furmau,
consul-general, and J. M. Batcheldcr, Esq., have
been appointed as commissioners to participate jn
this work. The organization of the reform tri
bunals will probably be continued for another
period of fi\ years.

Iii pursuance to the act passed at the last ses
sion of congress, invitations have been extended
to foreign inaratime state.- to join in a sanitary
conference in Washington, beginning the 1st of
January. The acceptance of this invitation by
many prominent powers gives promise of success
in this important measure, designed to establish
a system of international notification by which the
spread of infectious or epidemic diseases may be
more effectually cheeked or prevented. The at
tention of congress is invited to the necessary ap
propriations for carrying into effect the pro
visions of the act referred to.
E A E
The effort of the department of state to enlarge
the trade and commerce of the United States,
through the active agency of consular officers and
through the disssemination of information ob
tained from them, have been uurelaxed. The in
terests in these exports, as developed in our com
mercial communities, and the value o) the infor
mation secured by this means, to the trade and
manufactures of the country, were recognized by
congress at its last session, and provision was
made l'or the more frequent publication of consu
lor and other reports by the department of state.
The first issue of this publication has now been
prepared, and subsequent issues may regularly be
expected. The importance and interest attached
to the reports of the consular officers, are witness
ed by the general demand for them by all classes
of merchants and manufacturers engaged in our
foreign trade, It is believed that the system of
such publications is deserving of the approval of
congress, and that the necessary appropriations for
its continuance and enlargi inent wili commend it
self to your consideration.
The prosperous energies of our domestic indus
tries, and their immense production of the sub
jects of foreign commerce, invite, and even re
quire an active development of the wishes and
interests of our people in that direction. Especi
ally important is it that our commercial relations
with the Atlantic ami Pacific coasts of South
America, with the West Indies and thetiulfof
Mexico should be direct, and not through the cir
cuit of European systems, and should be carried
on in our own bottoms. The full appreciation of
the opportunities which our front on the Pacific
ocean gives to commerce with Japan, China, and
the East Indies, with Australia and the Island
groups which lie along the routes of navigation,
should inspire equal efforts to appropriate to our
own shipping, and to administer by our own cap
ital, a due proportion of this trade, whatever
modifications our regulations of trade and naviga
tion may be necessary or useful to meet anil direct
these impulses to the enlargement of our exchanges
and of our carrying trade. I am sure the wis
dom of congress will be ready to supply. One ini
tial measure, however, seems to be so clearly use
ful and efficient that I venture to press it upon
your earnest attention. It seems to be very evi
dent that the provision of regular steam postal
communication, by and from government, has
been the forerunner of the commercial predomi
nance of (treat Britain on all these coasts and
seas, a greater share in whose trade is now the de
sire and the intent of our people. It is also man
ifest that the efforts of other European nations to
contend with tireat Britain for a share of this
commerce have been successful in proportion with
their adoption of regular steam-postal Communi
cation with the markets whose trade they sought.
Mexico and the states of South America are an
xious to receive such postal communications with
this country, and to aid in their development.
Similar eo-oteration may be looked for. in due
time, from the eastern nations and from Australia.
It is difficult to see liovv the lead in this movement
can be expected from private interests. In re
spect of foreign commerce, quite as much as in in
ternal trade, postal communication seems neces
sarily a matter of common and public administra
tion. and thus pertaining to government. I re
spectfully recommend to your prompt attention
such just and efficient measures as may conduce
to the development of our foreign commercial ex
changes and the building up of our carrying
trade.
Ill this connection I desire also to suggest the very
great service which might be expected in enlarg
ing and faeiliating our commerce on the Pacific
ocean, were a transmarine cable laid from San
Francisco to the Sandwich Islands," and thence to
Japan at the north and Australia at the south.
The great influence of such means of communica
tion on tuese routes of navigation, in developing
and securing the due share of our Pacific coast in
the commerce of the world, needs no illustration
or enforcement. It may be that such an enter
prise, useful and in the end profitable as it would
prove to private investment, may need to be ac
celerated by prudent legislation by congress in its
aid, and I submit the matter to your careful con
sideration.
An additional, and not unimportant, although
secondary, reason for fostering and enlarging the
navy may be found in the unquestionable service
to the expansion of our commerce, which would
be rendered by the frequent circulation of naval
ships in the seas and ports of all quarters of the
globe. Ships of the proper construction and
equipment, to be of the greatest efficiency in case
of maritime war, might be made constant and
active agents in time of peace in the advance
ment and protection of our foreign trade, and in
the nurture and discipline of young seamen, who
would, naturally, in some numbers, mix with and
improve the crews of our merchant-ships. Our
merchants at home and abroad recognize the val
ue to foreign commerce of an active movement
of our naval vessels, and the intelligence and pa
triotic zeal of our naval officers in promoting
every interest of their countrymen, is a just sub
ject of national pride.
FINANCE.
The condition of the financial affairs of
the government, as shown by the report of
the secretary of the treasury, is very satis
factory. It is believed that the present financial
situation of the United States, whether considered
with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing
wealth, or the extent and variety of our resources,
is more favorable than that of any other country
of our time, and has never been surpassed by that
of any country at any period of its history. All
our industry are thriving the rate of interest is
low new railroads are being constructed a vast
immigration is increasing our population, capital
and labor new enterprises in great number are
in progress, and our commcrcial relations with
otner couri'ries are improving.

The amount due the sinking fund for this year
was .'?:!7,!I3I ,GRJ,5j. There was applied thereto
the sum of §7:5,904,617.41, being 072.(17.'*.Sli
in excess of the actual requirements for the
year.
The aggregate of the revenues from all sources
during the fis&tl year ended June 30, 1SS0. was
S333,520,010.98, an increase over the preceding
year ef 099,120.02. The receipts thus far, of
the current year, together with the estimated re
ceipts for the remainder of the year, amount to
.•?:t."0,('00,0U0, which will be sufficient to meet the
estimated expenditures of the year, and leave a
surplus of §90,000,000,
It is fortunate that this large surplus revenue
occurs at a period when it may lie dircetly ap
plied to the payment of the public debt soon to be
redeemable. No public duty has been more con
stantly cherished in the United States than the
policv of paving the nations'debt as rapidly as
possible.
The debt of the United States, less cash in the
treasury and exclusive of accruing interest, at
tained its maximum of §2,756,431,671.43 in
August, 1S05, and has since that time been re
duced to SI,880,019,501.(5. Of the principal of
the debt .§108.758,100 lias been paid since March
1,1877. effecting an annual saving of interest of
ti.107,593 the hinder of interest has
also been diminished by the sale of bonds bearing
a low rate of interest, and the application of the
proceeds to the redemption of bonds bearing a
higher rate. The animal saving thus secured
since March 1, 1877, is §14,290.453.5(1.
Within short period over six hundred mil
lions of 5 and f! per cent, bonds will become re
deemable. This presents a very favorable oppor
tunity not only to further reduce the principal of
the debt, but also to reduce the rate of inter
est on that which will remain unpaid. I call the
attention of congress to the views expressed on
this subject by tlie secretary of the treasury in
his annual report, and recommend prompt legisla
tion, to enable the treasury department to com
plete the refunding of the debt which is about to
mature.
SPECIE PAYMENTS.
The continuance of specie payments has not
been interrupted or endangered since the date of
resumption. It has contributed greatly to the re
vival of business and to our remarkable pros
perity. The fears that preceded and accompa
nied resumption have proved groundless. No
considerable amount of United States notes have
been presented for redemption, while very large
sums of gold bullion, both domestic and imported,
arc taken to the mints and exchanged for coin or
notes. The increase of coin and bullion in the
United States since January 1. 1879, is estimated
at §227,309 128.
There arc still in existence, uncancelled, §34(1,
081,011) of United States legal tender notes. These
notes were authorized as a war measure, made
necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in
which the United States was then engaged. The
preservation of the nation's existence required,
in the judgment of congress, nil issue of lesral-ten
dcr paper money. That it served well the pur
pose for which it was created is not questioned, but
the employment of the notes as paper money in
definitely, after the accomplishment of the object
for which they were provided, was not contem
plated by the framers of the law under which
they were issued. These notes long since became
like" any other pecuniary obligation of the gov
ernment—a debt to be paid, and, when paid, to be
cancelled as mere evidence of an indebtedness no
longer existing. I therefore repeat what was
said in the annual message of last year, that tht
retirement from circulation of United States notes,
with the capacity of legal-tender in private eon
tracts, is a step "to be taken in our progress to
wards a safe and stable currency, which should
be accepted as the policy and duty of the govern
ment and the interest and security of the people.
THE SILVER DOLLAR.
At the time of the passage of the act now in
force requiring the coinage of silver dollars, fixing
their value and giving them legal-tender char
acter, it was believed by many of the supporters
of the measure that the silver dollar, which it
authorized, would speedily become, under tlio
operations of the law, of equivalent value to the
gold dollar. There were other supporters of the
bill, who, while they doubted as to the probability
of this result, nevertheless were willing to give the
proposed experiment a fair trial, with a view to
stop the coinage, if experience should prove that
the silver dollar authorized by the bill continued
to be of less commercial value than the standard
gold dollar.
The coinage of silver dollars, und' the act re
ferred to, began in March. 1878. and ha? been
continued as required by the act. The average
rate per month to the present time lias been
§2,270.492. The total amount coined prior to
the 1st of November last was §72,817,750. Of
this amount §47,084,450 remain in the treasury,
and only §25,703,291 are in the hands of the peo
ple. A constant effort has been made to keep
this currency in circulation, and considerable ex
pense has been necessarily incurred for this pur
pose, but its return to the treasury is prompt
and sure. Contrary to the confident anticipation
of the friends of the measure at the time of its
adoption, the value of the silver dollar, containing
412,'j grains of silver, has not increased. Dur
ing the year prior to tlie passage of the bill au
thorizing its coinage, the market value of the
silver it contained was from 90 to 92 cents, as
compared with the standard gold dollar. During
the last year the average market value of
the silver dollar has been 88H cents.
It is obvious that the legislation of the last
congress in regard to silver,
so far as it was based
on an anticipated rise in the value of silver as a
result of that legislation, has failed to produce
the effect then predicted. The longer the law re
mains in force, requiring as it does the coinage
of a nominal dollar, which, ii: reality, is not a
dollar, the greater becomes the danger that this
country will be forced to accept a single metal as
the sole legal standard of value, in circulation,
and this a standard of less value than it purports
to be worth in the recognized money of the
world.
LEGAL-TENDER MONEY.
The constitution of the United States, sound
financial principles, and our best interests, all re
quire that the country should have as its legal
tender money, both gold and silver coin, of an in
trinsic value, as bullion, equivalent to that which,
on its face, it purports to possess. The constitu
tion, in express terms, recognizes both gold and
silver as the only true legal-tender money. To
banish either of these metals from our currency is
to narrow and limit the circulating medium of
exchange to the disparagement of important in
terests. The United States produces more silver
than any other country, and is directly interested
in maintaining it as one of the two precious met
als which furnish the coinage of the world. It
will, in my judgment contribute to this result if
congress will repeal so much of existing legisla
tion as requires the coinage of silver dollars, con
taining only 412Ji grains of silver, and in its stead
will authorize the secretary of the treasury to coin
silver dollars of equivalent value as bullion, with
gold dollars. This will defraud no man, and will
be in accordance with familiar precedents. Con
gress, on several occasions, has altered tlie ratio of
value between gold and silver, in order to estab
lish it more nearly in accordance with the actual
ratio of value between the two metals.
In financial legislation every measure in the di
rection of greater fidelity in the discharge of pe
cuniary obligations, has been found by experience
to diminish the rates of interest which debtors are
required to pay, and to increase the facility with
which money can be obtained for
every legitimate
purpose. Our own recent financial history shows
how surely money becomes abundant whenever
confidence in the exact performance of moneyed
obligations is established.
WAR DEPARTMENT.
The secretary of war reports that the expendi
tures of the war department for the fiscal year
ended June 30,1880, were $39,924,773.03. The
appropriations for this department for the cur
rent fiscal year, amount to $41,993,630.40.
With respect to the army, the secretary invites
attention to the fact that its strength is limit
ed by statute (section 1,115, revised statutes) to
not more than30,000 enlisted men, but that pro
visos contained in appropriation bills have limited
expenditures to the enlistment of but 25,000. It
is believed the full legal strength is the least pos
sible force at which the present organization can
be maintained, having in view efficiency, disci
pline and economy. While the enlistment of this
force would add somewhat to the appropriation
for pay of the army, the saving made in other re
spects would be more than an equivalent for this
additional outlay^ and the efficiency of the .irrny
would be largely increased.
The rapid extension of the railroad Hystem west
of the Mississippi river, and the great tide of set
lers which has flowed in upon new territory, im
pose on the mditary an entire change of polioy.
•30
The maintenance of small posts along wagon and
stage routes of travel is no longer necessary.
Permanent quarters at points selected, of a more
substantial character than those heretofore con
structed, will be required. Under existing laws,
permanent buildings cannot be erected without
the sanction of congress, and when sales of mili
tary sites and buildings have been authorized, the
moneys received have reverted to the treasury,
and could only become available through anew
appropriation. It is recommended that provis
ion be made, by a general statute, for th! sale of
such abandoned military posts and buildings as
are found to be unnecessary, and for the applica
tion of the proceeds to the construction of other
posts. While many of the present posts are of
but slight value for military purposes, owing to
the changed condition of the country, their occu
pation is continued at great expense and incon
venience, because they a fiord the only available
shelter for troops.
The absence of a large number of officers of
tlie line, in active duty from their regiments, is a
serious detriment to the maintenance of the
service. The constant demand for small detach
ments, each of which should be commanded by a
commissioned officer for necessary service away
from their commands, occasions a scarcity in the
number required for many company duties. With
a view to lessening this drain to some extent, it
is recommended that the law authorizing the de
tail of officers from the active list as professors
of tactics and military science at certain colleges
and universities, be so amended as to provide that
all such details lie made from the retired list of
the army.
Attention is asked to the necessity of provid
iug by legislation for organizing, arming and
disciplining the net
ire militia, of the country, and
liberal appropriations are reccomendeil in this be
half. The reports of the adjutant general of the
army and the chief of ordinauee touching this
subject fully set forth its importance.
The report of the officer in charge of edu
cation in the army shows that there are seventy
eight schools now in operation in the army, with
an aggregate attendance of 2,305 eiiiisteil men
and children. The secretary recomcnds the en
listment of one hundred and fifty schoolmasters
with the rank and pay of commissary sergeants.
An appropriation is needed to supply the judge
advocates of the army with suitable libraries, and
the secretary recomcnds that the corps of judge
advocates be placed upon the same footing as to
promotion, with the other staff corps of the army.
Under the existing laws the bureau of military
justice consists of one officer the judge advocate
general, and the corps of judge advocates, of
eight officers of eoual rank (majors), with a pro
vision that the limit of the corps shall remain at
four, when reduced by casualty
0r
resignation to
that number. The consolidation of the bureau
of military justice, and the corps of judge Advo
cates, upon the same basis with the other staff
corps of the army, would remove an unjust dis
crimination against deserving officers, and sub
serve the best interests of the service.
NATIONAL DEFENSES.
Especial attention is asked to the report of the
chief of engineers upon the condition of our na
tional defenses. From a personal inspection of
many of the fortifications referred to, the secreta
ry is able to emphasize the recommendations
made, and to state that their incomplete and de
fenwless _'ondition is discreditable to the country.
While other nations have been increasing their
means for carrying on offensive warfare anil at
tacking maritime cities, we have been dormant
in preparation for defense nothing of importance
has been done towards strengthening and finish
ing our casemated works since our late civil war,
during which the great guns of modern warfare
and the heavy armor of modern fortifications
and ships came into use among the nations, and
our earthworks left, by a sudden failure of appro
priations some years since, in ali stages of incom
pletion, are now being rapidly destroyed by the
elements.
INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT.
The two great rivers of the North American
continent, the Mississippi and the Columbia, have
their navigable waters wholly within tiie limits of
the UniteiT States, and arc of vast importance to
our internal and foreign commerce. The perma
nency of the important work on the South Pass
of the Mississippi seems now to be assured. There
has been no failure whatever in the maintenance
of the maximum channel during the six months
ended August 9 last. This experiment has open
ed abroad deep highway to the ocean, and is an
improvement, upon the permanent success of
which congratulations may be exchanged among
people abroad and at home, and especially among
the communities of the Mississippi valley, whose
commercial exchanges float in ail unobstructed
channel safely to anil from the sea.
A comprehensive improvement of the Mississip
pi and its tributaries is a matter of transcendent
importance. These great water-ways comprise a
system of inland transportation spread like net
work over a large portion of the United States,
and navigable to the extent of many thousands of
miles. Producers and consumers alike have acom
liioii interest in such unequaled facilities for cheap
transportation, lleographically, commercially and
politically they are the strongest tie between the
various sections of the country. These channels
of c. mmunication and interchange are the proper
ty of the nation. Its jurisdiction is paramount
over their waters, and the plainest principles of
public interest require their intelligent and careful
supervision, with a view to their protection, im
provement, and the enhancement of their useful
ness.
The channel of the Columbia river, for a dis
tance of about one hundred miles from its mouth,
is obstructed by a succession of bars, which occa
sion serious delays in navigation, and heavy ex
pense for lighterage and towage. A depth of lit
least twenty feet at low tide should be secured and
maintained, to meet the requirements of the ex
tensive and growing inland and oecan'comnierce it
subserves. The most urgent need, however, for
this great water-way, is a permanent improve
ment of the channel at the mouth of the river.
From Columbia river to San Francisco, a dis
tance of over 000 miles, there is no harbor on our
Pacific coast, which can be approached during
stormy weather. An appropriation of $150,000
was made by the forty-fifth congress for the com
mencement of a breakwater and harbor of refuge,
to be located at some point between the Straits of
Fuea and San Francisco, at which the necessities
of commerce, local and general, will be best accom
modated. The amount appropriated is thought to
be quite inadequate for the purpose intended. The
cost of the work, when finished, will be very great,
owing to the want of natural advantages for a site
at any point on the coast between the designated
limits, and it has not been thought to be advisable
to undertake the work without a larger appropri
ation. I commend the matter to the attention of
congress.
The completion of the new building for the war
department is urgently needed, anil the estimates
for continuing its construction are especially re
commended.
THE ARMY MEDICAL MUSEUM.
The collections of books, specimens, and records
constituting the Army Medical Museum and li
brary are of national importance. The library
now contains about 51,500 volumes and 57,000
pamphlets relating to medicine surgery, and al
lied topics. The contents of the Army Medical
Museum consist of 22,000 specimens, and are
unique in the completeness with which both mili
tary surgery and the diseases of armies are illus
rated. Their destruction would be an irreparable
loss, not only to the United States, but to the
world. There are filed in the record and pension
division over 16,000 bound volumes of hospital
records, together with a great quantity of papers
embracing the original records of the hospitals
of our armies during the civil war. Aside
from their historical value, these records are daily
needed in the settlement of large number of pen
sion and other claims, for tlie protection of the
needed in the settlement of large number of pen
sion and other claims, for tlie protection of the
government against attempted frauds, as well as
for the benefit of honest claimants. These valu
able collections are now in a building which is pe
culiarly exposed to the danger of destruction by
fire. It is therefore earnestly recommended that
an appropriation be made for a fire-proof build
ing, adequate for the present needs and reasonable
future expansion of thete valuable collections.
Such a building should be absolutely fire-proof
no expenditure for mere architectural display is
required. It is believed that a suitable structure
can be erected at a cost not to exceed $250,000.
A PLACE FOR GRANT.
I commend to the attention of congress the
great services of the commander-in-vhief of our
armies during the war for the Union, whose wise,'
firm, and patriotic conduct did so much to bring
that momentous conflict to a close. The legisla
tion of the United States contains many preced
ents for the recognition of distinguished military
merit, authorizing rank and emoluments to be
conferred for eminent services to the country. An
act of congress authorizing the appointment of a
captain-General of the army, with suitable pro
visions relating to compensation, retirement,
and other details, would, in my judgment,
be altogether fitting and proper, and would be
warmly approved by the country.
THE NAVY.
The report of the secretary of the navy exhibits
the successful and satisfactory management, of
that department during the last fiscal year. The
total expenditures for the year were $12,916,
639.45, having unexpended at the close of the year
$2,141,682.23 of the amount of available appro
priations. The appropriations for the present
fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, are $15,995,
061.45 and the total estimates for the next fiscal
year ending June 30, 1882, are $15,953,751.61.
The amount drawn by warrant from July 1,1880,
to November 1,1880, is $5,041,570.45.
The recommendation of the secretary of the
navy, that provisions be made for the establish
ment of some form of civil government for the
people of Alacka, is approved. At the present
there is no protection of persons or property in
NO. 35.
that territory, except such as is afforded by the
officers of the United States ship Jamestown,
This vessel was dispatched to Sitka, becausc of
the fear that, without the immediate presence of
the national authority, there was impending dan
ger of anarchy. The steps taken to restore order
have been nccepteil in good faith by both white
and Indian inhabitants, and the necessity for this
method of restraint does not, in my opinion, now
exist. If, however, the Jamestown should be
withdrawn, leaving the people, as at present, with
out the ordinary, judicial, and administrative
authority of organized local government, serious
consequences might ensue.
The laws provide only for the collection of rev
enue, the protection of public property, and the
transmissions of the mails. The problem is to
supply a local rule for a population so scattered
and so peculiar in its origin anil condition. The
natives are reported to be teachable and self-sup
porting, and, if properly instructed, doubtless
would advance rapialy in civilization, and a new
factor of prosperity would be added to the nation
al life. 1, therefore, recommend the requisite
legislation upon this subject.
The secretary of tlie navy has taken steps to
wards the establishment of naval coaling-stations
at the isthmus of Panama, to meet the require
ments of our commercial relations with central
and south America, which are rapidly growing in
importance. Locations eminently suitable, both
as regards our naval purposes and the uses of com
merce, have been selected, one on the east side of
the isthmus, at Chiriqui Lagoon, in the Carib
bean sea, and the other on the Pacific coast, at
the bay of Golfito. The only safe harbors, suffi
ciently commodious, on the isthmus, are at these
points, and the distance between them is less than
one hundred miles. The report of the secretary
of the navy concludes with valuable suggestions
with respect to the building up of our merchant
marine service, which deserve the favorable con
sideration of congress.
THE TOSTAL SERVICE.
The report of tlie postmaster general exhibits
the continual growth and the high state of effi
ciency of the postal service. The operations of
no department of the government, perhaps, rep
resent with greater exactness the increase in the
population and the business of the country. In
1S00 the postal receipts were §8,518,067.*40 in
1880 the receipts were §33,315, 479.34. All the
inhabitants of the country are directly and per
sonally interested in having proper mail facilities,
and naturally watch the post office very closely.
This careful oversight on the part of the people
has proved a constant stimulus to improvement.
During the past year there was an increase of 2,
134 post offices, and the mail routes were extended
27,177 miles, making an additional annual trans
portation of 10,804,191 miles. The revenues of
the postal service for the ensuing year are esti
mated at §38,845,174.10, and the expenditures at
§42,475,932, leaving a deficiency to be appropri
ated out of the treasury of §3,030,757.90.
The universal postal union has received the ac
cession of almost all the countries and colonies of
the world maintaining organized postal services,
and it is confidently expected that all the other
countries and colonies now outside the union will
soon unite therewith, thus realizing the grand idea
and aim of .the founders of the union, of forming,
for purposes of international mail communica
tion, a single postal territory embracing the world,
with complete uniformity of postal charges, and
conditions of international exchange, for all de
scriptions of correspondence. To enable the
United States to do its full share of this great
work, additional legislation is asked by the post
in aster-general, tc whose recommendations espe
cial attention is called.
The suggestion of the postmaster-general, that
it would be wise to encourage, by appropriate leg
islation, the establishment of American lines of
steamers by our own citizens, to carry the mails
between our own ports and those of Mexico, Cen
tral America, South America, and of trans-Pacific
countries, is commended to the serious considera
tion of congress.
The attention of congress is also invited to the
suggestions of the postmaster-general in regard to
postal savings.
SUPREME COURT.
The necessity for additional provision, to aid in
the transaction of the business of the federal
courts, becomes each year more apparent. The
dockets of the supreme court, and of the circuit
courts, in the greater number of the circuits, are
encumbered with the constant accession of cases.
In the former court, and in many instances in the
circuit courts, years intervene before it is practi
cable to bring cases to hearing.
The attorney general recommends the establish
ment of an intermediate
court of errors and ap
peals. It is recommended that the number of
judges of the circuit court in each circuit with the
exception of the second circuit, should be increased
by the addition of another judge in the second
circuit that two should be added aud that an in
termediate appellate court should be formed in
each circuit, to consist of the circuit judges and
the circuit justice, and that in the event of the
absence of either of these judges the place of the
absent judge should be supplied by tlie judge of
one of the district courts in the circuit. Such an
appellate court could be safely invested with large
jurisdiction, and its decisions would satisfy suitors
in many cases where appeals would still be al
lowed to the supreme court. The expense in
curred for this intermediate court, will require a
very moderate increase of the approprations for
the expenses of the department of justice. This
recommendation is commended to the careful
consideration of congress.
It is evident that a delay of justice, in many in
stances oppressive and disastrous to suitors, now
necessarily occurs in the federal courts, which
will in this way will be remedied.
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
The report of the secretary of the interior, pre
sents an elaborate account of the operations of
that department during the past year. It gives
me great pleasure to say that our Indian affairs
appear to be in a more hopeful condition now
tlian ever before. The Indians have made grati
fying progress in agriculture, herding, and me
chanical pursuits. Many who were a few years
ago in hostile conflict with the government are
quietly settling down on farms where they hope
to make their permanent homes, building houses
aud engaging in the occupations of civilized
life. The introduction of the freighting business
among them has been remarkably fruitful of good
results, in giving many of them congenial em
ployment, and in stimulating their ambition to
earn their own support. Their honesty, fidelity
and efficiency as carriers arc highly praised. The
organization of a police force of ndians. lias
been equally successful in maintaining law and
order upon the reservations, and in exercising a
wholesome moral influenee- among the Indians
themselves. I concur with the secretary of the
interior in the recommendation that the pay of
this force be increased, as an inducement to the
best class of young men to enter it.
Much care and attention has been devoted to
the enlargement of educational facilities for the
Indians. The means available for this important
object have been very inadequate. A few addi
tional boarding schools at Indian agencies have
been established, and the erection of building has
been begun for several more, but an increase of
the appropriations for this interesting under
taking is greatly needed to accomodate the large
number of Indian children of school-age. The
number offered by their parents from all parts of
the country for education in the government
schools is much larger than can be accommodated
with the means at present available for that pur
pose. The number oflndian pupils at the Nor
mal school at Hampton, Va., under the direction
of Gen. Armstrong, has been considerably in
creased, and their progress is highly encouraging.
The Indian school established by the interior de
partment in 1879, at Carlisie, Pa., under the di
rection of Captain Pratt, has been equally suc
cessful. It has now nearly two hundred pupils of
both sexes, representing a great variety of the
tribes east of the Rocky Mountains. The pupils
in both these institutions receive not only an ele
mentary English education but are also instructed
in housework, agriculture and useful mechanical
pursuits. A similar school was established this
year at Forest Grove, Ore., for the education of
Indian youth on the Pacific coast. In addition to
this, thirty-six Indian boys and girls were
selected from the eastern Cherokees and
placed in boarding-schools in North Carolina,
where they are to receive an elementary English
education and training in industrial pursuits. The
interest shown by Indian parents,
even among the
so-called wild tribes, in the education of their
children, is very gratifying, and gives promise
that the results accomplished by the efforts now
making will be of lasting benefit.
The expenses of Indian education have so far
been drawn from the permanent civilization-fund
at the disposal of the department of the interior
but the fund is now so much reduced that the con
tinuance of this beneficial work will in future de
pend on specific appropriations by congress for
the purpose, and I venture to express the hope
that congress will not permit institutions so fruit
ful of good results to perish for want of means
for their support. On tne contrary, an increase
of the number of such schools appears to me
highly advisable.
The past year has been unusually free from dis
turbances among the Indian tribes. An agree
ment has been made with the Utes. by which they
surrender their large reservation in Colorado in
consideration of an annuity to be paid to them,
and agree to settle in severalty on certain lands
designated for that puipose, as farmers, holding
individual title to their land in fee-simple, inalien
able for a certain period. In this way a costly
Indian war has been avoided, which, at one time,
seemed imminent, and, for the first time in the his
tory of the country, an Indian nation has given
up its tribal existence to be settled in severalty,
and to lire as individuals under the common pro
tection of the laws of the country. The conduct
of the Indians throughout the country, during
the past year, with but few noteworthy exceptions,
has been orderly and peaceful. The guerilla war

band of southern Apaches, has virtually come to
fin end by the death of that chief and most of his
followers, on Mexican soil. The disturbances
caused on our northern frontier by Sitting Bull
find his men, who hail taken refuge in the British
dominions, arc also likely to cease. A large ma
jority of his followers hive surrendered to our
military forces, and the remainder are apparently
in progress of disintegration.
1 concur with the secretary of the interior ill
expressing the earnest hope that congress will at
this session take favorable action on the bill pro
viding for the allotment of lands on the different
reservations in severalty to the Indians, with pat
ents conferring fee simple title inalienable for a
certain period, and the eventful disposition ol' the
residue of the reservations for general settlement,
with the consent and for the benefit of the Indi
ans, placing the latter under the equal protection
ot the laws of the country. This measure, to
gether with a vigorous prosecution of our educa
tional efforts will work the most important and
effective advance toward the solution of the Indi
an problem, in preparing for the gradual merging
of our Indian population in the great body of
American citizenship.
PUBLIC LANDS.
A large increase is reported in the disnosnl of
the public lands for rettlement during the past
year, which marks the prosperous growth of our
agricultural industry, and a vigorous movement
of population toward our unoccupied lands. As
this movement proceeds, the codification of our
land laws, as well as proper legislation to regulate
the disposition of public lands, become of more
pressing necessity, and I therefore invite the con
sideration of congress to the report and the ac
companying draft ot a bill, made by the public
lands commission, which were communicated by
me to congress at the last session. Early action
upon this important rubject is highly desirable.
The attention of congress is ajjain asked to the
wasteful depredations committed on our public
timber lands, and the rapid and indiscriminate de
struction of our forests. The urgent necessity
for legislation to this end is now generally rec
ognized. In view of the lawless character of the
depredations committed, and the disastrous conse
quinces which will inevitably follow their contin
uance, legislation has again and again been rec
ommended to arrest the evil, and to preserve for
the people of our western states and territories,
the timber needed for domestic and other essential
uses.
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.
The report of the director of the geological sur
rey is u, document of unusual interest. The con
solidation of the various geological and geograph
ical surveys and exporting enterprises, each of
which lias heretofore operated on an independent
plan, without concert, cannot fail to be of great
benefit to all those industries the country
which depend upon the development of our min
eral resources. The labors of our scientific men,
of recognized merit, who compose the corps ol
geological survey, during the first season of their
field operations and inquiries, seemB to have been
very comprehensive, and will soon be communi
cated to congress in a number of volumes. The
director of the survey recommends that the in
vestigations carried on by his bureau, which, so
far, have been confined to the so-called public
land states and territories, be extended over the
entire country, and that the necessary appropria
tion be made for this purpose. This.wonld be par
ticularly beneficial to the iron, coal and other
mining interests of the Mississippi valley, and of
the eastern and southern states. The subject is
commended to the careful consideration of con
gress.
PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
The secretary of the interior asks attention to
the want of room in the public buildings of the
capital, now existing and in progress of construc
tion, for the accommodation of the clerical force
employed, and of the public records. Necessity
has compelled the renting of private buildings in
different parts of the city for the location of pub
lic offices for which ii large amount of rent is an
nually paid, while the
separation of offices belong
ing to the same departments impedes the trans
action of current business. The secretary sug
gests that the blocks surrounding Lafayette
square, on the east, north and west, be purchased
us the sites for new edifices, for the accommoda
tion of the government offices, leaving the square
itself intact and that, if such buildings were con
structed upon a harmonious plan of architecture,
they would add much to the beauty of tho na
tional capital, and would, together with the
treasury and tlie new state," navy, and war de
partment building, form one of the most imposing
groups of public edifices in the world.
AGRICULTURE.
The commissioner of agriculture expresses the
confident belief that his efforts in the production
of our own sugar and tea have been encouraging
ly rewarded. The importance of the results at
tained have attracted marked attention at home,
and have received the Bpecial consideration of
foreign nations. The successful cultivation of our
own tea, and the manufacture of our own sugar,
would make a difference of many millions of dol
rs annually in the wealth of the nation.
The report of the commissioner asks attention
particularly to the oontiuueil prevalence of an in
fectuous and contagious cattle-disease, known and
dreaded in Europe anil Asia, as cattle-plague, or
pleuro-pneumonia. A mild type of this disease,
in certain sections of our country, is the occasion
of great loss to our farmers, and of serious dis
turbance to our trade with Great Britain, which
furnishes a market for most of our live-stock nnd
dressed meats. The value of neat-cattle export
ed from the United States for the eight months
ended August 31,1880, was more than twelve.mil
lion dollars, and nearly double the value for the
same period in 1879, an unexampled increase of
xport trade. Your early attention is solicited
to this important matter.
EDUCATION.
The commissioner of education reports a con
tinued increase of public interest in educational
affairs, and that the public schools generally
throughout the country arc well sustained. In
dustrial training is attracting observed attention,
and colleges for instruction, theoretical and prac
tical, in agriculture and the mechanic arts, in
cluding the government schools recently establish
ed for the instruction of Indian youth, are gain
ing steadily in public estimation. The commis
sioner asks special attention to the depredations
committed on the lands reserved for the future
support of public instruction, and to the very
great need of help from the nation for schools in
the territories and in the southern states. The
recommendation heretofore made, is repeated and
urged, that an educational fund be set apart from
the net proceeds of the sales of the public lands
annually, the income of which, and the remainder
of the net annual proceeds, to be distributed on
some satisfactory plan to tlie states and territories
and the District of Columbia.
The success of the public schools of the District
of Columbia, and the progress made, under the
intelligent direction ot the board of education and
the superintendent, in supplying the educational
requirements of tlie District, with thoroughly
trained and efficient teachers, is very gratifying.
The acts of congress, from time to time, donating
public lands to the several states and territories
in aid of educational interests, have proved to be
wise measures of public policy, resulting in great
and lasting
benefit. It would seem to be a matter
of simple justice to
extend the benefits of this leg
islation, tne wisdom of which has been so fully
.indicated by experience, to the District of Colum
bia.
I again commend the general interests of the
District of Columbia to tne favorable considera
tion of congress. The affairs of the district, as
shown by tne report of the commissioners, are in
a very satisfactory condition.
70T0MAC MARSHES.
In my annual messages heretofore, and in my
special message of December 19, 1879, I have
urged upon congress tho necessity of reclaiming
the marshes of the Potomac adjacent to tlie
capital, and lam constrained by its importance
to advert again to the subject. These flats em
brace an area of several hundred acres. They
art an impedient to the drainage of the city and
seriously impair its health. It is believed that,
with this substantial improvement of tis river
front, the capital would be. in all respects, one_ of
the most attractive cities in tho world. Aside
from its permanent population, this city is nec
essarily the place of residence of persons from
ever section of the country, engaged in the pub
lic service. Many others reside here temporarily,
for the transaction of business with the govern
ment.
It should not be forgotten that the land ac
quired will probably be worth the cost of redeem
ing it, and that the navigation of the river will be
greatly improved. I therefore again invite the at
tention of congress to the importance of prompt
provision for this much-needed and too-long-de
ayed improvement.
The water supply of the city is inadequate. In
addition to the ordinary use throughout the oitv,
the consumption by government is necessarily
very great in the navy-yard, arsenal, and the va
rious departments, and a large quantity is re
quired for the proper preservation of the numer
ous parks and the cleansing'of sewem. I reooin-
mend that this subject receive the early atten
tion of congress, and that, in making
provision for an increased supply,
such means be adopted as will nave
in view the future growth of the city. Tempor
ary expedients for such a purpose cannot but be
wasteful of money, and therefore unwise. A more
ample reservoir, with corresponding facilities for
keeping it filled, should,, in my judgement, be
constructed. I commend again to tne attention
of congress the subject of the removal, of their
present location, of the dopots of the several rail
roads entering tne city and I renew the recom
mendations of my former messages in behalf of
the erection of a building for the congressional
library, the completion of the Washington U(a
ument, and'of liberal appropriations in _support
of the benevolent reformatory, and.]
tiolis of the district.
