TI1K CONFISCATION ACT.
On Wednesday, u lettT was addressed by th
Fcclary of State, under the direction of Ibe
President, to Gen. McClcllan, Bitting forth (a
substance) th it slaves coming within the terms
ot the confiscation act, and escaping wllhln ilia
military lines of the army of the Potomac, end
afterwards coming luto tho city of Washlngti n,
arc liable to bo arrested by the city poi'ce,
" upon the presumption, arising from color, 'nf
thty are fujitives from Semite and labor." A ud
It might have been added that they actually
aro so arretted, In numerous Instances, and
subjected to a cruelty of incarceration whirl)
has already attracted the Indignant notice of
Congress
As a remedy for the evils complained of, t'.e
President directs tint escaped slaves ot the
description referred to, shall bo regarded u
rrcedfl into the military protection of il,e
I'nili) Mules,'' and he threatens with mUilnn
nrrest, ' whoever shall undertake to sleze suvh
Uves and deal with them as "fugitives from
"rvii-e " All this is well intended, anil lu
h- days, when so much Is necessarllly d'HiH
through military agencies, it would be quite
unreasonable to object to what Is here pic-poss-d
to be done, in effectuation of a lursl
tijelioent measure of national legislation.
The prubablo effector this order of the Presi
dent will be, to prevent the Interference by
ur city police with any slaves escaping lit in
'he Virginia rebels, whether coining within t"i
niiififcatioii act or not This i a mwi d"K

This order ot the President indicates the im
cesity ol making the confiscation act effective
by prescribing tho proofs which shall establish
the tact that slaves have Iweu employed In tie
miliary service of the rebel, and by furn h
'pr an i.iy method ol prervin such prools
Tbat act was a most Inestimable one. The
number of slave freed by its provisions 1 to
b reckoned, not by tuns of thousands, but by
tmtdreds of thousands, and the number will in
tkiih just so long as Ihls war continues. All
that Isacded to make Ibis grant of freedom

In prenentiug this bill to tLo consideration

United Stales, in which tbe judicial pow r U

the just claims ol his loyal crulitors, to be
held lor the benstlt ol loyal ltizens despoil d
of their properly by the nbelllou, and to de
Iray tbe expenses Inclined in its suppression.
Tho bill ulioforliils ilie claims of ull ribeis,
and those who give tlo in aid and luinfuit, to
the persons they huld in slavery ; decUie-t the
slaves thus forfeited free, and uinKis It ihe
doty of tbe President to piotido loi the colo

It will be observed that adlstlnctiin Ik made
in tbe mode of furieinne of rebel prop'oiy 1 1
dlsincts under lnsurrei tionaty I'ntiol.and thai
whiih maybe Innid in 1l1.1nr.is within tfi
reach ol the process ot law, in its ordinary
forms, the forfcltme In Iho ono oa to be en
forced thiough tho military, and In tho other
through the judicial power.
This Is a matttr of n cessily, for it would b
liuposslblu to eufcrc the forfeiture through
the courts In districts where the judicial power
was overborne by tho rebellion, and if not Im
possible, It would, in my judgment, be clearly
unlonstltutlonal to inforce It in any othsr way
In d strict where tbu properly seized wos wl'.h
In ihe reach of legal process.

It on tha ground which has been advanced In

I Mi'liRMl power. Whichever first lakes hold
vl tne property within its jurisdiction would,
unon nrlnnlnlea of cnrcltv. retain rjossesston
till Its final disposition, upon the same principle
as that of two courts of oonenrrent jurisdic
tion: the one which Bret gets possession of a
case, affecting either persons or property. Is
entitled to retain jurisdiction until its final ills
position. It Is upon this principle, also, that
persona captured by the military authorities In
Insurrectionary districts may still be retalmd
as prisoners by the military power, without In
leilercnce with the courts, till their ctses sre
finally disposed of, notwithstanding they may
for purposes of safety or other reasons nf
late, he brought wltbln districts where the
judicial power Is In full operation. Having
sb in that lh6 military, ctlled forth under Iho
1 institution lo suppress nn insurrection, miy
be vested with all Ihe power necessary to the
end, consistent with the usages of civilized -fur-
faro, it follows, that If hostile armies may ever
confiscate an enemy's property, the right of
ir.o united mates to no u in me case oi me
rehsls Is unquestionable, for surely no war was
ever more atrocious than the one now being
waned by tho rebels lor the overthrow or ibis
Government.
They surely cannot complain of treatment
we would have a right to extend lo foreign nr
mils. The right of seizure and confiscation of
in property oi ine enemy as prize oi war is a
selllut question ol international law, wblcn
tins been affirmed by our own Supreme Court.
1 1 tht cae of Brown u. Tbo United States, re-
ported in 8 branch, tbe court says : " He
sptctlng the power of Government, no doubt
Is entertained. That war gives to the sover
eign full right to take tho persons and conlis
ctto tho property ot the enemy wherever
l und, Is conceded. The mitigations of this
ilid rule, which humane and wise policy of
mo torn umis nas introduced 10 practice, win
more or less affect the exi rcle of this right,
but cannot impair the right itself, Tbat re
mains undiminished, and when the sovereign
authority Bhall choose to bring It Into opera
tiun tbe judicial department must give effect to
Its will But until that will (hall bu expressed
no power ot condemnation can exist In the
court." Tbat case also decides " that the
powtr of conllscaling enemy property is in tbe
legislature " Wheaton, in commenting on the
i no, says : "The property be seized and con
demned as prize ot war without some legisla
tive act expressly authorizing its confiscation.
Ihe Court held that the law of Congress de
claring war was not such an act. That decla
ration did not, by Its own operation, so vest thu
property of the enemy In the Government, as
to suppjrt judicial proceedings for its seizuie
and confiscation. It vested only a right to con
fiscate, the asscrtiou of which depended on the
will ot the sovereign power."
in regard to tbe transfer of private, rights
of property, Wheaton holds this further lao
guagu: "It Is competent for the national au
thority to work a transmutation, total or par
tlal, ol the property belonging to the van
quished party, and if actually confiscated,
tbe fact must be taken for right. But to work
ruch a transfer of proprietary rights, some posi
tlve and unequivocal act of confiscation is es
senllal. Most of tbe nations of Europe acquired
tltlo to territory they pojsess by conquests, and
private persons have derived their titles Irom
that uf the Government, thus obtained."
According to tho modern usage of nations,
pi ivate property oi alien enemies on land has
not geuerallyibecn forfeited, but the right of
lorleiture is unquestionable, and may be exer-
cUed, if necessary, to secure the just ends of
the war, or in retaliation lor rorleltures by tbe
enemy. The rebels, wherever they have the
power, have reized and confiscated the nroner-
ty of loyal men, and this, according even to
mouern usage, as oeiween independent nations,
would give to Ibe United States the right to
confiscate in turn. Much more would they
possess that light as against rebels, who have
causelessly taken up arms against the Govern
ment.
The right to free the slaves of rebels would
be equally clear with that to confiscate tbelr
property generally; lor it is as property that
they profess to h Id them But as one of the
must efficient means for attaining the end for
which tne armies of the Union have been called
forth, the right to restore to them the God-given
llbei ty of which they have been unjustly de
prived, is doubly clear. It only remains to
enquire whether, in making use ot lawful means
to crush th s wicked rebellion, It Is policy to
Confiscate the property of rebels, and take from
llieui tho support uf unrequited labor. Can
there be a question on this point? Who does
not know luat treason has gained strength by
tbu leniency with which It has been treated 1
Yv have dallied with It quite too long already
Instead ot being looked upon as the worsi, ol
Climes, as It really is, it has come to be re
garded us a trivial offence, to be atoned for by
a promise to do so no more. The despollers ot
loyal citizens, the complrators against the
pcuie ot a nation, the plunderers ot the public
property, tbe assassins of liberty, when they
bave fallen into our bands, hive been suffered
lo escape on taking an oath of allegiance, which
mauy havo not scrupled to violate at tbu first
opportunity. Thousands of Industrious and
enterprising business men have beeu ruined by
this rebellion. More than twenty millions ol
people nuw contributing ot their means and
tbelr blood to its suppressions' more thaa 500,000
men, us noble spirits us ever trod the canh in
martial array, now eucamped in tents, and un
dergoing all tbe hardships of a winter campaign ;
thousauds of others now confined In prisons aud
some in dungeons by the libels ; tbu blood if
tbe duUute'resltd, tbe noble-hearted, iho daunt
less und heroic Lyon ; of tho gifted, the elo
quent, Ihe brave and patriotic Baker ; and ul
the hundreds ot other loyal citizens and true
men, shed by ri bel hands, still nplifted for the
slaughter ol thousands more, and the destruc
tion of Iree government. These and a thousand
other considerations, all demand tbat theautbors
of the calamities, and others yet to follow, If they
bave tbe power to lulllct them, should be made
to suffer both in their persons and their proper
ty fur tbe enormous crimes tbey bave been and
aru committing against private rights and pub
lic liberty.
Besides, sir. not to confiscate the property ot
rebels. Is tu offer a premium lo disloyalty, so
long us tney, wnerevir in power, cuonsctlo
Iho property of loyal citizens. Under such a
policy, the rebel's property is safe, let who will
triumph, While Ihe man tiue to bis allegiance,
his country, and bis dig, Is, if within tbelr
power, depolled of all be possesses. Under
such a policy, the path of safety for property
Is to place it ou the road to treason. Is It any
wonder that, uuder such a policy, treason,
wblcb, at first, b id but a partial foot hold in
suchStutis iisMisiouti, Kentucky, Tennessee,
North Carolina, and Virginia, has spread till,
in rimm ol them, It now has complete posses,
slou
Th loyal citizen, in ull the States where
the icbels have sway, knuws that tho penally
lor an avowal of his alleglauco to bis country
is tbo forlelture ol all he has, while, if be for
s ,iars hie allegiance, his propirty Is alike
protected by fiiend and foe. II we would
bring this war to a successful issue, it is high
tlmo It was made as terrible to tbe enemies as
to tbo fiiends of tbe Republic. Mercy and se
em ity to conspirators and rebels in arms
against the Government aru cruelly and peril
lo loyal citizens struggling lor tho preservation
of Ibe Union and maintenance of constitu
ilonal liberty. '1 key who deny their 'allegiance
lo tbo Government bave no right to claim its
protection. Let the Government cease to af.
