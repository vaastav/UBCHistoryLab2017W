J. (. CVhen, the Belasco of Honolulu,

more popular the already very popular

Orpheum theater. He has arranged
with Kiee -it Perkins for about tluOO pho

ers in the eompany. Beginning with
this evening- every lady patron of the
tin -a i er will be given a coupon enti

coupons wiil be given as each lady en

sented. As there are about fifteen members
of the company, an excellent oppor
tunity is given to the ladies of Hono
lulu to acmire a full set of these pho
tographs. There are many handsome-

that the question of whether a delegation shall he sent or not is m to him,
Mr. Haf-h may very easily ,-on.lude that a dilieren.-t- of opinion exists anion

on the side of economy. Furthermore, a man who is employed to represent
our public bodies before Cou-ress, as Mr. Hal eh is, would naturally be loath to
admit that he needed help when his employers, knowing all the circumstances,
had discussed the matter and come to no conclusion.
Upon the question of courtesy to Mr. Hat.-h we Lave but one opinion.
"When he was Hawaiian Minister at Washing on. our people sent on delega
tion after delegation to aid him. Other Hawaiian envoys were similarly helped,
i v,.r.. the,, dit.lo'iiats offended, nor was the service misconstrued.
Instead they welcomed every material evidence from home that their positions striking; women in the Buhler company

would have sent a lobby to Washington on short notice to get anything -worth
that trouble. New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California all the States and
sll the mainland Territories send representative men to Washington to aid
any great Congressional measure which may be vital to them. Xo question of
courtesy is raised or thought of and the need' of massing all the influence pos
sible before Congress is conceded as a matter of course.
The suggestion that the President, having commended certain things in the
interests of Hawaii, will see that the Territory gets them from Congress, would ,
be strange indeed, coming from an American. From gentlemen of foreign birth !
and nationality or of foreign leading, it is excusable, but it would not be ex- j
cusable for an American community to accept such advice. We do things j
somewhat differently at Washington than is done abroad. In Europe a "gov- j
eminent" may control the legislative branch, the two kinds of authority act
ing as a unit. In America the executive and legislative branches have no
such definite cohesion. Often the President may get what he wants from a
Congress of his political faith, especially it his request is backed by the party
platform, but he has no way to command it. The adverse fate of Mr. Koos-
evelt's much-prized reciprocity treaties is an example in point. e know of
these photographs will make a nice
souvenir of the Buhler Company's visit
to Honolulu.

The President likes those who help themselves. He has too much to do in
connection with the affairs of a world power, to shoulder the fight of small
localities for appropriations, nor is he likely to appreciate the -public spirit
which asks him to do so.
Recurring to Mr. Hatch, this paper would like the opinion of the gentle- j

WONDERS OVERLOOKED.
Honolulans would appear to be too easily satisfied with the natural beauties
and attractions lying immediately within the city's gates. The average resi
dent knows Waikiki fairly well, has occasionally visited the Pali, and esteems
himself perfectly acquainted with all that there is worth knowing about Punch-
bowl and Diamond Head. W.ith manifold other wonders, however, and with '
delights innumerable that lie a trifle off the beaten track, he seldom, unless it j

The crater of Palolo possesses many charms. The view to be obtained

of her inscrutable ways. The trail to the crater is a continual delight. It

A dozen similar instances ot treasures ot nature overlooked might be here
cited. The three mentioned will, however, suffice to demonstrate the truth of
the saying that those who live nearest to the world's wonders know least of
them. Only in the local application of the saying, contempt is bred by anv
thiag but familiarity.
If nonolulans generally took the trouble to get acquainted with these
and similar sights, the chances are that they would speedily come to realize
that they would prove attractive to tourists as well and would not be slow to
recognize in fall, cave and crater, a valuable addition to Hawaii's natural
stoek-ia-trade.

The cheerful life isn't altogether a matter of personal
wisdom and pleasantness.
It means rooms that people are glad to come in, willing
to stay in rooms that make a man feel cordial and friendly.
A gray room or a dim room will not accomplish this.
The room that welcomes you must be bright and radiant
ly so.
A room lighted by Electricity is essential for the cheer
ful life, is, in tact, the cornerstone of it.

The news that the Bossia and her sister ships, now at Nagasaki, ran awav
fro Vladivostok when the outbreak occurred there and took refuge in a se
questered Saghalien bay, shows how little confidence the Russian naval officers
bare in their crews. It was the business of the three cruisers to turn their
rus n the mob that was burning buildings and wharves and to help the
autkorities restore order. Instead they turned tail and are still afraid to go
back. It would not be surprising if the Lena, on her arrival at Vladivostok
