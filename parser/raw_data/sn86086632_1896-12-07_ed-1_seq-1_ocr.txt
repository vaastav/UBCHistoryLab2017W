SEESIS TO BE A FACT.
McKinley Will Convene Congress
in Extra Session.
NEWS COMES DIRECT FROM CANTON
Btatementa Made by Friend of the rreal-
dent-Elect Who Uv .Inst Reached
Washington Mark Hanna Inspects the
New Library Hulldlng to See If It la a
Suitable Place to Hold the Inaugural
Hall Congressman Dlngley ou Cuba.
Washington, Dec. 7. There Is practi
cally no longer any doubt of the In
tention of President-elect McKinley to
convene the Flfty-flfth congress In ex
traordinary session early next spring.
There were several arrivals of friends
and confidents of Major McKlnley's di
rect from Canton Saturday who bring
the very positive announcement that
a call for a special session, to be con
vened a few days after the 4th of March
has been decided upon. It is stated by
men In a position to known that this
decision has been definitely reached by
Mr. McKinley since his consultation
with Mr. Dlngley, chairman of the
committee on ways and means, and
Mr. Dlngley had been trusted with the
privilege of making known this inten
tion at the proper time.
Senator Thurston's Conviction.
Senator Thurston, one of the latest
arrivals from Canton, expressed Sat
urday In the most positive terms the
conviction that an extra session will
be called. The senator was one of the
earliest and staunchest supporters of
Mr. McKinley and there Is every rea
son for believing that his utterance is
Dyirru iu u, uegrec, wiuugu me echo.-
tor himself declines to say such is the
case. "All I can say," he said Satur
day, "Is that I have very recently seen
Major McKinley, and that I am con
vinced a session of the next congress
will be called for about the 15th of
March. That ought to be satisfactory.
I cannot Quote any one, but I do not
consider that there Is any doubt on
the point."
"Shall we have the extra session re
gardless of the result of the senatorial
elections this winter?" was asked.
ri edged to the People.
"Yes; the complexion of the senate
will not be allowed to Influence the de
cision at all. The Republican admin
istration has been elected under a
pledge to the people to reform the tar
iff, and Its duty to this country Is to
proceed about that business at the ear
liest possible moment and either to
keep Its pledge or make it manifest
that It Is Impossible to do so. I think
we ought to secure a tariff which could
be put Into effect by the beginning of
the next fiscal year."

MA KK II ANN A IN WASHINGTON.
InxpccU the Library Hiiihling for the In
augural Hall.
Washington, Dec. 7. Hon. M.A.IIan
na. rnairman 01 me itrnuuiicaji nauun
al committee, accompanied by Hon. H.
C. Payne of Wisconsin, arrived In
Washington at 7:40 o'clock Saturday
morning and went to the Arlington
hotel. Mr. Hanna declared that the
purpose of his visit was confined, at
most, exclusively to the making of
preparations for the Inaugural cere
monies next March, and to deciding
some points in connection with the
proposition to remove the headquarters
of his committee to Washington, with
the view of continuing the work of the
committee in preparation for the cam
palgn of 19M.
His first act was to make an inspec
tlon of the new congressolnal library
building with a view to Its reception or
rejection as the place for the inaugural
ball. The eligibility of the building has
been strongly urged by those who think
the selection of this building would do
much to disarm the criticism of those
who. on principle, oppose an Inaugural
festival. Mr. Hanna was accompanied
In his Inspection of the building by Mr.
Payne and several other friends.
Mr. Payne said, in reply to a question
as to the accuracy of the reports con
cerning Mr. Hanna's intention to call
upon Senator Sherman as the agent, of
Mr. McKinley. with the view of offer
ing the senator the state department
portfolio, that he had no doubt Mr.
Hanna would make a social call upon
the senator, but that if he should do so,
tne lncident need have no special slg-
nlflcance. as they were personal
and political friends.
"I don't believe," said Mr. rayne.
"that the personnel of the cabinet will
(.a riH.ifd for a month yet. or for a
loneer time."
Mr. Pavne declined to discuss the re
port that he would be a member of
McKInley's official nousenom.
I) INC. LET ON CUR A.
No Radical Action To Re Taken by Thla
.Country at Present.
Washlngt4n, Dec. Representative
Dlngley of Maine reached here from
Canton Saturday. He declined to ais-
cuss the cabinet question or anything
rHatlnir to his visit to Major MCKiniey.
He said the Cuban Issue depended upon
th information the president might
rnnvnv to congress. As far as the pub
lic was informed there was nothing
new In the situation. Diplomatic ques
tions, he said, generally should be left
tn the administration and not handled
by congress. From what is publicly
known about the situation, Mr. Dlng
ley said he would Infer that no radical
action la to be taken at this time by
thla country. He added, however, that
there might be important developments
and conditions of which the publlo is
uninformed. .

Senator Shoup'e Opinion.
Washington, Dec. 7. Senator Shoup
of Idaho, who reached the city Satur
day, expressed the opinion that the
passage of the Dlngley revenue bill at
the short session of congress was im
probable, believing the conditions in the
senate to be the same as when the mo
tion was made to take up the bill for
consideration. The senator thinks
therefore that an extra session is likely,
although that will have to be deter
mined by the Republicans when they
get together in conference.

MURDER OF MRS. GEDDES.
Probability That It Wa Not Her Huaband
Who Killed Her.
Bloom lngton, Ills., Dec. 7. The the
ory that Mrs. Fred Geddes, who was
found strangled to death and hanging
to a door of her home in Ford county
few mornings ago, was killed, not
by her husband, but by a stranger, is
gaining ground. The murder occurred
Just across the line, not far from Anch
or, McLean county. Geddes is an ig
norant German fram hand, who has
enjoyed a good reputation. The little
daughter of Geddes, aged 5 years, told
that her father killed her mother and
Geddes denied the crime. The woman
was killed before daybreak, and It Is
believed that the child could not have
distinguished between her father and
any other man, and Geddes said that
he had gotten up and gone to the field
before daybreak. Children of a neigh
bor now say that a strange man ran
from the Geddes house Just after day
light. This theory accounts for the
action of Geddes in insisting, when told
of his wife's death, that a Joke was be
ing perpetrated on him.
FIFTY PASSENGERS HURT.
Cable Car Collision on a Steep Incline at
New York.
New Y.Mk. Dec. 7. Duffy's hill,

Peter L. Meyer, carpenter; Mrs. Mary
Ormond, Agnes Ormond, Mrs. Ruth
Rosenthal.
Although none of the Injured went to
the hospital, all were in need of medi
cal attention. The wreck was caused
by the failure of the brakes to hold.
A runaway car collided half way down
the hill with a car containing nearly
fifty passengers. All tne passengers
were more or less injured. Some were
bruised by the force of the impact, oth
ers were cut by falling glass, and oth
ers, especially women, suffered from
shock. Those who could hastened to

from General Antonio Maceo for a
large supply of arms 'and munitions

LETTER FROM
GEN. GARCIA.
Inaurgent Leader Telia of Ilia
Meeting
with Gomes.
New York. Dec. 7. Cuban Delegate
Palma has received a letter, dated Nov.
8, from General Callxto Garcia. After
Garcia had left Guaimaro a heap of
ruins, the letter said, the march was
resumed toward Puerto Principe. The
forces of Garcia and Gomez met about
twelve miles from there, at La Gloria
village. In the presence of both armies
Gomez shook Garcla's hand and con
gratulated him on his glorious victory.
Thirty-one prisoners taken by the Cu
bans were delivered under a flag of
truce to a Spanish column at, El Faro.
The Spaniards apparently had neither
ambulances or litters. When they re
treated from Guaimaro all the wounded
were tumbled into six small Jolting
carts and driven hurriedly off the field
before their wounds were dressed. Gen
eral Garcla's letter confirmed the news
of the death of Major Winchester D,
Osgood, who gained athletic fame as
the half-back of the Cornell football
team and later of that of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania.

LOST A BIG SUM.
Mra. rani Freeee Drop. ,O0O on One of
Chlcago'a Crowded Streets.
Chicago, Dec. 7. Mrs. Paul Freese,
aged 60, of 4739 South Halsted street,
lost $2,000 Friday noon while en route
from the First National bank to the
bank of Greenebaum & Sons, at 83 and
85 Dearborn street. The money was In
greenbacks and was tied up in a com
mon handkerchief. Before entering the
door of the Greenebaum bank she
missed the handkerchief and realized
that the money had been lost.
Whether Mrs. Freese lost the money
or was made the victim of pickpockets
she is unable to say, but slightly enter
tains the former theory. There was
$4,000 in the original package, but she
divided it Into two parts, one of which
she put Into a pocket in her underskirt
and the other she lost. The money was
to be used in raising a mortgage on the
family home, Mr. Freese being a per
manent invalid. Central station de
tecUves were notified, but have little
hope of recovering the money.

FIGHT TO BE REOPENED.
Revival of Pension Troubles at the lows
Soldiers' Home.
Marshalltown, la., Dec. 7. Reports
reached here Friday from Washington
and Des Moines relative to a revival
of the pension troubles at the Iowa sol
diers' home. ,A Des Moines paper Fri
day morning asserted that United
States District Attorney Fullen was
preparing to cause the arrest, on in
formation lodged before Commissioner
Mason, of Commandant Ratekin and
all the members of the board of trus
tees of the soldiers' home on charges
of violating sections 4745 and 4747 of
the revised statutes of the United
States, in retaining excess pensions of
Inmates over $5 a month. A number
of the inmates of the home brought
suit about a year ago against the offi
cials of the institution for retaining
part of their pension money and con
verting It into the contingent or sup
port fund. Judge lilndman sustained
them. The case was carried up to the
supreme court, and the ruling of the
lower court was reversed. Friday's de
velopments indicate that the fight Is to
be reopened.
Commandant Retekln said he knew
nothing of any probable proceedings.
and was not worrying over the matter
at all. He merely enforced a rule adopt
ed nearly two years ago by the board
of commissioners retaining the excess
of pensions over $5 monthly and send
ing it to dependent relatives in cases
where there are such. Otherwise it is
turned into the general support fund.
All applicants for admission have this
rule impressed upon them before ad
mission and agree to abide by it. He t
is of the opinion that no action can He
under existing conditions. Commis
sioner Birchard refused to. say any
thing until he could confer with other
members. A special meeting of the
board probably will be called at once
to confer upon the matter.
SITUATION AT CHIPPEWA FALLS.
No Immediate Prospects of the Water
Leaving Entirely.
Chippewa Falls, Wis., Dec. 7. The
water receded thirty-seven inches Fri
day, but it rose eleven inches Friday
night, and is now stationary. There
seems to be no immediate prospect of
the water leaving the city entirely;
neither is it expected that it will again
attain Its height of two days ago. Fri
day some of the merchants began mov
ing into the abandoned buildings, but
work was not continued Saturday on
account of the condition of the river.
No risks will be assumed by the busi
ness men, who perfer to remain where
they, are, rather than expose their ef
fects to the flood. All feeling that great
destruction to property will cease at
once has pafcsed away, and things are
fast assuming their normal condition
here. Anchor ice is still coming down
the river, but in greatly reduced Quan
tities, and the gorge la not assuming
much larger proportions.' Th6 Central
road has2j'c;'. enaVVd to use Its tracks,
for a fef hours, but had to abandon
them Saturday morning on account of
the rise during the night. Its depot is
badly wrecked and will not be fit for

his quarters In a boxcar.
