THE V. M. C. A. MOVEMENT—THE
SPLENDID GIFT OF MR. GEO.
W. ALBAUGH.
The effort to establish, upon a sure
foundation, a Young Men’s Christian
Association in Westminster, deserves
the hearty sympathy and support of
all our citizens. The temptations and
the solicitations to evil, which sur
round the young men in almost every
community, make fathers and moth
ers and all thoughtful citizens anx
ious for their safety.
No agency which has been organ
ized as an auxiliary of the Christian
church compares in its efficiency, in
this regard, with the Young Men’s
Christian Association. It is carrying
on its work in all the important cities
of the world, and in most of the larg
er towns, and the good which it has
accomplished is immeasurable. It is
not, in any sense, sectarian, but upon
the contrary, has the endorsement
and help of all denominations.
It aims to throw around young men
the most attractive and helpful in
fluences, and to give them the oppor
tunity for such development of char
acter as is possible to them. The as
sociations are fitted up. in their
quarters, with gymnasiums, reading
rooms, ruble study crass rooms, as
sembly halls and every other attrac
tion for young men, and under the
best conditions. A man trained In
this kind of work is in charge, and in
him young men find a smypathetic
helper and friend.
Some of our citizens have, for a
long time, desired the establishment
of such an association in our town,
and it has now reached the point that
our citizens generally share this de
sire. We are glad to know, as it was
reported at the mass meeting on Mon
day night last, that this important
work is made possible through the
splendid gift of our fellow-townsman,
Mr. George W. Albaugh, who has gen
erously given to the association the
“Montour House,” a commodious
building, well located in our city, and
which can. with certain changes, be 1
made to suit the purposes of the as
sociation. There is no building in ,
town that can be more easily adapted
to the purposes for which this build
ing is to be used than the “Montour
House.” Mr. Albaugh deserves, as he
is receiving, the hearty thanks of our
people.
It is necessary to raise money to
make the needed changes in the build- ;
ing and a committee has been appoint
ed to solicit subscriptions.
Wo commend the efforts of the com
mittee to those who are desirous of
helping a good work.
THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
The National Congress convened on
Monday last, and President Roosevelt, '
I
or. the following day, sent in his mes- <
s; ge. Like all his messages, it is '
a voluminous document, and contains '
many passages that are distinctively <
Rooseveltian. |
He discusses a great many ques- 1
tions, hut deals with them in the
spirit of criticism rather than that
of statesmanship recommendation.
He scores the judiciary in away that
would astonish the earlier and more
conservative Presidents, if they were
still with us.
The whole tenor of the message
is for increased federal power. Some
of his suggestions will be regarded as
extremely radical. For example, he
says, in speaking of the railroads,
“the Interstate Commerce Commission
should exercise complete supervision
and central over the issue of secur
ities, as well as over the lowering and
raising of rates” and thtt this power
should be summary, and then adds
“that the power should be judicial and
not executive.” The railroads and
business men of the country will re
gard this as a most radical utterance.
But as Mr. Roosevelt is generally re
garded a rather meaningless agita
tor. it is not likely to have much
weight with Congress.
Mr. Roosevelt’s administration will
close in March next and the country
will breathe easier. He has done
more to stir the country, and less to
quiet affairs, than any one who has
preceded him. He has preached and
subjects, but his administration will
close, without a single thing tl.: t will
distinguish him as a statesman.
He has dabbled into everything, from
“how to raise a baby” to “how to
build a battleship," until it is so that
the country will feel a deep sense of
relief when by constitutional limit he
will be retired from the Presidency.
Long is the list of waifs who have
become famous. It includes Sir Henry
M. Stanley, Queen Catherine the Good,
Alexander Hamilton, Rosa Bonheur,
Edgar Allan Poe, Rachel, Leonardo da
Vinci, and dates back as far as Moses.
All these were homeless children.
