.i...n.-iiviit hatvosts,
You will not be surprised to learn, that
jo the peculiar exigencies of tbe times,
our intercourse witii foreign nations has
been attended with prolound iolicituce,
tbiefly turning uron our own domestio
flnirs. A disloyul portion of the Ameri
ca people have, during the whole year,
teen engaged in an attempt to divide and
destroy the Union.
A nation which endures factious do
mestic division is exposod to disrespect
broaJ,and one party, if Dot both, is sure
tooner or later, to invoke foreign inter
vention. Nations thus tempted to inter
fere are not always able to resist the coun
ts of seeming expediency and ungener
ous ambition, although lueasutcs adopted
unJer such influences seldom lull to be
unfortunate, and Injurious to those adop
ting thorn.
The disloyal citizens r.f the United
States who hnvo ottered the ruin of our
country in return for the aid and comfort
tihich they have invoked abroad, have
received less pationage and encourage
ment than they probubly expected. If u
irerejust to suppose, as the insurgents
have seemed to assume, that foreign na
tions, in this cuse, discarding all moral,
toc'aland treaty obligations, would act
jolely and selfishly for the most speedy
restoration of commerce including espec
ily the acquisition of cotton, these na
tions appear as yet not to have seen their
way to their object more directly or clear
ly through the destruction, than through
uV preservation of the Union.
If ne could dure to believe that foreign
nations uro actuated by no higher princi
ple than this, I am quite sure a sound ar
gument could be made to show them that
tliey can reach their aim more readily
and easily by aiding to crush this rebel
lion than by giving encouragement to n.
The principal lever relied on by the in
nirgcntsfor exciting foreign nations to
jiMtility ngainst us, as already intimated,
is the e'mburrassniint of commerce. These
nations, howover, not improbably saw
from the first that it was the Union which
niale as well our foreign as our domestic
commerce, f hey can scarcely have failed
to nercrivo that the ?!rnrt for disunion
produces the existing ditticuli.V, an'1 that
e tiong nation promises more clnrno.e
jwsoe and a more extensive and reliable
wmnierce, than can the tame nation bro
ken into hostile fragments. It is not my
Impose to -review our discussions with
foreign States, because whatever might be
(Vir wishes, or dispositions, the integrity
of our country and tho stability ( our
Government mainly depend not upon'
iJiem, butsun the loyalty, virtue, patriot
ism and intelligence ot tu American peo
ple.
The correspondence usen wun tu us
ual reservations is herewith submitted.
I venture to hope it will appear that we
have practised prudence and liberality to
wards foreign powers, averting causes of
irritation and with firmness maintaining
our own rghts and honor. Sinco, howev
er, it is apparent that here, as in every
other State, foreign dangers necessarily
attend domestic difficulties. I recom
mend tbut adequate and ample measures
lie adopted for maintaining the public de
fences on every side.
While undr this general recommenda
tion provision for defending our seacoait
line occurs to the mind.

ttention of Congress to our great hikes

tifications and depots of arms and muni

pon these, would bo cf great importance
ti the national defence and preservation.
I ask Attention to tho views of the Sec
retary of War expressed in his report up
on the same eeneral subieut. I deem it
ofimporiance that the loyal regions of
iennessee anu western .orm mu

ent act not founded in strict ritdit n sane
tioned by public law, I recommend that
predecessor, in his annuul message to
Congress in December last, in regard to
the deposition of the surplus which will
probubly romain after satisfying the
claims of American citizens against China,
pursuant to the awards of the Commis.
sioners under the act ot the 3d of March
1859.
If, however, it should not be deemed
advisable to carry that lecommcndulion
intoeffect, 1 would suggest that authority
e given investing the priiicipnl over the
proceeds of the surplus referred to in good
securities, with a view to the satisfaction
of such other just claims of our citizens
against China as are not unlikely to arise
hereafter in the course of our -extensive
trade with that empire.
By the act of the 5th of August last,
Congress authorized the President to in
struct theCo-.nmundcrs of suital le vessels
to defend themsolvcs against and cap
ture pirate. This authority has been ex
ercised in a single instance only. For the
more effectual protection of our extensive
pud valuable commerce in the Eastern
seas, especially, it seems to me that it
would also be advisable to authorize the
commanders of sailing vessels to recapture
any prizes which pirates may make of
United States vessels and their cargoes,
and the Cor. :ular Courts now established
by law in Eastern countries to abjudicate
the cases, in the event that this should
not be objected to by the local authori
ties. If any good reason exists why we
should persevere longer in withholding
our recognition of the independennn and
sovereignty of Hay ti, I am unable to dis.
cover it.
Unwilling, howover, to inaugurate a
rovel policy in regard to them without
the approbation of Congress, I submit for
your consideration the expediency of an
appropriation for maintaining a charge
d'affaires netr oath of those new States;
it does not admit of a dou lit that impor
tant commercial advantages might be se
cured by favorable treaties with them.
The operations of the treasury during
tho period which has elapsed since your
adjournment, have been conducted with
signal success. The patriotism of the peo
ple has placed at the disposal of the Gov..
eminent, tne lurge means demanded tiy
the public exigencies. Much of the Na
tion"..! Loan has been taken by citizens of
tha industrial :laes, whoso confidence
in their country's faith and zeal, for their
country's deliverance from present peril
have induced them to contribute to the
support of the Government the whole of
their limited acquisitions. This fact im
poses peculiar obligations upon us to econ
omy in disbursement and etnrgy in ac
tion. The revenues from all sources, inclu-
JJing loaasfor the financial year ending

leaving a balance in the Treasury, on the

quarter of the financial year, ending oti
the JiOih of September, I8CI, the receipts
from all sources, including the balance ol

the expanses ?'.8,239.734 W ; leaving a
balance on the 1st of October, 18(31, of
$1,292,77018.
Estimates for the remaining three quar
ters of the year, and for tho financial year
ot 1803, together with his vie of ways
and mean for meeting the demands con
templated by them, will bo submitted to
Congress by the Secretary of the Treas
ury. It is gratifying to know that the expen
ditures made nocessar) by the rebellion
are not beyond the resources of the loyal
people, and to believe that the same pat
riotism which has thus far sustained the
Government will continue to sustain it
till peace and uniuii shall again bless tho
land.
I respectfully refer to the report of the
Secretary of War for information respect
ing the numerical strength of the army
and fur recommendations, having in view
ui: increase of its ollioiency and the well

The report of the Secretary of the Navy
presents in detail the operations ot that
branch of the service, the activity and en
ergy which have characterized its admin
istration, and tbo results of tho measures
to iuereute its i lliciency and power. Such
have been the additions by construction
and purchase that it may almost be said a
navy has been created and brought into
set vice since our difficulties commenced
Besides blockading our extensive coast,
squadrons larger than ever before assem
bled under our flag, have been put afloat,
and pericrtued deeds which have increas
ed our naval renown.
I would invite special attention to the
recommendutious of ho Secretary for a
more perfect organization of tho Navy, by
introducing additional guides in the ser
vice. The present organization is defective
and unsatisfactory, and the sugga:tions
submitted by the Department, will, it is
believed, if adopted, obviate the difficul
ties alluded (o, promote harmony, nnd
increase the efficiency of tho Navy.
There are three vacancies on tho bench
of the Supreme Court ; two by the decease
of Justices Daniel utid McLean, nnd one
by the resignation of Justice Campbell. I
liavnsofur forborr.e making humiliations
to till these vacancies for reasons whijh l
will now state: Two of the out-going
Judges resided within tho States now
ovenun by levolt, so that if their succes

they could not now servo upon their cir

men there probably would not tako the ' justment of claims against the Govern-

of those Slates, the practical evil becomes
more apparent.
There a. e no courts nor officers to whom
the citiiens of other Slates m.iy apply for
the enforcement of their lawful claims
against ,'cilizens of the insurgent States,
and Ihero is a vast amount of debt consii- '
luting such claims. Some hive estimated j

from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal
citizens, who are even now making great (
sacrifices in the discharge of their patriot

der,hS3 feircumstancei I have been ur
gently solicited to establish, by military
power, courts to administer summary jus
tice in 6uc:h cases. I have thus far declin
ed to do it ; not because I had any doubt
that the end proposed tho collection of
the debts was just nnd right in .itself, but
because I have beon unwilling to go be
yond the pressure of necessity in the un
usual exercise of power. Kul the powe's
of Congress, I suppose, are equal to tho
anomalous occasion, nnd therefore I reler
the whole matter to Congress, with the
hope that a plan may be devised for the
administration of justice in all such parts
of the insurgent Slates and Territories ( s
may bo under the control of this Govern
ment, whether by a voluntary return to
allegiance, and order, or by the power of
our arms.
This, however, is not to ba a permanent
institution, but a temporary substitute,
and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts

The receipts of tho rtent Office have

rendering a largo reduction of tho force

The demands upon the Pension Office
will be largely increased by the insmrec
tion. Numerous applications for pensions,
based upon tho casualties of the present
war, have already been made. There is
reason to believe that many who aro now
upon the pension rolls, nnd in receipt of
the bounty of tho Government, nre in the
runks of tte insurgent army, or giving
them aid and comfoit. The Secretary of
the Interior has directed a suspension of
tho payment of the pensions of such per
sons upon prooi oi ino:r uisioyauy.
I recommend that Congress authorise
that officer to causo the uames of such
TERMS

persons to be stricken from the pension
rolls.
The relations of the Government with
the Indian tribct have been greatly dis
turbed by the irsurrection, especially in
Southern Superintendeiicy and in that of
New Mexico. The Indian country south
of Kaiuas is in the possession of insur-.
gems from Texas .and Arkansas.
Tne agents nl the. United Stales Gov
ernment, appointed since iho 4th March
for this supeiintendency.have been unable
to reach their pests, while most of those
who were in Die office before t hut time,
have espoused the insurrectionary causo,
and assume toexercise the powers of agents
by vutuo of commissions from the insur
rectionists. It has boon stated in the public press
thata portion of these Indians have been
organized ns a military force, nnd are at
tached lo the army of the insurgents.
Althongh the Government hits no official
information upon this subject, letters have
been written to tho Comm'r of Indian
Atlitira by several prominent Chiefs, giv
ing assurance of their loyalty to tbo Uni
ted Slates, and expressing a wish for tho
pi eseiice of Federal troops to protect them,
it is believed that upon the repossession
of the countiy by the Federal fences, the
Indians will readily cease all hostile dem
onstrations und resume their former rela
tions to the government.

Congress to consider whether something
more cannot bo given voluntarily with

hibking the condition of our agriculture,

The execution of the laws for the sup
pression of tho African slave trade has
been confided to the Department of the
Interior. It is a mbject ot gratulation
that the efforts which have been imtdo for
l!ie su pression of this inhuman trafic
have been recently attsrulej with unusual
success, rive vessels peine Ii ilea out lor
the slavo trade have been seized and ccn
denined ; two mates of vessels engaged in
ttic nadir, nml ono (icvoii in equipping a

sul jeeled to the penulty of fine and im-
pnsonment; and oim captain, taken with

been convicted of the highest grade of of

which is death.
The Territories of Colorado, D.tkoti.h
and Nevada, created by the last Congress,
have been organized and civil administra
tion has been inaugurated therein under
auspices especially gratifying, when it is
considered that the leaven of treason was
found existing in some of these new coun
tries when the Federal oflicers arrived
there.
The abundant natural rcsaurces of these
territories, with tint security and protec
tion allorded by orgtnized governments,
will doubtless invito to them n largo im
migration, when peace shall restore the
lusiness of the country to its accustomed
channels.
1 submit the resolutions of the Legisla
ture of Colorado, which etidonce thn pat
riotic spirit of the people cf t bat Territory.
So far tho authority of tbe United States
has bier, uphold in nil tho Territories, as
it is hoped it will be in tho future. I
commend their interests and defence, to
the enlightened and generous care of Con
gress. I recommend lo tho favorable consider
ntion of Congress tho interests of the Dis
trict of 'Columbia. Tho insurrection has
been tho cause of much stillering ami sac
lilice to its inhabitants, an J ns they have
no representative in Congress, that body
should not overlook their just claim upon
tho governinuitt.
At your late session a joint resolution
was adopted authorizing the President to
take measures for facilitating a proper rep

I regret to snv I have been unable lo
give personal attention to this subject a
subject ut or.ce so inteicsling in iHolf and
so extensively nnd intimately connected
with the materiiil prosperity of the world.
Through tho Secret iries of Stale nnd ol
the Interior, n plan or system has been
devised, and partly m.ituro I, and which
will be hud before you.

Beside this, it is not impossible that
some of the Stalps will pass similar enact
ments for tl.eir own benefit respectively,
nnd by operation of which, per-ons of the
same class will be thrown upon them for
dpoal. I.i such case, I rncommend that
Congress provide for accepting such per

mode of valuation, in lieu pro Unto of di
rect taxes ; or upon some other plan to be
agreed on, with such Stales respectively ;
thiil such persons, on sikIi accept a nco by

er tho frco colored people already in the
LTnited States could not, so far as indiviiU
u tils may desire, be included in (.uuh col
onization. To carry out the plan of colonization
may involve the acquiring of territory and
und also the appropriation of niotty be
yond that lo be expended in the lerrito
riul acquicition. Uaving practised tho
acquisition of territory lor nearly sixty
years, tho question cflho Constitutional
power to do so is no longer an open ono
with us. The power was questioned ut
first by Mr. Jefferson, who, howevc, in
the purchase of Louisiana, yielded his
eciuples on the plea of great expediency.
If it be said that tho only legitimate ob
ject of acquiring territory is lo furnish
homes for while men, this measure effects
that object, for emigration of colored men
leaves additional room for white men re-'
mniiiing or coming here. Mr. Jeffersou,
however, placed the importance of pro
curing Louisiana more on political and
commercial grounds, tlnn on providing
room for population.
On this whole proposition, including
tho appropriation of money, with the ac
quisition of territory, does not tho expe
diency amount toubsolute necessity with
out which the Government itself cannot
be perpetuated if tho .var continues.
In considering the policy to be adoptod
for suppressing the insurrection, I have
been anxious und careful that the inevita
ble conflict for this purpose shall not de
generate into a violent and reniorsoless
revolutionary struggle. I have, therefore,
in every case, thought it proper to keep
the integrity of the Union prominent as
tho primary object of the contest on our
part, leaving all questions which are not
of vitul military importance, to the moro
deliberate action of tho legislature.
In the exercis of my best discretion I
have tdhered to tha blockade of the ports
held by the insurgents, instead of putting
in foico by proclamation the law of Con
gress cn.tcted at the lato ses-sion for clo.s..
ing these ports. So ulso, obeying tho die
lutes of prudencn ns well ns the obligations
of law, instead of transcending I have ad
hered to tho act of Congress to confiscate
property used for insurrectionary purpos.

shall bo proposed, its propriety will ba
duly considered.
The Union must bo preserved, and
hence all indisponsablo means must ba
employed. We shall not be in hasto ta de
termine that radical and extreme measure,
which may roach the loyal as well as the
disloyal, are inf ispensuble.
The inaugural address at tho beginning
nf the Administration and the message to
Congress at the late special session, were
both mainly devote'! to the domestic con
troversy out. of which the insurrection
nnd consequent war have sprung.
Nothing more occurs tl add or subtract
to or from the principles or general pur
poses stated and expressed in that docu
ment. The last ray of hnpo for preserve
ing the Union, peaceably, expired at the
assault upon Fort Sumter, nnd a general
review of wrut has occurred since may
not be unprofitable.
What was painfully uncertain then, is
much better defined and more distinct
now, nnd the progress of events is plainly
in the tight, direction. The insurgents
confidently claimed a strong support from
North of Mason and Dixon's line, and the
friends of the Union were not free from
apprehension on that point. This, how
ever, was soon settled definitely, and on
the right side.
South of the lino, noble little Delaware
led oir right from tho first. Maryland was
matlo to seem against the Union. Our
sihlier.t were assaulted, bridge woro burn
ed, nnd railroad-! torn up within bur lim
its, and we wore many days, ut one tiuiu,
without the ability to bring a single regi
ment over her soil to tho defence of tho
Capital.
Now her bridges and Railroads nro re
paired und open to the Government. She
already gites seven regiments to tho causo
of the Union, and none to thoene.iiy, and
her people at a regular election have sus
tained the Union by u large majority, and
a larger aggregate vote than they ever bo1
fori! gave to any candidate on any ques
tion. Kentucky, foo, for some timo in doubt
is now decidedly, ami, I think, u.ie.h.mg
tbly on tho side of the Union. Missouri
is comparatively quiet, and 1 bolievo can
not bo overrun by the insurrectionists.
These threo Stales of Maryland, Ketituoky
and Missouri neither of which would
promise a single soldier, at first, have now
an aggregate of not loss than forty thous
