Washington. Thesa facts and
figures on the growth of the Uni
tod States navy since tho entry of
f this nation in the world war
were made public for the firr.t. time
in the annual report of Secretary
of the Navy Daniels:
January 1, 1917, there were: 300
naval vessel (nil kinds) 4,500 offi
cers, 08,000 enlisted men, 130 naval
stations, 35,000 navy yard em
ployes. Now thore are: "Many
more than 1,000," l',,n00 officers,
254,000 enlisted men, 63 naval
stations, over 60,000 navy yard
employes.
"On tiliora and afloat, including
civilians and sailors, the naval es
tablishment embraces more than
300,000," Secretary Daniels said.
"And further expansions are in
evitable." At the beginning of the fiscal
year 1017 monthly expenditures
for all naval purposes were about
$3,000,000; they now are about
$00,000,000.
Washington, D. C. "We are ready
now. This, Secretary Daniels in his
annual report, made public, asserts U
tho American navy's war slogan. The
slogan Is the reply of the young oHh-or
commanding the first American flotilla
of, destroyers to enter the war zone 1
after the United States declared wur
against Germany, made to the Biltl.th
Admiral's query as to when the Amer
ican ships would be ready for service.
. '"That was not language of boast

the . incident.' "It was the prophecy

"While I may .not speak in detail of
the greater naval operations, it may be
stated that the -record Is one of in
creasing power, of developing re
sourcefulness and of co-operative
achievement which the American peo
ple may well survey with national
Pridft While the details of what wo
have done and how we have done It
must wait until it is permissible to
spread them upon public record, this
summary may be given to our peo
ple; . "In tho navy we have prepared for

. The Woodshed,
I saw a sturdy farmer go out
after wood in drifting snow. I
watched him scratoh and paw
about to get each log and sapling
out; with ice they were all coated
o'er; it made his fingers stiff and
sore; the cold snow sifted down
his neck it seemed to him it was
a peck. He swung Jiis axe with
might and main and muttered
over this refrain: "That man
lacks something in his head who
does not have a good woodshed."
I saw a farmer's wife, one day
vhen it was raining right away,
chase out in all that slop and wet
a load of wet stovewood to get.
She took it in her skirts were '
soaked; she put it on it sobbed
and smoked until the bread and
pies were spoiled and all her din
ner plans were foiled. She look
ed in anger at the bread, and
then sat down and cried and sail I
"No man who loves his wife at
all will haul in wood, fall after
fall, and and pile it outside in the
yaid. To tote in wood at all is
hard; to pack it in through rain
and slosh would make an angel
cry, by gosh. I'll make John
wish that he was dead, unless he
builds a good woodshed."
One frosty morn I saw a lad,
tears in his eyes and fighting;
mad, pick up the frosted sticks
and chips, and heard strange
sounds come from his lips: "I'd
rather be a boy, I would, than be
a man and be no good, and any
man that can not build a wood
shed's not fit to be killed. Now
there's my pa I" just be blam
ed if he don't make me plum
ashamed!"
To see the moral of this
the reader surely cannot 'fail; " ''-'J '
your own disgust, ' your good ; " '
wife's ire, your boy's Ron tempt-r'
thesfr are-theiiii r y bii caifl whwf
you neglect to build a woodshed," ' .
and to keep it filled. -Southern

Do You Get the Good Out of Your
Farm Paper?
The farmer who does not take
and read and make usetul to him
in his work one or more good
farm papers is not getting what
he should out of his farm.
The farmer who doe9 not take
at least one farm paper, who im
agines that he can save money by
doing without, is not saving mon
ey, but wasting it. Only a man
who cannot read can fail, if he
tries, to get more than its cost
out of any good farm paper.
The man who takes farm pa
pers, but "hasn't time to read
them," as farmers sometimes
say they have not, is a man who
has not learned how to use his
time to the best advantage. No
hours pay better than the hours
devoted to acquiring useful infor
mation.
The man who reads his papers
and does not find in them practi
cal help with the jobs he has to
do on his farm, either has the
wrong sort of papers or does mt
go at them in the right way. It
is all right to read for entertain
ment or amusement, but when a
man reads his farm paper he
should read for the purpose of
learning what he needs to knpw
about his work. Then, if he does
not find that information, he
should write nnd ask for it. '
