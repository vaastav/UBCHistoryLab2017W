"A STRANGER IN A STRANGE
LAND."
The play at Poli's this evening, "A
Stranger in a Strange Land," is a taree
, that ought to provide an evening of
rare enjoyment. In New York, wnere
it had a long and successful run at the
Manhattan theater, it won the favor of
press . and public, and proved itself a
very funny and enjoyable pertorin
ance. ' William A. Brady and Joseph
R. Grlsmer, who have sent us so many
other fine plays, in pending the farce
on tour have equipped it with the same
scenery, company and stage appoint
ments used in the New York produc
tion, and hence those who go to Poli's
this evening may expect to enjoy a
very amusing and artistic performance.
:devil's auction."
Charles H. Yale's magnificent spec
tacle which is known as. "Forever
Devil's Auction," has always been an
extremely popular attraction in Wa
terbury, and when it is presented at
Poli's on Thursday evening this great
noDularitv will undoubtedly be one
again in evidence. For eighteen years
now this great spectacle has been be
fore the American public, always hold
ing eminent public favor because al
ways attractive, picturesque and inter
esting. This season again it is brought
out In a new dress, scenery, mechan
ism, tricks and all else being of a new
and original design. The woes of
"Toby" and his associates are as comic
as ever, and the man or woman who
can't enjoy an eveninsr of mirth and
Jollity in witnessing "Forever Devil's
Auction" is yet to be unearthed. Seats
go on sale to-morrow.
WOMEN'S STRING ORCHESTRA.
The concert at Poli's theatre last
evening under the auspices of tne
Friendly league, was attended by a
large and fashionable audience. "Tl.e
playing of the several selections by the
Women's String orchestra of' New
York was most pleasing and rapturous
applause followed each number. Es
pecially pleasing was the violincel'o
solo by Miss Frl Gaertner. The young
lady handles this pleasing instrument
in a manner which stamps her as an
artist of the first class. She respond
ed to the encore, which was the only
encore recognized by a second num
ber by the members of the orchestra.
The Italian selection "Pizzicato." was
also a pleasing number. The singing
of Miss Lilla C. Wigmore was never
heard to better advantage. An enthus
iastic encore was given her for both
numbers on the program, to which ?be
responded with two very pretty seioc
tions- Miss Kimball accompanied Miss
Wigmore' s singinc, oil the piano, n
her best style. Miss Teeming, formerly
of Litchfield, presided at the nno dur
ing the rendition of one of he selec
tions.. . The concert as a whole wa
most pleasinar and the Friendly lea true
deserves credit for giving -ne people
of-Waterbury a chance to hear tbe
celebrated musicians composing H.e
""""i's orc,,"!''"M. No rt---'-t n crno'1

on the work mapped out bv the leagje
officers fcr the coming winter.
WILBUR-KIRWIN OPERA CO.
That comic opera is popular in Wa
terbury was amply proven at the
Jacques last night, and of the many
opera companies on The road there is.
perhaps, none so popular with Water
bury show-goers as the Wilbur-Kirwln
opera company. There are the same
old favorites who delighted us year?
ago and some new ones of merit adi
ed. . The piece last night was "The
Pirates of Morocco," an old opera un
der a new name. Miss Kirwin is a
popular as ever and played the dual
role to perfection. Miss Margaret
Baxter is a new member of the com
pany, but bids fair to attain pro
nounced success. J. C. Harvey per
formed some of the best work we have
seen here in'some time. In comic opri
tl.e comedian's part is one of vital im
portance in the construction of the
piece. Mr Wilbur is fortunate in hav
ing the services of such a versatile and
complete an actor as Mr Baxter. Hr
olfl Gordon, the leading tenor of the
company, is hapnv in the possession o"
B. weet and flexible voice of force and
expression. Perhaps the most i'pa
insr of the soloists was E. A. Clark
xrbose excellent baritone voice . ha

IPRESirSBl.
The president,' in his annual message
to congress, .says: - - ,
"At the . threshold " of your delibera
tions you are called to mourn with youi
countrymen the death of t Vice President
Hobartwho passed 'from this life on tht
morning of Nov. 21 last. His great soul
now rests in eternal peace. His private
life was pure and elevated, while his pub
lic career-was ever distinguished by large
capacity, stainless integrity and exalted
motives. He has been removed from the
high office which he honored and digni
fied, bnt his lofty character, his devotion
to duty, his honesty of purpose and no
ble virtues remain with us as a priceless
legacy and example."
The president then plunges iuto a re
view of the prosperous conditions which
have prevailed throughout the country !
since his last message was delivered. He
finds that the exports of agricultural
products were 784,776.142 and of man- .
ufactnred products $339,502,14(3. larget !
than any previous year. Government re- 1
ceipts from all sources for the fiscal yeai
ended June 30, 1S99, aggregated nearly
$611,000,000. Customs receipts were
over 5206,000.000 and those from inter
nal revenue about 274.000,000. For the
same period the expenditures were $700,
093.564. leaving a deficit of a little ovei
89,000,000.
The secretary of the treasury estimates
that the receipts for the current fiscal
year will aggregate nearly $641,000,000
and the expenditures about $001,000,000.
Mr. McKinley then turns his atten
tion to the condition of the treasury,
which, he says, is most gratifying. The
available cash' balance on Dec. 1, 1899,
was $278,000,000, of which over $229,
000,000 was in gold coin and bullion, and
he remarks that the conditions of confi- i
dence which prevail throughout the coun- '
try have brought gold into more general
use, and customs receipts are now al
most entirely paid in that coin.
THE BOND OFFER.
The recent action of the secretary ot
the treasury in offering to purchase 25,
OoO.OOO of bonds is referred to in the fol
lowing term:
"The strong position of the treasury
with respect to cash on hand and the
favorable showing made by the revenues
have made it possible for the secretary
of the treasury to take action under the
provisions of section 3594. Revised Stat
utes, relating to the sinking fund. Re
ceipts exceeded expenditures for the
first five months of the current fiscal
year by $13,413,389.91, and, as mention
ed above, the secretary of the treasury
estimates that there will be a surplus
of approximately $40,000,000 at the end
of the year. Under such conditions it
was deemed advisable and proper to re
sume compliance with the provisions ot
the sinking fund law, which for eight
years has not been done because of de
ficiencies in the revenues. The amount
offered and purchased during November
was 18,408,000."
Mr. McKinley says the net saving in
interest on the amount purchased was
over 2,000,000.
The president finds that tmdar the rap
id development in the industries of the
country the national banking act is not a
sufficient avenue through which needful
addition to the circulation can from time
to time be made. He therefore asks con
gress to take up this matter with the
view of flscert."ii-l'nT whether or not such
reasonable modifications can be made as
will render the act's service in the par
ticulars referred to more responsive to
the people's needs. He urges that na
tional banks be authorized to organize
with a capital of $25,000.
THE MONEY STANDARD.
President McKinley then proceeds to
discuss the standard of money and says:
"I urgently recommend that to support
the existing gold standard and to main
tain the parity in value of the coins of
the two metals (gold and silver) and the
equal power of every dollar at all times
in the market and in the payment of
debts the secretary of the tr sury be
given additional power and charged with
the duty to sell United States bonds and
to employ such other effective means as
may be necessary to those ends. The au
thority should include the power to sell
bonds on long and short time, as condi
tions may require, and should provide for
a rate of interest lower than that fixed
by the act of Jan. 14, 1875. While there
is now no commercial fright which with
draws gold from the government, but, on
the contrary, such widespread confidence
that gold seeks the treasury demanding
paper money in exchange, yet the very
situation points to the present as the
most fitting time to make adequate provi
sion to insure the continuance of the gold
standard and of public confidence in the
ability and purpose of the government to
meet all its obligations in the money
which the civilized world recognizes as
the best.
"The financial transaction of the gov
ernment are conducted upon a gold ba
sis. We receive'gold wben we sell TJnit
ed States bonds and use gold for their
payment. We are maintaining the parity
of all the money issued or coined by au
thority of the government. We are doing
these things with the means at band.
Happily at the present time we are not
compelled to resort to loans to supply
gold. It has been done in the past, how
ever, and may have to be done in the fu
ture. It behooves us, therefore, to pro
vide at once the best means to meet the
emergency when it arises, and the best
means are those which are the most cer
tain and economical. Those now author
ized have the virtue neither of directness
nor economy. We have already eliminat
ed one ot the causes of our financial
plight and embarrassment during the
years 1803. 1S94, 1895 and 1896.
RECEIPTS EQUAL, EXPENDI
- . TUItES.
"Oar receipts now equal our expendi
tures. Deficient revenues no longer cre
ate slarm. Iet us remove the only re
maining cause by conferring the full and
necessary power on the secretary of the
treasury and impose upon him the duty
to uphold the present gold standard and
preserve the coins of the two metals on a
parity with each other, which is the re
peatedly declared policy of the United
States. In this connection I repeat my
former recommendations that a portion
of the-gold holdiues shall be placed in a
trust fund from which greenbacks shall
be red-emed upon presentation, but wben
once redeemed shall not thereafter be
paid out except for gold."
After an urgent appeal to congress to
pas some legislation which shall drt the
American merchant" marine from its
present state f decadence President
McKinley turna ttis attention to the aub-
ject of trusts and devotes a great deal oi
attention to it. He says r w ". : ' i. : . .;:
: -"Combinations ... of capital organize
into trusts to; cor-trol the conditions O)
trade among 'dnr citizens -to stifle com
petition, limit production and determini
the prices of products used and consum
ed by the people are justly provokiuj
public discussion and should early claim
the attention of congress.. The subjeci
is one that gives rise Lo diversified
views as to - the nature and variety oi
cause and extent of the injuries to.ths
public which may result from large com
binations concentrating more or less nu
merous enterprises and establishments
which previously to the formation of the
combination were carried on . separately
OBNOXIOUS COMBINATIONS.
"It is universally conceded that com
binations which engross or control the
market of any particular kind of mer
chandise or commodity necessary to th
guaeral -community, by suppressing nat
ural and ordinary competition, wherebj
prices are unduly enhanced to the gen
eral consumer, are obnoxious, not onlj
to the common law, but also to the pub
lic welfare. There must be a remedy fot
the evils involved in such organization
If the present law can be extended more
certainly to control or check these mo
uopolies or trusts, it should be done with
out delay. Whatever power the con
gress possesses over this most important
subject should be promptly ascertained
and asserted."
Following the trust question the presi
dent takes up foreign relations, first re
viewing the status of several disputes
which the government has on hand anc
finding tkem moving toward a success
ful settlement. He finds that the isth
mian canal commission is making good
progress in carrying on examinations ir
Nicaragua and Darien with a view tc
establishing a canal between the At
lantic and Pacific oceans, and he asks
congress to help in the work.
Referring to China, Mr. McKinley says
that the interests of our citizens in that
va-jt empire have not been neglected, and
adequate protection has been secured for
American missionaries there. Our trade
with China has continued to grow, and
our commercial rights under existing
treaties have been and will be maintain
ed. He again urges an appropriation for
a commission to study the commercial
and industrial conditions in the Chinese
empire so that American trade may be
enlarged in the empire.
OUR RELATIONS WITH GER
MANY. Next the Paris exposition is touched
on, and concerning Germany the presi
dent finds that our relations continue to
be most cordial. He says:
"In all that promises closer relations oi
intercourse and commerce and a bettet
understanding between two races hav
ing so many traits in common Germany
can be assured of the most cordial co
operation of this government and people.
We may be rivals in many material
paths, but our rivalry should be generous
and open, ever aiming toward the attain
ment of larger results and the mutually
beneficial advancement of each in the
line of its especial adaptabilities."
Mr. McKinley contends that our sys
tem of the inspection of food products
for export is of the best, and he hopes
that the German government will come
to realize this and suggests that congress
authorize an invitation to. Germany in
connection with the pending reciprocity
negotiations for the constitution oi a
joint commission of scientific experts and
practical men of affairs to conduct a
searching investigation of food produc
tion and exportation in both countries.
The president hopes that the disputed
question concerning the Alaskan-Canadian
boundary will soon be satisfactorily
settled.
THE TRANSVAAL WAR.
Touching on the war between Great
Britain and the Boers, the president
says:
"This government has attained an at
titude of neutrality iu the unfortunat
contest between Great Britain and the
Boer states of South Africa. We have
been faithful to the precept of avoiding
entangling alliances as to affairs not of
a direct concern. Had circumstances
suggested that the parties to the quarrel
would have welcomed any kindly expres
sion of the hope of the American peo
ple that war might be averted good of
fices would have been gladly tendered.
"The United States representative at
Pretoria was early instructed to see that
all neutral American interests be re
spected by the combatants. This has
been an easy task in view of the positive
de .'Iarations of both British and Boei
authorities that the personal and prop
erty rights of our citizens should be ob
served. "Upon the withdrawal of the British
agent from Pretoria the United States
consul was authorized,' upon the requesi
of the British government and with the
assent of the South African and Orange
Free State governments, to exercise the
customary good offices of a neutral foi
the care of the British interests. In the
discharge of this function I am happy to
say that abundant opportunity has been
afforded fo show the impartiality of this
government toward both the combat
ants." -'. v -.
Taking up the subject of the lynching
of certain Italians inr'Louisiana, Mr. Mc
Kinley follows - President Harrison in
urging that congress extend the powers
of the federal courts so that , they may
have jurisdiction over offenses against
th treaty rights of foreigners domiciled
in the United States
The president, after a complimentary
reference to the friendly feeling the gov
ernment of Japan has for the United
Stotes hopes that that country will soon
be brought into telegraphic relation with
this country and also calls attention tc
his special message- of Feb. 10, 1899,
comerning the necessity of a cable to
Manila, recommending that congress au
thorize the postmaster general to invite
competitive bids for the establishment of
such a cable.
President McKiiitey reviews at some
length the Samoan troubles and says
that he will soon submit to the senate a
convention entered into between the Unit
ed States, Germany and England for its
action. " ''-
, THE TREATY OF"; PEACE. '
The message continues: J ' : :
"My annual message of last year wai
necessarily devoted, in great part to s'
consideration of the Spanish war and o
the results it wrought and the condition!
it imposed for the future. I am gratified
to announce that the treaty of peace has
restored friendly relations between the
two powere. Effect has been given to iti
most important provision: The evacua
tion of Porto Rico having already been
accomplished on the 18th of October
1808k nothing remained necessary then
bv.t t continue the provisional military
con t ml of the island until the congress
should enact a suitable government foi
the ..ceded territory. Of the charaetei
and scope of . the measures to that end
I sha'A treat in another part of this mes
sage..; J
" "The withdrawal of the authority ol
Spain from the island of Cuba was ef
fected by the 1st of January, so that the
full re-establishment of peace found the
relinquished territory held by us in trust
for the inhabitants, maintaining, undei
the direction of the executive, such gov
ernment and control therein as should
conserve public order, restore the produc
tive conditions of peace so long disturbec
by the instability and disorder which pre
vailed for the greater part of the preced
ing three decades and build up that tran
quil development of the domestic slate
whereby alone can be realized the high
purpose,- as proclaimed in the joint reso
lution adopted by the cougress on the
19th of April, 1898, by which the United
States disclaimed any disposition or in
tention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdic
tioa or control over Cuba, exevpt for the
pacification thereof, and asserted its de
termination that when that was accom
plished to leave the government and con
trol of the island to its people. The
pledge contained in this resolution is ot
the highest honorable obligation and
must be sacredly kept.
"I believe that substantial progress
has been made in this direction. All the
administrative measures adopted iu Cu
ba have aimed to fit. it fur a regenerated
existence by enforcing the supremacy ot
law and justice by placing wherever
practicable the machinery of admin
istration in the hands of the inhabitants,
by instituting needed sanitury reforms
by spreading education, by fostering in
dustry and trade, by inculcating public
morality arid, in short, by taking every
rational step to aid the Cuban people to
attain to that place of self conscious re
spect aud self reliant unity which fits
an enlightened community for self gov
ernment within its own sphere, while en
abling it to fulfill all outward obliga
tions. AN OBLIGATION ASSUMED.
"This nation has assumed before the
world a grave responsibility for the fu
ture good government of Cuba. We have
accepted a trust the fulfillment of which
calls for the sternest integrity of pur
pose and the exercise of the highest wis
dom. The new Cuba yet to arise from
the ashes of the past must needs be
bound to us by ties of singular intimacy
and strength if its enduring welfare is tc
be assured. Whether those ties shall be
organic or conventional, the destinies ot
Cuba are in some rightful form and man
ner irrevocably linked with our own, but
how and how far is for the future to de
termine in the ripeness of events. What
ever be the outcome, we must see to i,
that free Cuba be a reality, not a name,
a perfect entity, not a hasty experiment
bearing within itself the elements of fail
ure. Our mission, to accomplish which
we took up the wage of battle, is hot
to be fulfilled by turning adrift any loose
ly framed commonwealth to face the
vicissitudes which too often uttend weak
er states whose natural wealth and
abundant resources are offset by the in
congruities of their political organiza
tion and the recurring occasions for in
ternal rivalries to sap their strength and
dissipate their energies. The greatest
blessing which can come to Cuba is the
restoration of her agricultural and in
Justrial prosperity, which will give em
ployment to idle men and re-establish
the pu. suits of peare. This is ner cuiet
and immediate need.
'On the 19th day of August last an or
der was made for the taking of the cen
sus in the island, to be completed on the
30th of November. By the treaty of
peace the Spanish people on tho island
have until April 11, 1900, to elect whether
they will remain citizens of Spain or be
come citizens of Cuba. Until then it can
not be definitely ascertained who shall be
entitled to participate in the formation of
the government of Cuba. By that time
the results of the census will have been
tabulated, and we shnlNproceed to pro
vide for elections which will commit the
municipal governments of the island to
the officers elected by the people. The
experience thus acquired will prove of
great value in the formation of a repre
sentative convention of the people to
draft a constitution and establish a gen
eral system of independent government
for the island. In the meantime, and so
long as- we exercise control over the is
land, the products of Cuba should have a
market in the United States on as good
terras and with as favorable rates ot
duty as are given to the West India is
lands under treaties of reciprocity which
shall be made.
AID TO THE DESTITUTE.
For the relief of the distressed in th.
island of Cuba the war department has
issued supplies to - destitute persons
through the officers of the army which
have amounted to 5,403,000 rations, at a
cost of $1,417,554.07.
"To promote the disarmament of the
Cuban volunteer army, and in the inter
est of public peace and the welfare of the
people, the sum of 75 was paid to each
Cuban soldier borne upon the authenti
cated rolls, on condition that he should de
posit his arms with the authorities desig
nated by the United States. The sum thus
disbursed aggregated $2,547,750, which
was paid from the emergency fund pro
vided by the act of Jan. 5, 1899, for that
purpose.
"Out of the Cuban island . revenues
auring the six months ending June 30,
1899, $1,712,014.20 was expended foi
sanitation, $293,881.70 for charities and
hospitals and 88,944.03 for aid to the
destitute.
"The international commission or arbi
tration appointed under the Anglo-Venezuelan
treaty of 1897 rendered an award
on Oct. 3" Inst whereby the boundary line
between Venezuela and British Guiana
is determined, thus ending a controversy
which had existed for the greater part of
the century. The award, as to which the
arbitrators were, unanimous, while not
meeting the extreme contention of eithei
party, gives to Groat Britain a large
share of the interior territory in dispute
and to Venezuela the entire mouth of the
Orinoco, including Barima point and the
Caribbean littoral for some distance to
the eastward. The decision appears tc
be equally satisfactory to both parties.
"Venezuela has once more undergone a
revolution. The insurgents under Gen
eral Castro, after a sanguinary engage
ment in whiejh they suffered much loss,
rallied in the mountainous interior and
advanced toward the capital. The bulk
of the army baring sided "with the move
ment, President - Andrade quitted Cara
cas, where General Castro set up a pro
visional government,' with which our min
Uter and the representative of othet
powers entei-od into diplomatic relations
oa the 20th of November, 1899." ;
ANOTHER IT BADE : CONFERENCE.
' Reviewing tlie increase of trade brought
about by the efforts of the state "depart
ment to keep iu touch -with the govern
ment of the Latin-American republics in
South and Central America, President
McKinley thinks , it expedient that the
various : republics should be invited to
hold at an early date another conference
in a capital of one of the countries other
than the TTuitcd States and in this con
nection refers to the Pan-American expo
sition to be hold on the Niagara frontier
in New York in the year 1901 and says,
"Satisfactory assurances have already
been given by the diplomatic representa
tives of Great Britain. Mexico, the
Central and South American republics
and most of the states of the United
States that these countries and states
will make ;t unique, interesting and in
structive exhibit peculiarly illustrative of
their material progress during the cen
tury which is about to close."
President McKinley expresses satisfac
tion over the outcome of the peace con
gress held at The Hague and hopes for
beneficial results from the permanent
tribunal for arbitration established by it.
He calls-attention to the fact'that in
signing the convention the representative
of the United States carefully guarded
the historic position of this country ancut
the Monroe doctrino.
PRAISE FOR THE ARMY.
In a brief reference to the number ot
men comprising the army of the United
States in this country and Manila the
president says:
"I cannot withhold from officers and
men the highest commendation for their
soldierly conduct in trying situations,
their willing sacrifices for their country
and the integrity and ability with which
they have performed unusual and diffi
cult duties in our island possessions.'
The message then goes into an extend
ed review of the postal service not only in
the United States, but the recently ac
quired colonies. It also calls the atten
tion of congress to the report of the sec
retary of the navy concerning armot
plate for vessels now under contract, and
building and asks that legislation be en
acted to make contracts early in the ycai
for armor of the best quality that can
be obtained in this country for the Maine.
Ohio and Missouri, and that the provision
of the act of March 3, 1S99. limiting the
price of armor to 300 per ton be re
moved. Concerning pensions the president finds
that the pension. roll on Jvme 30. 189.
numbered 901,519, and the number add
ed during the year was 40,999, the num
ber dropped being 43,193. The amount
disbursed for army and navy pensions
during the year was f 13S.355.052.95.
which was $l,i51,401.61 less than the
sum of the appropriation. He recom
mends that in order to make the prac
tice of the department at nil times uni
form and to do justice to the dependent
widows of officers and enlisted men who
served 90 days or more tlnring the wai
of the rebellion and were honorably dis
charged the amount of income allowed
independent of the proceeds of their
daily labor should be not less than $2."0
per annum. The present ruling allows
such widow only $96.
THE PHILIPPINE WAR.
President McKinley devotes ten type
written pages to the war in the Philip
pines, lie recites how the islands came
to the United St.-ites by the terms of the
treaty with Spain and says that he has
every reason to Ivlievc that this trans
fer of Koverc'gniy was in accordance
with the wishes and aspirations of the
great mass of the Filipino pconl. He
says that no opportunity was lost of as
suring the people of the island of our
ardent dssire for their welfare and of the
intention of this government to do ev
erythine possible to advance their inter
ests. He reviews the appointment of the
"Philippine commissioners and then says:
"But before their arrival at Manila tht
sinister ambition of a few leaders of the
Filipinos had created a situation full of
embarrassment for us and most grievous
in its consequences to themselves." He
refers to tho report of the commission tc
show that the claim of the rebel leadet
that he was promised independence in
return for his assistance has no founda
tion in fact.
"No sooner had our army captured
Manila," says Uie president, "than tht
Filipino forces began to assume an atti
tude of suspicion and hostility which the
utmost efforts of our ofiiccrs and troop:
were unable to disarm or modify. Theit
kindness and forbearance were taken as
a proof of cowardice. The aggressions
of the Filipinos continually increased
until finally, just before the time set by
the senate of the United States for a
vote upon the treaty, au attack, evidently
prepared iu advance, was made all alonj
the American line, which resulted iu a
terribly destructive and sanguinary re
pulse of the insurgents."
THE INSURGENT PROCLAMA
TION. President "McKinley then quotes from
the insurgent proclamation, which con
templated the massacre of the Americans
in Man,ila, of which General Otis said
that "for barbarous intent it is unequaled
in modern times." He then quotes as fol
lows from the report of the commission
sent to the Philippines, in which the fol
lowing words were used: ''It is not to be
conceived of that any American woula
have sanctioned the surrender of Manila
to the insurgents. Our obligations to
other nations and to the friendly Filipi
nos and to ourselves and our flag de
manded that force should be met by
force. Whatever the future of the Phil
ippines may be, there is no course open
to us now except the prosecution of the
war until the insurgents are reduced to
submission. The commission is of the
opiniou that there has been no time since
the destruction of the Spanish squadron
by Admiral Dewey when it was possible
to with withdraw our forces from the
islands either with honor to ourselves or
with safety to the inhabitants."
The president then says:
"The course thus clearly indicated has
been unflinchingly pursued. The rebel
lion must be. put down. Civil govern
ment cannot be thoroughly established
until order is restored. With a devotion
and gallantry worthy of its most brilliant
history the army, ably and loyally assist
ed by the navy, has carried on this un
welcome but most righteous campaign
with richly, deserved success. The noble
self sacrifice with which our soldiers and
sailors whose terms of service had expir
ed refused to avail themselves of their
right to return home as long as they were
needed at the front forms one of the
brightest pages in our annals. Although
their operations have been somewhat in
terrupted and checked by a rainy sea
son of unusual violonce and duration,
they have gained ground steadily ia ev
ery direction and now look forward con
fidently to a speedy .completion of their
task.
"The unfavorable circumstances con
nected with an active campaign have
not been permitted to interfere, with the
equally important work of reconstruction
Again I invite your attention to the re
port of the commissioners for the inter
esting and encouraging details of the
work already accomplished in the estab
lishment ot- peace and order and the in
auguration of self governing municipal
life in many portions of the archipelago.
A notable beginning has been made in
the establishment of a government in the
island of Negros which is deserving of
special consideration. This was the first
island to accept American sovereignty.
Its people unreservedly proclaimed alle
giance to the United stales and adopted
a constitution looking to the establish
ment of a popular government. It was
impossible to guarantee to the people ol
Negros that the constitution so adopted
should be the ultimate form of govern
ment. Such a question, under the treaty
with Spain and in accordance with out
own constitution and laws, came exclu
sively within the jurisdiction of the con
gress. The government actually set up
by the inhabitants of Negros eventually
proved unsatisfactory to the natives
themselves.
THE GOVERNMENT OF NEGROS.
"A new system was put into force by
order of the major general commandinh
the department, of which the following
are the most important elements:
"It was ordered that the government ol
the island of Negrfs should consist of a
military governor appointed by the Unit
ed States military governor of the Philip
pines and a civil governor and an a.l
visory council elected by the people. The
military governor was authorized to ap
point secretary of ii-cusury, interior, agri
culture, public insi ruction, an attorney
general and an auditor. The seat of the
government wus i:ed at Bacolod. Tin
military governor exercises the suprenx
executive power. He is to see that the
laws arc executed, apooint to o!;:ice anc
till all. vacancies iu o'fico not otherwise
provided for, and tuny. vi!h the approva.
of the military governor of the Philip
pines, remove any officer from office. The
cml governor advises the military gov
ernor on :tll public civil questions sue
presides over the advisory council. He
in general, perfoms the duties which ar
performed by secret-aries of state iu out
own system of government."
SLAVERY IN THE SULUS.
He next teHs of t.c succession of ti-,r
U ni ted States to the rights of Spain uei
the Suln islands. He adds:
"Article 10 provides that any slave it
the archipelago of Jolo shall have the
right to purchr.se freedom by paying f
the master ihc usual market value. The
aereenipnt by General Bates was made
subject to confirmation by the president
and to future modifications by the con
sent of the parties in interest. I hav
confirmed said agreement, subject to til.;
action ot the coio-'vss. and with the res
ervation which 1 have directed shall be
cotumunio.-itcd ro the sultan of Jolo. that
this agreement is not to lie deemed in any
way to auttiori-'.e or jrive the consent ot
the United Stalest to the existence of
slavery in the Suln archipelago.. I corn
mtinicate those facts to the congress foi
its information and :icrio!i.
"Everything indicates that v ith the
speed y suppression of the Tagalo rebel
lion l-'fe in the archipelago will soon re
Mime its ordinary course under the pro
tection of our sovereignly, and the peo
ple of those favored islands will enjoy a
prosperity and a freedom which they
have never before known. Already hun
dreds of schools are cren and filled witfc
children. Ilolieious freedom is sacredly
assured and enjoyed. The courts. are dis
pensing justice. Business is beginning to
circulate in its accustomed channels. Ma
nila, whose inhabitants were fleeing tc
the country a few months ago. is now a
populous and thriving mart of commerce.
The earnest and unremitting endeavors
of the commission end the admiral and
major trem-rnl commanding the depart
ment of the PaciSc to assure the people oi
the beneficent intentions of this govern
.ment have had their legitimate effect in
convincing the great mass of them that
peace and safety and prosperity and sta
ble government can only be found in a
loyal acceptance of the authority of the
United States.
A GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY.
"The future government of the Phiiip
pinnes," says the president, "rests with
the congress of the United States. Few
graver responsibilities have ever been
confided to us. If we accept them in a
spirit worthy of our race and our tradi
tions, a great opportunity comes with
them. The islands lie under the sheltet
of our flag. They are ours by every title
of law and equity. They cannot be
abandoned. If we desert them, we leave
them at once to anarchy and finally tc
barbarism. We fitng them, a golden ap
ple of discord, among the rival powers,
no one of which could permit another to
seize them unquestioned. Their rich
plains and valleys would be the scene oi
endless strife and bloodshed. The ad
vent of Dewey's fleet in Manila bay, in
stead of being, as we hope, the dawn ot
a new day of freedom and progress, will
have been the beginning of an era of mis
ery and violence worse than any which
has darkened their unhappy past.
"The. suggestion has been made that
we could renounce our authority over the
islands and, giving them independence,
could retain a protectorate over them.
This proposition wiH not be found. I am
sure, worthy of your serious atteution.
Such an arrangement would involve at
the outset a cruel breach of faith. It
would place the peaceable and loyal ma
jority, who ask nothing better than to
accept our authority, at the mercy of the
majority of armed insurgents. It would
make us responsible for the acts of the
insurgent leaders and give us no power te
control them. It would charge us witti
the task' of protecting them against each
other and defending them against anj
foreign power with which they chose tc
quarrel. In short, it would take from
the congress of the United States the
power of declaring war and vest that tre
roendous prerogative in the Tagal leadei
of the hour.
THE DUTY OF CONGRESS.
"It does not seem desirable . that I
should recommend at this time a specific
and final form of government for these
islands. - When peace shall be restored,
it will be the duty of congress to con
struct a plan of government which shall
establish and. maintain freedom and or
der and peace in the Philippines. The
insurrection is still existing, and when
it terminates further information will be
required as to the actual condition of
attairs before inaugurating a permanent
chenxe ot civil government. The full
report of the commission, now in prep
aration, will contain information and
suggestions which will be of -value to
congress and which I will transmit as
soon as it is completed. As long as the
insurrection continues the military arm
must necessarily be supreme. But there
is no reason why steps should not be
taken from time to time to inaugurate
governments essentially popular in their
form as fast as territory is held and con
trolled by our troops. To this end I
am considering the advisabUity of the
return of the commission, or such of the
members thereof as can be secured, to
aid the existing authorities and facili
tate this work throughout the islands.
I have believed that reconstruction
should not begin by the establishment
of one central civil government for all
the islands, with its seat at Manila, but
rather that the work should be commenc
ed by building up from the bottom, first
establishing municipal governments and
then provisional governments, a central
government at last to follow.
"Until congress shall have made known
the formal expression of its will I shall
use the authority vested in me by the
constitution and the stntntes to uphold
the sovereignty of the United States in
those distant islands as in all other
places where our flag rightfully floats.
I shall put at the disposal of the army
and navy all the means which the lib
erality of congress and the people have
provided to cause this unprovoked and
wasteful insurrection to cease. If any
orders of mine were required to insure
the merciful conduct of military and
naval operations, they would not be lack
ing; but every step of the progress of our
troops has been marked by a humanity
which has surprised even tlte misguided
insnrcents. The truest kindness to them
will be a swift and effective defeat- of
their present leader. The hour of victory
will K the hour of clemency and recon
struction. WORK OF RECONSTRUCTION.
'No effort will be spared to build up
the waste places desolated by war and
by long years of misgovernnient. We
shall not wait for the end ofstrife to
begin the beneficent work. We shall con
tinue, as we have begun, to open the
schools and the churches, to set the
courts in operation, to foster industry
and trade and agriculture and rn every
way in our power to make these people
whom Providence has brought within
our jurisdiction feel that it is their lib
erty and not our power, their, welfare
and not our gain, we are seeking to en
hsuce. Our ti3sr has never waved over
any community but in blessing. .1 be
lieve rh-? Filipinos will soon recognize ths
fact that it has not lost its gift of bene
diction in its worldwide journey to their
shores."
Concerning Hawaii. President McKin
ley says if. is important that an act
should be passed erecting these islands
into a judicial district and provide for
the appointment of a judge and other of
ficers. GOVERNMENT IN ALASKA.
He continues:
"The whole vast area of Alaska com
prises but one judicial district, with one
judge, one marshal and one district attor
ney, yet the civil and criminal bnsine?s
has more than doubled within the past
year and is many times greater both in
volume and importance than it was in
15-!. The duties of the judere require
him to travel thousands of mites to discharge-
his judicial duties at the various
places (iesi.snat.-l for that purpose. The
territory should be divided into at least
two districts and an additional judge,
district attorney, marshal and other ap
propriate officers be provided.
"In like manner a system of latrs pro-
! vi ling for the incorporation and govern-
meet of towus and cities having a cer
tain population, giving them the power to
! establish and maintain a system of edu
! cation to be loc;ily supported, and ordi
! nances providing for sanitary and other
such purposes could be speedily provided.
I believe a provision of this kind would
be satisfactory to the people of the terri
tory. It is probable that the area is too
vast and the population too scattered and
transitory to make it wise at the present
time to provide for an elective legislative
body, but the conditions calling for local
self government will undoubtedly ver
soon exist and will be facilitated by the
measures which I hove recommended.
"I recommend that legislation to th
same end be had with reference to th
government of Porto Rico. The time i
ripe for the adoption of a temporary
form of government for this island, an
many suggestions made with reference t
Alaska are applicable also to Porto Rico.
PQRTO RICO'S COMMERCE.
"It must be borne in mind that sinco
the cession Porto Rico has been denied
the principal markets she had long en
joyed and our tariffs have been continued
against her products as when she was
under Spanish sovereignty. The markets
of Spain are closed to her products except
upon terms to which the commerce of ail
nations is subjected. The island of Cuba,
which used to buy her cattle aud tobacco
without customs duties, now imposes the
same deities upon these products as from
any other country entering her porta.
She has therefore lost her free inter
course with Spain and Cuba without any
compensating benefits in this market.
Her coffee was little known and not in
use by our people, and therefore there
was no demand here for this one of het
chief products. The markets of the Unit
ed States should be opened up to her
products. Our plain duty is to abolish
all customs tariffs between the United
States and Porto Rico and give . her
products free access to our markets.
"As a result of the hurricane which
swept over Porto Rico on the 8th of Au
gust, 1S99, over 100,000 people were re
duced to absolute destitution, without
homes and deprived of the necessaries of
life. To the appeal of the war depart
ment the people of the United States
made prompt and generous response. In
addition to the private charity cf our
people, the war department has expended
for the relief of the distressed $382,
342.63, which does not include the cost of
transportation."
Mr. McKinley repeats in his message
the words he used in his inaugural sjh
dress concerning lynchings in the United
States. He calls upon the people of th
country to faithfully uphold the right of
trial by jury.
The last subject discussed In the raea
sage is civil service. The president saya
that the amendments promulgated by the
executive order of May 29, 1S99, to the
order of May 6, 1890, were made when it
became evident to the heads of depart
ments that the amendments were neces
sary to an efficient and harmonious ad
ministration of the departments. He
claims that the results obtained show
that the public service has improved and
that the civil service system is rabeved
of many of its objectionable featurtav
