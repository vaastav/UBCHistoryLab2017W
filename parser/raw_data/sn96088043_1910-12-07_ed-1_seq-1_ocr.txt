CONGRESS OPENS
SHORT SESSION
Indications Are Little General
Legislation Will Be
Attempted.
Washington. The sixty-first con
gress assembled Monday for its final
session. Almost Immediately after
convening both houses followed the
custom of adjourning for one day out
of reepect to the memory of those
members who have died during the
summer recess. Five senators and
three representatives have died since
the beginning of summer. Upon re
assembling Tuesday tne two houses
listened to the reading of the presi
dent's annual message.
The message was unusually long,
running from 30,000 to 40,000 word3
In a general way the president urged
upon congress the necessity for enact
ing legislation to build up the Ameri
can merchant marine, to conserve the
natural resources of the country, to
provide a new form of government
for Alaska, to "supplement and
strengthen" the Sherman anti-trust
law, to enlarge the scope of the civil
service law, to create a national bu
reau of health, to provide a legislative
basis for worklngmen's compensation,
for the limitation of injunctions is
sued by federal courts, and to pro
mote closer commercial relations with
Canada. The president also gave his
views In regard to the further regu
lation and control' of corporations
engaged in interstate business and
the regulation of the Issue of stocks
and bonds of Interstate railways.
Get Down to Business.
After .the readrag of President
Taft's annual message the lawmak
ers were able to get down to business
almost Immediately, as the details
of organization" arid ' committee
changes requ'ired little time. The
opinion is galalng ground that little
else than the passage of the' various
appropriation bills will be attempted.
Statements by leaders of various
parties and factions Indicate that the
short session will do little else than
pass the regular appropriation bills.
The regular Republicans declare:
"Well, we will get the routine out of
the way." The routine being the nu
merous appropriation bills.
The Democrats say: "Well, let's
see what the Republicans will do.
Our turn comes next year."
The insurgents say: "We are here
to fight for progressive legislation, if
we can get the chance."
Bills to Clean Up.
The big thing staring the legisla
tors in the face is cleaning up the ap
propriation bills, of which there are
12. President Taft has been calling
on the department heads for economy
and he Is expected to continue the
process with the legislators. Until
these bills are cleaned up it is pretty
certain that nothing in the way of
general legislation will be attempted.
Packer Schenk Offer Ball.
Wheeling, W. Va. As has been ex
pected by the defense all along, John
O. Schenk, the millionaire packer, has
rallied to the support of his wife, who
is a prisoner in jail here, charged
with having attempted to poison him.
Soon ' after being removed from the
hospital to the home of his sister, he
ascertained that his wife could be re
leased on ball and notified Mr3.
Schenk's attorneys that he would go
on her bond.
Roseburg Man Father of 22.
Roseburg. The birth of a daughter
to the wife of Levi White, in this city,
makes Mr. White a father for the
twenty-second time. This Is the
twelfth child of . the couple. Mr.
White's first wife bore him ten chil

FIGHTING RESUMED
. BY MEXICAN REBELS
Peace .Commission Hampered
by Soldiers in Restoring
Order.
El Paso, Tex. A telegram from
Marfa, Tox., states that apprehension
and excitement prevails at both Pre
sidio and Candolarla, 90 miles south
of the Texas side of the river, owing
to the revolutionary disorders re
ported on the Mexican side. Nothing
definite has yet been learned of the
reported fight at Ojinaga Saturday
night. Firing has been heard at in
tervals, but o far as can be learned
there has been no lose of life.
. . Members of the peace commission
returning to Chihuahua reported that
their work was greatly embarrassed
by the fact that soldiers followed at
their heels. At Guerrero, Just as they
were beginning to talk with the in
surrectos, a peon arrived with word
that the soldier were on the way,
whereupon the meeting promptly
came to an end.
Main Grievance Against State.
At Guerrero, and also at San Anto
nio, the commissioners were told that
the main grievance la against the
state government rather than against
Diaz.
. Seemingly authentic reports state
that Guerrero has been taken by the
revolutionists with some loss of life.
Details are lacking. It Is reported
that General Plata, commanding this
military zone, Is to be succeeded by
General Juan Hernandez immediately.
It Is learned that the peace com
mission which left Chihuahua to treat
with the lnsurrectos was acting un
der the authority of Governor San
chez, and not President Diaz.
PRESIDENT TAFT
SEEKS HARMONY
Washington. In what was said to
be an Initial effort to bring about a
semblance of harmony In the divided
Republican forces of the United
States senate, President Taft Invited
several regular and progressive lead
ers to the White House.
In Insurgent circles it was said the
preliminary conference with the
president bad given no definite prom
ise of success. The president was
reported as conciliatory and Is said
to have declared he was anxious to
do all In his power to bring about
unity of action in the party.
At the White House it was not ad
mitted that President Taft was not
making a special effort to bring the
insurgents or progressives into line.
It was declared with a great deal of
emphasis' that Messrs. Cummins, Bo
rah and Brls-tow had been invited to
call only as a part of the president's
plan to consult as many as possible
of the senators and congressmen re
garding recommendations in his mes
sage and the legislation program.
NO BATTLESHIP FLEET
Coast Will Not Be Prtteoted Until
Canal Opena.
Washington. The Pacific Coast will
not get a battleship fleet until the
Panama Canal is completed, accord
ing to the annual report of the Sec
retary of the Navy. This is a reiter
ation of statements made by Secre
tary Meyer on bis recent tour of the
Coast.
An equally Important feature of the
Secretay's report la bla free and frank
criticism f the two navy-yards on the
Pacific Coast, both of which, in his
judgment, were , poorly located, the
Puget Sound yard because of ita dis
tance from any large city, and the
Mare Island navy yard because of
shallow water, rendering it valueless
in the repair of battleships and heavy
crulsera, and also because of its re
moteness from San Francisco.
Home-Made 8till Seized.
Eugene. Deputy Internal Revenue
Collector Schulberg, of Salem, and bis
assistant, A. F. Tornllnson, made a
raid on a moonshiner's still in the
mountains near Lorane.
The still consisted of a big copper
kettle holding about two barrels, the
necessary "worm" and other appara
tus known to the moonshiner. The
outfit was brought to this, city and
(hipped to the collector of Internal
revenue at Portland. The name of
the owner of the still baa not been
learned.

Eddy, discoverer and founder of Chris
tian Science, is dead, after an illness

of the Christian Science Church ' as
practiced by Mrs. Eddy will never
MRS. MARY BAKER CLOVER EDDY
again be vested In one person, accord,
ing to the opinion of Howard C. Vaa
Meter, of the committee on publica
tion in this city, who viewed, with
some understanding' of the situation,
the changes that are almost certala
to fojlow her death.
"the board of directors of tha
mother church, the FirBt Church oi
Christ Scientist in Boston, is suf
ficient to the movement, to far as

SECRETARY BALLINGER
MAY BEJMPEACHED
Washington. A resolution for tha
Impeachmeut of Secretary Ballinger
has been - proposed and may be
Introduced in the house at any time
its Introduction is timely. It the min
ority report, censuring Ballinger, ia
adopted by the house, tfaa Impeach
ment resolution will follow almost
immediately, perhaps at the aama
time tne minority report la adopted.
The probability that th house will
follow that course by a combination
between insurgents and Demoorats
worries the administration very much.
If the house should Impeach, tha sen
ate must, under the constitution, alt
as Judge on the house charges.
Only a change in the present situa
tion can prevent tha . house from
adopting the report censuring Ballin
ger, and it ia argued that then tha
bouse must go on to impeachment ox
be inconsistent.
