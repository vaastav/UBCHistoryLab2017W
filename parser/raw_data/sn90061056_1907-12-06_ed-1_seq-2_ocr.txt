Washington. Dec. 3. President
Roosovelt's annual message to congress
ti a voluminous document of nearly
10,000 words, by far tho longest mes
sage he has ever submitted to congress.
The opening subject of the message Is
the financial condition of tho country,
and for which the president lays much
of the blame upon unscrupulous stock
peculators, and says:
"In any large body of men, however,
there aro certain to be some who aro
dishonest, and If the conditions are
such that these men prosper or com
mit their misdeeds with Impunity, their
example Is a very evil thing for the
community. Where these men are busi
ness men of great sagacity and of tem
perament both unscrupulous and reck
less, and where the conditions aro such
that they act without supervision or
control and at first without effective
check from public opinion, they delude
many Innocent people Into making In
vestments or embarking In kinds of
business that are really unsound.
When the misdeeds of these successful
ly dishonest men are discovered, suf
fering comes not only upon them, but
upon the Innocent men whom they
have misled. It Is a painful awakening,
whenever it occurs", and, naturally,
when It does occur thoso who suffer
are apt to forget that tho longer It was
deferred the more painful It would be.
Iv tho effort to punish the guilty It Is
both wise and proper to endeavor so
far as posslblo to minimize the dis
tress of those who have been misled by
the guilty. Yet It Is not posslblo to
refrain becauso of such distress from
striving to put an end to tho misdeeds
that are tho ultimate causes of the suf
fering, and, ns a means to this end,
where possible to punish those re
sponsible for' them. There may be hon
est differences of opinion as to many
governmental policies; but surely there
can be no such differences as to the
neCd of unflinching perseverance In the
war against successful dishonesty."
He quotes at length from his mes
sage of last year In which he advo
cated federal control of corporations
doing Interstate business, and believes
that In such control would be found tho
remedy for overcapitalization and
stock speculation which he believes
have brought about tho present finan
cial conditions. He says:
"Our steady aim should be by legis
lation, cautiously and carefully under
taken, but resolutely persevered In, to
assert the sovereignty of the national
government by affirmative action.
"This Is only In form an Innovation.
In substance It Is merely a restoration;
for from the earliest time such regula
tion of IndQstrlal activities has been
recognized In the action of the law
making bodies; and all that I propose
Is to meet tho changed conditions In
such manner as will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power It has
always possessed, not only In this coun
try, but also In England before and
since this country became a separate
nation.
Federal Control of
Itullroads la ravored.
"No small part of the trouble that we
have comes from carrying to an ex
treme tho national vlrtuo of self-reliance,
of Independence In Initiative
and action. It Is wise to conserve this
virtue and to provide for Its fullest ex
ercise, compatible with seeing that lib
erty does not become a liberty to
wrong others. Unfortunately, this Is
the kind of liberty that the lack of all
effective regulation Inevitably breeds.
Tho foundera of the constitution pro
vided that the national government
should have complete and sole control
of interstate commerce. There was
then practically no Interstate business
save such as was conducted by water,
and this tho national government at
once proceeded to regulate In thorough
going and effective fashion. Condi
tlons have now so wholly changed that
the Interstate commerce by water Is In
significant compared with tho amount
that goes by land, and almost all big
business concerns aro now engaged In
Interstate commerce. As a result, it
can be but partially and Imperfectly
controlled or regulated by the action of
any one of the several states; such ac
tion Inevitably tending to be either too
drastic or else too lax, and In either
case Ineffective for purposes of Justice,
Only the national government can In
thoroughgoing fashion exercise the
needed control. This docs not mean
that there should bo any extension of
federal authority, for such authority
already exists under the constitution In
amplest and most far-reaching form;
but it does mean that there should be
ah extension of federal activity. This
Is' not advocating centralization. It is
merely looking facts in the face, and
realizing that centralization In business
has already come and can not be avoid
ed or undone, and that the public at
large can only protect Itself from cer
tain evil effects of this business con
trallzatlon by providing better methods
for the exercise of control through the
authority already centralized in the
national government by the constitu
tion Itself. There must be no halt in
the healthy constructive course of ac
tion which this nation has, elected to
pursue, and has steadily pursued, dur
Ing the last six years, as shown both in
the legislation of the congress and the
administration of the law by tho de
partment of Justice. The most vital
need is In connection with the railroads.
As to these, in my Judgment there
should now bo .either a national incor
poratlon act or a law licensing railway
companies to engage in Interstate com
merce upon certain conditions. The law
should bo so framed as to give to the
Interstate commerce commission power
to pass upon ,thc future issue of securl
ties, while ample means should be pro
vlded to enable the commission, when
ever in. Its Judgment it is necessary, to
tnako a physical valuation of any rail
road. As I stated, in my message to the
congress a year .ago, railroads should
do given, power enier wio agree
ments, subject, to these agreements be
tag made public' In minute detail ag to
the consent of the Interstate commerce
commission being first obtained, Until
tho national government assumes
proper control of Interstate commerce,
In tho cxcrclso of the authority it al
ready possesses, It will bo Impossible
either to glvo to or to get from tho
railroads full Justice. Tho railroads
and all other great corporations will
do well to recognize that this control
must come; tho only question Is as to
what governmental body can most
wisely cxcrclso It, Tho courts will de
termine tho limits within which tho
federal authority can exorcise It, and
there will still remain nmplo work
within each state for tho railway com
mission, of that state; and the. national
Interstate commerce commission will
work In harmony with tho several state
commissions, each within Its own prov
ince, to ochlcvo tho deslrod end.
Control of Interstate
Iluslnesa Concerns Urgrd.
'Moreover, In my Judgment there should
bo additional legislation looking to the
proper control of the great business con
cerns engaged In Interstate business, this
control to bo exercised for their own
bonellt and prosperity no less than for
the protection of Investors and of the
general public. As I havo repeatedly
said In messages to congress and else
where, experience has definitely shown
not merely tho unwisdom but tho futility
of endeavoring to put a stop to all busi
ness combinations. Modern Industrial
conditions are such that combination Is
not only necessary but Inevitable. It Is
so In the world of business Just as It Is
so In tho world of labor, and It Is as ldlo
to desire to put an end to all corpora
tions, to all big combinations of capital,
as to desire to put an end to combina
tions of labor. Corporation and labor
union nllko have come to stay. Each If
properly managed is a source of good
and not evil, Whenever In either thero
is evil, It should bo promptly hold to ac
count; but It should receive hearty en
couragement so long as It Is properly
managed. It Is profoundly Immoral to
put or keep on tho statute books a law,
nominally In tho Interest of public moral
ity, that really puts a premium upon
public Immorality, by undertaking to
forbid honest men from doing what must
be done under modern business condi
tions, so that the law Itself provides that
Its own Infraction must bo tho condition
precedent upon business success. To aim
at tho accomplishment of too much usu
ally means tho accomplishment of too lit
tle, and often the doing of positive damage.
The antitrust law should not be re
pealed; but It should bo mado both more
efficient and more In harmony with act
ual conditions. It should bo so amended
as to forbid only the kind of combination
which does harm to the general public.
such amendment to bo accompanied by,
or to bo an' Incident of, a grant of su
pervisory power to the government over
thoso big corporations engaged In Inter
state business. This should be accom
panied by provision for the compulsory
publication of accounts and the subjec
tion of books and papers to the Inspec
tion of tho government officials. A be
ginning has already been mado for such
supervision by the establishment of the
bureau of corporations.
"The antitrust law should not prohibit
combinations that do no Injustice to the
public, still less thoso the existence of
public. But even if this feature of tho
law were abolished, there would remain
as an equally objectionable feature the
difficulty and delay now Incident to its
enforcement. Tho government must now
submit to Irksome and repeated delays
before obtaining a final decision of the
courts upon proceedings Instituted, and
even a favorable decree may mean an
empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to
control these corporations by lawsuits
means to Impose upon both the depart
ment of Justice and tho courts an Im
possible burden; it Is not feasible to carry
on more than a limited number of such
suits. Such a law to be really effective
must of course bo administered by an
executive body, and not merely by means
of lawsuits. The design should be to
prevent the abuses incident to the crea
tion of unhealthy and Improper combina
tions. Instead of waiting until they are
In existence and then attempting to de
stroy them by civil or criminal proceed
ings.

De Amply Safeguarded.
"The congress has the pawer.to charter
corporations to engage In interstate) .qnd
foreign commerce, ana a general .law can
be enacted under the provision of 'which'
existing corporations could take' out 'led-'
eral charters and new fedrnl?;cQrpor(i,i
Hons could be created. An .ejsetUJal rp
vision of such a law should' be'.a me.tho'c(
of nrcdetormlnlnir bv some federal' board
or commission whether tho' applicant fcW

act should be supplemented.- by -7 specific
prohibitions of the methods which.-, , ex-,
perience has shown have been" '6'f most
service In enabling monopolrsttc'comblna-
tlons to crush out competition.. Tho real
owners of a corporation should Ho com
pelled to do business In their owrf name,
The right to hold stock In other corpora
tlons should heareaf ter be denied to inter
state corporations, unless on approval by
the proper government officials, and a
prerequisite to such approval should be
the listing with the government of all
owners and stockholders, both by the
corporation owning such stock and by
the corporations in which such stock is
owned.
"To confer upon the national govern
ment, in connection with the amendment
I advocate in the antitrust law, power of
supervision over die business concerns
engaged In interstate commerce, would
benefit them as it has benefited the na
tional banks. In the recent business
crisis it Is noteworthy that the Institu
tions which failed were Institutions
which were not under the supervision and
control of the national government.
Those which were under national con
trol stood the test.
"National control of the kind above ad
vocated would be to the benefit of every
well-managed railway. From the stand
point ot the public there is need for ad
ditional tracks, adltlonal terminals, and
improvements in the actual handling of
the railroads, ana all this as rapidly as
possible. Ample, safe, and speedy trans
portation facilities are even more neces
sary than cheap transportation. There
fore, there Is need for the investment of
money which will provide for all these
things while at the same time securing as
fas as is possible better wages and
shorter hours for their employes. There
fore, while there must be Just and rea
sonable regulation of rates, we should be
the', first to protest against any arbitrary
ono, unthinking movement to cut them
down without the fullest and most care
ful consideration of all Interests con
cerned and of the actual needs ot the
situation.. Only a special body of men
acting for the national government un
der" authority conferred upon, it1 by the
congress is competent to pass Judgment
on sucn a matter,
i Greater Elasticity in '
Cnirency Is Urged. ,
The president, quotes extensively from
us jmi tnuiagi in dialing with t&a tl
reet subject of currency legislation, and
says;
"I again urgo on the congress the need
f Immodlnto attention to this matter.
We need a greater elasticity In our cur
rency; provided, of courso, that wo recog
nize tho oven greater need of n safo and
secure currency, Thero must always bo
tho most rigid examination by the na
tional authorities. Provision should bo
mado for nn emergency currency. Tho
emergency Issuo should, of course, bo
mado with an effective guaranty, and up
on conditions carefully prescribed by the
government. Such emergency Issuo must
bo based on adequato securities approved
by the government, and must be Issued
under a heavy tax. This would permit
currency being Issued when tho demand
for It was urgont, whllo securing its re
tirement as the demand fell off. It Is
worth Investigating to determine whothor
officers and dlroctors of natlonnl banks
should over bo allowed to loan to them
selves. Trust companies should bo sub
ject to tho same supervision ns banks;
legislation to this effect should bo en
acted for the District of Columbia and
tho territories.
Vet we must also remember that oven
tho wisest legislation on tho subject can
only accomplish a certain amount. No
legislation enn by any possibility guar
antee tho business community against tho
results of speculative folly any moro than
It enn guarantee an Individual against tho
results of his extravagance. When nn In
dividual mortgages his house to buy an
automobile ho Invites disaster; nnd when
wealthy men. or men who poso ns such.
or nro unscrupulously or foolishly eager
to become, such, Indulge In reckless spec
ulationespecially If It Is accompanied by
dishonesty they Jeopardize not only their
own future, but the futuro or all their In
nocent fellow-citizens, for they expose
tho wholo business community to panic
nnd distress."
Ho advises against any general tariff
legislation this session of congress, and
says:
In a country of such phenomenal
growth as ours it Is probably well that
overy dozen years or so the tariff laws
should bo carefully scrutinized so as to
seo that no excessive or Improper bene
fits are conferred thereby, that proper
rovonuo Is provided, and that our
foreign trado Is encourngod. There
must always bo as a minimum
tariff which will not only al
low for the collection of nn ample rev
enue but which will at least make
good the difference tn cost of production
hero nnd abroad; that Is, tho difference In
tho labor cost here and abroad, for tho
well-being of tho wage-worker must over
bo n cardinal point ot American policy.
Tho question should be npproached pure
ly from a business standpoint; both tho
time and the manner of tho chnngo being
such as to arouse tho minimum of agi
tation nnd disturbance in tho business
world, and to glvo tho least play for
selfish and factional motives. Tho solo
consideration should be to seo that tho
sum total of changes represent tho pub
lic good. This means that the subject
cannot with wisdom be dealt with In the
year preceding a presidential election, be
cause as a matter of fact experience has
conclusively shown that at such a tlmo
It Is Impossible to get men to treat It from
tho standpoint of the public good. In my
Judgment the wise time to deal with tho
matter Is Immediately after such elec
tion."
He ask3 for tho repeal of the tariff on
paper and wood pulp.
He reviews and enlarges upon his pre
vious recommendations for the enact
ment of federal Inheritance and Income
tax laws.
Attention Is called to the prosecution of
wealthy offenders against the national
laws, and In this connection ho asks that
tho laws under which these prosecutions
aro brought be strengthened and made
more definite.
The Use nnd the
Abuse of Injunctions.
"Instances of abuse In tho granting of
Injunctions in labor, disputes, continue to
occur, and tho resentment In the minds
of thoso who feel that their rights are
being Invaded and their liberty of action
and of speech unwarrantably restrained
continues to grow. Much of tho attack
on the use of the process of injunction Is
wholly without warrant; but I am con
strained to express the belief that for
some of It there Is warrant. This ques
tion Is becoming more and more of prime
Importance, and unless the courts will
themselves deal with It In effectlvo man
ner, It Is certain ultimately to demand
some form of legislative action. It would
bo most unfortunate for our social wel-
Ifare If wo should permit many honest
and law-abluing citizens to feel that
they had Just causo for regarding our
courts with hostility. I earnestly com
mend to the attention of tho congress
this matter, so that some way nay be
devised which will limit tho abuse of In
Junctions and protect those rights which
from time to time It unwarrantably in
vades. Moreover, discontent Is often ex
pressed with tho use of tho process of
Injunction by the courts, not only In la'
bor disputes, but where state laws are
concerned. I refrain from discussion of
this question as I am informed that it
will soon receive the consideration of the
supremo court."
Of other legislation in the Interest of
labor he favors federal Inspection of rail
roads; providing limited but definite com
pensation for accidents to all workmen
employed in any way by the government.
and says:
"The constitutionality of the employers'
liability act passed by the preceding con
gress has been carried before the courts.
In two Jurisdictions the law has been do.
clared unconstitutional, and In three Juris
dictions Its constitutionality has been .af
firmed. The question has been carried to
tne supreme court, the case has been
heard by that tribunal, and a decision is
expected at an early date. In the event
that the court should affirm the consti
tutionality of the act, I urge further leg
islation along the lines advocated In my
message to the preceding congress. The
practice of putting tho entire burden of
loss of life or limb upon the vlotlm or
the victim's family Is a form of social in
justice in which the United Btates stands
in unenviable prominence. In both our
federal and our state legislation we have.
with few exceptions, scarcely gone
farther than the repeal of the fellow-.
servant principle of the old law of liabil
ity, and in some of our states oven this
slight modification ot a complete out
grown principle has not yet been se
cured."
He favors the extension of the eight-
hour law to all departments of the gov
ernment, and to all work carried on by
the government. He urges legislation
for the compulsory investigation of in'
dustrlal disputes, and says:
"The need for some provision for such
investigation was forcibly illustrated
during the past summer, A strike of
telegraph operators seriously Interfered
with telegraphic communication, caus
ing great damage to business interests
and serious inconvenience to the gen
eral public. Appeals were made to me
from many parts of the country, from
city councils, from boards of trade,
from chambers of commerce, and from
labor organizations, urging that steps
be taken to terminate the 'strike.
Everything that could with any pro
prlety be done by a, representative of
the government was done without avail.
and. for weeks the publlo stood by and
suffered wunout recourse 01 any Kind,
Had the machinery existed and had.
there been autnorny xori compulsory
.Investigation of. the dispute, the public
i would have been' placed in possession
of the merits 'of the controversy; and
public opinion" woulaV probably have
brought about prompt adjustment.
"It li Idle to hold that Without feoA
laws evils such ns child labor, as the
over-working of women, as tho fail
ure to protoot omploycs from loss of
life or limb, can bo cffontlvoly reached,
any more than tho evils of rebates nnd
tock-wnterlng can be teachod without
good laws. To fall to stop these prac
tices by legislation means to force
honest men Into thorn, becauso other
wise tho dishonest who surely will
tiko ndvantago of them will have
verythlng their own wny. If tho states
will correct theso ovlls. well and good;
but the nation must stand ready to aid
thorn.
nlnnd Wnterwny Systems
Should lie Deevlopcd.
The conservation of our national re
sources nnd tholr proper use constitute
tho fundamental problem which under
lies almost overy othor problem-of our
national life. Wo must maintain for
ur civilization tho adequate material
basis without which that civilization
cannot exist. Wo must show foresight,
wo must look ahead. As a nation we
not only enjoy a wonderful measure of
present prosperity but If this prosper
ity Is used aright It is on earnest or
future success such ns no othor nation
will have. Tho roward of foresight foi
this nation Is great and easily foretold.
Hut thero must bo tho look ahead,
there must bo a realization of tho fnct
that to waste, to destroy, our natural
resources, to skin and exhaust the land
Instead of using It so as to Increase Its
usefulness, wlll'-result In undermining
In tho days of our children the vory
prosperity which wo ought by 'right to
hand down to thorn amplified nnd devel
oped. For tho last few years, through
soveral agencies, tho government has
been endeavoring to get our people to
look ahead and to substitute a planned
and orderly development of our ro-
ourccs u place of a haphazard striv
ing for Immediate profit. Our great
river systems should be developed as
national water highways; the Missis
sippi, with Its tributaries, standing first
In importance, and tho Columbia sec
ond, although thero aro many others of
lmportanco on tho Pacific and Atlantic
and tho gulf slopes. The national gov
ernment should undcrtako this work,
and I hopo a beginning will bo made
In tho present congress; nnd tho great
est of all our rivers, the Mississippi,
should recelvo especial attention. From
tho Great Lakes to the mouth of tho
Mississippi thero should b'o a deop wa-
erway, with deep waterways leading
from It to the east and tho west. Such
a wntorway would practically mean
tho extension ot our coast line into tho
very heart of our country. It would bo
of Incalculable benefit to our people. If
begun at once It can bo carried through
In tlmo appreciably to relievo the con
gestion of our great freight-carrying
lines of railroads. Tho work should bo
systematically and continuously carried
forward In accordance with some well
concelvcd plan. Tho main streams
should bo Improved to tho highest
point of efficiency before tho Improve
ment ot the branches Is attempted; and
tho work should bo kept free from
every taint of recklessness or Jobbery."
Attention Is called to the work of ir
rigation and reclamation of govern
ment lands. In tho same, connection he
asks for a revision of the publlo land
laws along the lines proposed by the
public lands commission. Believes tho
government should Increase Its efforts
to conserve our forests nnd should In
crease by purchase the existing forest
preserves. On the subject of the natural
resources of tho nation he says:
"In the eastern United States the
mineral fuels havo already passed into
the hands of large private owners, and
thoso of tho west aro rapidly following.
It Is obvious that these fuels should be
conserved and not wasted, and It would
bo well to protect the people against
unjust and extortionate prices, so far
as that can still be done. What has
been accomplished in the great oil
fields of tho Indian Territory by the
action of tho administration offers a
striking example of tho good results
of such a policy. In my Judgment the
government should havo tho right to
keep tho fee of the coal, oil and gas
fields In Its own possession and to lease
the rights to develop them under
proper regulations; or else. If the con
gress will not adopt this method, the
coal deposits should be sold under Urn
itattons, to conserve them as public
utilities, the right to mino coal being
separated from tho title to the soli.
The regulations should permit coal
lands to be worked In sufficient quan
tity by tho several corporations. The
present limitations havo been absurd,
excessive, and serve no useful purpose,
and often render it necessary that
there should bo either fraud or else
abandonment of tho work of getting
out the coal."
Progress of tho Work
On the Pnnnmn Cannl.
"Work on tho Panama canal is pro
cecdlng in a highly satisfactory man
ner. In March tho total excavation tn
the Culebra Cut, where effort was
chiefly concentrated, was 815,270 cubic
yards. In April this was Increased to
879,527 cubic yards. There was a con
slderable decrease in the output for
May and June owing partly to the ad
vent of tho rainy season and partly to
temporary troublo with tho steam
shovel men over the question of wages,
This troublo was settled satisfactorily
to all parties and in July the total ex
cavatlon advanced materially and in
August the grand total from all points
In tho canal prism by steam shovels
and dredges exceeded all previous
United States records, reaching 1,274,
404 cubic yards. In September this rcc
ord was eclipsed and a total of 1,517,
412 eubio yards was removed. Of this
amount 1,481,307 cubic yards were from
the canal prism and 36,105 cubic yards
were from accessory works. These re
sults were achieved in the rainy sea
son with a rainfall in August of 11.89
inches and In Beptember of 11.65 Inches,
Dinauy, in uctooer, tne record was
again eclipsed, the .total excavation bo
ing 1,868,729 cubic yards; a truly ex
traordlnary record, especially in view
of tho heavy rainfall, which was 17.1
inches. In fact, experience during the
last two rainy Beasons demonstrates
that the rains are a less serious ob
stacle to progress than has hitherto
been supposed.
"Work on the locks and dams at
uatun, which began actively in March
last, has advanced so far that it is
thought that masonry work on the
locks can bo begun within 15 months,
"Last winter bids were requested and
received for doing the work of canal
construction by contract. None of them
was found to be satisfactory and all
were rejected. It is the unanimous
opinion of the present commission that
the work can be done better, more
cheaply,, and more quickly by the gov
ernment than by private contractors,
Fully 80 per cent, of the entire plant
needed lor construction nas been pur
chased or contracted for: machine
shops have been erected and equipped
for making an neeoea repairs to th

of' furnishing more labor than can be
used advantageously; employes are
well sheltered and. well fed; salaries
paid are satisfactory, and the work is'
not only going forward smoothly, but
It Is producing' results far- in advanoe
of the most sanguine anticipations.
Under these favorable conditions.

the work' would ca unwise ana unjustl

lie existing conditions, cheok progress,
and increase the cost and lengthen the
time of completing the canal.
President ltecommends
Postal Savings Hanks,
"I commend to the favorable consid
eration of tho congress postal sav
ings bank systom, as recommended by
tho postmaster general. The primary
njeot is to encourage among our peo
ple economy nnd thrift and by the use
postal savings banks to glvo them
an opportunity to husband their re
sources, particularly those who havo
not the facilities at hand tor depositing
tholr money In savings banks. Viewed,
howovor, from the oxperlonce ot the
past few weokB, It Is evident that tho
dvantages of such nn institution are
till more far-rsachtng. Timid depos
itors havo withdrawn their savings for
tho tlmo being from national banks; In
dividuals havo hoarded tholr cash and
the worklngmcn their earnings; all
f which money has been withdrawn
nd kept In hiding or In the safo de
posit box to tho detriment of pros-
erlty. Through the agency of tho pos
tal Bavlngs banks such money would be
restored to tho channels ot trndo, to
tho mutual benefit of capital and labor.
I further commend to the congress
the consideration of the postmastor
general's rccoinmondatlon for an ex
tension of tho parcol post, especially on
the rural routes. Thero ore now 3S,-
15 rural routes, serving nearly 15,000,-
000 people, who do not have the ad
vantages of the Inhabitants of cities In
btalnlng their supplies. These recom
mendations have been drawn up to
benefit tho farmor aad the country
torokecper; otherwise, I should not
favor them, for I bellove that It Is good
policy for our government to do every
thing possible to nld tho small town
and tho country district. It Is desirable
that tho country merchant should not
bo crushed out.
'The fourth-class postmasters' con
vention has passed a very strong reso
lution In favor ot placing the fourth
class postmasters under the civll-sorv-
ice law. Tho administration has al
ready put into effect tho policy of re
fusing to removo any fourth-class post
masters save for reasons connected
with tho good of tho service; and It Is
endeavoring so far as posslblo to re
movo them from thoadomaln of partisan
politics. It would bo a most desirable
thing to put tho fourth-class postmas

Corporation Contributions
to Compntgn Expenses.
'Under .our form of government voting
is not merely a right but a duty. and.
moreover, a fundamental and necessary
duty if a man Is to be a good citizen.
It Is well to provide that corporations
snan not contribute to presidential or
national campaigns, and furthermore to
provldo for tho publication of both con
tributions and expenditures. There Is,
however, nlwnys danger In laws of this
kind, which from their very naturo are
difficult, of onforccmcnt; the danger being
lest they be obeyed only by tho honest,
and disobeyed by the unscrupulous, so
as to act only as a penalty upon honest
men. Moreover, no such law would ham
per an unscrupulous man ot unlimited
means from buying his own way Into of
fice. There Is a very radical measure
which would, I bellevo, work a substan
tlal Improvement -in our system of con
ducting a campaign, although I am well
awaro that It will take some time for
pcoplo to so familiarize themselves with
such a proposal as to be willing to con
sider Its adoption. The need for collect
ing largo campaign funds would vanish It
congress provided an appropriation for
the proper and legitimate expenses ot
each of the great national parties, an ap
proprlatlon ample enough to meet the
necessity for thorough organization and
machinery, which requires a large ex
penditure of money. Then the stipula
tion should be made that no party re
celvlng campaign funds from the treasury
should accept more than a fixed amount
from any Individual subscriber or donor;
and the necessary publicity for receipts
and expenditures could without difficulty
be provided."
Wnnts Improvement In the
Ocenn Mnll Service.
"I call your especial attention to the un
satisfactory condition of our foreign mall
service, which, because of tho lack of
American steamship lines. Is now largely
done through foreign lines, and which.
particularly so far as South and Central
America are concerned, Is done in a man
ner which constitutes a serious barrier
to tho extensions of our commerce.
'The time has come, in my Judgment,
to set to work seriously to make our
ocean mall service correspond more
closely with our recent commercial and
political development. A beginning was
made by tho ocean mall act of March 3.
1891, but even at that time the act was
known to be inadequate In various par
ticulars. Since that time events have
moved rapidly In our history. We have
acquired Hawaii, the Philippines, and
lesser Islands In the Pacific. We are
steadily prosecuting the ' great work of
uniting at the Isthmus the waters of the
Atlantic and the Pacific. To a greater
extent than seemed probably even
dozen years ago we may look to an
American future on the sea worthy ot
the tradition ot our past.. As the first
step In that direction, and the step most
feasible at the present time, I recommend
the extension ot the ocean mall act of
1891. That act has stood for some years
free from successful criticism of its prln
clple and purpose. It was based on theo
ries of the obligations of a great marl
time nation, undisputed in our own land
and followed by other nations since the
beginning of steam navigation. Briefly
those theories are, that it Is the duty of
a first-class power so far as practicable
to carry its ocean malls under its own
flag; that the fast ocean steamships and
their crews, required for such mall serv
ice, are valuable auxiliaries to the sea
power of a nation. Furthermore, the
construction of such steamships insures
the maintenance in an efficient condition
ot tho shipyards in which our .battleships
must be built.
"The expenditure of public money for
the performance of such necessary func
tlons of government is certainly war
ranted, nor is it necessary to dwell upon
the incidental benefits to our foreign
commerce, to. the shipbuilding industry.
and to ahfp owning and navigation which
will accompany the discharge of these
urgent public duties, though they, too.
should nave wejgnt.
Asks Increase In Far
for Army Offlcers and Men,
The president, devotes much space to
the affairs of the army, and strongly
urges mat our regular military organl
zatlon be kept up to the highest possible
standard oi emcicncy, ana says:
"The medical corps should be much
greater than, the needs of our regular
army in war. xet at present it is small-
er than the needs of the service demand
even in peace. The Spanish' war oc
curred less than ten years ago. The
chief loss .we suffered in it was by dis
ease' among the' regiments which never
left ' tho country. 'At the moment the
I nation seemed dttnlr Improved T this
fact! yet seemingly It has already been
forgotten, for not tho slightest effort
has been made to prepare a medical
corps of sufficient slzo to prevent' tho
repetition of tho snmo disaster on a
much larger scale If wo should over be
engaged in n serious conflict.
"Hut tho medlcnl dennrtmont Is not the
only department for Vvhlch Incroased pro
vision should be mado. The rate of pay
for the 'officers should bo greatly In
creased; there Is no higher typo of citizen
than tho American regular officer, and he
should havo a fair reward for his ad
mirable work. There should be a rela
tively oven grcator Increase In the pay for
the enllstod men, An especial provision
should bo made for establishing grades
equivalent to those of warrant offlcers In
tho navy, which should bo opon to the
enlisted men who serve stifllclontly long
and who do their work well. Inducements
should bo offered sufllclont to encourage
really good men to make tho nrmy a life
occupation. Tho prlmo needs of our pres
ent nrmy Is to secure and retain compe
tent noncommissioned officers, This dlfll-
ulty rests fundamentally on tho ques
tion of pay. Tho noncommissioned officer
docs not correspond with nn unskilled la
borer; ho corresponds to the best typo of
sklllod workman ,(jr to tho subordinate
official In civil Institutions. Wages havo
greatly Increased in outsldo occupations
tn tho last 40 years and the pay of the
soldier, 111(0 the pay of tho officers, should
bo proportionately Incroased. Tho first
sergeant of a company, If a good man,
must bo ono of such executive nnd ad
ministrative ability, and Buch knowledge
ot his trade, as to be worth far moro than
wo at present pay him. Tho same Is true
of tho regimental scrgoant major. Theso
men should be men who had fully re
solved to mako tho army a Hfo occupa
tion and they should bo ablo to look for
ward to ample roward; while only men
properly qualified should bo given a
chnnco to secure these final rewards. The
Increase over tho present pay need not
bp great In the lower grndes for the first
oho or two enlistments, but tho Increase
should bo marked for tho noncommis
sioned offlcers of the upper grndos who
serve long onough to mako It ovldent that
they Intend to Btay permanently In the
army, whllo additional pay should bo
given for high quallllcatlons In target
practice.
Among tne omcors mere snouiu do
severe examinations to weed out tho
unfit up to tho grado of major. From
that position on appointments snouia
bo solely by selection and It should be
understood that n man of merely av
erago capacity could never get beyond
the position of major, whllo overy man
who serves in nny grado a certain
length of tlmo prior to promotion to
the next grado without getting the
promotion to tho next grade should be
forthwith retired."
President Sees Need of
Largely Incrensed Nnvy.
The president nsks for a continuous
Increase In the navy, and asks present
congress for appropriations tor iou-
now battleships, nnd says:
We need always to remember mat
in time of war tho navy Is not to be
used to defend harbors nnd son-coast
cities; we should perfect our system of
coast fortifications. The only efficient
use for tho navy Is for offense. Tho
only way In which It can efficiently pro
tect our own coast against tno possioie
action of a foreign navy Is by destroy
ing that foreign navy. For defonso
against a hosttlo fleet which actually
attacks them, tho coast cities must de
pend upon their forts, mines, torpedoes,
submarines and torpedo boats and de
stroyers. All of these together aro ef
ficient for defensive purposes, dui inoy
in no wnv suDnly tho place of a thor-.
a?ughly efficient navy capable of acting
on tne orccnsivo; ior parryius novsr jm.
won a fight. It can only bo won by
hard hltlng, and an aggressive sea-going
navy alono can do this hard hitting
of the offcnslvo type. But tho forts
and the like aro necessary so that tho
navy may bo footloose. In tlmo or war
there is sure to bo demand, under pres
sure of fright, for the ships to bo scat
tered so ns to defend ail kind ot ports.
Under penalty of terrible disaster, this
demand must bo rofused. Tho ships
must bo kept together, nnd their ob
jective made the enemies' fleet. "It
fortifications aro sufficiently strong, no
modern navy will venture to attnclc
them, so long as the foo has in exist
ence a hostile navy of anything Ilka
tho same size or efficiency. But unless
there exists such a navy then tho forti
fications aro powerless by themselves
to securo the victory. For of courso
the mere deficiency means that any
resolute enemy can at his leisure com
bine all his forces upon ono point with
the certainty that ho can take It.
Gives Reasons for Despatch
Of Fleet to the Pacific.
"Until our battle fleet Is much larger
than nt present it should never bo split
Into detachments so far apart that tlioy
could not In event of emergency be
speedily united. Our coast lino Is on
the Pacific Just as much as on tho At
lantic. The Interests of California,
Oregon and Washington aro as em
phatically the intorests of tho wholo
union as thoso of Malno and New York,
of Louisiana and Texas. Tho battle
fleet should now and then bo moved to
the Pacific, Just as at other times it
should be kept in the Atlantic. When
the Isthmian canal Is built tho transit
of the battle fleet from ono ocenn to
tho other will be comparatively easy.
Until it is built I earnestly hopo that
the battle fleet will be thus shifted be
tween the two oceans overy year or
two. The marksmanship on all our
ships has improved phenomenally dur-'
Ing the last five years. Until within
the last two or three years It was not
possible to train a battle fleet in squad
ron maneuvers under service conditions,
and It is only during these last tvo or
three years that the training under
these conditions has become really ef
fective. Another and most necessary
stride in advance is nowbein'g taken.
The battle fleet Is about starting by
the Straits of Magellan to visit the
Pacific coast. Sixteen battleships are
going under the command of Hear Ad
miral Evans, while eight armored
cruisers and two other battleships will
meet him at San FranclBco, whither
certain torpedo destroyors are also go
ing. No fleet ot such sizo has over,
made such a voyage, and it will be of
very great educational use to all en
gaged In it. The only way by which to.
teach offlcers and men how to handle
the fleet so as to meet every posslblo
strain and emergency in time ot war is
to have them practice under similar
conditions In time of peace. Moreover,
the only way to find out our actual
needs is to perform in .time of peace
whatever maneuvers might bo neces
sary in time of war. After war Is de
clared It. is too late to find .out .the
needs; that means to Invito disaster.
The trip to the Pacific will show what,
some of our needs are and will enablo
us to provide for them. The proper
placo for an officer to learn his duty
is at sea, and the only way in which a
navy, can ever be made efficient Is by
praottce at sea' under all the condi
tions which would have to be met it'
war existed."
