Mia Fmrn.— A failure on the part
of OH? upper mail to “come to time” is
much too Ordinary an occurrence to provoke
a paragraph from our pen. The thing ha*
become chronic, and we now no more ex
pect the time-table requirements of the
Poet Office Department to he regarded in ;
this locality than if no such silly regula
tions were in existence. But a fai’ure of
the upper mail to connect with our Pool
Office at all, as was the case on Wcdnca- :
day of last week, this we admit is some
thing unusual and ought to he of importance
enough to provoke inquiry, if nothing cite, '
to prevent tkia also from becoming ehron- j
te. The contractor for this route may
tell Mr. Creawell what he pleases, but we
stand to it, that there was no freshet or
whirlwind or tempest or explosion or ava
lanche or earthquake between this point
and Charlotte Flail on Wednesday of last
week and that the failure in question is
refers Lie to something els*.
Not Pi.XASXO.--It is as true now as in
the times of Undibras. that no thief ever
fell the halter draw with gosl opinion of
the law. That the Loyal leagues should
he displeased with the recent srtion of the
Anne Arundel farmers In this State is.
therefore, quite natural. The tiling, in i
fact, was to have been expected. The (
experience of mankind shows that pro
scription has no fiercer enemy than the
proscription!*! when it is himself and not 1
wmiic ether man who is “of the faction that
is wronged.” But is intolerance infilled !
to, or has it a right to expect toleration ?
To tolerate intolerance is to encourage and
connive at intolerance. Hence, it is the ,
duty of enlightened men to proscribe pro- 1
•cription and hence again it is the duty of
good men to proscribe the Loyal Leagues
in our midst. The head and front of the
Anne Arundel offending hath this extent, j
no more. It is a weak invention of the j
enemy, besides bring a falsehood, to as
sert that the Anne Arundel fanners have
proposed to proscribe laborers simpiv le
-eanse of their connection with secret so
cieties. If is not against such secret so
cieties as the Masonic Order, Sms of j
Temperance, Odd Fellows, etc , which 1
are known to be organised for charitable ,
or reformatory purposes, that the farmer* j
of Anne Arundel have sot their faces, but
against a sworn, secret, political, aggres
sive and proscriptive league, blind in its
following, foreign in its inspirations, men
acing to the public peace and waring upon
their best interest. This and this only is
the secret society the membership of which
the Anne Arundel jn'ople have denounced. !
Besides, what, after all, is the terrible
“burglary” that is threatened ? Only
this. If you continue your membership
*of the Ijoysl Leagues, we won’t employ !
you. We know you have been told, that
we can’t do without you. Possibly, wo
can’t. Certainly, we mean to try. Any
way, you have notice to quit, not leeausc
you are republicans, but because you per- 1
siat in continuing your membership of a I
secret, political, oath-bound organization 1
which we kelievo to be seditious and dan
gerous in character and know to be in con
spiracy against, and hostile to our best
interest. If this is burglary, make the
moat of it. This is aliout the sin and
substance of the Anne Arundel programme.
That the Baltimore Ameriatn should be
displeased with it is, of fours', to lie re
gretted. We suppose, however, it was
not constructed with a view of deserving
such distinguished approbation and that
very little solicitude was felt during its ,
incubation about what the .tmmVmi might I
think of it. Bo this as it may, and at
the risk of drawing the displeasure of the
Baltimore oracle of radicalism upon our
own county, we say with Mr. Burke’s friend
M Bristol, ditto, ditto, sir, to all that has
been spoken by the preceding speaker And I
further, we recommend the early forma
tion in our own county of just such an or- j
ganization as has been recently started on
the Severn.
Tua Prfsidrxt’s MxssAna.-JThe Pres
ident'a message was sent to Congress on i
Monday. We cannot undertake to-dav
to give more than a abort synopsis of its
contents. It is radical, of course, to the
core tad intensely protectionist. The
usual reference to “outrages” at the South
is made, reeooatruelion complimented snd
the payment of the public debt commend- *
cd. Tbs President suggests that the Coi
fed States shall buy up the Alabama claims
aad superintend their settlement with
Great Britain. “Oar depressed Com
merce” is wade the subject of a short ref
creßce, bat a panacea is promised at some
later period sf the session, “for this evil.”
The ftaaaeial policy of the government is
still, it seems, far from perfect and the
actioa of Congress Is invoked to make this
matter better. The revenue reform move
BMWt lads aa favor in the message nor
iadeed nay ether measure of se sibic re
form. Gnat is still Graal, a w<ak ves
00l that Camera sad scnrwr * are still
steering. {
The Inithtit* —lf the farmers of our
county really intend to forego hereafter
| the employment of sarh persons as are
i banded against them in Loyal Leagues
and refuse to gire them ap. it is high
| time, we think, that they should he looh
-1 ing to some source or other to supply the
deficiency which is likely to he produced
by this setion. It is not intended, we
presume, to refuse employment to parties
fortress rfiey hnrt foea members of these
League*, but only to employ other labor
in eases where parties persistently refuse
to abandon them. To estimate the num
ber of these m<diynant or to approximate
it, is now, of course, pure guess work, bat
it would be well enough for the fanner to
! be on the safe side snd make as liberal
j outlays for obtaining foreign labor as be
can afford. We have work and idle land
enough for the employment both of our
native and all the foreign labor we are
likely to obtain, and hence there is little
danger of crowding out either the labor
ers who have stood by us in the past or
j those who may honestly mean to stand by
us in the future. An initiative move to
procure new labo.* fur this eonnly we take
to be of prime necessity in view of the
j contingency stated above, and hence we
give below the resolutions adopted by the
Anne Arundel farmers ns an admonition
and a guide to our own people. Delegates
have already been selected to represent
our county in the International Immigrant
Convention which meets in Baltimore on
Tuesday next, the 13th of December, in
stant. What action the Convention may
recommend, cannot now be forecasted with
certainty, but as earnest, practical turn
are known to be at the head of it, we feel
(ourselves justified in asking quick and
concurrent action by our planters on such
! measures as it may think advisable to re
commend.
i Whrrrns, It is the opinion of this Con
vention that the w Ifare of the community
imperatively calls upon the farm rs of
Anne Arundel county to employ only such
laborers as are not combined secretly
against our interest and ignorantly against
j their own.
/.***,/< <./. That all law-abiding citizens,
who hate the good of this community at
heart, should d nounee by words ami acts
those leaders who have been instrumental
I in firming our pres nt labor* rs into? ert
I societies, and endeavoring to create a feel
j ing of eiuuit;. between our laborers and us,
! who are their natural protectors and
friends. Particularly should those trhi'e
Iradcrt be denounced, who have knowing
ly, for their own sinister ends, deceived
the igm rant dupes by promises and threats
which they knew could never be fulfilled,
for the purpose of riding into fat offices
: through their votes and their money col
j letted through the agcnces of secret socie
i ties.
Raul red, That for the purpose of sup
plying any demand for labor which may
arise in this connty, we urgently recom
mend the landholders of Arundle
County to form associations in each Flec
tion District, and to employ an agent for
| the priH'urcmeot of laborers.
Raul ml. That it is expedent that such
district associations bo organized without
delay, and we recommend that the agents
; employed by them be selected as delegates
1 from this county to the Ftate Labor Con
i vention which is to assemble in Baltimore
at 12 o’clock on Tuesday, the 13th of De
cember.
Rt-ulred, That wo earnestly recommend
J to the district associations that they cease
i to employ any laborers who remain in af
filation with the so-called leagues, and
, that they especially discountenance those
who have made themselves most conspic
• uous in such leagues.
Casualty From Firearms. — A black
man, named Edward Hopewell, aged
about 21 years, while gunning near the
residence of Janies Norris in Patuxent
district on Saturday last, was killed by
the premature explosion of Lis gun. The
circumstances as reported are, that the
cock of Hopewell’s gun. being caught by
some obstruction and pressed back while
he was crossing a fence, fell, exploding
the gun and lodging the contents in the
, left side. The unfortunate man lived only
a few seconds after the accident. Hope
well. wc learn, was formerly a slave of
James U. Thompson and bore a good char
acter. Another warning within a mouth
in regard to the careless handling of fire
arms.
Or it Circuit Cm ar—The December
Term of our Circuit Court commenced on
! Monday last, but no business was transac
ted on that day in consequence of the ab
j senee of His Honor, Judge Ford, who
! had been detained in Charles by his judi
i cial duties. Ou Tuesday, His Honor was
on the bench and the bu-iiu ss of the term
was commenced and is progressing as we
write. No case of general interest has
occupied the attention of the Court up to
this writing. His Him. Judge Magruder
arrived on Tuesday evening and was on
1 the bench on Wednesday. It is thought
that the present session of the Court will
not extend bey*nd to day.

Chapel on Sunday, the ISth of December,
instant. immediately after mass. Refresh
ments will be provided fw the occasion.
As the pr weeds of the Concert are to be

Tux Maryland Farmer, rou 1871.—The De

" ork for the Month, many articles of interest
on Agriculture, Horticulture, Live Stock, Poul
try, Dairy, Apiary, Vineyard, Floriculture. I'se
ful and Domestic Recipes, Ac., Ac. The Mary

ces in January next, when its typography will
be greatly iiuprunj, ud its columns refreshed
from the pens of many of our mVst experienced
farmers and planters, who have volunteered as
contributors to its columns for the year 1871.
This old favorite is the only magazine devoted
to agriculture and its kindred sciences, now pub

This table is instructive. We learn
| from it where political power is ebbing
away, and whither the currents are drift
i ing ami the tide rfting.
The New England States will lose six
members of Congress under the new ap- i
portion men*. Tiny have twenty-seven j
, now. and will then be entitled to only \
twenty-one. As three of these States, I
however, have pretty large fractions. New
England may perhaps get twenty-two.
The old Middle States of New York, j
, i New Jersey. Pennsylvania, and Ohio lose i
live members. It will be noted that while |
New York loses three, Pennsylvania keeps
up to her present number. Thisdepreci- t
ation of Now York, as compared with
j Pennsylvania, is due somewhat to the fact
i that a considerable body of the business
men of New York city reside in New Jer- j
scy and Connecticut.
The sixteen former slaveholding States
gain four members. This is owing to t! c
i circumstance that all the colored popula- |
. tion of those Stales is now included in the
basis of representation, whereas, when the
present number of members of Congress
was fixed, only three-tilths of the slaves
were reckoned. On the other hand."as
to (he twenty-one free States, though a
part of them gain seven members, certain
others lose eleven, making a net loss of
four.
* trabiae Northwestern States, com
mencing with Indiana, but not crossing
the Rocky Mountains, gain nine motnb<‘rs.
It is in this section of the I’nion that there
has been the largest advance of population
since 1860. Kadi of those nine States in
■ j creases its representation, except Indiana
and Nebraska, which hold their own.
The fourteen States lying in the valley
of the Mississippi, and along the tributa
ries of that river, gain six members.
Tbe three States beyond the Rocky
Mountains—Nevada. California, and Or- j
cgnn —neither gain n-w b>sc, but maintain
their present representations of five mem- ;
hr, thus proving that that remote sec- j
tion of the i'niou kec,* up with the aver- \
j ago growth of the other sections
The sixt.cn Atlantic states lose eight i
| members, while the twenty-one Western
i and Southwestern States gain seven.— j
1 , South Carolina is the only State of the ;
• former class which gains, she obtaining j
one additional member because of the large i
■ number of her population set free under j
; the Thirteenth Amendment. Ohio is the
;' only State of the latter class whose rep
; resoutatiou falls off, she losing two mom- i
bers.
The old fourteen States which carried
the country through the Revolutionary
i War wilUtave eight members less under
the census of this present year than were
. allotted to them under that of 1860.
i i These eight members will now be assign
i ed to States which have entered the Cniou
.! since the close of the struggle for indc
-1 | pendenec.
Of course it will be understood that the
, States whose members of Congress will lx* 1
.; now diminished have not necessarily de
., creased in population during the past ten
years, but only that their increase has not !
kept up with that of the other States
Indeed, only two States show a positive
falling off from the census of 18*30. name-
Iv, New Hampshire, which loses 11,000,
and Virginia. which exhibits a dwsr
r ! of 10,000; while the aggregate of the in
crease in the whole Union during that pe
riod will be abmt eight millions, earry
-1 tug the sum total np to nearly or quite
1 ; fortv millions.
1 fhese statistics show that within the !
past ten years, as in the previous thirty,
‘ i the course of empire in the Republic is
; steadily westward, or rather toward the
j great central valley of the continent.—
I However, because of the abolition of slave
. ry it will doubtless be deflected somewhat
r to tbe southward during the next decade.
