TIIK KKLATIO.NS 111-' CAPITAL TO I.AllOlt.
It is the effort lo place capital on an
equal fooling with, if not above labor, in ,

From the first taking of our national
census to the last are seventy years, and
we find our population at the end of that
period eight times as great as it was at
the beginning. Ihe increase of lliose

has been even greater. We thus have
at one view what the popular principle
applied lo government through the mn

produced ina given time, and also what,
if firmly maintained, it promises for the
future. There are among us those who,
if the Union be preserved, will live to

PICKETING.
While on my lonely bent, about an
hour ago, a light tread attracted my
attention, and on looking up, I beheld
one of Sueesh's pickets standing before
me.
Stranger," says he, "you remind me
of grandmother, who expired before I
was born ; but this unnatural war has
made us enemies, and I must sho3t you.
Give me a chaw ter backer."
lie was a young man, my boy, in the
prime of life, and descended from the
First Families of Virginia. That is to
say, his mother was a virgin. At h ast,
that is what I understand by the First
Families of Virginia.
I looked at him, and says I
' Let's compromise, my brother."
" Never," says he, "the South is fight
ing (or her liberty, her firesides, and the
pursuit of happiness, and I desire most
respectfully lo welcome you wilh bloody
hands lo a hospitable grave."
" Stand ten paces off," says I. "and
let's see whose name shall come before
the coroner first."
He took his place, and we fired simul
taneously. 1 heard a ball go whistling
by a barn abuiit a quarter of a mile on
my right ; and when the smoke ch ared
away I saw the Secesh picket approach
me with an awful expression of woe on
his otherwise dirty countenance.
" Soldier," said he, " was there any
thing in my head before you fired ?"
" Nothing," says I "save a few harm
less insects."
"1 speak not of them," says he, "was
there anything inside of my head?"
" Nothing," says I.
" Well," says he, "just listen uow."
He shook his head mournfully, and 1
heard something rattle in it.
"What is that?" I exclaimed.
"Tint," said he, "is your bullet, which
has penetrated my skull, and is rolling
around in my brain. I die happy and I
with an empty slomuch, but there is one j
thing I should like lo see before 1 perish
lor my country. Have you a quarter
about you ?"
Too much affected to speak, I drew
the coin from my pocket and handed it
to him. The dying man clutched it con
vulsively, and stared at it feverishly.
"This," said he, "is the first quarter I
have seen since the fall of Sumter, and
had I wounded you I should have been
totally unablo lo have given you any
quarter. Ah! how beautilul it is! how
bright, how exquisite, and good for four
drinks! Hut I have not time to say all I
feel."
The expiring 6oldier then laid down
his gun, hung his cap and overcoat on a
branch of a tree, and blew bis nose. He
then died.
And there I stood, my boy, on that
lonely beat, looking down upon that lallen
type of manhood, and thinking bow
singular it was he bad forgotten to give
me back my quarter. The sight and the
thought so affected me that I was obliged
to turn my back on the corpse, and
walked a little way from it. When I
relumed to the spot the body was gone !
Had it gone to heaven ? Perhaps so, my
boy perhaps so, but I haven't seen my
quarter since."
The Charleston Mercury thinks
'the next two months will determine de
j finitely (he question of a long or short
; war. Within that time the ability of the
north to invade and overrun the south
J be decided, while the development
,0f (lie cotton famine abroad will bring to
a crisis the question whether the block-1
lade shall be respected by foreign nations.

We have received Walton's Register for

county courts, besides being full of other
valuable information.
Frusioknt's Mess.ie. We publish
this week entire Ihe president's message,
to the exclusion of intich other interest

clination (o comment upon it further than
to say that it is a plain document und

what he means in ihe shortest possible
manner nnd leaves to congress and to
the country the privilege of saying much
they do not mean, which Heaven grant
we may have little of.
We also publish a liberal portion of
Ihe report of die Sectetary of War. It
is a very interesting stale paper. His
views in regard to the use to be made of
slaves during the war are not his own.
They sire the president's. The secretary
is more radical and sweeping in his no

confidence of (he school mid the general

seldom seen so much progress in so many
different studies, in eleven weeks, as in
this school. The. whole numder of schol
ars was filly, twenty of whom were young
men. The average age of the scholars
may be put down at about sixteen, we
think.
The class of teachers numbered sixteen,
several of whom are already employed
for the winter schools in Ibis vicinity.
All the classes examined gave evidence
of thorough instruction and commendable
progress. The grammar class was cer
tainly rrpial, if not superior to any which
we have met in this state.
We are glad lo learn that Mr. Camp
has been engaged to teach the winter

Mr. Editor: By your permission I

through the columns of your paper, for
thus I can write them all at once, which
will be a great saving of time when close

When the treason, which has for many
years been growing and threatening the
usurpation of our country's dearest in
terests, became unmasked, when the little
handful of brave men holding Fort Sum
ter were bombarded by an overwhelming
force of shameless (rai'ors, in a manner
w hich for inhumanity and cruelty, would
put to shame the barbarous customs of
the ancient Gauls, the cry of " lo arms,"
rang through the whole free North, re
verberated across Ihe continent to the
Pacific coast, and re-echoed back over
the prairies of the West to the eastern
shores, and was there caught up and

least, in restoring liberty to her throne;
and the love of country that inspired us

ticularly the new ones. In the 3d the
sick list is much smaller than it was, even
when we came here, and only seven, I

Oth, there now are on the sick list two
hundred and fifty soldiers. Eleven have
gone to their long homes. " Peace to
their ashes." The last one who died
belonged to our company, D. He was
Charles Santan, of Westfield, the first
from our number. It was imposed on
me to see to the digging of his grave, and
with three privates I went and did the
sad task. That duty was new to roe, yet
a soldier can dig a soldier's grave. The
muffled drum beat the mournful dirge as
his fellow soldiers followed bis remains
to their Virginia grave. Only a soldier's
tear was shed.
The disease now seems to be mostly
fevers, thoi'gh the first sickness in our
regiment was measles. Of that there
has been nearly three hundred cases. It
is evident, from the experience of oilier
regiments, that as we become more accli
mated we shall be mjre healthy. Very
many of ihe soldiers, and of that number
include me, the climate of "Dixie" agrees
with first rate.
As regards clothing, we have that
which is good and abundant. Tents are
cood. save those of the 3d. Their old
: Th ;ndeed need
new ones.
The habits of the soldiers are almost
as numerous as the soldiers themselves,
' though w hen on duty we are in one sense
alike, yet the leisure time is passed in
almost every way, some by reading the
bible, some wrhing, some reading the
President's message, Gen. Jim Lane's
speech, &c., some loitering around, sume
playing cards, Jcc Drunkenness is
nearly exempt. I have seen but one
man worse for liquor since coming into
camp, and thanks be to God for it.
As yet, during our six week in Vir
ginia, nothing excitio g or of much impor
tance has occurred in camp j but the
keen desires of the Vermont boys are
that we may be led on to battle, meet (be
accursed traitors to our country, and
illustrate to them that the same spirit
which demanded Fort Ti in the name of
the great Jehovah and the Continental
Congress, is to-day as powerful as then.
This restlessness is observed by our supe
rior officers, and it led Gen. Brooki a
little while ago to this remark : "Let the
Vermont boys loose and in less than three
days they would be in Richmond trying
to buy milk." The remark might have
been occasioned, however, by the fact that
the Vermonters, not being weaned from
bread and milk, do quite often bring in
from picket their canteens full of milk
borrowed from some cow.
Fkidat. Alas! since writing the
above, another of our company, Edson
Fairbrother, son of Thomas Fairhrother
of Barton Landing, has died, and I record
ihe sad intelligence. His father reached
his bedside only in time to see him die.
He had hope in the blessed Savior of (be
world.
A little more, and I will close. This
day is as warm and beautiful, almost, as
midsummer, though the nights are cold
and the ground freezes. Each Sabbath,
all who will attend service upon the pa
rade ground. As to friendship among
the Vermont troops, there exists, as there
should, kind and brotherly feelings, al
though between some of the 2d and 3d
there has grown a kind of enmity, be
cause the 2d (bought Gen. Smith treated
the 3d with partiality, and that they far
ed better as to clothes, Ice, than the 2d.
As to the truth of it, I know not. From
this the 3d have got ihe name of Smith's
pets, and the feeling a short lime since
was thus demonstrated : One from ei
ther regiment met, when the 2d says to
the 3d, " What are Smith's pets doing
(hese days?" " They are not retreating
from Bull Kuo," was the sarcastic reply.
The prospect of making advance at
present is doubtful. WTe shall probably
winter where we are. Preparations to
that effect are already being made.
Enough. Kindest regards to all my
Glover friends, and Orleans county gen
erally. Yours truly,

A. A. Earle, Esq. Dear Sir:
Yours of Nov. 18th ii received, and I
take this opportunity to answer the same.
There is not much news to write, every
thing remaining quiet along the Potomac.
Thanksgiving day has passed, and I will
give you a history of itwhat we bad
for supper, &c. For supper yesterday,
we had an oyster stew prepared by our
cook, Curtis P. Bean, of your town, who
always des things up brown for the'
company. The oysters went well, and
the boys seemed to enjoy the supper as
well as though they were at home in old
Vermont. But this did not end the
Thanksgiving. A number of the Co.
were out on picket, and they, too, must
enjoy the good things ; so our most noble
Captain bought a pair of turkeys and a
goose, and to-day, to our great pleasure,
we stripped their bones of what meat
bung to them, and everything parsed off
as well as (hough we were at our own
tables at home. Of course, none of this
was done a t Uncle Sam's expense. We
chose to provide for ourselves, as long us
he had done it well for us so long.
The health of our Company is grow
ing better every day. There are but
few sick now, compared wilh the number
one month ago. Those in general hos
pital now are Charles Garvin, John W.
Ellsworth, and William II. Willey.
Those in regimental hospital arc J. P.
Gage, II. G. Beaman, and H. II. Moul
ton, all improving except Moulton. He
has the typhoid fever, and is very sick.
Beside these, there are a few other who
are excused from drill, but remain in
camp, and are able to take care of them
selves. Of this number there is corporal
Geo. II. Edwards, A. B. Chamberlin,
und corporal Dana P. Sawyer. Lieu
tenant John II. Coburn has sent his res
ignation, and has been discharged. He
was very nigniy esieemeu oy every
member of the company, every one Lop
ing he would be able to return and re
sume his duties as Lieutenant again. It
will be bard to get a lieutenant that every
one will respect as much as they did him.
There has been several promotions in
our company since we left Cantp Baxter.
Privates Geo. II. Edwards, Loren J.
Flood, Frank Latnore, Jr., and Charles
Blood, to corporals. Corporals Stephen
W. Jenkins, and John S. Thompson, to
sergeants.
Alonzo Page, who belonged to our
company, but lately joined an artillery
company, has been promoted lo corporal
in said company.
In relation to the clothing of this reg
iment I w ill say we have all received the
new army uniform. The regiment is
well clothed for winter, which whispered
lo us, ''I am coming," when we arose
last Tur-day morning the ground being
covered with snow. This some of (he
Vermonters did not expect to ee in the
land of secesh quite as early as this.
j Our old tents remain w ith us yet, but we
heard a whisper from the old Green
i t '
! Mountain slate, saying "Vermont 3d,
j you shall not suffer for tents much long
Jer." This will cheer up the drooping
spirits of many a soldier, and save many
I a one from an untimely grave. We
j have had much sickness in our regiment,
; but have bad but very few deaths, cotn
I pared with what the other Vermont reg
i imrnts have had, except the 2nd. We
have lost ten men. This includes the
i two killed in the skirmish at Lewinsville,
and the one of Company I, who cut his
throat nt Camp Advance. Either the
4th or '.til have lost more than doubie
the number by sickness that our regt.
has. The Cth have lost nearly the same
number that we have, and have not been
here one quarter the time. The health
of the 2nd, I guess has been as good, if
not belter than ours. From this any
one would suppose that the warm part of
the season was the best time to come here
from the Eastern Slates, but I always
supposed tbe cool part the best. I think
our regiment has done more for tbe pro
tection of their health than any other I
have seen, i.e. in making beds up from
the ground, keeping their clothing well
aired, and always having clean and neat
tents. We have often received the high
est praise from our staff officers for doing
these things so well.
By your paper, which we gladly re
ceive every week, we see you get the
news from all parts of the Union nearly
as quick as we do. The taking of Ma
son and Slidell, by Capt. Wilkes, was
received with the greatest joy. Would
to God it had been Davis and Stephens ;
but sooner or later they, too, will be in
tbe same fix. Secession must coma
down, and that, too, ere long.
They will soon be surrounded, not a
place left to escape through. Even to
South Carolina, where secesh " 19 rst
started, and where our noble emblem of
freedom first received its insults, there
the emblem again waves, and it will soon
in many places, where it has been tram
pled under foot by those despUers ol
freedom. Yours truly,
T. Abel Cbaei
