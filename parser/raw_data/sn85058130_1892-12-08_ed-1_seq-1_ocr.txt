MONEY CONFERENG
Kothschiids Plan Will Continue
to be Discussed
FAILURE MAY YET BE AVERTED
Th President of the Conference 1 Opposed
to DIscufSlns the American Plan
Attitude ol the French Delegates
BRUSSELS Dee 7An important section
of the international monetary conference
holds that Rothschilds withdrawal of his
plan does not debar further dissuasion by
the conference the committee to which
the plan was referred having presented it
lor consideration of the conference thus
taking it out of Rothschilds hand Today
Samctellette the Belgian delegato who
supports the Rothschild plan with the
Moritz Levy amendment substituting sil
ve > < or small gold coins will hold a con
Jeri co with Sir C Fremantlo deputy
master tff the British mint and Toca the
Spanish delegate on putting an amend
ment on the Rothschild plan to a vote of
the conference Both Toca and Same
tellctto hold that a failure of the confer
once can yet be averted by a majority of
delegates recommending either the Levy
project or tho amended Rothschild plan
The scheme proposed by Teitjen Danisb
delegate is treated with indifference It
may be dropped without discussion by the
conference The proposals advanced by
Sir C Houldsworth though applauded by
pronounced bimetallist delegates yester
day is not considered by his colleagues
worth wasting time over in the discussion
wastng tme
1 His plan will pro badly be referred to the
committee tomorrow and not be heard of
ueain The uncertain attitude of the
French delegates is influencing other
representatives whose countries belong to
ttif Latin union
There has been a cause for complaint
that other members desirous of franK op
position to or cooperation in Rothschilds
plan communicated these proposals to the
French delegates before they were submit
ted to the conference and were led to be
lieve the French delegates would support
the plan Had they believed otherwise
they would have reconsidered the question
of presenting a plan It is tno opinion of
many delegates that the French govern
ment does not desire the conference to de
cide anything
An interview has been published here
with Leon Say well known French finan
cier which says that he declared that he
thought the attitude of both English and
Amerjcan delegates deplorable especially
t the Americans wno appeared to be
without definite proposals Say could not
understand why the British as practical
business men vanted the assistance of
France in a matter which was their own
concern ID regard to the Rothschild pro
posals he declared ho thought they solved
nothing and added that he thoughtthe de
liberations of the conference would end in
nothing Says remarks deono the action
of the French delegates who cruiciso
everything in the conference or in com
mittee but suggest nothing
Opinions among delegates have become
more clearly defined par tisane of the smgio
and double standards proving more irre
concilable as tho discussion develops
Henry W Cannon of the American dele
gates has asked the committee to discuss
the proposals of the American delegates
as stated to the plenary conference
Montefiore Levi president of the confer
ence opposes the committees proceeding
to discuss the American proposals The
basis of his objections is on the ground that
the committee was appointed to discuss
the special question on reference from the
conference that the American proposals
are related to fundamental principles that
would better come within the competence
of the conference A majority of the com
mittee concur in the opinion of Levi
Hon E Terrell American minister to
Belgium will give a banquet in honor of
tho delegates tomorrow The grand muni
cipal reception at the Hotel De Vile has
been fixed for Dee 16 This will wind up
the fetes in honor of the delegates until
after Cbristaas
Benjamin Andrew of the American dele
gation and J M Gerasevaa of Nether
lands will speak in favor of the American
plan when it is discussed tomorrow Presi
dent Levy has received a communication
from Mr Allan member of the institute
of civil engineers who had much experi
ence in India suggesting that silver pro
ducing countries agree each to impose a
JJscal duty on all silver exported except
their own silver coins the duty being on a
Eliding scale equal to the difference in
value of the market price in silver and an
an international minimum value less a
hand percentage on coinage No silver
thus exported being under standard min
imum value but to be free to command ex
chancre in its favor This proposal it is
expected will be discussed by the com
mittee but it is doubtful i it be seriously
entertained in view of the fact that Mexico
and other silver producing countries have
clearly explained that they cannot agree to
any restrictions of the silver industry

SATOLLlS ADDRESS
Delivered at the Recent Meeting
of Archbishops
Three Plans Submitted on the School Ques
tion Which Were Thoroughly
Considered
ST Louis Dee Following is a synop
sls of the address M Satolll delivered at
the recent meeting of archbishops in New
York on the subject of settling the school
question and having religious education
On the Cathoho church is vested the di
vine right of instructions of the young in
as far as theirs is the kingdom of heaven
Hence absolutely and universally speak
ing there is no repugnance to the young
learing the first elements and higher
branches in the public schools controlled
by the state For the rest the provisions
of the council of Baltimore are yet in force
and in a general way will remain so
United with the duty of procuring truly
Christian and Catholic education for their
offspring are the rights of parents which
no civil law or authority can violate or
weaken The Catholic church in general
and especially the holy see desires that by
the joint act of civil and ecclesiastical au
thorities there should be a public school in
every state but the Catholic church
shrinks from those features in the public
schools which are opposed to the truth of
Christianity
Long since the holy see decreed that
parish schools and other institutions under
the direction of bishops were opportune
ana necessary from the fact it held for cer
tain public schools bore within themselves
approximate danger the faith and morals
because purely secular education was given
and because teachers were chosen indis
criminately from sects and no law prevents
them tom working ruin to the youth
Likewise certain corruption seems to im
pede from the fact that children of both
sexes were brought together In the sumo
room for lessons Wherefore i it be
clear in given locality that above named
dangers disappear then it is law
ful for Catholic paranja to send
their children to these schools provided the
parents themselves do not neglect their I
1 most serious duty and pastors put forth
I every effort and instruct children and train
I them in all that pertains to to Catholic
I worship and life I will be well therefore
to establish weekly classes in catechism
which all children in the parish should at
tend It is greatly to bo desired and will
be a most happy arrangement i the bish
ops agree with the civil authorities or with
members of the school board to conduct
their schools with mutual attention and
duo consideration for their respective
rights
datolli then quoted the popes letter on
the subject to the Archbishop of New York
and to the bishops of the province The
adaption of one of the three plans was re
commended the choice to be made accord
ing to local circumstances in the different
i states and various personal relations The
first consist in an agreement between
bishops and members of the school board
I whereby they allow Catholic children to
assemble during free time and be taught
I the catechism Second to have a catechism
class outside a public building and also
I classes of higher Christian doctrine The
third plan is bound up more intimately
with the duty of both parents and pastors
I Pastors should unceasingly urge upon
parents the most important duty in bring
ing up children in sound morality and
Catholic faith Let the pastor have classes
of children in tho parish nor let him show
less love for children that attend public
II schools than those that attend parochial
On the contrary stronger marks of loving
i solicitude are to be shown them For
the standing and growth of Catholic
schools it seems care should be taken that
teachers proved themselves qualified not
only by previous examination before a I
diocesean board but also by having teach
ers diploma from tho school board of the
state For the sake of the Catholic canto
let there be among laymen t growing
j rivalry to tale a diploma so that in pos
I sessed knowledge and qualifications re
t quired for teaching tbey may compete for
I and honorably obtain positions in public
gymnasia lyceums and scientific institu
1 tions The above was thoroughly consid i
I ered at the meeting of the archbishops

Dr Birch Concludes Ills Argument on the
Fifth Charge
NEW YOKE Dec 7Doctor Birch re
sumed the reading of his argument in the
I Briggs case today the fifth charge being
taken up In this Briggs is cccased of
I
teaching that Moses is not the tnt lor of
Pentateuch which teaching is contrary to
the essential doctrines of the standard
I church A formidable array of scripture
edicts was adduced in the printed charges
to show the falsity of Briggs theory
Doctor Birch said the only authority on
I the authorship of the Pentateuch was the
Bible itself I Moses did not write the
Pentateuch said he no Jew can be blamed
I for rejecting Christ I Moses did not
write the Pentateuch Christ himself is
dishonest

took up the cudgel and announced his in
tention to prove heresy of the theories
Briggs expounded in the inaugural address

Christianity He had not concluded when

WASHINGTON Dec 7The annual re
port of the Secretary of the Treasury Pos
ter shows that the government revenues
from all sources during the past fiscal year
were 25865260 expenditures 415953 l
SOG leaving a surplus of 89914453 with
the cash balance national bank redemption
fund and a few small items added a sur
plus of 40750463 which was applied to
the payment of the public debt and na
tional bank notes
Compared with the fiscal year of 1891
the receipts have fallen off 533075972 tho
principal losses being customs receipts
42069 41 and in the profits on coinage of
55631479 On the other hand there was
a gain of 4998670 in internal revenue re
ceipts 5 41274 in the sales of District of
Columbia bonds and other matters which
male up the difference Interest on the
public debt decreased 14169019
For the present fiscal year the revenues
are estimated as follows

Total 5431330350
Leaving the estimated surplus for the
year 2000000 The available cash balance
in the treasury at the end of the fiscal
year was 120992b73 Revenues for tha
fiscal year of 1894 are estimatoa at490l21
305 and the appropriations required 457
201W5 exclusive of the sinking fund the
estimated surplus wU be 82860030 which
with the cash balance above the gold i
reserve would make the availaole balance
53852407 Denuding accrueing obliga
tions would leave 47853407 Chargeaole
against this are the unexpended river and
harbor and ordinance appropriations of
4400OUO and no account is taken of sink
ing fund requirements amounting to 318
600000 beyond the redemption estimated
at 5000000
The secretary says the estimated receipts
are on the basis of conditions prevailing
prior to the late election Public opinion
moving decreed a change of policy in the
tarif laws and aLtered the conditions ren
der it impossible now to estimate the
annual income with any degree of accuracy
and impossiole to predict the effect pro
posed in the radical changes on future
revenues but the inevitable result ol
tariff reduction agitation will be a falling
oil in importations and revenue He says
the facts fully justify the opinion that the
large increase in receipYsAJacribed to the
marvellous prosperity of the country under
the present revenue system would i con
tinued enable the department during the
coming fiscal year to meet obligations
without an impairment of its cash and
thereafter continue to show a material
improvement in condition The sinking
fund shows S9905106S1 more than is re
quired by law credited to it
He recommends a repeal of the act of
1881 authorizing the application of surplus
money to the purchase of United States
bonds in view of the large decrease in the
national debt and probable future condi
tion of finances The treasury has diffi
culty with the limited amount of cash on
band above the 100000000 redemption
fund to keep a sufficient stock of gold and
i shipments continue as large as during
the past two years the gold in thb treasury
will be diminished below the resorve line I
The maintenance of silver at par has also
increased a possible charge upon the gold
reserve The secretary therefore sugeests
I that the redemption of government obliga
tions should be increased to at least 20 per
t of the amount of treasury notes is
sued or to be issued under the act of July
14 1890
In view of the probable falling off in re
ceipts he thinks the revenue should be
increased to enable the treasury to main
tain a gold reserve of not less than 125
000000 He suggests an additional tax on
whisky as an easy method of increasing the
revenue He say that whatever may be
tho outcome of the international money
conference it will give a clearer idea of the I
views and purposes of the countries repre
sented In passing the secretary says a I
good word for reciprocity On th subject
of customs ho recommends the abolition of
I fees and the establishment of a fixed salary
for collectors and surveyors a consolida
tion of customs districts and endowing the
secretary with power to abolish districts and
discontinue minor ports A reversion and
modification of tho customs and navigation
lawn and recommends the appointment of
u commission for that purpose
Ho gives statistics of American com
merce and American ships and suggests a
continuance of the policy of encouraging
American ship building against subsidized
foreign ships with an ultimate view of
their use a naval auxiliaries The secre
tary recommends a change in the methods
of disbursing public moneys and the Battle
ment of public accounts by putting the en
tire matter of control and audit under the
direction of a comptroller general of the
ohief comptroller of the treasury at the
head of the board of office
Speaking of immigration the secretary
is clearly of the opinion that only by a
rigid examination made at the place of de
parture was the prohibitive features of tho
law executed with any considerable degree
of efficiency The remedy for the evils of
immigration the secretary says is within
the control of Congress He recommonds
an increase of the bead tax add as a meas
ure to determine what this tax should be
bo suggests that the sum should be such as
to equalize the cost to immigrants to reach
South America or Australia
Speaking of Chinese exclusion the secre
tary says notwithstanding the severity of
the law many Chinese get into this country
chiefly through Canada Ho thinks it
probable tbat a large numberof Chinese
laborers will enter the United States under
the provisions of the law for the admission
of Chinese exhibitors at tho Worlds Fair
and their employees
The secretory renews tho recommenda
tion in his last annual report that early
action be taken by congress toward suoh
legislation as will make the use of the
metric system of weights and measures
obligatory in transactions at customs
houses on and after Jan 1 1895
On the subject of seal fisheries ho says
the number of seals on the breeding
grounds on the island are found to bo
smaller this year than last
The secretary calls attention to the ac
tivity the marino hospital bureau has
shown the past summer and fall in the
threatened invasion of cholera I is pro
posed to keep in force the twenty day re
striction until Congress shall have had
an opportunity to express their will in the
matter or until the danger which
prompted it has disappeared Where

On the subject of quarantine the secre
tary says state laws cannot properly con
I trol or direct the management of great
quarantines when other states are inter
ested the whole country should have
a voice in their ownership and
management and this can only
be accomplished by such legislative
action as will forbid the collection of quar
ant ne fees by state or municipal authority
and which shall direct assumption of all
Quarantine duties by the United States
The most serious epidemic this countryhns
ever known can be traced to immigrants
and i must be apparent that the same au
thority that controls immigration should
control quarantine Admitting that par
ticular local quarantine may be perfectly
managed of what avail is it if another
neighboring post has either lax or insuffi
cleat quarantine or none at all

Indians in the Indian Territory for taking

I i DEEP WATER HARBOR
San Pedro Bay in the Pacific Selected as a
Sie
WASHINGTON Dec 7The report of the
board of army engineer officers to make eJ
ammatlon of the relative merits of San
Pedro and Santa Monica bays as a site for
1 proposed deep water harbor on the Pacific
slope was today submitted to Congress
The board reports a unanimous opinion for
the location selected by the bonrd of en
gineers of 1S90 at the present anchorage
at the westerly side of San Pedro bay I
under Point Fermin as a more eligible
location for such harbor in depth width
and capacity to accommodate the largest I
vessels and the commercial and naval
necessities of the country
The report of the board estimates the
cost of tho proposed deep water harbor at
San Pedro at 2Si > 5324 In considering
the relative advantages of the locations
suggested the board says the proposed
harbor should not be primarily a port of
refuge but a port of commerce The ob
ject it says is to provide a tino harbor
for the foreign trade which will become
of great importance and the coasting trade
is a matter of secondary importance from
a national view The capacity of the har I
bor for defense is a matter ot the highest I
moment since an indefensible port is
simply an invitation to attack in time of
war We have now too many such ports
and it is not desirable to increase the num

Contrasting the harbor of San Pedro
and Santa Monica it says the deep water
entrance to San Pedro is one and onehalf

from hidden dangers but in the San Pedro
harbor there is a rock covered by eighteen
feet of water This rock is not in the line
of vessels and is not considered 1 serious
danger but its removal is regarded as de
sirable Its sailing distance from trans
Pacific ports is practically the same As

THE DEACON CASE
1
The Appeal for an Absolute Di
vorce Gomes up Today
Gladys the Little Daughter Is Still Secreted
from tIe Father The Abelllo Family
Ilelpmg Mrs Deacon
Aix France Dec SpecialThc
appeal of Edward Parker Deacon for an
absolute divorce comes up in the court to
morrow and in view of the victory
achieved by Mrs Deacon in the court of
appeals the action of her attorneys is I
looked forward to with unusual interest
The large influence of the Abeillo family is
used in every direction for Mrs Deacon
and they will do everything to save her
from tho consoquonces of the action her
husband has brought against her for the
criminal relations with Abeille Should
Mrs Deacon be found guilty of this charge
she would be liable to imprisonment or
fine or both
With reference to the charge against
Mr Deacon that he subsidized certain
journals current rumor has it that the
Abeillo family spent 30003 francs to ob
tain Mr Deacons conviction and that of
this sum 120000 francs wera spent in se
curing articles hostile to him to be pub
lished in French newspapers
Mr Deacons lawyer Maitre Clunot
the highest authority in Franca on inter
national law proved to the court that
French tribunals have no jurisdiction over
foreigners in divorce cases unless both
parties to the suit consent to submit to the
French law The judges of the tribunal of
the Seine admitted the correctness of this
contention and volunteered to give Mr
Deacon the custody of all tbe children if
be so desired
This done the judge read Mrs Deacon a
lesson on propriety which made her so
angry that she ran out of court without hear
ing the end of it She at once proceeded
to the convent of Our Lady of the Assump
tion and abducted her eldest daughter
Gladys and has thus far managed to se
rete her from Mr Deacon She appealed
to the first chamber of the court of appeal
against tho decision of the tribunal of the
Seine and her side of the case was ably
presented by Maitre Barboux
It is supposed that she will now obey the
order of tbe court and replace the child in
the Convent of Our Lady of the Assump
tion The judgment of the first chamber of
the court of appeals remains in forca until
judgment is pronounced on Mr Deacons
application for divorce
HARRISONS MESSAGE
The View Taken by the London News
Papers
LONDON Dec 7The Times says Har
rison ascribes the drain of gold from
America to political movements in Europe
By many Republican leaders however
nothing of the kind is required to explain
tho phenomenon whoa everybody ac
quainted with the first principles of cur
rency legislation could predict with abso
lute confidence when America first under
took to control the market Harrison ap
pears to be entirely unconscious of the
monetary conference failure He talks
about delay in compelling other nations to I
change their coinage What a hopeless j
tangle of misconceptions is thus revealed
surely the existence of millions of dollars
in the vaults of the American treasury
which nothing could induce the world to
employ ought to restrain even the retiring
president from talking this egregious non I
sense America may reverse her policy
but the world will long suffer from its ef j
fects A revision to a sound policy may I t
disturb the silver market as the inevitable
result of blundering legislation but will I
pave the way to a healther state of af
fairs
The Standard says Not every one is
privileged to vent his spleen in the form
of a state paper Harrisons message is
not meant to be grevious neither is it
impressive like the epistle of a rejected
lover sincerely trusting she will not rue
bitterly the preference accorded to one
unworthy of her protection The warning
to Canada is polite compared with the
threat once hurled at Chi but had tie
flavor nevertheless There Is unwelcome
favor
ambiguity in the reference to the Behring
sea matter but it matters little what he
says as Ichabod is written in every sen
tence
The Chronicle says Harrisons tariff
remarks reminds one of the school boy
maxim I you tell 0 lie tell a big un
and stick to it I may now be regarded
as certain that America will make the
Nicaragua canal and thus prevent France
from reviving the Panama scheme
The Daily Telegraph commenting on the
message refers to the programme of the
British agricultural conference In con
nection with the presidents remarks on
agriculture it says Nothing could be
more misleading than Harrisons remarks
The only thing that saves America from a
vast terrible social catastrophe is the ex
tent and cheapness of her outlying lands
and her superb system of railroads With
regard to the troubles of English tenant
farmers however nothing could be a
wilder or worse step than retaliation on
McKiuleyites by excluding American corn
and bee

WASHINGTON D C Deo 7 lS2 j 1
Delegate Caine when asked by TUB t
HERALD correspondent today what was the
prospect of the passage of the bill for the 1
public building at Salt Lake city oaid that
in his opinion the House would not pass
the Salt Lake bill at this session or any
other bill having a like object in view Mr
Caine believes that it Das been practically
decided on the part of the Committee on
Rules that no public building bills shall
pass this Congress Not one went through
both houses in the last session although the
Senate passed its usual number
There seems to bo a strong disposition
among the leaders on the Democratic side
to keep appropriations down to the lowest
possible limit and in order to do this pub
lie building bills will be among the first
sacrificed
Senator Dubois Is of the same opinion as
Mr Caine concerning the prospects of leg
islation upon public building bills which
have passed the Republican Senate and for
that reason ho thinks that Boise City has
no chance during this Congress of securing
a building for its federal officers

A Escort Sent Congress Regarding the
Treaty of 1817
WASHINGTON Dec 7The president
today in answer to a resolution transmit
ting to the Senate the report of the secre
tary of state on the agreement between the
United States and Great Britain concern
ing armaments on the great lakes The
resolution called for an opinion as to
whether the arrangement of 1S17 was now
hold to be in force The secretary of state
says correspondence exchanged in 1SO1
shows how it is regarded It does not ap
pear ha says that any British or Cana
dian naval vessels are now or have been
for many years stationed in the lakes
The report further says however it is
recently learned by the Treasury Depart
ment that the two vessels recently con
structed for the Canadian government at
Owen sound revenue cutters are in
reality capable of adaptation to naval pur
poses Additional weight is lent to this
case by the precautions taken to guard the
vessels from public inspection In closing
Secretary Foster says It seems most de
sirable now in view of the long lapse of
time and the vast changes that have
occurred that the arrangement has now
grown obsolete in practice and is surviving
in letter only As a declared guarantee of
international peace it should ba modified to
fit the new order ol things and with such
an adaptation to the exigencies of lbs
future as prudence may forecast
