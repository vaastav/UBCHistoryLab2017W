in purity of bis L'ngliBb, in clearness of

he believed to be sounded in truth. In

loss is second only to that of Ihe publlo,

more than forty years of his life.

thy go out to the daughters of our lateas-
sooiato and friend in their double ninic
tion of tbe loss of their mother and father
within a brief month, and that we lender
to them in their great sorrow our sincere
condolence nnd respect.
Resolved, That in Ihe reoent death of
three of the oldest and most distingnished
editors of the journals of this oily ad
monishes us of the uncertainty of life, of
the unBtabilily of all human affaire, and
that as daily teachers and chronicles or
Ihe great transactions of the world it be.
comes us to bo ready to meet that sum
mons which has only a 1 i t tie in advance of
us called bim, our late friend and broth
er.

tions be signed by the President and Sec
retary of the Association, nnd be forward.
