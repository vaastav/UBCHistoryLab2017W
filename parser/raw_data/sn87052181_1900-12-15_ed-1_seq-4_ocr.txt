MRS. BREWER RECOMMENDS PERUNA
FOR GRIP AND FEMALE CATARRH
The Home of Mrs. Lizzie M.
In a letter to Dr. llartman concerning the
merits of l'e-runa, Mrs. ltrener writes,
among other things:
Westerly, H. I.
"Dear Dr. Hartman I 11ml l'e-ru-na a
sure cure for all catarrhal affections so com
mon in this part of the country. It cures
a cohl at once. There is no cough medicine
that can at all equal l'e-ru-na. for la
crinpe, there is no other remedy that can
at all compare with l'e-ru-na.
"1 am among the sick a great deal in our
city and have supplied many invalids with
l'e-ru-na. simply hecauf e 1 am enthusiastic
in my faith as to its results. 1 have never
known it to fail to quickly and permanently
remove that demoralized state of the hu
man sjstem which follows la grippe.
"In all cases of extreme weakness I use
Pe-ru-na with perfect confidence, of a pood
result. In cases of weakness peculiar to my
sex 1 am sure that no other rcjBe'dy can ap-
Teat's Stolen FIk.
"Another story that Vest told related to
his candidacy for the legishture in 1S0I
againt A. S. Vdlker. The canvass was ex
ceedingly exciting because of the near ap
proach of war, and all the questions inci
dent to it were di.scusscd with much ani
mation. Chargt- and counter-charges were
made. Roth tides knew that about --ix
votes either way would determine the mil
test, and on the day before election Walker
raised the jmint on Vest that he had stolen
t.ome pigs. The only way that Vrt could
meet the charge was to acknowledge smil
ingly that he had the pig- in his pen and
in his poseion. If he had gone further
and said that he had taught them which
they hoped he would do they had wit
nesses to show that ho had not bought
them, but Vest was too shrewd to be caught
in the trap, and turned the accusation off
with a laugh and the remark:
One eon t account tor the way his nova
pigs.' " t. Louis Republic.

A LIFE SAVED.

r.invnril Advice Savon the Life
of a Prominent Citizen.
Chicago, 111., Dec. 10, 1P0O (Special)
Amonjr the Catholic Foresters in this
city, none is better known or more uni
versally esteemed than Mr. S. I'. Rush,
Conductor (President) of Holy Xante
Court. Xumber 2G.
His. many friend?, inside the Order
end outside of its ranks. tverc, there
fore, much startled to learn that his
life was in danger, he having liright's
Disease, that most terrible and fatal
disease.
Mr. Rush, however, made a crar.d
struggle for his life, taking prescript
tions, and pills, and powders, until his
stomach refused food. At last, bis
local druggist, guided by the numer
ous inquiries Ixdng made at his store
for Dodd's Kidney Pills, ndristd Mr.
Jtush to buy and try some. This he
did. and to his delight he was restored
to health and strength.
Mr. Rush savs that after commenc
ing the use of Dodd's Kidney Pills, he
felt much better, but it took two
months to effect a cure.
"I took nothing else but Dodd's
Kidney Pills during that time, so I
know that 1 owe life and health to
them."
What this wonderful remedy has
done for Mr. Rush, it will certainly do
for anyone. It is the only remedy that
has never failed to cure Iiright's Dis
ease. Mr. Rush is just now receiving the
congratulations of his friends, but
always finds time to say a good word
for the Medicine that saved bis life.

Americans In Madrid Dnrlnsr War.
An amusing account is giten in tht
experiences of "An American in Mad
rid During the War." The writer. Mr.
Edmccd Kelly, was called from Paris
tn the SpauUli capital at the outbreak
of the war on business of urgent im
portance. Fortunately, as he thought,
he !pokc French llueiitly and had a
Paris address; and his principal dis
guise was "a foulard cravat, which
Frenchmen tie in a loose bow like that
in which our grandmothers tied their
bonnet strings ."0 years ago." The Span
ish charge d'affaires at Paris gave him
no encouragement. There was risk of
being arrested as a spy. and treated ac
cordingly. Mr. Kelly found, Ims, i-.i.inn
of hostile territory so easy, however,
2. i? Lc posithely humiliating. He
spent seven necks in Madrid, suffering
little or no annoyance, and with his
eyes wide open; and he writes dispas
sionately of the situation of affairs
there, his comments being of sub
stantial interest and value. Century.

lie. President McKinlcy has repeated
through his message the old experi
ment of trying to say little or noth
ing in many words. A sparsity of
ideas and a voluminosity of language
were, perhaps, his best policy at this
peculiar time. Chicago Chronicle.
President McKinley's annual mes

long, is most remarkable for what it
does not say. It is almost dumb as to

The mass of the people are unnblfe

(Rep.).
Imperialism to note.
The president's message is a con
fession that, in so far as it is possible
to Mr. MeKinley and the republican
party, the government is to be ad
ministered on lines of imperialism
and of class privilege that arc for
eign to the spirit of its founders.
Politically speaking, Mr. MeKinley
has good warrant for the tone of his
message. His campaign for reelec
tion was necessarily made on these
issues, the democratic assault on the
trusts and imperialism being excep
tionally fierce. The people at the
polls supported Mr. McKinlcy in this
conflict of opinion. All that now re
mains to be seen is whether or not
the people best know what was good
for themselves and for tin" country
when they extended the MeKinley
lease of power for four jears more.
The president himself is faithful, in
his message, to those things for which
he stood in the campaign which end
ed in his reelection to the presidency.

Rev. Henry Langford, the eminent Baptist divine, of TVcston, W. VJl, bos lost es
caped attor nervous ana physical prostration. He ia pastor of four churches, .For ten
years," ha said, " I have been nervous and growing worse all these years. Daring the las.
four or five years I became so nervous I could scarcely sign my" name bo it could bo read.
I was so nervous that I could not read my own sermon notes after they had been lata asido
awhile.
"I was uncblo to hold my head steady in the pulpit, nor could I hold or bancilo my
books and papers without embarrassment, owing to the trembling and weaknfsB of my
hand? and arms. I was bo nervous that I could scarcely feed myself. In fact, my nervca3
system was wrecked.
" I tried many remedies recommended by physicians, but found no permanent reLcx.
" Ono day 1 was in the store of R. S. Ogden. at Sanlis, VT. Va., and be. said to mo :
You take two bottles of Dr. Greene's Nervura blood and nervo remedy, and if you say
don't help you, you need not pay for it.' , ...
" I took two bottles of this medicine and found so much relief that I bought two rnpro
bottles, and now I am wonderfully improved in health and in strength. Dr. Greenes ISer
vura blood and nervo remedy did it. I can heartily and truthfully recommend it to taa
sick. Too much cannot be said iu praise of this splendid medicine. I saytjns for the goal
of other sufferers from nervous and prostrating diseases who can bo cured by this remedy.
For myself, I am thankful to God that I found Dr. Gretna's Nervura blood and ncrrj
remedy, and for what it has done for mo."
