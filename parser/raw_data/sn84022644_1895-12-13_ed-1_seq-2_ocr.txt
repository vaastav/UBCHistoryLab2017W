Washington Letter.
Prom our refrulir Correspondent,
Washington, Dec. 2nd, 1895
The most noticeable thing about the
opening ot Congress, to a democrat, was
tba absence of eo many of the men who
have for years fought in the front rank of
the democratic party. Among the ab
sentees in the Senate are Butler, of 3.
Car. who has been succeeded by Ex
Gov. Tillman; Hunton, of Va., whose
successor is Martin, a good democrat;
McPherson, of N. J., succeeded by a re
publican, and Ransom. N. Car., whose
successor is a populist. But it is in the
Bouse that; the hole in the democratic
ranks is the biggest. It seems strange
to bear a roll called without the names
of such veterans in Congressional har
ness asHolman andEynuru, ot Ind.;
Springer, of 111., Kilgore, of Tex.; Hatch
and Heard, of Mo. ; Outh waite, of O. ; and
score of others who have won honors
and scars battling for democratic princi
ples. Ex-Speaker Crisp will, of course, be
the leader of the democrats of the House
during the present session, the man who
will call down Czar Reed every time he
attempts to trample on the rights of the
minority. There has been no though
among democrats that this would be oth
erwise, as was shown by the votes of the
democratic caucus all cast for Mr Crisp.
f he stones about thi administration de
siring another man for leader had their
origin with those who wished to add to
the unfortunate differences already ex
isting in the democratic party by mak
ing it appear that President Cleveland
was demanding that no silver man should
be given a post of honor. It is need lees
to say to any intelligent democrat that
President Cleveland never thought of
such a thing as dictating to or interfer
ing in any way with the democrats in
the House.
Representative Otey, of Va has a
scheme that will injure no one and may
greatly benefit needy ex-Confederate sol
diers if it can be carried through. In the
Treasury there is an accumulation o
money sequestered during and directly
after the war for want of evidence to
Bhow its proper owners, 'amounting to
about $25,000,000. Inasmuch as this
money belongs in the South and its
rightful owners will probably never be
found, Mr Otey proposes to try to get a
bill through' Congress, providing that
the interest on this money shall be dis.
tributed among needy ex-Confederate
soldiers, and that when thev no looser
need such aid the principal shall revert
ts the government to be used as any
9 a
other money provided by Congress . In
order to avoid any charge of partisan
ship, even by implication, Mr Otey pro
poses having the bill introduced by a re
publican, if he can get one to do it
The calm which now prevails among
the republicans of the House is as omi
nous in its way as that which precedes a
storm at sea. To the inexperienced on
looker, Speaker Reed is a Czar, indeed.
But there is a reason why everything
seems to be going Mr Reed's way among
his party colleagues in the House. He
Wasn't announced the committee assign
ments. Until be does the calm is like
ly to last; all of the republicans want to
get as good committee places as they
can. But after the assignments are an
nounced the dissapointed ones will be
numerous and Mr Reed cannot let them
down easy by saying that he was bound
by promises made before bis election to
dissapoint them, as his friends have for
weeks been making a special point of
claiming that be would become speaker
without having made a single promise
and that he was free to arrange the com
mittees just as he wanted them. There
fore every disappointed man will know
lust who to noia reeponBibie. li u
charged a'so that Mr Reed took a band
in naming the minor officers of the House
who were elected today, which made
him some more enemies in his own
party. On the whole the outlook for
him can hardly be considered a pleasant
one.
President Cleveland's message was
ready to go in today, but, as has often
been done at the assembling of a new
Congress, it was held back to give the
House a chance to organize and will go
.in tomorrow.
Secretary Hoke Smith has gone to At
lanta, where he will, by special invita
tion, deliver a financial address before
the Ua. legislature. He is expected to
return to Washington this week"
Mr. De Yeung, of the Chronicle must
have been looking in the looking-glass
when he wrote the following definition
of a politician. It is about as mnch like
the real politician as a sunflower is like a
rose : "At a political banquet held a few
evenings ago a gentleman of distinction
in the councils of his party was called
to the toast, put interrogatively, ' What
is a politician?'" Without undertaking
to either quote or paraphrase the reply
we venture upon a definition of our own.
A politician is a man of education,
breeding, integrity and patriotism, who
consents to sacrifice a large portion o'
bis time and a larger portion cf his in
dividual effort for the advancement .of
the principles of government in which
he believes, and which are beat represen
ted by the party with which he is affil
iated. That there are so-called politi
cians who come far ebort of this stand
ard is not to be denied, but that fact in
no wise interferes with the true defini
tion of a politician.
In Walla Walla, Wash., the story of
Romeo and JnUet came near having a
counterpart in real life. A conple were
visiting the cemetery and coming to a
vault they, "just for the fun of the thing,"
went in and closed the door. The door
had a combination lock and it was not
long before the couple discovered they
were locked in. The lady began to cry
'and yell, while the roung man gave bis
attention to the combination. He , soon
found the Iocs would not give way, and
as air was not any too plentiful he, too,
became frightened and gave vent '
yells not in harmony with the tomb.
The sexton who was passing heard faint
eounds proceeding from the vicinity of
the vault and this led to their liberation,
after they had become about half choked
for want of air. Truth in this case was
much mnre forcible than fiction.
Some of our exchanges continue to
publish Foster's forecasts. There are
men in Albany aha know more than
Foster. Ask them.
There is to be another North pole "ex
pedition. How foolieh, for no one will

will solve nothing, for it is a mass of ice

hire England aid the
!
The Democrat's sympathies are with
Venezuela. England has treated her
in a very arbitrary manner. If she had
a Bolivar she would knock the "stuffing"
out of England. She has only a Crespo,
though, and Crespo hasn't many cow
boy a back of him. Venezuela is the size
of Spain, France and Portugal, about the
sue of Washington, Oregon and Califor
nia; but its population is only about
2,000,000. Physically it is well .situated
for defense but not tor an aggressive war.
What is the trouble about? Along on
its eastern borders are some of the finest
gold mines in the world. England o vcs
the adjoining country, British Guiana.
In order to get those gold fields it has
been arbitrarily absorbing this country
and claiming ownership to it, already
having pushed her boundary line west
four hundred miles. Of course Vene
zuela doesn't like that and awhile ago
she shipped three English ministers
from her shores. England considered
that an insult. I t has been proposed to
arbitiate the matter of the boundary line.
Now the Salem hog, about which so
much has been said, doesn't compare
with the British hog, whose countenance
is well outlined in Salisbnry, and that
country it is understood refuses to arbi
trate, pigheadedly insisting on retaining
the boundary line according to its own
measurements. That is, in order to get
these gold fields it proposes to gobble up
a territory just about half as big as Ore
gon. Here's where the Monroe doctrine
comes in, being an American territory it
is the business of the U. S. to insist on
the noninterference ot England in the
acquisition ot American territory.
"Keep your hands off." So far as the
matter of the three men was concerned,
that was personal, and the Monroe doc
trine had nothing to do with it.
Venezuela has taken rather of a bolj
stand in the matter because confident of
being backed by the U.S.
So much for the war cloud that is ris
ing on the horizon. Depend upon it,
though, England will have enough sense
before the crisis to see the lack of wis
dom of her position and the affair w:l(
no doubt be settled amicably. The sen
sational press of the country, in order to
sell papers will take every opportunity
to enlarge upon the situation ; but the
people see through such rot and it takes
more than wind to bring about war.
The Opening Prayer.
Following ia tne prayer delivered by
Rev. Milburn upon the opening of the TJ.
5. Senate : Almighty God, we devoutly
bless Tbee that the men chosen to rep
resent the soverign States of this Union
upon the floor of this body Tuou hast had
in Thy care and guardianship : that none
has been smitten by the shadow feared
of man, but all are ready to answer to
the roll call of the Senate. Gird them
for their responsible and laborous duties.
Grant them, and a'l that are dear to
them, help, strength, cheer, and peace.
Amidst onr gratulauons ana joy
our hearts ot sympathy turn to a darken
ed home in Iowa, where a wife, adacgh
ter ait mourning the departure from
them of the husband and father, lately a
member of this Home. Visit them, O
God, who didst shed the tears of sympa
thy at Bethany, and grant them Thy
consolation.
We likewise commend to Thy fatherly
goodness the honseaold of an bumble
and faihful servant of this Honse, who
through many years in his lowly peace,
by fidelity, courtesy, and stainless char
acter, adorned the doctrines of God his
Savior- We pray that they may find
consolation and strength in the faith of
the resurrection and eternal life.
Likewise we commend to Thy father
ly tenderness the time-honored officer of
this House who for more than threescore
years has been present at the opening
of every session of Congress, bnt who
now lies upon a bed of affliction, wont
with pain and exhausted by suffering
Comfort and bless him, O Lord, and
grant to raise him from bia conch and
bring him back to his accustomed place.
Keep ni all by Thy Divine Providence,
and graat that by onr devotion to Thee
in the gospel of Thy Son, in lite and
death we may be called Thine; and so
at the end of this mortal journey come
to the land of everlasting life. Through
Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.
ine juniors oi vasaar college gave a
novel entertainment in Strong ball tbe
other night. Cards were sent to the
seniors, inviting them to "attend the
wedding of the Duke of Marlborough to
Miss Consuelo Vanderbilt." The seniors
rigged themselves up in bloomers and
powdered tresses, and came to represent
the nobility. The marriage was, of course,
a farcical affair, at which a most extra
ordinary appearing bishop officiated.
The happy pair were congratulated and
Queen Victoria then held a reception.
When the reception was over a proces
sion was formed, and all proceeded to tbe
gymnasium, cheering as they went, and
occasionally shouting a "tiger" for Vas-
ear. The affair wound op with a grand
frolic. .
Tbe Eugene Register charges .that an
old soldierjdoclor was discharged from
the position of physician at the soldiers'
home, and a yonng and inexperienced
man, not an ex soldier, appointed, and
gives the following plausible explana
tion : "It is generally understood that
he was appointed through the influence
of Tru?tee,Alley, and that be owes his
appointment to the fact tbat be is a son-in-law
of Congressman Hermann, and
was, in alt probability, recommended by
his father-in-law for tbe position."
The Oregon and Washington divisions
of the Travelers' Protective Association
now propose exerting their energies to
ward opening the Columbia to Naviga
tioa. Their plan is to build it as a pri
vate enterprise, tbe funds to be raised
by pnblic donation. Donations will be
asked for from different financial orgaui
zations of Portland and also from tbe
farmers in tbe npper country. They
eonsider a boat railway the most feasi
ble plan, and estimate it will cost $400,.
000 and that one year will be required to
build it. Baker City Democrat.

That War Cloud.
A Real Gun.
Several days ago the Dkhocrat men
tioned the fact of Frick having a real
gun in the holdup for which he received
five years in the penitentiary. The Tel
egram has the following on the subject:
A O Frick, who is now in the "pen"
under a five year's sentence for attempt
ing to rob the United States malls, grew
very talkative on the way to the peni
tentiary and told Deputy Marshal
Ilnmphrey many things connected with
the robbery, which, if true, are much in
the nature ot a confession. To Deputy
Humphrey, Frick declared that he had a
real gun and drew a bead on the stage
driver when he commanded that person
to halt and throw out the mail sacks.
"I used a real weapor," said Friak,
"but I also bad a bogus gun made out of
bark. I had the real gun in my band
when I told the driver to stop and was
ready to nse it, if necessary. When
Deputy Sheriff Gordon got outot the
stage with his gun, I fully realized the
true situation in which I was placed.
He was armed and I knew he meant bus
Iness. I might have fired and killed
him, or he might have shot and killed
me. If I killed him 1 knew that I would
be a murderer, and it he killed me, he
would be a hero. So, under the circum
stances, I concluded the best thing to do
was to scoot, and I took to my heels and
made for that tale patch. Well, you
know how matters turned out with me.
When I started to run, I dropped my
real gun at the barracade behind which I
stood as the stage drove up, and the bo
gus weapon was lett in the tales. What
ever became of the real gun I do not
know. There was a report that it was
picked op by some one, that was not
confirmed. The truth is, I had two con
federates in the holdup. The two men
live in the vicini'y of Klamath Lake and
have families. Whilo I was lying in the
county jail these two men visited me,
and we had a conversation about holding
np the stage. They understood that the
stage which would pass along Sunday
morning would bare about $10,000, and
it was decided between ns that we would
hold np the stage and make a big haul,
which was to be divided among the
three. I was furnished the tools by there
men with which I cut my way out of tbe
jail and made my escape. When the
stage was field np, the two confederates
were in the brush on the opposite side of
the road, and they, like myself, had real
weapons. Just as soon as Deputy Gor
don made his appearance on tbe scene
with a gun, the two men 'flunked' and
did not show np at all as it was under
stood they should. The truth is, none ot
ns expected to see Gordon just then, and
his sadden and unexpected appearance
knocked our plana ont. My confeder
ates did not come to the res-ue as 1 ex
pected, and left roe single handed, and I
deemed it prudent under the circum
stances to beat a hasty retreat. Of tbe
unfortunate outcome to me, of tbe at
tempt to rob the stage, tt is unnecessary
to speak. Had the two men made their
appearance as was agreed upon tbe re
sult might have been very different; it
might have been a gieat deal worse all
around.

The Oregon Central is making a
traffic arrangement by which it can
compete with the O. R. & X. by way ot
Yaquina. Some people think this
means that the S. P. will own tbe O. C.
& E. if it does not already. The Demo
crat does not believe there is anything
more in this than a temporary traffic
arrangement to meet the cut of tbe
O. R. & X. This reminds tbe Democrat
ot tbe banquet given the San Francisco
men two or three years ago with this
tame object in view. There was lota of
talk and a good deal of champaign drank ;
bnt tbat was all it amounted to. There
is a suggestion that the S. P. is 'n this
arrangement; but just bow that is fig
ured ont the Democrat is unable to see.
In any event it behooves the O. C. & E.
to get io and rustle for some of the bus
iness that is around.

A historic elm tree at Plymouth, Pa
was cut down Thursday, for fear it would
collapse during a heavy blow, and cause
damage. This elm was voted on March
2, 1774, by the town meeting, as the place
of pnblic rendezvous, and was then re
ferred to as "The noble tree upon which
our ancestors have gazed." Subsequent
to 1774 it served as an auction mart, vll
lage market and whipping post. A count
of the rings upon it showed that the tree
was 372 years old.

She is not one of that silly class of per
sons who, broken down in health by
mental or bodily strain, not quite sick
enough to be abed, put off thinking ser

Improperly nourished nerves and poor

ot disorders.
On tbe other hand, when reduced
health and spirits are early recognized

one of the best evidences of how Paine'

country.
Woman's peculiar life brings a languor
and listlessness that are l.st met by
Paine's celery compound. The dispirit

gic headaches, the sleeplessness and
nervous debilitv, that so frequently at
tack women when their bleod is robbed
of its vitality U soon dispelled when
Paine's celerv compound is used.
Mrs. Collman, w riting October 30 from

"Fully appreciating the benefits from
the cfeof Paine's celery compound I rec
