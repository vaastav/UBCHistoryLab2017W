itnmediately subscquent to the outbreak
of ti the American government, by solici.
tation of Mr. Wshlburn, gave protection to
the foreigners in Paris, and secuired thereby
the Welfare and good will of all concerned.
Our government promptly recognized the
lRepublic of France, but while desirous of
procuring peace between the two nations
declined the invitation to mediate conjoint
ly with European powers as hostile to the
cutabulshed usage and policy of the govern
mont. When the United States can later
vencand hasten peace it will do so.
CUBA.
There is no materisl change in the situa
tion since the close of Congress. The cases
of sesisure and arbitrary arrests threatcning
at one time to disturb the relatious of the
two governments have been amicably ad
justed by a joint tribunal, and it is expect
ed all others will be disposed of in like
manner.
SAN DOMflCO.
The Pres.dent is exceedingly solicitous
that Congress should order a Commission
to negotiate a trety for the a.quisition of
t.,o Island. IIe says the Island sought an,
nexat!on: that its population is 12.,000;
that it will sulport 10,000,000, and is the
richest l:.:ality tinder the nun. It com
inands the entrance to the Catribbean Sea.
and national protection demands its acqul
sition. It has the ri.l:at of soils, the finest
harbors, the most s ilabrious climate and
the most valuable products of any of the
West Indip Islands. It will give us com
mand of all the Islands in the vicinity, and
will eriploy 10,000 addhtional laborers to
those now on the Island. It will largely
increrse otr exports and reducs our im.
ports $100,000,000 annually by furnishing
as sugar, coffee, tobacco and tropical fruits.
If we jail to acquire it European nations
will reap the advantages offered as and en
tail alalnity where we might have bless
ings. The solicitude of the President is so
earneston thls matter that unless there is dis- "
cord between the Executive and Senate
this winter we apprehend his recommends- '
lious will be approved.
TuE C.I.il:SE MVASSACIt..
The President nttributes the tuassacre of
French and Prussian residetits at Tientsin to
a mob and the local authorities. The Pe
kin government was disposed to fulfill the
treaty. IIostlities in Chinese waters arc
suspended between the Pruasl.ns and
French, and they now act jointly in the
protection of Christians In China.
TUB BRITISu AMER.CAN LIFL.
In April 1870 the engineers discovered'
that by an error the I;itish line near Pem
bina was located 5,700 feet south of where
it should be, and that the Hudson Bay Fort
was on this ground. Dy joint consent the
Fort is allowed to remain and be occupied
for the present, but the President wants the
boundary surveyed and marked caMt as it is
on the west of the Bocky iountains.
TUE ALABAMA CLA IoMt
These are in statm quo-which means no
nearer adjustment than at any previous
time. The President recommends that pri
vate claimants transfer their accounts to the
government for settleouent, but does not in
indicate that any extrome measures will be
resorted to to compel a settlement. So,
Iteverdy Johnson and Bon Butler are both
Ignored.
WAVIGATIO2( O. ST. LAURsNCs.
Great Britain has, at the instigation of
the Canadas, denied the United States free
navigation of the St. Laurence, thereby en
hancing the cot of transit and crippling,
to an extent, our Lake commerce. The
President cites the actions of other nations
wherein it is held that a country through
%which a river passes has a natural right to
navigate it to the sea. The navigation of
thae hlae,Parana, Ura.uay, Danube, Ama
son and La Plata Is free, and England once
insisted tbohe ame in regard to the Missis
sippi. The Prrsident concedes that al
though abstractly England may claim the
right to do thus, it is an extreme and hard
law, and he shows little disposition to soc
cept the situnaaio kindly. He hopes Eng.
land will abandon Its present policy on that
point

R .VrNUE RIFORM:
if the phrase means 'What It issdmcs be fa
vors it. If it implies thie collection of all
revenue by direct taxation; if it means no
revenues and repuc(iation, he is opposed to
it. "Revenue reform has not been defined
by any of its advocates to my knowledge,
but seems to be accepted as something
which is to supply every man's wants with
out any cost or effort on his part. A true
revenue reform cannot be made in a day,
but must be the work of national legisls
tlon and of tilm,."
le favors the abolition of duties on arti
cles of universal use, not produced by our
selves ju.,t as soon as revenue can be dis
pensed with. An army of assessors and
coullctors is not a pleasant sight to the citi
zens; but that or a tariff for revenue is no
cessary.
!TILITAITT & NAVAL.
The army is being reduced to the number
requi|ed by the act of Congress. The erec
tion of a new War Department building is
recommended. The expenses for the navy
Sare reduced to $10,000,000, or one million
less thin for 18009. The expenses for flie
months this year show a decrease of $0,
400,000. The estimates for the current year
are $230,82,317, against $28,205,878 la;t
year, with 0955,100 for permanent improve
Sments. IHe thinks witll 5,000 miles of sea
coast, exclziuive of Alaska; with 40,000,000
people; with questions of serious inport
continually arising between us and other
nations, thu:t it is Unwise to reduce our
means of enforcing a policy of protection
and redress, and will submit a plan during
the session looking to the building and re
pairing of vessels at great saving on present
cost.
PCIfAL.
The report of Postmaster General Cress
well is satisfactory, and the recommends
Lions on franking and correspondence card s
are approved. The P resident anticipates a
further reduction in postige rates at no dis
tant d.:y. Ile recommends that tie P. M.
Gcncral be uuthorized to 1-sue the commis
:o,,s in that D.epart.nent.
CIVIL SERVICE REFOnRM.
The Pi'rc.,idct says that always favoring
practical reform, lie adivis.s reform in the
ma nner of man-ingg appointmuents, wherein
the advice and consent of the Senate is not
required. It is the most embarrassing and
thankless task imposed on the President.
D.:l'partmonts, Senators and Representatives,
does not secure the bast, aid oftentimes
unfit men fur public places. (This is emphat
ic recommendation of the Civil Service
BIiL)
IN±DIAN AvFAIlrs.
The experiment of matking the Indian
agencies a missionary work, is, he says, a
success. The agencies are given to mina
recommended by those societies and de
nominations who had previously had mis
sionaries among the Indians. The govern
ment holds these agents to the same strict
responsibility as other appintecs. Army
ollcers beirg ineligible, nil agencies are
o w disposed of in this way. The Presi
dent hopes this policy will in a few years
put all Indians on reservations, secure
peace, and their weliarc,at reduced expendi
ture.
PU'DLIC LANDS.
During the year 600, 954,180 acres of pub
lic lands were disposed of. 8G9.e01,003
acres were taken as homesteads; 215,931,481
were sold tor cash; the remainder was sold
for scrip, or given railways, etc., as subsidy.
031,545 more acres wcr, taken as home
stcnds than in 1819. The homest cad and
pre emption laws are h!Qihly approved, and
he a.i|,s: "I submit a3 a suhj;.t worthy of
conslderatioa, whether the residue of our
national domailn should not be wholly dis
posed of under the provisions of the home
stead and pre-emption laws."
The President admits that the Treasury
has in many Instances been reimbursed,
where railroads have been eubsidized, by
the sale at double minimum prices of the
residue landr, and that the extension of
railroads into the West has developed great
resources, bnt thinks the subsidies have
been inOiscriminate and profusely liberal.
He questions the expediency of further
land subsidies, but if Congress determines
otherwise recommends that the right of set
tiers be effeectually seured and protected.
lie says: "In conclusion, I would sum up

MINlr&JLS OP THE ZOCEX
"Never you let up on snakes: that way
lies heresy." o I. W. Raymond pleant
ly puts the case in the last Oreriead. We
presume about twelve in every dozen per.
sons who have travelel over the Pacific rail
road through Wyoming nave so mentally
admonished their tonguesto that sterile and
forbidding domain, where existence in the
suumer is between alkali fiats and brass
lined heavens anl the "winter of discon
tent" has no "sun of York" to make it
alorions. Bltt, good came out of Nazareth,
and Wyoning, it seems, has developed a
praftisal, inexhaustable and valuable re
source in great coal fields extending from
the western boundary of the Territory to
nlthin 100 miles of Cheyenne. Prof. Hay
den of the I. S. Geological Survey, esti
mates the deposit of coal underlies 100
miles square-10,000 square miles-of the
Territory. The average depth of the vein
is a'out eighty feet. It is also believed the
northern portion of the Territory, on the
Bozemam route, has like deposits. We re
collect of seeing veins and croppings of
bituminous coal in many places between
Fort Laramie and the Powder River. If
the projected railroad between Cheyenne
and Helena is built coal will be found In
exhaust!ess quantities on the line. If the
fuel is not on the surface It is cached b3
neath. The Wyoming Leader, in speaking
of these deposits, says:
"It will be seen that Wyoming is really
the great coal region of the world, surpass
ing even Pennsylvania in extent, and beside
which the mines of Illinois, Iowa, and even
Europe seem insignificant."
This, in view of the fact th it the beds
are yet developed to only a limited extent,
is probably a wild entlhusiasm, as the one
single bituminous coal field of Central and
South-Western Pennsylvania, reaching out
into the adjoining S:ates, underlies 05,000
square miles, and has been thoroughly de
veloped. As Great Btitian alone has $50,000,
000 invested in coal, and mines 60,000,000 to
70,000,000 tons per annum, the Wyoming
mines that throw them into "insignificance"
will have to be quite an important industry.
Stl1, without exaggeration, Wyoming has
doubtless discovered a great resource in
coal, nad it is stated iron likewise abounds.
If this is the case, iron manufactories will
spring into existence where the ore and
fuel abourds, juit as certainly as they did
in Penusylvania. And as Territorial lines
do not usually circumscribe mineral de
posits, we may confidently anticipate ex
tensive coal fields, already found in various
localities, will be developed in Montana,and
the copper and lead ores so rich and exten
sive in the Territory becnue prominent and
vastly productive resources as the placer
mines are exhausted.
The geological surveys of Prof. Ilayden
Ihave done much for Colorado and Wyom
ing in giving reliable information of their
mineral wealth, and attracting thither the
attention of those able to develop it. One
or two ineffectual efforts have been made
to procure a government geological survey
of Montana, and the object to be attained
renders it worthy of being again solicited.
Prof. Hayden has about completed his sur
veys of Colorado and Wyoming. Wethink
it probable that on a presentation of the
case by Governor Potts and other Federal
and Territorial officers of Montana, his ser
vices might be ordered In this field, and
much benefit result therefrom.
TILE "QUE&BB" CIBCULARS.
Not a few gentlemen, rega.J d in the
commuuity as Irreproachable-or approxi
mately so-have within a few months been
the recipients of lith'graphcircula s a-suu
nlug to coman from ser)udrels in Now York
proposing to send then counterfeIt money
at a small per cent of its (bogus) face value.
The names were procured in a variety of
methods that will suggest themselves. They
were signed " CnfiJent!alIy," " Frater
nally," "On the Square," etc., and usually
expressed the utmost confidence in the
party addressed, he having been recom
ncuded highly to the writers for his in
tegrity-and disposition to deal in counter
feit money. Of course no honest man, or
dishonest one with ordinary business sa
gacity, would send genuine money to these
sharks, but doubtless others in Montana as
well as elsewhere have bee4 caught with
the lithographic guidgeon balt and invested.
It may be Interesting to them to know that
the detectives have been intercepting the
orders and the press Is publishing some of
them. Any one not hearing from their
"Fraternal" friends In the regular timr
may therefore console themselves with the
refreshing probability that their requests for
the circulating medium are in the hands of
the police, and if the whole arrangement
was not a put-up job by detectives, that
their coad tial correndspoets are lux
uriating I the Tooabs.

The roads between this place and Helena
are fine-I wish I could say as much for
the provisions. The coaches are enabled to
make good time, but the process of masti
cation, as conducted at most of the eating
stations, is necessarily slow; in fact the
toughness of the steak is a difficulty which
renders it impossible for the hungry travel
er to chew up the value of a dollar and a
half durinng the time allowed for refresh
ments and for "hooking" fresh horses to the
coaches. There is nothing to be done about
it that I know of. as
THERE IS fO LAW COMPELLING MEN TO
IAVE CONSCIENCES.
Lunch baskets and lunches are constantly
in the way on the coach, but as between
them and sta:lon steak, give me the lunchcs
The are two or three places on the road
where excellent meals are provided, and as
I expect to pass over the same route again
within a few weeks, I think it strategy to
leave these stations nameless for the pre
sent. Each station keeper is notilled that
he may consider himself the "honorable
exception" until further notice. The ac
commodations provided by
OII.MBI. AND SArLSBERY'S STAGE LINE
Were excellent, and the trip was performed
with more comfort than would seem possi
ble, cosidcring the distance between Helena
and Corinne. The coaches and stock were
excellent, employees gentlemaulyand accom
modating agents, and the whole business of
the line seemed to be so systematized that it
"worked like clock work" and avoided de
lay and trouble so far as possible.
PERSONAL.
I met "X" Beidler, the "little un," who,
with others, is employed by Wells, Fargo
&. Co., as a gumard for their treasure in tran
sit over those portions of the road most
subject to the attacks of Road Agents.
Numerous freight teams-probably half
a dozen trains-were on their way to Mon
tana, but we did not learn whether they
were loaded with sugar or coal oil. The
latter is 75i cents per gallon at Corinne.
r. IlHenry T Wilkinson,Traveling Agent
of the Garzctl, was a fellow passenger on
the coach and will remain East durin:g the
winter. Al. BIradlbury, formerly colnnect
ed with lluntley's express, drove me into
Co'rinne yesterday afternoon, and here I
am, lreparc.d to boil down a descrip'ion of
this town into the smallest possible space.
CORINNE,
Scarcely eighteen months old, rojoices in a
city government, eighty-feet streets, a level
town s:te, three churches, two schools, an
Opera 11 use, two thouisand inulbitants,
nd :the prospect of more, and wou:d furnish
muateral for a long letter, which I have not
time to write. I have met Dr. O. D.Cass, for
tncrly of !elena, and to him I am indebted
for ,umncro:s facts aod figures. The Epis
copal Church, the first built, is of adobe,
very finely finished in imitation of stone.
The Mlethodists l:.vean ecgant brick church
edifice, finer than can be found in most of
the country towns of New England. The
Presbyterians have a new church building
in the gothic style, nearly completed, which
will be the handsomest in town. There
are two schools, both private, one having
eighty and tho other thirty scholars. A
Catholic church and academy are soon to be
erected. An Opera Hlouse, 100x44 feet, has
just been finished. It is provided with iron
framed seats and is one of the neatest pub.
lic halls to be found in the mountains. The
water used by the town is pumped by steam
from Bear River, and is conducted tbrough
the place by means of flvc-incl iron pipes,
fire plugs being placed at the corners of the
streets. There are two hotels in the tow n,
a number of stone and brick business
houses and numerous fine residences, some
of brick, and all wearing an air of perman
cy which one scarcely expects to find In so
young a place.
This is the town as it its, but the inhabi
tants expect much greater things. They
base their anticipations upon the belief that
Corinne is to be the source from which
100,000 people residing in Idaho, Montana
and Northern Utah are to derive their
supplies.
. Their reasoning does not appear to be
groundless if we note that within the last
nine months sixteen thousand tons of
freight have been received at Corinne and
shipped north, mostly to Montana. Mr.
Lowe, the agent here for the sale of Schutt.
ter wagons, tells me that he has disposed of
about three hundred wagons this year, the
greater portion of which have gone to Mon
tars.
A- steamboat of 150 tons burden is being
built at Stockton, Cal., for use on Bear
River and Salt Lake, and will be principally
employed in bringing to the railroad silver
ores ftom the mines in the vicinity of Salt
Lakoa I met many
OLD xMONTAZNIAZr It&Eln,
And heard of many others, a call upon
whom was postponed until another visl'.
Montana seemed to be the most popular
combination of letters in town. The Main

have approprtated the namie. "
Mr. Closser, formerly of the Planters'
.w.se, Helea, is bore and is keeping one
f the' best private boarding-houses to be
found in any country, and is making mo.

The ides of Decembet fast coming upon

THUE POLITICIAgI.
A review of events from the closo of. the
last session of Congfess to the present,
would be of no Interest to your readers;
sutlice it to say "lessons of deep Dmoment"
have been given to the political wotkers of
both parties. Evidences of a disposition on
both sides to effect radical changes, are seen
and felt in all sections of the country, as
manifested in the vote given in the last elece
lions. This fact, shows the zeal guarding
our political institutions. Whatever of core
rUlption or apathy as to the real wants of the
people, by our legislators, the Argus eye of
the Public is quick to detect and remedy,

the weakest points of our Solons. With all
this pressure upon the action of public men
strict integrity is the only safeguard agtmnst
corruption. A strict adherence to the prin.
ciples avowed in the political canvases, of
whatever stripe, has been, is now, and ever
will be honored by the people.
SPE!CLATIOxS 1 mrs
As to the tone of the President's forthcom.
ing Message. Little if anything is yet known
-'tis said, however, that he will recom.
wnend the passage of a bill for the importa.
tion of foreign i.hips free of duty, against
which the ship-builders' protest has beea
issued, they claiming if ever the necessity
for such a law existed, .it has now passed
away. Also, such a law would ruin the
-hip-building interest in the country. T'he
President's characteristic reticence forbids
the features of his message from being can
vassed with any certainty prior to its delitv
cry.
ttit C3X fESIGNATIO'..
The rction of the President hr accepikng
the resignation of the Secretary of the In
terior, has and is still creating a gredt
amount of comment, both for and against.
but it is urged, and truly too, it was his
prerogative. All Executives have done the
same. The sequence of the act will deter.
mine the nature of his judgment in the
matter. Let this be the test without so much
bil.ungagate. which irritates rather than paci
fies the public mind.
TUHE BR.EULICAX CO°'T.
It may be interesting to your ladyreaders
to know that the :American female ele::ent
will preponderate in the forei-n circles in
Washiington this winter. The new Minis.
ter from France married a Miss Iloffman of
this city; the Spanish Minister, a Mirs
Tiery, a New York Cuban; the wife of the
Attache of the Austrian Legation was a Mrs
Griffin, the widow of one of our brilliant
American Generals; the wife of the Mexi
can Minister was a Miss Smith of this ,oilty,
and that of the Danish representative a
Miss Zabriska of New Jersey ; Mr. Fleury,
the Brazilian Envoy, married an 4mericau
lady; the late Italian Minister Cerrati has
become the husband of Miss Noyes, of
Wae-hington, and Mrs. Lo Strange of the
British Legation was a Miss Austin, of Bos
ton. With this array of American. daugh*
ters in the diplo:natic circle, we hope to see
an American tone given to its manners and
customs.

The Secretary of the Treasury has recent.

be set apart for the Branch Mint a! Carson

Rice a Superintendent of the Mint.
A NOVIL sCooGSTOiW,
The Catholic element of our city, during
the last week, have had quite a sensation in
complimenting the Archbishop of Balti
more on his return from Rome. The pro
cession was very large and attracted much
attention from the two features most prom.
inent, via: the large turn out of boenevolent
Societies and the large mixture of colored
people in the ranks. One of our city papers
draws the conclusion from these facts that
sooner or later the colored people will be
come Catholics in religion and Democratic
in politics. Perhaps so-if so, why so! is a
query for politicians to solve, not us.
wAsnINGTON
Is improving rapidly under the Influence of
capital and labor. The old tumble-down,
ill-looking city is fast disappearing. Even
now but few of the disgusting sights re
main. With the present rate of progress
our city will soon vie with any of our sister
cities in point of prosperity and elegance.
Our Louisville friends must hurry, else they
will loose their best, and thus far, chief ar
gument in favor of removing the Capital.
With hearty greetings to the NonTn
lWEsr, we wait the developmentsof another
week. D. A. F.

We give in this Issue a synopsis of the
President's Message. The space devoted to
it prohibits an exteaded revipw.
It has noMthe terse, aibsontic sentences
that charaaterr;ed Grant's earlier pipers,
nor does it deal in stately periods and round
ed sentences. It is a practical statement of
affairs, in very plain and well authentica
td. English. The San Domingo acquisi
lion and the fishery difllculties are given
most prominence as rising issues, and the
suggestions in regard to the Alabama claims
have a significance quite unsatisfactory to
England. Aside from these, and an inti
mation that on the Tariff and Civil Service
questions he deems the action of Congress
desirable, he-seems satisfied with the pres*
eat status of a.atrs, and disposed to maian
Tbh prisoners coodned in the Nevads
