Times-Star special from Augusta, Ga.,

When Philander J. Knox, .Taf t 's sec

cake-up of tho remaindor of the new

i him to approve Myron T.TIerrick,H
former governor of Ohio, as secretary
of tho treasury.
This fact can bo stated as. coming
(rem authentic sources. Bcforo Mr.
Tift offered tho troasury portfolio tb
preventative Theodore E. Burton of
Ohio, bq-waseriously considering Her
ritk for tho place. Now Herrick is tho
ipprovcd man for tho job.
Tho selection of Knox as secrotary

personnel of tho Taft cabinet.
The president-elect is frank. 4n the

rice of any othor man. This is taken
to mean that tho chances of Pinchot

Cirfield secretary of the interior, arc
itduced to a minimum.
When .Knox arrives hero within tho
text week or so, Taft will submit to
Ilia for his inspection and approval the
following cabinet list.

Mass Meetings to Be Held AU Along
Coast in Protest Against Raiso
Threaten to Organize Rivalry in a
Freight Carrying Steamship Line.
SAN FRANCISCO, December 19.
Shippers and importers are arranging
to unite in a statc-wido protest against
tlf'j increase in transcontinental tariff
announced by the Southern Pacific and.
J-ar.t.Fe railroads, effective the first
day of the year.
Opposition on the part of the inter
ests most affected' will take the form
of a score of mass meetings, held in the
leading cities December 30, when rep
resentatives of leading industries will
take the initiative and set forth the
grievances of 'the business men against
the carriers.
Organizers say the committee at this
time does not caro to divulge its com
plete plans. Suffice tosay, that busi
ness men of tho state propose to invoke
every force at their command to resist
the projected increases of freight rates,
and in invoking these forces, have, tho
unstinted co-operation of the individual
consumer, who, the railroad officers
themselves admitted, must pay $10,
000,000 taxes. They have tho inclina
tion, organization and money to fight
the case on any ground, under any
auspices, in courts or before the inter
state commerce commission.
Tho committee has other plans, it
says, which, if adopted, will, it believes,
have a salutary effect on the action of
traffic men in deciding this special ques
tion. There, t perhaps, will be on objec
tion to saying- that rather than pay
$10,000,000 to trans-continental rail
roads, the shippers of California will
encourage tho establishing of a first
class steamer service onUbc Pacific, as
It has done on the Atlantic, to the
Isthmus of Panama.
"It is the height of folly," says the
committee, "for railroads to plead
poverty and at the same time leave the
settlement of this question entirely to
themselves. If in their opinion the traf
fic will bear it, the advance of rates
will be made, and we apparently are to
have no recourse in the matter. This
OIL COMPANY FILES ITS
BRIEF INBIG FINE CASE
WASHINGTON, December 19. Tho
Standard Oil company's brief in tho
proceedings of the United States
against the company of the charge of
accepting rebates from tho Chicago &
Alton railroad, in which tho United
Sates court for the northern district '
of Illinois imposed a fine of $29,240,000,
was today filed in the supreme court
of the United States. The case comes
before the court on a petition by the
government for a writ of certiorari,
bringing it up for a review of the de
cision by the United States circuit
court of appeals. The brief antagonizes
the petition and this opposition is based
upon the ground that the law does not
authorize a review by the surpreme
court.
