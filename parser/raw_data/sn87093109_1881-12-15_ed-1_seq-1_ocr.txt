fNew York Times, November 15.J
The first public exhibition of the
"Destroyer" and its method of war
fare was made yesterday afternoon at
the Hoboken wharf in the presence of
a distinguished party of gentlemen.
This exhibition was under the aus
pices of the Dehinietcr Irou Works
Co., who constructed for Captain Kr
icssnu the experimental vessel and its
armament. The Starin tug "William
Fletcher" curried over to witness the
trial a party which included among
others Gen. U. S. Grant, Secretary of
the Navy Hunt, Gen. K. F. Beale,
Chief Engineers Lorlngaud Hender
son, U. 8. Navy; Ensign itidgley
Hunt, U. S. Navy; Gen. Anson it. Mc-
Cook, member of Congress; Col. J. J,
McCook, the Hon. Thomas Murphy,
8. W. Knevals, a former law partner
of President Arthur; Abncr L. Train,
Captains Cuverville and Decamps, of
the French navy; Col. Hlomlcl, of the
French artillery; S. W. Taylor, Capt.
Ericsson's private secretary, and Geo,
H. Robinson, representing the Dela
meter Iron Works. The "Destroyer"
is u craft of iron whose hull, even us
she lay light upon the water, was al
most entirely submerged. When ready
for service but little of the hull would
be above water. The house, which is
situated well astern, is of iron, hut no
attempt has been made to make it im
pregnable, as with the house entirely
shot away the "Destroyer" is Just as
seaworthy and canableof performing
the work required of it. Below the
house it is as well protected as any
armored vessel afloat. Its dimension's
are no feet long, 11 feet deep and 12
feet wide. These unusual proportions
are to give her a high rate of speed,
and as her lines are exactly alike in
both directions she can move ahead or
astern with equal facility. The sim
ple horizontal engine of 1,000-horse
power resting on a surface condenser
of about H feet square, the hydraulic
ally controlled rudder, the novel steer
ing apparatus, and the torpedo gun are
all below the surface of the water, and
as they are protected by armored
plates of improved construction, with
a special device to protect the machin
ery from shots tired at the exposed
portion or front of the bout, her Inven
tor asserts with confidence that she is
Indestructible save by sunken torpe
does or boats of her own kind. A
frigates launch is larger than she, yet
the frigate itself in a contest would be
wholly at her mercy, for the immense
craft could not be bundled <]iiickly
enough to get out of the way of the
little death-dealer no more than can
the ponderous elephant esoape from
the Insignificant little fly that so ter
ribly annoys It. The armament of the
"I)estroyci" is a single gun situated
just above the keelson, in the forward
piijwof the boat, and its muzzle opens
directly into the sea, being protected
from the rushing in of water when not
In use by a permanent valve hung by
an elbow joint to ihe stem of the ves
sel, and which is opened or closed by
a piston operated at the breech of the
gun. Heady for use, tiiiscigur-shancd
torpedo consists of three parts. The
end which carries the liring pin Is of
brass, the pin itself being of steel, and
Its end cup-shaped, so that its edges
will cut Into whatever object it may
strike and thus be drivn back so as
to explode the fulminnate cartridges
which explode the dynamite placed in
a chamber Just In the rear, which, In
the size of projectile used yesterday,
is to contain 340 pound* of dynamite,
the largest charge ever placed in an
explosive. The remainder of the tor
pedo Is the customary hollow air
chamber of iron or copper, and to the
exterior of the rear of this are fastened
tins or flanges which steady the flight
of the missile through the water. In
order that the temporary value in the
(run's muzzle may not explode the
torpedo as It starts on its Journey a
hole three Inches In diameter Is left
In the wooden valve, and covered only
with a thin sheet of ruhherof sufficient
thickness to keep the water out of the
gun. Between t' e projectile, as it
rests In the gun ready for firing, and
the breech-block, is an air chamber,
where the explosive material to an in
ventor claims that it will do even
this. In the experiment made yester
day a dummy projectile was used;
that is, one made of wood and with no
torpedo In It. This was discharged
from the cannon by use of twelve
pounds of giant powder at a target net
of Manilla rope and wooden slats 300
feet distance. The muzzle was six feet
six Inches below the surface, and the
Smjectile passed through the target
ve feet under water, and appeared on
the surface 100 feet farther in shore,
and rode on the water at a considera
ble speed for 200 feet more, making a
distance of fIOO feet traveled in all.
The projectile, which was 2ft feet and
6 Inches in length, traveled through
the water to the point of appearance
no the surface—4oo feet, In three sec
onds, and this with a charge of but 12
pounds of powder. Tho gua to And
by electricity by the wheelman, who,
through his lookout, must aim ami
discharge the gun in accordance with
his beat judgment as to effectiveness.
Yesterday's experiment, which was
under the direction of V. F. Lassoe,
was pronounced a success by all who
witnessed it. It was the fifty-second
time the gun has fired the projectile,
and at no trial since the boat has been
put In working order has it failed with
the same charge to throw the dummy
torpedo MOO feet in three seconds or
less. The French officers were especi
ally interested in the experiment,
and though they at first pronounced
it an impossibility to operate a gun
constructed on such principles, and
with submerged muzzle, successfully,
as many engineers have done before
them, they were obliged to acknowl
edge that the theory had proved cor
rect. Astonishment was depicted in
every line of their countenances when
they saw the projectile rise to the sur
face beyond the target after having
traversed the distance from the muz
zle of the gun and through the netting
without making even the faintest rip
ple on the surface. Doubtless the
thought, as several witnesses of the
experiment remarked, "of what avail
are such mammoth and almost im
pregnable armored vessels us those
lying in the stream against such a de
struction dealing but Innocent looking
little craft as this "Destroyer?" Said
a naval officer at the conclusion of the
experiment: "(Jive New York harbor
a dozen such vessels, which could be
built at the cost of one 'Inflexible' or
'Duillo,' and we could successfully
defy thecomhlned navlesof the world.
Size and armaments can have no fur
ther terrors for a navy with a score ot
those little fellows, that a naval officer
would really feel ashamed to fire upon.
It seems to me the key to a comple
revolution in naval construction meth
ods. A Beet of cruisers with a couple
of these destroyers on board, ready to
launch at a moment's notice, could
tbid defiance to the most powerfully
Irou protected fleets."
Comment on Ine HraMft.
Washington, Dec. 6.—Comments
on the President's message among
senators and congressmen of all shades
of political belief ap|iears to be that it
is a very able document. Opinions as
to the correctness of its conclusions
vary, of course, according to paltry
affiliation and individual sentiment,
but there is a general agreement that
In clearness of style, dignity of tone
and force and freshness of argument
it is far above the average level of the
annual presidential messages for a
number of years, and that it Iu dica t e s
the possession of its author of a much
higher grade of ability than bus here
tofore been commonly attributed to
him. There has been some disappoint
ment among the Pacific coast repre
sentatives at the absence of any hearty
recommendation for legislative action
to restrict Chinese immigration, es
pecially as the president takes pains
to suggest that congress should care
fully regard the "interests and sus
ceptibilities" of the Chinese govern
ment in legislating upon that subject.
On the other hand it is noticed with
gratification that the message docs
say that legislation is necessary to
curry the treaties into effect, and also
that the presideutsigniticautlyf though
not so openly as might be desired i re
fers to the evils of unrestricted Chi
nese immigration when he says that
our government "views with concern
the etforts to seek replenishment of
the diminished population of the
Sandwich islands from outward
sources.
President Arthur's vigorous utter
ances upon the Mormon (question have
given unalloyed satisfaction to Pacillc
coast people and all other opponents
of polygamy, and will probably have
a decided influence upon the result of
pending contest in regard to admis
sion of Campbell as an anti-Mormon
delegate. It Isconsidered highly prob
able that the republican members of
the house will solidly sustain speaker
Keifer in the position taken by him
to-day in favor of Campbell, and these
combined will also, it is believed, be
re-enforced by democratic members
whose abhorrence of Mormonisiu will
lead theui to forego the possible ad
vantage of embarrassing the repub
lican speaker, which is apparently
the purpose of the opposition led by
ex-Speaker ltandall, so that on the
whole Campbell's admisslou seems to
be pretty well assured.
Tne president's message was gener
ally received with satisfaction and
commendation. Home di*ap|Miint
meiit was expressed that lie did not
more distinctly and definitely enun
ciate a policy. This feeling, however,
seems coutined to those who hope for
the domination of a faction of the
party. Republicans generally think
the president means to entirely Ignore
factions ami lo heal dissension, and
are glad be refrained from aa> iug any

they console themselves with the belief
