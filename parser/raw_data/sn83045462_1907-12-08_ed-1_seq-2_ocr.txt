TALK IN COMMITTEE
Why Chicago Was Chosen for
the Convention;
THE PRESIDENT'S ATTITUDE
Avoids a Flat Declaration That He
Will Decline Nomination.
UNCERTAINTY AS TO HUGHES
%
Closest Friends Do Not Know What
His Position Is?A Mystery
in Politics.
As "aftermath of the meeting of the .
republican national committee. there was
considerable political gossip relating to
presidential politics. After the din of bat
tle was over and the smoke cleared away
the politicians discussed the selection o 1
the convention city in an unbiased way.
However, it was not much of a battle
after all; mostly a sham battle.
"t"he fact is. the real Jeaflers in the re
publican national committee, and the men
who will manage the convention, wanted
to go to Chicago in the tirst place. But
Chicago was coy. and in her present stress
of financial circumstances was inclined
to drive a close bargain. The influential
politicians, thoroughly aware of the fact
that in the next presidential campaign
rnonej- will be hard to obtain on account
of the hue and cry against campaign con
tributions. were, also looking out for num
ber one. and were also Inclined to do a
little swappin' and tradin' themselves.
Hence the apparently fervid enthusiasm
in behalf of Kansas City.
Why Kansas City Wanted It.
Kansas City was in earnest and, as one
Of their delegation expressed it. "on the
level" in seeking the convention. While
there is no doubt that Secretary Taft's
friends in Missouri thought Mr. Taft's
boom might be advantaged by holding the
convention in a pro-Taft community, it is
also a fact that Kansas City and Mis
souri earnestly desired the convention for
oilier reasons. The business element,
democrats and republicans alike, wanted
to boom the town. The republican poli
ticians. as was so eloquently set forth by
Senator Warner in his speech, felt that
republican prospects in the next presi
dential election would be materially en
hanced by the enthusiasm created in the
holding of a national convention within
the state, and the attention which would
be attracted thereby to national issues.
After the members of the committee had
arrived some malicioud person started the
story that the selection of Kansas City
was an administration victory. It is not
known who dropped this fly into ointment,
but it is certain that it served to "turn"
a number of gentlemen. The controlling
motive, however, in the selection of Chi
cago is well understood to have been
utilitarian in nature. It was a question of
rxpense. convenience of access, hotel and
telegraph facilities and the like.
Among the members of the committee
and the other polit;cians who gathered
here there was no end of gossip on pres
idential politics and speculation as to
President Roosevelt's attitude. Many
prominent republicans who came to this
gathering have talked with the President
in the last two or three days, -nd reports
of these conversations have gone abroad.
Some of the most influential men who
shared in these conferences havs since
tokl their friends that they sized up the
President's attitude to be about as fol
lows:
The President's Attitude.
That his principal object at present Is
to avoid making a flat declaration that he
will not accept another nomination. His
purpose is said to be to keep the "reac
tionaries," or conservatives, as you
please, guessing, and thereby prevent
them from concentrating on some one
else. With the President making a final
and unequivocal declaration of his re
fusal. the. next step for the conservatives
would be to combine if possible upon
some strong candidate as against Taft.
It is said that the President does not
wish this, but prefers that the game
should drag along, the Taft people mak
ing hay all the time In the sunshine of
presidential favor, while the conservatives
were under a cloud of doubt.
It was said that the President is trying
to prevent any state convention f.-om de
claring for liim in a way which would
require him to answer. Tennessee pro
poses to hold its convention in January,
but the President hopes to be able to
stave It off until April, the month in
which Tennessee conventions have usual
ly beeu held.
Uncertainty as to Gov. Hughes.
There was a good deal - f uncertainty
among the leading politicians over Gov.
Hughes of New York. They cannot get
to declare himself and they do not
know what his position may be. Gov.
Hughes is the great enigma in republican
politics. He is a mystery to his closest
political friends, and these republican pol
iticians who are now jockeying for posi
tions cannot get a line on the governor's
form and condition. Some of them said
that for all they know he might do as
Mr. Parker did?decline a nomination un
less a platform was made to his partic
ular pleasure.
The best Judgment among leading repub
licans was that the meeting of the na
t'onal committee did not develop any
strong light on the presidential situation.
MINERS BLAME ROOSEVELT.
Will Call Congress' Attention to
Dispatch of Troops.
DENVER, Col., December 7.?At a meet
ing of the executive committee of the
Western Federation of Miners in this city
today it was agreed to levy an assess
ment upon members of the union for tlie
benefit of the Goldrteld strikers. The pos
sibility of securing a congressional inves
tigation of President Roosevelt's action
in sending troops to Goldfleld at the re
quest of Gov. Sparks of Nevada \v as dis
cussed. and it was practically decided to \
bring the matter to the attention ufCon- ]
gress.
"The action of the President in sending !
troops to Goldfleld was the result of a j
prearranged conspiracy between Wall
street interests and Gov. Sparks. ' uc
dared Acting President Malioney after
the executive session. "There was abso
lutely no need for such action It seems
peculiar, to say the least, that troops
should be hurried to Goldtield before the
sheriff had made any reque-t upon the
government tor aid. and without his
knowledge. This action is unprecedented,
and some ulterior motive is undoubtedly
responsible for the outrage. The federa
tion will render every assistance in its
power to the striking miners."
William D. Haywood, secretary, dec'ared
that the mine owners were themselves
responsible for the strike, and any trouble
that followed must be laid at their doors.
He said that the owners had violated
their agreement and ignored a compro
mise to which they had agreed. Hay
wood declared absurd the story sent out
from I/os Angeles that he had instigated
the strike.
SUNDAY LAW SPASM.

Citizens' Committee Gives

END OF A NIGHT OF STRESS
Armed Vigilantes Kept Watch Over
the City. ?
TALK OF A FEDERAL GARRISON
Washington Said to Favor Placing
a Permanent Military Post
in Nevada.
GOLDFIELD, Nev.. December 7.?The
first section of the train bearing United
States troops from San Francisco to Gold
tleld arrived at 12JO this afternoon.' Col.
Alfred Reynolds, 22d Infantry, who Is in
command of the troops, accompanied the
tirst section, and was met at the station
by a committee of citizens. A brief con
sultation was held, following which the
entire party stepped into automobiles
and started in search of a ?uit^bie camp
for the troops.
Was an Anxious Night.
Goldfield breathed a sigh of relief this
morning when the day broke without any
att of violence having been committed
during the night. It was feared on all hands
that, in anticipation of the coming of
the troops, last night would be taken ad
vantage of by the lawless to make a
demonstration. The worst fear was from
tire.- The wind blew a gale aJl night, and
the air was full of the first snow of win
ter.
A citizens' guard had been posted
throughout the town and along the water,
and light lines for several miles beyond
the town limits. The strain was tense
and few slept, awaiting the break of day
and the arrival of the promised troops,
which were scheduled to arrive in the
early moaning. The troops' train failed to
arrive on schedule time, and word was
received that jt would reach here at noon.
But with a bright sky ajid the troops only
a few hours away, a complete quiet came
on the scene. The streets were thronged
with people as merry as on a gala day.
Permanent Military Post.
In the Miners' Union hall, however, the
scene was different, for there the throrij;
-was depressed and surly. The hall was
packed all night and this morning the
street in front of the hall was full of
anxious and weary-looking men.
The operators and business men of GoHl
tield are pleased that this is promise of
establishment of a permanent garrison at
this point.
Such an assurance has been received
from Washington, where the advisability
of a garrison for Nevada has been dis
cussed from time to time. There are no
federal rtoops nearer than San Francisco.
The fact that labor troubles are con
I stantly breaking out and that there is no
state militia makes the necessity of a
garrison in Nevada all the more pressing.
The mines are in a condition to increase
their output tremenduously, but they have
been hampered and menaced constantly
by labor outbreaks. The stock market
showed a great advance.
PROPOSED RAILWAY CHANGE.
Three Passenger Associations Are
to Be Consolidated.
Special Dispatch to The Star.
CHICAGO, December 7.?The three pas
senger associations?Western. Southwest
ern and Transcontinental?covering all the
territory west of the Mississippi river, are
to be consolidated. Definite steps with
this end in view were taken today when
Eben K. McLeod, chairman of the West
ern Passenger Association, issued a call
for a mass meeting of representatives
from ail the interested roads December 12.
The territories served by the associa
tions overlap one another to such an ex
tent that for action in one the concur
rences of lines In the others must be se
cured. This makes the organizations in
terdependent, although they are pre
sumed to be separate and distinct.
Before the passage of the law relative
to the tiling of tariff and fixing the pun
ishment for violations of these schedules
the three associations were needed.
The new law, however, has slopped all
this. No new tariff can become effective
now until it has been on tile with the in
terstate commerce commission thirty days,
ami with none of the roads daring to cut
rates secretly there is little or no fric
tion.

NI6HT RIDERS' OUTRAGES
BECKHAM ORDERS OUT KEN
TUCKY STATE TROOPS.
Conditions in the Commonwealth
Worse Than Since the Famous
Toll-Gat^ Riots.
Special Dispatch to The Star.
FRANKFORT, Ky., December 7.?In an
effort to suppress the terrible outrages of
the night riders at Hopkinsville, the gov
ernor, J. W. W. Beckham, through Adju
tant Gen. Henry Lawrence, has placed the
entire state militia of Kentucky, consist
ing of four regiments, at the disposal of
County Judge James Breathitt of Chris
tian county. Gov. Beckham this after
noon received a telegTam from Judge
Breathitt as follows: "Night riders raided
our town last night, killed one man, de
stroyed much property; our civil authori
ties are helpless. Please order out the
state troops and act at once."
Gov. Beckham, in response to the tele
gram, ordered/ Gen. Lawrence to place
Maj. Bassett in command of the local
; state troops at Hopkinsville, and Gen.
Lawrence left Immediately for Louis

( kinsville tonight. Brig. Gen. Roger Wil
liams of Lexington has been ordered to
report at Hopkinsville along with Col. J.
Embry Allen, and every troop in the state
! will be called to Hopkinsville if It is
necessary to restore order and put a stop
[ to the reign of terror.
Other Places Raided.
Over the long-distance telephone Gov.
: Beckham was notified when lie went to
his office today that 300 masked men had
entered Hopkinsville, set fire to three to
bacco warehouses, entailing a loss of
$200,000, driven a woman operator from
the office of the telephone company, taken
out Lindsay Mitchell from his home and
threatened to shoot him if he did not
leave, and on refusal bound him to a tree
and whipped him until the blood ran.
Gov. Beckham at once ordered State
Fire Marshal Moit Ayers to proceed from
Louisville to Hopkinsville.
Night riders were active ir> Owen coun
ty. only a few miles from this city, last
night, when they visited the home of
Pearl Wllhoit and killed every liead'of
stock on his farm because he shipped his
tobacco, to Louisville, disregarding their
warnings to pool it.
Ten hogs, three rows and five horses
belonging to Wilhoit were fountTdead by
him today in a pile in the barn lot, where
they had been driven and slaughtered by
the night riders. Not since Kentucky was
torn asunder by revolution over the toll
gate raids have the conditions approached
| those in the state today.

Anniversary.
PLEASANT AND PROFITABLE
Organization Was Formed Forty
Two Years Ago.
SUBSTANCE OF THE ADDRESSES
Advancement of the National Capi
tal and Development of the
District of Columbia.
Meeting: inj celebration of the forty-sec
ond anniversary of their organization, the
members of the Association of Oldest In
habitants of the District of Columbia held
a banquet in the hall at Carroll Institute
last evening. The event will pass into the
history of the association as one of the
most pleasant and profitable of its as
semblies. There were delightful numbers
on the program between the courses of
the dinner in the way of entertainment
and several addresses were made-all
based on the basic platform of the asso
ciation. namely, the advancement o
Washington, the National capital, and the
development of the District of Columbia,
the home of the members of the organiza
tion. , .. Q
The dinner was served shortly after 8
o'clock. Rev. Joseph ster" fhe in
Eighth Street Temple,"pronouncing the in
vocation before the d'ner* were seated.
Just after the first course President A1
lison Nailor, jr., called all m??k"\oast
guests to their feet. a"d,a silent toast
was drunk to the President .of the Lnited
States.
Letters of Regret.
President Nailor read letters of regret
from Commissioner H. L>. West, Engnieei
Commissioner Jay J. Morrow, Maj. Rich
ard Sylvester, Crosby S. Noyes, T. C.
Noyes, Admiral Wlnfleld Scott Schley?and
Brig. Gen. John M. Wilson, U.S.A., re
tired. Regret and pleasure were com
bined in the presentation of all or trie
letters, rezret that the writers would be
unable to be present and pleasure at the
appropriate sentiments expressed. Par
ticular notice was given by the members
to the letter of Gen. Wilson, who, alter
stating his regrets, said:
"Please give my affectionate regards
to my comrades and friends who will
gather around the festive board and
tell them that were I with them I would
ask all to join in singing these joyous
words of Oliver Wendell Holmes:
" ' 'Tis yet high day, thy staff resume.
And fight fresh battles for the truth;
For what is age, but youth's full bloom,
A riper, more transcendent youth!
A weight of gold is never old.
" 'Streams broaded grow as downward
rolled;
At sixty-five life has begun;
At seventy-three begin once more;
Fly swiftly as thou near'st the sun
And brighter shine at eighty-four.
At ninety-five, shouldst thou arrive, _ m
Still wait on God, and work and thrive.
Patriotic Sentiments.
Responding to the toast: "Our Country
and Our Flag." W. H. Bennett declared
it would" be a very unworthy American
who could not at a moment's notice, how
ever briefly, give voice to patriotic senti
ments in speaking on such a subject.
"I think there are a few points about
our flag which should be remembered."
he said. "First, it is the oldest flt? In
the world which has remained practically
unchanged since Its adoption?and I am
quoting authorities on the subject when I
make this statement. Second, it Is the
most beautiful flag in the world. The
Chinese have dubbed Americans as the
'Men of the Flowery Banner. Walt Whit
man has said: 'It is a flag like the eyes of
WMr6nBennett closed with a delightfully
significant quotation from the pen or War-,
field C. Kerr. . .
"To those who have upheld the honor of
our flag," President Nailor called, and he
designated Capt. J. Tyler Powell to speak.
Capt Tyler referred to the fact that the
District of Columbia had averaged one in
every three of her citizens in sending vo.
unteers to the front in the civil war, and
coming down to more recent times he
spoke of the Impending cruise of the At
lantic squadron, under Admiral Evans, to
the Pacific. The captain ridiculed the pos
sibility of a war with Japan.
Walter Humphrey, basso soloist at the
First Congregational Church, contributed
a song. Other impromptu musical num
bers were given by B. W. Reiss. secretary
of the association, who (^closed himself
a pianist of no mean ability.
Response by Mr. Macfarland.
One of the features of the evening was
an address by Commissioner Henry B. F.
Macfarland, who responded to the toast:
"Washington, the Capital City."
"I am proud of my membership on the
honorary roll in your association, he
said "and 1 have carefully fended off
engagements tor this evening so that I
might join with you in celebration of your
forty-second anniversary In spirit I
have alwavs been with you in your con
tributions toward what has become the
world's greatest capital."
Mr. Macfarland referred pleasantly to
the annual observance of Fourth of July
by the association at Alton Farm, the
country home of Mr. Crosby S. Noyes.
And he addtd: "It is not strange that your
association has taken the lead in quiet,
rational celebration of the national holi
day. The District of Columbia contrib
uted more than its pro rata of men in
the war and its citizens have taken the
lead in 'giving of th^ir charity in great
national calamities. In everything which
makes for true patriotism, for the ad
vancement of the National capital, the
citizens of the District have ever been on
the firing line."
The Commissioner referred' to the fact
that the contributions of the American
people for the support of the Capital city
average 6Vj cents per capita, while the
citizens of "the District of Columbia each
pay an annual average of $16.."i0. Com
missioner Mactpxland t-oncluded with an
enthusiastic reference to the material
progress of the Capital city in recent
years.
A wid<> range of vocal accomplishments
was demonstrated by A. I>. B. Griffith as
he gave a number of imitations. lie illus
trated the running of a city trolley car,
drawing a glass o soda, steam callope in
action, a dog tight, parrot "lingo." bark- !
ing of a sea Hon. rooster crowing, cornet
playing and finally a typical back-fence
cat fight.
Distribution of Souvenirs.
While Mr. Griffith had the floor Secre
tary Reiss distributed among the mem
bers and guests copies of a neat little
folder, inscribed "Compliments of the sea
son." Below that legend appeared the
name of Allison Nailor as donor. A glance
at the folder furnished sufficient inspira
tion to L. P. Seibold to lead him to offer
a motion expressing the thanks of tile
association to President Nailor, and an,
instantaneous rising vote testified to the
popularity of the suggestion. The folder
was particularly appropriate, carrying as
It did the clan song of the association,
"Auld Lang Syne."
In response to the motion Mr. Nailor
said he visited Scotland last year, and at
the very time the association was observ
ing the Fourth of July at Alton Farm he
found the folders in Edinburgh and pur
chased them.
Maj. Sylvester being absent. President
Nailor called on I?ieut. James Hartley,
one of the guests, to respond to the
toast. "The Guardians of the Public."
The lieutenant paid a compliment to the
association, sayinp that It is such good
citizens as the members whose encour
agement go farthest in making the po
liceman's duty seem worth while. He
spoke of his chief, Maj. Sylvester, as one
of the most efficient police chiefs in the
world.

men, Mr. McCarthy said he had worked.
I Mr. McCarthy Rave credit to Mr. C. S.
Noyes and to Mr. Theodore \V. Noyes for
accomplishing many things of great value
to the Capital city.
Purely Washingtonian.
Calks of "Noyes!" "Noyes!" finally
brought Mr. Theodore Noyes to his feet.
He said he particularly enjoyed being
present at the meetink-of the association,
whose work had contained so much of
interest and attraction for him.
"This organization is purely Washlng
totiian," he added. "Its basic requirement
is such that membership may be attained
only by a residence here, which makes It
an association of the people. It develops
a special enthusiasm and a local loyalty,
A member of thp association must have
attained at least the half-century mark.
Many of them have passed the allotted
span, and one at least lias rounded/ out a
i complete century."
Referring to Washington as the greatest
field of histBry making In the country,
Mr. Noyes said: "What wonderful prog
ress have members of this association
witnessed. The passing years have seen
the development of the citizens themselves
?that spirit of getting together which
means progress, until the watchword of
residents of the District of Columbia
might well be 'All Washingtonians should
stand together." "

TAFT TALKS FREELY
j WANTS TO KEEP THE PHILIP
PINES?JAPANESE RELATIONS.
Special Cablegram to The Star.
BERLIN, December ".?Secretary of
War Tuft did not learn much about re
cent political developments in America
until lie reached here yesterday and spent
all his spare time In reading his corre
spondence and the latest files of the New
York newspapers. When lie had posted
himself as far as possible he smilingly
repeated his willingness to run for Presi
dent It he should be nominated. He
said he had heard nothing to indicate
that his chances were diminishing be
cause he was put forward as President
Roosevelt's candidate. Naturally he
declined to enlarge upon this topic, but
one of his party remarked with strong
emphasis:
"It is a mistake to suppose that Mr.
Taft is a creature of Roosevelt. If any
thing. It is the other way about. Mr.
Taft is remarkably independent, and lie
has otfe.n modified the President's views."
The Secretary reiterated his well-known
views on the Philippine Mitnation. Asked
if he thought the I'nited States would
give up the islands, he replied with em
phasis: "Not if T can help it."
? He repeated what lie had said before
eonce-rting the situation between the
I'nited' States and Japan, and added that
no importance would be attached to the
recall of Viscount Aoki. He certainly
was not recalled owing to any strain in
the relations between the two countries.
He further said: "There is a bit of fog,
but it can lie dispersed by diplomacy.
The sending of the fleet simply moans a
test which would have taken place if
Japan had not existed. There Is not the
slightest reason for Irritation, especially
remembe-ing that one-third of Japan's
trad'3 is with America."
Mr. Taft emphatically repeated his de
nial that his so-called mission to Europe
had any political or diplomatic object.
He said lie was going home this way
because it was just as-quick as by way
of San Francisco and Mr. Roosevelt had
urgently recalled him.
Judge Baldwin Dsad.
APPLETON, Wis., December 7.?Judge
George Baldwin, one of the wealthiest
land owners In Wisconsin, died tonight,
aged sixty-nine years.

r
NORFOLK, Va.. December 7.?The Pa
arflc-bound Atlantic fleet, under Rear Ad
miral Evans, is now rapidly assembling
in Hampton roads, whence the great fleet
of sixteen battleships will start for the
long voyage to San Francisco, following
a revlerw by President Roosevelt Decem
ber 16.
The battleships Louisiana, New Jersey

vailing on the coast, today passed Cape

The Ave battleships already In the roads
are filling their bunkers with the "picked"
coal sent from the Norfolk navy yard

in barges today.
The battleships Alabama and Ohio from
the New York navy yard and the Kear
sarge, which sailed from League Island
with the Georgia, all arrived during the
afternoon, and took up anchorage oft O'.d
Point Comfort, in line with the other ves

Kentucky From Boston.
BOSTON, December 7.?The Kentucky,
the last of the battleships to be outtitted.
either wholly or in part, at the Cliarles
town navy yard, for the Pacillc cruise,
sailed at noon today for Hampton roads.
Clearing the Brooklyn Yard.

liam P. Potter, sailed today for the

ton roads.

by navy yard employes.
MONEY CONDITIONS IMPROVE.
Week's Tendency on Wall Street Is
Gratifying.
NEW YORK. December 7.?The specu
lation In stocks has shown some anima
tion this week In the disposition to cal
culate the coming restoration of condi
tions from the extreme prostration of
the banking panic. Evidence of the re
establishment o - credit w:is found In the j
increasing disposition of the banks to lend
money, especially on call.
This was emphasized after the appear
ance of the controller's call for reports
of condition o?' national banks on Decem
ber .'t. The strung position revealed by
interior banks under the call was a ma
terial factor in aiding in the return of
normal banking and ? xcliange conditions.
The speculation Itself was largely pro
fessional, and the "ise in prices owed
much to the necessities of a largo out
standing short Interest, which was forced
to coves-.
In the bont} department there was a
substantial and encouraging growth of
demand.
BELL S NEW AIRSHIP.
Lieut. Eelfridge Enthusiastic Over
Its Dirigible Qualities.
BADDECK. Cape Breton, December 7.?
Lieut. Thomas E. Selfridge, I7.S.A., who
made an ascension here yesterday in Prof.
Alexander Graham Bell's new tetrahedral
kite Cygnet, is of the opinion that in time
airships will excite no more interest than
automobiles do today. In an interview
Lieut. Selfridge declares that the tirst ex
periment witli Prof. Bell's creation was
a success. The lieutenant said he had
complete control of the ship during every
moment of its flight, and he spoke with
enthusiasm of its dirigible qualities and
the ease with which it was manipulated.
His experimental ascent is believed* to
have furnished data which will be of
gr*at value for future trials of the aero
plane.
"By taking into consideration the pull
on the. flying lyie. the velocity of the
wind, and the angle of flight, we. now
know," said Lieut. Selfridge. "the power
that will be required of a motor to keep
the airship in flight without the aid of
any outside agency. It is quite practi
cable to construct a motor suited to the
conditions of aerial navigation and capa
ble of furnishing the necessary power,
and it will be only a matter of time when
the Cygmet or an improved machine of
her type", soaring on high In absolute
control, will occasion no more comment
to watchers from below than an automo
bile does today threading Its course
through a business thoroughfare."
INDICTED FOR MURDER.
Slquel to Crazy Man's Rampage in
State House at Boston.
BOSTON, December 7.?An indictment
for murder in the first degree against
John A. Steele, the Everett maniac, who
shot and killed Edward Cohen, president
of the state "branch, American Federation
of Labor, at the state house Thursday,
was returned by the Suffolk county grand,
Jury today. Additional indictments chang
ing assaultt with intent to murder Den
nis D Driscoll, secretary of the state
branch, and Arthur M. Huddell, former
president of the Boston Central Labor
Union, were found.
Driscoll was reported today to be mak
ing satisfactory progress, although his
condition is still considered dangerous.
Acting on an order given by Gov.-Guild,
an.l following a meeting of the state board
of insanity, at which the case was dis
cussed, ur. Owen Copp, chairman of tho
?board, visited the state hospital for the
insane at Danvers today to investigate
the circumstances of Steele's release from
that institution three weeks ago.
TO DIMINISH MURDER CASES.
Estimated 10 Per Cent of Italian
Population Killed or Injured.
Special Dispatch to The Star.
ROME, December 7.?The government
is making a half-hearted attempt to di
minish cases of murder and Injury by
stabbing. It lias been estimated that the
total number killed and injured by knife
stabs has been almost 10 per cent of the
entire population, and it is therefore pro
posed to enact a special law putting com
mon krtlves, razors and such articles
which are usually carried in the pocket
in the same category with daggers and
firearms. Any one found to possess such
weapons Is liable to four months' im
prisonment for the first offense and
longer sentences for subsequent" of
fenses.
The issue of permits to carry arms will
be greatly restricted and the punishment
for crimes of blood greatly increased.
The bill may be passed, tout there is little
chance that the law will become ef
fective.
Where Newspapers Slide Down a
Mountain.
Mount Washington, U.S.A., is a spot
much frequented by tourists, for whose
benefit a dally tourists' paper, known as
Among the Clouds, is published. This
contains all news of the mountain, and a
list of visitors staying at the hotel on the
summit. The newspaper is conveyed
down the mountain in a novel fashion.
Slide boards, one and a half feet wide, en
steel runners fitting over the cogwheel,
are sent down the mountain side In
batches of five. Each board Is provided
with a cushion on which sits a mar. and
his bundle of papers. The trip trc the
bottom takes three minutes, which repre
sents the average speed of a mile a
minute, and probably the newspaper boy
of the London streets would like to ollde
down a mountain with his papers far
better than he appreciates dodging cabs
or waiting at the corners with his "even
ing paper," says Home Notes. ?
France Will Send Greeting.
PAlUS. December 7.?Expression of the
regret of the French government that
Secretary Taft .was not able to come to
France while in Europe, as well as the
greeting of the republic, will be extended
to the Secretary by a representative of
the govrnment when the steamer Presi
dent Grant puts into Boulogne harbor to
morrow to take on board passengers from
Paris.
