Tlio Now York Tribune favors tlio
election of S. S. Cox as niu-nkrr of tlio
next Hmibi'. ISlr. Cox is one of those
horriblo "Utitisli frce-tradcis" about
which tho Tribune wno fo terribly
f lightened before tlio election.
Ex-Senator lirucu dculeH his report
ed interview concerning Blaine's Au
gusta speech. Tho Philadelphia Even
ing Telegraph in which his interview
was first printed, insists that Mr.
Brticu B.iid all that was reported and
much moro of tho same sort.
Governor Cleveland was recently
presented with a Newfoundland dog,
but displayed his good sense by de
clining tho gift. People who wish to
curry favor with the President elect,
by making him presents will do well to
bear in imiid that this is not a Grant
administration.
Mrs. Mary E. Grier, wifo of V.
Hayes Giier, of tho Columbia Herald,
and superintendent of public printing,
died at her homo in Columbia, last Fri
day morning. Sho is spoken of as a
most estimabla lady, and her bereaved
husband has the sympathy of his many
friends all over the State.
if auy reliance can bo placed upon
the figures as published in the Plula
delphia I'rcat of Dec. 1st, Blaiuo has
a majority of the popular voto of 08,
719, bv omitting tho voto of Texas.
Hut Texas gives Cleveland 128,021
majority. This gives Cleveland a ma
jority of 59,302 of tho popular vote.
The republican papers aro publishing
a list of Northern States showing a ma
jority of 402,302 for Blaine, and speak
of it as tho emphatic endorsement of
tho people. In 1880 Garfield had a
majority of 537,319 in theso same
states, or 131,987 more than Blaine.
Thus it is shown that in theso sumo
States Blaine lost ono fourth the plura
lity Garfield received.
Tho success of tho New York World
is phenomenal. Two years ago when
tho present management took chargo
of it, the circulation was about 15,000.
Only ono year ago it contained twenty
three columns of advertising. Last
Sunday it had eighty-nino columns. In
two weeks its circulation amounted to
over two million, averging about 120,
000 a day. Tho World is now reo
ognized as tho leading Democratic
paper of this country. By its maiked
ability it has well earned its high repu
tation. Next Sunday's edition will
contain 24 pages.
Brand Gives up the Contest.
Chicago, Nov. 30. Tho Times to

'damus proceedings, and he will now
make no effort to obtain his Rent."
The Times also claims that tho Dem
ocrats will make no further effort to
control tho Legislature, and that the
leading Democrats in tho event of tho
United States authorities stopping the
prosecution have promised to re elect
Logan as the United States Senate.
Ex-Speaker Eandall and the Cabinet.
Washington, Nov. 80. Joliny
O'Brien and Barney Biglin are here to

come for instructions in helping Mr.

Now York Letter to Ilo&ton Transcript.
A gentleman who is familiar with
the iut-ide workings of tho Republican
national committee gives mo tho fol
lowing as tlio tiuo story of how tho
Rev, Dr. Burchaid eamo lo act ns
spokesman of tho clergymen who call
ed on Mr. Blaino : "The Ruv. Dr.
McMurdy, u Prottstnut Epiicopaliau
minister, who uied to be Chaplain of
the Senate, but who is now without a
charge, came to tho national headquar
ters on the recommendation of John
A. Logan. Desk room was given with
tho idea that ho should keep in lino
with tho religious sentiment of the
country. Ho did his work well and
thoroughly. At the laBt visit of Mr.
Blaino to this city it was thought that
a reception to be given him by tho
clergy would be beneficial. I am not
euro that some ono did not suggest tho
idea to Mr. McMurdy; but at all events,
ho took solo chargo of tho matter, Tho
national committee knew nothing
about tlio ntt'air until the arrangements
were under way. It had been arrang
ed with Dr. Peck, a leading Methodist,
of the Christian Advocate, to deliver
tlio main address on tho occasion. lie
had prepared n speech, but after the
niiniMlciti assembled there were some

THE TItEATT WITH MEXICO,
During tho past year the increasing
goodwill between our government and
uiai oi iuexico has been variously man
it . i m.i r .
nesien. xuo treaty oi commercial rec
iprocity concluded January 20, 1883,
has been ratified and awaits the neces
sary tariff legislation of conijres to be
come effective. Tho legislation will. I
doubt not, bo among tho first measures
to claim your attention. A full tieaty
of commerce, navigation and consular
rights is much to bo desired, and such
a treaty I havo reason to believo that
tho Mexican government stands ready
to conclude. Some embarassineiit has
been occasioned bv tho failure of con
gress at its last session to provide
means for the duo execution of the
treaty of July 29, 1882, for the re-sur
vey oi tho lUcxicau boundary monu
ments.
Concerning foreign trade Mr. Ar
thur says : Ono of tho gravest of prob
lems which appeal to the wisdom of
Congress for solution is the ascertain
nient of the most effeclivo means for
increasing our foreign trade and thus
relieving the depression under whicli
our industries are now laumiiabincr.
1 ho secretary of tho treasury advises
that thu duty of investiiratiii'' this sub
jeot bo intrusted m tho first instance to
a competent commission. While fully
recognizing tho considerations that
may bo urged against this course, I am
nevertheless of the opinion that, upon
tho whole, no other would bo likely lo
ciieci speedier or better results.
IMPROVEMENT OY ItlVEItS AND ItAliUOItS.
The funds with which tho works for
the improvement of rivers and harbors
were prosecuted during tho past year
were derived irom the appropriations
of the act of August 2, 1882, toccther
with such few balances as wero on

Of tho various governmental con

EXTENSION OI' I'OREION TRADE,
In tho courso of this communication
referenco has more than once been
made to tho policy of the government
as rcgaras tlio extension of our foreign
trade. It seems proper to declare tho
general principles that should, in mv
opinion, underlie our national offorts in
that direction.
Tho main conditions ot tho problem
may bo thus slated : Wo arc a people

in invention ; wo cover a vast extent of

the civil, SERVICE.
On tho 29th of Febiuaiy last I trans
mitted to congress tho first annual re
port ot the civil service commission,
together with communications fiom the
heads of several executive departments
ol tho government, respecting tlio prac
tical working of tho law under which
the commission had been acting. The
good results it therein foreshadowed
have been moro than realized. Tho
system has fully answered the expecta
tions of its friends in securing compe
tent and faithful services and in pro
tecting tlio appointing officers of the
government from tho pressure of per
sonal impoitunity, and from the labor
ot examining tlio claims and preten
sions of rival candidates for public em
ployment, lho law has had thu un-
niahhed support of the president and
the heads ot tlio seveial departments,
and tho members of tho commission
havo performed their duties with zeal
and fielity. Their report will shortly
be submitted, and will be accompanied
by such recommendations for enlarging
tho scope of tho exiting statute as
shall commend themselves to tho execu
tive and tho commissioners charged
with its administration. In view of
tho general and persistent demand
throughout tho commercial community
for a national bankrupt law, I hope
that the differences of sentiment which
havo hitherto prevented its enact
ment may not outlast tho present ses
sion.
President Arthur recommends that
congress confer upon General Grant a

The Washington Monument,
As the Washington monument ap
preaches completion the authorities aro
thinking of emplov ing troiiwof movent
ing would-be suicides fioni jumping
fiom its top. It is now known that tlio
Washington banker, Squires, who com
niitted suicido last summer by cutting
his throat, ascended tlio monument a
fow days before his death intending to
end his lifo by jumping from tho top,
but found that the netting placed thorn
for tho purpose of protecting the woik
men prevented him from carrying out
his purpose. No lives have been lost
yet in the construction of the monu
ment, although there was a very nar
row escape from a fatal accident last
Saturday. Ono of the workmen by
the namo of Williams lo-t his foothold
from the inside of tho peak and fell.
Fortunately, however, the sleovo of his
arm caught to a largo nail which pro
jected from another scaffold ten feet
below the place from which ho had
fallen. Thus lie was left suspended.
Had the nail given away, or his sleevo
become torn to nnv oxteul, he would
nave oeen uasncu to uio ground, con
siderably over fivo bundled feet below.
When rescued it was found that the
unfortunate man had his wrist and arm

No General Tariff Legislation

Speaker Carlisle said to an Associa
ted Press reporter that it was not prob
able that there would bo any tariff
legislation nt this session. There is no
time, ho said, and the fact that a now
administration is about to como in
makes the democrats and republicans
alike disinclined to attempt anything
like a general revision of the tariff
now.
There will be, he said, some tai iff
legislation to carry the Mexican treaty
into effect will be"befoft) the houso anil
should the Senate ratify thu treaty with
Spain the hotiso will bo called upon to
enact tho legislation necessary to carry
una ueaiy into duct. The discussion
of botli treaties will, ho thinks, open
up tho general laiiff question and lead
to some talk upon it, but nothing fur
ther. He said that it was possible that
some attempts would b. inado at this
sci-sion to remedy certain inequalities
in me prtfeni tarilt, but it was too
early to predict the1 result. With re-pect
to any general rcvit-ion that should bo
made, when they came to .settle iiiiou
the details they would find such ,i dif
ferenco of opinion that months would
bo necesany in which to complete tho
work.
He was equally well convinced that
nothing would be done in the matter
of culling down internal revenue taxes
because should such an attenmt bu
made it would piecipitate the wholu
question of tax reduction. Speaking
of thu report of the secretary of tho
treasury Air. Carlisle expressed satis-
taction with the stand taken by Mr.
McCullougli on tho tariff nuestiou. As
to his recommendation that a new tar

You don't know what we
are doing in furniture. We
know you don't, because you
tell us so when you walk
through our rooms die first
time.
We are selling more fur
niture than any other house
in town ; a good deal more.
That is of no account, except
because we are new in the
business. W e've hardly ever
seen the dme when we
could handle furniture as
fast as we could sell it. That's
why we've kept so quiet
about it.
Our manager says we have
the best collection of furni
ture in the U. S. We thought
it a rather strong statement
until we looked about and
considered whom to compare
with. If we were to compare
only the very richest of ware,
there's a house in New York
ahead of us. If we were
thinking only of what is
commonly called " cheap "
furniture there are plenty
ahead of us. But, thinking of
a proper assortment for a
trade like ours, a trade that
demands good work of every
grade from "choap" to the
highest, where is another
such ?
Assortment is of some ac
count in furniture. It is easy
to have a large stock, and
still not have exactly what
anybody wants. Our buyer
is everywhere. He knows the
new styles before you see
them. And do you suppose
die largest trade in Phila
delphia doesn't get its choice
of goods ?
Two or three years ago
we told you that we were
actually making hair mat
tresses out of hair. It has
answered our purpose so
well that we have kept on
making them out of hair,
ever since. Some people
imagine that, because a mat
tress is sewed up that it isn't
going to be looked at, and
may as well be made out of
less costly material. Mattres
es we make ; furniture we
buy. We mean to buy as
well as we make. At any
rate we take the risk.
Look through our furni
ture, little and big, coarse and
fine. A buyer in Philadelphia
had better not fail to look.
The effects of our fire are
over. Stock is full. And
the furniture is such as you
expect to find where hair
mattresses are made out of
hair.
