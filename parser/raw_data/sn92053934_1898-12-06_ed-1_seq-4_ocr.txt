As a condensed history of the war
President McKinley's document is in
teresting and creditable.
Willis Hasklwwd retire! from the
county clerkship of Adams county
yesterday, after a service of a quarter
of a century. Mr. Haselwood was
banqueted in (Juincy last night.
Congress is already face to
with the duty of investigating
conduct of the war as far as
face
the
the
proer department is concerned. What
steps will be taken with reference to
the matter referred yesterday remains
to oe seen.
Conjiiei;in; the apparent fixed
policy of the government of the United
Mates in favor of territorial ex pan
sion leyoim the seas, there are two
recommendations in the president's
message to heartily commend the
earlv completion of the Nicaragua
canal and the appropriation of suOi
cient funds for .0 new battleships.
The Madrid papers take a gloom v
view of the outcome of the Paris cod
ference. A day or so ago they pub
lished long articles sadlv reminding
the country that "the day is one Ion
to le remembered as marking the
closing scene of a glorious colonial
' history. All agree that the govern
ment has adopted the only possible
policy, though mucu bitterness is dis
played toward the United States.
"The working classes in the United
States, ' said Senator GatTrev the
other day, "arc already suffering
from uncheckei immigration and the
multiplication of negroes. The north
is inundated with foreign cheap labor,
and the negroes, for lack of employ
ment in the south, are seeking asy
lums in the north anil west. 1 he ex
pansionists purpose to increase th
number of cheap laborers by adding
to our population ,OOO.OOU Filipinos
who are accustomed to work for 10
cents a day, to say nothing of the
thousands of Chinese coolies in Hawaii
and the negroes in Cuba.1'
A KKroiiT comes from the Citv of
Mexico that Clarence Key, grandson
of Francis Scott Key, author of the
"Star Spangled Banner,' died there
Thanksgiving day, and that prior to
his death Key and his wife were in
the utmost destitution. Key had
been in bad health for a year, but
managed to make a living as trans
lator and teacher of Spanish and Eng
lish. He fell while walking in the
street about ten days lefore his death
and sustained injuries which resulted
fatallv. He had resided in Mexico
about two years. He leaves a wife in
destitute circumstances.
President McKinley is nothing if
not cautious. While in his message
he goes properly into elaborate details
of the war and treats all who took
part with extreme nicety, he is careful
not to, bv word or intimation, include
his own views, at the present stage at
least, as to the future jolicy of the
government with reference to the new
island possessions. While the making
of laws belongs to the congressional
branch of the government, the presi
dent has the prerogative to suggest
legislation, and doubtless will be called
upon to do so as to all the important
subjects of our colonial possessions in
une course of time, lhat the presi
dent has a ti.xed purpose in this re
gard can hardly be doubted, otherwise
he would not hare gone to me extent

Chicago Chronicle.
The governor of Illinois seems to
proceed in the matter of political pre
ferment even in the appointment of
judicial officers upon the old-time
plan expressed in the familiar saying;
"Tickle my back and I'll tickle vour
back."
Judge Payne having resigned from
the superior lench of this cocnty, a
vacancy was created which for a year
was at the disposal of the governor of
Illinois. How did he use bis oppor
tunity? With sublimated sense of the
importance and the dignity of the ju
dicial office?
Marcus," said the governor in ef
fect to the colonel of the 7th Illinois
regiment, "Marcus, I had you under
arrest a few months ago when I was
cavorting around for the reorganiza
tion of the militia of Illinois, but I
prefer to be friendly with you and 1
will give you the superior judgeship,
but upon one condition. Marcus, I
will scratch your back if you will
scratch my back. I have a son-in-law
who is a democrat and I would
have you appoint him master in chan
cery." And Marcus' back having been
scratched by his excellency, Marcus
reciprocating to the full, says to John
K. Tanner, "It's a go."'
And so we are to have a new supe
rior court judge and a new master of
chancertvall through the operation of
his excellency's ideas of how prefer
ment should ie bestowed.

"Well, Caleb," fcaid Captain W. of
Mas.?arhn?etts years aco, "what will
yon alc a day to saw wood for me? I've
got several cords that I want sawed in
two iov the fireplace."
"1 should charge yoc about half
dollar a day if I had a saw, " replied
Caleb, "but I am t got none, captain
8o I don't see how I can accommodate
you."
"If that's all that's lacking, I guess
we can inunago it," said the captain.
"I ve got a prime new one, keen as
brier, and I'll let it to you reasonable.
Hot? would niuepence (12 cents)
cord do for tho use of "it?"
"I reckon that's a fair price, captain
I'll ho over in the mornin."
I3right aud early tha t next July morn
ing Caleb was at work, and he kept at
it so faithfully that he finished before
BQuset, when ha went to the house to
settle.
"Lot s Bee, ' said the captain, "you
were to have half a dollar a day. We'll
call it a day, although it ain't sundown
yet. That's 50 cents for you, and you
were to pay mo niuepence a cord for the

"How unfortnit," raid Caleb, after

DO YOU ALWAYS HONOR
A Person Who Telle the Troth? Rock Isl-
and People Praise Morrow's
Kid-ne-oids.
Someone has said. "Truth is Strang
er than fiction." We believe it. We
can write all day alout people who
have used Morrow's Kid-ne-oids, and
it seems easv, although thev tell of
cures that sound fairy like. But we
know thev are the truth, and that is
why it is easy to write about them
and still we feel that the storv is
strong.
If it were liction. we wonld not dare
to tell vou that Frederick Ficken,
retired farmer, residing at 619 Twen
ty-third street, had used Morrow's
Kid-ne-oids. and was now telling his
friends that thev were a wonderful
remedy, and were all the manufac
turers claim for them. You would
trap us too easily, xou would say
why don't you go off to California to
ret someone to lie about and not
come here where we know Mr. Ficken
We don't have to lie for a living,
Kid-ne-oids sell on their own merits
fast enough to make an honest living
and at the same time we realize we
are doing a noble work for humanity,
Mr. Ficken savs: "I was troublei
with rheumatism in niv back for
about ten vears. The pains were so
bad at times that I could not straight
en up. they would draw me over to
one side. I became so bad I had to
give up all work. I used plasters
aud liniments externally and took
medicine internally for it, but noth
ing 1 could get or do gave me anv
relief, until 1 got Morrow's Kid-ne
oids at Bahnsen's drug store, which
were recommended to me. I am still
taking the Kid-ne-oids, anil have no
doubt but what they will cure me en-
tirelv. as I am imnrovincr ranidlv.
Mr. Ficken is a very grateful man
and will be glad to tell you how much
he was benefited bv the use of Mor
row's Kid-ne-oids. Do not confound
Morrow's Kid-ne-oids with anv kin
of kidney pills. They are not pills at
all, but yellow tablets, which are put
up in wooden boxes which contain
about enough for two weeks' treat
ment. but are never sold in bulk
Morrow's Liver-Lax are very small
red granules and will cure constipa
tion. Both of these remedies are for
sale bv all lirst-class druggists, or will
be mailed by the manufacturers on re

Coronor's Jury Says of Will Kent Publto
Opinion lias a Change.
Carlinville, Ills., Dec. 6. The coroner's
jury which held an inquest over the
body of Xoble Kent, shot and killed by
his brother, William Kent, rendered a
verdict charging William with willful
murder, and a state warrant was at
once issued for his arrest. The mur
derer, who escaped immediately after
the shooting, is still at liberty. Th
Chicago and Alton road will offer a re
ward of $rW for his arrest. Public senti
ment is undersoire a change since the
facts are developing in the Ker.t
tragedy. Letters found on the dead
man and other letters go to show that
Noble was the worst hounded human on
earth.
Will wrote him a threatening letter
ordering him never to arpear on the
farm again, and saying he did not want
to see his face again, that his fa the
had said he should have none of his
estate unless he stole it. and he said
the same. A letter from Noble's mother
to him was also found, in which she
says Will would not allow her to coins
to Springfield to see him. Noble hud a
letter from his attorney. II. H. Cowen.
which the coroner refused to give out.
that is to contain facts which would
clear Noble of the attf-mpted assas
sination in March. Noble was telling
the sheriff of this letter when he was
shot.
