DISTRESSING EVENT
The Wife of the Connty Co rower fl te.be
Horeelf lo tbe Abdomen and Die.
Mrs. Emily Morfatt, wife of the coroner, has
been troubled some time with neuralgia, pains
in the face, and otber rheumatic affections lu
the back, which at length became so Intoler
able that she resolved to put an end to ber life
and her tortures at the same time.
On Monday, in tbe afternoon, she got out of
bed to allow tbe removal of some farnltui e,
and, going Into another room, at ouce seized a
very large knife itr carver) and plunged It Into
ber abdomen, without making any noise or
demonstration. Her husband went into the
room immediately afterward, and, taking no
notice of what nau occurred, sue lifted up tbe
bloody knlie and said, "Jim, I have slabbed
myaeU."
in a short time a number of neighbors were
in tbe bouse, to whom s .e said that she had
doue it purposely, that she was perfectly tan-,
mat she wauled to die, and abe had done ihe
deed wltn the intention of putting an end to
ber own lifa. Tbe doctor was in attendance
very soon alter the laual misfortune, aud at
ouce pronounced ibe Injuries necesaaiily mor
tal, tibe lived iinl.1 yesterday at tbree
o'caock, when she died, 'dquire kJliott,at the
request of the coroner, summoned ajary aud
heid an inquest on the remains oi the Ill
starred lady. After Uearlnu the testimony the
Jury, of which lha sheriff was chairman,
agreed to a verdict lo the effect that Mrs. Mof
fat I had come to her death from tbe effects of
w wound with a kuife, inUicud hy ber own
baud. Tbe funeral lakes place to day.
Coroner Moffatt has our deepest sympathy
lu this great and untoward aUlictlun. Tbe de
oeased leaves one child, a Utile grl three or

THE MONSThOUS ANO HORRIBLE.
Answer to MK. Explain fug; tbe Caoaea
ef tbe Condition of ine Lunatic
in tike County Jail.
We publish the following from General
Wright, In explanation of the causes of the
heartfelt appeal of our correspondent "J,"
who, In yesterday Appeal, very forcibly and
Justly urged the attention of the public and
our State authorities to IhecondlUou of the
lunatics confined In the county Jail. As the
sheriff is not to blame, and can ueiiher Inter
vene authority or help tbe evils complained
of, we hope the members of the Legislature
repreaenting Hbelby county will take steps to
remedy the delects of existing laws, and pro
vide for tbe Immediate relief of the moat
unfortunate of our helpless classes :
Edavr appeal I thank your correspond
ent "K,"for calling puLlic attention to a mat
ter tbat baa given me a great deal of trouble
In the adm.nistratlon of ihe duties of my
office. I refer to the fact of luwuie persous be
ing confined in the county Jail.
Under the present leguiaUuns of the "Hos
pital lor the insane," at ISasuviile, A np any
tou-,4 Is required tube given to the superin
tendent beiure any inmates can he received.
This is un account of the crowded oonuit on of
tbe hospital, the new wing provided for by tbe
last legislature not having been completed,
ine laws of tbe Stale provide that ail insane
persons wbo are llkeiy to do themselves or
others bodily barm, snail be committed to tbe
county Jail lor safekeeping unlii such time as
they cau be sent to me insane hospital at
aSashville. So that when a magistrate sends
me a miiinuus loi me committment of a luu
a tic or insane person, I am cmtpe led by law, to
bold the person in j.ll until In or she can be
received into the bospital at .Nashville, lu
several lnaia.ces disregarding the rules of
the btaie uospitai,) l nave seut insane per
sons to ISasbville to be recelvea Into tbe
hospital without giving tbe tulity
dav notice and lnsUad of getting
iuto the hospital they have teen cmlneu tn ca
Ltavuuon cjumtj ni, wnicn is not so comioita
ble as our Jail, and tbe bill for their support
baa been Bent and collected from bhelby
county.
In the case of the parties referred to by your
corresboudeni "K.." none i has beeu given tue
superintendent, and I only awall to bear from
mm to send tnem on.
It must be known to 4,K " tbat tbe Shelby
county Jan was ouiit ror tne purpose ol con
fining criminals, that It is not adapted eltnei
to hospital purposes or to the keeping of luna
tics: lb t uu proper provision l- made by me
authorities either lor clothing, feeding or
iodulbgany class of persons, except persob
chsi . ed wltb crime. Hence, whhe the t..u
f ict i mc to receive UhMctiuMuf persuti it maktt
no ai ran if men is ior men proper ii eaimeni .
By ibe i.ree-it law each county pays ail tbe
expenses oi lis o u iiaue persons, auu uu
inanity would dictate that he county author
ties provide sulLbie uuarters, loou and alien
tion in connection wiih ltspoorhouse for the
unfortunate class of persons during the time
tbey have lo await an order for reception into
ta State asylum, ibe party Bpoaen ol by
your correspondent a being in almost a state
of nudity, will not suffer coming to remain
on her. she is a ra in a maniac, and w hue .he
suits, and bis allauts du all they c.n
amwiiorate ner couuuion, Luey nave uu means
ol uroi er oontrol or Ueatmeui in such cases
as an ofilver of the law, Hhw Lditora, I
have bothimr lo do but to obev tbe law . 1 can
not iagiaiate. 1 agree with your correspond
ent that some other place ought to be prov Ided
for these people uutn tne county j,:., ana
tr 1st U will soou be dune; but as the law now
is. 1 can do nothing but obey It.
