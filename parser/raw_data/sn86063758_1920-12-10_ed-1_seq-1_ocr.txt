Washington, Dec. 7.?Both houses
of congress were in brief session tofr?
President Wilson's an-1
nual message. It was read by the
cTerks, Mr. Wilson having hfied the
advice of the physicians 'not to appear
in person to present his recommendations.
Galleries in both senate and house
were crowded. Both those drawn by
the chance that the president might
appear in person or by the possibility
that his message mjght touch upon

vate life were disappointed,
Mr. Wilson confined himself almost
wholly to domestic questions. Only
by inference did his message refer
to the nearing close of hi3 administraiton,
and that was in the concluding
paragraph.
The proposals he presented, the
president wrote, were not so much a
series of recommendations as a confession
"of the faith in which I was
bred and which it is ray solemn purpose
to stand'by until my last fighting
day."
Aside from hearing the president's
message, congress made definite
1 * y
progress on at least one of the problems.
it faces'during the brief session.
The; house received a rule under
which an effort will , be -made
Thursday to take up the immigration
| bill for prompt action. It would limit
general debate to four hours. The
two day interval was allowed to permit
Representative Siegel' of New
York, a member of tiie immif won
committee, to frame a minority report././,

\ / *
No other matter in either house
has passed today beyopd- the committee
stage. At both ends of the capitol,
however, members were deep in
plans to deal with business depression,
unemployment and farmers' relief.
Discussions in the senate of
the plight of farmers delayed thereading
of the president's message
in that body.
Progress Being Halted.
The industrial situation also found
?* J- ?
a vplace in tne president s luccoag^,
Recovery from war effects gave
promise of early completion "only in
our own fortunate country," said Mr.
Wilson, and even here "halts and is
impeded at times." A program of
"immediately serviceable acts of legislation"
to aid that, recovery "and
prove the indestructible, recuperative
force of a great government of the
people" should be undertaken, Mr.
Wilson said, adding:
- * !? -rwnrra jj
"une 01 witsc is jjiuiv H??v ?
great democracy can keep house as
successfully and in as businesslike
fashion as any other govenwnent."
First among the recommended
steps Mr. Wilson placed enactment of
a "workable budget system." He said
he had vetoed the budget bill at the
last session "reluctantly" and because
of "a constitutional objection,"
but as it was later revised in the
house, he believed it would, with other
measures, furnish "foundations
I ?nf;AnQl Vtnrlorof fiVStpftl."
JL U1 (X llai/lvnai
Mr. Wilson cited figures as to the
national debt and urged "rigid econj
omy," in which all branches of the
government should cooperate.
| "I can not over emphasize," he
said, "the necessity of economy in
government appropriations and expenditures
and the avoidance by congress
of practices which take money
from the treasury by indefinite or revolving
fund appropriations."
This year's estimates "strikingly"
illustrated the importance of specific
appropriations, the president added,
the transportation act "having dis-i
nnlofiAn Viotmoon PlITTPnt
IUX UCU MVVfr^vM
receipts and expenditures to the extent
of over a billion dollars. I
"It is obvious," the message con- j
tinued, "that these large payments j
have already seriously limited the
government's progress in retiring the
floating debt." *
The president renewed some of the
recommendation^ he made at the
""i"'"" n-f fVio loss f. sack inn. and
added:
"I do not feel it my ptMegfc

i In Congress
present to suggest the detailed and
particular methods by which these
objects may be attained, but I have
faith that the inquiries of your several
committees will discover the
wav and the method."
The only recommendations for oth- j|3|
er than domestic matters was that for
a loan to Armenia, to be administered
through American commissioners,
to avoid "further tempting opportunities"
to revolutionary tendencies
in that country, and for granting independence
to the Philippines "to
keep our promise to the people of
! those islands."

dominated by an immortal sentence

| A sentence immortal because it
embodies in a form of utter simplicity
and purity the essential faith."
of.the nation, the faith in which it
was conceived and the faith in which
it; has grown to glor? and power.
With that faith and the .forth of a na- '
tion founded upon it came the hope
into, the world that a new order
would prevail throughout the affairs
qfmaqlRnd, an order in which reason

j world be lifted out of its present con|

'which prevailed over the kicked

that the beginning of the end of

which, won "the war. Certainly this
is the faith with which our gallant 1
men went into the field and out upon
the seas to make' sure of victory.
Democracy Ha* Mission.
This is the mission upon which
democracy came into the world. Democracy
is an assertion of the "right
of the individual to live and be treated
justly as against any attempt on ;}
the part of any combination of individuals
to make laws which will
overburden him or which will destroy
his equality among his fellows in the
matter of right or -privilege, and I
think we all realize that the day has,
come when democracy is being put
upon its final .test. The old world is
just now suffering from, a wanton rejection
of the principle of democracy
land a substitution of the principle^
| autocracy as asserted in the name,
i Hnt without the authority and .sane
tion of-the multitude. This is the
time of all others "when democracy
should prove its purity and its spiritual
power to prevail. It is surely
the manifest destiny of the United
States to lead in the attempt te make
I this spirit prevail.
' !- 1-i.l I.L.
| . There are two ways in wjucu uic
United States can assist to accomplish
this great object: First, by of-- J
fering the example within her own
j borders of the will and power of de|
mocracy to make and enforce laws
' which are unquestionably just and
! which are equal in their administration?laws
which secure full rigbtto
labor and yet at the same time safe
guard the integrity of property and
particularly of that property which
is devoted to the development of industry
and the increase of the necessary
wealth of the world. Second, by
