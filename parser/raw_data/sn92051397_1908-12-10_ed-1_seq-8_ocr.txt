Tim attitude taken In a. newspaper
interview by Representative-elect Loos
of this city towards local revenue
n ftp J.i is a suggestive one, especially In
Its realization of certain essential
truths. In common with other Intel
ligent citizens ho unquestionably fav
ors a system of local taxation, which
shall yield the maximum amount of
money with the minimum amount of
pressure. Taking this .sound ground
he proceeds to consider ways and
means of Increasing tho sources of
revenue. The, taxation of Yale uni
versity ho passea over as Impossible
and Inadvisable. Ho Is at tho same
time Impressed by tho more or less
common view that the exemption of
several millions worth of property In
the center of the city not only de
prives the local treasury of a large
sum annually, but Imposes upon other
property owners, who need all the
help they can receive from a system
of moderate taxation, an undue and
excessive burden. This is not neces
sarily a sound conclusion because no
one knows what tho general situation
would be if Valo had never located
here or what Interests would be us
ing the acreage now given over to uni
versity buildings. In the second place
this Is not necessarily a sound conclu
sion because It falls to take Into con
sideration the amount of money, on
the one hand, annually put Into circu
lation here by the university colony,
and the stimulus, on the other hand,
which tho possession of Yale universi
ty Rive's constantly every New Haven
Interest. In the third place this Is
not necessarily a sound conclusion be
cause there Is no such difference in
the tax rate between New Haven and
other cities of the same size as would
warrant the contention that with Yalo
university taxed tho rate here would
be lower than elsewhere.
1'pon close examination of all the
facts It Is clearly shown that there
are many Influences for good which
offset the plain 'bookkeeping view of
what would happen If Yale was treat
ed like every other taxpayer. But
when Mr. Long proposes to Utilize the
iminenso amount of property' In this
city which Is Immune from taxation
as an argument why the general as
sembly should find a way to Increase
local revenues lie becomes Interesting,
He contends, for example, that the
local trolley company pays Into the
state treasury every year many thou
sands, some, of which at .least should
II ii rl their way back Into the local
treasury. Why not? The prosperity
which the local trolley company en
joys In almost exclusively created by
the residents of New Haven. Elimin
ate them and the cars would cease to
run. It would seem to follow, there
fore, that the residents of the city
should enjoy some share of the pros
ferity they create, Instead Of having
It used for the benefit of those who
have no 'hand In creating It.
The oyly argument wo have ever
heard against this plan of local taxa
tion In tho case of trolley companies
Is that they have become mostly Inter
urban Institutions, and that It would
he difficult to determine tho amount
each town was entitled to. We have
no doubt that a way could he devised
for the distribution of this tax which
would remove what Is theoretically a
difficulty. It would be easy to esti
mate what amount the trolley com
pany pays In taxes to the state based
upon the use of New Haven streets ex
clusively, This done, tho legislature
could pass a, law returning to the city
treasury, not necessarily all of the
money thus paid into tho state treas
ury, but a stipulated proportion of It.
This should be done In recognition of
tills city's moral right to it, since It
creates the prosperity of the trolley
company, rather than Its recognition
nf New Haven's hard luck because
Vali' is a tax Immune, In other
words, there Is tin need of lugging
Vale into the controversy at all excepi
fin- Illustrative purposes, and even
tlp'ii it would be lugged In with very
i in iuun hie effect.
i; have never felt that the state
hud a moral rltfht to scoop In the rev
rnues whlcn conic from trolley
sources. With the steam roads it. is
dtffnrenl; thay are s 1 1 1 1 j r t r , I by n
general class. The trolley roads, on
the other hand, 1 1 i . n I almost whol
ly upon the pn I rn ;m ? . of given and
fixed localities, which Is r-tmug.'i lo
justify Mr. Loos in undertaking In In
duce the ."tali' to reverse, or partially
modify !t.s jiollcy in this cimnociion.
We wish him sncM'ffi.
TIII3 r.t,F,C'T10 mil Mr.
It Is Important that the papers,
which were served yesterday on Cov-ernor-elect
Lllley, under orders of the
superior court, should he understood by
the voters of Connecticut. They do not
mean that a prosecution has been be
gun against that gentleman or that his
political enemies have entered upon a
campaign of persecution. They do
mean, as we Interpret them, that an
investigation is to be made of certain
statements and alleged acts In order
that It may he determined beyond a
peradventure that the laws of the state
have not been violated. !
The object of tho corrupt practices
law Is to protect the electorate against
practices of an evil nature which have
crept into American politics, and which
all good citizens must deplore. Unless
the Connecticut law Is to be arbitrarily
suspended, it should be freely used,
whenever the circumstances appear to
warrant Us use, to teach the danger of
corrupt political practices, on the one
band, and, on the other, to permit the
courts to Interpret its actual authority,
In order that If the law Is defective a
way may be opened for Its amend
ment. There can he no objection on
the part of any citizen who holds Hie
honor of his state higher than bis par
tisan zeal, to a rigid accountability for
every political act committed In the
course of a campaign.
It would appear from the surface in
dications that .Tudce Ilennelt has been
convinced by the petitioner that he has
In Ills possession evidence sufficient to
warrant an Investigation of the recent
campaign. Whether he actually has or
not can only be determined by an In
vestigation as provided for In the cor
rupt practices act. It amy be that this
evidence Is not of a character to shock
the sensibilities of the average man.
but It should be remembered that If It
exists at all ft Involves the honor and
political Integrity of Connecticut, It
Is a well known fact that political
methods have prevailed In this state
for many years which are contrary to
sound ethics and decent morals, and It
was In order to be rid of them that
the prevailing law was enacted. It
may be personally annoying to c.ov-
ernor-elect IJlley and the others men
tioned In the summons to be thus
brought Into court, but If they are in
nocent of the alleged nets of lawless
ness, the Investigation will leave them
stronger that ever in public esteem.
As for Mr. Fox, tho petitioner, he
deserves commendation for patriotically
faring barsh criticism and possibly
coarse epithets in order that he may
have it Judicially determined whether
slanderous tongues have Injured inno
cent people, and whether under any
circumstances the law Is worth the
paper It Is written on. He Is responsi
ble for the first election court 10 be
held In this country and upon Its out
come, whatever It may be, hang con
sequences of far reaching Importance,
for It will at once be made clear what
and Just what the legislatures and con
gress can do to enforce laws for the
protection of the ballot box. fn other
words, It would appear that Connecti
cut Is given the opportunity now to as
certain whether the stories of lawless
ness, which have been In circulation,
are true or false, which It must be the
desire of nil concerned to have deter
mined. Connecticut cannot permit her
self to rest under the Imputation that
her political lienors go to the highest
bidder, and we shall rejoice If Mr. Fox,
by his Investigation, shows that, there
is no foundation for this too wide,
spread belief.

I he Value of Thoroughness.
USEFUL men are trained men. They are trained
for something, though it be but digging. There
have been great diggers. They have dug their way out
of mediocrity to distinction. They knew that to dig
well a man must be thorough. Young men need to learn
thoroughness. There is no course of thoroughness in
the schools; there is no diploma for it; no "degree" of
thoroughness is awarded by the universities. A man
has to dig his own way to thoroughness. Few men do
it. The country is covered with machinery for educat
ing the young, but the deadening superficiality of thou
sands of young men who pass through these mills is an
indictment of the process of manufacturing what is
called education. Cincinnati Citizens' Bulletin.

n exh.-iu't ivo report recently made
by a special garbngo commission ap
pointed by Boston's mayor should be
of special Interest In this city. Al
though, during the cold months of the
ear. gnrbaiie does not seem such a
pressing matter, the fact must not be
forgotten that soon summer will be
with us aRiiln and with It all the
countless unsanitary and unhenlthful
evils which have long existed In New
Haven because of an iinteciuited and
iiiadeiiuate .'ivstent for iIoIiih away with
our waste products.
Boston has had Its garbage evils
commensurate with those of New Ha
ven. It was becanxe of them that the
commission referred to was appointed.
Its report urges th" abolition of the
present separate collections of tlic dif
ferent kinds of the city's waste (gar-
bage, ashes, papers, etc.) and the estab
lishment of a series of Incinerators,
capable of disposing of the conglomer
ate mass by one process. These should
he established at convenient places
about the city, which could he done In
view of the fact that, the Incinerator
process Is not malodorous or objection
able In any way. This recomniemlatlon,
It Is pleasing lo note, Is exactly the
same as was made to the hoHi'd of fin
ance by the sanitary committee of the
Associated Civic societies, after Inves
tigating the local situation and testing
Ihe various met boils of disposal.
Tlie reasoning of the Ilostou comtuls-
sion is not at all dlfllcult to follow. To
h;iV(, lmt on- colic
on of tlie city's
j ,., ,ly ,.,tv'M .
;not by contractors, has lis practical
Advantages, t s cheaper, In Ihe first
place, than the system of separate col
lections of garbage, ashes and patter,
which is file New York system. Then,
again, il makes It easier for janitors,
mahls and housewives, who avoid the
(rouble of separation, while at the
same time ihe thorough mixing that
these products not when thrown Into
ba rrels hell ex-skelter Is desirable. Oar
huge Is composed of about 8" per cent,
water, When, however, It Is mixed with
ashes a large per cent, of this moisture
is lost and the whole becomes far more
.susceptible to fire. The fact, too, that
inclnoralors are Inoffensive hiiiI thus
can bo placed anywhere, even In resi
dential districts, makes the hauls short
er and hence cheaper, and the power
generated from (lie burning mass can
be used locally in each community,
Tills important sHiiilnllnn iiir,nl ion
has no( been forgotten in New n
cn. Ill due time It will be brought up
again with renewed energy. The de
plorable conditions demand It. Mean
while, U Is pleasing to note that our
prlmo-movers In this mater have been
directly In line with tho experts elac
where. The time will come when New
Haven will have Its Incinerators too,
located (it intervals about tho city.
That tlmo cannot conio to quickly.

Kvory citizen must teallze the Inesti
mable Importance to the city of the
news that on January 1, the old Na
tional Wire company's plant In Kuir
Haven will open a one of the units of
the American Steel mid Wire company
iand that before long as many as five
thousand men will he employed at thej
blg factory, which will be approximate- j
ly three times the number ever employ-
other way most favorably situated to
be a great commercial center, the bet
ter will It be for the city. The fact that
the wive company will open such a
large plant here conclusively proves
that men who really know, realize that
furl. Knlr Haven Is nn Ideal location
for the big factory. So arc the Wln
i luster and the Sargent districts. The
fact that New Haven finds It possible
to
row In practically any direction, as
the number of the homes of Its work
ers Increases, Is In Itself of the great
est Importance.
If Ihe city Is on the point of a great
commercial boom, there must be uni
versal recognition within the ranks of
our worthiness. The coining of the
wire com ern Is a splendid beginning
toward that great boom. It remains for
all to pull together.
Kor the first time a president's
message to congress baa been llus

Impoverished wastes of China. Evi
dently the document was prepared
with great care and thought, which
precludes the Idea of the Hartford
