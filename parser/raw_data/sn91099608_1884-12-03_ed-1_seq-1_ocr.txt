Delegate Brents, of Washington terri
tory, hopes to secure tbe admission as
a state of his territory during the winter.
This is the advice of the Helena (Mon
tana) Herald relative to Dakota's efforts
to seeure division and statehood:
If the democratic house longer refuses
its demand, we would adviBe its peo
Die to adopt a state Constitution and
defy congress.
Tbe ninth legislative district, embrac
ing the counties of Barnes, Benson,
Bottineau, Burleigh, Emmons, Foster,
Grif?gn, Kidder, Logan, McHenry, Mc
intosh, Mercer, Morton, Bollette, Stark,
Stutsman and Wells, pave majorities for
tbe republican legislative candidates,
from 4,310. to 5,247. This district cast
8,532 votes for congressmen, giving Gif
ford a majority of 6,140.
About the first move made by Senator
Dawes after the reassembling of con
RreeswaBtbe introduction of a bill to
confer citizenship npon Indians who
abandon tbeir tribal affiliations and
adopt tbe habits of civilized life. That
is, those of the books who will abandon
tbe practice of killing and scalping and of
stealing horses and adopt some regular
and legitimAte mode of livelihood will
be given the privilege of voting, paying
taxes and running for office, besides be
ing guaranteed tbe protection of the
same laws which will protect white men
against tbeir depredations. As citizens
of tbe United States are permitted by
the constitution to drink all the whisky
they want, tbe scheme will become im
mensely popular among the Indians
as soon as they bear of it and compre
hend its fall scope.
Tbe telegraph has been reporting
briefly nu important suit in the English
courts, culled the Coleridge case but as
yet has failed to disclose the nature^of
th9 litigation. Lord Coleridge's
daughter, has an aosepted suitor named
Adams, who is disliked by her father
and brother. The brother wrote a letter
to his sister, in which he charged that
Adams was abase fortune hunter. Tbe
girl became indignant and demanded a
retraction of the charge, or she wonld
disclose it to her lover. The brother
persisted, and Miss Coleridge finally
gave the letter to Adams, who, without
any ceremony commenced suit for libel,
placing his damages at' $10,000. Ths
jnry gave bim verdict—the ]uJge«et
tbe verdict aside, being a sort of crony
of Coleridge's, and now the judge has
been deposed from the bench for his
arbitrary act.
The presidential electors of the various
states meet to-day, at their respective
state capitals to cast their
votes for president and vice president
of tbe United Stales. Under the con
stitution and laws, tbe electors, after re
cording tbeir vote, prepare and sign
three certificates of all the votes given
by tbem, each certificate to contain two
distinct lists, one of the votes for presi
dent, and tbe .other for vice president.
They wilt seal up the certificates,
and certify upon each that the list of
the votes given are contained therein.
The electors in each state then appoint
a person to take charge of and deliver
to the president of the senate at the
seat of government, before
tbe firBt Wednesday in Jan
uary next ensning, one of the certificates.
The electors also forward by mail with
out delay to the president of the senate
at Washington, one otber of the oertifi
sates. Tbo other, or third certificate
they forthwith deliver to the judge of
tbe district in which tbe electors assem
ble. Congress shall be in session on the
second Wednesday in February, suooeed
ing every meeting of the electors, and
the certificates will then be opened, the
votes counted, and the persons to fill tbe
offices of president and vice president
ascertained and declared.

The president's message, though
long and able dooument, has very little
to say upon matters in which the terri
tories are direotly' interested. He com
mends the present successful polioyof
dealing with Indians, recommends the
enactment of a statute for the punish
ment of crimes on Indian reservations
and tbe passsge of the bill eeding IB,000
squsre miles of tbe Sioux reservation in
Dakota. He advises tbe repeal of' tbt
pre-emption law and action "regarding
tbe lapsed land grants of variotfo west
ern railroads. Polygamy reoeives hts
attention anil the Utah case is quoted as
one which needs 'some vigorous legisla
tion. Tbe recommendation dr the at
torhey general is' endorsed- which asks
fora radioal ohanfee in the fees of gov
ernment witnesses and ttapayment«f
United States marshals and attorneys
by salaries instead' of by fees. Thttk
matters all pertain to every day life in
the territories, though many of tbe
states are likewise interested in then.

DAKOTA'S DIVISION
And the Effort. Being Made to Secure
Statehood—Borne Points on tbe 8Una*
tlon.
Falnud in the Chicago Inter-Ocean.
Pierre, D. T., Nov, 25—When the
smoke ot battle shall have entirely
cleared away, and the two great polities!
psrties of the country hsve readjusted
their relative positions, as administra
tion and opposition, Dakota will again
demand tbe attention of oongress and
the people of the United States.
It seems to he a growing, impression
that with the change of administration,
from republican to democratic, and from
Arthur to Cleveland instead of Blaine,
Dakota will stand very little show of
recognition -at Washington for several
years to come. Now, I do not wholly
share that opinion. Looking back over
the last three years, I cannot distin
guish the time when it was anything
else but up-hill work for Dakota at Jtbe
national capital- "Pity 'tis," but it is
too true, nevertheless, that tbe great
Dakota northweet, tbe womb of whose
territorial condition iB about, or at least
ready, to give birth to two vigorous
states, ha* been as much the object of
republican indifference as of democratic
jealousy and hostility. But for this
there woufd haife been two Dakotas, and
one of them safe within tbe union, be
fore the democrats bad-' again come into
possession of tbe house of representa
tives.
Facing the present, it msy:be granted
that the democratic victory will make it
the more difficult for Dakota to obtain
her rights.
Yet it does not follow either that Da
kota should cease for one moment to
assert her rights'snd push her claims to
immediate recognition, or th&t, beoause
of Cleveland and the democratic sweep,
it is altogether a hopeless case for Da
kota, at Washington, this winter. Cer
tainly there should be no less an effort
made to place Dakota right before a
democratic house and administration
than there would have been' with the
Slarch
rospect ot a -republican house next
and Blaine tbe president-elect.
It onght not to be Dakota's misfortune
that, north and south, she is strongly re
publican. Tbi6 is a free country, and
Dakota is •'a young man's country."
Dakota's claims for division, and -the
creation, ultimately, ol two states, are
not tbe partisan considerations of a
political body, -but the righU. of an
American population' under the
guaranties of the Louisiana, purchase
and tbe constitutions of, the .United
States.
Every movement for- sepsrste state
hood on this Boil'has been of a non-par
tisan character. In the'Huron and Sioux
Falls constitutional oonventions o! last
year democrats occupied the presiding
offices and were equally prominent with
republicans. Tbe baBis of every effdrt
towards statehood has been the soundest
and plainest of ""good old democratia
dbctrine."
Dakota should not cease to present her
olaims to congress and before tbe coun
try. Flushed with success, democracy
in power may be generous to the fault,
from a political point ot view, of admit
ting two Btalwart republican states.
Dakota can hardly forget that some of
her wont enemies have been, and are to
day, republican politicians and papers.
Among that class let me brand, right
here, tbe Chicago Tribune, that insists
upon the admission of Dakota as a
whole, and stigmatises those of her peo
ple, who desire division as a lot of office
seeking, selfish' and corrupt political
bosses.
Tbe right of a people to define- the
boundsnes of the state of their own mak
ing is tbe very foundation and corner
stone of tbe fabrio of popular, looal self
government, and is a proposition that
any broad minded man, be be democrat
or republican, will be reluctant to deny,
lathe case of Dakota, moreover, the
right was earned by the.oourage and en
terprise of a people who found this terri
tory a vast wilderness, ont of which in
the spaoe of but a few years they have
erected two great commonwealths. Shall
any fair minded democrat follow the'ex
ample of a guerrilla republican' paper
and say that thiB people shall not be
liermitted to enjoy tbe just fruits of
1
heir own labors, cspeoially when theirs
has been the work of civilization itself,
redounding to the oredit and benefit of
tbe whole country
Tho people of Dakota desire division
for the many excellent reasons whioh
have been enlarged upon more than once
in these columns and by the Inter Ocean.
With all due respect for the editor of
the Chicago Tribune, I submit thst the
eople of this territory ought to know
heir own business best, and I should
judge, further, that from knowing what
they really want tbey can be depended on
to insist upon having just that, in even
ad exact justice.
Da
Dakota wants'division first, and as a
matter of honorable compromise, south
Dskots will gladly waive her rights it
statehood for tbe present, oould she but
secure a separation from north'Dakota
in the territorial condition. .The' sep
arate territory would be the primary
step toward the aeparate statehood for
each of tbe two Dakotas, which is so
earneatly desired by the people of both.
The democratic noufe oould not do a
wiser thing tban to satisfy Dakota lor
tbe time being by making two terri
tories of tbe one. It should follow: that
np by bestowing tbe offioes upon resi
dent Dpkotans—democrats of -icoorsei
but men who wonld be more aeseptable
to the peopleof Dakota tb^n imported
politicians of the other party stripe.

is not unlikely that another four years

could no longer be put off, tbey could
aeeept the inevitable, and make consid
erable party capital out of the creation
of four new states in one yesr, to tbe
glory and everlasting credit of a deao

is the part of wisdom and of political
ssgaeify.
There can be no question that dsspite
the nnwillingneas-of any particular oon
gress to divide Dakota, this people have
only to Kmain firm «nd steadfast ln de
manding their rights—refusing to enter*
tain for a .moment the proffer of -less—in
order finally to succeed under 'either
democratic or republican administra
tion. Every year that rolls around, adds
immensely to tbe population, wealth
revenue. and resources of each of the
two free states thst, I tell yon, can not
forever be denied the sovereignty which
is their birthright.
Atsnyrate, whatever the democrats
ntay do, let not Dakota fail to be on
hand at Washington this winter with
her olaims that are ao justly beyond dis
pute.
