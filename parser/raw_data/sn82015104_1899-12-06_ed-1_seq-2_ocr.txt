THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President's messrage to Congress
is very long, of necessity, but it should
be read by all voters since it gives a
clear history of the* conditions of the
country and its finances, its relations
with foreign Powen-s, the needs of the
army and the na/vy, the body of the
suggestions of t'ae departments, to
gether with advicje which the President
believes Congrews should accept at the
present session..
One thing will strike the reader with
great force in the reading, the showing
of tha great, increase In volume and
value of our- foreign commerce, which
is followed. trj> by the suggestion that
our maritime interests still more need
the fostering stimulation of govern
mental action.
The ftnanci*_l condition of the country
the Presideja'C finds very satisfactory,
and the treasury is in a healthy condi
tion. He advises such amendment of
the national banking Act as will aug
ment th« volume of the circulating me
dium, and that the gold standard shall
be preserved 1 tti urges with emphasis.
The question of combines and trusts
is debated ti'eely as also the question
of raiLway i* jwJing. The relations of
the Governu,ent with foreign Powers
are set fortia as usual, and are declared
to be, in 1/ je main, entirely satisfac
tory, thougin there are some controver
sies which are excepted because they
are still u'asettled.
He renews his recommendation for a
commissi on to study the commercial
and indVistriai conditions in the Chin
ese Em pire, as the subject is one of
first anrd growing importance to us. He
urges that criminal offenses against
the treaty rights of aliens be commit
ted to> the jurisdiction of Federal
courts, thus repeating the advice of
President Harrison.
The laying of a cable to Manila la
advised, and that it should be done
under; Congressional action. The Pres
ident pays a high compliment to the
volunteer soldiery Which, served in the
Philippines beyond the period of en
listment, and advises for them a special
medal of honor. Of the force we have
in the Philippines, 905 are officers and
80,508 men of the regular army, and
594 officers and 15,388 mtn of the vol
unteer army. "When all forces now
on the way arrive In we will
have there 2,051 ofHceTs and 63,483
men.
The efficiency and service of the navy
are treated with high praise and the
condition of our naval force is clearly
stated with accompanying recommen-
datlons as to construction, armor plates
and advice that Congress deal with the
navy in the matter of appropriations
with extreme liberality. Settlement of
the railroad dfibts, the question of for
estry and the work of the Agricultuia.l
Department are referred to appropri
ately.
The presena. condition of matters re
lating to the Nicaraugua canal are re
ported; the 'Paris Exposition is com
mended; our relations with Germany
and Canada are specially treated and
somewhat fuJler than usual, because of
matters ret hssue concerning our food
product exports in the first case, and
boundary and fishery' questions in the
Other. Our new treaty relations with
Japan axe outlined and' a statement is
made of the settlement arrived at in the
matter; of the Samoan group undor
which England retires and the United
States is given; complete control over a
distinct portion of the islands.
Coming to the Cuban question the
Preaident repeats the disclaimer of
America of any intention to maintain
permanent control in Cuba, or do other
than restore order, re-establish, indus
try and permit the soil once more to
become productive under cultivation,
and when conditions are ripe to aid the
people In the establishment of'stable
tree Government. He believes excel
lent progress has been made in these
directions, gives the Cubans to under
stand that this nation will stand true
to its pledge to them, and prophesies
that the future of Cuba is full of bright
promise and rich reward for them. The
President in some detail enters into ex
planations of what has been done in
Cuba, what relief has been given to the
suffering, the state of the revenues of
the island, the disarmament of the
Cuban volunteer army, etc.
Considerable attention is given to our
issue with Turkey regarding recogni
tion of American naturalization, the
payment of just claims we have pre
ferred against the Porte, and touch
ing Turkish discrimination against
American products. The President's
tone in reference to Turkey is one of
annoyance, and indicates a desire that
issues with that country be brought to
a head.
In treating the Philippine question
the President gives us the history of
the war in the archipelago in a nut
shell, and exposes certain facts which
have not before been understood, one
of which is the monstrous massacre
and .extermination of foreigners along
with Americans, plotted by the rebels
and to be carried out on a given date
last spring. He disposes with empha
sis and in language susceptible of no
misapprehension, of the story that
Aguinaldo was ever promised independ
ence or recognition, and declares that
the alleged pledge and promise were
disproved before the Philippine Com
mission, by the very witnesses called
to establish it.
He gives in short, sharp sentences,
the history of the war with the in
surgents and of our acquisition of the
islands, and avers that the establish
ment of our sovereignty there was in
accordance with the wishes of the
great mass of the Filipino people.
Every possible precaution was taken
to prevent friction and conflict with the
insurgents, and the orders issued to
that effect the President recites, like
wise the proclamations to the people
setting forth why we had entered the
islands and for what purpose, namely,
to establish order, promote industry,
broaden liberty and better every inter
est of the people, affording them free
dom, and benefits such as they had
never known.
The President quotes liberally f rom
the report of the Philippine- Commission,
several columns of which report ap
peared in these columns on the 3d of
November. Upon the evidence before
him the President justifies the policy
of the nation in acquiring the Philip
pines, in holding them and in crushing
the insurrection, now on its last legs.
He points out that reconstruction has
already begun, and most satisfactorily,
as, for Instance, in Negros, the form of
temporary government there being
rather minutely described and at length.
It is gathered that the President is of
the opinion that this same form is
able for the most, if not all, the other
•islands of the grouQ.
He explains that in the Sulus we
have succeeded to whatever rights
Spain had, and that the authorities of
the islands have acceded to the change.
By this means we secure the allegiance
and allyship of the Sultan of Sulu in
'suppressing piracy, advancing trade
•and promoting industry. A beginning
■has been made in the freeing of Sulu
slaves by a provision that any slave
may purchase his freedom by paying
the market value, but it is specified
that the Government of the United
States in no way recognizes the right
of slavery or of Its continuance. The
I agreement is temporary, and is sub
| mitted to Congress for its action.
The President scouts the idea of
abandoning the Philippines. He vigor
ously declares that they are ours in jus
tice, by every title of law and equity,
and must not be yielded to another.
If we leave them we abandon them to
anarchy and finally to barbarism. They
must not be made an apple of discord
for the striving of other nations, no one
of which could permit another to seize
them unquestioned.
The President disposes of the sugges
tion of a protectorate over the islands
with independence to their people, as
unworthy consideration, as It would in
volve a cruel breach of faith, make us
tesponsible for the acts of the insur
gent leaders and give us no control over
them. It would place the peaceable
and loyal majority at the mercy of
armed rebels, and would charge us with
the task of protecting the insurgents
against each other and defending them
in any quarrel they might choose to
have with any foreign power.
The President calls upon Congress to
construct a plan of government for the
Philippines to become effective as soon
as peace is restored, In the meanwhile
the military arm must remain supreme.
In language at once eloquent and con
vincing the President justifies the
course of the Government towards the
Philippines generally and sets forth its
merciful, kindly and civilizing pur
poses. •*
Of the Hawaiian Islands and needed
laws relating to that possession; of
Alaska and legislation essential for its
welfare, and of Porto Rico and her
needs the message is clear and refers
important matters in these lines to
Congress for just action. In Porto Rico
he advises that civil government be at
once set up and self-rule be introduced
with education as the fundamental re
quirement.
The President in closing declares that
lynchings must not be tolerated, but
that the rights under law secured to all
men must be respected and protected.
He treats briefly of the classified ser
vice; refers to the approaching anni
versary of the establishment of the
Government in the District of Colum
bia, the observance of the anniversary
of the death of Washington, and closes
with expression of high hope for the
future under the beneficent purposes of
the Government.
The message is a clear, strong and
explicit statement. It Is but little argu
mentative, though it abounds with di
rect statement of propositions which
convey the reasons for them, and has
much advice in its lines. It is easily

undertrtandable. Is without ambiguity
and will be received as a sincere, sen
sible, honest and straightforward state
document, in which no sophomoric ef
fects have been attempted, and no tech
nical or involved expressions Indulged
in. The various subjects of the mes
sage will be treated Independently from
time to time, since we have here given
but the merest outline of the important
paper, with the purpose to inviting our
readers to that full and deliberate pe
rusal which every thoughtful citizen
should give to every,. Presidential
resume and every annual history by the
Executive and his thought concerning
the present conditions" and proposed
policy of the country.
AMENDING THE CHARTER.
It is useless to bemoan the defects in
the City Charter and still endure them,
when we have the right and power to
amend the instrument so as to correct
its errors. The original Charter mak
ers, known as the Board of Free Hold
ers, labored upon the work assiduously,
unselfishly and with high public spirit.
No criticism of them is intended now.
They could not forsee what has hap
pened. That was beyond human pre
science.
But experience being the great teach
er, the only infallible one, has taught
us the need for certain corrections in
our Charter system. Eight years' trial
of the Charter has made the faults of
the instrument clear and equally in
dicated what the correctives should
be. The "Record-Union" reflects the
thought of seven-tenths of all the
voters of Sacramento, when it declares
that there should be amendment of the
organic law of the city.
Fortunately the amendments neces
sary to more harmonious and success-
ful conduct of city government are not
many. They do not contemplate the
ripping up of the entire instrument.
On the contrary, they relate mainly to
better definition of the powers of the
Mayor and the perogatives of the Board
of Trustees. These two authorities now
clash frequently simply because of di
vided responsibility.
There is confessed need for reforming
the government of the Police Depart
ment and the better definition of the
powers of the Mayor, the Trustees and
the Chief of Police over that depart
ment. There is necessity for correcting
the error that keeps the heads of de
partments in doubt relative to the au
thority to which they shall submit re
ports. There is need for more distinct
separation of the executive, judicial
and legislative powers, making such
functions independent, and less mixed
in one or more branches of the city
government.
These are the subects upon which
amendment should run, and not many
sections will need to be recast to effect
the changes; Indeed, in many cases the
change of a single word will give us the
result so much desired, namely, greater
independence in the heads of depart
ments, and severance of jurisdictions.
How is the Charter amended? The
Constitution provides that it shall be
attempted not oftener than once in
two years. Amendments must be rati
fied by the Legislature. If any amend
ments are to be submitted therefore to
the next session, they must be put afoot
very early in 1900. Happily the pro
posal of the needed amendments will
cost very little. No special election will
be necessary and no cost involved
whatever, beyond that of advertising
the few amendments proposed, for
twenty days, the first advertisement of
them being at least forty days before
the election.
We will have a general election on
the Gth of next November, at which the
propositions may be submitted. The
proclamation of the proposals therefore
must he published on or before the 26th
of next September. The propositions to
amend must emanate from the Board
of Trustees, and it will take some
months for that body to agree upon
what it will submit. We take It for
granted that the board will reflect
the wishes of the people in that regard
and not refuse them the privilege of
voting upon questions they wish to
pass upon.
Three years ago the Board of Trus
tees was convinced of the need for
amendments. To secure a base c£
action it named a committee of its own
body and a committee of twice the size
from citizens, to debate and consider
amendments. That was done, the
work extending over some three
months' time. ' Certain amendments
were agreed upon by that advisory
body and adopted by the Trustees for
submission, but not within time to
submit to the Legislature.
The amendments most desired and
which further experience has proved
to be most necessary were not then
agreed to by the Trustees. But the
step was a beginning. It committed
the board to the proposition that the
Charter is defective, so much so as to
materially affect the economy of the
city and the efficiency of its several
departments.
In view of the facts, therefore, It
is not a day too early to begin to look
into the subject anew, since if it is not
done now and submission of proposi
tions made to the people next Novem
ber, nothing can be secured by way of
amendment until the Legislature of
1903. The Constitution requires a three
fifths vote to amend. Assuming that
next November the city vote will be
0,600, it will require 3,900 affirmative
votes to adopt an amendment, and so
small a negative vote as 1,321 will de
feat any proposition. The city, there
fore. Is perfectly safe in the matter,
and cannot take injury by the neglect
or the indifference of voters
It would seem that at the meeting of
the Chamber of Commerce this evening
this subject might well be taken up and
the beginning made for memorializing
the Board of Trustees, that through
such agency as it may choose to erect
the propositions for amendment may
be presented, discussed in the open by
the people, and when t, set is agreed
upon, that the same may be officially
considered and definitely passed upon
by the Trustees.

jects of Living News
Interest.
Los Angeles' Express: We have
grown into the habit of taking it for
granted that those splendid warriors,
Generals Lawton, Mac Arthur, Wheaton
and Young will get what they go after.
We can see now what telling blows
they have been striking the insurgent
cause in Luzon. But it must not be
forgotten that they and their gallant
forces have been undergoing one of
the most trying campaigns of the whole
war. When the full accounts come in
it will be seen that never have Ameri
can soldiers performed better service
than in Northern Luzon, under the
most trying conditions,
GULLIBLE PEOPLE.
Santa Rosa Republican: It is .re
markable the number of gullible people
there are. Smooth swindlers have no
difficulty in securing victims. When
they offer gold bricks for sale many
purchasers are sure to respond. The. re
cent occurrence in New York is a case
in point. Swindler Miller made prom
ises that every sane man knew could
not be kept. It was the most glaring
fraud of modern times but there were
enough people ready to exchange their
coin for his promises. His receipts by
Government money orders alone ran
from 55.000 to $13,000 per day. It is
estimated that he got several hundred
thousand dollars before his fraudulent
transactions were formally declared.
And the simpletons who put their
money into his hands think they were
entitled to Government protection. To
brand such men and women as incom
petents would not be a bad way to treat
them. This is about all the considera
tion to which they are entitled. We
are safe in saying that this is not the
first time most of them have been
caught, nor will it be the last time.
Such people seem to live to be fleeced.
They should take their medicine and
not advertise their foolishness.
MARE ISLAND.,
Vallejo News: With the California
delegation in Congress in favor of fair
treatment and good wages for the
workmen at Mare Island, there will be
a better chance of the Board of Wages'
recommendations getting a more con
cise and' impartial examination than
formerly. The wages should be raised
so the best mechanic on Mare Island
can get as much pay as the best me
chanic In the same line of work on
the outside.
MONETARY CIRCULATION.
Tulare Register: The monetary
circulation is increasing right along,
but hardly as rapidly as the
commercial speculators would like
to have it increase. There was an
increase of 15 cents per capita during
October and, during the twelve month-,
ending November Ist, the total in
crease of circulation in the hands of
the people and banks was increased 73
cents per capita. The speculative fever
is still in the blood of the people and
if they had their unrestrained way
about it they would have another panic
down on us within a year. Panics are
made by men going too fast and being
brought up with a turn when poorest
prepared for it. Let us progress, but
do it slowly and surely that good times
may last. That is the wiser way.
THE MONETARY PROGRAM.
Oakland Inquirer: The financial
program for the coming session of
Congress appears to have been agreed
upon and is* said to have the approval
of President McKinley. It contains
these features: Specific declaration of
the gold standard: legislation to pre
vent paying out of greenbacks after
once being redeemed, except in ex
change for gold; increase of national
bank issues from 90 per cent, of bond
deposits to full par value; and organi
zation of national banks with a mini
mum capital of $23,000
This program stops short of the gen
era] reorganization of the national
banks by doing away with bond de-1
posits for circulation and the adoption!
of a new system of securing notes by
general assets, which is the arrange
ment desired by the bankers. That
great problem is to be left to a suc
ceeding Congress
It is apparent that the Republican
party at this session of Congress should
do something in the direction of finan
cial reform—that it must do something.
The present program is a safe and
Judicious one and it goes as far .as Con
gress ought to go at the coming ses
sion. But it should not fail to go that
far; in the organization of the com
mittee and the programing of legis
lation it should keep constantly in view
these financial measures which are
necessary' for the safety of our mone
tary system.
It would also be well to add to the
program a provision requiring national
banks to redeem their notes In gold
and not in gold or greenbacks at their
option. The banks are always call
ing upon the Government "to go out
of the banking business" but they con
tinue to thrust on the Government the
burden of maintaining specie pay
ments, which they, the banks; should
help to carry. Some reports from
Washington say that the Republicans
propose to add to their program the
reduction of taxation on bank circu
lation from 1 per cent, to one-half of
1 per cent, but if they are wise they
will not touch that proposition, even
with a very long pole.
THE SOLDIERS AND THE MONET.
San Jose Mrecury: The inquiry made
by the "Mercury" some weeks ago as
to what disposition the Citizens' Com
mittee of San Francisco propose to
make of the balance of the large fund
raised by popular subscription for the
returned California volunteers has not
been answered. The surplus of the
$40,000 subscribed and paid in is in
bank, and In the meanwhile there are
many volunteers who are sick, and
others who are vainly seeking employ
ment. Not only that, but the Red Cross
Society, which, first and last, has ex
pended tens of thousands of dollars in
cash and supplies for the volunteers, is
compelled to make appeal for more
money.
The people of California have a right
to know why the money now idly held
by the Citizens' Committee is not be
ing expended for the purpose for which
it was subscribed. If there were no
sick and destitute soldiers in San Fran
cisco there might be no valid objection
to the proposed scheme of paying-It out
for some sort of testimonial or memor
ial in honor of the California volunteers.* 1
But, with all the painful facts before'
them, the public falls to comprehend
why the committee Is not actively en
gaged in relieving the distress and sup
plying the needs of discharged soldiers
who are lying disabled In the hospitals
or walking the streets in search of
something to do.
AN EXCELLENT BEGINNING.
Stockton Independent: The meeting
of the San Joaquin Valley Commercial'
Association at Fresno last week suc
cessfully cemented the federation of
commercial bodies of this great valley.
The association has become permanent
and there seems to be but one cause for
regret in the meeting and its results,
viz., the absence of delegates from the
four mining counties. The eight agri
cultural counties were represented by
wide-awake delegates and there was'a
harmony In the deliberations that au
gurs well for the future of the asso
ciation and whatever it undertakes.
The importance of this harmonious
affiliation and federation of commercial
organizations in the valley can scarcely
be overrated. In large degree the ex
tensive industrial and commercial in
terests of a dozen productive counties
are committed to the association. It Is
a trust that must be and will be hon
ored, for grave questions press for so
lution and the people will rely with
confidence on the energy of the asso
ciation to bring about satisfactory so
lutions The capacity and experience
°f P- A. Buell, who was chosen perma
nent Chairman, and of the other offi
cers of the association are a guarantee
that no effort will be neglected to pro
mote the development and progress of
every productive interest in the valley
and better the condition of every class.
BLUNDERBUSS FIRE.
Fresno Republican: The anti-Roberts
agitators would bring down more game
if they scattered less ammunition. It
should be distinctly realized that Rob
erts has an absolute legal title to his
seat, against which no contest can pos
sibly be sustained. To object to his
taking the oath at the beginning of the
session is only to send his case before
the Committee on Elections, which will
report forthwith that he has a perfect
prima facia title and is entitled to be
sworn in. To contest his seat is only
to bring an equally prompt report that
there is no ground on which the con
test can be sustained. The House 1?
the judge only of the "elections, quali
fications and returns'' of its members.
Roberts was elected and has been duly
returned. The "qualifications" of mem
bers are specified in the Constitution,
and Roberts has all these qualifications.
Since the foundation of the Govern
ment it has been held without excep
tion that neither Congress, the House,
nor any State has the power to super
add other qualifications to those named
in the Constitution. To break this
precedent would invite a chaos which
would be a far worse evil than Roberts
and all his tribe. A proceeding under
the forms of contest is therefore as
pointless as a protest against swearing
in. There is only one way to get rid
of Roberts, and that is by expulsion.
The House has the arbitrary right to
expel anybody by a two-thirds vote,
and it ought to expel Roberts as a
penalty to his State for violating the
conditions of its Statehood. If the agi
tation would concentrate itself on this
object it would be less ridiculous and
more effective.
DUSTLESS CONCERN.
Los Angeles Times: They may talk
about their wireless telegraph business,
their horseless wagons and their ring
less politics, but we wish the world to
understand that California has a dust
less roads company which is prepared
to lay down roads that are self-sprink
led and warranted not to blow around
the country, in any climate. Orders
for large or small roads filled with neat,
ness and dispatch. No trouble to show
goods. Samples of roads sent by mail,
if stamps are inclosed.
Why the Months Are So Named.
The word "month" is descended from
the Saxons, and simply means the tima
when It "mooneth." "January" is from
the Italian word "Janus," who was gad
of the sun and year. "February" is
from the Latin word "Februarius," and
means the month of expiation, because
the Roman,festival of purification oc
curred in February. "March" is from
Mars, the "god of war," and was the
first month in the Roman calendar. The
Jews began their year at the same
time, and "July" was "Quintilius," or
fifth month after March, and its name
was changed to July in honor of Julius
Caesar. "August" was "Sextilis," or
sixth month after March. In honor of
the Emperor Augustus its name was
changed to August. Septem, octo, no
vem, decern —seventh, eighth, ninth and
tenth —gives names to September, Oc
tober, November and December. —Mary

When Thomas T. Crittenden was
Governor of Missouri he achieved a
wide reputation for the p?rsistency and
success with which he pursued the
members of the notorious James gang
to their ruin. Since the dispersion of
these highwaymen the State of the "Big
Muddy" has been free from this form
of crime. Crittenden, after having
served as Consul General in Mexico,
has settled down to the practice of
law.
During his term as Chief Executive
of his State he had a colored hos ler
who was much in awe of his employer.
The man was apologetic over trifles,
but when the Governor's favorite horse
died one night the case seemed to be
beyond the man's power of palliation.
He wandered about the stable yard for
a long time, lost in thought. Then
going to Crittenden's presence he said:
"Guvnor, that yere black horse,
