EXPERTS DECLARE
SLOANE IS INSANE
Dr. J. M. Semple and Dr.
J. W. Givens, insanity ex
perts for the defense, this
IDOrning gave their opinion
that Sidney Sloane is now
insane and was insane the
time he murdered his
father. Dr. Semple was for
merly superintendent of the
Medical Lake asylum, and
Dr. Givens is superinten
dent of the Idaho state
asylum.
Neither expert this morning was
allowed to stale to what degree the
Iboy was Insane nor to characterize
such insanity. Attorney Robert-
Bon tried for more than an hour to
so state a question as to elicit this
information for the jury, but Prose
cutor Barnhart's frequent objec
tions, which the court sustained,
prevented.
On opening court this morning
Judge Huneke announced that the
jury is becoming dissatisfied and
come arrangements would have to
be made to hasten the trial. The
court said proceedings must begin
earlier or a night session must toe
held. Ho said the jurors had fam
ily and business affairs to attend to
and wanted to bo released as scon
as possible.
Prosecutor Barnhart suggested
that court convene at 9 O'clock in
stead of 9:30 and that it close at 6
o'clock Instead of 5, as heertofore.
Both the court and Attorney Rob
ertson favored such an arrange
ment and it will 'bo followed.
Proceedings opened with the
prosecutor picking to pieces Attor
ney Robertson's hypothetical ques
tion covering the case, which took
four hours to deliver Saturday and
upon which Expert J. M. Semple
was to predicate his answer as to
Sidney's sanity or insanity. Barn
hart read numerous portions of the
question which he desired stricken
for cause and Mid ho was not read
ing all his exceptions but was only
"touching the high places."
The court refused to strike any
parts of the question, saying it be
lieved that although some of them
were hardly admissable they would
do no harm and if the defense
would embody in the question tho
assumption of guilt, he would allow
the question to stand.
The jury was then called in and
Dr. Semple took the witness stand.
Attorney Robertson added to the
pert answered: "In my opinion,
Sidney Sloane is insane."
Detailed questions were then put
to him. He said his opinion from
these details was not shaken.
