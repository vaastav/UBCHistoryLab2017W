PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
iniid Annual Message of Prident
Giant to Congress.
Delivered December 4 1871.
Washingtox, December 4. The following U
the President's Mess;', this day delivered to
CongroM : To the Seu t aud House of Repre
enUtirea: la addressing tot tbirJ annual Message to
the law-nisliiug brauc.h of the Gorernwent, it U
gratifying to be able to Mate that during the
past year success has fc.euer..lly attruded tie
effort to execute nil the laws found upan the
Statute-book. Tbe poli y bu been uot to io
quiro into the wi-uVtu of laws already enacted,
but to learn their special intent, and to enforce
them accordingly.
The past year Jias, uuder wind Frovldcnce,
been one of gem-rl prosperity to tv uUion.
It has, however, been i:enJe.i with luoio than
the usual ch.istibt iuin'' iu lues uf ttte stid prop
erty by storm aud fiie. Tl en Jisi.-tera hro
served to oall forth the best tlem-nt a liuui.u
nature in tho couutry, aud to develop i Uiend
ship for us n the prt oi foreign n.tioni, which
goes far toward alleviating tbe distress occa
sioned by the calumnies. The bonevoleut, who
have so generously shircd their iMrnn with tbe
victims of these misfortune, will rop their re
ward iu the coriHi.'iousue of h iving performed a
noble uot, receiving the grateful thauks of the
Bien, women and children whose sufferings they
have relieved.
The relation of the United Sutoi with foreign
powers continue to be friendly. The year has
ben an evunttul oue ia witueseiug two great
nations, speakiu oue language, and having one
lineage, sottlin, by peaceful arbitration, dis
putes of long standing and liable at any time
to bring those n.tion into bloody and hostile
conflict. An exaiupla has thus beeu set, which,
if successful in its final issue, may be followed
by other civilized natious, aud be tbe final means
of returning to productive industry millions of
men maintained to settle tho dispetes of nations
by the bayonet aud broadsword. I transmit
herewith u copy of the treaty alluded to, which
has been concluded, since the adjournment of
Congress, with Her Britannio Majesty, and a
copy of the protocols of the conferences of the
Commissioners by whom it was negotiated. This
treaty provides methods for adjusting the ques
tions pendiug between the two nations. Various
questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. I
recommend Congress at an early day to make
tho necessary provision for the tribunal at Ge
neva, fud for the several Commissions on the
part of tho United States, called for by the
treaty. His Majesty the King of Italy, the
President ef the Swiss Confederation, and His
Majesty tho Emperor of Brazil, have each con
sented, ou tho joint request ef tho two Powers,
te name uu arbitrator lor the tribunal at Geneva.
I Lave caused my thanks to bo suitibly ex
pressed for tho readines with which the joint
request has been complied with by the appoint
ment of gentlemen of emiueuce and learning to
theso important positions. His Majesty, the
Emperor of Gyrmany, has been pleased to com
ply with the joint action of the two Govern
ments, and h.is consented to net as the arbitra
tor of tho disputed water bouudary between the
United States tnd Great Brittnin. The con
tracting put ties in the treaty have undertaken
to regard hs between thera-tlves certain princi
ples of public law for which the United S: itt-s
have contended lruin the commencement of their
history. Thty have also agreed to bring these
principles to tho knowledge of the other mari
time powers, i. til to invite them to accede to
them. Nooti itions f.ro going on as to tbe form
of tho noto by which tho iuviUtiou is to be ex
tended to the Powers. I recommend the legisla
tion uece.s.-iiry on tho part of the United States to
briug iuto operation the ar'telea of the treaty
relating1 to Uo liberies, mid to I lm other mat
ters touching the relations of the United States
toward the British North Aruericau p is.esious,
to beuoiuu operative us soon us the Drouer leiris.
lation shall bo had ou the part of Great Britain
and its position. 1- is much to b.' desired
that this li';.'i-: i, ; ;ii m y become op.-i itiv. l
foro thu liihtim.-u of :be United State-, luviu to
xniko their armnu'i rcct'tj fur the OMtniru' season.
Without exceeding tho numbor uf men or of
expenditures authorized by law, during the past
your, Mb navy has iu addition to iu regular ser
vice, supplied th.; i:;pii :md officers for tlio vessels
of the C i t Survty, aud has completed the sur
veys autburix '1 by Congress of the Isthmus of
Uarieu nnd Tehuiiatupeo, and, under liko au
thority, has -t nt out bu expedition, completely
funiifhKd and equipped, to explore the unknown
ocean of the North. Tho suggestions of tho re
port as to the necessity for increasing and Im
proving the material ot the navy, aud the plan
recommended fur reducing tho personnel ot the
cervici! to a peico standing, by the gradual bo
lition of eerluiu grades of officers, the reduction
of others, aud tho employment of some in the
commercial mariue, are well considered aud de
Bervo tho thoughtful nttcution of Conuress. I
also recommend that all promotions in the navy
above tho rank of Ciptain be by selection in
stead of priority. Tliis course will (-enure, in
the higher (Trades, greater efficiency, huJ hold
out un incentive to young officers to improve
themselves in their profession. The present
cost (if maintaining the navy, its cost compared
with that of the prcceediug year, and thu esti
mates for tie ensuing year, are contained iu the
accompanying report of tho Secretary of the
Navy.
Tho enlarged receipts of tho lVt Oflico De
partment, us shown by tho accompanying Ije.
pott of the lVtni.iMor General, exhibits an in
crease in that or inch of the publio service. It
is tho index of tho growth of education and of
the prosperity of the pr.ople two eleiuftnta
highly conducive to tie vigor and HtMlity of
republics. With a vat territory like ours much
of it hpursi !y j)(,j,ui ,ttcl. but all requiring the
eervioes oi tho mail, it is not at present to be ex
pected that this department can bo made self
sustunmn; but a gradual npproaob to this end,
Ir-.iu year to year, is confidently relied unon,
and IH d.y is ,1(,t f.r distant when the Post
UiU- e D.-iunmuit of the Governinetit will prove
h much great.r bl-jssintr to the whole people
than it is now.

imry'ed uon tho Executivo braneh uf i,e
Ovrnmcit the rxerutiou of the act of Cnu'rc..,
appiovnd April 10, 1'iTl, and comuiotily ktmwi,
as the "Ku-Klos lav." ia a portica of the Stat
! ut South Carolina. The necessity of the course
pursued will b demonstrated by the report of
the committee appointed to investigate the
Southern outrtget. Uader the provisions of the
above act, I isued a proclamation, calling the
attention of the people of the United State to
the same, and declaring my reluctance to ex
ercise any of the extraordinary powers thereby
conferred upon me, except in the case of an im
perative necessity, bat making known my pur
pose to exercise euch powers whenever it should
become necessary to do no for the purpose of se
curing to all citizen of the United Statss the
peaceful enjoyment ot the rights guaranteed to
thfttn by the Constitution and the laws.
After the passage ef the law information was
received, from time to time, that combinations
of the character referred to in thia law existed,
and vere powerful iu many parU of the South
ern Sutes, particularly in certain oountie iu
the Sta-.e of South Carolina. Careful investiga
tion w. a made, and it was ascertained that in
nine cot nties of the State, such combinations
wre active and powerful, embracing a sufficient
portion oi the. citizens to control the local au
thority, and having, among other thins, the ob
ject of de( riving the emancipated class of the
substantial WiefiU of freedom and of tirivileire.
aud the fne politioal aotion of those citizens
who did not sympathize with their own views,
Among theii operations were freouent scour?.
ings and occasional assassinations, generally per-
peiraiea at nignt oy disguised persons, the via
tims, in almost sll oases, being citizens of difbr
ent political sentiments from their own, or free
persons wbo had shown a disposition to claim
equal rights with other citizens. Thousands of
inoffeusire and well-disposed citizens were the
sunerers ty this lawless violence. Thereupon,
on the loth of October, 1871, a proclamation was
issue a. in term of tne law, calling upon the
members of tbe combination to disperse within
five days, and to deliver to the Marshal or mili
tary offioeri of the United States all arms, am
munitions, uniforms, disguises, and other means
and implements used by them for carrying out
their unlawful purposes. This warning not
having been heeded, on the 17th of October an
other proclamation waa issued, suspending the
writ of luibeas corpus, in nine counties in that
State. Directions was given that in the nine
oounties so designated persona supposed, upon
creaiiaoie lutormatlon, to be members of such
unlawful combinations, should be arrested by
the military foices of the United States, aiid de
livered to the Marshal, to be dealt with accord
ing to law. In two of the said counties (York
ana opartensburg, many arrests have been made.
At last account the number of persons thus ar
rested was 1G8. Several hundred whose crimin
ality was ascertained to be of an inferior degree,
were released for the present. These have gene-
rally made confessions of their guilt. Great
caution has been exercised in making test arrests.
Notwithstanding the large number, it is believed
that no innocent person is now in custody. The
prisoners will be held for regular trial in the
judioial tribunals of the United States. As soon
as it appeared that the authorities of the United
States were about to take vigorous meusures to
enforce tho law, many persons absconded, and
there is good grounds for supposing that all of
such persous have been violating the law. A
full report of whit has been done under this law
will bo suhmttted to Congress by tho Attorney
General.
In Utah there still remains a remnant of bar
barism repugnant to civilization, decency and
to tho laws of the United States. Territorial
officers, however, havo been found who are will
ing to perform their duty in a spirit of equity,
aud with a due sense of sustaining tho majesty
of the law. Neither polygamy, nor any other
violation of existing statute, will be permitted
withiu the territory of the United States. It is
not with the religion of the soli-styled "saints"
that we are now dealing, but their practices.
They will be protected in the worship of God
according to the diotates of their consciences,
but they will not bo permitted to violate the
laws under the cloak of religion. It may be ad
visable for Congress to consider whaf, in the ex
ecution of the law of polygamy, is to be the
stitus of the plural wives aud their effsprim;.
The propriety of Conuress passing an enabling
ant. authorizing the Territorial Leifishtture of
Utah to legitimttixo all children born prior to u
time fixed in tho act might be justified by its
humanity to theso innocent children. This is a
a suggestion only, aud not a recommendatiou.j
The policy pursued toward the Indians has
resulted favorably, so far as can bo judged from
the limited time during which it bus been iu
operation. Through tbe exertions of the various
societies of Christians to whom has been intrust
ed the executiou of the policy, and tho Board of
Commission authorized by the law of April
10, lbo'D, lasny tribes of Indians havo beeu in
duced to set. la upon reservations, to cultivate
the soil and perform productive labor of various
kinds, and to partially accept civilization. They
are being cared for in such a wuy, it is hoped,
as to induce thosa still pur.-uin their old habits
of life to embrace the only opportunity which is
left them to avoid extermination. I recommend
liberal appropriations to oairy out tne InuUu
peaco policy, not only beciuso it is humane,
Christian-like and economical, but because it is
light, ".recommend to your favoral consider -lieu,
also, the policy of gr.mtiug a territorial
government to the Iudians in the Indian Terri
tory west of Ananias and Missouri and south of
Kansas. In doiii so every right is grautt d to
th" Iudians by the tro ity.
I have addressed a communication, of which a
0 py is transmitted herewith, to the Governors
of Now York, Peunnylvanii, Uhio, lndiauu,
Illinois and Wiscousiu, urging upon the Govern
ment of those Statos, respectively, the necessary
action ou their purt, to orry into eifect the ob
ject of the article or the treaty which contem
plates the use of tbe canals on either side, con
nected with the uavialiim uf the lakes mid
rivers forming the bouudry, iu terms of equity,
ty the inhabit inis of both countries. It is hoped
that the importance of the object, and tho bene
fits to flow therefrom, will secure tho speedy ap
proval and legislative sanctiou of tho Stales con
cerned. I reuew tho reoommcnda,tion for uu appropria
tion for determining the truo position of tho
4'Jtt. parallel of latitude, where it forms tho
boundary between the United States aud the
British North American possessions between tho
L'tiie of tho Woods and tho summit of the
K icky mountains. Tho early action of Congress
in the recommendation named would put it in
the power of tho War Department to pl iei n
1 r-. i in the field during thu next summer.
Tho resumption of diplmuotio relations be
t eeu 1'r incn in 1 Germany has enabled tne to
give directions f(:r tie vitlnJr awal of tho r i -tectum
extended to tho Germans in France by
the diploid stio and consular rcpresrtiUtivca of
the United St i!e in thui country. It is just tt

been p.n'oiiut d I y the llifdsti r and tho Consul

alieo tlmi tbo fliuiidly fei liiwa ot that Govern
ineiit urn fully shared by the Uuited htates. Tho
r .tific it.,, ,, ijonuLu Hi,d naturalization
connection witn the Austria and Hungary Em
pires have been changed. I have been officially
informed cf th annexation of th States of tbe
Church to the Kingdom of Italy, and the remcv
al of the Capital cf that Kingdom to Home, In
eouforroity with th rtaMihed policy of tbe
United States, I have rroogui'd this change.
The ratification of the new treaty cf commerce
between the United State and Italy has been
txchaDgej, and tke two Towers have agreed ia
their treaty that property at sea ball be exempt
from rsptnre in cjse of srar between two Powers.
The United State have spread so opportunity
of incorporating ihi rule iuto the ebligation of
nati na. The Forty-fifth Congaess, at its third
session, made an appropriation for the organiza
tion of mixed commission cf adjudication upon
the claims of the ritizeus of tbe United States
ai;aiat Spain, growing out of the insurrection in
Cuba. That Commission has since been organ
ired. I transmit herewith tie correspondense
relailuii to IL- ionnation and its jurisdiction. It
is', '.x hoped thti this commission will afford
tl. ' .aim .tits i complete remedy for their in
juri. .
It lias K on madi the agreeable duty ot the
United States to preside over a conference at
aihmuton, between the pleaitpotentisries of
Sn..in and the allied South American Republios,
which hasiemlted iu an armistice, with the
reasonable assurance of a permanent peace.
The intimate and friendly relations which
hve so long existed between the United States
r.d Russia continues undisturbed. The visit oi
the third ton of the Russian Emperor is a proof
that there is no dei-ire ou the part of his Govern
ment to diminish the cordiality of those rela
tions. The hospitable reception which has been
given to the Grud Duke is a proof that on our
side we share tbe wishes of that Government.
The inexcusable course of the Russian Minister
at Washington rendered it necessary to ask for
his recall, and to decline to longer receive that
f unctiouary as a diplomatic representative,. It
was impossible, witn self-respect, or with a just
regard to the dignity of the country, to permit
Mr. Catacazy to hold interviews with this Gov
ernment after his abuse of Government officials
and during his presistent interference, through
various means, with the relations between the
United States and other Powers. In acaordance
with my wishes, our Government has been re
lieved from further intercourse with Mr. Cata
cazy, and the management of the affairs of the
Imperial nation has passed into the hands of a
gentleman entirely unobjectionable.
With Japnn we continue to maintain intimate
relations. The Cabinet of the Mikado has, sines
the close of the last session of Congress, selected
citizens of the United States to serve in offices of
importance in several departments of the Gov
ernmint. I have reason to think that this selec
tion is due to an appreciation of the disinterest
edness of the policy which the United States
have pursued toward Japan, it is our desire to
continue to maintain this disinterested and just
polioy with China as well as Japan. The corres
pondence transmitted herewith shows that there
is no disposition on the part of this Government
to swerv6 from its established course.
Prompted by a desire to put an end to the
barbirous treatment of our ship-recked sailors at
the Corean coast, I instructed our Minister at
Pckin to endeavor to conclude a convention with
Corea for securing the safety and humane treat
ment of such mariners. Admiral Rogers was in
structed to accompany him with a sufficient
force to protect him in case of need. A small
surveying party sent out, on reaching the coast,
was treacherously attacked at a disadvantage.
Ample opportunity was tiven for explanation
and apalogy for the insult. Neither came, A
force waa then landed. After an arduous march
over a rugged and diffioult country, the forts
from whioh the outrages Imd beeu committed
were galUutly assaulted, and were destroyed.
Having thus punished the criminals, and having
vindicated the honor of the flg, the expedition
returned, finding it impnttible under the cir
cumstances to conclude tho desired convention.
I respectful' refer to the correspondence relett
ing thereto, hero with submitted, and leave the
subject for such action is Congress may see fit to
take.
The uitional debt has been reduced to ths ex
tent of $V'J,lo7,12C Sii during the year, and by
tho nivtiitiuu of national bouds at a lower rata
of interest, tho interest ou the public debt has
been so far diminished that now ttiH sum to be
raised for interest account is nearly $17,000,000
less than on the first of Mirch, lS(i9. It wus
highly desirable that, this rapid diminution
should take place, both to strengthen tho credit
of tho couutry and to convince it. titizeu of
their ability to entire meet every dollar of liabil
ity without bankrupting them ; but In view of
the accomplishment ot these desirable ends, of
tho rapid development of the resources of the
country, its increasing ability to meet the laro
dem iuds, and tho umount already p-tid, it is not
desirable that the present resource of tho couutry
should be continue to be taxed in order to con-
tiuuo this rapid payment I therefore recorn
mend a modification of both the tariff nd inter
nal tax laws. I recommend that all taxes from
internal nources bs abolished, except those ou
spirituous wiuea and unit liquors, tobacco in its
various forms, and from stamps. In readjusting
tho tariff I suggest thai a careful estimate be
m h a 3 of the amouut of surplus revenue collected
undnr the present law after providing for the
current expeuses of the Government, the inter
est account, aud u sinking fund, and that thin
surplus be reduced in such manuer as to afford
the greatest relict to the greatest number, lucre
urn many articles not produced at borne, snob as
mediciue and compound essences, from which
very little revenue is desired, but which enter
into gener 1 ue. All such articles I recommend
to bs placed o'i the freo list. Should a further
reduction prove advisable, I would recommend
that it be made up ou those articles which can
be. r it without disturbing homo production or
reducing tin wiis of American libor. I havo
Lot entered into tiurs, because to do ho would
be to repeat all that is laid before you in tho re
port of tho Secretary of the Treasury.
Tho present laws for collecting tbe revouu s
pay the Collectors of Customs small salaries, but
provide for shares in all seizures, which at tho
principal ports of entry particularly raise the
componsition of theso officials to a large sum.
It has always seemed to mo as if this system
must at times work perniciously. It holds out
inducement to dishonest men, should such gt
pt)!;(.ssi ?i of those offices, to be lax in their
scrutiny of goods entered, to enablo them finally
to in.iko Ihxjkb seizure. Your attention is re
spectfully invited to this subject.
Continued iluctuitioim in tho value of gold,
compared with tho n ition.'l currency, h is a
most da:nnt:iriii itl'ecl upon tho increase and de
velopment of the toii'.ti y iu keeping up prices of
nil artielci nece-siiry in everydi.y life. It fosters
u "pirit : hruin.iling prejudicial ulike to
u itimial moi'i Is iiH'l tho uutio'ial filiations. If the
qo.istiiu can bo met, us to how t" Ket a fixed
value to our currency, that value constantly and
uniformly iippruachiug par with specie, u very
desirable object will bu gained.
For the iipelntie.lis of ilia Ullliy in tho plist
yi- .r, Micexpeii.su cf m lintainiug it, tho esti
mates lor tlie ensuing yer, and for continuing
se.i coast and other improvements conducted un
der the supirvision ot the War Department, I
ret', r you to the hccoiiiJ) myiiig report of tho Sec
retary ot War. I o-ill your attention to tho pro
viei. na of the act of Congress npprovvd March U,
18(1!), which ili'it oiitiniies promotions in tho staff
enrp- of the army until provided for by law. I
lecoiumti 1 that c iiuiiil cr of officers incaoh
-rudu of the stiili corps t c fixed, nnd that when
ever tho i.i. tub r in unv ni.c urane fills below tho
number so fixed, that the vacaaer may be filled
by promotion from the rs4 below. I sJan
leeosnmend that when the office of chief 0f a
corps becomes vacant, th place may bo filled by
election from the corps in whioh tho vacancy
exists.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows
an improvement in the number and efficiency of
the naval force, without material increase in the
expense of supporting it This ia dno to tho
policy which has been adopted, and ia being ex
tended as fast as our material will admit, of
using smaller vessels as cruisers on tho several
stations. By these means we have been enabled
to occupy at once a -larger extent of cruising
gronnd, to visit more .'requently the posts where
the presence of oujr flag is desirable, and gener
ally to discharo-e more efficiently the appropriate
duties of the navy in time of peace.
It has been the aim ef the Administration to
enforce honesty and efficiency in all publio af
fairs. Every publio servant who has violated
the trust placed in him has been proceeded
against with all the rigor of tho law. If bad
men havo secured plaoes, it bas been the fault of
the system established by law and custom for
making appointments, or the fault of those who
recommended for Government positions persons
not sufficiently known to them personally, tr who
give letters endorsing the character of office
seekers, without a proper sense of the grave re
spoasibilities whioh such a course devslpes npon
them. A Civil Service Reform whioh can cor
reot this abuse Is much desired. In mercantile
pursuits the business man who gives a letter of
recommendation to a friend to enable him to ob
tain credit from a stranger, is regarded as
morally responsible for the integrity of his
friend, and his ability to meet his obligations.
A reformation which would enforce this princi
ple against all endorsers of persons for public
place, would insure great cautiea iu making
recommendations. A salutary lesson has been
tauttht the careless and the dishonest servants in
the great number of prosecutions and convic
tions of the last two years. It is gratifying to
notice the favorable change whioh is taking
place throughout the country in bringing te
punishment those who have proved recreant to
the trusts confided to them, and in elevating to
publio office none but those who possess the con
fidence of the honest and virtuous, who, it will
always be found, compiise the majority of the
community in which they live. In my Message
to Cengress, one year ago, I urgently recommen
ded a reform in the oivil service of the coun
try. In conformity wiih that recommendation,
Congress, in the ninth section of an act making
appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the
Government and for other purposes, approved
March 3, 1871, gave the necessary authority to
ths Executive to icauxrate a civil service re
form, and placed upon him the responsibility of
doing so. Under authority of said act, I con
vened a board of gentlemen eminently qualified
for the work, to devise rules and regulations to
effect the needed reform. Their labors are not
yet completed, but it is believed that they will
succeed iu devising apian which can be adopted,
to the grest relief of tne Executive, the heads of
Departments and m-mbers of Congress, and
which will redound to the true interest f the
publio service. At all events tbe experiment
shall have a fair trial.
Under the provisions of the act of Congress,
approved February 21, 171, a Territorial Gov
ernment was organized in the District of Col
lumbis. Its results have thus f r tully realized
the sxpectatious of its advocates. Under the di
rection of the territorial officers, a system Cf im
provements has been inauguratod, by which
Washington is rapidly becoming a city worthy
of tbe national capital, the citizens of the district
having voluuUiily taxed themselves to Urge
amount, for the purpose of contributing to the
advaucemeut of the seat of Government. Ire
commend liberal appropriation. l(l the part of
Congress iu order that the Government may be ir
its just share of the expense of Carrying out tho
various systems of improvement.
By the reat fire in Chicio, tne most impor
tant of the Government buildups iu that city
were consumed. Theso buri.ed had alrerdy be
came inadequate to tbe wnu ef the Gavtrnmeut
in that glowing city, aud, looking to the near
future, were tnlly iuadeqmto. I recommend,
therefore, that an appropriation be made imme
diately to purchase tho remainder of the square
ou which the burned buildings stood, provided
it can be purchnsed at a fair valuation, sad pro
vided the Legislature of Illinois will pass a liw
authorizing its condemnation for Government
purposes, and also an appropriation of r.s much
niuney as can properly be expended towards the
erection cf n-w buildings this fiscal year.
