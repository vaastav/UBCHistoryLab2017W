The i'resiUeui's Message.
, The President's message, spyatbe Bal
timore Sun, which it given elsewhere at
length, is a temperate and conservative
document in every respect, treating of the
political situation in a calm and consistent
manner, and reflecting perspicuously and
succinctly the condition of our domestic
and foreign affairs. After due acknowl
edgements to the Almighty for abating
pestilence, and reference to the fact that
tne animosities engendered by the war;
?re rapidly yielding to the beneficent in
fluence* of our free institutions, the Pres
ident proceeds to the discussion ot the '
great issue of the -admission of all tbti
States to equal representation, which he
has heretofore pressed so lully and forci
bly upon Congress. In this regard the
message takes no position different fiom
that which Mr. Johnson maintained from
the commencement of his bdniinistration.
Now, as one y ear ago, ))0 regards that
crowning art as ?be only regaining neces
sity for restoring the n itiun to the condi
tion of prosperity wtMeh Mie war disturb
ed. He shows that the, iheoiy of the ter
ritorial condition of tl.e Southern Stales
ha? been tepudi? ted V>y every department
of the govertiir.ent ; by Congress appor
tioning direc'i taxed among all the Slates,
by cominu'ng th t representation o! some
ol the Sio kts ci'jiing the war, bv appoint*
ing ibe Yeprcjeiitationlof the several States
and the establishment of judicial ciieuits
throu jhoul the nation ; that the judicia
ry* iu the "proceedings of the Supreme,
Circuit ?.n<J District Courts, have equally
necogn'.zed the integrity of the States,
while the coutse of the Executive lias
been uniform. He warns Congress a
gai'jst all those efforts to testore the unity
of the government which are not within
'Vie limits of constituiionel power, as
tending to conso'idawon and despotism,
l and as no longer justified by any military
'necessity. The injunctions if Welling
ton's farewell that the constitution which
at any linn* exi*t? is ?aered obligatory u p
011 all uniil changed by an explicit and au
thentic act of the whole people, and that
changes by usurpation are the custouiaij
weapon by which governments are ce
etroyed, the like admonitions (J J r (Tvrson,
an1.! the emphatic laugu-ige of Jscksoii
that the Ui..uii is not 'o be preserved by !
an invasion ol the n^hls and powers <>| ,
the Stales, thai instead of strengthening '
they weaken ti e gm?r-.l government,
which ouytit lu hn !tll hi its bt iiihctiiew,
not in its power, in its protection, not in
us coutrol, are urged with great force in
aid of i|ip convietions to which ho fid
hcres, and which he thinks every cousid-j
eration of national policy and prosperity
conspire to urge upon the acceptance ol
Cong use. Singularly temperate and ie
specifol in the expiession ol his opiutous
aud forcible in the argument* and initia
tion* with which he sup;>? r'a theiu. the
President leaves Congress no excuse fur
factious hostility, lie is content to dis-.
charge his duty, to lay before them as the
Constitution requires his opinions of poli-j
cy and right, and to |e*vp with ibeui tho :
responsibility which belongs to tlieio. )
Should any factious opposition to the Kx
ecuiive impede the legislation of the:
country, it \t ill be gratuitous so fur as ;
piovlcaiion is sought iu the annual mes )
sage. j
To l he disappointment of many who
have been speculating upon his course,!
the Ptesident make* no new recommen
dation or even hint of other changes in!
the organic law. There is not a wo:u j
npon the questions of qualified or imiver-j
s a I sufTragr, r*h&U(te of ihe judicial tenure
of utile u, <Ls.. Deposing uf the coustilu-;
tional question, the message passes quiet-,
ly to the detail of the department adiuin-;
?? (ration , noticing first tbe prosperous'
condition of finances, the auspicious re- 1
auction of the public debt, the 6uperabun- j
dance ol the national ?esource?, and thai
all proper reductions of excise and im
port duties the revenue* a ill be ample,
and as the country advances in population,
and wealth, still further reductions in tax
ation may be made, ai d yet the entire na
tional debt be extinguished tviihin twenty
five year?. The operation* of the War
Department have no other interest ifian
the gratifying proof that the American
citizen is restored a* easily and swiftly to
the pursuits of peace at he is summoned I
and tquiped for war without impairing
the national safety or its military effirirn- 1
cy. But there i<? a sad record of 126,722
pennons, requiring an annual outl-y of
I/liny three mil ions of dollars. Parsing
over the i< suits ol ti e operations of the
I'ostoilice and luteiioi L'cpartruents, the
message makes some timely suggestions
of the necessity for greater prudence in
granting lands to railroad corporations for
purposes of internal improvement, point
ing out the necessity for government to
retain the title and to allow no sales of the
domain in lands except step by step with
the completion of the parts of the roads.
That great work, the Pacific railroad,
will probably bo completed withtu the
time stipulated.
Next in impoitance to that i ? the obli-j
gation upon the government, in the inter-1
ests of commerce and agriculture, to re
move the obstructions to the navigation ol
the Mississippi, and to repair the levee#
of that river, v* hich have been destroyed
during the war.
The recommendations with regard to
the District of Columbia contemplate the
election of a delegate to Congress to i
piotect the iiueresis of that people, to
which they are t> n titled upon ev? rv con
sideration m Inch justifies the like privilege
to any of the organized lerrituiiea.
In jespect to our foreign policy, the
message relieves the apprehension felt in
regard to active intervention in. Mexico
bv showing that the mission ol Mr.
Campb?il, aided by (ilsneral Sherman,
was denned a precautionary, rather than
I a$?t?res>-ive, in anticipation ol the early
'?evacuation of that country by the French
'troops, and lhal the departure of Napolr
on from the terms ol his arrangement to
remove lux troops, one third in Novem
ber, one-third in March, and the lemoin
der in November, 18G7, has not met the
acquiescencu ol the United States. An
amicable solution of the difficulty and a
ju:t concession to the expectations of t !> e
government is anticipated, from lite re
monstrances which our rii i n ia tcr has beeu
instruc^d to lay before the Emperor.
Tl e pending differences with Gieat
Bri'/m in regard to the injuries commit*
upon the commerce ol the country by
vessels equiped within her territory re
mains an open question, but one which
the new ministry has addressed itself to
io that friendly spirit which gives hopo of
satisfactory solution and such harmoni
zing of the neutrality laws of the two
countries as fht.il remove all impediments
! to continued harmony. The difficulties
of ihe Fenian invasion have embarrassed
and postponed these questions. They
have called for the enJoicment of our neu
irality laws on the one hand, while on the
other considerations ol humanity have in
( duced the government to excit it? good
offices to mitigate die severity of the pun
jish^Dent of those who have incurred ihe
sentence of the law.
In this connection the message urges on
' the attention of Congress the necessity of
j determining by legislation the principles
involved in the ri^'ht of expatriation and
in the naturalization laws of this country,
' so that the positions heretofore assumed
I by the Executive in dealing with foreign
! nations may be immunized uiih positive
law, and this great inW rnational question
be now placid with the diflertnt nations
of Europe upon a rational and satisfacto
ry fooling.
Should Congress accept the invitation
I with which the message closes, to co-op
erate in obliterating past differences and
uxormg the blessed reign of peace
throughout our borders, the clouds which i
remain will give place to the sunshine of j
universal prosperity.

There *ere about 3,000 persons in the
procession, and perhaps half that number
in addition at the Capiul, making an su
dttory of some 5,000 pfrsous. At least
one half of those in the procession wore
co ored. Thete was music from both
white and colored bands, and banners and
emblems were profusely displayed, and
much enthusiasm was manifested. When
iIih republican Congressmen appeared on
the portico they were loudly cheered
Judge Cartter, of the Supreme Court of
Washington delivered the address of wel-|
come, in which lie praised Congress next
to the country's brave defenders for sav- 1
ing the country in its late exiremity. Mr. j
Speaker Colfax responded in a very leng- J
thy address on behalf of the House of
Representatives. The tone of the speech !
was bitter against the South foi rejecting:
the constitutional amendment.
Senator Yates, of III., responded on
behalf of tiie Senate, who said he repre
sented the Northwest, where it was pro
posed not only to beat down copperhead
ism and modern democracy, but to demol
ish it utterly. He was very enthusiastic
over the late election, and referred to the
2d and 1 !ith chapters of the Epistle to the
Kphesians lor the epitaph of the demo
cratic party. Being requested to quote
?4ie chapters, he respectfully begged to be
txcu?ed, much to the amusement of eve
ry one around. Bfing pressed still fur
ther. and offered a Bible, he said :
Well, if you insist upon it, I believe it
is something in this style ; "Y? are
without Christ, being aliens to the Com-j
mo:i wealth of Israel. [Laughter.] Willi- 1
out the covenant ol promise, having no
hope and without God in the world.**
[Laughter and applause.]
Mr. Y .tea was very emphatic in his op
position to Southern admission, declaring
?hat those States should never comeip!
until every American should have the
privilege of going to any pari of this
country and enjoying its privileges.
Hon. Wm. U. Kelley, of Pennsylva
nia. was called for and spoke some time,
anil the crowd soon after dispersed.
'The Banquet to Congress ? Excited
Speeches of Mr. Stevens. of Pa., and
Others ? 'The President denounced, ^-c.
Washington, Dec. 3. ? The welcom
ing banquet to Congress took place to
night in the temporary Fair Buildinf, cor
ner ot Seventh street and Pennsylvania
avenue. 1 he five tables for the guests
'expended the length of the hall, at which
were ?eaied ladies and gentlemen to lbs
number of 400. Some specially honored
guests were at a Utile forming an arc of a
circle at the head oi (he hall, while in the
gall ry elevated behind a table a military
band wa9 stationed; the building was ep- j
propriately festooned and decorated.
THE WELCOME.
General Htmn Walbridge, of New
York, did the honors as president ol the1
leant, and made the address of welcome, in
which he said he recognized in the mem-j
btrs and Senators present those in whom
the American people had expressed their
confidence in the recent elections. The
appeal which a recreant President had
made had been met with a sl?m rebuke
ou the part of tUe people, and it would
become the duly of Congress soon to put
{ in ?o the national legislatiun the means ol
bringing the Southern States into obedi- j
ence and subordination. If the Exocu .
live should resist, it would become the
duty of Congress to remove him from of- j
fice. [Ch?ers.j If the Southern States'
should continue to set themselves up a* j
gainst Congress, it would be its duty to
appeal to the people of those States with-,
out regard to color.
| SPEECH OF MR. STEVEN?.
Hon. Thad. Stevens, of Penney lvania, ,
| responded, but could not clearl) be heard.
Ho attacked the President with vigor, de- ?
I daring that having been elevated into
power through an unexpected event vmt
id upon the nation for its ems, he now
' vi K?hcd to be King instead of President. ?
' ["Hisses.] Mr. Stevens said the war was ,
not over, he main and tinal object was.
pursued by the enemy with relentless en-;
iergy. The object had at ^ 1 keen
'rule over at least half the country as a na- (
lion of slaves, to introduce free trade and
to humiliate the North for its persistent
advocacy of freedom. the obj ct now
was to rule the whole nation, by mean*
of an oligarchy, making negroes an(i C0P" !
perheads cot.trjbute to the increased power
of the South through the increase of the
number of its votes, to seize the reins or
government, to introduce free trade, and
to break down the modesty of the tree
people of the North. During the war
Jeff. Davis w at commander-in-chief of the ;
Kebel army, with lie? as his chief advi
ser. Now, Andrew Johnson was their
commander-in-chief, and poor old Wool
was their cbirf martial adviser, and for the
navy they had Serome* and Welles.
[Laughter ] The people were to decide
i.otv whether they were to have Andrew
Johnson aa President or bs kmc. for they ^
were told they had no other ciioice left.
[Laughter.] ' He wanted the encourage
ment of the soldiers. 1 he enemy had(
the vantage ground, having possession of ,
the White liouse, and was dispensing
with a corrupt hand the vast pa.nnage
Jie nation, and yet he had no fears. I he
.*.rmy consisted of citizens as well a- sol
diers. L h..d a few mercenary officers
like the Sterdmans, the Dixea, and ihe
Wools; but if 'he government were 10 or-j
der Cirant, or liownrd. or tarragut to do.
its treacherous woik, they would break!
their swords rather than obey. ^ With,
Sheiiuan for a leader, and 25 or 50,000
colore 1 soldiers, they might defy Andrew |
Johnson and all who might follow hisj
lead. But if the time ?h? uld ever come
when the conspirator# would muster ?u
dacity equal to their ambition, and, as
onvo happened in England, attoinpt to
turn the regular army against the people,
Congress would not ha?e to fely on the
Southern froedmen alone. 'Ihe men of,
the loyal North would spring to their feet
and unsheathe their weapons, as when'
they heard the first booming cannon of
Sumpter.
Let Congress be bold, and the soUiiors
of the last war would tako caie of the rest, :
and the usurper who leads the hostile for- J
ces would have time and leisure to revise
his boasted proclamation in one of the em- j
brasures of Fortress Monroe. [Cheers.]
The usurper's head would rest much
more quietly, to be sure, on a lap board j
and goose than when oppressed with a
crown. [Laughter-] With less than
impartial suffrage the South, with his con-.
gen\ should never be reconstructed, liej
would not be content with such a puerile
work as universal amnesty and universal
suffrage.
Senators Howe and Wilson and Mr
Forney also spoke, and the bar.quet did
not end till nearly 12 o clock.
Interesting Opening of Congress? Bill
to fltpeul the Pardoning Power del- 1
ed Upon ? Visits? Effect of the Men
sage?The Welcome to Congress.
Washington, Dec. 3. ? Ihe House
proceedings were quite lively , and at times
exciting. The bill repealing section 13
of ihe act punishing rebellion, <fcc., and
which empowers the President to grant
pardon to rebels, was passed in a few
minutes.
When the President's message was an
nounced and a motion made to read it,
Mr. Stevens sought to defeat the reading
by various motions to adjourn, <tc., but
the House refused to sustain him. The
message was lead, and soon after the
House adjourned. The session of the
Senate was remarkably quiet and free of
excitement. Mr. Sumner made an ineffec
tual effort to pass his negro suffrage bill
for the District of Columbia, and when
the House bill passed to-day, and above
referred to, was announced, an attempt
was made to pass it insianter. Mr. Sauls
bary objected and the bill went over.
Soou afterwards the President's message
was received and read, and the Senate ad- ;
journed. # |
Senator Trumbull called on the Presi-:
dent to-day, and had a lengthy interview
with him. The judges of ihe Supreme
Court, which commenced its term to-day,'
also called in a body and paid their re
spects to the Executive to-night. Vice
President Foster spent an hour with Mr. j
Johnson, and several republican members j
called also.
i Ihe President' ? message dots not ax-'
cite much discussion. It is generally re
garded as an able and dignified docun.ent
Some of the republican members remark
that it does not amount to anything.
The reception given to Congress by
ihe citizens to-day falls far short of ex
pectations. The procession contained but
618 persous, 78 of tliein being whita.
