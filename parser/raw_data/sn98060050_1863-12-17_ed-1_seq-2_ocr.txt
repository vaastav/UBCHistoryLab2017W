THE MESSAQE.
The President's Message, which we publish
in our paper lo-day, with tho accompanying
Proclamation, has been anticipated with un
common interest. Kvcrjliody wero anxious lo
know what Mr. Lincoln would say about the
negro and " reconduction." And on these as
well as other matters, he has expressed himself
clearly and distinctly. In regard to cniancipa-
t'on he is firm its a rock. lie takes no step
backward. No slave freed by his emancipation
proclamation shall ever again be a bondman,
And bis plan for ' tcconstruction " seems to us
simple, piacticable nnd just. We tliink it will
give very genet nl satisfaction to all loyal and
sensible people, and, viitb some modifications
perhaps, will be adopted by the country. The
terms on which he proposes to receive back the
seceded States wo need not here repeat, ns eve
ry one will lead them for himself in the Presi
dent's own language. 'I he leaders of the re
hellion and those who have taken nny pnrt in
earning it on, will understand what their fale
is to be, and have an oppot Utility to shape their
conduct nccoidtnoly. The message gives an
encouraging view of our affairs and prospect
All danger of foreign interference has passed
by. Our i elation with other countiies and
governments me, on the whole, amicable and
satisfactory. The progress which vve have
made towards rccovcnr.g territory claimed by
the " Confederacy" bis been cheeiing, and the
prospect of putting down the rebellion within

Fn.MNO Tin: Quota. llecruits to fill the
quota of this State arc now coming in uipidly.
Over eight hurdred have already ai rived, and
every day adds largely to their number. They
are being clothed, mustered iu, paid mid for
waidcd to their respective regiments as fast as
possible. Two instalments one of onu hun
dred and nnolbcr of onu hundred nnd eighty-
seven have been ulieady sent, nearly all of
whom go into the 11th Vermont Kegimcnt.
The li rriiits thus far seem to prefer the heavy
Artilleiy as they thereby expect to get lid of
long wearisome, matches. We tliink there can
bo hut little doubt that the quota of Vermont
will lio filled by volunteeis. Nearly all tho
towns have done well, but the palm must be
awarded to St. Johnsbury. That town has al
ready raised her full number 78 men to fill
both her quota under the last call and the de
ficiency under thu draft. Well done!

'I ho londs hi this section nro bad whenever there is
tho least rain, mid owing to the soft natiiro of Ihe

could not move on nnd leave tho train, conseipicntly
wo wero hitching nlong nnd did not halt until mid
midnight, when wo bivouacked on tho south bank of
tho llapldan, near the pontoon bridge. 'I ho night wns

tl.cro was no enemy lo contest the advance. About
noon Ocn. l-'rciich rode to the front and tho column
was again put In motion. About two nnd n bnlf
mile from our bivouac tho ndvnneo commenced sir
mlslung with Ibo enemy, nnd nbout four miles from
where wo started tho advance gunrd met with seilous
resistnnec. Our division w-a deployed on cither sldo
of tho road In tho demo wood. With tho exception
of four gun our artillery could not bo used. I'our
bra 12-poniider wero tiicd nt random hi n small
clearing of nbout 200 feet square, firing Into tlio wood
promiscuously. At that time tho Adjutant and my
self w ero nt the front, nnd saw the 10th Vermont just
going Into nctlon. Tills was thoir first engagement,
they lost about 70 men killed nnd wounded. The en

Tho Adjutant and I had just before gono to nuother
small clearing half a mile back wbcio thero was a
small house. Tho Cth corps was now ordered up)
our brlgndo led. Appearances showed there wns soon
to bo hot woik. Gen. Trench had sent for (leu. Sedg
wick to hold council wilh him. lien. S. wa prompt
to tho call, nnd tho two unmoved by nny crll
consulted together near the houo. -lust then tho en
emy opened n battery somewhere In front In tho
woods, and the shells cnine into the chairing thick nnd
fast. Charge wero mndo by the enemy nnd our
wounded wero coming to the rear nlong the road In n
stream ; quite a number of pioneers nlso enmci it
seemed n though our line were giving way ns the
shout and noise of buttle !ucicncd
Cen. Trench now mounted and rode Into tho woods
out of sight to the front, it seemed to bo a tinio when
his pcisonal ellorts were needed. (!cn. Sedgwick or
dered our brigade into lino on Ibo spot, as a sort of
basis forasecond lino. Musician, pioneers, wounded
and si-mo coward, now mado for tho rear. Our men
topped nil who should not go, and foimcd them iu
tho second line, (icucrnl Sedgwick and stall' weto
mounted and sending up brigade to the front, the 3d
brigade, fien. Neil, went totho left. (ic-u. Itus-cll's
trlpulc was engaged. Shell and bullet struck
around us a U'tial, u shell killing two mounted men
between lien. Sedgwick and where we Col. Grant
and staff were standing. It wasno mo to move; wo
iniht move ju-t where tho next ouo would come, so
wo kept quiet.
(ien. Trench repulsed tho enemy, but It wa misc.
able ground lo light on. At midnight wo withdrew
and marched several miles round cn to I tic Turnpike
and joined tho forces of the main column. On Ibo
28lh wo pushed forward driving the eneniy beyond
Mine or Mile Hun wl-eio wc found them concentrated
for u finnl stnudf-aiii1. in n good position. Wo wero on
the cxtiemc right of tho enemy, nnd tho skiruiMdn

lines could plainly be teen and their tnttcrii s Iu po

age, but lor si mo ieaon they held Iheir die. Thnt
night wn the first wc ically got much sleep our

to eat. '1 he morning of the 2tith order eauie to be

tho position of tho enemy e. At lirst it wns sup
posed onr ll-igade only was to make the charge then
the 3d llrignde w-a ndded. All the plan wero made
and we wcrosnro of success, but the day passed away
and nothing w a done. I suppose a movement wns
gob g on on tho left that we wcio waiting for.
At night the plans wcio changed and the Sth nnd
Cth Corps were sent clear round the enemy's lelt flanli
and iiiaescd in tlio wood-. At midnight wo were to
commence a grand nsnult upon the line of the en

Iho movement would be postponed until further or

If that charge had been mado terrible would have
been tho sull'cimg, the wounded could not have lived
