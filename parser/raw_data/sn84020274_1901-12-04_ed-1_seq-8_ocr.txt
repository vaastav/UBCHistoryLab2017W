FRANCHISES MAY BE
TAXED AS PROPERTY.
Missouri Supreme Court Decides
Case Against Western Union
Telegraph Company.
OPINION BY JUDGE MARSHALL
City of St. Louis Wins in Suit
Where Contractor Claimed
Alleged Balance Due on
Contract.
REPUBLIC SPECIAL.
Jefferson City. Mo. Dec. 3 Judge Mar
shall rendered an Important decision in tlio
case of State ex rel. Chris Gottlieb. Col
lector of Jackson County, against the
Western Union Telegraph Company, a tax
ult Involving the validity of an assess
ment of the defer.dant't franchise fur taxa
tion. In this case the Circuit Court held that
the defendant was derating under a Fed
eral franchise, and that such a franchise
was nontaxable In this case. The opinion
of the Supreme Court sw":
"The trial court was right in holding that
the defendant la a Government agent, but
this only extended to Its relations between
the Government and its agent's.
The trial court as also right in holding
that the defendant is an Instrument of in
terstate commerce. But the trial court was
In error In holding that the defendant de
rived its franchise-that K Its right to ex
ist and be a corporation and do a telegraph
business from the Government of the
United States. That franchise is derived
from the State of New York and not from
the Government of the United States.
Neither the act of Congress nor its accept
ance by the defendant created the defend
ant, or gave it the rUht to do business."
The court says further:
The right to exist the franchise of the
defendant was property, and was subject
to taxation, either directly. In the propor
tion that the portion of the franchise ex
ercised In this State tore to the proportion
Of the franchise exercised in other States, or
Indirectly, as was done here, by being im
pressed upon this tangible property owned
by It, thereby Increasing Its value, and by
considering the franchise and its tangible
property as a system, and then assessing
the part of the property forming a part of
the system and located in Missouri, as of
Its proportionate value of the whole prop
erty constituting the system."
This decision is not a construction of the
so-called "franchise law" enacted by
the last Legislature. That law i in no
wise involved In thli case, which comes up
irrespectively of that statute, and origi
nated, in fact, before that law was passed.
Hence, In upholding the power of the State
Board of Equalization to tax franchises as
"property," the opinion goes to show the
trend of judicial thought upon this ques
tion, and is considered a great lclory for
the principle of franchise taxation in this
State.

The case of Richard I. McCormick vs.
City of St. Louis, a suit by a contractor
against the city for X2.X3.19. an alleged
balance due on certain work done at Chain
of Rocks, under the Mississippi I'.lver, in
connection with the citj'i, Waterworks, was

Judge' ValUant denied the writ of prohibi
tion asked for by plaintiff in the case of
Mary C Davidson is. Warwick Hough,
Judge of the St. Louis Circuit Court, and
others. This suit Involves a controversy
over certain insurance upon the life of
plaintiff's son. L. E. Davidson. Plaintiff
claimed the policy by assignment, the chil
dren of deceased claim as beneficiaries, and
the St. Louis Trust Company claims as ad
ministrator of the estate. The question is
one of jurisdiction :n the Circuit Court, an 1
Judge Valllant holds that ii to the subject
Blatter, consent cannot affect the jurisdic
tion, but as to the parties. It can. If the
law does not confer on the court juris
diction of the eubject. consent of parties
cannot confer It. But parties whom the
court has not reached, or even cannot reach
by its process, may come in voluntarily
and confer Jurisdiction of their persons on
the court.

Elsie De Wolfe's Engagement at

New York. Dec 3. Amusement peekers
who braved the weather to-night to wit
naa. a iwrformiscc of Xliss Elsie DeWolfe's
company in "The 'Way of the World," nt
the Victoria Theater, were surprised to find
on arrival there that the house was closed.
Aetit" differences between Georpe W.
Ltderer. manager for Miss Elsie DeWolfe,
and Oscar Hammersteln, proprietor of the
theater, caused the abrupt termination of
Miss DeWolfe's engagement on a few
hours" notice.
"I-. I.rder-r '.-.;,! to-r.iqht that Mr. Ilam
merstem's actions of Sate vveie the result
of a determined attempt to force the com

Bet a hlsher percentace from another com-p-.i).
Mr. Hammersteln. however, claim'
that the contract provided that he could
terminate the engagements if the receipts
did not come up to a certain figure, which
they had not been doing of late.
On the other hand Mr. Lederer charges
the theater management with turning
money away from the box office in order
to keep the sale dow n so the contract could
be broken. This Mr. Hammersteln denies.
HARRISON CLINGS TO BURKE.
1 i
Chicago's Mayor Takes Part in a
Factional Fight.
Chicago, Dec. 3 Major Harrison openly
severed relations with City Clerk Locffier
to-day and at the same time set at rest all
rumors of a quarrel between himself and
Robert K. Burke by declaring that IJurke
was his friend.
This coming fast upon the lockout jes
terday of Thomas J. Gahan and some
seventy delegates to the meeting of the
County Central Democratic Committee Is
taken to mean the Mayor's enmity to the
faction led by ex-Maor John I. Hopkins,
with which Loeffler is affiliated. The May
or, however, denounced the tactics of the
Burke faction, and said It was "the poorest
kind of management" to bar Gahan and
his followers from the meeting.
Special strfss is laid upon the Major's
announcement that he and Loeffler had
come to "the parting of the ways," since it
has nlwnvs btcn Loeffler who has patched
up difficulties. Mr. Loeffler said to-day
that the tight would be taken to the State
Committee, which Is controlled by Hopkins,
and from there to the County Court.
FILLS STREETS AND CELLARS.
Water Main Bursts at Grand and
Emily Avenues.
The bursting of a large water main near
the comer of urand and Emily avenues last
night caused much damage in that locality.
Cellars for blocks aiound were flooded, and
before the water was bhut off in the tower
it had risen to a depth of two feet in the
streets.
Herman Sander, proprietor of a saloon at
No. 4329 North Grand avenue, suffered a
loss of stock by the water tilling the cel
lar. The water ran into 1'erkinton's quar
ry, causing slignt damage.
The point where the main bur&t is about
two blocks from the water tower. The
pressure was &o great that the water shot
up to a height of twelve feet. A large hole

The main burst about 11:50 oclock and it
was nearly 1 oclock before the water was
shut off. The Water Commissioner's office
was notified and men were i-cnt to remedy

closing of valves in the water tower.

PRESIDENT SAYS RECIPROCITY MUST BE
TREATED AS PROTECTION'S HANDMAIDEN.
"There is general acquiescence In our present tariff system as a national pol-
ley. The first requisite to our prosperity is the continuity and stability of this
economic policy. Nothing could be more unwise than to disturb the business in-
tercsts of the country by any general tariff change at this time. Doubt, apprehen-
4 sion, uncertainty are exactly what we most wish to avoid In the interest of our
s commercial and material well-being. Our experience in the past has shown that
sweeping revisions of the tariff are apt to produce conditions closely approach-
ing panic in the business world. Yet it is not only possible, but eminently deslra- s)
ble, to combine with the stability of our economic system a supplementary system
of reciprocal benefit and obligation with other nations. Such reciprocity is an incl-
dent and result of the firm establishment and preservation of our present economic
policy. It was especially provided for in the present tariff law. s
4 "Reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection. Our first duty is
A
I
to tee that the protection granted by the
maintained, and that reciprocity be sought for so far as it can safely be done
without injury to our home industries.
s aicording to the n dividual case, remembering alwavs that every application of our
, tariff policy to rr.tet our shifting national needs mu-t be conditioned upon the
i cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the point that will cover
the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well-being of the
s wage-worker is a prime consideration of our entire policy of economic legislation. s
"Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our industrial
well-being at home, the principle of reciprocity must command our hearty sup-
port."
CONGRESS GAVE ITS EARNEST
ATTENTION TO THE MESSAGE.
Emphatic Utterances Concerning Restoration of American Merchant
Marine, Exclusion of Chinese Labor, Relief for Cuba and Irriga
tion of Arid Regions Were Xot Expected Senators and
Representatives Actually Listened to the Reading.
RKPUnLlC SPECIAL
Washington, Dec. 3 Senators and Repre
sentatives sat at their deskt for two hour
and a half to-dav- and listened with the
closest attention to every one 'of the 17,f00
words in the first annual message of Presi
dent Roosevelt.
Usually the formal message of a Presi
dent at the opening of a Congress dons
rot attract much notice from the mem
bers. They krow In a general way what is
cemmg and each stuffs a, copy into his
pocket to read at home at his leisure. Yet
everjbody wanted to Know what Theodore
Roosevelt had to siy on public questions
and how he was going to say it.
The spectacle of more than two-thirds of
the Senators sitting with open copies of the
message before them, turning it over page
by page, keeping pace with the reading
clerk. Is unusual, but that was beheld to
day and lasted from the time the mes
sage was delivered until the signature,
"Theodore Roosevelt," rolled in sonorous
tones through the room.
The message in many ways was a sur
prise. It ple-ased as a literary effort; it
pleased for its straightforwardness of dis
cussion, and it pleased for Its conservatism.
Senators who have been going around for
a long time slj ly depicting Roosevelt as an
impulsive joung man who delights in
waving a lighted torch in a powder maga
zine have recanted. While leading mem
bers of Congress may differ with the Presi
dent as to his recommendations regarding
trusts, reciprocity, irrigation and a great
navy, they all admit that the message Is a
model state document.
DIU.MG PARAGRAPH OP
JIESSAGE REFERS TO AXARCIIY.
The question of the hour is: What effect
will the message have on legislation? The
President does not hesitate to say what lie
thinks, and he recommends new departures
on many matters which Congress has here- I
loiore euner ignorcu or dealt with in a
futile or perfunctory way.
The burning paragraph in the message Is
that dealing with anarchy. It is a bugle
call to arms to put down this terrible and
insidious menace to all Government Un
doubtedly there will bo legislation for the
suppression of anarchy meeting the Presi
dent's view.
On trusts the President's remarks have
been gauged by many Senators and Con
gressmen as bread common sense. Others
were disappointed in this part of the mes
sage. Theie is unquestionably a very strong
sentiment in both houses of Congress In fa
vor of the Roosevelt publicity cure lor
trusts that defraud the public by putting
forth watered stock. There is a strong sen
timent throughout the country in favor of
such an office, but the Senate is likely to
-show a disposition to move slowly.
Mr. Roosevelt'j. advice to Congress that
it re-enact the Chinese exclusion law will
undoubtedly be followed. The President was
urged within his own Cabinet to make no
such recommendation, but he has done It,
and the feeling on this point Is strong that
there are already at Ieat a dozen bills
ready for introduction designed to prevent
Chinese immigration after the expiration of
the present law next May. This recommen
dation has almost broken the heart of Min
ister Wu, who is going the diplomatic
limit to get the Chinese admitted.
ROOSEVELT'S RECIPROCITY
RECOM.MEM1ATIO.N IS VtEK.
It will be noticed that the weak paragraph
in the message is that dealing with reci
procity. One can rcaJily imagine McKln
ley sending a ringing call to Congress to
take up and consider this question, which he
believed to be the most important econom
ical problem confronting the American peo
ple. He made it the keynote of the last
speech he delivered. Yet the new President
has neglected to quote the last words of his
predecessor.
McICinle-y was getting ready to sacrifice
a portion of high duties for the purpose
of extending our markets abroad. Roose
velt has apparently stirted in ou the
reciprocity road where McKinley took it
live years ago, instead of where McKinley
left off.
The President in discussing the condi
tion of the American merchant marine is
much stronger and emphatic than was an
ticipated. He does not recommend "sub
sidies" in that term, but he does show that
foreign monopoly of the carrjing trade is
due to the fact that foreign ships are sub
sidize!. It may be significant that, immediately
after the adjournment of the Senate to-day.
Senators Frye and Hanna went Into con
ference on the subject of a new shipping
bill.
REKEKi:CE TO CI II VN RELIEF
IVITES COMING COIIBVT.
It has caused surprise that foreign affairs
should occupy such small space in the mes-
c-pecially when it is remembered that
the United States is now occupying a place
so prominent in the field of world oper.
tionsi The only countries mentioned In it
are Great Britain, Germany, China and
Mexico. Other countries, like Russia, w hich
stood shoulder to shoulder with us at Pekin
during the negotiations there, and France,
which is eagerly seeking more intimate
trade relations, are Ignored.
While the omissions may appear trifling to
the lay mind, it may be interesting to state
that they are regarded as Important and
significant by the diplomatic world.
The reference of the President to the Mon
roe Doctrine was to be expected. In view
of the prominence that has been given It by
the new Hay-Pauncefote treaty. They met
with the hearty approval of the entire Con
cress.
Mr. Roosevelt has taken up the question
of relief for Cuba in a way that gives evi
dence that he derives joy from the knowl
edge of coming combat. He, too, is a high
protectionist, but he can nee no Injury to
the sugar and tobacco growers of the
United States. That Is, la his opinion, more
tariff In every case where it is needed is
Just how- far this Is must be determined
than offset by the moral obligation that we
owe to Cuba.
The Senators and Representatives who
have been opposing reciprocity with Cuba
for the purpose of forcing the annexation
of the island, are ready to take issue with
the President on this point The President
is so emphatic that there can be no ques
tion that this matter will be one of the
memorable contests of the session between
the legislative and executive branches of
the Government.
The new President starts in on the
hardest part of his work, having compelled
respect from congressional critics who are
the most severe critics in the world.
Senator Mark A. Hanna is dining at the
White House to-night.
ADJOURNED TO MEET FRIDAY.
House Appoints Committee to Take
Action on Death of President.
Washington, Dec. 3. As the hands of the
clock pointed to 12 Speaker Henderson
called the lower house to order. After
the Journal had been read and approved
Mr. Cooper of Texas and Mr. Wood of Cali
fornia, who were not present yesterday,
appeared at the bar and were sworn in.
On motion of Mr. Pane, the floor leader of
the majority, it was agreed that when the
House adjourns to-day it be to meet again
rnaay.
The Speaker announced the appointment
of the Committee on Rules, as follows: Mr
Henderson of Iowa. Mr. Dalzell of Pennsjl
vania, Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio. Mr. Richard
son of Tennessee and Mr. Underwood of
Alabama. The only change In the commit
tee was the substitution of Mr. Underwood
for Mr. Bailey of Texas, who Is now a mem
ber of the Senate.
Mr. Bingham of Pennsylvania, at the head
of the committee appointed to wait upjn the
President, reported that the committee, ac
companied by a like commlltpo from th
Senate, had performed Its duty, and that
the President had received their message
with pleasure, and said he would at once
communicate with the two houses in writ
ing. Two minutes later Major Pruden, assist
ant secretary to the President, appeared at
the main entrance and announced a messago
from tlie President. The message was taken
tp tne Speaker's desk, where fapeaker Hen
derson broke the seal.
Speaker Breaks the Seal.
t-"A Passage from the President of the
united States," he said, as he handed the.
document to the reading elerk and dlrect.d
him to read it. Hardly a member left his
seat until the reading was concluded.
There was a slight murmur of applause
when, in concluding the recommendation for
legislation to put down anarchy, the clerk
rr.id: "No matter calls more uigently lor
the wisest thought of Congress"
The murmurs when this sentence was read
were followed by a burst of applause when
the clerk read. "The American people are
slow to wrath, but when their wrath is oncj
"J"?"1 j,1 burns like a consuming name."
Probably no other portion of the message
attracted so much attention as that relating
to trusts. No demonstration was evoked by
the reading of this portion of the me.ssage.
but the- recommendation for the re-enactment
of the Chinese exclusion law- drew an
P'iuse from both sides of the house.
There were no further demonstrations
throughout the reading nf the remainder of
the message, but at the conclusion of the
reading there was a generous burst of an
p.aute fiom the Republican side. The read
ins was concluded at 2i5. Mr. Payne then
moved that the message, except that por-
t,.r?a&,R,, tlle dtath ot 'he 'ate l'rosi
eient McKinley. be printed and referred to
the Lon.mlttee of the Whole on the State of
tne union.
Committee to Draft Henolntionii.
Mr. Grow (Pa ) said he desired to speak
upon that portion relating to the Philip
pines, but upon the representation ot Mr.
Payne that he could address the House at
some time later he jielded and the motion
was adopted.
?Ln.?roS!enor thcn offered the following
resolution:
"Resolved, That a committee of one mem
ber from each State represented In this
House be appointed on the part of tio
House to Join such committees as may be
appointed on the part of the Senate, to con

and affection it may be proper for the Con

Piatt of Connecticut. Hanna, Cullom, Proc

interchange of opinion regarding the work
of the present session of Congress.
HOUSE CLERKS SNOWED UNDER
Flood of Bills Continued Few
New Ones of Importance.
Washington, Dec 3. The flood of bills is
so great In the House of Representatives
that the clerical staff was kept busy all
last night, and managed to get abreast of
273 public and 1,113 private bills a total of
LSS2, or about one-half of all those intro

with quiet confidence that the fight is won.
Colonel Kerens maintains that the fight

"There is only one waj- In which a

bj- a personal appeal to the Archbishop of
her diocese. The church Is alvvajs read

there is no doubt that a Catholic woman,
married to a Protestant by a Protestant

A friend of the bride's familj said to-daj
that the marriage by a Protestant minister
was made necessary bj- the desire for haste

GOVERNMENT TAKES A HAND.
To Arrange for Return of Boy,
Shipped to South Africa.
REPUBLIC SPECIAL.
Washington, Dec. 3. Representative
James Cooneyha had a conference with,
tne Secretary of State concerning the casa
of an unfortunate j outh in his district, who
was Induced by a St. Louis employment
agency to ship for South Africa. The Dor
name is L. L. Thompson. He wlU be re
called as the student who was hazed at tha
University of 3Iisteouri so severely that
many of the liazenj were expelled.
The Secretary of State to-day informed'
Judge Cooney that instructions have beea
wlrd to the Consul to find Thompson and
arrange for permission for him to return
home at the father's expense.
The Secretary believes this will Impress
upon the Consul the need for watching for
other similar cases of which the department
has had many complaints from Missouri
and adjoining States.
After joung Thompson's hazing he felt
ostracised at school and ran away, trylnc
first to enlist at Jefferson Barracks. Tha
father learned of this in time to prevent
enlistment, and the boy next appeared at
the employment agency. Before his father
could prevent it young Thompson was
shipped to Cape Town via New Orleans.
The St. Louis agency refused information
of the matter, but a letter received from
Cape Town stated that young Thompson
has arrived there. "".-.-
Complaint i made that the real purposa
is to press these American youths Into tha
British army in South Africa.
WHAT GOES UP
31at Come Down. " """ "" "
Nothing Is more certain than that the use
of so-called tonics, stimulants and medl
crnts. vvnich depend upon alcohol for their
effect, is injurious to health in the Ions;
What goes up must come down and tha
elevation of spirits, the temporary exhilara
tion resulting foam a dose of medicine con
taining alconol, will certainly be followed
in a few hours by a corresponding depres
sion to relieve which another dose must ba
In other words, many liquid patent medi
cines derive their effect entirely from tha
alcohol they contain.
Alcohol, anil mediclnp Mnl.i(nln. f on
temporary stimulants and not In any sense
a true tonic. In fact it is doubtful If any
medicine cr drug is a real tonic
A true tonic Is something which will re
new, replenish, build up the exhausted
nervous system and wasted tissues ot tha
body, spmetning that will enrich the blood
and endow It with the proper proportions ot
red and white corpuscles, which prevent or
destroy disease germs. This is what a
real tonic should ao and no drug or alcoholic
sttmuiant will do it.
Tlie only true tonic In nature Is whole
some looa. tcoroughlr digested. livery
particle of nervous energy, every minute
muscle, fiber and drop of bicod Is created
daily from the food we digest.

fect digestion of the food eaten has every
thing to do with It.
The reason so few- people have perfect di
gestion is because from wrong habits of
living the stomach has gradually lost the
power to secrete the gastric juice, peptones
and acids In sufficient quantity
i.i cure indigestion and stomach troublea
ji .a necessary 10 taKe after meals soma
harmless preparation which will supply tha
natural peptone and diastase which erttr
weak stomach lacks, and probably the best
preparation of this character is Stuart'a
LjsiM?psia Tablets, which may be found In
every drug store and which contain in
pleasant, palatable form th wholes-nine cen.
twie and diastase which nature requires for
prompt digestion.
One or two nf Mima -i.Alfenr fah!t
taken after meals will prevent souring, fer
mentation and acidity and Insure complete
digestion and assimilation.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are equally
valuable for mtle children as for adults, aa
they contain nothing harmful or stimulating
out only the natural digestives.
One of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will di
gest LSflO grains of meat, eggs or other
wholesome, loou. and they are In every sens
a genuine tonic because they bring about
in the only natural way a restorative of
nerve power, a building up of lost tissue and
appetite, in the only way It can be dona
by the digestion and assimilation ot wnaaa
aoaie food.
