Weakness In (he wheat market developed
toward the middle or the session and con
tinued until the dose. Prior to. that
time a strong tone had prevailed. . awlnx
to active demand by commission hous's
no snorts, out 10 ine sirsngiu 01 enru

or Wheat at Liverpool. The situation in
the ' nortK west was th principal reanoh
for the selling pressure that carried prices

of tha session. RecelDts of wheat a
Minneapolis and Duluth today were nearly
109 cars tit exeess of those reoetved tha
corresponding day a year ago, while those
t Winnipeg were 17 4 cars, against IK
cars last year. A report from Minneapolis
waa to the effect that the movement would
probably continue to be heavy aIL winter.
A slumo in coarse grains helDed to weaken
the wheat market during the last hour of
trading. The close was weak. May

In the day as a result of active demand
by ahorts, who were actuated by a con
tinued urgent Inquiry for cash corn by
eastern shippers. Lteadlng longs sold
freely on the bulge, which caused a loss
of all lb early gain. The market cloaed
weak. May opened eo to tteo
higher, at tlCtlc. advanced to 63 fee
and then declined to 6(0. The cloae woe

to urgent demand for cash oafs. The

NEW TORK, Deo. 4. The price move
ment of stocks shifted many times again
during the course of the day' trading, re
flecting either the genuine doubt and hesi
tations of operators or the manipulative
effects of . professional operators designed
to conceal the real course of the transac
tions and to confuse the minds of ob
servers. The market was rather generally
depressed In the early part of the day and
manuestea rigorous strength in the latter
part. i
The early depression was traceable In
part to the effect of selling for foreign
account and tha unfavorable view taken
abroad of ths contents of the president
message or, rattier, of its omissions. The
Japanese Incident seemed to be seriously
regarded In foreign drains, also. The cop
per stocks were an active center of weak
ness. Successive dividend reductions of
different eopper mining stocks have worn
upon the courage of holders. The United
States Steel atocke shared In the deTree
lon to aome extent, especially the pre
ferred stock. The weakness of American
Smelling was attributed to fears of a re
duction In the. dividend rate, but Us great
est weakness '.was shown after the an
nouncement of the declaration of tha rea
alar dividend on tha stock.. The disposition
to take aavantage 01 tne good newa to sell
the stock created a bad Impression. There
wa another decline In the price of copper
and It waa feared that tha recent heavy
shipment of copper to Europe represented
rather a transfer of holdings to a more
convenient money market than an actual
marketing of stocks.
The vigorous rally In ths market found
Its Initiation In ths Hill railroad group.
i.mimiie. i news ror the active buying at
rising prices of this arcup waa lacking. It
waa accompanied by large lending of money
on call by banking Interests closely Iden
tified with these properties. Subscriptions
n ureai fNonnern new stock call for pay
ment of an Installment of isomnnA nn i-
cember (, and those for Northern Pacific
new atncK ror an Installment of 111.623,000
payable January 1. There was a pro
nounced relaxation In tha call mnnn mar.
ket, and the premium on currency fell back
again, xnis was connected with the is
suance of tbe controller call tor reports
of condition of the national banks as of
December S. It has been assumed that
some recent' purchases of currency for
account of Interior banks were - to
trengthen their showing to be made In
response to this call, now expected for
many day past. Banks also are alway
more liberal In- extending credit liabilities
Immediately after complying with the call
from the controller. The expected demon
stration that the deficit now existing In
ui. irirrvn oT me new none hanks win
be found amply accounted fnr hv tha re
cruitment of Interior bank reserves In the
process oi wunarawai from Nw Tnrk will
go far-to cure apprehension over the New
Y?rk. rv position, which is, In fact,
about 20 per cent of deposit- liabilities at
the present figures. It must be borne In
niinu mat tne a per cent reserve require
ment on central reserve hank J tahnau nr

of other banks, on which loans are made
both by the central rpivrvn hantr ami tha

banks drawn down the potential v requlre-

A prelude to the resnnnsea tn tha cnn.

the money In circulation In the country on

statement of the treasury. The increase
In the circulation medium for the month of

been aome ealea of Ohio, fine delaine And
half-blood tn order lota and aample lota of
clothing grades are moving. In territory

CATTLuE PUcilpt oi cai.ii thl morning
numbered only 14J cars, which .ss a very
moderate run for a Wednesday. On the
other hand Chicago had a heavy run and
a lower niacket, with other selling paint
reporting liberal receipts. Condition wero
all favorable for lower price at thl point
excepting the light receipt, which gave
sellers a little advantage and enabled them
to hold price steadier than they would
otherwise have been able to. do. .Still the
market waa. alow and late In opening, with
the feeling generally weak.
When the market on beef steer was once
under Way the good kind, both cornfeda
and ranger commanded ateady prices.
Though the trade waa not active, the
offerings being light, the most of the cattle
changed hands In very fair season. On the
other hand the warmed-up and Inferior
grades were slow sale throughout the ses
sion and the feeling on that kind was
easier. Borne cattle of that description
which lacked weight were very hard to
move.
Good cow and heifers, that I kind that
are selling at $3.00 and upwards. Were gen
erally quoted as fully steady. Now and
then It was poxslble to point to sales that
If anything looked better than yesterday.
The less desirable killers, such aa aro
selling from $3.00 down, were slow and dull
all the morning at prlcea that wero weak
to some lower.
There was a better demand for feeders
than for any other kind of cattle and the
trade was fairly active, the most of the
offerings changing hands early. Prlcea paid
were strong as compared with yesterday. It
would look as It money condition were
easing up a little in the country, so that
would-be feeders are In position to buy
such cattle a they may be In need of.

HOGS Packers started out this morning
bidding prices that were fully tVu'lOc lower
than yesterday. Receipts were liberal, but
In spite of that fact salesmen seemed to
have a pretty good opinion of values and
by holding on they eventually forced buy
ers to raise their early bids. When the
market really opened It was on a basis of
prices that were weak to 6c lower than
yesterday s general market. In other
words the hogs sold very largely at $4.rnf
4.66, with a top at $4 76. After about two
third of the hog had been sold the trad
slowed up, becoming rather dull, with some
of the packers who had been holding out
all the morning, bidding lower.
On the late market It ws hard work to
get over $4 66 for anything, although buyers
did occasionally bid a little more for
hoga having both weight and quality. To
ouote the lat market as lt.66-S4.eo would be
about right, that 1 6310c lower than the
any market.

SHEEP Receipts of aheep were' very
light thl morning, only a dosen car being
reported In at the Opening. Of this num
ber there were three or four cars of feed
ers, so that the offerings of killers were
the smallest ot the week to' date. The
market all around was ateady to a little
stronger In apots. Good fat Iambi, both
natives and westerns, sold a high as $C.10.
with feeder lambs at $6. DO. The yearlings
that brought $4.75 were a cut-off of the
ame at brought $4.76 yesterday. Pretty
decent western ewes Bold at $4.26.
While the market at this point was In
gooa condition owing to the moderate re
celpts, early Indication from Chicago
pointed to a lower range of prices at that
folnt It might be well for shippers to
horoughly understand that while moderate
receipts are taken care of In good shape
the demand Is by no means sufficiently
urgent to digest heavy runs without a
break In prices. What all the market
need I a steady run of. moderate propor
tions.

TTie government authorities have finally
concluded to take up the matter ot the,
circulation of the wild cat notes of the
Merchants' Sc. Planters' bank of Georgia,
and thoso of the Slate Bonk of New Bruns
wick which have passed to a considerable
extent recently In northern and western
Nebraska.
These old bank notes of long lnce de
funct banks are not counterfeits, but th
banks Issuing them went out of exlsteno)
many years ago and the notes are of no
value. They ar stats bsnk notes, but re
semble In many respects national bank and
I'nlted States treasury notes. They are
smaller than national bank or treasury
notes and are printed on an Inferior quality
" papvr. ..........
It appears that when tbe . bank
Issuing these note went out of exist
ence each had a largo bulk .of the
noteti among It ansuts wilch ' later came
Into trie possession of uns.Tupuloug specu
lators and have recently made their ap
pearance In the west In large quantities.
The government authorities now hold that
while the note are not absolutely counter
felt, they are sufficiently Ilk national bank
and ire usury notes to make their distribu
tion unlawful under the counterfeit law. -Many
of the note have been recovered by
the I'nlted State authorities and are now
In possession of the officers and special
secret service officer have been sent out
to locate the distributers of the bogus cur
rency and arrest them under th federal
taw for having tn thetr possession and
distributing money In similitude to the law
ful currency of the realm, with the Ihteat
to defraud and deceive.
