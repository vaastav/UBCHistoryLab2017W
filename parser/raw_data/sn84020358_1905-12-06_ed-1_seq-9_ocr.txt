The full text of the president's mes- f
vsi,s,g?o jicoiciuaj LUJiuna.
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives: The people of this country continue
to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubtedly
there will he ebb and flow in such pros
perity, and this ebb and flow will be
felt more or less by all members of the
community, both by the deserving and
the undeserving. Against the wrath of
the Lord the wisdom of man cannot
prevail; In times of flood or drought
(human ingenuity can but partiallyy re
pair the disaster. A general failure of
crops would hurt all of us. Again,, if
the folly of man mars the general well
being, then those who are Innocent of
the folly will have to pay part of the
penalty incurred by those who are
guilty of the folly. A panic brought
on by the speculative folly of part of
the business community would hurt the
iwhole business community- But such
stoppage of welfare, though in might
be .severe, would not be lasting. In
the long run the one vital factor in the
permanent prosperity of the country is
the high individual character of the
average American worker, the average
American citizen, no matter whether
his work be mental or manual, whether
be be farmer or wage-worker, business
Man or professional man.
In our industrial and social system
the Interests of all men are so closely
Interwlned that in the Immense ma
jority of cases a straight-dealing man
who. ty his efficiency, by his ingenuity
and industry, benefits himself must al
so benefit others. Normally the man of
great productive capacity who becomes
rich by guiding the labor of many
other men does so oy enabling them to
produce more than they could produce
without his guidance; and both he and
they share in the benefit, which comes
also to the public at large. The super
ficial fact that the Sharing may be un
equal must never Wind us to the under
lying fact that there is this sharing, and
that the benefit comes in some degree
to each man concerned. Normally the
wage-worker, the man of small means,
and the average consumer, as well as
the average producer, are all alike
helped by making conditions such that
the man of exceptional business ability
receives an exceptional reward for his
ability. Something can be done by leg
islation to help the general prosperity;
but no suCh help of a permanently ben
eficial character can be given to the
less able and less fortunate, save as the
results of a policy which shall inure to
the advantage of all industrious and
efficient people who act decently; and
this is only another way of saying that
any ibenefit which comes to the less
able and less fortunate must of neces
sity come even more to the more able
and more fortunate. If, therefore, the
less fortunate man is moved by envy of
his more fortunate brother to strike at
the conditions under which they have
both, though unequally, prospered, the
result will assuredly tie that while
damage may come to the one struck at,
Jt will visit with an even heavier load
, the one who strikes the blow. Taken
as a whole, we must all go up or down
together.
Corporations.
Tet. while not merely admitting, but
Insisting upon this, it is also true that
where there is no governmental re
straint or supervision some of the ex
ceptional men use their energies not in
ways that are for the common good,
but in ways which tell against this
common good- The fortunes amassed
through corporate organization are now
so large, and vest such power in those
that wield them, as to make it a mat
ter of necessity to give to the sovereign
that is, to the Government, which
represents the people as a whole
come effective power of supervision ov
er their corporate use- In order to in
sure a healthy social and Industrial life,
ever big corporation should be held
. tr. n..
responsible by, and be accountable to,
some sovereign strong enough to con
trol its conduct. I am in no sense hos
tile to corporations. This is an ago of
combination, and any effort to prevent
all combination will be not only useless
but in the end viciou3, because of the
contempt for law which the failure -to
enforce law inevitably produces. We
should, moreover, recongize in cordial
and ample fashion the immense good
effected by corporate agencies In a
country such as ours, and the wealth
of intellect, energy and fidelity devoted
to their service, and therefore normally
to the service of the public, by their
officers and directors. The corporation
has come to stay; just as the -trade
union has come to stay. Each can do
and has done great good. Each should
be favored so long as it does good. But
each should be sharply ohecked Where
It acts against law and justice.
So long as the finances of the Nation
are kept upon an honest basis no other
question of internal economy with
which the Congress has the power to
deal begins to approach in Importance
the matter of endeavoring to secure
proper Industrial conditions under
which the individuals and especially
the great corporations doing an inter
state business are to act. The makers
of our National Constitution provided
especially that the regulation of inter
state commerce should come within the
sphere of the General Government. The
arguments in favor of their taking this
stand were even then overwhelming.
But they are far stronger to-day, in
view of the enormous development of
great business agencies, usually cor
porate in form. Experience has shown
conclusively that it is useless to try to
get any adequate regulation and super
vision of these great corporations by
state action. Such regulation and su
pervision can only be effectively exer
cised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction
is coextensive with the field of work
of the corporations that is. by the Na
tional Government. I believe that this
regulation and supervision can be ob
tained by bhe enactment of law by the
Congress. If this proves impossible, it
will certainly be necessary ultimately
to confer in fullest form such power
upon the National Government by a
proper amendment of the Constitution.
It would obviously be unwise to en
deavor to secure such an amendment
until it is certain that the result can
not be obtained under the Constitution
as it now is. The laws of the Congress
and of the several states hitherto, as
passed upon by the courts, have re
sulted more often in showing that the
states have no power in the matter
than that the National Government has
power; so that there at present exists
a very unfortunate condition of things,
under which these great corporations
doing an interstate business oocupy
the position of subjects without a sov
ereign, neither any state government
nor the National Government having
effective control over them. Our steady
aim should be by legislation, cautiously
and carefully undertaken, but resolute
ly persevered in, to assert the sov
ereignty of the National Government
by affirmative action.
This is only in' for man Innovation.
In substance it is merely a restoration;
for from the earliest time such regu
lation of industrial activities has been
recognized in the action of the law
making bodies; and all that I propose
is to meet the changed conditions in
such manner as will prevent the Com
monwealth abdicating the power it has
always possessed, not only in this
country but .also in England before
and since this country became a sepa
rate Nation
It has been a misfortune that the
national laws on this subject have
hitherto been of a negative or prohibi
tive rather than an affirmative kind,
and still more that they have In part
sought to prohibit what could not be
effectively prohibited, and have in part
in their prohibitions confounded what
should be allowed and what should not
be allowed- It is generally useless to
try to prohibit all restraint on compe
tition, whether this restraint be rea
sonabl or unreasonable; and where it
is not useless It is generally . hurtful.
E vents have shown that it is not pos
sible oua iy to secure the enf orce
in- nt -S any law of this kind by inees-
san- aj-peal v.. the courts. The Depart
ment of Justice has for the last four
years devnted more attention to the en
forcement of the anti-trust legislation
than to anything else. Much has been
accomplished; particularly marked has
been the moral effect of the prosecu
tions; tut it is increasingly evident
that there will be a very insufficient
beneficial result in the way of economic
change. The successful presecution of
one device to evade the law Immediate
ly develops another device to accom
plish the same purpose. What is need
ed is not sweeping prohibition of every
arrangement, good or bad, which may
tend to restrict competition, but such
adequate supervision and regulation as
will prevent any restriction of compe
tition from being to the detriment of
the public as well as such supervision
and regulation as will prevent other
abuses in no way connected with re
striction of competition. Of these
abuses, perhaps the ckke although by
no means the only onBL s overcapitali
zation generally ltselwfthe result of
dishonest prmotion because of the
myriad evils it brings is its train; for
such overcapitalization otten means an
inflation that invites business panic;
it always conceals the true relation of
the profit earned to the cipUal actual
ly invested, and it creates a burden of
interest payments which is a fertile i
cause of improper reduction in or lira- j
itation of wages; it damages the small j
investor, discourages thrift, and en-1
courages gambling and speculation; i
w.hile perhaps worst of all is the tricki- j
ness and dishonesty which it implies i
for harm to morals is worse than any
possible harm to material interests, and
the debauchery of politics and business
by great dishonest corporations Is far ,
worse than anv actual material evil
they do the public. Until She National
Government obtains, in some mariner
which the wisdom of the Congress may
suggest, proper control over the big
corporations engaged in interstate com
mercethat is, over the great majority
of the, big corporations it will be im
possible to deal adequately with there
evils-
I am well aware of the difficulties of
the legislation that I am sugesting, and
of the need of temperate and cautious
action in securing It- I should em
phatically protest against improperly
radical or hasty action. The first thing
to do is to deal with the great cor
porations engaged in the business of
interstate transportation. As I said
in my message of December 6 last, the
immediate and most pressing need, so
far as legislation is concerned, is the
enactment into laws of some scheme to
secure to the agents of the government
such supervision and regulation of the
rates charged by the railroads of the
country engaged in interstate traffic as
shall summarily and effectively prevenf
the imposition of unjust or unreason-?
able rates. It must include putting a
complete stop to rebates in every shape
and form. This power to regulate rates,
like alt similar powers over the busi
ness world, should be exercised with
moderation, caution' and Eelf-restraint;
but it should exist; sd that it can. bs
effectively exercised when the need
arises.
The first consideration to .'be kept in
mind is that the power should be af
firmative and should be given to some
administrative body created by the
Congress. If given to the present in
terstate Commerce Commission or to a
reorganized Interstate Commerce Com
mission, such commission should be
made unequivocally administrative. I
do not believe In the Government in
terfering with private business more
than is necessary. I do not bslieve in
the Government undertaking any work
which can with propriety be left in pri
vate hands- But neither do I believe In
the Government flinching from over
seeing any work when it becomes evi
dent that abuses are sure to obtain
therein unless there is governmental
supervision. It is not my province to
Indicate the exact terms of the law
which should be enacted; but I call the
attention of the congress to certain ex
isting conditions with which it is desir
able to deal. In my judgment the most
important provision which such law
contain is that conferring upon some
competent administrative body the
power to decide, upon the case being
'brought before it, whether a given rate
prescribed by a railroad is reasonable
and just, and if It is found to be un
reasonable and unjust, then, after full
investigation of the complaint, to pre
scribe the limit of rate beyond which
it shall not be lawful to go the maxi
mum reasonable rate, as it is commonly
called this decision to go into effect
within a reasonable time and to obtain
from thence onward, subject to reviews
by the courts. It sometimes happens at
present, not that a rate is too high, but
that a favored shipper is given too low
a rate. In such case the Commission
would have the right to fix this already
established minimum rate as the max
imum; and it would need only one or
two such decisions by the Commission
to cure railroad companies of the prac
tice of giving improper minimum rates.
I call your attention to the fact that
my proposal is not to give the com
mission power to initiate or originate
rates generally, but to regulate a rate
already fixed or originated by the
roads, upon complaint and after inves
tigation. A heavy penalty should be
exacted from any corporation which
fails to respect an order of the Com
mission. I regard this power to estab
lish a maximum rate as being essential
to any scheme of real reform in the
matter of railway regulation . The first
necessity is to secure it; and unless it
is granted to the Commission there Is
little use in touching the subject at all.
Illegal transactions often occur under
the forms of law. It has often occurr
ed that a shipper has been told by a
traffic officer to buy a large quantity
of some commodity, and then often it
has been bought an open reduction is
made in the rate to take effect imme
diately, the arrangement resulting to
the profit of the one shipper ard the
one railroad and to the damage of all
their competitors; for It musifU be
forgotten that the big shippern'e at.
least as much to blame as any railroad
in the matter of rebates. The law I
should make it clear so that nobody
can fail to understand that any kind'
of commission paid on freight ship- J
ments, whether in this form or in the
form of fictitious damages, or of a con-!
cession, a free pass, reduced passenger ;
rate, or payment of brokerage, is il
legal. It is worth while considering
whether it would not be wise to con
fer on the Government - the right ol
civil action against the beneficiary of
a rebate for at least twice the value of
the rebate; this would help stop what
is really blackmail. Elevator allow
ances should be stopped, for they have
now grown to such an extent that they
are demoralizing and are used as re
bates. The best possible regulation of rates
would, of course, be that regulation se
cured by an honest agreement among
the railroads themselves to carry out
the law. Such a general agreement
would, for instance, at once put a stop
to the efforts of any one big shipper
or big railroad to discriminate against
or secure advantages over some rival;
and such agreement would make the
railroads themselves agents for enforc
ing the law. The power vested in the
Government to put a stop to agres-1
ments to the detriment of the public ;
should, in m;- judgment, be accom-1
panied by power to permit, under 1
specified conditions and careful super-!
vision, agreements clearly in the In- i
terest of the public. But, in my judg-l
ment, the necessity for giving thlsi
further power is by no means as great
as the necessity for giving the Com-
mislon or administrative body the oth- (
er powers I have enumerated above; j
and it may well be inadvisable to at-1
tempt to vest this particular power in j
the Commission or other administrative
body until it already possesses and is
exercising what I regard as by far the
most impartant of all the powers I rec
, ommend as indeed the vitally Import-1
ant power that to fix a given maxl-1
mum rate, which rate, after the lapse1
of a reasonable time, goes into full ef-j
feet, subject to review by the courts.
All private-car, lines, industrial roads,
i refrigerator charges, and the liko,
should be expressly put under the sup
ervision of the Interstate Commerce
commission or some similar body so far
as rates, and agreements practically
affecting rates, are concerned. The
private-car owners and the owners of
industrial railroads re entitled to a
fair and reasonable compensation on
their investment, bat neither private
cars nor industrial railroads nor spur
tracks should be utilized as devices for
securing prefenential rates. A rebate
in icing charges,' or In mileage, or in a
division of the 'rate for refrigerating
charges is just as pernicious as a re
bate In any other way. No lower rate
shoul apply on 'goods imported than
actually obtains' qn: domestic goods
from the American seaboard to desti
nation except j cases where water
competition is thje controlling influence.
There should b4 publicity of the ac-
i counts of common carriers; no com
mon carrier engaged in Interstate busi-
i ness should keep any books or memo-'
randa other tljan, those reported pur
suant ;to law or regulation, and these
books or memoranda should be open to
' the inspection of the Government. Only
in this way can violations or evasions
of the law be surely detected. A sys
tem of examination of railroad ac-;
counts should be provided similar to
that now conducted into the national
' banks by the bank examiners; a few
first-class railroad accountants, if they
had proper direction and proper au-
, thorlty to inspect books and papers,
could accomplish much in preventing
' willful violationsof the law. It would
, not be necessary for them to examine
, into the accounts of any railroad un-
j less for good reasons they were directed
to do so by th Interstate Commerce
! Commission. It is greatly to be desired
j that some way might be found by
I whioh an agreement as to transporta-
i tion within a stste intended to operate
as a fraud upon the Federal Interstate
commerce laws could be brought under
the Jurisdiction of the Federal authori
ties. At present it occurs that large
shipments of Interstate traffic are con
trolled by concessions on purely state
business, which of course amounts to
an evasion of (he law. The Commis
sion should have power to enforce fair
treatment by tie great trunk lines of
lateral and braiph lines.
I urge upon me congress the need of
providing expeditious action by the In
terstate Commiree Commission in all
these matters, jwhether in regulating
rates for transportation or for storing
or for handling! property or commodi
ties in transit. tThe history of the cases
litigated under ' the present commerce
act shows that its efficacy has been to
a great degree destroyed by the weapon
of delay, almost the most formidable
weapon in the hands of those whose
purpose it Is to violate the law.
Let me most earnestly say that these
recommendations are not made in any
spirit of hostility to the railroads. On
ethical grounds, on grounds of right,
such hostility would be Intolerable; and
on grounds of mere national selMn
terest we must remember that such
hostility would tell against the welfare
not merely of some few rich men, but
of a multitude of small investors, a
multitude of railway employees, wage
workers; and most severely against
the interest of the public as a whole.
I believe that on the whole our rail
roads have done well and not ill; but
the railroad men who wish to do well
should not be exposed to competition
with those who have no such desire,
and the only way to secure this end is
to give to some Government tribunal
the power to see that justice is done
by the unwilling exactly as it is gladly
done by the willing. Moreover, if some
Government body Is given increased
power the effect will be to furnish au
thoritative answer on behalf of the rail
road whenever irrational clamor against
it is raised, or whenever charges
made against it are disproved. I
ask this legislation not only in the
interest of the public but in the interest
of the honest railroad man and the
honest shipper alike, for it is they who
are chiefly jeoparded by the practices
of their dishonest competitors. This
legislation should be enacted on a spirit
as remote as possible from hysteria
and rancor. If we of the American
body politic are true to the traditions
we have inherited we shall always
scorn any effort to make us hate any
man because he is rich, just as much
as we should scorn, any effort to make
us look down upon or treat contemptu
ously any man because he Is poor. We
Judge a man by his conduct that is.
by his character and not by his wealth
or intellect. If he makes his fortune
honestly, there is no just cause of
quarrel with him. Indeed, we have
nothing but the kindliest feelings of
admiration for the successful business
man who behaves decently, whether he
has made his success by building or
managing a railroad or by shipping
goods over that railroad. The big rail
road men and big shippers are simply
Americans of the ordinary tpye who
have developed to an extraordinary de
gree certain great business qualities
They are neither better nor worse than
their fellow-citizens of smaller means
They are merely more able in certain
lines and therefore exposed to certain
peculiarly strong temptations. These
temptations have not sprung newly In
to being; the exceptionally successful
among mankind have always been ex
posed to them; but they have grown
amazingly in power as a result of the
extraordinary development of indus
trialism along new lines, and under
these new conditions, which the law
niagers of old could not forsee and
therefore could not provide against
they have become so serious and men
acing as to demand entirely new rem
edies. It is in the interest of the best
type of railroad man and the best type
of shipper no less than the public
that there should be governmental sup
ervision and regulation of these great
business operations, for the same rea
son that it is in the Interest of the
corporation which wishes to treat Its
employees aright that there should be
an effective employers' liability act, or
an effective system of factory laws to
prevent the abuse of women and child
ren? All such legislation frees the cor
poration that wishes to do well from
being driven into doing ill, in order to
compete with its rival, which prefers to
do ill. We desire to set up a moral
standard. There can be no delusion
mope fatal to the Nation than the de
lusion that the standard of profits, of
business prosperity, is sufficient in
judging any business or political ques
tion from rate legislation to municipal
government. Business success, whether
for the individual or for the Nation,
is a good thing only so far as it is ac
companied by and develops a high
standard of conduct honor, integrity,
civic courage, The kind of business
prosperity that blunts the standard of
honor, that puts an' inordinate value
on mere wealth, that makes a man
ruthless and conscienceless in trade
and weak and cowardly in citizenship,
Is not a good thing at all, but a very
ibad thing for the Nation. This Govern
ment stands for manhood first and for
business only as an adjunct of man- j
hood.
The question of transportation lies at
the root of all industrial success, and
the revolution in transportation which
has taken place during the last half
century has been the most Important
factor in the growth of the new indus
trial conditions. Most emphatically we
; do not wish to see the man of great
talents refused the reward for his tal
, ents- Still less do we wish to see him
penalized; but we do desire to see
: the system of railroad transportation
: so handled that the strong man shall
be given no advantage over the weak
man. We wish to insure as fair treat
ment for the small town as for the
big city; for the small shipper as for
the big shipper. In the old days the
highway of commerce, whether by wat
er or by a road on land, was open to
all; it belonged to the public and the
traffic along it was free. At present
i the railway is this highway, arid we
' must do our best to see that It is kept
open to all on equal terms. Unlike the
old highway, it is a very difficult and
1 complex thing to manage, and it is far
better that it should be managed by
private individuals than by the govern
ment. But it can only be so managed
: on condition that justice is done the
public. It is because, in my Judgment,
public ownership of railroads is highly
j undesirable and would probably in this
j country entail far-ending disaster, that
' I wish to see such supervision and reg-
ulation of them in the interest of the
1 public as will make it evident that
there is no need for public ownership.
; The oponents of Government regula-'
j tion dwell upon the difficulties to be
: encountered and the Intricate and in
1 volved nature of the problem. Their
contention- is true. It is a complicated
! and delicate problem, and all kinds of
i difficulties are sure to arise in connec
tion with any plan of solution, while no
plan will bring all the benefits hoped
for by its more optimistic adherents.
Moreover, under any healthy plan, the
benefits will develop gradually and not
rapidly. Finally, we must clearly un
derstand that the public servants who
are to do this peculiarly responsible
and delicate work must themselves be
of the highest type both as regards
integrity and efficiency. They must be
well paid, for otherwise able men can
not in the long run be secured; and
they must possess a lofty probity which
will revolt as quickly at the thought
of pandering to any gust of popular
prejudice against rich men as at the
thought of anything even remotely re
sembling subserviency to rich men.
But while I fully admit the difficulties
in the way, I do not for a moment ad
mit that these difficulties warrant us
in stoping in our effort to secure a wise
and Just system. They should have no
other effect than to spur us on to the
exercise of the resolution, the even
handed justice, and the fertility of re
source, which we like to think of as
typically American, and which will in
the end achieve good results in this as
In other fields of activity. The task is
a great one and underlies the task of
dealing with the whole industrial prob
lem. But the fact that It is a great
problem does not warrant us in shrink
ing from the attempt to solve it. At
present we face such utter lack of
supervision, such freedom from the re
straints of law, that excellent men have
have often been literally forced into
doing what they deplored because oth
erwise they were left at the mercy of
unscrupulous competitors. To rail at
and assail the men who haVe done as
they best could under such conditions
accomplishes little. What we need to
do is to develop an orderly system;
and such a system can only come
through the gradually increased exer
cise of the right of efficient Govern
ment control.
Safety Appliance.
In my annual message to the Fifty
eighth Congress, at its third session, I
called attention to the necessity for
legislation requiring the use of block
signals upon railroads engaged in inter
state commerce. The number of ser
ious collisions upon unblocked roads
that have occurred within the past
year adds force to the recommendation
then made. The Congress should pro
vide, by approriate legislation, for the
introduction of block signals upon all
railroads engaged in interstate com
merce at the earliest practicable date,
as a measure of increased safety to the
traveling public.
Through decisions of the supreme
Court of the United States and the low
er Federal courts in cases brought be
fore them for adjudication the safety
appliance law has been materially
strengthened, and the Government has
been enabled to secure Its effective en
forcement in almost all cases, with the
result that the condition of railroad
equipment throughout the country is
much improved and railroad employees
perform their duties under safer con
ditions than heretofore. The Govern
ment's most effective aid in arriving
at 'this result has been its inspection
service, and that these improved con
ditions are not more general Is due.- to
the insufficient unmber of inspectors
employed. The inspection service has
fully demonstrated its usefulness, and
in appropriating for its maintenance
the Congress should make provision for
an increase in the number of inspectors.
Honrs of Labor of Railroad Employees
The excessive hours of labor to' which
railroad employees in train service are
in many cases subjected is also a mat
ter which may well engage the serious
attention of the Congress. The strain,
both mental and physical, upon those
who are engaged In the movement and
operation of railroad trains under
modern conditions is perhaps greater
than that which exists in any other in
dustry, and if there are any reasons for
limiting by law .the hours of labor in
any employment, they certainly apply
with peculiar force to-the employment
of those upon whose vigilance and
alertness in the performance of their
duties the safety iof all who travel by
rail depends. ' J . ;
. Employers' Liability Law.
In my annual message to the Fifty
seventh Congress, at its second session,
I recommended the passage of an Em
ployers' , Liability Law for the District
of Columbia and in our navy yards. I
renewed that recommendation in my
message to the Fifty-eighth Congress,
at its second sesion,' and further sug
gested the appointment of a, commis
sion to make a comprehensive study of
employers' liability, with a view to' the
enactment of a wise and constitutional
law covering the subject, applicable to
all industries within the scope of' the
federal power. I hope that such a law
will be prepared and enacted as speed
ily as possible.
Labor. -
The National Government has as a
rule but little occasion todeal with the
formidable group of problems connect
ed more or less directly with what is
known as the labor question, for In the
great majority of cases these problems
must be dealt with by the state and
municipal anthorities and not by the
National Government. The National
Government has control, of the District
of Columbia, however, and it should
see to it that the ", City of Washington
is made a model city in all respects,
both as regards parks, public play
grounds, proper regulation of the sys
tem of housing so as to do away with
the evils of alley tenements, a proper
system of education, a proper system
of dealing with truancy and juvenile
offenders, a proper handling of the
charitable work of the District- More
over, .there should be proper factory
laws to prevent all abuses in the em
ployemnt of women and children in the
District. These will be useful chiefly
as object lessons, but even ithis limited
amount of usefulness would be of real
national value.
There has been demand for depriv
ing courts of the power to issue in
junctions in labor disputes. Such spec
ial limitation of the equity powers of
our courts would 'be most unwise. It is
true that Borne judges have misused
this power; but this does not justify
a denial of the power any more than an
improper exercise of the power to call
a strike by a labor leader .would Justify
(the denial of the right to strike. The
remedy is to regulate the procedure by
requiring the writ, the hearing to be ex
parte if the adverse party does not
appear at ithe time and place ordered.
What is due notice must depend upon
the facts of the case; it shoould not be
used as a pretext to permit violation of
law, or the jeopardizing of life or prop
erty. Of course, ithis would not autho
rize the issuing of a restraining order
or injunction in any case in which it
is not already authorized by existing
law.
I renew the recommendation I made
in my last anual message for an in
vestigation by the Department of Com
merce and labor of general labor con
ditions, especial attention to be paid
to the conditions of child labor
and child-labor legislation in the sev.
eral states. Such an investigation
should take into account the various
problems with which the question of
child labor is connected. It is true that
these problems can be actually met in
most cases only by the states them
selves, but it would be well for the
Nation to endeavor to secure and pub
lish comprehensive information- as to
the conditions of the labor of children
in the different states, so as to spur
up those that are behindhand, and to
secure approximately uniform legisla
tion of a high character among the sev
eral states. In such a Republic as ours
the one thing that we cannot afford to
neglect is the problem of iturnlng out
decent citizens. The future if the Na
tion depends upon the citizenship pt
the generations to come; the children
of to-day are those who to-morrow will
shape ithe destiny of our land, and we
cannot afford to neglect them. The
legislature of Colorado has recommend
ed that the National Government pro
vide some general measure for the pro
tection from abuse of children and
dumb animals throughout the Unked
States. I lav the matter before, you
for what I trust will be your favorable
consideration.
Department of Commerce and Labor.
The department of commerce and la
bor should also make a thoroughjsrC'Ss'.""'
tigation of the conditions of -women in
industry. Over five million American
women are now engaged in gainful oc
cupations; yet there is an almost com
plete dearth of data upon which to base
any trustworthy conclusions as regards
a subject as important as it is vast and
complicated. There - is need of full
knowledge on which to' base action
looking toward state and municipal
legislation for the protection of working
women. The introduction of women
into industry is working change and
disturbance in the domestic and social
life of the nation. The decrease in
marriage, and especially ' in the birth
rate, has been coincident with it. We
must face accomplished facts, and the
adjustment to factory conditions must
be made; but surely it can be made
with less friction and less harmful ef
fects on family life than is now the
case. This whole matter in reality
forms one of the greatest sociological
phenomena of our time; it is a social
question of the first importance, of far
greater importance than any merely
political or economic question can be;
and to solve it we need ample data,
gathered in. a sane and scientific spirit
in the course of an exhaustive investi
gation. . '
In any great labor disturbance not
only are employer and employe inter
ested, but also a third party ithe gen
eral public. Every considerable labor
difficulty in which interstate commerce
is involved should be investigated by
the government and the facts officially
reported to the public.
The question of securing; a healthy,
self-respecting and mutually sympa
thetic attitude as between employer and
employe, capitalist and wage-worker, is
a difficult one. All phases of - the labor
problem prove difficult when approach
ed. But the underlying principles, the
root principles, in accordance with
which the problem must be solved, are
entirely .simple We can get justice
and right dealing only if we put as of
paramount importance the principle of
treating a man on hiB worth as a man.
rather than with reference to his social
position, his occupation, or the class to ,
which he belongs. There are-ssHtsh'
and brutal men in all ranks of life, v If
they are capitalists their selfishness
and brutality may. take .the form .of
hard indifference to suffering, greedy
disregard of every' moral restraint
which interferes with the accumulation
of 'wealth, and cold-blooded exploita
tion of the weak; or, if they are labor
ers, the form of laziness, of sullen envy
of the more fortunate, and of willing
ness to perform deeds of murderous vi
olence. Such conduct is just as repre
hensible in one case as in the other,
and all honest and farseeing men
should join in warring against it wher
ever itbecomes manifest. Individual
capitalist and individual wage-worker,
corporation and union, are alike enti
tled to" the protection of . the law, and
must alike obey .the law. Moreover, in
addition to mere obedience to the law,
each man, if he be really a good- citi
zen, must show broad sympathy for his
! neighbor and genuine desire to look at
;any question arising between them from
the standpoint of that neighbor no less
than from his own; and to this end it
is essential that capitalist and wage
worker should consult freely one with
the other, should each strive to bring
closer the day when both shall realize
that they are properly partners and not .
enemies. To approach the questions
which inevitably arise between them
solely from the standpoint which treats
each side in the mass as the enemy of
the other side in the mass is both
wicked and foolish. In the past the
most direful among the influences
which have brought about the downfall
of republics has ever been the growth
of the' class spirit, the growth of, the
spirit which tends to make a yan sub
ordinate the welfare of the public an a
whole to the welfare of the particular
class to which he belongs, the substitu
tion of loyalty to a class for loyalty to
the nation. This inevitably brings about
a tendency to treat each man not on
his merits as an. individual, but on his
position as belonging to a certain class
in the community. , If such a spirit
grows up in this republic it will , ulti
mately prove fatal to us, as in the past
it has proved fatal to every community
in which it has become dominant. Un
less we continue to keep a quick and
lively sense of the great fundamental
truth that our concern it with the in
dividual worth of the individual man,
this government cannot permanently
hold the place' which it has achieved
among the nations. The vital lines of
cleavage among our people do not cor
respond, and Indeed run at right angles
to, the lines of cleavage which divide
occupation from occupation, which di
vide wage-workers from capitalists,
j farmers from bankers, men of small
means from men of large means, men
who live in the towns from men who
live in the country; for the vital line of
cleavage is the line which divides, the
honest man who tries to do well by his
neighbor from the dishonest man who
does ill by his neighbor. : In other
words, the standard we should estabsr
lish is the standard of conduct, not the
standard of occupation, of means, or of
social position. It is the man's moral
quality, his attitude toward the ' great
questions which concern all humanity,
his cleanliness of life, his power to do
his duty toward himself and toward
others, which Teally count; and if we
substitute for the standard of personal
