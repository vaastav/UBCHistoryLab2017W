THE SUBJECT OF CIRCULATION.
An Irronfom llea About the Volume
Thereof National Itank.
The imporUiot subject of circulation,
the secretary says, has been unusually
prominent duringthe past twelve months.
The stringency in the money market dur
ing the summer and autumn of 1S1U, he
says, was relieved by the prompt and ef
fective measures of his predecessor and
happiiy disappeared without producing
the grave consequences which were feared
by the public; but its existence, and tin
widespread apprehension which it caused
induced a tevival of the erroneous idea
that the volume of money in circulation
was not only inadequate to the needs of
the country, but was very much less per
capita than during the so-called ilush
ttmes which followed the civil war.
I'lrnty of Money In the Country.
The amount of money in circulation has
been vtry largely increased since the close
of tiie fiscal year. The amount July 1,
1'.M, was $l,4;-7 43 ..Vi7 and the amount
per r ivita was 41. The ret urn of gold
to t lit- L'nited States, the operation of the
bilver note act. and disbursements by the
treasury on account of the 4' 4 per cent,
loan, pensions, etc., enlarged tlie volume
on Dec. 1 to $1,577 2t,o7 , and the per cap
ita amount to $24 3s
Indorse I.hccv'h MicgeMion.
On the subject of natioual banks the
secretary invites favorable attention to
the recommendations of the comptroller
that the present law be so amended as to
provide that no association (-hall hi re
quired to maintain a bond deposit of more
than $l,0iKl to insure circulation; that,
every association may issue circulating
notes equal to the par value of the bonds
so deposited; that the monthly withdraw
al of bonds pledged to secure such notes
shall not exceed $3,000,000 in the aggre
gate, and that the semi-annual duty ou
circulation be so reduced as to equal of
one per cent.
Effort or the Tariff Law.
Of the practical effect of the new tariff
law the secretary, after exhibiting the
figures relating to foreign commerce used
by the president in his message, says it
has reduced the price of sugar to the peo
ple without conflict with the principle of
protection because we cannot raise near
all the sugar we need; thaton articles u
which we compete with foreigner coun
tries it is a tax on the foreign producer,
who has to pay the duty if he wants to
compete with us in our own country, ami
that a comparison of the prices of goods
will prove the assertion.
Reciprocity, Immigration, Etc
Of reciprocity the secretary says it has
already enlarged " our trade with Laiiu
America several millions, although it
has beeu in force but. a few months, lie
says it is imperative that some bar should
be put up against the immigration into
this country of Europeau paupers, con
victs and oiner undesirable classes, but
that the law is defective, and congress
only can make it efficient. New legisla
tion is needed also in regard to the Chi
nese if they are to bfc kept out of this
country. '

Washington, Dec :o. The president's

WASHiNGTON.Dec 10. Cooperof Iudiana
stated yesterday that he proposed early
in January to offer a resolution in the house
providing for a thorough and rigid ex
amination of the management of the pen
sion office under Commissioner llaum.
His reason for delaying the matter is that
he is going to Indiana on business, and
cannot return to Washington until after
the holidays.
Will Let Vp If Ha ii in Is Krmovrd.
He said also that he would not press the
inquiry should General Kium be re
moved, and yet he did not like to appear
in the attitude of threatening the admin
istration; but in view of what has already
transpired he would not consider himself
true to his constituents and the country
if he did not do his utmost to havp
Haum's administration of pension office
affairs thoroughly investigated.
CHILI WILL NOT APOLOGIZE.
The President's Message Regarded as
Menacing a Hutuie.
Valparaiso, Dec 10. The substance of
President Harrison's statement of Chil
ian affairs was received yesterday and is
a subject of universal comment. It is re
garded by the Chilians as decidedly
menacing a ruptura between the two
countries, as it is not believed that the
Chilian government will consent either to
an apoloey or any material indemnity.
The majority in congress is known to be
opposed to any concession, and the Chil
ian government, although possessed of
great influence, would find it diflcult to
carry the necessary support .for auy
humiliating measures. It is now no
secret that the government is proceed
ing actively with warlike preparations,
and that artillery of the latest manufac
ture has been ordered from Germany in
anticipation of hostilities, possibly with
other powers, and probably with the
United States.
