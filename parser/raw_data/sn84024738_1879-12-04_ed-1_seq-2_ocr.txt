Governor's Message. *
"We print, this morning the annual men
WSjKTtif tbe Governor of Virginia lo 'the
CScneral Assembly?sent in to that body ;
yesterday. j
Governor Hollidat stands firm upon tiis
feet, as might have been expected. He lays
fccfore the Legislature unimpeachable facts
and figures to prove beyond all room for
eavjl that the McCulloch settlement was a
wise measure, and that to carry it into full
operation will be the best way? nay, the
only way ? in which thts good old Common
wealth can be relieved of her financial dif
ficulties and freed from all the embarrass
ments that result from those difficulties.
The Governor recalls to the minds of the
members the fact that the McCulloch bill
was passed by large majorities in both
bouses of the General Assembly after the I
gravest consideration aud the most thor
ough discussion. He says the outside
world regarded it as a fair and reasonable re
adjustment; and be well asks why our peo
ple should not accept it. He tells the Le
gislature that he regards the amount of the
debt as of but little import compared with
the credit of Virginia. Here is a striking
remark, which it would be well for the peo
ple of Virginia to ponder :
44 The investment of more taxes in such
a cjife would yield a far greater revenue
? than that invested in any war in which our
'ancestors ever engaged for the vindication
of the rlcht, both in the material develop
ment of our resources, and the hardy, ro
bust, and honest growth of our people's
character."
Never were truer words spoken. tl That
increase, however, need not be resorted to
now," says the Governor. Nor ever, if the
Jkfct'ULi.ocH settlement be perfected, he
adds in substance elsewhere in his message.
The Governor next resorts to figures. He
quotes from bis last annual message what
be said on this subject. He then gives a
scries of official statements, or tables, con
taining a large amount of valuable infor
mation concerning the debt, and showing
hi>\v under the AIcCclloch settlement the
entire interest could be paid without any
increase of taxation. The reader will find
these tables elsewhere in our columns.
The Governor then considers the methods
of adding to the revenue without any in
cifa-c of the rate of taxation; and finds
that the rigid enforcement of the iloflett
regiakr law would perhaps result in a reve
nue from that source of a million of dol
lar*. On this point he quotes from a letter
of Judge George L. Cukistuk, of this city,
?who is, the Governor thinks, better able to
form an accurate opinion than any other
man hi the State.
Next, the Governor expresses bis belief
tha{ the present Legislature will economize
the resources of the State, and provide for
the support of government and the public
schools and "the payment of the debt."
TVe quote:
?< Whatever may be the views of some, I
leel that should the present funding bill by
any means be stopped in its execution it
would be a great misfortune. It bus been
regarded by the world as a fair and hon
orable settlement between the Common
wealth and her creditors, and though the
iundiug under it has progressed with re*
workable rapidity considering the impedi
ments that have been thrown in its way, we
have every reason to believe that had no
opposition been manifested, and its repeal
not been mooted, the bonds by this time
?would have been well nigh all brought in
to be funded under its provisions."
The Governor can't believe that the Re
adju>ters will allow a wound to be inflicted
*pon Virginia. We shall see.
The Governor coucludes what he had to
say on the debt question by an eloquent ap
peal to tbe General Assembly.
The Governor then winds up his message
in short order, making brief references to
various matters? so brief that every reader
is referred to the message itself for what he
says on those topics.
The real people of Virginia will applaud
their Governor for bis firmness, consist
ency, honesty, and patriotism. They can
rest in the assurance that if harm comes to
the State it will not come with bis assistance
or bis consent, nor without his having doue. i
I
all that becomes a true mau to shield her
honor.
God save the Commonwealth.
The Negro Redivivus.
Tbe uegro voters elected a large number
of tbe rat-tubers of tbe present General As
sembly by tbeir casting vote in counties
and cities where the white people were
divided in opinion; and the negroes yes
terday performed the same service for their
new allies in electing in like manner the
officers of tbe House of Delegatea. By the
aid of negro votes the ReSdj listers succeed
ed in organizing the House of Delegates
and turning out the old and faithful officers
of that body. See proceedings of the Legis
lature.
Bui that is not the worst or the story. I
The Re&djusters paid off their allies by
fleeting two negro Radicals to office in
place of two Confederate soldiers? one of
them a one-armed man, and tbe other a
one-legged man ! They threw this insult
into the faces of tbe people of Virginia as
if they knew that their only chance to get
office and emoluments was in their hands
now. It needs not that we characterize
this action otherwise. The people will
know what it means.
"Whom the gods would destroy they
first make mad." It would seem as if the
leaders or this wild revolution had been
stricken with judicial blindness. They
cannot possibly hope to have their acts ap
proved by the people of Virginia, Their
reckless leader may get into the United
States Senate lor six years ; hut his party
Will have u died aborning."
What is to be tbe result? The leaders
have deserted the Conservative party and
burnt their ships. They have no intention
of returning to the fold of that party. On
the contrary, they have fully made up their
minds that their ouly prospect of success
lierealter lies in the organization of a new
party composed of a few whites and ail the
negroes? just such a party as that which
existed here in the days when Undebwood,
Hummcutt, Joe Cox, Specs Hodges, and
others of the same tribe, dominated in tbe
Capitol and made a constitution for Vir
ginia.
But can they form such a party ? We
think not; but we need not atop to say
Why. We go on to ask what is to become
of. the Republican party? Whence are to
come tbe voters that up to November last
made up that organization f It to none of
our fight now. It has passed over from tbe
Conservative party to fcbe Republican party.
The Conservative party is . essentially a
white join's party. The opposing party
must necessarily be composed largely of
?e?foe*j Tbe new party aud the BepubU

that they have done the same thing in tbat
body. Without their votes the Reitdjusters
would have been powerless t&j&lcct a.&inglti
officer. Here is a fact wbicb is spread upon
the record, and which cannot be explained
away by false statements and clouded sta
tistics. Let tbe reader now recall our
tBbles, and be will see that a necessity was
laid upon tbe Reiidjusters to recognize.

The Colored Vote.? McCaull beat Big
ger by 16 majority for Clerk of the House
of Delegates, receiving 57 votes to Bigoer's
41. The negroes who voted for McCaull
are Cole, Dunoee, Owens, Scott, Collins,
Evans, Hamilton, Faige, Bland, Lewis,
and Norton? eleven in all. Take 11 from
57 and add 11 to 41, and the result would
be for Bigger 52, McCaull 46. Or if the
eleven negroes bad even thrown away their
votes, by voting for a Republican, McCaull
would have failed of election. " The col
ored troops fit nobly."

GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE.
Commonwealth op Virginia, }
Goveknor's Office.
Richmond, Va., December 3. 1879. )
Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Dele
gates :
The last General Assembly passed a bill
relatinir to Hie funding of the State debt,
which became a law. Pending its passage
it received full and careful discussion, and
was regarded as a'fair and amicable settle
ment between the State and her creditors
by large majorities of both branches of
your honorable body.
Before, the expiialion of the time as lim
ited by the tilth section of the law, the
Council of Foreign Bondholders and the
Funding Association of the United States
of America tiled their assent and acceptance
of the terms of the act. It became a con
tract between them and the State, and the
Governor, as ordered therein, provided for
the preparation of the bonds.
So soon as possible thereafter the funding
began, and progressed rapidly under the
conditions of the law. In a little while
agitation was commenced looking to its re
peal, which, of course, had a tendency to
check the bringing in of the old bonds?
the holders being deterred from so doing
by Ibis threatened repeal.
Notwithstanding this agitation, how
ever, they came in such numbers as to ex
ceed the legal requirements, givipg indica
tion, if not full proof, of the ultimate suc
cess of the scheme. By the limitations of
the law eight millions were to have
been presented iu specified kinds and
proportions prior to the 1st day of Jan
uary, 1880 ; -that amount was reached be
fore the 1st day of October, 1879, and the
amount now is $8,491,961.94. in spite of the
obstacles to which 1 have referred.
As already stated, this measure received
the gravest consideration and the most
thorough discussion by your predecessors,
gentlemen who had the ability to compre
hend and the means of knowing the facts
relating to, and the merits of, the question ;
and both those who calfed themselves or
were called Debt-Payers and HeSdjusters,
by a large vote, united upon it as a just ana
equitable settlement, and it was so regarded
and received by the world. I shall, there
fore, not consume time by rehearsing the
history of the origin and growth and com
pletion of this settlement save that it was
made in this city after long conference;
and the best evidence that it met the ap
proval of the creditors is the fact that they
have accepted its provisions with greater
rapidity than was contemplated by the Gen
eral Assembly when they were adopted,
and the further fact that we hear no pro
test from them at home or abroad, bo far
as 1 can gather, the ou'side world regarded
it as, under the circumstances, fair and rea
sonable, and such as would in no way im
pinge upon the honor of the State, which
was a matter of vital import in any settle
ment we might make if we would preserve
Virginia's place among the natiens of the
earth.
Agreeable to the creditor, approved by
the opinion of the world, why should it not
be accepted by the people of the State as In
every way a desirable conclusion of a ques
tion whose agitation has cost far more than
the whole sum involved to the material in
terests of the Commonwealth? My views
are very clear and decided, and have been
frequently officially expressed, that the
money represented in the interest or even
principal or the debt, large as it is, is of but
little import in comparison with the State's
credit, and that nothing save inability can
justify or excuse its non-payment. Its
amount has been over and over agaiu ac
knowledged, and its consideration admitted
by the General Assembly from session to
session aud from year to year, and promises
made to pay it, and a people who have in
the past undergone so much and so many
things in consideration of principle cannot
allow in comparison slight and trivial in
conveniences ts stand in the way o? the
performance of their plighted faith.
And this excuse of inability, by reasou
of the devastations *of the war producing
great impoverishment, is at last the funda
mental argument of those who oppose its
payment, and such Is the end to wnich all
arguments have tended that have hitherto
been made in pr^ious Legislatures; and
no one is more furly acquainted with those
devastations than I am or can more hon
estly admit theavf yet I hear- of none who
advocate the reduction ol the present rate
qf taxation, ' all admitting that the people
can stand that, and opposing the settlement
mainly upon the ground that iis terms cau
not be complied with under the present
rates. I am not of those who believe that
a heavier rate cannot be borne to accom
plish so grand an object as the fulfilment of
the State's obligation and the preserva
tion of. her crediii?objects which,
in a republic like ours, far tran
scend every private consideration; in
qeed, which elevate private consid
eration and make the qj partake of the
strength ?nd virtue of |he Commonwealth
itself. The inveetoent of more taxes ta
stich a cause would' yield a. far greater
revenue titan that invested in any war in
rhiob our ancestors ever engaged for , fcbe i
induction of the right, both in the joate
|aJi*Je*elopojettt of out xesourees;>an&the

M~
This was asserted by . -
10 MVSm T414 passage, and before It bpgau
fully to work; experience has verinea nts
8 *o trontml mcsw^rWMji the honor
to submit to the General Assembly I show ed
that under the old funding bill there was an
annual defieit of $770.603.33? Including in
terest on the literary fund, an annual deficit
of $854,952.97: and that to meet this would
require an Increase of from thirty to fort)
cents on the one hundred dollars of proper
ty as now assessed. At tbe fame time I
laid before the Assembly sundry proposi
tions for a settlement, which would also
have required a small increase of the rate
of taxation. These were not accepted, but
one was agreed upon embodied in the ex
isting law which the proper officers of the
Government and the committees having the
matter in charge thought could be earned
out with the present revenues.
Experience, though so short a time has
elapsed, has verified these views. The fol
lowing tables, compiled from data furnished
from tbe offices of the Auditors, will show
the disposition of the revenues, and the
condition of the finances under the opera
tion of the new funding law, and what that
condition would be were It in full operation

The foregoing statement is as of October
1, 1879. Since that time there has been
funded under the present law the sura of
3442,572.14 more, making a total of $8,491,
961.94, and reducing the deficit to the sum
of $116, 188. 01, to which if interest on the
Literary Fund at 3 per cent.? $42, 179.82?
be added, will leave a deticit of $158,367 83,
or with interest on same at 5 and 6 percent,
a deficit of $190,870.12 against a. deticit, as
reported in my lust annual message, of
5854,952,97, thus showing the happy result
of the operation of this law and the various
acts of the last General Assembly reducing
expenses.

the interest on the Literary Fund to be

thereof funded under this law. Statements
4 and 5 show that, were the entire debt
funded under the present law, paying full
interest at the rate of 6 per cent, on the
bonds held by the colleges and Literary
Fund, there would be a surplus in the trea
sury of $260,272.54; and were the bonds
held by the colleges and the Literary Fund
to be funded :..s other outstanding bonds at
3 per cent., there .would be a surplus of
$350,914.19, which would soon discharge the
amount due the schools and take up the

the State of $ 1.367 51
Which added to tfee sur
plus last statt'd above. ..349.556 68
"Would make the total
surplus $350,924 19
These balances can be creatly added to by
the proper enforcement of the revenue laws
without any increnso of the rate of taxa
tion. There r.re very large amounts of per
sonal property, as is well known, not reach
ed, and if reached not properly assessed.
This ought to he done rigidly, so that the
burdens 'shall be equally borne by every
class of tax-payers. There tire other sub
jects to which I invited the notice of the
General Assembly in previous messages,
and which, ir utilized, would yield a con
siderable revenue. And I beg leave more
especially to call your attention to the
" Moifett liquor law," and most respect
fully to urge the adoption of measures to
secure its proper enforcement ; and if this
is not possible, then its repeal, and the
adoption of some other system that can be
effectively carried out. 1 have been at some
pains to gather information about this law,
and the universal sentiment is that if pro
perly enforced it will yield more t ban double,
perhaps treble, the amount it yields now;
indeed, that it will more I ban pay the whole
interest on the State debt under the present
settlement. Among those to whom I ap
plied for information was lion. George L.
Christian, the able and diligent Judge of
the Hustings Court of the city of Rich
mond, who, by reason of bis official posi
tion, is better able to form an accurate opin
ion than any one in the State. In a paper
now before me, in which he discusses fully
the whole subject, he says : "lam perfect
ly satisfied from my experience that there
is a 4 mine of wealth' in the system if it
can be enforced, and I verily believe that if
fully carried out in the Commonwealth it
could be made to prty $1,000,000 annually
without its being felt by those pitying it.
The investigations before me showed that
the net profits on all drinks sold were at
least one hundred per cent., unci frequently
tveo, and sometimes as much as three hun
dred per cent. ; those on alcoholic drinks
varying from Jive to ten cents, nnd those on
malt from two and a half to three cents on
every drink sold. So that you will see that
the subject will really bear a considerable
burden."
I am quite certain your honorable bodies
will, as your predecessors, do everything
in your power to economize the resources
of the State, whilst at the same time you
make them effective for the three great ob
jects to which, by the Constitution and
laws, they are dedicated? the support of
the government, the carrying on of the
public free schools, and the payment of the
debt. Whatever may be the views of some.
I feel that should the present funding bill
by anv means be stopped in Its execution
it would be a great misfortune. It has been
regarded by ttie world as a f;iir and honor
able settlement between the Common wealth
and her creditors, and though the funding
under it has progressed with remarkable
rapidity, considering the impediments that
have been thrown in its way, we have every
reason to believe that had no opposition
been manifested, and its repeal not been ,
mooted, the bonds by this time would have j
been wellnigh all brought in to be funded j
under its provisions. .
I am not of those who, entrenched in
the assumed infallibility of their own
opinion, believe all others to be wrong,
and actuated by impure motives or de
eded t)v ignorance. Human judgment is
fallible, and I give others credit for Integ
rity of purpo.se and purity of intention as
I claim both for myself. I do not, I can
not, beiievc that the members of this Gene
ral Assembly,' however bitter may have
been the contests for their seat*5, or however
profound the feelings aroused in the strug
gle, have now in their high places anything j
but the good of \ irginia at heart, or will .
knowingly allow one aspersion, not to sax
one wound, to be inflicted upon her wel
fare or her fame. Ditl'erent views are en
tertained of how this debt question ought |
to be settled. This must be, when j
there are so many different minds ; it
may be viewing the" question from so many
different standpoints. Hut in a subject of j
such difficulty, surrounded and interwoven j
with so many troublesome and intricate i
problems, each cannot expect to have his
own peculiar views adopted to the exclu
sion of those of every other. There must j
be conciliation and compromise. The pres- j
eut law was the resuit of the operation of j
just such motives.
Sure I am, that the first thing? the pole
star, as it were, of any path along which j
we may travel ? is the constant and ever- :
present claim of the State's honor and good ;
name; and though men may in moments of .
excitement or forgetfulness treat them
lightly, it comes back when calmness and
memory have resumed their place with
thousandfold power to assert their su- ,
premacy. r. .....
Never was there a time in Virginia'? his
tory when such a spirit was more urgently
demanded of those who have her dsstinies
in hand than that in which we live. Amid
tbe elements in play about us, tilled with
fearful forces, it becomes those who are
entrusted with office, and who through it
will fix her fate for weal or for woe, to dis
card prejudice, to forget self, and to think
only of bow the Commonwealth can be
brought safely through into the fruitiou of
the peace and prosperity which her people
once enjoyed and which made them so re
spected and so powerful. Selfishness, pas
sion, and prejudice have no business with
us in legislation at such an hour ; they can
only drive us far and still farther from our
moorings and imperil for tbe present and
tbe future the State's truest and best in
terests. Conciliation and quiet reflection
can lift us out of the dangers which now
threaten, and establish firmly thosa princi
ples without which there can be no growth
in individual or national life, and with
which : true statesmanship eve,r deals in
reaching its high and lasting abms.
Such courses made Virginia's name his
toric? to us of this later uge p.nd generation
a priceless heritage, however much it may
be spoken lightly of nowadays by men of
iwhomryou woald expieet better and wiser
things, ^nffa^cbange df^IreudfilAUCfcs
and modes of*i|jought which now prevail
we cannot tio$b in the name^rSle to be po
tential asafft j the arena now is the field of
material do?efoperaent, wielded by tmtner
ic.il force?. And in this field Providence
ha9 blessed us beyond almost any equal area
upon the earth's surface. Resources un
told and easily reached await the hand or
capital and labor. T speak of my own
knowledge, 'Obfained by reason of the office
1 now hold, when L say that both are ready
to come so soop as our financial difficulties
are satisfactorily r.nd honorably settled. It
is not to be expected that they will come
before.
For six years or more the heavy incubus
of business depression has rested upon the
bosom of the entire country. JN'ow there
is a revival spreading with rapidity and
with cheerful influence. Let haste be rnnde
to welcome it, with its rich freight, within
the borders of Virginia. Our finances are
still unsettled, and much of the aid that
was cominjr may pass us by. I proclaim to
the world that Virginia does not intend to
repudiate her debt; that she spurns the
mean and horrid crime. The response is,
let her people prove it by their works.
May they be gifted witlrwisdom in this
day of the State's trial and peril ! Discard
ing anger, self, and unmeaning passion,
may their representatives, in every depart
ment of the government, think only of
how they can preserve her pa^t renown
and provide for her future, and, I hope,
fast-coming greatness ! May we remember
that her credit and yood name are indis
pensnble in whatever scheme may be de
vised, and that without them the structure,
however imposing in its architecture or
skilful in its device, i> built upon the sand
and will not be able to stand the test oi
scrutiny or time.
I submit the reports of the Superinten
dent of Public Instruction, the Treasurer,
Second Auditor, the Adjutant-General, Su
perintendent oi Public Printing, and Com
missioner of Agriculture, to which 1 ask
your attention. I submit also the various re
ports of the asylums and institutions of learn
ing and penitentiary, and ask your conside
ration of the suggestions of their superin
tendents, presidents, and boards. Captain
Charles D. McCoy, the most worthy and
efficient Superintendent of the Asylum for
the Deaf, Dumb and Blind, has died since
the adjournment of the last General Assem
bly. The Board of Visitors oi the inslitu
tion have elected Professor Leonida*
Po.vntz to fill the vacancy caused by his
death. It is also my duty to inform you
the more recent death of Dr. Robert
F. Baldwin, Superintendent of the West
ern Lunatic Asylum. When elected a few
years ago lie was an eminent physician iu the
full practice of his profession, lie entered
upon the discharge of his duties at the asy
lum \vi>h a high sense of the responsibili
ties which belonged to the ofike, and so
bore himself as very soon to win the confi
dence of all by his ability, faith fulness, and
diligence in the discharge of the great trust.
Ui? death is a loss to the institution and to j
the profession of which he was so honored
a member. The vacancy has not been
tilled.
A law was enacted at the last session
"providing for the inspection of cattle,"
and the Governor was ordered to appoint
inspectors at certain places. I have had
great difficulty in tilling tho appointments,
and as yet some of them are vacant, cither
because no suitable peison resided at the
point specified, or bcc.iuse 1 could find no
such person who was willing to accept.
The James River and Kanawha canal re
pairs have been completed, and the convicts
from the penitentiary have been transferred
to the Clifton Forge railroad. The work
upon the canal, under the supervision of
the very energetic and enterprising presi
dent, lias been well and substantially done,
and though the expense to the State has
been large, the benefits to the Valley have
more than compensated for the outlay? the
canal being the only means of communica
tion, and, without the repairs, would soon
haVe been a total wreck. The time for the em
plovmentoi the convicts has expired by lim
itiuion of law, and application will be made
for their continuance till the completion of
the Clifton Forge railroad, which is expect
ed to be a great feeder of the canal. Under
laws of the same session some of the con- j
viets have been assigned to work on the i
Bristol. I. and C. X. G. railroad, and some
on the 2s ew River railroad. There are still
a number of laws authorizing the assign
ment of convicts to other works; but the
supply of that labor is not equal to the de
mand.
At my request the Superintendent of the
Penitentiary reported to me a list of the
convicts who have escaped from the various
companies having them in employ. 1 or
dered him to hand it to the Attorney
General for attention.
Soon alter the adjournment of the Legis
lature last spring, Hon. George W. Lewis,
judge of Westmoreland and Richmond
counties, departed this life , under law, I
appointed Thomas Jones, Esq., of Rich
mond county, to fill the vacancy. Some
time after, lion. E. II. Lane, of Loui-a
connty, died, and I assigned Lion. John L.
Cochran, judge of Albemarle county, to
hold the courts till such time as the va
cancy could be tilled by your honorable
bodies. Both these j udges thus taken ;u\ ay :
were gentlemen of high character, and Ui? j
charged the duties of their responsible
office with ability and integrity. lion.
Winglieid Griffin, judge of Hoancke conn- ;
ty, having been elected prosecuting attor- ?
nev, resigned his office, and I assigned i
Judge John Gardiner, of .Montgomery j
county, to discharge the duties of his office j
till the vacancy could be tilled according to
law. I
Since the adjournment of the last General |
Assembly Major Samuel H. Bovkin, the]
most excellent and popular Register of i
the Land Offic?, has died. I appointed
Col >ncl Randolph Harrison to till the va
c tnev.
1 call your attention to the report of the
Fi>h Commissioner, and to the valuable
work he is doing for the State. This scien
tific and energetic officer is laying the foun- ;
da! ion of a system which, if carried out,
will fill our streams with fish and develop
a source of immense wealth. His etlortsj
are the more praiseworthy as the office is j
without salary. I hope the General A*sem- 1
blv will soon be able to lind the means of j
extending the usefulness of this bureau, ?
and, giving pay to the Commissioner, ena- 1
ble him to devote his whole lime and ener
gies to the work.
In the month of October la-t a meeting of j
the citizens of Yorktown and the neighbor
hood was held for the purpose of inaugu
rating proceedings looking to a celebration
of the centennial anniversary of the sur
render of Lord Coruwallls. Subsequently
there was a meeting of tin* governors of the
original thirteen States ar Independence
Hall, in the city of Philadelphia, h iving the
same object in view. There they were re
ceived most cordially by the Mayor of that j
city and by the Governor of Pennsylvania
and proceeding were had by wbieli all of
the States would be participants and the
affair assumed uational proportions. The j
authorities of the eitv of Richmond have
also taken part in these preliminary pro
ceedings. 1 now bring the subject to your
attention that you may adopt such measures
as may be deemed proper and right in
recognition of an event which took place
upon the soil of Virginia and which tills so
large a space in history.
FRED. W. M. HOLLIDAY.
For IIoiutio Seymour.? There is u very |
strong element among the Democrats of
both houses, who are desirous of persuad
ing Horatio Seymour to accept the presi
dential nomination next year, and 10 secure
from him some assurance that b? will obey
his party's call, if the leaders conclude that
be alone can win (he battle. Such a decla
ration from Mr. Seymour, the Democrats
believe, would relieve them from their
present anxiety as to the ruture. Senator
Kernan, who Mr. Seymour's townsman
and intimate friend, does not abandon the
hope that Mr. Seymour may ultimately con
sent to be a candidate, although he inform
ed the writer to-dav that, just note , "ttio
Governor" is unalterable in his purpose?
" uever again to take part in public affairs."
Mr. Kernan intimated, however, that the
pressure on Mr. Seymour may yet be so
powerful as to force him to succumb, as
I was the ease in 1868 ? Washington telC'
