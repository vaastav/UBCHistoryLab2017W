Tbe President's Message In Parh.
The Bhombcrg Whisky Caie.
London, Dec. 9. The price of rebel
bond are considerably improved recently,
in view of the proposed settlement of the
Alabama claims.
The government will take possession of all
the tulegrapuh lies in the country an the 1st
otrebruary.
Sphinui'iki.u, 111, Dec. 9. Members of the
Couslitulionul UouToution have begun to
arrive.
Tim Governor this morning respited the
sentence ol uauiel ulsh, who was convict
ed for the murder of his wife, iu Chicago,
last summer, uutil January 7, 1870.
It is understood that Judge Edwards, will
preside at the Maconpiu County Cirouit and
other Conrts in the Eighteenth Judicial Cir
cuit, and thua relieve Judge Rice, to enable
him to serve as a member of the constitu
tional Convention.
The report ol the investigation into the
management of tbo affair of the Soldiers'
Orphans' Home was submitted by the Trus
tees to the Governor to day. It covers one
thousand page of foolscap.
Di'Bfyi'K, Iowa, Dee. 9. The Rhoaiberg
whisky case, which has been on trial here
for several days, before Judge Love, in the
United States' District Court, was submitted
to the jury at a quarter past 2 o'clock yes
terday afternoon. The jury remained out
until half-past 12 in the uight, and being un
able to agree, were discharged. Th case
iuvolvcs the amount of tax on twelve hun
dred and fourteen barrels of whisky and
other spirit removed from here to New
York under bond in 1807.
Paris, Deo. 9. That portion of the Pres
ident' Message relating to neutrality in
matters of ocean cables, printed here today
Cannes great excitement.
washikotos, Dec 9. lbB Keconstruo-
tion Committee had a protracted meeting
to-day, when tbe case of Virginia was con
sidered. Gov. Walker made statements in
favor of the immediate admission of the
State, and detailed the manner in which the
election was conducted, insisting that it
was in all respects fair and without intimi
dation or violence. A negro member elect
of the Virginia State Senate also made a
statement to the committee, sustaining
Governor Walker, and protesting against
the test-oath and other measures of what he
terms Radical legislation, lis announced
himself as a Conservative. The Committee
heard tbe Chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee, but came to no
conclusion.
It is ascertained from a reliable source
that at an informal interchange of views by
the members of the House Committee on
Foreiirn Affairs, all the ReDublicans favored
the position taken by the Pretideut in his
message, on the Cuban question, and that
tbe Democratic members, Fernando Wood
and Swan, indicated that they would sus
tain the positions assumed by the adroga
tion, and there waa no ground for aupposing
that tbe insurgents had established a de
facto government.
The Wars and sieaus committee are sun
engaged in disoussing the duty on iron.
They have agreed to increase tbe duty to a
small extent on the manufactured article.
Senator Trumbull, from the Judiciary
Committee, reported a bill, to day, which
provides that the courts of the L ulled States
shall not pass upon any political qustions
that may come belore tbem-tnat no aoutnern
State Government shall be recognized by
Congress; that the Supreme Court shall not
have anbellate jurisdiction in cases arising
out of a proceeding commenced by a writ of
habeat corpu, and tbat tbe President may
proceed to executo judgment against all
military prisoners now held at the South
without regard to aDy decisions which have
been or may be made by the United States
Court. This bill takes the Yeager case and
all similar to it out of court, and allows the
President to cary out tbe the sentence of the
military commissions without regard to the
courts.
The Senate has agreed to adjourn overtill
Monday.
The House makes slow progress with the
Census bill, and there is no prospeot of
reaching a vote. M. Butler iB nrgitig his
amendment to make the Internal Revenue
Assessors do the work of takmg the census.
The appoiutment of Yeaman, as Judge of
the Sixth District, does not give satisfaction
in political circles. None of the appoint
mento are generally satisfactory.
It is charged here that Mr. Pierre,
Baltimore was convicted of defrauding the
revenue in the court over which be is now
called to preside.
