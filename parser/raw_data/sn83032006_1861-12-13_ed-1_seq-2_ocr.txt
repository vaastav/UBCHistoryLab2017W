batteras, Port Royal, Tppee Island, near Sa
vannah, and Ship Island, and wo likewise have
noma general eccounts of popular movements
>o behalf of the Union, in .North Carolina and
Tennessee. Those things demonstrate "that
tho cause of the Union is advancing steadily
Southward.
Since ffur'Uat adjournment, Lieutenant
General Scott has retired trout the head of
(he aruiy. Doriug his long lite the nation has
not been unmindful of his merit.' Yet, on
calling to mind bow faithfully, ably and bril*
iisntiy he has served the country from a time
tar back in our history, whcu few of the now
living had been born, and thencefoi ward contin
ually, I cannot but think we arc still bis debt
oiv 1 >ut irnr, therefore, for your considera
tion, what further mark of recognition is
due to him, and to ourselves, as a grateful
people.
With the retirement of General Scott, came
the executive duty of appointing in his stead
a General in Chief of the array. It is a for
tunate circumstance that neither in council
or country was there, so far a I know any
difference of opinion as to the proper person
to be selected. The retiring Chief repeated*
ly expressed his judgment tu favor of Gener
al Modeller, for the position, aud in this the
uatiou decreed to give a unanimous concur
rence
The designation of General MoClullau is
therefore iu a considerable degree, the selec
tion ot the country, as well as -3§ the Execu
tive, and Lec.ee thero is better reason to hope
ibat there will be given him the confidence and
cordial support thus, by fair implication, prom
ised, and without wbtob he cannot, with so
full t Ihcieocy, serve the country. It has been
said that one bad general is better than two
good ones, and tbe eayiog is true, if taken to
moan no more than that our army is better di
rected by o single mind, thougb inferior, than
by two superior ones at variance and cross
purposes with each other. And the same is
true in alt <oiot observations whereiu those en
gaged oau have none but a common end in
view and can differ only as to the choice of
Uief.CS.
,'.u a storm at 6ea, no one eau wish the ship
to sink. and )et, not uufrtquently, all go down
together, because too many will direct, and
no single mind can be allowed to control.
it continues to develop that the insurrec
tion ts largely, if not exclusively, a war upon
the first principle* * of popular government—
the right* of the ptoplo. (Conclusive evidence
ct this is j'ouud in the most grave and mature
ly considered public documents, as well as in
the general tone of the insurgents.
In these documents we find the abridge
ment of tho existing fight of suffrage, and
the denial to the people of all right to partici
pate in the selection of public officers, ex
cept the Legislature, boldly advocated, with
labored arguments, to prove that large .con
trol of the people in Government is the source
of ail political evil. Alonaicb itself is some
times hinted at as a possible refuge frotn the
power of the poople.
In my preseot position I could scarcely bo
jus titled were 1 to om;t raising a warning voice
against this approach of retnrn'ng despotism.
It is not needed nor fitting here that a gen
eral arguomt should be made in favor of pop
ular institutions. But there is one point with
its ooQueotion3, not so hackneyed as moat oth
ers, to which I ask a brief attention.
It is the effort to place capital on an equal
Routing with if not above labor, in the struc
ture of the Government. It is assumed that
labor is available only in connection with esp
ial that nobody labors unless somebody, else
owing capital, somehow by the use of it, in
duces him to labor. This resumed, it is next
considered whether it is best that capital shall
tire laborers, and thus induce them to work
ty their own consent, or by ibctn and' drive
ibem to it without their oonseot.
Having proceeded so far, it is naturally
ooncluded that ail laborers are either hired
laborers or what we oall slaves. And further,
it is assumed, that whoover is ouoe a hired
laborer, is fixed iu that condition for life.—
Now thero is no suob relation between oapital
and labor, as assumed, nor is there any such
thiDg ss Iree man being fixed for life in the
condition of a hired laborer. Both these as
sumptions are fal.->e, and all inferences from
them are groundless. Labor is prior to and
indepeedent of capital. Capital is only the
fruit of labor and could uever have existed if
labor had not first existod.
liaLcr i the superior of oapital and dei
selves much higher consideration. Capitol
has its rights, wbioh areas worthy of protec
tion as any other rights. Nor is it denied
that there is and probably always will be a
relation between labor and oapital, producing
mutual benefits. Ihe error is in assuming
that the whole labor of the community exists
within that relation.
A few men own capital, and that few would
iabor themselves, and with their capital hire;
or buy another few to labor for them. A large
majority belong to neither class, neither work
others or hive others work for them.
In most ot the Southern States a majority
of the whole people, of ai! colors, are neither
sinves nor masters, while iu the Northern, a
>nrge majority are neither hirers nor hired.—-
.deu with their Utilities wives, sous and daugh
ters, work lor themselves on their farms, in
their houset, and in their shops, taking the
"hole product to themselves, and asking no
iavors of capital on the one hand nor of hired
laborers or slaves on the oihcr.
it is rot forgotten that a considerable num
ber of persons uitogle their own labor with
-heir capital that is, they labor with their
own hands and also buy or hire others to labor
tor them but this is only a mixed and sot a
distinct class No principle stated is disturb
ed by the existence of this class.
Again, as has already been said, there is
•not of necessity any such thing as the free
hired laborer being fixed to that condition for
life. Many independent men everywhere in
• these States a few years back in their lives,
were hired laborers.
The prudent penniless beginner iu the
world, labors for wages a whilo, saves a sur
plus with which to buy tools or land for him
self, then labors on his own account another
while, and at leLgth hireg another new begin
ner to help bim.
This fb the just, and generous, and prosper
ous system which opens the way to all, gives
hope to all, and consequently energy and pro
gress and improvement of condition to all.—
No turn living are mere worthy to be trusted
,1b in thoss who toil up from pavorty.
None less inclined to take or touch aught
which they have not honestly earned. Let
theui beware of surrendering a political power
which they already possess, and which, if sui*
rendered, will surely be use-i to close the
door of advancment against such as they, and
to fix new disabilities and burdeus upon them,
till all of liberty shall be lost.
" From tho first taking of our national census
to the last oue, soveuty years, aud wo fiod
our population at the end of the period eight
times H.N great as it was at the beginning.—
The increase of those other things which
men deem desirable has been greater.
Wo thus have at one view what the popular
principle applied to Government through the
machinery of the States and the Union has
prodoced in a given time, and also what, if
firmly maintained, it promises for tho future.
There are already among us those who, if
the Onion bo preserved, will live to see it con
tain two hundred and fifty millions. The
struggle of to day is not altogether for to day;
it is for a vast future also With a reliance
on Providence, all the more firm and earnest
let us proceed in the great task which events
have devolved upon us.

President's Message
We, this week, Uy before our readers tbe
first Annual Message of President Lincoln. —.
The message has the merit of brevity, and
consequently will be read by nearly every one.
It is pliiuly but ably written, conservative and
Statesmanlike, and meets with general favor.
The President states that "The Union must be
preserved and hence all indispensable means
must be employed." As lira-' passes and ibe
wicked tebellion prog. r en*c f j "indispensable
means" may be employed, iUat B r e now
proposed generally by the people of the loyal
States. Let us hope and pray that the rebel
lion asy be crushed speedily, and that the first
great cause of the rebellion may be placed in
such a position that it may never spring anoth
er civil war upon the people of this once great,
free, united and happy people. On our for
eign policy the message loaves no doubt of
tho oourse to be pursued by the administration.
The honor and dignity of tho nation will be
maintained. The President advocates a rsi
construction of tho Supreme Court. In this
wc think he is eminently right as that Court
was constructed to meet the wants of a few
millions of people. Many of the Districts are
entirely too large, and a single Judge is Dot
able to attend to the whole duties of his (lis*
tiiot. The message is short, and consequently
a further notice from us unnecessary.

DAMP HAMILTON, (
FORTRESS MONROE, Dec. 2, 1861. J
DEAR SIR :—After spending the morning in
listening to tbe heav} cannonading that has
been going on, I thought i would drop you a
line. There has been a fight between here
and Newport News. 1 will give yttu the re
ports just as we have theiu iu our Camp. It
is said that our boys have captured a liebel
vessel with nine hundred rebel oavalry, and
tbe fixings that belong to a Hegiment. Our
loss is said to bo forty killed— wounded not
reported. The vessel was trying to run the
blockade, and was stopped by our troops, and
the firing oouinienoed, and you bad better be
lieve there was soure big thunder foi about two
hours, it commenced at six and lasted until
eight o'olook. it seemed as if tbe earth shook
to its centre. The firing seemed to be heavy
OR both sides. It caused some excitement in
our Camp. You folks at home think perhaps
that kind of noise would be calculated to borify
those that are daily expecting to be ualled on
to fuoe the enemy, but 1 must confess it has
quite a different effect. All our boys seemed
to be anxious that a messenger would come to
oall us out oat to assist. Every eye seemed
to Sash with anxiety, and every heart beat
eager for the contest, as disobarge after dis
charge of cannon was heard. There seeuis to
be something in the life of a soldier that en
tirely rids him of that fear which is natural to
men at home. The vessol is called the York
town, a large Rebel vessel. Our uien have
been doing some firing at Sewell's Point, since
you last heard from me. They have burned a
vessel that was so close to us that we could see
tbe smoke as we stood in camp. There does
appear to be an ardent desire among tbe men
to be put into an engagement. If the men at
! the helm, (lid not use more caution than a ma
jority of the soldiers would, if tbay hid the
command, our armies would soon be out up by
the rebels. Hut it is well it is as it is. There
has been a great many rebels and rebel spies
i brought into the Fott. Oce big nigger spy,
dressed in tbe same uniform that we are, was
caught inside of our lines, but it will be some
time beford be will report to Jeff. Davis. They
are yet out on tup Hip Haps, and that is a bard
plaoe to get away froul- It id # place built
out in the Bay, (out of stone,) and is right un
der tbe guus of the Foit. It is strongly guard*
ed, besides tbe Blockading Fleet i playing
around there all the time.
As to our destination it would be hard to
tell you anything oertuia, but it is rumored
that we are to go to Santa Rosa Island in Flor
ida. This docs not seem to meet the approba
tion of all, as we might expect to be lost by
sickness, and we would much rather die at the
point of the bayonet. But it is not likely
that our Government will send us northern
men into that olimatc. The health of our
men has not been very good as moat of them
had taken bad colds in Curttn." Cap
tain Filler's Company seems to suffer most. —
We seat home dead, a young man from Dry
Ridge last week—young Hide, that never
should have been brought to this (.'amp. The
weather has been mild since wo are here, this
day is rather cold, and it is very cold at night.
Oysters ate abundant here, we can gather as
many as we want to eat. The whole oountry
is as as level as Christ. Nawgle's bottom land,
and looks just like that.
**•* . V •
It is Tuesday morning. Last was
very oold, and snow and bail fell all night.—
We are bad off' for gloves. Our Sutler is a
scoundrel*—he sells cotton gloves at forty
cents, that are not worth twenty, hi tobacco
is rottoa, and sells it for two prices. If he
does not do better we aro determined to haul
down his shanty. We get Bait meat, crackers,
coffee, sugar, potatoes, <jfcj. It is hard to get
papers here. Write aud let us hear how things
are at home. Give my respects to John Ha
fer, and all that may enquire afier me. I
have promised to write to so many, that 1 find
it is impossible to oomply with my promises.—
If you think worth while you may hand this
to Mr. Over, to publish in his paper, aud it
may seem as a letter to some who are expect
ing to bear from me. No more at present but
remain.

ed as proper ouea for discussion during the

The best motbods of conducting Teaobers'
Institutes.
Ought corporal punishment to be prohibited
iu the Common Schools, by law ?
Ought the teacher to be responsible for the
conduct of pupils on tbeir way to and from
school ?
What degree of scholarship should cutitle
the teacher to a Professional Certificate 1
Are school exhibitions, as now conducted
in this County, beneficial ?
How can a uniform and reliable standard of
professional attainment be secured throughout
tbe States ?
Docs the teacher exert a greater influence
in forming the character of his pupils tjian the
parent ?
Should the right of suffrage he granted to
persons unable to read or write ?
Should ttie parent he compelled by law to
educate bis children *
Teachers from all sections of the county are
earnestly requested to be present. As the
School Department has instructed County Su
perintendents to make it incumbent upon all
applicants for first class certificates, to attend
teachers institutes, interest alone should de
mand their presence. But duty, and the iu
torests of their profession require of them,
that they attend this important gathering of
teachers. Let this be the best Institute ever
held in Bedford county; and we know that we
have the material to make it such. Let none
remain at home.
Arrangements will be made, as heretofore,
for the entertainment of teaobers while attend
ing tbe Institute.

EAST TEIfI*ESSEE.
The whole country awaits with painful aux
ioty the receipt of further advices from tbe do
voted baud who have struck so telling a blow
for the Union in East Tennessee. Our advioes
of their victory at Morristown reach us wholly
through rebel channels, and so are certainly
not exaggerated; yet they represent the Union
triumph as unqualified. This is tbe very first
muster of Uoiou men iu a Slave State at a dis
tance from the Free States which forbids all
hope of support. East Tennessee, however,
is essentially a Free-Labor region, as much so
as Western Maryland or Norta-Western Vir
ginia. Hor citizens Lave steadily given large
majorities for the Uuiou at every election. —
They uow back their votes by their arms, and
do it right nobly. What they must have suf
fered to goad them to this desperate rising, cau
only be guessed; but that women have been
whipped and men bung there for loving the
Union, is beyond dispute.
But for that moat deplorable retreat of Gen.
Schoepf from the vioinity of Cumberland Gap,
the annihilation of Zolliooffer'a rebel army and
the freeing of East Tennessee from all vestige
of rebel domination would now bo assured,
outting off the rebels in Tennessee, Kentucky,
and Atkansas from all but tbe most circuitous
communication with those iu Virginia. As it
is, wo fear that Floyd, Zolliocffer, and "King
Harris" will rapidly conocntrate forces from
all quarters upon Kuoxville, and that this first
effective rising in the South against a mon
strous despotism will be speedily suppressed.
But it wili not be possible to kill all tbe loyal
East Tennssseans; and from every one whom
tbo traitors shall biltober teu will be madden
ed into repeating the bold enterprise of Browo
low on the very fiist promise of success.
It seems a very, very sad oase thatsuob gal
lant champions of tbe Union oauso as these
East Tennesseaos must be sacrificed for want
of support, and that, while Secretary Cameron
tells us wo have Six Hundred aud Sixty Thou
sand men enlisted to fight for the Union—a
foroo whioh is ousting at least Two Millions of
Dollars per day—wo are not yet ready to ad
vance upon the rebels somewhere, so as to off
sot the ground we have been losing in Mis
souri ever sineo Gen. Fremont was superseded.
But let our military leaders take their time.
Better staud still than advauoo to bedeteatod.
We only insist that thoy shall Dot—like their
predecessors last July—boast before a battle
of having defied popular clamor and refuse
to move till they were ready to do so with
every assurance of victory; aud thou, having
been defeated through their own gross miss
management, assert that they were pushed on
by unmilitary impatience and pressure. This
time, let them bear in mind Davy Crockett's
mixta-" Be sure you're right-then go ahead!"

PAID OFF IN THKIR OWN COIN.
During the occupation of London, Ky., by
the rebel forces under Zullicoffer, they obtain- J
ed all of their supplies from the Union UICD of j
that town, giving in return that vile stuff, con
federate bonds, payable two years after date.
They never took anything from the secesh of
the neighborhood, but encouraged them ID all
of their impositions upon tbe Unionists about
there. When, however, Zolliooffer was driv
en cut by Gen. Schoepf, and tbe Union foroos
were in need of supplies, one of tho richest
secessionists of the neighborhood—who had ,
been most active in showing Zdliooffer who of
the Union men had oorn and supplies—was ap
plied to by the General for corn, oats, aud hay
for his forces, but was answered by him that !
he would neither give, lend, nor sell anything 1
to him or bis forces. Gen. Schoepf then very i
quietly sent a detachment for the articles want- ;
ed; übtaiued from the Unionists around the
confederate bond.?, paid him a good price for
bis produce with bonds, ana gave to tbe Un
ion men tbe money of tho glorious Govern- ;
ment for whiob he is now so nobly fighting. i
SOWING TO THE WlND.— Said a Beaufort
negro ''Well, massa, you neber did see bow

such packing and tracking; load four horse

1 Hi: REBEL lIEKfKI.
! The Baltimore American thus comments on
; the removal of the rebel Capita! from Rich
mond to Nasbvillo .
This is the "beginning of the end." They
; expected, long before this time, to have taken
! Washington, marched in triumph across Mary
land to the assault of Philadelphia and New
j ork, to wind up a summer campaign, proba
bly, by dictating terms to all that was left of
a feeble foe iu Funcuil Hall. But how com
plete has been tbe failure! Beateo out of
Western \ irginia, and made to rceeda from
II .rper's Ferry and every place that bad mark
ed their sudden advance, it is evident now,
wnatever Mr. Davis may say, that they consid
| era longer stay at Richmond as a hazardous
| matter. Like another valorous and astute
i warrior, he harangues his troops to keep them
in fighting humor, but like the same infirm
j Captain he winds up by aDuouncing that "he
is a iittie lame he will start now!" At least
| this is tbe commentary his practice bears
j against bis professions.
[ Ail accounts concur in showing that tba
i movements of the Union men of East Tennes
' see, the destruction of imporU&t bridges by
j tbem, has alarmed the leaders at Richmond
■ very greatiy—we may add deservedly; but
1 none know better than Davis, that, so far from
| keepiug quiet through the winter, the Natioo
i al troops are just on the point of getting ac
| tually and earnestly in motion; and that in hie
contemplated retrograde movement to Nash
ville, he is not moving any too soon. The
i "great swelling 'words' in the Message"—the
air of confidence assumed—may servo tc
hold the troops to their positions for tho pres
em, but a good deil of the grand assumption
put forth is merely for the purpose of cover
ing his retreat, and he has but postponed, for a
little time ibis inevitable fate.
Virginia, eaten out, plundered, almost des
troyed, wiil cot, in the nature of things, hava
stomach tor much more fight; and Tennesson
and Kentucky, comparatively fresh localities,
ure to be put through the same ruinous pro
cess. Nashville is to become the temporary
headquarters for the migrating dynasty, until
a threatened advance of the National troops
will make that city too hot to hold him, until,
via Memphis or Vickihurg, he may continue
bis flight to tbe wi ds cf Arkansas or Texas,
to disappear finally, like his illustrious proto
type, Gen. William Walker, somewhere in
Central America. That, most likely, will bo
the progressive character of the drama to to
enacted within the next two or three months,
for as for that stereotyped nonseuse about "dy*
ing iD the last ditch" in deteuoe of "their soil"
being uarried out by the leaden now on the
move to Nashville, that may do, to stimulate
the "rank aud file," tut Davis, Benjamin &
Co., will never court martyrdom in that direc
tion.
A TH RILLING*"PROPHECY.
Iu last February Alabama seceded, lhat
brave man, Seuator CLEMENS, who had until
then breasted all the storms of wild fanati
cism and clung to the fug of our Union, yield*
ed to tho popular clamor, and unsheathed his
sword in a cause he hated, and one he kuew
cuuld not succeed. He wrote, the following to a
friend:
"We are ou': we have bid adieu to the
Stars and Stripes, and abandoned tbe high
privilege of calling ourselves American citi
zens. lam not ashamed to confess that I could
not restrain my tears when the old banner,
which 1 have followed through so many dan
gers, was torn down and the flag of Alabama
was raised in its pl&oe. I cannot restraiu
them now when I am writing; but the deed is
done—a new era has and all that I
can promise is that no effort shall be spared
on in? part to prevent it from becoming an era
of disgrace. If we are not involved iu a war
wc soon will be. There ts no hope of peace;
and he is but little better than a madman who
dreams of long exemption from invasion. I
shall meet it when it ocinea as'ja soldier should,
aud fight through it as long as hope remains.
Wbeu every thing is lost, as I fear it m3y be,
unless wiser counsels should prevail thau those
which have heretofore direeted us, I shall drag
my body to the nearest battle-fiaid and lay
down a life which has lost its value."
How swiftly has thi9 prediction been veri
fied. Ere th echo of his voice, pleading to
the fanatics to "stop," had diod away, tbe cry
ran out, to arms' A State then prosperous is
now bankrupt, and all the horrors of war are
upon them.
MARYLAND LEGISLATURE.
The Legislature convened at Annapolis rn
Tuesday last, pursuant to a call of Governor
HICKS. Both Houses, after their members
bad been sworn in, adjourned to ye&terday,
when, on re-assembling, they were dujy organ
ized for business.
In' the Senato HENRY 11. GODLSUOAOUEH.
of Talbot couoty, was eLeoted President, and
CHAPMAN GARWOOD, Secretary.
In the House of Delegates J, STUMER
FIELD BERRY, of Baltimore county, was cho
9en Speaker, and J. SNOWDEN THOMAS, Chief
Clerk.
Tbe Messago of Governor HICKS was laid
beforo both Houses, and is represented to be
eminently conservative and patriotic. The
Governor says he has convened the Legislature
in this special session in older tLat they may
at once, give expression to the will of the peo
ple, by taking suoh steps as will seem most ef
fective to vindicate the honor and the loyality
of the State, by undoing, and, as far as possi
ble , remedying the evils of the legislation of
their predecessors. He urges measures for the
payment of the State's portioD of the national
tax for the expenses of tho war. He says
that the rebellion must be put down, no mat
ter at what cost, and that the State must bear
her share, and hopes it w.ill be done with no
niggard hand. He urges a loan for the pur
pose, aud says it is undoubtedly a duty as it
is also due to the pride and honor of the State
that immediate provision be made for raising
and equipping Maryland's quota of volunteers
for the war. He also reecoaimends legisla
tion for the summary punishment of persoos
in Maryland who shall be convicted ot aiding
or abetting, in any manner, those who are in
arms against the Govern meat.
