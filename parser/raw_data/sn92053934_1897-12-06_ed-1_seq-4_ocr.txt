New Tork. Dec 6. A plot to black
mail Senor Don Eugenic de Faria
Telxe'ra, a Brazilian millionaire, whioh
had been frustrated by the central office
deteetlves, was revealed yesterday by
the preliminary police court proceedings
In the prosecution of William D. Turn
bull, who claims to be an accountant,
and William Elford Gould, who has
been known as a Wall street speculator.
The name of Arturo Baldasano y To
pete. Spanish consul general, having
been mentioned in connection witjj the
scheme to extort the sum of $4,500 front
Benor Telxeiia, a subpoena was Issued
for his attendance at the examination
In the case of Gould and Turnbull,
which has been set down for Tuesday.
The money was demanded from Senor
Teixeira under the threat to publish
"his life's history" and the alleged fact
that he had violently assaulted his wife
while she was In a delicate condition.
The detectives had savoral interviews
with Turnbull during the course of the
negotiations to extort the money, the
amount of which was finally reduced
to and are in possession of the
letters written to the Brazilian million
aire. Consul General Baldasano, when told
cf the arrest of Gould, seemed gTcatly
shocked. "I know Mr. Gould." he said.
"He Is an educated, courteous gentle
man and an honor to his country. I
know there must ba some serious mis
take. Mr. Gould came to me one day
several months ago and asked my opin
ion anout European art schools. I
know little about art and told him so,
but I gave him the address of Senor
Teixeira, with whom I happended to be
slightly acquainted, and who Is very
familiar with that subject. We talked
of Senor Teixeira and I mentioned the
scandalous stories which had been clr
culated about him. Why shouldn't I?
simply rave him what was common
property. I eventually gave Mr. Gould
letter of introduction to Senor Teix
eira."

Cong-rea Vat Likely to Help Them Cur
rency I-eRl.latton la I.ikewiae. ,
Washington, Dec. 6 The correspon
dent here of the New York Herald tele
graphs his paper that, regarding Cuba,
pro-rebel sentiment is strons in both
houses of congress, but tbe disposition
of many of the senators ai representa
tives to delay action, pending the trial
by Spain of the new policies of the Sa-
gasta ministry, and the influence of the
administration and cf the conservative
leaders in both houses will be able to
prevent any action. These are the con
clusions arrived at as the result of con
versation with practically all of the
senators and representatives who have
arrived In Washington.
Among the members of the house of
representatives the proportion of those
in favor of action Is rather larger than
among the senators. This Is accounted
for In a large measure by the fact that
majority of those seen are Demo
crats and Populists, who are opposed
to the policy of the administration.
However, the house Is practically pow-
less to act in opposition to the will of
the speaker ard the party leaders. The
speaker and Chairman Hilt, of the com
mittee on foreign affairs, are opposed
to action. The Republican majority of
that committee is in accord with Hitt,
and the speaker, backed up by this
committee, can hold any Cuban resolu
tions back Indefinitely.
Currency legislation Is worse off than
the Cuban rebels, for It Is a case of
one house absolutely opposed to any
measure the other is likely to adopt.
Republicans agree that there Is little or
no prospects of currency legislation
and many of them, like Cannon of Il
linois, are emphatic in the expression
cf the opinion that it would be a mis
take to attempt to pass a measure
through the house with the certainty
that it would fail in the senate. Judze
Cox. of Tennessee, the leading member
of the Democratic minority of the com
mittee on banting and currency, dous
not believe it would be possible even
to get a bill out of that committee ow
ing to the contlictirjg views held by the
members.
GRIGGS IS CKIiTAIXLY THE MAX.
Will lake M Henna's Place No Cabinet
Change Till After .Inn. 1.
Washington, Dee. 6. was officially
announced at the White House yester
day that Governor John Griggs, of New
Jersey, has been tendered and has ac-
pted the olllee of attorney general of
the United States, which will be va
cated by the nomination of Attorney
General McKenna to be associate Jus
tice of the United States supremo court.
From the best obtainable Information,
however, it appears that no change la
to be made in the composition of the
cabinet durins the remainder of the
current y :ar. There are two good rea
sons for this. Attorney General Mo
Kenna has charged himself with the
