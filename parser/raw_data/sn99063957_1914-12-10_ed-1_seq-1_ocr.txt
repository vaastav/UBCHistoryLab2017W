The men had no chance to got away,

heads the posse.
The bandits received their wounds
when the proprietor of the pharmacy,
Charles A.jax, who had been tied hand
and foot and placed in a chair, worked
0'ie arm free, and, drawing his revol

Neither man fell, but a trail of blood
extended from the store to the street.

Drawing their guns, they commanded
A.jnx to raise his hands. One of the
men then held Ajax while the other
tied him with a rope. He was then
taken to the reur of tho store, where
he could not bo observed from the
street.
Ajax himself has boon robbed sev

well burned out but there will be a
mobilization here and as soon as the
debris has cooled sufficiently it will
go right to work to reconstruct the
pant.' '
Tho fire sturtcd at 5:30 p. m. It
spread with amazing rapidity and
destroyed an entire square block of
modern reinforced concrete buildings.
Kspeciul efforts, nndor the personal
direction of Mr. Edison were made to
save the laboratory and these were sue
cessful. Ju nil ll buildings were
destroyed.
The firemen were hnmperod in their
work by the large quantities of chemi
cals stored in the larger buildiims.

The trapping of Admiral Von Slice's
