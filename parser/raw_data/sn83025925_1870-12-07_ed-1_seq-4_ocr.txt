Till TRUCK IN THE EAST.
Many persous regarded the courageous words
f 1'arl Granville's firt nlterauoes on the
Mack Sea question as bluster, believing that
England would not fight for an idea, even
though that idea involved her suprennoy in
the Indies. It is a popular belief, in this
country at least, that the nation of shop
keeper is a nation of cowards. This may or
may not be so, acoording to one's stand
point. The paramount interests of Great
Britain are of suoh a peouliar charaoter, and
the relations of the home government to
many of the territories which it rules are of
suoh a delioate and dangerous nature, that a
foreign war involves a degree of peril that
must bo averted, even at the oocavional ex
pense of national dignity. In short, England
cannot afford to fight, and if this be
eowardioe, she is the most arrant of cowards.
But, happily for her and the peace of the
world, Karl Granville has fonnd a loophole
expansive and elastic enough to suffer him
to creop through without entirely drawing in
his horns.. In the name of her Majesty's
Government and in this oase, for a rarity,
her Majesty is supposed to have had so no
thing to Bay about the business the noble
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has "no
objection to accept the invitation whioh has
been made by Russia is a conference, upon
the understanding that it assemble without
any foregone conclusion as to its result. In
anoh ease," Earl Granville continues, "her
Majesty's Government will be glad to con
aider, with perfect fairness and the respect
due to a great and friendly power, any pro.
posals which lias ii& may have to make." The
remainder of his answer to Prince Gortscha
toff a sooond note, the full text of which
reached ns yesterday, is equally conciliatory
in tone. Earl Granville tenders as a compro
mise the acknowledgment that lius-tia has
the right to "form and state an opinion" as
to her own privileges, and simply ddcnands
in return that she shall delay action in con
formity with this "opinion" until she has con
sulted the other powers. Construing Prince
Gortsohakoff's tender of a conference as
equivalent to suoh an admission, Earl Gran
ville declares the obstae'es to friendly rela
tions removed, and the preliminary contro
versy whioh at one time threatened the peace
of Europe, as far as Europe has any peace, as
pxactioally closed.
And so there is to be no appeal to the
sword at least, not until the representatives
of the great powers have talked the matter
over in Loudon. It is well that it is so; auJ,
despite the grievances whioh this country en
tertains at the hands of Groat Britain, no
true American, indeed no true man, will re
gret the prospeot of a peaceful solution of
the whole trouble. Taking into consideration
the temper and interests of the English peo
ple. Earl Granville has pullod them through
the preliminary flourish remarkably well, lie
ha ooroptlled Russia to acknowledge her
obligations to regard and consult the wishes
of the powers which were co-signatary to the
Treaty of Paris, and on the strength of this
admission he is content, and adroitly ignores
the portabilities of the future. But Russia
has gained rather than lost by this
graceful ooncession. She has at
last, after submitting for fourteen
yean to the humiliating conditions of the
treaty of 185C, bad the audacity to "form and
state her own opinion of her rights," and
Great Britain, as leader and spokesman of
the antagonistic powers, has acknowledged
her right to so "form and state" such an
pinion, on the sole condition that the course
she has taken be regarded "as an abrogation
of a theoretical prinoiple without immediate
application."' If "the Man of Sedan" were
still upon the throne of France, the "abroga
tion of a theoretical principle," even "without
immediate application," would have
been resented with as much
fnry and futility as he resented
the "check and menaee" of Prince Leopold's
candidature for the throne of Spain. Rus
sia wisely deferred to "state" the opinions
which aha doubtless formed years ago, until
the folly of Napoleon made it comparatively
safe for her to de so; and she can now
patiently and profitably await the assembling
of the conference before insisting on an
"iuaaediate application" of the "abrogation
of a theoretical principle" which has been
obnexioas to her for years. The result of
the conference is, of course, a foregone con
clusion, although Earl Granville insists that
it shall not be so considered. Russia, hav
ing startled Europe by "forming and sta
ting her own opinion of her rights," will le
affered lo enforce and enjoy them, and that
will be the end of it. ,
THE PORTER CORRESPONDENCE.
IIiktorv abounds with lamentable proofs that
heroes have often wonderfully mean elements
or wofnl mental deficiencies interwoven with
their fighting qualities. Men may win bril
liant battles by sea or by land and still be
wanlisg in the most essential elements of
tine manhood. Napoleon the First, with all
his !;rot intellectual endowments, was so
painfully deficient in moral qualities that he
scercely knew the difference between right
andnrong. Modern English critics of the
Duke of Wellington donouuee him as
a fctupid, pig-headed, narrow-minded
man, despite his success as a
soldier. The great English hero of the
last century, the Duke of Marlborongh, has
become more notorious for his avarioe than
for his victory at Hlenheiui. On of the
greatest of English naval heroes was tried,
found guilty, and ignominiously condemned
for perpetrating a gigantic fraud npon the
brokers of the London Stock Exchange. This
list of proofs that exalted intelligence, a high
sense of honor, and strict rectitude do not al
ways go hand in hand with skilled valor might
be indefinitely extended; and Vice-Admiral
Porter's correspondence has furnished evi
dence that even American heroes are not
uniformly habilitated in an iron-clad armor of
prudence, rectitude, and unselfish patriot
ism. The best defense of Portet's letter to
Welles is to be found in the fact that at the
time it was written the feeling of mutual jea
lousy between the army and navy, which bad
gradually increased with each new combined
operation of land and naval foroes, had
reached, a culminating point; but Porter,
for obvious reasons, cannot put in this
plea, and the line of defense he has
adopter of first denying all reoolleotion af
the authorship of the offensive letter, then
publishing a series of extracts of question
able appropriateness from his private diary,
and finally .acknowledging that he wrote the
ill-starred epistle, but that the whole tenor
of its contents is diametrically opposed to his
real sentiments now and at all former times
is altogether untenable. We do not oonsider
that the President should lose his faith in
human nature because an ambitious oommo
dore who toadied to Welles in the days of
his power should now toady to the dispenser
of admiralties, in spito of the harsh things
said in 1H;.". Grant ought by this time to
know that the office-seeking world swarms
with men who not only "crook
the pregnant hinges of the knee,
that thrift may follow fawning,"
but utdergo the most extraordi
nary mental, moral, and physical gyrations to
climb the ladder of ambition. lie should not
lose his faith in human nature on account of
any possible exhibition by hid train of office
seekers of high or low degree. He should be
prepared to expeot from them a succession of
the meanest and most despicable devices that
unprincipled courtiers can invent; but at
the same time he should never forget that
beyond the miasmatic oftioisl atmosphere
that immediately surrounds him an immea
surable expanse of pure patriotism and un
sullied integrity cau be found among the
great body of the American people. As to
Porter, we cn scarcely blame the President
for resolving, like Othello, "never more
be oiiicor of mine; " but no summary judg
ment should le pronouueed against 10, 000,01)1)
of citizens on aooount of any conceivable
pecoadilio of the office-holding or o.Tio
seeking fraction of this great mass of pa
triotic humanity. Practically, the Porter cor
respondence will dispose of the writer's pre
tensions to the position of Admiral of the
American Navy. It is very probable that
the office will be abolished by Congress, and
it is clearly apparent that Porter is not a
proper man to hold it.
TUB FISHERY QUESTION.
Following close npon the strong language of
the President's message concerning our Cana
dian relations, in which he declares that it
will be his duty, in case of the forfeiture of
any United States fishing vessel under the
Dominion statutes, to adopt measures for
obtaining redress and to prevent suoh out
rages in the future, comes the announce
ment that a fishing schooner seized last June
has actually been forfeited, with her stores,
cargo, etc., for violation of the treaty of
1818 and the Canadian fishery laws. Of
course, there may have been circumstanoes
that made this forfeiture justifiable, but the
probabilities are that it was made under the
Canadian construction of the treaty and
under the statutes the President com
plains f as designedly unfriendly to
the United States. This is certainly
a case that demands the attention
of our Government, and it probably affords
as good an opportunity as ever will be offered
to bring the whole fishery controversy to a
direct issne, and to secure its settlement
npon a basis that will admit of no misunder
standings in the future. Acoording to the
despatch from Toronto, published this morn
ing, the Canadian papers disouss the Presi
dent's message in a rather bellicose strain,
but as the peaceful polioy aniformly pur
sued by our Government has never impressed
onr northern neighbors with that respect
which can only be born of fear, this sort of
thing mar be looked for until both England
and Canada receive undisputed evidence that
the United States are determined to be trifled
with no longer. We have not only the fish
ery question but a number of other matters
of controversy with England and Canada,
and the present is probably as good a time
to settle all our disputes as can
be found. England is now on the verge of
a war with Russia that will demand all her
energies, and she has a well-defined fear,
founded upon the performances of the Ala
bama, that in the event of a contest the sym
pathies of the people if not of the Govern
ment of the United States will be actively
manifested ia a manner that will do more
damage to English property than will the
arms of the Russians. We commend to the
attention of our readers the editorial from
the London Saturday Review, entitled "The
Hour of Danger," whioh we publish to-day on
onr second pego; and it will readily be seen
that the situation is thought to be extremely
critical, and that the approach of the storms
a guilty connoienoe imagines to be arising
in the West as well as in the East are viewed
with anything bnt feelings of pleasure
by those who wished the destruction
of the American Union, and who aided
to bring it about by every means in their
power except open warfaro. What we have
not been able to obtain from British mag
nanimity and justice we raty possibly extort
from British fear, and it is both proper and
just that we should take advantage of the
present situation to press our claims in such
a manner that Great Britain will be obliged
to settle them satisfactorily or else repudiate
them and take the consequences.
From the tone of the President's message
we may expect him to take prompt notion in
regard to the forfeiture of the flshiuj sohooner
mentioned above, and if he does bo he should
receive the emphatic support of Cougress and
of the people.
A V.ossnois of Kank. It Is reported thatOonut
von Moltke Is not to he overlooked lu nuking 11 nil
marshals of those who have rendered great service
In this war. But his elevation to this rank Is not to
t ike place until Paris yields to his genius. There
Is difficulty to know what to do for Count von Bis
marck. Already a count, already head of Prussia,
and soon to be leader of all Germany, there remains
no further honor but lo make him a prince ; and one
of the many stonos and guesses In circulation on
thli subject in that he was to be made Prince of
A'sace; but this he would not have, because it com
