Washington Dec 7 President CIcto
landa annual message delivered to con
iresi Monday Is as follows
ro tho Congress of tho United States
As representatives of tbo people la tho
legislative branch of tbclr government you
bavb assembled at a tlmo when tho
strength and excellence of our free Insti
tutions nnd the fitness of our citizens to
enjoy popular rule have been again made
manifest A political contest Involving
momentous consequences fraught with fe
verish apprehension and creating nggres
slvcncas so Intcnsp as to approach bitter
nets and passion has been waged through
out our landand determined by the decrco
of free and Independent suffrage without
disturbance of our tranquillity or tbo least
sign ot weakness In our national struc
ture
In obedience to n constitutional require
ment I herein submit to tbc congress cer
tain Information concerning national at
tain with the suggestion of such legisla
tion ns in my Judgment Is necessary and
oxpcdlenk To Bccure brevity and avoid
tlresomo narration I shall omit many de
tails concerning matters within federal
control which though by no means unim
portant are more profitably discussed In
departmental reports I shall also further
rurtall tbls communication by omitting a
minute recital of many minor Incidents
-connected with our foreign relations
which hnvo heretofore found n placo In
executive messages but arc now contain
L In a report of tbo secretary of state
which Is herewith submitted
Hideous and Woody
At tho outset of n reference to tho moro
Important matters affecting our relations
with foreign powers It would afford mo
satisfaction If I could assure tho congress
that the disturbed condition In Asiatic
Turkey bad during the past year as
sumed n less hideous and bloody aspect
and that cither as a consequence of tbo
ajVakenlng of tho Turkish government to
the demands of humane civilization or as
the result of decisive nctlou on tfce part of
tho great nations having tho right by
treaty to Interfere for tho protection ot
those exposed to the rogo of mad bigotry
and Cruel fanaticism the shocking fea
tures of tho situation had been mitigated
Instead however of welcoming a soft
ened disposition or protcctlvo Intcrven
tlpn wo have been aCllctcd by continued
and not unfrcquent reports of tbo wanton
destruction of homes and tho bloody butch
ery ot men women nnd children mado
martyrs to their profession of Christian
faith Whllo nono of our citizens In Tur
key have thus far been killed or wounded
though often In tbo midst of dreadful
scenes of danger their safety In tbo fu
ture Is by no means assured Our govern
ment at homoand ourmlnlster at Cons tan
tlnople bavo left nothing undone to pro
tect our missionaries In Ottoman territo
ry who constitute nearly all the Individ
tula residing there who bavo a right to
claim our protection on tho score of Amer
ican citizenship
Our efforts In this direction will not be
relaxed but the best feeling ami sympa
thy that have been aroused among our
people ought not to so far blind their rea
son and Judgment as to lead them to de
mand Impossible things The outbreaks of
Wind fury which lead to murder and pil
lage In Turkey occur suddenly and with
out notice ana an attempt on our part to
force arch a hostile presence there as
might be effective for prevention or pro
tection would not only bo resisted by tbo
Ottoman government but would be re
garded ns au Interruption of thotr plans
by tho great nations who assert their ex
clusive right to Irttcrvcno In tbelr own
time and method for tho security of lifo
and property In Turkey
Pillage and Destruction
Several naval vessels are stationed In
tbo Mediterranean as a measure of cau
tion and to furnish all potralblo relief and
refuge In caso of emergency We have
xnude claims against the Turkish govern
ment for the pillage nnd destruction of
missionary property at Ilarpoot and Ma
rash during uprisings nt those places
Thus far tbo validity of these demands
lias not been admitted though our minis
ter prior to such outrages and In antici
pation ot danger demanded protection for
tho persons and property of our mission
ary citizens In tlio localities mentioned
and notwithstanding that strong evldenco
uxlsts ot actual complicity of Turkish sol
diers In the work of destruction and rob
bery tbo facts as they now appear do
not permit us to doubt the Justice of those
claims nnd nothing will bo omitted to
bring about tbclr prompt settlement
A number ot Armenian refugees having
arrived at our ports ap order has lately
been obtained from tbo Turkish govern
ment permitting the wives and children
of such refugees to Join them here It Is
iioped that hereafter 110 obstacle nlll bo
Interposed to prevent the escape of all
those who seek to avoid tbo perils which
threaten them In Turkish dominions
Our recently appointed consul to IJrzo
rum Is nt his pott discharging the du
ties of bis office though for somo unac
countable reason his formal exequatur
from the sultan has not beou Issued
I do not believe that tho present somber
prospect In Turkey will bo long permitted
to offend the sight of Christendom It so
mars the humane and enlightened civiliza
tion that belongs to the closo of the nlno
ttontb century Hint It seems hardly possi
ble that the earnest demand of good peo
ple throughout tba Christian world for Its
corrective treatment will remain unan
swered
The Cuban Insurrection
Tba Insurrection In Cuba still continues
With all Its prrplexltlea It la difficult to
percolvo that any progress has thus far
been mad toward tbo pacification of the
Island or that tbo situation of affairs as
depleted In toy last annual messago boa In
tha least Improved If Spain still holds
Havana and the seaports apd all tbo con
sldersblo towns tbo Insurgents still roam
1 at will over at least two thirds of tbo In
land country

to believe that the Insurgents Uaro gained
in point or numbers and character and
reiourcca nuu are uvuw tba Ins Indexible
might be looked for nnd tbo Immense su
periority of tho Spanish forces In numbers
discipline and equipment could hardly fall
to tell greatly to their advantage
Hut they nre called upon to face a foe
which can chooso and does chooso Its own
ground that from tbo nuture of the coun
try Is visible or Invisible at pleasure and
that fights only from ambuscadoond -when
nil tho advantages of position and num
bers are on Its side
In a country wbcro all that Is Indlspun
sablo to lite lit tho way of food clothlug
and shelter la so easily obtainable espe
cially by tlioso born and bred on tho soil
It Is obvious that tbcro Is hardly a limit
to tbo tlmo during which hostilities of
this sort may be prolonged Meanwhile
ns In all cases of protracted civil strife
tbo passions ot the combatants grow more
and moro Inflamed and excesses on both
sides becomo moro frequent and deplora
ble
They are also participated In by bands
ot marauders who now ln tho name of
one party and now In the name of tho oth
er as may be the occasion harry tbo coun
try at will nnd plunder Its wretched In
habitants for tbclr own advantage Such
a condition of things would Inevitably
entail Immense destruction of property
even If It were tbo policy df both parties
to prevent It as far ns practicable
Wholesale Annihilation
Out whllo such seemed the original pol
icy of tho government It baa now appar
ently ubandoncd It and Is acting upon tbo
eamo theory as tbo Insurgents namely
that tho exigencies of tbo contest require
the wholesale annihilation of property
that It may not prove of use and advan
tage to the enemy
ltls to the Eamecnd that In pursuance of
general orders Spanish garrisons arc now
being withdrawn from ptautatlous and
tho rural population required to concen
trate Itself In tbo towns The sure result
would seem to bo that tho industrial val
ue of the Island Is fast dfmlnlsblDg and
that unless tbcro Is a speedy and radical
change In existing conditions It will soon
disappear altogether That value consists
very largely of course In Its capacity to
produce sugar a capacity already much
reduced by tho Interruptions to tlllago
which bavo taken place during tho last
two years
It Is reliably asserted that should tbeso
Interruptions continue during tbo current
year and practically cxtelu as Is now
threatened to tho entire sugar producing
territory of tbo Island so much time and
so much money will be required to restore
the land to Its normal productiveness that
It Is oxtremcly doubtful if capital can bo
Induced to even mako tbo utteinpt
Tho spectacle of tbo utter ruin ot an ad
Joining country by nature oueof tbo most
fertllo and charming on tbo globe would
engago tbo serious attention of tho gov
ernment und people of tbo United States
In any circumstances In point of fact
they bavo a concern with It which Is by
no means of a wholly sentimental or phil
anthropic character It lies so near to ut
as to bo hardly separated from our terri
tory
Our actual pecuniary Interest In It Is
second only to that of the people and gov
ernment ot Spain It la reasonably esti
mated that at least from 130000000 to
30000000 ot American capital are In
vested In plantations and In railroads
mining and other business enterprises ou
tbo Island Tbo volumo of trade between
tbo United States and Cuba which In IShO
amounted to about 1 01000000 rose In 1803
to about 103000000 nnd In 1804 the year
before tbo present Insurrection broke out
It umounted to nearly 00000000
Vexatious and Costly
Besides tbls largo pecuniary stake In tba
fortunes of Cuba the United States dads
Itself lnoxtrlcably Involved lu tbo present
contest ln other ways both vexatious and
costly Many Cubans reside ln tbls conn
try und Indirectly promoto tbo Insurrec
tiou through the press by public meetings
by tbo purchase and shipment of arms by
tbo raising of funds and by other means
which the nature of our Institutions and
the tenor of our laws do not permit to be
made subjects ot criminal prosecutions
Borne of tbem though Cubans at heart
and in all their reelings and interests
nave taken out papers as naturalized citi
zens of the United States a proceeding
resorted to with a view to posslblo pro
tection by this government and not un
naturally regarded with much Indignation
by tho country of tbelr origin
Tho Insurgents are undoubtedly encour
aged and supported by the widespread
sympathy tho people ot this country al
ways and Instinctively feel for every
struggle for the better and freer govern
ment and which In the case of tbo moro
adventurous and restless elements of our
population leads lu xnly too many In
stances to nctlvo and personal participa
tion In the contest
The result Is that tbls government Is
constantly called upon to protect Ameri
can citizens to claim damages for Inju
ries to persona and property now estimat
ed at many millions of dollars and to ask
explanations and apologies for tbo acts of
Spanish officials wboso zeal for tho sup
pression of the rebellion sometimes blinds
them to the Immunities belonging to the
unoffending citizens of a friendly power
It follows- from tho samo causes that ibe
United States Is compelled to actively po
lice a long lino of seacoast against unlaw
ful expeditions tho escapo of which the
utmost vigilance will not always aufflco
to prevent
loiltlve Intervention
Thesc Inevitable entanglements of tba
United States with the rebellion In Cuba
tho largo American property Interests af
fected and considerations of philanthropy
and humanity In general bavo led to a
vehement demand In various quarters for
somo sort of positive Intervention on the
part of tbo United States
It waa at first proposed that belligerent
rights ahouid bo accorded to tho Insur
gents a proposition no longer urgod bo
cnuoo an untimely and Impractical opera
tion clearly perilous and lujurloua to our
own Interests It has slnco been and Is
now sometimes contended that tbo Inde
pendence of tbs Insurgents should bo rec
ognized
Dut Imperfect and restricted at tbo
Spanish government of the Island may bo
no otbor exists there unless tba wtll of
tbo military officer In temporary command
of a particular district can bo dignified as

such a government more or less Imper
fectly in the large towns and tbelr Imme
diate auburbs Hut that exception being
made the entire country la either given
over to anarchy or la subject to tho mili

It Is reported Indeed on reliable au

ot the Insurgent army
tbo putative Cuban government baa now
given up all attempt to exerclsa Its func
tions leaving that government confessed
ly what there Is tho best reason for sup

No Pitched llstlles

tbelr antagonists In tho open or In pitch

could be neither large In Its nroDortlous
nor doubtful In Its Issue Tbo correctness
of tbls forecast need be beltbor affirmed
nor denied Tho United States has ner
erthclcps a character to maintain as a na

In amity with all the world Ita own am

sible longings for territory preclude all
dreams of conquest and prevent any cast

Oar Condaot Toward Spain
That our conduct towards Spain a v her
dominions baa constituted no exception to
tbls national disposition Is mado manifest
by the coureo of our government not inly
thus far during the present Insurrection
but during tho ten years that followed Ihe
rising at Vara In 1608
No other great Dower It mar safelr bo
said under circumstance of similar per
plexity would bavo manifested tbc samo
restralut and tho samo patient endurance
It may also be said that thla persistent
Attitude of the United States toward
Spitn In connection with Cuba unques
tionably evinces no slight respect and re
gard for Spain on the part of the Amer
ican people
They In truth do not forget her connec
tion with tho discovery ot tbo weatern
hemisphere nor do ther underestimate
the great qualities of the Spanish people
nor fall to fully rccogntzo tbclr splendid
patriotism and tbclr chivalrous devotion
to tho national honor Ther view with
wonder and admiration tho cheerful reso
lution with which vast bodies of men are
sent across thousands of miles of ocean
and an enormous debt accumulated that
tbo costly possession of the Cem ot tho
Antilles may still bold Ita place In tho
Spanish crown
And yet neither tbo government nor the
pvople of tho United States have abut
tbelr eyes to tho course of events In Cu
ba nor have failed to realize the existence
of conceded grievances which bavo led to
tbc present revolt from tho authority of
Spain grievances recognized by the queen
regent ana oy toe cones voiced by too
most patriotic and enlightened of Spanish
statesmen rtltboot even regard to party
nnd demonstrated by reforms proposed by
the executive and approved by tho legis
lative branch ot tho Spanish government
It la in the assumed temper and disposi
tion of tho Spanish government to remedy
these grievances fortified by Influential
public opinion In Spain that this govern
ment has hoped to discover tho most
promising and effective means of compos
ing tbo present strife with bonor and ad
vantage to Spain and with tbo achieve
ment of all reasonable objects of the In
surrection
Gsnnlna Autonomy
It would seem that It Spain should offer
to uuna genuine autonomy borne rulo
which while preserving tbo sovereignty
ot Spain would satisfy all rational re
quirements of ber Spanish subjects there
should be no Just reason why tbo pacifica
tion of the Island might not bo effected on
that basis Such a result would appear to
bo In tbo truo Interest of all concerned
It would at unco atop tbo conflict which Is
now consuming tha resources of the Island
and making It worthless tor whichever
party may ultimately prevail It would
keep Intact tbs possessions of Spain with
out touching her honor which will bo con
sulted rather than Impugned by tbo ade
quate redress of admitted grievances
It would put the proeporityot tho Island
and tbo fortunes of Its Inhabitants within
tbelr own control without severing tho
natural and ancient ties which bind them
to the mother country and would yet en
able tbem to test tbelr capacity for self
government under the most favorable con
ditions It has been objected on the ono
aldo that Spain should not promise auton
omy until ber Insurgent subjects lay down
their arms on the other side that prom
ised autonomy however liberal U Insuffi
cient because without assurance of the
promise being fulfilled
Dut tho reasonableness of a requirement
by Spain of unconditional surrender on
the part of tbo Insurgent Cubans before
their autonomy la conceded Is not alto
gether apparent It Ignores Important
featurcsof tbo situation the stability two
years duration has given to tbo Insurrec
tion tbo feasibility of Its Indefinite pro
longation In the nature of things and as
shown by past experience the utter and
Imminent ruin of the Island unless the
present strtfo Is speedily composed above
all tho rank abuses which all parties In
Spain all branches of ber government and
all ber leading publlo men concede to ex
ist and profess a desire to remove
During such circumstances to withhold
the proffer of needed reforms until the
parties demanding them put tbomsclves at
Its mere by throwing down tbelr arms
boa the appearance of Neglecting the
gravest of perils and Inviting suspicion as
to the sincerity of any professod willing
ness to grant rerorms The objection on
behulf of tho Insnrgets that promised
reforms can not bo relied upon most ot
courso bo considered though wo have 10
right to assume and no reason for assum
ing that anything Spain undertakes to do
for tho relief of Cuba will not bo douo ac
cording to both the spirit and the letter
of tbO undertaking
Iroposltlon to Spain
Nevertheless all reallslr s that suspi
cions and precautions on the part of the
weaker of two combatants are always
natural and not always Justifiable being
sincerely desirous In the Interest of both
as well as on Its own account that the
Cuban problem should bo solved with tho
least possible delayIt waa Intimated by
this government to tho government of
Spain some months ego It a satisfactory
measure of homo rulo were tendored tho
Cuban Insurgents and would bo accepted
by them upou a guaranty ot Its execution
tho United Btates would endeavor to find
a way not objectlonablo to Spain ot fur
nishing such guaranty
Whllo no deflnlto response to this Inti
mation has yet been received from tbo
Spanish government It Is believed to bo
not nl logo ther unwelcome while aa al
ready suggested no reason Is perceived
wby It should not be approved by the In
surgents Neither party can fall to seo
the Importanco of coly action and both
must realize that to prolong tbo present
state of things for even a short period
will add enormously to the tlmo and labor
oud expenditure necessary to bring about
tho Industrial recuperation of tbo island
It Is therefore fervently hoped on all
grounds that earnest efforts for healing
the breach between Spain and the Insur
gents upon tho lines nbovo Indicated
may bo ot once Inaugurated and pushed to
an Imiucdlato and successful Issue Tho
frlcnd ofUcea ot tbo United Btatoscltbor
In tbemanner abovo outlined or In any
other vi ay consistent with our constitu
tion nud our laws will always bo at the
disposal of cither party
Whatever circumstances may arise our
policy and our Interests would constrain
us to object to tbo acquisition of tbo Isl
and or as Interference with Its control by
any other power
Our 1atlaae Hay Bo Exhausted
It should bo added that It cannot be ren

Tho Immigration
The number ot Immigrants arriving In
the United States during tha fiscal year
was 11 1217 of whom 3 to 468 were permitted
to land and 2799 were debarred on various
grounds prescribed by law and returned
to the countries whenpe they camo at the
expenso of the steamship companies by
which they wero brought In The Increase
In Immigration over the preceding year
amounted to 64731
There arrived from Japan during the

opinion of tho Immigration authorities
that tbo apprehension heretofore existing
to somo extent of a large Immigration
from Japan to the United Btate1 Is with
out any substantial foundation

The TarlS
I desire to recur to the statements elss
where mado concerning the governments
receipts and expenditures for the purpose
of venturing upon some sugsresllotui
touching our present tariff law and Its op
eration
Thla atatuto took affect on the Mth day
of August 18l Whatever so may be Hi
shortcomings as a complete measure of
tariff or tariff reform It must be conced
ed It has opened the way to a freer nnd
greater exchango of commodtties between
us and other countries and thus furnish
ed a wider market for our products and
manufactures The only entire fiscal year
during which this law has been In force
ended on the 34th day ot Juno 1396 In that
year our Imports Increased over those of
tho previous year more than 91580000
while the value or tho domeatlo produols
we expected and which found markets
abroad was nearly 170000000 more than
during the preceding ycr
I bellavo our present tariff law U al
lowed a fair opportunity will In tha near
future yield a rovenuo which with rea
sonably economical expenditures will
overcome all deficiencies In the mean
time the deficit that has occurred cr
may occur need not exolto or disturb us
Deficit and Sorpliu
To meet any such deficit we have let the
treasury in addition to a gold reserve si
one hundred millions a surplus of more
than one hundred and twonty eltbt call
lions 1 ot dollars applicable to Ota payment
of the expenses of the government and
which must unless expended for that
purpose remain a useless hoard or U not
extravagantly used must In any event
bo perverted from the purp w of Its ex
action from the people Tne payment
therefore of any deficiency in tha revenue
from this fund Is nothing more than Its
proper and logltlmato use
Political Economy
An Individual living beyond his Income
and embarrassing himself with Abt or
drawing upon his accumulated fund ot
principal Is cither unfortunate or Im
provident The distinction Is between a
government charged with the duty of ex
pending for tho benefit of the people and
iur proper purposes au mo money u re
ceives from any source and the Individual
who la expoctod to manifest a natural de
sire to nvold debt or to accumulate as
much os pooslblo and to Hve wlthletha
Income derived from suoh aceUmuiaUOos
to tho end that they may be Increased or
at least remain unimpaired for the future
use and enjoyment of blroself or the ob
jects of his love and affection who may
survive hlro
Oar Financial Methods
This reference to the condition and pros
pects of our revenuea naturally aaggeat
an allusion to tho weakneea Bod vices of
our llnanclal methods Tbty havo been
frequently pressed upon the attention of
congress in previous executive communi
cations and the Inevltabto danger of Uielf
continued toleration pointed out Without
now repeating these details t cannot re
frain from again earnestly preaeoUns the
necessity of the prompt reform cf si sys
tem opposed to every rule of sound Baance
and shown by experience to be fraueut
with tbo greatest peril and perplex ttsr TJi
terrible civil war which shook tbo foun
dations of our government mors laim
thirty years ago brought hi Ita train thv
destruction of propertythp waatlacr ot our
countrys substance and the eetraageeaewt
of brethren Theso are now past and for
gotten Even the distressing loesj of life
ihe conflict entailed Is but a saoreA mem
ory which fosters patriotic sentiment and

nobly died And yet there remain wttli
us today In full strength and activity

The Gold Standard
Ilecause we may bo enjoying a tempor
ary relief from Ita depressing Influence
this ahouid not lull va Into a false se
curity nor lead us to forego the auddan
ness of paal visitations I am more con
vinced than ever that we can haVe no as
sured financial peace and safety until thn
government currency obligations upc
which gold may bo demanded from 11
treasury are withdrawn from clrculati
nnd cancelled This might be done

their exchange for long term bonds tx

demotion with the proceeds 0 sn
bonds
Issue of Muds
Bvcn If only the United State
known aa thus retired
Is probable that thn treasury notes lasuU
In payment of silver purchases under tli
act of July 14 1890 now paid In gold whin
demanded would not creato such disturb
ance as they might from time to tiro
when received In tho treasury by redemp
tion ln gold or othsrwlae be gradually
and prudently replaced by silver cola Tbls
plan of Issuing bonda for the purpose of
redemption certainly appears to be the
most effective and dlreot path to the seed
cd reform In default ot this however It
would be a step In tho light direction if
currency obligations redeemable In gold
whenever so redeemed should bo can
cellod Instead of bolnrr ro liaued This
operation would be a slow remedy but l
would Improve present conditions
National banks should redeem their own
notes They should be allowed to Issue
circulation to the par valua of the bonds
deposited as security for Its redemption
and tho tax on their circulation should
be reduced to ono tourth of 1 per cent
Retiring United States UenO -
In considering projects for the retire
ment of U H notes and treasury note
issued under the taw of 1890 I am of the
opinion that we havo placed too muoh
stress upon the danger ot contracting tte
currency and havo calculated too Tittle
upon tho gold that would be added to our
circulation If Invited to us by better and
safer financial methods It Is not so much
a contraction ot our currency that atinuld
bo avoided aa lu unequal distribution
This might be obviated and any fear of
harmful contraction at tho same ilia re
moved by allowing the organisation of
smaller banks and In leas populous com
munities than aro now permitted and
also authorizing oxlstlng Lanks to estab
lish branches In small communities under
proper restrictions
Traits and Combines
Another toplo In which our people right
fully take a deep Interest may Do bore
briefly considered I refer to the exist
enco of trusts and other hugo aggrega
tions of capital tho objeot ot whlcbi Is to
eecuro the monopoly 0 soma particular
branch of trade Industry or commerce
and to stltlo wholesome competition
When theso aro defended It 14 Usually on
tho ground that though they inoreasd
profits they also roducJ price and thin
benefit the public It must bo remem
bered however that a reduction of priced
to the people Is not one of the real objects
ot those organ zatlons nor Is their tend
ency noceesarlly in that esreotloti If It
occurs In a particular case a is only W
rauso It acoords with tho purposes or In
terests cf those manaslna tbo cchomtis
When however It Ta considered that
thoso who bear tno burdens of taxation
have no guaranty of honest care save In
the fldollty of their oubUo servants the
duty ot all possible retrenchment U
plainly manifest
When our differences are forgotten and
put contrasts of political opinion are no
longer remembered nothing In tho retro
