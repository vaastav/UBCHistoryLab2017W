surplus as* stated, were made by
calling in for that purpose out

feared the withdrawal of this great suin of

the business of the country, that $79,804,

were then payable at the option of tbe gov

applied to the sinking-fund contribution for
the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding
these operations of the treasury department,
representations of distress in business cir
cles not only continued but increased, and
abiiolute peril seemed at hand. In these cir
cumstances the contribution to the sinking
fund for the current'fiscol year was at once
completed by the expenditure of $27,684,

and apprehension since your last sojourn

PERIL TO THE COUN TUT,
it is but a result growing ont of a per
fectly palpable and apparent cause, con
stantly reproducing tbe same alarming cir
cumstances—a congested national treasury
and a depleted monetary condition in the
business of the country. It need hardly be
stated that while the present situation de
mands a remedy, we can only be saved from
alike predicament in the tuture by the re
moval of ite cause. Our scheme of taxation,
by means of which this needless surplus is
tukeu from the people and put into the pub
lic treasury, consists of a tariff or duty levied
upon importations from abroad and internal
revenue taxes levied upon the consumption
of tobacco and spirituous and malt iiqnora
It must be- conceded that none of the things
subjectedwo internal revenue taxation are,
strictly speaking, necessary. There appears
to be no just complaint of this taxation by
the consumers of these articles, and there
seems to be nothing so well able to bear the
burden without hardship to any portion of
the people. But our present tariff laws, the
vicious, inequitable, and illogical source of
unuecexBary taxation, ought to be at once
revised and. amended These laws, as their
primary and plain effeot, raise the price to
consumers of all articles imported and sub
ject to duty,- by precisely the sum paid for
such duties. Thus the amount of the duty
measures the tax paid by thOBe who purchase
for use these imported articles. Mauy of
these things, however, areraised or nviuu
factured in our country, and the duties now
levied upon foreign goods and products are
called production to these home manufact
ures. because they render it possible for
those of our people who are manufacturers
to make these taxed artioles and sell them
for a price equal to that demanded for tbe
imported goods that have, paid customs duty.
So it happens that while comparatively a few
use the, imported articles, millions of our
people, who never use and nevertiaaw any of
the imported products, purchase and use
things of tbe same kind made in this country
and pay therefor nearly or quite the same
charged price which the duty adds to tbe
imported articles. Those who buy imports
pay tbe duty charged thereon into the pub
lic treasury, but the great majority of our
citizens who bUy doHjfestio articles of the
earue ciaos pay a sum at least approximately
equal to this duty to the home manufact
urer. Thisrefereuoe to the operation of onr
tariff laws is not. made by way of instruC
Uon, but in order that we may be constantly
reminded of tbe manner'in much they

upon those who consume domestlo products
as well as those who consume imported
articles, and thus create a tax upon all our
people. It is hot proposed to entirely re
lieve the country of this taxation. It must
be extensively continued as the source of
the government'* income and in a readjust
ment of our tariff the interests of American
labor engaged in manufacture should be
carefully considered, as well as the preserva
tion of onr manufacturers.. It may be called
protection, or by any other name, but relief
from the hardships and dangers of onr pres
ent tariff laws should be devised with espe
cial precaution against imperiling the exist
ence of our manufacturing intereeta But
this existence should not mean a condition
which, without regard to the public welfare
or a national exigency, must always insnre
increase, new recruits ar« added to those
who desire a continuation of the. advantages
which they conceive' tue present system of
tariff taxation directly affords them. Ho
stubbornly have all efforts to reform the
present condition been resisted by those of
our feilow citizens ihns engaged, that they
can hardly, coiupialn of the suspicion, enter
tained to a certain: extent, that there exists
an organized combination all along the
line to maintain thelr advantage. We are in
the midst of centennial celebrations, and
with becoming pride we rejoice in American
skill .and Ingenuity, in American energy
and enterprise, and in the wonderful
natural!
advantages and resources developed
by a century's national growth. Yet when
an. attempt is made to jnsiifv a scheme
which.permlts a .x to be laid" upon everv
consumer in the land for the benefit of our
manufacturers, 'quite beyond a reasonable
demand for governmental repm-.l, it suits
the purposes of advocacy to call our manu
factures infant industries, still neeuiog the
highest and greatest degree of favor and
fostering care that can be wrung from
federal legislation. It is also said that the
increase in tbe price of domestic manufact
ure-resulting from the present tariff is nec

ot raxes"
more than sufficient to sweep away all the
tariff profit he reoa^ved upon the wool he
produced and sold. When the ^number of
farmer* engaged in wool raising is Compared
with all the farmer* in tbe country, and the
email proportion they bear to our nopula
tion is considered when lp J* msde apparent
tnat, in the. case of a large part of those who
own sheep, tbe benefit of the present tariff
on wool is illusory, and, above all, when it
must be .conceded that the Increase of.
-the' cost of living caused by such
tariff becomes a burden" "upon those
with moderate means and-'the poor, the
employed ana 'unemployed, the sick and
well, and the young and old, and that it con
stitutes a tax which, with relentless grasp.
Is fastened upon the clothing' of every man,
woman and child in the land, reasons are
•"guested why the removal or redaction of
this dnty should be included iu a revision of
our tariff lawk In speaking of the increased
cost to the consumer pf our home manufact
ures, resulting from a duty laid upon im
ported artioles of the same' description, the
fact is not overlooked that competition
among our domestic prpducers sometimes
has the effect 6f keeping the price of their
products beloVy the highest limit allowed by
suph dubr. But it is notorious that this com
petition Is too often strangled by-combina
tions-quite prevalent at this time, and fre
quently called trust*, which, have for their
object tbe regulatlon'ot tbe
supply.and price
of commodities made and sold by members
of tbe combination. The people-can barely
hope for any consideration in the operation
of these aelfish scheme* If, however,, in
the absence of snch combinations, a healthy
and free competition reduces the price of
any particular dutiable article of home pro
duction, below the limit which It might oth
erwise reach under onr tariff laws, and if,
with such reduced price, its manufacture
continue to thrive, it Is entirely evident
that one thing has been discovered which
should be carefully scrutinized in an effort
to reduce taxation. The necessity of com
bination to maintain the prioe of :any com
modity to the tariff point furnishes proof
that some one is willing to accept lower
prices for such commodity, and -that *uch
prices are remunerative and lower prices
produced -b.v competition prove ibe same
ihlng. Thus where either, of thosj condi
tions exisc a ca?e would seem to bo pre
sented for an easy reduction of taxation. The
considersUoiui which haVe been presented
touching onr tariff Ukws are'intended only to
enforoe an earnest.recommendation that the
surplus revenue
ot
IwiilrtSii' piiesc
ills liO'fiist
upon vHUoh adds to the coat of living in
every boiae, should be gieitly ehesio'ned.
The radtoAl reduction of the duties imposed
upon raw material usedjji manufactures^ or
it* free.importation,is,of Ktuse,an tin.
portant factor in any effort to reduoe the
prioe of these necessaries it Would not only
relieve them from the Increased cost caused
by the tariff on such material, but the man
ufactured product being thus cheapened tbat
putt of the tariff now laid upon such produot
as compensation to our manufacturers for
the present price ot raw material' could
be accordingly modified. Suoh reduc
tion. or free importation, would serve
beside to largely reduee the revenue. It is
not apparent how auch a change can have
any injurious effeot upon our manufacturers.
On the contrary it would appear to give them
abetter chance in foreign market* with the
manufacturers of other countries, who
cheapen their ware with free material. Thus
our people might have the opportunity of
extending their sales beyond boinc- con
sumption, Saving them from the depression,
interruption in business, and loss osaied bv
glutted domestlo market, and affording their
employes more certain and steady labor,
with its resulting qniet -and contentment.
The question thus imperatively-presented
for solution should be approaobed in a
spirit higher than partisanship, and consid
ered in tho light of that regard for patriotic
duty whioh should characterize the'action
of those intrusted with the weal of a confid
ing people. Bnt the obligation to deolared
-party policy and,principle is not wanting to
urge prompt and effective action. Both of
the great political parties, now represented
in the government have, by repeated and
authoritative declarations, condemned
the condition «f laws which permit
the collection from the people of nn
necesssry revenue, and have, in the most
solemn manner promised it* correction and
neither as citisens nor partisans are our
countrymen in a mood to condone the de
liberate violation of these pledges Our
rogress toward a wise conclusion will not
improved by dwelling npon the theories
of protection and -free trade. This savor*
too much of bandying epitheta It is a con
dition which confronts us, not a theory.
Belief from this '.condition may involve a
slight reduction ofthe advantages which we
award our home production*, but the entire
withdrawal of Suoh advantagea should not
be contemplated.

Washington, Special Tel^aii
The president's message fell a listtcflat in

all other matters. It furnished no new
point* and made no suggestions to congress,
that would be followed. Straddling and
vacillating between protection and tree
trade, it pleased no ofie completely. After
having a half-dozen experts a^ work during

the latest sources, he supplies congress with

Throughout it is a reply to a protection

becauso no plan of action was suggested.
Tbe Republicans criticised the message
freely. Hold a Virginia Bepubllcan:

With that document in tbe land iu the la-t cam

Congressman drosvenor of Ohio'said:
I think oar wool men will believe me now. I
told them a good while age: "You have been
fooling with this wool tariff business for some
time. You have been trying to control lt iu
Ohio by electing a Republican hero and a Demo

hi* Inaugural ho gave as the war cry of hit
administration the words "Antagonize 'em,*
and up to that motto he has religiously
lived.
Mr. Hannafln 1* ot Irish birth and par.
entage, but oame to this country in 1846,
being then fifteen years of age, Tbe family
settled in Buffalo, N. Y., where the father
shortly after died. Young Hannafln went to
Gbioago in 1850, and entered the service of
the Illinois Central railroad, remaining in
the employ of that corporation for nine
years The outbreak of the war found him
In Memphis, but he hastened home
agd was soon commissioned lieutenant
by Gov.- Yates and proceeded to raise
a Company afterward known as Company F,
Seventy-fifth Illinois volunteers. From that
time till the close of the war Lieut. Hanna
iin served in the Army of tbe Cumberland,
participating in the battles of PerryviUe,
Stone fllver. Lookout Mountain, and the
various engagements for.wlitoh that army
waR famous. He oame to Dakota in 1866,
before Wyoming was cut off from this terri
tory, and was engaged on the Union Pacific
railway. In 1872 he struck the Northern
Puclfio at Brainerd, and shortly after went
to Bismarck, where he has sinoe resided.
In the early and troublesome times on the
frontier Denny Hannafln was a prominent
figure. His hair-breath escapes would ll a
volume and included set-tos with radians,
highway robbers, gamblers, blacklegs of
various kinds, and even included disputes
with blueooats who happened to get a little
too fresh or presume too much on. their
authority. If Hannafin ever came out
second best in auyof hi* troubles the fact is
not remembered by the oldest inhabitant
Gov. Hannafln is a consistent Democrat,
and what is stranger, is a Prohibitionist
When Hancock was nominated Hannafin
went to New York to see him. He told tbe
adjutant general how far he had traveled,
and the latter secured him a private Inter
view. Mr. Hannafin'* advice to Gen. Han
cook has been the theme of a good many
writers, but in nearly every case what -he
said was distorted or exaggerated. He did
not tell the general to "stand pat" as ha*
been so often reported, or any nonsense of
.that kind. What, he said was this: "Gen
eral. yon have been nominated on your
name and record. The men who live in the
territories are natural politicians if they
weren't they couldn't live there. Now what
I say to you is. don't write one d-^— letter on
the tariff or finance, and keep away from
New York."
If Hancock had'observed this advice he
would have come much nearer success than
he did. As it was. he thanked Mr. Hannafin,
and said he hoped to have the pleasure of,
meeting him again when he could stand'
more courtisies than he could at that ttmei'S
^Well." replied Hannafin,. "you can rest',
pretty sure you'll see me again—if you are
elected." Hannafin's faith in the outcome
was great, and the defeat of Hancock cost
bint iu various wars about $20,000.
As remarked at the outset, Mr. HanUafin
Ik a gredt nntngonizer. When Church ar

governor ho was introduced to Dennla
Being called upon by some one as an old
resident and ajpllow Damoerac to make a
few suggestion to the governor, Dennis
embodied bis ideas in a very few words, as
follows: "Dakota is divided into four sec
tions—North Dakota, South Dakota, the Bed
Biver valley and the Black Hilia What
you want.to do is to antagonize every
one of'em and ail at once."
Speaking of this plan, Mr. Hannafin says
that after enreful observation for many
years he ha* found that "civility is a failure
—always a failure-with the leaders. No,
sir! step on their toes. If they don't like it
let 'em take 'em out of the way."
It in scarcely necessary to
eay that Mr. Han
nafin is. a well known figure around Bis
marck and is about the first individual
pointed out to the visitor looking up tbe
sights. *7*,.

stored in tanks fitted under seats::
The car spins along at a very lively
rate, if permitted, and ia under per
fect control. It isstopped in less time'
than horses can be checked, and starts
with a gentle facility, and gains speed:
as if motion was, its natural condi
tion and the rests were enforced. The
one that I saw on Fourth avenue was
gliding ahead, pursued and in fiajrt'
surrounded by a great swarm of boys,
who seemed to be of the impres
sion that they were witnessing
show of magic. The street car
horses did not like the moastfr. and
pranced as if they proposed una"
