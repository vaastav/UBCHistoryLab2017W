ent session of the congress.
. I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necesHarily act at
this session and shall make my sug-
gestlons as few as possible; but there
were some things left undone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which It seems
necessary In the Interest of the public
to do at once.
1 In the first place, It seems to me Im
peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action
ahould be accorded the remaining
measures of the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had occa
sion to recommend to you at the close
of your last session In view of the pub
lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom
modated difficulties which then existed,
and which still unhappily continue to
exist, between the railroads of tha
country and their locomotive engineers,
conductors, and trainmen.
Railway Troubles First
I then recommended :
First, Immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the Interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied

IF EMERSON LIVED TODAY
I F Emerson lived today he could sit In his study at Concord and realize his wish to
have music on his own terms whenever the spirit moved him.
One cannot Imagine Emerson sitting in his study listening to a talking machine,
but one can readily believe that Emerson would have listened with delight to Edison's
new invention, which the New York Globe refers to as "the phonograph with a soul."

hands of the executive of the power,
In case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll'

use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft Into

States such train crews and adminis

require for their safe and efficient use.
Renews His Recommendations.
i The second and third of these rec
ommendations the congress Immediate
ly acted on: It established the eight-
hour day as the legal basis of work
and wages In train service and It an
tborlzed the appointment of a com
mission to observe and report upon the
practical results, deeming these the
measures most Immediately needed;
bnt K postponed action upon the other
suggestions until an opportunity should
be offered for a more deliberate con
sideration of them. The fourth reo
ommendutlon I do not deem It neces
sary to renew. The power of the In
terstate commerce commission 'to grant
an Increase of rates on the ground re
ferred to Is Indisputably clear and a
recommendation by the congress with
regard tp such a matter might seem to
draw In question the scope of the com
mission's authority or Its Inclination to
do J unties when there Is no reason 4
doubt either.
The other suggestions the Increase
SB the Interstate commerce commla-
at Issue plain for the' judgment of tha
opinion Of the nation is not to propose
any snch principle. It Is based upon
the verv different nrlnnlnla that tha
certed action of powerful bodies of men I
shall not be permitted to stop the In
dustrial processes of the nation, at any
rate before the nation ahall have had
an opportunity to acquaint Itself with
the merits of the case as between em
ployee and employer, time to form Us
opinion upon an Impartial statement
of the merits, and opportunity to con
sider all practicable meana of concilia
tion or arbitration.
I can see nothing In that proposition
bnt the justifiable safeguarding by so
ciety of the necessary processes of
Its very life. There Is nothing arbi
trary or unjust In It unless It be arbi
trarily and unjustly done. It can and
should be done with a full and scrupu
lous regard for the Interests and liber
ties of all concerned as well as for the
permanent Interests of society Itself.
Other Legislation Urged.
Three matters of capital Importance
await the action of the senate which
have already been acted upon by the
bouse of representatives: the bill
which seeks to extend greater freedom
of combination to those engaged In pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than Is now thought by some
to be legal under the terms of the laws
against monopoly; the bill amending
the present organic law of Porto Rico;
and the bill proposing a more thor
ough and systematic regulation of tha
expenditure of money In elections, com
monly called the Corrupt Practices Act
I need not labor my advice that these
meusures be enacted Into law. Their
urgency Ilea' In the manifest circum
stances which render their adoption at
this time not only opportune but neces
sary. Even delay would seriously
jeopard the lntereats of the country
and of the government
Immediate passage of the bill to reg
ulate the expenditure of money In elec
tions may seem to be lesa necessary
than the Immediate enactment of tha
other measures to which I refer; be
cause at least two years will elapse
before another election In which fed
eral offices are to be filled ; but It would
greatly relieve the public mind If this
Important matter were dealt with
while the circumstances and the dan
gers to the public morala of the pres
ent method of obtaining and spending
campaign funds stand clear under re
cent observation and the methods of
expenditure can be frankly studied In
the light of present experience ; and a
delay would have the further very se
rious disadvantage of postponing ac
tion until another election waa at hand
and some special object connected witfi
It might be thought to be In the mind
of those who urged It Action can ba
taken now with facts for guidance and
without suspicion of partisan purpose.
I shall not argue at length the desir
ability of giving a freer hand In the
matter of combined and concerted ef
fort to those who ahall undertake the
essential enterprise of building up our
export trade. That enterprise will

FUIMMILS
FARM CREDITS
Discussion of Principles That Should
Govern In Extending Credits ,
Under the Act.
(By Associated Pinn.y
Chicago, Dec. 5. "Fundamental
Principles That Should Apply in
Farm Credits" was the subject dis
cussed here today by Robert D. Kent,
a banker of Passlac, N. J., before the
National Conference on Markelng and
Farm Credits.
Mr. Kent basing his remarks on the
principle that "prosperity, safety and
happiness of men result from that of
society in general, and that aoclety'a
strength and safety come from the
fidelity and labor of Individuals,"
spoke in part as follows:
"In addition to raising crops for
food, clothing and shelter, It la im
portant that men be given employ
ment to earn a livelihood. The prob
lem Is for society to furnish farms to
capable and willing workers who, in
turn, will furnish products of the soil
to the community.
"It Is of prime Importance that the
Individual who la to be aaslsted
should bear the brunt of the burden.
If he Is relieved of his obligation to
he thoughtful, industrious and thrifty
his manliness will be undermined.
The state, however, ahould make It as
easy as possible for the borrower by
arranging systems of co-operation
among the borrowers themselves. It
is of public benefit that the landless
men' should be connected with tha
'manless land,' and therefore the gov
ernment la justified In furnishing as
sistance, but it ahould be done in such
a way that "misfits' should not occur
and that underwritlngs should not en
tail any long or aevere charge on so
ciety.
"I would auggest the following
plan: Let the township, county or
state own the land and the atock on
the farm and let them enter Into a
contract with those that desire to go
on the farms. Earnings of the farms
should to a large extent be applied
to reducing the debts incurred, and
the government, In such caaes, should
appoint supervisors over, say, ten or
fifteen farma for the first year's oc
cupancy, but put no more expenses
on the farm than necessary In order
that the taxpayers' money may not be
jeopardized. Until the working of the
farma returns enough money to make
a substantial reduction of the Indebt
edness the supervisors should have
full power of direction. Then the title
to the farm could be veated In the
occupant and a mortgage would se
cure the balance due. If it be found
that the farmer cannot 'make good,'

'The Phonograph with a Sottl.'
THIS new Invention marks the achieve
ment by Thomas A. Edison of his am
bition to produce an Instrument which
would Ro-creato all forms of music so per
fectly that the Rc-crcatlon rould not be de
tected from the living artist's voice or In
strumental performance.
Great artists have appeared In public
and have sung or played In direct compari
son with Edlson'a Ro Creation of their work.
More than 200.000 music lovers and the
music critics of more than 200 of America's
leading newspapers have heard and seen these
astounding tests, and one and all ronredo
without reservation that the New Edlson'a
Re Creatlon of an artist's work positively can
not be dotocted from the artists actual performance.
Will there be Real Music in
your home at Christmas?
A TALKING marhlno cannot give you real
music. It gives you only a hollow Imi
tation. Tha New Edison la not a talking machine.
Tha New York Tribune says of It that "Edi
son baa snared tho aoul of music.''
It will bring Into your home at Christmas
and every other day of tha year tha literally
Re-created art of tho world's greatest artists.
We want you to hear this wonderful hew
Invention In our store at your earliest oppor
tunity. Tbora la no obligation to buy. Wo merely
want you to hear "the phonograph with a

very earnestly renew. i
The necessity for such legislation la '
manifest and pressing. Those who have
intrusted na with the responsibility
and duty of serving and aafeguardlng
them In auch matters would find It
bard, I believe, to excuse a failure to
act upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of action
upon them.
Not only does the Interstate com
merce commission now find it practi
cally Impossible, with Its present mem
bership and organization, to perform
Ita great functions promptly and thor
oughly, but It la not unlikely that It
may presently be found advisable to
add to ita duties still others equally
heavy and exacting. It must first be
perfected as an administrative instru
ment The country cannot and ahould not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound Industrial disturbances for
lack of additional means of arbitra
tion and conciliation which the con
gress can easily and promptly supply.
And all will agrea that there nius. be
no doubt aa to the power of the execu
tive to make Immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military forces of tha

thing must be dona now, because the
opportunity la here and may escape as
if we hesitate or delay.
Porto Rico's Needa.
Tho argument for the proposed
amendments of tha organic law of Por
to IUco la brief and conclusive. Tha
present laws governing tha Island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
Its people are not Just We have cre
ated expectations of extended privi
lege which we have not satisfied.
There la uneasiness among the people
of the Island and even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our Intentions
concerning them which the adoption of
the pending measure would happily re
move. We do not doubt what wa wish
to do In any essential particular. We
ought to do It at once.
. There are other matters already ad
vanced to the atage of conference be
tween the two houses of which It Is
not necessary that I ahould speak.
Borne practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be found
and action taken upon them.
