HL fThta a ta7 day in Washington. Th
Hr Congressional session commence!, the
H&' President's Messogo ii siren to the pnblio,
HL- the Department report ore to be resd, con.
HK' gratalsAlons are to be exchanged by Ilepub-

Hp' aaoiher by Democrats, and things are certain
H' to be lively generally.
K, The readers of The Etkxo Would will

H peruse the President's Message in this city.
Ef, Theyvrill find that Mr. Clxtxxahd stands
LHf firmly by the Democratic prlnolple of Tax
K- Bednetlon and Tariff Reform, and uses
HE strong arguments in faror of the Uiue
Hr on which the recent election was fought.
mh TT w111 o10 Sod that he U distinct
K, Ss his utterances against monopolies. If he
Hr bad commenced his Tariff and Tax agitation
H& four years ago it would have been hotter for
Kk hlui, and if the Democratlo Representatives
E in the House had manifested a disposition to
R?C legislate against Trusts it would turn) been
HL better for their party.
HHi' The annual reports mate a good showing
Hg for the departments, eapeolslly the report of
K Secretary Wnmntx, which proves how much
Ht, honesty and capacity hate done in four
r years towards redoeming the eharaoterjof our

"THE PEOPLE'S CAUSE,"
Oonttmud from first page.
Is so apparent as to bs generally conoeded. Dnt
the means by which this end shall be accom
plished and the snm of direct benefit which shall
result to our dtlzons present a controversy of
the utmost importance. There should bo no
scheme accepted is satisfactory by which tho
burdens of tho people aroonly apparently re
moved. Extravagant appropriations of pnblio
money,wthalithcirdemorallzinir consequences,
should not bn tolerated, cither as a means of re
lleving the Treasury of Its present surplus or
as furnfihlntr pretext for rcsintlnit a proper
redaction In tafirT rates. Existing otIIs ancllii.
Justlco shonld be honestly rcroKtilzcil, holtlly
mot and effectively remedied. There should Ira
no cessation of tlio BtrtiHBlo until a plan, In jwr
fectcd, fair and consetTatlTO towards existing
Industries, but which will rednco the cost to con
sumers of the necessaries of life, while it pro
vides for our manufacturers tho advantage of
freer raw material andpermlU no injury to tho
interests of American labor.
IT IS TUE FKOFl,a'H CAtMK.
The cause for which the battlo Is waged la
comprised within lines clearly and distinctly de
fined. It should never bo compromised. It is
tho people's cause.
It cannot bo (tailed that the selfish, and pri
vate interests which aro so persistently heard,
when efforts are made to deal In a lust and com
prehensive manner with onr tariff laws, nro
related to, If they aro not responsible for, tho
Mntlment largelyprcvalllng among the people,
that tho General umemniout is tho fountain of
individual and privato aid; that it may be
expected to relievo with patornal oaro tho
distress of citizens and communities, and that
from the fulness of its Treasury it should, upon
the slightest possiblo pretext of promoting tho
general good, apply publio funds to the benefit
of localities and Individuals. Nor can it bo de
nied that there Is a growing assumption that, as
against the Government and in favor of privato
claims and interests, the usual rules amUimita
tlons of business principles and Just dealing
shonld be waived.
These idoas have been unhappily mnch en
couraged by lcglslatlvo acquiescence, ltcllef
from contracts made with tho Government Is
too easily accordod in favor of the citizen ; the
failure to support claims against the Govern
ment by proof, la often supplied b no bettor
consideration than tho wealth of tho Gov
ernment and the poverty of tho claim
ant; gratuities In tho form of pensions aro
granted upon no other real ground than tho
Iieody condition of the applicant, or for reasons
ess valid: and largo sums aro expended for
publio buildings and other improvements upon
representations scarcely claimed to bo related to
pnhllo needs and necessities.
The extent to which tho consideration of such
matters subordinate and poatpono action upon
subjects of great publio importance, but involv
ing no special, private or partisan interest,
should arrest attention and lead to reforma
tion. Haiti's sxizuax or AMERICAN VERflEIA
I announce with sincere regret that Ilayti has
again become tho theatre of insurrection, dis
order and bloodshed. Tho titular Government
of President Baloman has been forcibly over
thrown and ho driven out of tho country to
France, where bo has slnco died.
Tho tenure of power lias boon so unstablo
amid the war of faotlons that has ensned siuco
tho expulsion of President Baloman that no
Government constituted by tho will of the Hay
tlcn people has been recognized as administer
ing responsibly the affairs of that country. Onr
representative has been instructed to abstain
from interference between the warring factions,
and a vessel of our navy has been sent to lluy
tien waters to sustain our minister and for tho
protection of the pert on and property of Ameri
can cltlroiiB,
Duo precautions have been taken to enforce
our neutrality laws and prevent onr territory
from becoming the boso of military supplies for
either of tho warring faotlons.
Under color of a blockade, of which no rea
sonable notice had been given, and which doos
not appear to have been efilclently maintained, a
seizure of vessels under tho American flag has
been reported, and. In conseqnence, measures
to preveut and redress any molestation of our
innocent merchantmen havo been adopted.
LOOSE NATCBALIZATION LAWS.
With the rapid increase of Immigration to our
shores and the facilities of modern travel, ab use
of the generous privileges afforded by our natu
ralization laws call for their careful revision.
The easy and unguarded manner in which cer
tificates or American citizenship can now be ob
tained has induced a class, unfortunately large,
to avail thcmsolvcs of tho opportunity to become
absolvod from allegiance to their native land
nd yet by a foreign reaidonco to cscapo any Just
nty and contribution of service to the country
of their proposed adoption. Thus while evad
ing the duties of citizenship to the United
States, they mako prompt claim for its National
protection and demand its intervention in their
behalf. International complications of a seri
ous nature arise, and the correspondence of tho
State Department discloses the great number
and complexity of the questions which havo been
raised.
OUB DELATIONS WITH OI1EAT BniTAIN.
The questions between Great Britain and the
United States relating to the rights of American
fishermen, under treaty and international com
ity. In tho territorial waters of Canada and New
foundland, I regret to say are not yet satisfac
torily adjusted.
These manors were fully treated In my mes
sage to tho Henato of Feb. UO, 1HKH, together
with which a convention, conolnded under niv
authority with Her Majesty's Government on
the 10th of February last, for tho removal of all
causes of misunderstanding, was submitted by
mo for tho approval of the Senate.
This treaty having been rejected by tho Sen
ate I transmitted a message to tho Congress on
the 23d of Augnst last, reviewing the transac
tions and submitting for consideration certain
recommendations for legislation concerning tho
important iiucstlons involved.
Afterwards, on tho liith of September, in le
sponso to a resolution of the Senate, I again
communicated fully all the infoimatlon In my
poawHaion as to tho action of tho Government of
Canada affecting the commercial relations bo
tweeu tho Dominion and thu United States, in
cluding tho treatment of American tlshiniM is
sols in tho ports and waters of British North
America.
Thesu communications havo all been pub
lished, and therefore opened to tho knowledge
of both lion-en of UougreiH, although two weio
addressed to tho Senate alone.
Comment upon or repetition of their content
would bo superfluous, and I am not an arc that
anything has sinco occurred which shuuld bo
added to the facts therein stated. Therefore, I
merely repeat, as applicable to the present time,
the statement which will be found in my tucx.
rage to the Senate of Sept. lL'Uht, " Unit slnco
March :i, 1H7. nociue has been repoited to
the Department of titatu wherein complaint ha
beon made of unfriendly or unlawful treatment
of American fishing cko1s on tho pait of tho

not promptly and satisfactorily obtained by tho
United Ht.ites Consul-General at Halifax."
Ilaviug eaoayed, in tho dUcharge of my duty,
to procure by negotiation tho settlement of a
long-standing canso of dixpute. and to remove a
constant menace to the good rt latious of the t o
countries, ami continuing to be of opinion that
tho treaty of February last, which failed to re
ceive the approval of the Senate, did Mipply "a
tatinfactory, practical slid liual adjustment upon
a hauls honorable and Jn'it to both putties of tho
difficult and vexed question to which it related,"
and navlng suboqnently and unavailingly rec
ommended other legislation to Congress which
I hoped would suffice to meet the exigency cre
ated by the rejection of the treaty, I now again
invoke the earnest and immediate attention of
the Congress to tho condition of this important
question, as it now stands bcimo them and tho
country, and for the settlement of which I am
deeply solicitous,
LOUD BACKYILLE'b DI8UIS9AL.
Near tho closo of tho month of October last,
occurrences of a deeply regrcttablo nature were
brought to my knowledge, which made it my
painful but imperative duty to obtain, with as
littlo delay as possible, a new pergonal channel
of diplomatic Intercouse in this country with tho
Government of ki eat Britain.
The correspondence in relation to this Incident
will in duo course bo laid before you, and will

referred to in his interference by advice and
counsel with the suffrages of American citizens
In the very crisis or the Presidential election
then near at hand, and alko in his subsequent
public declarations to Justify his action, super

between the two government.

Having l rst fulfilled the Just demands of In
teruatlonal comity, by affording full opportu

lief of the situation, I considered prolongation
of discussion .to be unwarranted and thereupon
declined to further recognize the diplomatic

KATIOXAL riXAXCIS.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
exhibits in detail the condition of our National
finances and the operations of the several
branches of the Government related to this de
partment. Tho total ordinary revenues of the Oovorn
mentforthe fiscal year ended June 30, 1H88,
amounted to 1370. yoo, 074. 70, 0f which
$210,01)1,173.03 was received from customs

Tho dcrreaao In these expenditures as com

ment of raoro than jT. 000,000 for pensions In
f if ess of what was paid for that purpose in tho
atter-mcntloned year.
Tho revenncs or the Government for the year
ending June 30, 18R0, accrtaiuod for tho quar

remainder of tho time, amount to t:)77, 000,000;
and the actual and estimated ordinary expendi

ordinary expenditures for tho same time are
$27,7ii7,4HH.:i4, showing a surplus of

The foregoing statements of surplus do not
take Into account the sum necessary to be ex
pended to meet tho requirements of tho Sink-Ing-Fund
act, amounting to more than
$47,000,000 annually.
Tho cost of collecting the customs revenncs
for the last fiscal year was 3.44 per cent.; for
tho year 1885 it was 3. 77 per cent.
Tho excess of internal revenue taxes collected
during tho last fiscal year over those collected
for tho year ended June 30, 18R7, was S5.4H0,

Tho number of pensioners added to the rolls
during tho fiscal year ended Jnno 30, 1888,1s
00,263; and Increase of pensions was granted
in 4r,71(I cases. The names of IS, 730 pen
sioners were dropod from tho rolls during tho
year for various causes, and at tho closo of tho
year the numbor of persons of all classes receiv
ing pensions was 4&3,rr7. Of these thore were
800 survivors of tho war of 1813, 10,787 wid

hevihiom or pension laws needeu.
Ism thoroughly convinced that our general
pension laws should be revised and adjusted to
meet, as far as possiblo in tho light of our ex
perience, all meritorious cases. Tho fact that
102 different rates of pensions are paid can not,
in my opinion, bo made consistent with justlco
to tho pensioners or to the Government; and tho
numerous private pension bills that aro passed,
pi cdlctwl upon tho Imporfcctlon of general laws,
while they Increase In many cases oxlating ine
quality and Injustice lond additional force to
tho rcconimomlatlon for a revision of the gen"
cral laws on this subject,
Tho laxity of ideas prevailing among a largo
number of our people regarding pensions is be
coming every day more marked. Tho principles
upon which tlicv should bo granted aro in danger
of being altogether Ignored. andal ready pensions
aro often claimed because the applicants are as
much entitled as other successful applicants
rather than upon any disability reasonably at
tributable to military service. If tho establish
ment of vicious precedents lw continued, if
tho granting of pensions bo not divorced from
partisau and other nnworthy and irrelevant
considerations, and if the honorable namo of
veteran unfairly becomes by theso means but
another term for one who constantly clamors
for tho aid of tho Government, thoro Is danger
that injury will bo done to the famo and patrfot-
ism of many whom onr citizens all delight to
lonor, and that a prejudice will bo aroused un
ust to meritorious applicants for pensions.
