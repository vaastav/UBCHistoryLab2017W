PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
"We predicted last -week the receipt
of the message in time for notice to
day, but had The San Diego Union
not gone to the expense of having the
entire document specially telegraphed
it from San Francisco, the citizens of
Tucson would not have read it this
-week. The S. D. Bulletin reprinted
it from The Union, and altogether it
was pretty extensively circulated here
Thursday morning. The Union, for a
'country weekly,' on that score, can go
'up head.' The message was deliver
ed Tuesday, the 5th, and in quantity
of matter it would half fill this sheet,
or nearly, in this type. In quality, we
think it less subject to criticism on the
part of people or politicians, than any
of Grant's pen-productions sinco his
grand summing up of the war. No
question expected, is avoided, and all
are treated in an unequivocal style ; it
is evidently all his own. He reads
John Bull a lesson on the hackneyed
'Alabama Claims' unpleasantness that
is refreshing for once in a long time :
wants Congress to properly present the
bill, and he guarantees a peaceable and
honorable settlement for both And
he talks to the mother country more
'like a father' on her shabby treatment
of Young America on the great lakes
and river St. Lawrence ; in short, ho
twits tho British Lion in a way that
ho will 'roar again.' The President
insists at length and stoutly upon the
early acquisition of tho island (Repub
lic) of St. Domingo, and we think such
a foot-hold would bo the entering
wedge to ultimate establishment of tho
Monroe Doctrine, which ho says ought
to be held more sacred than ever. He
refers to his recognition of tho French
republic as a matter of sympathy and
abstract right, but wants no hand in
European troubles. "Wants united ac
tion to protect citizens in China ; wants
the shipping interest assisted, and ad
vises farther subsidy of Pacific marine.
"Wants the settler's rights particularly
guarded on the public lands. "We have
room this week but for the annexed
paragraphs in full the first doubtless
refers to the Lower California schemes
and the second explains itself:
It is to be regretted that our repre
sentations in regard to the in jurious
effects (especially upon the revenue of
the United States) of the policy of the
Mexican Government in exempting
from import duties a large tract of its
territory on our borders, have not on
ly been fruitless, but that it is even
proposed in that country to extend the,
limits within which the privilege has
hitherto been enjoyed.
I would sum up the policy of the
Administration to bo : A thorough en
forcement of every law; a faithful
collection provided for revenue, and
economy in the disbursements of the
same ; a prompt payment of the debt
of the nation ; a reduction of the taxes
as rapidly as the requirements of the
country will admit of a reduction of
taxation; and a tariff to be so arrang
ed, as to afford the greatest good, to
the greatest number ; honest and fair
dealings with all other peoples, to the
end that Avar with all its blighting con
sequences may be avoided, but without
surrendering any right or obligation
due to us ; a reform in the treatment
of the Indians, and in the whole Givil
Service of the country, and finally, in
securing a sure, untrammeled ballot,
when every man now entitled to cast
a vote may do so, just once, at each e
lection, without fear of molestation or
persecution on account of his political
faith, nationality or color.
IXDIAX Murdered. Gov. Saf
ford issued a proclamation, calling on
the authorities and all persons to ar
rest if possible the white man (?) or
men who murderedja Hualapai Indian,
while scouting near Prescott lately.
The Indian was acting as scout for
the party, someof whom overtaking
uu murdering him, so as to have it
to say that they had taken a scalp.
The Indian is a bad enough animal,
rrhen he gets down to it, but there are
mtrt&js porsons of the white or sup
jiKsed civilized races, that can dis
jount him at his worst.
The hostile Indians of Arizona have
oeen on their good behavior sometime
He is Not to Blame.
Deficient by nature and education
in the first instincts of a gentleman,
ruined in purse and reputation, failing
in blackmailing or injuring any one
by his slanders, the junior member of
tho Duffield firm is fast grinding out
the laws preparatory to packing the
carpet bag he talks so much about
and leaving the country. "When ho
goes, he will leave no void in thi3
community that cannot be filled with
mud or clay of equal dimensions.
Never occupying a position until re
cently, except that of servitude, he
could not stand tho elevation of being
treated as an equal, and ho sunk in
the mire of his own ignorance and in
famy. "We repeat he is not to blame.
"We suppose God made him, and we
charitably believe for somo good pur
pose, certainly not for the editor of a
newspaper. Even his partner would
not claim him a success in that re
spect. But we will not delve into the mys
terious workings of Deity to attempt
to find out what he was made for. It
is sufficient for us to know that his
carpet bag is packed, the publication
of the laws is nearly completed, the
circulation of his paper has dwindled
to nothing, and very soon we shall
know him and his little sheet no more
forever.
As hospital steward, his indolence
and impudence brought him before a
court martial ; as a "dog robber," he
tasted his master's wines and liquors
bo extensively, and ran his anus to
tho elbows so frequently into his pre
serves, that ho proved an utter failure
in that position ; and when he paid
his way to this town in the capacity
of a cook for a train, we are assured
that charity alone caused the humane
train master to tolerate him in that po
sition to keep him from starving.
"Wo intended that the foregoing art
icle, first published last week, should
bo fully conclusive on the subject in
question ; but by particular request on
the part of old residents well posted,
and who vouch for the perfect charac
ter of the sketch in every feature, it
is reproduced. But we te i those gentle
men that tho game was not worth ono
iota of the space devoted to it, and
that this littlo paper (Tiie Citizen)
has a better mission for every line of
its columns, and it shall be the earnest
endeavor to crowd it hereafter with the
news and practical ideas of Territorial
affairs, stated in a clear and readable
style. It shall be as a good egg full
of meat, and welcome on every table.
There has ever been a want of such a
sheet in Arizona, and it will be as safe
an investment as tho community can
find for the money.
According to all the indications we
have ever seen, there has never been
anything but a questionable shapo of
a newspaper in this part of Arizona
ere the advent of The Citizex. The
subject of the above sketch has been
thoroughly dissected tried and found
wanting in every journalistic sense ;
in short, we doubt if a committee of
rag-and-bone pickers or night-workmen,
in the liight of charity, would
place it on the list of what political
economists designate as useful nuisan
ces ; there being nothing of the phos
phorous remaining but the perfumery.
For as a specimen of 'the art pre
servative,' it is a repulsive commentary
and reflection upon the crudest style of
printing since the inventor (Dr. Faust)
was in league with the devil, its ex
istence from first to last has been but
a flickering one (through general busi
ness, incapacity depending on passages
of the hat, yet snapping at the hands
that fed and be-friendedit, and damn
ed by all who have ever had anything
to do with it), always bordering on final
dissolution, in shape and substance,
excepting the sweet-scentedness, &c. ;
on this head, the person or thing whose
name appears in all the rural impor
tance and big type of 'editor,' would
have the reader (it may have one be
side himself) to infer that he is one of
those would-be extra-nice bodies, who
are so replete with natural nastiness
that they hesitate in their language
for want of suitable words to conceal
their ruling qualities. Dean Swift,
tho chief of satirists, pronounces these
the most contemptible of all creatures
of 'the human form divine.'

LETTER FROM SAN DIEGO.
All about Staging Mr. Uajiron on the Road
New Coaches and Fresh Stock Military
New Phase of Freight Question Jiumors
Fears, Etc.
Sax Diego, Cal., Dec. 10, 1870.
Beached here yesterday at 11 a. m.
The trip is easy and pleasant as any
can be in the interior, over deserts and
mountains. Men who make the trip
and expect quiet repose in tho stage,
and extra fare at the stations are un
reasonable and their complaints gen
erally should be treated with contempt.
I'm sure that I'm stating the truth,
when I say that the meals average as
good and palateablo and varied in their
dishes, as upon any interior route out
side of Arizona and California. Eve
rything pertaining to the trip, includ
ing the comfort of the stag es and time
made per-day, excepting the mis
connection at Arizona City which will
soon bo corrected, and likely will ere
this gets into print is very good, and
though not faultless in every littlo
particular, no fault can be found.
The drivers without exception do
their duty well. Mr. Capron, leaves
this evening on a visit along the line,
and will so arrange that no farther
mis-connection will be made at Arizo
ua City, though he should be obliged
to increase the time up to that allow
ed by the official schedule. Growl
ers should bear in mind that he has
been giving the public a mail in Tuc
son from here in about 4 days in
stead of tho 7 allowed. It too often
happens that a people grv ungrate
ful and even mean under better treat
ment than they deserve, or, as in this
case, the law intends for them, and
become so persistent in their misguid
ed or wilful obstinacy that tho favore
they have been receiving are lost to
them in consequence.
New coaches of excellent mnke
and finish will soon be placed upon
the entire line. One i3 now running
between here and M ountain'Springs,
another, one is just finished for the
California desert between there and
Arizona City, and two more arc: or
dered to cover the other end of the
route. These new coaches are first
class. Twelve head of fresh stock
have just been started out, and every
step being taken to givo the public
what they have not before had on this
route, entirely new and comfortable
coaches drawn by fine stock. I have
thus been particular in reforence to
this stage business, because fault has
uureasonably been found, and because
it is really good and improving, and
even better than the business justifies
in a strictly moneyed sense the one
by which sensible people are gener
ally governed in their enterprises.
Capt. Miles, of tho 21st. Infantry,
passed Mountain Springs, on the 8th.,
in company with Paymaster Sprague.
Gen. Geo. B. Dandy, will return
veiy soon to resume his duties as A.
A. Q. M., at the Arizona City Depot:
and Capt. Craguie, who has been act
ing in his absence, is en-route to San
Francisco withhis family, and is ex
pected here in season to take the
steamer Senator next Monday.
There is not a full load of Arizona
frieght at this place. Enough is ex
pected by steamer Senator to-morrow
to make up a 10-mule load.
It is feared h.ere that tho Colorado
Steam Nav. Co., will put a steamer
on from San Frsncisco, via the mouth
of the Gulf, and take such other mea
sures to insure dispatch and cheapness
that it will be impossible to freight
directly overland from here, and the
fear is a reasonable one. Business is
business, and many can play at it, and
and all never win.
There is now a slight nervousness
here on the railway terminus ques
tion but every effort is being put forth
to win the prize. J. "W.
Eclipse. A total eclipse of the sun
occurs on tho 22d next Thursday, but
visible only to portions of Europe, &c.
Nature perhaps intends that this re
gion shall have all the light (which it
needs), and the dark and disorderly of
Europe be crowned with night.
The rains and snows in the Prescott
region are expected to make placer
mining profitable next season.
