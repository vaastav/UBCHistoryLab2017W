New TopJj. Bun: Xfv nom«-nf the 01*1
school lawyers and brokers who were
known to New York, twenty-five years
ago could make a tour o£ hy downtown
offices occupied by their successors
they might suspect that the letter were
extravagantly luxurious in tneir sur
roundings. In their day a lawyer's of
flee looked like a workshop, and so long
as its furniture served its purpose it
did not matter whether It was artistic
or not, and ordinary matting was good
onough for the floors. The change that
has come about in office furnishings in
recent years is now very noticeable.
Quite as much attention is paid to
decorating and furnishing them as to
the private homes of their owners. One
of the large bond 'firms in this city
has offices in which the hangings, fur
niture and soft rugs represent an ex
pense larger than the equipment of a
well appointed privtilo house. A brok
erage firm hired olRres a few weeks
ago in a new building that will cost
them about $j)0,000 a year in rent and
they have furnished them accordingly.
The man who comes into the private
office of a member of the firm from
the noise of the busy street outside
experiences a sense of relief and com
fort that may make him more amiable.
He walks on thick rugs or soft car
pets and he sits in a beautifully made
chair that is comfortable. If he is
kept waiting he may find excellent
pictures on the walls and pleasing
colors in the furnishings. There are
men in New York now who make a
profitable specialty of the designing
and furnishing of handsome offices. The
rivalry among big firms for handsome
offices is strong. Apparently It Is a
good business investment.

New Zealand is being swept by an
epidemic of minor sickness—Influenza,
measles nnd scarlet fever. One of the
evils of war has overtaken New Zeal
and. Among the returned troops from
Fouth Africa are many invalids, and
these have brought with them eomp

addition to her present sugar cnno

arrangements are being made to place

ytie pupils of the high and upper
ftrammar schools at Kansas City struck
the other day, because the school board
jefused to grant their petition to close
the schools for a circus. So well organ
ized was the strike that the schools
could not open dui-ing the day.
Various new industries, whlcii have
arisen in New York of recent yearn,
have called for the addition of new
terms to the language. In electricity,
'•he result has been bewildering, the
j»ew words being hardly adopted as
common English.
No fewer than 687,884 prisoners were
tin the prisons of British India, in 1899
1900, and increase of 92,064 over the

only. 84,656 were "females, which :is a

In fifty years the words and
phrases of the English language lexl
conlzed under the letter "A" have in
creased from 7,0001 in number tto nearly
60,000. Science arid invention .requiring
new terms are largely responsible.

interesting Discussions.
Huron, S. D., Dec, 3.—Great Interest
is being taken by the creamery and
dairymen, as Well, as the farmers of
South Dakota, In the annual convention
of-the South Dakota Dairy and Butter
Maker's association, to be held in this
cUy TuesdayrWednesday and Thursday
of this week.
To the development of the creamery
and dairy industry of -the state is
largely due the present great prosper
ity of the far/ners of South Dakota.
Prl6r to eight or ten years ago farm
ers generally i.throughout the state
clung to the one-crop idea and staked
practically all on 'their wheat crops.
During seasons'of-partial crop failures
they were -driven -to financial extrem
ities,' and Anally became interested in
creameries. Scores of'these prosperity
producers were cstabltshed at various
points 4ti the agricultural portion of
the state, und hard times amons the
farmers -of South Dakota became a
thing of 'the p^ist. The development of
the cre-imery industry has been very
rapid, untll'today there are in Uie stote
about 175 such institutions, which an
nually place iln 'the farmers'pockets an
aggregate .of about $0,000,000. An inter
esting program has been prepared .for
the coming meeting.

SIOUX FALLS MAN
ACCUSED OF MURDER
W. F. Reynolds Is Arrested
Charged With Killing
Negro.
LATTER FOUND IN FIELD
Friends of Prisoner Believe His De«
nial of Guilt—Crofter Rode With
Reynolds Last Day Seen
Alive.
Sioux Fails, S. D., Nov. 29.—There
was considerable excitement in this
city last evening when it was reported
around that W. F. Reynolds, a well
known citizen, had been arrested on
the charge of murdering Samuel
Crofter, a iicuto. For three days past
\V. I. Thompson, constable of Ireton,
la., has been in Sioux Falls working on
a chain of circumstances which finally
culminated in the arrest of Mr. Rey
nolds.
Constable Thompson says that on
October 28 the dead bony of a colored
man was found In a corn field near
Ireton. There were deep holes in the
front and back of the head and every
thing indicated foul play. Constable
Thompson began. work on the case at
once. It was discovered that the dead
man was Samuel Crofter, a colored
preacher, who had gone nearly blind.
It was also Ifearned that he left I-Ia
warden, ia., on the afternoon of Au
gust 2 in company with W. F. Rey
nolds. Reynolds Is a traveling sales
man for A. S. Paddock of this city, a
dealer in sewing machines, pianos and
organs. He travels around the country
by team, and was driving from Hawar
den to Ireton when he met the colored
man. Constable Thompson says that he
has a strong case against the accused,
but he did not care to make any more
testimony public before the hearing.
Accused Stoutly Denies.
Mr. Reynolds was greatly upset by
the arrest. He stoutly denies any con
nection with the murder, but admits
having made the trip as claimed. He
states that he left the colored man at
a point outside of Ireton, while he
drove on to see a customer, and had
never seen or heard of him from that
day to this. Mr. Reynolds retained At
torney C. H. Wlnsor of this city to de
fend him. He has announced his will
ingness to return to Ireton without
requisition papers. He is now in charge
of Sheriff Huston of this county, but
will go to Iowa on Friday, accompa
nied by his attorney.
The accused is well known in this
city, where he has resided a number of
years. No one here believes him guilty.
He is a peaceful, inoffensive, quiet fel
low, without any bad habits. He has
wife and four children living here.

WEEKLY REVIEW OF TRADB
Enormous Demand for Steel an In
dex of the Situation.
New York, Dec. 2.—Bradstreet's, Re
view of Trade says:
The advent of more seasonable
weather has given the apparently only
needed stimulus to retail and holiday
demand in the northeast and portions
of the south. From now on retail rath
er than wholesale demand will attract
most attention. Colder weather and
snow would, however, benefit north
western trade and -Industry, though
the open weather prevailing has en
abled more than ordinarily complete
farming preparations and extended
holiday activity. Accompanying the
improvement in the tone of trade there
has been a broadening and deepening
in speculation in leading food staples,
-and, all in all, there is a rather more
Cheerful feeling prevailing.
No sign of the usual seasonable quiet
ing down in the demand for iron and
steel is apparent, and buyers are as
eager as ever to obtain supplies. The
car shortage and the congestion of
freight in several districts have been
accentuated by the switchmen's strike,
and the trouble there, if anything, is
aggravated. A number of furnaces
are banked and several mills are idle
for lack of supplies. In finished prod
ucts, bars, sheets and structural ma
terial, all are active and there has
been an improvement in plate's. Foun
dry iron is 50 cents higher at Chicago
and 75 cents to $1 per ton advanced on
ruling rates must be paid for prompt
delivery of pig iron and billets at
Pittsburg. The big steel interests are
reported as having plenty of cars, but
not enough motive power is offered.
Bradstreet's Halifax correspondent re
ports a large sale of Cape Breton steel
in the United States. Light and heavy
hardware is active, and the supply of
tin has been practically cornered, with
Jthe result that prices are 5 cents per
pound higher on the week.
Less is naturally doing in the whole
pale distribution of dry goods, but the
reassorting demand is reported of good
Ivolume. Sales for next spring are not
as heavy as expected. At the east busi
ness in print cloths is slow, and there
}s less doing in brown cottons for ex
port, but these goods are reported
largely sold ahead to March. The flurry
in prints is over and no business in
printed goods for future delivery can
be placed at the recent cut rate. In
woollen goods the situation is one of
Ihe best for years. Dress woollens are
jsteady, flannels are active, and heavy
(overcoatings are in exceptional de
mand. The 1901 wool clip promises to
be 5 per cent larger than last year, and
supplies are heavier than a year ago,
but the demand, on the other hand, is
also better.
Eastern shoe manufacturers are ask
ing and getting 2 to 2% cents per pair
advance over prices made two months
iago. Factories are busy on reassorting
orders, and a number are too busy to
take stock. Leather is still firm at the
late advance, and belting leather Is 20
per cent higher at Philadelphia.
The strength of coarser grains, corn
and oats, has been the sustaining
feature to wheat, which might other
wise have receded on large northwest
ern receipts and a heavy increase in
the visible supply. A review of the
(world's cereal food supply shows a
shrinkage this year of 1,056,000 bush
els, as compared with last year.
Provisions are showing exceptional
strength, due to shorts covering and
reported heavy buying by packers.
Hog receipts are large, but their
weights are light, and this accounts
for the relatively greater advance in
lard.
Wheat, including flour, exports for
the week aggregate 5,117,478 bushels, as
against 5,518,930 bushels last week and
2,497,880 bushels in this week last year.
"Wheat exports from July 1 to date
(twenty-two weeks) aggregate 127,819,

els last season.
Corn exports aggregate 630,968 bush
els, as against 445,351 bushels last week,

CONGRESS Wilt
CONVENE TODAY
President Roosevelt's Message
Will Not Be Read Till
Tuesday^
SESSION TO BE BRIEF
Kyle's Death Will Be Announced In
Senate 'and Adjournment Taken—
Tuesday McKlnley's Death
Will Be Announced.
Washington, Dec. 2.—One- of the firsi'
measures of national interest whlcl
will be introduced in the senate at th»
session which begins today will be
resolution looking to public action con
cerning the death of President McKin
ley. This will bo presented on Tuesdaj.
by either Senator Foraker or. Senator
Hanna, possibly the former, and aftei
Its introduction the senate will adjourr
immediately as a mark of respect tc
the memory of the dead president. The
annual message of President Roosevelt
will not be received until Tuesday, as
the session of Monday will be exceed
ingly brief. It is not- expected that any
thing will" ba done today beyond
the announcement of the death of Sen
ator Kyle, following which the senatei
In accordance with custopi, will ad
journ for the day. On Tuesday th«
president's message will be read, and
after its reading the announcement ol
the death of President McKinley will
follow at once, whereupon under th«
precedent established when Presidents
Lincoln and Garfield aled, resolutions
providing for the appointment of a
committee to act with a similar com
mittee of the house of representatives
to take appropriate action relative to
the matter and then calling for imme
diate adjournment for the dny, will ba
adopted. Heretofore committees have•
been appointed to arrange the details'
of public exercises, and it is under
stood that this plan will be pursued in
this instance, and that later in tho
session some public man of distinction
will be invited to deliver a eulogy in
the capitol.
Wednesday and Thursday will' be de
voted to the introduction of new bills,
and as usual there will be a flood ol
them. Among the first, bills of import
ance to be presented will be the ship
subsidy bill, which will be introduced
by Senator .Frye, and the Nicaragua
canal' bill, which Senator"~Morgan will
present. Senator Frye has not entire
ly completed the bill, but he said Satur
day that it would be different in many
details from the old bill of last session.
That measure was framed by former
Senator Kdmunds. Senator Frye him
self is the author of the new bill. Sen
ator Morgan's canal bill will be-a du
plicate of Representative Hepburn's
bill on the canal question. Other early
bills of Importance will be one looking
to the construction of a submarine
cable from the western coast to Hawaii),
and another providing for the estab
lishment of a new executive depart,
ment to be known as the department ol'
commerce. On Thursday the senate
will adjourn until the following Mon
day.
The general opinion among senators
is that veyy little real work will be
done before the Christmas holidays.
The first subject demanding attention
Is reciprocity. Various treaties are'
now pending In the senate' locking to
commercial agreements between the:
United States and other countries. Sen
ator Aldrlch will renew his effort tc
have these treaties, which already have
been reported from the committee on
foreign relations, committed to thff
committee on finance, on the ground"
that they deal with tariff questions. T|ie
friends of the treaties will oppose thir
demand, and the preliminary skirmish
expected to ensue probably will serve
to develop some Interesting features.
The early days of the session will b«
marked by the reorganization of the
senate committees, so far as may be
necessary, and a caucus of the repub
lican members will be held today -foi
the purpose of considering this ques
tion and appointing a committee to
suggest means for the vacancies. The
most important place to be filled is t|ia1
of chairman of the committee on for
eign relations. It is generally conceded
that Senator Cullom, who is the senior
republican member of that committee^
will succeed to the chairmanship.

More Than Half a Million Dollars to
Bjb Divided Among the Heirs.
New York, Dec. 2.—According to
the Herald, more than half a million
dollars_is to be distributed among the
heirs of George Bancroft, historian,
who died in Washington, D. C., on Jan
uary 17, 1891.
The New York Life Insurance and
Trust company, as trustees, brought
suit for a construction of certain
clauses of the-will and also for an'
accounting. Mr. Bancroft was 91 years
old at the time of his death. A peculiar
feautre of his will, executed in 1887,
was the tying up of the bulk of his
fortune until November 1, 1900. Charles
C.' Grover and James M. Johnson were
appointed executors and trustees. The
referee, Franklin B. Lord, has report
ed that at the end of three years the
executors turned over to the trust
company securities worth $561,873, and
this has since increased to $614,426. The
referee finds that $68,000 is now suffi
cient to pay the, income to the annui
tants.
This leaves almost $550,000 for imme
diate. distribution. This will -be as fol
lows: One-fourth to.the estate of John
C. Bancroft, one-fourth to Sarah Wool
onghon, one-fourth to Susanna Car
roll and one-twelfth each to Wilder
Dwight Bancroft, Pauline Bancroft
Flach and Esther Bancroft,- children of
John C. Bancroft.
