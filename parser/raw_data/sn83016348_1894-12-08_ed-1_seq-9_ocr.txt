The Pains of Catarrh
According to the best authorities.originate in
a morbid condition of the gelatinous and (
albuminous tissues, circulates with the
blood and attacks the fibrous tissues,
particularly in the joints, and thus causes
the local manifestations of the disease.
The back and shoulders are the parts
usually affected by rheumatism, and the
joints at the knees, ankles, hips amf wrists are
also sometimes attacked. Thousands of
people have found in Hood’s Sarsaparilla a
positive and pornufnent cure for rheumatism.
It has had remarkable success in curing the
most severe eases. The secret of its success
H'*m in the fact that it attacks at once the cause
of the disease by neutralizing the luetic acid
and purifying the blood, as well as strength
ening every function of the body.
CONGRESS IN SESSION.
The Opening: Proceedings of the
Usual Routine Character.
BIG DISPLAY OF FLOWERS.
Close Attention Given to the Reading of
the President's Message.
Washington, Dec. 3.- Bright sunshine,
with an atmosphere slightly tinged with frost,
I combined to produce a typical autumn day
; and brought large crowds to the Capitol to
witness the opening of the third session of
the Fifty third Congress. The galleries were
tilled to their utmost capacity fully an hour
before the hour appointed for the
assembly, and notwithstanding the faetthat it
was well understood the proceedings would
j be commonplace and routine in character,
tin* crowds lingered until the last lines of the
Presidents message were read and the first
legislative session was officially declared at
an end. The House side of the Capitol was
the main point of attraction. The early
arrivals having filled the galleries, those
unable to secure admission to the lofts swarm
ed over the floor of the House and remained
until warned of the approach of the time for
the formal commencement of business.
THE USUAL SCENES.
The usual scenes that attend the opening
of a session were enacted. Members exchaug
ed greetings with gamine warmth and
evident sincerity, ai d the results of the
recent political struggle were talked over with
no suggestions of exaltation on the part of
tin* victorious and without acrimony on the
part of those vanquished. The Democrats
i took the good-natured chaffing in the best
of humor, consoling themselves with the
reflection that their successful opponents
wen* not without experience in adversity,
and that they were not unlikely to undergo
similar feelings in the future. There was
the isual liberal display of flowers, and
neither side was neglected in these floral
•ontributions. On the desk of Linton, of
Michigan, rested the model of what was
Intended for a school house, composed of
red and white immortelles, a fringe of bine
flowers extending around the cornice and
surmounting impossible chimneys. It was
.•mitribufed by the A. P. A., in acknowledg
ment of the defence of that organization made
at the last session by the re Ipient, \ legend
informed anxious inquirers that the structure
Wi'.' ‘the little red school house."
A SIIII* OK STATE KoR MIL UEEH.
Mr. I! I was favored with a ship of Slate.
■•• imposed of choice II W r.-. which completely
oy- red his desk and winch bore a 1.-g-'iul
assuring the big man from Maim that, if
properly guided, it would carry him to a
most desirable haven. An immense hors -
shoe also expressed the hopes of Mr. ReedV.
admirers and was propped against the ship
of state. Mr Reed entered the hall soon
after half p.ist 11, un las he proceeded to his
seat was given a • - dial reception by his
political associates and applauded by the
gal! Ties. Mr. Wilson of West Virginia, entered
s- .n after Mr. Reed ami was also greet' d
warmly by his political associates. There
vas nothing in the manner of Mr. Wilson to
indicate that he had suffered lefeat at the
recent election. A marked improvement is
noticeable in his physical appearance since
tic adjournment.
BUSINESS BEGINS,
At precisely 12 o’clock Speaker Crisp came
into the hall, and, as he passed to ids place,
members on both sides of the aisle which di
vides the parties joined in giving him a warn
welcome. The House was immediately called
to order, ami the routine business proceeded
with as though there had been no long inter
ruption of its sittings. After the presence of
a quorum had been ascertained by calling the
roil, a resolution was adopted to appoint a
committee to wait upon the President, in con
junction with n similar con mittee on the
part of the Senate, and to inform him that
Congress had convened and was ready to re
ceive any communication he might be pleased
to make. Messrs. Wilson, Holman and Reed
were the committee appointed, ami a recess
was taken until one o’clock, which was subse
quently extended to half-past one. the Senate
having taken a recess to that hour.
IN THE SENATE.
Tim proceedings in the Senate did not
differ materially from tlio.se of the House.
There was agr at crowd in tlie galleries, but.
while there was less confusion on tho floor
than on that of the House, there was the
same profuse display of flowers and the same
degree ol liberality exhibited by the donors
in their distribution. The attendance of Sen
ators was remarkably largo’ only 15 failing to
answer the roll call. Senator Hill was among
the delinquents. The committee appointed to
wait on the President reported at 1.30. and
the report was followed immediately by Sec
retary Pruden, who presented the President’s .
message, first making his appearance in the '
Senate and proceeding directly therefrom to
the Hall of the House, The reading of the
message was ot once proceeded with in the
Houses and was given close attention by both
sit les.
