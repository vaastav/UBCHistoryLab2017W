?&?Rshabkablb Accidsnt?A Mas :
Sw-AtLows HIS Set OK Teeth in his Slbbp*
-On Friday night last, Mr. Madegan, re
5iding in Cleveland, awoke with a sense of
jrfocation, and discovered that during his
r ?Pp he had swallowed a partial set of
uetb, with the gold plate to wliich they
were attached.
The plate is crescent shaped, hooked at
each end, and having three teeth set at ir
regular intervals on it. How it could have
passed into his throat is difficult to account
for. As soon as he discovered the extent
of the accident, Mr. Madegan's first idea
vas to send at once for a physician, but
Afterwards though* the object might pass
through him without difficulty. Eventn*
ill/it got into his stomach, and caused'
excruciating pain. The case is one of great
difficulty, and in its present stage bot little
can be doae other than to await the oper
ation of nature, assisted by medicine.
So surgical operation can. of course, be
performed at present, and from the pecu
liar formation af the object, it is not easy
t^HBS through the stomach and intestines
^frijhout inflicting serious injury.
New Toll Gatb.?We understand
from Mr. Lunsford, Superintendent of the
portion of the Natioual Road passing
Jfctfugb Virginia, that a new toll gate is
a boat to be established on the top of the
bill, east of the city. The road Is intend
ed to be a self-sustaining institution, and
of lite years it has become sadly ouL of
repair. Some ten bridges betweoa 'this
city and West Alexander are in want of
repair to make the road passable. The
road not only bos no money, but \a in debt,
and the Superintendent, knowing the im
portance of the thoroughfare, has deter
mined to establish a new gate at the point
indicated, 'as a means of increasing the
revenue. The existence of tbis toll gate
will not increase the toll of those going to
Triadelphih. or points eastward, as tickets
will be furnished to through travelers. It
is only intended to catch those who use the
road between the city and the three mile
gate and no further.
a Niooaa.?Mr. Snider, one of
Vifye members 61, the Legislature, from Mo
nongalia, has Introduced into the Legisla
ture a resolution, instructing the Commit
tee on Courts of Justice to "inquire into
|^*he expediency" of so amending sections
26, 27, 28 and 20 of Chapter 108 of the
Code of 1860, as to nmke them conform to
the spirit And genius of our institutions.
These sections prohibit any man from
writing or speaking of the institution of
slavery, under the penalties of fine and
imprisonment. The committee's report
will doubtless cause some discussion.
J^-Thb WiATHER.?We caonot call to
mind the time.in December when we have
had such weather as we bare been blessed
wilh for the past week. No fires were
burning, the windows were opon and the
birds were singing as in the Spring.. The
state.of the atmosphere yesterday, howev
er, warned us that the past few days wero
not a correct prognostic of the coming
winter, as farmers represent that it will
be a severe one, thick buds and bark hav
ing formed, and other sure indications
| having appeared.
5QT* Obit New Paaas ?We yos terday re
ceived a new steam press which is render
ed necessary by our large and increasing
^ circulation. The press is a large, buiky
thing, and our whole forco was employed
most of the day in getting it up stairs. We
are particularly indebted to Capt. Charley
Cattlette, who acted the disinterested pa
?riot and kindly volunteered to bossthejob.

Mr. Edwards of N. H. moved that the

ho naid we are to have a war of long con
Unu^nce in "hich bravery and ski.?

Agreed to?yeas 78 hays 64.
Tbe resolution heretofore introduced*
looking to a recognition of the indepen
dence of Hayti and Liberia, coming up,
Mr. Oox, nt Ohio, offered as an amend
ment that the Committee on Foreign Af
fairs inquire into the expediency of doing '
so, instead of direct instructions to report >
a bill fur that purpose. He said instead of
bringing .up so frequently the pestiferous
negro, the country expects Congress to
give a little time to more important sub
jects.
The amendment was agreed to and the
resolution adopted.
Mr. Vallandigham called attention to
the fact that the Select Committee wsb ap
pointed at the former Congress to consider
the subject of the abolition of the frank
ingprivilege. Tbe bill reported by that
committee was first on tbe calendar and it
was his desire that members should ex
amine it before it regularly comes up for
consideration.
Mr. Colfax remarked: that the Committee
on Post offices and Post Roads had framed
a bill to abolish tbe franking, with other
provisions, swelling the revenue and satis
fying tho public desire. They propose to

bravo soldier, a true and incorruptible
patriot.
Mr. Cowan, of Pa., claimed* for Pennsyl
vania, tbe foster mother of the dead, the
right to weep and pay her tribute to his

ness by the' Mexicans at Monterey and

New York, Dec. 11.?A private letter'
has been received from a party on board
the steamer Richmond, which took part in
the Inst fight at Port Pickens, dated Nov.
23d. He slates that the Richmond com
menced bombardiug Fort McRae ut 10
o'clock on the morning of the 22d. The
writer liad been complimenting the cap
tain of one of the guns on the accuracy of
bis aim, when, he says, a shell bounded
through our bulworks, took the captain's
hend pjfattd wounded six mod. This shell
ou exploding raised the ship out of water
and made her stagger like a drunkeu man.
Another shell burst six feet below the
water line, causing a bad leak, but the
steam pumps kept thejvessel free. The
firing was continued all day and was re
sumed by the enemy on the next morning,
when we moved out of his range. The
Niagara still kept at them, but being out
side of the enemy's guns., she cannot. be
much.,injured. Fort Pickens had up to
date lost but one man killed and seven
wounded. Fort McRae was much damaged,
but we cannot destroy it with our smooth
bore guns, as they are uo match for the
enemy's rifle cannon. Tbe bombardment
was to b* renewed next day, 23d, with a
determination to whip or be whipped.
