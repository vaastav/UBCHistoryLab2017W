THURSDAY EVENING. DEC 9. 1H97
It seems that the annexation of the
Sind wich Islands is not a3 popular as
tie President supposed it was when he
wrote his recent first annual message
Congress. How he was ever led to
b?lieve it was, or could be popular, is
hird.totell. From the commencement of
this government until the breaking < ut
of the war between the States, the peo
pie of this country have favored homo
rule, not ouly here, but in Ireland, fiom
which so many of them aud their fore?
bears have come. How then could
tbey countenance an attempt to rob the
one hundred and ten thousand na'ive
people of Hawaii of their country and
give it to three thousaud filibustering
yaukeet? Why any disinterested South
ern man should advocutesucb a scheme
is passing strange, the more especially,
asthe products of Hawaii compete only
with those of the South.
A case has just been reported to the
pinsloi bureau in which a Presby
teriau elder is drawing a pension of
thirty dollars a month for deafness
wao is managing a long distance tele
phone. The pension bill now before
Congress appropriate? nearly a bun
dred and fifty million dollars for next
yaar. A fair aud just examination and
purging of the list would reddea tba1
sum at least one-half, and that would
be a great deal more than was ever
anticipation by either of President
McKinley's predecessors, General
Grant or Mr. Garfield.
At a meeting of the democratic
caucus of the Virginia legislature las!
night, a resolution declaring any cttn
didate ineligible who had boiled the
democratic ticket last year was debat?
ed. This, of course, was putting a pre?
mium upon bolters, Wise men h;.\e
a'ways advocated discipline in a politi?
cal party as well as iuan army, but,
j idging from some of the recent acls cf
the Virginia legislature, the goddets
of wisdom has gathered up her skitt<
and fled from the Capitol at Richmond.
It may be all right for the poor tax
riddeu people of this country to have
an additional burden of a quarter of a
million put upon them, as is propos?d
by a bill introduced in Congress to-day,
to send provisions to a few men who, of
their own free will, left their homes
and went to British America after geld
for themselves; but there is no doubt cf
the fact that many of those upon whem
that burden will be laid don't think so,
though their natural humanity will
prevent them from objecting.
The fact that at a general meeting of
the Fall River Manufacturers' Associa?
tion, yesterday, it was resolved to re?
duce wages to the extent of ten per
cent, ou the first of next mouth, doesn't
iniicate, to auybody else than repub
licins and bolters, the approach of tb?
dawn of prosperity. Why, to intelli?
gent people, the difficulty of gettir g
blood out of a turnip is no greater thnn
to derive hope of business improvement
from the present or prospective coudt
tion of things.
One of the republican newspapers of
Baltimore, in speakiug of the re-election
of Senator Daniel, says : "It is a greai
pity that the old State did not select a
man who has sound views on the money
question." Senator Daniel is with his
party, State and national, on the mo?e>
question. But when Senator Gorman
shall leave the Senate, Maryland will
have no Senator who is sound on buy
question, or who will be iotelligem
enough to decide upon the sounduess
of any.
The President's party is as much op?
posed to his expressed views on the
currency question as it is in respect of
his civil service orders. On the former,
half the republicans in the U. S. House
of Representatives are not in accord
with him, and bis recent prophet in
that body, Mr. Grosvenor, of his own
State, says that on the latter, only one
member of his cabinet agrees with him.
When some sort of people fall out,
honest men ee' their du?s.
Notwithstanding the prevailing
ingoism, it is hardly probable that tb;s
country will be led into a foreign wer
even with such a weak nation as Spaiu
The plutocrats bought the election of
tho present administration, and as war,
even to the victors, is an unprofitable
business, it isn't likely that they will
permit one tobe brought on that would
endanger their pecuniary interests.
The heads of the ex Confederates in
Virginia are bowed in shame to-day.
Not only the commander of the Sons of
Veterans iu Richmond, bu: the grand
commander of the Confederate Veter?
ans of the State, have been charged
with accepting money from Northern
publishers, to secure the use of their
untruthful histories in the schools of
the State!
Intelligence from Richmond is to
the effect that some of the legislators
most instrumental in breaking up horse
racing at the race tracks in Alexandria
county, have lost all interest in the 1
matter of breaking up poolselliog and
bookinsking in that county. But the
ways of modern legislators, like those
of many other people, are past finding
out.
FROM WASHiiNliTOiN.
[Correspondence of tho Alexandria Gazette.]
Washinhton. Dac. 9.
Although no formal action has been
taken, a pretty general understanding
has been reached by the leaders in the
House of Representatives as to the
course of legislation in tbe Dear future.
Tbis contemplates the disposal of ap?
propriation bills as fast as they are
ready for consideration. After these,
the bankruptcy bill will be given the
fi st opportunity for a heariug. Tbis
measure will bo reported before tho
h diday recess, but it will not be taken
U > by the House uulil after the recess.
It is understood that Speaker Reed is
favorably disposed toward tbis bill. It
is equally well understood fiat for the
p tsent there will bb no effort to take
u.i financial legislation on the 11 ior of
t ir House. Tbis is due mainly to the
f ict that a sirong impression prevails'
among members of the House that the
cunmittee on banking arid currency
Will not be able to reconcile tie mauy
co. dieting interests inside the commit?
tee. The ways aud means committee
will ?io nothing at present in the \v?\
uf framing financial legislation. If,
however, it becomes eyident that the
committee on bunking and currency i^
at a Staudstil I, then the ways and nu-aus
committee will enter the tjelu of finan?
cial legislation, and will Irnin- a bill
Toe bankruptcy bill is substantially
similar to a bill which passed the House
once before. It is on the lines of the
old Torrey bill, providing, hotb volun?
tary ami involuntary bankruptcy. At
tbeaamu tirnw, the objections made to
the T >rr- y bill that ;; was a "collection
ageucy," Oave ^eeo overcome by a
gmootbing down of the haT-h feature?.
The Senate committee on census to?
day authorized Seuatur drier to
report favorably the bill introduced at
the last sessiou of Congress to provide
for the twelfth census and for subse?
quent censuses, "with an amendment

The Virginia contestees iu the House
were somewhat surprised this morning
at receiving no'.icis from the elections
committee to appear before it next
Tuesday, as they were informed yes
terday that theirs would be the last

ever, that the notices were tbe result
a mistake.

FIFTY-fT/TH CONGRESS.
Washington, Dec. 9.
benatk.
Mr. He ar presented a petition sign?
ed by 21,269 native Hawaiians pro?
testing against the annexation of
Hawai i.
Thrj Senate agreed to adjourn to day
uuti\ Monday next.
?'ir. McBride presented and asked
tbe immediate consideration of a joint
resolution for the relief of American
miners and other sufferers in the val?
ley of the Yukon and its tributaries.
The resolution authorizes the Secretary
of War to transport supplies to the suf?
fering miners and provides that not
more than $250,000 bu appropriated to
carry out the purposes of the resolution.
It went over on objection.
A resolution was offered by Mr.
Chaudler and referred to the commit
tse on naval affairs providing for an
investigation of the question of dry
docks aud naval slaions.
The resolution reported by the Pa?
cific Rulroad committee asking the
A torut-y General for information con?
cerning the Kansas Pacific was adopted.
Mr. Gallinger requested that at the
..conclusion ol tbe morniLg business au
hour b? set asid for the cons drraiion
of private pension bills, of which, he
said, there were over 200 on the calen?
dar endorsed by the committee. "I
want to sey," said be, "that there is a j
laxity amoue Senators about sendiDg
pension bills to our committee. No in?
quiry is nude by tharn as to tbe m^rit
of the measures. Senators should be j
aosoluu'iy satisfied of the merit of]
measures b-fore, introducing them. I
am SMti.-lied that in private pension
matters we have gone to the extreme
limit nnd tbatit is now time to call a
halt." Mr. Gallinger thought that the
practice of pensioning remarried wi
dows and several other similar classes
of claimants ought to be stopped.
Mr. (Jaliiuger said that be was opposed
to the granting of large pensions to
widows of distinguished oUicers. "We
huve reached tbe limit in that, regard,"
s rid he, ''and it is time that we should
stop."
The order r< quested by Mr. Gallinger
was then made.
Among thrj bills passed was one to
pay tbe Richmond Locomotive Works
its claim for damages and losses in?
curred in tbe construction of the battle?
ship Tex>is.
The Senate then began the consid?
eration of private pension bills.
Mr. Harris moved that his Pacific
Rtilroad resolution offered last spring
he recommitted to the Pacific Rttilroud
committee, on which there was a de?
bate.
HOUSE.
Representative Jerry Simpson, of
Kansas, was in his seat for tbe first
time this session. The House went in?
to committee of tbe whole, Mr. Payne,
of New York, iu the chair, for the con?
sideration of the pension appropria'ion
bill, which was reported yesterday.
Mr. W. A. Stone, in charge of the
bill, explained the different items.
Mr. Cannon said it might be that the
expenditures for pensions for 1S99
would exceed the estimates. The com?
missioner of pensions estimated the ex?
penditures at $14S,000,000. If he should
prove to be right, Mr. Caunon said, the
$140,000,000 appropriated by this bill
would pay all pensions for the first 11
moothsof thefiscal yearand a deficiency
appropriation could be made. He
solemnly warned tho House that the
large anticipatory importations would
keep toe revenues under the present
law down to the minimum aud be ap?
pealed to his colleagues to see to it
"that while the public service was suf
ficentiy supplied with money not one
dollar is appropriated which is not ab
solutely necessary to the best interests
of the public eervice."
Mr. Allen attacked Mr, Cannon's
statement in a speech in which there
were flashes of his inimitable humor
that set the House into a roar of laugh?
ter. He produced figures that show?
ed an estimated deficit for the next
year of $72,000.000. He referred to
the increase iu the pension roll under
the present administration and ridicul?
ed the idea of a decreise unless tbe late
increase was to be attributed to the exi?
gencies of the recent campaign in Oaio.
Mr. Allen directed the batteries of his
humor at the Dingley law as a revenue
producer, picturing the intense anxiety
of the chairman of the ways and meana
committee at the extra session to get a
bill on the statute books that would
strike a balance between tbe receipts
aGd expenditures, and predicting an?
other season of anxiety on Mr. Dingley's
part next t-pring at another eztra ses?
sion called for the same purpose.
In conclusion he ^poke of thw hard?
ships this great tax burden placed on
tbe people of the South who were, he
I said, being relentlessly burdened by
the gold standard and 4J cent cotton.

THE LEGISLATURE.
The General Assembly ye3terdaj
postponed tbe action of tbe county
j judges nominated in Tuesday night'i
caucus until the excessive criminni
charges in many of tbe counties can be
looked into. The delay may be foi
only a few days, or it may extend until
after the Christmas holidays. In the
Utter event the regnlar terms of the
judges, which are for six years from the
January succeeding their election, may
be somewhat interfered with. How?
ever, it was suggested in the discussion
of the subject that some way could be
found around this, or if not, that it
would bo better to elect the judges fji
six years and ten months at a proper
salary than to choose them in the regu?
lar way at improper salaries.
The Senate adopted a resolution to
elect judges, but when the question
came up in the House Mr. Parker
asked that the matter be pass d by
until certain questions could be looked
into. Mr. Parker outlined a general
plan for fixing a large portion of tbe
criminal expenses upon the counties
and cities He said there had been
considerable discussion as to the ad?
visability of settling the criminal ex?
penses ou the various counties instead
of the S ate treasury. This could only
be done, however, if these expenses
were materially reduced. A general
bill should be prepared, fixing the sal
aries of all judges and other salaried of?
ficers and have them charged to tbe
Stale in order that all other fluctuating
criminal expenses might be charged to
'he counties aud cities, so that they
could he carefully scruliuizrd by the
local authorities.

bill give to all planters who own one
hundred or more of contiguous oyster
grounds the right to use dredges, the
only part of the oyster waters excepted

The Bicycle Race.
New Yobk, Dec. 9.?The early hours
of the fourth day of the great six day
o.cycle race found eighteen men still
pedalling away. The motion of the
wheel is beginning to affect the riders'
braits and even in the snatches of sleep
which they allow themselves they im?
agine they are still jidiog. Miller
with more than lifty miles in the lead
of the second best man, insists upon
sticking to the track. Not only that,
but he spurts whenever any one offers
him the chance. He had slept just one
hour and six minutes in the first seven?
ty two hours of the race. Rivierre rode
1124 miles without a wink of sleep and
he then took two hours. Waller bad
slept three hours and Rice five hcurs.

with Rivierre and both riders fell. En
terman, Pierce, Moore and King were
riding in a close hunch and neither
could steer clear of the fallen men.
Pierca's wheel struck Schinneer and
he fell, carrying tbe others with him.
All of the riders were pretty badly
st aken up, but none of them was badly
hurt. Hale, it is claimed, is just begin?
ning to show his true form and will be
heard from at the finish.
The score of Miller, who was in the
lead at 2:15 o'clock this afternoon, was
1417 miles. The best previous record

certain members of the history commit?
tee of the Grand Camp of Confederate
Veterans, tbe history committee hav?
ing been selected to secure for the use
in the public schools of Virginia and
tbe South, a history fair to the south?
ern side of the civil war. This must
not be connected with a similar inves
tigatioo of a few weeks ago, when the
junior organization investigated tbe
conduct of one of its members. In
comparison with this, that was regard?
ed as but a side exhibition of tbe big
s-how. Tbe investigation committee is
composed of five prominent men from
as many quarters of the State, and the
charge they haYe to look into concern
men equ dly as prominent. Tbe com?
mittee held a preliminary session
yesterday at Murpby's Hotel. Gen.

tain O. B Morgan, Col. W. A. Smoot
and Judge Berryman Green were pres?
ent. Capt. Washington Taylor, of Nor?
folk, tbe fifth member of the commit?
tee, arrived later. There were present

who acted as secretary, and Majors Nor?
man V. Randolph and Thomas A.

a Hit of witnesses, whom Captain Ellett
has been instructed to summon. It is
understood that tbe committee yester?
day heard the charges that are made
principally against a high officer in tbe
Grand Camp of United Confederate
Veterans. To-day's investigation will
be made with open doors. Collusion
with a book company for tbe purpose of
keeping that company's books in Vir?
ginia schools is the character of
charge that will be brought, and a two
hundred dollar check, Faid to have been
given by an agent of the book company
to a member of tbe history committee,
will figure in tbe evidence. Other sen?
sations are promised.
