pression, President Points Out. j
WASHINGTON. Dec. 2 G neral recommendations on
legislation to combat the cost of living, labor unrest, radical
ianand a readjustment of thc nation to peace-time basis were
the features of President Wilson's annual message to congress
delivered today.
The peace treaty, the president told congress, will be dis
.ujsed in a separate message later, as will the railroad question.
For the second time, only, since the president established
j the practice of addressing congress in person, his message was
1 read today by the clerks.
Principal Recommendations,
The president's principal recommendations were:
Establishment of a budget system for the national finances.
Reorganization of the taxation system with simplification
of the income and excess profits.
I Readjustment of thc tariff system, if necessary, to meet
changes in the world situation and make the system conform
with the fact that the United States is "the greatest capitalist
in the world "
Aid for Veteran Soldiers.
Recognition and relief for veteran soldiers of the world
ar, particularly in the way of government farms as proposed
by Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the nation's industries built up
ay the war to keep the United States independent of foreign
wpply
I I An enlarged program for rural developmen I . in recognition
Ji the farmers' part in the war.
Measures which "will remove the causes" of "political
restlessness in our body politics."
Delay of Peace Cause of Unrest.
At this point the president made his most extensive ref-
'-fence to the peace treaty by saying the causes for the unrest
are superficial rather than deep-seated" and that "they result
j Tm. or ae connected with, the failure on the part of our gov
; ffnment to arrive speedily at a just and permanent peace,
permitting return to normal conditions, from the transfusion
I radical theories from seething European centers pending
I "ich delay, from heartless profiteers resulting from the m
1 v-rease of the cost of living, and lastly from the machinations
Jpf passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to
lrmal conditions this unrest will rapidly disappear."
I Oppoi,f violent Methods.

"The only way to keep mn from aci
t.iiinc .tKulnft irrleyaneea Is to remove
I the prlovanees." said tho president's
j mesjwge. At another point it declared
"the aeed of revolution is repression "
Way to Industrial Peace
"The establishment of thc principles re
KnrdlnK labor laid down In t ho covenant
of the league of nations." aald the mes
HM, "offers us the way to industrial
i kCC and conclllntion. So other road
lies open to us. Governments
must recoenfzc th right of men to bar
caln collectively for humane objects.
Iabor no longer must be treated as
a commodity.
"The right of individuals to strike Is
Inviolate." continues the message, "and
ought not to Im- interfered with by ny
process of government but there is a
pn lomlnant right and that Is the right
of the Kovorninent to protect all of if
people and to awsert its power and maj
esty against the challenge of any class."
The president was referring to th
O vanunan t'a iccent injunction apa ns.
thc coal strike.
Rucsla a Painful Object Lesson
TUj muMR' closed with a pointed fer-
1
erence to radicalism and red doctrines
nnd referred to "Kussln today with its
blood and terror" as a "painful object
lesson of the power of minorities."
"There are thOM In this country." said '
the mcsMifiV. "who threaten direct ic
tion to force their will upon a majority.
It mnkts little difference what a
minority it la. whether capital or labor,
or any other class; no sort of privilege
will ever be permitted to dominate this
country. 11
Orderly processes, thc message declared.
were the only ones by which relief and 1
reform could be obtained.
"Those who would propose any othr
methods of reform are enemies of this
country." the message said " "Let those .
beware who take the shorter road to
dlsordei and revolution."
Tho following Is the text of Presi
dent Wll?0n's message to congress:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives :
I sincerely regreat that I cannot bo
present at the opening of this session
of the congress I am thus prevented
iroro presenting in as direct a way as
I could wish the many questions that
f.re pressing for solution at this time.
Happily, 1 h;.c had the advantage of!
the advice of the heads of the several I
executive departments who have kepi
in close touch with affairs in their de
tail and whose thoughtful reconimend
a tlons I earnestly second.
In (he matter of thc railroads and I
the readjustment of their affairs grow
ing out of federal control, I shall take
the liberty at a later day of addressing
you,
Favorc Budget System.
I hope that congress will bring to a
conclusion ;.i this session legislation
lookinc to the establishment of a
btld gel system. That there should be
one single authority responsible for
the making of all appropriations and
that appropriations should be made not
independently of each other, but with
reference to one single comprehensive
plan ol expenditure properly related to
the nation s income, there can be no
doubt. 1 believe the burden of prepar
ing the budget must, in the nature of
the case, if the work is to be properly
done and responsibility concentrated
instead of diwded. rest upon the execu
tive. The budget so prepared should ;
be submitted to and approved, or
amended by a single committee of;
each house of congress and no Single
appropriation should be made b the
congress, except, such as may have
bet n in luded in the budget prepared
by the executive, or added by the par
tlcular committee of congress charped
with the budget legislation. j
Future Taxation Problems.
I trust that the congress will give its
Immediate consideration to the prob-j
lem of future taxation. Simplification
of the income and protits taxes nas
become an immediate necessity. These
taxes performed Indispensable service
during the war Th must, howtver, i
L. limifllfied, not only to sae the tax
payer Inconvenience and expense but
in order that his liability may be made
certain and definite.
With reference to the details of the
revenue Law. the secretary of the i
treasury and the commissioner of in-:
tenia revenue will lay before you fori
your consideration certain amend-'
ments necessary, or desirable, in con
nection with the administration oi the;
law recommendations wbic hhavo my!
approval and support. It is of the ut-1
most importance thai in dealing with
this matter the present law should not
be disturbed so far as regards taxes,
for the calendar ear 1920 payable in'
the calendar year 1921 The congress
uiulit well consider whether the Meti
er rate of income and ; profits' taxes
can in peace limes be effectively pro
ductive of revenue and whether they
may not. on the contrary, be destruc
tive of business activity and produc-,
tive of waste and inefficiency. There
is a point at which in peace times1
high rates of income and profits taxes
discourage energy, remove the incen
tive to new enterprise, encourage ex I
travaganl expenditures and produce in
dustrial stagnation with consequent!
unemployment and other attendant
evils.
Problem Is Difficult.
The problem is not an easy one. A'
fundamental change has taken place
with reference to the position of Amer
ica in the world's affairs. The preju
dice and passions engendered by de
cades of controversy between two
schools of political thought the one
believers in protection of American In-1
d US tries, the other believers in tariff i
for revenue only must be subordinat
ed to the single consideration of tho i
public Interest in the light of u'terlj

Military Campaign On a
Large Scale May Be

TOKIO, Friday. Nov. 2S. (By the1
Associated Press.) Tli" eastward
march oi Bolshevik forces in Siberia
has developed a suddenly serious,
problem for Japan, which Is pravely
occupying official cir'!,s and which
will probably ..soon be djBCUSSSd with
the American government. The con
ontlon by w hich I he alio s have op
erated in eastern Siberia may bei
menaced by the Bolsheviki and the in
terests oi law ; nd order In China, Man
churia and the Russian Pacific littoral
may necessitate ;t military compaign
on a large scale. Japan apparently
has no wish to attack (he problem
single handed, and the impression pre
vails sh.- Will discuss eery step with
the American government and may re j
quest moral, financial and even mili
tary support.
Miliough 1 onic n w spippis continue
to talk about misunderstandings be-:
tween Japan and America, the Im
pression is steadily growing here that;
the people who are actually conduct-)
ing the affairs of the empire will seek j
not only to cement the friendship be-i
tween the two countries, but to co-op-:
crate wllh America in the widest
sense in the solution of all far east
ern problems. For the moment the
greatest problem is Bolshevism. The
first public note sounded for the ne

DEATH IS MYSTERY I
Crime Recalls Visit of H
Strange Woman to l
Ogden Homes.
ogdon today Is being combed for
: clues that mas assist the authorities ,
of Lawton. Mich., to solve the mystery ,
surrounding the finding In a trunk of
the remalnr. of a woman, believed to
be Miss Maud Tnhor formerly a
teacher of Latin in the ()?:den Hi?h i
ji
Walter Tabor, a brother of the mur
dered girl, is believed to br in th
vicinity of Ogd. n. A message to The
Standard from the Chicago American
j says this brother is supposed to be in
or near Ogden.
Walter Tabor and the mother, or
stop-mother, of the murdered teacher
are wanted by the authorities of Law
ion with a vkv. to getting a possible
explanation as to the trunk mystery.
Tho trunk in which the body was
found was concealed beneath a pile ot
i rubbish in thc Lawton family honor
.basement. Peath seemingly occurred 1
several months agO. ;. I
Goes to Spokane.
Inquiry' in Ogden today disclosed
thai ihe Las I Information received by
friends here came from Miss Tabor In
1915 when ii was learned that a
promised position In Spokane had been
i ifused her because of her app. aranc
due to ill health.
But a possible clue has been ob
talned in 'be discovery that the slstei
r.f Maud Tabor, Who lound the bod)
..ml who Is hoincr- held for turt h-i
questioning at Lawton was in Ogden in
the summer of 1918.
l'n. ads of Maud Tabor, who mei
this woman, declare that her talk, ac H
tlons and appearance led ihem to be
! lleve she was not nun. ally normal.
Strange Woman Here.
This woman, who is believed to b
the Mrs Florence Tabor Critchlocs
mentioned In prss dispatches, callei
upon Mrs J. L. Webster, superintend
ent of tho Bather home. She told Mrs
Webstei that she was walking fron
Chicago to San Francisco.
ThK woman met othtr friends of th
former Latin teacher but her appear
ance and actions were so unpr- pn
esMnn tha' i'fw . m.-.I to talk with
her lone cnouuh to inquire as to tht
. . ahouts of Maud Tabor.
Vwiether the woman was mentally
deranged and this subnormal condi
lion has had anything to do with ttu
deatb ol ihc teacher is a question thai
has not been cleared up. The an
nouncement that this Mrs. Critcblow
was held tor further examination fol
lowing her refusal to answer questions
sopnis to indicatp that she may be abU
to "i furnish Information as U
the death. I
Active In Church.
When Miss Tnbor came to Ogden at
a teacher, she became an active mem
ber of the Baptist church and at th
'time of her departure was church
treasurer. H
Mrs John Y Hobbs. 2269 Adams
avenue, was intimately associated wltfe
Mi88 Tabor in church work. Mrs
Hobbs said today the church had sent
'a message to Miss Tabor's home al
; Lawton every year at Christmas time
but had never received a reply.
"Her ihappearance seemed strange
to us," Mrs. Hobbs said. "She was
such a faithful worker while here and
I was so interested that we considered
' it strange she never wrote after she
left Ogden."
Murdered Months Ago.
Authorities of Lawton are working
ion the supposition that Miss Tabor
w-as murdered several months ago.
There is a theory that the murder
I took place in the west and the body
was sent east to be hidden.
