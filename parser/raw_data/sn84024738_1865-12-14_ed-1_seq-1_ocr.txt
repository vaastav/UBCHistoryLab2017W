! SOUTHERN REWII«ENTATfON~THE I.A
--1 TEXT NEW* PROW WASHINGTON. j
We had prepared tor yesterday's paper■ an
interesting return* of the opinions and specujla-
I tiona current in Washington city on this, shb
i jut, but the article waa unfortunately omit
ted. We allude to it now merely>as affording
us a reason for stating to-day thai* Senator
Doolittle, of Wisconsin ; Hon. H. J. Ray
mond, of New York city, Mr. Seward's right
hand man, and Horace Greeley, all of them
great lights of the Republican party, seen, to
jbe strongly disposed to .sustain the President
In his reconstruction policy, and that the
Conservatives are flushed with the hope that
the consequence must be either the admission
of the .Southern members who can take the
> oath or & disruption of the Radical party ;
I for it is certain that such men must control
, many of less note.
Below we give all the paragraphs from Our
latest which are calculated to
1 throw any light upon the question. *|he
i Baltimore SriSa correspondence contains the
following :
I "The Thaddeus Stevens resolution pro
scribing eleven States of the Union from rtnv
participation in the affairs of the Union for
ian indefinite period of time met with vigor
ous opposition to-day in the Senate upon the
proposition to amend the same, as agreed upon
<in caucus, so as to prevent the exclusion of
representatives from such States. Senator Poo
little argued that the passage of the resolu
-1 tion would accomplish what th«* people of tho
, eleven late insurgent Suites, with an immense
sacrifice of life, had failed to do—to dissolve
| the Union. The resolution was so amended as
|to leave each body at any time to admit mem
bers from any States not now represented.
, " Whether the recent victory of the Con
servatives in the Senate caucus" shall turn to
r 'Dead Sea fruits' depends upon their own
course. They might be wise as serpents and
harmless as doves. Under the last Adminis
tration, to sat' aught against its acts was trea
son, more or less. But now men of the worst
stamp in Congress must be tolerated in the
most violent concerted schemes against An-'
drew Johnson. But imperturable and persist
ent advocacy of right and reason must pre
vail. Such, doubtless, will be the President's
course. The slow and sure, in time, get on.
The stake is too great for Intemperate action.
Good men must be hopeful and firm.
*• The Senate passed to-day the House joint
j resolution for a committee of fifteen on recon
-1 struction, just as it was agreed on in the Sena
torial caucus on yesterday, and published in
i the Sun this morning. All of the Democratic
Senators voted against it, as well as two Re
! publicans, Messrs. Dixon, of Connecticut, and
Doolittle, of Wisconsin. The latter, in a speech
of considerable force, said the original House
j resolution proposed to dissolve the Union by
law. The indications are decided that the
i House will accept the modification of their
i resolution as agreed on in the Senate/
Tb* National Intelligencer says: "The action
of Congress yesterday is of much interest,
Mai its indications are rather hopeful that the j
I sturdy blows aimed by Mr. Stevens against
the President's policy will, in their reaction, i
! prove useful in the accomplishment of the pa- j
] triotic purposes of the Executive. The speech
of Senator Doolittle is full of force and digni- '
ty. It marches tip to the points with power, ;
moderation and decision. It vindicates the
President and his policy in a manner worthy
Of the theme. The portrait which the honor- j
able Senator draws of the rigid political lea
tunas of the Honorable Thaddeus Stevens is so
true to the life that the best friends of that
distinguished gentleman cannot be offended at
the likeness.
" In the House it is gratifying to note that !
the chains of caucus are slacking, if not break- i
ing. Hon. Henry J. Raymond expressed him- '
sehf —jail personally in favor of referring ereden- j
tiaaa to the Committee am Elections; but that,!
"out of deference to the views of members,
he would move their reference to the Select <
Committee on the subject of the so-called Con
federate States.'' The subsequent action of
the House, under the previous question, how
ever, indicates conclusively that the " Select j
Committee " is the pet of the majority; and
yet we are not without hope, from the indica
tions named, that the fair and open thing will
prevail in some form."
The Chronicle, Mr. Forney's paper, gives
signs that it foresees the result desired by '
the Conservatives. It says :
"We note these manifestations as bearing |
particularly upon the question of restoration, j
and as appropriate responses to the spirit of i
the President's message, who gracefully re- j
ferred to Congress the whole controversy in- j
volved in these particular applications for
seats in the National Legislature. That there |
is a strong prevailing anxiety to see good and j
true men from the South in Congress, it did j
not need these indications to prove."
f.eortcia.
Milledokvii.i.e, Ga., December 11.—The
Senate has passed a bill regulating contracts
between master anil servant. If for over one
mouth it must be in writing ; work hours to j
be from sunrise to sunset, and servants to be .
responsible for damaging the muster's proper- j
ly ; wages forfeited by leaving before expira
tion of contract. The employer may discharge
for disobedience, drunkenness, immorality,
want of respect, or for leaving service ; en- ;
titiug servants away, misdemeanors to be
punishable with a fine of $*», or imprisonment
foe four months. j
The House refused to consider the resolution
fixing a day for the election of United States
Senators by a vote of ninety to fifty-six.
Provisional Governor Johnson sent a tele
gram. la*t night to Washington, asking to be j
relieved, and asking that the Governor elect, ;
Jenkins, be allowed to take his office.
Flock to Rio Ds Janeiro.—We learn from
the New Orleans timtt that a vessel is on the
way from Rio de Janeiro to that city with a
cargo of cofl'ee. The arrival of such a cargo
will remind the people of the Crescent City,
says that paper, of the former prosperity of 1
their city. From the year 1535 to«he year
ls«o the imports of coffee direct from Kio into j
New Orleans were two million one hundred
! aud fifteen thousand six hundred^,nd ninety
seven sacks, or three hundred and fifty-two j
thousand six hundred and sixteen sacks per
! annum, reaching in the year IM7 four hun
dred and twenty-seven thousand three hun
shred and twenty-three. This would be worth, i
adds the Timet*, to the trade of New Orleans, j
"at this time, taking th«* average quantity as a
• standard, twenty-one cents per pound, in gold, I
'or nearly twelve millions of dollars. The Haass '
1 hopes that a cargo of Hour will be in readiness
for the coffee ship, with which to return at. I
; once. . j
i The Rio people prefer Richmond flonr to any j
i other, and we hope soon to hear of a cargo of J
j coffee on its way to this city, to be exchanged j
for our flonr. It would serve as a reminder, '
\ here too, of the profitable trade formerly car- I
: ried on between Richmond and Rio.
Choi hka Abati.m*.—The State Department
has received a very able communication from ,
! Mr. Alexander W. Thayer, United-States Con- j
i sul at Trieste, dated November IS, ls«.i, iv '
| which he states that the Central Sanitary !
( Commission of that city had voted to report j
i it as their unanimous opinion that the disease .
, did not exist in an epidemic form. Mr. Thayer
! states that, since the 2Sd of October, although I
! the number of cases have Increased, they do i
i not average three per day, and that no fears j
j need be entertained that the cholera will be I
iin trod need into the United States .from j
Trieste.
During the war, a gentleman, from near
j Fredericksburg, purchased a farm in Chester
field county for $25,000 in Confederate money.
> He has recently made some observations as to
j the character of the land, aud discovered coal.
1 He has since been offered $20,000 in greenbacks |
1 for his farm, but refused to take the amount i
. unless paid in gold.
The New York Tribune finds in the fre- i
Siueney of railroad massacres a justification

Washixoton, December 12.—The general <
gossip in, that the co-operative movement in
t»oth branches of Congress yesterday respect
ing the Maximilian power in Mexico por
t«a4a the gathering of a war cloud. Those
who have been looking for a speedy aceonuno
dation of the condition of the country to a stable i
peace basis have become nervously excited,
the existing reticence of the Government only
serving to produce gloomy imaginings.— Sun.
POST-OFFICE AFFAIRS.
The Postmaster-General has ordered the
following: At Old Point Comfort, Va., ap

THE SUPREME COURT TEST OATH.
Mr. Garland, of Arkansas, formerly a mem
hear of the Supreme Court, moved the' Court to
restore him to practice without taking the re
quired oath, that he did not wilfully give aid j
and comfort to the rebellion. The Conrt holds
the matter under advisement. [Our previous
reports of this case, it will be remembered,
state that Mr. Garland would argue the
question on the loth instant, and test the con- !
stitutionality of the oath requirement.]
THE PUBLIC PRIXTIXO.
An Idea of the large amount of printing and J

East Tennessee—lts Condition and Prospect*.
Knoxvh.lk, Tennessee, November 80, 1855.—
I came to this place a day or two ago, believing i
that the reports of East Tennessee lawlessness, ■
of which many papers say so much, were true,
tutd that I should be necessitated to see at least
a half-dozen grey-haired rebels butchered by
the young loyalists of this part of the State.
In fact, I thought at least, in order to preserve
my own life, to wear ray brass buttons and
shoulder-straps. When I arrived at Knoxville
I expected to have been met by a parcel of loy- !
al ruffians, and to have been compelled to show j
my passport, countersigned by Governor
Brownlow and approved by Andy Johnson.
In this expectation I was disappointed. The
truth is, 1 was rather chagrined at thecarele»s
treatment shown me. I did not see loaded pis
tols, nor did I hear of a do/en or two murders, i
as I did when I arrived at Nashville. Nobody
attempted to steal my pocket-book, nobody
asked me to have a hack ; in truth, 1 was left
"alone in my glory" to find my way to the
best hotel in the city, if possible. I am now
convinced that there is more of peace and gui- I
etude here than there is in Kentucky, and few
er robberies and murders than there is in any i
one of the loyal States. 1 have traveled in a !
buggy, behind a splendid horse, all over An
deraon, Roane. Morgan, Cumberland and Knox I
counties, and never once had my horse locked
up in a stable. j

Nbgbo Schools in Richmond.—The Rev. ,
Mr. Clayton, on last Sunday, delivered a dis- ;
course upon freed men in a Universalist !
Church in New York city. The Tribune saya
of it:
"He described the different schools in Rich
mond, Norfolk, Hampton. Alexandria and
Washington, and read the reports of their
principals, with such remarks as were append
ed by the superintendent, which showed '•■
them" to be in a most satisfactory condition, !
under the direction of Miss White and Miss
Howe.
" One in particular, held in the Old African j
Church of Richmond, had seven hundred day j
scholars ; an evening school was attached for
the older and more advanced scholars ; a sort j
of high school, under the direction of Miss
Hancock, for preparation of colored teachers.
Miss Hancock has two assistants (colored),
aged twelve and fifteen respectively. The
school was entirely self-sustdining, the teach
ing being gratuitous.
" General Howard had promised that no
distinction should be made in regard to the
peculiar belief of the teachers, but that they i
should be given every assistance in his power. !
" At the conclusion, a very generous contri- ]
bit tion was taken up."
Mr. Clayton also stated that the Govern
meat was now doing nothing to sustain these
schools. _ j
Tho Young Men's Christian Association of |
Cincinnati has established a workingiuen's !
coffee-room, which would seem to be an insti- !
tv tion capable of accomplishing much practi- j
cal good. The Vouitntrciul says of it: "In the j
heart of a manufacturing district of the city is j
located an institution, to which, utjauy hour of j
the day, up to ten o'clock at night, the tired
mechanic may repair—enjoy, for the nominal l
price of ten cents, a cup of excellent coffee and i
a dish of good vegetable and meat soup, with J
the best of crackers, smoke his pipe or cigar, |
read the news of the day, converse with his I
fellow-workmen, or pass an hour at a game of <
dominoes, chess or draughts."'
Rosin._An Immense amount of produce of
almost every description is now awaiting
transportation to New Berne. We thiuk we
apeak within bounds when we say that three
hundred thousand 'barrels of rosin alone is
now, or very soon will be, ready for trauapor
tation.—.Vt-io Heme Timet .
A recent Parisian buu mot attributed to M.
Drouyu de I'Huys is the definition ol a meant
as" a man who knows all that the worst
doaen' t know, and who doesn't know what all
the world kuows."
Operation* of the Mint.—From the report j
Of the Director of the United States Mint, j
Philadelphia, we learif that the amount of |
bullion, in value, received at the Mint and
branches during the fiscal year was as follows:
Gold, fcU.O6.-.,fi49.74 ; silver, •1 1 183,405.£.; to
ral deposits. *«,245,7'.4.P7. From the profits of !
the bronze and nickel coinage, the Mint has !
transfrrred to the Treasury of the United I
States, during the fiscal year, #400,000, and a;
few weeks af tar the expiration of the year the
farther sum of #400,000 was in like manner J
transferred, the fund remaining being sufficient !
for all the purposes of the coinage. It is sug
gested that from this nickel alloy a five-cent
coin conld easily be made, and which would be
a popular substitute for the five-cent note. i
The Director of the Mint has been author- |
ized by the Secretary of the Treasury to place
upon all the gold and silver coinsof the United !
States, susceptible of .such addition, hereafter
to be issued, the motto, '• In Ood we trust.'"
It is expected that before the close of this ca
lender year the gold and silver coins of the
Mint of the United States will have impressed '
upon them, by national authority, the distinct
and unVqnivocal recognition of the sovereignty I
of God, and the nation's trust in him. j
Export Dity on Cotton.--Mr. Bingham's
joint resolutions proposing to amend the Con- j
stitution for the purpose of authorizing an J
export tax on cotton and other Southern pro
ducts will be powerfully supported. Tho '
Philadelphia Pre** thinks that the Southern j
people will not object to this tax. It says :
"The idea that any opposition to this amend- \
ment of the Constitution should come from
the South is absurd, when we recollect that in
the Constitution of the so-called 'Confederate
States ' precisely this privilege was reserved 1
as a measure of self-pro tec tion and self-de
fence. It was, Indeed, the necessary prepara
tion for the South, had they succeeded in win- I
ning their independence, for that system of i
manufacturing, without which, according to
Governor Orr and other sensible authorities,
they are now so immeasurably suffering." !
Undoubtedly the Cotton States will oppose
the measure. They wish to supply the world !
witlrcotton, and thereby recover some portion,
at least, of the immense wealth they formerly j
enjoyed..
Robbery of the Washington City Post- !
office.—About three months since the loss of
small sums of money from the city post-office
Was noticed by Postmaster Bowen. Decoy
letters were placed in the way of one of the
letter-carriers who was suspected of abstract- i
ing letters. Upon being detected, the young
man, I*. R. Bull, made a confession, in which
he stated that he had opened about twenty i
letters addressed to persons on his route : that '
he had been doing this between three and four
months ; that he had sealed up and delivered I
or returned to the post-office all of said letters,
excepting one, which contained live dollars ;
that he opened a letter since, containing sixty
tWO dollars : and that he also opened a letter
about the same time of the last, which con
tamed sixty-Six dollars; but on suspicion that
it was a decoy, sealed it up again and deli
vered it.
Bull is suspended from duty, his bond being
retained, aud the matter is referred to the De
predation Branch of the Post-ollice Depart
ment. The depredator is unmarried. There
is reason to believe that the above confession
covers but a small portion of the losses stated

Riot Between Soldiers and Nxaaoss in
Washington.—Saturday night a row occurred
at a house occupied by several colored fami
lies, which resulted in seriously wounding se
veral of the colored inmates and several sol
diers. It is alleged that a sergeant of the
Fifth cavalry went to the house and behaved
outrageously, beating the inmates, and finally
struck a woman, whose husband turned upon
the sergeant, who was very badly beaten and
put out of the house, lie went" to" his camp !
and made a statement, upon which a guard
was sent to the house, and some of the negroes
were arrested and taken to the camp. Subse
qnently another party of the cavalry, armed
with carbines, got out of camp and went to
the house and attacked the inmates, heating
and abusing them, arresting some and shoot- !
ing at others. Several of the colored party |
were badly cut. and one soldier severely in
jured. Five soldiers and live negroes were i
arrested. .lustice Drury turned the soldiers
over to their officers, upon the demand of Ma
jmr Graham, and discharged the negroes.—Star. !
Emerson Etui-ridge.— Emerson Etheridge
is in Washington, it is said, doing bis utter
most to weaken the case of the Tennessee
claimants to seats in the Congress of the Uni
ted States. Notwithstanding this, however, I
the feeling in favor of these excellent men j
continues to increase among the Republican
members. |
So says the Philadelphia Press. It means, !
we suppose, that Mr. Etheridge, by advoca- i
ting, '-is weakening the case" of the members
from his State, he being very unpopular with !
the Radicals. *>
. uu
The Smai.i.-Pox Among the Negroes in ■
Washington City.—Sergeant Johnson reports
that the small pox is spreading very rapidly ■
among the colored people near Lhe northern
boundary, and that their conduct is calculated
to spread it through the city. ('olored men and
women who are literally covered with pus- !
tales are seen walking about the streets and
mingling with others. This morning he had
to prevent two from getting in the cars who
were iv that condition.— Star.
New Stamped Envelopes.—The Post-office ;
Department is now prepared to furnish
stamped envelopes of the denominations of
nine, twelve, eighteen, twenty-lour, thirty
and forty cents. These envelopes are specially
designed for the use of express companies and
others who carry mail matter outside of the
mails, the postal laws forbidding such matter
to be so carried unless the same be enclosed in
Government stamped envelopes of a denomi
nation sufficient to cover the postage thereon.
Thk Esivive'oj Arms in the Department of j
Virginia.—By direction of Major-General
Terry, commanding the Department of Vir
ginia, district commanders are ordered not to '
issue arms to police or military organizations
raided under the State authorities. If any
arms have been so issued they will be re
claimed. AU surplus ordnance property will
be forwarded to the arsenal at Fortress Mon
roe with the least possible delay.
A Liberal Contribition.—East Monday, j
General Spinner, United States Treasurer, re- !
ceived a contribution from a beggmr, amount- i
ing to one cent, which he tendered as his con
tribution towards cancelling the national debt.
The donation has been accepted and trans
ferred to the Treasury, passing through the
same channels and forms as would a more
munificent sum.
New York Bank-Not.* Company.—The Se
cretary of the Treasury has taken initiatory '
steps toward solving the naystery enveloping
the National Bank-Note Company of New
York, which, as we have stated heretofore,
prepared tome of the plates of the Confederate
notes.
. —
Am for the Sotth.—A meeting was held in
Brooklyn, N. V., last Monday evening, at
which nine thousand three hundred dollars
were subscribed for the purpose of " extending
pecuniary aid to the suffering people of the
late rebellious States of the South."

Arrival of a Lot of Wheat for the Expe
rimental Gardens.—Commissioner Newton

week ending December Mh the Comptroller of
the Currency issued •S,StM,B2B of national bank
currency. The total amount now in circula
tion is ♦224,W4,57f1.
It is computed that something like sixty
thousand vehicles come into London city every
day, aud to receive them there are barely oue j
hundred thoroughfares tn which two car
riages can pass each other, and in only about j
two-thirds of these can more lines find space. '

Br2 For Diseases which arise from the Stomach
and Bowels, RAKER'S PREMIUM HITTERS are
peculiarly adapted, while in the incipient stages
of BILIOUSNESS, NERVOUSNESS, COUGHS and
COLDS, they are superior to all other remedies.
The fact that a> single bottle has eared ague and
feverof *ix months' standing, and relieved nervfms
headache which had resisted all soils of remedies
for years, are prooa sullicient that they possess
healing virtues rarely found in medicinal prepa
