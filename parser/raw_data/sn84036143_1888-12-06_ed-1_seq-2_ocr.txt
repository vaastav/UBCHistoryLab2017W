To the Congress of the United States:
As you assemble for the discharge of the
duties you have assumed as the representa
tives of a free and generous people, your
meeting is marked by an interesting and
impresssive incident. With the expiration
of the present session of Congress the first
century of our continental existance as a
nation will be completed.
Our survival for one hundred years is
not sufficient to assure us that we no longer
have dangers to fear in the maintainance
with all its promised blessings of a govern
ment founded upon the freedom of the peo
ple. The time rather admonishes us to
soberly inquire whether in the past we
have always closely kept in the course of
safety and whether we have before us a
way plain and clear which
leads to happiness and prosperity.
The citizen of onr Republic in its early
days rigidly united upon a full compliance
with the letter of this bend and saw
stretching out before him a clear field for
his individual endeavors. H;s tribute to
the support of his government was meas
ured by the cost of it.
When the experiment of our Government
was undertaken, the chart adopted for our
guidance was the constitution. Dejiarture
from the lines there laid down is a failure.
It is only by a strict adherence to the di
rections they indicated and by restraint
within limitations they fixed that we can
furnish proof of the work of the fitness of
the American people for self government.
TOO MUCH PROSPERITY.
We discover that the fortunes realized by
our manufacturers are no longer realized as
the reward of sturdy industry and en
lightened foresight, but that they result
from the discriminating favor of the gov
ernment and are largely built up on un
due exactions from the masses of our peo
ple. The gulf between the employers and
the employed is constantly widening and
classes are constantly forming, one com
prising the very rich and powerful, while
in the other are lound the toiling poor.
As we view the achievement of aggre
gated capital we disc jver the existence of
trusts, combinations and monopolies, while
the citizen is struggling far in the rear or
is trampled to death beneath an iron heel.
Corporations, which should be cartully re
strained, creatures of the law and the
servants of the people, are fast becoming
the people's masters.
Still congratulating ourselves on the
wealth and prosperity of our country and
complacently contemplating every incident
of change inseparable from these con
ditions, it is our duty as patriotic
citizens to inquire of onr progress how
the bond of the government made with the
people has been kept and performed. In
stead of limiting the tribute drawn from
our citizens to the necessities of its eco
nomical administration, the government
persists in exacting from the substance of
the people millions which are unapplied
and useless and lie dormant in the treas
ury. This flagrant injustice and this
breach of faith and obligation add to ex
tortion the danger attending the diversion
of the currency of the country from the
legitimate channels of business.
Under the same laws by which these
laws are produced, the government per
mits many millions more to be added to
the cost of living of our people, and to be
taken from our consumers, which unreas
onably swell the profits of a small but
powerful minority. The people must still
be taxed for the support of the govern
ment under the operation of tariff laws,
but to the extent that the mass of our citi
zens are inordinately burdened beyond any
useful public purpose, and for the benefit
of a favored few, the government, under
pretext of an exercise of its taxing power,
enters gratiutously into partnership with
these favorites to their advantage and to
the injury of a vast majority of our people.
This is not equality before the law. The
exciting situation is injurious to the health
of our entire body. It stifles all
patriotic love of country, and substitutes in
its place selfish greed and grasping avarice.
squinting at free trade.
* Our workingmen, enfranchised from all
delusions and no longer frightened by the
cry that their wages are endangered by a
just revision of the tariff laws, will reason
ably demand through such revision steadier
employment, cheaper means of living in
their homes, freedom for themselves and
their children from the doom of perpetual
servitude, and an open door to their ad
vancement beyond the limits of a laboring
class. Others' of our citizens, whose com
fort and expenditures are measured by
moderate salaries and fixed incomes,
will insist upon the fairness and justice ot
cheapening the cost of necessaries for them
selves and their families.
When to the selfishness of the beneficia
ries of unjust discrimination under our
laws there shall be added the discontent
of thoee who suffer from such discrimina
tion, we will realize the fact that the
bénéficient purposes of our government,
dependent upon the patriotism and con
tentment of our people, are endangered.
Communism is a hateful thing and a
menace to the peace of organized gov
ernment. Bnt the communism of com
bined wealth and capital, the outgrowth
of over-weening cupidity and selfishness
which insidiously undermines the justice
and integrity of free institutions, is not less
dangerous than the communism and op
pressed poverty and toil which, exaspera
ted by injustice and discontent, attack
with wild disorder the citadel of rule.
The existing evil and inj ustice should be
honestly recognized, boldly met and effec
tively remedied. There should be no ces
sation of the struggle until a plan is per
fected, fair and conservative, toward exist
ing industries, but which will reduce the
cost to consumers of the necessaries of life,
while it provides for our manufacturers the
advantage of free raw materials and per
mits no injury to the interests of American
labor. The cause for which the battle is
waged is comprised within lines clearly
defined. It should never be compro
mised It is the people's cause.
SURPLUS REVENUE—HOW TO REDUCE IT.
The necessity of the reduction of onr rev
enue is so apparent as to lie generally con
ceded. but the means by
shall lie accomplished, aud the sum of di
rect lienefit. which results to the citizens,
present a controversy of utmost impirtance.
There should be no scheme accepted as sat
isfactory by which the burdens of the peo
ple are only apparently removed. Extrav
agant appropriations of the public money
with pll their demoralizing consequences
should not lie tolerated either as a means
I of relieving the Treasury of the present sur
plus. or as furnishing a pretext for resisting
a proper reduction in taritf rates.
ABOUT PENSION LAWS.
A revision of the pension laws could be
easily made which would rest on just prin
ciples and provide for every worthy appli
cant. but while general }»ensiou laws re
main confused and imperfect, hundreds of
private pension laws are annually passed
which are the sources of unjust discrimina
tion and popular demoralization.
THE INDIAN PROBLEM.
j
which this end
A plan in aid of Indian management is
recommended by those well informed as j
containing valuable features in further
ance of the solution of the Indian problem,
which has thus far tailed of legislative
sanction, while grants of doubtful ex
pediency to railroad companies, permitting
them to pass through Indian reservations,
have greatly multiplied.
AS TO PUBLIC LANDS.
Repeated recommendations have been
submitted for the amendment and change
of the laws relating to our public lands so
that their spoliation and diversion to other
uses than for homes of honest settlers
might be prevented, while a measure to
meet this conceded necessity reform
remains awaiting the action of Congress.
Many claims to the public lands and appli
cations for their donation n favor of States
and individuals have been allowed.
THE FISHERIES QUESTION.
International questions which still await
settlement are all reasonably within the
domain of amicable negotiation and there
is no exciting subject of dispute between
the United .states and any foreign power
that is not susceptible of satisfactory ad
justment by frank diplomatic treatment.
The questions between Great Britain aud
the United States relating to the rights of
American fishermen under the treaty and
international comity in the territorial
waters of Canada and New Foundland, I
regret to say. are not satisfactorily adjusted.
These matters were fully treated in my
message to the Senate of February 20,1888,
together with which a convention con
cluded under my authority with Her
Majesty's government on the 15tn of Feb
ruary last lor the removal of all causes of
misunderstanding was submitted by
me for the approval of the Senate.
This treaty having been rejected by the
Senate, I transmitted a message to Con
gress on the 23d of August last, reviewing
the transactions and submitting for con
sideration certain recommendations for
legislation concerning the important qnes- !
rions involved. Atterward, on the 12th of
September, in response to a resolution of
the Senate, I again communicated fully all
the information in my possession, as to the
action of the government of Canada affect
ing the relations between the Dominion
and the United States.
Having essayed in the discharge of my
duty to secure by negotiation the settle
ment of a long-standiug cause of dispute and
to remove a constant menace to good rela- j
tions of the two countries, and continuing i
to lie of the opiion that the treaty of Fel>
ruary last, which failed to receive the ap- ,
proval of the Senate, did supply a satisfac- j
tory, practical and final adjustment upon a j
basis honorable and just to both parties of j
the difficult and vexed question to which it
related, and having subsequently and un
availingly recommended other legislation to
Congress which I hoped would suffice
to meet the exigency created by the re
jection of the treaty. I now again invoke
the earnest and immedia'e attention of
Congress to the condition of this important
question as it now stands before them and
the country, and for the settlement of
which I am deeply solicitous.
DIMISSAL OF MINISTER WEST.
The close of the month of October last,
occurrences of a deeply regretable nature
were brought to my knowledge which
made it my painful but imperative duty
to obtain, with as little delay as possible,
a new personal channel of diplomatic in
tercourse in this country with the govern
ment of Great Britain.
The correspondence in relation to this
incident will, in due course, be laid before
yon, and will disclose the unpardonable
conduct of the official referred to in his in
terference, by advice and counsel, with the
snfferages of American citizens in the very
crisis of the presidential election, then
near at hand. Also his subsequent public
declarations to justify his action, supper
adding impugnment of the Executive and
Senate of the United States in connection
with important questions now pending
in controversy between the two governments.
The offense thus committed was most
grave, involving disastrous possibilities to
the good relations of the United States and
Great Britain, constituting a gross breach
of the diplomatic privilege and invasion
of the purely domestic affairs and essential
sovereignty of the government to which
the envoy was accredited. Having first
fulfilled the just demands of international
courtesy by affording a full opportunity
for Her Majesty's governtment to act in |
relief of the situation. I considered pro- j
longation of the discussion unwarranted i
and therefore declined to further recog- j
nize the diplomatic character of the
person whose continuance in such functions
would destroy that mutual confidence
which is essential io the good understand
ing of the two governments, and was in
consistent with the welfare and self
respect of the government of the United
States. The usual interchange of com
munication has since continued through
Her Majesty's legation m this city.
SEAL FISHERIES.
My endeavors to establish by international
co-operation measures for the prevention of
the extermination of fur seals m Behring
sea have not been relaxed, and I have
hopes of being enabled shortly to submit
an effective and satisfactory convention
project with the maritime powers for the
approval of the Senate.
CHINESE EXCLUSION.
In a message accompanying my approval
on the first day of October last, of a bill
for the exclusion of Chinese laborers, I laid
before Congress full information and all
correspondence touching the negotiation of
the treaty with China, concluded at this
capital on the 12th day of March, 1888,
and which having been confirmed by the
Senate with certain amendments was re
jected by the Chinese government This
message contained a recommendation that
a sum of money be appropriated as com
pensation to Chinese subjects who have
suffered injuries at the hands of lawless
men within our jurisdiction. Such appro
priation having been duly made, it is
hoped that by the cessation of the
influx of this class of Chinese subjects in
accordance with the expressed wish of
both governments, a cause of unkind feel
ing has been permanently removed.
TREATY WITH MEXICO.
The wisdom of concluding a treaty of
commercial reciprocity with Mexico has
been heretofore stated in my messages to
Congress, and the lapse of time and the
growth of commerce with that close neigh
bor and sister republic confirm the judg
ment so expressed. The precise relocation
of our boundary line is needful, and ade
j qoate appropriation is now recommended
^
A TRIBUTE TO SHERIDAN.
The deat a of Gen. Sheridan in August
last was a national affliction. The army
then lost the grandest of its chiefs. The
country lost a brave, experienced soldier,
a wise and dir-c-rett counsellor and a mod
est and sensible man. Those who in any
manner came within the range of his
persoral association will never fail to pay
deserved and willing homage to his great
ness and the glory of his career, but they
will cherish witn more tender
sensibility the loving memory of his
simple, generous and considerate nature
postoffice buildings.
A bill proposed by the Postmaster Gen
eral was introduced at the last session of
Congress, by which a uniform standard in
the amount of gross receipts would fix the
right ot a community to a public building
to be erected by the government for post
office purposes. It was demonstrated that
aside from the public convenience and the
promotion of harmony among citizens in
j variably disturbed by the change of leas
ings and ot site, it was a measure of the
highest economy and sound business judg
ment. It was found that the government
was paying in rents at the rate from 7 to
10 per cent per annum on what the cost of
such a building would be. I trust that
this measure will become a law.
DEALING WITH POLYGAMY.
It appears that prior to March, 1885,
there had been but six convictions in the
territories of Utah and Idaho under the
laws of 1862 and 1882, punishing polygamy
and unlawful cohabitation as crimes.
There have been since that date nearly 600
convictions under those laws and the stat
utes of 1887, and the opinion is expressed
that under such a firm and vigilant execu
tion of those laws, and the advance of ideas
opposed to the forbidden practices of
polygamy within the United
States, it is virtually at an end.
Suits instituted by the Government, under
the provisions of the act of March 30, 1887,
for the termination of the corporations
known as the perpetual emigrating fund
company and the church of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints have resulted in a
decree favorable to the Government declar
ing the charters of these corporations for
feited and escheating their property. Such
property, amounting in value to more than
$800,000, is in the hands of a receiver pend
ing further proceedings, an appeal having
been taken to the supreme court of the
United States.
AGRICULTURE.
The department of agriculture has con
tinued. with a good measure of success, its
efforts to develop the process, enlarge the
results and augment the profits of Ameri
can husbandry. It has collected aud dis
tributed practical information, introduced
and tested new plants, checked the spread

LAND GRANT RAILROADS.
The adjustment of the relations be
tween the government aud the railroad
companies which have received land grants
and the guaranty of the public credit in
aid of the construction of their roads,
should receive early attention. The report
of a majority of the commissioners ap
pointed to examine the affairs and indebt
edness of these roads, in which they favor
an extension of the time for the payment
of such indebtedness in at least one case,
where the corporation appears to be able to
comply with well guarded and exact terms
of such extension, and the reinforcement
of their opinion by gentlemen of undoubt
ed business judgment and experience ap
pointed to protect the interests of the gov
ernment. as directors of said corporation,
may well lead to the belief that such an
extension would be to the advantage of
the government. The subject should be
treated as a business proposition with a
view to the final realization of its indebt
edness by the government, rather than up
on prejudices or by the way of punish
ment for previous wrong doing.
SUSPENSION OF SILVER COINAGE.
The Secretary of the Treasury recom
mends the suspension of the further coinage
of silver and in such recommendation I
concur. For further valuable information
and timely recommendation I ask careful
attention of Congress to the secretary's re
port.
CONCLUSION.
T1 <■ consciousness that I have presented
but an imperfect statement of the condition
of our countiy and its wants, occasions no
fear that anything omitted is not known
and appreciated by the Congress upon whom
rests the responsibility of intelligent legis
lation in behalf of a great nation and a
confiding poople. As public servants we
shall do our duty well il' we constantly
guard the rectitude of our intentions, main
tain unsullied our love for our country and
with unselfish purpose strive for the public
good.

Washington. D. C., Dec. 3, 1888.
Eflect of Reading the Message.
Washington, December 3.—The read
ing of the message occupied one hour and
twenty minutes. The portions of it which
discuss the questions of tariff revision, treas
ury surplus, fishery troubles and [West in
cident were listened to with very close at
tention and apparent interest by the four
teen Republican Senators, and about an
equal number of Democrats. Other por
tions of the message seemed to liave few. if
any listeners, and the reading had the effect
of gradually clearing the galleries of the
mimerons spectators.
Washington, December 4 —The inter
est in the reading of the message slack
ened. Mills was the only member who
paid the slightest attention to the farther
reading, and the noise of conversation was
so great this was no easy task. When at
3:15, the reading being completed. Mills of
fered a resolution, which was agreed to, to
refer the message to the committee of the
whole, and providing for its printing. Ad
journed.
Washington, December 4.—The follow
ing are among congressional expressions on
Cleveland's message:
Springer, (Dem.) of Illinois, said: "It is
as strong on.the tariff question as the last
one, though not so explicit. It is a good
paper."
Congressman Reed, (Rep.) of Maine: "A
year has brought about a great change.
Then it was a condition that confronted us
and not a theory, and now, apparently, it
is a theory and not a condition."
Senator Ingalls, (Rep.) of Kansas: "Pres
ident Cleveland's imperturbility is entire
ly too perfect to be the result of self-con
troL" .
Congressman Boutelle (Rep.), of Maine:
"It's old straw threshed again. The mes
sage is weary, stale, flat and anprofitable."
Senator Gorman (Dem.), of Maryland:
"It is a very interesting, statesmanlike
document."
Congressman Foran (Dem), of Ohio
"The President has consented to let wool
alone this time. If he had been so dis
creet before the Republicans would not
have the next President and the next
House."
CLEVELAND ON BOND PUR
CHASE.
The size and species of the economy that
President Clevel.vnd believes in, is beauti
fully illustrated in what he has to say
about the purchase of government bonds.
When forced to it by the resolution of
both houses of Congre», he says, some
$95,000,000 of bonds have been bought at
market prices, on which the premium paid
was $17,500,000. And even at that he has
too confess that there was a saving of over
$27,000,000.m the samthat would have had
to be paid if the bonds had run to maturity.
He admits that, adding premium to prin
ciple and interest, the government real
ized 2 per cent on its investment.
But he does not have the disingenuous
ness and manline» to say that snch has
been the enhancement of our credit by
prompt payment and rapid reduction, that
the government could borrow all that it
wanted at 2 to 2i per cent When these 4
and 4; per cent bond were issued it meas
ured the extreme of our national credit.
No one then could foresee or would have
believed that the time would come in a
hundred years when we coaid borrow
money for less than 3 per cent The best
financiers in the world have been aston
ished at the result
It is not certain that we have yet
reached the extent of our credit. It is
certain in fact that we have not In that
case the premium on our bonds will rela
tively go higher. We know that it cannot
go lower ; therefore the sooner we can pay
them off the better will it be for us, the
cheaper we can bay them and the more
we will save.
The policy of depositing the surplus in
private banks without interest, in hopes
that the premium on bonds would get
lower, equals in simplicity the traveler
who sat down on the river bank to have
the water run past him. Unie» onr coun
try became again involved in a great
war or general disaster should overtake our
whole people the rates of interest on both
public and private loans must decrease,
and that will enhance the price of the
da» of securities bearing higher rates of
interest.
Our 4J per cent, bonds that come due in
September, 1891, amount to $250,000,000.
By purchase this amount has been consid
erably reduced. We could not pay such a
sum out of the ordinary receipts of one
year. We must either begin to save money
in advance, or borrow more to meet the
payment when it com» due.
We will not stop to ar^ue the foolish
proposition that a national debt is a
national blessing. We covet no such
ble»ings for our country. Better far than
saving up the money and allowing it to ac
cumulate in the treasury, is the plan of
buying in the bonds at market rates and
thus getting current rat» of interest on
this surplus.
surplus.
The far-fetched argument against col
lecting barely enongh to skin along with,
on the plea that it is taking money out of
the pockets of the people where it would
be worth six per cent, in order to inv»t it
at two per cent, do» not do credit to the
honesty or good sense of the people. There
is not a better paying inv»tment in the
world to individual or nation than paying
debts, and paying them in full. Did you
ever know a man of character and stand
ing in society, who preferred to use his
money in speculation rather than in pay
ment of his debts? Canada has a good
many fugitiv» of that da». There is
neither good sense or hon»ty in the finan
cial policy of the President. National
credit is the great»t of all national de
fens». It combines in itself the poesibili
ties of armi» and navi». If the struggle

which nation shall be mistress of the seas,
then we shall need all of our credit, and
against that day we should be husbanding
our strength.__
SOUTHERN SENSE.
In speeking ot the efforts being made by
the Southern pre» to keep the South
solid for the Democracy, the Galv»ton,
Texas, News says:
Perhaps the hope is entertained of gain
ing a victory for the Democratic party in
the next Pr»idential campaign through
sheer persistence of a solid South, without
reference to any community or diversity
of opinion on tariff reform or other mat
ters of national concern. Such a hope is
absurd and illusory. Relatively hereafter
the aggregate of the Southern States
must be a diminished quantity. It repre
sented this year 38 per cent of
the total number of electoral vot».
Four years hence, under another census
and with the admi»ion of three or four
new Stat», it is likely to represent hardly
more than 25 or 20 per cent of the total
number of those vot», and its continued
solidity on the line of sectionalism would
only be prejudicial to any cause or any
party with which it was associated.
The foregoing is the first gleam of good
sense on tbe sectional question disclosed to
the country from a Southern Democratic
paper for a long time. We are much mis
taken if wholesome expressions like those
of the Nercs do not take root in tbe South
one of these days. The great»t ble»ing
that can come to the South is a general
smash up of its solidity.
An Election Contest.
Livingston. December 3.— [Special to
tho Herald.]—A contest of the recent
election in Park county was begun Satur
day by H. O. Hickox. of Melville. Mr.
Hickox was the one defeated republican
nominee for county commissioner, the other
two being elected by large majorities. B.
F. Myers, the successful Democrat, was
elected by a majority of two over Hickox.
The seat of the contest will be the Spring
dale precinct, where seventy votes were
cast—a suspiciously large number con
sidering the number of residents in the
precinct. This precinct has been looked
upon with suspicion ever since election,
and it has been openly claimed that fraud
ulent vot» were cast there. Should this
precinct be thrown out Hickox is elected
by a majority of fifty-three.
A Russian Minister Dead.
St. Petersburg, December 4. —Admiral

CALIFORNIA STATEHOOD.
Yol. VI of Bancroft's History of Cali
fornia has lain on our table for some time
awaiting a notice that we lacked time and
space to give, and that would have escaped
attention in the hurry and excitement of
the campaign.
It com» very appropriately now while
the people of Montana are intently study
ing the qu»tion of early admission as a
State.
This volume of Mr. Bancroft's history
covers a period of eleven years in the his
tory of California from 1848 to 1859, from
the acquisition of the country from Mex
ico by the treaty of Guadalup3 Hidalgo,
Feb. 2,1848, till after the murder of Brod
erick by Judge Terry, who is now in prison
for contempt of court. It is a singular
commentary on the means of intercom
munication in those days not very remote
that the news of this event—the United
Stat» acquisition of California—did not
reach Monterey, then the capital. of the
country, till August following.
Even after the acquisition of California)
our Congres* failed to provide any govern
ment, farther than the continuance of the
Mexican laws. The trouhle was over the
slavery question. The rush occasioned, by
the discovery of gold took the settlement
out of the hands of Congress. There were
several military governors ending with
Riley,who called upon the people to choose
delegat» to a convention that might adopt
a constitution and elect State officers.
The call was for the election of thirty
seven members, and the election occurred
in August, 1849 ; but when they organized
in September, at Monterey, forty-eight
members were admitted under a rule that
every one should be a member who had re
ceived over 100 vot». The members were
paid $16 per day for their servie» out of a
fund of $600,000 that had been collected
without much color of law upon goods im
ported into California from the Stat» after
the acquisition of the country from Mexico.
The convention was made up from mis
cellaneous material, native and foreign, in
cluding many men of ability who subse
quently made their mark. There was
much contention over the boundaries.
Some wanted them to include what is now
embraced in Arizona, Utah and Nevada.
These delegat» chose their own boun
dari», and Congre» approved and adopted
their action. Strange to relate, though the
Southern men had a majority in the con
vention, there was very little opposition to
the clause introduced on motion of Wm.
E. Shannon, excluding slavery.
The election occur red in Novembe r and
le» than 13,000 votes were cast, nearly all
for the adoption of the constitution. At
the same time Peter H. Burnett was elect
ed governor. The legislature then chosen
met in December and the governor was in
stalled December 20. The election of Fre
mont and G win as senators followed forth
with. It was not till September 9, 1350,
with. It was not till September 9, 1350,
that California was admitted, but the delay
was caused by the prolonged discussion and
final passage of the Omnibus bill, of which
a portion was the admission of California as
a free State, under a constitution framed ty
a convention called without an enabling
act, that even determined its own numbers
after getting together, that established the
state boundari» without question.
In all these matters the administration
at tbe time favored the course pursued and
Congre» evaded the organization of form
of civil government.
The volume which contains all this his
tory of the organization of state govern
ment, contains vastly more,on subjects that
will never cease to be interesting, includ
ing the Sonora expedition of Wm. Walker
and tbe story of political corruption that
reigned down to the time Broderick was
killed. The notes of the volume are pro
fuse and rich and the book all through
possess» value and intei»t for every old
Montanian, and scarcely l»s for every
new comer.
The staff of the W»tern Union had no
enviable job in handling the ponderous
message of President Cleveland, which
burdened the wir» during the hours of
last night and this morning. There is lit
tle of the extraordinary in the document
except its extreme length. The Herald
has exercised the privilege of catting and
slashing on the heroic plan, for which it is
undoubtedly entitled to the hearty thanks
of the great ma» of its readers. Twenty
five thousand words are abont twenty
thousand too many for the average mental
digretion, when dreary department re
ports make up the bulk of the so-called
state paper. The local lightning strikers
are credited with excellent work in fur
nishing the text of the message.
It stiik» us that the true policy for the
construction of reservoirs to reclaim arid
lands, is for the government to advance the
money and make the inter»t on the cost
and the cost of maintenance an annual
charge upon the lands covered and bene
fited thereby. When the maximum of
lands that could be reclaimed had been
reached, this annual tax should be so
guaged that it woald repay each year some
portion of the cost, till at the end of 30 or
50 years thereafter the whole cost would
be repaid and tbe lands would own the
reservoirs. The land and the reservoirs
should be inseparably connected. The
land would derive ail their value from the
reservoirs and as they appreciated in value
this appreciation should go to pay the cost
of the construction of the reservoirs.
More important and interesting to our
Republican readers than any other piece of
news is the fact that the Republican ma
jority in the next house is assured. Cer
tificat» of election have been issued to
Coleman in Louisiana, Stockbridge in
Maryland, Evans in Tennessee, and to
three Republicans in North Carolina, while
the Republicans are sure of two and prob
ably three from West Virginia.
The President's message employs a great
many words to convey a very little in
formation. He stands by every mi«t»lr»
and blunder that he has made and re
iterates all the sentiments and opinions
that the people have so recently and sig
nally condemned.
TOO AWFUL FOK ANYTHING.
The President and devoted followers re
gard it as something awful that so large a
share of our annual revenues go to the pay
ment of pensions. Those who think the
Union was not worth preserving very
naturally put a low valuation on the ser
vices of those who gave strength and life
to save it. But no one who puts any
proper »timate on the services of the
Union soldiers, will ever think that they
can be suitably compensated, certainly not
o% erpaid.
Very true, no other country has
rewarded its defenders so munifi
cently. The response is ready, that
no other country was ever so well able to
make adequate compensation for valuable
servie». Other nations sacrifice life reck
leæly and refuse all compensation, but a
world full of such precedents cannot make
it right. The pay of a soldier was not one
third, on an average, for servie» that in
volved no extra hazard to life—for that
hazard no compensation was attempted at
the time. It was simply a deferred debt,
to be paid if we ever became able. And
now we are able, it is our first duty to dis
charge that debt.
Whether we consider the character of
the men who served and saved the coun
try, the value of that country to us or the
world, or the wealth and strength of that
country, giving it ability to pay its debts,
no one will think too much money is paid
out in pensions.
Do these growlers consider that these
veterans of the civil war are still perform
ing servie» for their country ? The fact
that we have such a large, loyal, ex
perienced body of veterns is the chief secur
ity our country has had for years against
dom»tic disorder and foreign aggre»ion.
Surely our diminutive army aud navy
would not inspire dread in a fourth rate
power, but the recollection that a half mil
lion of veteran soldiers could be called out
in an hour's time and be put on the way
to any point of danger, inspires a whole
some dread and profound respect from the
strong»t military power in the world a
Paying pensions to our old soldiers is doing
no more than retiring them on part pay.
They are serving their country now
as effectually as if in the ranks
shouldering their muskets and
marching every day to the
point of danger. England knows full
well the weakne» of our navy and the ig
norance and cowardice of our foreign pol
icy, but she knows also that we have skil
ful generals and brave soldiers for which
she has no match. Hence^that wonderful
forbearance so unlike her earlier bearing
towards us and her usual insolence towards
weak nations. We hold Canada in pledge
for England's good behavior, but England
would not mind that lo» half as much as
she dreads our attacks elsewhere. So long
» we have such a reserve of veterans,
England will not provoke us to the hazard
of war.
Our veterans are alro the instructors of
the rising generation in martial afiairs and
are doing our country a service in that di
rection that is well worth all
that we pay in pensions. We
know something of the cost of special
military schools. The martial spirit is
more than the drill in the make-up of
victorious so'diers, and for that we must
depend chiefly upon our veterans.
Better for us by far is it to be paying for
past servie» something like a fair com
pensation than to be paying out the same
amount to keep up a large standing army,
keeping our best blood and mus
cle out of productive industry
and unfitting them for succe» in
useful occupations in life. Only see the
rate at which we are pa»ing all the na
tion of the world in the accumulation of
wealth! The chief cause of this is that we
have no vast standing army and all our
able-bodied men are engaged in produc
tive industri».
A little serious and careful probing of
this question will satisfy any reasonable
and patriotic American citizen that our
country is acting more wisely than gener
ously in paying liberal pensions to her
brave defenders.
We fully agree with Senator Ingalls that
however inconsiderate it may have been
to give universal suffrage to the Southern
negro», which neither they wei e able to
protect for themselv» nor the general gov
ernment to guarantee, it is too late to re
consider the qu»tion. Revolutions of this
kind never go back. The negro can and
must be made an intelligent, independent
voter, and that is our business, if s* uth
em whites appeal to the negro in a civil
ized way they can control his vote to a
great extent, but they will never do it by
the old plantation, slave-driving way. It
strik» us, too, very favorably what Sena
tor Ingalls proposes about a national regis
tration. And we would sugg»t to the
Senator that this matter of registration
should go along with the business of tak
ing the census, and this census should be
taken at least every five years, so far as the
enumeration of inhabitants is concerned.
It might also serve a good purpose to have
the election of congre»men and presiden
tial electors take place at a time different
from the State or local elections. To have
the census serve the best purpose for na
tional elections it should be taken every
four years, and in June preceding the
election.
It was no fault of the Husbandman that
it failed to lull the sheep growers into a
feeling of security when the Free Trade
Democracy menaced the safety of the wool
industry. The m»meric spell which the
Husbandman insidiously tried to work upon
the sheep-men of Montana, did not take
Everyone of them was on his guard and he
watched the enemy as he would watch a
wolf ready to pounce upon the fold. But
the Husbandman , we are glad to know, is
not in that kind of business any more
Since the late political earthquake, in
which the free wool Democracy was en
gulfed, it has frankly confessed its wrong
and declared itself a convert to the Repub
lican doctrine of protection. Our hope is
that the Husbandman won't » gain back
slide.
The mon ey paid out in the purchase of
its own bonds by our national government
sends it forth into circulation jo*t as ef
fectually as depositing it in banks to be
loaned out. And in the latter case the
banks get the interest that the government
might save in baying bonds at the market
rates.
The brighten feature of Cleveland # ad
ministration, as it will stand out in history,
will be the growth of our nation in wealth
and credit, but the faithful historian will
have to confess that Cleveland did nothing
to aid, bnt all that he could to cripple our
credit and industry by the policies he re
commended.
At the last election the total vote of
Wisconsin was 10,000 greater than that of
Kentucky, aud would indicate at least 50,
000 larger pipulation. Under the present
apportionment Kentucky has eleven and
Wisconsin nine Congressmen. There are
going to be many chang» of this sort after
the next census is taken.
The total vote of Maine in the last elec
tion was 128,251. and reckoning hve per
sons to each voter woald give only 641,255
inhabitants, which is near 8,000 less than
by the censas of 1880. Judged by the
same ratio of inhabitants to voters Oregon
would have 310,000, and will be entitled
to at least two Representatives under the
next apportionment.
Idaho has named one of its tallest
mountain peaks "Mount Harrison," in hon

time last month. The boy babies named
Benjamin Harrison are innumerable m

OUR government has undertaken to pay
its bonds in gold and to provide this gold
has made all duties ou foreign imports pay
able in gold. As soon as our bonds are re
deemed and we have no outstanding obli
gations payable in gold exclusively, duties
on imports can as well be paid in green
backs and our coined silver, and .that will
enhance the value of our silver coin both
at home and abroad.
To get together at one time even $250,
000,000 of gold to make payment of our
debt in one lump sum, principle aud inter*
»t, on the day that it fell due, which
seems to be Mr. Cleveland's idea of the
proper thing to do. would derange all the
busine» iu the country, and gold would go
to fabulous prie». Infinitely better is it
to pay some portion of this debt every
month aud keep the gold in circnlation all
the rime.
Although California gave Harrison a

Inter-Ocean: It has been au exciting
year. Neighbor h» been pitted against
neighbor in discussing political questions.
The issue has been determined, and all
alike can g ve thanks that the result has
been accomplished peacefully and in order,
aud so little ill-will left in its wake. When
60,000,000 of people can go through such a
campaign, when so equally divided iu sent
iment and the defeated and the successful
settle down to business side by side with
out more than a good natured growl, it is
cause for devout thankfulness.
President Cleveland alone is respon
sible for the cruel and disgraceful eviction
Been» in Iowa. Senator Allison secured
the passage of a law for the relief of these
settlers and Cleveland vetoed it. The land
company that h» been declared the legal
owner upon technicalities never performed
the service that was to be a compensation
for these lands. Cleveland and Salisbury
are the great evictors in the Old World and
New. Let the responsibility rest where it
belongs. _
