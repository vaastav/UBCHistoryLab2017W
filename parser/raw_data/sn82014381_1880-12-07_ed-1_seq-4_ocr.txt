THE MESSAGE.
[CONTINUED FROM FIRST PAGE.]
lIISMHIS. however, seems :to me so clearly
i useful and efficient that I venture to press it
.' upon your earnest attention. It seems to
be a in. evident that the -.: prevision > ot
a rcular steam postal communication by aid from
the Government has been the forerunner of the
commercial preponderance of Great Britain on all
these casts and se w, a greater shore of whose trade
lathed— and intent of our people. It "is also
manifest that the off oris of other European nations
to contend with Great Britain for a share of this
caimmeree will be successful in proportion with
tin ir adoption if a regular steam postal communi.
canon with the markets whose trade they sought.
Mexico and the States of South America are anxious
to receive such postal communications with this
country -and will aid in their development. V Similar
co-operation may be looked for ln due time from
the Eastern nations and from Australia. It is diffi
cult to see how the lead iv this movement can be
- expected , from private- interests'. In respect of
foreign commerce, quite as much a* internal trad o,
postal e-ommunic -lion seems a necessary matter, and
1 respectfully recommend to your prompt attention
such j is', and efficient measure* as may conduce to
the development of our foreign commercial ex
changes and the building up of our carrying trade.
In this connection I desire also to suggest the veiv
great service which might be expected in enlarging
and facilitating our commerce on the Pacific Ocean,
were * transmarine cable laid from San Francisco to
the Sandwich Isl ,nds, and [ thence to Japan at the
nor— and Australia at the south. The great Influ
ence if such means of communication in these routes
of navigation in developing and securing a due share
of our Pacific Coast in the commerce of the world
needs no illustration or enforcement. . It may be
that snort an enterprise, useful acd in the end
profitable, as it would prove to private investment,
may teed to be accelerated by prudent legislation by
Congress in its aid, and I submit the matter to your
careful consideration. An additional and not unim
portant, although secondary, reason for fostering ,
and enlarging our navy may be found in the unquer
tionable serice to the expansion of our commerce
whirl, would lie render— by the frequent ciri;'i!a
tiou of naval ships in the seas and port* of all quar
ter, of the globe." Ships of proper construction and
equipment, to be of the greatest efficiency in
case- of maritime war, might be made constant and
live agents in time of peace in the advancement
and protection of our fore'gn trade and the future
discipline of young seamen, who would naltiral'y
in some numbers mix with and improve the crews
of onr merchant ships. Our merchant* at homo j
and abroa ' recognize the value to foreign com
mer.i- of the active movement of our naval ves
sels, and the intelligence and patriotic zsnl of naval
officers in promoting every interest of their coun
trymen is a Just subject for national pride.
FINANCIAL AFFAIRS.
The condition of the financial affair* of the Gov
ernment; as shown by the reports of the Secretary
of the Treasury, are very satisfactory. It is be!i ved
that the present financial situation of tbe United
States, whether considered with respect to trade,
currency, credit, growing wealth, or the extent and
variety of our resources, is more favorable than that
of any other country of our time, and has never
I be; surpassed by that of any country at any period
in its history. All our industries are thriving; the
rate of interest is low ; new railroads arc being con
str—ted ; a vast immigration is increasing our pop-
I ': ,-,, capital and labor; new enterprises in great
number are in progress, and our commercial rela
lions with other countries arc improving. The ordi
nary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year
en led June 1880 were .(cents being omitted)
From customs, $180,522,064 ; from internal revenue,
813 4,9— ,378; i from . sale :of public lauds,
$10,116,506; from ... tax . on . circulation and
deposits of ~ national banks, $7,014,971 ;
from the repayment of iaterest by the Pacific Roil
way Companies, 81,707,367 ; from the sinking fund
for the Pacific Railway Companies, $790,621 ; from
customs fees, fines, penalties, etc., $1,148,800 ; from
fees consular, letters patent and lands, $2,337,029 ;
Iron, the proceeds |of the sales of " Government
property, $282,616 ; from the profits of coinage, etc.,
$2,71— ; from revenues of the District of Colum
bia, soil, Kil l; from miscellaneous sources, $1,099,
---603. Total ordinary receipts, $333,526 ,610. The
•ordinary expenditures for the same period were :
' tot civil expense", $— ,— B,B__ for foreign inter
course, $1,211,490 ; for Indians, $5,945,457 ; for pen
sions (including . $19,311,0— arrears of . pensions),
$5*1,777,174 ; for tho military establishment
(including river and harbor im, rovemcuts and
arsenals). 110,910 ; for the naval establishment
(including vessels, in.tchinery aid improvements at
navy yards), $13,536,951 ; f r miscellaneous expend
itures (including public buildings, houses and col
lecting the revenue), $34.53.'',— 1 ; for expenditures
on account of the District if Columbia, $3,272,384 ;
for Inter. on the public debt, 757,57.. ; for pre
miums '■:. bonds purchased, $2,795,320. Total ordi
nary expenditures, I*-— 12,9." 7 leaving a surplus
revenue of $1.5,8— ,05.1, which, with the amount
drawn from the cash balance- in 'he treasury of
$8,184,484, making 873,988,(67. Ihe appropriation
for the redemption of bonds for tho sinking fund
was $73,652,900. Tho amount due the sinking fund
' for this year was $37,931,643. There was applied
thereto the sum of $73,904,017, being $35,972,973 in
excess of the actual requirements for the year. The
aggregate of revenues from all sources during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, was $333,520,810—
an increase over the preceding year of 90.9,421"-
Tin receipts thus far of the current year, together
with estimated receipts for the remainder of the
year, amount to $150,000,000, which will be
euißcient to meet the estimated expend
itures of the year and leave a surplus
of $90,250,000. It is fortunate that this large sur
).l ii_ revenue occurs at a period , when it may be
directly ,i; plied to the payment of the public debt,
Boon redeemable. No V public . duty has been
more e-oustantly cherished in the United States
than tin policy of paying the nation's debt as rap
idly as possible. The debt of the United States, less
cash in the Treasury and exclusive of accruing in
terest, i.'.taincd its maximum of $2,756,441,571 in
August, 1865, and has since that time been reduced
. to 11.881 , 519, 504. Of the principal of the debt,
810,875,810 has been paid since March 1, 1877, effect
ing an - annual saving of - interest of $0,109, ."•'■::•
The burd v of interest :' hoi also been di
m'nisbed by , tho ;- sale . . of bonds drawing
a low rate of interest, and the application
of the proceeds to the redemption of bonds bearing
a higher rate. The annual saving ilu. secured
since- March 2, 1877, is $11,290,453. | With n a short
period over $600,000,000 1 in five and six per cent.
bonis, will become redeemable. This presents a
very favorable opportunity, not ! only to farther re
duce the principal of the debt, but also to reduce the
rate of interest on that which - will remain unpaid.
I coll the attention of Congrcs to the views pro
posed on this subject by the Secretory of tho Treas
ury In his annual report, and ' recommend prompt
legislation to enable tbe Treasury Department to
complete the refunding of the debt which is about
to mature. The' continuance of specie j payments
: ho* n.i been interrupted or endangered since the
date of resumption. : It has contributed greatly to
the revival of business, and to our remarkable pros
perity. V The fear* that preceded »nd accompanied
resumption have proved groundless. No consider
able amount of United States notes have been pre
sented for redemption, while very large sums of
gold bullion, both domes and imported, are taken
to the Mint and exchanged for coin or notes." Tbe
increase of coin or bullion in* the United States I
since January 1, 1879, is estimated at $227,339,423.
There oie still in existence uncanceled $340,681,016
of United State* ";. legal tender > notes. These
notes :■ were } r authorized . as % a . war . measure,
mole necessary by the exigencies of the conflict
in which the United States was then engaged. The'
preservation of the nation's existence required, in
the Judgment of Congress, the issue of legal tender
ooper money. 4 " That it served well the purpose for
which i: was created is not questioned, but the em
ployment of notes os paper money indefinitely after
the accomplishment of the J object for ."which they
-were provided was not contemplated by the trainers
of the law under" which ■ they were issued. These
notes long since x became',. like any: other primary
-. gallon of the- Government, a debt to be paiil,
\ and when paid to' be lancelod, a* a' mere evidence
of indebtedness no longer existing. I therefore re
- I— it v.:-.:it was said in" my message of last year, that I
the retirement from circulation '; ef United States |
j note-, with* capacity of legal tender to private con
tracts Is a step ti be tab- to oar, progress towards
a sife and stable currency, which should be accepted ;
as th.> policy niid "duty of the ! Government and the
interest and security "of the people. "f At the time , I
"the passive of the Act now to force, requiring the
coinage of : sUver diKars, fixing; their value and
giving them a legal lender character, it was be
lieved by many supporters of the measure that
the silver doll- »l.i-b it authorized would speedily ,
become, under " the operations of ■' the ' law, of an I ,
- equivalent value to ! a . (Slid ; dollar. J There ; were ; j
other supporters of the bill who, while they doubted ,
is to the probability of this result, nevertheless j i
were willing to give the prop-cd experiment a f.-ir , i
trill, with a view to step the C inagc if - experience
should prove that the silver dollar authorized by
tbe" bill continu-d to be of I— l commercial value
than the standard gold dollar. Toe coinage ct * -
v-r dollar* under the Act "j referred ' to began in
March, 1878, and has been continued as required by ;
the Act. The average rate per month to this point
of time has been $2,i7«,492. 1 The total amount
coined prior to the Ist of November last was $72,
---817.150. Of this amount, $17,084,450 remain in the
I— asm y, and only 8— ,7— .291 ' are in the bands of
the people. A constant effort has been made to
keep this currency in circulation, and con i'eratlo
expense necessarily undergone tor the purpose, but
its return to the treasury is prompt and sure. : Con
trary to the confident anticipations of friends of the
measure at the time of its adoption, the value of
the silver dollar containing 412' grains of silver has
not increased. .;. Daring the year prior to the passage
of the bill authorizing its coinage, the market value
of the silver which it contains wai from 00 to 92
cent', as compare- with the standard gold dollar.
During the last year the average and market value
of the silver dollar has been 881 cent*. 7 It is obvi
ous that the legislation of the last Congress in regard
to silver, so far as it was based on the anticipation
of an increase in the value- of silver as a result of
that legislation, lias failed to produce the effect
predicted. ' Tiic longer - the y law remain* am
force, : requiring, as it does, the coinage of
a nominal dollar which :in : reality is r not " a
dollar, the greater becomes the danger that this
countiy will be forced to accept the metal as the
sole leal standard value in circulation, and thus a
standard of less value than it purport* to be would
be recognized in the money markets of the world.
The Constitution of the United States, sound finan
cial principles and our best interests, all require a
currency which will serve as legal tender money.
To banish either of these metals from our currency
is to narrow and limit the circulating medium of
exchange, to the disparagement of imjiortant inter
ests The United States produces more silver than
any other country, and is directly interested in
maintaining it as one o! the two precious metal*
which furnish the coinage of the world. It
will, in my judgment, contribute to this result
if Congress ill repeal so much of the existing legis
lation as requires the coinage of silver dollars of an
equivalent with the gold dollar. This will defraud
no man, and will be in accord with familiar pre
c.'dents. Congress, on sovcra! occasions, ha* altered
the ratio of value between gold and silver, in order
to establish it more nearly in accordance with .the
actual ratio value between the two metals. ' In
financial legislation, every measure "in the direction
of greater fidelity in the discharge of pecuniary
obligations his been found by experience to dimin
ish the rates of interest which debtors are required
to pay, and increase the facility with which money
can be obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our
own recent financial history . shows how surely
money becomes abundant whenever confidence in
t''6*.xact performance of moneyed obligations is
established.
THE WAR DEPARTMENT.
The Secretary of War reports that the expendi
lures of the War Department for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1880, was $39,924,773. The appropri
ations for this Department for the current. fiscal
year amounted to $41,993,-0. With respect to the
army the Secretary invites attention to the fact that
its strength is limited by statute (Section 115 of the
Revised Statutes) to not more than 30,000 enlisted
men, but that the provisos contained in the appro
priation bills have limited the expenditure to an
enlistment of but 25,000. It is believed that the
full legal strength is the least possible force at
which the present organization can be maintained,
having in view efficiency, discipline and economy.
While the enlistment of this force would add some
what to the appropriation for the pay of the army,
the saving made in other respects would be more
than equivalent for this additional outlay, rod the
efficiency of the army would be largely increased.
The rapid extension of the- railroad system west of
the Mississippi river, and the great line of settlers
which has flowed in upon the new territory, impose
on the military an entire change of policy. The
maintenance of small posts along tho wagon and
stage route sof travel is no longer necessary. Per
manent quarters at points selected, of more sub
stantial character than those- heretofore constructed,
will be required, ludcr the existing laws perma
nent buildings cannot be erected without the sanc
tion of Congress, and when the Sale of military
sites and buildings lias been authorized the
moneys received have reverted to the Treasury, and
could only becu'.i. I available through new appro
priations. It is recommended that provisions be
made by general statement for tbe sale of such
abandoned military posts and buildings as arc found
unnecessary, and for application of the proceeds to
tho construction of other posts." While man y of
tbe present posts arc of but slight value for mili
tary purposes, owing to the changed condition of
the country, their occupation is continued at great
expense and great - inconvenience, because they
afford the only available shelter for the troops.
Tlie absence 'of a large number of officers of the
line on active duty from their regiments is a serious
detriment to the maintenance of the service. Tbe
constant demand for small detachments, each of
which should be commanded by a commissioned
officer, and the various details of officers for neces
sary service away from their commands, occasions a j
scarcity in tho number required for company duties.
With a view to les ening this drain to some extent
it is recommended that a law authorizing t! c detail
of officers from the active list as Professor of Tactics
and Military Science a. certain colleges and uni
versities be so amended as to provide that all such
details be made from the retired list of the army.
Attention is asked to the necessity of providing leg
islation for organiz'ng the army and disciplining the
active militia of the country, and liberal appropria
tions are recommended in this behalf. The reports
of the Adjutant General of the Ai my and Chief of
Ordnance, touching this subject, fudy set forth its
importance. The report of the officers in charge of
education in the army shows that there are seventy
eight schools now in operation in the army, with an
aggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted men and
children. The Secretary recommends the enlist
ment of 150 schoolmasters, with the rank, pay
and commission of a sergeant. - An appro
priation is needed to ' supply : the Judge
Advocate of the army with | suitable libra
ries, and the Secretary recommends that the
corps of the Judge Advocates be placed upon the
same footing as to promotion with other staff corps
of the army. . Under the existing laws the Bureau
of Military Justice consists of one e Ulcer, Judge Ad
vicate-C.cner.il, and a corps of Judge Advocate* of
eight officers of equal j rank (Majors), with a pro
vision that the limit of the corps shall remain at four
when reduced by casuality or resignation to that
number. The consolidation of the Bureau of Mill,
tary Justice and the corps of the. Judge Advocates
upon the same basis with other stuff corps of the
army , would remove an , unjust ; discrimination
against deserving officers, and subserve the best
interests of the service, j Especial attention is asked
to the report of the Chief of Engineers upon the
condition of our national defenses. jf From personal
inspection of many of the fortifications referred to,
the Secretary is able to emphasize the recommend
ations made, and state that their incomplete and
defenseless condition is discreditable to the country.
While ' other nations have been increasing their
means for tarrying on offensive warfare and attack,
iug maritime cities, we have been dormant In
preparation for defense. .', Nothing of importance
has been done toward j strengthening and finishing
our case mated works since our late civil war, during
which the great guns of modern warfare and the
heavy armor of modern fortifications and ships came
into use among nations, and . our i earthworks," left
by the sudden failure of - appropriations I some
years since in all stages of ineompletion, are now
being rapidly destroyed by the element*. ■
7/7 Mississippi AND Columbia" rivers." ,i ~, 7
7 Two great rivers of the North American Conti
nent, the Mississippi . and Columbia, have their
i navigable waters wholly within the limits of the
United States, and are of vast importance to our
i internal and foreign commerce."!.' Th i permanency
I of the important work in the South : Pass of the
Mississippi river seems now ,to be assured. There
has been no failure whatever in the maintenance of
the maximum channel during the six months ended
August 9— lost. This experiment has opened a
broad, deep highway to the ocean, and is an im
provement upon the permanent success of which
congratulations may be exchanged among the peo
ple abroad, and especially among ' the communities
of , the " Mississippi valley, whose commercial j ex
changes float _ an ■ unobstructed channel safely to
and from the sea. The comprehensive improve
ment of the Mississippi and its tributaries is a mat*
ter of trans— importance. _ These great water*
ways _ comprise Ja " system of land transportation

i ically they are the strongest tie between the various
sections of the country. These channels of communi
■ cat ion and interchange ore the property of the nation
; Its jurisdiction is paramount over their waters, and I
the plainest principles cf public inter— require their
intelligent and careful supervision, with ' a view to
their protection and improvement' and the enhance- -
ment of their usefulness. The channel cf the Colum
bia river, for a distance of about 100 iniies from it*
' mouth, is obstructed by a succession of bars, which
j occasion : serious '"delay* -; in f navigation "• and j" a
! heavy exp-- use for lighterage^ and towage. V^A depth .
of at least twenty feet at low tide should be secured \
and maintained, to meet tr-e requirements of the ex

this great water way is the permanent improvement
of the channel at the month of the river. .

THE NEW. (TAB DEPARTMENT BCILDIXG.
V} The completion ol . the new- building for the War
Department is urgently, needed, and estimates for
continuing its construction are especially recom
mended.'.;' The collection of books, specimens and
records constituting the Army Medical Museum and
Library are of national importance.- The Library
now contains about 51,500 vol— and 57,000 pam
phlets relating | to " medicine, surgery j and allied
topics. . The contents of the Army Medical Museum
consist of 22,000 specimens, and are unique in the
completeness with which both military surgery and
diseases of armies are illustrated." Their destruction
would be an irreparable loss, not only to the United
States, but to the woild. There arc filed in the
record and dispensation division over 16,000 bound
volumes of hospital records, together with a great
quantity of papers, embracing | the original records
of the hospitals of our armies during the civil war.
Aside from their historical value, these records are
daily searched for evidence needed in the settlement
of large numbers of pensions and other claims, for
the protection of the Government against attempted
frauds, as well as for , the benefit of honest claim- -
ants. These , valuable collections . are now iv a
building which is peculiarly exposed to the danger
of destruction by fire. It is therefore earnestly
recommended that an appropriation be made for a
new fireproof building adequate for the present
needs and reasonable future expansion of these
valuable c llections. Such building should be ab
solutely fireproof. No expenditure for mere archi
tectural display is required, j It is believed that a
suitable structure can be erected at a cost not to
exceed $250,000. ,77:".
ril'GClrmON IN REGARD TO GENERAL GRANT.
I commend to the attention of Congress the great
services of the Commander-in-Chief of our armies
during the war for the Union, whose wise, firm and
patriotic conduct did so much 1 1 bring that momen
tous conflict to a close. The legislation of the
United States contains many precedents for the
recognition of distinguished military merit, author
izing rank and emolument ,to be conferred for
eminent services to the country. A law author
izing the appointment of a Captain-General of the
Army, with suitable provisions relating to compen
sation, retirement and other details, would in my
judgment, be altogether fitting and proper, and
would be warmly approved by the country.
- ' THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretory of the Navy exhibits a
successful and satisfactory management of that
Department during the last fiscal year. The total
expenditures for the year were $12,916,639, leaving
unexpended at the close of the year 82,141,682 of
tbe amount of the appropriations. The appropria
tions for the present fiscal year ending June 30,
1881, are $15,095,061, and the total estimates for the
next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1882, ore $15,953,
--751. The am unt drown by warrant from July 1,
1880, to November 14, 1880, was $3,041,570. The
recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy that
provision be made for the establishment of some
form of civil government for the people of
Alaska is approved. At present there is
no : protection of persons or property in
that Territory except such as is offered by the offi
cers of the United States ship Jamestown. This
vessel was dispatched to Sitka because of a fear
that without tbe immediate presence of national
authority there was -" an | impending danger of
anarchy. The stops taken to restore order have
been accepted in good faith by both the white aud
Indian inhabitants, and the necessity for the method
of restraint does not, in my opinion, now exist. If,
however, the Jamestown should be withdrawn,
leaving our people as at present without the ordi
nary Judicial and administrative authority of an
organized; local government, serious conse
quences might ensue. The lows provide only
for the 7 collection of , revenue, . protection
of "7 public property and' the transmission
of mails. The problem is to supply local rule for a
population so scattered and peculiar in its origin
and condition. The natives arc reported to be
tractable and self-supporting, and if properly in
structed doubtless would advance rapidly in civiliza
tion, and a new- factor of prosperity would be added
to the national life. I therefore recommend requi
site legislation upon this subject. The Secretary of
the Navy has taken steps towards the establishment
of naval coaling stations at the Isthmus of Panama,
to meet the requirements of our commercial rela
tions with Central and South America, which are
rapidly growing in importance-. Locations emi
nently suitable, both as regards our naval purposes
and the uses of commerce, have been selected— one
on the east side of the Isthmus at Chiriqui Lagoon,
in the Caribbean Sea, and the other on the Pacific
coast at the Bay of Golfito. The only safe harbors
sufficiently commodious on the isthmus are at these
points, and the distance between them is less than
100 miles. The report of the Secretary of the Navy
concludes with valuable suggestions with respect to
the building up of our merchant marine service,
and which deserve the favorable considera ion of
Congress.
' V ;,;/, . POSTAL AFFAIRS. 7 ..".•'',-. .
The report of the Postmaster- General exhibits a
continual growth and a high state of efficiency of
the postal service. The operations of no depart
ment of the Government, perhaps, represents with
greater exactness the increase in population and
business of the country. § In 1860 the postal receipts
were $85,180.471 ; in 1880, the receipts were $.3,
--315,479. All the inhabitants of the country are di
rectly and personally j interested in having proper
mail facilities, and naturally watch the Postoffice
very closely. This careful oversight of the people
has proved' a constant stimulus to improvement.
During the post year there was an increase of 2,134
postoffices, and the mail routes were extended 27,
--177 miles, making an additional annual transporta
tion of 18,8*4,191 miles. The revenues of the postal
service for the ensuing year are estimated at $38,
--845,174, and the expenditures at $42,475,932, leav
ing a deficiency to be appropriated out of the Treas
ury of 81,630,737. ■ The Universal Postal Union has
received an accession of almost all the countries and
colonies of the world maintaining . on organized
postal service, aid it -confidently expected that all
other countries and | colonies now outside ( the
Union will J soon unite - therewith, thus . real
ising the .grand ! idea of : the founders of : the
Union, of forming, for purposes of international
mail communication, a single postal territory em
bracing the world, with a complete uniformity of
postal charges and conditions of international ex
change for "all descriptions of correspondence. ! To
enable the United States to do its full share of . this
great work, additional legislation Is asked by the
Postmaster General, to whose recommend ation es
pecial attention is called. ':. The suggestion of the
Postmaster-General that it would be wise to en
courage by appropriate legislation the establish
ment of American lines to carry the moils between
our own )«rts and those of Mexico, Centra! Amer
ica, South' America, and of the trans-Pacific coun
tries, is commended to the serious consideration of
Congress. I The attention of Congress is also invited
to the suggestions of the Postmaster-General in re
gard to postal savings bonks. . V
,1~.- "7 ' THE FEDERAL COURTS. ' v|*|]§_§
The necessity for additional provisions to aid in
the transaction of the ' business of ' the . Federal
Courts, becomes each Ti or j more apparent. | The
dockets of the Supreme Court and Circuit Courts
to a great number of circuits are incumbered with
the constant' accession of ' cases. In the former
Court, and in many instances to the Circuit Courts,
years intervene ; before it is practicable ■to bring
cases to a bearing. The Attorney-General recom
mends the establishment of an intermediate Court
of Errers and Appeals. It is recommended that the
number of Judges of Circuit Court in each circuit,
with the exception of the Second Circuit, should be
increased by the addition of another Judge. In the
Second Circuit that two should be added, and that
an intermediate Appellate Court thould be formed
in each circuit, to consist of Circuit Judges and a
Circuit Justice, and that to the event of the ab
sence of either of .these Judges the place of the ab
sent Judge should be supplied by the Judge of one
of the D : strict Court* in the circuit. j Such Appel
late" Court eoald be safely invested with large juris
diction, and 7; the V; decision* $ would 7; satisfy
suitors in many cases .when 'appeals; would still
be allowed to the Supreme Court. The expense in
curred for] this ' intermediate : Court j will : require a
very moderate increase of the appropriations for
the expecscs. of the Department of Just ice.Vi This
recommendation is commended to the careful con
sideration of Congress. It is evident that the delay
of justice, iv many instances oppressive and disas
trous io suitors, now necessarily occ rs in the Fed
eral Courts which will to this way be remedied. jrK"; '

7 The report of the Secretary of the Interior pre- j
sen an elaborate account of the operations of that ,
Department during the past year. ■ It gives me great
pleasure to say that our Indian * affairs appear to be !
in a more hopeful { condition ; now than ever before.* j
The Indians have' made gratifying progress to agri- ]
culture, herding and mechanical pursuits. .; Many"!
who '. were j a few y ears ; ago in , hostile - conflict
with the : Government are < quietly settling down j
on farms, where they hope to make their permanent -
homes, building houses and engaging in the occupa
tions of civilized life."; .The introduction of ; the
freighting business among . them has been remark
ably fruitful of good results, in giving many of them
congenial and ■ remunerative ' employment, and :in
stimulating their ambition to earn their own sup
port. Their honest}-,' fidelity and efficiency as car
riers are highly praised. V.The organization of a po
lice force of Indians has been equally successful in
maintaining law and order upon the reservations,
and in I exercising a- wholesome" moral : Influence
among the Indians themselves. " I concur with the
Secretary of the Interior in the recommendation
that the pay of this i force be increased, as an in
duce ent to the best class of young men to enter
it. Much care and attention has been devoted to the
enlargement of educational facilities for the Indians.
Schools at the Indian | Agencies have been estab
lished, and the erection of buildings has been begun
for several more;, but an increased appropriation
for this interesting undertaking is greatly needed
to accommodate the i largo number of Indian chil
dren of school age. ' The number offered by their
parents from all parts of the country for education
in the Government schools is much larger than can
be accommodated with the means at present availa
ble for the - purpose. g The J number |of ■ Indian
pupils .. at "' the Normal 7 School , at -.. Hampton,
la., under ; the . direction of . General Arm
strong," has been considerably increased, and their
progress highly encouraging.:' The Indian school
established by the Interior Department in 1879 at
Carlisle, under the direction of Captain Pratt, has
been equally success!—. ".' It has now nearly 200 pu
pils of both sexes, representing a great variety of
tribes east of the Rocky Mountains. Pupils In both
these institutions receive not only an elementary
English education, but are instructed in housework,
agriculture and useful mechanical pur uits. A sim-
I— school was established this year at Forest Grove,
Oregon,' for the education of the Indian youth on
the Pac'flc coast. In addition to this, thirty-six In
dian boys and girls were selected from the Eastern
Cherokee* and placed in boarding schools iv North
Carolina, where they are t» receive an elementary
English education and training to industrial pur
suits. The interest shown by Indian parents,
even among the '-'.so-called V. wild ;-, tribes, '■ in
the educa'ion of their children is very grati
fying, and gives ; promise that the results
accomplished by the efforts now making will be of
lasting benefit. The expenses of Indian education
so far have been drawn from the permanent civili
zation fund at the i_ iposal of the Department of the
luUrior, but that iuud is now so much reduced
that the continuance of this beneficial work will in
the future depend on appropriations by Congress
for the purpose, and I would venture to express the
hope that Congress will not permit institutions so
fruitful of good results to perish for want of means
for their support. On the contrary, the increase of
the number of such schools appears to me highly
advisable. The past year has been unusually free
from disturbances among the Indian tribes. An
agreement has been made, with the I'tes, by which
they surrender their largo reservation in Colsrado
to consideration of an annuity to be paid them, and
agree to settle iv severalty on certain lands
designated for that purpose as farmers, holding
individual title to their land in fee simple, in
alienable for a certain period. In this way a costly
Indian war has been avoided, which at one time
seemed imminent, and for the first time in the his
tory of the country an Indian nation has given up
its tribal existence to settle in severalty and live as
individuals under the common protection of tho
laws of tho country. The conduct "of the Indians
throughout the country during the past year, with
a few noteworthy exceptions, has been orderly and
peaceful. The guerilla warfare carried on for two
years by Victorio and his bond of Southern Apaches
ho* virtually come to an end by the death of that
chief and most of his followers on Mexican soil.
The disturbance caused on our northern frontiers
by Sitting Bull and his men, who had taken refuge
in the British Dominion, are also likely to cease. A
large majority of his followers have surrendered to
oar military forces, and the remainder are appar
ently in progress of desintegration. I concur with
the Secretary of the Interior In expressing an
earnest hope that Congress will, at this session, take
favorable action on the bill providing for the allot*
ment of lands on the different reservations in
severalty to the Indians, with patents conferring a
fee simple title, unalienable for a certain period, and
eventually the disposition of the residue of the re
servation for general settlement, with the consent and
for the benefit of the Indians, placing the latter under
equal protection of the laws of tho country. This
measure, together with a vigorous prosecution of
our educational efforts, will work a most important
and effective advance towards the solution of the
Indian problem, and in preparing for the gradual
merging of our Indian population into the great
body of American citizenship.
PUBLIC LANDS. "
A large in reuse is reported iv the disposal cf
public lands for settlement daring the past year,
which marks the prosperous growth of our agricult
ural industry and the vigorous movement of the
population toward our unoccupied lands. As the
movement proceeds, the codification of our land
laws, as well as proper legislation to ■ regulate tbe
disposition of public lands, become of more pressing
necessity, and I therefore invite the consideration
of Congress to the aocomponying draft of j a bill
made by the Public Lands Commission, which was
communicated by me to Congress at its last session.
Early action upon this important subject is highly
desirable. -.. The attention :of Congress is again
colled to the wasteful depredations committed on
our public timber lands, and the rapid and indis
criminate destruction of our forests. The urgent
necessity for legislation to that end Is now generally
recognized, in view of the lawless character of the
depredations committed and the disastrous conse
quences which will inevitably follow their continu
ance. Legislation has again and again been recom
mended to arrest the evil and preserve for the
people of our Western States md Territories the
timber needed for domestic and other essential
uses. ■ ■"-"'''
"...■ THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.
The report of the Director of the Geol rgicol Sur
vey is a document of unusual interest. The con
solidation of the various geological and geographical
surveys and exploring enterprises, each of which
heretofore operated . upon an independent ; plan
without concert, cannot fail to be of great benefit
to all th OS3 industries of the country which dependt
up:n" the development of our mineral resources.
The labors of the scientific men of recognized
merit who compose the corp3 of the geological sur
vey during the first season of their field operations
and inquiries, appear to have been very compre
hensive, and will soon be communicated to Con
gress in a number of volumes. I The Director of the
Survey recommends that the investigations carried
on by his Bureau, which so for have been confined
to the so-called public land States and Territories,
be extended over the entire country, and that the
necessary appropriation be made for this purpose.
This would be particularly beneficial to the iron,
coal and other . mining interests in the Mississippi
valley, and of the Eastern and Southern States."
The subject is commended to the careful consider,
ation of Congress. : 7 .7
MORE ROOM NEEDED. -
I The Secretory of the Interior talis attention to
the ' want of room 'to the . public building of the
Capitol, new existing and in course of construction,
for the accommodation of the clerical force employed
on the public records. _ Necessity has compelled the
renting of private buildings in different parts of the
city for the location of public edifice*, for which a
large amount of rent is annually paid, while the
separation of offices belonging to the same Depart
ment impedes the transaction of , current business.
The Secretary suggests that the block surrounding
Lafayette Square on the east, north and . west, be
purchased as a site for tbe new edifice for the accom
modotion of Government oil— leaving the square
itself intact, and that if such building* were con
structed upon a harmonious plan of architecture
they would odd ' much . to the beauty of j the na
tional " capital, ; and would, . together ; with J tho
Treasury and new State, Navy and War Department
building, form one of the most imposing group of
public edifices in the world. : . •

i StgSJpiliS EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS. 'a.-#r|l|ss?j(i.
9 Tlie Commissioner of Education reports a contin
"] ued increase of public interest to educational affairs,
and that public reboots generally throughout the
j country are well sustained.' I Industrial training is
" attracting deserved attention, and colleges for in
struction in the theoretical and ; practical in agri
culture and the mechanic arts, including j tbe I Gov
ernment schools recently established for, the in
struction of the Indian youth, are gaining steadily
in public "estimation. *_s The j Commissioner \ asks
special attention to the depredations committed
on lands reserved for the future support of public
instruction, and to the very great need of help from
the nation for schools in the Territories and in the
Southern States. The recommendation heretofore
made is repeated and' urged, that « an educa
tional fund be set apart .':,, from the ;".' net
proceeds 3of . : the sales of j public | lauds ■'- an
nually, the income of wlieh" and . th 8 remainder
of the net annual proceeds to bedistributed on some
satisfactory plan to States at d Territories and the
District of Columbia. • The" success of. the public
schools of the District of Columbia, and the progress
made under the intelligent direction of the Board
of Education and the Superintendent in supplying
the educational requirements of the District with
well-trained and efficient teachers, is very gratifying.
Acts of Congress from time to time, donating public
lands to the ceveral States and Territories in aid of
educational interests, have proved to be vvißo meas
ures of public policy, resulting in a great and lasting
benefit. , It would seem to be a matter of simple
justice to extend the benefits of this legislative
wisdom, which lias been so fully vindicated by ex
perience, to the District of Columbia, -- ''
7 • 7" THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. .
- 1 again commend the general interests of the Dis
trict of Columbia to the favorable consideration of
Congress. The affairs of the District, as shown by
the report of the Commissioners, are in a very sat
isfactory condition. In my annual messages here
tofore, and in my special message of December 15,
1879, 1 have urged upon the attention of Congress
the , necessity .of reclaiming the marshes of the
Potomac , adjacent *j to the capital, and I am
constrained by its importance to advert ' again
to the subject. These flats embrace an area of sev
eral hundred acres. They are an impediment to the
drainage of the city, and seriously impair its health.
His believed that with this substantial improve
ment of its river front the capital would be in all
respects one of the most attractive cities in the
' world. Aside from its permanent population, this city
is necessarily the place of residence of persons from
every section of the country engaged in tho public
service. Many others reside here temporarily for
the transaction of business with the Government.
It should not be forgotten that the land reclaimed
will probably be worth the cost of reclaiming it,
and tl.e : navigation of the river be greatly im
proved. 1 therefore again invite the attention of
Congress to the importance of a provision
for this much . needed and too long 7 de
layed improvement. The water supply cf the city
is inadequate. In addition to its ordinary use
throughout the city, the consumption by the Gov
ernment is necessarily very great in the navy yard,
arsenal and various other deportments, and a large
quantity is required for the proper preservation of
the numerous parks and cleansing of sewers.
I recommend that this , subject . receive the
early attention of Congress, '.- and that in
making provision for "an increased sup
ply, such moans be . adopted as will have
in view the future growth of the city. Temporary
expenses for such purposes cannot but be wasteful
of money, aid therefore unwise, as a more ample
reservoir with corresponding facilities for keeping it
filled, should, in my judgment, be constructed. I
commend again to the attention of Congress
the subject of the removal i from their pres
ent location of the depots of the several railro.ds
entering the city, and I renew the recommendation
of my former messages in behalf of the erection of
a budding for a Congressional Library, the comple
tion of the Washington monument, and of liberal
appropriations in support of the benevolent, re
format. and penal institutions of the District.

TRAVELING HUMAN NATURE.
" There are perhaps few things which one
comes across in everyday life better calcu
lated to give an insight into the weaker
side of human nature than the Visitor's
Book kept at a Continental hotel. In it
one sees the obvious wish of the writer to
present himself or herself to the world in
some particular light. It need scarcely be
said that the form adopted is not generally
that of self-abasement. Thus the signa
ture of "J. C. Colman, M. P., pour Nor
wich," at an obscure town on the Simple
road, points unmistakably to the newly
fledged member of Parliament, anxious to
dazzle the world with his rank and impor
tance. Mr. Colman may or may not be a
portion of the British Legislature, but in
any case the fact can scarcely be of much
interest to the dwellers in the Southern
Alps, and still less to the travelers who
may follow in his footsteps. " : .
Another entry in the same book refers
to the advent of a "citizen of the Great Pie
public, and runs as follows; " W. Holden,
United States of America, arrived : with
four-in-hand." .. There j is something about
this lost which one can hardly help liking,
it is so plain and outspoken. 7; It says : "I
am a bragging, upstart Yankee, and I don't
care who knows it." Mr. Holden, when
blossoming on the free soil of America, is
no doubt, in the language of Mr. Lafayette
Kettle, "as remarkable a man as any in
the country," but it was hardly worth
while to publish the precise manner in
which he revealed himself to the admiring
eyes of villagers of the Tyrol. fj Next we
have apparently an Egyptian, in the per
son of a traveler who signs himself ."Jules
Guichard, Directeur, Administration Canal
de Suez." - Following him in the : same
book is the signature of one of the most
distinguished Frenchmen of modern times.
It is simply "Leon Gambetta, Avocat." , -
A lady, either anxious to show her im
portance, or desirous of proving that she ia
not guilty of the impropriety of traveling
alone, or both, describes herself as " Mis 3
Cummins and domestique."
Three American young ladies at an inn
at the village of Simplon fill in the column
of the book headed "Occupation,", with
the words," Looking for a Husband." ... ,
7 One of the most noteworthy features in
these books is the tendency of the writers,
more especially lof j those - of Anglo-Saxon
race, to mix up two or : three languages in
the half dozen words which they think it
necessary to write. Thus, in addition to
the above, " Laurence G. Boggs" adds to
his signature the expression | " Etats-
d'Amerique ;" Mrs. E. Shorter, " Londres,
Angleterre," and Mr. Irvinger, "tres sat
isfait." Again, Lycurgus B. Smith tells
us that he is en route -pour Rome, "and
Mr. Epaminondas Brown that he is "parti
for California." 7
It is difficult to avoid smiling at these
little eccentricitioa of the human race, and
if perpetrating them affords pleasure to the
perpetrators it assuredly does no one else
any harm. V Traveling is said to ; be one
means of improving people's minds and
adding to their intelligence, . If I so, there
can be no | doubt ' that there is with many
people ample . need of both. — [Egyptian

FOREIGN FACTS.
7An English writer in the Contemporary
Review declares that "the American now ,
regards' the Canadian .with a kind of half
contemptuous indifference."
7 S. Mori oy,' 2l. P., asserts that "medical
men are every day strengthening in their
testimony that alcohol or intoxicants are
absolutely valueless as food.'' "" "*: 777.-
A French monk has been imprisoned for
a month for remarking to one of his com
rades that the Paris police, during the re
cent expulsion of the Jesuits, were like
dogs following the Holy Sacrament. 77*77.
Gladstone's son Herbert, who is a mem
ber of Parliament, ' says . that although the
English aristocracy is the best and the
noblest of all aristocracies, still it * would
not be wise to suppress democracy. 7
! The London Times pronounces it scan
dalous that police discipline and public de

render an evening's ' stroll for women of

Mrs. Sarah Way died at her home, '■■ No.
7 Fremantle Place, Kingsdown, Bristol,
England, a few weeks ago, at the advanced
age of 104 years and 10 months. Her
eldest son died about eight months ago,
aged 78 years.
S. C. Hall, in some words of farewell on
his retirement from the editorship of the
London Art Journal, which he started 42
years ago, writes : "I do not think the
history of literature supplies a parallel
case — that of an editor commencing a publi
cation, continuing to . edit it during 42
yeara, and retiring from it when it had at
tained vigorous age— its value augmented
and not deteriorated by time."
. It is rare, says a Paris correspondent,
for French brides to shed tears ; but Mile.
Samary, the actress, did at her recent
marriage with M. Paul I.agarde, the only
son of a rich stockbroker. The pulpit
stairs and even the pulpit of the J Made
leine were filled with pretty actresses, who
crowded to see the bride. . She entered
leaning on the arm of her father, the
violoncellist Samary, and was beautifully
dressed in ivory satin and orange blossoms.
Mile. Barretta, in an opal blue and silver
toillette, was bridemaid. None of the
bridegroom's family was present. In the
sacristy the whole company of the Theater
Francais defiled before the bride, whom
the actresses embraced, and the actors
saluted by kissing her hand.
James Russell Lowell remembers that
thirty years ago Thackeray said to him,
" Carlyle is my master." The other day
he saw in a magazine that Buskin makes
the same observation. This coincidence,
the difference between Thackeray and Rua
kin being remembered, only showed, he
thought, the universality of Carlyle's influ
ence. He meant to say that Carlyle ap
proached different men on different sides,
which was one of the strongest marks that
could be mentioned of genius. Carlyle
had found an approach to their intellects
and to their hearts to the intellects and
hearts of a great variety of men of different
nations. He had introduced a new style
a peuuliarly English style of looking at
things, quite as much as Sir Walter Scott
introduced a new style of novel-writing.
Sir Walter Scott, he considered, was the
greatest story-teller of the age. Carlyle
had the surprising gift of expressing poetic
thought in prose.
THE SEVEN SLEEPERS BY THE LOIRE.
The Seven Sleepers i are said to have
come as pilgrims from the far East —
according to the usual version— that they
might receive the blessing of St. Martin.
They found the saint passing most of his
time in a small cavern. They occupied
one near it. One day they received from ,
St. Martin the eucharist, and presently
fell asleep. There was no appearance of
death ; they remained in a breathless, mo
tionless slumber for weeks, months ; and
then, though there was no decay, it was
thought right to lay them in hollow rock
tombs. And here I was shown the seven
graves cut in tho floor ; each is shaped
somewhat like all the Templars' tombs.
At the door of the grotto there was a tomb
of great antiquity, covered by a stone slab
which left a hole at one corner. Looking
through this I perceived a skeleton which
had no coffin. It is not improbable, there
fore, that these graves have been repeat
edly used for hermits of speci il sanctity.
After they passed from their living to their
literal burial, these saintly solitaires have
often for the first time begun to exercise
influence upon men. Legends take root
in "their graves, floating fables adopt them
as fathers, and" so ultimately they rise
again as myths, their bones are distributee!
aa charms, and they enter upon a more
real existence than when they dwelt above
the sod as if they were already beneath it.
On the ceiling of the Seven Sleepers'. Grot,
when I saw it in the summer of 1873, there
were still discernible the fading splendors
of the sky and heavenly bodies with which
it had been decorated. But whoever may
slumber, Time and Nature sleep not. 7 The
front of tbe chapel has been designed by
M. l'Abbe Brisacier, in accordance with a
structure which existed in the same place in
the eleventh century. During the severe
winter which preceded, the ceiling of the
cave had fallen aa it fell twice before (in the
eleventh and again in the seventeenth cen
tury) and of all the interior decorations I
could now discover only a lily, a star, a
faint tinge of blue sky. These decorations
had been. copied. from the earliest ages t
The fall of this roof and removal of the
debris laid bare a large number of bones,
some of which were iv such a position as
to be almost of geological interest. It
looks as if so early as the tenth century,
perhaps, the place was regarded as a sa
cred one for burial. The catastrophe
brought out the fast that the ingenious
Abbe Brisacier, of Tours, bad about the
same . time V discovered in the episcopal
archives the names of the Seven Sleeper?.
These names will now be connected with
seven figures, which will have to be
evolved from somebody's inner conscious
ness, on seven stained windows now being
made for the little chapel which has been
built. The names, which have been kindly
sent me by the Abbe Br'nacier, are Clem
ens, Primus, Lii-tus, Theodorus, Cyriadiua,
Godantius and Innocentius. Yon great
gateway of Marmoutier, from " which " Ur
ban: 11. 7 preached * the '. crusade, V and j) so
earned such aaiutship as the nineteenth
century Vatican can recognize, is a noble
piece of architecture, but it has beneath
its turret an oubliette, . recently ( sealed,
down which human victims were hurled to
a depth not yet fathomed ; there are two
westward towers also that are graceful ;
but it was the place of execution when the
lords of ; Marmoutier were the judges, and
they seem even now studded with human
heads. • The glory of this, the oldest and
most aristocratic convent in Northern Eu
rope, after all, hovers about these grottoes,'
where Gatien and Martin and dear St. Pat
rick passed much of their time.
Serenading 7 the ;-. Wrong 7 Man.-— An

is related that arrangements > were I made

was about to appear on the - balcony, and
address the '] band i and ; crowd, j- when' Mr. '
Bishop drove up to the hotel with several
friends. The ex-Governor, with the calm
ness of a* great man, took the /serenade to
himself, and, rising in the carriage, .bowed
gracefully and responded ioji characteristic
speech. v The band •' dispersed," the ex-Gov
