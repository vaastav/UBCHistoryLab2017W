OŸ THE
President's Message.
The President in hie message at the
opening of Congress on last Monday, con
gratulates the country on the gratifying
condition of our foreign relations. What
«light differences have arisen during '.he
vesr have already been settled or are in a
fair way of adjus: ment. Ot the Irish ar
rests he says a somewhat extended corres
pondence with Great Britain has been held
on that subject, and a disposition to respect
our rights has been shown by the release of
the arrested parties.
Of the Isthmus canal the President says:
The claim of this nntion in regard to the
suprrvision and control of the inter-oceanic
canal across the American Isthmus has
continued to be the subject of conference.
It ii likely that time will be inure powerful
than discussion in removing the divergence
between the two nations, whose friendship
is so clearly cemented by the intimacy of
rrlationa and the community of their Inter
ests.
The Russian persecution of Hebrews is
dwelt upon.- A courteous remonstrance
from tills country 'was amicably received.
The President believea the time is not far
distant when. Russia will be able to secure
toleration to all religious faiths.
The protection of submarine cables is
now the subject of an intei national confer
ence at Paris, and our Minister to France
is attending as a delegate. The President
recommends that discretion be vested with
the Executive to send delegates to any Im
portant foreign conventions and that mon'
ey be provided to pay the expenses.
Attention is calked to the onerous fines
imposed by Spaln and . her colonies upon
United States vessels for trivial technical
offenses against local regulations. Com
plsint is also made of the excessive fees de
manded- by Spanish consuls in American
ports, whfch amount to ai considerable ex
port dutv.
The German Government has invited
the United States to participate in an inter
national exhibition of domestic cattle, to be
held at Hamburg. In July, 1883. An appro
priation is asked for that purpose.
The death of Mr. Marsh, our laid Minis
ter to Italy, is deplored In fitting terms. The
extradition treaty with Belgium, which has
been In operation eighteen years, has been
replaced by another. Negotiations are in
progress with Switaerland with the view to
a treaty to determine whether a cltisen of
that republic enn renounce his allegiance
and become naturalised in the United Slates.
The deportations of paupers from certain
Swiss cantons to this country has substan
tially ceased
On the Chinese restriction act the mes
sage says: The recent legislation restrict
ing the immigration of laborers from China,
lias given rise to the Question whether citl
uns of China proceeding to or from anoth
er may lawfully pass through our own. In
construing the'act of May 6th, 1882, in con
nection with the treaty of Nov. ist 1880,
the restriction would seem to be limited to
Chinese immigrants coming to the United
States as laborers, and should not forbid'a
mere transit across our country. I ask the
attention of Congress to the subject for such
action as may be deemed advisable.
The return of the indemnity fund to
China and Japan is recommended. The
treaty lately concluded with Corea awaits
the action of the Senate. During the late
disturbance in Egypt through the timely
presence of American vessels protection
was afforded the persons and property of
many o,' our own citizens and those of oth
er countries, whose governments have ex
pressed their thanks for the friendly ser
vice.
The reciprocacy treaty with Hawaii,
which becomes terminable in September
next, receives due attention, and an enlarg
ed diplomatic intercourse with San Do
mingo is recommended. The lawlessness
existing on the Texas border Is deprecated,
and legislation for its suppression recom
mended. The establishment of an interna
|ionai boundrv between the two republics
i» recommended, and money asked to make
the survey.
SOUTH AMERICA.
Our relations with Venezuela continue
unchanged. Action is asked on the pend
ing awards against that country. The
United Stetes is invited to send representa
tives to Caraccas in July next to the cen
tennial celebration of the birth ol Bolivar,
tile founder of South American independ
ence, on which occasion it is designed to
commence the erection of a statue of Wash
ington and open an industrial exposition, to
w hich American products will be admitted.
The President requests that this count™
lie repsesented and suitable provision made
The^recent Chili-Peru embrogllo Is re
hearsed at some length. In January last
this country sent a special mission to tue
belligerent powers to snggest that Chili ac
cept a money indemnity and refinquish
her demand for territory. To tills Chili re
fused to accede. The intervention of this
country could go no further without en
dangering our peaceable relations. 1 lie ter
ritory of Peru has been partitioned, and any
protest against this harshness of the victor
nation would need to be backed up with an
anned force. It is to be regretted that Chill
exacts such rigorous conditions, and is so
Indisposed to submit to arbitration the
terms of an amicable settlement.
Some time ago invitations were sont to
tiie various American countries to send
representatives to a peace Congress to
>* held in Washington in November last.
This being an unusual exercise of executive
P'nver, the President last April asked the
opinion of Congress upon the proposed
meeting. No action was taken on the mat
,er nor anv provision made to meet the ex
penses. 'Accordingly he postponed the
«inference and notified the powers interest

DIPLOMATIC CHANGES.
Changes have occurred in the diplomatic
representation of several foreign P powers
during the last year. New ministers from
™ Argentine Republic, Austria, Hunenrv
C . hina 'j F D ance ' J a P an > Mexico^
j® Netherlands and Russia have present
ed their credentials. The mission bf Den
mark and Venezuela at this capital have
been raised in grade, Switzerland has crea
ted a plenipotentiary mission to tills
Government, and an Embassy from Mada
gascar and a minister from Siam will short
ly arrive. Our diplomatic Intercourse has
been enlarged by the establishment and re
lations with the new kingdom of Sierra, by
a mission to Siam, and by the restoration
of the mission to Greece. A charge d'af
faires will shortly be sent out to Persia
the representatives of Great Britian have
hitherto protected the rights of our citizens
in that empire.
Legislation is recommended to place this
country in harmony with other powers
with respect to the international rules for
the prevention of collisions at sea. Monev
is asked to enable the Smithsonian Insti
tute, under the Department of State, to
make an exchange of official publications
with the leading European powers in ac
cordance with an agreement made in Paris.
The act of Congress making appropria
tions for the diplomatic and cousular serv
ice is warmly approved. It contemplates
the re-organization of both branches of
such service on a salaried basis, leaving the
fees to enure to the benefit of the Treasury.
Of the finances of the country the Presi
dent says it appears that the ordinary rev
enues from all sources for the fiscal vear
ended June 30th, 1882, were as follows:
From customs, $220,421,730.25; from inter
nal re v.,$ 147,497,595,45 ; from sales of public
lands, $4,753,140.69; from tax on circulation
and deposits on National Banks, $8,956,
766.45; from repayment of interest bv the
Pacific Rail wav Company, $840,554.37;
from sinking fund for Pacific R. ft.', do.,
$796,271.42; from customs, fees, fines, pen
alties, etc., $134.334,800; from fees, Consul
ar letters, patents and lands, $263,89997;
from proceeds of sales of government prop
erty, $314,959 85: from profits of coinage,
bullion deposits' and assays, $44,693 ; from
Indian trust funds, $575,243; from deposits
by individuals for surveying public lands,
$'23152,506; from revenues of District of
Columbia, $1,715,176.41 ; from miscellane
ous sources, $3,383,445.43. Total of ordi
nary receipts, 403,425,250.28.
The foreign commerce of the U. S. dur
ing the last fiscal year, including'imports
and exports of merchandise and special, was
a* follows ; Export merchandise, $750,742''
272; special $49417476; tot.il, $ 799 . 950,736
Import merchandisew$724,630,574 ; special.
$42477,390; total, $767,111,964. Excess of
exporte over imports of merchandise, $25.
.902,683. This, excess is less than it has
beeti before in any of the previous six years,
as appears by the following table for the
year ended June 30th : Excess of exports
over imports, pf merchandise, in 1876,
{ 176,796,434.81; 1877, $151,152,094; 1878,
207,814,234; 1879, $2^4,661.666; 1880,
$167,683,912; 1881, $259,712,718; 1882,
$25.902,603.
During the year there have been organ)
sed 171 national banks. Of these Institu
tions there are now in operation 2,269, a
larger number than ever before. The val
ue of their notes in actual circulation on
July ist, 1882, was $324,656,45a I com
mend to your attention the Secretary's
views in respect to the circulation, and to
the modes by which that result may, in
his judgment, be avoided.
On the coinage of silver dollars the
President savs; I have seen nothing to al
ter, but much to confirm the sentiments to
which I gave expression last year. A com
parison between the respective amounts of
silver dollars in circulation on November
ist, 1881, and 011 November ist, 1882 shows
a slight Increase of a million and a half dol
lars, but during the interval, there had been
in the whole number coined an increase of
26,000,000, and the S,ooo,ooo thus far mint
ed make a little more than 35,000,000 in
circulation.
The message refers at length to the rev
enues of the country, and the President
gives Ills views on the tariff, advising a
thorough revision of the tariff laws. The
revenue from customs for the fiscal year
ending J une 30th, 1879, amounted to $ 137,
000,000. It has in three succeeding years
reached first $186,000,000, then $198.000,
000; and finally, as has been already stated,
$226,000,000.
Indian affairs are referred to as follows:
From the report of the Secretary of War it
appears that the only outbreaks during the
past year occurred in Arizona and in the
southwestern pai t of New Mexico. They
were promptly quelled and the quiet which
has prevailed in all other parts of the coun
try has permitted such an addition to be
made to the military force in the region en
dangered by the Apaches that there is little
reason to apprehend trouble in the future.
Afler referring at considerable length to
the reports of the heads of departments,
the star route cases, the public service, po
litical assessments, and agriculture, the
message, uuder Us sub-headings leads:
POLYGAMY.
The results which have thus far attended
the enforcement of the recent statutes for
the suppression of polygamy in the territo
ri-s are aeported bv the Secretary of the
Interior. It is not' probable that any addi
tional legislation in this regard will be
deemed desirable until the effect of existing
laws shall be more closely observed and
studied. I congratulate you that the com
missioners under whose supervision those
laws have been put In operation are encour
aged to believe that the evil at which they
are aimed may be suppressed without re
sort to such radical measures as in some
quarters have been thought indispensable
for success.
THE TERRITORIES.
The close relations of the general govern
ment to the Territories preparing to tie
great States, mav well engage your special
attention. It is there that the Indian dis
turbances occur, and there that poly gamy
has found room for its growth. I cannot
doubt that a careful survey of the terr torial
question would be of the highest utility,
and life and property would he more sec-ure,
and the liability of outbreaks between Indi
ans and whites would be lessened. The
public domain would be more securely
guarded, and better progress be made in the
instruction of the young.
THE ELECTORAL COUNT.
Among the questions whfch bfi™ «*•",
the topic of recent debate in the halls of
Congress none are of greater grax ity than
n _, t0 ,he "»pertaining of the

from inability to discharge the powers and

termine these questions before another na
tional election.
BLESSING.
The closing year has been replete witli
blessings which we owe to the Giver of all
good for the uninterrupted harmonv of our
foreign relations, for the death of sectional
animosities, for the exuberance of our har
vests, and the triumph of our mining and
manufacturing interest, for the prevalence
of health, for the spread of intelligence and
conservation of the public interest, for the
growth of ttie country, all elements of na
tional greatness, for these and countless
other blessings we should rejoice and be
U? 1 *' ^ ' rus * " lat under the inspiration of
this great prosperity our counsels mav he
harmonious and that the dictates of pru
dunce, patriotism, justice and economy,
may be the adoption of measures in which
the Congress and the Executive may heart
lly unite.

The Transit of Venus.
Prof. Davidson telegraphs from Station
Cerro Poblero, via Los Cruses, New Mexi
co: The day opened clear, the sun was not
one diameter above the Organ Mountains,
when the first internal contact was observed.
The time was much later than predicted
The atmosphere at this altitude was un
steady. The atmosphere of Venus was
seen outside tile sun's limb. The second
internal contact was satisfactorily observed,
the atmosphere growing more steadv.
The altitude of the sun w as 4 y t degree's.
Micrometer measurements^were then made
between the limbs of the sun and Venus;
these were satisfactory During these
meusures the first group'of six photograph
plates wereexposed and gave sharp outlines
exhibiting the planet very well defined. At
ter the planet had advanced one diameter
on the body of the sun, photograph plate*
were exposed in groups of six every eight
minutes. The photographs are remarkably
fine and no single hitch occurred through
out the whole series. Whilst this work was
being done, micrometer measures of the
Polar and Equatorial diameter of Venus
were made with a double image microme'
ter. In the Equatorial and transit Instru
merits, the meridian transit of the first limb
of Venus and the last limb of the sun were
observed. The photograph groups were
finished about twenty minutes before the
third-contact, and give 219 splendid pictures.
When the micrometer measures were made
between the sun, the third contact interval
was observed with great precision, the
limbs of Venus and the sun being remark
ably sharp and well defined. Alter this con
tact, a part of the planets disc beyond the
aun'a border was partly surrounded by
white circles of light. The last contact, was
also observed with great precision. The
whole work has been an eminent success,
and not a single item has been missed In
the programme of the day's operations.
American Manufactures.
The total value of the manufactured prod
ucts of the Uuited States in the census year
of 1880 was $5,369,667,706. This was the
oatput of 253.840 establishments, requiring
a capital of $2,790,223,506 in their conduct.
The average number of hands employed
was 2,838,950; of these 2,025,279 were
males over 16 years of age. The total
amount paid in' wages was $947,919,674.
and the value of the material made up was
$3,394,340,026. Immense at these figures
are, they do not, we think, state the true
condition of our manufactories.
The Duty on Quinine.
In 1879 a heavy reduction was made in
the duty on quinine. Its immediate effect,
strange as it may sound, was to largely di
minish the direct importation of the bark
Into the United States. In iSygthe impor
tations into the United States were 46,700
packages. In 18S0 they dropped to 32.800,
and in 1881 to 31,400 packages. In Europe
the importations in 1879 footed up 64,420
packages. As soon as the duty was re
duced here they increased to 98,420 pack
ages in 1880 and 141,812 packages In 1881.
The explanation is simple. The removal
of the duty has made it impossible for the
American laboratories to compete with
those of Germany and France, and immense
quantities of manufactured quinine are now
being imported. It is stated .at while the
wholesale price of quinine has been reduced
the consumer of small quantities lias not
been benefited by it.
