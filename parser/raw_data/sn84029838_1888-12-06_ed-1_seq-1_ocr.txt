Tothe ConsrcM 0 the I mtrd btaUn:
Abjou assemble for tbe discharge of
the duties $ ouhave assumed, as the rep
resentatives of a free r.nd generous peo
ple, jour meeting is marked by nn inter-eef-ng
and impressive incident nud tbe
expiration of the p:es?ut session of con
gress, tbe first century of our constitu
tional esistence i:s c nation will be com
pleted. Oar survival for one hundre 1 jeara is
not enHicient to assure us trial. We no
longer liHve dangers to fear m the raBin
tainance with all its promised blessings
of a gov eminent fcnti Jed upon tLo freedom
of a people. lhe time ratner admonishes
to soberly inquire whether in the past
we have nlvvnjB closely kept
in the course of cafety and whether we
Lave before us 11 way plain and clear,
which leads to happiness and perpetuity.
The citizen of our republic in its early
days rigidly insisted on the comphiuce
with the letter and the law, otrBtcbing
out before him a cleir liald for individual
endeavor. Hia tnbuto to the support of
his government wad measured by the
cost of its charter, economical maintain
on ce, and he wa? secure in the enjoy
ment of the remaining recompenso of
I113 eteadv and contented adherence to it
in those da3. The frugality of the peo
ple was stamped npon thi-ir government
and was enforced by the free, thoughtful
end intelligent suffrage of the citizen.
Combination1!, monopolies and aggrega
tion of capital were either avoided or
sternly regulated and restrained. Tho
pomp nud glitter of governments less free
offered no ' -uptatiou and presented no
delusion to ice plain people who side by
side, in fnndly conp"tiiion, wrought fcr
the cnoblement and dignity of man, for
tbe solution of the problemof a free trrde
government and for tho achievement of
tha grnd dt-ptiny awaiting the land
which God had given them. A century
bat paspeJ, our cities aro the abiding
places of weslfb and luxury; our manu
factories yield fortunes never dreamed of
by the fctbprof tho republic our business
men are madly striving in the race for
riches. Immense aggregations of capi
tal outrun the imagination in the magni
tn Jo of their undertakings.
When tho experiment of our govern
ment was undertaken the chart adopted
for our guidance was the constitution. A
departure from the lme3 thero laid down
is failnre. It is only by a strict ndher
nca to the direction they indicate, nn 1
by rostr-.mt within the limitations they
lay, that we can furnish proof to the
world nf i h nhiliK f tli a Amannn-i npf.
pis for self irovernment. The equal nnd
exact justice, of which wo boast as the
underlying principle of our institution?,
ahnuld not be confined to the
relations of our cit;zns to each
other. Tim government itself
! under bond to the American people
that in the exercise of it functions and
powers it will deal with the body of our
ciliz"ns in o manner scrupulously honest
and absolutol just. It ha3 agreed that
American citizenship shall bo the only
credential necessary to justify the claim
of eqnnhty before the li.vv and that no
condition in life ehall givorise to dif crim
ination in tho treatment of the people of
their governient.
TWO l'lCTUEES.
"Wo view with pride- and satisfaction
this bright picture of our country's growth
nnd prosperity while only n closer scru
tiny develops a oombre thading. Upon
u more careful inspection we find tho
wealth nnd luxury of our cities mingled
witu povwtj and wretchedness and unra
mnuerate to it. A crowded and constant
ly increasing population suggests the
impoverishment of rural sections nnd
discontent with ngriculturni pursuits.
The farmer's 6on, not FStiefied with his
fhther'G simple nud laborious life, begins
the chase for eatilj acquired wealth.
BOKrLCS T1IUST3- TAB It,
He then denounced the aggregation of
money by trusts and fears that tho exibt

corporations which are calculated to
bring communism to tho land. Ho
thinks the surplus m the treasury 11 con
fitnnt menace -s tho people will rise to
throw off tho joke that places the uuuec
eseary burden upon them. He accuses
the government of entering into a part

poor are made to succumb to tho combi
nation nnd the love of country is stilled,
lie claims that the farmers are daily
growing poorer through the deterior
ation of their lauds and the lower

He saja the workingmen are crjing

A just nnd sensible revision of our tar
iff law should 1)3 made for the relief of
our countrymen who culler under the
present condition. Such a revision
f-hould receive the support of all who
lovo that jaetice of equality duo to Amer

this justice and equality our government
fiuds its strength and its power to protect
the citizens, nnd his property;
of all who brieve that the con

institutions than colossal fortunes nn
iitly gathered in tho hands of a few; of
nil who appreciate that the forbearnnce

rUCLIC USDS.
.Repeated recommendations have been
submitted for the nmecdmentVind change
of the laws relating to our public lands
to that their spoliation, and diversion to
'other uses than as homes for honest set
tlers might be prevented. While a meas
ure to meet this conceded necessity of
reform remains awaiting the action of
theoorgress many claims to tho pnb
lia lands nnd applications for " do
nations in favor of states end individuals
have been allowed.
THE INDIAN QUESTION-.
A plan in aid of li.dian management,
recommended by those well informed as
containing valuable features in further
ncco of the solution of the Indian prob
lem, has thus far failed of Iegilitiv?
sanction, while grants of doubtful expe
diency to railroad corporations permit
ting them to pass through Indian
reservations, have greatly multiplied.
rcnoc buildixgs.
The propriety and necessity of the
the erection of one or more prisons for the
confinement of United States convicts
and a postoffice building in the National
carital are not disputed, but these needs
jet remain unanswered while scores of
public buildings have b?en erected where
their necessity for public purposes is not
apparent.
rcjj'ioxa.
A revision of our pension laws could
easily be made which would rest upon
just principles and provide for every
worthy Hnp'icact, but while our general
pension lawa remain confuted and im
perfect hundreds of onr private pension
laws are annm.lly passed which are the
source of unjct discrimination and pop
ular demoralization.
ISTCISXATIOXAXi KEUTIOM
In pursuance of a constitutional pro
vision requiring the president, from time
to time, to give to the congress informa
tion of the fetr.to of tho Union, I lnva the
satisfaction to announce that the close of
the j ear finds tho United States ia the
enjoyment of domestic tranquillity and at
pe.icu with all tbe nations.
Since aj last annual messago our for
eign relations have been strengthened and
improve 1 by the performance of interna
tional good offices and by n6w and re
newed treatita of amity, commerce and
reciprocal extradition of criminals.
Those international questions which
still await settlement are all reasonably
within the domain of amicable negotia
tions, und there is no dispute between the
United Stac3 and any foreign power that
is not susceptible of satisfactory arrange
ment by frank diplomatic treatment.
CAXADl AST) TIIE milEBIES.
The questions between Great Britain
nnd the United States relating to the
rights of American fishermen under treaty
and international comity in the territo
rial water? of Canada, I regret to say, aro
not jet satisfactorily adjusted. These
matters were fully treated in my message
to the senate of February 20, 18b8, togeth
er witn wnicu a convention concmaea
under my authority with her majesty's
government on the 20th of February last,
for tho removal of all causes of misun
derstanding, was submitted bj'ine for the
approval of tho senate.
11 then reviews the history of tho re
jection of the treaty and his nction, nnd
states that nothing has occurred that can
be added to these facts.
Having essayed in tho discharge of my
dutj- to procure bj- negotiation the pet
tlement of a long standing cause of dis
pute, and to remove n constant menace to
the good relations of tbe two countries,
and continuing to the opinion that the
treaty has failed to receive the approval of
theFeu3te, did supply "a satisfactory
practical and final adjustment on a basis
honorable nnd just to both parties to the
difficult r.nd vexd question to which it
related," and having subsequently and
unavailingly recommended other legisla
tion to congress, which I hoped would
meet the exigency created by the rejeo-
; tiouof tho treaty, I now again invoke the
earnest and immediate attention of tbo
congross to the condition of tho impor
tant question ns it now stnnds before
them and tne country, nnd for tho settle

THE SACKV ILLE-WEST BLUNDER.
Narthe close of tho mouth of October
lasfbccurrences of n deeplj' regretablo
nature were brought to my knowledge
which made it ruy painful, but impera
tive, duty to obtain with ai httlo delay na
possible a nox personal channel of diplo
matic intercourse in the country with tho
government of Great Britain.
The correspondence in relation to thia
incident will in due course bo laid before
jou. nnd will disclose tho unpardonable
conduct of the official roforred to in his in
terference bj advice and counsel with the
iiUTBgs of American citizens in the very
crisis of the presidential election, then
ueir (it hand, nnd also in his subsequent
public dclirations to justify his action
superadding impugnment of the execu
tive nnd senate of the United Stnte3 in
connection with important questions now
pending in controversy between the two
gouts
The offence thus committed wa moat
grave, involving d sastroii'? possibilities
to the cood relations of the United States
nnd Great B'ltun, constituting a gross
breach of diplomitic privilege and an in
vasion of the purely domestic nlfaira es
sential to (he sovereignty of the govern
ment to which the envoj- was rceredited.
Having first fulfilled the just demands of
the international comity bv .ilTording full
opportnuity forhermajetj's government
to act iu lelief of tho situation I consid
ered a prolongation of the discussion to
be nnworrauted and thereupon declined
to further rtcgniza the diplomatic char
acter of tho person whoso continuauco iu
such function would destroy that mutual
confidence which is essential to the good
understanding of the two governments,
and wns inconsistent with the welfare
nnd self respect of tho government of the
United States. Tho unnal interchange
of communication has since continnt-d
through her majesty's legation in this
citv-.
TnEFURTRVDE.
My endeavors to establish, bj inter
national cojperation, measurea for tbe
prevention of the extermination of fur
seals inUennngsen. nave not been re
laxed and I have hope of being enabled
ehortlj- to submit an effective and satis-fastorv-
conventional project with the
marntime powers for the approval of tho
senate.
COAST BOUNDARIES.
The coastal boundary between onr
AlaEknn pcfsessians and British Colum
bia, I regret to e.ij', has not received tho
attention demanded by its importance
nnd which on sevarnl occasions heretofore
I have had the honor to recommend to
the congress.
THE SVMOAN ISLVNDS.
On tbo 12th of April last, I laid before
the honse of representatives full informa
tion repectiug our interests in Samoa,
and in the subsequent correspondence
on tho same subject which will be laid
bsfore von in due course, the history of
ovents in thoe islands will be found.
ME CHINESE QUESTION.
In n message, accompanying my ap
proval, on the 1st day of October last, of
n bill for the exclusion of the Chinese, I
lirid before congress fnll information of
nil correspondence tonching the negotia
tion of the treaty with China, concluded
nt this capital on the 12th day of March,
1S83, and which having been confirmed
by the senate with certain amendments,
was rejected by the Chinese gov
ernment Thia message contained a
recommendation that a sum of money be
appropriated as a compaation to the
Chinese subject who suffered injuries nt
the handset lawless men within our
jurisdiction, such appoiatmnt having
been saade, awaits tbe action of the
Chinese Government
OTHER rOREIiW RELATIONS.
He touches on tho unfinished regula
tions with Japan nnd recommends that
indemnity be paid to th9 .Tapaneso who
were wounded by target practice at
Ikisimi. He touches lightly on the re
lations with Corea, Persia nnd Hajti and
of the latter says measures hive been
taken-for redre's ia cse of the American
vessel seized. Ho advocates the estab
lishment of a Gub marine telegraph to
Hawaii. Friendly relations hsvs
been had with all Central
and South American states.-" He
advises a careful revision of the naturali
zation laws nnd the laws regulating' the
issuance of passports.
TIIE CONSULAR SEBYTCE.
He advises the reorganization of ths
consular service, and thinks the number
should be greatly reduced.
THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION.
Preparations for the centennial celebra
tion on April SO, ,1839, of the inauguration
of George Washington as president of tbe
United States, at the city of New York,
have been m3(lo by a voluntary organiza
tion of the citizens of that locality nnd
believing that an opportunity should be
iifforded for tho expression of the interest
felt throughout the country in the event,
I respectively recommend fitting and co
operative action by congress on behalf of
the people of tho United States.
CONDITION OF THE TREASURY.
The report of the secretary of the treas
uryexhibits in detail ttse condition of our
national finances and the operations of
the several branches of the government
related to his department.
The total ordinary revenues of the gov
ernment, for the fiscal ear ended June
30, 1838, nmonnt'd to 8379.200,071 7(1, of
which 219,091,173 7(1 was received from
customs duties, and $121,298,871.83 from
internal taxes.
Tho total receipts from nil sources ex
ceeded those for the fi'cil year ended
June CJ, 18S7, by S7,6C2,797.10. The or
dinary expenditures of the fiscal year
ending JuneSO, 1833, wereS29,(w3,95S 67,
leuving a surplus of 8179,612,116 19. The
decrease in tne expenditures as compired
with the fiscal jear ende 1 June 30, 1S37,
was S3 278,221 31, notwithstanding the
payment of more than five million dollars
for pensions in excas3 of what was paid
forthatpurpos6 inthe latter mentioned
year.
Tne revenues of tho government for the
year ending June 30, 16S9, ascertained
for the quarter ended September 30, 1883,
and estimated for tho remainder of the
time, amount to 8377,000,000, and tho ac
tual and estimated ordinary expenditures
for the same year wore $273,000,000,
leaving an estimated 6urp!ua of $101,
CO0.O0O.
The daily purchases of bonds were
commenced on the 231 day of April, 1883,
I nnd have continued until the present
time guu by tuis plan bonds of the gov
ernment not jot due, have been purchas
ed up to, and including the 30th day of
November, 1S83, amounting to 891,700,
100, tho premium paid thereon amount
ing to S17,C03.01303
He then givea a resume of the purchase
of bonds nnd coinage of silver as shown
in the treasurers report nnd earnestly
recommends the suspension of the furth
er coinage of silver.
TIIE WAR DEPARTMENT.
reviews the report of the secretary of
war. I earnestly request that the recom
mendations contained m thesecretarj's
report, all of which are in my opinion
calculated to increase the usefulness nnd
discipline of the nrmj may receive the
consideration of congress. Among
these the proposal that there should be
provided n plan for tbe examination of
officers, to test their fitness of promotion,
is of the utmost importance. Thia re
form has been before recommended in the
reports of tho secretary and its expe
diency is co fully demonstrated by the
argument he presents in its favor that its
adoption should no longer be neglected.
THE DEVTH OF SHEBIDC.
The death of General Sheridan m Au
gust last, was a national affliction. The
army then lost the grandest of its chiefs;
the country lost u brave and experienced
soldier, r. wise and discrete counsellor,
and a modest nnd sensible man. Those
who in any manner came within the
range of hia personal association, will
never fail to paj' deserved nnd willing
homage to tho greatness nnd tho glory of
his career, but the- will cherish with
more tender sensibility, the loving mem
ory of his simple, generous and consider
ate nature.
He refors to the condition of the Apa
ches, and opposes their return to their
reservation.
THE NAVr.
He reviews the report of the pecretarj
of the navy. He congratulates the coun
try upon the improved methods that have
been introduced in that department.
1'OSTAL AFrAIES.
The report of the postmaster general ia
reviewed nnd tbe recommendations are
urged upon congress.
A clas3 of postnl employes whose con
dition seems to demand legislation is
that oi the clerks in the poslollioa and I
call especial attention to the repeated
recommendations of the postmaster gen
eral for their classifications. Proper leg
islation of this character for the
relief of 'the carriers in tho
free delivery service has been
frequent. Provision ia made for their
promotion, for substitutes for them, for
vacation for holidays and limiting their
hours of labor, beven million dollars
hns been appropriated for tho current
j ear to provide for them. Though thi
total number of offices where they are
employed is but 35S for the past fiscal
j ear, an estimated increase for the current
j ear of but forty, while tbe total appro
priations for all clerks in the offices
throughout the United States is S3,930,
000 The legislation affecting the statutes
of the Government with the rcil
roads is iu ecu of revision.
While for the most part, the railroad com
panies throughout the country have cor
dially co-operated with the poctofb'ce
department in rendering exaltant service,
vet under the law as it stands while the
compensation to them for carrjing tho
mail is limited nnd regulated, and al
though railroads are made post roads by
law, there is no authority reported any
where to compel tho owner of a railroad
to take Hnd carrj" the United States mail.
The only alternative provided by net of
congress in casoof refnal is for the post
master general to send mail forward by
pony express. This is but an illustration
of ill fitting legislation, reasonable nnd
proper at the time of its enactment, but
long since outgrown ana requiring reaa
jnstment. It is gratifying to note from the care
fully prepared statistics cccompanjing
the postmaster general's report, that not
w thstauding the grent expansion of ser
vice the rate of expenditure has been les
sened nnd efficiency has been improved
in every branch, that fraud and crime
have decreased, that losses from the mails
have ben reduced, and that tbe number
of complaints made to postmasters and to
the department are rar less man ever De
fore. DEPARTMENTS OF JUSTICE.
The transactions of tho departments of
justice for the fiscal year ended June
30, 18S8, nre contained in the
report of the attorney general, as
well as a number of valuable
recommendations, the most of
which are repetitions of those previously
made and ought to receive consideration.
It is stated in the report that judgements
in civil suits amounting to $552,021.08
-were recovered in favor of the govern
ment. During the year only tbe sum of
$32,931 was collected thereon, and that
thorough fines and penalties, and failures
were imposed amounting to $541,80343
only S109.41S.42 of that sum was paid on
account thereof. These facts may fur
nish an illustration of the sentiment
which extensively prevails that a debt
due tbe government should cause no in
convenience to the citizen.
THE INTERIOR DETABTMENT.
In the report of the secretary of the in
terior, which will be laid before you tho
condition of the various branches of our
domestic affairs connected with that de
partment and its operations during the
past year, are folly exhibited. Bat a
brief reference to some of the subjects
discussed in this able and interesting re
port, can be tere made, but I recommend
the entire report to the attention of con
gress and trust that tho sensible and val
uable recommendations it contains will
secure careful consideration. I
cannot too stearnly insist on
tho importance of popular meas
ures to insure a right disposition
of our public lands, not only as a matter
of present justice, but iu foreeact to con
sequences to future generations. The
broad, rich acres of our agricultural
plains have been long preserved bv- na
ture to become her untrammelled gift to
a people civilized and free, upon which
should rest, in well distributed owner
ship, tbe numerous home3 of enlightened,
equal and fraternal citizens. AVecame
to national possesion with the varning
example in onr eyes of the entailment of
inequities of the landed proprietorship
which other countries have permitted and
still suffer. Wo have no e xcuse for the
violation of principles cogently taught
nor for the allowance of
pretexts which have sometimes
exposed our land to cilossal greed laws,
which open a door to fraudulent acquisi
tion. An administration which permits
favor to rapacious seiznre, by a favored
few, of expanded areas that many should
enjoy, is accessory to offences against
our national welfare and humanity and to
be severely condemned or punished.
It is gratifying to know that something
ha3 been done at least to redress the in
juries to our people nnd check ths peril
ous tendency of the reckless wastes of the
national domain; that over eighty mil
lion acres have been arrested from illegal
usurpation, improvident grants and
fraudulent entries nnd claims to be taken
from the homesteads of honest industry.
Although less than the greater nreas
thus unjustly lost, it must afford
a profound gratification to right feeling
citizens, n3 it ia a recompense for the la
bors and struggles of the recovery. Our
dear experience ought sufficiently to urge
tbe speedy enactment of measures of
legislation which will confine tho further
disposition of our remaining agricultural
landa to the use3of actual husbandry nnd
genuine homes.
WILD LAJtDS.
Nor should our waste trnclo of co
called desert land be yielded up to the
monopoly of corporations or grasping in
dividuals, as appears to be much tbe ten
dency under the existing statutes. These
landa require but tho supply of water to
become fertile r.cd productive. It is a
problem of great moment, how mor
liselyfor the public good that facto
shall be furni-hed. I cannot ut think it
perilous to suffer either those lands or
the sources of their irrigation to fall in
to the hands of mocoplie?, which by
snch means, may exercise lordship over
areas dependent on their treatment for
productiveness. Already steps have
been taken to secure accurate and scien
tific information of the conditions which
are the prime basis of intelligent nction.
Until this shall bo gained the course of
wisdom appears cle3rly to be iu n sus
pension of futher disposal to create rights
antagonistic to tho common interest. No
harm can follow this cautionrry conduct
The land will remain nnd the public good
presents no demnnd for hastj- dis
possession of national ownership r.nd
control.
I commend also the recommendations
that appropriate measures be taken to
complete the adjustment of the various
grant3 umde to the states for internal in.
provments, and of swamp nnd overflowed
lnnc.lt?, as well n3 to adjudicate nud finally
determine the validity and extent of the
numerous private ir.nd claims All these
are elements of great injustice and peril
to tbe settlers npon tho localities affect
ed, nud now that their existence cannot
'o nvoided.no duty i-j more pressing than
j fix, as soon ns possible, their bounds,
and terminate the threats of trouble
which arise frtm uncertainty .
THE INDIANS.
The condition of our Indian popula
tion continues to improve nnd the proofs
multiply that tho transforming change, so
much to be desired, which shall substi
tute for barbarism, enlightenment, and
civilizing education ia iu favorable pro
gress. Our relations with these people
during the year have been disturbed by
no serious disorders, but rather marked
by a better realization of their true in
terests nnd increasing confidence and
good will. These conditions testify to
the value of the higher tone of considera
tion and humanity which has governed
the latter methods of dealing with them,
nud commends its continued observance.
Allotments in several ity have been
made on some reservations until nil
those entitled to land thereon have bad
their shares assigned, nnd the work is
still continued, in directing tbe execu
tion of this duty, I have not aimed so
much at rapid dispatch as to secure just
and fair arrangements which shall b'Gt
conduce to the objects of the law, by pro
ducing satisfaction with tho allotments
made. The measure of general effect has
ever been entered, or from which more
may be fairly hoped, if it shall be dis
cretely administered. It proffers oppor
tunity and inducement to the independ
ence of spirit and life which the
Indian peculiarly need?, whilo nt the same
time tne inalienability oi title nttords se
curity against the risks his inexperi
ence of affairs, or weakness of character,
may expose him to, in dealing with
others.
orExiNo trr Tnn territory.
Whenever begun upon any reservation
it should be msde complete, eo that nil
are brought to the same condition and as
soon ns possible community in lands
should cease, by opening such na remniu
unaliottej to settlement. Contact with
the ways of industries and successful
farmers will perhaps add n healthy emu
lation which will both instruct and stim
ulate. But no agency for the amelioration of
this people appears to mo so promising
aa the extenciou urged by the secretary
of such complete facilities of education
as shall at the earliest pnssible day em
brace all teachable Indian youth of both
sexes and retain them with a kindly
and beneficent bold until their char ic
ters are formed and their facultiea trained
to the sure pursuit of some form of useful
industry. Tbe capacity of tho Indian no
longer needs demonstration. It ia estab
lished. It remains to make the most of
it, and when that shall be done the curse
will be lifted, the Indian race saved and
the sin of their oppression redeemed. The
time of its accompl shment depends upon
the spirit and justice with which it shall
be prosecuted. It cannot be too soon for
the Indian nor for the interests and good
name of the nation.
He reviews the Sioux question and
urges the acceptance of the secretary's
suggestions in regard to the various res
ervations. CONCERNING PENSIONS.
The number of pensioners added to
the rolls during tho fiscal year ended
June 30, 18S i, is C0,25J, an jncraase of
pensions was granted in 45,716 cases.
The names of 15,730 pensioners have
been dropped from tho rolls during the
year for various causes and at the close of
the year the number of persons of all
classes receiving pensions was 452,557.
Of these there were 806 survivors of the
war of 1812, 10,787 widows of those who
served in taat war; 16 060 soldiers of the
Mexican war, and 5,104 widows of said
soldiers. I an thoroughly convinced
that our general pension laws should
be revised and adjusted to
meet as far as possible in
tho light of our experience,
all meritorious cases. The fact that one
hundred and two different rates of pen-.
sionsarepaid cannot,. in my opinion, be
mEde consistent with justice to the pen-
sioners or to the government, and the nu
merous private pension uula ilia: aro
passed predicated upon the imperfection
of general laws, while they increase,
ia many cases, existing inequality
and injustice, lend additional
forco to the recommendation for a re
vision of the general lawa on this subject
The laxity of ideas prevailing among a

various precedents be continned, if tho
grnnting of penrions benot divorced from
partisan and other unworthy and irrele
vant considerations, and if the honorable
name of veterans unfairlj-becomes, -by
these means, but nnother term for one
wiA constantly clamors for the aid of the

will be done to the fame nnd patriotism
of many whom our citizens nil delight to

for pensions.
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
The deparmeut of agriculture has con
tinued, with a good measuro of success,
its effjrt to develop and oalarge the re
sulfa and augment the profits of Ameri
can husbandry. It has collected and die.
tributed practical iDformation.introduced
and tested new plants, checked the
spread of contagious disease of farm
animals, or rested the abundance of noxi
ous insects and destructive f ungin growth
and sought to secure to agricultural labor
the highest reward of effort, and the full
est immunity from loss. Its record of
tbe j ear show that the season of 18S3,
has been one of medium product. A
generous supply of the demands o! con
sumption has been assured and n surplus
for the exportation, moderate in certain
products bountiful in others, will prove
u benefaction alike to buverand growor.
THE CATTLE PLAQUE.
Four years ago it was found that the
greit cattle industrj of the country was
endangered and thousands engaged in it
were alarmed at tho rapid extension of
tho European lung plague of pleura
pneumonia. Seriou3 outbreaks existed
u Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky and
in Tennessee nniraals affected were held
quarantine. Five counties in New
York, from one to four counties each in
the states of New Jersey, Pennsyl
vania, Delaware and Jlarjland
were also equally r.ffected. With
this great danger upon us nnd
with the contagion already in the chan
nels of commerce, with the enormous end
indirect losses already being caused by
it, nnd when only prompt and energetic
fiction could be successful, there were iu
nono of these states any laws authorizing
this department to erndicato lb malady,
or giviug tho state officials power to co
operate with it for thia purpose Tho de
partment even lacked both tho requisite
appropriation and authority.
By eeenring state co operation in con
nection with authority from congress the
work of eradication his been passed suc
cessfully and tho dreaded disease has
been extirpated from the western states
and nleo from the eastern state, with the
eicepuon of a few restricted ureas which
are still under supervision. The danger
has been removed und trade and com
merce have been freed from the vexatious
state restrictions which were deemed nec
essary for n time.
TnE SUGVR INTERESTS.
During the past four years the process
of diffusion, us applied to the manufac
ture of sugar from sorghum and wigp.r
cr.no, baa been introduced into this coun
try and fully perfected by the experi
msuta carried ou by the department of
agriculture. Tni3 process was univer
sally considered to be the most ecoromi
cal one, and it is thought that the sor
ghum industry has been established upon
a firm basis, nnd tho road to future sne
cess opened. The adoption of tbn diffu
sion process is also extending in Louisi
ana and other euar producing pirta of
the country ,nnd will doubtless be the only
method employed for the extraction of
sugar from cane.
TOOD ADULTERATION.
One exhaustive 6tudy has also within
the'eame period been undertaken of the
subject of food adulteration and the best
analytical methods for detecting it. A
part of tho result of tho work hsa already
been publiehed by tbe department which,
with tbo matter in course of preparation,
will make tbe roost completo treatise on
that subject that Gvr has been published
in any country. Tho department seeks a
progressive development. It would
combino the diecoverj of science with
the economics and (melioration of rural
practice. A supervision of the endowed
experimental station ojstem, rocentlj'
provided for, is a proper fuuetion
of the department and is now
in operation. Tbis supervision is very
important and should be wisely and vigi
lantly directed to the end that tbo peenn
iary aid of tho government in favor of in
telligent agriculture should be so ap
plied as to result in the general good nnd
to tho benefit of all our people, thus just
ifying the appropriations inado from the
public treasury.
RAILROADS AND LAND GRANTS.
The adjustment of the relations be
tween tho Government and the railroad
companies which have received land
grants and tho gunranty of the public
credit in and of the construction of the
reads should receive early attention.
STEAM R VILR0AD3 ON PUBLIC STREETS.
I again call attention to tbe present in
convenience and the danger to life and
property attending the operation of steam
railroads through and across the public
streets and roads of tho district. The
propriety of such legislation as will prop
erly conserve the use of these railroads
nnd batter secure tbe convenience and
safety of citizens is manifest.
AN IMPEEFCT STATEMENT.
Theconsciousness that I have present
ed an imperfect statement of the condi
tion of our country and its wants, occa
sions no far that anything omitted is rot
known nnd appreciated by tbe congress
upon whom rests tho responsibility of in
telligent legislation in behalf
of a great nation nnd a
confiding people. As public ser
vants we shall do our duty well if we
constantly gnnra tne rectitude of our in
tentiocs, maintain unsullied our love of
country, and with unselfish purpose strive
ror tne puoiio gooa.

VfAsuisoroN, D. C. Derember 3. The
following is a summary of the annual re
port of the intfcratate commerce commit
sioa: From the best information now available
tbo railroad mileage of the country on the
SCth day of Jane, 1SS3, is estimated at 52,
781, of whica ",:;12 miles hid been complet
ed and brought into operation within tho
six months preceding thit day.
Ihe number of corporation represented
ie 1.251, bnt, by reason of loaes or other
contract arrangements, many corporations
hold, control and operato one or more rosda
owned by other corporations, and the whole
number mnk'ug reports or operated at the
time named was CC5.
Tbo commtaion deplores tha rate wars,
and thinks that theso evils are magnified by
the custom of allowing subordinates to make
rates. On the subject of pooling and trusts,
the report soys:
It is reasonable to expect that carriers of
the country will, where practicable, make
eucn joint arraugement, so taat the paDlic
fhalt find an nrruusement with one ade
quate tor the purposes of any single transac
tion, l here Pnoniu oe some means or en
foro ng amoug carrier the obligations,
moral or leg 1, that wculd grow out of such
arrangements, lhe only effectual means
by u Inch good f aitb could be enforced was
the pooling of freight or earnings, but pool
lug is no oat of tueir power, being forbid
den by law. Th? tendency among railroads
seems likely to be in the direction of con
solidation as the only means of mutual pro
tection agaiDst rate ward, nut nuyining
equivalent to the creatiou of what is now,
technically denominated as trait, could
hardly be supposed possible, even if the
parties were at liberty to torm it at pleas
ure. If the parties ccnld come into harmony
on the subject, an arrancement of the sort
would be so powerful in it-t control ovtr the
business let ere-13 of the conntrj, and so
susceptible to uses for mNchevious pur
poses, that lubho policy could not
for a moment sanction it, at leapt,
unless by statute it were held in close legil
restraints and under public coutrol. Like
arrangements in other lin-n of business are
nlreauy sufficiently threatening to the pub
lic interest and the most ardent advocaio of
the concentration of railroad authority can
harul) expect that it will control tbe trns
portation of the country. LackiLg con
centration of authority, railroad can d-
much towards better relations with the pub
lic and the establishment of better relations
among themselves. Tho need ot this i
very imperative. In all the cutting of rates
tho rarty beginning it makes insinuations
agaiLSt its competitors. Carriers cuttme
rate3 have proclaimed thit the roJuctd
rates were all that could bs jntly demanded
when per-ons having experience knew that
pers.stenco in such rates would lead directly
to bankruptcy. An impartial observer is
compelled to say that such methods do not
belong to the present age. To make the
adversary feel and fear the power to millet
injury i often the first and principal thought
aud a rata ia cut, when in a rnder nge it
would t ave been a throat. The mo ive is
to obtain a right or ex ort a privilege, or
punish a wrong and irrespect ve of any
qutatioa whether there are cot legal reme
dies which are adequate for all purposes of
substantial justice. While this commission
is not at this time prepared to recommend
general legislation towatds the establish
ment and promotion of relations between
the carriers that fha'l bettor rn'jcerve the
public interest than thoie nhicharenow

The Srnats Tariff Kill.
Wasmnqtos, D. C, December 3. There
seems to be an agreement among tho re
publican leaders that tho eenata tariff bill
will be taken up the first thing this winter
and rnshed through to its passage in the
senate. Mr. Mckinley says so, and Senators
Allison and Spoonor mske the f arno declar
ation. The bill is now at the head of the
calender, na unfinished business and will
come up each day alter the morning hour.
.Moi-djy next the president's message and
the usual exchange of communication be
tween the liou-cs will occupy the dar. On
Tuesday it will bo tho duty of the providing
officer to lay tho unfinished business before
the senate at J o clock, ibis will be the
tariff bill, and it will depend on Senator
Allison, who has it in charge, whether its
consideration will be resumed on that day.
Before the adjournment of the laet session.
Senator Allison enid he would cill the tariff
bill up nt the earliest posib!e moment, and
he declared that he would resist any lenzthr
adjournment for the holidays in order to
facilitate its passage. Before leaving Iowa,
Senator Allison said that he would await an
intimation from the democratic leaders ia
tbe house, promising a proposition to agree
on a tariff bill, but while at Indianapoli,
and after a consnltation with General Har
rison last Tuesday, he is reported to have
returned to hia original programme ths
immediate consideration of tho republican
bill.
Regarding the general policy of the re
publicans touching the measure, he said
they might probably make some change in
it, but not any of importance, and the bill
wcnld remain substantially the same. Sena
tor Spoocer, who was with Senator Allison
in Indianapolis, made a f tatemenv similar
to that or Senator Allison, and these utter
ances indicate that it is the desire of Gen
eral Harrison and the purpose of tbe lead
era to puh the tariff bill through the senate,
and substantially in its present form. It
may. therefore, be expected that the senate
will take up the tariff bill thia week.
Chalmers and Harrison.
WAsmsoTOX, D. C, December 3. The
following special was sent to the New York
Herald from Indianapolis:
Senator Stewart stopped off here to shake
hands with General Harrison on his way to
Washington. General Chalmers, of Mis
sissippi, who arrived in the city, accom
panied Senator Stewart to General Harri
son's home, where the South and its t-oubles
were freely di'cucsed. When General
Chalmers returned to the hotel I obtained
from him the first direct expre-sion from
the preside it-elect upon his future policy.
The subject was introduced, as General
Chalmers says, by himtelf. He said ts
General Hirnon that all he deired to ask
from the administration was that it proviJe
for and insist on a fair election and a fair
count of the votes cast in the South. This
brought from General Harrison the follow
ing distinct statement, spoken in a forcible
a jd earnest manner: "It is fal'acyto re
cognize snch a thing as a southern ques
tion. While I am president of the United
States I shall only demand that the
people of the whole country shall obey
tbe laws of the nation without reference
to tbe section in which they may live. It is
an insult to me for the southern people to
intimate that it ia my desire to deal harsh
ly with them. It would also be an insult
to them fur me to anticipate that they da
not expect to obey the laws as they do and
shall exist"
General Chalmers was deeply interested
in General Harrison's manner and words,
and be sais that be is entirely satisfied that
the president elect will deal fairly with the
southern people.
"Away On tho Tr.ci."
Chicago, December 3, The Daily Kews
publishes an interview with Senator Far
well in which he is quoted as fajing:
"Aly visit to General Harrion was a so
cial one, of course, but be told me some
thing that shows that you newspapermen
are away off the track, as it were, in your
special allegatons regarding Protident-elect
Harrison's plans.
" 'Senator.' he said to me last Wednes
day, "I have got btg ears, and a Tery little
month; there is more talk about my alleged
intentions than 1 erer dreamed thsre could
be. Bat I will tell yoa one tbiDg, and fiat
is thi: I do not propose to offer, promise
or appoint any men to offices for some time
to come. Some of my predecessors, as coon
as elected, ndoit?d the coure of at once
malm? promis-s, and quieting this or that
faction by promises. Soaie of oar presi
dents succeeded to well that they give away
more ounces than they had at thstr disposal,
and th3 reult wa not exactly as they
wished. I shall do noth'ng of the kind. I
ehall look about mo, carefully examine ev
erything, and then be very deliberate about
my selections, making no promises that I
am not absolutely certain that I can fnlflll."
No l'evolt of Impurtanc.
S"nw Yoas, December 3. Tho Sun prints
nn interview with lscdmj democrats In the
(i. A. It. in var.ons parts of tho country. In
rsviewof theo intrrviBT-". it ajs: "The
movement for the withdrawal of dsmocratia
members of ths G. A. R , on the ground
that t'lo organization is ued to farther the
I ohtical ends of the republican party stems
to meet with httlo sympathy outside of In
ditna. where it began. Tne revolt has been
organized in Indianapolis, bet in 1.0 other
state have a'eps ia that direction been re
ported. Intotv.ews by iha Sun correspond
ents with many prominent democrats in the
Grand Army show that they will not join
fie revolt, that they had no idea fiat it
would be important. They distinctly contra
dict the psscrtion of General Palmer that
the Grand Army is an adj'cnct of tho repab
blicsn party; deny as an organization it has
any parti-an bia. Thsy nl'o siy there is
not room for another snc:e-sful organiza

seem to indicate that as a ruls the results of
the election haTe not shskoa the fealty of

however its individual members may vole.
It was organized and is maintained, they
believe, for non-political purposes.
An American Opinion uf Mexico
WAsniAoios, D. C. D;o 2. Mr. Thomas
B. Coanery, late Saeretary of the Legation
in Mexico is in the city. He speaks in
terms indicating a warm friendship for the
Mexican Government on J people, to whom
ho become friendly attached while at the
Mexican Capital. He says the Mrxicans are
not very welt understood by American, bs
cause they differ in their ide a on most
things from ns. Tbo Germans and the
French get along very we I with them, be
cause they pat up with delays that our peo
ple wojld not tolerate. He reports that
Mexico is making real progress. 1'hey have
men of great ability amoai: them nnd their
1're-idcnt is a good one. the Mcxicils are
slow to adopt new ideas nnd new custom,
and he ventures the opinion that those who
have built railroads into Mexico will not be
reirabcrsod for some tim-. The people do
not build towns ahout a station there as they
do in the United Mates, but get as far away
from n road as possib'o. Tho Mrxisans are
flow to sea the advantages of this great mod
ern ctvi'izer, but the roads must become
popular in coarse of lime.
Kates Advanced.
Chicago, Decembar 3 A meeting of the
managers of the lines in tho Central TraXc
association was held to consider tho ques
tion of restoring r.U east bound freight
rates. There was no difficulty in reaohiug
na ngrecrnet to advancj the rat j on grain
and provision! to the old rata of 25 aaJ 20
cents re-peotively, but when it came to re
storing rira-bel beef and live tck rites tho
trouble begin. The imnagers whoso op

of the causes leAdin to ti! drtwol beef

which were formed 7 allowed n ili.Terontnl
rats on dressed boef feel tint they are tti
t ed cow to ths same privileges, the contro

adjourned without reaching a conclusion,
but the sentmi'nt seemed to be that all

that rates would ba advancad, to take effect
abont December 12.
Trade nnd Flnanc.
Xew Toek, December 3. R. G. Dunn &
Co., in their weekly review of trade, say:
The ontso of gold, nnd the situation of
speculative markets cau-o lower prices in
almost every branch, bnt m stocks some
recovery has followed tho reports of now
asd important agreements between railroad
managers. 'Ihu r.se uveraiog about IVO

does not yet appoar to indicato n change of
tone. A combination on nn ontirely new
basis, for roads we-t of Jtncn,'0, is pro
posed, of wh.ch a vital feature, is nn entire
withJrnwal of tho power to make rates from
subordinates. Indeed, the clearing house
s:tume. if accepted literally, would virtualy
take the power from the olliceri of eac
road, Foparntely. and tlu henrty consent of
all competing lines being nece'sary the re
ports that one or moro will refuse to thus
surrender their power aeems to foreshadow
the failure of the plan.

Atuxtic Cm, N. J., November CO. Tho

shows that no such destruction to property
on this beach has been known since the in

localities have tome down fearing their
property would be swept away by water.
The tide receded and the sea. under the in

down, but tbe result, epo.ally in the lower

DrjBtis, November 2D. The report that a
second papal rescript had been sent to tbe

orce the commands contained in the first
rescript witaout alladmg to the existence of
the second one. But this plan was spoiled
through the indiscretion of a servan- cf the
bishop of Limerick, who divulged part of the
contents of tbe rescript. It is probable that
the pablicition of part of the dooomast will
force tbe pope to rea form publicly hia wishes'
regarding Ireland.
