ing of the message began. Close at

The reading was interrupted by ap
plause when the passage relating, to
legislation to put down anarchy,
trusts, and the reenaefment of the
Chinese exclusion law was reached.
The reading of the message in the
senate consumed two hours and fif
teen minutes and about the same
length of time in the house. At its
conclusion resolutions of respect to
the late President McKinley were
adopted, and as a further mark of
respect, both bodies adjourned.
Washington. Dec. S. Thb president
In Lis annual message to congress
tsays:
The congress assembles this year un
der the shadow of a great calamity.
On the Otli of September President Mc
Kinley was shot by an anarchist while
attending the Pan-American exposi
tion at Buffalo and died iu that city
on the Hth of that mouth.
Of the last seveu elected presidents
he is the third who has been murdered,
and the bare recital of fliis fact is
sufficient to justify grave alarm among
all loyal American citizens. Moreover,
the circumstances of this, the third as
sassination of an American president,
have u peculiarly sinister significance.
Both President Lincoln and President
Garfield were killed by assassins of
types unfortunately not uncommon in
history. President Lincoln falling a
victim to the terrible passions aroused
by four years of civil war and Presi
dent Garfield to the revengeful vanity
of a disappointed office seeker. Presi
dent McKinley was killed by an utter
ly depraved criminal belonging to that
body of criminals who object to ail
governments, good and bad alike, who
are against any form of popular lib
erty if it is guaranteed by even -the
most just and liberal laws and who
are as hostile to the upright exioncnt
of a free people's sober will as to the
tyrannical and irresponsible deiiot.
Anarchy and Anarchists.
The president continues, with, a
eulogy of Mr. McKinley, theii turns to
the subject of anarchy, denouncing its
doctriues and preachers. He says:
I earnestly recommend to the congress
that In the exercise vt-Als wise discre
tion it should take into consideration
the coming to this country of auarch
ists or persons professing principles
hostile to all government and justify
ing the murder of those irfaccd .In au-

tbority. Such individuals as those who
not Ion?: ago gathered in open meeting
to glorify, the murder of King Hum
bert of Italy penetrate a crime, and
the law should Insure their rigorous
punishment. They and those like them
should be kept out of this country, and
if found here they should be promptly
deported to the country whence they
fame, and farreaching provision should
be made for the punishment of those
who stay. No matter calls more
urgently for the wisest thought of the
congress.
A Subject For Federal Courts.
The federal courts should be given
jurisdiction over any man who kills
or attempts to kill the president or any
man who by the constitution or by
law is In line of succession for the
presidency, while the punishment for
an unsuccessful attempt should Ik? .pro-

portloiied to the enormity of the ot-
fense against our institutions.
Anarchy is a crime against the whole
human race, end all mankind should
baud against the anarchist. His crime
should bo made an offense against the
law of cations, like piracy and that
form of man stealing known as the
slave trade.
The president next considers busi
ness conditions, which he finds highly
satisfactory. He continues:
The tremendous and highly complex
industrial development which went on
with ever accelerated rapidity during
the latter half of the nineteenth cen
tury brings us face to face at the be
ginning of the twentieth with very
serious social problems. The old laws
and the old customs which had almost
the binding force of law were once
quite sufficient to regulate the ac
cumulation and distribution of wealth.
Since the industrial changes which
have so enormously increased the pro
ductive iver of mankind they are no
longer sufficient.
Trade Combinations.
The growth of cities has gone on be
yond comparison faster than the
growth of the country, and the up
building of the great industrial centers
lias meant a startling increase not
merely in the aggregate of wealth, but
in the number of very large individual
and especially of very large coriorate
fortunes. The creation of these great
coriorato fortunes has not been due
to Ihe tariff nor to any other govern
mental action, but to natural causes
in the business world, operating In oth
er countries as they operate in our
own.
The process has aroused much an
tagonism, a great part of which Is
wholly without warrant. It is not true
that as the rich have grown richer the
IKKir have grown poorer. On the con
trary, never before has the average
man. the wageworker. the farmer, the
small trader, been so well off as in this
country and at the present time. There
have been abuses connected with the
accumulation of wealth, yet it remains
true that a fortune accumulated in
legitimate business can be accumulat
ed by the person specially benefited
only on conditivn of conferring Im
mense incidental iK'netits ipon oth
ers. Successful enterprise of the tyie

from that displayed toward other

The first witness called was William

the Kenmore were usually arranged by
Mrs. ltonine. and that at these dunce
her liearing toward Ayres was nothing
cut of the ordinary. It had been her
habit, he said, when the dancers were
not prompt in their attendance, to po
to their rooms and urge them to come
down. Richard L. .Teuks said he heard
Mrs. Bonine giving Ayres advice
against drinking to excess. This was
the tenor of all the testimony given.

Berlin, Dec. 3. Count von Buelov,
the Imperial chancellor, yesterday in
Introducing the greatest parliamentary
struggle on the tariff bill that Ger
many has ever faced, counseled the
meinlHTs of the reichstag to modera
tion of language, declaring that the
eyes of the Avorld "were upon them.
Although, this was German's affair,
said Count von Buelow, it was neces
sary to maintain a resolute front to
the other nations of the world. Allus
ion was made to the United States, in
the course of the debate on the sub
ject, and the name "America is like
ly to lie yet more freely used by both
sides to this controversy, which is
moving Germany more deeply than has
any other civil question since the
?mergence of the empire.

The tariff experiences of the United
States and the pressure of American
competition constitute rich mines for
argument upon either side of the ques
tion. "Rrot wusher" (bread usury i. or

"This bill is the most important
which has been before the house for a
bug time, but It does not imply any
deviation from the polity in regard to
treaties of commerce.' said the imperi
al chancellor, at the opening of the, de
bate. The chancellor then proceeded
to say that the 1 till hail been carefully
prepared upon material furnished by
exports in the most various branches
of trade and industry. On this basis
Ihe imperial authorities had built' up
the present bill and submitted it to the

on the measure as lonir ago as July.
The bill took into account al the in

more particularly agriculture.
But it was also intended to remedy
defects which the existing tariff dis
played in respect to commerce and in

that in the ensuing discussions a sense

and is set in motion by a laborious pro

they clung to their places through the
entire proceedings, which lasted four

any couiniunicat ion he might have to

adopted after a slight jar. and then

This latter ceremony was robbed of
much of its interest yesterday by the
