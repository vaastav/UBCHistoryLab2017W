Once lroMperouii Capital of 1111
noi Pontolllce to (io.
ST. LOUIS. Dec. S.-The Globe-Democrat's
Chester (111.) correspondent f-ays:
"Kaskaskla. the flrt capital city of the
State of Illinois, will fooii bo wiped out of
official existence by an order of the post
master general, effective on the 1st day of
January. Only five families now live in
the once prosperous town, and the depart
ment has decided to abolish tho Kaskaskia
postofflco and accommodate the residents
through the extension of a rural free de
livery route from Fort Gae.
"Time was when Kaskaskia wis a thriv
ing town a mushroom prowth of stately
buildings, rough-hewn cabins and canvas
shelters a central point la tho Western
wilderness and a trading post known far
and wide. It wns predicted then that one
day Kaska.'kla would become the metropo
lis of the West and vie with Eastern cities
In size and prominence. The town was situ
ated on the Okaw, a river spanned by a
substantial bridge, and a short distance
west llowed th? Mississippi river, where a
ftrry was operated by Augustus St. Mary
hetween the Illinois and Missouri shores.
The town was located at a X'oint where the
worn trails front tho south, the north and
the east united and swept westward in
the broad path followed by the pioneers in
their journey toward the setting nun.
"General Lafayette In 1MT honored Kas
kaskia by a visit and stopped beneath tho
roof of one of the few houses tili stand
ing within the limits of the old town. He
predicted a great future for the bustling
place. Then came the devastating l!ool of
1MI, and forty years later the Mississippi
cut s channel through the sandy yoil above
the town and unite; Its waters with those
of the Okaw, or Kaskaskia, rher, leaving
the town on rn island and destroying all
its future, prospects. Lot after lot and block
after block were engulfed by the mad
waters of the united rivers and people
kept moving away until now the live
families and the tive houses are all that
remain of the place which at one time had
iuch a brilliant future and for which so
much was predicted. Many of the Inhabi
tants removed to the now town of Kas
kaskia, two miles south, where the village
organization is still maintained."

MEXICAN PRESS COMMENT.
YVhnt I Said About Americans nntl
the lreidenti MesuKe.
MEXICO CITY, Doc. S.-La patria, a Lib
eral newspaper of this city, warns the Mex
icans that they may not hope to look to
Europe for help against the North Amer
ican aggression so much talked of by the
clerical papers, but adds: "We fear noth
ing from the United States. That great
Republic rlants itself on the Monroe doc
trine and that of peace in this hemisphere.
The United States offers as a pledge of its
sincerity the support they gave Mexico
during her war with Napoleon III."
Ll Tiempo, a Clerical organ, after wait
ing several days, emits its opinion on Pres
ident Roosevelt's message, which, it says,
is characterized by "an arrogant, and vain
glorious tone. Roosevelt is a politician,
given to talk, whereas McKinley worked
more than he talked. McKinley was more
to be feared as a statesman and politician."
El Gorreo Fspanola, an organ of the res
ident Spanish colony, praises Roosevelt's
mfssage as being well written and full of
altruism, optimism and ambrosia, but for
all his line sentiments there is Cuba in
servitude to the United States by reason
of the Piatt law embodied in her new Con
stitution, lt is u badge of Yankee servi
tude. Ill Popular, a penny dally, praises Gen
eral Diaz's doctrine as a complement to
the Monroe doctrine rather than Its inter
pretation. Obituary.

F. T. Fowers, president of the National
Association of Professional Raseball
Leagues, has written to Secretary Farrell,
directing him to send a circular letter to
all leagues and associations composing the
National Association notifying them of the
expulsion of Thomas J. Hickey, of St.
Joseph, Mo., from the National Associa
tion. Mr. Powers takes this action on the
affirmative vote of the Eastern League,
New England League, Western Associa
tion, Connecticut State League, New York
Stato League and Southern League. The
charge was made that Hickey, in becoming
president of the American Association, had
not. kept faith with tho National Associa
tion. President Powers has addressed him
the following letter: "By request of the
members of the National Association, you
are hereby deposed as member and chair
man of the board of arbitration, and noti
fied that your connection with the National
Association is terminated."
westkhx li:ac;ii:s efforts.
It Will Attempt to Place n Club In
3Iilwnukee.
It i3 said that tho Western League pro
poses to fight the American Association by
placing a club in Milwaukee, and will con
centrate Its effort's to secure the lake town.
This makes about the fifth city where
Manning and his crowd threaten to do bat
tle with the new organization. Omaha was
tho first chosen, then Manning said he
would fight It out in Kansas City. Later
the Western League said lt would remain
In St. Paul and Minneapolis, and now it is
given out that Milwaukee will be the
scene of the fiercest war.
Fred Gross, who was connected with the
American League club In Milwaukee, and
who was reported as going 1o St. Louis
with Killilea, will stay in Milwaukee, It Is
claimed, where he will be given a Western
League franchise and will fight Havnor
and Quin, of the new organization. This
piece of news emanated from Ban John
son's headquarters in Chicago. It looks
as if Johnson will try to make the Western
League a farming ground for the American
league, and will also try to smooth James
Manning's temper by helping him out in
the Western League.
If the Western League d?ems it ad
visable to fight Henover and Cjuin In Mil
waukee it will have Its hand? full. Gross
Is a Milwaukee business man. but so are
Havenor and Quin, and they have dollars
to use in the national game where Gross
will use pennies. The Milwaukee story i
not taken very seriously in the Indianapo
lis camp.
A story comes from Milwaukee that
Harry Quin is authority for the statement
that the Omaha American Association
franchise will l- removed to Louisville,
and that V. H. Watkins is In favor of the?
change. Watkins is in favor of keeping
Omaha and keeping the circuit as first an
nounced Intact throughout next year. He
thinks Louisville would make a good town,
but does not believe It would be advisable
to transfer the Omaha franchise to that
city. '
