SCHOOLS BADLY DAMAGED
Vessels Tossed About Like Bits of Wood
on the Bay and Panic
Results.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Dec. 10.-A
southeast gale sweeping along the coast
at a registered velocity of 48 miles an
hour today resulted in the death of one
laborer in San Francisco and severe in
jury of several other persons.
Shipping in the harbor was damaged
considerably and in all quarters of the
city tottering walls were hurled to the
ground, blockading streets and interrupt
ing traffic. Owing to danger trom fall
ing walls, street car service was entire
ly suspended. In every section of the
burned district, ruins were toppled over.
Schools Badly Damaged.
Two frame Lionses, one at Washington
and Leavenworth streets, the other near
Leavenworth and Broadway, were lev
eled by the gale. The Burnett school
was unroofed and the roof of the Bernal
school was torn off and blown away.
On the bay the storm was terrific.
The ferry boats, proceeding with ex
traordinary' caution, were tossed about
until scores of passengers were made
sick. The lower decks were awash
most of the time and occasionally the
crest of a wave leaped onto the hurricane
decks.
Panic Was Threatened.
What threatened to result in a serious
panic on the Kay route boat
San Francisco when an unusually large
wave struck the vessel, carrying her to
leeward. Women screamed and fainted,
men rushed for the lifeboats, and only
the advice and command of the cool
headed prevented injury and perhaps
loss of life among the other passengers.

some of the larger vessels in thc'harbor
from slipping their moorings. The Chi
nese was junk Whand Ho. which lay
BOjjith of the Kay ferry slips last night,

moorings shortly after 8 o’clock and
drifted upon the rocky shore ofAlcatraz
island, where, for a time, it seemed that
she would be beaten tot pieces. Two

TIRES OF PARTY’S CALL
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT TO FIGHT
DEMAND FOR RENOMINATION.
Taft Is Considered His Candidate and
Will Get Justiceship if He
Isn’t Named.
WASHINGTON. D. C.. Dec. 10. -
President Roosevelt has announced his
mention o£ taking vigorous steps to put
i stop to the movement which has
seemed to be dragging him into another
race as leader of the Republican parly.
One of the reasons brought to bear on
iie I'resident by those who insist that
ae will be the logical candidate to suc
ceed himself is that William .1. Bryan
s certain to he the Democratic nominee,
tnd that no Republican aside from the
present white house occupant can de
feat him at the polls. President 1 Coosc
iT* T ’ Lowevei, does not believe .Mr.
Bryan is so strousr.
1 lie President does not intend to retire
Ironi public life by any means, and his
jriends believe that some time he would
! ke to come to Washington as a sena
p*r of the Pnited States to Help the Em
hire state regain the position in the leg
islative councils of the nation that it
| nee enjoyed. It is not regarded as cer
tain, howevei. that he desires to step
Greetly from the white house to the
Senate chamber.
Secretary of War Taft still is regarded
as the choice of the administration to
jiiceeed President Roosevelt. although
ho open effort will be made to bring
(ihout his nomination.
If the next Republican national con
vention does not nominate Secretary
Taft lor President the latter will be sure
to round out his career on the supreme

TAKE M AILOIJTO FPO LITIC S
Postmaster General Advises Use of Busi
ness Principles in Department—Keep
Good Men in Office.
WASHINGTON. I). <’., Doc. 10.—“I
know of no one thing that will do more
for the postal service than continued
insistence upon the policy of substitut
ing business for politics m the adminis
tration of its affairs.”
This recommendation for making more
efficient the administration of one of the
most important departments of the na
tional government is contained in the
annual report of Postmaster General
George B. Cortelyon, which has been
submitted to President Rooesvelt. The
development of the country’s postal sys
tem and a greater study of its ills and
needs, he declares, has demonstrated
that the elimination of politics and the
persistent injection of up-to-date busi
ness methods in the department is a
necessity.
“There can be further economies in
rural delivery without any impairment
of that service.” says the report. By a
more precise method of determining the
basis of pay for the transportation of tin*
mails, the department can be relieved of
an unbusinesslike feature of administra
tion with a probable decrease in expen
ditures. By the enactment of a sen
sible law as to second-class matter, the
department and reputable publishers can
be saved embarrassments they now suf
fer and the postal receipts be materially
increased. By a proper system of ac
counting, the department can be placed
upon a better business footing and in
cidentally credited with work for which
it now receives no credit. And as a re
sult of these and other needed changes
the deficit, which is, in fact, only a pa
per deficit, can he altogether eliminated.
"Progress toward those improvements
will open the way for investigations to
determine the feasibility of the adoption
of many important policies of adminis
tration —reduction of postage, both do
mestic and international, postal savings
banks, parcel post, postal telegraph and
telephone, and others —the merits and de
fects of all of which should have, in the
not distant future, the fullest considera
tion.”
It is announced in the report that the
policy of retaining fourth-class post
masters during satisfactory service has
now been extended until it practically
embraces the postmasters of the presi
dential class.
A financial statement of the depart
ment shows that the receipts for the
fiscal year ended June .’>o hist were $1•"> i.-
952.782.95, as compared with $152,82(1,-
585.10 for 1905. The total expemlitures
for the same periods were* 8178,449.-
778.89 in 1900 and $107,399,109.25 in
1905. leaving a -deficit for 1900 of $lO,-
510.995.94. as against $14,572,584.15.
Losses from fire, bad debts, burglary and
other sources increased the deficit for
1900 to $10,542,941.70. _ In the 1900
fiscal year there were 05.000 postoffices
in the country, as compared with 70,500
in 1896. The -decrease, it is said, is
largely due to the discontinuance of
minor offices on account of the introduc
tion of rural delivery.
In referring to the estimates of ap
propriations required for the fiscal year
1907-8. the postmaster general sstys that
the amount requested for salaries hi the
department is $1,529,420, an increase of
$122,030 over the present appropriation.
The estimates for the service at large
aggregate $200,002,190. an increase of
about $15,000,000 over last year's ap
propriation. the principal increases being
in the -compensation of postmasters, post
office clerks, letter carriers, both city and
rural, in the railway mail service and in
the transportation of mail by railroad
routes and pneumatic tubes. For city
letter carriers alone, he says, an increase
■of $1,150,700 will be needed, while for
the rural carriers it will be necessary
to have an additional $1,475,000.
A feature of the report is a it-com
mendation that provision l>e made for the
appointment of a deputy postmaster gen
eral, who shall Ik* the ranking officer of
the postmaster general’s assistants, and
whose ,tenure of office shall be perma
nent.

BILLICK CASE
IS UKE HOGH’S.
Young Girl Expired in Store with Symp
toms Similar to Those in
Vrzal Case.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 10.—An un
known girl entered into the Vrzal poison
j ing case last night, opening up a line
of inquiry into Herman Billick's career
that led the police back live years, and
may unveil a series of deaths similar to
that which followed in the trail of the
arch wife murderer, Johann Hoch.
j Lieut. O’Brien received information
that five years ago Billick was present
at the death of a young Bohemian girl
whom he had induced to believe that he
would marry, despite the fact that he
had a wife and children.
This girl, according to the police ii>-
fonuant, had money and they went to a
store in South Halsted street to pick out
the furniture for the home they were to
establish.
Girl Drops Dead in Store.
In this store, while looking over furni
| ture, the girl dropped dead. Her death
was laid to heart trouble and stomach
disorders, but the symptoms, ns far as
the police have learned, were identical
with thqse disjilayetl by the six mem
bers of the farhiiy who have died
since Billick became the “family friend.”
The features of the case leading to the
theory that Billick practiced hypnotism,
and that the administration of the poison
may have beep directed by his art. were
examined into by Assistant Chief Schuet
tler, who is an authority on hypnotism.
That Billick worked magic spells and
incantations, and fed pills to the chil
dren of the Vrzal family who died so
mysteriously was made plain by the new
evidence given by the boy, “Jerry” Vrzal,
who appeared to feel freer from the in
! fluence of Billick than at any time since
I the arrest. The boy will be examined
by a physician, as he admitted that
Billick had given him pills, too, and he
shows symptoms of arsenic poison.
New Evidence Is Secured.
New evidence in the case centered in
these discoveries:
Billick at one time worked in a chemical
shop in Cleveland and was acquainted with
the uses and natures of poisons.
Ho gave pills to other members of the
family who died, besides the father, Martin
Vrzal- and the girl, Mary.
He was alone with Mrs. Vrzal for twenty
minutes the day she drank the potion that
ended her life, aud when he came to the
house the second day he immediately asked
for “the bottle.”
On two different occasions, Ella and
Bertha Vrzal, the youngest two children,

an attempt at murder.

Jacob H. Schiff and Other Prominent
Jews in Bad Tangle for Several Min
utes at Lewin Meeting.
NEW YORK, Dec. 10. —An immense
j Jewish mass meeting in the riding acade
i my in Sixty-sixth street last night ended
; in panic when part of the speakers’
platform collapsed, dropping Jacob H-

forty others in a heap on the tanbark
fioor. The meeting had been called to
welcome Dr. Shmarahu Lewin, a Jew
ish member of the late Russian duma
aud leader of his people in Russia.
Dr. Lewin was among the persons who
went down, as were also Cyrus L. Sulz
berger and Congressman Goldfogle.
Mr, Schiff was uttering the closing
words when a rush started toward the
platform. Everybody, apparently, want
ed to shake hands with the Jewish pa
triot. The rush was still on when there
came a great crash. Mr. Schiff was at
the edge of the heap and quickly was
helped up. He was cool, aud, stepping
out, added his voice to that of the po
lice. warning the people to leave the
building. Then he jumped down on the
reporters’ stand and helped straighten
out the tangle in the hole. Dr. Lewin
also landed on the edge of the heap
and was one of the first to get out.
Everybody was out of the mixup in a
few minutes aud few had marks to show.

[^PORT{NQ^EMS]
BASEBALL.
The man who will endeavor to fill Joe
| Cantillon’s shoes next season as maim
ger of the Brewers is Jack Doyle, who
i lias been mentioned in connection with
the job for the past three weeks. This
fact was decided on Tuesday by Owner
Havener, although it was all arranged
two weeks ago.
Jack Doyle handled the Des Moines
team on the field last season while Mike
I Cantillon was head of the concern and
Jack had an easy road to travel. Pro
! vious to that he was with the Toledo
j team in the association and played first
j base for a time, having been released
I to Toledo from the major league, where
he had played for many years, having
been with St. Louis, New York and
other clubs.
Barry McCormick, the Brewers' clever
| second baseman, was hot after the job
! and thought be had a good chance t>
| land it. but Owner Havener eonsiderei
Doyle the better man for the place am
selected him. Doyle certainly knows th
game and he should be able to guide tin
team as well as any man on the field
and it will depend upon himself to mak
good as a manager of men.
Jack will make his headquarters it
Chicago for the present where he ca
confer with Joe Cantillon and get thing
I shaped up for the season. He will hav
j the men train at some point near Si
[ Joe, Mo., as Mike Cantillon will proha
( bly have his Minneapolis team train a
i Des Moines.
In the opinion of a well known Mil
waukee lawyer, W. H. Watkins, owuei
j of the Indianapolis club, made a seriou
I mistake when he voted with the major
I ity to expel Mike Kelley, ex-presiden
t of the Minneapolis club, from the Amer
ican association.
“By doing so,” said he lawyer, “Mr.
Watkins laid himself wide open in tin
event of Kelley bringing suit to recov
! er his salary for 1907, which fie can do
under tfie terms of his contract, from
Mr. Watkins or the Minneapolis club
By voting as he did Mr. Watkins made
it appear that he wanted Kelley ex
pelled from the association in order thai
his contract would be null and void
Thus it will be evident that it was u
case of forcing Kelley out for a purpos*
and he will have all the best of it
whereas, had Mr. Watkins refused to
vote with the majority, he could have
made the claim that rt was no fault of
his that Kelley was barred from the as
sociation and unable to fulfill his con
tract.”
American league magnates, according
to President Ban Johnson, will be more
insistent this year in their demands foi
a reduction of the playing schedule ol
the two major leagues. Heretofore Un-
American league, while not favoring the
154-game schedule adopted by tbe Na
tional league, has made no strenuous
opposition to L. Five of the American
league club are desirious of limiting the
season to 140 games.
“Under the terms of the peace com
pact,” said President Johnson yesterday,
“we have the right to call a meeting of
the committee to discuss the matter
This committee consists of three repre
sentatives from each organization and
it is probable we shall ask for a meet
ing early next year. One thing is cer
tain. and that is if the National league
refuses to curtail the long programme
we shall not agree to any lengthening of
the post-season series.”
