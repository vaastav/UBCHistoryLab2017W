President's Message to Sixty-Sixth
Congress Asks Reorganization of Taxation; "
Readjustment of Tariffs; Relief of American
World War Veterans; Farmers Recognition
Washington, Dec. 2. General recommendations on lejfia
lution to combat the cost of living, labor unrest, radicalism and
a readjustment of the nation to peace-time basis were the fea
tures of President Wilson's annual' message to congress deliv
ered todav.
The peace treaty, the president told congress, will be dis
cussed in a separate message later, as will the railroad question.
For the second time only since the president established
the practice of addressing congress in person, his message was
road today by the clerks.
The president's principal recommendations were:
Establishment of a budget system for the national finances.
Reorganization of the taxation system with simplification
of the income and excess profits.
Readjustment of the tariff system, if necessary to meet
changed world conditions, and make the system conform with
the fact that the United States is "the greatest capitalist in the
world."
Recognition and relief for veteran soldiers of the world
war, particularly in thf way of government farms as proposed
by Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the dyestuffs industry built up
during the war, to keep the United States independent of
foreign supply.
An enlarged program for rural development in recognition
of the farmers' part in the war.
Measures which "will remove the causes" of "political
restlessness in our body politic."
THE MILL WILL NEVER GRIND WITH THE WATER THAT HAS PASSED'
'I' lit Peace, Treaty
It Is pointed out if the treaty i.s not
ratified the situation between Germany
and the United State-, lis well as tlie
other allied mid associated powers goes
back to the hiatus created by thn arm
istice. Hence tho United States Is as much
interested us Us associates of the allied
powers despite the fact that the senate
has not ratified the treaty.
Whatever tho date which the Ameri
ran delegation may decide, upon for
leaving France It wa.-i affirmed toc'a...
on excellent authority, that arrange
ments would he made for the repre
sentation of the I'nited States in the
further negotiations that Germany
would find all the allies and associated
powers working together to resist any
1 effort on her part to avoid making
the peace effective according to the
t"rrns of the treaty.
At this point the president made his
most extensive reference to the peace
treaty by Faying the causes for the un
rest "are superficial rather than deep
fated," anil that they "arise from, or
ur connected with the failure on the
part of our government to arrive speed
ily at a Just and permanent peace per
mitting return to normal conditions,
from the transfusion of radical theor
ies from set thing European centers
pending such delay from heartless
profiteering, resulting from the in
crease of the cost of living and lastly
from the machinations of passionate
and malvolent agitators.
Normal Conditions Can Solve Problem
With the return to normal condi
tions this unrest will rapidly disap
pear. Tho president renewed his recom
mendations for legislation to deal ef
fectively with "those persons who by
violent methods will abrogate our time
tested Institutions."
Food Control Necessary
Several recommendations, some re
newals of previous ones, were made
by the president to bring down the
cost of living. Among them were ex
tension of the food control law to peace
times for the emergency; regulations
for transportation of foods in Inter
state commerce; a cold storage law
modelled after the law in New Jersey;
a law requiring markets to .show the
length of time food are kept in storage
and a law to secure "competitive sell
ing and prevent unconscionable prof
its" by federal license of corporations
selling food in Interstate commerce.
The tabor Question
A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the condi-
Lion and the rights of labor. "A defi
nite program to bring about an im
provement in the conditions of labor"
md bring about "a genuine democrati
zation of Industry" was recommended.
The only way to keep men from
agitating against grievances i.s to re
move the grievances," said the presi
dent's message. Another point de
clared "the need of revolution is re
pression." The establishment of the, principles

regarding labor laid down In the cove

the message, "offers us the way to in
dustrial peace and conciliation. N'n
other road lies open to us.
Governments must recognize the right
of men to bargain collectively for hu
mane objects. iahor must no
longer he treated as a commodity."
Government Must Protect People
"The right of Individuals to strike
is inviolate," continued the message,
'and ought not to be Interfered with by
an j' process of government, but there
i.s a predominant right and that Is the
right of the government to protect all
of its people and to assert its powers
and majesty against the challenge of
any class."
The president was referring to the
government's recent injunction against
the coal strike.
The message closed with a pointed
reference to radicalism and red doc
trines and referred to "Russia today
with its blood and terror" as a "pain
ful object lesson of the power of min
orities."
Special Privileges Not Permitted
"There are those in this country,"
said the message, "who threatened di
rect action to force their will upon a
majority.
"It makes little difference what min
ority it is; whether capital or labor
or any other class; no sort of privi
lege will ever be permitted to dominate
this country."
Orderly processes, the message de
clared, were the only ones by which
relief and reform could be obtained.
"Those who would propose any other
method of reform are enemies of this
country," the message said.
"La'I those beware who take the shorter
road of disorder and revolution."

KEPKKSKNTATIVES:
I sincerely regret that 1 cannot be
present at the opening of this session
of the congress. 1 am thus prevented
from presenting in as direct a Way as
I could wish, the many questions that
are pressing for solution at this tim.
Happily, I have had the advantage of
the advice of the heads of the several
executive departments w ho have kept '
in close touch with affairs in their de
t:ul and whoso thoughtful recommen
dations I earnestly second.
In the matter of the railroads and
the readjustment of their affairs grow
ing out of federal control 1 shall take
the liberty at a later date of addressing
you.
Asks P.mlget System
I hope that congress will bring to
a conclusion at this session legislation
looking to the establishment of a bud
get system. That there should be one
single authority responsible for the
making of all appropriations, and that
appropriations should be made,, not in
dependently of each other, but with ref
erence to one single comprehensive plan
of expenditure properly related to the
nation's income, there can be no doubt.
I believe the burden of preparing the
budget, must, In the nature of the case,
if the work Is to be properly done, and
responsibility concentrated instead of
divided, rest upon the executive. The
budget bo prepared should be submitted
to and approved, or amended, by a sin
gle committee of each house of con
gress and no single appropriation should
be made by the congress, except such
as may have been Included In the bud
get prepared by the executive, or added
by tho particular committee of con
gress charged with budget legislation.
More Efficiency In Money Matters
Another and not less Important as
pect of the problem Is the ascertain
ment of the economy and efficiency
with which the moneys appropriated are
expended.
Under existing law the only audit Is
for the purpose of ascertaining wheth
er expenditures have been lawfully
made within the appropriations.
No one is authorized or equipped to
ascertain whether the money has been
spent wisely, economically and effec
