The president, in his annual message
to congress, snys:
"At the threshold of your delibera
tions you are called to mourn with your
countrymen the tlenth of Vice President
liobart, who passed from, this life on the
morning of Nov. 21 Inst. His great soul
now rests in eternal peace. His private
life wns pure and elevated, while his pub
fc career was ever distinguished by large
japacity, stainless integrity and exulted
motives. He has been removed from the
High office which he honored and digni
fied, but his lofty character, his devotion
to duty, his honesty of purpose and no
ble virtues remain with us us u priceless
legacy and example."
The president then plunges into a re
view of the prosperous conditions which
have prevailed throughout the country
since his last message was delivered, lie
tinds that the exports of agricultural
products were $784,77(1,142 and of man
ufactured products $330.ril2.14, larger
I hun any previous year. Government re
ceipts from all sonifVs for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1MI0, aggregated nearly
$011,000,000. Customs receipts were
liver $200,000,000 and those from inter
nal revenue about $274,000,000. For the
same period the expenditures were $700,
0O3.5(i4, leaving a deficit of a little over
fH! UK 10,000.
The secretary of the treasury estimates
that the receipts for the current fiscal
year will aggregate nearly $041,000,000
and the expenditures about $001,000,000.
Mr. McKinley then turns his atten
tion to the condition of the treasury,
which, he snys, is most gratifying. The
available cash balance on Dec. 1, ISO),
was $278,000,000, of which over $220.
000,000 was in gold coin and bullion, and
he remarks that the conditions of conti
donce which prevail throughout the coun
try have brought gold into more general
use, and customs receipts are now al
most entirely paid in that coin.
THIS BOND OFF Kit.
The recent action of the secretary of
the treasury in offering to purchase $25,
000,000 of bonds is referred to in the fol
lowing terms:
"The strong position of the treasury
with respect to cash on hand and the
favorable showing made by the revenues
have made it possible for the secretary
of the treasury to take action under the
provisions of section 3594, Revised Stat
utes, relating to the sinking fund. Re
ceipts exceeded expenditures for the
first five months of the current fiscal
year by $13,413,389.01, and, as mention
ed above, the secretary of the treasury
estimates that there will he a surplus
of approximately $40,000,000 nt the end
of the year. Under such conditions it
wns deemed advisable and proper to re
sume compliance with the provisions of
the sinking fund law, which for eight
yenrs 1ms not been done because of de
ficiencies in the revenues. The amount
offered and purchased during November
wns $18,408,000."
Mr. McKinley snys the net saving in
interest on the amount purchased was
over $2,000,000.
The president finds that under the rap
id development in the industries of the
country the national banking net: is not n
sufficient avenue through which needful
addition to the circulation can from time
to time he made. He therefore asks con
gress to take up this matter with the
view of ascertaining whether or not such
reasonable modifications can lie made as
will render the act's service in the par
ticulars referred to more responsive to
the people's needs. He urges that na
tional banks be authorized to organize
with ft cnpilnl of $25,000.
THE MONEY STANDARD.
President McKinley then proceeds to
discuss the standard of money and says:
"1 urgently recommend that to support
the existing gold standard and to main
tain the parity in value of the coins of
the two metals (gold and silver) and the
equal power of every dollar at all times
in the market and in the payment of
dtdits the secretary of the treasury be
given additional power and charged with
the duty to sell United States bonds and
to employ such other effective means as
may be necessary to those ends. The au
thority should include the power to sell
bonds on long and short time, as condi
tions may require, and should provide for
a rate of interest lower than that lixed
by the act of Jan. 14, 1875. While there
is now no commercial flight which with
draws gold from the government, but, on
the contrary, such widespread confidence
that gold seeks the treasury demanding
paper money in exchange, yet the very
situation points to the present ns the
most fitting time to make adequate provi
sion to insure the' continuance of the gold
standard and of public confidence in the
ability and purpose of the government to
meet all its obligations in the money
which the civilized world recognizes as
the best.
"The financial transactions of the gov
ernment are conducted upon a gold ba
sis. We receive gold when we sell Unit
ed States bonds and use gold for their
payment. We are maintaining the parity
of all the money issued or coined by au
thority of the government. We are doing
these things with the means at hand.
Happily at the present time we are not
compelled to resort to loans to supply
gold. It has been done in the past, how
ever, and may have to be done in the fu
ture. It behooves us, therefore, to pro
vide at once the best means to meet the
emergency when it arises, and the best
means are those which are the most cer
tain and economical. Those now author
ized have the virtue neither of directness
nor economy. We have already eliminat
ed one of the causes of our financial
plight and embarrassment during the
years 1SD3, 1894, 1895 and 1890.
KECEirTS EQUAL EXPENDI
TURES.
"Our receipts now equal our expendi
tures. Deficient revenues no longer cre
ate alarm. Let us remove the only re
maining cause by conferring the full and
necessary power on the secretary of the
treasury and impose upon him the duty
to uphold the present gold standard nnd
preserve the coins of the two metals on n
parity with each other, which is the re
peatedly declared policy of the United
States. In this connection I repeat my
former recommendations that a portion
of the gold holdings shall he placed in n
trust fund from which greenbacks shall
lie redeemed upon presentation, but when
once redeemed shall not thereafter bt
paid out except for gold."
After an urgent appeal to congress tc
pass some legislation which shall lift tin
American merchant marine from it
present state of decadence President
McKinley turns his attention to the sub
Ject of trusts and devotes a great deal of
attention to it. Hejuiys:
"Combinations of capital organized

trade ninmii, nu, .iliivnn. rt ...

Following the trust question the presi
dent takes up foreign relations, first re
viewing the status of several disputes
which the government has on hand and
finding them moving toward a success
ful settlement. He finds thut the isth
mian canal commission is making good
progress in carrying on examinations in
Nicaragua and Darieu with a view to
establishing a canal between the At
lantic and Pacific oceans, and he asks
congress to help in the work.
Referring to China, Mr. McKinley says
that the interests of our citizens in that
vast empire have not been neglected, and
adequate protection has been secured for
American missionaries there. Our trade
with China has continued to grow, and
our commercial rights under existing
treaties have been ad will be maintaiii

and industrial conditions in the Chinese

OUR RELATIONS WITH GER
MANY. Next the Taris exposition is touched
niti.' (iei'inanv the nresi-
dent finds that our relations continue to
be most cordial. He says:
"In all that promises closer relations of
Intercourse and commerce and a better
understanding between two races hav
ing so many traits in common Germany
can be assured of the most cordial co-
,,( nf tliiu cnveinment and people.
We may be rivals in many material
paths, but our rivalry snouia oe geneiuus
and open, ever aiming toward the attain
Its and the mutually
beneficial advancement of each in the
line of its especial adaptabilities."
Mr. McKinley contends that our sys
tem of the inspection of food products
for export is of the best, and he hopes
that the German government will come
to realize this and suggests that congress
authorize an invitation to Germany in
connection with the pending reciprocity
negotiations for the constitution of a
joint commission of scientific experts and
practical men of affairs to conduct a
searching investigation of food produc
tion nnd exportation in both countries.
The president hopes that the disputed
question concerning the Alaskan-Canadian
boundary will soon be satisfactorily
settled.
THE TRANSVAAL WAR.
Touching on the war between Great
Brituiu and the Boers, the president
says:
"This government has attained an at
titude of neutrality in the unfortunate
contest between Great Britain and the
Roer states of South Africa. We have
been faithful to the precept of n voiding
entangling alliances as to affairs not of
a direct concern. Had circumstances
suggested that the parties to the quarrel
would have welcomed any kindly expres
sion of the hope or the American peo
ple that war might be averted good of
fices would have been gladly tendered.
"The United Stntes representative at
Pretoria was early instructed to see that
all neutral American interests be re
spected by the eombatnnts. This has
been an easy task in view of the positive
declarations of both British and Boer
authorities that the personal and prop
erty rights of our citizens should be ob
served. "Upon the withdrawal of the British
agent from Pretoria the United States
consul was authorized, upon the request
of the British government and with the
assent of the South African and Orange
Free State governments, to exercise the
customary good offices of a neutral for
the care of the British interests. In the
discharge of this function I am happy to
say that abundant opportunity has been
afforded to show the impartiality of this
government toward both the combat
ants." Taking up the subject of the lynching
of certain Italians in Louisiana, Mr. Mc
Kinley follows President Harrison in
urging that congress extend the powers
of the federal courts so that they may
have jurisdiction over offenses against
the treaty rights of foreigners domiciled
in the United States.
The president after a complimentary
reference to the friendly feeling the gov
ernment of Japan has for the United
States hopes that that country will soon
be brought into telegraphic relation with
this country and also calls attention to
his special message of Feb. 10, 1890,
concerning the necessity of a cable to
Manila, recommending that congress au
thorize the postmaster general to invite
competitive bids for the establishment of
such a cable.
President McKinley reviews nt some
length the Snmoan troubles and says
that he will soon submit to the senate a
convention entered into between the Unit
ed States, Germany and England for its
action.
THE TREATY OF PEACE.
The message continues:
"My annual message of last year was
necessarily devoted in great part to a
consideration of the Spanish war and ol
the results It wrought and the conditions
it imposed for the future. I am gratified
to announce that the treaty of peace has
restored friendly relations between th
two powers. Effect has been given to it!
most important provisions. The evucua
tion of Porto Rico having already been
accomplished on the 18th of October
1808, nothing remained necessary then
but to continue the provisional military
control of the island until the congress
should enact a suitable government foi
the ceded territory. Of the character
and s.iope of the measures to that end
I shal treat in another part of this mes
sage. "Thj withdrawal of the authority of
Spain from the island of Cuba was ef
fected by the 1st of January, so that the
full re-establishment of peace found the
relinquished territory held by us in- trust
for the inhabitants, maintaining, undei
the direction of the executive, such gov
ernment and control therein as should
conserve public order, restore the produc
tive conditions of peace so long disturbed
by the instability and disorder which pre
vailed for the greater part of the preced
ing three decades and build up that tran
quil development of the domestic state
whereby alone can be realized the high
purpose, as proclaimed in the joint reso
lution adopted by the congress on the
l!)th of April, 1898, by which the United
Stntes disclaimed any disposition or in
tention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdic
tion or control over Cuba, except for the
pacification thereof, and asserted its de
termination that when that was accom
plished to leave the government and con
trol of the island to its people. The
pledge contained in this resolution is of
the highest honorable obligation and
must be sacredly kept.'
