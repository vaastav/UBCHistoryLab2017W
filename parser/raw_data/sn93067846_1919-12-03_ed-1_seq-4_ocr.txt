THE EIGHT-HOITR DAY.
The eight-hour day is like Chris
- Vanity. Broadly speaking, it "has
:. never been tried." The Golden Rule,
which is the essence of Christianity,
?\ when tried has really worked. But it
If-is only a few who employ it consistent-!
?.f.''' !
ly as the mainspring of their whole
- lives. Others follow it in spoiadic,
instances. Its success when applied,
indicates that it is an eminently prac
tical principle of life, one that min
isters to growth and usefulness and
'happiness.
* The same is true of the eight-hour
cay. Any man or woman can engage
in -eight hours of productive labor six
- esays a week and have time enough
f: ieft to keep fresh in mmd and body,
?happy, ready for the next day.
There are Jobs so exigent, either of I
br&in. or muscle, that five hours aj
<iay at one of them is enough. The
: other hours then could go on some
, entirely different job. Gardening for
the intense brain worker, a night
school ciass for the stoker, would do.
ffr. Bat just suppose everyone were
suddenly required to put in eight
" hours of work, no more, no less. What
" a revolution there would be in so
. ?iety!
When all the parasites, male and
female, did their stunt, would not
most of the evils of luxurious and
artificial living disappear?
And when mothers were forced by
the police to stop work at the end of
? .eight hours! There would be a sud
den boom in eooked-food services,
and cleaning services, and laundry
and mending services. And the moth
er who went on duty at seven and
had to stop at four (two half-hours
out for meals, of course) would have
to- plan her work with an ertraordi
nary amount of balanoe and good
judgment. That she could not get
dinner and do the evening dishes
would not mean that ,she could not
read to the children, of course. But
? if she bathed them and put them to
bed after hours, she would have to J
r.top an hour earlier in the after
noon.
Suppose the doctors were held
down to eight hours. We'd have to
keep well, wouldn't we? But the doc-j
tor would ^ have to have a flexible
schedule?a forty-eight hour week,
perhaps, adjusted to suit the incom
ing babies and emergencies.
If the authors had to work eight
hours a day, perhaps the magazine
stories would come out with a little
better finish and a little., sounder
structure. Editors might find their
tempers improved, if they stopped?
in time.
It would bear a good deal of think-1
ing. Take - half an hour to consider j
the possibilities of all civilized society,
the effect on production, upon com-j
* fort, upon happiness, upon advance j
ment, if there were a universally ap- f
plied eight-hour day.
The world is full of industrial trou
bles because people lack the neces
saries of life and people lack the
'necessaries of life because the world
is full of industrial troubles. *
a * *
The dancing mania, is here again.
They used to credit this mania to
booze, and now they credit it to pro
hibition. The solemn truth is that
people dance simply because they
like to dance, and it's a form of intoxi
cation in itself, which hasn't anything;
to do with alcohol.
POSTAGE ANT> PENNIES.
Bills pending in . congress which
provide for* the reduction of the lo
cal postage letter rate Irom two cents]
to one, have been , pproved by Post- j
masteF General Burleson. This means
that a>letter mailed in any city or
town would be delivered anywhere
within the limits of the local delivery
system for one cent. It does not at
fecfletters going beyond the ' -al of
fice.
This provision was at one time in
force. Mr. Burleson says that '*the
present two-cent charge on that class
of mail'exceeds the cost of handling."
And he "believes the reduction should
be made bec?u5|^' the postal service
should not be conducted for profit."
There are two sides to this matter,
however. While no one wants to pay
more for postage than is necessary, it
B*ems rather a' surd, in view of the
existing state of postal finances, that
any reduction should come about be
cause a little money is made on one
trifling branch of the service.
If there were funds available, to
give the carriers and other postal em
ployes a fair wage, compared with
other kinds of labor of equal standard,
if wages were high enough to attraci:
to the service somewhere near enough
j employees to handle the work effi
| ciently. then, if one branch were pay
ing a profit, that profit should of
course be taken off and the consumer
be given the benefit of the reduction.
But suppose this matter of the lo
cal one-cent postage were submitted
to a vote of all the people most af
fected by it? Take for example stores
and corporations sending out thous
ands of statements monthly, whose
mailing bills of hundreds of dollars
xwould be cut in half by the one-cent
local ^postage rate. Would they not
vote in overwhelming numbers to
have this money retained in the postal
service and used where it would do a
little good 4n improving the quality
I of the mail deliveries?
j GERMANS MUST LE.VRN CITIZEN
SHIP.
One of the 4essons which the Ger
mans must learn before they can
really achieve a position of respect
and power in the world is self-gov
ernment. They have been a docile
crowd of servants obedient to their
rulers for so long that they are at a
'oss now that governmental responsi
bilty is thrown upon them as citi
i - 1
? zens. This fact is made strikingly
; apparent in recent acounts of Ber-;
i man attempts at reconstruction.
' Committing the government of a
nation to the hands of a hereditary
ruler seems to work beautifully as
iong as the ruler is wise, honest, good
and ambitious only to promote justice
and honor in his own country and in
the world. But that combination of
qualities seems to be rare indeed in
divine-right monarchs with absolute
power. Fora Jong time the Germans,
while so ruled, -seemed to be the most }
efficient and prosperous of nations. J
Then the greed and ambition of their j
masters plunged them into a disas-1
irous war and left them stranded with j
'little ability for self government orj
political initiative, or even liking for
the task. * :
They cannnot get really on their
feet, develop a true national self-re
spect and attain an honorable place j
in the society of nations until theyj
have learned the science of sell-1
government from the very beginnin gl
and built up an individual and pub
lic consciousness which can be relied
upon in a crisis to think straight and
fast and so to reach just and wise de- j
cisions. j
NOTE TO MEXICO !
_ j
American Government Renews
Demand For Release of
Jenkins
Washington, Nov. 30.?Another note
to the Mexican government relating
to the arrest and imprisonment of
William O- Jenkins, consular agent at
Puebla, was sent by the State depart
ment today to the embassy at Mexico
City, for presentation tomorrow to
Carranza.
The note, which some officials indi
cated might be the last on the sub
ject, was in reply to Mexico's answer
to a sharp demand by this govern
ment for immediate release of Jen
kins. No intimation of its charcter
was disclosed, but officials in touch
with the situtaion believed it more |
emphatic than any sent heretofore.
It was thought here tonight that the j
note would be delivered by the
American representative to the for
eign office at Mexico City by noon to
morrow but there was no statement as
to when the text would be made pub- j
lie. State department officials de- ]
clined to be questioned concerning the
nature of the communication.
There were no advices to the de- j
partment from the Mexican capital
concerning the Jenkins case or the
latest murder, that of another oil man.
Wallace, although the embassy had |
been instructed to investigate and re- J
port.
Senators and representatives, back i
. today for the regular session of con- J
! gress tomorrow, took a live interest j
j in latest dispatches from the south-;
! ern republic and there were indica- j
j tions that debate would break loose1
fin both houses tomorrow on the gen-J
eral Mexican situation. Several sen-!
ators, who had expected to discuss!
the situation, said they would await i
publication of the las~ note from the j
government before expressing their!
views. In some quarters it was be- j
Ikved that the president's message
to congress would have a good deal
to say about Mexico.
REPLY TO HUN NOTE j
Paris. Der. l.?The supreme coun
cil today adopted the terms of reply !
to the recent German note regarding'
prisoners of war.
Washington. Dec. 1.?Seventeen
men. widely known in business and
public life, representing no particu-!
lar group as such, but acting for t ri<*,
people as a whole, assembled here j
today to confer on the country's h.-j
dustrial situation. The conference ap
pointment which was annouced from
the White House November 20, marks;
the second effort of President Wilson
to devise some rm ans for settling the
chaotic condition which has prevailed
for months in industry. The opening
session will be held this afternoon.
FUEL ORDER
BEING ENFORCED
Governors of States Will Coop
erate With Federal
Officials
Atlanta. Xov. 30.?Cooperation of
State governors in bringing1 to the at
tention of the public generally the
sharp curtailment of fuel decided up
on yesterday to husband the rapidly
diminishing supplies of the nations'
coal, was asked today by the regional
coal committee.
The regulations which will go into
effect at noon Monday are as far
reaching in many respects as those
of the war winter of 1917-18 and in its
announcement to the. public the com
mittee stared that unless miners re
turned to work in such numbers as
to provide a substantial increase of
coal at an early date "still further
restriction may become necessary and
consideration will have to be given
to the distribution of the stocks of
coal now in the possession of indus
tries not recognized as vital."
The new restrictions will be en
forced under the war time powers of,
the fuel administration. They pro- j
vide chiefly that stores and office!
buildings may use heat, light or pow- j
or only between 9 a. m. and 4 p. m.,
except for bakeries, restaurants, drug
stores (for sale of drugs only) and
barber shops which use light, heat and
power from 8 a. m. to 6 p. m. Certain
other exceptions are made to pro
vided for various industries and busi
nesses. Theaters, moving picture
houses and other places of public
amusement may use light, heat or
power only between 1 p. m. and 10.30
p. m.
All advertising signs and billboards
using electricity must be eliminated
els must white way lights, show win
lows and other lights not strictly es
sential.
Industries, except those whose con
tinuous processes can not be inter
fered with, may be operated only 4S
hours a week. Exceptions are made
to meet the special conditions of rail
road stations, hospitals, telephone and
?elegraph and newspaper offices.
Copies of the annoucement, which
were furnished to newspapers for
Sunday morning publication, will be
mailed to mayors of all cities in the
Southern region, which includes Ala
bama, Tennessee, Georgia, North and
"South Carolina, Kentucky, Florida,
Mississippi and Louisiana, east of the
Mississippi river.
Fuel supplies will be cut off where
the regulations are not observed and
in case of violations of the law at
tention of federal district attorneys
tvill be called to the matter. All rail
road agents handling coal are regardi
2d as representatives of the committee
in enforcing the provisions, while co- i
Dperation of all State and municipal j
officers is asked.
TEXTELE STRIKE
BEGINS TODAY I
Conference at Fall River Brings
No Agreement
Fall River. Mass., Xov. 30.?A con
ference between the executive com
mittees of the manufacturers' asso
ciation and of the textile council, held
this aftrnoon failed to bring about
any agreement, and the members of
unions forming the council will go on
strike tomorrow morning in accord
ance with their vote last Friday.
The operatives, who are affiliated
with the National Amalgamation of
Textile Operatives, took the strike
rote after the manufacturers had re
jected their demand for a .25 per
rent, wage advance.
The T'nited Textile Workers of
America, with a membership estimat
ed at 3.000 in the city, has announc
ed that it will take no part in the
strike. The amalgamation has ap
proximately 7,000 members subject to
its strike call. What proportion of
the 28,000 unorganiezd operatives will
follow the lead of the amalgama
mation is uncertain.

IGNORANCE AND \
ANARCHY TWINS!
_________ ?
Bolshevism Flourishes in Russia;
Because of Illiteracy
t
Omsk, Sept. 15 (via Vladivostok,!
Oct. 5.?Illiteracy is the horror of<
Russia an d it is on this soil that i
Bolshevism flourishes, says Professor
A. A. Ossendoi'fsky, the Polish chief of j
the Intelligence Department of the!
All-Russian government.
He defines the Bolshevik order as: j
"There, is no more law. Go forth.;
burn, pilage, kill and you will be!
rich and happy.'" The illiterate and ;
credulous believe this and after two
years the world sees the ruin of Rus- ?
sia. j
According to the professor, they;
have no axes, scythes, shovels or!
nails in Soviet Russia. The Council!
of National Commissaries is ordering1
that all the valuable English textile:
machines in Russia be converted into!
such utensils as there is no cotton in !
Soviet Russia and ail textile works are j
idle.
Of the chemical industry there is j
not a trace. All manufactured goods
have been exhausted. Machines are ?
idle.
The professor estimates that all |
the debt of Russia could be paid up j
by exporting its vast supply of timber
and j that its great stores of hard and!
soft ,coal would suffice the world for ;
l&C years. Russia's, surplus of iron, j
copper, zinc, naptha. gold and the j
wealth in fish of the Pacific and
Northern Oceans and Siberian rivers j
and its fur industries could be utiliz- ;
ed as a firm foundation for any eco- j
nomicat and financial policy that j
migrlvt be adopted by any Russian gov- j
eminent.
? "But to accomplish this, it is nec
essary to have normal living condi
tion-, continuity of work and assur
i anoe of the integrity of person and
property,' says Professor Ossendoff
sky. Toward attainment of these
conditions, he believes the AH-Rus
sian government at Omsk is making
progress.
"Having freed from Bolshevism,
one-third of Asia.*' he says, "the Omsk
government has preserved untouched
the whole of the gold reserve be
longing t<> tbp former Russian empire.
preserved it for the whole of the Rus
sian people. Immense sums have been
assigned for th*? purchase of agricul
tural machines and fertilizers. The
government has sworn to convene a
constituent assembly which shall de- ;
cide ihe age-long question of dis- i
tribution of land among the peasants.!
"The Bolsheviki having promised
and actually given land to the peas-;
ants, began to introduce the com-:
nvunal principle into its agrarion j
policy and its method of distributing
supplies witht he consequence that all
Soviet Russia has been shaken by
peasant uprisings." :
