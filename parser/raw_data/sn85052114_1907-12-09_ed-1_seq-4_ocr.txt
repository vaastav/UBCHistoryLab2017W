Wo hopefully bfeiksre that obwdrdly j

Grave a fair trial and their Just do

A GOOD SIGN
It Is a good sign when Saturday

front pago the following editorial
Another night of crime shame
and humiliation has comp to weStern
Kentucky A center of education has
felt the hand of brutal ignorance at
its throat the land of chivalry has
p rmltted the terrorizing of aged flit d
Infirm women In their own homes
and bedchambers and this Ini a time
of peace One of the most oderly
cities hitherto of Its size perhaps In l
tho south or elsewhere has been in
vested by a mob from without and
the neighborly principles of the reo
Hglon of Christ have been violated in I
a home of great churches and liter
ally at their doors Strong men look
at one another dumbly but with deep
questioning In their gaze The eyes
0of such seem to ask Is this the town

This country is growing like a
fQurleen ear old boy Wo ought to
build for decades ahead but they
have never made patterns that bin
Everything we have cut out to mess
urement Is too small by the time wo 1
put It on New Yorks big subway
designed to relieve the congestion 01 f
surface traffic was found Just sum
clent to take caro of the Increase In 1
traffic between the time of the incep

crowded as ever Wo have been talk

provejnent and only tbo river towns
have been Interested while wo had
supposed tho railroads were fighting
It Now we learn from Martin A
Knapp chairman of the Interstate
comtn MO commission that the im
provement of the waterways la need
ed to take care of freight the rail
roads can not now and never can
handles Ho iayslt Is not a question
of rolling stock but of terminal fa
cilltles In the cities It would cost
billions of dollars to acquire all the
terminals railroads require to hantlle
their business and then the conges
tion and inconveniences of It all If
completed causo railroads to prefer
present conditions
rUnless our rivers are developed to
their lull carrying capacity the year
around commerce must stagnate and
the whole Industrial system of tHo
country retrograde This 18a great
country greater than we realize To

THE OTHER VIEW OF IT
The pwensboro Messenger bump
tiously says
A neighboring dally boasts that It
printed the presidents message in
full more than twenty columns but
liberal reward probably could not
discover one of Its readers who will
admit that be read all of It The
Messenger confesse tb have printed
sixcolumn synopsis of It but the
Now York World the greatest Amen
can newspaper boiled it down to less
than three coljimna Of all our presi
dents Roosevelt haaprove the most
prolix Ho discusses everything un
der tho sun In his messages and
makes recommendations to congress
of legislation on most frivolous sub
jects which congress never notices
Ills last message was In largo part
but a repetition of tho speeches he
has mado In different parts of the
country Our boastful contemporary
would have been more enterprising
had It done as the Messenger did
but tho World beat us all In handling
the message
To put It otherwise the Messenger
says that Its subscribers ehaM read
only so much ol the presidential mes
sage as the Messenger deems It worth
while for them to see

PY s I said Y must go
Oh she walled you may bd
bda
Nonsense said I In broad day
light at the Palace Hotel Im much
more likely to be killed before I get
home tonight
lier earnestness impressed me but
my resolution was not shaken Mother
Borton rested her head on the table
in despair at my obstinacy
Well if you will you mill she
said at last and an old womans
warnings are nothing to you But if
you will put your head in the traps Ill
do my best to make it safe after you
git it there You Jlst sit still honey
And she took the candle and went
to a corner where she seated herself
at a stand
havek
some difficulty in arranging her words
to her liking She seemed to be writ
ing but tho pen did not flow smoothly
At last she was done and sealing her
work In on envelope sho brought the
flickering light once mote to the tablo
Tak that she said thrusting tho
envelope into my hand If you find
a oneeyed man when you git into
trouble give him that letter Ive writ
ye and it may do ye some good Its
tho best I can do for ye Youd better
mayo
need It
I thanked Mother Borton and
pressed her hand and she held the
candle as I tiptoed down the stairs
Joining my waiting guards and went
out Into the night
Where are Barkbouso and Phil
lips I asked as We turned our faces
toward the west
Porter gave a low whistle and as
this failed to bring an answer fob
lowed it with one louder and more pro
longed Wo listened but no response
saids came
Wilson Theres no telling what may
happen when they hear that whistle
lUst Whats raft said Porter
drawing me back Into a doorway
There were running steps on the
block above us and I thought a shad
ow darted from one side of the street
to the other
There seem to be friends waiting
for us said I Just get a good grip
of your clubs boys and keep your
revolvers handy In case they think
they have a call to stop us
Hold on said Porter Theres a
gang of em there I see a don f
em and If were the ones theyre after
we had better cut for It
1 believe you are right said I
peering Into the darkness I could see
a confused mass but whether of men
or boxes I could only guess
Well go up there and you can cut
around the other way said Porter
Theres no need for you to risk It
Theres no need for any one to risk
It Well cut together I
This way then said Wilson I
know this part of town better than
you do Run on your toes And he
darted past Bortona and plunged into
an alley that led toward the north
Porter and I followed as quietly as
possible through the dark and noisome
cutoff to Pacific street Wilson turned
toward the bay and crossing tho
street at tho next corner followed the
main thoroughfare to Broadway
I guess were all right now ho j
gasped as we turned again to hol l I l
west but wed best keep to tho mid
dIe of tho street I
And a little later we were In sight
IAnd I house of mystery which lightI I
mo natsrjma jeraerjaoxrj ema
forbidding and gloomy as ever on
Montgomery street and I was soon In
my room and In bed for what sleep
I could snatch
At the earliest light of the morning
rot
freshed by my short and broken rest
and mado my dispositions for the day
I ordered Porter FItzhugh Brown
Wilson Lockhart and Abrams to wait
for me at the Oakland ferry Trent
who was still weak from his wound I
put In charge of the home guard with
Owens Phillips and Carson as his
companions and gav Ustructlons toI I
look for gal use ho did
not return WalnwrjJH Ilook with
me and hailing a bJffiffdrovo to the
Palace Hotel
There was a rattle of wagons and a
bustle of departing guests as wo drove
Into the courtyard ot the famous hos
telry
I stepped out of tho hark and looked I
about me anxiously Was I to meet the
Unknown or was I to take orders
from some emissary of my hidden em
ployer No answering eye met mine
as I eearchpd the place with eager
glance Neither woman nor man of
all the hurrying crowd had a thought
of me
I glanced at the clock that ticked I
the seconds In the office of tho hotel I
I saw that I had been early and that
It was even now but 20 minutes to the
hour
The minute band had not swapt past tI
tho figure Mil when the door opened
there was a hurried step and two
women stood before me leading a
child between them Both women were
closely veiled and tho child was mut
fled and swathed till Its features could
not be seen
OnQ of tho women was young the
other olderperhaps middleaged
Both were tall and wellmade I looked
eagerly upon them for one of them
must be the Unknown the hidden em
ployer whose task had carried Henry
Wilton to his death wild held my life
In her hands and who fought the des
perate battle with tho power and
hatred of DoddridRO Knapp It was to I
the younger that I turned alt the more I
likely to have the spirit of contest but
It was the older who spoke
Here Is your charge Mj Wilton I
she said In a low agitated voice As I
she spoke I felt the faint suggestion
of the peculiar perfume that had
greeted me from tho brief letters of
the UnknownI I
I am ready for orders I said with
a bow

Your orders are In this envelope
