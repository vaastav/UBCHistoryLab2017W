4 a Cordial GreetingGreat Ovation
^a Tendered Gen. Joe Wheeler.-
Washington, Dec. 6When "the sen
ate convened yesterday to begin the
closing session of the Fifty-fifth con
gress the chamber presented a notable
and beautiful appearance. By 11
o'clock the public and private galleries
were filled almost to their capacity
with a distinguished assemblage, in
cluding many ladies in brilliant attire.
On the floor of the senate the display
of flowers was unusually beautiful,
eveu for the ooeuing day of a session
of congress. The odor of the flowers
filled the ehamber. The memorable
scenes enacted in the chamber during
the last session and the momentous
events that have occurred since con
gress last adjourned, created a feeling
of intense expectancy, both by the
spectators and members of the senate.
This was made manifest by the long
lines of people in the corridors anxious
[to gain admission to the galleries, and
'by the early arrival of senators on the
floor. Through courtesy of the vice
.president the members of the joint
high commission were admitted to the
floor of the senate and were the re
cipients of much attention. During a
I recess of three-quarters of an hour,
while the senate was awaiting the pre
sentation of the message from the
(president from the president, the mem
jbers of the joint high commission held
an informal levee, greeting personally
nearly all the members of the Ameri
can senate. The reading of the presi
dent's message, which occupied two
hours and eighteen minutes, was re
ceived with very careful attention for
an hour, but after that the senators
'drifted to the cloak rooms and to the
committee rooms, where they could
,peruse the message at their leisure
the printed copies which had been
'furnished.
IN THIS HOUSE.
Reading of the Message Followed
With Close Attention.
Washington, Dec. 6. The opening
session of congress yesterday was a
spectacular occasion, animated and
brilliant. There were more than the
usual number of distinguished per
sonages in the thronged galleries, in
cluding many representatives of for
eign governments, high officials and
^ladies and gentlemen conspicuous in
social and political life. The greetings
of the members were most cordial and
there was no outcropping of partisan
rancor to mar the occasion. One of the
most striking incidents was the cor
dial meeting between the floor leaders
of the respective sides, Messrs. Ding
ley and Bailey. In view of the gossip
about the possibility of Mr. Bailey be
ing deposed as the minority leader it
is significant that the speaker named
Mr. Bailey as the minority member of
the committee to wait upon the presi
dent, an honor always bestowed upon
the recognized leader of the minority.
Speaker Reed received a warm wel
come from both sides of the house
when he ascended the rostrum to call
the house to order, but perhaps the
greatest personal ovation to any mem
ber was that given Maj. Gen. Wheeler
of Alabama, who has not been seen by
many of his old colleagues since he
went to the front at the head of the
cavalry division of Gen. Shaffer's
army. Mr. W. A. Stone of Pennsyl
vania, Mr. McMillin of Tennessee and
Mr. Sayers of Texas, who have been
elected governors of their respective
states since congress adjourned, were
also overwhelmed with congratula
tions. The floral tributes were unusu
ally numerous and made the hall a
veritable bower of beautiful flowers.
The proceedings themselves were dull,
all interest centering in the reading of
the president's message. For over two
hours the clerk droned through the
long document, but the interest of the
members and the spectators never
flagged. With rapt attention they fol
lowed the president's- recital of the
war, and listened eagerly to every sug
gestion or recommendation he had to
offer. No expression of approval or
disapproval interrupted the reading.
CUBANS ARE: SATISFIED.
President's Message Strengthens
Their Faith in the United States.
Washington, Dec. 7. Gen. Garcia,
who is somewhat indisposed, spent
the evening at his hotel. Mr. Quesada,
speaking of the Cuban commission,
said: "The president's message is re
garded as very satisfactory. Its pub
lication at this time will do good, coun
teracting reports that have been
spread in Cuba by people who have
not the real interests of the country at
heart. We have full faith in the Unit
ed States and in the just intentions of
President McKinley, and the men who
have made the revolution of Cuba are
aiming to work with the United States
to establish a government tbat will
have the respect of nations. Gen.
Garcia is well satisfied with the inter

RESULT IN BLOODSHED.
Would an Attempt to Arrest In
dians.
St. Paul, Dec. 6. Ed L. Warren,
deputy United States marshal, who
went through the battle of Leech Lake
with the troops, and who is familiar
with all the Indians in the northern
part of the state, having lived among
the Chippewas for several years, said
to a reporter that there was little ques
tion that any attempt to arrest an In
dian on either ^he Leech Lake or
White Earth reservations would result
in bloodshed. The least provocation
would start a war and it would take
many troops to suppress an uprising.
"The Indians are ugly and insolent"
he said. "They claim that they won a
victory from the soldiers at Sugar
Point and they are ready to try con
clusions with them again. There is no
char ce for an officer to go on either of
the reservations and make an arrest.
The Indians laugh at the offlceis and
say that they will never be arrested.
They say that they have whipped the
forces of the United States and that
they can whip all that can be sent
against them. As far as an officer is
concerned he is of no more use on the
reservation than a yellow dog."
Indians Disappear.
Park Rapids, Minn., Dec. 6. Four
teen of the White Earth Indians have
been encamped on a small lake about
fifteen miles north of here and have
been killing considerable game con
trary to law. Friday Game Warden
Stephens of Detroit, in company with
D. W. Clason of this place, went out
and attempted to arrest them. The
Indians resisted, refused to be arrest
ed, drove the men out of the camp and
threatened to scalp them if they came
back. Stephens and Clason came at
once to Park Rapids, swore out war
rants and placed them in the hands of
Sheriff Rombough. Acting upon orders
from Warden Fullerton of St. Paul a
pesse of twenty-five men was organ'-'
ized and went up after the reds. The
sheriff and some of the men have re
turned and report that no Indians can
be found. Stephens and others are still
out. Warden Fullerton has arrived
from St. Paul an dis awaiting the ar
rival of Stephens. He says if the cul
prits can be identified he will go to
the reservation and take them. Trouble
may result.
