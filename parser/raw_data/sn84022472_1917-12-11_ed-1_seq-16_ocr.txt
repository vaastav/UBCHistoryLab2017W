who to the Alldeutsche Blatter" have
hailed the war as "the long desired

l It is quite impassible to go over 'all
: the pot-spoutings and plans for the
; future which flow from the beer tables
of Germany to the German newspa
j pers and which are spread broadcast
! with the consent of the censorship
1 and the press-licensing office. But
all these peace projects, even the most
; modest, such as that suggested by
j Bcheidemann, all agree upon one
point, colossal Increase of German
power through robbery, and in con-
nectlen therewith the- leadership of
I Germany over the other powers.
' This is the peace, the rotten peace.
to which the Entente powers are in
vited " .
, This peace stgnlfies nothing but an
endless period of everlatsing wars, a
I period of renewed competition in arm
; amenta, that will destroy the last rem
j cant of the spiritual and moral force
; of Europe.
' Far more than the 'foes of Germany
I has the German . people to dread such
i & petMSi For the German people it
1 would be the last reactionary stroke,
the wretched autocracy of the Junker
and the war maker. For decades to

be sent to new murder by Its all-pow-j
erful War 'party,

The Allies have no choice. To a
pe&a proposal of Buch a government
. &a this they can make no other' answer
thmar to eentinue fighting.
One thing is certain: with the gov
i rmiMBt, with the house ipf rulers who
I have rtiMilared this war and have un-
cftaa tied It, With the man who has
v e otsed the word "a scrap of paper,"
I v i-'A the man who has declared hlm-
' t answerable for the violation of
I Ilgiaa neutrality, with the man who

Whoever still retains sentiment for
the freedom of peoples and the honor
of men, who sees in humanity some
t:iing move than a herd of cattle which
d aserves to be mastered by the stick
of the Prussian corporal, that man
would rather anything, even the erash
i of civilisation 1 tee if, to this Prusslan
; German Krapire of the world. A Prua
! skmised earth would mean the end of
! all that makes life worth living.
The Allies must keep on with the
war, for they will not submit- to the
yoke of a brutal Junker caste, of. a
fanatical ' military horde, devoid of
righteousness and human feeling.
j The war makers will use this farce
j of peace to fan the "righteous wrath"
i of the German people against other
; peoples; they wish to exploit for their
i own purposes of war the war-weari-i
ness of the German people and its

Selectmen Promulgate Many
New Regulations for
Department
(Special to The Farmer.)
Stratford, Dec. 10 An assistant fire
chief was appointed and a -few rules,
concerning Stratford Firs Depart
ment, No. 1, of which Allen D. Jud-
son is chief, were formulated and
unanimously passed by the selectmen
at a meeting held by them at the
town hall. George Hattersley, presi-
dent of the Nichols avenue fire de-
partment, was appointed assistant !
chief. Mr. Hattersley is well known
about town and has been affiliated
With the Nichols avenue volunteer fire
fighters for a number of years.
. As regards the rules for fire head
is n salary attached to his new posi
quarters laid down by the town fath
ers, political dopesters about the
town are in a quandary. Some are of
the opinion that Chief -Allen D. Jud
son has been remiss In his duty while
others say that it is for betterment
of the department.
It was voted at the meeting hat
Clerk Harold C. Lovell write Chief
Judson that under no consideration
In case of fire at night shall he leave
the engine house without the night
crew for both chemicals. The chief
was also instructed to break in ten
men who belong to the company and
demonstrate to them how to run both
cars, also ' Instruction as to how to
make hydrant connections and handle
chemical tanks.
About two months ago the select
men purchased two nicxie plated Py
rene extinguishers for the Nichols
avenue fire house. Somehow that
company never, received them and
notified the selectmen. An Investi
gation by that body revealed the fact
that the extinguishers were still in
possession of Fire Co. No. 1. . The
result was that Chief Judson was or
dered to take the Pyrenes from his
car and deliver them to the Nichols
avenue department and put the two
brass Pyrene extinguishers lying
loosely around the fire house, on his
car. ' '
Present at the meeting were First
Selectman James Lally and Selectman
Fred W. Nettleton, and Clerk Harold
C. Lovell. Selectman John J. Wil
liams was unable to attend on ac
count of Illness.

No -wonder the Germans want, to
talk pesbce now, as their idea of war
Is to do the fighting at times when
the other fellows aren't ready.
After spending only twice what
they can afford instead of three times
as much, many people feel so proud
of their thrift that they then pro
