It is rumored that Gov. Thayer will
call an extra session of the legislature
next summer to redistrict the state con
gressionally. It is supposed that well
be entitled to three new congressmen.
Journal
The editor of the Record is not of
those who believe that Gov. Thayer will
ever call a special session to redistrict
the state into congressional districts.
There is no doubt, however, of the fact
that Nebraska will have at least two, or
perhaps three, additional congressmen,
after the census of ,90 but these repre
sentatives can be elected at large for one
term as was done in Kansas and some
other states after the census of 180.
Should the state legislature be increas
ed in numbers after the census of 'JJO.there
might be some sense in an extra session,
but the Nebraska legislature now has as
many members as it can have without a
change in the constitution.
The Osceola record, in the above para
graph has an eye to the expense of an
extra session of the legislature, and the
saving of that much money to the state,
which is well. It may well be doubted
whether either method "will make any
essential difference it the quality of the
men th s will be elected to represent
Nebratka in the national legislature, but
tfc demand of the, times is that, as much
as is possible, officials shall be elected by
those most nearly concerned, and if
this sentiment asserts itself sufficiently,
the people of the several districts (to be)
will select their congressmen without
being entangled in foreign coalitions, so
to speak.
Senator Paddock's bill providing for
the erection of public buildings in cities
and towns where there are first- and
second-class post offices is even still
more in favor with congressmen and the
public generally than it was last year.
There is a strong probability that it will
become a law at the current session. If
Mr. Paddock can succeed in his endeav
ors to place this measure on the statute
book he will be entitled to the regards of
his fellow-citizens all over the country.
It may seem a small consideration at
first view, but we think it well worth
weighing as an argument in favor of this
measure that, by it, the reminders of na
tional sovereignty and supremacy will
be wonderfully increased. We have
always regarded the national currency
as of untold value in this respect, aside
from its intrinsic worth as a circulating
medium. The nation of the United
States of America is worthy every citi
zen's best endeavors, and when we shall
have the fruits of Mr. Paddock's bill, the
emblem of the Union,the flag of the free,
will wave over many a structure
throughout the country, reminding citi
zens at all times that the power of all
the people for defense against all mor
tal foes, is a living fact and not a mere
fancy of the mind. Nations are like in
dividuals in that they should do what
they can to develop their natural re
sources. Let petitions and letters go up
to congressmen from every portion of
this broad country for the passage of
Senator Paddock's bill
Jafersea Davis Dead.
Last Thursday at 12:30, Jefferson
Davis, the ex-president of the late so-called
Southern Confederacy, departed this
life. He was born June 3d, 1808, and
was therefore eighty-one years and six
months old. Educated at West Point
he served his fellow-citizens as a lieuten
ant of the army, as a congressman, twice
as secretary of war, as colonel of a Mis
sissippi regiment during the war of
Mexico, being severely wounded at
Buena Vista. This portion of his career
was a credit to himself and his country.
He was chosen president of the Confed
eracy, holding the position until the
armies of rebellion were overthrown.
Captured' at Ixwinville, Ga April, 5,
he was sent as a prisoner of war to
Fortress Monroe, where he remained
until '67,' when he was released on bail.
He was fully released in yS, since which
time hi lad resided in Mississippi. He
was certainly an able man, and had the
c.afidence of the great body of the
southern people, who were good judges
of men except when it related to their
"peculiar institution,'' as slavery was
called.- The London News says: "The
splendid clemency of the great popular
government in the case of Davis has
been justified by the result, Davis pas
sing his old age in peace, has stood an
evidence of the absolute security of the
federal system.''

A Mi assart Remedy for Has; Cholera.
While hog cholera is again ravaging
the herds of Nebraska, it ia worth the
while of owners to take the advice of
one of the most prominent stock feeders
of Missouri, who considers his remedy
one of absolutely certainty, thus doing
away with patent nostrums. It is sim
ply crude petroleum unrefined kerosene
oil. This may be bought for $5 or $6
per barrel, and can be procured 'easily.
It is fed to the hogs in their food-
shelled corn or other food. Take them
off the pasture, if in the summer, and
mix this with their food. Feed it once
or twice a month before the hogs get the
disease; apply it to them externally as a
disinfectant, and give it to them while
dying. It is also one of the best lini
ments and we urge our suffering friends
to try it A hog breeder says that it
saved him $1,000 in one year by raising
his hogs. Schuyler Quill.

Moses Hull, the spiritualist, lectured

James Hutchins, was arrested at
Hastings December 7, and taken by
Sheriff Flynn to Norfolk, charged with
shooting with intent to ldll.
Frank Murphy, a member of the board

The beet sugar plant at Grand Island
if properly carried out will make a grand
sugar factory. The plant with grounds,
when completed will cost $2,000,000, and
will give employment to about five
thousand people, including those en
gaged in growing and marketing. And
thus Nebraska rises to the top.
A terrible' accident occurred last Fri
day near Bassett, by which four children
were horribly burned. In the absence
of the parents the children procured a
can of powder, which weighed four
pounds, which became ignited from a
spark from the stove and exploded, pro
ducing the frightful result of burning
the four children.
Senator Manderson has taken the cue
from the experiments in sugar beet
raising in Nebraska and will devote 'a
good deal of his attention this winter to
furthering the interests of the sugar in
dustry in this state. He will endeavor
to get an appropriation for the purpose
of carrying on experiments at Lincoln.
Mr. Manderson should have every en
couragement in his new work. (Fre

N. W. Wells shows much enterprise in

These men have nothing particularly
left at Lynn and had better locate west
where there is a great trade and scarcely
any factories. If we could get a
boot and shoe factory here it would be a
grand thing. All credit to Mr. Welk for

Wssaiagtea Letter.
From oar regular correapoadent.
It is no disparagement of the other
candidates for speaker all excellent
gentlemen, and good republicans to
say that the election of Mr. Reed gives
more, general satisfaction in the party
than would that of any of the others.
There are several reasons why this is so,
the principal of which is Mr. Reed's stal
wart combativeness in favor of what he
believes is right This quality was con
sidered to be a political necessity in the
man who is to preside over the next
house which contains elements that
make it certain to be turbulent and hard
to control. With Mr. Reed in the chair
the republicans have no fears that .over
consideration for the feelings of the dem
ocrats will have any influence in divid
ing the thousands of knotty questions
that are certain to come up from time to
time. In short, the situation demanded
a fighter one who knows how and does
not fear to hit out straight from the
shoulder when the occasion calls for it,
and Tom Reed fills the bill. That Mr.
Reed will make a successful speaker and
that he will add to his already great
reputation as a statesman, your corres
pondent does not doubt '
The other officers of the house are
equally satisfactory to republicans. Hon.
Edward McPhersonof Pennsylvania, the
new clerk, needs no introduction to the
republicans of the country; he has been
cherk of every republican house since he
was himself an honored member of that
body, and his long and faithful service
as secretary of the republican congres
sional committee made it eminently fit
and proper that this or any other posi
tion that he might have desired should
have been gladly given him. Hon. A. J.
Holmes, ex-representative from Iowa, is
the new sergeant-at-arms, and a good
one he makes. Charles- W. Adams, of
Maryland, doorkeeper; J. A. Wheat, of
Wisconsin, postmaster, and Rev. C. P.
Ramsdell, of the District of Columbia,
chaplain, completes the list of new
house officials.
The president's message is a document
that President Harrison has every right
to feel proud of and it was enthusiastic
ally received by the republicans in and
out of congress. Even the democrats,
that is, the more conservative among
them, agree that it will compare favor
ably as a state paper with those of the
ablest of his predecessors. No person
familiar with the record and public ut
terances of the president expected that
his message would be other than it is
a strong, scholarly and statesman-like
presentation of the policy of the republi
can party. No stronger argument in
favor of republican control of this coun
try has ever been written than this first
annual message of Benjamin Harrison,
and all that remains necessary to make
republican victory in 1892 a certainty, is
that congress will intelligently carry out
its recommendations.
The opening of a new session of
congress always makes a big day in
Washington, 'and this has been no' ex
ception to the rule. Long before the
hour of opening every available inch of
space in the galleries of both house and
senate was filled by spectators. Even
the corridors were crowded with men
and women all anxious to see the Fifty-
first congress start on its voyage to
Ah, that's the question, we saw the ves
sel launched and started off under a full
head of steam, but owing to the danger
ous rocks, whirlpools and breakers
through which it will have to navigate,
no man can say with any certainty where
the voyage will end. We only know
that the good ship has a full comnle-
ment of experienced pilots and navigat
ors aboard, and to them the public con
fidently look for the safety of the vessel.
At high noon the vice president made
his debut a a presiding officer by ran-
ping the senate to order. A foreigner,
judging from Mr. Morton's actions and
tanner, would have sunnosed that h
had been perforating that duty for year,
aq penecuyseu-posnessed was he. Mr.
Clark, the democratic clerk of the last
houe,went through the same ceremony
for the new house in a very creditable
tanner. The members of both house and
annate from the new states had thous
ands of opera glaanss focused upon then
during the day, and the unuwully large
on third it

Calkoaa Writes of the New Secretary of
State, aad BU Oepnty. aad Ia Reminded
of Nebraska's first Secretary Personal
Gossip.
(Special Correspondence.)
Lincoln. Neb., Dec. 10. The state
house is not a very handsome building.
Its somewhat squatty appearance is in
harmony with a disorderly array of
native timber surrounding it, while the
approaches, walks and abortive attempts
at ornamentation are calculated to de
press the most buoyant disposition. The
interior, however, happily belies the out
side. The arrangement, since the re
moval of the heating boilers to a house
on the grounds, is very convenient and
the rooms are reasonably well lighted
and furnished. It should be recorded,
however, that legislative orators declare
the acoustics of the senate chamber and
representative hall to be atrociously bad.
The spectators and auditors have never
been known to find fault in this regard,
and there are people who consider the de
ficiency in acoustics a blessing. The
office of the secretary of state has been
of late a mild
Center of Interest,
and your correspondent descended upon
it one day to see what could be gathered
from and about the two gentlemen in it
who have just acquired increased promi
nence by their connection with it. The
election of Secretary Laws to congress
made a vacancy, with a year to run.
The appointment of Deputy Cowdry to
lie secretary made another vacancy.
There were numerous candidates for
both places, but no appointments could
probably have given better satisfaction,
and there is certainly no question about
the fitness of the appointees. I am quite
soberly convinced that both places were
filled with a due regard for public inter
est and if anybody's political plans are
furthered by it, well, so much the better
for the plans. Mr. Cowdry had been
deputy and was thoroughly conversant
with the business of the office, which is
admittedly the most import mt and re
sponsible in the list of servants of the
state. Mr. Bell's experience through his
whole life is just the sort of training to
equip him for the easy, rapid and em
cient discharge of his new duties.
Ben. R. Cowdry,
appointed secretary of state to succeed
Laws, was bom in Mecca, Trumbull

county, O., in 1847. Parenthetically,
Shakespeare said, "Some men are born
great" Were he writing now he would
say "Some men are born in Ohio," and
leave the reader to infer the rest Mr.
Cowdry's youth was spent on a hillside
farm, where he grubbed stumps and
stones in the usual way. He attended
the Western Reserve college for three
years, but did not finish the regulation
course. In 1867 he removed to Mazo
maniae, Dane county, Wis., where he en
gaged in the banking business. He re
mained there eleven years, coming to
Nebraska in 1878, occupying a position
for a few months in a bank at Kearney,
after which he went to Bloomington,
Franklin county. Later he established
a bank at Oakdale, but sold
out and went to Columbus, w here he en
gaged in law, real estate and loan busi
ness. He was appointed deputy col
lector of internal revenue under the ad
ministration of Hon. George W. Post
This position he held for two and a half
years, resigning to accept a secretary
ship of the state railway commission.
This he held until his appointment as
deputy secretary of state, which was fol
lowed in due time by his appointment as
secretary.
Mr. Cowdry was married at the rather
early age of 20, in Wisconsin, to Miss
Bnoda A. Powers, a charming and culti
vatedlady. They have three children.all
nearly grown up, a son and two daugh
ters, the latter of whom ornament soci
ety in the capital city. Mr. Cowdry still
considers Columbus bis home, and so
has not acquired property in the city.
He occupies a handsome modern house
at 1200 H street He is a gentleman of
remarkable geniality and has hosts of
friends, but there is newly observable a
possible trace of nervousness in front of
the inevitable interviewer, there is no
question but Mr. Cowdry will conduct
the affairs of hi office very acceptably
and with the ame reliable and prompt

of public duties for a number of years

braska politics he should be a candidate
for the secretaryship at the next general
election, when the term he is filling will
expire, but he has apparently given the
subject no consideration.

By the "four most prominent -men"
was meant ex-Governor David Butler,
ex-Secretary Kennard, ex-Auditor Gil
lespie and W. H. B. Stout Around
these men. during the exciting days of
early statehood, raged constantly apo
litical, factional and personal storm cen
ter. At times it seemed that all men
were against them. Yet they never
flinched. The story of those brave old
days cannot be told in a chapter, nor
even a volume.
All four of the men are still living,
Governor Butler on his Pawnee county
farm and the others here. Of Kennaril
sufficient has been said. Butler lias had
financial urw and downs enough to have
worn out the soul cf the ordinary man,
the while taking an Ishmaelitish hand in
politics. He was at the last session of
the legislature an applicant for relief
from financial hardships infl.cted upon
him by his impeachment as governor.
He ought to have it, but the horde of
cormorants who infest the lobbies and
fatten upon claims will doubtless pre
vent, though iot intentionally.
Gillespie subsided from public view
under a cloud about the time he left the
auditor's office. He was a case of col
lapse in toto. After being several years
absent from tho state he came back
here and now leads an unostentatious
life, somewhat of the hand-to-mouth or
der. Stout, a big-framed, big-hearted, dar
ing man, full of resource and self-confidence,
a great manager and organizpr,
made money hand over fist for years.
He was accounted lucky, when he was
only skillful. Perhaps he began himself
to believe in his luck. At anv rate it is
whispered that he put vast sum? of
money into a mine in the mountains.
It did not pan out. and while Stout is
successfully conducting heavy public
contracts and his credit is A 1, it is gen
erally understood that he is not a man of
wealth.
Those Men Made
Lincoln the capital, and to them were
due the first steps on the highway to the
city hood she now enjoys. No man's his
tory should be written till he is dead.
What they have done for the city is
largely forgotten, while the effect of the
slings and arrows of their enemies still
remain.

Parents should be careful that their
children do not contract colds during
the fall or winter months. Such colds
weaken the lungs and air passages, mak
ing the child much more likely to con
tract other colds during the winter. It
is this succession of colds that causes
catarrh and bronchitis or paves the way
for consumption. Should a cold be con
tracted, loose no time but cure it as
quickly as possible. A fifty cent bottle
of Chamberlain's Cough remedy will
cure any cold in a few days and leave
the respiratory organs strong and
healthy. For sale by all druggists.
