At noon speaker Randall rai ped the House to or

The roll call showed 229 members present. Two
new members, Messrs. Bailey of New York, and
Jfalora of Nevada, then took the iron clad oath,
and Messrs, Atkins Cox and Garfield were ap
pointed to inform the President Congress was in

After recess the President's message was re
ceived from Private Secretary Rogers and read,
is
THE ELECTIONS IN THE SOUTH.
When the reading of the message was ended,
Mr, Wood (N. Y.) rose and moved that it be re
ferred to Ihe Committee of the Whole of the
House and ordered printed. But, first, be desired
to mske some comments upon It. Although, as a
whole, the document was highly safafactory, yet
there were some references in it which should be
net at the earliest practicable moment. He re
ferred to that part relating to the Southern States.
Ee(Wood) failed to see (what tbe President saw)
Dy disposition In tbe Bouth to avoid or annul in
any degree recent Constitutional amendments.
He failed to fee any Judication In the South at
any election, at any time, under any clrcumstano-
for a series of years of an unwlllli guess to live
in entire amity with the whole country In regard
to the laws or to Ihe Government. He regretted
the President, who bad commenced his adminis
tration with such a noble and patriotic position,
as against military depotism exercised by his pre
deceasor, should now indicate a change of policy.
He bad watched with Interest the course of the
administration in order to see whether the Presl
dent would he forced from the manly and noble
position taken by him. He knew that there was
awlt gof the Republican party dlssatlnled wltii
that position, and it bad been a matter of interest
fo the whole country to know whethi r the Presi
dent would continuously maintain bis attitude.
TVhile the President expressed his views In very
mild and very decorous language, vet he Indies-
ted quite clearly that the condition of things iu
-the houth was not satisfactory to him.
The President bad referred especially to the
elections in South Carolina and Louisiana. He
iad been able lo single out two States, and only
two isolated instances In those Stales. That was
an indicatlou ol vacillation on the part of the
Executive, and It was only beesure It was such
n Indication that he (Wood) felt It his duty to
declare that there was no foundation for the alle

REPLY OF MR. GARFIELD.
Mr. Garfield replied to Mr. Wood. He character
ised It as very unusual to Interrupt the ordinary form
of proceeding (which was simply to referto the Pres
ident's message and order Us printing) by debating
any of Its suggestions, and he thought the kind of
suggestions made by the gentleman from New York
te still more unusual. The exact language of that
part of the message, with wtalck the gentleman found
tault was not, In nls (Garfield's) mind, but the gentle
man's language was very plain. He (Wood) crlti
ixed certain references lu the President's message as
to some disturbances In the course of the Federal
election In several States; contrasted that with what
lie chose to call the noble beginning of the adminis
tration In favor ofself-Goveniment,and said that the
nu snnwn vaccination because he had
sen lit to refer to disturbances In the Federal elec
Won. If the right of a State to attend to Ha own local
oocerna oodisturbed was In any way Inconsistent
with lb right of the national Government to attend
o national elections, and If that was what the gen
toman ealled "vacillation," be hoped that they
aooald all "vacillate" In Ihat way. He (Garfield)
ad never made himself a particular advocate or de
ceader of any administration for Its vacillation or
waat of vacillation, but If tbe gentleman could make
t better ease against the administration than he had
uHe,lMhad not very well "opened the ball"tbli
ariater.
That gentleman could not see that there bad been
amy disturbance lo matters of elections, (after s
w u. Mtp in nil own state, be (Wood) bad seen
lens, If not of disturbance, at least of "vacillation,"
the city of his adoption, and In bis State, but they
srere not such Instances of "vacillation" as tbe gen
tleman would have brought up In discussion. It did
not signify that the gentleman had not seen any dis
turbance In the elections elsewhere. If the President
had seen tbem It was the President's duty to say so
and the President had said so In bis message. If the'
Fresldent bad seen them, and had not said so he
would not only have been guilty , of negligence but
of positive fault. The President had referred io It
modestly. He had Invited tlie attention of Congress
tojf. Did the gentleman object to having attention

on Oie ether side any reason why be did not wlnh ,h.
attention of Congress pointed to elections In the
Honthera BtalesT For his own part he welcomed
such a calling of attention. The President ought to
thanked for It by the gentleman from New York,
aa It afforded an opportunity to have this "vadllv

stated that a bold, open acknowledged lutimiaauon
had been employed, notably In South Carolina, and
In districts where there had been an overwhelming
majority of one political party. No sign of any such
majority had appeared at all. This might be exag
gerated, but If so, It was one that was brought oast
through tin public press, and one which Oongross so
notable at present fur Investigating all ohancet of
wrongdoing should Investigate, He supposed that
his friends on the othorsldu would welcome the Presi
dent's suggestion as exactly In the lino of their con
duct hitherto. He hoped they would not stifle Inves
tigation.
FURTHER ANIMATED DISCUSSION.
Mr, Wood defended the position he had taken, and
repeated his expression of regret that the President
had picked out two casea and deemed then) of sultl
clout Importance to present them to the world In his
annual message It was an Indication that the ultra
wing of the ltepuhllcnn party was forcing the Execu
tive to aid it In displaying the bloody shirt, so that
the party could hold on lo Its 111 golen power and
continue that power by the plunder of the treasury,
Mr. Dale said It was alleged by the gentleman from
New York that the President had been dragooned by
the radical wing oT I lie Republican party Into the
course Indicated In his message, and that that wing
ol the party was likely to control the Administra
tion. He would tell the gentleman that on the great
and fundamental doctrine of protecting a citizen In
all his rights, there was no Radical nor Conservative
wing In the Republican party, but there was one par
ty In the land united to a man on a proposition that
au American citizen, North, Houth and everywhere,
should be protected In the exercise of his constitu
tional rights.
Mr. Cox, (N. Y.), asked If the gentlemen from Ohio
and Maine failed to remember how the "Tapeworm"
ticket of California had been run by the navy yard.
Had they denounced tapeworm polltlcsr Not much I
He (Cox) shrunk from no Investigation Into any elec
tion, North or Houth.
Mr. Townsend, (N. Y.), made some remark which
was not heard hy Mr. Cox or the reporters, but at
which some of the members around him laughed,
Mr. Cox noticed It and said he did not know what
they were laughing at, but It was possibly for want of
thought,
Mr. Townsend said he had been making a remark
about "cipher telegrams."
Mr. Cox retorted that that was another of the "va
cillations" of the other side; that there were "vacil
lations" all over the country, but that with all these
"vacillations" the old Democratic party would have
the next Senate and the House also.
The discussion, which was animated, here closed,
Mr, Wood's motion to refer and print the mes
sage was agreed to.
The Military Academy and Fortification Appropri
bills were reported and notice given of early
action on them.
The House then adeurned.
THE INSANE.
Annual Report Superintendent of the
Cleveland Asylum for the Insane.
Tbe annual meeting of Ihe trustees of the
Cleveland Hospital for the Insane was held at
tbe Asylum on Wednesday of last week. All
the trustees were present besides a number of I
visitors. The meeting being also the regular
monthly meeting of the Board, the Superintend
cut's monthly report was received and tiled. It
showed that twenty patients were discharged
during the past mouth, teu of whom were dis
charged cured, six Improved and four unim
proved. The Board met at 10 o'clock in the fore
noon, and most of Ihe lime was spent until din
ner lu the reading of the Superlntendent'sanuual
report, which was very lenglhy and interesting.
After dinner the Board and friends made a short
tour of the wards. In tbe afternoon the Board
held another session, making out Its estimate for
the coming yesr. The estimate was made for
about 11125,000, of which $105,010 will be needed
for cunent expenses and 120,(09 for various im
provements, viz,: Running up thj tower of the
Water IWorkB to greater height, improving the
employes' departments, doing certain grading on
tiie grounds,' and others. After the meeting tea
was served, after which a number of tuegueBts
and trustees started for home, others remained
for the dsnce in tbe evening. Following are
pretty full extracts from the report of Superiu
tendent Strong:

INSANE CRIMINALS.
The law of Ohio authorises the transfer of crim
inals, who become Insane w hile lu the peniten
tiary, to the insane asylums of the State.
Doubtless Iho motive that prompted the t naot
meut of this statute was a kind one. I believe it
to be, however, wrong In principle and damaging
In practice If It can be shown that the presence
or an insane criminal in tne wain or an asvluta
exerts a harmful Influence upon the ward gener
ally, I beg to ask what becomes of that principle
ol benevolence which recognises the rights of the
many aa paramount to the Interests of a single
person? ir several nervous oi mis class (insane
criminals), with a life history abounding in crim
inal antecedents, and with a penitentiary pres
tige, are distributed through tbe various wards of
an asylum, and It can be made clear that their
contract with the greater body of the patients Is
harmful to the latter, and that their presence is
damaging to the institution as a whole, then most
assuredly the principle of their admission is an
erroneous one. It should be borne in mind that
Insanity does not relieve a person, whose instlcts
and practices through life have been of a orlrnln
al nature, of his corrupt notions, vicious quslities
ana wicaea tenaencies. i ne twist wnicn insani
ty may have given to bis brain, and Ihe resulting
crookednessof his mental action, have not chang
ed Ihat qtuility of brain which is the natural pro
duct of the depraved soli and criminal atmos
phere in which It grew. The mental manifesta
tions nf such a person, whether he be sane or in
sane, would very naturally be In accord with the
general drift of bis life-aim and practice In a
wora, wiin nimseii, inose wno nave had large
experience in observing Ihe conduct of these per
sons iu asylums testify uulformly lo the auiiety
annoyance which they give to those in
charge, aud also to the deleterious Influence
which tbey have on the other patients. Their old
burglarious tactics will lead them to steal, or
manufacture keys, to pick locks, ,to cut through
windows, ai d to devise means by which they can
escape themselves; or, perhaps, they will suggest
methods which will ensble others to do so. They

Tbey reuuire buildings which are snonli-
with apartments having thicker walls and par
titions, stronger doors and windows, and heavier
than are required for ordinary asylums.
While the reasons already staled are sufficient to
warrant the exclusion of Insane criminals from
asylums, thtre stU remains another objec
tion. Persons representing the criminal ciass,
whether they have a Penitentiary reeord or not,
should not be received uuder the same asylum
or be gathered wlibln the same walls, where
