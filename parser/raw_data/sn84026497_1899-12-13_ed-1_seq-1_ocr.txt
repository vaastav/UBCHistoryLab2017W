To the St'imtc) mi 1 Hu.c (t Bt'prnsHntatives:
At tho threshold of your dulllKr.itioni
you are culled to mourn with your coun
try nidi the death of Vice-President
Hobnrt, who passed front this life on tin
morning of November 21st last. His greivl
soul now rests In eternal peace. Ilispri
vato life was pure und cleviitcd, while liit
publlo oiirver was over distinguished bj
large citpnoity, stainless inU-grity, and ex
alted motives. Ho has been removed fron:
the high office which ho honored and dig
nilli'd, but his lofty charactor, his devotior
to duty, his honesty of purpose, and noblt
virtues, remain with ils as a priceless leg
acv and example.
Tho fifty-sixth congress convenes In Iti
first regular session with the country In I
condition of timisiiiil prosperity, of univer
sal good will among the people at home,
and in relations of peace and f ricndBhic
with every government ot the world. Out
foreign commerce lias shown groat in
crease in volume and value. The com
blued imports and exports for tho year art
the largest ever shown by a single year In
all our history. Our exports for lKMaloni
exceeded by more than a billion dolluri
our imports and exports combined In
1x70. 'Die imports per capita are 'M pel
cent less than in 1HT0, wlillo tlio export
per capita tire 5S per cent more tlian iu
1-S7U, showing the enlargi d capacity of the
V ni tod States to satisfy tho wants of 1M
own increasing population, as well as to
coutriiiute to those of tho pimples of othcl
nations.
Exports of agricultural products were
t7S4,7(i,l'-. Of manufactured products
we exported in value fct:!ll,5S,Ht, being
larger tl-au any previous year. It- is a
noteworthy fact that the only years in all
our history when the products of our man
ufactories sold abroad exceeded those
bought abroad were IsilS and lN'Jil.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, ISil.l,
the internal revenue receipts were in
creased about 1UO,0K),000.

Irinsiiry i shown by the fact that on Do

was .IS.UH.Kir.T-.', of which $.,:t'.,744,

conditions of conlldinco which prevail
throiiKhoni the country have brought goit
into mow general use, and customs re
celpts uru now almost entirely puld in thai
coin.
Strong Position of the Treasury.
The strong position of the treasury with
rcsH-ct to cash on hand and the favorable
showing made by the revenues have made
it possible f.ir the sei-retcry of the treasury
to take action under the provisions of sec
tion :l,tV,4, revised statutes, relating to tho
sinking fluid. Receipts exceeded expen
ditures for the first live months of the cur
rent fiscal year by $i:i,4l3,3slMU, and. ai
mentioned above, tho secretary of the
treasury estimates that there will bo a
surplus of approximately $t!).ouo,uou at the
end of the year. I'ndcr such conditions
It was deemed advisable and proper to re
sume compliance with tho provisions ol
tiie sinking fund law, which for eight
yenrs has not been done because of defi
ciencies in tlio revenues. Tho treasury
department therefore offered to purchase
during November J-.'.YtOMioo of tho 5 pet
cent loan of 11KII, or tho 4 per cent funded
loan of lis 17, at the current market price.
The amount offered and purchased during
Jiovcmls-r was ls,4os,(oo. The premium
paid by the government on such pur
chases was $.',iii:l,"c'l, and the net Faving
in Interest was about $-.',8S5,W)U. The suc
cess of this operation was sufficient to In
itio e the government to continue the offer

for labor ul higher wagca-givca to the
body of the people a larger power to ab
sorb the circulating medium. It is fur
ther true that year by year, with larger
areas of land under cultivation, the in
creasing volume of agricultural pnslucts
cotton, corn and wheat culls for a
larger volume of money supply. This Is
especially noticeable nt the crop-harvesting
and crop-moving period.
In its curlier history the national bank
ing net seemed to prove a reasonable ave
nue through which needful additions to
the circulation could from time to time Is
made. Changing conditions have appar
ently rendered it now Inoperative to that
end. The high margin in bund securities
r-nired, resulting from large premiums
which government bonds command in the
market, or the t-ix on note issues, or both
operating together, appear to be the in
fluences which impair its public utility.
The attention of congress Is respectfully
iuvltcd to this important matter, witu
the view ol a-sr'Mining whether or not
fuch reasonable n-oilfioatlons can bt

render its esrvioo In tho particulars here
referred to more responsivo to the people'l
needs. I again urge that national banki
lie authorized to organize with a capital ol
Urged Gobi Standard Legislation.
I urgently recommend that to support
the existing gold standard, and to main
tain "the parity in value of tho coins ol
the two metals (gold and silver) and the
riual power of every dollar at all times in
the market and in thu payment of debts,"
tho secretary of the treasury be given oil
ditional powerand charged with tho duty
to sell United States bonds and to employ
such other effective means ns may bo nec
essary to those ends. The authority should
include the power to sell bonds .on long
und short time, as conditions may re
quire, and should provide for a rate of in
terest lower than that fixed by tho Bet of
January, 14, lH7o. While there is now no
commercial fright which withdraws gold
from tho government, but, on tho con
trary, such widespread confidence that
gold seeks tho trcatairy demanding paper
money in exchange, yet the very situation
points to the present as the most fitting
time to mako adequate provision to in
sure the continuance of the gold standard
ami of public confidence in the ability and
purpose of the government to meet all its
obligations in the money which tho civi
lized world recognizes as the best. The
financial transactions of the government
are conducted upon a gold basis. Wo re
ceive gold when wo sell Unitod States
bonds and use gold for their payment. We
are maintaining the parity of all the
money issued or coined by authority of
tho government. Wo are doing these
things with the means at hand. Haptvly
at the present time we are not compelled
to resort to loans to supply gold. It has
been done in the past, however, and may
have to be done in the future. It behooves
us, therefore, to provide at one the best
means to nioet the emergency when it
arises, and the best means are tiiose which
are tho most cert 'dn and economical.
Those now authorized have the virtue
neither of directness norecononomy. We
liavo already eliminated one of the causes
of our financial plight and embarrass
ment during the years 18:lii, Mil, lHlifi and
Intnl. Our receipts now equal our expen
ditures; deficient revenues no longer
create alarm. Lot us remove the only re
maining cuuso by conferring the full and
necessary power on tho secretary of tho
treasury and impose upon him the duty
to uphold the present gold standard and
preserve the coins of the two metals on a
parity with each other, which is there
jieatedly declared policy of tlio United
States.
Iu this connection I repeat my former
recommendations that a portion of tho
gold holdings shall be placed in a trust
fund from which greenbacks shall lie
redeemed upon presentation, but when
once redeemed shall not thereafter bo paid
out except for gold.
The messago discusses the nocd of en

Combinations of capital organized into
trusts to cont rol the conditions of trado
among our citizens, to stille competition,
limit production and determine tho prices
of products used and consumed by tho
people, are justly provoking public dis
cussion, and should early claim tho atten
tion of the congress.
Tho industrial commission, created by
tho not of tho congress of June IS, IK'.W,
has been engaged in extended hearings
upon the rfl.-put.cd questions involved m
subject of combinations in restraint of
trado and competition. They havo not
yet completed their investigation of this
subject, and the conclusions and recom
mendations at which they niuy arrive are
undetermined.
Tho subject Is one giving rise to many
divergent views as to tho naturo and va
riety or cause and extent of the injuries to
the public which may result from largo
combinations concentrating more or less
numerous enterprises und establishments,
which previously to the formation of tho
combination were carriod on separately.
Legislation I'rged Against Trusts.
It is universally conceded that combi
nations which engross or control the mar
ket of any particular kind of merchandise
or commodity necessary to the general
community, by suppressing natural und
ordinary competition, whorchy prices aro
unduly enhanced to tho general con
sumer, uro obnoxious not only tathe com
mon law but also to the public welfare.
There must be a remedy for the evils in
volved in such organizations. If the
present law can bo extended more cer
tainly to control or check these monopo
lies or trusts, it should bo done without
delay. Whatever power the congress pos
sesses over this most important subject
should be promptly ascertained and
asserted.
President Harrison, in his annual mes
sage of December :t. ltwtl, 6ays:
"KurncBt attention should be given by
congress to a consideration of the question
how far the restraint of those combina
tions of capital commonly called 'trusts'
Is matter of federal jurisdiction.' When
organized, ns they often an-, to crush out
all healthy comiH-tilion and to monopo
lize the production or sale of an article of
commerce ami general necessity, they are
dangerous conspiracies against the public
good, nnd should be made tho subject of
prohibitory, and even penal legislation."
An act to protect trade and commerco
against unlawful restraints and monopo
lies was passed by congress on the 2nd of
July, Intnl. The provisions of this statute
are conimprcliensive nnd stringent. It
declares every contract or combine in the
form of a trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in
the restraint of trade or commerce nmong the
several states or with foreign nations to be
unlawful. It denonlnutes as a criminal every
rerson who makes any such contract or en
K&Res In any such combination or conspiracy,
and provides a punishment by flue or impris
onment. It invests the several circuit court!
of the United States with jurisdiction to pre
vent and restrain violations of the act, and
makes it the duty of the several United
httttes district attorneys, under the direction
of the attorney goners!, to Institute proceed
ings in equity to prevent and restrain such
violations. It further confers upon any per
son who shall be injured in his business or
property by any other person or corporation
by reason of anything forbidden or declared
to be unlawful by thu act, tho power to sue
therefor in any circuit- court of the Unitod
btuti-s, without respect to the amount in con
troversy, and to recover threefold the dam
ages by him sustained nnd the costs of the
suit, including reasonable attorney fees, it
Will be perceived that the act is si mod at
every kind of combination In the nature of a
trustor monopoly in restraint of interstate or
international i-onimt-rw,

of December 7, ls. it more than six years sub
sequent to the enactm-iit of this law after
stating the evils of these trust combination,
says:
"Though con'rs4 h:is attempted to deal
with tins matter by legislation, the laws
passid for that purpose thus far have proved
ineffective, not because of any lock of disposi
tion or attt-mtit to enforce them, hut simply
because thu laws themselves, us Interpreted
by the courts, do I ut reach the dimVulty. It
the insullicit-neifs of existing laws can lie
remedied by furth.-r legislation, it should be
done. The fact must bo recognized, however,
that all federal legislation on tills subject may
fall short of its purpose because vf inherent
obstacles and also bef-iuse of the complex
character of our governmental system, which,
while making the federal authority supreme
within its sphere, has cuntully limited that
s: ken- i.;. HM-t. ' a 1 1 b -n.id, which cannot be

nopolies can b a 5c qu itely treated' through
federal action, unlos they seek directly and
purposely to i.'vlcd-! in their objects trans
per tat ion or intercourse between states and
between the United btates and foreign coun
tries. "It docs not follow, however, that this is the
limit of the remedy that may be applied.
Even tlion:.li itmay be found that federal
suth irityis not broad enough to fully reach
tht case t u-ru uan bo no doubt of the power
of lh. s v. -r.it states to act effectively iu the
prtns ' i-td tln-ro should be no reason to

Male Legislation Mostly Failed.
Tim stale legislation to which President
Ulevel.tn l l,) i!;e 1 for relief from the evils of
trusts h is fiihi d to accomplish fully that ob
ject. This is prob ibly duo to a great extent
to the fact that different states take different
views as to 11m proper way to discriminate
between ivd and injudicious combinations
and those us.oriatious which are hencfb'tal
and necessary to tho business prosperity of the
country. The g.-eat diversity of treatment In
different states arising from this cause, and
the intimate relations of ail parts of the
country to each other without regardiug
state lines in the conduct of business, hare
in ailo the enforcement of state laws difficult.
It is apparent that uniformity of legislation
upon this subject in the several states is much
to be desired. It is to be hoped that such uni
formity found in a wise and Just discrimina
tion between what is injurious and what is
useful and necessary in business operations
may be obtained, and that means may be
found for the congress within the limitations
of its constitutional power so to supplement
an effective code of state legislation as to
make n complete system of laws throughout
the Unitod states adequate to compel a gen
eral observance of the salutary rules to which
I have referred.
The whole question is so important and far
reaching that I am sure no part of it will to
lightly considered, but every phase of it will
have the studied deliberation of the congress,
resulting in wisi and judio.ous action.
The message then proceeds to give a review
of our relations with foreign states.
An appropriation for a commission to studr
the commercial anil industrial conditions in
the Chinese empire is earnestly recom
mended. It Is BUggcutcd that congress authorize an
invitation to Germany for the constitution of
a joint commission to conduct a searching in
vestigation of fool production and exporta
tions, with a v evr to the establishment of
regulations which will be satisfactory to both
countries.
The demands for redress made by Italy in
regard to the lynching of Italian subjects at
Tall u hill. La., are discussed, and It is stated
that a satisfactory solution will doubtless be
reached. Legislation conferring jurisdiction
on tho federal courts in criminal eases where
aliens are sufferers is earnestly recom
mended. The New Sainoatl Agreement.
In regard to Samoa the president said we
could not have advised uny proposition that
did not give to us the valuable harbor of Pogo
Pogo. -:- '
Our views commendoi themselvo, to the
other powers. A satisfactory arrangement
was concluded h.-tween the governments of
Germany and of England by virtue of which
England retired from Samoa in view of com
pensation in other directions, and both pow
ers renounced in favor of the United States
all their rights and claims over and in respect
to that portion of the group lying to the east
of the one hundred and seveuty-fUth degree
of west longitude, embracing the islands of
Tutuila, Ofoo, Uloscnga and Manua. I trans
mit to the senate, for its constitutional action
thereon, a convention, which, besides tho pro
visions above mentioned, also guarantees us
the same privileges and conditions in respect
to commerce and commtr-ial vessels in all of
the Islands of Samoa as those possessed by
Oormany.
The contract of the Maritime Canal oom
panyof Nicaragua was declared forfeited by
the Nicaraguan governinenton October lllth
on the gromui of non-fulfUlmcnt within
the ten years term stipulated in tho contract.
The Maritime (.'anal company has lodged a
protest against this action, alleging rights in
the promises which appear worthy of consid
eration. This government expects that Nica
ragua will afford the protestants a full and
fair hearing upoa the merits of the case.
Tho Nicaragua canal commission, which had
been engaged upon tho work of examination
and survey for a ship canal route across Nica
ragua having completed its labors and made
Its report, was dissolved on May til, and on
June 10 a new commission, known as the
Isthmian canal commission, was organized
under thi terms of the act approved March S,
181KI, for the purpose of examining the Ameri
can isthmus with a view to determining the
most practicable and feasible route for a ship
canal across the isthmus with Its probable
cost and other essential details.

The Needs of Cuba.
In regard to l'nb:i he said in part :
Our mission, to accomplish which we took
up the wager of battle, is not to be fill tilled by
turning adrift any loosely framed common
wealth to fa-re the vicissitudes which too
often attend weaker states whose natural
wealth and abundant resources are off set by
the incongruities of their political organiza
tion nnd tho recurring occasions for internal
rivalries to sap their strength and dissipate
their energies. Tlio greatest blessing which
call come to Cuba Is the restoration of her ag
ricultural and industrial prosperity, which
will give employment to idle men and re-establish
tho pursuits of peace. This is her chiuf
and imiiicd'.iitc need.
On the huh of August last an order was
made for the taking of the census In the
island, to 1st completed on the iJOth of Novem
ber. By the treaty of peace the Spanish peo
ple on the island have until April 11, Itmo, to
elect whether they will remain citizens of
(Spain or become citizens of Cuba. Until then
it cannot be definitely ascertained who shall
be entitled to participate in the formation of
the government ol Cuba. By that time tho
results of thu census will have ls-en tubulated,
and we shall proceed to provide for elections
which will commit the municipal govern

the people. The experience thus acquired

Tho system of jurisprudence and municipal
governments in Porto Rico will need little
cuaugo, but legislation is needed with refer
ence to publio administration and the rela

Our plain duty is to abolish all customs tar
Iffs between thu United States and Porto Kioo
nnd give her products free access to our mar
kets. In addition to the private charity of our
people, the war department has expeuded for
the relief of the distressed from the hurricane

The president further said in part:
For present purposes I recommend that con
gress pass n law for the organization of a
temporary government, which shall provide
for the aoDointmeut bv the uresi lent subiect
to confirmation by the senate, of a governor'
and such other ollicers as the general admin
istration of the island may require, and that
ft r legislative purposes upon subjects of a lo
ral nature, not partaking of a federal charac
ter, a legislativa council, composed partly of
Porto Kicons and partly of citixens of the
United Mates, shall lie nominated and ap
pointed by the president, subject to confirma
tion by the senate, their acts to be subject to
the approval of the congress or the president,
prior to going into effect. For thj munici
palities und other local sub-divisions I recom
mend that the principle of local self government-
be nppliod at once, so as to enable the
Intelligent citizens of the island to participate
hi their own government and to learn by pruo
tical ex erience the duties and requirements
of a self-contained and self-governing peo
ple. I have not thought It wise to commit the en
tire government of the island to ollicers se
lected by the people, because I doubt win ther
in habits, training and experience they are
such us to St them to exercise at once so large
a degree of self-government; but it is my
judgment aud expectation that they will soon
arrive at an attainment of experience and
wisdom and self-control that will justify con
ferring upon thein a much larger participa
tion in tho choice of their insular ollicers.
The fundamental requirement for these
peoplo, as for all people, is education. The
free school house is the best preceptor for
citizenship. In the introduction of modern
educational methods care, however, must lie

Armor Plate Kecomniendation.
It cannot be doubted that congress will at
once make uecassary provision for the armor
plate for tht) vessels now under con tract and
building. Its attention is respectfully called
to the report of the secretary of the navy, iu
which the subject is fully presented.
I unite in his recommendation that the con
gress enact such special legislation as may be
necessary to enable the department to make
contracts early in the coming year for armor
of the best quality that can be obtained in the
country for the Maine, Ohio and Missouri, and
that tho provision of the act of March 8, ItstM,
limiting the pi ice of armor to W-JO per ton, be

mends that, i;i order to make the practice at

independent of the proceeds of her daily

The I'hlllppl ten Question.
On the loth of December, lmw, the treaty
of pence Is't ween the I nil t il States and
hpiiiu was signed. It provided, among
other things, tliut Spain should code to
the United States tho archipelago known
ns the Philippine islands, that the United
States should pay lo Spain the sum of
fcJU.t ini.ouu, and that the civil rights und
political slut us of the native inhabitants
of the territories thus ceded to tint United
States should be ilclcrinincd by congress.
The treaty was ratilii d by the senate on
the lith of February, 1, and by the gov
ernment of Spain on the lllth of March
following. Tho rutilications wero ex
cliungcil on the 11th of April, and tho
treaty publicly proclaimed. On tho ;M of
March the congress voted the sum con
templated by the treaty, and tho amount
was pii'd over to the Spanish government
on the 1st of May.
In this manlier the Philippines came
to the United States. Tho islands were
ceded by the government of Spain, which
had Ihs'H ill undisputed possession of
them for centuries. They were accepted
not merely by our authorized commission

executive, but by the constitutional und

The president said in part;

eminently one of peace and friendship."
Hut before their arrival at Manila the
sinister ambition of a few leaders of the
Filipinos h.id created a situation full of
cniliarrassiiiont for us and most grievious
in its consequences to themselves. The
clear und impartial preliminary report of
the commissioners, which I transmit here
with, gives so lucid and comprehensive a
history of the present insurrectionary
movement that the story need not be here
repeated It is enough to say that the
claim of th-; rebel leader that he was prom
ised independence by any olliccr of the
United Stales In returu for Ids osslstcnce
has no foundation in fact and Is categori
cally denied by tho very witnesses who
were culled to prove it. ' Tho most tile in
surgent lculei- honed for when ho came
bai-ii to Manila was tho lils-ration of the
islands from tho Spanish control, which
they had bi-en hibot iug for years without
suovoss to throw off.
The prompt accomplishment of this
work by the American uriny and navy
gave him other ideas and ambitions, and
Insidious suggestions from various quar
ters perverted the purposes and intentions
with which he hod taken up arms. No
sooner hud our army captured Manila
than the Filipino forces begun to assume
an attitude of suspicion und hostility
which tne utmost ellorts of our ollicers
and troops were unable to disarm or mod
ify. Their kindness und forbearance were
taken as a proof of cowardice. Tho aggres
sions of the Filipinos continually in
creased until iluuliy, just before the time
sot by the sen ite ot tho United States for
a vole upon t..e treaty, an attack, evi
dently pieuired In advance, was niailc ull
along ti.o American lines, which resulted
in a terribly destructive and sanguinary
repul.-e of tho insurgents.
Then follows un account of the proposed
mnssac.o by tlio rebels iu Manila, which
was prevented by our troops, the justid
cutiou of our cause by tho Philippines
commission, praise for tho volunteers who
stayed Im-joihI the time of their enlist
incut, relet ring to the local government
in the island ot Negros, which, the presi
dent says, is not permanent, ns it is within
the jurisdiction oi congress to arrange the
form of govt rument. The government
actually set up by the Inhabitants of No
gros eventually proved unsatisfactory to
the names tiiemsclves. A new system
was put into fori eo by order of the major
general commandiiig the department, of
which the following are tho most Import
ant elements:
overumeut of Negro.
It was ordered that the government of
the island of N'egros should consist of a
military governor, appointed by the United
States military governor of the Philip
pines, and n civil governor and an ad
visory council, elected by the people. Tlio
military governor was nut horized to ap
point secretaries of the trensury, interior,
agriculture, public Instruction, an attor
ney general nnd an auditor. The seat of
government was ll.ved us liucolod. Tho
military governor exercises the supremo
executive power, llu is to see that the
laws are executed, appoint to ol'uce and
1111 all vacancies In olllce not otherwise
provided for, and may, with tlio approval
of the mllitury governor of the Philip
pines, remove uny officer from ollice. Tlio
civil governor advises the military gov
ernor on all public civil quest ions ami
Iiresides over the advisory council. He,
n general, performs tho duties which uro
performed by secretaries of state in our
own system of government.
The Advisory council consists of eight
members elected by the people within ter
ritorial limits which are del! nod In the
order of the commanding generul.
The times and place of holding elec
tions uro to lis fixed by the military gov
ernor of the Island of Negros. The quail
llcatlons of voters are as follows:
(1) A voter must lie a mule citizen of
the island of Negros.
(u'l Of the uge of 111 years.
(3) lie shall Ih able to speak, read and
write the Kuglish, Spanish or Vizayan
language, or he must own real property
worlii.ou, or nuy a rental on reul prop
erty of the value of l,ouo.
(4) llo must huve resided in the island
not less than one year preceding, and In
the district in which he offers to register
as a voter, not less than tlin-e months im
mediately preceding the time he offers to
register.
(.") He must register at a time fixed by
law before voting.
(ti) Prior to Mich regisi rut ion he shall
have paid nil taxes due by him tot lot
government. Provided, that no insane
IM-rsoii sliull be allowed to register or vote.
The i ii 1 1 1 : t i-y governor has the right to
veto all biii, or resolutions adopted by the
advisory council, nnd his veto Is llnl if
not disapproved by the military governor
of tho Philippines.
The advisory council discharges all tho
ordinary duties of a legislature. The us
ual duties Heaiiiiug lo said offices ore to
1h; performed by the secretaries of the
treasury, interior, agriculture, public in
struction, the attorney generul nnd the
auditor.
Tho judicial power is vested in three
judges, who are to Is appointed by the
military governor of the island. Inferior
courts an- to 1st established.
Frtv public soinHtls ure to lie establlsln-d
throughout the populous districts of the
island, in which tiie F.nglish langiiuge
shall Is taught, ami this subject will re
ceive the cu.cf til consideration of the ad
visory council.
The bunion of government must 1
distributed equally and equitably among
the people. The military authorities will
collect and receive the customs revenue,
and will control postal matters and Phil
ippine inter island trade and commerce.
The military governor, subject to the
approval of the military governor of t he
Philippines, ilclcriiiincs all questions not
BMs-ilii ally provided for and which do not
come under the jurisdiction of the advis
ory council.

iiivo directed shall lie vommiinicatvd to
the sultan of Jolo. that this agreement Is
not to Is deemed in any wnv to authorize
or give the consent of tiie United States to
the existence of slavery in the Sulu archi
pelago. I communicate theso facts to the
congress for Its information and action.
Kverything indicates that with tho
speedy suppression of the Tagulo relielllou
life In the archipelago will soon resume its
ordinary course under the protection of
our sovereignty, nnd the people of thoso
favored islands will enjov a prosperity
nnd a freedom which t hev' have never bo
fore known. A lreadv hundreds of schools
are open and filled with children. Ke
ligious freedom is sacredly ai-stm-d nnd
enjoyed. Tho courts are dispensing jus
tice. Ilusiness is beginning to circulate
in its accustomed channe's. Manila,
whoso Inhabitants wero tli-eing to the
country a few months ago, is now a popu
lous and thriving mart of commerce. The
earnest and unremitting endeavors of the
commission and the ndmiral and major
general commanding the department of
ihe Pacific to assure the people of tho
iH-nehccnt intentions of this government
have had their legitimate effect in con
vincing the great mass of them that peocn
and prosMTity nnd stable government can
only lie found in a loyal aecentance of the
authority of the United States.
Congress to iHtclde II.
The future government of the Philip
pines rests with the congress of the United
States. Few of the graver responsibili
ties have ever been conllded to us. If we
accept them in a spirit worthy of our
race und our traditions, a great opportu
nity conies with them. The islands lie
under the shelter of our Hag. They are
ours by every title of law and equby.
They can not Is; aliaudoncd. If we de
sort them we leave them at once to an
archy jmd finally to barbarism. We lling
them, a golden apple of discord, among
the rival powers, no one of which could
permit another to seize them unquiB
tioned. Their rich plains and valleys would bn
the seem s of endless strife and bloodshed.
1 he advent of Dewey's fleet in Manila Ituy
instead of being as wo hope the dawn of a
new day of freedom nnd pro -rcss will have
been the hcginnlngof an era of misery and
violence worse th in any whicli has dark
ened tlielr unhappy past. The suggestion
has been mivle that we could reiiouuceour
authority over the islands and, giving
them independence, could retain a protec
torate over them. This proposition will
not be found. I am sure, v rthv of your
serious attention. Suoh i arrangement
would involve at the outs . a cruel breech,
of faith. It would place the iietioeaUe
und loyal majority, who ask nothing
better than to a-eept our authority at t' 1
mercy of the minority of armed insurgent
It would make ns responsible for tho acta .
the insurgent leaders and give us no iswor '
control them. It would charge us with th
task of protecting them against each other
and defending them against any foreign
power with which they chose to quarrel. Ia
short, it would take from the congress of the
United States the power of declaring war.
and vest that tremendous prerogative in the
Tagal leader of tho hour.
Await Itestoratlon ot Peace.
It does not seem desirable that I should
recommend at this time a specific and final
form of government for these Islands. When
peace shall be restored It will b.) the duty of
congress ts construct a plan of government
which shall establish and maintain freedom
and order and peace in the Philippines. Tim
insurrection is still existing, and when it
terminates further information will lie re
quired as to the actual condition of affairs be
fore Inaugurating a permanent scheme of
civil government. The full rejiort of the com
mission, now in preparation, will contain in
formation and suggestions which will be of
value to congress, and which I will transmit
as soon as It is completed. As long as the in
surrection continues the militurr army must
necessarily be supreme. Yet there is no rea
son why steps should not be taken from time
to time to inaugurate governments essentially
popular In their form as fast as territory is
held and controlled by our troops. To this
end I sin considering the advisability of the
return of the commission, or such of the mem
bers thereof as can be secunsi, to aid tlio
existing authorities and facilitate this
work throughout tiie islands. 1 have be
lievod that reconstruction should not be
gin by the establishment of one central civil
government for all island, with Its seat at
Manilla, but rather that the work should be
commence d by building up from the bottom,
lirst establishing municipal governments and
then provincial governments, a central gov
ernment nt last to follow.
Until congress shall have made known the
formal expression of Its will, 1 shall u,. the
authintv vested in me by the consi tuition
and the statutes to uphold tne sovereignly of
the L'nitisl istales in thos- distant islands as
in all other places where our tlug rightfully
lioats.
We shall continue as we have begun to open
the schools and the churches, to sot the eourta
in operation, to foster industry and trade aud
agriculture, and in every way in our power to
make theso M-ople whom providence has
brought within our Jurisdiction feel that it is
their lllx-rty and not our power, their wel
fare and not our gain, we are eking to en
hance. The Civil Nervlce,
In regard to the amendments to the civil
service order of M ly it, IM), promulgated May
2V. Isy.l, the president nai l In part :
All of the amendments had for their main
object a more cfllei.-nt and satisfactory ad
ministration of the system of appointments
established by tho civil service law. Tho re
sults atiaiued show that under their oera
tion the public service has Improved and that
the civil service system Is relieved of many
objectionable features which heretofore sub
jected it to just criticism and administrative
ofliccrs to the charge of un businesslike meth
ods in the conduct of public affairs.
It is behoved that tho merit system lias
been greatly strengthened and Its p-rnia-m-nce
assured. It will be my constant aim
in the administration of government in our
now possessions to make fitness, rharacter
and merit s.-ential to appointment to ortb-e,
nnd to give to the callable an i deserving in
