MIIU MORNING. IW'EIBEK 11. 1906.
Thoughts oil the President s'Message
President Roosevelt, in his late mes
sage to Congress, while advocating
-■. no measures that art-commendable,
launches forth with his usual impet
uosity in defense of the absurd claim
of Japan to etjual rights in the com
mon schools of San Francisco. The
w, r-t of it i- that his precipitancy has
evidently produced the impres-ion on
the volatile nature of the little brown
man that threats of retaliation have
been effective and that our people are
on the point of conceding all tliey de
mand, and still more if need lie. That
is the trouble in dealing with a nation
of idolators. They have ano higher
conception of justice and fair-dealing
than cau he hacked up by brute force.
After as-erting that nil nations stand
upon an equality, the President says:
■ I am prompted to say this by the at
titude of hostility here anil there as
su.ncd toward the Japanese in this coun
try. This hostility is sporadic, anil is
limited to a very few places. Neverthe
less it is most discreditable to us as a
people, and it may be fraught with the
gravest consequences to the nation.''
Mr. Roosevelt then alluded to the
" friendship" that has existed between
out country and Japan the past half a
century, during which time the latter
nation has surged so rapidly to the
front, that she now stands " one of the
greatest of civilized nations." The
primary signification of the word " civ
ilized" as used in this connection, is
" reclaimed from savage life," but
when we consider that the nation still
clings to Buddhism, as the great re
ligion of the empire, shown by nearly
300,000 Buddhist temples amid her
population of 40,000,000, and the abil
ity of her people to live upon food that
has enabled Japs to toil at cutting
wood in this county, from ten to
twelve hours a day, at a cost of ninety
cents, it does not seem tbat they have
progressed very far from barbarism.
The main question tbat will be asked
by the average laborer is," What pos
sible benefit can be derived from a cit
izenship like tbat?"
Mr. Roosevelt declares "to shut
them (the Japanese) ont of the public
schools is a wicked absurdity," when
tbe fact is that they never have been,
nor are they now, barred from the
educational system iu California; but
simply a rule is enforced requiring
them to attend a separate school pro
vided for them. So it will be seen
that all this flurry has been created
simply from a disposition to be quer
ulous and dictatorial—probably for
advancement of some other and en
tirely different project.
If it be true, as alleged by tbe Presi.
dent, that" very few of our citizens act
badly" in this matter, will be explain,
wby it is that the whole Pacifio coast
stands as one man on this question?
May it not be that they have had su
perior advantages for arriving at a
correct opinion on the matter? May
not association with the hordes of Ja
panese and Chinese who have flocked
to our shores, shown their utter worth
lessness and depravity as individuals,
aside from traits ingrained by centur
ies of adverse custom, that wholly in
capacitate tbem from developing the
cardinal traits of good citizenship? Is
Mr. Roosevelt, or is any other man
who has not studied these race pe
culiarities, a competent critic of this
cosmopolitan people who have extend
ed the true, patriotic American spirit
to tbe western coast? Nay, verily I
Now here is Mr. Roosevelt's plan
for relief:
" I recommend to the Congress that
an act be passed specifically providing
for the naturalization of Japanese who
come here intending to become Ameri
can citizens."
He closes his reference to this mat
ter with this flourish of his "big
stick":
" Even as the law now is, something
can be done by the Federal government
toward this end, and in the matter now
before me affecting the Japanese, every
thing that it is in my power to do will
be done, and all of the forces, military
and civil, of the United States which I
may lawfully employ will be so em
ployed."
Well, it will probably be long after
Teddy is dead and buried, politically
before idolatry will be introduced or,
tolerated under American citizenebip.
With regard to an income tax the
President says:
There is no more legitimate tax for
any State than a tax on tbe franchises
conferred by that State upon street
railroads and similar corporations
which operate wholly within tbe
State boundaries, sometimes in one
and sometimes in several municipali
ties or other minor divisions of the
State. But there are many kinds of
taxes which can only be levied by the
General Government so as to produce
the best results, because among other
reasons, tbe attempt to impose them
in one particular State too often re
sults merely in driving tbe corpora
tion or individual affected to some
other locality or other State. The
National Government has long de
rived its chiof revenue from a tariff
on imports and from an internal and
excise tax. In addition to these there
is every reason why, when next our
system of taxation is revised, the
National Government should impose a
graduated inheritance tax, and, if pos
sible, a graduated income tax.
Tbe man of great wealth owes a
peculiar obligation to tbe State, be
cause he derives special advantages
from tbe mere existence of the gov
ernment. Not only should he recog
nize this obligation in the way he
leads his daily life and in tbe way he
earns and spends his money, but it
should also be recognized by the way
in which he pays for tbe protection
the State gives him.
The remainder of the message is cov
ered by the following reference to its
chief topics. Tbe document is alto
gether too long for the general read
er, filling thirteen long columns of tbe
finest print in the big Eastern dailies.
The President suggests:
That political contributions by cor
porations be forbidden.
That th" government be given the
rigut of appeal on po.nt.- < f law in
criminal ca-es, in order that there may
lie a real settlement oi the question
involved and that the scandal of one
Federal judge's declaring acts not
criminal while another sends men to
jail for the same kind of act may be
ended.
That the setting aside of verdicts be
prohibited where the errors alleged are
merely technical and it is not shown—
and often not even contended—that
any injustice has been done.
That measures he tako n to remedy
some acknowledged abuses of the writ
of injunction, but without curtailing
its proper u«« or conferring upon any
group of citizens practical exemption
from legal processes which all others
must obey.
Tbat the crime agaiu-t woman hood,
always alleged as the justification of
lynch law—although two-thirds of the
lyncliings have not that excuse—be
invaribly punished by death, and that
trials of such cases be conducted with
regard to the feelings of the victim
and be without d-dny.
That ttic bonis of labor of railway
employes be limited, in the interest of
the public safety us well as of the wel
fare of the men, and that the eight
hour day be established wherever prac
ticable, tint without attempting to ap
ply to other lauds and races—as at
Panama—rules for which they are un
fitted.
That a drastio child-labor law be en
acted for the District of Columbia.
That the employers' liability act
passed at the last session, be strength
ened by putting upon the employer,
and through him upon tho consumers,
the entire burden of the" risk of a
trade" —the natural hazards attending
given occupations.
That machinery be provided for
the compulsory investigation of such
industrial disputes as the anthracite
strike, with a view to bringing the
parties together and compelling them,
if necessary, to consider the public
welfare as well as their own separate
and special interests.
That the executive order withdraw
ing coal lands from settlement be
followed by positive legislation with a
view to preserving coal deposits as
national property, to be worked under
royalty but not to pass into private
ownership, and that further measures
be taken for the preservation of forests.
That all meat products bear dated
labels, and that the cost of meat in
spection be borne by the packers
instead of by the public treasury.
That the best way to avert agitation
for government ownership of railways
is to secure to the government and
people legal power to prevent and
punish abuses by proper control of
railway management. In this connec
tion new legislation does not seem to
be urged, but rather that the executive
be euatained by Congress in enforcing
the recent legislation.
That since it ie impossible to con
duct the business of the country with
out violating the anti-trust law, as
construed by the courts, that law
should be thoroughly revised and,
instead of attempting to prohibit all
combinations, should sharply disting
uish between combinations which do
evil aDd those which are harmless or
do good.
A constitutional amendment for
national control of marriage and
divorce as the only way to stop the
scandals resulting from diversity of
local laws and also to give Congress
power to deal directly with polygamy.
The passage of the pending bill for
the encouragement of tbe mercantile
marine as probably as free from ob
jections as any that could be devised,
or at least measures for better com
munication with South America.
That inheritance and income taxes
be made a regular part of the national
system of taxation, with a constitu
tional amendment, if necessary, to
secure an income tax.
That measures be taken to make
the currency more elastic, with a view
to preventing those violent fluctua
tions of money supply and interest
rates which now recur annually. No
definite plan is urged, but the " asset
currency" idea for "emergency money"
is mentioned with some favor.
That a lower tariff or free trade be
granted the Philippines, not so much
because it will greatly benefit their
people in material ways at present as
because it will show them that we wish
to do all we can for their welfare, and
will injure no American industry.
Full citizenship for the Porto Rie
ans; a complete reorganization of the
government of Alaska; concentration
of tbe direction of tbe affairs of all our
island possessions in one department,
preferably that of State or War.
The Cuban insurrection and the
measures taken to end it are merely
reviewed on the assumption that the
present American control is strictly
provisional and will end as soon as
the Cubans set up another government.
ONE of the first bills that passed the
lower branch of Congress, by practi
cally an unanimous vote, was for
limiting tbe regulation of interstate
commerce between tbe States and
prohibiting the shipment of goods
manufactured by convict labor into
any State for competition with those
made by free labor. Mr. Hunt, of
Missouri, introduced tbe bill and
asked for its passage, not only in tbe
interest of honest labor but that of
the manufacturer as well, who has
hitherto been compelled to compete
with convict labor.
NON-UNION men at San Pedro, Cal.,
have organized iu opposition to the
union, and refuse to unload vessels
manned by union crews. Tbe steam
ship Meteor from Puget Sound, is de
tained on that account, and other
ships are delayed, being compelled to
use their crews as stevedores. As
practically a third of tbe lumber sent
to California passes through San
Pedro, the condition with lumber on
the top shelf regarding price, this
action aggravates the hardships of
both shippers and builders.
TRAGIC END OF AN EX-SENATOR
Former U. S. Senator Arthur Brown,
of Utah, was shot in his apartments in
a Washington, I). C., hotel, Saturday
morning, by a Mrs. Anna M. Bradley,
of Salt Lake, from the effects of which
he died about midnight Wednesday.
It seems tbat ths woman demanded
marriage of tbe ex-Senator as a means
of righting a wrong done her so far as
it was in his power.
THE vote of the State against a
proposed amendment to Art. XXI. of
the State Constitution was defeated,
the vote standing 18,422 yeas, to 20,-
258 nays—a majority against of 1,796.
The amendment to Art. 1 was de
feated by a vote of 15,257 yeas and
20,984 against, tbe majority being
5,727.
THE schooner Bangor, lately wrecked
in Willapa harbor, has been tsken to
Hoquiarn and dismantled, preparatory
to rebuilding. It will be several
weeks before she is afloat again.
Are We Verging On Despotism?
Hardly anybody will bo surprised,
under the very strenuous national Ad
ministration tbat Secretary of State
Root should, in a public address an
nounce the no less startling, though
let us hope untrue statement, that
State lines under our form of govern
ment are steadily vanishing and the
trend of popular sentiment is towards
centralization of power under the
l'resident. The only evidence of this
we can see is in the wayward nature of
the Chief Executive, which is occas
ionally manifested in official conduct,
that has been tolerated by the people
simply through the confidence of sin
cerity implied by bold departures from
party creed and party leaders' control.
Rut as Mr. Roosevelt himself asserts
t tie plain belief, by flourishing his big
club over the heads of our own citi
zens, it may be well to pause and con
sider how far such a political heresay
may be proclaimed without protest
from a free people. It has always
been understood that the club was
intended for outside barbarians; if,
however, it is the badge of authority
over our own people, it may be well to
ascertain just how far the Civil war
has supplanted those rights reserved to
the Slates on entering the compact
of Union. It certainly did not imply
absolute, dictatorial and autocratic
authority by the general government.
If so, what belter would it be than the
limited monarchies of the Old World;
or with a strenuous self opinionated
Chief Executive at its head, even the
absolute despotisms?
THE PRIMARY DUTY OF A TAX COM
MISSION.—Tbe State Tax Commission
have manifested considerable zeal in
getting property which has heretofore
escaped taxation placed upon tbe tax
rolls, as well as being profuse in formu
lating expedients which will be pre
sented to the Legislature with the end
in view of collecting more revenue. If
this exhibition of zeal shall result in
lower tax levies, our citizens, outside of
the tax-eating class, will say, "Well
and good." This body does not, how
ever, manifest any great ambition
towards suggesting methods looking
in the direction of reducing public
burdens, such as eliminating useless
officials who must be paid by the
general tax paying class that do not
draw down the coin from the official
pie-counter. They doubtless imagine
that our people will pocket the griev
ance imposed and say nothing. There
is, however, one matter about which
there were complaints entered at the
time in some localities, when this
Commission, at the first sitting of the
State Board of Equalization, exerted
itself towards the lessening of rail
road trackage valuations. Now cer
tain daily newspapers come forward
with the remarkable assertion that the
terminal facilities of railroads in this
State, represent a greater value than
the trackage. Can you not tee the
colored gentleman in the wood-pile?
LUCKY THEODORE! HOW MANY
GOOD THINGS COME HIS WAY!— It is
being planned that President Roose
velt shall be visited, early next spring,
by the " Beauty • Show," which Ore
gon will send to the Jamestown Ex
position, consisting of 33 of the hand
somest women in that State, one from
each county. Senator Fulton, lately
notified the President of the rare treat
in store for bim, and he declared that
it would afford him much pleasure to
meet the young ladies. The Senator
is evidently a DuMaurier in his esti
mate of the fair sex, using the Tril
bian simile of the great author. He
said, "Tbe Oregon apples are the
largest and finest in the world; but
the « peaches' we grow out there are
just the sweetest to be found any
where."
TREND OF EVENTS STEADILY IN THE
SAME DIRECTION.—A Honolulu dis
patch of the 12th iost., states that two
regiments of Jap soldiers are in that
city completely officered, and disguised
as laborers. A St. Petersburg dispatch
of the same date, suggests a reproach
merit, between that government and
the United States to safeguard peace
in the far East. That such an agree
ment exists between England and
Japan will somewhat lessen American
autipatby to a similar " entangling al
liance." When the proper time comes,
Uncle Sam will make another " ex
ample" of Japan, tbe same way he
did of Bpain. It seems almost im
possible to get on with tbe swell-head
Japs except to give them a dose of the
same medicine.
A SUGGESTION FOR THE TAX COM
MISSION.-—Poor persons, widows and
orphans, are required to pay their full
taxes, while the rich, in many cases,
escape paying their just share of the
public burdens. The inheritance tax
law is supposed to operate equally, but
instances are noted wherein wealthy
individuals, who feel that their earthly
career is nearing an end, have their
estate incorporated, to escape pay
ment. It would seem our strenuous
Tax Commission might devise some
plan to correct such palpable injustice.
It is not right that a legatee receiving
1100 should pay a tax of $6, while a
wealthy estate, being incorporated,
pays nothing.
TOLERATION WILL BE REGARDED AS
INTIMIDATION.— Japanese is rushing
thousands of experienced army men
into tbe Sandwich Islands, which is
another straw showing the direction of
the wind. Our people should realize
at the outset that any concessions to
this nation by idolators will be only
fuel to the flames lighted by their un
expected victory over the bygone Cos
sack soldiery whose equipage and ac
coutrements weigh from 50 to 60
pounds. Tbey are afflicted with a
most violent form of swell-head and
the "diplomacy" of the rdministration
will be regarded as cowardice and only
aggravate the disposition for conquest.
DIRECTOR-GENERAL Nadeau has di
rected Senator Piles to ask Congress

ROUGH lumber now commands

Shipwrecks ami Disasters at Sea.
The bark Agate was towed into As
toria water-logged, with ten feet of
water in her hold, Wednesday. She
had left tho Columbia, on the Ist, for
San Francisco, with a cargo of lumber.
The British ship Metarope, aban
doned at sea off the Columbia bar,
last Friday, was picked up Wednesday
by the steam schooner Northland, and
towed in over the bar. The crew had
been rescued some time previously by
tbo schooner W. R. Smith.
The barkentine Amelia, en route
from San Francisco to Astoria, was in
the storm of last week, driven to sea,
every yard of sail going by the board.
She drifted northward and managed
to make Clallam Bay, before the storm
of Monday night, and a tug brought
her to Port Townsend. She had been
27 days out on a trip that usually
consumes but five.
The schooner Forest Home saved
the crew of the bark Sea Wilch, lost
off Capo Flattery, in last week's storm,
Friday evening.
ANOTHER OBJECT-LESSON. —It takes
the hard knocks some of our American
heiresses are receiving to show the ab
surdity of trading wealth for worthless
titlos from the effete nobility of the
Old World. Anna Gould's experionce
alone should bo a sufficient warning of
the danger of such misalliances, but
there are dozens of other instances
fraught with just such humiliating
treatment of brides that have been
married solely as a business specula
tion—for their money. Another of
these is the lately announced determi
nation of the Duchess of Marlborough
to separate from the ill-natured snob
she wedded some years ago. Under
the stipulations for a separation the
Duke, it is said, takes good care to
feather his nest by an annual plucking
of SIOO,OOO to be settled on him for lifo
as a condition of release, and consent
that their two children, aged nine and
eight years, bo awarded the mother.
The Duchess ( nee Miss Vanderbilt) will
probably return to this country.
A WOMAN TO INVKSTIOATE WOMAN
AND CHILD LAUOlL —President Iloose
veil has directed the Department of
Justice at Washington to detail Mrs.
J. Eilen Foster to investigate the con
ditions that surround laboring women
and ci>i.d*vorkers throughout this
country, as a means of enlightenment
for legislation by Congress. Last year
ihis lady accompanied the Taft party
to the Philippines and made a special
report to the President on the condi
tion of women and children there.
She returned from a trip around the
world, a few months ago, during which
she made a study of the environments
of women in China and India. This
experience and close observation it is
thought has peculiarly fitted her for
suggestion, regarding the ills that sur
round the working classes of her sex
in this oountry, and means of amelior
tion.
STATE REFORMATORY. —Gov. Mead
will probably recommend legislative
action for the establishment of a
State Reformatory, similar to that of
New York at Ehuira, where first offend
ers, between the ages of 16 and 30,
may be imprisoned, with the view of
reclaiming them from their evil ways.
This can be done at moderate expense
by employing the State convicts in
construction of the necessary buildings
on a tract of land presumably near the
Penitentiary, large enough for tillage
by the inmates in aid of their own
support. There are now 900 idle
prisoners that might be employed, em
bracing many skilled workmen in
many branohes that may be success
fully employed on the work.
A WONDERFUL SHOWINO FOR OUR
STATE. —Tax Commissioner Easterday
has figured out the per capita of our
State—including men, women and
children—at $162.50, whereas the gen
eral average of wealth and population
throughout the United States is $34.
Ours is said to be the highest in the
world. This is supposed to be largely
due from the large amount of money
pouring in from the Alaskan mines,
and railroad development for which
much outside capital is attracted to
this Slate.
IN compliance with the request of
many patients in Seattle, who exper
ienced relief from the ministrations of
Mrs. Emilie Kohlman, in nervous and
intestinal diseases, she has cut short
her stay at Tacoma, where she had de
veloped a splendid praotice, and has
returned to the former city. She is
the lady who performed such wonders
here in relief of stomach complications
and the removal of tumors, about a
year ago. Her address in Seattle is
1031 Washington street and Eleventh
Avenue.
ALEXANDER DOWIE, the modern Eli

a new stronghold, into which no un
worthy member will be permitted to
come. The old city will be left to its
creditors, and the new one to be found
ed will be conducted along socialistic
lines, with autocratic spiritual control,
and Volivafor its head.
CAPT. Hans Hingard of the Bering
Sea-going service, lately " swore off"
drinking, in Seattle, and either from
the want of his accustomed stimulant*,
or a conviction that he had come to
the jumping-off place, yielded up bis
life, Wednesday night, at his lodging
bouse; it is supposed, however, invol
untarily. Here is a nut for the Prohis
to crack. What is to be done when a
man is dying from the want of whisky?
A RECOGNITION OK WELL-EARNED
MERlT. —Jessie Shirley has contracted
for another year of dramatic perform
ances at the Auditorium—the leading
theater of Spokane—where she has
had a continuous engagement for sev
eral years. She is worthy of this dis
tinction, as she is one of the most ver
satile and talented actresses of the
present day.
A CONTRACT has been entered ioto
by the Canadian Pacific Pailroad and
the Vancouver Development Co. to
cjear 150,000 acres of land along the

which at the contract price of SIOO
per aore represents an expenditure of
$15,000,000.
THE value of Peary's bottle, left to

MILLIONS of people in China are
facing a famine. It has reached al
most to starvation stage in Central
China.
KGO.-KVELI'S STARTING-POlNT. —Quite
a tempest lias bten created over Mr.
Roosevelt's connection with the at
tempt to advance Archbishop Ireland
to the position of Cardinal. Mrs.
Storer, wife of the American Ambassa
dor to Austria-Hungary, declares that
Mr. Roosevelt before election worked
hard for that object but after election
was so afraid people would find it out
that he has denied the part he played
and turned against his oldest and best
friends. She then claims (list she and
her husband created Roosevelt by in
ducing President McKiuley to start
him on bis line of progress by appoint
ment to the vantage-point of Assistant
Secretary of the Navy. This was
asked by them as a great personal
favor and was granted as such, Mr.
MclCinley knowing the intimate social
relations between the two families,
granted it as a favor to them. That is
at least what they claim.
NOBLE WORK AS A RESCUER. —The
bark Coloma was wreeked off the coast
of Vancouver Island on the Gth iust.,
and the crew was saved by heroic ac
tion of Mrs. Thomas Patterson, wife of
the light-house teuder at Cape Beal,
who walked during a gale over a
rugged trail and through bogs knee
deep, five miles, to carry the news of
the ship's dangerous situation to the
Canadian surveying steamer Quadra,
which went at once to the rescue and
arrived just in time. This same lady,
when the Valencia was on the rocks,
wired the news to Victoria, and it was
through her efforts that boats were
dispatched to the wreck. A fund has
been raised in Seattle for a testimonial
of Borne sort to the intrepid woman.
FEWER " PLUMS" AND BETTER FRUIT.
—lt is said that a conference has been
held between leading hold-over Sena
tors, appointed at the last session of
that body two years ago, and the deci
sion reached to recommend that the
number of employes of that body, in
all capacities, be reduced from 57 to
30, and that efficiency be made the
basis of selection. The scandal that
attached to the many sinecure posi
tions farmed out in both bodies of the
last Legislature, will, if this be true,
not bo repeated.
A MEETING of the Shingle Mills
Bureau is to be held in Seattle to
morrow, to decide the matter for a
closure of several months, which ac
tion is rendered necessary by car
shortage. It is claimed that the
railroads are six months behind the
supply now on hand, and it is hinted
that the refusal of cars is a retaliation
for the attempt to regulate a fair and
equable service by law. Submit to
unreasonable exactions or suffer stag
nation of trade, seems to be their plan
for conquest.
ATE HIS MOCCASINS. —Very little
but the bright side has been given of
Peary's Arctio expedition on the steam
er Itoosevelt, whereby he was able to
penetrate a degree of latitude within
200 miles of the pole. Charles Clarke
whose party was rescued by Peary at
the very doorway of death, from star
vation and exposure, declares that his
party had not only eaten the harness
straps of their dog-team, when found,
but that he himself had devoured hie
moccasins!
UNSURPASSED IN HER SPECIALTY.—
Rose Melville, who created the charac
ter of " Siss Hopkins," completed a
season in Spokane, Sunday night. It
seems that her delineation of the " Po
sey county girl" never tires her audi
ences, and it has had a longer run
than any other modern comedy. But
it is her very own specialty. Other
quite as talented actresses might take
the part and score a failure.
WILL HAVE TO UNDERGO TRIAL.—
The U. S. Supreme Court, on the 3d
inst., denied the habea* corpus of
Morgan, Haywood and Pettibone,
representatives of the Western Feder
atin of Mines, imprisoned in Idaho,
on the charge of complicity in as
sassination of ex-Governor Stunenberg.
The opinion was rendered by Justice
Harlan, and its effect will be to hold
the men for trial in Idaho.
THAT Senator Ankeny is trying to
find an easy place to fall upon from
the lofty political pinnacle attained by
gall and gold, is presumable from the
announcement that he has lately ob
tained five mining claims of note in
the Marshall Lake district, which run
high as S3OO per ton in free milling
ore. He will, it it said, proceed at
once to farther develop Gold Dollar
and Gannon Ball groups.
THE Mission Promotion Society of
San Francisco has asked the Presi
dent, his cabioet and Congress, to
remit the duty on all building mater
ial used to rebuild the city, for the
next five yeare. It is to relieve them
from the grip of speculators who have
formed a combine to squeeze the life
blood out of those who would restore
the city to something like its former
grandeur.
MRS. William Goodman was burned
to death while attempting the rescue
of her four-months-old son from her
burning home, at Hillmau City, at an
early hour, Monday morning. When
the fire died out her charred remains
were found. The baby had been res
cued without her knowledge, it seems,
but had been so injured by the flames
that it died the afternoon of the same
day.
CHESTER E. Gillette, of Herkimer,
N. Y., has been found guilty of murder
in the first degree, by drowning his
sweetheart, Grace Brown, in Moose
Lake, same State, last July. He was
a schoolboy in Spokane, a few years
ago. Notwithstanding the utmost pre
