.{ \v THE VALUE OF SEED CORN.
I" Iowa's corn crop for 1905'is reported
'py the state crop bureau as 346,000,
jb00
bushels. The total value of the
"crop is something more than $3,000,
0b0. The corn crop this year is 816,
500 bushels greater than that for any
ar previous.
While the present year has been a
bod one for all crops, some of the
¥'vedit must go to Prof. P. G. Holden
A his seed corn doctrine, for the
'^vjilendid yield of corn. Mr. Holden
Mvent through the state on practically
[Hver line of railroad, preaching fo the
formers his gospel of tested seed corn.
All over the state tillers of the soil
made their testing boxes and tested
their seed corn, using this corn to
raise their crops and growing a small
patch especially for seed corn for
next year.
The farmers of Iowa can testify to
the value of the seed corn doctrine.
They will not soon forget it nor will
they soon forget! Prof. Holden. Next
year will do for those who didn't start'

PULPIT SENSATIONALISM.

Evangelists, more than any others,
overstep the bounds of pulpit sensa

extenuating circumstance to explain
their actions or t#'justify them. The

that of William A( Sunday, whose ser

IOWA'S VETERANS.'
Hanipton Recorder.—Brother Brandt
In the Iowa, City Republican, makes
an astonishing blunder when he says
that, "it is twenty-two years since the
state of Iowa elected a veteran for
governor and that during the last forty
years the governorship has been held
but nine years by a soldier." Since
1864 the following soldiers have held
the office of governor: WUlianj, M.
Stone, four vears Samuel Merrill,
four years C. C. Carpenter, four
years Joshua G. Newhold, two years
Buren R. Sherman, four years Fran
cis M, Drake, two years. Total twenty
years out of forty-one. And Governor
Drake was elected in 1896, only nine
years ago.
Mr. Brandt Is just as far outsid'e of
the mark when he says that he does
not recollect of but one soldier in the
list of the present appointees under
the state administration. We will not
go over the entire li. t, but remember
the following veterans, appointees of
Governor Cummins or now holding
under previous appointments: Wil
liam H. Thrift, adjutant general: Geo
A. Lincoln, fish commissioner: T. E
McCurdy. state custodian: G. S. Rob
inson. member board of control, and
H. M. Plckell, oil inspector. So far
as the past is concerned, the republi
can party of Iowa has been more than
generous, In favoring the veterans in
the matter of official appointments.
Of the lieutenant governors, elglit
at least have been old veterans, In
cluding the present Incumbent: four
secretaries of state, at least four audi
tors, six state treasurers, two state su
perintendents, four registers of state
land office (office abolished In 1882)
and nine railroad commissioners since
the office was created in 1878. Since
the war seven soldiers have served as
supreme court Judgej of the state,
three as clerks of the same court and
four as attorneys general. Iowa has
sent at least thirty-one veterans to
congress since the war, and take it all
in all, we ti.lnk that the veterans of
our ,.state have no cause of complaint
against the republican party of Iowa.
