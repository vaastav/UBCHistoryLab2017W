CONGRESSIONAL
COMMITTEE BEGINS
RAILWAY INQUIRY
Proposed by President to Bet
ter Condition of Carriers.
MAY CHANGE PRESENT SYSTEM
Official! of Roads Prepared to Advocate
Federal Incorporation, Supervision of
Securities and Extemlon of Authority
of Interstate Commerce Commission.
Washington, Nov. 20. Ten members
of CoiiRiess, five Senators and lie
members of the House of Iloirecnta
tlves, becan here today an Inquiry Into
the subject of public control and su
nerv lslon of railroads that may lead to
the rcvoltitlontrtni; of the whole scheme
of governmental regulation of thecoun
try's transportation lines. Incidentally
the committee Is to look Into the cities
Hon of government ownership of rail
wajs, telephone and telegraph lines
and express companies
The members of the committee
which will conduct this Important in
vestigation are Senator New lands of
Nevada, chairman. Senotors Robinson
of Arkansas. Underwood of Alabama,
Cummins of Iowa and Hrondegeo of
Connecticut, and Representatives Ad
amson of Georgia. Sims of Tennessee,
Cullop of Indiana, i:eh of Wisconsin
an l Ilnratlton of Michigan The in
quiry was recommended by President
Wilson In his message to Congress In
December of Inst jear He described
as Its purpose to determine w hat could
be done "for bettering the conditions
under which the railroads ure operated
and for maUlng them more useful serv
ants of the country ns a whole "
Prominent Men as Witnesses.
In order to obtain the views of nil
Interests affected by the operations of
the transportation lines the committee
has Invited prominent shippers, bank
ers, representatives of commercial or
ganizations, rnllvv.n executive-', eenno
mists and others to appear before them
The tlrst to be heard are rallroid
commissioners of various states who
began their evidence today Their
testimony Is dlre ted chiefly to oppos
log nny enlargement of the federal
authority over commerce tint would
detract from the powers now exercised
by state bodies They will bo followed
shortly by otliMals of railway labor
organizations who are expected to reg
ister their opposition to the lncreise
of governmental authority over wnges
and conditions of labor
Chief Interest In the hearings cen
tors In the proposals that will be put
forward by representatives of the rail
roads, for It Is reported that they will
advocate an extension of federnl au
thority over rates and setuiltles to the
practical exclusion of state control of
these mntters It Is understood niso that
they will go on record sn favor of fed
eral Incorporation of all railroad lines
Legislative Program of Railroads.
Prom nn nuthorltatlve soun e Is ob
tained the following outline of the leg
islative program which the railroads
will ask the committee to consider In
Its investigation They will endeavor
to demonstrate to the commission that
one of the principal defects lu the pres
ent svstem of railroad regulation Is
the lack of coordination resulting from
the simultaneous and conflicting I epi
lation by the federal government and
bj the -IS states They will, therefore,
ask that entire governmental control
of the rates and practices of Interstate
carriers, except purely local matters,
be placed In the hands of a fedeial
body to that Interstate tratlle ma.v be
regulated without reference to sate
lines, leaving to the state commissions
Jurisdiction only over local matters and
'-Vyv lcal public utilities As a part of this
plan, a compulsory sjstem of federal
Incorporation Is to be recommended
accompanied hv federal supervision of
railroad stock and bond Issues
A reorganization of the Interstate
Commerce Commission will be usked
In oider to enable the commission proii
erl to exercise Its Increased powers
It Is niso proposed that the preparation
and prosecution of cases against the
railroads shall be delegated to some
other agenc.v of the government, possl
lily the Department of Justice, so that
the commission may devote Its ener
gles to Its administrative functions
With the commission thus relieved
of some of Its present duties and equip
ped to handle Its business more prompt
!y. the railroads will urge that the pe
rlod during which the commission may
now suspend proposed Increases In
rates be reduced from ten months to
X) days, with provision for reparation
to be paid to the shippers if the ad
ranee shall be declared unreasonable.
They will also usk that the commls
on be given the power to prescribe
minimum ns well as maximum rates
n that lu meeting complaints of ills
crlmlnutlon the commission may ordei
.the advance of a rate which It consid
,f ers too low.
One of th most Important recom
mendations for which the railroads
will ask favorable consideration Is
tint the commission be specifically
uuthoilzed to take Into account In
rate regulation the effect of rates
upon total earnings In the light of ex
penses While the New lands Committee Is
required, under the resolution creat
ing It, to submit a report by January
2 next. It Is not anticipated Unit the
Committee will have come an) where
near competing Its labors then.
