Notwithstanding the danger that at
tends receiving and accepting a "bid"
I to the Gridiron Club, politicians fare
the danger with courage. Perhaps
the political game Is like other games
—the more danger attached, the more
sport.
jf,: Mayor John F. Fitzgerald nf Boston
has been deefated for re-election by
Postmaster Hlbbard, the Republican
nominee, by less than 2,000 majority.
This result was brought about, by a
division of the Democratic vote. The
8'fj: candidate received 15,000
ji?jf votes. Fitzgerald had approximately
'86,000 and Hibbard 38,000. Thus in
ternal troubles in the Democratic party
has turned over to the Republicans the
Democratic city of Boston, adding to
the disaster brought about by the di
vision in state politics.
The announcement of President
Roosevelt that he adheres to his deter
l!v mination. as announced on the night.
of election in 1904, not to be a candi
date for another nomination and not
to accept the nomination, ought to put
stop to third term talk. The an
nouncement Is in keeping with the
character of the President. It. is an
other evidence of his patriotism. The
I President, is a student of history and
'appreciates a. great deal more the im
portance of the traditions established
'by Washington and Jefferson than do
the small politicians who have bien
assigning sinister ambitions to him.
"One. hundred millions in certificates

says the Commoner.

lishing compensation to those who lose
toy such accidents. The mine in which
this accident occurred was supposed
to be the best regulated and managed
in the whole mining district. The

and insistently demanded—not only by
ecclesiastics but even by laymen not
only by Catholics but by Protestants
as well, Including certain United
states senators. They once even con
ceived the idea of starting a collective
petition to the Pope, but the project
was abandoned for fear that it would
injure rather than help the cause of
St. Paul's prelate." We suggest that a
cessation of dispatches and interfer
ence on the part of fool friends might
be pleasing alike to the Vatican and
the Archbishop of St. Paul. It would
appear that correspondents of Ameri
can papers ought to learn some time
that the methods applied to affairs
political are not particularly pleasing
to the Vatican authorities when ap
plied to affairs ecclesiastic.
MINNESOTA IN THE LIMELIGHT.
Minnesota is being made conspicuous
by some of the men who now repre
sent it in public life. Until recently It
took no prominent part in national af
fairs. Alexander Ramsey in wartimes,
William Windom in the late 70's and
early 80's, and Cushnian K. Davis in
the. 90's, were the three men of in
fluence and power that Minnesota had
sent to the national councils since its
admission as a state.
The state is now making up for its
former paucity of numbers. From a
national political standpoint Minnesota
is now an important state. It has a
governor whose ability and standing
has attracted the attention of the na
tion. He has not only made a. good
governor but when he has mingled
with the best the nation can produce,
he has honored himself and the state
from which he hails. Several of the
metropolitan papers remark that he
made the best speech made at the
Gridiron Club. Others say that he and
Minnesota's great railway magnate,
James J. Hill, made the best speeches
that were made at the Waterways Con
vention. In the National House of
Representatives Minnesota's Congress
man from its first district, James A.
Tawney, is, next to the speaker of
that bods', the leader of the House
chairman of its great, appropriation
committee the man who handles and
plans for the distribution of the mil
lions of dollars which Uncle Sam an
nually expends in all parts of the
country. Minnesota furnished to the
department'of justice, when it sought
a man to prosecute the great trusts,
Frank B. Kellogg, a man born and
reared within Its borders.
Not, only in the field of politics but
in other lines Minnesota is fast com
ing to the front. The pioneer days are
over. Minnesota is no longer a new
state. Its citizenship, while no better
than those hardy pioneers who con
quered the forests and subdued the
prairies, is nevertheless more enlight
ened politically and insists upon higher
political ideals. It will no longer do
for a man to be simply a "good fel
low," or wealthy, or sectionally avail
able to aspire to and win political hon
ors in Minnesota. He must possess
the ability and training that will en
able him to measure up to the best
jthat there is in national life. Every
one of the nine congressional districts
in Minnesota, should be represanted
by a man as able anfl industrious as
the congressman from the first district.
Especially should the great city of
Minneapolis, which constitutes the
largest and most influential congres
sional district In the United States
from point of population and point of
wealth, place In the Congress of the
United States and keep there, a man
of commanding influence and power.
Minnesota has the soil and the climate
which produces good men as well as
good crops. Heretofore the good men
have been so busy in developing the
stale that they have had no time for
politics. In the past politics went by
default. In the future- Minnesota will
insist upon putting forth Its best men.
The ability of some of its present rep
resentatives will compel a high stand
ard In the future.
KING OSCAR II.
Oscar Il„ King of Sweden, who died
last Sunday amid the sincere mourn
ing of l)ls own people and the esteem
standard of measurement, both as a
man and as a monarch, he was su
perior. It is a peculiar fact that al
though there was not a particle of
Norse blood in his veins he was great
ly loved by the Swedish people. The
spectacle of old men and women and
little children standing throughout the
whole night watching the flag that
was to indicate the recovery or death
of the beloved monarch proves how
peculiarly he was endeared to the peo
ple over whom he reigned. Of all the
kings established by Napoleon his
house alone survives. The great Na
poleon placed his relations on the dif
ferent thrones of Europe. He placed
over Norway and Sweden John Berna
dotte, the French peasant who had
become one of his great marshals. Os
car II. of Sweden was the grandson
of John Bernadotte. There is not a
particle of royal blood in his veins.
His paternal grandmother was the
daughter of a Marseilles stockbroker
of plebian extraction. His mother was
the daughter of Eugene Beauharnais,
with no claim to rank by birth. There
are many citizens of Minneapolis who
ry
can prove a more royal descent than
Oscar II.. King of Sweden, could.
He was the second king of distinction
in his family. John Bernadotte of all
the rulers created by the great Napo
leon ruled well. He was called to be
the heir of a.childless ruler over a
people whose language he could not
speak and he alone it was who saved
anything from the Napoleonic wreck.
His son and his first grandson who
succeeded him made no particular rec
ord. The second grandson of Berna
dotte, who has just died, had abilitl
far above the ordinary. Educated be
yond any other ruler, he was not only
the king of his people but their friend
and adviser—an elder brother to all
his people. He was a scholar, a scient
ist, and a poet of no mean ability. He
was the most democratic ruler of his
time. He was the only king of his time
who could go about his country like
•my 'Other man and be unattended,
without fear and without danger. What
other king could have handled the sit
uation when Norway broke away from
Sweden in such an unselfish, enlight
ened, far-seeing way? Two peoples
had gone at cross purposes and he
was not the king to compel a separate
nation to submit to a government
which they did not desire. If all kings
were like Oscar II. of Sweden there
would be less complaint against mon
archies. The history of his house sug
gests what a glorious thing it would
be if some of the royal families of
Europe could be regenerated by some
democratic plebian stock like that
which flows in the veins of the de
scendants of John Bernadotte.
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.
Not many months since we stated
that Governor Hughes, of New York,
was sure to be a commanding figure
in the next Republican National con
vention. As the months go by, it be
comes apparent to everyone that the
Governor of New York has more posi
tive strength of his own than any other
Republican, the President of the Unit
ed States excepted. Several booms
have been started and have apparently
died away. Several more will surely
be started and will as surely die in
the making. In the meanwhile, Gov
ernor Hughes, a man without political
experience, is playing the political
game to perfection. He is attending to
the duties of his office and refusing to
take part either with the friends of the
President or with his enemies.
Secretary Taft and Governor Hughes
present a striking contrast. Secre
tary Taft. was forced into the presi
dential fight against what were his
own wishes at first. The ambition of
the Secretary of War was to be a
Judge of the .Supreme Court of the
United States. His training, except
during the time that he has been in the
Cabinet, has been along judicial lines.
His earliest political acts show an in
dependence which is admirable. His
administration of the Philippines was
directed by a purpose and desire tn
benefit a dependent people. Not long
ago, but before he became the heir
apparent of the. administration, he
struck out boldly for independence in
politics in the state of Ohio. He went
to Ohio during the last gubernatorial
campaign and denounced Cox, the Re
publican boss of Ohio, and had much
to do with causing the defeat of the
Republican candidate for Governor. At
that time he said that, the conduct of
municipal affairs has no national rela
tion to the conduct of national affairs.
A few months past and the political
standards of the Secretary of State
have changed. He is a. candidate for
the presidential nomination. He ap
pealed to the good people of Oklahoma,
who had suffered for many years un
der a Federal carpet-bag government,
to vote against statehood. He appealed
lo the Republicans of Cleveland to
vote against the best Mayor the city
ever had in order that the national
Republican party might he stronger In
the state of Ohio. The early acts of
Secretary Taft gave him strength witli
the people. His recent conduct char
acterizes him as a man willing to sup
port unworthy candidates and un
worthy movements in order to bolster
up a political party. It is no'teworthy
that the end of the Taft movement
commenced with the change of his at
titude.
On the other hand, Governor Hughes
has attended to the duties of his office,
apparently paying no attention to
presidential politics. His conduct re
sembles that of Grover Cleveland in
1883. It is true, he has made trouble
for himself in the vetoing of a. rate
bill, but by that very act he has gained
strength in very influential quarters
in Republican politics. He has made
himself strong with the people of hia
own state by his fight for the public
utilities law, and above all, he haa
maintained his own availability by re
fusing to mix with either side in the
Republican party. There will be many
new candidates put forward by states
and by the press. They will enjoy a
little prominence for a time, but. when
the national Republican convention
meets, watch Hughes in New York.
WHERE THE
9REDIT
THE IRISH STANDARD, SATURDAY. DECEMBER
BELONG8.
It is a matter of congratulation to
all that the financial difficulties of the
past few weeks are beginning to dis
appear. No one can forecast the busi
ness future, but it seems reasonably
certain that the money panic that
threatened has been averted. The
credit is due entirely to the people
themselves. Depositors have shown
good sense and remarkable patience.
The bankers have been enabled, with
the co-operation of the general public,
to pass over a difficult situation. "With
out the co-operation of the depositors
a money panic of serious proportions
would have surely overtaken the coun
try and brought with it the ruin of
many banks and •onsequent loss to
many people.
If the panic is finally averted, as It
seems probable
now,
pected that the bankers and the sec
retary of the treasury will assume the
credit and ascribe the success to the
deals made by the treasury with the
banks. It may even form the founda
tion for future high financing. The
action of the secretary of the treasury
will surely come up for fair and just
criticism as soon as the'danger of im
mediate panic has passed away. The
press, as well as the general public,
has been very patient with the bankers
during their time
of
words, the action
Every patriotic citizen should be
willing to go to extreme lengths to
avert a panic. Certainly the Ameri
can people have done so in the last
few weeks, bujt,,,\ye think the bankers
and the secretary of the treasury will
make a serious mistake if, now when
the worst of the danger is over, they
should assume the credit for saving
the situation. The facts are too clear
to admit of any. juggling. The high
financing of the Wall street gamblers
brought, on a situation in this country
that called for-Jiigh financing on the
part of the goy$rnjnent. The govern
ment's action, if not positively illegal,
is certainly subject to criticism and
would have brought on severe criti
cism if it were not. for the delicate sit
uation. It amounts to just this: The
United States Treasury turned over to
the banks of the country considerably
over $200,000,00.(1, in actual money with
out any interest and for no govern
mental purpose. This not proving suf
ficient, the United States government
pledged its credit, to the people in this
country who had money and proposes
to sell to them $50,000,000 of canal
bonds and pay them 2 per cent in
terest on those bonds, and $100,000,000
treasury certificates and pay them 3
per cent on those certificates, and turn
over the money thus secured to the
banks.
IN PASSING
L. G. Foley, of Anoka, was recently
named for the new position of inspec
tor of jails, lockups and hospitals.
William J. Bryan for president and
ex-Governor William E. Douglas of
Massachusetts for vice president seems
to be a ticket much in favor at this
time amongst Democratic leaders.

Dr. Ole E. Linger. city physician, died
suddenly Wednesday evening of heart
disease. He had lived in Minneapolis
for some time and stood high in his
profession.
Medals are certainly due. That was
a. wonderful showing made by Minne
sota in her hid for the national Demo
cratic convention. Better to have kept
out of it entirely.
Ex-Congressman Frank M. Eddy
having freed himself from the liquor
habit will now double up on the po
litical habit. He is early on the ground
as a. candidate for the honor of going
to the national Republican convention
as delegate-at-large.
Xavier De Marre, a pioneer settler
of Ramsey county, died at Mahnomen,
this state, last Monday, aged 102 years.
He is said to have owned the land
where the Union station in St. Paul is
now located. How many old settlers
owned that land, anyhow? Next!
The Garfield club of this town went
on record last Monday nigbt in favor
of a national postal savingf bank sys
tem. If this becomes generally known
It will prove a black eye for the system.
The Garfield organisation is some
thing of a hoodoo.'
^•T

It may be ex­
trouble. In plain
of
the treasurer was
nothing more than loaning the people's
money to the banks without Interest.
Before the issue of the Panama bonds
and the treason certificates, the gov
ernment had tflr&ady loaned the banks
over *200,000,000. The issue of the
Panama bonds and treasury certificates
at this time fras' only another way of
extending the government loan to the
banks. It is not pretended that these
bonds and certificates were Issued to
secure money for the use of the gov
ernment. They were Issued,to be sold
to the people to secure money to place
in the banks, the' Panama Canal bonds
bearing 2 per cent interest and the
certificates 3 per cent, both redeem
able by the government. Thus the
government loaned to the banks, 'With
out interest, over $200,000,000 In actual
money and loaned their credit to the
banks for $150,000,000 in Panama Canal
bonds and Treasury certificates, for
which it pays interest on $50,000,000
at 2 per cent and on $100,000 000 at 3
per cent.

The Democratic national committee,
in session at the national capital on
Thursday, decided to hold the next na

decidedly favorable to the nomination

Ay-On-Ye-Ge-Zik, the oldest. Indian
of the once powerful C.hlppewa tribe
of Wisconsin, is dead, having recently
passed away at Shell Lake at the age
of 100 years. Not having been able to
read it was his misfortune never to
have heard of Duffy's malt whiskey.
He might just as well have lived an
other century.
Lawrence S. Vassault, managing
editor of the Bellman, died Saturday
evening of last week at his residence
in this city. Mr. Vassault came to
Minneapolis from San Francisco
about a year ago. He was well known
in literary circles and had been con
nected with several of the leading per
iodicals of the country.
The proposition to make the present
attorney general of this state the Re
publican candidate for governor next
time does not seem to meet with much
enthusiasm. Now this is to be re
gretted'. Mr. Young would run like
wild fire, and then there are so many
people who would like to do something
for or to him.
Next Monday at 12:15 p. m. Minne
apolis will show her patriotism in no
uncertain way. That is the time set
for our country's navy squadron to
sail from Hampton Roads for the Pa

Whistles will blow, flags will go up,
the city hall chimes will be heard anC
a hurrah time generally is expected.

Butler, Pa., United Presbyterian congre
gation, the third'largest of the denom
ination in the country, has decided te
call no pastor at present to fill the va

good enough for the place. Is it pos
sible that the unsophisticated Butler
ites are entirely too exacting or has
the ordinarily limited special study to
become a Presbyterian minister been
entirely wiped out?

Death of Rev. Father Horrigan,
Rev. Father Horrigan, formerly of
South Minneapolis, died at Newark, N.
J., last Monday night. This announce
ment will be received with deep re
gret here where he was well known,
for Father Horrigan was Dominican
prior of Holy Rosary convent for three
years. Six years ago, he went to Kan

work until a month ago, when Ul
healtli caused him to go for a rest to
his home in Newark, where his aged
mother resides. Death resulted from a
stroke of apoplexy. He was 50 years of
age, and had been in the ministry for
many years.

DEATH OF FRANK MAGUIRE.
Hudson's Popular Mayor Passes Away
at His Home in That City.
Mayor Frank Maguire of Hudson,
Wis., well and favorably known not
only by the people of his own city and
state, but by a host of friends and ac
quaintances in other sections as well,
died Thursday afternoon, Dec. 6, at
his late home in that city, aged 52
years. He had not been well for some
time, heart trouble being the imme
diate cause of death.
Francis Joseph Maguire was born in
Gortahusk, County Fermanagh, Ire
land, in February, 1855. In 1873 he
left the old land, arriving first in Bos
ton, where he continued for a year,
thereafter taking up his home in Du
buque, Iowa, where he lived until 1881,
when the spirit of change again cams
over him and it was at this period that
he came to Wisconsin, settling in Hud
son twenty-six years ago. In 1885 he
was married to Margaret F. McGuire,
who survives him, together with five
children. Deceased, in his young man
hood, had devoted much of his time
to railroad work, though for the last
twenty years or more he had engaged
in business affairs and in the pursuit
of farming in St. Croix county. The
steam ferry plying between Hudson
and' Lakeland was part of his prop
erty, and for the past eleven years he
had devoted much of his time to'thls
work, which was under his immediate
charge.
Always active in the affairs of his
city and state, Mr. Maguire naturally
drifted into politics and, in 1889, he
was elected a member of the board of
education, afterwards becoming its
president, and had*filled various other
positions of trust, Including that of
mayor. To this latter position he was
first elected in the spring of 1902, and
was serving his third term In this ca
pacity when the death summons came
to him. In politics he was an uncom
promising Democrat, and was the can
didate of his party for congress from
his district in the fall of 1906. He was
also active in fraternal organizations,
and was prominent in the Catholic
Knights of Wisconsin. Two years ago
his father died. His mother, an aged
lady, four brothers and one sister are
also amongst those who survive him.
Three of the brothers and the sister
live near the old home tn Ireland, the
fourth brother being a resident of
Hudson. The funeral occurred from
St. Patrick's church in Hudson Satur
day morning. Dec. 7, and his remains
were laid to rest in the Catholic ceme
tery near that place.
Possesed, as he was, of many excel
lent qualities of both mind and heart,
the Irish Standard would at this time
extend to his devoted wife and chil
dren, to all who are left to mourn, its
sincere condolence in the loss they
have thus sustained.
A first grade boy brought perfec*
spelling papers home for several weeks
and then suddenly began to mlss-fiv*
and six out of ten.
"How's this, son?" asked his father.
"Teacher's fault," replied the boy.
"How is it the teacher's fault?"
"She moved the little boy that sat
next to me."
