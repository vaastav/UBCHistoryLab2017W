fact that some of the bodies were
counted several times. The relief
workers explained that even today's
revised figures are not to be regarded
as final, inasmuch as many entire
families were destroyed, no members
being alive to report such losses.
It is estimated that 500 houses are
wrecked by fire, that 500 were to
tally destroyed, and that another 1,000
can be restored to use.
Conditions in the town of Dart
mouth were particularly distressing
today. Some of the inhabitants who
were injured by the explosion and the
tidal wave had not received medical
attention up to this morning and the
relief system is being reorganized so
that they may receive necessary aid
at once. In one shelter in Dartmouth,
investigators found 200 men, women

Some of the managers said that their

A PROCLAMATION
By the President of Hie United
States
To The People of the United States:
Ten million Americans are invited to
join the American Red Cross during
the week ending "with Christmas eve.
The times require that every branch of
our great national effort shall be loy
ally uphe'ld, and it is peculiarly fitting
that at Christmas season the Red
Cross should be the branch through
which your willingness to help is ex
pressed. You should Join the American Red
Cross because it alone can carry the
pledges of Christmas good will to
those who are bearing for us the real
burdens of the world war both in our
navy and in the nations upon whose
I territory the issues of the world war
are being fought out. Your evidence
of faith in this work is necessary for
their heartsniug and cheer.
" You shguld.JotahAmerican Red
Cross Wba.us this 'ftrta of t&eNaational
service is steadfastly and efficiently
maintaining1, the overseas relief in
every suffering land, administering
our millions wisely and well and
awakening the gratitude of every peo
ple.
Our conscience will not let us en
joy the Christmas season if this
pledge of support to our cause and the
world's weal is left unfulfilled. Red
Cross membership . is the Christmas
spirit in terms of action.

justice will be opened."
The former premier endorsed Presi

ing clearly the intentions and desires
of the allies. Adverse criticism of
the recent letter of the Marquis of
Lansdowne, he added, vvas caused by
reading into its meanings and inten
tions which the letter did not intend
to convey.
Mr. Asquith said there was abundant
evidence that the enemy peoples are
misinformed of the allies' objects
which are not to annihilate the Ger
man people, but to destroy the mili
tary domination of Prussia. He said
that Germany must learn that the en
thronement of force is bad business.
"The allies are still unflinching in

methods, economic and military, to
secure a lasting and fruitful peace
which the world needs," he said.

General Crozier Explains
Why Equipment Moves
Lagged.
Washington, Dec 12. Inqniry
by congress into the general con
duct of the war was begun today
with investigation by the senate
military committee of the war de
partment's work iu arming' and
equipping the American forces.
Major General Crozier, chief of
ordnance, said an obstacle In the
early work was that the military
policy defined In the national de.
fense act of 1916 contemplated a
force of one million men to be
raised In five years.
"It Is apparent," he said, "that the
original program for one million men
did not contemplate our participation
in the war. We compressed the five
year program into one year when it
immediately became apparent that the
one million program would not do.!
Preparation of estimates and actual
appropriation by congress, the general
saw, causea lurther delay.
Cause of Slowness.
"We did everything we could," he
continued, "to get the manufacturing
establishments of the country going
on orders in anticipation of appropria
tions. One obstacle was that the
many manufacturers did not care to
spend money or could not secure loans
in advance of actual appropriations.
that caused very considerable delay.
There also were delays under the ab-
normal purchasing system necessary, i
wunout time lor competitive bidding,',
in many cases."
Referring to the "cost plus ten pert
cent contracts, Generl4:rozier said
the sytfBtn had "worked out fairly
well. But it is not as good as when
prices are definitely fixed," he said.
"It is better to use that only in case
of emergency.
- Refused Fixed-Piece Contracts.
"Some manufacturers would not
take fixed price contracts at all," Gen
eral Crozier said. "They would not
take the risk except with a profit on!
a percentage basis. They had had j
their fingers burned. No orders fori
rifles were made at a fixed price;
manufacturers wouldn't take the
orders."
Upon inquiry by Senator Wads
worth, General Crozier said that early
in the war the president had allotted
$35,000,000 of his $10,000,000 emergency
fund to the war department and that
emergency orders for material had
been given.
Senator Asks Questions.
Senator Wadsworth asked if any
precautionary steps were taken be
fore the war declaration. "There was
a good deal of thinking and discussion
done," said the gengral. "We prepared
for sudden expansion and did all we
could. We have been kept back by
shifting of labor, by men changin
i emoiovment so often, attracted bv
j h,sr ?es ,r living conditions,
1 England has a law prohibiting men
j from . Ie,avinS munition work without
permission. We would require leg
islation to accomplish that. I do not
find an actual shortage of munitions
labor needed in this country. We
haven't taken men into the military
service to create a shortage."
"Will the American army be able to
supply itself with sufficient artillery?"
asked Senator Reed.

"We are short of artillery for training
purposes, but "we are not short on the
other side, and will not be."
"How long will it take to catch up
on this side?" Senator Reed queried.
"We will be fairly well caught up
on the most important things by next
summer."
Has Plan for Congress.
That he has a plan prepared to sub
mit to congress, with Secretary Ba
ker's consent, to deal with munitiois
labor questions, was stated by Gen
eral Crozier, but he declined to reveal
its scope.

official l.ernian news agency says
demobilization of the Russian

peace negotiations restricted to

that General Oherbatchoff has been
appointed commander in chief, "with
the assistance of the allies" (Teu

ized to open negotiations with Ger

Russia of any definite movement for
a separate peace, the professed aim
of the Bolsheviki being a general ces

ever, the Bolsheviki leaders have in
timated that if the entente govern

a separate peace might result.
There has been no announcement

The fighting at Tamanovka, accord
