How a Judge DIsjMised of a Case in
Spite of nn Obstinate Jury.
Leicislon Journal.
In the attorneys' room in the suprem
court in Auburn, after court or in its inter
missions, they sometimes blaze away. "I
remember the time." said one of the attor
neys, "In the days when Col. Littlefield
was sheriff, that Judge Walton was presid
ing, and the jury was out on a rum case
They had been out a long time, and Judge
Walton was rather nervous, and wanted a
verdict To his clear and rar-seeiug mind,
the most reiiiurknbleliinia'iy ways that ever
held jurisdiction in New England, there was
iiu excuse for any prolonged consideration
of the case by any jury. Leaning back,
seemingly lost in thought, he suddenly sat

won't rlead guilty provided bin rine is put

over and talked with the prisoner. It
took bat a few minutes, and in le-j time
than it could be told ho had r-iraet"d ins

Then the court sent out for the Jury. Gen

that the prisoner himself is quite well sat

guilty and has been fined. You arc ex

to the retirement of
greenbacks- Mr. Cleveland seems barren
of ideas ahito how to restore prosperity.
The business depression is not a question
of good, batl-or,-indlfferent money. The
retirement o'fgrcenbacks and an entire
-Tr
change of our monetary system would
not stimulate trade. Nothing short of a
radical, aggressive policy can force the
millions huarded into circulation, nor
will a change in the character of our
money make it any caster to borrow or
obtain. We must adopt a measure that
will increase values. Will the weary
waggles Wilson tariff do it?
Argument is heard that banks will not
make loans because there Is a want of pub
lic confidence. This is not true. Money can
be freely borrowed, at 5 per cent if good
security can be given, but how t---y
business men arc in a position to i .u
suitable collateral for financial accoiuino
datiou? It Is not a lack of cither money
or confidence which stagnates business.
The liard times arc not the result of bank
Shyloekism nor plutocratic domination.
The country is in an industrial and com
mercial quagmire because botli Congress
and our President are too much imbued
with partisanship to adopt a patriotic
policy and become our rescuers. Plainly
it looks very much as If for that reason
we were incapable of self-government, and
that history must repeat Itself by placing
the government in the hands of an inili
virtual competent to safely guide us out
of our troubles without injury to class or
section. This has been the experience of
every nation -vhicli has heretofore fallen
into adversity.
Briefly review the situation. For years
business has been on the decline. Values
have been shrinking, prices have fallen
and the army of the unemployed has been
steadily increasing in number. Merchants
have seen their stocks diminish in valu",
properly owners have been forced to wit
ness the foreclosure of mortgages because
of an inability tp renew loans, and thou
sands of nulls and factories have been shut
down rrotn lack of demand for their
products. Hundreds of thousands of farm
acres have been allowed to go to waste
because they were unprofitable to till,
and this general collapse of prosperity hns
been caused by the great decline in values.
Consequently the relief must come from
a source that will restore old time condi
tions. The theory of forcing up prices by
adopting free silver is wrong, because it
must be done at th expense of a panic
and an era of bankruptcy. Moreover, there
is no .stability of trade whentliereis a finan
cial Inflation. It is simply stuffing com
merce with wind and the slightest alarm
punctures the seeming good times.
Then how shall we force up values with
out distuibiug financial conditions? It
must be done by a horizontal increase of
the tariff. The prosperous days of the
decade of Ig0-lb00 ran be restored in
no other" way. Tariff tinkering has de
stroyed prices, and tariff readjustment
will uplift them A general advance of
25 per cent, all along the tarirr line will
add from 1 3 to 20 per cent, to the valucof
nearly ex-crythlng in the United States.
It would stimulate demand and revive
trade. The cost of living would be in
creased, but that detriment would be more
than compensated by the gi eater employ
ment and higher wages.
It may be urged that no one would be
specially benefited by the rise in values,
inasmuch as theadvanco would be general.
But with the Increase business men, farm
ers and all clashes of property own
ers would be enabled to borrow money
and &ave their holdings from loss that
is inevitable with many of them unless
there Is a change for the better. The ad
vance of the tariff might enrich manu
facturers, but it would be bettor to give
them the opportunity than to allow banks
toobsti uct progress by hoarding our money.
The country never yet suffered because our
business men were prosperous. As for
revenue tax the products imported In
roreign cssels and through that policy
also build up our merchant marine and
control foreign commerce.
" ITII our extended coastline and shal
low harl.ors it is a question if the
recommendation of the Secretary of the
Navy for an appropriation for thiec nddl
tlonnl battleships is
FIRST not premature. It is
true that the draught
GIA'E of these ships is to
. be not more than
US 3IOIJI! twenty-three feet,
and that they could
CKUISEKS. be used in the Gulf of
Mexico, but we have
no harbor between Port Royal and Gal
veston which thej- could enter. Further
more, there Is greater need for more
cruisers of the New York and Brooklyn
type to protect our growing merchant
marine and rapidly Increasing foreign in
terests. Before building any more battle
ships wc shouid ako provide a suitable
dry dock for their accommodation.
In the event of a war with one of the
European iowers it is doubtful if our Navy
would be called upon to protect our prin
cipal sea coant cities against its battle
ships, especially if our cruisers were suf
ficiently numerous to keep them at home.
Our principal source of harbor defense
would befoundln fortifications and torpedo
warfare, and first-class armored cruisers
are really more necessary at present that
an increase of battleships. It must also be
borne in mind that four such cruisers can
be constructed and equipped at a less cost
than Is required to build three light draught
battleships, and that they arc capable of
inflicting more damage to foreign interests
than the ships recommendedby the Secretary,

LONDON" STANDARD "It is diguiried

sterling (xunnionsen.se. It deserves and
will doubtless obtain the serious study or
the Euiopeau peoples.
"We are of the opinion that the messnge
will excite blttoines.1 in Spain, which
country, nevertheless must, mnt-e m h..r
mind to listen to friendly counsel. Span-
mids may be- excused if they detect a tone
of menace. The condition of Cuba will
certainly not induce impartial observer
to say t nnt menace was unwarranted."
THE LONDON DAILY NEWS is chiefly
inipicssPd by the section of the message
leierriiiK to tuba It admits tlmtihc Ameri
cans cannot be permanently indirferuut
to the disastrous condition of the island,
but says that while the intentions of
President Cleveland and Secretary of
State Olney may be every way good, Eu
ropean opinion is not favorable to the
latest version of the Monroe dnitrin.. ;infi
Spain will have some influent ial suppoitlf
sue noius out against it.
Autonomy would be the bet thing forthe
Cubans, as it would also for Spain.
TH E LONDON CHRONICLE willsay In a
leader on the same subject that the alter
native before Spain is renlly to either
satisfy the Cuba ns or have Cuba taken from
her forcibly. The responsibility will re
main with the United States, and consider
ing the state of Cuba, and what the Cubans
are, a full-sized Nemesis will certainly
await any want of success in American
method.
In conclusion the paper says: "The
Spanish failure is colossal and undeniable.
The United States is ready to tnke upon
itself the Inure burden nf restorlne- .ir.ier
and prosperity In the island. We advise
Spain, in her own interest, to sell Cuba
uiuchiy, nut ue wotuu ue no friend of the
United States who would advise the latter
to buy the Island."
THELONDONDAILYTELEGRAPHwIll
sjy that the message deals with the
Cuban question with great moderation, and
in a most conciliatory spirit. The terms
In which the advice to Spain is couched
cannot offend the susceptibilities of the
most sensitive people in the world, though,
perhaps, It Is a pity that the advice is
accompanied by a menace. Tho paper
adiscs Spain to hasten a settlement of
the Insurrrection.
THE LONDON TIMES will say that the
tone and spirit of the message are worthy
of all praise. President Cleveland, It adds,
gives his countrymen the soundest advice
in the most unexceptional language, nor
can the least complaint be made of the
character of the warnings he addresses to
Spain, though It Js not improbable that
.Spanish pride will take offense.

vision or divine hack hair unhonneted, he
round the thenar packed in o'erv oart. it
was a whole welconu to "Half a King."
'the occasion was tne return of nimble
little Mr. Wilson, or, astie is better known,
Francis "Wilson. He appealed in his new
opera, "Half a King," made over from the
iTt-ncn oy Harry . Smtiii anu strung on
jingles by Ludwig Englaudcr.
Last year the jolly comedian gave his
public a sample or the genteel, just to
.show that he could keep ills tongue in his
mouth it he chose to, that his legs can be
constrained to moments of quietude and
that verbose slang la enly an accident of
IhellbiMttoandnothls own vernacular. He
has now cut loose from the genteel and
once more he Is permitted to convulse his
audience with that lengthy and versatile
tongue, his expressive legs, and his pic
turesque slang. The feeling of constraint
eiigendereJ by"TheChIertain" has thawed
away before the warmunconventionalityof
Hair a King."
A t the risk or being branded as unoriginal,
let it De lecorded that "Hair a King" is
a whole success. There Is scarcely a critic
who hasn't railen into the trap or this
verbiage, so the sin is committed in good
company. The new opera is almost every
thing that It should be. it is rnirin plvt,
not Murnciently involved to establish a new
piecedent in comic opera inanity, the
music nt.s the words, and the words are
good. This opinion Is arrived at, not by
auythlng that issued out or the mouth of
the chorus, out by a carerui rending orthe
book or the piece. Hut those who heard
the entrancing music will bear out the
optimistic oimiion.
ir the English melodrama had nut been
written rirst the Smitli-Letorrier-Vanloo-Englander
piece might have been called
"Th .1 Fata lCard."but,t hat title pre-empted,
"Hair a King" is the next thing. Hair a
playing card is the one point of similarity
in the two pieces, and the only one. The
king of diamonds has been torn 'n half.
One half is found in a basket, together with
a baby, Pierette, left at Tireschappe's
door Iit an unknown. The secret rf the
child's birth is known only to the holder
of the other half of the king, and when the
halves are finally united Pierette turns
out to be a lady of high degree.

grotesque costume was extensive. The
Chinese idea of mi'Mc presented the com
poser with (ome drolleries and the strange
customs of the country practically gave the
librettist carte blanche on Improbability.
The total result of their seizure of the
opioruinlty is "The Mandarin." it is a
huppy combination or color, melody and
run.
Thestory is moreconsistcnllv farcical than
many others which have "appealed for
popularity. A transfer or identities be
tween a Chinese vagabond and the mandarin
or Foo-Cliow lead the characters into a
perplexlnginazethroughwhichtheaudience
follow them with much relish. The lines
are frequently genuinely wittv and the
words of such lyrics and doggerel as could
be distinguished ran with a facile rhythm.
Mr. DeKoven's music is not distinguished.
He has written heretofore to a dignified
standard. In ' 'Robin Hood'' he was appreciated.-
Though only a shade less rine,
"Hob Roy" palled on the public because
of bad management. His "Algerian'' was
cnnccededly delichtful. But he seems to
have become discouraged. He has de
parted from high standards in "The Man
darin," and evidently with forethought.
He has written down to public taste. In
doing tins he has been flippant instead of
snarkling and tunev instead or melodious.
Yet, though it falls below the DeKoven
standard, it is still well up in merit com
pared with the colorless drivel received
rrotn other sources.

upon the stage at intervals. It's as hard
on the audience as it I.s on him, and the

n distinctness or enunciation which is a

Ling-Lo was discreetly amusing.
The scenery and costuming were hand
some and expensive, but tiic consistency
or the incostuming was the one persist
ently weak point or the production. It
was supposed to be Chinese, but when the
gentlemen of the legation come down to
see "The Mandarin" they will not rec

one of the pretty girls of the company,

row of the chorus. Was it pride or an
oversight? The girls all wore high heel
shoes and dresses that didn't suggest any
thing in particular, and certainly nothing
Chinese. Their hair was braided and
rrizzed like any old soubrette, and one
girl In cherry pink tights knocked the color
harmonies into smithereens. The little
details attended to would assist the con
sistency of the production immensely

Stuart RobEon and Madame Jacauschek
drew a large audience at the Lafayette
Square Theater labt night.
The curtain-raiser. "Mr. Gilman's Wed
ding," was a string of farcical situat.oas
which Mr Robion's cleverness and
the queer crack in his voice managed to
make laughable.
The play or ihe evening, "Mrs. l'onder
bury's 1'a.sr," was more succes-srul. The
hen-pecked husband, whose twenty years
of subjugai'on to a wife who ba built up
an absolute tvranny upon an ircidenc of
her early married lire, an incident that
never happened, has caught glimpses of
an ex-music hall singer whose villa ad

his accidental discovery or the truth about
the "'fairy tale" bv which his wife has so
long hectored turn, and the delight with
which he plavs the duncstit tyrant when
he knows the" truth, all make, when taken
together, extremely funny Mtuatious. The
finale or the second act Is especially good
and especially well played.

REPUBLICANS ARE PLEASED.

Mr. ClHpp was asked if lie could state
what occurred at theinterview with Mark

ply. Mr. Clapp said that when the com
mittee went in Mr. Banna informed
Uiem that the "appointment of Mr. Wood
ward will have to stand." This addi
tional fact s'io ws that the appointment had
tieen made on Saturday morning, as pub
lished in The Times. The committee, how
ever, went on andmust have madeastrong

ing against Mr. Woodward, except that he
did not represent In a proper degree the
Republican party for an occasion of thLi
kind. I believe that Mr. Hanna realized
1 the awkwardness of having to change
front on this question, and that he would
have been wining to retain Jir. wood

was the first protestthat he had heard."
THAT CORRESPONDENCE.
This interview as to what took -pltce
shows that Mr. Hanna had not been in
formed by Col. Parker of the general
insurrection ot the Republicans in the Dis

believed that in the morning, when the
appointment was made, he was acting
without protest from any influential Re
