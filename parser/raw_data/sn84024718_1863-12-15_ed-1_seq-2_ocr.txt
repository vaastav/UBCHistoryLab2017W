TRLASUfiY DEPABTMEST, CS.A.,i
Richmond ; Sept. —, 1803. _
TO THK TREASURER, ASSISTANT
Treasurer and Depositaries or the _o_-
federate States:
The present is deemed a fitting occasion to call the
attention of the public .o measures which bare been
provided by Congress lor retlucmg the amount, of
Treasury Notes in circulation.
1. The tir-1 and most important of these measures
is the otler to the public of 250 : 000,000 of six percent
20 year bonds, with interest payable annually in cot
ton or coin. The cotton is to oe delivered at one ot
our seaports, at the valuation ot six pence sterling, or
cents per pound for New Orleans middung. At
the present prioe of cotton at tie sea port--, this inter
est is eqnal to about 20 per cent, per annum; and
ought to raise the value of the Hands beyond any tbat
are on the ma.ket. After seve;al advertisements for
bids, the price of the Bonds hat been adjusted at 50
per cent, premium ; and they are now offered to the
public at that late. By paying in $1,500 in Treasury
Notes at any Depositary of the Treasury, the bolder
may obtain a ilond for $'1,000 payable in coin in 20
years, upon vjich rhe interest .a to be paid annually,
either in coin or witb 500 pounds of cotton of the
quality of >en Orleans middli.g. The advantages of
such an invert nent are obviom. Neither principal
nor inteiest ii subject to deprecation from a redun
dant cuirency. The principal is as eecire as the for
tunes of the (J nfederate States, and tbe interest paid
during the will, at present rates of cotton, pay _v
per cent, per aunum, and atter the war realize six per
cent, in euin or in a commodity of eg lal value
2. The secoad measure adopted by Congress, the
furnishing of treasury notes istned since tbe sth ot
April, 18oS, in six percent, bonds, at any time wiih
ia twelve months after the date ol issue.
The holder may obtain for these WW at the Trea
sury six per cc it. bonds, payable in 3c years but re
deemable alle five years, the interest payable semi
annually.
3. Tbe thi;<l measure is presented by the offer of
five per cent I ill Cer'ificates upon tbe deposit in the
Treasury 6* any Depositary wit.m six monthe cf any
of the notes i»> ed since the oth Apiil, 18«3. These
certificates an.- convertible for six months into Trea
sury notes ot : i,e date of those deposited and if not
re-converttd w ittr.n that time, t'.ey are entitled to be
funded in <»' p.r cent. 30 year bonds, redeemable a»ter
five years, with interest payable semi-annually,
4. Alter 12 non'.hs from the date ot issue, all Treas
ury notes issui- I since sth April, 1863, nnd also all
'Ireasury notes oearing date between that date and the
Ist of December, 1862, are fundable iv four per ctnt.
bonds, which a-e convertible, at the pleasure ot the
holder, into f'm.r per cent. Cull Certificates, entitling
the holder, at any time to Treasury notes ol similar
character wiih .hose paid in by h;m.
These various methods suit the convenience of dif
ferent portions >f the corn—tunity and should all be
urged v ion their attention. But I would more par
ticularly requet-:■ you to use even- me.ns ia your pow
er for inducing general co-operation in the first. If
the holders ot tiie Confederate Carrency will now, by
a united effort, .end their aid, 2£0,000,000 can at once
be remove, from circulation. Sueb a result will be
doublybenefioi..! to every purchaser, lie will first ob
tain for the Tn . sury notes a bond payable in coin,
with the interest secured in a melium, which cannot
be depreciated ; and he will next improve the var*ue of
the Treasury iK. v es remaining in his possession.
1 trust that, n you will at once tafce proper meas
ures to present _nd urge these views upon public at
tention, there n i)l be a prompt a -d effective response.
Tbeauthorit» heretofore given to you to sell these
bonds at si.> pe r «nt. premium it nuw extended uuni

& ALBY,
MI.FCHAKTS,
ACoods, for
to
ass TUX NEWS.
From the rumors of tho last few
days, it would seem that the enemy mv
making a simultaneous movement in all
parts of Western Virginia. Thoy caui-.»
from __.anawiia,and on Satm day last had
a fight with Gen. Echols' eouuuund, it
is repoited, at Greenbrier l'.ridgo, thro 3
miles East of Lewisburg. Gen. Kchob
retreated into Monroe County. At the
same time a force was threatening Col.
Jackson's command in Pocahontas.—
lie has tailed back, it is reported — to
what point we do not know. Tho ene
my also appeared in strong force in the
lower part of the Val ley. They, we un
lerstand, have gone back. At the same
ime a force under the command of Gen.
_vcrill moved op the South Branch
Valley from Hardy County. Suppos
ng it was his object to reach this place
yen. Imboden moved his force trom
Rockingham County to the Shenandoah
fountain West ol this place. As sooni
is he apprised the authorities here ot the
novement ofthe enemy, the regiment
_f August*-Rai J Guards" were sam
toned Tm .lie absence of Coi. Baldwin,]
noriea,Lnw r commanding.—
3y Lieut. Col. Harp. , v £T™_«3th-
Chey responded very pronipu, ~ • !
standing the inclemency of the weather I
rod marched to the expected scene of
.onflici.
We think it probable that this move
ment ofthe enemy in Western Virginia
and in the lower part ot the Valley is
designed to conceal the transfer ot
troops from the army of Grant to that of
They desire to keep our troops so far
away from the Baltimore and Ohio Il?-h!
Road as to make it impossible for them j
to do any damage to that road, and al-j
so to prevent them from knowing, itpos- j
sible, that troops are passing over that
route from Grant to Meade. Another
object may be to concentrate the forces
oi Western Virginia that they may push
on to tlie Virginia and Tennessee ltail
load with the view of cutting off com
limicatioTis with Longstreet and thi ow
ng a column in his rear. If either or
loth of these objects be contem
>la'ed by the onemy, the probability is
hat they will not desire or attempt to
et to this place.
If assured that the enemy were
tying to reach this place, we would
c esire to have the gallant aud noble sol
diers of the Stonewall Brigaie within
call, for we know that they would take
delight in driving the invading foe from
the soil of Augusta. How the hearts
of our people would leap with joy, it
they could greet the arrival of this fa
mous brigade ! That Brigade, individ
ually as well as collectively, is dear to
the hearts of our people, it the e_emy
should come, may the Stonewall Br g
ade be here to see. This is the aspira-
FORT SUMTER.
At nine o'clock on Friday morning
this fort took fire from some cause. —
The fire communicated to some outer
timber work ofthe south angle, and the
wood work was burned and some am
munition destioyed. There were some
casualties, but the particular have not
yet been received. The enemy's land
batteries opened heavily on the Fort
during the progress of the fire, and were
replied to fiom Moultrie and our batte
ries. A heavy firing was kept up all
day, which ceased at dark. Damage to
Sumter not material.
COLUMUIA FURNACE BURNT.
On Wednesday last, the enemy came
up the Cedar Run Valley, croesod the
North Mountain at the Columbia Fur
nace which they deslroyed, passed
through Edingburg and Woodstock and
returned towards Winchester. There
were but 75 men in this Yankee raid,
yet they succeeded in inflicting great
loss upon us by burning the Columbia
Furnace, which was doing a great deal
of work tor the Confederacy.
We have been informed that a guard
of fifteen men kep-, them in check till
their ammunition was exhausted. Two
of the guard were wounded and three
ofthe enemy unhorsed.
TO POST-MASTERS.
There have been some complaints late
ly by our subscribers in portions of' Rock
bridge county that they do not receive
theirpapers regularly. We assure them
that the fault is not in this office, as a'l
the papers are put in the Post-Office
here regularly every Tuesday. We
would request the Post-Masters on tne
route to look sharp and do tbeir duties
faithfully.
LEG IS I.ATURE.
t The Legislature convened on Mon
-1 day, the 7th instant, but for several
days there was not a quorum, and con
sequently no business could be transac
ted. That body h„s not, as yet, perfec
1 ted any Legislation, and it is not there
f. re nocessiry to publish the proceedings
it is veiy probable that nothing will be
done tiii after the Holidays.'
GEN MORGAN,
It seems that Gen. Morgan did not
go to Toronto, Canada, after his escape
from prisoD, as reported last week, but
that he traveled South and has succeed
ed in getting within our lines, lt is re
ported that two of his Captains have
been captured in Kentucky. We hope
it i 3 true that Gen. Morgan has gotten
within our lines.
GRANT SUPERSEDES MEADE.
Gen. Longstreet is reported to have been
on the 6th inst., at liean . Station, fifty
mhes from Knoxville. It is reported,
also, that thirty thousand troops from
Gen. Grant's army will be sent to rein
force Gen. Meade, and that Gen. Giant ■
will supersede Gen. Meade in the com
mand of the army confronting Gen. Lee.
TO RE HUNG.
Mr. Wm. E. Coffman, of Rockingham,
charged with the offence of piloting
and assisting deserters to escape to the
lines of ihe enemy, Has been tried by
Couit Martial ia the command of Gen.
Imboden, found guilty and sentenced to

STA TJNTON SPECTATOR AND GENERAL ADVERTISER.
THE BATTLE OF FAYJSE'S FARM.
The recent engagement on the Rapi
dan has been designated the battle of
"Payne's Farm." The battle reflects
iiuicli credit upon the skill of Maj. Gen.
Edward Johnson and the gallantry of
the officers and men of his division.—
The division is composed of tho Stone
wall Brigade, under Gen. J. A. Waller,
aud Stewart's, J. M. Jones', ard Staf
ford's brigades, With lour pieces of An
derson's artillery. These were the only
troops engaged in tho battle on our side.
Opposed to them were Major General
Fioncl.'s corps (3d) and one division of
the sth corps. The enemy was in posi
tion and opened the attack before our
t'oices knew of their presence. Their
object, as has since been ascertained,
was to make a sudden attack from their
concealed position upon our flank, dis
perse the troops, aud capture our wag
on train. They not only failed of their
object, but were driven from the held
with considerable sii ughter. Their loss
was certainly double that of ours, exclu
sive of fifty prisoners.
The following are the casualties re
ported iv the

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE
SECRETARY OF WAR.
The report of the Secretary of War is
too lono- for us to publish it in full. We
give a synopsis of his recommendations:
The Secretary refers to the operations
ofthe army in its several departments,
and says that the campaign in Missis
sippi was certainly disastrous. It is
difficult to lesist tho impression that its
disasters were not inevitable. That a
Court of Enquiiy, to investigate the
whole campaign, met in Atlanta in Sep
tember, but in consequerco of the vi
cinity ofthe enemy requiring the pres
ence of witnesses and judges at ether
points, it has been temporarily suspen
ded. It is ox.} ected soon to re"a_semble.
A deficiency of resources in men and
provisions, rather than reverses in bat
tie, caused tlie withdrawal of the army
to Miildle Tennessee. He alludes to
desertion, straggling & absenteeism, &
say 3 that tbe effective force ot the army
is but little over half or two-thirds of
the men vhoae names are on the mus
ter rolls. He recommends the repeal of
the substitute and exemption provisions,
and that the privileges which Congress
granted to put in substitutes can be reg
ularly and constituticnally abiogate ;
by the same power. He says that no
compact was entered into between the
Government and the person furnishing
a substitute, as lias been alleged, but
only a privelege which Go ;er.iment ac
corded. Instead of complaining ot snch
abrogation, the person ought to feed
_ ratified at what lias heretofore been al
lowed him. He recommends an abridg
ment of exemptions and the conscrip
tion of them all, making details accor
ding to the wants of society, at home.—
He says that the three years'men, when
their terms expire, cannot be finally
discharged, and should be retained, al
lowing them to choose the existing
company under its present organization,
in the _____ arm of the service. He
recommends the consolidation of such
companies and regiments as are reduced
below a certain complement. He pays
a glowing tribute to the heroism, endu
ranee and unfaltering devotion of the
soldiers, and of the lamented dead who
yielded their lives as sacrifices upon the
altar of Liberty, and closes by saying
that our very reverses, showing a uni
ted and determined endurance of every
thing for independence, must convince
the enemy of the futility of Li 3 efforts
to subdue us.
LINCOLN'S MESSAGE.
The .Richmond papers of yesterday
contain the message of Abraham Lin
coln. As the train was vielayej, we
did uot receive them in time to
an opportunity of reading that precious
document, and are therefore unable to
<?ay very little more than to announce
that it has been published in tue South
ern papers. Lincoln says tha while he
shall remain in his present pos ; tion, lie
will not attempt to retract or modify his
emancipation proclamation, and lhat he
will not retnrn tj slavery any pe"so:i
win) is tree by the terms of that procla
mation, or by any of the acts or Con
gross.
This is useless information, as no one
ever supposed that he would b? capable
of dohg anything that was right, lie
d :m?s wrong, and takes pleasure in his
evil acts. He may know the right, but
the wrong ho will ever pursae.
SUBSTITUTES.
As some persons, speaking at random,
have asserte i that thore are as many as
twelve or fifteen hundred substitutes in
r he army as the representatives of citi
zens of this county, we deem it pioper
to state that thi? is a very _reat exag
geration, as Ihe Enrolling Officer says
that the number is less than lour nun
dred.
LEMONS AND ORANGES.
Those who w'sh to indulge their pal
ates in these delicious fruits can now
have the pleasure of doing so, as Mr. H.
I*. Cease, Confectioner, has purchased
a considerable quantity of them from
Mr. Wm. Kerr, who has just returned
from Florida. He presented a lemon to
us which -weighed one pound and a quar
ter.
B__f" Mr.- and the Misses Slcman, on
Saturday and Monday nights last, favor
ed the citizens of this place with their
interesting entertainments. They will
give anctiif r concert to-night '
THK PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
We regret tbat the length of President's Davis'
Message is so great as to render its publication
in full in our paper an impossibility. It, occu
pies nine and a half columns of the "Enquirer"
in small type. We, must therefore, upon the
principle of cutting tbe coat to suit the measure
of the cloth furnish a synopsis of its contents in
lieu of a full report.
The President rapidly reviews the events ofthe
past year, remarking that whilst our successes
have not equalled our expectations wa have checked
the enemy everywhere in his advance. Our re
lations with foreign nations _re discussed at con
siderable length. The Piendoul regrets that
there tins been no improvement since tho 'Mes
sage of January last, and tbat the conduct ol the
European nations is less impartial and in some
cases has assumed a character positively unfriend -
ly to tho commissioners which were sent abroad
;or the purpose of entering hit o negotiations prop,
er to fix the relative rights and obligations of the
Confederate and United States under treaties en
tered into with foreign nations prior to the sep
aration which has taken piaje; but this tender
on our part was deolned —hence, as we have
been refused the benefit of i hese treaties, they
certainly have ceased to be binding and iv the o
pinion of the President our relations with Euro
pean nations are now controlled exclusively by
the general rules of the law of nations.
-legislation upon the subject ol finances is
earnestly recommended. Although the magni
tude aad duration of t.ac war was not at first an
ticipated, still the resources of tho country are
so ampfe and ihe spirit of the people so .-/voted
to its cause that relief is within our reach.
The financial policy of the Government since
its formation is discussed., and the President con
tends that whilst the'previskvis of the permanent
cjnstitutioniureferer.ee to-.lirect taxationcan
not be earned into tfiect in the mode pointed
out, it is plain that it is tho duty of congress to
execute the general intent of the Constitution by
making taxes uniform th;-o!igdout tue C'j_feder
ate Sta.es. These aro grtatl y en
fore d by the reflation that un attempt to appor
«?_ „__es amongst the S:<:_i, some of which
are wholly or partially in the occupation of hos
tile forces, would subvert the whole intention ol
the iramei's ot the Constitution, and Ue produc
tive of the most revolting injustice instead of
that just co-relation between taxation and rep
resentation which their purpose secured. With
large portions of some of the States ocupied by
the enemy,.what justice would there be in impos
ing ou the remainder the whole amount of tax
ation of the entire State in proportion to is rep
resentation?
What els« wou jd this be in effect than to in
! crease the burthen of these who are the heaviest
| sufferers by the wa r J and make our own inabili—
Ity to protect them from invasion, as we are re
quired to do by the Constitution, ground for ad
ding to their losses by an attempted adberance
to the letter in violation of th's spirit of that in
strtiment, No such parposi could have been
entertained and no such result contemplated by
the framers of the Constitution. It may add to
the of weight these considerations if we reflect
that although the Constitution provides that it
should go into operation with a representation
temporarily disttibuted amor g the States, it ex
pres9ly ordains that after providing for a census
within three years this temporary distribution ot
representative power is to endure until such e
numeration shall be made. Would any one argue
that because the census cannot be made within
the fixed period the Government must at the ex
piration of that period p -rish for want ofa rep
resentative body ? In any a,spect in which tht»
subj ict can be viewed I am Jed to the conclusion
already annouueed, and wh;r>, i„ understood to
be in accordance *«*_ a votß ukon in one or both
a t | as t session. 1 shall therefore until
we are able to pursue the precise mode requir
ed by tue Constitutiou deem it my duty to ap
prove any law levying taxation which you act:
bound to impose for tho doiesce of the country,
in any other p.acticable mode which shall dis
tribute the burthen uniformly and impartially
on the whole property of the people.
In your former legislations you havo sought
to avoid an increase ot the volume of notes in
circulation by offering inducements for voluuta
riaily funding. Measures adopted for that pur
pose were bat partially succss-ful, the amount
has now reached such magnitude as to permit of
no other remedy than compulsory reduction ot
currency to the amount required by >.ho business
of the country.
This reduction should be aoeo._pa.iied by a
pledge that under no stress of circumstances
will that amount be exceeded. No possible
mode of using the credit of the government can
be so disastrous as one which disturbs the basis
of exchange, renders impossible all calculations
ol the future values, anguetits in constantly in
creasing proportions the price cf all commodi
ties, aud so depreciates atl fixed wa>?es, salaries
and incomes as to render them inadequate to bare
subsistence. If to tljis be added the still more
fatal influence on the ru.-r.ls an l character of Un
people, to whi< h I havo already adverted, I am
persuaded, you will concur in tt ; o conclusion
Hi tt an inflexible adherence to a lf_dt_trf_ ofthe
currency at a fixed sum is an inetupenSable ele
ment ofany system of finance now to bo adopted.
Holders of currency (low outstanding can only
be protected ia the recovery of their just claims
by substitiitng for uo'es some other security.
If the currency is not greatly and promptly re
duced tho present scale ot inflated prices wil!
not only continue to exist, but by the v< ry fact
of large amounts thus made requisite in
duct of the war, those pti.es trill reach rates
still more extravagant and tha whole system
will fall under its own weight, rendering the
redemption of d. bts impossible and tb-ttfoyinf
its whole value iv the hauds of the holder. If,
on the contrary, a fouuded debt, with h tereat
secured oy adequate taxation, is substituted for
the oitt-slandiug currency, its entire amount will
be availaole to the bolder and Government will
be in a conditiou enabling it beyond tho reach of
any probable contingency to prosecute the war
to a successf all issue.
It is, therefore, demanded as well by the inter
est of the creditor as of the country at large
that the evidences of public doht now out-stand
ing in the shape of treasury notes bo converted
into bonds bearing adequate interest with pro
vision for taxation sufficient to insure the punc
tual payment and final redemption ofthe wnole
debt. *
The President recommends t> the considera
tion of Congress tho report jof the Secretary of
the Treasury, and hopes it will engross the con
sideration of that body until disposed of in the
manner best adapted to attain the important re
sults which the country anticipates irom its ac
tion-
The President believes the army to be, in all
resj eets, in better cond tion than at any previ
ous period ot the war. lie recommends the res
to-ation to the army of all who ate improperly
absent, putting an end to substitution, tnodny
ing the exemption law, restricting d. tails auu
placing in tbe ranks able-bodied men now om
ployed as wagoueis, nurses, cooks and employ,
ees doing service for which negroes may be
foutid competent.
JBL concurs iv the opinion expressed ly the
Secretary of war that there M ut- ground for the
objection that a new provision to include those
who furn-sh substitutes uncer the ton.er call
would be a breach ofcontrtct. The action of
the several executive departments is reviewed
anil the giativinga.. ; otiiij. Hie at [_«__ that the
receipts of tbe post cilice di-partm'-nt aro six hun
dred and seven'y-five thousand dollars in exc-s.i
ofthe expenditures. Commit vi -.Lin with Trans-
Mississippi is so obstructed as to render difficult
compliance wUh tht executive needs. Legtcla
tion is r> quired providing fir the exeroipc of
temporary authority, especially in the Portal
Department and Treasury, for which the sW>-
iecretanes are recommended, while for miiitiiry
affairs it would seem to ue sufficient to aattorize
the President and Secretary of* war to delegate
to the commanding Gen'l so mi eh of the discre
tionary powers vested in them by law as exigen
cies oi the service shall rtquiu'. In conclusion
the President adverts to the savage ferocity ol
the enemy in conducting war, aud holds up to
Public execration the refusal of tho Lincoln
Government to execute the cartel for tho ex
change of prisoners. But the patriotism of the
peopie had proven equal to evory sacrifice de
manilel by their country's ttved, aud God had
blessed us with suecrs* disproportionate to our
means and under his divine favor our labors muit
at last bo crowued with success.

GOV. LETCHER'S MESSAGE.
The message Of Governor Letcher is rery long,
filling nine and a half columns of the Kichmond
"Enquirer." It quotes the remarks of Samuel
Adams of Massachusetts delivered in 1776 to
show tiiai our present struggle for independence
is justified as was that of our fathers in the
first revolution. Honor, justice, propriety—
every consideration that should influence good
and patriotic men—show tbe necessity of our e
ternal separation. Men who preach peace under
present circumstances are false to us and the
Confederacy. It is time enough to speak of an
fconorabl. peace when Lincoln shall have with
drawn hi. aiinies from our soil.
An classes, rich and poor, aro equally inter
ested in t_k str.ggio. Those who m.iutain the
contrary arc enemies to our cause an.l success.
Iv the main, they are men who were active in
bringing about ate present war, but who have ta
ken peculiar pains to keep out ot tlie light. I
riappon to kuow ofa number of such iv our own
State, who have domiciled themselves and tami
lies in i>oi t places, and have thus escaped the
danger, of tbe tieid. They were lor commotion
and agitation, not tor a tight and take their chan
ces for martyrdom in a glorious cause.
Legislation is required for tne protection of
our people against the impositions practiced by
impressment officers »ml persons claiming to be
sucn, and I trust it "xiit be hack at this session.
Impressment should be apportioned according to
the quantities on hand in each neighborhood,
leaving a puitiou to eacu tarmei, to oe di.p_.ed
ot for ibe inhabitants of tue cities and ibe pour I
ol tne country. If any other system be adopted I
(listr vS», dissatisfaction aud starvation will h»

He renews his recommendation oi the last ses
sesion for au organization of ail abio-bodied
persons in our State, lor the purpose of home
defence, and to aid, if necessary, iv the execu
tion ot the laws.
He was opposed to the policy of substitution,
but as it was adopted, he is oppos-.d to violating
such contracts as nave been made by rtquiring
the principal to go into the service. Contracts
between governments and individuals shouid at
all times be held sacred and inviolable. No Gov
ernment winch violates tbem can long maiutain

are forfeited by a government, tbe public confi
dence iv it is at an end.
He recommends the use of free negro labor ex
clusiveiy m the repair of our railroads.
Of the currency, he s that excessive issues
have caused distrust wita the people as to their
ultimate redemption, andheuce tho great depre
ciation aud the enormous prices now demanded
for articles of prime necessity. Confidence must

The people generally complain that the pro-
Visl .Oa of ibe law, which requires the Conieder
_to Government to pay th. value of sucn slaves
may die, or be not returned to their owners,
nas not bitou complied with, and they have no
guarantee that slave* now sent, if lost, wilt oe
paid for. Th. reason assigned to me for non
payment has been that Congress had made uo
appropriation lor this object, and that payment
Co.id uot bo atade u_ti) a bill appropriating the
amount necessary had become a law. Within
tho la_t lew days I have been informed that it is
tho opinion ot the War Department that all such
claims must oe heard before the court of claims,
wru.n that court sh.il be organized ; and that no
paymtnia can be ntade without a favoraole judg
ment oe prouounci-d by such tribunal. Such a
construction seems to me to be at war not only
with tbe spirit but also the letter of tue law re
quiring the Executive to comply with the Fresi
ueni's requisition.
ii this uo the construction whicn is to be pla
ced on tins »aw, it is uot wond.riul that dissat
isfaction and indisposition to comply with the
lequisiuons should be the consequence. A
slave lost in this service a year ago could not
now be replaced at less than double the value
fixed at that day ; aud it the demand ot his owner
is postponed, until a Court ol Claims shall be or
ganized, it is equivalent to nearly a total loss.—
ie is in Uiy jtuginem tho duty ot our Senators
and liepi'o___tative» t_ Congress to see lhat an
appropriation lor tnis purpose is made witnout

Which with a few warrants issued in the year,
and not collected, as is explained in the Audit
or's report, will make tbe actual balance $1,377,-
--868 95.
The auditor's estimate ofthe probable receipts
into the Treasury lor the fiscal year ending 30th
September, 1864, with the balance on baud at the
commence merit ol the year, is $10,066,002 67;
and bis estimates fov the probabie charges upon
tue treasury for the same ye*r is $12,910,783 79 ;
winch for the present tiscai jear will i-avea bal

Than Virginia no State has been more loyal,
more faittitnl, more devoted. None has con
tributed more liberally iv means and men—none
has bared her breast more boldly or defiantly to
tne storm—and none has sent her "reapers to the
harvest of death" with more sell sacrificing de
votion tnan the Commonwealth ol Virginia.—
She en'iisim ior flic war after full consideration,
and with a just appreciation of atl the conse
quences tbat were to follow the separation, and
Niie wili be true to tho end. She will never sue
for peace, because she did uot bring on this war.
S'le will never propose compromise, because she
struggles only tor her rights, her lioerty and her
independence. She will, as becomes the mother
of Slates, stand up boldly, and hurl scorn and
defiance in the lace of her fooa until they come
to her terms. She wiil never consent to a treaty
ot peace wiiicL dismembers her own territory, nor
wiil she cons >nt to a treaty which does not recog
nize fully ihe Confederacy. She knows what is due
to her owu dignity aud character, and she knows
what is due to tbe Confederacy and duty will
be performed with scrupulous fidelity. Kneel
ing around the altar ofthe country, her sons wiii
s>vear allt „ anee to her, an t fidelity to the Con
federate Government, and their prayers will as
cend to heaven for blessings on Virginia and the
Southern Confederacy.
Thanks to the Ruler of the Universe for His
blessings conferred upon us with such liberality
—for tbe successes which have attended our arms
—tor the uuity and harmony of our people—and
(Or the spirit and courage with which Ho has
nerved them lor this coutest.
Respectfully,
