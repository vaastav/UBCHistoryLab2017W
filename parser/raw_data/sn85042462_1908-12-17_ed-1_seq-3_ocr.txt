POLICE END BATTLE
Students Engage in Struggle with
Bare Knuckles and Land in Jail.
Later Combatants Are
Released
After engaging in what was sched
uled to be a finish fight with bare
knuckles last night, Frank Laranita,
f.39 New High street, and Fred Hilpert,
3420 South Los Angeles street, were ar
rested on charges of disturbing the
peace. Later they were released.
Laranita and Hilpert are students at
a business college and were teasing
one another by calling names. Hilpert
dubbed Laranita "Togo the Jap," and
] aranita challenged the former to fight
a duel with lists. The boys, accom
panied by forty to fifty of their school
i"Hows, adjourned to a vacant lot at
Ninth and Broadway and engaged in a
llnish contest, which ended when a po
liceman appeared on the scene and ar
rested them: Hilpert fractured a
Knuckle of his l"ft hand, which was set
at the receiving hospital.
Hundreds of Physicians Use
Puritas Distilled
Water
They Realize That Pure Water Is
Essential to Health and Recog
nize That Puritas Is Pure,
Wholesome, Healthful
The best indorsement that Puritas
Distilled Water could have in the fact
lhat hundreds of local physicians use
and recommend it.
These men recognize^ that pure water
is essential to health. Their training
and experience has taught them to
realize the absolute reliability of Furi
laa Distilled Water.
They know that Puritae has been
distilled in Los Angeles for many
vears- that it -is a scientific produc
tion; that its standard of purity and
wholesomeness has always been main
tained—and so they feel safe in using
it and recommending it in their prac-
Puritas is used also in almost all
leading hospitals in Los Angeles—ln
stitutions where a supply of pure wa
ter must be available at all times.
Our methods of distilling and bot
tling Puritas insure its purity. It is
twice distilled; it is aerated with pure
..zone; it is bottled In clean glass
demijohns so carefully that it reaches
\ ou pure—and if the •demijohn is care
j'ully corked when not in use, will re
main pure until the last glassful of
water has been consumed.
Puritas is Inexpensive. Five gal

INSULTED THEM

RESENT MESSAGE
LANGUAGE OF PRESIDENT TO BE
SUBJECT OF INQUIRY
Republicans and Democrats Unite in
Step to Show Disapproval of
Chief Executive's Late
Criticisms
(Continued from Page One)
rich resolution with the addition of the
Culberson provision.
• After an animated discussion th>R res
olution was adopted -without division,
and tlniH was the tmtulry decided upon.
The resolution as adopted follows:
Resolution as Adopted <
"Resolved, That that portion of the
annual message of the president relat
ing to the gecrel service is hereby re
ferred to the committee on resolutions,
who are Instructed to inquire whether
the legislation referred to "in the tnes
has Impaired the efficiency or suf
flctency ol the force employed in the.
secret service; and such committee are
further directed to ascertain what per
sons other than those included in tiro
secret service were paid from the pub-
Ho treasury for the fiscal year ended
.Turn.- so, loos, for services In connection
with the enforcement of the laws or
for work In the detection or investiga
tion of possible crimes or criminal acts
or violations of the law, Including all
special attorneys, special agents, In
spectors or other employes of any de
partment of the government, or any
branch of the public service, and also
some Information as to all persons
whose employment was authorized by
indefinite or general appropriations; the
informations to contain the names of
all persons so employed or paid, their
previous occupation, the nature of the
work in which they were engaged, by
whom they were appointed and upon
whose suggestion or recommendation;
the Inquiry, however, not to include
officers appointed by the president and
confirmed by the senate or officers spe
cifically provided by law, or laborers
appointed as such, and actually en
gaged in employment as laborers."
To Subpoena Witnesses
The resolution further authorizes the
committee on appropriations to sub
poena witnesses and examine them un
der oath, mid further to report what
action, if any. In the judßinent of the
committee the senate should take.
Mr. Bailey objected to the resolution
because it did not dirert the <-ommitteo
to inquire into "very gross and wanton
words" of the president's message.
"So far as t am concerned," ho. said,
"no action .should be taken on that res
olution until that point, i.s covered.
Either congress is the must infamous
body that over assembled in any coun
try of the world, or it will take some
notice of this most wanton and gross
insult ever given any body in the
world."
Mr. Aldrich insisted the. resolution
provided for just, what Mr. Bailey ad
vocated, but the senator from Texas re
torted that if that was included in tin:
resolution It was in mild terms.
Mr. Half) declared the resolution was
sufficiently strongly worded to permit
the committee on appropriations to
make the kind of report required hv
Mr. Bailey.
"1 would like to inquire from the sen
ator from Maine," interposed Mr. Till
man, "whether he thinks the senate
lias been insulted?"
Mr. Hale Insisted everyone had hi«
own opinion on that subject and any
one was as able as he to form an
opinion.
Tillman Resentful
Mr. Tillman insisted that, according
to the president's message, congress is
composed of a lot of "rascals and.
scoundrels who belong in the penlten-
Mr. Hale replied that there had been
a great deal of "restlessness and In
dignation in the senate."
"There is no restlessness at the
White House," retorted Mr. Tillman.
"They are content and calm as can
be there."
Mr. Culberson said the message
"was a deliberate, studied and gratu
itous insult to the congress by the
president."
Senator Newlands declared that the
question at issue was whether the
secret service had been used to inves
tigate congressmen in the pursuance
of their legislative duties or was only
to detect fraud ill the duties devolving
upon the executive departments."
Mr, Newlanda said he whs not at
tempting to apologi/.e for tlie presi
dent, but wanted to have the senate
avoid any hasty and improper lan-
Tho resolution was passed without
a roll call.
Letter from Wright
President Roosevelt sent to congress
a letter of the secretary of war trans
mitting a memorandum prepared by
Judge Charlton of the bureau of insu
lar affairs and Richard Rogers, the
general counsel of the Isthmian.- canal
commission, bearing further upon trie,
charges that Americans were interested
iu the Panama canal property at tha
lime of the purchase by the United
States.
The memorandum states that at the
time the property was transferred it
included the so-called "Archives" and
they are now in thu possession of this
government. . ■
Kxamluation of these archives by
Messrs. Charlton and Rogers show,
however, that neither at the time of
tho tirst examination or now were
there any lists of stockholders in tho
old or new Panama Canal company ex
cept those contained In the formal min
utes.
The minutes of the last meeting
prior to the transfer of the property
were not contained in the archives sur
rendered, and the law officers say that
the United States government has no
concern in them.
It is believed to be Impossible, there
fore, to gather from the records the
names of any Americans, if any, who
profited by the sale of the'property. ■•
Fail to Agree • - •'' J*
Although two meetings of the special
committee of the house to recommend
action on the president's reference to
the motives of congress in laying a
■limitation on the use of the secret ser
vice force were held the committee was
unable to reach a unanimous agree
ment and adjourned until tomorro*.
It Is understood that the commit
unanimously believes that the house
Rhould express iis displeasure regard-

ation ot the bill to revise the penal
laws of the United .States.
The Garrett amendment, which came
over from last niprht and which pro
hibited sending through the mails in
formation bearing on transactions In
futurew, was defeated by :l decided
vote.
Without opposition an amendment by
Mr. Houston of TVnnesKee was adopted,
making It an offense to deposit in or
ship through the mails intoxicating
liquors.
There was still pending when the bill
was laid aside an amendment by Mr.
Humphreys of Mississippi, providing
for the identification of intoxicating
liquors transported by interstate car
rier". This proposition caused extended
debate today.
Insurgents Hold Meeting
Another step toward amending the
rules of the house was taken tonight
when the insurgents held a mass meet-
Ing. Tho report of tliu committee ap
pointed at the Insurgents' meeting l^st
week was submitted, although tho com
mittee had much 'difficulty in reaching
an agreement.
Col Hepburn, chairman of tho com
mittee, informod the gathering that
tho committee had decided some change
In tho method of selecting committees
in the houso was desirable.
It had been agreed that tho rules
should be changed so that one day each
week should be set aside exclusively for
the call of the committees.
In regard to the change in the method
of choosing committees the report was
a compromise, the committee refusing
to agree to the proposition that a steer
ing committee be elected by the housa
to select the committees.
Col. Hepburn, in making his report,
recommended the election of a commit
tee of nine members of the house to
choose the committees, the committees
themselves to elect their own chairman.
This suggestion met with opposition
and led to a prolonged discussion.
No action was taken on the recom
mendations, as it was believed more
time should be given to considering the
change. The meeting adjourned to
meet in January. Hayes of California
was among those present.

CARACAS TURNS
AGAINST CASTRO
(Continued from Pifco Onr)
from Caracas this morning but they
mentioned nothing or the kind."
President Castro was asked for an
expression of his views regarding Hol
land's Belzure of Venezuelan ships, but
referred the correspondent to Senor
Veloz Golticoa, Venezuelan charge
d'affaires, whom ho authorized to talk
f or him. The Charge then said:
■'I doubt what . has been published
with regard to Holland's aggression,
because no declaration of war has
been made, nor has a blockade been
announced and j none established.
Therefore the seizure of sinall \ ene-
KUelan vessels by sheer force cannot
be described other than as an act of
piracy, unworthy o( any enlightened
civilized country.'
"On the other hand, such a course
would jeopardize the arrangements
which Venezuela has proposed to Hol
lund through confidential agreements,
and could even have a worse effect,
inasmuch as Venezuela in meeting
payments due to Holland takes for
that purpose a portion of the pre
scribed 30 per cent of the customs re
ceipts. Thus Holland's act might place
Venezuela in a position of being unable
to continue payments and would jeop
ardize the interests .if other nations.
"Holland is in the wrong and is still
more involved through' the •' attitude,
which the Dutch government recently
adopted." -_►♦_- *
