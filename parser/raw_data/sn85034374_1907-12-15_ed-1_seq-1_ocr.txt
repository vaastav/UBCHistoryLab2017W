Jcanette Bogle, Atlanta Girl, Persists
in Efforts to Kill Herself.
Morning Times Special.
Atlanta, Dec. 14. Still determined
to die, pr.'tty Jeanette Bogle, who has
failed jr. three successive attempts to
committ suicide, adopted a unique
method to conceal a bottle off chlo
roform, with which she intended to
make a fourth attempt on her life.
lowing the tnree attempts at
j suicide, officials of the Salvation Ar
j n placed. the young woman in the
They j hands of the sheriff, and she was
! taken to the Tower for safe -keeping,
j it being hoped that it would prevent
any further effort to kill .herself.
It was suspected that Miss Bogle
had poison concealed somewhere
about her person, and Jailer Fain was
notified of this suspicion.
When the young -worn at was taken
back into the prison inside Jailer
Holloway was directed to search her
for poison. The jailer failed however
to find anv ooison about her and was
abtt to give up the search, when he j
thought of here hair.
On making a close examination,
the jailer discovered a bottle of chlo
roform concealed in the young wo
man's wealth of hair. She had ar
ranged the bottle so it would serve
the purpose of a rat, and thus be less
liable 'to discovery.
Miss Bogle appeared disconcerted
when the poison was found, but
quickly exclaimed: ,
"It will do you no good to take that
poison away from me for I am going
to kill 'myself just a.s soon as I get
out of-here."

BLACK BAYOU
DRAINAGE REPOHT
AGAI BROUGHT TO THE PEO
PLE'S ATTENTION, v
DRAINAGE 13 VERY IMPORTANT
Means the Reclamation of Thousands
cf Valuable Land and is a Matter
of Utmost Importance To the Peo
ple of This District.
The following report made by the
federal government expert on drain
age,, and who made a survey of
Black bayou for the purpose Of deter
mining .. whether ' it was practical or
not, was first published three years
ago and many of you doubtless re
m ember same. However, as there
are many who may have forgotten
it or who had never read it, and
by special reemest lot others we re-
puiblish hame and trust that you will
each read it carefully and then help
all j-ou can to get the board of su
pervisor; to- have this drainage
done for it w ill. be of incalculable
benefit to the count'. There will be
thousand; of acres of . fine land re
claimd and fiom the report filed by
this government engineer it can be
done for ;aiout 12c an acre and this
being the case we sincerely hope that
you will give the matter your care
ful -consideration.
General Description.
During October anrd Nevcmber,
1906, a survey of the Black bayou
in Washington county, Missi, was
made under the direction of the irri
gation and drainage investigations,
at th olicitation of thecounty com
missioners and property owners, to
ascertain - what- improvement,- if --any
could be. made, in" the baj-ou to facili
tate the drainage of the large tract
of land lying between Deer Creek, on
the east .and .the Mississippi river le-
Ivee.ffli the. west. , I ,-. -
The area .f the basin is approxi
mately 187,060 acres and , receives
no drainage water except the natural
rainfall. Th cross section of the
valley shows "a fall of 10 feet from
Deer. Creek .westerly to the bayou, 5
feet of fhis beirrg found in the first
mile and a half.
The fall from the levee easterly to
the bayou is 5 feet and quite well
distributed. This general slope from
the creek and levee toward the .bayou
is deversified by alternate rise and
depression. which extend down the
valley parellel with the stream so
that the natural drainage passes
through threm to the smith and
reaches the bayou at various open
ings through its banks. The land lies
in troughs or ridges, not at all pro
nounced but strfficent to point out
quite clearly the plan that should be
followed in draining the valley.
The -crops grown at various points
in the valley indicate that'where the
land is sufficiently drained .cotton may
be produced- in ; great perfection. A
casual inspection of the territory- indi
cates that at one time a much larger
area was cultivated
the valley-
fields which appear to have Once been
cleared, but are now abandoned and
the ditches which were - made for
draining them are" overgrown with
briars. The production of thi fields
now -cultivated seems to be measur
ed by the drainage provided, tne
amount and perfection of the crOp
decreasing as the fields extend imo
the--wet land Rentals diminish in
the same proportion, much to the dis
couragement of both owners and ten
ants. The. channel of the bayou is
obstruction by logs and drift and alsof
. . '--, , t " 1- t i
by growing trees and bushes : which
have . chtoked. it at various points in
f such, a .manner as to limit its use for
! drainage to the removal of surplus
water in time of .floods.
The Sarvey.
The course of ahe bay-ou meander
ed and levels carefully taken from
the north line of Washington coun
ty to Swan Lake,' the ponts of its
outlet, a distance of "SS miles. . Most
of the bends are long, but some, es
pecially those-. found in the Tower four
miles are shOrt, - doubling back ' a:nd
forth in such a mamrer as to.t'orm
narrow ..neck s.""- ! Th ? f al of tlte
streani form the W'ashiuton : couofy
line to SWart Lake,. as determ'ned ty
the levels, is. 27 fcet or 6 inches per
lnile. ' The controlling factors ki the
..--.,.:... v- , - " -.- .- ,!;,
imse of the bayim for the drainage
j of the valley are iirst, the outlet -at j
Swan Lake, and second, the carry
ing capacity of the channel. The
channel should have a capacity suf
ficient to receive all flood water and
be deep enough to permit "its use as
an outlet for lateral drains, to com
pletely drain , the lands lying on ci
ther side. jDepth of main channel
is one of its essential parts for drain
ing alluvial lands.-The bayou should
be improved so that it will be not
less than 8 feet deep at any point
along its course and discharge free
ly into Swan Lake at that depth, in
order to afford: the capacity ami
depth required in the complete driin
age of the valley. The data ob
tained by the survey shows that the
high-water stage of Swan Lake will
prevent the free discharge of an S
foot channel such as has been de
scribed, 's"b the the available dis
charging level for waters of the val
ley will at all times be the surface
of Swan Lake. No examination has
yet been made of the lower . end-nt
the lake or of Steel's Bayou, its cut
let, Vo ascertain whether obstructions
may not be removed and the water
of the lake pedmanently lowered.
IMPROVEMENT OF CHANEL
The channel of the bayou may be
fmproved as follows: From the north
line Of ' Washington county to the
sjouth end of Fish Lake, a distance
of about 17 1-2 miles the percent
channel is sufficiently large, and
of about 17 1-2 miles, the -prehent
in good 'condition. The only exca
vation required for. this section will
be about 800 feet cut-off at the upper
end iof the lake. The channel below
the lak-e will require (enlarging at
some points and straightening by
cutting off bends and eleasving out
the chanel where it is obstructed.
Beginning at the outlet of Fish Lake,
the channel deepens sufficiently to
lower the grade line 4 feet. This can
be done by deepening the Original
(channel as far south as section
l7l-7, where the grade of the pres
ent channel will be intercepted. The
channel from. Fish Dake to the Red
Bridge near the center of section 32-
18-7 should have a bottom width of
67 feet and an available depth of S
feet. From this point-to Swan Lake
the present channel may be clean
ed! out and tlic large.;-bends found
in township 15-7 straightened, mak
ing the channel 98 feet wide to the
lake. The' cutting of 'bends as pro
posed will involve the construction of
4.6 miles of new channel and will
shorten the entire length of the bayou
13.4 (miles making the new channel
44.6 miles long, instead of 58, as it
now is. Owi.g to the high stage
which th surface of Swan Lake is
now held at times Of high water,
th)e depth specified for the channel
cantnot be 'made available for drain
age for the entire distance.
In discussing this feature of the
drainage we may divide the basin
into two sctions, the upper lying
above section 28-17-7 and compris
ing 130,000 acres, "and the lower
lying between! this line and Swan
Lake, having an area of 57,000 acres.
The improvement of the channel as
( specified will provide adeejuate outlet
drainage for the upper section and
partial drainage for the lower section.
Tt is probable that the present stage
of water will be lowered about 2 feet
by the construction of the ditch, ard
as the ater in Swan Lake recedes this
pedth will be increased adding very
much to . the effective drainage of
as the water in Swan Lake recedes
the depth will be increased a-'ding
very- (much to the effective" drainage
of the entire entire lower section.
The manner in which the ditch as
described will affect the two sec
tions, is shown by the accompanying
profile, which shows that a perman-ent
drainage can be obtained for the up
per section, and less certain drain
age, depending - upon the varying
. . , ,
for the lower sections. . It is proposed
to examine the lowqr part of Swan
Lake and Steel's Bayou to ascertain
if by removing some obstruction the I arc not "numerous. 1 he most serious
water imrt !. -lowered at least .(wreck happened near Shereiicss this
feet, which sluld be dome if thor
ough and permanent drainage is pro
vided for the entire basin above
Swan Lake.If this can be done,it will
permanently lower the water ' table
and furnish an outlet sufficient for
the discharge of such lateral ditches
as may 'be required to fit all of the
outlying lands for .cultivation.
Supplementary" lateral ditches
should be constructed parallel to the
cotvrse - of the bayou as indicated by
the character of the slop-i previously
described. The territory naturally
divides, itself into a few sub districts
which -should be Ireartcd as units.
