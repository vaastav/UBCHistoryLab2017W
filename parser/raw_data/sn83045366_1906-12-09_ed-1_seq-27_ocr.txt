BANKERS NOT SCARED
I BY THE MESSAGE
President Roosevelt Said Nothing
AlarmingA Tight Call
Loan Market.
Special to The Journal.
New York, Dee. 8.President Koose
velt 's message was not the big bugaboo
that Wall street expected and! people
down here breathed much easier after
they had digested the document. Of
course, some unfavorable things were
expected, but most of them had been
discounted. Therefore, it seems more
than probale that from the present out
look the street will be fairly free from
Washington scares during the winter.
The big bankers rejoice in the condition
of the money market, because they say
it puts the president under bonds to
keep the peace if he wants to sell any
Panama bonds, of which a big issue is
contemplated.
The moderation of the remarks rela
.tive to corporation control and the con
demnation of government ownership of
railroads did not suggest any desire of
the president to disturb unnecessarily
the confidence upon which the prevail
ing prosperity is based, so that stock
market circles were on the whole in
clined' to feel satisfied. Bu the money
situation has elements that even the
most optimistically inclined bankers do
not like. The report that the interstate
commerce commission is about to start
an investigation of the Harriman Pa
cific roads, with a view to determining
the legality of the alleged combination
under the -anti-trust law, had a more
or less disturbing effect upon Union
and Southern Pacific.
The situation is so big with possi
bilities of higher pices that the best
authorities on the stock market were
advising the purchase of stocks even
in the face of high money. I is well
understood that the money rate is
manipulated. No more than 8 per eent
of the call rate can be justified. Any
thing above that is due entirely to the
calling of loans from little men in or
der to funish 6 per cent money to big
men. The instant the insideis get ready
to make an active market the rate to
the little men will fall suddenly. There
is suspicion that the Nipissing affair
was a deliberately planned movement
to terrify the public on the curb and
drive them into the stock market. I
it really was, the game was ovei played,
for it hurt the inside market more
than it hurt mining stocks. I has raised
a suspicion that support may be sud
denly withdrawn from other issues than
Nipissing. I the present state of the
public mind the vicious attack on the
curb market only convinces the lambs
that it must be safer than the stock
exchange, or the bankers involved' in
the Nipissing affair would not be so
anxious to keep the public out of it.
The money market has unquestion
ably been manipulated to force Secre
tary Shaw to throw more funds into
Wall street, but the secretary obdu
rately refuses, and has now put the
onus on congress by recommending cer
tain legislation for relief. When money
ona call jumpesd tod20 per or
banker an brokercenkindlymore ad
vised their customers to drop a part
of their holdings and, of course, num
bers of them did! so rather than be
closed out entirely. The announcement
of an increase in the New York Central
quarterly dividends to 1% per cent,
raising the annual rate from 5 to 6 per
cent, was entirely without effect. Even
New York Central did not go up, but
it was very heavy under liquidating
Bales with the rest of the market. The
news had been fully discounted in the
previous rise of this stock.
H\ Great Northern beneficiary certifi
cates showed the difference between
anticipation and realization, developing
marked weakness, tho subsequently re
covering part of their loss.
i Thinking circles may well doubt the
advantage to Wall street of railroad
i magnates also interested in speculation
havi ng at their disposition such large
cash assets as the Union Pacific showed
in its report$57,000,000of which
$35,000,000 was out on call. Moreover,
thru the sale of Hill securities since
June 30 it is estimated that the amount
has been increased to nearly $100,000,-
000, a large portion of which, however,
has-doubtless been employed in carry
ing Baltimore & Ohio and other stocks

A sharp rise in Canadian Pacific was
generally credited to the Jefferson Levy
pool, being facilitated by an accumu
lated short interest. The floating sup
ply of this stock is small, lending itself
to manipulation by the pool.
James J. Hill and his associates are
said to be hard at work on the com
pletion of the plan which they have
had under way for the Great Northern
to buy Northern Pacific's equity in
the Burlington and to make extra dis
tribution on both Great Northern and
Northern Pacific stock. I is understood
that meetings of the directors of these
three companies are likely to be held
at any time in the near future.
While the movement of Amalgamated
Copper has been puzzling to the street
as a whole, men who are in touch with
tne most prominent interests in that
corporation are confident that the stock
nas been accumulated for some weeks
and, as soon as the general market
becomes more active, they look for the
copper group to be led by Amalgamated

CHICAGO LIVESTOCK
"International week" in the cattle
trade has not brought about any severe
disturbances in values. The market
since Monday has held on a fairly even
keel even' under liberal supplies, and
closed firm, giving fair indication of
liberal demand on all quarters. Ee
ceipts for the week total 87,400, com
paring with 45,503 a week ago and 92,-
483 a year ago.
Exporters and shippers have pur
chased liberally, especially the ship
ping interests, and this broad outlet to
wards the east has offered salesmen
ready demand for the fat classes. Me
dium ana plain to fair short-fed classes
have been in abundance thus far in the
week, but the fair call from packers
has given sellers opportunity to work
them off at fair prices.
In the International auction sale of
show steers, seventy-four carloads sold
at an average of $8.15, and the grand
championship of the show went at $17.
Cow stock has sold mostly 10c lower
than last week, general demand in
later days being slow. Packers were
fair buyers of good cows and heifers,
but the medium classes have gone slow
ly. Some fancy heifers sold up to
$5.35 during the week, but there were
few sales above $4.75. Canners and
cutters have suffered largely. 10c de
cline from last week's prices, in sympa
thy with the beef cow stock. Most
of the cutters sold at $2.40(2)2.65, while
bulk of canning cows at $1.85@2.25.
This has been a good week for the
producers of hogs. Prices have grad
ually .worked to a higher lev el and the
average cost of $6.30 stood 12c above
one week ago and $1.37 higher than
one year ago. Packers have been
freer buyers than usual and the ship
ping buyers have given the market bet
ter support. There was an improve
ment in the quality of the offerings,
choice butchers making up a larger por
tion of the receipts than for some time,
while there was a sharp fallling off in
the marketing of the commoner mixed
and the heavy packers. The spread in
prices between the commoner and best
hogs is narrower, only a very poor
class of heavy packers going under
$6.15 at this time, while fancy butchers
go up to $6.50.
handy-weight yearlingis sold at $6.75
only the plaino lots

Features of Importance in the East and WestTips the TradersTake from the Ticker-
Gossip of the Men Who Make the Markets Move.
CHICAGO BACKS DOWN
A month has passed since the Chi
cago board of trade turned down, after
the second agitation, the proposition
for the repeal of the %-cent commis
sion rule. Thru this period the board
has not prospered. The original work
ers for reform were still at it and had
never despaired of carrying their point
finally. Hence when the news came this
week that the board, by a decisive vote,
had returned to the old rate of charges
for seviee, it was only the thing ex
pected. This is the finish of the effort
of Chicago, probably the last that mar
ket will ever make, to dictate to the
world. I has ended in failure.
It was a simple, proposition. Chi
cago, from loss of business, was not
producing the revenue of former years.
Its_ grain commission firms were com
plaining. Their earnings were decreas
ing. Along came a genius with a plan
to double the charge for doing business.
It was as easy as addition. Chicago
had lost about half her business, but
she would double up on charges for
doing it and so her average would be
the same as of old. The fact that Min
neapolis had decided to continue doing
business at the old rates of cent
was pointed out, and the prediction was
here made that Chicago would fail.
But in that city such a suggestion was
laughed to scorn. Chicago had always
dictated and it was not to be presumed
that any other markets would dare hold
out. THey would be Whipped into line
in short order. Jhig was the basis
Chicago went on.
It must have been humiliating te th
members to have to acknowledge
they could not make it go tha4ard-e

tige of Minneapolis had risen to that

MINNEAPOLIS PRODUCE
Creamery butter of the top grade is
.lobbing at nearly 10 cents per lb higher
than a year ago. Best posted men in
the trade have not as yet explained
why this should be, not even hazard
ing the guess that it may be due to a
trust or combination, or to any other
influence than the fact that people
have the money to buy and are not
watching values as closely as they do
When money is scarce. Certainly re
ceipts have not been noticeably lighter,
and the quality does not average any
higher. Everything suitable for table
use finds a ready market. Heavy with
drawals of storage goods have been the
rule, and present holdings of June
goods are much lighter than usual at
this season of the year. Buyers of low
grade butter for ladling and renovat
ing purposes have been looking for
stock all the week, and have forced
paying prices up a notch. Rolls and
prints are popular, and bring a pre
mium over last week 's prices.
The e^g market continues its upward
tendency. Fresh arrivals are now sell
ing at $8.25 per case, a good advance
oyer last week. About the same condi
tions prevail in eggs as in butter, so
far as keeping sold out is concerned.
The demand holds up fully equal to or
possibly exceeding the supply, which
has allowed the forcing up of prices.
Cooler stock has not perceptibly cut
into the outlet for fresh, notwithstand
ing the difference in price. People still
continue to crave a fresh-laid egg for
breakfast in the morning," and the
price cuts no figure. Grocers report a
larger movement than usual for the
season of the year. Much more of an
advance would likely narrow the out
let, and most receivers are looking for
almost any turn to the market. While
we do not predict a decline with the
present weather prevailing, we would
advise prompt shipments in order to
Z!\ JT"-
f~!A
get the advantage of present range in
prices.
A stronger turn is shown to the poul
try market. Nearly all lines show
more or less of an advance, now that
people are again buying in usual form.
The market has been draggy since
Thanksgiving, owing to the heavy ac
cumulation developing at that time,
which receivers have had to work off
to the best advantage possible. Nice
fresh stock is what is now wanted, and
a good call will exist for all lines ex
cept turkeys next week. Following
that, turkey will be kdng, and the chief
attention of butchers will go to that
line. A usual, early shipments of good
stock will bring the best prices. Figure
on getting stock here not later than
Thursday, Dee. 20, if you want out
side values for your shipments. Many
receivers express the opinion that about
the same prices will rule for Christmas
as at Thanksgiving. Hold back the
chickens, and market them in January
and February.
Receipts of new cheese are moder
ate, and the market holds to a firm
basis. Demand is active and storage
goods are being freely drawn on to sup
ply the trade.
Dressed meats are firm, with advanc
ing figures shown on hogs and veal.
Rabbits are coming in freely, and good
stock goes out readily. Shipments
should be packed in boxes, and rabbits
laid out straight. Stock shipned in
bags arriving frozen and out of shape,
will not bring carrying charges.
An active Christmas week is looked
for, but the week just closing was a
quiet one for fruit shippers. N price
changes are shown f3 the week. There
are ample offerings of all lines quoted,
including a fine assortment of trees,
holly, evergreen wreathing, and other
decorations for Christmas use.
SOUTH ST. PAUL LIVESTOCK
The supply of cattle as compared
with recent weeks was light, the west
ern run having dropped off to small
proportions. Offerings nere were mostly
of native cattle, and some showing of
western stuff was,-included. Prices
were steady thruout the week, the mar
ket holding up here in the fa~e of a
break in the east on Monday, owing to
a light local run. Quality has been just
medium with a few lots of good grassy
steers from the west. Grain-fed cattle
have been scarce, and demand is very
strong for that kind. Veal calves
steady for the week and bulls un
changed.
The stocker and feeder trade has
been in good condition and the decline
of the preceding week was about re
gained. The supply was moderate and
demand good. Offerings were mostly of
the stocker type, tho there was a fair
showing of feeders. Stockers were 15c
to 25c higher than at last week's low
time, and, the movement was brisk at
the advance on most days during the
week. Feeders had a strong tone, hold
ing well up with the preceding v?eks.
There was not much of a showing of
toppy feeders.
The supply of hogs has been of good
size this week, and the market active.
Demand was strong and quality gen
erally good. The market nad an up
ward trend and substantial gains were
made the first two days. On Monday
there was an advance of a dime, ana on
Tuesday another dime was added. On
the two following days prices were
steady to strong at the early advance
The range continued rather narrow.
Sheep receipts have been very lib
eral this week, the run consisting prin
cipally of western stuff going thru. A
considerable share of the westerns were
of the feeder grades, and some of those
changed hands here. The killing supply
was medium, and mostly native.

Secretary Shaw said yesterday

Watson from New York.It is stat

will deposit $30,000,000 'in banks on

F. Frazier, Chicago.While the
foreigners do not respond to our

have to have our wheat, and that
wheat is a purchase on every soft spot.
W look for larger receipts of corn and

W. C. Sunderland, Omaha, to C.
Lewis.The movement of wheat in the
winter wheat country is about over and
everybody wants to buy wheat down
here. I would take a book to tell all
the bullish arguments that are real
facts. I am very bullish on wheat.
C. G. Gates says: "The stock mar
ket will depend on the possible relief
by Shaw. Think it is coming and if
market is weak would buy stocks.
Washington wires: 'Hear Shaw's move
will be either $30,000,000 cash or the
refunding of $30,000,000 old govern
ment fours and that it will be before
Monday.'
Whallon, from New York.It is ru
mored specialty circles that Colorado
Fuel is on the verge of a rise. Earn
ings of the company are said to be
main basis for improvement. Duluth
South Shore is being tipppea for ad
vance. I is being handled by the
Canadian crowd which is bullish on the
market, and is operating with funds ob
tained at a low rate. They handle
stocks that are scarce and can easily
manipulate them.
F. R. Babcock, Chicago, to Pipert
I advise the utmost conservatism un
til the money market gets in better
shape. The money situation is strained
everywhere. Any relief Shaw can af
ford will be only temporary. Legisla
tion is the only form of permanent re
lief in sight, and this is a lone way
off. Prosperity continues, but the dif
ference between the situation today
and a year ago is that no manipula
tor, however powerful, would dare un
dertake a bull movement in the face
of present money conditions here and
abroad. Would sell stocks on all ral
lies and be prepared to buy stocks
when the money situation rights itself.'
New York to Watson: "The well
grounded belief that Secretary Shaw
will shortly come to the rescue of the
money market with further re
lief measures has imparted con
fidence in the market that has
not been present for several days.
Then the lack of the liquidating offer
ings which have re-ently been such a
feature in the trading, has given the
bull party more confidence. The situ
ation, however, is by no means clear,
a fact that will in all likelihood be
brought closely home by the bank
statement, which shows a considerable
deficit in the surplus reserves."
