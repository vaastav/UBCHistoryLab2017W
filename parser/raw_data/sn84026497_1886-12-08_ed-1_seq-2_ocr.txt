WCDHSDAl JIORSIM;, DEC. 8, 1S86. ,
THE MESSAGE.
The second session of the Forty
ninth Oongrecs began on Monday at
2 o'clock p. m. The reading of the
President's message was about all the
business transacted. The Pittsburgh
Com.-Gazette thus suras up that docu
ment :
The second annual message of Pres
ident Cleveland is so much like the
first that it must be accepted as a dec
laration on the part of the Adminis
tration that th policy outlined at the
beginning, however it may strike Con
gress and the country, is going to be
adhered to. In the discussion of our
foreign relations there is an optimistic
vein which bespeaks the confidence of
Secretary Bayard in the ability of the
State Department to settle all existing
difficulties through the peaceful chan
nels of diplomacy.
As regards the Fisheries question,
the President confesses that although
disappointed in bis efforts to secure a
settlement, by reason of the adverse
action of the Senate, nogotiationa are
still pending with reasonable hope
that an acceptable conclusion will be
reached before the close of the present
cession of Congress.
.. Mexican affairs are represented to
fee of a very pleasant and satisfactory
character. The unexecuted reciproci
ty treaty of 1883 is again referred to,
and the President makes known his
intentions to enter upon negotiations
with Mexico for a new and enlarged
treaty of commerce and navigation.
The position of the Administration as
respects the Cutting incident is stated
from the standpoint of Mr. Bayard,
and the declaration is made that the
admission of the claim of jurisdiction
over American citizens set up by the
Mexican Court wouU be evasive of
the jurisdiction of this Government
and highly dangerous to our citizens.
For this reason the principle is denied,
and it is hoped that in the interest of
good neighborhood the Mexican statue
will be modified so as to avoid conflict
between the two countries.
The tariff question is discussed in
much the same vein as it was a year
ago. The revenues must be reduced
so as to correspond with the future
wants of the Government, and the
way to accomplish that is to reduce
the tariff. The President proceeds up
on the free-trade theory that the peo
ple are being unduly taxed by the
tariff; that the workingmen and farm
ers re not getting their share of pro
tection, and that the time has come
for "revenue reform." Manufacturers
are given to understand that they have
been receiving the lion's share and
that tbey must hereafter get cn with
out relying upon the "leading strings"
of protection. Thd problem which is
thus presented to Congress is bow to
reduce the tariff without injuring bus
iness, lessening the volume of work or
reducing the wages paid to labor.
In referring to the rebuilding of the
navy, the hope is expressed that the
Government will nut be compelled to
go abroad to purchase armor-plates or
aleel for guns. It is intimated that
this course may be forced upon the
Secretary of the Navy, aud to obviate
it a suggestion is throwu out that the
army and navy, by uniting their con
tracts, might offer such inducements
as would result in securing the domes
licauou ot these important interests.
There is a gleam of hope that the
foreign mail service may be stimulated
by Government assistance above mere
compensation for carrying the mails.
It is recommended that lines be estab
lished to the Argeutine Republic and
to Brazil, with a view to extending
our relations and increasing trade with
those countries. It does not matter
much whether the assistance is called
"subsidy" or "legitimate compensa
tion," so that the object sought is ac
complUhed.
PassiDg over questions relating to
public laudi, railroads, the treatment
of the Indians, and other matters, wo
come to the labor problem, in the
discussion o. which the President re
news bis recommendation for the
arbitration of such disputes as result
in the interruption of commerce
between the States. The conclusion
is leached, however, that legislation,
either Federal or State, will not be
sufficient to Bolve the problem, and
that telief must touie through a
J. E. WK.NK,
mutual recognition to the rights and
obligations pertaining to ench cl3.
Tbe paragraph devoted to civil
service reform is a renewal of the
President's faith in the underlying
principle which he has undertaken to
assert and defend, and, with all faults
and imperfections which the system
has developed, he clings to it as "the
surest guarantee of the safety and
success of American institutions." He
nvokes for tbe reform tbe cheerful
and ungiudgiug support of Congress,
and gives them an opportunity to
show their good will by passing tbe
law increasinghe salaries of tbe Civil
Service Commission. There is no
comfort in this for those Democrats
who have jumped to the conclusion
that the President's action in the
Benton Stone cases had landed him
squarely in the camp of the spoilsmen,
while the Mugwumps will be left to
reconcile his professions with his
practice as best they may.
Chairman Hensel has again been
discovered. He is backing Peter
Gray Meek, of Bellefonte, for a Bank
Examinership. Hensel is generally
luckier at Washington than in Penn
sylvania. Dallas Sanders, who is proposed
as Hensel's successor, is called a dude
by the Harrisburg Patriot, and it says
furthermore that be lives on n fashiuu
able street in Philadelphia and wears
a claw hammer coat. Just think of
the Democratic chairman clad in such
a uniform to receive a delegation of
Jacksonian Democrats. Clearfield'
Journal.
Speaker Carlisle regards the con
test of bis seat in the next Cougress as
simply the effort of enemies to embar
rass him in his prospects for the Speak
ership. But, if Speaker Carlisle is a
fair man, be should allow the cVntest
the widest latitude. A man of bis
standing cannot afford to take a seat
on which there is the least intimation
of fraud. Let the light in.
A Washington correspondent prom
ises that Congress will investigate tbe
Cutting and Sedgwick episodes, togeth
er with numerous other matters on
which the pnolic demands more light.
Congress is evidently in for fun during
its first session, if the promise of this
correspondent baa any foundation.
While the body has under considera
tion the two subjects mentioned, it
might as well take cognizance of Min
ister Manuiog's case also, and make a
clean sweep of the Mexican, scandals.
There is no use of making fish of one
and flesh of another.
The Lancaster Intelligencer has a
way of lettiug tbe President out of his
trouble in tbe Stone and Benton cases.
While the President and Benton disa
gree on about all public questions, it
says they are both Democrats, and
that is enough. As the President
himself made the usue of loyalty to
the Administration, and as Benton at
tacked with the most brutal frankness
about everything the Administration
has ever done, anybody would suppo.e
that the fact that Benton is a Demo
crat would be merely an aggravation
The President could naturally expect
and endure without complaint criti
cism from his political opponents, but
when a Democrat, and an office-holder
of his own naming, stands up in pub
lie and talks about the President's
civil service humbuggery and charges
that be gets his financial ideas from
the money sharks and gold bugs of
all Street it must naturally make
am feel rather uncomfortable. On
the other baud, Colonel Stone said
nothing about the President, in his
speechos. He talked of the tariff,
about which the Administration majr
or may not have a policy, and of pro
hibition, which mav have been offen
sive to tbe President. Fhila. JVwa.
