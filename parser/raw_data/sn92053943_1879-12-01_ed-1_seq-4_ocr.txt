Dr. Schbjick's Prrucoiac Stbttp, tinlike all
other Coueh, Cold and Consumption remedies,
contaixs no opiua or other narcotic. It does not
dry up a cough or increase the inflammation, as
these preparations are almost sure to do. Dr.
Schenck's Pulmonic Syrop loosens the phlegm and
corrupt matter In the lungs and assists nature to
expel the disease from the system. Its healing and

Pear Sir I feel that I am doing good to others
by telling yon what your medicines have done for

years, and after trying many remedies and employ
ing the best physiciars in this city, without benefit,
I v as induced to use your medicines. I had hard
ly taken tho first bottle before I felt much better,
and after continuing their use for some time was
nntiroiv mi-art This wan over six vears ago. and

feel that my cure is permanent. I am happy to

of your medicines I know many others in New

Dear Sir I deem it my duty to you and to all
who may be suffering with that awful disease,-Con-suinption,
to write to you of the change for the
belter that has been made in my wife' condition
by you and your great medicine. On August 2!th,
187$, my wife was taken down with Consumptior
I called in one of the best doctors in this country.
He attended her as faithfully as a maneouid, doing
everything in his power, but she got werse every
day. In October I called another doctor. They
both said she could not possibly live, for she had
Consumption, and that her lungs were nearly gone.
She was at this time the most pitiful object any
person had ever seen, a perfect skeleton, cough
in; and spitting large quantities of matter.
I tried all kinds of patent medicines that were
said to cure Consumption, but nothing did her any
srood.
On the first of October. tha doctors and all her
friends gave her np It was their opionin that
she could not live five davs longer By chance I
gofone of your books describing many similar
cases and their cure, and on the 6th of November l
wrote to yon, describing her case You wrote me
to give my wife your medicines according to the
printed directions and jou thought she could be
cured, i at once Dougnt some oi your
PULMONIC SYEUP. SEAWEED
TONIC and MANDEAZE PILLS,
and gave them to her. She began to improve at
ouce, although the doctors and her friends said I
was throwing mj money away.
In a few riava she eat so she conld lav down and
s'ecp, a thing she had not been able to do since she
v as first taken sick, her appetite imp oved, and I
never saw such a wonderful change; every ooay
who saw her was astonished, for the like had never
been seen in thit country.
On the 83d of January you came and exa-nined
her lungs with your Respirometor,you pronounc
ed her right lung nearly gone, and the left badly
aiected (the same thing her former physicians haC
said,) but you said she was improving as fast as
possible.
About the first of June she commenced attending
to her household duties, and has continued to do
s.) ever since, doing all her own cooking and sew
ing for herself and her five children, and to-day
she look-s better than she has for ten year.
My wife's case iis looked on by the many who
saw her as the most wonderfu' cure that has ever
besn made in the State of Virginia; it was like
raising the dead. Some of the meuieines yon sent
me 1 have sold, and they have never failed in giving
entire satisfaction inhere Is a gr-at deal of the med
icine sold in this vicinity now, and has made other
cures almost as wonderful as that of my wife.
My purpose is thus writing to you is to benefit
others who may be suffering from that dreadful
iliseaso. Consumption, and 1 will cheerfully answer
nil inquiries that may be made of me whether by
l orrespondence or personally, and I can refer to
thirty or fortv persons of the highest standing
in this community who will vouch for all that X

Dr. SCHEME'S MaNDSAEE PILLS
Do not produce sickness at the Btomach, nausea
or griping. On the contrary, they are so mild and
agreeable in their action that a person Buffering
with sick headache, sour stomach, or pain iuthe
l)Dwcla, is speedily relieved of these distressing
symptoms. They act directly on the liver, the
organ wh'ch, when in a healthy condition, purifies
t he blood of the whole body.
They are a perfect preparation of that great and
well-known remedy, Mandrake or Podophyllin, a
remedy that oas displaced the use of mercury, as
well as many other poisonous drugs, in the practice
cf every intelligent physician.
Prof. John King, of the College of Medicine, of
Cincinnati, says : '"In Constipation it acts npon
the bowels without disposing them to subsequent
costiveness. In Chronic Liver Complaint there is
not its equal in the whole range of mediclnee.being
vastly more useful than mercurial agents, arousing
the liver to healthy action, increasing the flow
of bile, and keeping up these actions longer than
any other agent with which we are acquainted."

event which our citizens will do wtjl to

Enterprise.
The Argus to-day presents its readers
with the president's message the same day
of its delivery in congress, something which
has never before done tc this vicinity.
The Argus is enabled to do ihU owinc to
the perfect telegraphic arrangements, by
which it was transmitted twenty i ,
hours in advance of its delivery in ccn
gress. This is the first time that the
president's message has been printed and
sent out in newspapers ou the suae day of
its reading in congress. We trust that
our subscribers will appreciate the efforts
we have made to give them tho news in
advance. It is our intention to keep up
with the times in all things and to do so,
respectfully solicit the patronage of busi

Painful Accident.
A very painful accident occurred at 2
o'clock Sanday morning, at Briar Biuff, on
the C, B. & Q Railroad, the victim being
a young man by the name of llines, a
brakeman on Conductor Barter's train.
The train was coming north, and had
stopped to do some switching, and Dines
was told to pull a pin on a car and juaip
on the head car and "down brakes." Lie
pulled the pin all right and made a jump
for the car but missed his footing and fell
just outside the track, his arm laying
across the track and four cars passed over
it, taking it off just below the shoulder.
lie was put on the train and brought to
Rock Island and taken to the Taylor
House. Mr. M. D. Merrili was sent for'
and summoned Drs. Truesdale and Garter'
who dressed the wounded man's arm. He
is a new hand on the road, this being only
his fifth trip. Mr. Merrill has him well
cared for, and he will -no doubt make a
speedy recovery.
The Glee Club.
We hear it rumored, but not yet con- j
firmed, that the Fourteenth Battalion Glee
Club intend giving an entertainment in
Harper's Theatre before long. The pro
gramme, as we are informed, will embrace
some of the test local talent io this city
and Moiine, some txcalient instrumental
music, and selections of readings by our
young elocutionist, Mr. Herbert Noarse.
We are also informed that Mr. Harper
ha3 agreed to let the Glee Club have the
theatre for $50, and good instrumental
music nil! cost about $30 more, making
$80 in all. They thick if they would put
the price of admission down to 25 cents for
every eeat in the house, they could get a
large audience.
We hope the club will make up their
minds to do this. The people of this city
ought to turn out and give them a rousing
big house, as they deserve it. They have
sang for almost every entertainment that
has been given and never asked or received
a cent for their aer vices, and if they con
clude to give this concert" they should be
patronized liberally.

The Message
To-day, the annual message of the
president was presented to conaress, and
is a document of coniderabletlength, but
contains nothing very , new or original.
The president takes strong ground on the
enrrency question, favoring the withdraw
al and cancellation of the legal tenders and a
limited coinage of silver dollars in other
words he fayors a single gold standard.
He also refers to the issues raised at the late
session and repeats his views substantially
the same as then. He refers to our de
creased shipping interests and urges con
gress to take such action as will lead to a
reaction.in our favor but makes no sug
gestions as to how it is to be done. The
Indian question is touched upon lightly
and there is a. coincidence with
Secretary Schurz's views which
shows that he is in sympathy with the
present peace policy of the gov
ernment. There is very little of especial
prominence outside the currency question
his views on that question being even
more pronounced than at the time of the
celebrated silver bill veto.
Mr. Hayes voices the sentiments of his
party and of coflrse clearly indicates what
the people ere to expect from a continua
tion of Republican rule. We will notice
tho message in detail, at another time.
From a hasty perusal, there is ground for
classing the message as a decidedly weak
state paper eminently characteristic of
the man who inspired it, however.
Employment for Idle Labor,
To-night the council ;meet in regular
session, and it is to be hoped that there
will be some action taken on the suggestion
of The Argus to provide employment
during the winter for idle labor. The city
can, if it will, furnish work for hundreds of
men in this city, give them at least work
enough to i keep them independent o
charity and above want, lloek can be
quarried and kept for.macadan to be used
in the spring. The rock can be got out in
quantity sufficient to pay for the labor, and
at the same time the city will be getting a
supply of macadam ahead for street work
in the spring. This is a mere suggestion,
of course, to the council, I ut it is a questiou
which, if acted upon will do -a good work
for the laboring men of Rock Island, with
really no increase of expenses.
Good Words.
To-day, S. R. Porter, who for six jears
has been tieasurtr oi Rock Island county,
retires from the position which he has so
al ly and acceptably filled. It is pleasant
to note the kiud words of his political
opponents and the following from the
Davenport Gazette is worth copying. We
have endorsed every word of it aod think
that everybody will agree with U9 in saying
that Samuel R. Porter, was one of the
very best county officers ever elected.
Following is the item from the Gazette:
Mr. S. R. Porter to-day retires from the
office of county treasurer, which he has
held for the last six years, being twice re
elected to that ofSce. He first announced
himself as an independent candidate for
the ofSce, and repeated the same announce
ment at the end of his first and second
terms. He was a good soldier when his
services w.-re required, and a good officer
when he was called to that place. His
wurst enemy, if he is lucky enough to have
one, can't point to a single dollar that
hasn't been tppropriatcd or paid just
where it belongs. Mr. Porter will now
give his attention to his large coal interest
which will occupy all his ticue.

DR. JOHXT BULL'S
SiTH'S TQHIC SYRUP,
FOR THE CURE OF 1
FEVER AND AGUE
Or CHILLS AND FEVER.
The proprietor of this celebrated medicine justl
claims for it a superiority over all remedies evei
oflered to the public for the SAFE, CERTAIN.
SPEEDY, and PERMANENT rure of Auue and
Fever, or Chili and Fever, whether cf i-hort 01
long standing. He refer to tho entire Western
end Southern country to bear him testimony to the
truth of the aenertion that iu no case whatever will
t fail to cure if the directions are strii tly followed
and carried out. In a preat many cases a single
dose has bjeu sumciciit for a cure, and whole lam
llies have been cured by a single bottle, with a
perfect restoraiion cf the peut ral health. It is,
however, prudent, and in every cane more certain
to cure if its use is continned in smaller dxses for
a week after the disease has been checked, more
especially in difficult and long-standing cases
Usually this medicine will not require any aid to
keep the bowels in pood order. Should the pa
tient, however, require a cathar tic medicine, after
having taken three or four Onses of the Tonic, a
single dose of BULL'S VEGETABLE FAMILY
PILLS will be scftlclent.
The t'enoine SMITH'S TONIC SYRUP must
have DR. JOHN BULL'S private stamp on each
bottle. Dlt. JOHM HULL onlv has the riirht to
manufacture and sell the original JOHN J.
SMITH'S TONIC SYRUP, of Louisville, Ky. Ex
amine well the label on each bottle. If my private
stamp is not on each bJtile, do not purchase, or
you will be deceived.
