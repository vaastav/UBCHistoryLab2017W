Postmaster General Frank H.
Hitchcock's Annual Report
Contains Interesting . Data
Regarding Postal Business,
jBr Morniiif Journal Special I:itd Win.)
Washington. Dec. 10. For the first
time since the Annual financial
itutf nit'iit of the postoffiee depart
ment shows a surplus instead of a
dclikit, according to the annual re
port of Postmaster General Frank H.
Hiichcoek. made public today The
postmaster general's report follows In
part:
-The revenues for the fiscal year
f ruled J'1"'1 30, IS 11. amounted to
j;377!t,s-3.60 and the expenditures
td J23T'iO,T05.4!, leavlnK a surplus
of j;i!. 1 1X.12. At the beKlnninK of
the present administration In 1H09 the
nostul Fervli-e was in arrears to thu
relent of S 1 7.4 7 .77 0.4 7. which was
ilecitledly the largest deficit on record.
In the I rief space of tw o years this
dclii'H has been changed into a sub
stantial surplus.
The wiping out of the deficit has
l,,(.n accomplished without curtail
ment of postal facilities. On the con
trary, important extensions have been
made In every brunch of the service.
Since the opening of the present ad
ministration there have been estab
lished 3,744 new poBtoffices, delivery
by carrier hits been provided in 1X6
additional cities, and 2.516 new rural
routes, aggregating- 60,67 9 miles, have
Wen authorized. Meanwhile the force
of postal employes has been Increased
by more than 8,000. In compensating
inn employes the department fol
lows a liberal policy. Last year the
tutiil amount expended for salaries
was approximately 114,000,000 great
er than two years ago. The average
annual salary has been Increased
from ?69 to $967 for rural carriers,
from $U7 to $1,082 for postoffiee
clerks, front $1,021 to $1,084 for city
Utter carriers, and from $1,168 to
$1,1 S3 for railway postal clerks. Thus
a marked extension of the postal ser
vice and higher compensation for Its
employes have gone hand in hand
with a vanishing deficit.
Postal Savings System.
"An Important event of the year
was the successful organization of the
postal savings system. On January
S, 1911, depositories were opened ex
perimentally at a single postofflce in
em li one of the 4 8 states and terri
tories. After a careful test for four
months at these offices the system
was rapidly extended and now com
prises practically all of the 7,500
presidential post offices, : Prepara
tions uro being made to establish the
yitcm also In about 40,000 fourth-
class offices that do a money order
business.
"In the establishment of depositories
only such posloffioes are selected as
have a record for efficient manage
ment. This plan has materially aided
the department in its efforts to Im
prove conditions in the postal ser
vice. I-MablMinieiit of a Parcel's Post.
".Now that the successful operation
of the postal savings system Is as
sured, it Is hoped that congress will
promptly authorize the establishment
of a parcels post. The benefits of tb's
service are widely enjoyed by the
people of foreign countries and should
be provided in the Vnited States. The
department not only renews its rec
ommendation of last year for legisla
tive authority to start a parcels post
on rural routes, but asks a similar au
thorization for the Introduction of
such a service In cltlea and towns
having delivery by carrier. After
the organization of a parcels post on
rural route and in the city delivery
tervlee is completed, its extension to
Include railway and other transpor
tation lines vcan be more readily ac
complished without impeding the
handling of the ordinary mall. I
1 U'tiJ list men t of Postage Itate.
".Next to the question of establish
ing a parcels post, the most Import
ant postal problem to be considered
by congress at this session will be
that of readjusting postage rates. In
the last two annual reports of the de
partment attention wis directed to
the great loss sustained In handling
second-class mail at the present low
rate of 1 cent a pound. I a view of
the great profit accruing, on the oth
er hand, from first-class mail it was
pointed out that a readjustment of
rates on the basis of cost would event
ually permit the adoption of 1 cent
postage for letters.
Hallway Mall Service Kcorjiinlzrxl.
"'Following the imiuiry Into the
cost of transporting mail on the rail
roads the department started a thor
ough Investigation of the railway mail
service. In certain branches of that
servi-e most unsatisfactory conditions
were disclosed as the result of ineffi
cient management. It was found
that In some divisions tho chief clerks
had not inspected their lines for sev
eral years. Kmployces on certain
lines were compelled to work excep
tionally long hours, while In other
parts of the service a sufficient period
of train duty was not required. In
many instances the s:initury condi
tion of tho cars had been neglected
and the health of the employes thus
Jeopardized. The reports of the In
spectors who made the Investigation
showed that the government had been
paying large sums for car space that
was not properly utilized, indicating
a lack of proper supervision on the
part of the officers of the service.
Owing to the conditions disclosed by
the Investigation a thorough reorgani
sation of the railway mail service has
been undertaken. This reorganiza
tion, although not completed, has
gone far enough to bring about a de
cided improvement over the unsatis
factory conditions reported..
Aeroplane Mail Service.
"The lirst aerial dispatch of United
States mail occurred in September
last, when 43,000 pieces were carried
from Aeroplane Postal Station No. 1
on Nassau Doulevard to Mlneola,
Long Island, The progress being
made In the science of aviation en
courages the hope that ultimately the
regular conveyance of mall by this
means may be practicable. Such a
service, If found feasible, misht be es
tablished in many districts where the
natural conditions preclude other
means of rapid transportation.
Pensions l or Aeol FmploycB,
"Almost without exception, foreign
nations provide for the pensioning of
civil service employees when they be
come superannuated, ltrge corpora
tions in same principle In the retire
ment of their aged employes. On
business grounds, if for no other rea
son, the government should do like
wise. " While the compensation tit posts!
employes has been considerably in
creased during the ljst tew years it
is hardly more than sufficient to meet
nectssary living expenses and vonse
Hiuntly does not permit the putting
vsnle of any considerable savings
this country are rapidly adopting the
agair.st old age. It is believed that a
civil pension based on length of em
ployment should be granted by the
Rovernnieiit! Benefits to the service
far outweighing the expense of such
pensions would undoubtedly result."
Assistant Pivliiinters t'lu -sifted.
in accordance with tlie plan an-1
noutued In the last annual report as
sistant postmasters have been recom- i
mended to the Civil S rvlce commis
sion for rlnsvlticatlon es rapidly as It
was possible to ascertain ly careful
: investigation tluir qiuiliflcutlons for
efficient service. The effect of classi
fication has been to stimulate these
officers in the performance of their
duties, and their greater efficiency has
had a marked effect on the conduct of
the postal service. The fact that clas
sified employes In the lower grade
are now eligible for promotion to the
position of assistant postmaster has
rendered their employment more at
tractive, the result being a higher
class of competitors In the examina
tions for posiofflce clerks and letter
curriers.
liiidciitiul Postmasters CU-.iltod.
"The considerations that led to the
classification of the position of assist
ant postmaster 111 presidential post
oft ices a.iply with equal force to the
postmastershlp Itself. A full measure
of efficiency In the conduct of the
postal service can not be expected so
loin as the postmasters are subject to
political control. The success that has
attended the policy of reappointing
competent postmasters shows th ad
vantage of retaining the management
of the service in experienced hands.
In keeping with this policy the depart
ment last year recommended the clas
sification of presidential postmasters
anil that recommendation is now ear
nestly repented.
I'laiululcnt I so ot MaiU.
"The department's crusade against
the fraudulent use of the mails, be
gun In 1910, has been aggressively
continued. Last year the inspectors
assigned to this work Investigated a
great variety of cases ranging from
petty schemes for the commitment of
fraud on a small scale to gigantic proj
ects involving tho sale of worthless
stocks In imaginary mining companies
and other tlovftfev.-VVo'iiocrns. There
were altogether 529 Indictments, and
in these cases 184 convictions have
been already secured, with but 12
acquittals. .Most of the pending cases
will come to trial during the current
fiscal year. Thu swindlers thus In
dicted had fraudulently obtained from
the public many millions of dollars.
Iteports from the large cities indicate
that numerous concerns utilizing the
mails In a questionable manner have
gone out of business us the result of
the department's vigorous crusade.
The publicity given the prosecutions
through the daily press all over the
country has been of great value In
preventing Innocent persons from be
ing defrauded.
"Many Inspectors have been em
ployed solely In the Investigation of
cases Involving the fraudulent use of
tho malls unil thus their attention has
be n diverted from the important
work of s rutinlzing the routine op
erations Of the postal service. It is
believed that the handling of all such
fraud cases should be asrigne,! to the J
agents of the Ueparunen. justice,
thus relieving the postoft'L.v inspectors
f a responsibility, 'he discharge of
whiih seriously interferes with their
U-U,ll ciutits."

R. 0. Yoakum, St, Louis Finan
citr, Visiting City, Predicts
Great Things for New State.
"I have great faith In the agricul
tural future of New Mexico," said K.
1. "Yoakum, of St. I.otils, last evening
at the Alv.-tmdo hotel. Mr. V oakum
bad just arrived from St. Louis oxer
the Helen eut-eff, en route to the.
Pacific coast.
Mr. Yoakum, like his distinguikb-d
brother, 1!. p. Yoakum, chairman of
the board of directors of the Kok
Island lines, is a great believer in ag
riculture, and although a financier
with a home in St. Louis, he has l.ooa
acres of alflafa near Pcrtales, In
Roosevelt county.
"There is no question but that with
the grunting ol statehood to New
Mexico its Wonderful resources will
be developed. ! believe there Is some
of the richest alfalfa land In the world
in New .Mexico, and there is no ques
tion that a large portion of New Mexi
co Is fortunate in having water in im
mense quantities near the surface and
easily within reach of the power of
small engines used to operate pumps.
"It can thus lie seen that irriga
tion hy pumping will have ft great
deal to do with the future of New
Mexico."
Among his other Interests Mr Yoak
um Is vice president of the tjuaimh,
Alius and Pacific railway, having
about fifty miles of line built out ot
Altus, Texas, and a projected railroad
to the southwest. It was not the
r pinion of .Mr. Yoakum, however, that
any lare uinount of work would he
done on these projects immediately.
"The railwas of the country are not
lushing Into new territory us they
once did, preferring to let the country
largely support the Hue an It is built,"
was hl comment.
"It is very easy to project a rail
road," he said, "and ordinarily a road
inn be graded on the bonuses that
n ro raised from the towns through
which It will pass, but when It cornea
to going into the markets and getting
sure enough steel for the lilies, that
is another question, und therein lies
the difficulty that many promoter.!
fail to take into coilslderatioti when
bey start projecting railroads."
Mr. Yoiikkuin will remain In the
city today for tho purpose of looking
alter some business matters before
proceeding west.

Explains Rise In Price
Of Sugar,
Fd'tor Morning Journal:
In your Issue of December S, page
3. column 3, your Washington tele
gram dated December f states:
'Kepri-seiit.ilive Haker ot Califor
nia, drew from V. T. Willett (a sugar
expert I to.ore the house investigat
ing committee today, the oiugliifude
of the profit made by the beet sugar
interests on the rise to the consumer
which began last June."
The question was asked me recently
by two quite Intelligent persons what
was the reason sugar was o much
higher In Albuquerque than in the
east, when ! answered that the price
had al-x risen there. 1 was tel l that
the article could st'll be bought ut
the old price. Fvidi-ntly this Informa
tion was had from toad order house
catalogues, where twenty-tlve pounds
of sugar is offered for $1, when a
bill of groceries of a staled amount
is bought at the same time.
The article follows.
"Mr. Willett said that when the
New York price of sugar advanced a
corresponding tire was announced in
the west, although the beet sugar re
fineries of Colorado and California
had an enormou supply of their pro
duet on hand."
"Why did the beet sugar manufac
turers of California raise their prices
just because New York refineries,
three thousand miles away, did so?
Mr. linker asked.
Answer "liecause it was good
buslners."
"That Is what Is known as good
business Is It
Answer "Yes, of course If they had
not done so, they would have been
called focds lr they gave away two
cents profit on a pound."
The first section of President
Taft's message concludes as follows
"Do we desire to make such ruth
less cemblnatlon and monopolies law
ful? When all energies are directed
not toward the reduction of the cost
of production for the public benefit
by a hculthlul competition, etc, etc.
This is part of his reply to a "cry"
as he states there Is lor a repeal i"
the anti-trust law.
I wonder where that "cry" comes
from?
One of the parties mentioned that 1
talked with told me the reason of the
high price of sugar was the "middle
man," but Mr. Wlllets' reply to Rep
resentative Haker dots not show that
to be the reason.
AH hail a federal corporation law
that will regulate prices of coiuodltles
besides railroad rates.
Yours truly,
