THE PRESIDENT'S PROGRESS.
IN his first message to the Sixty-seventh Con
gress President Harding dwelt upon the in
adequacy of separate treaties of peace with the
Central Powers. He said then:
"The wise- course would seem to bo tho ac
ceptance ot the confirmation ot our rights and
Interests as already provided and to cngago
under the existing treaty"
The "best minds" of President Harding' party
promptly persuaded him otherwise. Separate
treaties of peace were concluded between the
United States and the Central Powers. Then,
to support its claim to an interest in international
co-operation for peace, the Harding Administra
tion put through the Washington Conference on
the Limitation of Armament which resulted in
the Naval Limitation Agreement and the Four
Power Pacific pact.
When President Harding presented these Arms
Conference treaties to the Senate, he spoke of his
knowledge of the viewpoint of the Senate from
personal experience, adding:
"Since that experience I have como to know
tho viewpoint and lncscapnblo responsibility ot
tbo Executive. To tho Exocutlvo corner tho
closer vlev r" world relationship and more im
presslvo realization ot tho monaces, tho anxi
eties anJ the apprehensions to bo mot."
Now, after another (en months, we'find Presi
dent Harding's "impressive realizations" further
developed to a point where he tells this same
Sixty-seventh Congress in its last moments:
"Tho our-Powor p: Jt, which abolishes every
probability o war la tho Pacific, has brought
new confidence In a maintained peace, and I
can well belloro It might becomo a model tor
like assurances wherovcr In tho world any com
mon interest: arc concerned."
Still contriving a shiver, to be sure, at the old
bogy of "super-government;" still pleasing the
"little Americans" with an occasional aside of
"how thankful we are to be out of Europe's
troubles;" still taking roundabout paths to prove
that the Harding peace models are quite different
from the Wilson peace models.
Yet all the time irresistibly driven by a bigger
force than party policy or party consistency
neater and nearer to the frank admission that the
United States cannot go on talking about the
"helpful part it has assumed in international rela
tionship" unless it steps fearlessly forward pre
pared to make pledges and put its name to them.
President Harding is still bent on showing that
there were two roads of post-war foreign policy
and that his road is not the other.
But the further he advances and "icalizes," the
more they begin to converge.
In Its account ot tho Ku Klux performance
at the Washington Avenue Uaptlst Church last
evening, the Tlnicn rcportb:
"Tho coiiR.'vgatlon as tho Klansmnn con
tinued his slow walk to tho chancel, sat In
bllonce, which was broken only by tho titters
ot a group ot young girls In tho front pews."
Sometimes the children arc wiser than their
cldcre. Fancy! A grown man going to church
in a nightgown!
GIFTS LONG DELAYED.
SOME years after the opening of the twenty
first century newspaper repoiters will be
unsigned to delve into yellowed and dusty files
and dig out a news story concerning Cloyd M.
Rice of Elizabeth, N. J. Por a lesv brief days
Mr. Rice is likely to enjoy a wider fame that
he ever did in life.
Mr. Rice's will, probated last week, provides
that the income from his modest estate of $25,000
is to be paid to his widow while she lives. When
she dies it is to be deposited in a New York bank.
Compound interest is to be allowed to work until
the sum on deposit amounts to 2,000,000. Then
the money is to be spent for a designated charity.
The late Charles W. Fairbanks, Vice President
of the United States from 1905 to 1009, made a
somewhat similar provision in his will. I le pro
vided a trust fund of 50,000 for a term of 500
years. Each fifty years the increment is lo be
devoted to some project for social welfare which
will be determined by the trustees. If the trustees
are able to realize 5 per cent on their investment
the former Vice President will be remembered by
a half million dollar gift to society every fifty
years.
As a means of forcing occasional recollections
of a name or of achieving some special act such
bequests are fairly effective. They may receive
wider public notice than an endowment with its
yearly contribution to a specific end, or as a gift
to be spent outright.
Whether such gifts do most good is an open
question. If social welfare work is worth while
and is well done, the return should be greater
than conservative interest rates. The beneficiaries
of social welfare work done now ought to be able
to help the next generation more than the larger
sum of money to be spent then.
A VETERANS' POLL ON THE BONUS.
THE Ex-Service Men's Anti-Bonis League
now comes forward.
This organization points to the fact thai there
arc over 4,000,000 cx-servicc men in the United
States, of whom only some 700,000 arc members
of the American Legion. It claims furthermore
that the membership of the Legion itself is threat
ened with a big shrinkage "largely due to the
Legion's stand on the bonus."
The Anti-Bonus League asks two things:
It asks immediate legislation to provide "in the
most liberal way" care and compensation for all
disabled veterans.
It asks Congress to consider no more bonus
legislation for able-bodied ex-service men until
the League has taken a poll of the, whole body of
vv'orld War veterans to show how a majority of
these men view the bonus proposition.
This organized efforfc on the part of cx-servicc
men who have not been heard from on the bonus
issue is sound, sensible and timely.
It will have the approval of the country. It
should have the respect of Congress. .
To Mayor T'ylan in Chicago Mr, Hearst looks
Just as big as ho does to Mayor Hylan in New
York. Why experiment further?
MOUNTING AGAIN.
COST of living figures compiled by the De
partment of Labor make clear the effects
of the Fordncy-McCumber tariff.
The averages just announced are for the month
ending Nov. 15. In that period food costs rose
in all but one of the twenty-one cities where sta
tistics arc gathered. In New York the increase
amounted to 3 per cent.
Until it became evident that the tariff would be
forced through regardless of public opinion food
prices had been declining. But the tariff changed
the trend. Instead of continuing down, the cost
turned up and we arc now back nearly to the
figures of a year ago.
Tho Soviet rulers in Russia aro tired ot paper
money. They aro going to "stiffen" it into
pasteboard.
CONGESTION OF PLANS, TOO.
NOT a day goes by without announcements of
new plans for the relief of vehicular con
gestion in this city.
Some of the schemes advanced will prove worth
less because on analysis they do not anticipate
the future to the degree needed. Others will never
be realized because they look further ahead than
public opinion can be induced to follow.
But out of the general discussion New York
is likely to get some workable compromise plan
that will be far better than the almost complete
lack of plan that has prevailed.
With many minds working, some minds are
likely to find practical, sensible and possible
'schemes for improving conditions. Every in
dividual and every organization may profitably
help along.
The ferment of ideas is working at such a rate
tbai the need now is primarily one for open minds,
minds not set on any particular scheme, but ready
to thresh out the wheat from the chaff and to
find good features common to many plans.
ACHES AND PAINS.
Tho fourteenth ana, tijieemn Amendments, which
wcro enacted to protect the rights ot men, are long
forgotten. Tho Eighteenth, tchlch was passed to re
press them, has hccoi i tho whole Constitution.

UNCOMMON SENS'
By John Blake
.iZ" (Cormfht lSt bj loba BUte.)
WHAT IS FAME? .
Publicity is easily acquired if one doesn't'earc what kind
of publicity he gets.
Whistler once said that n man who desired to. be widely
known in London need Only to remove his shoes nt a recep
tion now and then.
Soon he would be known over the world of fashion as
the man who removed his shoes. -
.V baseball player in America or a cricketer in England
who appeared at an important game wearing flowing siilf
whiskers would soon be talked of in every country in tlie
world.
Not long ago it young man who wanted to be famous
walked up Fifth Avenue in New York every afternoon wear
ing only a white shirt, trousers, shoes and stockings.
People viewed him curiously for a day or two und then
forgot him.
Side whiskers, which used to be so common as to oc
casion no surprise, would have gained him more celebrity.
The desire for public notice is "so general as to be
pathetic.
Those M ho have no hope to gain it with their brains and
lack the nerve to do outlandish things in order to nttract
attention seek by cultivating the acquaintance of important
people lo get a little second-hand celebrity.
Movie actors, politicians, even famous criminals, 'have
followiugs of people who think that reflected glory or infamy
is better than none.
'Reputation ot the right kind is much lo be desired. Hut
it n-ust be earned honestly lo be worth anything.
If it is only a reputation for honesty or fair dealing it is
better than the kind of fame the human fly gains by stunding
on his head on the cornice of a skyscraper.
To be famous without being fantastic requires a combi
nation of talent and industry which is rare otherwise it
would bring no fame.
But such is the level of general laziness that any one
can gratify a normal desire to shine a little simply by doing
his work a little belter than the next man and being a litllu
more earnest about getting ahead in the world.
The kind of fame conferred by side whiskers on un
athlete soon grows, us inconvenient as the whiskers themselves.
