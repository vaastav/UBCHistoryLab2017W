Direct Telegraphic Communication with 1
China and Japan is the subject now agitat- |
ing the commercial princes of California.
Yesterday a bill was introduced into the Legis
lature there providing for the construction
of interoceanic lines by the Pacific Sub-tele
graphic Company to those countries, either
direct or by way of the Hawaiian Islands. As
this is an undertaking that will favorably effect,
more or less, the interests of the whole world,
it is to bv hoped that the bill will be passed at
once and, if necessary, backed by pecuniary
assistance to forward its execution.
The Grand Duke in Canada appears to
be taking matters in much about the same
manner as any other sensible gentleman
would. The authorities of Montreal and
other places, while taking care that he shall
have no opportunity to complain of their hos
pitality, have wisely determined to allow him
to go about without that forced attention, and
ostentation which have characterized nearly
all his movements Id the United States. If
Spotted Tail can arrange matters on the
Prairies on about this basis the Prince may
be enabled to enjoy himself there also.
A Brutal Wife Murder at Lynn,
Mam., took place yesterday. A man
named Venner, having dispatched his wife in !
the most cold-blooded manner with a large
dirk knife, fled to the woods, where he
was shortly afterwards found by the police
officers who bad been sent to arrest him.
After fijbting furiously and severely wound
ing one of the officers, and threatening others
with the same instrument he had employed to
kill his wife, the City Marshal found it neces
sary to shoot him dead, that being the only
manner in which they could take his body
without danger to themselves.
British Policy in the Far East?The
Annexation of Sumatra.?Great Britain
still keeps stretching out her arms. One of
our latest items of news is to the effect Ibat
the lower house of the Dutch Parliament has
voted the cession of the island of Sumatra, one
of the largest and finest islands in the Indian
Seaa, to the Britisn government. In spite of
ber so-called decay Great Britain ke*>pa build
ing up a grand oceanic empire. Let any man
glance at the map, and, lookiu, at India, on the
one hand, and Australia on the other, he will
see the value of Sumatra ae an integral por
tion of the British dominions. Java and New
Guinea must follow; and then Great Britain
in the Malay Archipelago will have no rival.

The criminal prosecutions initiated against
the parties alleged to hare been implicated in
the frauds committed upon the City Treasury
afford some hope that justice will at length be
done and that the mystery enveloping these
notorious crimes will be cleared away. The
civil suits heretofore instituted in the matter
have not promised any satisfactory results.
The well known delays of the law threat
ened to protract the litigation for years; and
even should the most favorable termination
have been reached in tbe end and the full
amount of the claim set up on behalf of the
people hare been recovered from the defend
ants, the demands of justice would not have
been satisfied. It was generally felt by the
people that the mere disgorgement of three
million dollars by men who had stolen more
than five times that amount from the public
treasury would be a mockery of justice.
Without entertaining any vindiotive feeling
against those who have been recklessly led
into these crimes by the passion for sudden
wealth, our citizens have believed that a
stern and sufficient punishment of tbe
guilty parties was a public necessity
in order to d'ter others from similar viola
tions of trusts in the future. It was with this
feeling that the charge of Judge Bedford to
tbe Graud Jury of the General Sessions call
ing to their attention the duty of thoroughly
investigating tbe city frauds was received
with universal favor, and that the action of
tbe jury has since been watched with jealous
anxiety. It is in accordance with this senti
ment, and not from any morbid desire to'
arraign the city officials at a criminal bar,
that the arrest and formal commitment of
Tweed and Connolly afford satisfaction to the
people of New York.
From the time of the formation of the Com
mittee of Seventy at the Cooper Institute
meeting there has been danger that the move
ment originally instituted to secure a thorough
municipal reform and to detect and punish the
criminal violation of public trusts might be
perverted to subserve political purposes, and
thus rather injure than benefit tbe cause of
good government in the future. As the
political campaign progressed this appre
hension was strengthened, and it at last became
evident that the most noisy advocates of
reform were laboring only to transfer the
spoils of office from one set of adven
turers to another. For partisan purposes a
bargain or alliance was made with the
ex-Comptroller Richard B. Connolly, and the
efforts of the reformers were directed towards
winning a victory at the polls rather than to
the detection and punishment of those who
bad been guilty of frauds against the munici
pal government. Indiscriminate abuse was
lavished upon prominent men who happened
to be on the Bide opposed to tbe self-styled re
form party, while the worst corruptionists in
the city were taken Into the confidence of the
reformers, and in some instances advanced by
them to positions of trust. As soon as elec
tion was over and the victory was won the
organs of the party that had most profited by
the result set to work to claim its fruits
as all their own, and to belittle the
services rendered in the cause of reform by
those leading democrats to whom tbe over
throw of Tammany was in reality due. The
attacks that bad before election been levelled
at such men as Isaac Bell have been since
election directed against Charles O Conor,
August Belmont and Samuel J. Tilden. The
evil of this partisanship has not, however,
been confined to malignant misrepresentation
of the action of individual citizens. It is
felt in the sudden revulsion against any
measures looking to the bona fide in- J
vestigation of the city frauds and the
punishment of tbe guilty parties. The evi
dent design of the politicians, who, having
I secured a two-thirds majority of both branches
of toe State Legislature, are eager to seize upon
the government of the city of New \ork, and
to appropriate to themselves the spoils that
bad so enormously enriched their predeces
sors, is to hush up all agitation about munici
pal corruption, and to suffer the excitement
against the dishonest office-holders to die out.
It is easy to see that they desire an oppor
tunity to enrich themselves illegitimately out
of the public departments, and that they,
therefore, no longer wish to prosecute
criminally the men who have been
engaged in the past three years in defrauding
the city out of millions of dollars. The very
action of Judge Bedford, which has brought
about the present indictments, has been the
subject of abuse and ridicule in tbe special
organ of the political reformers, and our citi
zens have been assured day after day, not only
that the professed desire to prosecute the
guilty parties was a pretence and a sham, but
that the offences charged against tbe unfaith
ful city officials were of a vqpal character and
probably could not be made the subject of
criminal indictments.
The fall and graphic account given else
where in the Herald of all the details con
nected with tbe indictments and arrests will
render ourTeaders familiar with the proceed
ings so far as tbey have gone. Tweed is
specially charged with felony, in having,
as alleged, audited and allowed, In his
capacity of chairman of the Board of Super
visors, a bill or bills of Keyser A Co. for
forty-four thousand dollars, when he knew
that such bill was fraudulent and had never
been presented to the Board, and of having
received and appropriated to bis own use the
money drawn upon the warrant issued in pay
ment of such bogus account. Connolly is
charged with gross misdemeanor in having
neglected to properly certify a bill for ninety
one thousand dollars, of Ingersoll A Co., and
of corruptly paying the same without
such auditing. The indictments were
lound by Judge Bedford's Grand Jury,
and were prepared by Mr. O'Conor. In
the case of Tweed, who was arraigned before
Judge Bedford, the Judge made a commit
ment without bail, his reason being the same
an that assigned by him when he refused to
admit Hagerty and Baulch to bail. IIe
regards the offences as too grave to warrant
the Court in risking the chance of the escape
of tbe accused, and sees no injustice
in refusing bail when there are no
obstacles in the way ot a speedy trial.
The counsel lor the prisoner immediately pro
cured a writ of habeas corpus and took Tweed
before Judge Barnard, who admitted him to
I bail in the absurdly inadequate sum of five
thousand dollars. This action of Judge
Barnard was received with astonishment by
the people at large, and we do not hesitate to
say that should the accused not be forthcom
ing at bis trial Judge Barnard will be held
responsible by the people for his escape. The
Judge in fixing the bail stated that he could
only regard the case of the prisoner as an
ordinary one, and demand such an amount of
security for his appearance as he should in
any other instance. In this we think Judge
Barnard has made a grave error. While the
present charge against Tweed may be of
itself comparatively light, it is notorious
that the city has by similar prac
tices to those alleged against him been
robbed of millions of dollars, and henoe the
case is taken out of the ordinary class. Five
thousand dollars is a ridiculously small sum in
which to hold a man who is suspected of hav
ing corruptly accumulated double that num
ber of millions, and in accepting such
sureties Judge Barnard has taken upon
himself a grave liability. In the
case of Connolly, the accused being already a
prisoner in Ludlow Street Jail, a detainer was
lodged at that institution, and until be fur
nishes bail on the civil suit on which he is
now confined, and wbioh has just been re
duced to half a million, the question of the
amount of his sureties on the criminal
charge will not be taken up. It is
at all events satisfactory to know
that both the officials alleged to
have been concerned in the city
corruptions are now apparently certain of
being brought to trial. At snoh a time it
would be unbecoming to enlarge upon the
offences they are aocused of having com
mitted, or to attempt In any way to ex
cite a prejudice against them. Every
man is entitled to a fair and Impartial
trial, however grave the offence with
which he may be charged, and this is all the
people desire in the case of Tweed and Con
nolly. Let them be tried without prejudice
and without favor, and whatever may be the
result?provided no legal quibbles are allowed
to defeat the ends of justice.'?the citisens of
New York will be satisfied.
They have no vindictive feelings to gratify,
but they havo insisted, and do insist, that jus
tice shall not be prostituted to political ex
pediency, and that the city shall not be suf
ferred to rest under the stigma of being unable
or unwilling to punish crimes that have been
notoriously committed against the common
wealth.
The British Cabinet and the Foreign
Communists In England.
A Herald special telegram from London
goes to show that the foreign revolu
tionary element which has found shelter in
England under the designation of Communist,
is subject to the guidance either of a vulgar
and indiscreet personal leadership or of that
which flows from the individual promptings of
an uneducated feeling of levelling democraoy.
The press organ of the radical "reds,"
published in the British metropolis, printed
an article on the subject of the sickness of
the Prince of Wales and Us probable fatal
result, in which the writer said, "The Prince
of Wales' illness is an incident in our inter
est." The Communist body did not wait, as it
appears, to be correctly informed concerning
tbe extent or severity of the malady by which
His Royal Highness was afflicted, but has
tened to reveal the malut animun which moves
the associated radicals with reference to the
monarchical system of which he is a repre
sentative. Considering tbe facts that the
foreign membership of the Communist Society
in London consists for the most part
of political refugees who have fled from
other European countries in order to escape
punishments at the hands of their own gov
ernments for the public expression of their
opinions, and that they have found shelter
and asylum under the Crown and
Magna Charta of Britain, this conduct was,
to say the least, in very bad taste. The
Queen's government regards it?as we under
stand our special report?in this light The
Secretary of State for the Home Department
is considering the propriety of asking Parlia
ment for power authorizing him to expel Carl
Marx from the United Kingdom. Marx's resi
dence in London is watched by agents of
the police. This strife between the two
powers, tbe English executive and the foreign
Communist and home radicals, will tend to
develop the respective strength of each. It
will be an interesting struggle, but the "irre
sistible genius of universal emancipation," as it
is understood in the British constitution, wi 11,
most likely, prevail in tbe end, and be declared
a sufficient shield for all reasonable and healthy
progressive reformers.
The Freack Army The Fewer ef the Day
la Fraace.
By a special telegram from London, which
appears elsewhere in our columns, we are
made aware of the fact that the direction
ot tbe International Society in England has
employed of late a system of active political
propagandism in the ranks of the French
army. This missionary agency was not, as it
looks to us, sent forth for the purpose of
preaching among the soldiers for conversion,
but for that of obtaining a declaration of firmer
faith from reformers who had been already
baptized and confirmed in the new creed
of European democracy. The preachers
have reported to the centre of unity in
London. They say that the French army is
divided in political sentiment. The men are
either republican or imperialists; with the
imperialists the strongest in number, the
only object presenting against the real
ization of their hopes being the op
erations of the International. If this state
ment is correct the Internationals hold tbe
"balance of power" between tbe monarchy
and tbe republic in France. A "balance of
power" party is always a strong party, pro
vided its leaders are honest and the rank and
file guided by principle only^
Mr. James Steels Maokate is the new
lessee of the St. James Theatre, which he
will open early in January for a three months'
season. New plays, new scenery, new proper
ties, new costumes, a new orchestra and a new

attract New Yorkers, who, like tbe Athenians
of old, always crave something new. But tbe
chief novelty promised by Mr. Mackaye is as

During the coming week the civilized world
will commemorate one of the grandest and
greatest events recorded in history?namely,
the incarnation and birth of Jesus Christ, the
Saviour of Mankiud. The Christian Church has
fixed the fullness of time for this event toward
the end of December, and the world has almost
unanimously consented thereto. There is
very little dispnte among men in regard to the
life and sufferings and death of Jesus of
Nazareth. There has been a great deal of
controversy, however, over his miraculous
birth and his Messianic mission. And besides
the vast body of Israelites in all parts of the
earth who stoutly deny these things, there are
many nominal Christians who disbelieve, or
affect to disbelieve, the entire history of the
man Christ Jesus. And one of their strong
arguments against this fact, which the Church
so firmly believes and proclaims, is its con
trariety to natural laws. That a virgin who
bad never known man should become a
mother is undoubtedly opposed to the course
of nature; but the Christian Church accepts
now, as it has always done, the conception
and birth of Christ as miraculous events, and
does not undertake to argue the matter upon
scientific or philosophical principles. That
such a person as the historic Christ lived and
died and was buried, and on the third day
rose again from the dead, are facts as
amply verified as any fact in science or morals
need be; and that "this Jesus whom we
preach, and whose birth wo are soon to com
memorate, lived and died to redeem a sinful
race of men can be testified to any day by
more witnesses of every age and in every land
than almost any other proposition that can
be named. Still, with such a cloud of wit
nesses ever ready to attest the truth of this
doctrine, men will quibble over it and re
ject it because they cannot understand it and
because they find no analogy in nature for it.
But the philosophy of it is very simple and
comprehensible.
All forms of life in nature, from the highest
to the lowest, whether vegetable or animal,
require for their production or reproduction
the union of two bodies?the body of the seed,
for instance, and the body of the earth into
which it is thrown. But these bodies pre
suppose pre-existing life and power; and Na
ture herself tells us of a time when her womb
contained no seed nor germ of life, and when
she was "without form and void." Then it
was that "the Spirit of God moved upon the
face of the waters," and, through various crea
tive processes, brought forth the different
forms of vegetable and animal life which we
behold in beauty and endless variety on every
hand. Why is not this fact of creation
denied? It stands alone; there is noth
ing like it It is a miracle, and as
such is as unworthy of credence as any
other unattested miracle according to the
standard of evidence raised by those who re
ject Jesus Christ because of his miraculous
conception and birth. Bat there appears by
the record to be a very close analogy between
the two recorded facts?the creation and the
birth of Christ?and though Moses and Luke
will hardly be accused of collusion in this
case, they use language almost identical to
announce both events. Moses says that "the
Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters," and the result was good, and beauti
ful and holy forms of life. St. Luke, using
the angel's words to the Virgin Mary, says,
' The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and
the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee; therefore also that Holy Being which
shall be born of thee shall be called the Son
of God." If this language, used to describe
two apparently differing and very distant
events, is not as substantially alike as it could
well be, then we confess we do not know what
would constitute similarity of expression.
Indeed, the two facts and events have a
much closer relation to each other than we
are at first inclined to admit. And to under
stand the latter physiologically we must recur
to the former, and note another peculiar phrase
of the Bible narrative, which in its simpUcity
contains the key to this mystery.
Immediately after the Fall, when the
Creator pronounced sentence of condemna
tion upon onr first parents, He held out
to the woman a promise that "her
seed" should bruise the serpent's head.
This is the only promise given in the Sacred
Word to the seed of the woman peculiarly.
Invariably the promises of God regarding
offspring have been made to men. To Abra
ham the promise of inheritance was to "bis
seed," and to Isaac and Jacob likewise. David
and Solomon also received promises of good
ness and raorcy to their seed and offspring; and
the record is uniform in this regard, save in
this particular instance of the promised
Saviour made to woman. Audits subsequent
fulfilment produced a perfect human body,
sinless and pure, by the same power and
means as the original life was produced at the
Creation and without at all violating the Jaw
which requires the union of two bodies to
produce or reproduce life. In both instances
there was the union of a spiritual with a physi
cal body and the offspring was "good" or
"very good." The proper understanding of
these things must encourage our faith and in
spire our hopes, and enable us to celebrate this
wonderful and important event in a becoming
manner and with godly sincerity. And we
shall be able, also, the better to comprehend
how "the Word was made flesh" and how
"God was in Christ reconciling the world unto
himself, and we shall be constrained to ac
knowledge that greater love than this cannot
be comprehended by human understanding.
Great indeed is the mystery of godliness.
God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the
spirit, seen of angels, preached onto the Gen
tiles, believed on in the world, received up
into glory; and the first of these succes
sive events is again brought prominently to
our remembrance by the recurrence of another
Christmas Day. May it be a day of "Glory
to God in the highest and on earth of peace
and good will to men."

Should the weather be favorable there will
doubtless be an immense prooession of the
Internationals and their sympathising friends
to-day (starting from the Cooper Institute at
one o'clook), in respect to the memory of tbe
Communists Rossel, Bourgeois, Ferr?* and
Cre'mieux, recently executed in France for
treason. The Internationals regard these men
as martyrs to the cause of liberty, and hence
this procession. We have found very little to
admire, but much to deplore and condemn in
tbe French Communists. The Commune has
appeared to us only as a reproduction of
the fanatical, senseless and sanguinary Jaco
bin clubs of the first French revolution. Its
blind excesses have arrested the march of
republican ideas in France, and have caused
a reaction in the publio mind which points to
the restoration of the empire. But all this
has nothing to do with this procession.
We suppose, however, that from the horri
ble doings of the Commune in Paris our Police
Commissioners, when they first heard of this
proposed procession, concluded that it was a
projeot of seditious and disorderly vagabond
ism that could not properly be tolerated in
this community on Sunday; and hence their
original interdict. But they soon discovered,
as with the interdict against the Orange pro
cession of last July, that there were one or
two little principles involved in this business
which would be maintained, even in New
York, if necessary, to the extremity of an
appeal to gunpowder. These principles of
American liberty and equality thus affected
were the "right of tbe people peaceably to
assemble" and the principle of "equal
rights" in reference to these Sunday proces
sions. Accordingly, when brought by the
public press to a reconsideration of their Ver
million edict, our amiable Police Commie
sioners wisely revoked it, and so the proces
sion will this day take place.
Many of our pious, oburcb-going people
will doubtless be much annoyed and scandal
ized by this profanation of the Christian
Sabbath. But have not our Jewish fellow
citizens the same constitutional rights in
regard to their Sabbath, which is Saturday,
and do they complain that it is not respected
as tbe Lord's Day by Christians? No; they
are content with the liberty which they enjoy
of worshipping God according to their religions
convictions and usages, and they leave other
sects to the same liberty. The Jews do more.
In deference to our Christian laws and usages
they generally respect both their own and the
Christian Sabbath; when, really, according
to tbe constitution of the United States, they
are not bound to respect our Sabbath. In
another view of the subjeot we find that the
universal respect established in this city for
Sunday as the Lord's Day is due to the
ascendancy here of the Puritan Idea of the
Sabbath ; but how is it in New Orleans ? In
that cityt settled by French Catholics, we find
he French Catholic observances of Sunday
established, in tbe devotion of the day, partly
to ohurch services and party to
military parades, horse races, bear-bait
ings, cock-fights, and the amusements of the
legitimate drama, the opera, opira bouffe and
the nigger minstrels. The observances of tbe
Sabbath, then, in this country, are determined
by local laws, customs and usages. The usage
in this city has been perfect freedom to funeral
processions of every description on Sunday,
and, according to this usage and this tolera
tion, it would have been a bad thing to have
made an exception of these Internationals.
But there need be no difficulty upon this sub
ject of the observances here to which Sunday
hereafter shall be limited. Let the Legisla
ture, in framing a new charter for us, provide
two or three different Sunday laws, and leave
it to the people of the city to choose the law
they prefer by popular vote, or leave our
Sunday regulations entirely to our city au
thorities, and the whole matter can be soon set
tled. In this view this international proces
sion may do much good in calling the public
attention to this subject so actively as to result
in some definite law relating to processions in
this city and other cities, not only on Sunday,
but on the business days of the week, and par
ticularly in reference to the streets and the
hours which may be occupied by processions.

A Herald special telegram from London
makes known a curious incident in the
history of trade speculation in England.
When the Prince of Wales was considered
beyond the possibility of recovery, or about
that period of his illness, English merchants
despatched orders to their agents in Paris
directing them to purchase for their use the
entire stock of black gloves, all the black ar
tificial flowers, all the jet ornaments and all the
black colored dry goods which were held in
stock In the French capital. The orders
have been complied with, no doubt. The
Prince's convalescence will give a di
rection to the distribution of these
habiliment appendages of national woe differ
ent from that which was at first intended.
The mourning goods will be sold, to a great
extent, no doubt, at home during the winter
months, and their sombre colors?when the
different articles of dress are made up and

When William the Conqueror laid sick in bed
the use of a cutting taunt by a French
monarch roused him to exertion and a terrible
avengement in France. The Prince of Wales
will be soothed by the sight of the products
of French looms and of French industry gen

change.
The Law Afaliii the Prleste la (?ermaay.
The Herald's correspondent, writing from
Munich, gives us the particulars of the measure
recently introduced into and passed by the
German Reichstag "providing for the punish
ment for the misuse of the pulpit for political
objects." As may have been expected, the
new law has caused considerable stir among
the clericals. It is regarded faff them as an
unjust and a tyrannical measure and a decla
ration of hostility. The "Old Catholics" and
the liberal religious press are undisguised in
expressions of its approval. Tnis Is not
strange when we oonsider the oharacter of
the struggle now going on in Gormany by the
i "Old Gatbollo party," led by Dr. Dollinger,
?ga nst tbo Catholic party proper, who beilev*
i? infal,iwut7 of the Pope and giro

o. the new law. The obaoxlou8 para.
graph in the law reads :-?A priest or any
other servant of religion who. io the exercise
or n the occasioning of the exercise of his
calling publicly before a multitude, or who in
a church or in another place of religious as
sembly shall make affairs of the State the sub
ject of an announcement or debate in a man
mer dangerous to the public peace, shall be
sentenced to imprisonment or arrest in a for
tress to the extent of two years." It will be
seen from the foregoing that the State has
determined to act with vigor and prevent, if
possible, the exercise of religious criticisms
of its measures. How far successful in its
workings or to what extent the law may be
enforced remains to be seen. Persecution
m ikes converts, ? and persecuted priests are
very liable to become martyrs in the eyes oI
the people. A persecuted Church is a
strong Church; and may not this very law,
made to protect the State from religious.criti

Our Religion* Press Table.
The religious press is remarkably dull this
week. There is scarcely a thought through
out its columns which if revived can do
much toward benefiting Christianity or aid in
extending the truths of the Gospel.
The Independent, after dismissing the
Prince of Wales as a corpse, discourses upon
"Mr. Blair on the Passive Policy," and sagely

We are gratified to learn from the Evange
list that that map of the Presbyterian Cburoh
Is completed and is in the hands of the
printer. Now that the Evangelist has taken
a hand in the map business, why does it not
give us a map of the tergiversations of other
churches, and thus point out to the ignorant
the signposts on the way to glory ?
The Evangelist has a leading editorial on
the subject of "Victor Emmanuel in Rome."
We reproduce a paragraph : ?

The Jewish Messenger has a note from a
Hebrew, in which the non-instrument subject
in choirs in the synagogues is mooted. The
Talmud is quoted, and the writer throws mud
upon all who advocate the employment of
string or wind instruments in this connection.
"At the time of the existence of the Temple,"
says the Messenger's correspondent, "there
were twenty-four synagogues in Jerusalem.
Had they any musical instruments in their
interiors? Most emphatically no!" If the
synagogues had enjdyed the luxury of having
one of our street organ grinders in their
"interiors" they would, doubtless, have worked
out their salvation without being obliged to
resort to blowpipes.
"Trust not in oppression and be not vain
in robbery," was the significant text for an
excellent sermon delivered recently by Rev.
Dr. H. Vidaver, at the B'Nai Jeshurun syna
gogue, in this city. The "vanity of riobea"
has liven way in this day to the vanity of
robbery. Five thousand dollars' bail is cheap
for a five million robbery. Who can inter

The New York Tablet is one of the best
conducted papers of the Catholic persuasion
in the country. In discussing the President's
Message it says:?
We wish it had recommended the abandonment
of the irritating and useless Ku Klux policy, shown
Borne respect for state rutins, and urged a com
plete amnesty to all who took part in the late rebel.

so shameful a chap'er in tne history or our country
could ever need to be written as that which records
the treatment by the general government ol those
States since they laid down their arms and sur

The Tablet has an article on the "Catholic
