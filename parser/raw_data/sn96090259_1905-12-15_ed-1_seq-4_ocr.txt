fixing prices that defy ordinary and
fair competition and would kill off
the monopolies if the provisions of
such a law were rigidly enforced.
The penalty of revoking the license to
do business would be far more severe
to the beef con bine, for instance, than
the payment of a cash penalty for dis
regarding 'law. A fine of 85,050 against
a beef packing concern is insignificant.
They could easily rob the beef raisers
of that amount, in a day. Such a fine
would need be imposed frequently in
order to curb them from pooling and
fixing prices—and then doubtless the
more they were lined the lower prices
they would pay for beef and the high
er prices they would ask. A most
rigidly enforced government license
system, snch as Congressman Martin's
bill seems to provide, wo shou'id judge
might strike e.loso to tlu" proper regu
l:iti..n iinti control of those pulilie
defyinir corporations that will even
tunlly, if permitted to go on in their
contempt,uons disregard of the people's
interest or welfare, sap the very life
blood out of producers and con-sutiiers
alike -out of all save those who are
sustained by the uncurbed and "pub
lic be damned"' corporations.
There is need of corporations—of
combined interests and wealth to pro
perly carry on certain enterprises—
and those that are legitimately con
ducting their operations and record z
ing the rights of humanity, are
welcomed in the business world. They
would in no wise l»e inconvenienced or
suffer by such a law as Congressman
Martin contemplates, but. the concern
that is an illegitimate, tyrranica'l prey
upon humanity would feel the clutch
es of such government, supervision as
it seems to us this bill would provide.
S'HJTII DAKOTA'S NATL PARK.
In his annual report the secretary
the interior recommends an appro
pria'ion of sii.tiKl for the Wind Cave
national park in Houtii Dakota. The
:i.'t of iMngresis '-eii.iug aside 10,5'in
a?.res of land for this national park
\va-. approved in January, 1003, and
lie
im'In has
made
much progress as
a national resort. The superinten
dent reports that during the past
year there were '2,-HIS visitors to the.
park while for the ::ame time there
were "20,l visitors to the Yellowstone
National park. When the extent, of
the latter park is considered, the long
time it has been under government,
control and the hundreds of thousands
of dollars spent in making it Hcces
sible to visitors, there is no reason to
doubt that South Dakota's national
park will rank up to it in every way
in the future years, the difference in
size and variety of wonders being con-,
sidered.
Wind Cave is without doubt tho
most wonderful natural underground
passage in the world aud its import
ance is shown by the action of con
gress in placing it on a par with the
few other national parks in the coun
try.
The improvements contemplated by
the interior department for which a
very small appropriation is asked, in
clude supplying the superintendent's
residence aud grounds with water
from lieavey Creek three and a half
miles from the cave enclosing the
irk with a three wire fence building
a water reservoir for lire protection
aud building roads and bridges. These
improvements are only those actually
necessary and do not contemplate
much in the way of encouraging visit
ors to the park. If Congressman
Martin, however, succeeds in getting
through a special appropriation for an
electric line from Hot Springs to the
park and for lighting the cave with
electricity, the result will be to double
the interest in the natural wonder,
and South Dakota is entitled to this
much at the hands of congress.-^Ar

never paid any taxes in the state on
that class of busin ss. He called the

only liable for taxes for the last year,
as no demaud had ever been made up

MACHINES AND MACHINES.
Speaking of political 'machines, the
way to overthrow one is to 'Organize a
bigger and more powerful one. That's
the only sure way of fettling off a "ma
chine" to have it stay killed. And
then the "insurgents'" become the reg

fellows become insurgents—and so it
goes, round after round, the outs get

SPARKS FROM PRESIDENTS
MESSAGE.
Our navy is for the present -enlfl
cient.ly large.
Taken as a whole, we must all go up
or down together.
More and more, war is coming to be
looked upon as in itself a lamentable
and evil thing.
This government, stands for man
hood first and for business only as an
adjunct of manhood.
Congress should consider the feder
al government's duty with respect in
insurance transactions.
A system of examination of rail
road accounts should be provided
similar to that, of national banks.
This (railroad) legislation should be
enacted in a spirit as remote as possi
ble from hysteria and rancor.
We cannot have to much immigra
tion of the right sort, and should have
none whatever of the wrpr.ir sort.
In such a republic as ours, the one
thing that we cannot, afford to neglect
is the problem of turning out decent
citizens.
All private car liues and the like
should be expressly put, under the
supervision of the interstate com
merce commission.
Individual capitalist and individual
wageworker are alike entitled to the
protection of the law and must alike
ohev the law.
We wish to secure as fair treatment
for tho small town as for the big city
for the small shipper as for the big
shipper.
These corporations doing an inter
state business are subj i^ts without a
sovereign, We should assert, the
sovereignty of the national govern
ment.
This government is not and never
shall be government by a plutocracy.
This governmet is not and never shall
be government by a mob.
Tho corporation has come to say,
just as the trade union has come to
stay. Each should be favored so long
as it does good. Hut each should be
sharply checked when it acts against
law and justice.
As the world is now, only that na
tion is equipped for peace that knows
how to fight and that will not shrink
from fighting if ever the conditions be
come such that war is demanded iu
the name of the highest morality.
