v
Milwaukee, Wls., Dec. 5.—Call
for a mass meeting of all pa
triotic citizens of Wisconsin to be
held at Madison, at a date to be
named later, was issued by the
Loyalty legion today.
THE PURPOSE OF SUCH A
GATHERING, THE CALI, SETS
FORTH, WILL BE TO REMOVE
THE "SACRILIGIOI'S BLIGHT
. OK TREASON OR NEAR TREA
SON" FROM ASSOCIATION
WITH THE NAME OF THE
STATE.
It is Indicated the mass meet
ing will be asked to urge a test of
the state's loyalty through a spe
cial election to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of United
States Senator Husting.
AVashington, Dec. 5.—-In the after
glow of the historic light that shone
In Washington when the president ad
dressed congress, there was today only
one shadow— LA FOLLETTE.
The Wisconsin senator's studied
disregard, in the fare of his colleagues'
enthusiastic acceptance of everything
the president said, is the talk of AVash
ington.
The air between these two former
friends—the one a world war leader,
the other a pacifist and under investi
gation on disloyalty charges in the
United States senate was icy.
FRIGID RECEPTION.
I.a Follette sat within five paces of
the speaker's dais, on which the pres
ident stood. Never once did he take
his eyes off him, never once did he in
dicate that he heard a word he said,
albeit his associates were on their feet,
Happing and yelling from time to time.
La Follette sat alone among bis fel
low senators, slouchef Jfar down in his
aeat, elbow on chair arm, chin in hand,
he WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN
THE CHAMBER WHO DID NOT
RISE OUT OF RlfePKCT TO THE
PRESIDENT.
HE DID NOT MOVE.
In the loud acclaim from senate,
house, supreme court, statesmen, dip
lomats and gallery whose members
Jumped to their feet ta greet the presi
dent's call for war on Austria, La Fol
lette did not move. He sat with an
Expression, half smile, half sneer, on
Ills face.
And even when the president de
nounced "the clamor of the noisily
thoughtless and troublesome" pacifists,
AND "SAID "THEY MAY SAFELY BE
LET TO STRUT THEIR UNEASY
HOUR AND BE FORGOTTEN." LA
FOLLETTE GAVE NO SIGN TH AT
HE NOTICED SAVE A DEEPENING
TINGE THAT CREPT OVER HIS
NATURALLY RUDDY COMPLEX
ION.
Washington, Dec. 5.—War upon
Austria will involve little additional
participation above what the United
States has already prepared for, mil
itary men felt today. The navy may
take an active part in the Adriatic
«und Mediterranean, but tke army
plans will not be altered at this time.
American aviators training in Italy
will be free to soar over the Austrian
line. American ships may aid the
Italian navy against the Austrian fleet

Result of President Wilson's I
Message to Congress if the
Allies Extend Invitation
on War Aims.
By J. W. T. MASON.
NEW YORK, DEC. B.-THE GER
MAN PEOPLE MAY SHORTLY
KNOW THE TERMS ON AVHICH
THEY CAN HAVS PEACE IF THEY
OVERTHROW KAISERISM AND ES
TABLISH A DEMOCRATIC FORM
OF GOVERNMENT.
This will be the result of President
Wilson's message to congress if the al
lies accept the obvious Invitation the
president has extended to them to de
clare their war aims.
NO BARGAINING.
Bargaining Is the trade of diplo
mats, but American diplomacy wants
nothing out of the war to be bargained
for. Other belligerents, however, are
not In this class. They desire other
things beside the establishment of a
parliamentary government in Ger
many.
France, for Instance, wants Alsace
Lorrain. The justice of these ambi
tions and their relationship to a dem
ocratic peace would have to be deter
mined before an> public announcement
of peace terms were made.
If the allies should reveal the Ir
reducible minimum of their terms they
would have to take into considera
tion the practical impossibility of se
curing all they want.
MUST b ACE OOLD FACTS.
To arrive at a basis of justice in de
terminlnpr pf'ape conditions is differ
ent, because national prejudices
frequently hard to overcome. Never-!
theless, before the war can end, each
nation must face the inexorable fact \
confronting; it.
President Wilson's message to con
gress is the most important move, yet
made by a belligerent government to
ward looking facts in the face.
The final test of war Aims must now
center about the extent of sacrifices
a nation is willing to make to run the
risk of getting what it wants.

pay for having started the war.
BIG INCREASE IN
WEISER BUSINESS
" . |
Weiser, Dec. fc.~The Weiser postof- |
fice sold over $200 worth of war sav
ings and thrift stamps the first day I
they were put on sale, Dec. 1. They '

people here. A good many of the j
Weiser soldier boys are sending money
to their parents, and some of the par

savings stamps for use of the sons
when they return from the war.
BIG INCREASE.
That business In Weiser is prosper

in the postoffice receipts in Novem

over 337 per cent. Here are the fig

Hindenburg and Prince
Rupprecht Not Satisfied
to Allow Situation at
Cambrai to Stand
Another Desperate Attempt
Apparently Being Staged
With Object of Forcing
Retirement of the Hard
hitting Invaders.
London, Dec. 6—"Soma adjust
ment of the British line around
Cambrai may be necessary'," Gen
eral F. B. Maurice announced this
afternoon, as a result of the Ger
mans' small gain in .hat section.
He described the south flank gain
as the most important because it
menaced supplies.
"For the first time since May,
1915. the Germans captured Brit
ish guns at Cambrai," said Maur
ice.
"We captured 138 of the enemy's
guns at Cambrai alone. There
fore, there Is no reason for us to bo
ashamed at the balance."
IN BAD POSITION.
"THE ENEMY GOT IN AN
AWFUL POSITION," the general
continued. "But even If a slight
withdrawal north Is necessary, we
still will possess the Hindenburg
line on a 10-mtle front.
"On the other hand, the enemy
may claim that his promptness In
bringing up reserves definitely
checked our advance.
"There is no doubt that Quarter
master General Ludendorff plan
ned and supervise^ the Cambrai
attack. It was made simultan
eously on both flanks and was fol
lowed by an attempt at penetra
tion of the center. Both the stroke
at Bourlon and ln the center failed.
To the south, the Germans suc
ceeded, on account of the surprise
nature of the attack, and broke
our original line to a depth of $009
yards, overrunning our guna."
