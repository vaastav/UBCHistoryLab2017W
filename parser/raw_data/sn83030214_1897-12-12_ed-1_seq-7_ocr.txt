.VANT TO BUILD THE ROAD.
.J-J?RE? SYNDICATES INTERESTED IN THE
RAPID TRANSIT SCHEME.
J^PT TO BID FOR THE CONTRACT - THE
PtCTSCHB BANK SUPPOSED TO BE CON
KZOTED WITH ONE OF THE COM?
PANIES- EXTENSIVE PLANS
ALREADT MADE.
farse syndicates are making active prepar 'lons
BJ bid for the contract for the construction and '
Iteration of the underground rapld-tranalt rall- I
j^sd, the plans for winch have been formulated
t*y the Rapid Transit Commlaslon. One of these [
gjredkdtes ia said to be principally backed or rep- |
??jrtented by the Deutsche Bank, of Berlin. This j
syndicate Is believed to have advanced much |
further In Its preparations to make bids than either j
ot the other two. Its reported plan is to deposit j
UOOO/00 *w?th the United Statea Trust Company,
to be drawn upon for the carrying out of the
work, this ?um to be maintained by fresh de?
posits when drafts are made upon It. Th* other
tiro syndicate? whleh are actively preparing to
mak* bids for the contract' are not known, but
goisip In Wall Street Include? the names of J.
< Pierpont Morgan as well as the Vanderbllt inter?
ests 1n the scheme A representative of the firm ,
of J P. Morgan & Co.. however, said the firm had
nothing to do with the underground scheme
W. B. Parsons, chief engineer of the Rapid Tran
f-ft Commission, said yesterday afternoon to a Trib?
une reporter: 'Thera are three separate syndi?
cates who have actively prepared to bid for the
contract when bids aro advertised for, as they
-gil] be If the Appellate Division of the 8upreme
Court should decide favorab'.y upon the report of its
Commission. One of the*e syndicates has gone ays
ft*piStlfj?llT to work to retain counsel and en?
gineering experts to examine the plans Charles
Sooysmlth is their chief engineering expert, and he
has examined the plans ani specifications in my
office, and reported upon them to hi? employers.
These employers ha\e been BO well satisfied with
the report made by their engineer that they have
taken suvh ?:eps that they will be able to proceed at i
on^e upon the work if tha Commission should
award the contract to them. They have obtained j
bids upon various portions of the work from sub?
contractors, and have awarded those contract? con?
ditionally upon their receiving the main contract
from the Commission. They have also made ar?
rangements to secure the necessary bond?, and
have agreed with the Carnegie Steel Company
upon a price for the steel to be used in the work,
although the price is considerably less than ?53 a
ton. the amount ment.oned In some quarters. Thu?
this syndicate s-.ands reidy to proceed to the
work with small delay should It get the contract."
tVISH TO KEEP IN THE DARK
When asked who were the persons behind the
three syndicates. Mr. Parson? replied that he really
did not know. Inasmuch as those persons naturally
wUhed to keep as much In the dark a* possible
until they knew where they stood
"The two syndicates other than the one whose
methods I have described." continued Mr Parions,
"have proceeded about their preparations In a
different manner. They intend to make their bids,
I believe, without going to tne length of letting
their conditional BUb-contracts. leaving that for
later developments. The persons securing the con?
tract will n?"it have to use such an enormous amount
of money as some people seem to think. The city
will pay for the work. The contractors will have
to deposit $1.000,000 to demonstrate their good faith.
to ?.. ure the necessary bonds, to advance tha
money for the equipment, and for beginning the
work, but the finances needful are not ao enorfw?us
as they have been represented to be in ioma quar?
ters. But everything hangs fire now until the de?
cision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court has been made known. The Rapid Transit
Commission has nothing to do until they get that
decision. The plan? and specifications are finished
and printed. Everything is ready for advertising
for bids. But the public may rest assured that
there will be responsible bids for the contract If
the CommisMon's report is approved."
CHIEFLY AMERICAN CAPITALISTS.
Lewis L. Delaneld, secretary of the Board of
Rapid Transit Commissioners, would say nothing
with regard to the story, except that there would
not only be a bid. but bids, for the contract, it is
balleved by many, however, in Wall S:reet that the
Deut.-, he Bank of Berlin is not at the bottom of
any one of the syndicates, but will Rtand as trustee
for prominent American interests. Mr. Parson? ?aid,
In confirmation of this report, that, while he did not
know anything about the individual makeup of the
varlou? syndicate?, he had reason to believe that
the men chiefly interested in the syndicates were
Ameri, an capitalists.
A B. Boardmaji, on? of the Commissions counsel,
said that there was no doubt that a strong syndi?
cate had been formed to bid for the contract and
had eondl?ontlly let it? sub-contracts, as well aa
made arrangements to secure the needful bonds
in case tha contract should be awarded to it. Mr.
Boardman doubted that the incomln;r municipal ad?
ministration would be hostile to the plans of the
Rapid Transit O-immiaaion.
WORK OF C. SOOY8MITH.
Charles Sooysmlth, who has prepared the estimate
upon which one of the syndicate Is prepared to bid,
snd who. if the bid is accepted, teil be the engineer
of construction for that syndicate, said to a Tribune
reporter last night, in answer to queries:
' It is true that for several month? I have been
giving most careful study to the problem of an ac?
curate estimate of what It will cost to build and
complete the underground railroad ayetem aa ap?
prove 3 by the Rapid Tranalt Commission. It Is
true also that I ha\e been acting for a combination
of men wbo propose to bid for the contract. All I
can say now about this combination is that It In?
cludes the necessary element? to con?truct ?uch a
system as this, and also to take over and operate
? a.'-cr it has been built. In computing the prob?
able cost I hav? trusted solely to my estimates, but
have divided the work to be done Into a large num?
ber of section?, and my negotiations have been con?
fined to the most competent contractors in the coun
t-y Each individual or firm ?elected to build theee
sections has been chosen for his special fitness to do
the work and to cope with the conditions on the
particular section allotted to him From all of
these men or firms so selected I have received the
requinte evidence of their ability to carry our, prop?
erly and expeditlously. the work awarded to them
Thus I am confident that my estimate wl.l be auf
Helen? for the whole work, and I am also con
vlnced that If the members of the syndicate In
whose behalf I am acting are the successful bidders
the work of making the road will be done In the
Bios; satisfactory manner."
'Being a competitive bidder, you would not. of
course, give any hint as to the amount your syn?
dicat? is prepared to expend, but may I ask If
your estimate as to the cost of building the road
comes within that of the Commission'"' was an
inq'iiry addressed to Mr Sooysmlth by a Tribune
reporter.
ESTIMATES WELL WORKED Ol'T
"I hardly like to say anything In that direction,"
Mr. Sooysmlth replied, but I can say that Mr.
Parsons'? estimate of $35,000,(X?0 was well worked
out. and I can say further that our bid will not
be In exceaa of Mr Personas flg-irea."
Mr Sooysmlth declined to make known the
r.ames of those who form the combination. "Al?
though I am wau aware," he explained, of the
makeup of the syndicate. It ?loee not come within
my province to allude to that part of the .*ch?me.
Ail that I am willing to say In thl? connection
i? that before joining the combination I satisfied
myself that it wa? backed by bankers of the high?
est sutiding.
Charlea C. Beaman, of the well-known law firm
of Evans, Choate St Beaman, haa appeared before
the Commissioners as the representative of a syn?
dicate of capitalist?., it la aald. who desire to bid
for the raliway. Mr Beaman la said io have as?
sured tha Board that hi? principals were men of
high standing and were financially ?bia to carry
through any scheme, no matter how great Its mag?
nitude. But Mr. Beaman was entirely uncommu?
nicative when he was approached last night by a
Tribune reporter at his horn?-. No. li East Forty
fourth-st.v "I am not prepared to say anything
Upon the ?ubject." he ??id. "I am simply tho con?
sulting counsel of a few men who are Interested In
big constructions, such as the rapid transit run?
way would be. More than mat I have no Informa?
tion to give."
John O. Stewart 1? the president of the Vnlled
States Trust Company, and Edward D. Adams Is
the representative of the Deutsche Bank. Both
emphatically refused to answer any tnquirtaa laai
evening.
DOES NOT KNOW THEIR NAMES
President Alexander E. Orr ot the Rapid Tr?n
Slt Commission, when aeen at hie home In Brook?
lyn, last evenina aa.d the Commissioner? had re?
ceived requests from representatives of aavoral
(troapectlve bidder? for .he contract for building
the underground tunnel Mr. Orr denied, however,
.liai he knew who tha applicants were, and added
that be would not feel at liberty to give their
Sames, even if he knew thora. "We think." be
added, 'that they are people of responsibility .
Ot tne visits the Commissioner? have received tra??
Pro?pr*.cHvo speculator? m the tunnel project, Mr.
mt J. . *L w^?n?ver any person has expressed a de?
sire to be informed of the general plan? for the
proposed tunnel, with a view of bidding for the
worn, we have requested our civil engineer to fur?
nish ?very facility tor a thorough examination,
?nd to tell the applicant for Information all he
wished to know. There Rave been several appll
canta for auch Information. When we laid cut the
previous route we also had several applicants for
similar Information, and also invited many experts
to give us suggestion? on our plans. We adopted
the same course In making out our second plans.
Some of those to whom we have explained our
plans came en our general Invitation to look over
our plana and maka ?ugtreRtiona. and so I am not
able to say how many of thoae who hav? lnveatt
gated the plans did so with the purpose of fur?
nishing the information to persona ready to un?ler
taka tn* work of constructing the tunnel
TO HAVE AS LITTLE DELAY AS POSSIBLE.
"One of our object? In Informing engineer? and
contractors and prospectiva sptculatora about our
general plans waa to have as little delay as possible
in calling for bids as soon as we have the permis?
sion of the courts to proceed with our work. For
six or eight months we have been furnishing In?
formation on our second plan, and every little -while
we would receive a new request. Out of this larg?
number, wa knov that several parties are lookintc
for Information with a view to bidding on the
work.
"If we now have a favorable decision from the
Appellate Division, we can go on almost immedi?
ately to advertise for the contract 1 am willing to
say that we have reason to hope that we shall have
more than one or two bids."
Mr. Orr say? that several newspaper stories of
conference.? he had held with prominent financiers
on the subject of the contract for building the tun?
nel were erroneoue.
MARTINELLI GOING TO ST. PAUL.

Rome. Dec. li.-The Vatican. It Is seml-officlally

the Papal Delegate to the Roman Catholic Church
In the United States, visiting ireland for three
weeks. It la pointed out that ?his approval is re?
garded as a sign that Hlbernlanlsm Is reeaining
favor at the Vatican. Orber signs of this are said
to b* th? retirement of Monslgnor Schroeder from

Washington, Dec. 11-Monsignor Martinelli is not
at present in the city, but it wa? said at the Papal
Legation to-night that he has no intention of going
to Ireland. The opinion was expressed that the
statement from Rome grew out of the fact that
Monsignor Martinelli. accompanied by Dr Rooker,

THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF SOCIOLOGY.
DR MACVRACKXN 8 ADDRESS AT THE DINNER OF
THE SCHOOLMASTERS' OTU**.
The annual dinner of the Schoolmasters' Club
of Naw-York waa held at the St. Deni? Hotel last
evening Walter B <?unni?on presided, and among
the one hundred and twenty-five who were pres?
ent were the Rev. Dr. Henry M. MacCracken, chan?
cellor of New-York University, George G. Ryan.
Abner B. Holley. Charles A Dorsey, Martin H.
Ray. Richmond R Elliott. Thomas 8. O'Brien.
William C Hess and James Lee.
After dinner Dr. MacCracken gave an address
on the study of sociology In schools and collfc?.
and recommended that in every high ??-hool and
academy the students, at any rate those In the
higher classes, be given practical Instru? tlon In
social subjects. To do this properly It was neces?
sary to study human activities at first han?l by
means of visit? to Industrial and other en!irprls??s
Pr. MacCracken suggested that the pupils devot"
on? afternoon a month to this "field work." Half
of the twelve afternoon? ?pent In this way during
the year might bo occupied In \lsitlng humanity
In Its normal condition, the other half In studying
Its abnormal conditions. By normal condition, the
speaker explain?,.* that he meant mill? an?l factories
for men and women, the great exchange?, and
perhaps occasionally club? and place? of amuse?
ment I'nder the head of abnormal conditions
would be included houses of refuge, prisons, ulms
houses, hospitals, and schools for the deaf, dumb
and blind. The members of these clisses should
write reports on what they had seen, which should
be read to the younger students. Dr. Mac'ra ?ken
?aid he thought that this system would result In
immense gain to the students, by ptvlng them an
insight into th<? conditions of modern life, and
thTefore teaching them sociology in the most
practical manner.
After the address the subject was discussed by
a number of those present.
"IF YOU SEE IT IN 'THE SUN,' IT IS\T SO"
From The Evening 8v*n
The Hon. Whitelaw Reld'a new?p?p?r Inform? It?
few readers that the P. and O. line meana "Pacific
and Oriental." This does not demonstrate an ac?
curate knowledge in the brick tower of either Mr.
Kipling's works or the old overland route.
[Once upon a time there wa? a little boy who
?aid: "My father and mother have both broth?
ers and sister?, but I have neither uncle nor
aunt." The simple explsnatlon of this mystery
was that the little boy lied. So doe? "The Even?
ing Sun." So does Its morning degenerate. If
you see anything In either of them about any?
body or anything they could have any motive
for lying about, the presumption alway? is that
they lie.]_
CURRENCY LEGISLATION IN THE SENATE.
Senator Richard F. Pettigrew, of South Dakota,
says that outside of the appropriation bills Con?
gress wi.l enact practically no legislation this ses?
sion. He came to the city yesterday to stay over
Sunday, and Is at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. "Of
course," he said, ' strenuous efforts will be made
to enact some currency legl?lailon. but I do not
think any bil) can pass, owing to the wide diver?
gence of opinion in the ?Senate as to what should be
done. I do not think that one-third of the mem
bera of the Senate would support President Mc?
Kinley? financial plan If It came to a vote. His
plan regarding the greenbacks is ?Imply a scheme
to make all the note? gold certificate?, and I do
not think hi? ideas w11 be supported "
Senator Pettigrew aald that he did not know Just
how the Senat? stood uoon the Hawaiian question,
but hardly thought a large enough vote could be
mustered to Insure annexation.
THE SOUTH AND PROTECTION.
W. A. McCorkle. formerly Governor of West Vir?

vocate. Said he at the Fifth Avenue Hotel yes?
terday: "The South will ?oon b*lie\e In pro-*.
tlon. We are becoming great producer?, and we
naturally want pratectlon. I havo alway? dif?
fered wl'h William L. Wilson In hi? free-trade
creed. Whan he started to put hi? theories into
operation Weet Virginia was about fifteen thou?

it into the Republican column."
