Facing! on. Dec. 1. IS9o.— The fol
owimr is the presidents message, as
read to congress:
To the Senate and House of Repre- I
sentatives: The reports ol the several
executive departments, which will in
laid before congress m the usual course,
will exhibit in detail the op •rations of
the government for the last liscil year.
Only the more important incidents aud
results, and chiefly such as may ue the
foundation of the recommendations I
shall submit, will Ik? referred to in this I
annual message. The vast and I..creas
ing business of the govern has
been transacted by the several depart- !
ments during the year w.th faithful
ness, energy and success. The rev
enues, amounting to above $4">o.tK) i,»i >»,
have been col led and disbursed with
out revealing, so far as lean ascerta ;i. a
single case of defalcation or embezzle
ment. An earnest effort has been
made to stimulate a sense of responsi
bility and public duty in all officers an I
employes 'of every grade, and the work
done by th-tn has almost wholly es
caped unfavorable criticism. 1 speak
of these matters with freedom because
the credit ol this good work is not mine,
but is shared by the heads of the several
departments with the great butty of
faithful officers and employes who
serve under them. The closest scrutiny
of congress is invited to all the methods
of administration and to every item of
expenditure. The friendly relations of
our country with the nations of Europe
and of the East have neen undisturbed,
while the ties of good will and common
interest that bind us to the states of the
Western hemisphere have been notably
strengthened by the conference li id in
this capital to consider measures for the
general welfare. Pursuant to the in
vitation authorized by congress, the
representatives of every independent
state of the American. conti
nent and of Ilayti met in con
ference in this capital in October.
1889, and continued in session until the
lilth of last April. This important con
vocation marks a most interesting and
influential epoch in the history of the
Western hemisphere. It is noteworthy
that Brazil, invited while under an im
perial form ot government, shared as a
republic in the deliberations and results
of the conference. Toward the end ot
the past year the only independent mon
archical government ou the »Vest -rn
continent, that of brazil, ceased to ex
ist, and was- succeeded by a republic.
Diplomatic. relal Were at once es
tablished jjyith the new gov. rnineiit.
but it was not completely recognized
until an opportunity had been afforded
to ascertain tnat it had popular ap
proval and support. When tne course
ot events had yielded assurance of this
fact, no time was lost in extending to
the new governiiMht a full and cordial
welcome into the lamily of American
commonwealths. It is confidently, be
lieved that the good relations of the two
countries will be preserved, ami that
the future will witness an increased in
timacy of intercourse an i an expansion
of their mutual commerce.
FOREIGN' RELATIONS.
Statement Concerning the Killing
of Barrundia.
The killing of Gen. Barrundia ou
board the Pacific Pacific Niail steamer
Acapulco, while anchored in transit in
the port of San Jose de Guatemala, de
manded careful inquiry. llav'ng tailed
in a revolutionary attempt to invade
Guatemala from Mexican territory.
Gen. Barrundia took passage at Acapul
co lor Panama, 'ihe consent of the
representatives of the United Slates
was sought to effect his seizure, first at
Cham pence, where the steamer touched,
and aiterwanis at San Jose. 'I i.c cap
tain ol the steamer refused to give up
his passenger Without a written order
from the United Sta es minister; tue
latter furnished the desired letter,
stipulating, as a condition of his action,
that Gen. Barrtiudta's liie should be.
spared, and that he should be tried only
for offenses growing out of his
insurrectionary movements. This
letter was produced to the cap
taili of the Acanulcu by ihe
commander at Nan dose, as bis war
rant to take the passenger from the
steamer. Gen. Barrundia resisted cap
ture, and was killed. It being evident
that the minister, Air. Aliziier. had ex
ceeded the bounds of- his authority in
intervening, in compliance with the de
mands of ihe Guatemalan authorities,
to authorize and effect, in violation of
precedent, the seizure on a vessel of the
United States ot a passenger in transit
charged with political offenses, in order
that lie might be tried lor such offenses
under what was described as martial
law. i was constrained to disavow Mr.
Mizner's act and recall him from his
post. The Nicaragua canal project, un
der the control of our citizens,'* making
most encouraging progress, all the pre
liminary conditions and initial opera
tions having been accomplished within
the prescribed time. Our relations with
the French republic continue to be cor
dial. Our representative at that court
lias very diligently urged the re
moval of the restrictions imposed
upon our meat products, and
it is believed that substantial
progress has been made towards a just
settlement. The Samoau treaty, signed
last year at Berlin by the representa
tives of the United States, German y and
Britain, after due ratification and ex
change, has begun to produce salutary
effects. The new treaty of extradition
with Great Britain, alter due ratifica
tion, was proclaimed on the 2Kb of last
March. Its beneficial working is already
apparent. The difference between the
two governments touching the fur-seal
question in the Belli itig. sea is not vet
adjusted, as will be seen by the corre
spondence which will soon be laid be
fore congress. The offer to submit the
question to arbitration, as proposed by
net majesty's government, has uot boen
accepted, tor the reason that the form ot
submission proposed is not thought to
be calculated to assure a conclusion sat
isfactory to either party. It is sincerely

SILVER QUESTION.
Recent Depreciation of This Coin
Viewed With .Sincere Regret.
Tne act "directing the purc.iase of
silver bullion and the issue of treasury
notes thereon," approved July 14. IS.M,
has been administered by the secretary
of the treasury with au earnest purpose
lo -ret into circulation at the earliest
pan ibie dates the full monthly amounts
in ttie treasury notes contemplated oy
its provision-, and at the same tune to
give tne marKet tor silver bullion such
s.ipport as the law contemplates. The
recent depression in the prices of silver
has beeu observed with regret. The
rapid rise in price which anticipated
a. id followed the passage of tne act was
influenced in some degree oy .specula
tion, and the recent reaction is
in part the result of the same
cause, and in part of the re
cent monetary disturbances. Some
mouths of further trial will be neces
sary to determine the permanent effect
01 the recent legislation upon silver
values, but it is gratifying to cu-m» that
t.ie increased circulation secured by
tne act has exerte.i an i will continue 10
exert a most beneficial influence upon
business and upon general values.
11. le it has not beeu thought nest 10
renew formally lue suggestion of an in
ternational eouteren.-e looking to au
agreement touching the full use of sil
ver for coinage at a uniform ratio, care
has. been taken to ooserve closely any
change iv tae situation aoroad, and no
favorable opportunity will be lost to
promote a result which ii is confidently
believed would comer. very large oeue
ins upon the commerce of the world.
EXGLA.Mi'a i-.1.V1C.
The Ground Has iiee?n Fully Coy-
ered by Porra ;r R3vu»v.
The recent monetary disi.uroi.ie.es in
England are not unlikely to suggest a
re-e initiation of opinions upon this
subject. Our very large supply of gold
will, if not lost by impulsive legislation
in the supposed interest of silver, give
us a position of advantage in promoting
a permanent and s.ue international
agreement for the use of silver as a coin
'metal. The efforts ot the secretary to
increase the volume of money in circu
lation by keeping down the treasury
surplus to the lowest practicable limit
have i»eeii unremitting, and in a very
high degree successful. The tables pre
sented by him no Wilis tne increase
of money in circulation during
the last two decides, especially
the table showing the increase dur
ing the nineteen months he has admin
istered the affairs ot the department,
are interesting aim instructive, The
increase of money in circulation during
tne nineteen months lias been in the
aggregate $y.;.Bi'i'.*.l.J, or about $1.50 per
capita, and of tins increase. omy «"7,ldd,-
Wi was due to the recent silver legisla
tion. That this substantial and needed
aid to commerce r. suited in an' enor
mous redaction of tue public deot and
of the annual interest charge is a mat
ter of increased satisfaction. There
have been purchased and redeemed
since March, ltxjy, 4 and 4}£ per cent
Ponds to the amount of $211,8 2,43*. at a
cost of 1240.020. 741, resulting in tne re
duction of the annual interest charge of
feM*u7,6U9, and a total saving of interest
of 1,070.700.
THE ARMY.
Secretary of War Reports Gratify
ing Results.
The report ot the secretary of war ex
hibits several gratifying results attained
during the year by practical and un
ostentatious methods. The percentage
of desertions from the army (an evil for
which both congress and the department
have long been seeking a remedy) has
been reduced during the past year 245
per cent, and for the months of August
and •September, during which time favor
able effects of the act of June 10 were
feit, S3 per cent, as compared with the
same months of 1339. The results at
tained oy a reorganisation and consoli
dation of the divisions having charge of
the hospital records of tue volunteer
soldiers are very remarkable. This
change was effected in July, 1339, and at
that time there were 40.054 cases await
ing attention, more t.iau half of these
being calls from the pension office for
n forma necessary to the adjudica
tion of pension claims. On the -ijih day
of June last, though over three hundred
thousand lew calls had come in, there
was not a single one that had not been
examined and answered. I concur in
the recommendations of the secretary
that adequate and regular appropria
tions be continued for coast defense
works and ordnance.. I'lans have been
practically agreed upon, and there can
he no good reason for delaying tiie exe
cution of them, while the defenseless
state of our great seaports furnishes an
urgent reason for wise expedition. The
encouragement that lias been extended
to the militia of the states, generally
and most appropriately designated the
"national guard," should be continued
and enlarged. These military organiza
tions constitute, in a large sense, tue
army of the United States, while about
live-sixths of the annual cost of their
maintenance is defrayed by the states.
LOTTERIES.
The Act Regarding Their Control
Cordially Approved.
The passage of the act t > amend cer
tain sections of the revised statutes re
lating to lotteties has been received with
great and deserved popular favor. The
postoffice department and the depart
ment of justice at once entered upon
the enforcement of the law with sym
pathetic vig.ir. and. already the public
mails have been largely freed from the
fraudulent and demoralizing appeals
and literature emanating from tiie lot
tery companies.
OUR NAVY.
Satisfactory Progress Mids in
That Department . 113 Year.
The construction and equipment of
v._ near chim tor the navy have made
THE FAINT PAUL DAILY- GLOBE: TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 2, • 1890.
satisfactory progress. Since March ,4,
1880, nine new vessels have been put in
commission, and during this winter four,
more, including one monitor, will be
added. Ilia construction of the other
vessels authorized is being pushed, both
in the government and - private yards.
with energy and watched with the most
scrupulous care. The experiments con
ducted during the year to test the
tela tive resisting power of armor plates
nave been so valuable as to attract great
attention in Europe, The only part ot
the work upon the new ships that is
threatened by unusual delay is the
armor plating, and eo'ty effort is being
made to reduce that to the minimum,
it is a source of congratulation that the
anticipated influence of those modern
vessels upon the esprit de corps of the
officers and seamen has been fully real
ized."" Confidence and pride iv the ship
among the crew are equivalent to a sec
ondary battery. Your favorable consid
eration is invited to the recommenda
tions of the secretary.
LAND PATENTS.
Title of Honest Settlers Perfected
With Promptness.
The report of the secretary of the in
terior exhibits with great fullness and
clearness the vast work of that great de
partment and the satisfactory results
attained. The suggestions made by
him are earnestly commended to the
consi ieration of congress, though ttiey
cannot all be given particular mention
Were. The several acts of congress
looking to the reduction of the larger
Indian reservations, to the more rapid
settlement of the Indians upon individ
ual allotments. and the restoration to the
public domain oflaiids in excess of their
needs, have been largely carried into
effect, so far as the work was confided
to the executive. Agreements have been
concluded since March 4. ISS'.*, involving
the cession to the United States of about
I4.r_S,QOO acres or land. These con
tracts have, as required by law, been
submitted to congress for ratification
and for the appropriations necessary to
carry them into effect. Those with the
Sissetou and Wahpeton, Sac and Fox,
lowa, Pottawat'amies and absentee
Shawnees. and Cceur d'Alene tribes
have not received the sanction of con
gress. Attention is also called to the
tact that the appropriations made in the
case of the Sioux Indians have not
covered all the stipulated payments.
This should be promptly corrected.
It an agreement is confirmed all
of its terms should be complied with
without delay, and full appropriations
should be made. The policy outlined
in my list annual mes-age in relation
to the patenting of hvds to settlers upon
the public domain has been carried out
in the administration of tne land office.
No general suspicion or imputation of
fraud has been allowed to delay the
hearing and adjudication of individual
cases upon their merits. The purpose
has been to perfect the title of honest
settlers witn such promptness that the
value of the cut.re might not be swal
lowed up by the expenses and extor
tions to which d day subjected the
claimant. The average monthly issue
of agricultural patents has been in
creased about K.Oijo.
Pl,.\Sl>J »S. .
Increased Clerical Force Made
Necessary by Legislation.
The disability pension act. which was
approved on the 27th of June last, has
been put into operation as rapidly as
was practicable. Th- increased clerical
force provided was selected and as
signed to work, and a considerable Dart
of the force engaged in examinations
on the field was recalled and added to
the working force of the office. The
examination and adjudication of claims
have, by reason of improved methods,
been more rapid than ever betore.
There is no economy to the government
in delay, while there is much hardship
and injustice to the soldier. The an
ticipated expenditure, while very large,
will not, it is believed, be in excess of
the estimates made before the'enact
ment of. the law. This liberal enlarge
ment ot the general law should suggest
a more careful scrutiny of bills for
special relief, both as to the cases
wnere relief is granted and as to the
amount allowed.
PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
Accounting for So Many Vetoes in
Aid of Them.
At the last session I hail occasion to
return with my objections several bills
making provisions for the erection of
puoiic buildings for the reason that the
expenditures were.in my opinion, great
ly in excess of any public need. No
class of legislation is more liable to
abuse, or to degenerate into an unseem
ly scramble about the public treasury,
than this. There should be- exercised
in this matter a wise economy, based
upon some responsible and impartial
examination and report as to each case,
under a general law, -
AGRICULTURE.
The Year irked by Agitation
Among Farmers.
The report of the secretary of agri
culture deserves especial attention, in
view of the fact that the year has been
marked in a very unusual degree by ag
itation and organization among the
fanners, looking to an increase in the
profits of tneir baeiness. It will be
found that the efforts of the department
have been intelligently and zealously
done to the promotion of the interests
intrusted to its care. Avery substantial
improvement in the market prices
of the leading farm products has
taken place during the year.
The price of wheat advanced from 81
cents in October. 1889. to $1.00% in Oc
tober, ItftM; corn from 31 cents to
*)'.)'£ cents; oats from I9j{ cents to
43 cents, and barley from 03 cents to
78 cents. Meats showed a substantial
but not a large increase. Export trade
in live animals and fowls shows a very
large increase. The totai value of such
exports for the year ending .June 30,
1890, was *33.ntK',000. and the increase:
over the preceding year was over $15.
--000,000. Nearly UOO.OCi more cattle and
over 45,000 more hogs were exported
than in the preceding year. Tne ex
port trade in beef and pork products
and in dairy products was very largely
increased, the increase in the article of
butter sdone being from 15,504,978
pounds to 29,784,042 pounds, and the
total increase ID the value of meat and
dairy products exported being $34,000,
-000. This trade, so directly helpful to
the farmer, it is believed will be yet
further and very hugely increased when
the system of inspection and sanitary
supervision now provided by law is
brought fully into operation.
THE TARIFF.
A Strong Plea for the 3lcKinley
Bill.
The general tariff act has only par
tially gone into operation, some of its
important provisions being limited to
take effect at dates yet in the future.
The general provisions of the law have
been in force less than sixty days. Its per
manent effects upon trade and prices still
largely stand in conjecture. It is curi
ous to note that . the advance in the
prices of articles wholly unaffected by
the tariff act was by many ascribed
to that. Notice was not taken of the
fact that the general tendency of the
markets was upward from influences
wholly apart from the recent tar
iff legislation. The misinformation
as to the. terms of the act which
has been so widely desseminated at
home and abroad, will be corrected by
experience, and the evil auguries as to
its results confounded by the market
reports, the savings banks, interna
tional trade balances and the general
prosperity of our people. Already we
begin to neat from abroad ami from our
custom houses that the prohibitory .ef
fect upon importations imputed to the
act is not justified. Tim criticisms of
the bill that have come to us from for
eign sources may well be rejected for
repugnancy. If these critics really be
lieve that the adoption by us of a fret
trade policy, or , of tariff rates having :
reference soiely to revenue, would
diminish the participation of their
own couutries in the commerce
of * the world, . " their . advocacy
and promotion by speech and ,
other forms of: organized effort of this
movement of our p -ople is a rare exhibi
tion of unselfishness in the trade. And
on the other hand, if they sincerely 'be
lieve that the adoption ot a protective
tariff policy by this country inures to
their profit and our cost, it is noticablyji
wrong that they should lead the outcry :
against the authors of a policy so help?',
ful to their countrymen, * and crown
with their favor those who would snatch 1
from them a substantial share of a
trade with other lands already inade
quate to their necessities. The reci
procity clause of the tariff act wisely;
and effectively opens the way to securer
a large reciprocal trade in exchange for
flic free admission to our ports
of certain products. The right of
independent nations to make spe
cial reciprocal trade concessions is:
well established, and does not impair
either the comity due to the other pow- !
ers or what is known as the "favored
nation clause," so generally found in
commercial treaties. What is given' to
one for an adequate agreed considera
tion cannot be claimed by another
freely. The state of the revenues was
such that we could dispense with any
import duties upon coffee,- tea, hides
and the lower grades of sugar and mo
lasses. That the large advantage result
ing to the countries producing and ex
porting these articles by placing them
on the free list entitled us to expect a
fair return in the way of customs con
cessions upon articles exported by us to*
them was so obvious tnat to have gratu
itously abandoned this opportunity to
enlarge our trade would have been au
unpardonable error.
There were but two methods of main
taining control oft his question open to
congress: To place all of these articles
upon the dutiable list subject to such
treaty agreements as could be secured,
or to place them all presently upon the
free list but subject to the re-imposition
of specified duties, if the countries from
which we recived them should refuse to
give to us suitable reciprocal benefits.
This latter method, I think, posesses
great advantages. It expresses in ad
vance the consent of congress to reci
procity arrangements affecting these
products, which must otherwise have
been delayed and unascertained until
each treaty was ratified by the senate
and the necessary legislation enacted
by congress.
AMERICAN STEAMSHIPS. :
The Reciprocity Clause of the
Tariff Bill Demands Them, .
I desire to repeat, with added ur
gency, the recommendations contained
in my last annual message in relation
to the development of American steam
ship lines. The reciprocity clause of
the tariff bill will be larely limited and
its benefits retarded and diminished if
provision is not con temoora neons! v
made to encourage the establishment of
first-class steam communication be
tween our ports and foreign ports
for enlargement of commercial ex
changes. The steamship, " carrying
the mails statedly and frequently 'and
offering to passengers a comfortable,
safe and speedy transit is the first con
dition of foreign trade. It carries the
order of the buyer, but not all that is or
dered or bought. It gives to the sailing
vessel such cargoes as are not urgent or,',
perishable, and, indirectly at least, pro
motes that important adjunct ot com
merce. There is now. both in this
country and in the nations of Centrai
and South America," a state of expecta
tion and confidence as to increased trade
that will give a double value to your
prompt action upou this question.
AMERICAN* BANKS. ;»«;.
The Project of an International
Institution Indorsed.
I had occasion in May last to transmit:
to congress a report adopted by the in
ternational American conference upon,
tne ; subject of the incorporation of an
international : . American- bank, with a ;
view to , facilitating money exchange
between the states represented in that
conference. Such an institution would
greatly promote the trade we are seek
ing to develop. I renew the recommen
dation that a careful and well
guarded charter be grauted. 1
do not. think the powers granted
should include those ordinarily
exercised by trust, guaranty and safe
deposit companies,or that more branches
in the United States should be author
ized than are strictly necessary to ac
complish the object primarily in view,
namely, convenient foreign exchanges.
It is quite important that prompt action
should be taken in this matter, iv order
that any appropriations for better com
munication with these couutries, and
any agreements that may be made for
reciprocal trade may not be hindered by
the inconvenience of making exchanges
through European money centers, or
burdened by the tribute which is an in
cident of that method of business.
BANKRUPT ACT.
The Enactment of One Deemed
Highly Desirable.
The enactment ot a national bank
ruptcy law is still regarded as very de
sirable. The constitution having given
to congress jurisdiction of this subject,
it should be exercised, and uniform
rules provided lor the administration of
the affairs ot insolvent debtors. The in-,
conveniences resulting from the occa
sional and temporary exercise of this*
power by congress, and from the con
flicting state codes of insolvency which
come into force intermediately^ should
be removed by the enactment of a sim
ple, inexpensive and permanent na
tional bankrupt law.
POSTAL TELEGRAPHY.
The. Scheme Does Not Evoke Much
Enthusiasm.
The use of the telegraph by the post
office department as a means for the
rapid transmission of written communi
cations is, I believe, upon proper terms
quite desirable. The government does
not own or . operate the railroads, and .
it should not, I think, own or operate'
the telegraph lines. It does, however,
seem to be quite practicable for the
government to contract with the tele
graph companies, as it does with the;
railroad companies, to carry at speci
fied rates such communications as the
senders may designate for this method
of transmission. 1 recommend that
such legislation be enacted as will en
able the postoffice department fairly to',
test by experiment the advantages of
such a u.-e of the telegraph. _. ;
THE FORCE BILL ■"_£
Strongly- Recommended as a Re
lief From Fraud.
If any intelligent and loyal company
of American citizens were required to
catalogue the essential human condi
tions of national life, I do not doubt
that with absolute unanimity they would
begin with "free and honest elections;!''
And it is gratifying to know lhat there
is generally a growing and non-partisan
demand tor better election laws. But
against this sign of hope and progress
must be set the depressing and undeni
able fact that election laws and methods
are sometimes cunningly contrived to
secure minority control, while violence
completes the shortcomings of fraud.
--i In my last annual message I suggested
that the development of the existing
law providing a federal supervision of
congressional elections offered an effect-'
ive method of reforming these abuses.
The need of such a law has manifested:
itself in. many parts of the country, and.,
its wholesome restraints and penalties:
will be useful in ail. The constitution-'
al] of such legislation has been'
affirmed, by the supreme court. Its
probable effectiveness is .evidenced"
by the character of the opposition that.
is made in it. It has bet denounced a*

Jf it were a new exercise of federal
power -and an invasion of : the
rights of the states.- Nothing could be
further from the truth. Congress has
'already fixed the time for the election
*vf members of congress. It has de
• clared that votes fur members of con
gress must be by written or printed
I ballot; it has provided for the appoint
ment by the : circuit courts in certain
cases anu upon the petition of a certain
number of citizens, of election super
visors, and made it their duty to super
vise the registration of voters "conducted
by the state officers; to challenge per
sons offering to register; to personally
inspect and scrutinize the registry lists,
and to affix their names to the lists for
the purpose of identification and
the prevention of frauds: to
attend at elections and remain with
the boxes till the votes are all cast and
counted ; to attach to the registry lists
and election returns any ;■ statement
touching the accuracy and fairness of
the registry and election, and to take
and transmit to the clerk of the house
of representatives any evidence of
.fraudulent practices which may. be pre
sented to them. The same law provides
for the appointment of depu y United
States marshals to attend at the polls,
support the supervisors in the discharge
of their duties and to arrest persons vio
lating the election laws. The provis
ions of this familiar portion of
the revised statute have been put
into exercise by both the great
political parties in the North
as well as in the South by
the filing with the court of the petitions
- required by law. It is not. therefore, a
question whether we shall have a fed
eral election law, for we now have one,
and have had for nearly twenty years,
but whether we shall have au effective
law. But it is said that this legislation
will revive race animosities, and some
have even suggested that when the
peaceful methods of fraud are made im
possible they may be supplanted by in
timidation and violence. If the pro
posed law gives to any Qualified elector
by a hair's weight more thau his equal
influence, or detracts by so much from
any other qualified elector.it is fatal
impeached. But If the law is equal
and the animosities it is to evoke grow
out of the fact that some electors
have been accustomed to exercise
the franchise for others, as well as for
themselves, then- these animosities
ought not to be eunfessed without
shame, and cannot be given any weight
in the dsscussion without dishonor. No
"choice is left to me but to enforce with
vigor all laws intended to secure to the
.citizen his constitutional rights, and to
recommend that inadequacies of such
.laws be promptly remedied. If to pro- :
mote with zeal and ready interest every
project for the development of its ma
terial interests.its rivers, harbors, mines
and factories and the inteiligence,peace
.and security under the law of its com
munities and its homes, is not accepted,
"as sufficient evidence of friendliness to
any state or section, I cannot add con
nivance at election . practices that not
only disturb local results, but rob the
electors of other states and sections of
their most priceless political rights
i/ENVOI.
Congressmen Urged to Neglect No
Important Legislation.
The preparation -of the . general ap
propriation bills . should be conducted
.with the greatest care and the closest
scrutiny of expenditures. Appropria

RUN ON A BANK. .-
Depositors Throng the Keystone
Bank of Philadelphia.
Philadelphia, Dec. I.— Owing to rumors
which have been afl« at for several days a
ong line of depositors have stood iv line all
day in front of the Keystone National bank,
awaiting their turn to get their money.
Promptly at 3 o'clock the doors of the
bank were closed. At that hour SOU deposit
ors were inside the building and quite a crowd
was outsine. Cashier Hays said that the
amount paid out during the day aggregated
about $3d.),000. The bank's deposits aver
age, it is said, $1, -.200,0 <>. a gentleman
familiar with the bank's affairs stated that it
his about $1,000,000 in discounts. City
Treasurer Bardsley, who has $4 iO.ooO of the
city's money on deposit, kept himself thor
oughly informed as to the condition of
affars at the bank He announced this
afternoon that no attemDt would be made
to-day to withdraw tbe money. To-morrow-
Mr. Bardsley will, it is said, confer with the
board of directors of the bank, and it is
thought some action will tie taken relative to
the city's money. After a meetiug of the di
rectors to-day Vice President Granville B.
Hines. a prominent merchant of this city,
accompanied by a brother director, left the
buildiug.and later on returned, bringing with
them a large sum of money, said to be 5500,
--000 which had been, it is said, furnished by
the clearing house association. Bank Ex
aminer Drew said to-day that the Keystone

In Aid of Erin.
Chicago, Dec. I.— lt is estimated that
the collections at tiie two Irish meetings
held in this city Saturday night will
toot up between $IS,OOO and $20,000, al
though the final result will not be known
for several days yet. Mr. O'Connor said
that New York gave $37,000. but that
there were not such tremendous ob
stacles as in Chicago.
