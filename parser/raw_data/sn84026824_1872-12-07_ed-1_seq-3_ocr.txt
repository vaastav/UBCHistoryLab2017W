THE S H E P H E R D S T 0 W N REGISTER A N D J E F F E R S 0 N C 0 U N T Y A 1) V E R T I S E K.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
This document was promptly sent in
to Congress on Tuesday, the first day !
of the tkird session of the Forty-second
Congress. It was transmitted to the
distaut press over the wires, commen
cing to be received in Baltimore about 1
half-past one o'clock and ending about
tluee P. M. It was given to the public
by the press in "Extras. The Sun,
however, stereotyping it and putting it
forth in good form, w.th satisfactory
promptness. It apyears in our Supple
ment to-day, with abstracts oi othei ot
the official documents.
Not only has the past year, according
to the President's message, been without
any startling event, and with the excep
tion of the * Boston tire, without any
marked 'calamity to cloud the general ;
record of peace'and prosperity at home
aud abroad, but the President has abso- j
lutelv no special recommendations or
suggestions to make boyond what have
been forcsqadowed in previous messages
for the immediate future. It is an ocho
in effect for the wish recently expressed
bv Prince B ism arch for the German
Emperor and |?eople, that history with
them might tor a while stand still. The
tone of the message itself is dignified
and official, offering no contrast in this
respect to other similar State papers of
late vears. Nothing of a personal char
acter is obtruded, no allusion even being
made to the fact that a presidential elec
tion has taken place within the past year.
After the usual expressions of gratitude
to the Divine Author of all our bliss
ings, national as well as individual, the
message proceeds directly to a review,
? jually gratifying and succinct, of the
state of our foreign affairs.
Appropriate congratulations are ad
dressed to the national legislature upon
the results of the Washington treaty ?
the award in favor of the United States
pronounced by the Geneva tribunal and
that of the Emperor of Germany in the
matter of fhe San Juan boundary. Here
again there is not a syllable to show that
the award of #15,500,000 in satisfaction
of the Alabama claims is not up to the
full measure of the demands and pre
tensions of our government, but, equally
with the decision of the German Empe
ror, it is accepted as entirely satisfactory.
Thanks are awarded to the several
powers and their representatives con
cerned in these acts of arbitration, and
also to the counsel and agents of the
United States, for the spirit and manner
in which they have discharged the sev
eral trusts and duties confided to them.
Immediate provision by law for the
prompt distribution of' t lie proceeds ot
the Geneva award among tin; parties
entitled thereto is urged. The hearts
of two great nations will re-echo the
hope expressed by the President that
the governments of Great Britain and
the United States may remain as at pre
sent, without a shadow to cloud their
friendly relations.
Congress is urged to the passage of
the supplementary legislation required
to give effect to other provisions oi the
treaty relating to the fisheries *fce., the
parliaments of Great Britain and Cana
da having already passed laws to carry
those provisions into effect. 1 he ap
pointment of a joint commission to de
termine the boundary between Alaska
a id the c >terminous possessions of Great
Britain, as also an increased appropria
tion in aid of the similar commission
now engaged in ruuuiug the boundary
between the United States ami the
British possessions, from t lie Lake o'. the
Woods to the Rocky Mountains are also
recommended.
The suggestion is made that the in
ternational S'atistieal Congress should
be invited to hold its next session, three
years hence, in this country, and that
the centennial celebration in 187ft would
furnish an appropriate oeeasmn for such
meeting. The subject of the centennial
itself comes in for appropriate mention
jr. another portion of the message. An
appropriation in aid of American exhib
itors at the Vienna Exposition to he
held next year, is recommended, also
that two vessels of w:u* be commissioned
to transport to Trieste and l?ack, arti
cles sent from this? country for exhibi
tion.
Sympathy is expressed with Mexico
in its efforts t<> maintain a stable repub
lican government, and the revival of the
commission heretofore appointed to in
quire into depredations along the Mexi
can frontier is deemed desirable, with a
view of removing existing causes of com
plaint.
Allusion is made to the disturbed
conditiou of Cuba, and the belief confi
dently expressed that the abolition of
slavery and the introduction of needful
reforms into tl* local administration
would not fail to advance the restora
tion of peace and order. The promul
gation within the past few weeks by the
home government of regulations design
ed to carry into effect the emancipation
law ot 1870 is hailed as an earnest of
the good intentions of the present liberal
government of Spain in this respect.
'Hie owning of slaves in Cuba by Amer
ican citizens is again adverted to as an
evil requiring repression by law.
The failure of Venezuela to make
provision for the satisfaction of what
are known as the "Venezuela claims" is
again brought to the attention of Con
gress, "for such action as may be deem
ed proper."
In view of the growing importance of
our relations, commercial and diplomat
ic, with China and Japan, it is recom
mended that provision he made for the
support and education of at least four
American youths in each of those coun
tries, to serve as part of the official fam
ily of our ministers there, and to act in
the capacity of interpreters and transla
tors. More adequate provision than at
present exists by law for the relief of
shipwrecked and distressed American
seamen in foreign countries is urged.
At present persons in this situation must
either throw themselves upon the chari
ty of foreigners or be relieved at the
private charge of our consular or other
representatives abroad.
Passing from subjects connected with ;
our foreign relations, the recommenda
tions of the message will be found to
conform to the opinion already express
ed by us, that the present Congress, in
its closing session, will not be called
upon to perfect or adopt any important I
scheme of legislation. The more im- '
portant topics of domestic interest al- ;
luded to in the message are brought for- '
ward more with a. view to their consid ;
eration and discussion at the present ses
sion than with any expectation or desire,
apparently, than anything immediate '
should be done. With respect to the i
all-important subject of the revenues uini
ot taxation, the President plainly says :
"I would recommend that no more :
legislation be had on this subject, unless
it be to correct errors of omission or
commission in the j resent laws, until
sufficient time h:is elapsed to prove that J
it can be done and still leave sufficient
revenue to meet the current expenses of
the government, pay interest on the
public debt, and provide for its sinking
tund, established by law.
| he piescrvatiou of our national
ci edit is ot the highest importance.
Next in importance to this corned a sol
emn duty to provide a national curren
rencj, of fixed, unvarying value, ascom
pared with gold, and us soon as practi
cable, having due regard for the inter
ests ot the debtor class and the vicissi
tudes ol trade and commerce, converti
ble into gold at par."
In these two sentences the whole
financial policy ot the administration for
the present appears to be summed up.
It is one of ''masterly inactivity."
A long list ot special recommenda
tions ma Je by tho Secretary ot War, is
, lecited, and "the favorable attention of
Congress invited;" the report of the
Secretary of the Navy is more briefly
referred to, as showing, however, the
important fact that "unless early steps
are taken to preserve our navy, the Uni
ted States will be the weakest nation
upon the ocean of all the great powers."
Suggestions are made tor the encour
ment both ot inter-State and foreign
commerce. In reference to the former,
attention is suggested to the extension
; ot the James Riverand Kanawha and
Chesapeake and Ohio canals, and the
* connection of the Mississippi Valley
i with the seaboard at Charleston and
Savannah, by the way of the Ohio and
Tennessee rivers and canals, and slack
water navigation, to the Savannah and
Ogeechee rivers. The project of a ship
canal around Xiagra falls, on the United
States side, is also referred to, and grat
ification expressed at the results which
have already attended various works of
river and harbor improvement.
In reference to our foreign commerce
and shipping interests generally, the
the confession is made "that the report
of the Secretary of the Treasury will
show an falling off in our carrying trade
for the last ten or twelve years, and even
, for the past year. He does not believe
lhat public treasure can be better ex
pended in the interest of the whole peo
ple than in trjing to recover this trade
in the expenditure of $5,OIK),()OU per
' annum for the next five years, lint in
our judgment the evil is one which re
quires a more radical remedy.
The modification, if not abolition ol
the franking privilege, with a view to
the correction of some of its more glar
; ing abuses, is again urged upon Con
gress. The scheme of a government
1 postal telegraph monopoly, which occu
pies so large a spaee in the report of the
Postmaster Ceneral, and which is des
tined to excite a good deal of attention
and discussion on the part of the press,
i* presented as a suitable matter for con
sideration and investigation by a com
mittee or commission to be appointed
by Congress.
The President justifies his action un
der the recent acts of Congress to en
force the rights of citizens to vote, and
to enforce the provisions of the four
teenth amendment, (the bayonet-elec
tion and Ku-Klux laws,) and the necess
ity and salutary effect of those enact
ments. Kefei ring to the numerous ap
plications for pardon addressed to him
j in behalf of persons convicted under
those acts, he state that his action there
on is not to be construed as indicating
any change in his "determination to en
force with rigor such acts, so long as the
conspiracies and combinations therein
named disturb the peace of the country."
! Satisfaction is expressed with the re
sults of the Indian policy inaugurated
by the present administration, and a tie
termination to adhere to it without any
I change, except such as experience may
show to be necessary to make it more
efficient. The ultimate removal of all
the Indians into the territory south of
Kansas, and the erection of a territorial
government there for their protection,
is suggested as the proper complement
of the existing Indian policy.
The practical workings of the land
, oflice, the pension bureau and the pat
ent office are illustrated by statistics
collected from the reports of the heads
of those departments. The near ap
proach of the ninth census completion
is to be taken in l.S7">.
The condition of affairs in Utah is
spoken of as unsatisfactory, and the atti
' tude of the Legislature of that Territory
as hostile to the government. A care
ful revision by Congress ot the laws ot
the Territory, with a view to the ultimate
extinguishment of polygamy, is reeom
I mended. Satisfaction is expressed with
the workings of the territorial govern
ment recently established in the District
' of Columbia, which may not be alto
gether shared by taxpayers and property
holders in that District, although the
further suggestion that the country at
large should bear part ot the burden ol
expenses incurred by the present board
of public works will doubtless command
their heartiest approval.
The message finally concludes with a
reference to the popular desire for civil
service reform, and the need of further
legislation on the part of Congrcss to
render such reform permanent and effee
j tive. I pon the whole, as an exhibit of
the material condition of the country
and its relations with foreign powers,
the message conveys a gratifying im
pression of rugged prosperity. In its
recommendations it is singularly guard
ed and non-committal, studiously avoid
ing all excit:ng topics, an. I attempting
the solution of none of the* more diffi
cult problems connected with the finan
cial and business interests which are at
present engaging the attention of
thoughful minds, and which are des
tined to enter so largely into thepolitics
ami statesmanship ot the future. ? Bait.
