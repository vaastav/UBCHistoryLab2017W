FIX ISLAND EIGHTS
SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IS
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.
Court Holds Islands Ceased to Be For
eign Territory After Treaty of Paris
Was Signed—Government Sustained
In Second Dooley Case.
Washington, Dec. 3.—The United
States supreme court yesterday ren
dered a decision In the case of Emll
J. Pepke against the United States.
This is the case known as the "Four
teen Diamond Rings Case" and In
volved the constitutionality of the
imposition of customs duty upon mer
chandise brought into the United
States from the Philippine Islands
after the exchange of the peace treaty
with Spain. The opinion was handed
down by Chief Justice Fuller.
The opinion was adverse to the
claims of the government, on the
ground that the Philippine islands
were at the time the rings were
brought in American territory ceas
ing to become foreign territory, they
became domestic territory, ho said.
The decision in the De Lima Porto
Rican cases was cited at length, and
it was held that the resolution adopted
by congress concerning the Philip
pines was not sufficient to change the
situation. The chief justice con
cluded his opinion by reversing the
decision of the court below.
The supreme court also decided the
second of the Dooley cases, Involving
the constitutionality of the law of
April 12, providing for the collection
of duty on articles shipped from the
United States into Porto Rico. De
cision was rendered by Justice Brown.
The government is sustained in the
second Dooley case. It was held that
the duty collected on goods carried
from New York to Porto Rico was
permissible, but that it was in reality
a tax for the benefit of the Porto
Ricans themselves rather than am ex
port duty, as was claimed by the mer
chants who antagonized the govern
ment in the case.
In both cases there were dissenting
opinions concurred in by four of the
nine justices of the court.
It is generally believed that the de
cision in the Philippine case will lead
to early efforts to secure, legislation
for the regulation of our commercial
relations with those islands.
As tho Porto Rlcaa opinion sustains
the constitutionality of the Foraker
act, no such necessity will arise with
reference to Porto Rieo.
Secretary Root declined to express
an opinion as to the effect of the in
sular decisions In the supreme court
until he ha® had an opportunity to
read them In full. Figures obtained
at t|ie war department and treasury
bureau of statistics relative to the
trade affected show that from the be
ginning of United States occupancy
of the Philippines, Aug. 22. 1898, up
to June 30 last, the total imports in
the Philippines from the United
States were valued at $1,607,436, while
during the same period the imports
from Spain were valued at $1,993,990.
On the other hand, the imports into
the United States from the Philip
pines from Sept. 1, 1898 to Dec. 1,
1901, aggregate $15,448,600. But of
this large total only $1,894,523 con
sisted of dutiable goods, 'so that the
refund on these would not be large.
GERMANS DISCUSS TARIFF.
Count Von Buelow Introduces Meas
ure in the Reichstag.
Berlin, Dec. 3.—Count von Buelow,
the imperial chancellor, in introducing
the greatest parliamentary struggle
that Germany has ever faced, coun
seled the members of the relchstag to
moderation of language, declaring
that the eyes of the world were upon
them. Although this was Germany's
affair, said Count von Buelow, it was
necessary to maintain a resolute front
to the other nations of the world.
"This bill Is the most important
which has been before the house for a
long time, but it does not imply any
deviation from the policy in regard
to treaties of commerce," said the
imperial chancellor.
Allusion was made to the United
States in the course of the debate on
the subject and the name "America'
is likely to yet be more freely used
by both sides of this controversy,
which is moving Germany more deep
ly than has any other civil question
since the emergence of the empire.
ESTIMATE OF EXPENSE BILL.
Secretary of the Treasury Makes An
nual Requisition Upon Cbngress.
Washington, Dec. 3.—The secretary
of the treasury yesterday transmitted

ations required for the government
service for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1903, as furnished by the heads of
the several executive departments.

less than the estimates for 1902 and
$4,000,000 more than the appropria
tions for that year. Following is/a re

WABASH DEATH LIST 18 75.f"!
8ixty-Seven of the Victims Were Ital
ian Immigrants.
Detroit, Nov. 30.—An Interview
with Thomas E. Moran, deputy cus
toms collector at this port, practically
verifies the estimate that at least 75
lives were lost In Wednesday night's
collision and awful holocaust on the
Wabash railroad near Seneca.
The two immigrant cars, In which
the greatest loss of life occurred and
in which so many of the wreck vic
tims were robsted to death, were part
of train No. 13, which crossed Detroit
river from Canada on the ferryboat
Great Western Wednesday and Col
lector Moran Inspected the baggage
of the passengers. He says there
were at least 100 Italians In the two
cars. In addition to these there were
ten more in the smoking car, which
was ahead of the two immigrant cars.
Official advices to Superintendent
Burns of this division of the Wabash
say that of the Italians in the wreck
20 escaped unhurt and were taken to
St. Louis, 15 are in the company's
hospital at Peru, Ind., six others are
in Peru and two are near Adrian, in
jured. Subtracting these 43 fram the
110 immigrants Deputy Moran says
were aboard the train, leaves a loss
among the Italians alone of 67. In
addition eight other bodies were re
covered and identified, whleh makes a
total of 75 dead.

Pittsburg, Dec. 3.—The strike be
fcun by the members of the Switch

any of the railroads and all lines are
now receiving freight, while the yards

tlon toward the reclamation of arid
lands by irrigation and urged congress
to a serious consideration of the ques

President John W. Springer in his
annual address outlined the vork of
the association. The industry is in a

ous problems confront stock raisers
in the future.
The report of Secretary Martin,

dress, was devoted to the work ac
complished during the last year by
the different committees and the of
ficers of the organization. The mem
bership is increasing and the finances
more satisfactory than ever before.

discussions of the present condition of
the live stock industry. Mr. Springer
called for the speakers by states. H.
H. Robinson of Colorado declared
that the centennial state was increas
ing her cattle by the growing of small
ranchers. Favorable reports were re
ceived fron Iowa, Illinois and Kansas.
Chalcmaj. Springer then broke into
the program to allow L. G. Powers,
chief statistician, and Secretary Wil
son to spea1:. Mr. Powers spoke of
the "Live Stock Census of 1900." The
venerable Judge Coleman, who was
the first secretary of agriculture, spoke
in behalf of the St. Louis exposition.
Prof. H. A. Hookston of the Uni
versity of Indiana spoke of cooked and
uncooked food for cattle. He favored
uncooked food. The influence of the
agricultural college on the live stock
'industry was discussed by Prof. Clin
ton B. Smith of the agricultural col
lege of Michigan. Frank P. Bennett

Financial Situation in the Philippines
Causes Uneasiness.
Manila, Dec. 2.—The military de
partments of northern and southern
Luzon have ceased to exist. Mijor
General James F. Wade, formerly In
command of the southern -department,
will leave Manila today to assume
command of the American forces on

surgent leader Cabalios have been
badly demoralized. His followers are
broken into several small bands.
Cabalios holds two American pris
oners.
The financial situation in the Philip
pine islands is causing considerable
alarm. In an interview published In
Manila Henry C. Ide, chief of the de
partment of finance and justice, re
ferred to the probable enforcement of.
an alteration in the immediate fut
ure of the present government parity
of two Mexican dollars for one gold
dollar.
The United States postofflce here
now refuses, except to government
employes, to issue money orders ,iifc
exchange for Mexican silver. The
banks of Manila have been makings
from 6 to 8 fcer cent on exchange.
Merchants and others are forced towf
carry their accounts in Mexican sil-.-,.
ver. The commercial community hads
relied upon the United States Philip
pine commission to continue the sys-..
tem of two Mexican dollars for one*
gold dollar, which the commission#,
itself created. Vi
The commission Is unable to act lnf
the matter without the authority of
congress. This authorization h&a'
