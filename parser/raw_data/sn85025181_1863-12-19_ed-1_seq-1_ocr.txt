PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
FEM.OW-CITIiillKS OF THE ScNATE AND
HOUSE oi' Uu'iinsiiNTATivns :
Another year of health and of sufficien
tly abundant harvests has passed. For
iheso, aud especially for, tho improved
condition of our national affairs, our re
newed and profoundest gratitudo to God
is duo. We remain in peace and friend-
bbip with foreign powers.
The efforts of disloyal citizens ol tho
United States to involve us in foreign wars
to aid an inexcusable insurrection, have
been unavailing. Her Brittauio Majesty's
Government, a was justly expected, have
exercised their authority to prevent the
departure of new hostile expeditions from
British ports. The Emperor of France has,
by a like procccdiug, promptly indicated
the neutrality which ho proclaimed at the
beginning of tho contest.
Questions of great intricacy and im
portance have arisen out of tho blockade,
and other baligoront operations between
the Government and several of the mari
time powers ; but they have been discus
bcd, aud, as far as was possible, accom
modated in a spirit of frankness, justice
and mutual good will.
It is especially gratifying that our prize
1 courts, by the impartiality of their adjud
ications, have commanded the respect and
confidence of maritime powers.
The supplemental treaty between tho
United States and Great Britain, for tho
suppression of tho African Slavo Trade,
made on the 17tli day of February last,
has boon duly ratified and carried into ex
ecution It is belU'ved that so far as A
iiicricau ports and American citizens are
concerned, that inhuman and odious traffic
has been brought to an end.
I .hall submit, for tho consideration of
the Senate, a convention for the adjust
ment of possessory claims in Washington
Territory, arising out ol the treaty of the
lfith of Juno, 1840, between the United
States and Grant Britain, and which have
boon tho source of some disquiet among
the citizens of that now rapidly improving
part of the country,
A novel and important question, involv
ing1 tho extent of tho maritime jurisd'ction
of Spain in the waters which surround tho
Island of Cuba, hao been debated without
reaching an agreement, and it is proposed
in an amicable spirit to refer it to the ar
bitrament of a friendly power. A conven
tion fur that purpose will bu submitted to
the Senate.
I have thought it. proper, subject to tho
i ? . r t 1 1 . , ,
npproval of the Senate, to concur with tut
mtercsteu commercial powers in nn nr
rangeincnt for the liquidation of tho Sch
eldt dues up n tho principles which have
boon herctoforu adopted iu regard to the
imports upju navigation in tho waters of
Denmark.
The long pending controversy between
this Government aud that of Chili, touch
ing the seizure at Sitnna, in Peru, by
( hilian officers, of a largo amount iu
treasure belonging to eitizoiij of tho United
States, lias been brought to a closo by tho
award of his .Majesty, the King of tho
Belgians, to whose arbitration the question
was referred by tho parties. The subjjet
was thoroughly and patiently examined
by tint justly respected magistrate, and
iilthough the suir, awarded to tho claim
ants ma not havu been as largo as they
expected, there is no reason to dinrmt tho
wisdom of his Majesty's decision. That
decision was promptly compiled with by
Chili, when iutolligcuoo in regard to it
readied that country.
Tho joint commission, under tho act of
ths last session, for carryiug into effect the
convention with Peru mi the subject ol
claims, has been organized at Lima, and
is engaged in the business intrusted to it.
Difficulties concerning inter-oceanio tran
sit through Nicarauga, are in course of
amicable adjustment.
lu conformity with principles act forth
in my last annual mcssaco, I havo receiv
ed a roprcsoutativo from the Uuited Slates
of Columbia, and have accredited a min
ister to that Republic.
Inoidonts occurring in the progrefs of
our civil war havo forced upon my atten
tion tho uncertain state of international
questions touching the rights of foreigners
in this country, and of United States citi
zens abroad In regard to some govern
ments ihcso rights arc at least partially
defined by treaties. In no instauco, how
ever, is it expressly stipulated that in the
cveut of civil war a foreigner, residing in
this country within the lines of tho insur
gents, is to bo exempted from tho rulo
M'hich classes him as a belligerent, in
whoso behalf tho government of his coun
try cannot expect any, privileges or immun
ities distinct from that character. I re
crct to say, however, that suoh olaims
bavo been put forward, aud in some in
stances in behalf of foreignors who have
lived in the Uuitod States a greater part
ol their lives. T'fi'ero is reason to behove
that many persons boru in foreign counties
who have declarod their intention to be
COine citizens, or who barn linnn full.,

luatiy altercations aud great prejudices
hayo heretofore arisen out of this abuse.
It is, therefore, submitted to yr.ur serious
con-idcratiou. It might be advisable to
fix a limit beyond whioli no citizen of tho
United Stales residing abroad may claim
tho interposition of his government.
The right of suffrage has often been as
sumcd and exorcised by aliens, under pre
tences of naiurali7Atinn. which Ihey have
disavowed when draf'cd into tho military
scrvico." I submit tho expediency of such
ait amendment of the law as will make the
fact of voting as estoppel against any plea
of exemption from military service or other
civil obligation on the ground of alienage.
lu common with other Western Powers,
our relations with Japan have been brou
ght into serious jeopardy ihrough tho per
verse opposition of tho hereditary aristo
cracy ot the empire to tho enlightened and
liberal pojiey of the Tycoon, designed to
bring the country into the society of na
tions. It is hoped, although not with en
tire confidence, that these difficulties may
bo peacefully overcome. I ak your at

Satisfactory arraugement? have been
made with the Emperor of Ru-sii, which,
it is believed j will result in effecting a con
tinuous line of telegraph through that Em
pire from our Pacific coast 1 recommend
to your favorable consideration the sub
ject of an international telegraph across
the Atlantic Ocean, and alsoof a telegraph
between this Capital and the National
forts i.long the Atlantic seaboard and the
Gulf of Mexico. Such eomniuuicitioiis,
established with any reasonable outlay,
would bo economical as well as effective
aids to the diplomalic, military and nava,
service.

is reason to Tope that it may becomo en

part, met aud discharged with zeal aud
efficiency. This acknowledgment justly
incluues those consuls who, residing iu

aud other Oriental countries, arc charged

I again submit to your consideration
the expediency of establishing a syttem for
tho cucouragemont of immigration, Al
though this source of natiou.il wealth nnd
strength is egaiu flowing witli greater frco
dom than for several years beloro the in
surrection oceurted, thero is still a groat
deficiency of labors in every Geld of indus
try, especially in agriculture and in our
mines, as well of iron and coal as of tho
precious metals. Whilo .the deiuaud for
labor is thus increased hero, tens of thou
sands of persons destitute of remunerative
occupation, aro thr.ongitig our foreign con
sulates and offering lo cmigrato to the
United States, if essential but very cheap
assistance can bo afforded them. It is easy
to sec that under tho sharp discipline of
civil war, tho nation is beginning a new
life. This noble effort demands tho aid
and ought to receive the attention and sup
port of tho government.
Injuries, unforsecn by the Govornmeut
and unintended, may in somo cases have
been inflicted on tho subjects or citizeus oi
forcicn countrios, both at sea and on land,
bv persons in tho service of tho United
States. As this Government expects re
dress from other powers when similar in
juries aro inflicted by persons in their ser
vice upon citizens of tho United Statcs,wo
must bo prepared to do justieo to foreign
ers. If tho existing judicial tribunals aro
inadequate to this purposo, a special court
may be authorized with power to hear and
decido such olaims of tho charaotor referred
to as may hava arisen under treaties and
the public law. Conventions for adjusting
tho claims byjoiut commisjion, have boon

a tax upon tho incomes of forcien
consuls in this country. Whilo such a
demand may not, in strictness, bo in dero
gation of public law, or herhaps of any ex
isting treaty between tho United States aud
n foreign country, tho expediency of so far
mouirying tne act as to exempt trom tax
tho income ol such consuls as are not citi
zonsof the United States derived from tho
emoluments of their ofiioc, or from proper
ty not situated in tho United Sta'cs, is sub

make this suggestion upon tho ground that
a comity which ought to be reciprocate!
exempts our consuls, in all other countries,
from taxation to the cxtont thus indicated,
iho United States, 1 think, ought not to
bo exceptionally illiberal to international
trade and commerce,
Tho operations of tho Troasury dug'ng
tho last year have been succcsslully eon
ducted. The enactment by Congress of a
National Ranking Law, has proved a val
uable support of tho public credit, and tho
general legislation in rclatiou to loans has
fully answered the expectation of its fa
vorers, borne amendments mav ho requir
ed to perfect existing laws. Rut no change
iu their principles or gonoral scope is be
lieved to bo needed.
Sinco these measures have been in oper
ation, all demands on the Treasury, iuc'ud
ing the nay of iho uriiiv aud uivy, have
been promptly met and fulUvatisfi'd. No
considerable body of troops it ts believed,
were ever more amply provided and more
liberally and punctually paid, and it may
be added thai by no people were tho bur
dens incident to a great war ever more
cheerfully borne. The receipt! during1 tho

before you, for usolul and varied informa-

affairs, patents, ponsious, ami other mat-
tors of public concern pcitaiuing to his

The quantity of land disposed of during
tho last nud the first quarters of tho pres
ent fiscal year was three million eight
hundred aud forty-ono thousand five hun
dred and forty-nine acres, of which ono
hundred aud sixty-one thousand nine hun
dred and eleven acres wero sold for cash,
ono million four hundred uud fifty-six
thousand livo huudrcd and fourteen acres
wero taken up utidcr the homestead law,
and tho residue disposed of under laws
granting lands for military bounties, for
railroad and othor purposes. It also ap
pears that the sale of tho public lands is
largely on tho increase.
It has loug been a cherished opinion of
iome of our wisest statesmen that the poo
pie of tho United States had a higher and
more cnduricg luterest iu tho early sottle-
. 1 ..-..!-! 1 .5 ii r
iBL'iu auu buusiuuiiai euiiivuiiuu ui iiiui
publio lauds than in tho amount of dircc.t
revenue to be derived from tho sale of
them. This opinion has had a controlling
influence in shaping legislation upon the
subject of our national domain, 1 may
cite, as evidence of this, the liberal meas
ures adopted iu reference to actual settlers;
tho graut to the States of tho overflowed
lauds within their limits in order to their
being reclaimed and rendered fit for culti
vation ; tho grants to railway companies
of alternate sections of land upon tho cou
templated lines of thuir roads which, when
completed, will so largely multiply the
facilities for reaching our distant posses
sions. This policy has received its most
sigual nud beueliciont illustration in the
recent enactment granting homesteads to
actual settlers. Since tho first day of
January last the belbrementioned quantity
of ono million four hundred aud lifty-six
thousand five hundred and fourteen acres
of land !nvo been taken up under its pro
visions. This fact aud the amount of
sales luruish gratifying evidence of increas
ing settlement upon tho public lands, not -
withstanding the great struggle in which
theciierg.es of tho uatio-i have been en -
gaged, mid which has required so largo a
withdrawal ot our citizens from their ac-
customed pursuits. I cordially concur in'
tho recommendation of tho Secretary of
. ,jvUiU,Uu.u,uu u, u.v-.u.j, .

tho not iu favor of those engaged in tho
military and naval sorvios ol the United
States. 1 doubt not that Congress will
cheerfully adopt such measures as will, I
without essentially changing the general
features of tho system, secure, to tho ,
greatest practical extent, its benefits to
those who havo left their homes iu defence
of tho couutry in this ardurou? crisis

to Jay bol'oro you. That this interest is ono
which, cro long, will foroo its owtijway, I
do not entertain a doubt, while it is sub

can bo done now. Augmented interest is
given to this subject by the ootual com

1 transmit tbo second annual report of
tho Commissioner of tho Department of
Agriculture, asking your attention to the ,
developments in that vital intorcst of tho
nation.
When Congress assembled a year ago
tho war had already lasted nearly twenty
months, and there had been many conflict)
on both land nnd Boa, with varyiug results.
Tho lobcllion had been pressed back into
reduced limits; yet tlia tone of publio feel
ing and opinion, homo and abroad, was
npt satisfactory. With other signs, the
popular elections, then just papt indicated
uneasiness among ourselves, whilo amid
much that was cold and menacing tho kind
est words coining from Europo were ut
tered in accents of pity, that wiro too
bliud to surrcuder a hopeless cause. Our
couimoico was suffering greatly by a few
armed vessels built upon aud furnishod
from foreign shores, and we wero threat
ened with such additions from tho same
quarter os would sweep our trade from tho
sea aud raise our blockade. WTo had fail
ed to elict from European governments au y
thine hopeful upon this subject. Tho pre
liminary emancipation proclamation issued
in September, was ruuning its assigned
period to the beginning of tho new year
A month later tho final proclamation came
including tho announcement that colored
men of suitable condition would bo receiv
ed into the war service. Tho policy of
omauoipation, and of employing black sol-
diers, gavo to the future a new aspect,
about which hope, and fear, and doubt clear constitutional power to withhold alto
contended iu uncertain conflict. According ' gcthcr, or grant upon tho terms which ho
to our political system, as a matter of , shall deem wisest for tho publio interest.

It came, aud, as was anticipated, it was
followed by dark and doubtful days.
Eleven month' having now passed, we are
permitted to tako another review. The
rebel borders aro pressed still further
back and by tho complcto opening of tho
Mississippi the countrv dominated by the
rebellion is divided into distinct parts with
practical communication between them

tho annual elections following aro highly
cucouraging to those whoso official duty it
is to bear the couutry through this great
trial. 'I bus wo havo tho now reckoning.
The crisis which threatened to divide the
friends ot tho Union is past.
Looking uow to the present and future
and with reference to a resumption ofthe
national authority within the States where
in that authority lias been suspended, I
havo thought fit fo issua a proclamation,
a copy of which is herewith transmitted.
On examination of this proclamation it will
appear, as is'bolicved, that nothing is at
tempted boyoud what is amply justified by
the Constitution. True, the form of an
oath is given, but no man is coerced to
take it Tho man is ouly promised a
pardon in case ho voluntarily takes the
oath. Tho Constitution authorizes tho
Executive to grant or withhold tho pardon
at ht3 own absolute discretion ; aud this
iucludcs the power to grant on terms, as is
hilly established by judicial aud other au
thorities.
It is also proffered that if, in any of tho
States named, a Stato government shall bo
in tho inodo proscribed, set up, such gov
ernment shall bo rocoguized and guaratl
tied by the United States, and that undj r
it tho Stato shall, on the constitutional con
ditions, be protected against invasion aud
domestio violonco, Tho constitittiorial
obligation of the United States to guaranty
to ovory Stato in tho Union a ropubli oau
form of government, and to protect tho
State, in tho cases stated, is explicit and
full. Rut why tender the benefits of this
provisions only to a Stato government set
up in this particular way? This seotion
of the Constitution contemplates a caso
whcr.ein tko elomeut within a Stato, f avor
ablo to republican government, in the
Union, may bo loo fecblo for au opposite
and hostile clement external to, ot' oven
within tho Slate : and such sra pvooisnly
the oases with which we aro now 'dealing.
An attempt to guaranty aud protoc.tla
revivod Stato government, constructed in
whole, or in prcpondering part, from tuo
very clement against whoso hostility nnd
violence it is to bo protected, is simply ab
surd. Thero must be a test by which to
scparato tho opesing elements, so as to
build only fromlio sound ; and that' lest
is a sufficiently liberal ono, which accepts
as sound whoever will make a sworn ro
cantation of his former unsoundness.
Rut if it bo proper to require, as a tost
of admission to the political body, an oath
of allegiance to tho Constitution of tho
United States, and to the Union under it,
why also to tho laws and proclamation!!
where enacted and put forth for the pur
pose of aidinging in the suppression ol tho
rebellion. Io give them their fullest effect,
thoro had to bo a pledge for their mainten
ance. In my judgment they havo aided,
and will further aid, the causo for whioli
they were intended. To now abandon
them would be not only to relinquish a
lever of power, but would also bo a cruol
and an astounding breach offaith. I may
add at this point, that while I remain iu
my present position I shall not attompt
to retract or modify tho emancipation
proclamation ; uor shall I return to sin-
very any person who is frc by tho terms
of that proclamation, or by any of the acts
of Congress. For thcso and other reason
it is thought best that support of these
measures shall be included in the oath :
, and it is believed tho Exccutivo may law-
fully claim it in return for pardon and rc-
Utoration of forfeited rights, which ho has
pie is made with tho view of possibly mod-
ifying the confusion and destitution which
must, at best, attend all elascs by a total
revolution of labor throughout whole States.
It is hoped that the already deeply afflicted
pcoplo in thoso States may be somewhat
more ready to givo up tho cause of their
affliction, if, to thisextont, this vital matter
bu left to themselves; while no power of
I the national Executive to prevent an abuse
is abridged by tho proposition.
. The suggestion in tho proclamation as
to maintaining tho political framework of
tho States ou what is called reconstruction,
is made in the hope that it may do good
without danger otharm. It will savo la-
. "or, and avoid great confusion.
Rut why any proclamation now upon
this subiect ? This nucstion is bcs-nt wiili
r.lm ennfllniinr. riowa
ueiayeu loo long or no taKcn too soon, in
c . . - . .i. i r
some omics mo ciouicim lor resumption
seem rcauy lor action, out remain inactive
apparently for want of a rallying point a
plan of action. Why shall A adopt the
plan of R, rather than B that of A? And
' if A aud R should agree, how can they
, k"w but that the general government hero
I will reject their plan '. By the proolama-
. l'n a plan is presented which may bo ac
cepted by them as a rallying poiut, and
which they aro assured iu advance will not
be rejected here. This may bring them
to act sooner than they otherwiso would.
Tho objectious to a pramaturo presenta
tion of a plan by tho national Executive
consists iu tho danger of committals on
points which could bo more safely loft to
further developments. Care has been ta
kou to so f.hape tho document as to avoid
embarrassments from this source. Saying
that, on certain terms, certain classes will
bo pardoned, with rights restored, it is
not said that other classes, or other terra3,
will never bo included. Saying that re
construction will be accepted if presented
in a specified way, it is not said it will ne
ver be accepted in any othor way.
'Ihe movements, by btato aclion, for
emancipation proclamation, aro matters of
profouivJ gratulation. Aud while I do not
repeat i n detail what I havo heretofore so
oarnest ly urged upon this subject, my gen
eral views and feelings remain unchanged ;
and I trust that Congress will omit no fair
oppoi- tunity of aiding these important steps
to a f rcat consumation.
In tho midst of other carcs,bowovcr im
portant, we must uot loso sight ofthe fact
that the war power is still our main reli
anos. To that power alono can wo look,
yd., for a time, to confidence to tho people
in the contested regions, that the insurgont
p owcr will not again ovorrun them. Until
t hat confidence shall be established, little,
, can bo dono auy whero for what is called
reconstruction. Ilonco our cbiefest caro
must still be directed to tho army and na
vy, who have thus far borne their harder
part so nobly and well.
And it may bo esteemed fortunato thot
in giving the greatest efficiency to these in
dispensable arras, wo do also honorably
reeognizo the gallant men, from comman
der to sentiticl, who composo thorn, and to
whom, moro than to others the world must
stand indobt for tho homo of freedom dis
enthralled, regenerated, enlarged and por
pctuated, ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
