the Great Questions to
Deal With.
To the Senate anil House of Represents
lives:
At the threshold of your deliberations
you are called to mourn with your coun­
trymen the death of Vice President Ho
burt, who passed frota this life on the
morning of Nov. 21st last. His great soul
now rests in eternal peace. His private
life was pure and elevated, while his pub­
lic career was ever distinguished by large
capacity, stainless iutegrity and exalted
motives. He has been removed from the
high office which lie honored and digni­
fied, but hie lofty character, his devotion
to duty, his honesty of purpose and noble
virtues remain with us as a priceless leg­
acy and example.
ConUltiou of Cnntual Froaperlty.
The Fifty-Sixth congress convenes In
Its first regular session with the country
in a condition of unusual prosperity, of
.universal good will among the people at
•home, and in relations of peace and
friendship with every govcrnment-of the
•world. Our foreign commerce has shown
igreat increase in volume and value. The
combined imports and exports for the
iyear are the largest ever shown by a sin-'
!gle year in all our history. Our exports
Sot 1899 alone exceeded by more than a
'billion dollars our imports and exports
combined in 1870. The imports per capita
are 20 per cent less than in 1870, while the
exports per capita are £8 per cent more
than in 1870, showing the enlarged ca
,pacity of the United States to satisfy the
wants of its own increasing population,
as well as to contribute to 'those of the
peoples of other nations.'
Manufactured Exports Exceed Import*.
Exports of agricultural products were
1784,770,142, Of manufactured products
we exported in value $339,693,14(3, being
larger than any previous year. It is a
noteworthy fact that the only years in all
our history when the products of 'our
manufactories sold abroad exceeded those
bought abroad were 1893 and 1899.
Government receipts from all sources
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, in­
cluding $
11,798,314.14, part payment of the
Central Pacific railroad indebtedness,
•^'-aggregated §010,962,004.35. Customs *e
ceipts were $206,128,481.75, and those from
revenue $273,437,161 ol.
For the fiscal year the expenditures
were $700,093,564:0?, leaving a deficit: «f
$89,111,559,67.
The secretary of the treasury estimates
that the reoeipts for the current fiscal
year will aggregate §640,958,113, and upon
the basis of present appropriations the
expenditures will aggregate $(00,958,112,
leaving a surplus of $10,000,000.
For the fiseal year ended June 30,1899,
the internal revenue receipts were in­
creased about $100,000,000.
strength of the Treasury.
The present gratifying strength of the
treasury is shown by the fact that on Dec.
1, 1899, the available cash balance was
1878,004,837.73, of which $239,744,905.36 was
in gold coin and bullion. The conditions
of confidence which prevail throughout
the country have brought gold into more
general use and customs receipts are now
almost entirely paid in that coin.
The strong condition of the treasury
with respcct to cash on hand and the
favorable showing made by the revenues
have made it possible for the secretary of
the treasury to take action under the
provisions of section 3095, Revised Stat­
utes, relating to the sinking fund.
BANKING ANO CURRENCY.
Cold Standard and Enlarged Powers for
National Han leu.
Increased activity in industry, with its
welcome attendant—a larger employmeut
for labor, at higher wages—gives to the
body of the people a larger power to ab­
sorb the circulating medium. It is fur­
ther true that year by year, with larger
areas of land under cultivation, the in­
creasing agricultural products, cotton,
corn and wheat, call for a larger volume
of money supply. This is especially
noticeable at the erop harvesting and
crop moving period.
In its early history the national bank­
ing act seemed to prove a reasonable
avenue through which needful additions
to the circulation could from time to time
be made. Changing conditions have ap­
parently rendered it now inoperative to
that end. The high margin in bond se­
curities required, resulting from large
premiums which government bonds com­
mand in the market, or the tax on note
Issues, or both operating together, appear
to be the influences which impair its pub­
lic utility.
The attention of congressisrespectfully
Invited to this important matter with the
view of ascertaining whether or not such
reasonable modifications can bo made in
the national banking net as will render
its service in the particulars here referred
lo more responsive to the people's needs.
again urge that national banks be au­
thorized to organize with a capital of
185,000.
Gold Standard Should lie Maintained.
I urgently recommend that to support
the existing gold standard, and to main­
tain "the parity in value of the coins of
the two metals (gold and silver) and the
equal power of every dollar at all times
in the market and la the oavment of
debts." the secretary of the treasury be
given additional power and charged with
(he duty to sell United States bonds and
to employ such other effective means as
may be necessary to these ends. .The au­
0
.''- .'
ir
thority snotua include tne power to sell
bonds on long and short time,
as
condi­
tions may require, and should provide for
41 rate of interest lower than that fixed by
the act of Jan. 14, 1875.
Our receipts now equal our expendi­
tures deficient revenues no longer create
ularm. Let us remove the only remain­
ing cause by conferring the full and nec­
essary power on the secretary of the treas­
ury and impose upon him the duty to up­
hold present gold standard and preserve
the coins of the two metals on a parity
with each other, which is the ropeatedly
declared policy of the United States.
In this connection I repeat my former
recommendations that a portion of the
gold holdings shall be placed in a trust
fund from which greenbacks shall bo re­
deemed upon presentation, but when once
redeemed shall not thereafter be paid out
except for gold.
The Merchant Marine.
The value of an American merchant
marine to the extension of our commer­
cial trade and the strengthening of our
power upon the sea invites the immediate
action of congress. Our national devel­
opment will be one-sided and unsatis­
factory so long as the remarkable growth
of our inland industries remains unac­
companied by progress on the seas.
THE TRUST QUESTION.
'Concres* Should Thoroughly Investi­
gate and Apply Kerned lea.
Combinations of capital organized
to control the conditions of trade among
our citizens, to stifle competition, limit
production and determino the price of
products used and consumed by the peo­
ple, are justly provking public discussion,
and should early claim the attention of
the congress.
The industrial commission, created by
the act of the congress of June 18, 1898,
has been engaged in extended hearings
upon the disputed questions involved in
the subject of combinations in restraint
of trade and competition. They have not
yet completed their investigation of this
subject, and the conclusions and recom­
mendations at which they may arrive are
undetermined.
The subject is one giving rise to many
divergent views as to the nature and
variety or cause and extent of the injuries
to the public which may result from large
combinations concentrating more or less
numerous enterprises and establishments,
which previously to the formation of the
combination were carried on separately.
It is universally conceded that combin­
ations which engross or control the mar­
ket of any particular kind of merchandise
or commodity neoessary to the general
community, by suppressing natural and
ordinary competition, whereby prices are
unduly enhanced to the general consumer,
are-obnoxious not only to the common
law but also to the public welfare. There
must be a remedy for the evils involved in
such organizations. If the present law
can be extended more certainly ta control
or check those monopolies or trusts, at
she
aid be done without delay. Whatever
power the congress possesses over this most
important subject should be promptly
ascertained and asserted.
Quotations are made from the annual
message of President Harrison Dec. 3,
1889, and thatof President Cleveland Dec.
7, 1896, the foraner recommending a law
for the better control of such combina­
tions, and the latter, commenting upon
the law enacted in 1890, questioning
whether the Federal jurisdiction in the
matter is sufficient, Continuing the
president says:
The state legislation to which Presi­
dent Cleveland looked for relief from the
evils of trusts has failed to accomplish
fully that object This is probably due
to a great extent to the fact that different
states take different views as to the proper
way to'discriminate between evil and in­
jurious combinations find those associ­
ations which are beneficial and necessary
to the business prosperity of the country.
The great diversity ol' treatment in differ­
ent states arising from this cause and the
intimate relations of all parts of the conn
try to each other without regarding state
lines in the conduct of business have made
the enforcement of state laws difficult.
It is apparent that uniformity of legis­
lation upon .this subject in the several
states is much to be desired. It is to be
hoped that such uniformity, founded in a
wise and just discrimination between
what- is injurious and what is useful and
necesrary in business operations, may be
obtained, and that means may be found
for the congress within the limitations of
its constitutional power so to supplement
an effective code of state legislation as to
make a complete system of laws through­
out the United States adequate to compel
a general observance of the salutary rules
to which J. have referred.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Frlendlinen* Hs Characterised Deallnjr*
With Other Nation*.
A review of our relations with foreign
states is presented with such^recommen­
dations as are deemed appropriate. Many
of the references are to minor incidents
and events in states on this continent.
Our increasing intimate relations with
Germany are cited at considerable length,
the history of Nicaragua canal negotia­
tions urine the uast year is aivim. ami
the appointment ol a new commission de­
tailed Good progress has been made by
this commission, but under the law a
comprehensive and complete investigation
is culled for, which will require much
labor and considerable time for its accom­
plishment. The work will be prosecuted
as expeditiously as possible, and a report
made at the earliest practicable date.
The great importance of this work can­
not bo too often or too strongly pressed
upon the attention of the congress In
my message of a year ago I expressed my
views of the necessity of a canal which
would link the two great oceans, to which
I again invite your consideration. The
reasons then presented for early action
are even stronger now.
Alaskan Boandary and Other Matters
In my last annual message I referred to
the pending negotiations with Great Brit­
ain in respect to the dominion of Canada
Bv means of an executive agreement a
joint high commission had been created
for the purpose of adjusting all unsettled

ENNERSOALE
F*DUHNFO
Apant from those questions growing out
of our relationship with our nothern
neighbor, the most friendly disposition
and ready agreement have marked the
discussion of numerous matters arising in
the vast.and intimate intercourse of the
United States with Great Britain.
This government has maintained an at­
titude of .neutrality in the unfortunate
contest between Great Britiin and the
Boer states of Africa We have remained
faithful to the precept of avoiding en­
tangling alliances as to affairs not of our
direct concern. Had cirjumstanijes sug­
gested that the parties to the -quarrel
would have welcome any kindly •expres­
sion of the fcopa of the American people
thiifc war might be averted, good offices
would have been gladly tendered.
Violeuoe A^aiunt Aliens.
For the fourth time in the present de­
cade question bas arisen with the govern­
ment of Italy in regard to the lynching of
Italian subject*'. The latest of these de­
plorable events
.occurred at Tallulah, -La.,
whereby five unfortunates, of Italian
.origin, were taken from jail and hanged.
Because of defective federal jurisdiction
the president recommends legislation
giving federal courts power of prosecution
in similar cases.
Tile Pacific Cable.
"Without repeating the observations af
my special message of Feb. 10. 169!), con­
cerning the necessity of a cable to Manila,
I respectfully invito attention „to it. 1
recommend that in case the congress
should not take measures to bring about
this result by direct action of the govern
ment, the postmaster general be author
ized to invite competitive bids for tho
establishment of a cable the company
making the best responsible bid to be
awarded the contract the successful
company to give ample bonds to insure
the completion of the work within a rea
sonable time
OUR DUTY TOWARD CUBA
Pledget of Congrefti Should be Faltlt
fullv l£xecutetl.
My annual message of last year was
necessarily devoted in great part to a con­
sideration of the Spanish war and of the
results it wrought and the conditions it
imposed for the future. I am gratified to
announce that the treaty of peace has re­
stored friendly relations between the two
powers. Effect has been given to its most
important provisions. The evacuation of
Porto Rico haviiu already been accom­
plished on the IStn of October, ls98, noth­
ing remained necessary there but to con­
tinue the provisional military control of
the island until tho congress should enact
a suitable government for the ceded ter­
ritory. Of the character and scope of the
measures to that end I shall treat in
another part of this message.
The withdrawal of the authority of
Spain from tho island of Cuba was ef­
fected by the first of January, so that the

WAP OF ESTCOURT AND VICINITY.
Estcourt is 43 miles from Ladysmith, and when the war began was a village of less
than 300 inhabitants. Since then it has held an encampment, of more than 10,000
troops and has been one of the rallying points for the force sent to the relief of Lady
smith. General Hildyard was placed in command of the troops mobilized at Estcourt.
questions between the Unit-oil States and
Canada, embracing twelve subjects,
nmong which were the questions of the
fur seals, the fisheries of the coast and
contiguous inland waters, the Alaskan
boundary, the transit of merchandise in
bond, the alien labor laws, mining rights,
reciprocity in trade, revision of the agree­
ment respecting naval vessels in the Great
Lakes, a more complete marking of parts
of the boundary, provision for the con­
veyance of criminals, and for wrecking
and salvage.
Much progress had been made by
the commission toward the ad­
justment of many of these ques­
tions where it became apparent that
an irreconcilable difference of views was
entertained respecting the delimitation of
the Alaskan boundary. In the failure of
an agreement as to the meaning of arti­
cles 3 and 4 of the treaty of 1835 between
liussia and Great Britain., which defined
the boundary between Alaska and Can­
ada, the American commissioners pro­
posed that the subject of the boundary
be laid aside and that .the .remaining
questions of difference be proceeded
With, some of which were so far
advanced as to assure the .probability
af a settleia&vt. This being de­
clined by the British commissioners, an
adjournment was taken until the boun­
dary should lit adjustei by the two gov­
ernments. The subject has been receiv­
ing tho careful attention which its im­
portance demands, with the result that a
modus vivendi tor provisional demarca­
tions in the region about the head of
Lynn canal has been agreed upon and it
is hoped that the negotiations now in
progress betweaE the two governments
will end in an agreement for the estab­
lishment and delimitation of a permanent
boundary.

the direction of the executive, such gov­

ductive conditions of peace so long dis­
turbed by the instability and disorder
which prevailed for the greater part of the
preceding three decades, and build up

high purpose, as proclaimed in the joint
resolution adopted by the congress on the
10th of April, ISsIS, by which the nitecl
Suites disclaimed any disposition or in
vsntion to exercise sovereiiruu- iurirdic
tion or control over Cuba, except tor tne
pacification thereof, and asserted its de­
termination when that was accomplished
to leave the government and control of
the island to its people. The pledge con­
tained in this resolution is of the highest
honorable obligation and
JIutt Be *»crelly Kept.
This nation has assumed before tho
world a grave responsibility for the future
good government of Cuba. Wo have ac­
cepted a trust the fulfillment of which
ca.ls for the sternest integrity of purposes
and the exercise of the highest wisdom.
On the 7th of August last an order was
"made for the taking of tho census of the
island, to be completed on the -0th of No­
vember. By the treaty of peace the Span­
ish people on the island have until April
11, 190J, to elect whether they will remain
citizens of Spain or become citizens of
Cuba. Until then it cannot be definitely
ascertaine! who shall be entitled to par­
ticipate in the formation of tne govern­
ment of Cuba. By that time the results
of the census will have been tabulated and
we shal
1 proceed to provide tor election?
which will commit the municipal govern­
ments of the island to the officers elected
by the people. The experience thus ac
quired will prove of great value in the
formation of a representative convention
of the people to draft a constitution and
estublisn a general s.'stem of independent
government tor the islanl.
I'Hrtitiuu of Samoa.
The re.ent troubles in Samoa are re
viewed by the president, and the exchange
of views leading up to the partition of the
islands reviewed. Concluding the presi­
dent says:
Our views commended themselves to
the other powers. A satisfactory ar­
rangement was concluded between the
governments of Germany and of England
bv virtue of which England retired from
Samoa in view of compensations in other
directions, and both powers renounced in
favor of the United States all their rights
and claims over and in respect to that
portion of the group lying to the east of
the 171st degree of wesi longitude, em­
bracing the islands of Tutuila, Ofoo,
Olesenga and Mauna. I transmit to the
senate lor its constitutional action there­
on a convention which, besides the pro­
visions above mentioned, also guarantees
us the same privileges and conditions in
respect to commerce and commercial
vessels in all of the islands of Samoa as
those possessed by Germany.
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.
Medals for Volunteers, Postal SerTice,
the Gallant Navy, Pensions.
The president details the reorganization
of the army and recommends that con
gross provide a special medal of honor
lor the volunteers, regulars, sail rs and
marines on duty in the Philippines who
voluntarily remained in the service after
tlu'it' terms of enlistment had expired.
The force now in Manila consists of 90"i
fcllieei's and oJ,578 regulars and 6D1 oilicert
and of tho volunteers, making an
ncLrreg.-vte of l.W. oitieers and -lo.i' it! men.
When the troops n.^v untr orders shall
reach Manila, the I'I-IV.1 in the arehi :e a-jro
will comprise ~,U5i oliicers and li l, 1
men.
The operations of the army are fully
presented in the report of the secretary of
war. I cannot withh ld from ollicers and
the highest commendation for their
soldiery conduct in trying situations, their
willing sacrllic.'s for their country and
the iutegrity and ability with which they
have performed unusual and difficult du­
ties in our island possessions.
Domettlc Postal Service.
The domestic postal service continues

in His Favor.
Petition of PennsylvaniaLegis

Chairman Taylor Calls a Meet­
ing to Consider the Case
of Roberts.
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.—A special to The.
Herald from Washington says:
As a result of a canvass made by Mr.
Quay's friends since the senate con­
vened, it is asserted that 46 of the 85
senators will vote to seat him as sena­
tor from Pennsylvania. These figures
are obtained by counting the 30 senators
now in the senate who voted either for
Corbett or Mantle and 16 others from
whom it is asserted promises have been
obtained favorable to Mr. Quay.
Senator Chandler has called a special
meeting of the committee on elections
to consider the case of Mr. Quay.
As a vacancy exists on the committee,
however, and the two parties are ar­
ranging for the reorganization of all
thecommittees.it is not believed the
Quay case will be disposed of until the
committee has been reorganized.
The fact that a majority of the Penn­
sylvania legislature, Republicans and
Democrats, have petitioned the senate
against the seating of Mr. Quay will be
used for all its worth by his opponents,
and the contest will be bitter and long.
HEARING FOR ROBERTS.
Representative Tayler Calls a Sleeting
of His Committee.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.—Representa­
tive Tayler of Ohio, chairman of a spe­
cial committee to investigate the case
of Mr. Roberts of Utah, has called a
meeting for the committee at 11 o'clock.
Mr. Tayler says the initial meeting will
be to determine upon a general line of
action. He could not say how soon the
committee would be ready to report.
While the chairman would not speak
for the committee, he said he had no
doubt that Mr. Roberts could be al­
lowed to be present with counsel if he
desired and would be afforded the full­
est facilities to have his side presented.
Mr. Roberts was about the house
during the day. There was no session
and he was engaged most of the time
in chatting with groups of memhers
and visitors who showed a friendly dis­
position toward him.

sugar factories in California, Oregon,
Washington, Nebraska, Colorado,
Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan,
Illinois, Ohio and New York attended

Beet Sugar Manufacturers' association.
The industry was reported as having
flourished during the past few years,
but that just now it is greatly disturbed
over the prospect of free sugar from
the insular dependencies.
The association took strong grounds
against President McKinley's recom­
mendation of free sugar and adopted
emphatic resolutions iigainst such a
policy and provided for a vigorous cam­
paign in behalf of their desires.

FROM LADYSMITH
Garrison There, Though Still
Stioiig", SuttVriuj from
Confinement..
LONDON. Dec. 7.—A budget of news
from Ladysmith which has just arrived
brings the history of the beleagured
garrison up to Nov. 29. In spite of the
rumors of a retrogade movement upon
the part of the Boers, the stories just,
received show that the garrison, al­
though still strong, was suffering from
coufinement, restricted diet and the in-'
creasing volume of the artillery fire*
especially that of an additional heavy
calibre gun placed in position 5,00FT
yards from the western defenses. The
dispatches relate that the Boers had
discovered the most vulnerable points.
of the garrison and that shelling was
becoming disagreeably offective. The
rations had been reduced and there was
a great deal of sickness. Nevertheless^
the troops of the garrison were in every­
way preparing to meet the assault
which it was anticipated the Boers,
would carry out in a
Final Effort to Reduce the City.
The belief was current in Ladysmith
that the Boers were preparing for a ret­
rograde moveinement after another at­
tack. Several bodies of burghers were
reported to have been seen Nov. 28,
moving in the direction of the Drakens
burg range, while, Nov. 29, detach­
ments were observed journeying north­
ward with the wagons. Discord be­
tween the Transvaalers and Free Staters
was also reported. There was no indi­
cation. however, that the Boers were
preparing to dismantle their gun posi­
tions, but the idea was prevalent in
some quarters of Ladysmith that the
