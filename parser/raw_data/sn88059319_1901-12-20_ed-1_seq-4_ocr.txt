Resolution Introduced by Represen
tative Wheeler (Ky.) for In
vestigation of the Matter.
REPRESENTATIVE MUDD'S RESOLUTION.
Bxpreun TUnnki of Coiitii-emi and
American People to Seliley and His
••Men lor Victory nt SantlaKO—
Sclilcy'N Attorney lliiHy Preparing
XJill of Objections.
Washington, Dec, 18.—Representa
tive Wheeler, of Kentucky, has in
troduced in the house a resolution
to investigate the conduct of Rear
Admiral Schley from the time he
took command of the flying squad
ron up to and including the destruc
tion of the Spanish fleet, July 3, 1898.
It recites the action of the court,
of inquiry and declares the Ameri
can people desire an investigation by
citizens not connected with the navy
department.
Another Resolution.
Representative Mudd, of Maryland,
also introduced a resolution relative
to Admiral Schley us follows:
"Resolved, That the thanks of congress
arid of the American people are hereby ten
dered to Rear Admiral Wlnfield Scott
Schley and the officers and men under his
command for the-ir victory over the Span
ish forces and the destruction of the Span
ish fleet In the naval battle off Santiago de
Cuba, July 3, 1898."
Mr. Mudd says the resolution is not
the result of any concerted action by
the Maryland delegation and repre
sents his individual views.
Two democrats, Messrs. Yandiver
(Mo.) and Cooper (Tex.), attempted
to interrupt Chairman l'ti^ne in his
motion that the house go into com
mittee of the whole for considera
tion of the Philippine tariff bill with
wMfUAsts for unanimous consent to
consider Schley resolutions, but Mr.
Payne declined to yield.
Mr. Cooper's resolution declared
Schley in command and entitled to
credit for the victory at Santiago and
directed that he be placed on the
active list with the rank he held be
fore retirement.
Mr. Vandiver's resolution recites
that the language of the court of in
quiry reflected upon Admiral Schley
and calls for an investigation by
seven members of the house, which
shall investigate what injustice has
been done and whether envy, jealousy
or other factional feelings exist
among naval officers and what remely
should be applied.
Preparing IH11 of Objection!!.
Washington, Dee. 18.—Hon. Isidor
Rayner and Mr. 'league, counsel and
assistant counsel, respectively, for
Admiral Schley during the court of in
quiry, have gone to Baltimore, and are
busily engaged in that city with the
preparation of the statement of objec
tions to the court's findings which Ad
miral Schley has been granted permis
'Bion to file with the reviewing author
ity, Secretary Long. This work is ex
pected to occupy them for several days.
Senator McComas, of Maryland,
called at the navy department Tues
day and had a long talk with Secretary
Long before the latter departed for
the cabinet meeting. It is understood
that the senator came to the depart
ment for the purpose of securing an ex
tension by several days of the time al
lowed by Secretary Long for the sub
mission of the statement if it appears
that the admiral's counsel cannot prop
erly prepare their document in time.
Representative Norton, of Ohio,
Tuesday introduced a resolution pro
posing the restoration of Admiral
Schley to the active list.
Long? Gives More Time.
Secretary Long Tuesday afternoon
informed Senator McComas that he
would grant Admiral Schley's attor
neys an extension of 24 hours from the
time originally allowed them for the
submission of their statement. This
will make the time expire Thursday
at four o'clock.
Stayton and Moore, who appeared
before the court of inquiry as attor
neys for Admiral Sampson, have ap
plied to Secretary Long for permission
to be heard in protest against the ap
proval by the secretary of the minority
report written by Admiral Dewey and
appended to the majority report of the
court of inquiry. The secretary has
consented to receive any papers they
may care to submit.
