AN IMPORTANT COAL, DEAL
A very important coal deal was
made a few days ago between Hon.
Patrick Hagan, of Scott county, ai.d
tbo Powell River Coal and Coke Co.,
the latter having leased all the coal
on Mr. I lagan's lands between Pow?
ell's and Guest's rivers. This terri?
tory embraces several thousand acres
of coal land and, together with the
lands already owned by the company,
comprises the most valuable coal
holds iu Wise county if not iu all
this great coal region.
Tue company is making prepara?
tion to begin mining operations soon.
A tunnel is being driven by two
shifts of bands working night and
day. A large number of carpenters
are putting up bouses as fust as pos
sible for the accommodation of the
hands who will be smployed soon to
mine, cuke and ship the con). The
L. & N. It R. Co. will begin soon
i lie construction of n brunch line up
the liver to the mines. It will be
about four miles long and will meet
the main line about one fourth of a
mile wast of West Norton Hotel.
It is believed that this deal will
have an important bearing on the
town of Norton. A steady increase
of population an J influx of capital
are looked for.
With immense coal veins opeuing
up ou two sides of the town by
strong companies, together with oth?
er enterprises nnd business projects
looking this way, we think ?npt. Me
Cormick iu justified in saying that
"iu six months we will uot know
Norton."?Norton Herald.
TAZET?
PROPHECY ON THE FORCE
BILL. ?
PuBLI3RKO in Tula Paper in 1890,
Which has Come bo Absolutely
True That We Now Republish.
Tbo first streaks of light are dawn
I ing upou the political darkness that
has cast a shadow over our land for
. so luauy years.
The darkuess that bos converted
? men of intolleet into demagogues
aud tbo masses of the people into
j howling rubbles is passing away; and
a power stronger thau brute forco,
' and mightier thau armed men is at
work.
I The power that placed General
Grant at tbo head of tbo grandest
armed force tbe world bas evor known
{and Mr. Harrison in tbo capital of a
' nation that huvo known aught but
tho glories of triumph, admonishes
ull men aud all parlios tbut tyrants
aud tyranny cannot find a congenial
soil or climate in tbo laud of Amori
; can liberty. Tbnt same force bas
, wakened into life tho peaceful culti
vators of tbe field, and the busy arti?
sans of the workshops. Tho colored
race, now wiser than their slothful
siren, can no longor bo duped by
false promises nor fierce incendiary
speeches. Tbat same power is
abroad everywhere, aud all on whom
, oue glimmer of light has fallen, all in
j whom oiio generous desiro cnn bo
I kindled will speak in that voice which
conquers wrongs aud despises op?
pression.
That monstrous outrage, tbe force
bill, was but tbe natural child of lux?
ury, blinded by arrogancejand deaf?
ened by avarice. But thank God at
its birth its infant wail was heard all
over this land from Maine to Cali?
fornia, and thousands of men whom
before its infamous birth remained
quietly at home during political con?
tests, will in the future bo linked to
any party that opposeB tyranny, nnd
await but the opportunity to show
tbat parties to rule our country must
be ruled by tbo people.
The birth of the force bill voic.cn
the death of the party that gave it
birth.
Tbe party tbat will iu their arro?
gance set at naught tho will cf tho
people, will loso their cause by their
own rashness. Hut we tremble at
tbe storm the enactment of such a
bill will raise; for we know it cannot
succeed unless it bo purchased with
blood. Our fathers were freemen,
and will the people now have their
liberty stolen from them by fraud, or
wrung from them by fierce bnnds
without a struggle ? Will tbe people
that gave a party power be outraged
by such a compensation for the pow?
er they gave 1
It is not iu the power of presidents
and seuutes to make our nation great
and glorious; there is but one way to
maintain our greatness, and that is
by the voico of a free people. Tbe
American ballot, box does not like
tbe air inhaled between bristling
bayonets, aud damauds freedom, the
lawful heritage purchased by the
blood of our fathers; and the people
will not allow it filched from tbem by
auy pnrty or power.
Mr. Reed, who fills tbe bonorablo
position of the speaker's chair, or?
dained to presorve order and give
"equal privileges to all and special
privileg.-B to none," bas instituted
aggression and misrule in its stead.
But when liberty is threatened tbe
people will unite in oue cause; death
to tyranny and life to our republic
will be the watchword. Tbe great
Republican party, once the prido aud
glory of half the freemen of our na
tion, has become intoxicated with its
own power, and in its drunkenness
and thirst for more is squandering
tbe money wrung from tbe people by
! unjust taxation; and tbe vicious de
vices of their party leaders have mor
j titled and insulted tho liberal hand
j of love in their eager pursuit for per
j petuation in power; and that same
hand will, at tbe ballot box, in 1892,
resent tbe insult; and in ths death of
"the Republican party wo read tbe re?
generation of American politics.?Ab
