OUR KOUKIOM RELATIONS.
Tbs correepoiulf uco touching furoigo aQairt
w Licit bat taken place during tbo last Tear,
ii( herewith aubm.tted, in viitual compliance
wit!i a request to that effect, made by (be
Houro of liepresentatives near the close of the
past sosbiou of CongrcHS. If tbo condition of
our relations with other nations i b8i gratify
ing Ibun it lias usually been at other penodd
it Las cer in inly been more satisfactory than a
nation so unhappily detracted as we are.
might have reasonably apprehended.
In the mouth of June last thera were sorao
rcasous to think that the maratime powers
which at tLe bosinniaz of o ir domcMic difli-
cullies o unwisely and so unuccu6efully ns we
think, ncogirz..i the inurgunls as a belliger
ent power, would soon recude from that poi
tion which bus proved only loss injurious to
ihumselvc", tlmn to c.ir own country, but the
temporary revetscs which uftc-rwhrJ Lefel tie
national nrm aud wLich were ex iggorato by
cur on dihloyal cil.'reus abroa have hitherto
dilyed that act of si inple jueliuo.
Tbo civil war which has so rad cally chang
ed for the moment tl.e occupations and habits
of the Ameiican p ople. ha ihci fsarily dis
lurbed the social condition and i.HVcted very
deeply the prospciity of tho nations with
which wo Iiavc cariied on a coiumrrco that
has been steadily iccreaf.ing iLroughout a .
liodofbalf k ceuiury. It has at the same
ti n excited poli ical ambitions mid appichen
Bioi.s n Lich Lave piuducid a profound ajila
tion throughout the civilized woild.
In this uuusual agitation we have forborne
taking part in any controversy between parties
and facuons in any such Slates. We have
altempud no piopagandism and acknowledg
ed no ic tolution, but we havo Lift to every
nation tho exclusive conduct and management
of iis own affaiis. Our etiuggle has been of
course contemplated by foreign nations with
refer lice less to iis own merits than to its
supposed and tflun exaggerated effects and
the consequences resulting to those nation
themselves. 2'eveith les, comphi'nt on the
part of the government, even if it wro just,
would certainly be unwise.

, AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION.
1 nave propos u to somo ot the lorergn t
States thus interested, mutual conventions lo
examine and adjust such complaints. This
proposition I. as been made especially to (Jret
Uritain, to France, to Spaiu and to Prussia,.
Iu each caso it has been kindly received, but
has not yet been formally accepted.
TNE CAf-K OF A NORWEGIAN BARK.
I deem ii my duty to recommend an appro
piiation in behalf of the owners of the Norwo
gisn bark Admiral P. Forciens Iliola, which
vessel was in May 1801, prcvrtiited by tho
commander of the blockading fotco ff Cl.ar
lesion, from leaving that port with a cargo,
notwithstanding a similar privilego had short
ly before been graotod to an English ve )l.
I have directed tho Secretary of Statu to cause
tho papers in the caso lo bo coinmuaic.tto 1 o
the proper committeo.
AFRICAN EMIGRATION.
Applications have been tnsde tome by ma
ny fieo Americans of African descent to favor
their emigration, with a view to sji'Ii cjloni
zat'un as was contemplated in recent nets of
Congress. Other parlies at home nu 1 abroad,
some from interested motives, others upon
talriotic principles, and still others influenced
y philanthropic sentiments, havo snggestel
eiitiihr measures; whilo ott tho other band,
several cf tbo Spanish American Kepublics
hare protested against the ten ling of such
colonies to their respective territories.
. Under these circumstances, 1 have declined
to move any such colony to any Siate without
first obtaining the consct I if iis Government,
with an agreement on its part to receive and
protect such emigrar.ts in all their rights is
freemen, and I have, al the same time, offered
lo tho several Slates situated in the tropics, or
having colonies there, to negociato with them,
enljrrl to the advice and consent of tho Sen
ate, to favor the voluntary emigration of por
tions of that class to their respective Territo
lics, upon conditions which shall bo equal, jutt
and humano.
Liberia and Ilaytl, are yet the only countries
to which colouisfs of African descent from
here, could go v lib a ccilainty of Ik ing receiv
d nnd adopted as citizens, and I rrgiel to say
tint such persons, contemplating colonization,
do not 8ieni si willing to emigrate to these
rouatrics as to somo others, nor so willing as
I think their interest demand. I believe,
however, that the opinion is improving, aud
that, ete lopg, thero will b nn nugmenled
and considerable emigration to both these
countries from the Unitod Stales,
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS. .
Ihe new commercial treaty between tho
United States and the Sultan of Turkey has
been carried into execution. A commercial
and consular treaty has been negotiated, sub
ject to tho Senate s cousent, with Liberia, and
a similar negoiiatioo js now pending with the
Republic of llayti. A considerable improve
ment of the national commerce is expected to
result from these measures. Our relation!
with Great Dritain, Frai.cc, Spain, Portugal,
Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, and
Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome and tho
other Euiopeao Slates, remain undistuibed.
V cry favorahlo relations also continue to bo
maintained with Turkey, Morocco. China ard
Japan.
OCR NEIGHBORING NATIONS.
During the last year thero has not only
been no changi of our previous relations with
the Independent States of our Continent, but
more friendly sentiments than have been here
tofore existing are believed to be entertained
by those ueighbors whose safety and progress
are so intimately connected with our own.
This statement especially applies to Mexico,
Costa llica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru and
Chili. The commission under the convention
with tho Republic of New Granada closed its
session without having audited and passed
upon all the claims which were submitted to
it. A proposition is pending to revive the
convention that it may bo xble to do more
complete justice. The commission between
the United Slates and tho Republic of Costa
Rica has completed its labors and submitted its
report.
INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH.
I have favorol tl.e project of connecting the
United States with Euiope by an Atlantic
telegraph, and a similar pr j-ct to extend tho
telegraph from Sn Franciseo to connect by a
Pacifiic telegraph tviro with the wire that is
being extended across the Itustian nnpire.
OUR TERRITORIES.
The Territories of the United Slates, with
unimportant exceptions, have remained undis
tuibed by tho civil war, and they are exhibit
ing such evidence of prosperity as justifies an
expectation that somo of item will soon be in
a cond lion to bo organized as States, and be
constitutionally admitted into the Fod'ral
Union .
Tho immense mineral resources of somo bf
theso Territories ought to be developed as
rapidly asdossiblo. Every step in that direc
tion would have n tendeLcy to improve the
revenues of Oovernrnont and diminish the
burdens of tho proplo.
A SCIENTIFIC EXrLORATIoN.
I' is woilhy of your serious consideration
whether some extraordinary measure to pio
mold that end car.net be adopted. The mea
suro which suggert itself as most likely to be
effective is p scientific exploration of the min
eral regions in thoso Territories, with a view
to the publication of its results at home, and
in foreign countries -results which cannot fail
to be auspicious,
NATIONAL FINANCES.
Tho condition of tho fiutnecs will claim
your most diligent consideration. The v.ist
expendiluies incidental to the military nnd
naval operations required for ihe suppression
of tho rebellion have been met with n promp
titude and certainty unusual in similar circum
slancas, and tho public credi. has been fully
maintained.

EVILS OF FLUCTUATION.
Fluctuations in the value of currency are
always injurious, and to icduco these fluctua
tions lo the lowest possible point, will always
bo a leading purposo in wise legislation.
Prompt and certain convertibility into coin is
generally acknowledged to bo the bot and
surjst against thorn, nd it is extremely doubt
ful whether n circulation of Unitod Slatts
note, payable ia coin, and sufficiently largo
for tho wants of the people, can bi permanent
ly, usefully mid safely maintained. Is '.hero
any other m.-dium which tho necessary provi
sion for the publie wants can bo made, and
tho great advantages of a safe and nu:form
currency secured !
A REMEDY PROPOSED.
I know of none which promises so certain
results, and at tho samo lime so unobjection
able as the organization of banking associa
tions under a general act of ' Congress well
guarded in its provisions. To such associa
tions tho government might furnish circulat
ing notes on the 6eruriiy of United Slates
bonds deposited io the treasury. These notes
prepared under tho suj crviion of proper offi
cers being uniform in appearance, and sicuri
ty and convertible always with coin, would at
once protect labor against the evils of a vis
cioui currency, and facilitate commcrco by
cheap and safe exchanges. . A moderate reter
vation from tho interest on tho bonds would
compemalo tho United States for tho prenara
tion and distribution of tho notes, and a'gen
eral supervision of the system, would lighten
the burden of that part of the public debt
employed as security. The public credit,
moreover, would bo greatly improved, and the
negotiation of now loaus greatly facilitated by
tho steady market demand for government
bonds, which the adoption of tho proposed
system would create. It is an additional re
commendation of tho measure, of considerable
weight in tny judgement, that il would re
concile, as far ns possible, all exiiling interests
by the opportunity offered to existing institu
tions, for a secured uniform national circula
tion in place of tho local and various circula
tion, secured aod unsecured, tow issued by
thcio.
THE TREASURY EXHIBIT.

WAR AND KAVr REP:RTS.
The reports of the Sec clary of the Navy
aod War, are herewith transmitted Theso
reports, though lengthy, are scarcely moro
than brief extracts of the very numerous and
extensive transactions nnd operations conduct
d through theso departments, nor could I

shorter than the reports themselves. ,
I thcreforo content myself with laying the
reports before you, and asking your attention
to them.
TUE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
It gives roe pleasure to report a decided im
provement in the financial condition of the
Post Office Department as compared with the
several preceding years. The receipts for the
fiscal year 1861, amounted to 8,349,296 40
which embraced the revenue from all States
of tho Union for three quarters of that year.
Notwithstanding Hie cessation of revenue from
the so called Confederate Stales during the
last fiscal year, the increase of tho correspond
ence of tho loyal States, has been sufficient to
produce a revenue during the samo year of
$8,299,820 90, being only $50,000 less than
was derived from all the States of tho Union
the previous year.
Tho expenditures show a still more favor
able result. The amount expended in 1861
was $13,606,780 11. For the last year ihe
amount has been reduced to $11,125,364 13,
showing a difference of about $2,487,000 in
ihe expenditures, as compared with the pre
ceding year, or about $3,750,000, ns compar
ed with the fiscal year of 1860.
The deficiency in the f epnrtment for the
previous year was 5,551,966 98. For tho
last fiscal year it wns reduced to 2,112,814,
57. These favorable results are, in fact, ow
ing to the csilion of m-il sonvoyance in

EFriCIENCr PCSTAI. CONVENTION.
The efficiency of tho postal scrvico it is be
lieved has nl.i been much improved. Tho
Postmaster General als opened a correspond
ence, through the Department of Slate, with
Foreign Govern ments. proposing a Conven
tion of postal representatives, for the purpose
of simply ing the rates of foreign postage and
to expedite the foreign mail. This proposi
tion, equally imporiani to o r aaopiea citi
zens and to tho commercial interests cf this
country, has been favorably entertained and
sgieed to buy all tho Government from whom
replies have been received. I ask tho atten
tion of Congress to tho suggestion of tho Post
master General in his report respecting the
further legislation required iu bis opinion for
tho benefit of the postal service.
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.
The Secretary of the Interior report as fol
lows iu regard to public lands:
The public lands have ceased to be a source
of levenue. From the lt of July, 1 861, to
iho 30lh of September, 1862, the entire cash
receipts from tha sales of public lands were
137,477 20 a sura much less than the ex
penses of our laud system during the same po
riod.
The homestead law, which will tske effect
on lbs 1st of January next, ffen such induce
ments to settlers that sales for cash cannot be
expected to an extent sufficient to meet tho
cxpeuses of tho general land office, nnd cost of
surveying and bringing tho land into markot.
The discrepancy between tho sums here
stated as arising from the sales of public lands
and the sums derived from the samo source
as reported fnm the Treasury Department
arises as I understand fro n the- fact tLat the
periods of time, though apparently, were not
really coincident at the beginning point. The
Treasury report includes a considerable sura
now which had previously beon reported from
the Interior sufficiently hrgo to greatly over
reach the sum der ved from the three months
now reported upon by the InUrior, and not
by the Treasury Department,
, THE INDIAN WAR,
Tbo Indian tribes upon our frontiers have,
during the past year, tnauifestcd a spirit of
insubordination, and, at several points, ongsg
ed in open hostilities against the white set
tiers in their vicinity. The tribes occupv ing
the Indian country south of Kansas renounc
ed their allegiance to the United Slates, and
entered into a It caty . with tbs insurgents.
Those who remained loyal to tho United
States were driven from the country. The
chief of the Cherokees has visited this city for
the purpose of restoring the former relations
of the tribe with the Unitod States. He al
leges that they were constrained by superior
force to enter into treaties with the insurgents
and that tho United States neglected to fur
nish tho protection which their stipulations re
quired.
THE MINNESOTA MASSACRE.
Tn the month of Auc'ist last, the Sioux In
diana in Minnesota attacked lh ttlar in
their viclniiy with extreme forocilv. killins
indiscriminately men, women and childron.
This attack was wholly unexpected.an I there-
lore no defense bad been provided. It is es
timatod that not less than 800 persons were
killed by the Indians, and a large amount of
properly was destroyed. JJow this outbreak
was induced is not definitely known; and sus
picion , which may be unjust, need not be
stated.
Information was received by the Indian Bu
reau from different sources, nbout the time
hostilities were coromeocod, that a simulta
neous attack was to be made upon the white
settlements by all tho tribes between the
Mi.si.sippi River and tho Rock Mountains.
The State of Minnesota has suffered great
injury from the Indian war. A large portion
of her territory has been depopulated, and a
severe loss has been sustained by the dortruc
tion of propei ty. The peoplo of that Stalo
manifest much anxiely for tho removal of the
ribes beyond the limits of tho State, as a
guarantee against future hostilities.
Tti Commission of Indian affairs will furn
ish full details.
REMODELING OF INDIAN 8TSTEM.
I subm it for .your special consideration
whether our Indian system shall not be re
modeled. Many wise and good men have
been imprisoned with the belief that this can
be profitably done.
PACIFIC RAUBOAD AND TUE SHIP CANALS.
I submit a statement of tho p oceedings of
the commissioners, which shows the progress
that has been made in the enterprise of con
structing the Pacific Railroad aud thus sug
guests the earliest completion of tho road, and
also the favorable action of Congress upon the
project now pondering before them for enlarg
ing the capacities of the great canals in New
York and Illinois, as being of vital and rapid
ly increasing importance to the whole nation
and especially to the vast interior region here
inafter to bo noticed at some greater length.
I propose having preprared and laid before
you at an early day somo interesting and val
uable satistical information upon this subject.
Tho military and commercial importance cf en
larging the Illinois aod Michigan Canal and
improving the Illinois River, is presented io
the report of Colonel Webster to the Secreta
ry of War, and now transmitted to Congress.
I respect fully ask your attention to it.
TUE AGRICULTURAL BUREAU.
To carry out the provisions of the act of
Congress of tho 1 5th of My last, I have caus
ed the Department of Agriculture of the
United States to be organized. The Com
missioner mformes me that within the period
of a few months this department has establish
ed an exteosivo system of correspondence and
exchanges both at home and abroad, which
lroraies to effect highly beneficial results in
the develop?m3nt of a correct kuowledgo cf
recout improvements in agriculture iu me in
troduction of new products, and iu the col
lection of agricultural statistics of the differ
ent States; also, that it will soon be prepared
to distribute largely seeds, cereals, plants and
cuttings, and has already published and liber
ally diffused much valuable information.
In anticipation of a more elaborate report
which in due time will be published, embrac
ing some valuable tests in chemical science
now in progress in the laboratory, the creation
of this department was for the more immedi
ate benefit of a large class of our most valua-
blo citizens, aud I trust that the liberal basis
upon which it has been organized will not
only meer your approbation, but that it will
realiqo at no distant day all the fond nest an
tici nations of the most sanguine friends, and
becomo the fruitful source of advantage to all
our people.
THE PROCLAMATION OF SEPT. 22D.
On the 22 1 day of September last a proc
uration was issued by the Executive a copy
of which is herewith submitted. In accor
dance with the purposo expressed in the sec
ond paragraph of that paper I now respect
fully recall your attention to wnat may do
called compensated emancipation. A nation
may bo saiu to consist oi lis territory, us peo
ple and its laws. The territory is the only
part which is of certain durability. "One'
generation passclh away and another genera-!
tion cometh, out the earth abide for ever."
It is of tho fiist importance to duly consider
and estimate this ever enduring part.
THE UN IO if ONE AND INSEPARABLE.
That portion of the earth's surface which is
owned and inhabited by ihe people of the
United Slates is well adopted to the home of
one national family. It is not well adapted
for two or moro. Its vast extent, ana its
variety of climate and productions are of ad
vantago in the ago of one people, whatever
they micbt have beon in former ages, bteam
and telegraphs and intelligence, havo brought
theso to bo an advantageous combination for
one united people.
THE FOLLV OF DISUNION.
In the Inaugral Address I briefly pointed
out tho total inadequacy of disuuion as a rem
edy for dilhcul lies between tho people or ihe
. T ? I I 1.
two sections, i uiu so in isnguago wuxh,
therefore, I beg to repeat.
. TILS. MATTER IN A NUTSHELL
One section of our coun' ry believed slavery
is rijzht and ought to be extended, while tho
other believes it to be wrong and ought not
to bo extended. This is the only substantial
dispute. The fugitive slave clause of the Con
stitution and the law, for the suppression of
tho African slave trade, are each as well on
forced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a
community weere tho moral sense of the peo
plo impel feci ly support the law itself. Ihe
great body of the people abide by the 1 'gal
obligations in both cases and a few break over
each . This I think cannot bo perfectly cured
and it would bo worso in both instances after
the separation of the sections than before.
Tbo soreign slave trade, now imperfectly sup
pressed, would be, ultimately, revived without
restriction in ono section, whilo fugitives now
only partially surrendered would not bo sur
rendered at all to the Other,
tn rnrstcAL argument against DisustoN.
Physically speaking we canuot seporate,
we cannot removo our respective sections from
each other, nor build an impassable wall be
tween thorn. A husband and wife ma" bo
divorced and go out of tho presence and be
yond the roach of each other, but the differ
ent parts of our country cannot do this. They
cannct but remain fuco to face, and intercourse
either amicable or hostile must conlinuo be
tween them. Is it possible then to roako
that intercourse more advanlagous or moro
advantageous or more satisfactory afier separ
ation than before.' Can aliant tnakt trtatiet
easier than friendt can malt lateif Can
treaiics bo moio faithfully enforcod between
aliens than laws can among frieods. Sup
pose vou co to a war, you cannot fight always
and when after much loss on both sides,; mJ
no gain on cither, you cease fighting tho iden
tical old questions as to terms of intcrcourso
are ngsin.upon ycu, more is no una, uraign
or crooked, suitable for a national boundary
upon which to divide. Trace throni from
East to WW. nnon the line betweeu tho fieo
and slave country, and wo shall find a little
more than one-third of its Jenrth aro risers
eay to be crossed, at d populated, or soon to
pe populated thickly, upon both sides, while
io nearly all its remaining length are merely
surveyors', lims, over which peoplo may walk
back and forth without any cone ousoess of
their presence. No part of this lino can be
made any more difficult to pass by writing it
down on paper, or parchment, as a national
boundary, ,
WHAT SECESSION SURRENDERS.
: The fact of separation if it comes, cives up
on the part of that seceding section, the fugi
tive slave clause, a ong with all other consti
tutional obligations, upon the section seceded
from, while I should expect no treaty stipu
lation.would ever be made to take its place.
"THE GREAT BODT OF TUB REPUBLIC."
But thero is another difficulty. The creat
interior region bouoded eat by the Allegba-
iin-p, norm vj tue uniiMi uommions, wes' uv
the Rocky Mountaius, and south by ihe line
along which the cultivation of corn and cottou
moots, and which includes part of Virginia,
part Tennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Michi
gan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansaa,
Iowa, Minnesota, and the territories of Daco
tab, Nebraska and a part of Colorado havo
above ten millions of people, and will have
forty millions more within filly years if not
prevented by any political folly or iiUNiuke.
It contains moie than one third of the coun
try owned by the revolted States certainly,
more than one million of surface miles, one
half as populous as Massachusetts alieady is.
It would have more than seventy-five millions
of people. A glance at the map thows that
territorially speaking it is the great loda cf
the Hepubitc. Ihe other parts, uro but mar
ginal borders to it. The magnificent region
slopir.gwcst from the Rocky Mountaius lo the
Pacific, being the deepest and alsotl.o richest
uudevoloed resources iu tb" pioduction of pro
visions, grains, grasses, and all which proceeds
from them.
A GREAT INTERIOR REGION.
This great'interior region is n Uurally ono
of the most important in the world, ascertain
from the statistics the small proportion of th
region, which has as yet been brought into
cultivation, and also the large and rapidly in
creasing amoun of its products, and we shall
bo overwhelmed with the magnitude, of the
prospect presented. And yet this region has
no sea coast and touches no ocean anywhere.
ITS NATURAL OUTLETS.
As pari of one nation, its people now may
find and may forever find their way to
Eurcpe by New Yoik, to South America nnd
Afr.ca by New Oileans, and to Asia by San
Francisco. But separate our common
country into nations, as designed by the
present rebellion.nnd every man in this great
interior region is thereby cut off fiom some
one or more of these outlets, not perhaps by
a physical barrier, but by embarrassing and
cnerous trade regulations, and this is true
wherever a dividing or boundary line may
be fixed. Place it between the now free
and slave country, or place it south of Ken
tucky, or north of Ohio, and still the truth
remains that none south of it Can trade
to any port or place north of it, and none
north of it can trade to any port or place
scuth of it, except upon terms dictated by a
Government foreign to them. These outlets
Eest, West, aaJ South, are indispensable
to the well-being of the people inhabiting,
and to inhabit this vast interior region.
Which of tho three maybe the best is no
proper question. All are belter than cither
and all of right belong to that people and
their successors forever. True to them
selves, they will not ask where a line of se
psration shall be, but will vow rather, that
there shall be no such line.
AC MM0N INTEREST.
Nor are the marginal regions less inter
ested in these communications to and through
them to the great outside world. They do
and each one of them must have access lo
their Egypt of the West without paying loll
at the crossing of oar national boundry.
SOURCES OF OUR RATIONAL EXISTENCE.
Our national life springs not from our per
manent past, nor from the lands we inhabit,
nor from our national homestead. There is
no possible swerving of this but would mul
tiply and not instigate evils among us. In
all its applications and attitudes it demands
union, nod . abhors separation. In fact it
would ere long force reunion however much
of blood and treasure the separation might
have cost. , Our strife pertains to ourselves,
to passing generations of men and it cannot
without convulsion be hushed forever, with
the passing of one generation.
AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION.
With this view I recommend the follow
ing resolution and articles amendatory to
the Constitution of the United States:
Resolved, By the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of
America in Copgress assembled, two thirds
cf both Houses concurring, that the follow
ing articles be proposed to the legislature or
conventions of tho several Slides as amend
ments to the Constitution of the United
States, all, or any cf wlrch articles when
ratified by lluec-fonrths of the said legisla
ures or conventions to be valid ns part or
parts of the said Constitution, namely:
cimpen Sated emancipation.
Atticle. Every Slate wherein slavery
now exists, which shall abolish the samo
therein at any timo before the first of Janu
ary, in the year of our Lord 1900, shall re
ceive compensation from the United States,
bearing interest at tho rate of , for each
slave shown to have been therein by the
eijjht census of tho United Slates, said bonds
to be delivered to such States, by. install
ments, or in one parcel, at the completion of
the hbolishmer.t, accordingly as the same
shall have' been gradual or at onetime
within such S:a!e, and interest shall begin to
run upon any such bond only from the prop
er time of its delivery as aforesaid and af
terwards. .
' OF, SLAVEJ FREED DT THE WAR.
. Article. All slaves who shall have en
joyed actual freedom by the chances of ar
al any time before tho end of the rebellion,
shall be forever free) but all owners of such
who shall not have been disloyal, shall bo
compensated for them at the same rales v.t
is provided for the States adopting abolish
ment of slavery, but in such a way that no
slave shall be twice accounted for.

. THE ARGUUEXTS TUCREF0R, '
I beg indulgence to disouss these propos
ed articles at some length. Without slavery
the rebellion should never have existed;
without slavery it could not continue.-
Amcng thofiienJa of the Union there is
great diversity of sentiment and policy in,
regard to slavery and the , African ' race
amoug us. Some wonld abolish it suddenly
and without compensation,; aud some, would
abolish it gradually and with ' compensa
tion. Some would remove t.he free people
from us, and some would retain them with,
us. ftnd there arc yet other minor diversU .
ties. Because of these diversities we waste
much strength in struggles amongst our
selves. By mutual, concession we should
harmonize and act together. This would
be n compromise among the friends and not
wilb enemies with - the Union. These arti
cles are intended to embody a plan of' such
mutual concession. If the plan shall be
adopted, it is assumed the emancipation will,
follow, at lea't in several of the States.; '
HARMONIZING DIFFERENCES. '
In the first article the main points are: .
First, The. emancipation. Second, The
length of time for. consumating, in years;;
and Third, The compensation. .
The emancipatien will be unsatisfactory to
the advocates of perpetual slavery, but the
leng h of time should greatly mitigate their
dissatisfaction. The lime saves both races
from the evils of sudden derangement, whilo
most of those whose habitus course , of;
thought will be disturbed by the measure,
will h ve passed away before its consuma
tion. Tbey will never see it. Another,
class will hail the prospect of emancipation
but will deprecate the length of time. , They
will feci that it goes for little, to the now liv
ing slaves, but it really gives them much.--.
It saves them from, the vagrant destitutions
which must largely attend immediate eman
cipation in localities where the circumstan
ces are very great, and it gives the inspire
ing assurance that their posterity shall be
free forever. t
The plan leaves to each State choosing to
act under it to abolish slavery now or at the
end of the cen'ury, or at any. intermediate
time, or by degrees, ex'ending over the
whole i r Rny part of that pt iiod; and it ob
liges no two States to proceed alike. Il . al
so provides for compensation, and general
ly the mcde of making it. This, it would,
seem, must further mitigate the dissatisfac
tion of those who favor perpetual slavery, es
pecially those who are to receive compensa
tion. WHT COMPENSATE.
Doubtless some of those who are to pay
and aot to receive will object to it. .1 hat
the measure is both just aod economical' is
certain. The libeiation of the slaves is the
destruction of property acquired by descent
or by purchase, the same as ar.y other prop
erty. It is no less true for having been often
said, that the people of the South are no
more responsible for. the introduction qf this
property than are the people of ihe. North;
and when it is rememberedi bow unhesitat
ingly we all use cotton and ugsr, and share
the profits of dealing in them, it may not
be quite safe to say that the South has been
more responsible than the North for its con
tinuance. If, then, for a comuion object,,
this property is to bo sacrificed, is it not
just that it be done et a common charge?
Aod if with less money, or. money more
easily paid, we can preserve the benefitaof,
the Union by this means, than we can do
by 'he war alone, is it not economical to. do,
it? -. v
AN ECONOMICAL VIEW.
Let us consider it then; let us ascertain
the urn we have expended in the ' war
since compensated emancipation was pro
posed hist March, and corsider whether,' if
that measure has been promptly accepted
by even some of the slave States, Ihe same
sum wou'd not have done more to close the
war than has been otherwise done. If to.
the measure w.oiui save money; and in that
view, would be ns pjuJent and economical
measure, certainly. : ' '
It is not so easy to pay something as.it is
to pay nothing, but it is easier to pay iv
large torn than a larger one. - 1 ' '
The aggregate sum necessary for- com
pensated emancipation of course would-be
large, but it would require no read cash
nor bonds any faster than the emancipation
progresses.
6HARINO THE BURDEN WITH POSTEIIITTC
This might not and probably would . not
close before the end of the thirty-seven
years. At that lime wc shall probably have
100,000,000 people to share the burden, in
stead of 31,000.000 as now, and rot cnly
so, but the increase ol our popula ion may
be expected to continue for n long-time
after the period as rapidly as before, ..be
cause eur territories will not have become
full. I do not state this inconsiderately.'
At the same ratio of inert ase which we have
maintained on rn average from our first
national census in 1790 until 1CCO, we
should in 1900 have a population of1 103,
208,415, and why may we not continua
that ratio far beyond that period. -u,
r;1v
OUR TERRITOKT. ,j
Our abundant room, our broad r.aliagar
homestead, is an ample resource. .Were
eur territory as limited as are the. British
idjs, Cirtninly our population couldi not;x
pnnd as stated. Instead of receiving ;Lhe
foreign born as now, we should be compell
ed to 6end pari of tho native born away,
but such is not our condition. We haio
2.9G3,OuO of square miles. Eurcpe has
3.CC9.CC0 square miles, with a population
averaging 73t perstfns to ihe square '.mile.
Why may not our country at somo . timo
average as many? I) it less fertile?' Has,
il mote waste surfscs by mountains, rivers,
lakes, deseits and other causes? Is it in
ferior to Europe in any natural advantage?
PROSPECTIVE GROWTH ' OF PvTULATIOS.'
If then we arc at some time to be ah pop
ulous a Ejrope, how soon?: As to when
this rcn.y be, wc may judge cf the past and
preser.tr ns to when, it will ever depend,
much on whether wo maintain the Union.
Scvcnl of onr Slates ore above the average
