THE PRESIDENT:
GREAT MESSK
A Remarkable State Paper jpent
Congress by Presided
Roosevelt I
Ail Important Questions of the
Day Discussed in Charac^-
istic Manner. 1

Congress convened on Mowlay
last and on Tuesday the an*io£isiy
awaited message from President
Roosevelt was received, it is a
characteristic document and re­
markably strong state pafjierV It
discusses the important i^tf|ons
of the day with Bootav^tian
thoroughness, vigor and frankness.
We regret that space does not per­
mit of our printing the message in
full, but will give a brief
This government stands for n|an
hood first and for business only? as
an adjunct of manhood.
We wish to secure as fair treat­
ment for the small town as for $the
big city for the small shipper as
tn^such a republic ^i Qt^S^^he
one thing that we cannot afford to
neglect is the problem of turning
out decent citizens.
Individual capitalist and in­
dividual wageworker are alike en­
titled to the protection of the law
and must alike obey the Jaw.
This government is not and never
shall be government by a pliltocracy.
This government is not and never
shall be government by a mob.
AH contributions by corporations
to any political committee or for
any political purpose should be for­
bidden by law.
More and more, war is coming to
be looked upon as in itself a lament­
able and evil thing..
As the world is now, only that
nation is equipped for peace that
knows how to fight and that will
not shrink from fighting i'fever the
conditions become such that war is
demanded in the name of the high­
est morality.
We cannot have too much im­
migration of the right sort and
should have none whatever of the
wrong sort.
These corporations doing an in­
terstate business are subjects with­
out a sovereign. We should assert
the sovereignty of the national
government.
All private car lines and the like
should be expressly put under the
supervision of the interstate com­
merce commission.
Congress should consider the
federal government's duty with re­
spect to insurance transactions.
Our navy is for the present suffi­
ciently large.

READ ADS IN THE ADVANCE
And Keep Posted on What Our
Enterprising Merchants

Judging by the amount of space
our merchants have contracted' for
in the Advance, Worthington in­
tends to lead all Southern Minnesota
cities in making bid for the holi­
day trade.
The past season has been one of
prosperity ^for farmers and mer­
chants alike and if the preparations
being made are any criterion a
heavy holiday business is anticipat­
ed and will doubtless be realized.
Worthington will be headquarters
for Santa Claus this year and the
stocks of merchandise that will be
shown here will be worth ooming
miles to see. Then, too, Worthing­
ton has a standing reputation for
quoting lowest possible prioes on all
lines of goods. The bargain hunter
never leaves town without being
satisfied with purchases made here.
No matter what part of the county
you may live in, no matter how
long the drive may be, it will pay
you to come to Worthington to
select your gift articles. Our mer­
chants will have the goods in proper
assortments and at right prices.
Another thing, our merchants want
your trade and they want it bad
enough to come before you in our
advertising columns and ask for it.
A merchant who wants your trade

be siire to give you the kind of
treatment to insure a continuance
qf your patronage.
Look through the columns our
paper and see what our advertisers
have to offer. Then come to town
and give our merchants an op­
portunity to back up their adver­
tising.

RIGHT THIS WAY
EVERYBODY
FOR THE BEST SHOES
UNHAPPY
E E
ome into this store all day long. Some had their shoes fitted
arelessly—some without sense.
A busy man ought surely not to be compelled to be think­
ing of bis feet.
But how is he going to help it while that little toe is veiling
"murder?"
You see the necessity of being fitted by a Shoe Man who
REALLY KNOWS HOW
Of course you know thatHhere is a great difference in ma­
terial and in the way shoes are put together.
Feet that are not absolutely tough should not be expected
to feel comfortable in shoes that were not made for sensitive feet.
You can get wh&t you need and w^pt here —shoes that will give jj
complete ease and made in correct'style.
We don't keep your money and you don't keep tbe 6hoes
you buy here, unless they are perfectly satisfactory in every re­
spect.
