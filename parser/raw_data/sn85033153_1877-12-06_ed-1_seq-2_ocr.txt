THDESD4.T, DEO. 6, 1877.
The annual message of President
Hayes to Congress was delivered on
Monday and was the longest similar
document submitted in the past sixteen
years. Th* President is outspoken on
the financial question, n garding as pre
eminent the policy and measures which
are designed to secure the restoration of
the currency to a normal and healthful
condition, amf believes that the resump
tion cf specie payments is the one thing
necessary to settle the disturbed condi
tion of our finances and aecnre the pros
perity of the country. He also recom
mends the issue of silver currency in
limited quantities and of a value as
nearly equal to gold as possible. Of his
Southern policy he speaks at consider
able length and regards the results fol
lowing as very encouraging. He says ;
“No unprejudiced mind will deny that
the fatal collisions which for several
years have been o * frequent occurrence,
und have alarmed the public minds, have
almost entirely ceased ; and that a spirit
of mutual forbearance and hearty nation
al interest has succeeded. There has
been a general re-establishment of order
and of the orderly administration of
justice. Instances of remaining law
lessness have become of rare occurrence;
political turmoil and turbulence have
disappeared ; useful industries have
been resumed ; public credit iu the
Southern States has been greatly
strengthed, and the encouraging benefit
of a revival of commerce between the
sections of the country lately embroiled
in civil war are fully enjoyed. Such are
some of the results already obtained,
upon which the country is to be con
gratulated. They are of such impor
tance that wa may with confidence
patiently await the desired consumma
tion that will surely come with the
natural progress of events.” The pro
tection of the rights of the colored peo
ple ar justly demanded and lie urges
the prompt punishment of all who at
tempt to oppress them. Asa whole the
message ia an able document and gives
the people a clear idea of his objects and
intentions, showing him to be a patriot
and statesman who is doing what he ain
cerely believes to bo for the best inter
ests of the whole country, and while
there may be a difference of opinion as
to the wisdom of hi* policy, we believe
that there is safety in standing by him
and bringing his measures to a fall and
thorough test.
The ultra silver and greenback men
have claimed that the demonetization of
the silver dollar in 1873 was a contrac
tion of the currency. The claim, of
course, is absurd, since if the whole
amount of American silver dollars coined
from the beginning of the government
up to that time had then been in circu
lation the contraction would have been
uueppreciable. The entire coinage of sil
ver dollars by our mints from 1792 to
1853, was out $3,038,000; and from 48i>3
to 1873 the total amount coined was
35.492.838, making an aggregale of only
38.045.838. These figures sre taken
from the report of Secretary Sherman,
a id are no donbt correct.
The President’s message to Congress
is an interesting document and is un
usually valuable in dealing with the
Southern policy and the reforms which
have formed bo large a part of Republi
can platforms and so small a part of Re
publican practice. On the money ques
tion the President is firm. He is de
cidedly favorable to resumption—and
advocate* the payment of the bonds is
sued prior to 1873 in gold. Evidently
ho does not favor the remonetization of
silver, but will sign s silver bill which
exempts the payment of the bonds in
that coin. These portions of the docu
ment will bo read with interest. — Sen
tinel.
Thebe are all manner of stories out
about Senator Blaine’s condition, repre
sentingjhim in every shade of health from
complete convalesenco to hopeless de
cay. The opinion which prev tils among
those moat likely to know, in Washing
ton, is that the Senator, under his ma
larial attack, felt the need of a complete
relief from care; and having stuck to it,
under all manner of temptation, is now
nearly restored to health and vigor.
Both the president and the secretary
think that it would be wise to repeal the
match tax, the tax on savings banks de
posits, and some other small and an
noying taxes, and substitute a moderate
duty on tea and coffee. They both give
strong reasons for this change, but we
doubt whether the two houses of con
gress will have the moral courage to
lest it.
The ordinary revenues from all re
sources into the United States Treasury
for the year ending June 30, 1877, were
§266,000,586, and the ordinary expendi
tures was §238,660,008, leaving a sur
plus revenue of §30,310,537, which was
consumed iu redemption of United
States notes and bonds, and the increase
of the cash balance in tho Treasury.
The estimated receipts for the fiscal
year ending Jan. 30, 1878, is §265,500,-
000, and the expenditures at §232,430,-
613.
New York Tkibvxe: The apparent
causes for discouragement are tather en
couraging than otherwise. The dispo
sition of the Southern question has re
moved one cause of offence against Re
publicans, and destroyed so much
Democratic capital. The President’s
honest efforts to improve tho Civil Ser
vice remove another ground of com
complaint, and leaves Democracy bank
rupt. Anil as for the Democratic as
cendancy iu Congress, wo look upon it
os the best thing that could happen. It
gives an opportunity to disclose their
real purpose and character to the coun
try. Nothing more is needed to
insure their defeat. the whole.
Democrats may as well postpone dis
counting their coming success for a lit
tle while, it is too much in doubt to
warrant premature exultation on their
part or unnecessary sadness on the part
of Republicans,
A Monster Vessel.—Tlie largest
steamship, ezcepfc the Great Eastern,
ever built, is now moored to the wharf
of the French Steamship Company,
North Hirer, New York. She is named
the Hooper, and lias heretofore been
used in the lying of telegraph ct hies.
This is her first trip to this country.
She was built at Newcastie-ou-Tyue in
1873, and is classed 100A1 r.t Lloyds.
She is 350 feet over all, 55 broad, and 3G
deep, built of iron, and rigged as a three
m isted schooner. She is registered as
4,935 tons, bat has a capacity of 6,000
tons exclusive of passengers. She has
two compound inverted engines of 400
nominal horse power, built by T. Clark
it Cos., of Newcastle, and is fitted with
steam windlass, winches, crane, and bal
last, and donkey engines. In her are
three cable tanks, one forty-one feet in
diameter and thirty feet deop, another
fifty-three by thirty feet. In the centre
one there have been stored 57,'K)0 bush
els of corn. In the spaces between
these tanka she has room for 400 tons of
freight. She will carry out the largest
cargo that ever left any port in the
United States. On board of her are all
the means and apurtenances for the lay
ing of cables. She is manned by a crew
of 100 men, and will be opou to inspec
tion to-morrow.
Tun Northern Democratic editor has
not yet found time to comment on that
vote of the solid South for the repeal of
the Resumption Act. It is a pretty large
and meaty subject, and the more it is
examined the uglier it looks for the
Democratic party. The country cannot
look, except with alarm, upon the spec
tacle of the controlling element of a par
ty which has a prospect of getting pos
session of the Government voting as one
man for incipient repudiation. And
when back of this vote there is plainly
visible another one just as unanimous
for a whoDsale raid on the Treasury,
the most generous friend of the South
must admit that implicit trust of a sec
tion which develops such dangerous
proclivities, is not the safe or the patri
otic course at this time.—AT. Y. Tri
bune.
New York has a baby weighing one
pound and ten ounces. Its name is
Collins, and the Graphic describes:
The child, a girl, was born last Sunday,
and weighs one pound and ten ounces,
while its length is thirteen and a half in
ches, about that of a good sized loaf of
bread. It is well proportioned, al-
I though it would be stretched a point to
I call it handsome. Its head is not as
large as a Havana orange, and is cov
ered by dark hair, while its complexion
is also very dark. The little creatures
eyes are ahvaj’s shut, and its breathing
can hardly be heard, even in closest
proximity. The hands are very narrow,
long and bony, looking more like the
( claws of a bird than the hands of a hu
-1 man being.
The South Carolina Legislature has
shown the depth of Democratic ingrati
tude. While Patterson is sticking to
that party iu the Senate with all his ad
hesive power, and is working like a
slave to put it in control, the Democrat
ic Legislature of his State comes to
gether and receives a report on the mat
ter of his election. This shows that
about twenty members of the Legisla
ture which elected him say they were
offered money to vote for him, and re
fused it; about twenty were offered
money, and took it, making forty pur
chases which Mr. Patterson diner at
tempted or accomplished. Mr. Patter
son wants “a white man’s chance.” He
seems to have made the most of it a
good while ago.
By a letter from Mr. O. B. Green
to Hon. Isaac Stepheson, written last
Monday, we learn that at that date a
space of 1,500 feet separated the dredges
working on the two ends of the Sturgeon
Bay canal. The dredges will be kept
at work as lona aa tnn itliur will per
mit. The engineer appointed by the
! state reports that the second quarter of
i the work has been finished, and some
work on the third quarter. As soon as
I his report is made to tiie governor, the
; canal company will be enable to secure
[ that portion of the grant securing to it
\ under the law, and will make arrange
! meats for selling it and devote the pro
! eeeds towards completing the canal.—

A beautiful young heiress in Mos
cow has married a beggar eighty-sis
years old. It has a queer look at first
but nothing could be more natural. The
young girl—she is only twenty-two—
could not enter into possession of her
fortune until she was married, and the
young men whom her guardians intro
duced to her were empty-headed crea
tures, to whom she was unwilling to
bind herself to life; so sh r■•- '.ved to
marry an old beggar and , at money
without sacrificing her i dependence.
The old man was one of her pensioners,
and readily consented to marry her and
then keep out of her way, retiring on a
comfortable allowance. All the beggars
in town feasted and made merry on the
wedding night.
_ Tna suspension bridge from New
jTork to Brooklyn was a great undertak
ing, will cost a vast sum of money,
and, when done, must be of incalculable
benefit to both cities; but the tunnel ex
tending for more than two miles under
the Hudson from New York to Jersy
City, through which may pass all the
passenger trains from the North, South
and West which wish to enter
the former city, will, when complet
ed, bo of still greater benefit to the
traveling public. It is to be wide
enough for a double track railroad and a
street car track also. It will be com
pleted in three years.
The Senate Gothamites are now
greatly exercised with a fear that their
city will be entirely dug up and over
turned, as shovelera came upon a huge
whisky still soma five feet below the
surface, in full operation. Heavy boots
now come down lightly, lest the jar
crack the crust and their owners sink
through the street into a sour mash.
About a year since a still was found in
the room just back of the pulpit in a
Missouri enroll in which services were
held every Sunday. If people did not
lock around so much they would not
find whisky distilleries iu such ' unex
pected places.
The nrblie debt statement for No
vember shows a decrease of §1,323,634,
and the following balances iu the
treasury: Currency, §8,816,396; special
fund fox redemption of fractional cur
rency, §9,803,002; special deposits
of legal tenders for redemption of certi
ficates of deposits, §36,055,000; coin,
§133,970,214, including coin certificates,
§32,291,400: out standing legal tenders.

That most loathsome and terrible of
all diseases, the leprosy mentioned
by the historians of Bible times, has
been discovered in many factories iu
Rhode Island, its victims being Prench-
Cauadians fr -in Tracadia, near the Gulf
of St. Lawn nee. Near and in that old
settlement, leprosy has existed for near
ly two hundred years, the younger peo
ple now and then escaping to ocher lo
calities to finally die with and spread
the subtle disease.
A max by the name of Marsh of Uni
ty, while hunting one day fast week,
was mistaken by his brother for a deer !
and fired at, the ball passing through one
ankle and entering the other, which will 1
possibly result in the loss of one if not
both feet.
Singular as it may seem to the Re
publican politicians, the people actually
like to see a President with a mind of
his own, and not afraid to assert it in
behalf of what he believes to be right.
And if he is brave enough to step over
the party lines when, in his opinion, the
public good demands it, they like him
all the better.— St. Louis Republican.
Resumption is nothing more than
bringing greenbacks up to par with gold,
and it would seem that, to facilitate the
work, the Government ought to hon
or its promises on every possible oc
casion. It ought to abolish all distinc
tions made by itself between the two,
and accept greenbacks in payment of
nil debts due to itself. — St. Louis Re
publican.
The recent earthquake in V estern
lowa and Eastern Nebraska was either
a very great shake-up or the people of
those localities are very great liars. On
the farm of .1. H. Armstrong a half
acre of ground, say the natives, was
torn and tossed, leaving vast fissures
which still exist, some filled with water
and some open and of unknown depth.
Thebe comes a report, couched in
very grave language, that Susan B. An
thony was elected a constable iu Colorado
at tho recent election. The selection
seems to have been a wise one, as the
man who runs away from any woman
who is not his wife, is seldom found.
“Honors are easy” in South Caro
lina’s representation in tho Senate; it
consists of a carpet bagger and a native
Democrat, the former under indictment
for buying hia election, and the latter
for participating in a massacre of ne
groes.
A stiff-backed resumption paragraph
in the President’s message would be of
more benefit to the Republican party
than a whole graveyard full of resur
rected Old Line Whigs.—V. V. Tribune

THE INTER OCEAN FOR 1878.
THREE EDITIONS.
WEEKLY, SEMI-WEEKLY AND DAILY.
In making its seventh annual announcement
The Inter-Ocean reassures its readers and the
public generally of its taith in the Republican
party and its devotion to Republican principles.
Its record during the past year has made it
more than ever before the great representa
tion Republican paper of the country. The
value of such a paper and its influence for
good were never more apparent than during
the electoral complications of last fall and win
ter. The course of the Inter-Ocean during that
trying period won for it the admiration and
lasting friendship of Republicans everywhere.
As an exponent of true Republicanism, to
which the public turned for advice and for en
couragement. The Inter-Ocean stood through
out the momentous struggle without a peer.
There never was a time when Republicans
more needed a journal stenefast and true than
now. Never before, in the history of the
country, has there been a period of such poli
tical interest and inquiry as is now in the im
mediate future. Great questions are to be dis
cussed and disposed of ; embarrassing compli
cations arc to be grappled with ; fundamental
principles are to be defended. Republican to
the core. The inter Ocean will give all possi
ble information on all political topics, and,
while treating opponents with the greatest
fairness, will maintain its high standing as an
earnest and outspoken advocate of uncompro
mising and unadulterated Republicanism.
While The Inter-Ocean stands second to no
paber In the country as a political journal, it
takes high rank as an enterprising and thor
oughgoing newspaper. During the past year
It lias eclipsed till Western papers iu the excel
lence, completeness, and reliability of its for
eign dispatches and letters, and has had few
equals in presenting in most readable shape
general and home news. In every part of the
world great events are occurring, with proba
bilities pointing to more important in future.
Never before was a good newspaper so impor
tant to both young and old.
In atl that goes to make a first cla s news
paper, The Inter-Ocean is not excelled by any
1 publication in the country. It is a national
newspaper, one that will be found useful and
interesting to Americans in every pari of the
globe. While it especially represents the great
interests of the Northwest, it is national in its
views and comprehensive in its gathering.
The lutcr-Ocean makes especial claim as a
family paper, devoting more attention than
any other political newspaper to departments
prepared and conducted with the wants of the
home and the demands of the family in view.
The Commercial Department is conducted
with great care, and everything possible is
done to make the market reports reliable and
complete.
The Agricultural Department is carefully
edited by a gentleman of ability and exper
ience.
The Home Department is of special interest
to the ladies, and Is devoted to the practical
and useful.
To Educational Matters especial attention is
given. Believing that the perpetuity of the
republic depends upon the education of the
people. The Inter-Ocean is the warm advo
cate of the free school system, and everything
that will improve and extend it.
The Woman’s Kingdom is anew department
devoted to the Interests of that large portion
of the gentler sex who, either from necessity
or otherwise, desire to devote themselves to
some useful occupation or profession, for the
purpose of earning a livelihood. It is not for
the advocacy of any particular Issue, but for
the general improvement and elevation of the
ferar.le character In every depart ment of life.
The Question and Answer Department, long
a special feature of the Inter-Ocean, is a valu
able encyclopedia of information, and covers
as much ground in the course of a year as
maty of the elaborate works published at such
high prices.
The Inter-Ocean has the largest aggregate
circulation of any newspaper published in the
Northwest, it lament, t.l.
offices, distributed in every State and Territory
in the United States, Inall the British provinces
and numerous foreign states and countries.
