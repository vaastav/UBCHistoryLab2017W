The Reichstag DissolvedOn
Thursday December 13 the Reichstag
tag wan dissolved in consequence oft
t Its refusal to vote the supplementaryappropriation
appropriation demanded for GermanSouthwest
Southwest Africa by tho OovernmentThia
Thia ia not the first time in the historyof
of the present German Empire thatthia
this instrument of coercion has beenused
used to break down the resistance ofthe
the popular assembly The possibilityof
of a resort to such an expedient showshow
how widely the German Constitutiondiffers
differs from that of Great Britain orthat
that of the United StatesWe
p We need not say that under our Federal
eral Constitution the President has nopower
power to dissolve Congress though hemay
may convoke it in extra session InFranco
France the President of the republic ifhe I
he can procure the consent of the Senatemay
may dissolve Parliament and order theelection
election of a new Chamber of DeputiesIn
In Great Hritain and in most othercountries
countries which have adopted the parliamentary
liamentary an distinguished from thopresidential
presidential type of government thepower
r power of dissolution is the complementof
of the responsibility of the Ministersand
and theoretically is used to ascertainwhether
whether the Cabinet possesses tho confidence
fidence of the nation In the GermanEmpire
Empire Ministerial responsibility doesnot
not exist any more than it exist in thoUnited
United States and it seems thereforeunreasonable
unreasonable that the power of dissolution
tion should be vested in the executiveand
and Bundeurath conjointly Nevertheless
less the voters have upheld the ImperialGovernment
Government when it has applied thisformidable
formidable Instrument of pressure to thepopular
b popular branch of tho national legislature
ture Tho Reichstag has been thricodissolved
dissolved once in 1878 when it refusedto
to pass a bill for the repression of agitation
tion by the Socialists next in 1887 whenit
p it rejected a bill fixing the size of thearmy
army for seven years and lastly in 1893when
when it refused to sanction changedproponed
proponed in the military system Ineach
each case tho electors virtually said thatthe
the executive was right and the legislature
lature wrong for the new Reichstagaccepted
L accepted the plans of the GovernmentThus
Thus tho adjustment of the ultimateauthority
authority of the different organs of thoState
State was postponedThe
The truth is that the Reichstag Is farfrom
from playing in Germany the great partwhich
which Is played by the Chamber of Deputies
ties in France On paper the powers ofthe
the former body like those of the latterare
are great but in practice the Germanassembly
assembly has not been able to turn todecisive
decisive account ita nominal control ofthe
the purse All laws indeed require thoconsent
consent of the Reichstag and so do thebudget
c budget all loans and all treaties thatinvolve
involve matters falling within the domainof
of legislation But although the Constitution
i tution declares that the budget shall boannual
annual the principal revenue laws arepermanent
permanent and cannot be changed without Iout
I out the consent of tho Bimdesrath orFederal
Federal Council Then again the mostimportant
important appropriation that for thearmy
army has hitherto been voted for a number
ber of yearn at a time A similar courser
r has boon pursued with reference to thonavy
4 navy In tho debates on the budgetthe
the Deputies indulge freely in criticismof
of the Government hut an a nilo thoreductions
reductions made aro unimportant andcomplete
complete rejection of an appropriationdemanded
demanded has been extremely rareThe
The extent to which the Reichstag issubordinated
subordinated to the Hundesrath is imperfectly
I perfectly appreciated in the UnitedStates
States Every one of the fiftyeightmembers
members of tho Bundesrnth has a rightto
to sit in tho Reichstag and to sicaktherein
therein whenever he chooses That into
to ay the Bundesrath han noino of thoAttributes
Attributes of an Imperial Cabinet andtechnically
technically Interpellations in tho Rcichstag
tag aro addresser tp the Hundcsraththough
though in tact they lire are communicated
cated to the Chancellor who himself hasno
no right to sit in the Reichstag exceptas
as a delegate to the Bundesrath Practically
tically the Bundesrath has the first aswell
well as the last word on almost all tholaws
I laws for the Reichstag has not succeeded Iceeded
ceeded in making its right of initiativein
in legislation very effective By far thelarger
larger part of tho statutes as well as thebudget
1 budget are prepared and first discussedby
by the Bundesrath They are then sentj
j
r
I
to the Keichjstag and if paaaed by thatbod
body are submitted once more to theBundesrath
Bundesrath for approval The Bundearath
rath is not only the main source of legislatfon
Illation but it la also a part of thoexecutive
executive enjoying a share of the powerof
of appointment From another point ofview
view it may be compared to our UnitedStates
States Supreme Court for it decidesdisputes
disputes between the Imperial and StateGovernments
Governments about the interpretation ofImperial
lmperlal statutes Not only has theBundesrath
Bundesrath far more extensive powersthan
than the Reichstag but it also possessesprivileges
privileges withheld from the latter bodyFor
For instance the Reichstag cannot besummoned
summoned to meet without the Bundesratri
rat whereas the latter can sit aloneIn
In the Reichstag the order of business Ubroken
broken off by theending of the sessionwhereas
whereas In the Bundesrath it is continuous
ous so that matters may be taken upagain
again at the point where they were leftWe
We observe lastly that the meetings oftho
the Bundesrath may be secret and infact
fact the public is always excludedthough
though a brief report of the mattersdealt
dealt with and the conclusions reachedis
is published after each sessionIt
It is evident that in the Reichstag theGerman
German people possess only the semblance
blance of selfgovernment The principal
pal organ legislation is thdBundesrathwhich
which represents not the people but thesovereigns
sovereigns of the constituent StatesSamuel
Samuel Gompers and John SlltehtllWe
We note with interest the continueddisapproval
disapproval the part of Messrs SAMUKb
rET GOMPERB and JOHN MITCHELL ofwhat
what they are pleased to describe asgovernment
government by injunction Those passionate
sionate advocates of human liberty bothappeared
appeared at the fifth annual meetingof
of the National Civic Federation lastWednesday
Wednesday and both declared themselves
selves in no measured terms as deadlyfoea
fOUl of the injunction Mr Jour MITCHELL
ELL indeed went so far as to say that
under circumstances prvocation
cation he would trample the Injunctionunder
under foot as a tyrannical interferencewith
with his constitutional rightsOf
Of course the seeming inconsistencyof
of this attitude assumed by gentlemenwho
who have consecrated themselves tofreedom
freedom in its broadest and its noblestforms
forms is susceptible of explanationSuperficially

Messrs OOMPBBS and MITCHELL denoucing
nouncing with < such bitterness the onlyremaining

in pursuit of the privileges guaranteedhim
him by our political and social institutions
tions The appearance is deceptive nodoubt
doubt but tho ordinary citizen sees intho
tho injunction merely an effort by theGovernment
Government to save the lives of menwho
who seek t support themselves andtheir
their families through the medium ofhonest
honest toil We know how it grievesMessrs
Messrs GOMPEBS and MITCHELL to hearof
of workingmen beaten maimed evenmurdered

occasions Their hem ore always lacerated
ated in such caVfl for surely there canbe

which would deny tho poor mans rightto

less only the inspired few who enjoycommunion

the agency of that liberty of which theyprofess
profess to be the appointed and peculiarprophets

erroni will b dispelled For the moment
ment however they possess us with remarkable
markable tenacityIt
I is a great pity that Messrs GoMFERfland
and MITCHELL did not find time to explainto
t their distinguished audience the exactmanner

to which injunction interferes with thehuman

and apostrophize with such voluble andmore

King Behanzin didnt like living II the WestIndies
Indies and wanted t go home This Ithought
thought was base Ingratitude because Francawas
was paying all his expenses and allowing hisseven
seven wives we did hear it was seventeenand
cheer him In his loneliness
and perhaps it wasto chr h1 lone
lines The Prince himself appeared t bea
a very alee boy of about It and he certainlywaa
was affable for a Prince royalHe
He told us to go up on the veranda and hewould

heard rustling through the shutters mingledwith
with the giggling of women and presentlythe

its stuck him hand out to give ns the shakeHe
He did not come outside nor did be open thedoor

The King was as black aa the Prince andwas
was about S years of age with gray amonghis
his curls and regular billygoat whiskers alsostreaked

blue silk told embossed tablecloth or windowcurtain

which was as much of him as got through thedoor

the nail on his little finger It was three inchesor
or more In length and twisted off down towardhis
his hand in a graceful spiral I fancy he wasproud
proud of it All the time we were talking tohtm
him the women back of the shutter were giggling
gling and having the time of their livesThe
The interview by the Princes request
was soon over and wishing the good KingBehanzin
Behanzin a speedy return to his home inDahomey
Dahomey we shook hands once more a

their kinky hair curled up into horns four orflve
five Inches high stood in the yard gigglingand
and watching us They were also black andshiny
shiny and were anywhere from twenty tothirty
thirty years younger than their royal maaterand
and husband I think from the giddy manner
oem of them that they would have risked theroyal
royal displeasure by flirting wltl us It thePrince
Prince hadnt been with us I forgot to saytheir
their royal robes were of calico with nofurbelows
