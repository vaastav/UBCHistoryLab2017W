Complete Text of President Harding's Annual Message to Congress
Itambarf of tlx Cunti ?
Bo many problem* are calling
tor solution that a recital of all
of them. In tha face of the known
limitation of a abort aaaslon of
Congreaa. would seem to lack sin
cerity of purpose. It la four
years since the world war ended,
but the Inevitable readjustment of
the soda] and economic order la
not more than barely begun.
Thar* Is no acceptance of pre-war
conditions anywhere In the world.
In a very general way humanity
harbors individual wishes to go
on with war-time compensations
for production, with pre-war re
quirements In expenditure. In
ahort. everyone, speaking broadly
craves readjustment for every
body except himself, while there
can be no Just and permanent
rsadjurtment except when all par
ticipate.
The civilisation which measured
Its strength of genius and the
power of science and the re
sources of Industries, in addition
to testing the limits of man
power and the endurance and
heroism of men and women?
that same civilization Is brought
to its severest test in restoring a
tranquil order and committing
humanity to the stable ways of
peace.
TEST CIVILIZATION.
If the sober and deliberate ap
praisal of pre-war civilization
makes It seem a worth-while in
heritance. then with patience and
courage It will be preserved,
e never again will be precise
ly the old order; Indeed, I know
at no one who thinks It to be de
alrable. For out of the old order
came the war itself, and the new
order, established and made se
cure. never will permit Its re
currence.
It Is no figure of speech to say
we have come to the teet of our
civilization. The world has been
passing ? la today passing ?
through a great crista The con
duct of war Itself Is not more dif
ficult than the solution of the
problems which necessarily follow.
I am not speaking at this moment
of the problem In its wider aspect
of world rehabilitation or of Inter
national relationship. The refer
ence Is to our own social,
financial, and economic problems
at home. These things are not to
be considered solely as problems
apart from all international rela
tionship. but every nation must be
able to carry on for Itself, else its
international relationship will
have scant Importance.
I U. S. FORTUNATE.
Doubtless our own people have
emerged from the world war
tumult less Impaired than most
belligerent powers; probably we
have made larger progress toward
reconstruction. Surely we have
been fortunate In diminishing un
employment, and our Industrial
and business activities, which sere
the lifeblood of our material ex
istence. have been restored as In
no other reconstruction period of
like length in the history of the
world. Had we escaped the coal
and railway strikes, which had
?O excuse for their beginning and
Jess justification for their de
layed settlement, we should have
done Infinitely better. But labor
was Insistent on holding to the
war heights, and heedless forces
of reaction sought the pre-war
levels, and both were wrong. In
the folly of conflict our progress
was hindered, and the heavy cost
l?as not yet been fully estimated.
There ran be neither adjustment
nor the penalty of fhe failure
to readjust In which all do not
somehow participate.
The railwav strike accentuated
the difficulty of the American
farmer. The first distress of re
adjustment came to the farmer,
and it will not be a readjustment
fit to abide until he is relieved.
The distress brought to the
firmer do** not affect him alone.
Agricultural ill fortune is a na
tional ill fortune. That one
fourth of our population which
produce* the food of the Repub
lic and adds so largely to our ex
port commerce must participate
In the good fortunes of the na
tion. else there Is none worth
retaining.
AGRICULTURAL AID.
Agriculture Is a vital activity
In our national life. In it we
had our beginning, and !ts west
ward march with the star of the
empire has reflected the growth
?f the Republic. It has Its vicis
situdes which no legislation will
prevent, Irs hardships for which
no law can provide escape. But
the Congress can make available
to the farmer the financial facili
ties which have been built up un
der Government aid and super
vision for other commercial and
Industrial enterprises. It may
be done on the same solid funda
mentals and make the vitally im
portant agricultural Industry
more secure, and It must be done.
This Congress already has taken
cognizance of the misfortune
which precipitate deflation brought
to American agriculture. Your
measures of relief and the reduc
tion of the Federal reserve dis
count rate undoubtedly saved the
country from widespread disaster.
The very proof of helpfulness al
ready given Is the strongest argu
ment for the permanent establish
ment of widened credits, hereto
fore temporarily extended through
the War Finance Corporation.
The Farm Loan Bureau, which
aire dy has proven its useful
ness through the Federal land
banks, may well have its powers
enlarged to provide ample farm
production credits as well as en
larged land credits. It is entirely
practical to create a division In
the Federal land banks to deal
with production credits, with the
limitations of time so adjusted to
the farm turnover as the Federal
reserve system provides for the
turnover in the manufacturing
and mercantile world. Special pro
vision must be made for live
stock production credits, and the
limit of land loans may be safely
enlarged. Various measures are
pending before you, and the best
judgment of Congress ought to
be expressed In a prompt enact
ment at the present sedfclon.
FARMERS HARD HIT.
But American agriculture needs
more than added credit facilities.
The credits will help to solve the

Hero la aa outstanding prob
lem. demanding the moat rlgorouo
consideration at the Concrete and
the country. It haa to do with
more than agriculture. It pro
vides the channel (or the flow of
the country's commerce. But the
farmer Is particularly hard hit.
Bis market, so affected by the
world consumption, doss not ad

half of the year now cloalng the

though Insistently declaring to
the contrary, embargoed hie ship
ments or denied him cars when
fortunate markets were calling.
Too frequently transportation
failed while perishable products
were turning from possible profit
to losses counted io tens of
millions.
I know of no problem exceed
ing In Importance is this ons of
transportation. In our complex and
Interdependent modern life trans
portation la essential to our very
existence. Let us pass for the
moment the menace In the pos
sible paralysis of such service aa
we have and note the failure, for
whatever reason, to expand our
transportation to meet the na
tion's needs..
RAILWAY NEEDS.
The census of 1830 recorded a
population of 50,000.000. In two
decades more we may reasonably
expect to count thrice that num
ber. In the three decades end
ing in 1920 the country's freight
by rail increased from 831,000,000
tona to 2.234.000.000 tons; that la
to say, while our population waa
Increasing leee than 70 per cent,
the freight movement Increased
over 250 per cent.
We have built 40 per cent of
the world's railroad mileage and
yet find It Inadequate to our
present requirements. When we
contemplate the Inadequacy of
today it Is easy to believe that
the next few decades will wit
ness the paralysis of our trans
portation-using social scheme or
a complete reorganization on
some new basis. Mindful of the
tremendous costs of betterments,
extensions, and expansions, and
mindful of the staggering debts
of the world today, the difficulty
Is magnified. Here Is a problem
demanding wide vision and the
avoidance of mere makeshifts.
No matter what the errors of the
past, no matter how we ac
claimed construction and then
condemned operations In the past,
we have the transportation and
the lionest Investment In the
transportation which sped us on
to what we are, and we face con
ditions which reflect Its inade
quacy today. Its greater Inade
quacy tomorrow, and we contem
plate transportation costs which
much of the traffic can not and
will not continue to Jfcy.
LIVE IN MOTOR AGE.
Manifestly, w# have need to be
gin on plans to co-ordinate all
transportation facilities. We
should more effectively connect np
our rail lines with our carriers by
spa. We ought to reap some
benefit from the hundreds of mil
lions expended on Inland water
ways. proving our capacity to
utilize as well as expend. We
ought to turn the motor truck
Into a railway feeder and dis
tributor Instead of a destroying
competitor.
It would be folly to ignore that
we live in a motor age. The motor
car reflects our standard of living
and gauges the speed of our pres
ent-dny life. It long ago ran down
Simple Living, and never halted
to Inquire about the prostrate fig
ure which fell as Its victim. With
full recognition of motor ear
transportation we must turn It to
the most practical use. It cannot
supersede the railway lines, no
matter how generously we afford
It highways out of the publlo
treasury. If freight traffic by
motor were charged with Its
proper and proportionate share of
highway construction, we should
fine much of it wasteful and more
costly than like service by rail.
Yet we have paralleled the rail
ways, a most natural line of con
struction. and thereby taken away
from the agency expected service
much of its profitable traffic,
which the taxpayers have been
providing the highways, whose
cost of maintenance Is not yet
realized.
LOWER RATES VITAL.
The Federal Government haa a
right to inquire Into the wisdom
of this policy, because the National
Treasury Is contributing largely
to this highway construction.
Costly highways ought to be made
to serve as feeders rather than
competitors of the railroads, and
the motor truck should become a
co-ordinate factor In our great dis
tributing system.
This transportation problem can
not be waived aside. The demand
for lowered costs on farm products
and baslo materials can not be ig
nored. Rates horlsontally' In
creased, to meet increased wage
outlays during the war inflation,
are not easily reduced. When
some very moderate wage reduc
tions were effected last summer
there was a 5 per cent hortsontal
reduction In rates. I sought at
that time. In a very Informal way,
to have the railway managers go
before the Interstate Commerce
Commission and agree to a heavier
reduction on farm products and
coal and other basic commodities,
and leave unchanged the freight
tariffs which a very large portion
of the traffic was able to bear.
Neither the managers nor the
commission saw fit to adopt the
suggestion, so we had the horizon
tal reduction too slight to be felt
by the higher class cargoes and too
little to benefit the heavy tonnage
calling most loudly for relief.
Railways are not to be expected
to render the most essential serv
ice In our social organization
without a fair return on capital
Invested, but the Government has
gone so far In the regulation of
rates and rules of operation that
it kaa the r?ponrtWHty of point
In* the way to tha reduced freight
ooato ao e?en Hal to our national
mbn.
? Government operation doe* net
afford tha oura. It ?u Govern
ment 'operation which brought ua
to the very older of things against
which wa now rebel, and we are
atlll liquidating the coata of that
supreme folly.
Surely the genius of tha rail
way bulldera haa not become ex
tinct among the railway manag
ers. New economies, new efflol
enclea in cooperation muat be
found. The fact that labor takes
60 to (0 per cent of total rail
way earnings makea limltatlona
wlthm which to effect eoonomlea
vary difficult, but tha demand la
no leae Inaistent on that account.
Clearly the managera are with
out that lntercarrler, co-operative
relationship ao highly essential
to the beat and moat economical
operation. They could not func
tion in harmony when the atrlke
threatened the paralysis. of all
railway transportation. The re
lationship of the aervlce to pub-'
lie welfare, ao Intimately affected
by State and Federal regulation,
demanda the effective correlation
and a concerted drive to meet
an inaiatant and Justified public
demand.
SUGGESTS REMEDY.
The taerger of llnea into aya
tems. a facilitated interchange of
freight oars, the economic use of
terminala, and the consolidation of
facilities are suggested ways of
economy and efficiency.
I remind you that Congress pro
vided a Joint commission of agri
cultural inquiry, which made an
exhaustive inveetlgation of car
aervlce and transportation, and
unanimously recommended in ita
report of October 15, 1921, the
pooling of freight cars under a
central agency. This report well
deserves your aerloua considera
tion. I think well of the central
agency, which shall be a creation
of the rallwaya themselves, to pro
vide. under the jurisdiction of the
Interstate Commerce Commission,
the means for financing equip
ment for carriers which are other
wise unabls to. provide their pro
portion of car equipment adequate
to transportation needs. This
same agency ought to point the
way to every possible economy in
maintained equipment and the
neceasjyy interchanges In railway
commerce.
In a previous address to the
Congress, I called to your atten
tion the Insufficiency of power to
enforce the decisions of the Rail
road Labor Board. Carriers have
ignored Its decisions, on the one
hand: railway workmen have chal
lenged Ita declaions by a strike, on
the other hand.
PLEADS FOR LABOR.
The intent of Congress to estab
lish a tribunal to which railway
labor and managers may appeal re
specting questions of wages and
working conditions cannot be too
strongly commended. It la vitally
Important that some such agency
should be a guaranty against sus
pended operation. The public
must bs spared even the threat
of discontinued service.
Sponsoring the railroads as we
do, it la an obligation that labor
shall be assured the highest Jus
tice and every proper considera
tion of wage and working condl
tiona, but it Is an equal obligation
to see that no concerted action in
forcing demands shall deprive the
public of the transportation aerv
lce essential to its very existence.
It Is now Impossible to safeguard
public Interest, because the decrees
of the board ara unenforceable
against either employer or em
ploye.
The Labor Board ltaelf Is not so
constituted as best to serve the
publio interest. With six partisan
members on a board of nine, three
partisans nominated by the em
ployes and three by the railway
managers, it is inevitable that the
partisan viewpoint la maintained
thoughout hearings and In de
cisions handed down. Indeed, the
few exceptions to a strictly parti
san expreaalon In decisions thus
far rendered have been followed
by accuaatlona or betrayal of the
partisan interests represented.
Only the publio group of three is
free to function in unbiased de
cisions. Therefore the partisan
membership may well be abolished,
and decisions should be mads by
an Impartial tribunal.
FAVORS BOARD.
I am well convinced that the
funotlona of this tribunal could
be much better carried on here
In Washington. Evan war* It to
be continued as a separate tribu
nal. there ought to bo oontact
with the Interstate Commerce
Commission, which has supreme
authority in the rate making to
which wage cost bears an Indis
soluble relationship. Theoretically,
a fair and living wage must be
determined quite apart from the
employer's earning capacity, but
in practice, in the railway aervlce,
they are .inseparable. The record
of advanced rates to meet In
creased wages, both determined
by the Government. Is proof
enough.
The substitution of a labor divi
sion in the Interstate Commerce
Commission, made up from Its
membership, to hear snd decide
disputes relating to wagea and
working conditions which have
failed of adjustment by proper
committees created by the rail
ways and their employee, offers a
more effective plan.
MORE MEMBERS.
It need not be surprising that
there ia dlaaatisfactlon over de
layed hearings and decisions by
the present board when every
trivial diapute is carried to that
tribunal. The law should require
the ratlroada and their employes
to Institute means ahd methods to
negotiate between themselves their
constantly arising differences,
limiting appeals to the Govern
ment tribunal to disputes of such
character aa are likely to affect
th?" public welfare.
. This suggested substitution will
Involve a necessary Increase in
the membership of the commis
sion. probably four, to constitute
the labor diviaion. If the sug
geetlon appeals to the Congress, it
PRESIDENT READING MESSAGE
will be well to specify that the
labor division shall be constituted
of representatives of the four
rate-making territories. thereby
assuring a tribunal conversant
with the conditions which obtain
in the different rate-making sec
tions of the country.
I wish I could bring to you the
precise recommendation for the
prevention of strikes whicii
threaten the welfare of the ppople
and menace public safety. It is
an impotent civilization and an
Inadequate government which
lacks the genius and the courage
to guard against such a menace
to public welfare as we ex
perienced last summer. You were
aware of the Government's great
concern and its futile attempt to
aid In an adjustment. It will re
veal the Inexcusable obstinacy
which was responsible for so
much distress to the country to
recall now that, though all dis
putes are not yet adjusted, the
many settlements whioh have
been made were on the terms
which the Government proposed
In mediation.
DUTIES OF LABOR.
Public Interest demands that
ample power shall be conferred
upon the labor tribunal, whether
It Is the present board or the
suggested substitute, to require
Its rulings to be accepted by both
parties to a disputed question.
Let there be. no confusion about
the purpose of the suggested con
ferment of power to make de
cisions effective. There can be
no denial of constitutional rights
of either railway workmen or
railway managers. No man can
be denied his right to labor when
and how he chooaee, or cease to
labor when he so elects, but,
since the Government assumes to
safeguard his Interests while em
ployed In an eesentlal public serv
ice, the security of society Itself
demands his retirement from the
service shall not be so timed and
related as to effect the destruc
tion of that service. This vitally
essential public transportation
service, demanding so much of
brain and brawn, so much for
efficiency and security, ought to
offer the moat attractive working
conditions and the highest of
wageii paid to workmen In any
employment.
In essentially every branch,
from track repairer to the man
at the locomotive throttle, the
rullroad worker Is responsible for
the safety of human lives and
the care of vast property. His
high responsibility might well
rate high his pay within the
limits the traffic will bear; but
the same responsibility, plus Gov
ernmental protection, may justly
deny him and his associates a
withdrawal from service without
a warning or under circumstances
which involve the paralysis
of necessary transportation. We
have assumed so great a responsi
bility In necessary regulation that
we unconsciously have assumed
the responsibility for maintained
service; therefore, the lawful
power for the enforcement of de
cisions Is ?ecessary to sustain
the majesty of government and
to administer to the public wel
fare.
DEFENDS TARIFF.
During Its longer session the
present Congress enacted a new
tariff law. The protection of the
American standards of Uvlng de
manded the Insurance It provides
against the distorted conditions of '
world commerce. The framers of ,
the law made provision for a cer
tain flexibility of customs duties,
whereby it is possible to readjust i
them as developing conditions may j
require. The enactment has im
posed a large responsibility upon
the Exacutive. but that responsi
bility will be discharged with a
broad mindfulness of the whole
business situation. The provi
sion itself admits either the pos
sible fallibility of rates or their
unsuitableness to changing condi
tions. I believe the grant of au
thority may be promptly and dis
creetly exercised, ever mindful of
the Intent and purpose to safe
guard American industrial activity,
and at the same time prevent the
exploitation of the American con
sumer and keep opeh the paths
of such liberal exchanges as do not
endanger our own productivity.
No one contemplates commercial
aloofness nor any other aloofness
contradictory to the best Ameri
can traditions or loftiest human
purposes. Our fortunate capacity
for comparative self-containment
affords the firm foundation on
which to build for our own se
curity, and a like foundation on
which to baild for a future of in
fluence and Importance in world
commerce. Our trade expansion
must come of capacity and of poli
cies of righteousness and reason
ableness In all our commercial re
lations.
FOREIGN POLICY.
Let no one assume that our
provlBlon for maintained rood
fortune at home, and our un
willingness to assume the correc
tion of all the Ills of the world,
means a reluctance to co-operate
with other peoples or to assume
every Just obligation to promote
human advancement anywhere In
the world.
War made us a creditor nation.
We did not seek an excess pos
session of the world'* gold, and
we have neither desire to profit
unduly by Its possession nor per
manently retain It. We do not
seek to become an International
dictator because of Its power.
The voice of the United State#
has a respectful hearing In In
ternational councils, because we
h^ve convinced the world that
we have no selfish ends to
serve. no old grievances to
avenge, no territorial or other
greed to satisfy. But the voice
being heard Is that of good coun
sel. not of dictation. It Is the
voice of sympathy and fraternity
and helpfulness, seeking to as
sist tfut not assume for the
United States burdens which na
tions must bear for themselves.
We would rejoice to help re
habilitate currency systems and
facilitate all commerce which does
not drag us to the very levels of
those we seek to Uft up.
ABUSE HOSPITALITY.
While I have everlasting faith
In our Republic, It would bo folly,
Indeed, to blind ourselves to our
problems at home. Abusing the
hospitality of our shores are the
advocates of revolution, finding
their deluded followers among
those who take on the habili
ments of an American without
knowing an American soul. There
is the recrudescence of hyphen
ated Americanism which we
thought to have been stamped
out when we committed the na
tion, life and soul, to the world
war. \
There la a call to make the
alien respect our Institutions while
ha accepts our hospitality. Thar*
J* net*! to magnify the American
viewpoint to the alien who seeks
a citizenship among us. There is
need to magnify the national
viewpoint to Americans through
out the land. More, there is a
demand for every living being In
the United States to respect and
abide by the laws of the Republic.
Let men who are rending the
moral fiber of the republic
through easy contempt for ths
prohibition law. because they
think it restricts their personal
liberty, remember that they set
the example and breed a con
tempt for law which will ulti
mately destroy the Republic.
Constitutional prohibition has
been adopted by the nation. It
is the supreme law of the land.
In plain speaking, there are con
ditions relating to its enforce
ment which savor of nation-wide
scandal. It is the most demoral
izing factor in our public life.
DRY LAW PROBLEMS.
Most of our people assumed that
the adoption of the Eighteenth
Amendment meant the elimination
of the question from our politics.
On the contrary, it has been bo
Intensified as an Issue that many
voters are disposed to make all
political decisions with reference
to this single question. It Is dis
tracting ths public mind and
prejudicing the Judgment of ths
electorate.
The day is unlikely to come when
the Eighteenth Amendment will
be repealed. The fact may as well
be recognized and our course
adapted accordingly. If the statu
tory provisions for its enforce
ment are contrary to deliberate
public opinion, which I do not be
lieve, the rigorous and literal en
forcement will concentrate publio
attention on any requisite modifi
cation. Such a course conforms
with the law and saves the humili
ation of the Government and the
humiliation of our people before
the world, and challenges the de
structive forces engaged in wide
spread violation, official corrup
tion. and individual demoralization.
The Eighteenth Amendment In
volves the concurrent authority of
State and Federal governments,
for the enforcement of the policy
It defines. A certain lack of I'efl
nitenees, through division of re
sponsibility, is thus introduced. In
order to bring about a full under
standing of duties and responsibili
ties as thus distributed, I purpose
to Invite the governors of the
States and Territories, at an early
opportunity, to a conference with
the Federal Executive authority.
Out of the full and free consider
ations which will tMis be possible.
It is confidently believed, will
emerge a more adequate compre
hension of the whole problem, and
definite policies of National and
State co-operation In administer
ing the laws.
There are pending bills for the
registration of the alien who has
corns to our shores. I wish ths
passage ot such an act might be
expedited. Life amid American
opportunities is worth the cost of
registration If It Is "worth the
seeking, and the Nation has ths
right 10 know who are citizens
In the making or who live among
us and share our advantages
while seeking to undermine our
cherished Inxtltutlons. This pro
vision will enable us to guard
against the abuses In Immigra
tion, checking the undesirable
whose Irregular coming Is his
first violation of our laws. Mor*.

RAPS CHILD LABOR.
Cloeely related to thla* problem
of education ia tha abolition of
child labor. Twice Congreaa haa
attempted tha correction of the
evlla Incident to child employment.
The dedaion of the Supreme Court
haa put thla problem outaide the
proper domain tot Federal regula
tion until the Oonatlttulon is ao
amended aa to give the Congreaa
Indubitable authority. I recom
mend the aubmlaaion of euch an
amendment.
We have two achoola of thought
relating to amendment of the Con
stitution. One need not be com
mitted to the belief that amend
ment ia weakening the fundamen
tal law. or that exceaalve Amend
ment la eeoential to meet every
ephemeral whim. We ought to
amend to meat the detnanda of the
people when aanctionod by delib
erate public opinion.
One year ago I suggested the
aubmlaaion of an amendment ao
that we may lawfully reatrict the
laauee of tax-exempt aecuritiee. and
1 renew that recommendation now.
Tax-exempt aecurltlea are drying
up the aourceo of Federal taxation
and they are enoouraglng unpro
ductive and extravagant expendi
turee by Statea and munlrlpalltiee.
There la more than the menace In
mounting public debt, there la tha
diaaipatlon of capital which ehould
be made available to the needa of
productive lnduatry. The propoaed
amendment will ? place the State
and Federal governmenta and all
political aubdivialona on an exact
equality, and will correct the grow
ing menace of public borrowing,
which If left unchecked may eoon
threaten the atabillty of our in
atltutiona.
OTHER PROBLEMS.
We are ao vaat and ao vfcried
in our national Interest* that
acorea of problems are preaaing
tor attention. I muat not risk the
wearying of your patience with
detailed reference.
Reclamation and irrigation pro
jects. where waarte land may be
made available for eettlement
and productivity, are worthy of
your favorable consideration.
When it la realised that we are
consuming our timber four timea
aa rapidly aa we are growing It.
we muat encourage the greatest
possible co-operation between tba
Federal Government, the varioua
States, and the owners of forest
lands, to the end that protection
from fires shall be made mora
effective and replanting encour
aged.
Tha fuel problem ia under etudy

ing commission, and any attempt
to deal with the coal problem, of
such deep concern to the entire
nation must await tha report of
the commission
There are necessary studies of
great problems which Congreaa
might well initiate. The wide
spread between production costs
and prlcea which conaumera pay
concerns every citizen of the Re
public. It contributes very large
ly to the unrest in agriculture
and must stand sponsor for much
against which we Inveigh in that
familiar term?the high coat of
living.
BLAMES CONSUMER.
No ona doubts tha excaoa la

dleman. bat It would be unfair to
charge blm with all responsibility
before we appralae what la ex
acted of him by our modem ly
complex life. We have attacked
the problem on one aide by the
promotion of co-operative market
ing, and we might well inquire
into the benettta of co-operative
buying. Admittedly. the con
sumer is much to blame himself.
NATIONAL DEFENSE.

datioa at war claim* and tba sst
tlement of war obligation* per
suadea me we ought to bo pre
pared for such universal call to
armed defense.
I brine you no apprehension of
war. The world la abhorrent of
It, and our own relation* are not
only free from every threatening
cloud, but we hare contributed
our larger Influence toward
making armed conflict leas likely
Those who assise that we played
our part In the world war and
later took ourashrss aloof and
apart, unmindful of world obli
gations, give scant credit to the
helpful part we assume In later
national relationships.
NAVY TREATY.
Whether all nations signatory
ratify all the treatlea growing oat
of the Washington Conference on
Limitation of Armament or eome
withhold approval, the underlying
policy of limiting naval armament
has the sanction of the larger
naval power*, and naval competi
tion la suspended. Of course,
unanimous ratification la much to
be deslrsd.
The four-power pact, which
abolishea every probability of war
on the Pacific, has brought new
confidence In a maintained peace,
and I can well believe It might
be made a model for like assur
ances wherever In the world any
common Interests are concerned.
We have had expressed the hos
tility of the American people to a
supergovemment or to any com
miunsnt where either a council or
an assembly of leagued power*
may chart oar course. Treatlee
of armed alliance can have no
likelihood of American sanction,
but we believe In respecting the
rigbta of nations. In the value of
conference and consultation. In the
effectiveness of leaders of nation*
looking each other in the toce be

RESULTS OF PACTS.
It haa been our fortune both
to preach and promote interna
tional understanding. The lnflu
! ence of the United States In
bringtng near the settlement of
an ancient dispute between South
American nations Is added proof
of the glow of peace In ample
undemanding. In Waahlngton
today are met the delegates of
the Central American nations, gath
ered at the table of International
understanding, to stablUa* their
republic* and remove every ves
tige of disagreement They are
met here by our Invitation, not
In our aloofness, and they accept
our hospitality because they have
faith in our unselfishness and
believe In our helpfulness Per
haps we are sslflsh In craving
their confidence and friendship,
but such a selfishness we pro
claim to the world, regardless of
hemisphere, or seas dividing.
SHIRK NO DUTY.
I would like the Oongrsss and
the people of the Nation to be
l'svs that In a firm and consider
ate way we are Insistent on Amer
can rights wherever they may be
questioned, and deny no right*
of others in the assertion of our
own. Moreover ws are cognisant
of ths world's struggles for full
readjustment and rehabilitation,
and we have ahirked no duty
which csmss of sympathy, or
fraternity, or highest fellowship

consonant with American Ideal*
? nd aanctloned under our form of
government Is willingly met
When we can not support ws do
not demsnd. Our constitutional
limitations do not forbid ths ex

After all there la leas difference
