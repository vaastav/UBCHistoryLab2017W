never happened," says Sergt. John F.
Davis, of this cuy, wno saw service
in Haltll. being, chief operator of the
radio station at Port Au Prince while
stationed there.
Sergt. Davis stated that the bandits
of Haltll try to rule the country as Is
the case In Mexico, and the disorders
which have happened there have all
arisen from this. Bandit chiefs there
collect a large band of plunderers and
make rains everywhere, tne marine
camps not being exempt from these
forays. A few of these bandits were
killed during such raids but always In
eelfdefense. In every combat of this
kind, however, the officers in charge
gave It their direct and best attentions,
stated Sergt. Davis, and so far as he
knows no cruelties resulted from these
raids. Sergt. Davis stated he heard
while there that marines who had been
murdered by the bandits were found
with their bodies preatly mutilated, the
hoiirt, brains and other vital parts hav
ing been removed.

while most of these have as their pur
pose the granting of. immediate aid in
agriculture In the face of the present
decline of prices for farm commodities

VALEDICTORY ON TREATY
(BY DAVID LAWRENCE 1
Washington, Dec. . (Copyright tor
The Chattanooga News.) President
llson deals with the treaty and
league of nations only In the moat ab
stract way In his annual message to
congress.
He does, however, make specific
reference t the state of the nation's
finances and seeks to put the burden
partly on the war. nartlv on the fall
lire of the laat congress to reduce the
coat of living and nartlv on the In
difference of the legislative body to
tne recommendations made hy the
Wilson administration In the laat ses
sion. The president Insists that our eco
nomic future depends "upon the main
tenance of tax receipts at a sufficiently
high level" and he emphasizes the
fundamental fact that "eeven and a
half hllllons of war Indebtedness ma
ture -within the next two and a half
years."
Mr. Wilson advocates economy, hut
brings out a fact seldom reallied about
the method of making appropriations,
namely, the practice of taklriR money
out of the so-called revolving funds.
The president couldn't resist the
temptation to point out by' Implica
tion that although the republican! In
the last congress boasted ahnut re
ducing the estimates of the executive
departments by a billion dollars, they
turned around and authorized the ex
penditure of over a billion dollars "In
nddlflon to the nmounts shown In the
usual complied statements of appropriations."
Takes Quirt Fling.
The president takes a quiet fling at
the people who Insisted UDon the
prompt return of the railroads to
private ownership by pointing out that
the finances of the entire government
have been disturbed "by the extraor
dinary burdens thrown upon the treas
ury by the transportation act." He
declares that over ' $1500,00,000 has al
ready been paid to the railroads and
that further payments estimated to
agcregate about 1650.000,000 more must
ull be paid to the railroads during
the current year
In other words, the president points
out that the railroads cost the gov
ernment In the nelghhorhod of a billion
dollars which wasn't mentioned very
much when the republicans were talk
ing about the amount of money they
saved during the last session.
Mr. Wilson's message was regarded
by many who heard it as having plainly
the partisan touch. It was looked upon
os a parting shot at the republicans who
shouted economy and are now con
fronted with the serious responsibility
of meeting seven and a half billion dol
lars of Indebtedness and other big ob
ligations. Mr. Wilson approves Sec
retary Houston's program for tax re
vision, whiA will be made public in his
annual report tomorrow.
To Prove U. S. Sincerity.
Specifically the president takes occa
sion to urge a loan for Armenia to be
supervised by a special commission and
he lays on the doorstep of congress a
recommendation that the Philippines be
given their Independence as a proof of
America's sincerity In talking about
self-determination for small nations.
The only reference to the tariff is a
suggestion that the manufacture of
dyestuffs and related chemicals be pro
tected. Mr. Wilson repetts the rec
ommendations he made to the repub
licans during the last congress, namely,
the passage of a cold storage law regu
lating the time that goods may be kept
in storage and the marking of prices on
every commodity shipped Interstate
commerce, including the selling or mar
ket price at the time the goods went
Into storage so that the purchaser might
be able to learn the profits of the mid
dle man. He also refers again to his
recommendation In regard to federal
licenses for all corporations engaged in
interstate commerce.
Treaty Valedictory.
The closing paragraph is looked upon
as a valedictory on the trenty question
and an earnest of Mr. Wilson's inten
tion to keep on fighting for the league
of nations. In his conclusion, the pres
ident said:
"I have not so much laid before you,
a series of recommendations, gentle
men, as sought to utter a confession of
faith, of the faith In which I was bred
and which it Is my solemn purpose to
stand by until my last fighting day. I
believe this to be the faith of America,
the faith of the future and of all the
victories which await national action
In the days to come, whether In Amer
ica or elsewhere."
The president did not go to congress.
Clerks read the message in each of the
two houses. Meanwhile, Mr. Wilson
himself chafed under the advice of his
physician and others In the household
who thought that while he might be
well enough to read the address, he
ought not take the risk of excitement
or the consequences of a wave of emo
tion In addressing congress for the last
time.

MANUFACTURERS WILL
BREAK WITH WORKERS
Boston, Mass . Dec. I. The clothing
manufacturer! of Boston voted Mon
day to break all relations with the
Amalgamated Clothing Workers of
America. Agreements which have
governed the employment of (.600 per

said to have been abrogated by the
workers union.
A formal letter of notification sent
to the Joint board. Amalgamated Cloth
ing Workers, declared that supple
mentary agreement which expired on
Deo. I, and the basic agreement be
tween the association and the Amal
gamated Clothing Workers' had been
"disregarded frequently" by the latter.
"These agreements," the letter con
tinued, "have proved a decided detri
ment to the clothing Industry In this
market and have so Ittcreased the cost
of producing that oday members of our
association are unable to manufacture
clothing at a price acceptable either
to the retailer or to consumer, as a re
sult of which practically all of their
shops are now closed.
"You have broken both agreements
at any time that It suited your fancy
to do so; you have disregarded, have
failed to enforce and, so far as you
w, re able, hsve nullified decisions by
the board of arbitration; some of your
business agreements have been unfair,
unscrupulous and untrustworthy; you
have allowed and encouraged Individ

encouraged deliberate restriction of
output by your members amounting at
times to as much as no per cent ; you
have called strikes: you hsve brought
about stoppages and have caused the
manufacturers serious pecuniary loss
by your refusal to finish out work, al
though the basic agreement to which
you ate signatory prohibits all such
actions."
The Clothing Manufacturers asso
ciation embraces as members 76 per
cent of the clothing manufacturing
firms of the city and the other H per

Rickets, a student of the University of
Chicago and super-hiker, on a hike

went considerably out of his way to
see York. His Interview with the
lionised soldier gave him the Impres
sion that Sergt. York Is about the
most modest man in all the Cumber
lands Fact Is, York almost refused
to talk about himself, but was very
solicitous about the comfort of the
strange hiker whom he had never be
fore seen. As a farmer, the World war
hero has constructed a new bam and
made other Improvements about the
place. Mr. Blckets camped near the
