Significance In Names.
In an Illinois town a workingman
having been informed that a sixth

bors, referring to bis having given
that name—Sufficient—to the new

The incident resembles a case nearer
home, adds the New York Tribune.
A New York family was blessed with
nine daughters, when the stork
brought a tenth one. It was In the
days when the slang term for an oft

word was employed, and she was
called Marron.

Benevolence is a great thing. When

buy any clothing for themselves. While

PRESIDENT POINTS OUT NECES
SITY OF CURTAILING EXPEN
SES TO LAWMAKERS.
ANNUAL DOCUMENT IS READ
Conservation, Ship Subsidy and For
tification of Panama Canal Lead
ing Topics Discussed—Has
Little to Say About Tariff.
Washington, Dec. 6.—Economy In
government affairs Is the keynote of
President Taft's annual message read
before both houses of congress today.
The message approximates 40,000
words and Is one of the longest ever
submitted by a president.
Conservation of the public domain,
ship subsidy, tonification of the Pana
ma canal and the continuation of the
present tariff board are the leading
subjects touched upon. He also re
views the work of the various gov
ernment departments and concurs In
recommendation, tending toward the
bettering of the service, made by sev
eral of the members of his cabinet.
Economy Is Urged.
In dwelling on the urgent need for
economy In government expenditures, the
president says: "Every effort has been
made by each department chief to reduce
the estimated cost of his department for
the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30,
1912. I say this In order that congress
may understand that these estimates thus
made present the smallest sum which will
maintain the departments, bureaus and
•dices of the government and meet its
other obligations under existing law, and
that a cut of these estimates would re
sult in embarrassing the executive branch
of the government In th« performance of
Its duties. This remark does not apply
to the river and harbor estimates, except
to those for expenses of maintenance and
the meeting of obligations under author
ized contracts, nor does it apply to the
public building bill nor to the navy build
ing program. Of course, as to these con
gress could withhold any part or all of
the estimates for them without interfer
ing with th* discharge of the ordinary ob
ligations of these functions of its depart
ments. bureaus and offices.
"Against the estimates of expenditures
1640,494,013.12, we have estimated receipts
for next year $680,000,000, making a proba
ble surplus of ordinary receipts over or
dinary expenditures of about $60,000.000, or
taking into account the estimates for the
Panama canal, which are $56,920,847.69, and
which will ultimately be paid in bonds,
it will leave a deficit for the next year of
about $7,000,000, if congress shall conclude
to fortify the canal."
Want« Forest Limitation Removed.
On the subject of conservation he de*
votes considerable space to forest, coal,
oil and gas, phosphate lands and water
power sites. As to the reservation of
forest lands he says: "The law now pro
hibits the reservation of any more forest
lands in Oregon. Washington, Idaho,
Montana. Colorado and Wyoming, except
by act of congress. I am informed by the
department of agriculture that the gov
ernment owns other tracts of timber land
in these states which should be included
in the forest reserves. I recommend to
congress that the limitation herein im
posed be repealed.
"Congress ought to trust the executive
to use the power of reservation only with
respect to land most valuable for forest
purposes. During the present administra
tion. 62.250,000 acres of land largely non
timbered have been excluded from forest
reserves, and 3,500,000 acres of land prin
cipally valuable for forest purposes have
been Included in forest reserves, making
a reduction in forest reserves of non
timbered land amounting to 2,750,000
icfes."
(
The president urges such action as he
believes will increase American trade
abroad. and says::
"Another instrumentality indispensable
to the unhampered and natural develop- |
ment of American commerce is merchant i
marine. All maritime and commercial na- |
tions recognize the importance of this |
factor. The greatest commercial nations, j
our competitors, jealously foster their |
merchant marine. Perhaps nowhere is •
the need for rapid and direct mall, pas- ;
senger and freight communication quite
so urgent as between the United States •
and Latin America. We can secure In no I

tolls and management are made, and re
garding fortification of the canal, he
says:
"Among questions arising for present
solution Is the decision whether the canal
shall be fortified,
to the congress that I strongly favor for
tification and I now reiterate this opin
ion and ask your consideration of the
subject In the light of the report already
before you made by a competent board.
"Failure to fortify the canal would
leave the attainment of both these aims
in the position of rights and obligations
which we should be powerless to enforce
and which could never In any way be ab
solutely safeguarded against a desperate
and irresponsible enemy."

Criticism of the Tariff.
In the apace devoted to the tariff th*
president says:
"The schedules of the ratés of duty In
the Payne tariff act have been subjected
to a great deal of criticism, some of It
• just, more of it unfounded, and too much
misrepresentation. The art was adopted
in pursuance of a declaration by the par
ty which is responsible for it that cus
toms blli should be a tariff for the pro
tection of home industries, the measure
of the protection to be the difference be
tween the cost of producing the imported
article abroad and the cost of producing
it at home, together with such addition to
that difference as might give a reasonable
profit to the home producer. The basis
for the criticism of this tariff is that in
respect to a number of the schedules the
declared measure was not followed, but a
higher difference retained or inserted by
way of undue discrimination in favor of
certain industries and manufactures. Lit
tle, if any, of the criticism of the tariff
has been directed against the protective
principle above stated: but the main body
of the eriticism has been based on the at
temft to conform to the measure of pro
tection was not honestly and sincerely
adhered to."
The president also refers to the appoint
ment of a board of experts to Investigate
the cost of production of various article»
included in the schedules of the tariff,
and concludes:
"Whether or not the protective policy Is
to be continued, and the degree of protec
tion to be accorded to our home indus
tries, are questions which the people must
decide through their chosen representa
tives. But whatever policy is adopted, it
Is clear that the necessary legislation
should be based on an Impartial, thor
ough and continuous study of the facts."
Recommends Parcels Post.
The adoption of the parrels post is
again adopted. On this subject President
Taft says: ''With respect to the parcels
post, I respectfully recommend its adop
tion on all rural delivery routes, and that
11 pounds—the international limit—be
made the limit of carriage In such post.
The same argument is made against the
parcels post that was made against the
postal savings bank—that it is Introduc
ing the government into a business which
should be conducted by private persons
and is paternalism. The postoffice depart
ment has a great plant and a great or
ganization, reaching into the most remota
hamlet of the United States, and with
this machinery It is able to do a great
many things economically that if a new
organisation were necessary It would bo
impossible to do without extravagant ex
penditures."
Department of Justice.
Discussing the affairs of the department
of justice, the president says:
"I Invite especial attention to the prose
cutions under the federal law of the so
called
'buckst shops,' and of those
schemes to defraud In which the use of
the mail is an essential part of the
fraudulent conspiracy, prosecutions which
have saved ignorant and weak members
of the public and are saving them hun
dreds of millions of dollars. The viola
tions of the anti-trust law present per
haps the most important litigation before
the department, and the number of cases
filed shows the activity of the govern
ment in enforcing that statute.
"In a special message last year I
brought to the attention of congress the
propriety and wisdom of enacting a gen
eral law providing for the Incorporation
of Industrial and other companies engaged
in interstate commerce, and I renew my
recommendation In that behalf."
The crying need in the United States
of cheapening the cost of litigation by
simplifying judicial procedure and ex
pediting final Judgment is pointed out and
action looking to correction of these evils
is urged.
The president recommends an increase
In the salaries of federal judges.
Postal Affairs.
In regard to postal matters the presi
dent points with pride to its present effi
cient management and the recent reduc
tion in the deficit. The present unre
stricted franking privilege comes in for
comment with a suggestion for the adop
tion of better methods for its regulation.
Aboli$h Navy Yard$.
The president calls attention to certain
reforms urged by the secretary of the
navy which he recommends for adoption,
and continues:
"The secretary of the navy has given
personal examination to every navy yard,
and has studied the uses of the navy
yards with reference to the necessities
of our fleet. With a fleet considerably
less than half the size of that of the
British navy, we have shipyards more
than. double the number, and there are
several of these shipyards expensively
equipped with modern mchlnery, which,
after investigation the secretary of the
navy believes to be entirely useless for
naval purposes. He asks authority to
abandon certain of them and to move
their machinery to other places, where it
can be made of use."
Speaking of our foreign relations the
president says: "During the past year
the foreign relations of the United States
have continued upon a basis of friendship
and good understanding.
"The year has been notable as witness
ing the pacific settlement of two impor
tant international controversies before the
permanent court of The Hague.
"The arbitration of the fisheries dispute
between the United States and Great
Britain, which has been the source of
nearly continuous diplomatic correspond
( ence since the fisheries convention of 1818,
has given an award which is satisfactory
to both parties. This arbitration is par
ticularly noteworthy not only because of
the eminently just results secured, but
| also because it is the first arbitration held
i under the general arbitration treaty of
| April 4, 1908, between the United States
| and Great Britain, and disposes of a con

Restored Con
Are the great financiers of the
country beginning to see a new light?
Time was, until recently In fact, when
the men at the head of the big cor
porations "kept their business to
themselves," as far as the law would
allow. Capable men at the head of the
big concerns, long realized the weak
ness of their position, but what was
needed obviously, as In all great re
forms, was an unmistakable occasion
and a courageous man. The occasion
arose In the purchase of the Western
Union Telegraph company by the
American Telephone and Telegraph
company, and the man appeared m
Theodore N. Vail, President of Che
purchasing corporation.
It was last December when public
announcement was made that the
Gould holdings of Western Union had
been taken over by the Telephone
company.
On account of the high esteem In |
which the management of the tele
phone company Is so generally held,
great things were predicted as a re
sult of the absorption of Western
Union. By the press of the country
the "deal
was most favorably com
mented on, It being widely pointed
out that under the direction of such
men as Theodore N. Vail and his as
sociates, the telegraph company was
bound soon to work itself Into a po
sition where It could offer the public
far more efficient service than it had
ever before been able to offer.
But a very few months had elapsed
when It became apparent to the new
management that a modern and up
to-date appraisal of the company's
assets would make possible a
greater degree of efficiency of oper
ation. "Here," they said to them
selves, "we've bought control of this
property and we know It's Immensely
valuable, but we don't
how valuable.

These appraisals of
real estate and securities owned were
made a long time ago. If we have
a complete Inventory made of every
thing we've got we can announce the
facts to the public, start a new set of
books, and begin our responsibility
to stockholders right there."
How Inventory Was Taken.
The most expert accountants and
appraisers to be had were put at the
task. Their labors lasted over eight
months. Their report and Its publi
cation by the company marks an ep
och In finance.
It began by recommending an ad
justment of the difference between
the appraised and book values by a
charge of *5,595,089 against
plus. Book values of securities held
were reduced to market values, bad
and doubtful accounts were "charg
ed off," an allowance of $2,000,000
was made for "depreciation," another
of 8500,000 for "reserve," and so on,
until the old surplus of *18,867,000
came down to *5,136,000.
It required courage, the publication
of this statement to stockholders, say
ing In effect: "The property of
your company has been reval
ued: the surplus isn't nineteen mill
ions, as you have been led to be
lieve, but five millions," but it was
the truth, and President Vail did not
flinch. Accuracy ana publicity," he
declared, was essential. "The stock
holder has a right to know. The
shares of this company are scatter
ed from one end of the Union to the
other. This Is more than a private
corporation. It Is a great national
enterprise. The public is entitled to
the facts."

stayed up. The public had respond

frankness and confidence; to the new
motto, "Accuracy and Publicity."
The full significance of the action
of the new board is stated concisely |
by Harper's Weekly In these words:
"Is this policy of publicity and of i
open-handed dealing with sharebold- |
ers and public the forerunner of a
similar movement on the part of oth
er big corporations? Certainly it is
to be hoped that It is. In the case
of these big companies, dependent
upon public patronage and doing busi
ness under public franchise, can
there be any question of the right of
the people to know?
"That right Is being recognized.
It Is recognised now In this epochal
act on the part of the telephone and
telegraph interests. It Is the dawn
of a new era In corporation finance."
