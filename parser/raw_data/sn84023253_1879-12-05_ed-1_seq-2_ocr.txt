Our Indian Policy.
Mr. Edilor : Tbere is much said iu
these days about tbe "wards of the ua
tion" as uiucb as to say tbat tbey
uever bad auy rigbts of their own, but
had souiehow falleu upon our cbarity
witbout any business. We believe tbe
wbites will have an account to settle iu
the future, that tbey will be both sorry
aud ashained of. We believe our peo
ple have not used very good sense iu
regard to this qucstion. We have acted
as tbougb the Indian was already civil
ized, and as nmeuable to the general
law as tbo white. Tbis is uot true, nor
is it likely to prove so for some tiuic to
coine. It dou't help us auy to say tbe
Indian is a "savage," aud must be "ex-
termiuated" as tbe best aud quickest
way tct settle this question. Why uot
use the same argumeut in regiird to
otber weak and uncivilized peoples?
And after this,continue theRame policy
and let the stronger civilized power eat
up tbe weaker one 1
Now, when tbe trutb is told, tbe
Indian behaves full as well for wbat be
knowfl and is responsible for, as tbe
white man does. Tbat weaker powers,
accoriling to a law of nature, must in
evitably give way to the strouger in
piocess of time, is undoubtedly true.
But we don't believe this process con-
sists Iu premeditated destrnction. Tbe
Iudian to-day is ouly doing for bis own
pieservation, wbat tbe white man would
do for bis. He is obeying tbo same in
stiuctive law tbe white obeys. He is
said to be treacberous. Cannot the
same be said of tbe white also t
In tbese days be borrows some of bis
policy from the wbites. He kuows as
well as we do, wbicb is tbe stronger
power, and ne is domg bis best to head
it off. We believe our goverument bas
been too temporiziog in its policy. Tbe
Iudian isu't so big a fool as not to have
uoticed tbis. If tbo papers are correct.
government bas not been Iionorable in
its treaties witb its wards, Ifc works
like tbis: White men covet certain ter
ritary occupied by Indians, and are ile
tcrmined they tcill have it. Tbe Indian
endeavors to assert and maintain bis
rigbts, kills a few wbites, burns a few
cabins, aud steals all he can. Tben
comes tbe soldier, and an "Indian "War,"
sealed with blood, mnrder, and tbe
waste of untold treasure. Of course tbe
"ward" gets beaten in tbo long rnn, and
tbe white man is glad, bccause he gets
just xchat heplanned to get !
In making treaties witb tbe Iudiaus,
or ngreetnents, the government assigns
to them certain territory, or ''reserva
tions," for tbeir exclusive benefit. "But
now for several years government bas
been trotting tbese "wards" back and
fortli, frora tbis reservation to tbat, un
til tbey have become disbeartened at
tbe situation, tbe white squatter takes
advantage of it, and so tbe trouble
goes ou.
We dou't pretend to know just wliat
tbo exact policy sliould be in tbis mat
ter. But one thiug looks perfectly
clear, and tbat is, tbe goveruinent ought
to have a more stable and sensible In
dian policy tban it bas yet bad. Wbeu
it says to the Indian be sball have and
possess for bis own, certain territory,
let the qovernment stich to its bargain,
and protect and raaintain those lights
for tbe Iudian, tbe same as it would for
tbo white. We believe to day, that
tbe Indian would respect tbo wisbes of
government, if tbe white could be rnade
to mind bis own business, and to let
him alonc. Tbis talk of "exteiraina
tion" that some people indnlge in so
frecly, is as shallow as it is barbarous.
We have no more right to exterminato
an Indian tban we have a negro, or tbe
unfortunato paupers we have in our
niidst. I would not be uujust, but it
doessometinies seem tbat many wbites
were not niuch more civilized thaih tbe
Indian. We have wbites to-day who
would niake a "turkey shoot" of our
paupers setting them up at teu cents
i bead, in order to pay for tbo powder,
aud to get rid ot tnxation.
Now, if by our superior advautages
us a people iu cultivation, baving in-
telligence, refinement, wisdom, and
Christianity, let us sbow our supcriority
to the savages. If the savages kill, let
us try and save life. If tbey burn and
pillage, let us set a better example. If
tbey are treacberous and unreliable, let
uot tbe white do tbe same.
The Britisb government in Cauada
bas uot had one tentb part of tlio trou
ble witb tbe Iudians residing tbere,
that we have had with ours. Tbe policy
of good old William Penn was worth
more tban all of the soldiers aud gen-
erals we have iu the fleld to-day. That
policy lasted undisturbcd for a great
many years. Lossiug, the bistoriau,
has said, "not a drop of Quaker blood
was ever shed by an Indian." Tbe
avariciousuess of tbe white is wbat
niakes all tlio trouble, and just so loug
as tbis cause is allowed to exist, just so
long sball we have tbis trouble to con
tend witb. F. V. Powers.

Vermont's Next Governor.
Frcderick Billiugs is tbe most promi-
neut aud imposiug name, outside tbe
state ; and is pressed upon Vermont by
ber jourualistic Irionds ubroad, like
tbat of Bayard upon the democrutic
party, asoue emiueutlv Ot for tbe place.
There is no doubt that Mr. Billiugs is
asmart mau, aud persoually irreproach
able, tbougb tbere are some wbo are
toud ot mentioumg bim as "Park's
pious partuer." But those who kuow

tbese men were in Califoruia aud else-
where know tbat Mr. Billiugs uever bad

But tbat is uot all, nor the vorst of it.

tbat Mr. Billiugs bas uot had a great

As to Mr. Billiugs, it is uot true tbat
he bas uot identiiied bimself witb tbe
people of Vermont, tbougb it is true
tbat be lesorts to uoue of tbe arts of
tbe demagogue. It is nut true tbat he
spends little of bis money bere, tbougb
it is true tbat he mvests uoue as a po-
litical bid. It is uot true tbat he cher-
isbes bitterness ou accouut of bis for
mer defeat in conventiou, tbougb be
may have lelt a little natural resent
ment at tbe time, for he bas beeu benrd
to express admiiation for the tactics
that tbrew bim, and friendly regard for
his opponents. It is not true tbat tbose
wbo opposed bim tben onposebim now.
Ou the contrary, tbe very leaders of
that oppositiou, (witb the possible ex
ception of Gov. Stewart, witb wbose
views we are not tamiliar,) are now iu
his favor, believing tbat tbe objectious
tben raised are not now tenable, and
tbat bis nouiinatiou now would be one
preeminently flt to be made. It is not
true tbat Gov. Smitb was theu bis ene

tuat convention made a very uue ini

him to conseut to be be a candidate for
tbe office of governor. Ifc was tbe gen

tueniuers ol tbe Geueral Assemblv. ac
cept an election to tbe biennial term as
equivaleut to two elections under the

sured Mr. Billings tbat tbe field was
open. uov. Stewart dallied with tbe
question uutil be had given Mr. Bil
lings and all bis friends a fair opportu
nity to press his uoniinution and until.
as the result proved, it was impossible
for bim, bowever much at the last he
may have desired it, to obtaiu a re-
nomination. For, if Gov. Stewart had
made it kuown in season tbat be would
be a candidate for a second term, Mr.
Billings of course would not have beeu
a candidate, and his reelection would
bave defeated the bad precedent, bad
esneciallv as it bears upon the compo-
sition of tbe General Assembly, of a
single term. Mr. Billings gave jio per
soual atteution to bis canvass. He
was out of the state most of tbe time
durinir its progress, and came up from
New York at tlie last moment to accept
tbe nomination wbicb be was assured
awaited bim at tbe Montpelier conveu
tion. But to bis gieat surprise be was
called upou to make at tbat conven
tion, an entirely different speecb from
the one whicb be was expecting to
make. J&is conduct tben was not ouly
beyond precedent but beyond the ca
pacitv probably of any other man in
Vermont. He was called upon to go
upon tbe stage aud make a speech, aud
be at once responded to tbe call, aud
as a defeated candidate made a speecb
wbicb electiilied and captivuted that
entire convention, aud produced an im
pression whicb abides witb all wbo
beard it to this day. n that speech
bad preceded the ballot, Mr. Billiugs'
nomination would have beeu made ir
resistible. As it was, the convention.
at ouce, and, as soon as tbe effect of
that speech was disseminated abroad,
tbe state at Iarge, very deeply regret
ted bis defeat.
The fact tbat Vermont leads tbe van
in next year's elections, wbeu it is so
important tbat the republican candi
date for goveiuor sbould rcceive the
full vote, will bave great inlliieiice in

Fellow Cithens of the Senatc and Ilouse
of llcprcsentativcs :
The incmbeis of tbe 46th Cougress
have assembled iu tbeir first regular

uiutual cougratulation aud grateful ac
kuowledgement to the Giverof all good
for the large and uuusual luoasuie of

RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS.
The most iuteresting eveuts whicb
bave occuried iu our public all'airs since
my last annual message to Cougress are
connccted witb the fiuancial opcratious
of the goverument dircctly aflecting the
business intoiesls of the couutry. I cou
gratulate Cougress on the successful
executiou of tbe resumption act. At tbe
time tixed, aud in tbe manucr contem
plated by law, United States notes be
gan to be redeemed iu coin. Since tbe
lst of Januaiy last tbey have been
promptly redeemed on preseiitatiou,
and in all business transuctions, public
and private, iu all parts of tbe couutry,
tbey are received and paid out as the
equivaleut of coin. Tbe deinand upou
the treasury forgoldaud silver iu ex
change for United States notcs bas beeu
comparatively small, aud tbe voluntary
deposit of coin and bulliou in esqbangc
for notes bas beeu very largc. The ex
cess of tbe precions metals deposited or
excbanged for Uuited States notes ov;r
tbe amount of United States notes re
deemed is about $40,000,000.
BUSINESS REVIVAL AND REFUNDING.
The resumption of specie payments
bas beeu followed by a very great le
vival of business. With a currency
equivaleut in value to tbe money of tbe
commercial world, we are ena'bled to
enter upou an equal competition witb
otber uatious iu trade aud production.
The increasing foreign demand .for our
manufactuers and agricuitural products
bas caused a laige balance of trade in
our favor, wbicb bas beeu paid iu gold,
from the 1st of July last, to November
15, to the amount of about $59,000,000.
Since tbe resumption of specie pay
ments there bas also been a marked and
gratifyiug improvement of tbe public
credit. Tbe bonds of tbe government
bearing ouly four per ceutinteresthave
been sold at or above par, suffieieiit iu
amouut to pay off all of the uational
debt, which was redeemable under
preseut laws. The amouut of interest
savedaunually by tbe process ofrefund
ing tbe debt, siuce Marcb 1 1877, is
$14,297,177. The bonds sold were
largely iu small sums, aud the nnniber
of our citizens now holdiug tbe public
securities is much greater tban ever be
fore. Tbe amouut of tbe uational debt
wbicb matures witbin less than two
years is $792,121,700, of whicb $500,
000,000 bear interest at the rate of 5 per
ceut, and the balance is in bonds bear
ing 6 per cent interest. It is believed
that tbis part of tbe public debt can be
refunded by tbo issue of 4 per ceut
bonds, aud by tbe redaction of interest
wbicb will tbus bo effected, about $11,
000,000 can be annually saved to tbe
treasurv. To securo tbis important re-

is rcquired, whicb, it is hpped, will be

POLYGAilY.
Tbe coutinued deliberate violation
by a large nnmber of the proroinent
and inflneutial citizens of tbe territory
of Utab of tbo laws of tbe United States
for tbe prosecution and punishment of
polygamy dcmauds the atteution of
every departmeut ot the government,
This territory bas a population sufficient
to eutitle it to admission as a state. aud
the geueral interests of tbe nation, as
well as tbe welfare of tbo citizens of tbe
territory, require its advance from the
territorial form of goverument to tbe
responsibilities and privilege of a state.
Tbis important chaniie will uot. how
over,be approved by tbe country while
the citizens of Utab in very considerable
nnmber uphoid a practice wbicb is cou
demued as a crime by tbe laws ofall
civilized communities tbroughout tbe
world. J no law tor the suppression ot
tbis offense was cnacted witb great
uuanimity b- Cougress more thau 17
vears ago, but bas remaiued until re
cently a dead letter iu tbe territory of
Utab, bccause ot tbe peculiar diHiculties
attending its entorcemeut. Tbe opinion
.videly jirevailed among the citizens of
Utab tbat the law wasm contravention
of the coustitutional guarautee of reli-
gious freedom. The supreme court of
the United States has dcculed the law
to bo witbin tbo legislative power of
Congress, aud bmdiug as a rule ot ac
tion for all wbo resido witbin tbe terri
tories. Tbere is no longer any reason
for delay or besitation iu its euforce-
nieut. It sbould be firmly and effect
ively executed. If not sufflciently strin
gcut in its provisions, it sbould be
amcuded, and in aid ot the purpose in
view, I reccommend tliat more compre-
hensive and more searcbing metbods
for preventing as well as punishing this
ctime Do provided. It necessary to se
cure obedieuce to tbo law, tbe cnjoy
ment and exercise of tbo rigbts of cifi
zeuship in the territories of tbe United
States may be withbeld or witbdrawn
from tbose who violato or oppose tbe
enforceinent of tbe law on this subject.
PROTECTION OF CIVIL RIGIITS.
The elections of the pastyear, tbougb
occujiied ouly witb state offices bave
not failed to elicit in tbe political dis
cussions whicb attended them all over
tbe country, new and decisive evidence
of tbe deep interest wbicb tbe great
body of citizens take in tbe progress of
the country toward a more geueral and
coniplete establisbuient. at wlmteyer
post, of universal security and freedom
iu the exereise of tbe elective francbise.
While many topics of political conceru
demand great atteution from our pco
ple, both in the spliere of natioual aud
state autbority, I fiud no reasou to
qnalify tbo opinion I cxpressed in my
last annual message, tbat uo temporary
or admiuistrative interests of govern
inent, however urgent or weigbty, will
ever displaco the zeal of our people in
defeuse of the. primary rigbts of citizen
sbi), and that the power of public
opinion will overrideall political preju
dices and all sectional and state attach
inents, in deuianding that all over our
wide tenitory the name and cbatacter
of citizeu of the Uuited States shall
niean one aud the same thiug, and car
ry witbthcui unchallanged security and
respect. I eainestly appeal to tbe in
telligence aud patiiotism of all good
citizens of every part of tbe country,
however mnch tbey may bo divided iu
opiuions on otber political subjects, to
unite iu compulling obedieuce to exist
ing laws aimed at tbe protection of the
right of snffrage. I respectfully urge
upon Cougress to supply any defects iu
tbese laws which experieuco bas showu
and whith it is witbin its power to
rcniedy. I agaiu invoke tbo coopcra
tion of tbe execntivc and legislative
autborities of tbe states iu tbis great
purpose. I ani fully conviuced tbat if
tbe public mind can be set at rest ou
tbis paramouut question of popular
rigbts, no serious obstacle will thwart
or delay tbe coniplete pacitication of
tbe country or retaid the general diffu
sion of prosperity.
CIV1L bERVICE REFORM.
Tbo Presideut devotes a largo space
iu his message to tbo civil servico. He
makes tbe occasion of presenting the
report of the Civil Servico Commissiou
the occasion for a full discussion of the
subject. Tbo Presideut divides tbe
public service iuto two brauches. One
brancb cousists of those oflicei-s elected
by a people to carry out a given policy
and their advisers. These sliould be
expected to be in harmouy witb the
party electiug tbem, aud will be ex
pected to retire at tbe expiratiou of
their teruis of office. The olbers, cm
braciug all ofUcers who till subordinatc
places, sbould be permitted to bold
tbeir positions aud discbariie their du
ties irrespective of pattisan politics
Tbo Presideut devotes cousiderablc
ible
space to the bistory of competitive ex-
aiuinalious since loaJ, and calls atten
tion to tbe good results whicb bave at
tended the receut experiments in sever
al brauches of publie service. The
presideut denouuccs political assess
meuts as wrong, and, while not dcGn
ing tbo extent to which Federal offlcers
may engage iu political actiou, says
that it sbould uot be peiiuitted to an
exteut that will intcifero witb the
proper discharge of oflicial duties, aud
sbould uever be used as a nieans to
enforce opiuions or coerce tbe political
actions of otbers.

Tbo Piesident informs Congiess tbat

Marshalls duriug tbe extra session, to

AGRICULTURE AND EDDCATION.
My recommcudations in' former mes
sages are reuewed iu favor of enlarg
ing tbe facilities of tbo departmeut of
agriculture. Agriculturo is tbe leading
interest and the permanent industry of
our people. It is to tho abundance of
agricuitural productiou, as compared
witb our bome cousumptiou, and tbe
largely-increased aud higbly profitable
market abroad which we bave enjoyed
in recent years, tbat we, are mainly in
debted for our-preseut prosperity as a
people. We must look tor its contiu
ucd maintenauce to the same substau
tial resource. Tbere is no branch of
industry in which labor, directed by
scientific knowledge, yields such in
creased production in comparisou with
nnskilled labor, aud no brauch of tbo
public service to whicb the encourage
ment of liberiil appropriations can be
more appropriately extended. Tbe
omissiou to lender such aid is not a
wise economy; but, on tbo contrary
undoubtedly results in losses of im-
mensc sums anuually tbat migbt be
saved througb well-directed eflbrts by
tbe goverument to promote tbis vital
iuterest. Tbe lesults already accom
plished witb tbo very limited means
beretofore placed at tbe command of
tbe departmeut of agriculture is au
earncst'of wbat may be expected witb
increased aDnronriatious for tbe sever
al purposes iudicated in the report of
tue commissiouer, with a view to plac
iug tbe departmeut upon a footing
which will enable it to prosecute moie
effectively tbo objects for wbicb it is
establisbed. Appropriations are need
ed for a more coniplete laboratory, for
tbe establisbuient of a veteriuary divis
ionj aud a division of forestry, and for
an increase of force. The requiremonts
for these and other purposes, iudicated
iu the report of the coinmissiouer under
tbe bead of the immediate uecessities
of tbe departmeut, will not involve an v
expeuditure of money tbat the coun
try cannot witb propriety now under
tako iu the interests of agriculture.
It isgratifying to leam from tbe bn
leau of education the extent to wbicb
educational privileges tbroughout the
United Mates have been advanced dur
iug the past year. No more funda-
mental respousibility rests upou Cou
gress than that of dcvisiug appropriate
measures of fiuancial aid to education,
supplemeutal to local action iu tbe
states and territories, and in tbe Dis
trict of Columbia. The wise fore-
tbought of tho fouuders of our govcrn
uieut bas uot only furnished the basis
lor the support of the commou school
systeins of tbe newer states, but laid
tbe fouudations for the maiutenaiice of
tbeir uuivei-sities aud colleges of agii-
culturc aud the uiecbauic arts. Meas
ures in accordanco witb tbis traditioual
policy for tbo benefit of all these inter
ests, aud tbo exteusion of the same
advautages to every tiortion of the
couutry, it is hoped, will rcceive your
iavorauic cousideratiou.
