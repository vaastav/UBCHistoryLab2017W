nereral days old, and as a "brcalh may mar"
speculations based on such vonerable news
the market has sol tied into stagnation. The
extreme fluctuation yesterday was only one
eighth of one per cent, which is pretty nearly
as little as it may be, considering that the
rules of tho Board forbid a finer s jbdiviaion
of the quotation. After the Board, however,
and pending it, sub rota, sales were made at
the intermediate one-sixteenth per cent,
which shows that the gold brokers can "split

Oar BblryiH >?< Fw?l|i Commerce? How
tm Ur^ive It.
Congress seems to be waking up to the ne
cessity of doing something to restore our ship
ping interests and the former maritine presliga
of the country. During the last session sev
eral bills were introduced for this object, but
nothing was accomplished ? no, not even whoa
the President called upon that body at the last
houra of the session to remain over a short
time for the purpose of seizing the opportunity
RiTorded by tho European war to increase our
shipping. It may be, however, a hopeful sign
that Congress has begun thus early in the
present session to work upon this subject. On
Monday Mr. McDonald, of Arkansas, Intro
duced a bill in the Senate to aid the Medi ter
ranean and Oriental Steam Navigation Com
pany ; Mr. Ramsey, of Minnesota, to supply
ocean steamship lines for tho transportation of
tho mail* between the United States and
Europe ; and Mr. Schenck, in the House, the
(tame or a similar measure to that of Mr. Ram
sey. Without going into the merits of these
propositions at the present time, we do not
hesitate to say that the time has come when
something should be done to restore tho mari
tine interests of the country, and that while
Congress should not favor any jobs it ought to
strain a point on the Bide of liberality where
our skipping cab be increased and the publio
service promoted.
The subject of our foreign commerce is now
before three committees of tho House of Rep
resentatives. The Committee of Wava and
Means got control of it through the reference
of the President's special Message to Congress
in the expiring hours of the last session. The
Committee on Commerce has got control of it
through the reference of that portion of tho
President's last annual Menage which relates
to the decay of American shipping; and the
select committee on the subject, which was
appointed at tho first session of tho present
! Congress, on the 22d of March, 186JJ, has
special control of it. These three committees
are expected to hold a conference together and
agr e to some definite plan for tho revival of
our foreign shipping interests.
It will be recollected that tho bill reported
at the last session from the select committee
proposed to remedy the evil by the remission
of duties on all materials entering into the
construction of ships, nod also by a system of
subsidies under which American vessels en
gaged in the foreign carrying trade for more
than six months in the year should be paid out
of the federal Treasury at the rate of from a
dollar and a half per registered ton for sail
vessels up to four dollars per registered ton
for steamers, besides being allowed ship's
stores and coal free of duty. That bill was
discussed at pretty considerable length, but
failed to receive the support of a majority of
members. The bill reported from the Com
mittee of Ways and Means in the last
hour of the session contained the
principle of allowing a drawback on the
material used in shipbuilding, coupled, how
ever, with the more important principle of
allowing foroign-built ships to be owBed and
registered by American citizens. This bill
failed for want of time? a fow dilatory motions
being all that was necossiry to prevent the
House voting upon it before tho hour fixed for
the flnal adjournment.
It will be seen that the bill, as reported
from the select com nittee, was one which
aimed at reviring oir foreign commerce
through the chenpo'iicg of American built
vessels and thus giving a stimulus at the samo
time to the shipbuilding interest of the United
States, while the bill coming from tho Ways
and Means aimed at more immediate results
through the purchase and registry of foreign
built chips.
The two propositions, it will tje seen,
although made composite* by the Committee of
Ways and Me^ns, are diametrically opposed
to each other. If our shipping merchants be
permitted to purchase ships built on the Clyde
?ud Thames there wiil not be much ship
building done on the Kennebec or the Hudson;
and while our foreign commerce may revive
there will be no corresponding advantage to
oar shipbuild?r3. This presents the great
difficulty wh'ch yet awaits its solution. The
shipbuilders claim that the impetus must come
from them. The shipowners claim that noth
ing but free trade in ships can ever restore to
the United Stutes the prestige which it once
held in the carrying trade of the world.
In th'3 meantime all the great shipping
yards of the country are closed up. The
Webbs and the Westervelta and the Mc
Kays ? once s? famous for the unrivalled ships
launched from their yards? have ccasei to put
n"w vessels on the stocks; and nothing abso
lutely is being done in that line except in the
way el building pnil repairing for the coastwise
trade. It would appear, therefore, that any
opposition from the shipbuilding interest to the
policy of free trade in ships would be a sort of
dog-in-! he-manger policy. Tho ships that now
command the commerce of tho ocean are of a
class tiiat have never been built ia this coun
try, and in which, even with all the materials
free of duty, our shipbuilders cannot compete
v ilh those oi England.
The era of wooden vessels ha? passed as
completely as that of sail vessels. The iron
screw propeller has taken their place. Tho
shipyards of Maine and New Brunswick may
still ilnd work in supplying coasting and fish
ing vessels ; but the vessels for long voyages
will be built elsewhere and of iron, not wood.
Our merchants have realized the fact and are
therefore convinced that their chance for re
gaining the foreign carrying trade which they
hare lost lies, not In the fostering of the ship
building interest at home, but in the procuring
abroad of the Bhips which they need.
The facts presented in tho report of the
select committee show the urgency for adopt
ing a policy that will be speedy and arailable
in its effects. - * ? .?,
In 1861 the value of American shipping en
gaged in foreign commere9 was estimated at
$108,000,000, and the gross^arnings therefrom
$36,000,000. In 1869 its value had fallen to
$70,000,000 and its earnings to $23,000,000.
In 1860 the American tonnage entering our
own ports from abroad was in excess of for
eign tonnage entering our ports by 3,567,374
tons. In 1863 that excess had fallen to
1,974,320 tons. But in 1869 tho relative po
sitions were reversed, and the excess was on
the side of the foreign tonnage by 1,945,026
tons. In 1860 tho value of Imports and ex
ports carried in American vessel* was double
that carried in for* If a vesvls?t 5^7, 666,660
to $255,000,000. Ia 18t>9 the positions were
reversed? ff>86, 000, 000 in foreign vessels to
$-89, 000,000 in American vesa.'is.
These facts and figures show the desperate
condition of our foreiga carrying trade, and
the necessity for prompt and efllcient reme
dies. We thereforo beg the representatives of
conflicting interests not to stand in the way of
a measure that will promise effectual relief.
Let not the United State3 government be tho
only enlightened government that refuses to let
its oiiizens buy its ships wherever they can be
bought the cheapest and boat. As the compe
tition for the commerce of the world is with
all other nations, let our citizens enter into it
on at least equal terms. Let us no longer by
our stupid legislation weigh them down and
impede them in the rac?. Let us removo ail
these antiquated restrictions on our commerce.
At the same time give the shipbuilders an
equally fair chaice by letting them have their
materials free of duty. And If still more is
necessary, let Congress grant liberal subsidies
to steamship lines. Ia this way American
commerce may bo revived and our former
prestige as a great maritime nation restored.
Tk? War Situation ii France.
Severe battled are still going on between tbe
Army of the Loire and the army of tbe Duke
of Mecklenburg. So far the victory lies, as
usua'l, with the Germans. Gambetta, it seema,
has not yet lost hope. The report that be had
asked for an armistice is denied. General
D'Henceourt has anrivod at Lille by balloon
from Paris, and gives favorablo accounts of
the situation inside the city. He is charged
with the duty of organizing the French forces
in the North. The bombardment of Paris
is said to have been positively decided upon,
and will probably commence on the 19th Inst.
The long range guns on the heights about
Paris will be able to send shot into the heart
of the capital. The churchy of Notre Dame
will serve as a target, and about its neighbor- ;
hood are clustered the palaces of the Louvre '
and the Tuileries, tho Mint, the Palace of I
Justice and some of the finest bridges in tbe I
city. Being near the centre, on the Isle do !
Cite, the miBfciles that can reach it can be |
even mora readily hurled iuto the magnificeat
edifices that stand nearer the outskirts. The
Luxembourg Palace, the maguificent churches
of St. Sulpice, St. Clothiide, and the Madeleine,
tho Hotel deB Invalides, the Legislative Hall,
the Arch of Triumph, can all receive their
share of tho bon-bons which the festive Ger
maa proposes to shower upon the gorgeous
city all through the holidays.
Havre is preparing for a close siege. Tbe
forces that recently captured Rouen are
advancing rapidly to invest the city, which,
however, is well fortified and will be defended
by about, fifty thousand troops. Reports come
from Bordeaux that troops from the extrdme
south of Franco are being hurried forward
rapidly to the front, and another report says
that the Army of the Loirw has already been
reinforced by l'orty thousand men.
Pruviia t? ?nter Luxembourg*
A special cable telegram, which reached ug
last n'ght from London, states tliat tho Prus
sian army has been ordered to enter and oc
cupy the territory of Luxembourg. The move
ment is to be undertaken, it is said, as "a mili
tary necessity," to prevent the supply of ma
terial and support to a portion of the French
troops from or through tho duchy. We are
told that the order to occupy was re
ceived direct from Berlin. A "military
necessity'' is a very convenient excuse for
great military nations. England made the
fact of the robbery of a hatchet and a goat tbe
excuse for a "military necessity," which
brought on the Kaflir war, and ended ii the
conquest of the Cape Colony, tho securing of
the Cape roate to India and the monopoly of
the diamond fields of Africa. A "military
necessity" is a first rate contingency at times.
It may prove so to Prussia in Luxembourg.
The New Capital of France*
There is probably nothing so disconcerting to
the French people at this time as the evidence
of a peripatetic disposition on the part of tke
government of France. That it should flee with
all its historic archives and its bright records,
and with the high flash of a debutante of power
still on its hopeful brow, id bad enough;
but that it should go from Tours, which is,
comparatively speakiag, in the front, to Bor
deaux, two hundred and fifteen miles away to
the rear, is enough to fill every Frenchman in
Francc with disgust and every Frenchman in
Germany with laughter. Outside of the ridi
cule attached to the movement Bordeaux is
one of the most appropriate to was in tke
nation for the reception of the fugitive gov
ernment. It is one of tho most flourishing
cities of Europe in commerce and the cultiva
tion of the arts and sciences, has an immense
manufacturing business, larie commercial
interests, aad lies in the very heart of the
Medoc wine region, whence comes the famous
Chateau Margaux. It in situated on the
Garonne river, sixty miles from where it
debouches into tho Bay of Biscay, and there
fore lies accessible to the protection of the
heaviest French men-of-war. It3 bridges,
quays and shipyards are famous all the world
over.
Bordeaux is an ancient city ? tha Bordigala
of the Romans ? and has a history full of
gallant and patriotic memories. It has been
in its eventful time under the dominion of the
Romans, the Goths, the Saracens, the Nor
man? and the English. It has been taken
and sacked in turn by each of these, and in the
time of Louis XIV. it was closely besieged by
Cardinal Mazarln for harboring the beautiful
wife of the Great Cond<5. That lady, fleeing
from her persecutor, begged thi protection
of the citizens of Bordeaux, and they re
sponded so heartily to the calls of helpless
beauty that Mazarin wan foiled in his attack
upon the city and was compelled to raise the
siege after a few weeks. Helpless beanty, in
the form of the Tours government of France,
again throws itself upon the protection of
Bordeaux, though not with the grace of tho
lady of Condi(, and doubtless the gallant city
will respond with her ancient grace and
courtesy.
Very Citbious ? ' That tho most conspicuous
men now in the sorvice of tho French provi
sional -government should be the three Juloses,
of the Directory, and two Italians, Gambetta
and Garibaldi. "How have tha mighty
fallen!"
TNtiWhr^n* Arlliftn Pro
perty. the Praakla# FrlrlleCi tk? FUh
ftriea and tkt Land Graata.
The audience in the Senate galleries yester
day bad the treat of listening to a rather ex
citing debate on an interesting subject. Sena
tor McCreery, of Kentucky, was the author of
a bill, which he desired to introduce, looking
to the restoration of Arlington Heights, for
merly the property of General Robert E. Lee,
and now the eternal camping ground of thou
sands of dead soldiers of the Union, to Mrs.
Lee. The most objectionable part of the pro
position was the disinterment and removal of
those who lie buried in that national cemetery.
If no such insuperable obstacle to the restora
tion of the property had existed, perhaps there
would have been a feeling in Congress and
among the people in favor of letting Mrs. Lee
resume the patrimony of her fathers ; but,
under the circumstances, the idea was one not
to be entertained, and so the Senate took the
very unusual course of refusing to allow the
bill to be introduced. Thoro were but four
rotos for giving permission.
The House has again taken definite action
iu the way of abrogating the franking privi
lege. Last session it passed, with only thir
teen negative votes, a bill for that purpose,
but the Senate managed to give it the go-by
| and to avoid direct action upon it ; for even
that body was not preparud to run so counter
to public opinion as to reject the bill. But
the question has come up again in a bill to
revise and consolidate all the laws relating, to
the 1*0:4 Office. Last week the House struck
out of this general measure everything on the
subject of franking, which was a virtual abo
lition of that privilege ; but yesterday a direct
and positive proviso for its abolition, to take
effect on the 1st of July next, was incorpo
rated by a vote of oue hundred and three
to sixty-five, the only exception being
in the few cases where the privi
lege was specially conferred by act
of Congress, as upon Mrs. Polk and Mrs. Lin
coln. The exchange of newspapers and peri
odicals reciprocally between publishers is
still to have the freedom of the mails, as also
weekly, semi-weekly and monthly newspapers
to actual subscribers in the county where such
papers are published. We doubt the policy of
even these exceptions. The thing ought to
have been blotted out at once aid forever.
The prospect does not look very promising
for the public land monopolists. The first
land grant bill that came before the House
this session was yesterday postponed, against
the votes of its supporters, and a large num
ber of similar bills that were on the Speaker's
table Bince last session were allowed to remain
there, not even having the slight advantage
of being referred toeomruittees.
General Butler appears to be marshalling
his clans against the Canadian enemies and
rivals of his cod fishery constituents, lie
yesterday presented in the llouse a petition
of the Gloucester fishermen, asking Conjjresa
to adopt various retaliatory mea sures to
punish the Canadians for interfering with
American fishermen. Portentous as this war
cloud may appear, we hope it will pass over
without serious consequence. We doubt
whether, in the present tendency of public
opinion in Canada towards annexation to the
United States, any hostile legislation or action
on our part, even ia tbe cause of the Gloucester
fishermen, would bo a proof either of good
statesmanship or kind, neighborly feeling. If
our fishermen have serious cause for com
plaint against Canadian officials it may bo
remedied -by the usual diplomatic means of
remonstrance .and negotiation, without bluster
or aBsumiug a belligerent attitude.
Crucltin on Shipboard.
The trial of Captain Grindle, master of the
ship Old Colony, for brutal treatment of two
of his crcw. reveals the details of a Ravage
system which is known to prevail in our mer
chant marine. The evidence of the poor
sailors, both Cubans, tells a horrible story of
torture inflicted upon them by the monster
who commanded this vessel. As he is on his
trial we will say nothing which might prejudipe
the case. A fact suggests itaelf, however.
These defendants were entrapped on board an
American ship supposing her to be a Spanish
vessel. They signed no papers. They prayed
to bo put ashore at Valencia, where they
shipped, and again at Cadiz, where the
vessel t'juched. If we had an efficient navy
abroad these outrages might ba prevented ;
but our navy is not properly represented in
foreign ports. While Congress is indulging
in the petty, jealous pastime of abolishing tho
rank of admiral and vice admiral, through
hostility to an effioer who it saems ha3 given
offence by some former action of his in con
nection with the staff and lino officers, it
would bo better employed in increasing the
force of our navy and putting the navy which we
have into a better state of repair and dis
cipline. We may expect soon to sao the rank
of rear admiral and commodore and vice
commodore and so on abolished, until we
shall have a demoralized navy, with all sailors
and no officers, if petty party jealousies are to
become predominant in Congress. There is
imminent need juat how of a largo and efficient
American navy. It is especially necessary
that our flag should hold a conspicuous plaoe
in Enrope and should ba backed by the force
to command that respeot which, wo are sorry to
say, it does not receive in tho full degree to
which it iB entitled. Here is something upon
which Congress could be moro patriotically
engaged than in abolishing the high ranks of
officers in tho ecrvice mereiy to satisfy heme
party piques.
Coosey, tho murderer of O'Dty, w&s con
victed of manslaughter in the third degree
yesterday, and was sentenced to the State
Prison for two years. We think the sentence
is somewhat too severe. Judge Bedford truly
said that no assault will justify killing, unless
it is clearly manifest that the assault is made
with intent to kill or do bodily harm; but
certainly tho circumstances under which
Cooney sctod fully covered these premises. A
full acqu'ttal was Coenoy's due ; or if he be
amenable to Stata Prison at all, it is evidently
not because he killed O'Day, but because of
the bad company in which ho was found on
that fat U Sabbath morning when the famous
desperado last wont out for a "lark."
Wasted? A little more dignity among some

mt the War la Vrtaot.
We pabliih this morn lax ? mip of the scene
of operations in France, giving all the points
of importance. At present public attention
is mainly directed to Havre and the Loire.
Of Havre we give a sketch, Including
its geographical situation, its history
And its fortifications, as also brief
descriptions of the villages of Harfleur
and Montivilliers. At this latter place
a battle betweon the French forces, commanded
by General Briand,and the advancing Germans.
A view of the situations of Dieppe and Amiens,
Ronen and Paris, Orleaas and Bourges, Tours
and Blois, and, in fact, of every place rendered
memorable by the present war, can also be
taken. By studying the map the posi
tions of the contending armies will
be ascertained, aid those persons who are of
strategic turn of mind may, if they so desire,
speculate upon the probable future movements
of Prince Frederick Charles or General Bour
baki, tho Duke of Mecklenburg or General
Chauzy, Troehu or General Von Moltko.
Had not the isolation of Paris and the move
ments of the Germans in that part of France
some weeks ago partially suspended com
mercial communication between Havre and
the United States, the almost certain
investment of the city and its possible
capture would be regarded with far
more anxiety by Americans than will now
be the case. But, even as it is, there must
be a great deal of property belonging to
Americans in the city, the fate of which will
doubtless excite much anxioty on the part of
the owners. Fortunately for our shipping
interests at last accounts but few or none of
our ships were in port, so that even if the
place be bombarded our interests will not
suffer in that direction.
IntrlgucM for th* Rentorntion of the Bona
parte*.
It is now undeniable that the restoration of
the Bonapartes t? the throne of France id one
of the possibilities of the situation.' It is hard
to think that Prussia or United Germany will
attempt to force a ruler upon the French
people. On the other hand, it is impossibly
to refuse to admit that France is now at the
mercy of Germany ; that Prussia ? fer the pre
sent dominates Germany and that Bismarck is
the master of Prussia ? the place of King Wil
liam, of course, always being recognized.
Fall Faris when it may, before Christmas or
after Christmas, tho Germans mean to remain
in France until France has settled down under
some recognized form of* government. The
example of 1815 will be imitated ; but on this
occasion the forces will not represent allies,
but Germany only.
What is the chance for Napoleon? There
?re many who think hu has no chance at all.
Others, again, are of, opinion that bis chances
are groat. He is King William's prisoner. He
is treated to-day as a royal guest. He has
not abdicated. The Itegency has retired from
France; but the Regency, with the Empress at
its head, is the only accrodited government of
tho French people. The Senate, too, bat waits
to act. The dt.cheanca has been pronounced
in the Corps Lc'gislatif ; but the dtchzance
amounts to nothing. There is only one govern
ment which the conquering Germans can
recognize in concluding a treaty of
peace, and that is the government
of Napoleon. Of course King William
could give France her ehoioe; but will he?
Tho allies restored the Bourbons in 1814 and
1815; and tho presumption to-day is that
King William, acting magnanimously by a
royal captive, will restore the Emperor Napo
leon, or at least compel France to submit to
the Regency. It is all very well to say that
France will not have it so. But France in
1814 and in 1815 had to submit ; and France
is more exhausted to-day and more helpless
than she was in those years. The Germans
wish to get home, and we may rest assured
they will adopt the easiest and simplest way
to complete their work. Having no evidence
that the French people out of the great cities
are against the Emperor, and having much evi
dence to the contrary, we cannot say that tho
restoration of Napoleon is not the first among
the possibilities of the hour. If France is not
pleased with the government which Prussia
leaves behind it, Franco must make tho best
and the worst of it. So soon as a treaty of
peace is signed by the Regency Napoloon may
be allowed to roturn to France with all his
best marshals and at the head of an army of
at least three hundred thousand men. At one
timawo saw a chance for the House of Orleans.
The prospect for that house is no longer
bright. In London, to-day, it is the Empress
Eugenie, net the Count d3 Paris, who is the
object of royal attention. The republic has
failed. So far as we can see the empire must
be re-eatablishod. Pity it should bo so; but
facta are facts.

We know that many of tbe jobs and s pec
ulations under the gov?:ruincnt are enveloped
in mystery, but the public will bo astonished
to learn that one of the biggest things of tbe
kind is the job known as the stationery and
envelope job, by which the postal department
is made to lose nearly ono hundred and thirty
five thousand dollar* per auuim. This sori
of tbiug is protested against by a number of
the envelope manufacturers, ptationers, book
sellers and printers of th* United States, who
complain against government competition in
tbeir lino of business. It is reported that our
well-knowa fellow cUi3?n, Boss Tweed, is inte
rested in this matter ; but bow, or where, or
why, or in what manner, doe3 not appear on
the surface. Perhaps the Now York Printing
Company haa something to fto frith it. Be
that as it may, is there anything under the
Sun, or over the Sun, or arouad tho Sun, in the
way of jobbery, that same people have not an
interest in it, some way or other ? Why don't
our Board of Aldermea take a hand in this
envelope and stationery business ? Now that
they ure in the gift book printing lino they
might as well add other branches of the
trade with profit to nil concerned.

capital with hi3 constituents and the renubir
can party at large, he rushes forward a iol.i
resolution to abolish these offices, In hopes o
its passage before the confirmation of Porter
can be effected in the Senate. Personally ha
does not want the Vice Admiral promoted:
politically he wishes him out of the way^
hence his only method of accomplishing bis
ends and serving the enemies of Porter is i0
doing what be has done, under the name ol
retrenchment. We hope he will not be suc
cessful.
Without discussing fully the merits or de
Viol a f, tbe re?enlly P,lbli3hed letters ol
Vice Admiral Porter, we can only say that,
our opinion, the abolition of the biZ.
grade, of the naval .ervice would be a move
as imp olitio as it is uncalled for. Doing awuy
with them on the plea of economy J9 but 8tuJ
and nonsense; it is a mere quibble^
cover the true reason that would no" ^
being made public. We should have in our
naval service grades the same as in the navie,
of England, France and Russia. We hava
them now, and they should be retained. It i?
not for our government to take a step back
wards in this respect. As a great naval
Power we are second to none. Then why do
away with the two highest grades of 'our
nava service that are as necessary now a.
they have been at any time ?
It is now sought to Influonce Confess
against Porter by one of the mast dastardly
acts that man can be guilty of? viz., tha pub
lication, of a letter that was never intended for
other eyes than those of the jmrty to whom it
was addressed. Raking it out from where il
had laid undisturbed for yuars was a mean
piece of business; but the act of publishing it to
the world was contemptible in the extreme, and
instead of injuring tbe Vice Admiral, it should
ftamp as utterly dishonorable men those who
have been guilty of such underhand means to
accomplish their own revengeful purposes
Th.s is the view taken of it by the President ol
the Lnited States, as is shown by his promptly
sending Porter's nomination for Admiral to
the Senate for confirmation. And wo hope ha
be PromPtly confirmed, if for no other
reason than to show that an officer cannot ba
disgraced by means so utterly devoid of
honor and honesty.
Mentally, morally, physically and profes
sional y Vice Admiral D. D. Porter is as weU
tor promotion as any officer in the ser
vice. A gallant officer, an accomplished gen
tleman, devoted to his country and to the ser
vice to which he is attached, his record stand,
almost unblemished. That he has faults must
bo acknowledged? and who has not ?? but the*
are not of a character to detract from the rep.
utation he has gained by distinguished ser
vices before tbe enemy. His controversy 01
collision with tbe staff officers of the navy
was a mistake, not but that he was right in
point of discipline and desire for the well
being of tho naval service, but it was a mis
take of policy. Many of these staff officers
who are now his opponents are tho creation
of political influence, who owe their ri-ht to
wear a uniform to the relationship or friend
ship of some members of Congress, and through
congress they aro trying to be revenged upon
the Vice Admiral of the navy. This fact he
should have considered, but the probabilities
are that he never entertained an Idea that
member, of tho honorable sarvica of which ha
la a member would ever desoend to
such dishonorabla mean, to carry out
a dishonorable purpose. If General Sherman
was fitted to fill the vacancy in the army occa
sioned by the resignation of Grant, then Vica
Admiral Porter is fitted to fill the vacancy
in the navy occasioned by the death of Farra
gut, and such we hope will be the opinion of
Congress when Mr. Logan's repolution ig
brought forward, and of the Senate when, in
executive sessiou, bis nomination is presented
for confirmation. *

Oru>im) Broken on the St. Uomliuti Annexn
tlou Uaterpiiie.
The proceedings in Cou?res3 ea Monday
last on the joint resolution of Gaaeral Banks,
authorizing the President to appoint five
persons to inqiire into the expediency of
negotiating a treaty with the authorities
ef St. Domingo lor the acquisition of tho
territory of that republic, as recommended
in tho President's Message, are encouraging.
On the test motion of Mr. Cox, of New York,
to lay tho resolution on tho table, the 'vote
stood 117 to 67, which prokvbly indicates the
present division of the House on shii question
of annexation. The final action of the House,
in referring the resolution back to the Com
mittee ou Foreign Affairs, with leave to report
at auy time after live days' notfoe, indicates
the disposition of the House to bo decidedly in
favor of the measure. We prosumei that
General Banks, in reporting bis resolution
back to tho House, will bo prepared with an
argument upon tho subject which will im
mensely strengthen the. solid argument of
the President touching tho incalculable riches
of the Island of St. D.uningo under tho juris
diction of tho United States, and its valuo to
us as a commercial centre aud naval station.
In a word, wo look upon the annexation
scheme as fi jpaMiwa which must succeed,
whether considered as a bargaf* fa tropical
real estate or as a great stroke of sound
public policy.
