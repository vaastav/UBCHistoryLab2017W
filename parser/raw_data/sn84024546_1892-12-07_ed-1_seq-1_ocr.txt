Is the Beading of the Presi

Houses of Congress.

Favor That Are Very Telling: New
Propositions as to the Time of Con

trBOM A STATF COBRBSPOKDEjrr.l
Washington, Dec. 6. It goes without
saying that the reading of the President's
annual message, the last one Mr. Harrison
will write, was the1 event of the day in Con
gress, but it was more an event on account
of the time consumed in its delivery by
reading clerks whose voices soon became
husky than from any other cause.
Such reading of such messages never
pains the attention of more than a few, and
of that feu-only in certain passages. It is
therefore one of those performances that
might well be given to the cemetery of ob
solete formalities. .
In the old day, when printing presses did
not vie with the lightning in speed, and
when newspapers were not in the hand of
every man, containing the message in full,
beiore its reading was finished by the clerks,
this formal delivery was well enough, and
doubtless had the attention of every mem
ber of those old Congresses. Now it is an
empty formality, a creature of precedent, a
hollow show of respect to the chief execu
tive. How the Message Is Read Nowadays.
This was never more conspicuous than to
day, for hardly had Chief Clerks Kerr, of
the House, and McCook, of the Senate.com
menced to intone the message from 'printed
copies, the manuscripts lying on the desks
before them, when other printed copies
were in the hands of correspondents and
members and officials and employes of every
grade, and they simply ignored the reading,
lolling in chairs in smoking and committee
rooms, turning to such portions of the paper
as they thought would interest or amuse
vb'm, shipping the rest and chaffing and
arguing upon those parts.
This may seem inconsequential, bnt to
anyone who views the scene of the reading
at close range it appears so ridiculous the
wonder is that it can be persisted in.
Of course the message is treated wholly
from a partisan point of view by members.
That is always the case with State papers
in which there is a strong infusion of poll
tics. Democrats variously term it peevish,
ill-natured, utterly commonplace and one
poetiially entitled it: "The Song of the
Dying Swan."
How the Republicans View It.
Republicans term it a message strong in
that it shows the accomplishments of an
immense number of important things, aside
from the McKinley bill; that this has
been an administration busy with large
questions with which, it wrestled with
marked success.
The Kepublicans are much delighted with
the serious manner in which the President
points ont to the Democrats, "the logic ot
the situation," with phrases which may be
ironical, or dryly humorous, or sugeestive.
a certain profound solemnity and concern
with which he looks upon the future of the
country. As this tariff passage mightily
pleases the Bepublicans,naturally it makes
the Democrats wince, and thev show a real
aggravation at the pointed, simply severe,
and admirably simple manner in which he
analyses, in a brief page or two, the whole
basis of dispute.
Probably the passage which is considered
most pointed is that which refers to the
part played by the wage workers, who, in
their struggles with so-called protected em
ployers, had their judgment "obscured by
the passion evoked by these contests," and
then this severe and significant sentence:
"He (the wage worker) may now be able to
review the question in the light of his
personal experience under the operation of
tariff for revenue only."
Extremely Calling to Democrats.
This pasiape in reference to the wage
worker appears to gall the Democrats more
than any other. It is their sensitive point,
because it is, as they privately admit, their
great lear. If the average wage of the
working people of the country should,
within the next four years, sensibly de
crease, on account ot the Democratic tariff
legislation or from anr other reason, the
party leaders well know they will be swept
from power by a force which, to the force
which has just placed them in power,
would be as a cyclone to a zephyr.
One portion of the message which seems
to meet strong commendation on all sides is
that which severely criticises the action of
Canada in the endeavor to Improve trade
relations between the United States and
that country, quoting the immense benefit
derived Iroro the United States by Canadian
railways, and concludes by urging the con
struction of a ship canal around Niagara on
the American side and of other ship canals
connecting the Great Lakes with seaports
of the United States.
Good Seed bown by The Dispatch.
Thus the great project which might be
said to have been developed by The Dis
patch, and upon which it has dwelt
eloquently for years, with articles which
have attracted the attention of the whole
country, has at last actually excited the at
tention of a President of the United States,
and he gives it forth with all the vigor and
Counting of a new discovery. His argu
ments are not the less telling, however, if
they come a" little late. Yet upon
"the Hill," in the pigeonholes of the
Committee on Railways and Canals, lie
half a dozen important ship canal bills, in
cluding one from Lake Erie to the Ohio at
Beaver and one around Niagara .Falls on
the American side, thence through Lake
Ontario and across the country to Trov on
the Hudson. No attempt has been made to
even consider these bills, much less to-re-port
them, though no more eloquent pre
sentation of any cause has been made be
fore a committee of Congress than that be
fore the Committees on Elvers and Harbors
and on Railways and Canals early last ses
sion by representatives of the deep-water
convention which had been held at Detroit
some months before.
Most Popular Part of the Message.
Possibly the Democratic party, resur
rected, clothed with the divine right of
governing by the voice of "the people,"
may be induced to take up this protest of
all commercial reforms. As I have said,
this passage of the President's message was
applauded on all sides, and it may possibly
bear better fruit than any utterance of He
Harrison duringjiistennre. "
While there is little doubt that some bill
changing the meeting of Congress from the
first of December to the first Tuesday of
March will be reported, and that it will
cause, one of the liveliest debates of the
session, there is little probability that it
will become a law. It the House pass it, it
will probably be lost among the musty tomes
of precedent of the Senate. Though the Sen
ate has had ai infusion of new blood,princi
pally from the West, it yet has sufficient
of the old fogy element antique men who
do not want the dear old customs changed
while they live to stop any great innova
tion such as this would be. The only argu
ment that might lead to the other view
would be that of compelling an immediate
meeting of the Fifty-third Congress.
A Show ot Hands Demanded.
There is much anxiety on the part of the
Republicans to force the hand ot the Dem
ocrats at once, and prevent them from
sneaking or hedging by delay and subter
fuge. This is the only hope such a change
would have at the hands of such esteemed
old gentlemen ot another generation as
Hoar, Dawes, Morrill, and even younger
Republicans than they in the Senate. Such a
bill would go to the Committee on Judiciary
of the Senate, of which Mr. Hoar is Chair
man, and among whose members are such
sticklers for precedent as Wilson, of Iowa;
Piatt, of Connecticut; Pogn, ot Alabama:
Coke, of Texas; Vest, of Missouri, and
George, of Mississippi, all great analysts of
the Constitution and hair-splitters of the
law.
It would seem that any such complete
demolition of a solemn enactment ot the
fathers would have a hard row to hoe with
this committee, notwithstanding the pres
ence on it of iconoclasts like Teller, of Colo
rado, and Mitchell, of Oregon.
One of the propositions in ronnection
with the change which goes farther than
others is that of McMillin, of Tennessee,
who would not permit a Congress to meet
after a deleat of the administration. That
is, in the present instance, supposing the
regular session of the new Congress began
in March. Mr. McMillin would not permit
the, closing session of this Congress, which
does not represent the will of the people.
A Case Where It Wouldn't Work.
This would be all very well when a clean
sweep is made, but it might happen that a
President and Vice President would be
chosen from one party and both Houses of
Congress have a majority from another. Or
the Senate and President might be of one
faith and Congress show a majority ot an
other faith. When the matter comes to be
analyzed (all the movements in that direc
tion have as yet been merely impulsive and
not intelligent) many things may turn up
in regard to the "wisdom of the fathers
which even such old youngsters as Hoar,
Morrill and Dawes do not suspect.
There will be some plain talking before
Mr. Smith, of Arizona, and Senor" Joseph,
of New Mexico, are "transformed from Ter
ritorial delegates into Senators of the
United States. Arizona, at the election, ot
1890, cast, all told, about 11,000 votes, and
New Mexico about 32,500. To give four
Senators to this population, and four Sena
tors who would possibly cast the deciding
Tote on the most important legislation,
seems to many men of all parties with
whom I have conversed on the subject as
carrying the sublime Senatorial feature of
Republican Government to a point beyond
the ridiculous to the absolutely vicious.
Complexion of tho Next House.
An unofficial list of members-elect of the
Fifty-third Congress was issued to-day by
the clerk of the House, and it figures out
217 Democrats, 128 Republicans and 8
People's party men, with the election in
Rhode Island unsettled because ijO candi
date has a clear majority. One district in
Michigan is still in doubt. The whole
number is 356. Omitting the districts not
decided, the Democrats will have a ma
jority over all of 8L This will, of course,
be increased by Third party votes on most
important questions, as nearly all of the
eight Third party men were elected with
the assistance af Democratic votes.
The most remarkable feature of the list
is, perhaps, that in all the South, where the
Ailiance and People's party were to play
so great a part, not a single independent
can be found. The Third party octetlets
are Davis, Baker and Simpson, of Kansas,
all members of the present House. Bocn, a
new man elected in the Seventh Minnesota;
McKeighan and ICein, of Nebraska, both in
this House; Francis Newlands, of Nevada,
who was ejected wholly on account of his
advocacy of free silver, and Lafe Pence, of
Denver, are real People's party men.
Miller's Name Sent to the Senate.
Among a large batch of recess appoint
ments which reached the Clerk's room at
the Senate to-day the name of George W.
Miller appeared The list was not pre
sented in the usual way to the Senate, by
messenger, but was deposited informally at
the Clerk's office. If an executive session
be held to-morrowMr. Millerwill doubtless
be confirmed.
QUAY LOOKING TROUBLED.
Rival Candidates Are Making His Ufa a
Real Harden.
Washington, Dec. 6L Special
Senator Quay wore a troubled look
to-day. He was between two fires,
each of which threatened destruction
to his re-election to the Senate. A
Philadelphia delegation was here to in
duce him to support a Philadelphiau for
Speaker of the Pennsylvania Legislature,
which meets next month. A country dele
gation was also here to get him to support
the country candidate for Speaker, Each
delegation promised to reciprocate his sup
port by favoring his re-election, and each
threatened trouble if his assistance was re
fused. The Senator is trying to keep out of the
Speakership fight, but from the large dele
gations here to-day it is probable he will be
dragged into it, and that his chances of re
turning to the Senate may be considerably
lessened by it. Dave Martin, who is said
to be in charge of the Quay forces in the
Pennsylvania Legislature, also had a long
conference with his chief to-day, and it is
probable pave receivedjnstructioos how to
manage the coming fight
WHAT WHITNEY WANTS.
He Would Rather Be a Senator Than Again
Be in the Cabinet,
Washington; Dec. & Special. Gen
eral Tracey, of Albany, and Representative
John W. Mitchell, of Wisconsin, both of
whom have been very prominently, men
tioned as probable members of Mr. Cleve
land's new Cabinet, deny that there is any
foundation for the rumors that have con
nected their names with department port
folios. General 2. racer said with regard to
Mr- Whitner that he had it on the author
ity of Colonel Dan Latuont that the ex-Secretary
of the Nary was not to be considered
in the list of Cabinet possibilities.
"Mr. Whitney does not want anything
from the incoming administration," said
General Tracey. "If the State of New
York should choose to select him as one of
its Senators I think possibly that Mr. Whit
ney would like to have that position. He
would certainly be a very capable man for
such place."
SPRINGER IS ANXIOUS.
He Wants .Tariff Legislation Proceeded
With at Once His Plan for Changes In
the Electoral Toto to Be Considered
Other Reforms He Is Advocating.
Washington, Deo. 6. ferial Mr.
Springer, Chairman of the Committee on
Ways and Means, is very anxious to pro
ceed at once with tariff legislation, so as to
carry into completion -the general plan in
augurated at the last session. His plan is
not apt to meet with approval of the full
committee, however. That policy was
never Intended to apply to any but the sit
uation then existing with the Democrats in
control of but one House. With both
Houses of Congress and the Executive a
little way ahead, a proposition to proceed
as before-cannot meet with favor.
There is one other thing which Mr.
Springer has in mind which he hopes to
succeed with, and into which he is going to
put his best energy. At the last session he
introduced a resolution for a constitutional
amendment providing for the abolition of
the Electoral College and for a chance in
the time of the meeting ot Congress. Thls
he proposes to press to the front at once.
Mr. Springer's scheme is to give each
State as many electoral votes as it has mem
bers and Senators, as now, but to divide the
electors of each State between the candi
dates in proportion to the size of the popu
lar vote received by each, the population
being divided- into units. Congress, he
proposes, shall expire in December follow
ing the general election, and the new Con
gress shall convene in January following
the election. The term of the President he
wants to extend to six years, and have more
than one term prohibited. The terms of
Congressmen he wants extended to three
years.
During last session Mr. Springer did not
get much consideration for this proposi
tion, but he believes that the present time
is opportune, and that be can press it upon
the attention of the public and Congress so
as to secure favorable consideration. The
committee to which the resolution was re
ferred will hold a meeting on Friday, and
it is said that It will take the matter up.
Mr. Springer points ont ' the fact that
there is a dispute over onexof the electors
in Oregon, one in Ohio, one in Kansas, and
some tangle about the electors of Cali
fornia, and says that with such a condition
ol affairs, the country might easily be
thrown into revolution if the result of the
election were close enough to make it de
pend on these votes. His plan, he con
tends, would avoid the posslbilitv of any
such condition of affairs, and would render
corruption very difficult.
CAMERON STANDS PAT
On His Preference for Mahone's Site for the
Printing Office.
Washington, Dee. 6. Special An
other effort is to be made during the present
session of Congress to select a new
site for the Government Printing
ing Office in this city. The old fight which
commenced more than two years ago has
been renewed within the past few days, and
some spirited lobbying is now 'going on.
Two Tears ago Congress appropriated $250,
000 for the purchase of a site and 17
pieces of property were at once offered
to the Government. The members of the
Senatorial poker club promptly blocked the
pathway of all sites except that owned by
Mahone of "Virginia, ,and their lobbying
became to bold that Senator Manderaon,
Chairman of the Senate Committee, de
nounced their methods in open Senate.
The result was that a halt was called last
session and the committee was instructed
to make a tborough investigation of the
subject during the recess. Several meet
ings of the committee were held dur
ing the past summer and fall, and yester
day the committee rejected 13 of the sites.
The Mahone site is one of the luckyfour,
and is still backed by the Senatorial poker
club.
Senator Don Cameron is tbe gniding
spirit in the Mahone site movement, and he
is working like a beaver to secure a favora
ble recommendation. He has a good argu
ment in the iact that the poker club site is
the b'est one of the lot. There is considera
ble speculation as to the outcome of the
fight, and some interesting developments
are expected before a result is reached.
The unsafe condition of the present print
ing office renders prompt action a necessity,
hence those who are interested in the
humanitarian side of the case will try to
force a decision during the present session.
It will not do to permit the 5250,000 to re
main longer tied up in the Treasury.
Davenport Coolly Snubbed.
Washington, Dec. a At a meeting of
the House committee investigating the ad
ministration of the Federal election law in
New York City it was decided to take no
notice whatever of the petition submitted
to the House yesterday in behalf of John
Z. Davenport, in which the latter asks for a
hearing at the bar of the House.
CALLERS ON CLEVELAND.
Two Philadelphia Capitalists the Only Ones
Who Saw the President-Elect Yesterday
They Wouldn't Admit That They
Went to Say a Word for Harrity.
Lakewood, N. J., Dec. 6. Special
president-elect Cleveland's first day at
Lakewood was passed in a very quiet man
ner. He retired about 11 o'clock last night
and was up about 8 o'clock this morning..
After eating a hearty breakfast and looking
over a pile of letters that came in the early
mail, which took him about an hour, he and
Mrs. Cleveland went out for a walk. They
strolled a short distance by Lake Carusaljo,
and then went to the village, where Mr.
Cleveland bonght a quantity of writing
paper and returned home, where he re
mained the rest of the day, writing letters.
' There were no callers until about 3 o'clock
in tbe afternoon, when George H. Earle,
Jr., President of the Pennsylvania Ware
bousing Company, and Richard Y. Cook,
President of the Philadelphia Guarantee
Trust Company, of Philadelphia, were re
ceived bv the President-elect in a private
room which Mr. Freeman has placed at his
disposal They were closeted with him lor
about an hour, after which they left and
went to the Lakewood Hotel for lunch.
Mr. Earle and Mr. Cook came over
together in a special train from Philadel
phia, which they chartered at 11:45, and
which left Camden half an hour later, ar
riving here at 2 o'clock. Mr. Earle, when
asked the nature of his visit to the President-elect,
said: "Oh, it -was just a call on
personal matters, and had nothing whatever
to do with'politics." Mr. Cook corrobor
ated this statement.

New Yobk, Dec. 6. Affairs are so shap
ing themselves, it was admitted to-day, that
Mr. Cleveland may find it necessary to In
sist, so far as he can, upon William O.
Whitney accepting a portfolio in the Cabi
net Indeed, several very close friends of
Mr. Whitney believe that Mr. Cleveland
has determined to request him to be Secre
tary of State.
All the Democrats hereabouts are per
fectly aware how Mr. Whitney feels about
such matters. He does not believe in say
ing anything for publication until a port
folio has actually been onered "to him.
Many Democrats wonld like to see New
York State get the Treasury portfolio, bat
that place is tbe one which is to bother Mr.
Cleveland most.
Throughout Mr. Cleveland's administra
tion from 1884 to 1888 the Empire State had
two representatives in the Cabinet, Daniel
Manning, Secretary of the Treasury, suc
ceeded by Charles S. Eairchild, and Mr.
Whitney, Secretary of the Navy. This
was rather unusual, according to Western
critics.
The West Demands Two Men.
Now that the West has come out so bril
liantly as a factor in electing the Demo
cratic President, many Democrats from that
section believe that Mr. Cleveland si ould.
select a Western man for Secretary of the
Treasury, as well as Isaao Pusey Gray for
PostmasterGeneral. They point out also that
there are nnancial distinctions between the
East and the West which promise to become
still more pronounced. The Postmaster
General and the Secretary of the Treasury,
between them, practically control the bulk
of the federal patronage at the command
ot tbe administration. This fact is an im
portant one with the -Western hustlers.
It is admitted by Mr. Cleveland's frlerfds
that he could very well aflord this time
to give the West one more Cabinet
officer than it had under his first adminis
tration. This additional Cabinet offioer
would naturally be one of the two given to
New York State in Mr, Cleveland's pre
vious administration.
These Western Democrats are referring to
the interviews with Editor Scott, of the
Chicago Strata, a month" .belo're ele$pibn
day. Mf." Scott infthose- interview de
clared that-Mr. Cleveland would be elected
outside oT New York State, 'and that the
West wonld do it Mr. Scott as a political
prophet stands upon a pinnacle
Mr. Cleveland is now in possession of
documents representing the wishes of
Southern and Western Democrats concern
ing his makeup of the Cabinet' He has
glanced over a number of these papers and
he will give them further consideration.
After the holidav season he will de
vote most ot his time to pondering
them. Those in his confidence say
that the selection -of the Cabinet will be
more bothersome than in 1884, for tbe rea
son that he cannot now draw upon the
United States Senate. In the makeup of
.his first Cabinet he called for the services
of Senators Bayard, Lamar and Garlaud.
The Republicans had a substantial majority
in the Senate, and the services of these
gentlemen as Senators were easily spared.
Can't Spare Any Senators.
It is different now. Mr. Cleveland can
not request the seryices of any Democratic
United States Senator as a Cabinet officer,
for the reason that it would impair the
Democratic majority in that body. Indeed,
it is likely to require all the keenness at the
command of Senator Gorman and all the
counsel of Senator Carlisle to keep the
upper body in line with the majority in the
Housexf Representatives.
Speaking of aflairs in the United States
Senate from a Democratic standpoint, those
just from Washington to-night had some
thing to say about the antics of the anti
snappers here in New York State. It
was admitted that the august Demo
cratic Senators were acquainted to
some extent with ex-Mavor William
R. Grace and ex-Secretary Charles Fair-
child. The following of these two gentle
men the United States Senators describe as
"whipper-snappers." Their favorite in
quiry is, "Who are these creatures over in
New York State?"
These Senators, it was remarked, were all
eleoted by the Legislatures of their States,
and nowhere in the United States except in
the Empire State are there any Mug
wumps. In other words, these Senators
were elected by what the "whipper
snappers" call "machine methods." They
cannot understand the tea kettle methods
ot (he Mugwumps of New York State in op
posing the selection of a candidate for the
United States Senate by the regular organi
zation of tbe State.
Most of the Senators are aware that the
Mugwumps have not a single vote at Albany
this winter. One of these Democrats just
from Washington said: ".From what I know
of the temper of the Democratic Senators I
would advise the Mugwumps of New York
State to accept the suggestions nude them
some time ago to join the regular organiza
tion, no matter whether it is in New York,
Brooklyn, or in any ot the inland cities or
towns of the State.
They Don't Recognize Mugwumps.
"The Democratic Senators have a great re
gard for the Democratie party, and they
know nothing of Mugwumps. Such Sena
tors as Mr. Daniel.Mr. Gorman, Mr. Carlisle,
Mr. Harris, Mr. Morgan, Mr. Ransom, Mr.
Blackburn, Mr. Vance, and others equally
well known, are aware of only tne regular
organization in the different States, the or
ganizations which nominate and elect the
majorities in Legislatures.
"Most of the Senators named hare been
abused by Mngtrump newspapers in New
York State, but they care nothing for that;
their whole idea is to aid in the progress of
the Democratic party. It is the opinion In
Washington that these Mugwumps are
doing everything possible to embarrass Mr.
Cleveland. The Democratic Senators are
perfectly aware that Mr. Cleveland can no
more Interfere in the selection of a United
States Senator In New York State than he
could in Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Alabama, North Carolina or any
other State with a Democratic majority in
the Legislature."

Philadelphia, Dec. a The Pnbllo
Ledger building was badly gutted this
evening by fire and w.ater, The damage by
fire was confined almost entirely to the
composing room on the top floor, but a tor
rent of water poured down through the
building, flooding every floor in the struc
ture. Tbe loss is about $100,000 on build
ing and 50,000 on contents.
The Ledger building is 88. feet front on
Chestnut street and 235 feet deep on Sixth
street, and is a five-story brownstone build
ing with a mansard roof. The firo origi
nated in the basement Through a hoistway
the fire leaped directly to the top floor.
The compositors, who had previously' been
warned, easily escaped.
The files of the paper were all saved,, and
the many Tare and costly ihiogtin.M&.
Childs' private office wire all carried ont
Mr. Childs posted himself in the doorway
of the Court House across the street and
'calmly watched his building go up in
flames. When invited to enter a neighbor
ing office, he declined and said he liked to
watch the fire. By 7:30 tbe fire was under
control, and all danger of the total destruc
tion of the building bad passed. The
annex on Sansom street escaped entirely.
Mr. Childs intends to disrtibute $5,000
among the firemen fpr their prevention of
the total destruction ot his building. Ke
provided them all with a bountiful supper
at a neighboring restaurant
A number ot lawyers', brokers' and real
estate offices were drenched with water.
Extensive alterations had recently been
made in the building. While the fire was
still burning fiercely the work of getting
out to-morrow's paper was going on. The
city department was removed to the Board
of Trade room in the Drexel building. Ex
cept presses, the Ledger has a complete
newspaper plant on Locust street, and there
the compositors are setting type for to-morrow's
paper. The Mecord office will do the
press work in the morning. ,
THE SILVERSMITHS COMBINE.
An Agreement Reached to Keep TJp the
Grade or Silver.
New Yobk, Dec 6. Special A. num
ber ot leading silversmiths of this country,
according to announcement made to-day,
have entered into an agreement with each
.other to protect themselves by1 maintaining
prices for silverware, and also to protect the
general public by making only sterling
silver goods. The combination will be
something similar to the Goldsmiths' Guild
of London. It will both protect and give
protection. The Gorham Manufacturing
Company, the Whiting Manufacturing
Company, the Timble Manufacturing Com
pany, Dominick & Hoff and the George W.
Shiebler Manufacturing Company are the
concerns that have been Instrumental in
forming the organization. These firms are
jealous of any encroachments on their
privileges.
A leading member of tbe trade said to
day: "We expect to begin the new year by
doing business in strict accordance with
the rules of the Silversmiths' Guild of
America. The object of all concerned is not
to form a trust The prices will not be ad
vanced in any way. The chief object of tbe
combination is to Improve' the quality of
silverware on the market The goods manu
factured by thtie firms have always been
starllnir silver: It was in ererv initinca

MRS. MAYBRICK DYING.
Gall Hamilton Receives Despondent Cable
grams From the Prisoner's Mother.
Boston, Dec. x Special Gail Hamil
ton has written tbe following letter con
cerning -the imprisonment of Mrs. May
brick in England. It is dated to-day.
I received this morning a telegram from
Woking, England, that "Mrs. ilaybrict is
dying; hemorrhage; faint h'opo." Later I re
ceived a second telegram from her mother,
the Baroness do Bagues: "She is danger
ously ill." This is what the mother has been
dieadlog with agony and anxiety. Tho only
son died of consumption when little older
than Mrs. Maybrlck. Her sufferings latterly
have been severe. Tbe mother has vainly
implored the Homo Offloo for permission to
send a physician down to her from London,
promising to take any one whom the Homo'
Office shonld select Being assured that
they would permit so much she made all tbe
arrangements, even to paying the physician
fee, but at the last moment tbe Home Office
refused the boon. I Interpret the telegrams
that tho mother's love and perhaps tbe
mother's knowledge of her child's constitu
tlon give hermore hope of recovery than"
the prison authorities offer, and that if by
any means the sad sufferer came out Into
freedom and sunshine and to her mother's
caie she might rally and live. I send this
for the information of the many who are In
terested in this unhappy victim of the Brit

CHARLESTON HAS A PANIC.
Children of One of Its Schools Stampeded
by a Fa'so Cry of Earthquake
Charleston, S. C, Dec. 6. Special
The old earthquake city had an excitement
to-day, caused by a panio in one ot the
public schools. The incident occurred in
the main room of the Bennett, one of the
largest public school buildings in the city.
Shortly after the noon recess, while the
pupils were in the main room, one of them,
a little girl, was seized with convulsions.
There was a quick gathering around her of
the teachers. The other pupils became ex
cited. Some one shouted, "Earthquake !"
and then all discipline was at an end. The
panic spread through the building, and de
spite the efforts of the teaohers there was a
wild stampede for the exits. Children
were thrown down, trampled upon, and
books and slates and clothing torn and
scattered around in all directions.

I5TEIGUEB THAT WOULD BU1N THEJI
(SMCIII. rBLBOKAK IOTZr DISPATCH. 1
New Yobk, Dec. 6. Supt Byrnes
has broken the long silence he has hitherto
maintained with regard to the charges made
against the police department by the Rev.
Dr. Parkhurst. Generally when ques
tioned about the matter he has said:
"Dr. Parkhurst is a clergyman and
is responsible to God." To-nicht at
10 o'clock he called the reporters to his
office at police headquarters and hinted at
revelations which will prove more sensa
tional when they come than anything that
has yet been revealed in connection with
the Parkhurst scandals.
All the turmoil which Parkhurst has
stirred up over the social evil had its origin,
according to Superintendent Byrnes, in a
divorce suit that was brought by one of the
female members of his congregation. This
lady's mother interested Dr. Parkhurst in
the caset and in that way he learned much
of vice and shame, and began his attacks on
disorderly houses.
Details to Be Given Out.
"TJp to this time," said Superintendent
Byrnes, "I have kept silent in tbe face of
the charges brought by Bev Dr. Parkhurst
against the officials ot this department I
had intended to give out a detailed state
ment, giving letters, interviews and facts,
but find that I cannot get it prepared in full
to-night The foil statement X shall have
ready within a few days.
"I will saynowthat the statements of Dr.
Parkhurst haye been made without evi
dence to support them. I don't believe
that he belieyes these statements himself.
The whole trouble sprang from a divorce
suit that was brought nine or ten. months
ago by a member of his congregation. An
elort was mode then by a certain
member of Dr. Parkhnrst's congregation
to get a police officer to swear to certain
statements against tbe husband, pr. Parkhurst-become
interested in the case. The
woman got her divorce, and then followed a
series of persecutions against a certain
house said to exist, and that was the com
mencement of the attacks and unfounded
charges made by Dr. Parkhurst upon this
department'
Letters That Are Compromising.
"I have letters in my possession," con
tinued tbe superintendent, speaking slowly
ancLas though measuring the effect of every
word, "showing that Parkhurst and a cer
tain member of his congregation have re
sorted to everything that would seem to be
dishonorable to get evidence through
the intrigues ot women to compromise
the chief magistrate of this city, to
compromise some of the Judges of the
higher courts, to compromise tbe prosecut
ing officer of this county and many other
officials under the municipal government
These letters. will show the instructions he
left behind as to what should be done dur
ing his stay in Europe. They will also
show all that occurred up to a few days
ago. These letters were written by a per
son interested in the divorce suit
"I have mentioned a person who is a
close friend of Parkhurst's, and who has
been of assistance to him in getting ma
terial to assail public men and to preach
about immorality in the pulpit. I have had
these letters copied. Every one of them
was written to a party interested in com
promising public men, and the letters show
that this was being done through a
woman."
Xots More of It to Come Tet
The superintendent said that was all for
the present. More would follow within a
day or two. . When asked to be more ex
plicit, he said the letters he referred
to had been written by the mother
of the woman who had brought suit for
divorce. There vere more than 20
of them. Evidently the woman had no
idea of the magnitude of the trouble she
was stirring up, as one of the letters said:
"To think that all this controversy had its
origin in our divorce suit!"
'To show the character of Parkhurst,"
said Superintendent Byrnes, "I will relate
an incident When it was about time for
him to go on the witness stand and testify
to what he had seen be asked this woman,
the mother of the applicant for
divorce, to see if she could- not
get him some French pictures behind
which to testify. He was good deal an
noyed about what he would have to say,
and he thought that the French pictures
would explain the situation better than he
could, and come to the assistance of his
modesty.
One Way to Get Around the Truth.
"The woman said she would get pictures,)
and did so. She brought them to Park
hurst, and he, thinking that some inquisi
tive giver might ask him where be had
got them, and thereby compel him to
make the woman's name public, said to
her: 'You take them away and get
a friend of yours whose handwriting I don't
know to send them to me iu a sealeJ pack
age, and then I can conscientiously say I
don't know where they came from.' "
Superintendent Byrnes would not say
what bouse it was that figured in the di
vorce suit, but declared it was not Hattie
Adams'.

Washington, Dee. a President Har
rison's last annual message was transmitted
to Congress to-day. It Is largely devoted
to a review of the condition of the country
at.what is practically the close of the ad
ministration. The late election is the sub
ject of frequent reference, and the belief is
expressed that the nolicy of protection will
ultimately be inllyNindicated, The full
text of the document follows:
To the Senate and House of Beprescntatrres:
In submitting my annual message to Con
gress, I have great satisfaction in being
able to say that the general conditions af
fecting the commercial and Industrial in
terests of the United States are in the high
est degree favorable. A comparison of the
existing conditions with those of the most
favored period in the history of the country
wUl, I believe, show that so high a degree
of prosperity and so general a diffusion of
the comforts of life were never before en
joyed by our people.
The total wealth of the country in I860
was $10,159,616,068. In 1890 it "amounted
to 562,610,000,000, an increase vt 237 per
cent
The total mileage of railways in the
United States in 1860 was 30,626; in 1890 it
was 167,741, an increase of 448 per cent,
and it is estimated that there will be about
4,000 miles of track added by 'the close of
the year 1892.
The Growth of Ten Tears.
The official returns of the eleventh census
and those of the tenth census for 75 leading
cities furnish tbe tfasis for the following
comparisons:
In 1880 the capital invested in manufac
turing was 51,232,839,670.
In 1890 the capital invested in manufac
turing was $2,900,735,884
In 1880 the number of employes was 1,301,
38a In 1890 the number of employes was
2,251,134.
In 1880 the wages earned were $501,965,
771 In 189a the wages earned were $1,221,170,
454. jc.
In 1880 the value of the product was $2,
711,579,899. In 1890 the value of the product was $4,
860,286,837. I am informed by the Superintenuent of
the Census that the omission of certain in
dustries in 1880, which were included in
1890, accounts in part for the remarkable
increase thus shown. But, after making
full allowances for differences ot method
and deducting the returns for all industries
not included in the census of 1880. there
remain in the reports from these 75 cities an
increase in the capital employed of $1,522,
745,604; in the value of the product of 52,
024,236,166; in wages earned of $677,943,
929, and in the number ot wage earners em
ployed of 856,02a
Increase In Aggregate and Average.
The wage earnings not only show an in
creased aggregate, but an increase per
capita from 538G in 1880 to $547 in 1890, or
41.71 per cent The new industrial plants
established since October 6, 1890, and up to
October 22, 1892, as partially reported in
the American Economist, number 345, and
the extension of existing plants, 108; the
new capital invested amounts to $40,449,050,
and the number of additional employes to
37,285.
The Textile World for July, 1892, states
that during the first six months of the
present calendar year 135 new factories
were built, ot which 40 are cotton mills, 43
knittiug mills, 26 woolen mills, 15 silk
mills, 4 plush mills and 2 linen mills. Of
the 40 cotton mills 21 have been built in
the Southern States. Mr. A. B. Shepper
son, of the New York Cotton Exchange,
estimates the number of working spindles
in the United States on September 1,
1892, at 15,200,000, an increase of 660,000
over the year 1891. The consumption of
cotton by American mills in 1891 was 2,396,-
000 bales, and in 1892, 2,584,000 bales, an
increase of 188,000 bales. From the year
1869 to 1892 inclusive there has been an
increase in the consumption of cotton in
Europe of 93 per cent, while during the
same period the increased consumption in
the United States has been about 150 per
cent
Tho Tin Plate Industry.
The report of Ira Ayer, special agent of
the Treasury Department, shows that at
the date of September 30, 1892, there were
32 companies manufacturing tin and terne
plate in the United States, and 14 compa
nies building new works for such manu
facture. The estimated investment in
buildings and plants at the close of the fiscal
year, June 30, 1893, if existing conditions
were to be continued, was $5,000,000, and
the estimated rate of production, 200,000,
000 pounds per annum. The actual pro
duction for the quarter ending September
30, 1892, was 10,952,725 pounds.
The report of Labor Commissioner Pack,
of New York, shows that during the year
1891, in about 6,000 manufacturing estab
lishments in that State embraced in the
special inquiry made by him, and repre
senting 67 different industries, there was a
a net increase oyer the year 1890 of $31,
315,130 68 in the, value of the product and
of $6,337,925 09 in the amount of wages
paid. The report of the Commissioner of
Labor for the State of Massachusetts shows
that 3,745 industries in that State paid
$129,416,248 in wages during the year 1891,
against $126,030,030 in 1890, an increase o
$3,335,945, and that there was an increase
of $9,942,490 in the amount of capital, and
of 7,316 in the number of persons em
ployed in the same period.
Iron and Steel Production.
Tlnrlnpthe last six months of the Tear
1891 and the first six month's of 1892, the
total production of pig iron was 9,710,819

tons, as against 9,209,703 tons in the year
1890, which was the largest annual produc
tion ever attained. For the same 12 months
of 1891-92, the production of Bessemer iu
gots was 3,878,581 tons, an ''ncrease of 189,
710 gross tons over the previous yearly
production of 3,688,871 gross tons in 1890.
The production of Bessemer steel rails
for the first six months of 1892 was 772,436
gross tons, as against 702,080 gross tons
during the last six months of the year 1891.
The total value of our foreign trade (ex
ports and mannfactures) during the lost
fiscal year was 51,857,680,610 an increa se o
$128,283,604 over the previous fiscal year.
The average annual value of our im
ports and exports of merchandise for the
ten fiscal years prior to 1891 was $1,457,322...
019. It will be observed that our foreign
trade for 1892 exceeded this annual average
value by $400,353,591, an increase of 27.47
per cent The significance and value of
this increase are shown by the fact that the
excess in the trade of 1892 over 1891 was
wholly in the value of exports, for there
was a decrease In the value of imports of
517,513,754.
Highest In Our History.
The value cf our exports during the fiscal
year, 1892, reached the highest figure in the
history of the Government, amounting to
$1,030,278,148, exceeding by 5145,797,333
the exports of 1891 and exceeding. the value
of the imports by $202,875,086. A compar
ison of the ilue of our exports tor 1893
with the annual average for the tea years
prior to 1891 shows an excess of $265,142,
C51, or of 34.65 percent The value of our
imports of merchandise for 1892, which was
5829,402,462, also exceeded tbe annual aver
age value of tbe ten vears prior to 1891 by
$135,215,940. During the fiscal year 1893
the value of imports free of duty amounted
to $457,999,658, the largest aggregate in the
history of our commerce. The value of the
imports of merchandise entered Iree of
duty in 1892 was 55.35 per cent of the total
value of imports as compared with 43.35
per cent in 1891 and 33.66 per cent in 1890.
In our coastwise trade a most encourag
ing development is in progress, there
bavins been in the last four vears an in
crease of 16 per cent In internal commence
the statistics show that no such period of '
f prosperity has ever before existed. The
ireignt carnea in rne coastwise iraae or
the great lakes In 1890 aggregated 28,295,
959 tons;
On the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio
rivers and tributaries in the same year the
traffic aggregated 29,405,046 tons, and the
total vessel tonnage passing through 'tha
Detroit river during that year was 21,684,
000 tons. The vessel tonnage entered and
cleared in the foreign trade of London
during 1890 amounted to 13,480,767 tons,
and of Liverpool 10,941,800 tons, a total for
these two great shipping ports of 24,422,563
tons, only slightly in excess of the vessel
tonnage passing tnrougn tne uetroit riven
Size of the Domestic Commerce. v
And it should be said that the season far
the Detroit river was but 228 days, while
of course in London and Liverpool the sea
son was tor the entire year. The vessel
tonnage passing through the St Mary's
Canal for tbe fiscal year 1892 amounted to
9,828,874 tons and the freight tonnage of
the Detroit river is estimated for that year
at 25,000.000 tons against 23,209,619 tons in
1891. The aggregate traffic on our railroads
for the year 1691 amounted to 704,393,609
tons of freight, compared with 691,344,437
tons in 1890, an increase of 13,054,172 tons.
Another indication ot the general pros
perity of the country is found in the fact
that the number of depositors in savings
banks increased from 693,870 in 1860 to
4,258,893 in 1890, an increase of 513 per
cent, and the amount of deposits from $149,
277,504 in 1860 to $1,524,844 56 in 1890. aa
increase of 921 per cent In 1891 the
amount of deposits in savings banks was
$1,623,079,749. It is estimated that 90 per
cent of these deposits represent the savings
of wage earners. The bank clearances for
nine months ending September 30, 1891,
amounted to $41,049,390,80a Eor the same
months in 1892 they amounted to $45,189,
601,947, an excess lor the nine months of
$4,140,211,139.
BENEFITS OF PROTECTION.
The President Ascribes the Country's Pros
psrlty iarjely to tho Tariff References
to tho Eecent Election Hopes for the
Future.
There never has been a time in our his
tory when work was so abundant or when
wages were so high, whether measured by
the currency in which they are paid or by
their power to supply the necessaries and
comforts of life. It is true that the market
prices of cotton and wheat have been low.
It is one of the unfavorable incidents of ag
riculture that the farmer cannot produce
upon orders. He must sow and reap in
ignorance of the aggregate production ot
the year, and is peculiarly subject to the
depreciation which foUows overproduc
tion. But, while the fact I have stated is true,
as to the crops mentioned, the general aver
age of prices has been such as to give ag
riculture a fair participation in tbe general
prosperity. The value of our total farm
products bas increased from $l,363,646,8o6
in 1860 to 54,500,000,000 in 1891, as estimat
ed by statisticians, an increase of 230 per
cent The number of hogs January 1, 1891,
was 50,625.106, and their value $210,193,925;
on January 1, 1892, the number was 52,398,
019 and toe value $241,031,415. On Janu
ary 1, 1891, the number ot cattle was 33,
875,648 and the value $544,127,908; on Janu
ary 1, 1892, the number was 37,651,239 and
the value $570,749,155.
A Feature to Be Remembered.
If any are discontented with their state
here; if any believe that wages or prices,
the returns for honest toil, are inadequate
they should not fait to remember that there
is no other country in the world where the
conditions that seem to them bard would
not be accepted as highly prosperous. The
English agriculturist would be glad to ex
change the returns of his labor for those of
the American farmer, and the Manchester
workmen their wages for tnose of their fel
lows at Ball Wver. H
