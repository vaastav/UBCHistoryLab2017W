METCALF PLANS TO
RESUME LAW WORK
Former Secretary of Navy Will
Again Practice Profession
After Recovering Health
Optimistic Regarding Future of
Naval Stations on Pacific
Coast and in Hawaii
OAKLAND, Dec. 9. — Former Secre
tary of the Navy Victor H. Metcalf and
Mrs. Jletcalf arrived today from Wash
ington, D. C Jiaving stopped for a few
dais in Los Angeles to visit their son,
Victor N*. Mstcalf, who is ill at Mon
rovia. The former secretary has under
consideration an offer from the First
national bank of Oakland to become its
president, but he will make no decision
in the matter until he has returned
from vacation, possibly five months
from now.
"I a«i Tiome for good," said Metcalf.
'•As soon as Mrs. Metcalf is settled in
our former dwelling I will go to the
mountains fora prolonged rest. That
Is the most important personal busi
ness before me at present. It may
icean a vacation of five months or less,
but until I have recuperated I intend
to think of nothing. When that end is
accomplished I shall resume the prac
tice of law." 'V /-
\u25a0"It has been announced that the
presidencies of the First national bank
and of the First trust and savings
bank of Oakland have been offered to
you." was remarked.
"I will not consider those offers until
I have recovered my health. It was
solely because of my ill health that I
was compelled to relinquish the secre
taryship."
METCALF HETICE-VT
Metcalf was reticent -concerning na
tional affairs and those of the naval
department especially.
"What I have to say as a final word
in naval affairs," he explained, "is em
bodied in my report, which will be re
leased for publication Friday. I must
decline to anticipate that."
Concerning the Newport conference,
in which battleship construction was
discussed by naval men, Metcalf was
equally reticent. Being interrogated
as to the truth of a report that he had
opposed publicity of the plans devised
or approved and of the discussion "ut
the conference, he replied: >
"Those proceedings were made pub
lic at. my recommendation. Since then
the president has issued instructions
forbidding naval officers to give any
information relating to the conference,
1 prefer to abide by that admonition
and say nothing regarding the New
port conference.".
Further inquiry as to his opinions on
criticisms of the naval defense of tbe
United States, and of the expediency
of the. shifting of the battleship fleet,
elicited this:
DEFEXSE OF >*ATIOX
"The navy is designed for the de
fense of the nation, not any particular
part or any specified coast. It is ab
surd from a tactical viewpoint to argue
that there should be a few ships here
and a few there. The efficiency of the
navy. . depends - on action, practice,
cruises. One thing I can say, so far as
1 a minformed the battleship fleet will
not be divided. Of course. I can not
tell what future policies may be, but I
believe that statement will be borne out
by events."
"What do you think of the naval de
fense provided for the Pacific coast?" he
was asked.
"In the last two years there have
been 17 ships added to the Pacific coast
Ijeets. There are now in these waters
t!ie Milwaukee. St. Louis and Charles
ton, three protected cruisers; the Ten
nessee and Washington, two armored
cruisers, were added, as were the South
Dakota and the California, the last
built in the Union iron works. The last
named comprise a squadron of four 13,
600 ton cruisers. In addition to these
ships are the Maryland, Colorado, Penn
sylvania and West Virginia. On the
Pacinc coast are eight, of the most
powerful ships in the navy. Then there
are six torpedo destroyers, making 17
chips on the western coast.
SLBMARIXES FOR COAST*' A -.\
"Before I left Washington I had ac
cepted the recommendation of the'gen
eral board to have delivered on the Pa
cific coast six of the submarines con
tracted for. Possibly come of them
\u25a0will be built here. To care for them all
are two navy yards. Bremerton and
Mare island."
SThe charges that the approaches at
are island are so shoal that battle
chips can not dock at the island drew
this reply:
"Besides armored cruisers which have
been serft to Mare island for repairs,
one battleship already has docked' there.
The federal government long has rec
ognized that for efficiency and value In
repairs. Mare island is the second navy
yard of the department.
IMPROVE3IEXTS PLAXXED
"Some time ago the general I>oard ap
pointed en investigating committee, of
which Colonel Bldwell was chairman,
to make investigations. and surveys and
recommend improvements to the chan
nel. One report was adopted, and I
recommended -to congress that an ap
propriation be made to provide for Its
execution.
"The government Is providing a su
perb dock at Hawaii, which will take
the largest ships afloat, and if congress
•will provide for docks and maintenance
at Mare island we shall have adequate
facilities for this coast. For one dock
at Bremerton the contract has been let.
The dry dock at Mare Island will be
completed in three months, and any
ship that sails the seas will then be
able to dock at Mare island."

JEWISH SOCIETY
APPEALS FOR AID
Young Men's Hebrew Associa-
tion Seeks Financial Help to
# Prevent Disbandment
The Young, Men's Hebrew association
of San Francisco has issued an appeal
to the people of this city in an effort
to raise funds to prevent disbandon
ment of the well known institutifn.
For years this association has played
an important part in the lives of young
folk, and until recent financial troubles
cropped up enjoyed liberal patronage. -
The appeal is as follows: V \u25a0 . t~
To the San Francisco Public: !
Thf Young Men's Hebrew association of San
Francisco, composed of about 200 male members
with an affiliated female membership of 100.
has been doing an active work in this com
munity furnishing young men and women witlv
* clean, moral resort and among other things
with a good library, classrooms, gymnasium,
bowling alley, billiard room, etc.,' giTing the
membership exercise for the body and food for
the mind under reasonable and sane rules;
giTing courses of lectures and sustaining an
active literary - society and similar instructive
features. \u25a0 .- \u25a0
The class of actiTC membership which we
possess is naturally of .. the eVery day people
which can afford to pay but a rery small
amount toward • the support of the institution.
It has been our :- endeaTor • to be self support
ing, and. the benevolent and wealthier classes
of the community hare never been called upon
nor has any outside support been furnished.
Some three years ago Dr. C. D. Salfield; the
owner of the premises at 1870 Page -street,
which were then well worth $40,000, showed his
good will and phiUnthropby by selling the prop
erty to the Young Men's Hebrew association
for about half of i its value, and the association,
having no capital of its own, paid for the same
by borrowing J20.000 from the Humboldt savinitij
bank and $3,000 from the California safe . de
posit and trust company. . ; -
• We all know the financial conditions which
have existed during thelaot two yrars aud a
half, and despite -the: unlimited good the asso
ciation: has accomplished^ it has own compelled
to struggle along unassisted nnd hampered in
various wayg owing to the dull times and the
fire of April, 1006.
WAS RELIEF §TATIOX
Prior to the fire of April. 1906, tbe Institu
tion was self supporting. After the - fire the
buildings of the institution were used as a gen
eral relief station for about sir months, . and
hundreds of. people of the community, both Jew
and Gentile, there found shelter and. relief.
This depleted Its treasury and deprived the as
sociation of Its \u25a0. facilities, consequently more
than half the membership was thus lost. Further
financial embarrassment - was caused by., aii in
crease In tbe rate of fire insurance, being
raised from I>4 to 5% per' cent.
This being . a club • for the moral betterment
of the members, we certainly could not rent any
portion of our property for saloon or like'pur
poses, and other tenants were not obtainable,
and we were compelled to ; look to our mem
bership alone for support, which, as ; herein
stated, is insutfieient. «
The membership and board of directors have
voluntarily - taxed themselves and subscribed
additional sums toward its support, but the time
bag come at last when ; the mortgages must be
satisfied or this magnificent property, with Its
grand future possibilities for thn moral up
raising and upbuilding of the youug men and
women, must be sacrificed and tbe property * fall
Into the hands of the mortgagees. .
If we can arrange the sum of $15,000 within
the next 30 days we caus arrange for an exten
sion .of the debt and, savo the . property, and
under better present : conditions -change', the
method , of handling . the property \u25a0 by. -. renting
out portions iof the same jand creating a sink
ing fund which will in time extinguish 'the
balance- of i the indebtedness. \u25a0 We :have • Just^3o
days' time to- raise $15,000 or 'face -a fore
closure. '
TEACH LAXGUAGES
The plans of the association \u25a0: Include, schools
for: the teaching of English, French. \ German
and Spanish classes \u25a0 for ! foreign immigrants for
instruction in the English language ~ to '•'\u25a0 permit

OAKLAND, Dec- 9.— A . tong war

were . flred\ at . afleeing Sue Dong man,
and .two On ;.Ticks, glylng the names
of Ah Sing and' Chin Yick, -were' ar
restedv on suspicion of being the men
who sought to do murder. In spite of
a fusillade of. bullets, which raged from
Fifth and Webster streets to :Broad
way,- no one was hit. Patrolman Cur
ran made the arrests.
. The police received Jnformatlon this
afternoon that hostilities- were threat
ened. \u25a0'- It. was reported that Gee On,
the- president of the Sue Dongs, was
co r operating' with, the police to keep
peace, but it was feared his endeavors
would be of no, avail. •
If the warfare continues it Is; not
likely that the On Ylcks and Sue-Dongs
will battle alone. The See Yicks -arp
allied in ".peace'-, and strife with the
On :Yicks, and the Sue Dongs may ex-
P«ct"ald ; from the; Bing-Kongs because
of help given- during the BingKong
war some time ago with the Hop Sings.
In a battle the Hop Sings Invoked the
aid of the Hip Sings, but peaceable
Chinese .asserted .tonight that the two
Sing tongs -would not be involved. -.
\u0084' The: cause of tonight's outbreak was
a quarrel and fight between two On
Ticks : and - two . Sue Dongs over * a
gambling game for high stakes in a
Fifth street den. An On Yick was
injured by a SuevDong who wielded a
revolver as a cudgel, and the shooting
that followed was the retaliatory work
of the On Yicks. ,
The Mil feeling between the rival
tongs began a week ago, when the Sue
Dongs refused to sell Har Far, a slave
girl, to Ah Lee of the On Yicks for
11,000, demanding twice that sum. Gee
On, president of t the Sue Dongs, said
he had that breach healed by enforc
ing the sale at $1,000. This, however,
failed to allay the hostility. '
