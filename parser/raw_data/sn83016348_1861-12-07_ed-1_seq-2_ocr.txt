The “ Abolition’’ Bugaboo.
In every political campaign in Mary
land for as long as wo can recollect,
tho old “Abolition” bugaboo lias been
made to do service for the politicians ;
but thank God, bo has at length been
effectually flattened out. The scales
have fallen from the eyes of the people,
and they begin to see bow they have
been duped by wily and unscrupulous
knaves, and to realize the fact that
Maryland would to-day be a wealthier
and more loyal State if they hadn’t so
often been frightened out of their pro
priety by the insane bowl of “ .Aboli
tionism.” Our most prominent men
have heretofore been so fear/bl of having
the epithet of “ Abolß' oll ist ” applied
to them, that they have not dared to
carry out their honest convictions, but
have committed innumerable foolish
ami unjustifiable acts, that they' might
ho considered sound on the goose.—
For the greatest rogue unhung was
considered an angel iu comparison with
tho man said to bo tainted with Abol
itionism, no matter how honest or relia
ble ho might bo. Every body appeared
to bo sensitive on tho subject, and
endeavored in all possible ways to
escape the odium attached to those
accused of having Abolition proclivities.
But all that is now happily changed.
\V hen the Rebellion broke out the
demagogues and small-fry politicians,
who in other days had found the “ Abol
ition ” hue and cry of such advantage
to them, thought it would prove a big
thing iu the forwarding of their nefarious
schemes for destroying the .Union,—
All tho old appliances were immediately
brought into retfuisition. Hireling
editors filled their venal sheets with
billingsgate about those who supported
tho Government being “ Abolitionists,”
aud brawling orators repeated at cross
road gatherings the same senseless twad-
Tllo. But the game was played out.—
The plain people, who arc tolerable
logicians when they take time to reflect,
couldn't exactly sou how sustaining the
Government of their fathers made them
Abolitionists—and although the epithet
was a horrible one, so they had been
taught to believe—they finally concluded
to run all risks and stand by the Old
Flag. They did so, and achieved a
political victory more glorious and far
reaching in its results than any ever
before achieved in Maryland.
And now lot us calmly look at
this “ Abolition” scare-crow, and see
if the cause of our alarm heretofore has
not been utterly groundless. An Abol
itionist, then, if tho term moans any
thing, means one who is in favor of the
unconditional abolition of Slavery.—
Arc there any such in Maryland?—
Wo doubt it. Wo know there are thou
sands who arc opposed to tho extension
of Slavery over territory now free.—
But while opposing its extension they
consider Slavery whore it already exists,
a necessary evil, and are equally opposed
to its abolition. How arc wo to get rid
of tho slaves in Maryland ! is a question
that has crossed the brain of a majority
of the non-slaveholders of the State ;
but how many of them have arrived
at the conclusion that wo must do it
by the uncondilion aboliliou of slavery ?
Wo venture to affirm not one in a thou
sand. Every man in Maryland knows
that our free negroes arc an intolera
ble nuisance—that as a general thing
they are lazy, thriftless, and thieving,
and no one wishes to see tho number
increased. The much dreaded epithet
then is an unmeaning one so far as this
State is concerned. Heretofore it was
used to frighen fools; and we are sorry
to say caused many a Bull Bun panic
among men considorad wise. Now it is
used to scare into disloyalty those loyal
to the Government; but it lias lost its
potency, and is only mumbled and
mouthed by knaves and Traitors The
world docs move.

The President’s Message.
The Message was delivered to Congress
on Tuesday last. Tho document entire
would require near six columns of The Whi g
to contain it, and we are consequently com
pelled to abridge. The reader will find the
pith of the Message in the following synop
sis. J hose desiring to peruse the document
in full, as delivered in Congress, will easily
obtain a copy in any of the city daily or
weekly papers.
The message opens with a recognition of
existing 4 * political troubles,** but expresses
gratitude to Cod for the prosperous harvests
and general health.
In reference to the action of the seceded
States, the President anticipates tho possi
bility of an appeal for foreign aid, or of for
eign interposition ; and though admitting
the non-interference of European powers
hitherto, it is deemed expedient to suggest
the arming and fortifying of the Northern
ports and the lake °oasts to be prepared for
any contingency in the future.
Suggestion is also made for co operation
with Kentucky and certain districts of Ten
nessee and North Carolina against the
seceded States, aud the building of a railroad
in aid of the purpose.
Indemnity is recommended in the ruse of
the liritish ship Perthshire, for illegal deten
tion under the blockade.
The recognition of llayti and Liberia is
approved.
The revenue from nil sources for the fiscal
year ending June was $80,83r,‘J27,
and the expenditures for the same period
$84,578,834, which, with previous balance
in the treasury, left a balance of two aud a
quarter millions. The revenue for the first
quarter since, ending September 30, is $102,-
032,500, and the expenses $98.238,733. —
For the estimates for the three quarters
ensuing, and for 1803, Congress is referred
the renort of the Secretary of the Treasury.
It is alleged as a gratifying fact that these
expenses arc nut beyond the resources of a
loyal people. It is also added that the num
ber ul troops offered for the war is beyond
the requirement of Congress.
The the Secretary of
the Navy fur certain improvements in that
arm of the service arc urged upon congres
sional attention.
Vacancies existing on the bench of the
Supreme Court are referred to, and delay in
appointments ascribed to an unwillingness
to do injustice to the South ; at the same
time the President regards the Norih as
having a superior claim. Certain mollifica
tions in the system of the Supreme Court
are recommended.
The revision or codification of the acts of
Congress is advised.
A plan for the temporary operation of
courts in .ho territory reoceupied by the
authorities of the United States, in the
seceded States, is recommended, especially
for the summary restitution in the case of
repudiated debts. Authority to make final
judgements in the Court of Claims is presen
ted to the consideration of Congress.
i hc restoration of the old Virginia boun
daries of the District of Columbia is recom
mended.
The organization of an agricultural and
statistical bureau is dimmed advisable.
The attention of Congress is particularly
directed to such legislation as will authorize
the freedom of slaves coming within the
scope of the military action on the part of
the United States, and the acquisition ut
teritory for their colonization.
The. President slates that lie has preferred
the blockade of the Southern ports to the
closing of the same, as authorized by the
act of the last Congress.
Reference is made to the belief on the
part of the South that they would have the
sympathy of a large portion of* the people
north of Mason and Dixon's line. The
error is said to have exploded, while Dela
ware, Maryland, Missouri and Kentucky
are claimed to have vindicated their loyalty
to the Federal government.
in reference to the advance of the Union
cause in the Southern States, the President
says;
The insurgents confidently claimed a
strong support from north of Mason and
Dixon’s line, and the friends of the Union
were not free from apprehension on the
point. This, however, was settled definitely
and on the right side.
South of the line, noble little Delaware led
off right from the first. Maryland was made
to seem against the Union. Our soldiers
were assaulted, bridges wore burned, and
railroads torn up, within her limits, and we
wore many dnyp, at one time, without the
ability tu bring a single regiment over her
soil to the capital.
Now her bridges and railroads arc repaired
and open to the Government. She already
gives seven regiments to the cause of the
union, and none to the enemy ; and her
people at a regular election have sustained
the Union by a larger aggregate vote than
they ever before gave to any candidate or
any question.
An insurgent force of about fifteen hun
dred for months dominating the narrow
peninsular region of the counties of Accomac
and Northampton, and known us the Eastern
Shore of Virginia, together with some con
tiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down
their arms, and the people there have renew
ed their allegiance to aud accepted the pro
tection of the old flag. This leaves no
armed insurrectionists North of the Potomac
or East of the Chesapeake.
Also, we have obtained a footing at each
of the isolated points on the southern coast
of Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee Island, near
Savannah, and Ship Island; and we like
wise have some general accounts of popular
movements in behalf of the Union in North
Carolina and Tennessee. These things
demonstrate that the cause of the Union is
advancing steadily southward.
There is iii thi; Message a grateful tribute
to General Scott, anti a splendid reference
to General McClellan, “It is a fortunate
circumstance ” says the President, “ that
neither in council or country was there any
difference of opinion as to the proper person
to be selected” as General Scott's succes
sor. “The retiring Chief repeatedly expres
sed his judgment in favor of Gen. McClellan,
and in tiiis the nutL.i seemed to give an
unanimous concurrence.” The Message
concludes as follows:
Jt continues to develop that the insurrec
tion is largely, if not exclusively, a war upon
the first principles of popular government
the rights of the people. Conclusive evi
dence of this is timed in tho most grave and
maturely considered public documents, as
well as in the general tunc of the insurgents.
In those documents we find the abridge
ment of the existing right of suffrage, and
the denial to the people of all right to parti
cipate in the selection of public ollieers,
except tho legislative, boldly advocated,
with labored arguments, to prove that large
control of (he people in government is the
source of all political evil. Monarchy itself
is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge
from the power of the people.
Iu my present position, 1 could scarcely
he justified were I to omit raising a warning
voice against this approach of returning des
potism.
It is not needed nor fitting hero, that a
general argument should lie made in favor of
popular institutions, But there is one point,
with its connections, not so hackneyed as
most others, to which 1 ask a brief attention;
it is the effort to place capital on an equal
footing with, if not above, labor, in the
structure of the Government, it is assumed
that labor is available only in connection
with capital,—that nobody labors unless
somebody else, owning capital, somehow,
by the use of it, induces him to labor. This
assumed, it is next considered whether it is
best that capital shall hire laborers, and thus
induce them to work by their own consent,
or buy them, and drive them to it, without
their consent. Having proceeded so far, it
is naturally concluded that nil laborers are
either hired laborers or what wc call slaves;
and further, it is assumed that, whoever is
once a hired laborer is fixed in that condi
tion for life. Now, there is no such relation
between capital and labor assumed, uur is
there any suck thing r.B a freeman being
fixed for life in the condidion of a hired
laborer. Both these assumptions are false,
and all inferences from them are groundless.
Labor is prior to and independent of capital.
Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could
never have existed if labor hud not first
existed. Labor is the superior of capital,
and deserves much the higher consideration.
Capital has its rights, which are as worthy
of protection as any other rights. Nor is it
denied that there is, and probably always
will be, a relation between labor and capital,
producing mutual benefits. The error is in
assuming that the whole labor of the com
munity exists within that relation. A few
men own capital, and that few avoid labor
themselves, and with their capital hire, or
buy another few to labor for them. A large
majority belong to neither class, neither work
for others nor have others working tor them,
la most of the Southern States a majority of
the whole people of all colors are neither
slaves nor masters, while in the Northern a
large majority arc neither hirers nor hired.
Men with their families, wives, sons, and
daughters, work Ibi themselves on their farms,
in their bouses, and in their shops, taking the
whole product to themselves, and asking no
favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hired
laborers or slaves on the other. It is not
forgotten that a considerable number of per
sons mingle their own labor with their capital
that is, they labor with their own hands,
and also buy or hire others to labor fur them ;
but this is only a mixed and not a distinct
class. No principle stated is disturbed by
(he existence of this mixed class.
Again, as has already been said, there* i*
not of necessity any such thing as the free
hired laborer being fixed to that condition for
life. Many independent men, everywhere in
these States, a few years back in their lives,
were hired laborers* The prudent, penniless
beginner in fbe world labors for wages awhile,
saves a surplus with \vliicli to buy tools or
land for himself, then labors on his own
account another while, and at length hires
another new beginner to help him. This is
the just and generous and prosperous system
which opens the way to all, gives hope to all,
and consequently energy and progress and
improvement of condition to all. No men
living are more worthy to be trusted than those
who toil up from poverty; none less Inclined
to take or touch aught which they have not
honestly earned. Let them beware of surren
dering a political power which they already
possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely
he used to close the door of advancement
against such as tin y, and to fix new disabili
ties and burdens upon them till all of liberty
shall be lost.
From the first taking of our national census
to the last is seventy years, and we find our
population at the end of the period eight limes
as great as it was at the beginning. The
increase of those other things which men deem
desirable has been greater. We thus have
at one view what the popular principle applied
to government through the machinery of the
States and the Union has produced in a given
time, and also what, if firmly maintained, it
promises for the future. There are übeady
among us those who if the Union he preser
ved, will live to see it contain two hundred
and fifty millions. The struggle of tu-day is
not altogether fur to-day, it is lor a vast
future also.

Message of Governor Hicks.
From the Message of Governor Hicks we
make the following extracts:
Abnijt tin* tiinu at which Smith Carolina passed liar
ordiiiaiirv ol* SocessiMii, and diirin;-; Muvcrul months there
after, I was importnneil to rmu'nnu tin* Legislature.
The history of that Legislature is before the country.
Not only did it fail to do its duty, as representing a loyal
•State, hut it actually passed treasonable resolutions, and
attempted to take, unlawfully, into its hands both the
purse and the swrd, whereby it iHit;ht plunge us into
the vortex of Secession. It was deterred from Uoitifr
this latter only Ly the unmistakable threats of an
aroused and indignant people.
Restricted in the duration of Us sessions by nothing
hut the will ..f a majority ..f its members. It met again
and again; squandered the people's money, and made
Itself a nioelcery before the country. 'This continued
until the General Government had ample reason to
believe it was about to go through the faree of enacting
a Secession Ordinance; when the treason was sunimarilv
stopped by the dispcrsoii of the traitors.
Inasmuch as the Legislature in ordinary times Is pre
sumed to represent the people of a State, the treasonable
action of the late Senate and House of Delegates has
apparently placed .Maryland in an attitude of hostility
to the General Government, and her Union-loving people
in a false and unwarrantable position. J say apparently,
because the votes of the pe. ple on the 13th . f.Jnne, and
again on the nth of November, have declared in most
emphatic tonus what I have never doubted, that Mary
land has no sympathy with rebellion, and desires to do
her lull share in the duty of suppressing it.
Looking, therefore, to tin* evil done by your predeces
sors, and deeming it impossible to mistake the wishes of
the people, as expressed at the ballot-box, I have not
hesitated to convene your honorable bodies in special
session, in order that you may at once perforin the will
of the people, by taking such steps as will, in your wis
dom, seem most effective to vindicate the honor and
loyalty of our State.
The tax-payers in Maryland an* looking with great
Interest for ymir action in regard to the best method of
raising the money which is required to pay our propor
tion of the National tax levied by Congress to aid in
defraying the expense of the war, and also the other
sums which will he necessary to (‘liable this State to fel
low her own former patriotic example, and that of her
loyal sisters.
Our probation of the National tax amounts to the sum
of four hundred and thirty-six thousand, eight hundred
and twenty-three dollars and thirty-three cents; and
Congress has allowed fifteen per centum of this sum to
bo retained by us to defray the costs and charges of col
lecting the same.
it is impossible for mojto offer any estimate of amount
that will be necessary for the other purples I have
indicated. Rut I look upon the whole subject as one in
which dollars and cents should not bo regarded. The
rebellion is to be put down, no matter at what cost. Our
State must bear her share of the expense, and her people
have shown their desire to do so by casting an over
whelming majority of their votes in favor < f the main
tenance of the Union.
Yours, then, should be no niggard hand. In this ease
liberality will be economy; and the people look to you
thus to vindicate their devotion to the Government.
A direct tax, to raise the necessary amount, would, in
my opinion, fall heavily upon the people at this lime,
because of the partial prostration of the mercantile and
industrial pursuits. Of course, if the money can be pro
cured in no other way. direct taxation must be resorted
to. Blit as such a tax is always unacceptable, and
would be onerous, under all (he circumstances, I trust
you will be abb* to devise some method by which its
imposition at this lime may be avoided.
The Legislature being constitutionally empowered “to
contract debts, to any amount that may be necessary for
the defense of the State,** it seems to me that the best
method of raising the required sum would be to borrow,
on the bonds of the .State, an amount sufficient for our
pnr|MiM‘, after deducting therefrom a proper proportion
to be reserved as a sinking fund for their redumption.
By thus pledging the State’s credit, the people will lit*
relieved from paying at once the heavy debt which has
been fastened upon us by the insane conduct of the
Rebels. We shall also tin spared the mortification which
would certainly ensue in consequence of our inability to
collect the necessary amount by direct taxation in due
time to moot our obligations to the Government.
It is undoubtedly a strict duty, and also duo to tiie
pride and honor of the State, that you make immediate
provision for raising and equipping Maryland's quota of
the five hundred thousand volunteers called for by the
President under the act of Congress authorizing him so
to do. I bolieAO that quota cun be raised without diffi
culty so soon as you shall advance the means to pay the
expense of recruiting and equipping the troops.
A thorough revision of the militia biwand re-organiza
tion of the State military is an imperative necessity at
this time.
I respectfully suggest the propriety of the re-onact
mont of former laws for the summary punishment of
persons iu Maryland who shall be convicted of aiding or
allotting, in any manner, those who are in arms against
the Government.
It is undeniable that, notwithstanding the careful
watch kept by the Federal officers, there are, in our
midst, sympathizers with and abettors of the rebellion*,
who, in some way, keep r>|> communication with and give
aid and comfort to the Confederates.
Let ns endeavor to put an end to these nefarious prac
tices by inflicting severe punishment upon these offend

Such a course will also measurably relieve loyal citizens,
in many parts of the Statu, from the nninerons annoy
ances and persecutions to which they have been sub
jected at tire haisls of their Secession neighbors, and
which have undoubtedly Increased to their present
embarrass!ug proportion becuuuv of tlu impunity wiUi
which men have heretofore been allowed to act treason
ably.
The object and intention of the Government in the war
forced upon it in defense of the Union, as declared in the
(Kitrictic proclamation of General Dix. at n**taring the
llag in tin-counties on the KasD-rn Shore of Virginia,and
oi General Sherman. In South Unroilna, arc entitled t
and will receive the siip|rirt of our people.
In conclusion, gentlemen, I congratulate* yu, and the
people of the Slate. ui*on Hie immunity we have enjoyed
from the dreadful evils which have fallen n;*on some of
the other States. While carnage and ((••salat imi have
stalked through \ irginia. Kentucky and Missouri, we
here in Maryland have had no bill tle-lbdd*, no wanton
dustni' fioii of homes, no outrages upon helpless women
•i nd ehibhen.
Turn, in every section of the State rancor mid deadly
hailed, and iii sonic cases even judicial persecution, have
been openly indulged against those whose only offense is
loyalty to the Government. Rut this hatred, bitterness
and persecution have not yet culminated in bloodshed.—
The tread of hostile armies has not interfered with the
calling of the husbandman, hut the earth has yielded
m re bountifully than ever before.
It is with you to efface whatever disloyalty Iris appear
ed iijioii our Legislative records. Jt is also with y~u tu
prove that Maryland is not only loyal, but patriotic.
Whatever aid we can afford the Federal Government
should be offered liberally, promptly, ungrudgingly.—
The perpetuity of the Government isat stake. Maryland
wishes to do her whole duty, and her loyal sons have
placed her honor in your keeping. I know you will not
betray that trust.
Meeting of Congress*
On Monday last both Houses of Congress assembled,—
Nothing "f importance was done in either House beyond
the organization. A joint resolution was offered in the*
House by Mr. L >vejoy. and passed, tendering the thanks
of Congress to Captain Wilkes for the capture of Mason
and Slidell. Mr. Col Pi x, of Indiana, also offered a reso
lution requesting (be President to place* in similar con
finement Messrs. Mason and Slidell, to that of Colonel
Corcoran, who lias been confined in a convict's cell by
the Rebels, and keep them thus confined until Col. C.
shall be treated as the United States lias treated all
prisoners taken by them in battle. The resolution was
unanimously adopted.
On Tuesday little business, save the reading of the
Message, was transacted.
On Wednesday. Mr. Saulsbiiry.of Del., In the Senate,
submitted a resolution proposing the appointment of
Commissioners to confer with like Commissioners from
the Seceded States “for the preservation of the Union/'
The resolution was laid over. Mr. Chandler offered a
resolution declared that JohnC. Breckinridge is expelled
from the Senate. The resolution was adopted unani
mously. several Senators not voting. Mr. Kennedy, of
Maryland. Voted for the expulsion. The subject of the
confinement of free persons of color and fugitive slaves
in the District jail was brought upon a resolution by Mr.
M I Ison, and tin* matter finally disjsised of by ordering
the Marshal to report the names of such persons, causes
of arrest. Ac.
In the House, resolutions and bills relating to various
subjects were introduced and generally refwirud. A
II nines toad Rill reported from the Committee on Agri
culture was referred to the Committee on Public Lands.
A resolution requesting the President to institute a sys
tem for the exchange of prisoners was referred to the
.Military Committee.
Maryland Legislature.
Tlic Legislature assembled at Annapolis
on Tuesday last. There was a full attendance
of members in both Houses, but beyond the
swearing in of uiembuis no business was
done.
On Wednesday both branches of the Legis
lature promptly organized at noon. Henry
11. Goldsborungb, of Talbot, was elected Pre
sident of the Senate, and J. Snmmerfleld
Berry, Esq., ol Baltimore county, elected
Speaker of the House. Both gentlemen, on
taking their seats, delivered addresses suited
to the occasion, and strong in the assertion
of the loyally Maryland. In the Senate Mr.
Smith, ol Carroll, submitted an order declar
ing the seat ol Coleman Yellott, Senator from
Baltimore, vacant, and directing Hie President
to inform Hie Governor of said vacancy. The
other proceedings were merely those connec
ted with Hie organization. The Message of
Governor Hicks was received and read in
both Houses, the principal parts of which we
lay before the readers of The Whig.
The proceedings in the Maryland Senate on
Thursday were merely preliminary to the con
sideration of the business of Ibu session.—
The President announced the Standing Com
mittees. Leave was granted to the Judiciary
Committee to repeal the acts ot the last
Legislature in relation to tile militia laws.—
In the House of Delegates the subject of Mr.
Cameron’s proposition lor the division and
partition of the States of Delaware, Maryland
and Virginia was incidentally discussed.—
There was a general opposition manifested to
the proposition, many of tliu members con
tending that an earnest protest should be
entered against it. Mr. Croswell, of Cecil,
said that Hie light in which the scheme was
viewed in this county, was that of a pleasant
j"ke. Mr. Creswell may discover Hint the
“ joke,” in this county is not all a “joke.”

LOCAL AFFAIRS.
Court Proceedings,—The adjourned
term of tire Circuit Court met on WcdiicsLi}
for tlie trial of some civil cases, in which
Judge Trice is (Unqualified from acting. The
Hon. A hxarulir Evans was selected us Special
Judge, and the case of Hannah A. Constable
nr. The Fire Insurance Company ol Cecil
county was taken up. This is an action to
recover the amount of insurance on a Irani
and contents belonging to MrS. Constable,
which was destroyed by fire* At the time oj
going to press it was still on trial. Messrs.
Scott and Archer for Plaintiff; Messrs*
Chambers, Groonie and Ellis for defence.—
The balance of the Jury not emp mnolod in
this case were discharged till next Tuesday.
Court adjourned on Friday to meet again on
Tuesday next.
Sad Accident.—Caleb C. Cantwell
was thrown from the cars on Tuesday night
last near the Philadelphia depot. He was
in the uct of braking when the chain gave
way and threw him on the side of his face,
clear of the curs and track; hut the fall
was so violet as to cause his death about 0
o'clock on the next evening. The deceased
was a citizen of Klkton. and a son of Mr.
John Cantwell. He has been for several
years employed as brakesman on the I*. W.
A H. Railroad. Formerly he was employed
as compositor in the ottieu of The Cecil H7iig,
and earned for himself the reputation of a
good workman, and an amiable companion.
The remains of the deceased were brought
to Klklon on Thursday, and his funeral took
place on Friday.
A Mammoth Ox. —Mr. William. W.
Moore, near Vinegar Hill, has one of the
largest steers that was ever fed in this
county, weighing at the present time 3,000
pounds. The animal is a mountain of flesh.
This steer is white, and very m at, differing
from most large cattle in this hitter particu
lar. Cattle above the medium size are apt
to he, what butchers term, rough, and
coarse.
Mr. Moore has hud this monster of the
beef family fur two years. When first pur
chased his weight was 1,080 pounds, having
gained upward of 1,300 pounds under the
judicious feeding of his present owner.
'flic animal is o feet 0 inches in highth :
0 feet in length, measured along the hack,
from the top of the head to the root of the
tail ; 0 feet in girth round the heart ; and
measured horizontally round the brisket his
girth is the enormous dimensions of 10 feet,
10 inches.
Mr. Moore is one of the most extensive
cattle feeders in Cecil, and has at present
upwards of oO head of hooves, of the very
finest quality found in the markets. There
sire huge numbers of cattle fatted in this
part of our county, of the best quality sold
in the Philadelphia market. We intend to
notice other lots at some future, time, and
give some description of the process of feed
ing. Few who are not practical feeders
have anything like a just conception of the
care and judgment required in this branch
of the farmer’s occupation.
On Monday lasi, Eli Cosgrove,- the
new Sheriff, bonded —Messrs K. I). McClcn
nliHii and (i. F. \\ hitaker, securities—and
entered upon the discharge of his duties.—
Mr. Cosgrove moved his family into town
on \\ ednesday last, and took formal posses
sion of the jail.
A Good Thing if it is Carried Out.
\\ o see that the Town Authorities have
had,the leaves and mud cleaned out of the
gutters, and piled in heaps along the streets.
This is a good move, if the heaps, as usual,
arc not left till the half of them is Washed
back into the gutters again before they arc
removed. At present, they do very well to
frighten horses, and for people to fall over
in these dark nights.
-Look Out for Them,—One dollar
notes altered to $5 on the Fanners’ Bank of
Wilmington, are said to he in circulation.
Those altered notes have the words Farmers'
Bank printed in a semi-circle over the top
with a large figure o in the right and left
hand upper corners. On the genuine five,
the words Farmers Bank, are printed in a
straight line through the centre.
Our town and county is flooded with
bogus “ quarters.” By a little scrutiny
they are easily detected.
Hoo Killing.—During the past
week, the squealing of “ porkers ” has been
quite frequent. The weather being cold,
many a hog has had to forfeit his life, and
sausage and 1 ‘ scrapple ” are abundant.—
We have heard of several large hogs being
killed ; the heaviest one we have heard the
weight of, was one belonging of Mr. Joseph
Taylor, of this town, which weighed 017
pounds.
VV T E find the following in the Cam
bridge Intelligencer . It appears that the
Secession mad dog has been through Cam
bridge and bitten the ladies in that goodly
town as badly, and it would scorn worse,
than in our own little Paradise of Klkton.—
'Hit Intelligencer fears the total destruction
of tHe churches from this secession manta.
If there is not grace enough in the churches
to save them, we suppose they will have to
share the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah.
It is written, however, that there is one
church which the gates of Hell shall not
prevail against. If the Intelligencer will seek
that church, ho will find no secession ladies
there to “ mock the worship of God,*’ and
jump on their seats, tormented by the evil
spirit within them. But we think the signs
of the times are, that the secession devils will
ere long he cast out of those poor sufferers,
whom he is so tormenting : but whether he
will enter a herd of swine or a herd of
niggers as his future abode, our philosophy

IV k recommend the suggestions of

Commissioners:
For The Cecil Whig.
Finn.—A creditable degree of presence of
mind in one of our merchant’s clerks, it is
said, prevented a few evenings since, what
might have been a very disastrous fire in
our town.
After listening to an account of the occur
rence hinted at, and which I trust to your
local columns, Mr. Editor, for the details of,
f endeavored to recollect at what period in
the past, remote or recent, 1 had observed,
or heard of any movement among our town
firemen indicative of preparation for the
alarming cry of—fire !so apt to he heard ut
this season of the year. Failing to remem
ber the hearing of any such “ note of pre
paration,’’ 1 began lu cogitate upon the
probable condition of the town's fire appa
ratus —housed away during the late h"ky
season in an old rieketty shed with a litre
roof; its machinery necessarily rusted, and
its hose rotting. The result of my cogita
tions was a conviction that, in case of a fire
in the town, two houses might he consumed
before the engine could he got to the scene
of danger; treble that number before the
levers could be brought into action, and,
when that was accomplished, that the whole
town might lie dost roved for the want of
sound hose to supply the engine with water.
This lack of preparation for an emergency,
always more or less imminent nt this season
of the year, when the searching!,- frosty
breath of liorcas bids us pile high the fag
gots on (he broad henrtstone, is certainly
not, well calculated to add to the soundness
of our midnight slumbers, or the feelings of
security with which we nil desire to go
about our daily vocations, both of which
important considerations, it is presumable,
our citizens had in view in contributing, not
long since, to the purchase of a more effec
tive lire apparatus than the old one.
That this state of affairs is dangerous mid
ought not to exist is apparent to nil. That
it is difficult, if not impossible, to keep up
an efficient fire organization in the town
past experience attests. What, then, shall
he done —what remedy he devised for the
securing the essential “ ounce of preven
tive’’ said to he “ worth a pound of cure?”
I suggest, Mr. Editor, that the Town Com
missioners take this matter in hand, and
make such provision for the repair of the
hose, as well as for the necessary attention
to the “ imiebiiie ’’ during the winter, as
will ensure its efficiency should we he
started from our slumbers these blustering
nights by the alarming peal of the
Fire Bell.

Htsmo Sun, Dec. 4th, ’Ol.
Mu. Ewino, — Dear Sir .-—There not baring
appeared for some tfme any communication
in your paper from this place, 1 take tho
liberty to drop yon a few lines.
Our farmers have pretty muck finished their
season’s labor, and the reward has been moat
bountiful; to better crops, as a general thing,
haring been raised for years. Much corn,
however, is yet in the field, and the cold
weather for the last few days will find some
still unprepared for it
The Ladies ol this vicinity, prompted by
the address of the Suuilary Commission, and
their own loyal and benevolent toolings,
which always stimulate (hem to the work ot
benevolence and charily have organized an
Association for the purpose of furnishing aid
to the sick anil founded ot the Federal army,
and also such minor articles of clothing, aa
may not be furnished by Government, to tlm
Federal troops who shall bo compelled to
undergo the severity and hardships of a win
ter campaign. Thu organization was tempor
arily effected on Saturday, and a proper com
mittee appointed to solicit contributions, and
at the next meeting, on Thursday following
they reported contributions amounting to
over ninety dollars, and cash paid into the
Treasury of over (Illy dollars. This wc think
is doing pretty well for the Brat three days.—
Any person feeling anxious to contiibuto can
be accommodated by calling at lire Boat OHico
or store in onr village.
Political matters arc pretty quiet since the
election, onr most bitter secessionists now
professing to he Union men—their hypocrisy
being equaled by their impudence.
Our worthy (?) Slate Senator is again at
liberty, and I suppose will take his place in
the Senate to represent Ibis county. Most of
onr people here think, as (te promised when
ever he cun lit not satisfactorily represent tho
people of the county ho would resign, tho
time has pretty nearly arrived. Truly yours.
