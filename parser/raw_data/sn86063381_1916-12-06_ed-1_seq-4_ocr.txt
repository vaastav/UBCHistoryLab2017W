THE N. M. D. A.
Some seven years ago the Northern
Minnesota Development association
was organized in Bemidji. Today it
is a healthy, progressive and aggres
sive organization. The association
has in a great measure carried out
its high purpose, the development of
Northern Minnesota.
Tomorrow the association will hold
its seventh annual meeting in Be
midji. Hundreds of delegates from
all sections of the state will be pres
ent and matters of great interest and
great importance will be discussed.
This association represents 19
counties with an aggregate area of
twenty million acres of landtwo
fifths of the state of Minnesota.
There has been some discussion in
regard to distaontinuing the associa
tion. Dame Rumor has come forth
with the statement that this would
probably be the last meeting.
Stop! The delegates should not for a mo
ment consider the disorganization of
the association. The work is not
doneit has just begun. Much re
mains to be done for the betterment
of conditions and the advancement of
Northern Minnesota. The meeting
will be held tomorrow because the
agricultural area of Northern Min
nesota is yet undeveloped.
We hope that the matter of dis
organization will not be considered
at all.
THE MESSAGE.
In a simple, appropriafe
manner,
President Wilson read his message to
the 64th congress which has begun
itt dying session
If congress passes the measures!
urged upon it by the president, it
will have plenty to do before March
4
President Wilson urged the en
largement and administrative reor
ganization of the Interstate Com
merce commission he urged provi
sions for public investigation and as
sessment of all industrial disputes
he urged that the national executive
be given power to take over, control
and operate the railways when neces
sary in time of war or other like pub
lic necessity.
Nothing was said in regard to the
1 by the president, but it is
believed that he is studying the sit
uation and that he will later deliver
a special message when a plan he
deems feasible has been found
SHEEP RAISING.
Sheep raising is a paying proposi
tion and as a result Beltrami county
farmers are buying and raising more
sheep.
Muzzy, who has a farm near
Thief River Falls, has* proven that
sheep raising is a paying proposition
in this district. He has kept a care
ful tab on the sheep on his farm dur
ing the past season. He places his
investment at $800, of which $200
is a charge for the 26 head of sfheep
with which he started. Pastureage
was also charged against the flock
at the rate of $100 per acre, the al
lotment being six acres.
The debit items of his record fol
low:
Hay $25.00
Care 10.00
Feed during lambing period. 5.00
Interest on capital stock. 80.00
Taxes 5.00
Loss in flock 8.00
$133.00
To the credit of the flock:
Wool, 265 pounds ...$79 50
Four lambs shipped 31.00
Four sheep sold 29.00
Twelve lambs born 92.00
Two lambs for home use.... 17.00

AN AUTOMOBILE.
An automobile is not a wagon,
neither is it a boat or any other mode
of conveyance described by the fed
eral statutes as subject to seizure
and confiscation by the government
when used to carry liquor or other
contraband into dry Indian territory.
This is the essence of a decision just
made.by Judge Bourquin of the fed
eral court in Butte, Mont., in declin
ing to order the confiscation of an
automobile alleged to have been used
by a half-breed in carrying liquor in-
to the Flathead reservation. The
court contends that when the statute
was passed there were no automo
biles and asJ a mode of conveyance
they were unknown.
The decision is considered at vari
ance with that of fellow judges in
Minnesota and other states, where
cars have been seized by federal
agents and sold for carrying liquor
into dry territory.
Stillwater Gazette: California is
for good roads. At the recent elec
tion, by a vote of 5 to 1, they decided
to authorize the issuance of bonds in
the sum of $15,000,000 for the com
pletion of the system of state high
ways This will be money splendidly
expended. Good roads not only add
to the value of all property along
the highway, but they reduce the cost
of living by the ease and reduced ex
pense by which all farm commodities
can be sfhipped to the city. The state
has built to date 1,222 miles of state
roads at a cost of $16,000,000, to
which the above $15,000,000 is to be
added. About the best roads in the
United States are to be found in
California, which is an asset very
valuable and one that is always an
attraction. Minnesota is a wealthy
state we can afford to be liberal
along thisi line.
DOUBL PROVE N
Bemidji Readers Can No Longer
Doubt the Evidence.
This Bemidji citizen testified long
ago.
Told of quick reliefof undoubted
benefit.
The facts are now confirmed.
Such testimony id completethe
evidence conclusive.
It forms convincing proof of merit.
Mrs. Carl Golz, 623 Minnesota Ave.,
Bemidji, says: "I had a lame back
and suffered from distressing head
aches and dizzy spells. My kidneys
caused me great annoyance. After
using two boxes of Doan'st Kidney
Pills, obtained at Barker's Drug Store
the lameness and aching left me and
I felt better in every way." (State
ment given March 20, 1914).
ALWAYS KEEP DOAN'S ON HAND.
TWO YEARS LATER Mrs. Golz
said: "The statement I gave in favor
of Doan's Kidney Pills some time ago,
still holds good. I always keep them
on hand and still get as good results!
as ever."
