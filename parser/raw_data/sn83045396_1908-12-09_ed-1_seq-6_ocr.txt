THE MESSAGE.
In former days tho Presidents' mes
sages always opened and dwelt with
great length upon our foreign relations.
The Prcsidcnt-'s message this year pays
littlo attontion to foreign affairs, but
ii occupied almost exclusively with
our own locll affairs and with a dis
cussion of the problems involved in our
territorial dependencies. It is a very
long message, but there is no question
but that it has "meat in it."
Tho message opens with a discussion
of the financial condition of tho coun
try, which, so far as tho finances of
tho Nation aro concerned, aro certainly
in a condition of e.xccllcnco that leaves
but little to be desired, so long as tho
present policy of keeping bonds out
standing for the use of tho National
banks to issue currency upon is per
sisted in. The ideal condition, of course,
would bo to do away with tho public,
debt and substitute somo other satis'
factory basis for currency issue, be
cause' it is not well for tho pcoplo
of this country tha they should bo re
quired to pay an interest charge
amounting closo upon twenty million
dollars a year so that the banks may
be supplied with security for their note
issues.
The President treats at length upon
corporations, and gives in his adhe
rence to the proposition that the rail
roads should bo put completely under
the Interstate. Commerce Commission
and romoved from the domain of the
anti-trust law. Ho points out advan
tages in this which aro easy to see. but
at tho samo timo tho Tailroads, when
.so placed, would bo the great trust of
all; especially if, as tho Prcsidont urges,
the power to make combinations and
traffic arrangements should bo explic
itly conferred upon thorn, subject only
to the permission pf the Interstate
Commerce Commission thereto. In all
this discussion, tho President, with ap
parent unconsciousness, is trying to find
a way to interfere with and regulate
tho oppressive trusts of the country,
whilo at the same time leaving out of
such regulations and restrictions tho
trusts that aro beneficial and oporale
to the advantage of tho communities
in which they operato, or of tho pub
lic at large of tho United States. It
is oxtremuly difficult to try to draw
a line on this question, and the Presi
dent evidently finds it so in his argu
ment. He avoids, apparently by intcn
Uou, the propositiou that the only
sound basis upon which the regulations
that he urges can properly rest is the
enactment of a National incorporation
law which will givo Cougross and tho
powers coming froln Congress, control
over the wholo subject. Tho United
States Supreme Court has repeatedly
dealt swingiug blows at the?c special
acts for relief, apparently becauso of
the lack of a National incorporation law
whereby nil ihosc intcrstato concerns (
might bo compelled lo incorporate and
so subject themselves to the National
jurisdiction. We do not look lo sco
any real relief from the oppressions of
trusts aiid combinations in corporato
form, transportation and otherwise, that
do much of an interstate business, un
til a National incorporation act is
passed which will bring all tho great
interstate corporations explicitly within
the Federal jurisdiction. A. great raauy
of these corporations are ready now
to avail themselves of such an act if
it were passed. Congress, howover, re
fuses to pass it. aud wo consider it
largely a waste of labor and time lo
urge these, that might be called float
ing enactmepts, that have no real busis
to rest upon.
The President accords both praise and
blame to tho courts, with a good deal
of freedom, and without the exhibi
tion of that comprehension and impar
tiality that ought to bo oxpected from
the executive office. Whew the Presi
dent uudortakes'to pass judgment upon
the decisions and rulings of courts and
to say that the judges aro the chief
lawmakers, Dccaubis uiuy aru iuo unui
and supremo authority, aud that, by in
ference, iho judges at times do not
possess high or fine characters nor the
elementary attributes of honest', cour
age, and fairmiudedness, and that a
judge will sometimes pander to dema
gogic sentiments or class hatreds or
prejudices; and whore the Presidpnt
assumes off-hand to state that certain
decisions of the courts are wrong and
harmful, then wo must wonder how the
President comes to possess such vast
omniscience that is denied to the judges,
who had every opportunity to b sot
right by reason of the hearings which
they lave had upon questions sub
mitted to them by argument, by
testimony, by authority, aud by
sound senso and judgment. We
cannot help but think that iho
President sets a bad examplo in
such destructive-criticism-of tho juili
ciar', and in assuming such vast pow
or3 of discriminating judgment for him
self, who haa not had tho benefit of
the arguments aud citations that the
judges have had, when ho so freely con
domns judgments "that the courts have
delivered, A little more reticenco and
a- duo consideration for the judges
would naturally bo expected at the
hands of tho President. And whore ho
concludes, after n sort . of geueral
"sloshing around," that ,ftho chief of
fender in any given case may be tho
executive, a legislature, or a judge,"
then one aces at once that it ia
simply an academic discussion that the
President is indulging in, and not
a practical proposition that is fit to
have any helpful effect. In this con
nection, however, the President is1 cer
tainly quite right when ho arraigns
such legislatures as are '''responsiblQ
for tho fact that our laws aro often,
prepared with slovenly hasto and lack
of consideration." That is certainly
true. Every ono's experienco confirms
it, and in no State is that criticism
more applicablo than in tho Stnto of
Utah.
On the forestry question the Presi
dent indulges in a very long argument
as to tho benefit of forests and tho
lamentable effects that occur when the
forests are cut down and the laud ia
laid baro and unprotected. His illus
trations of this, however, aro not very
appealing, because he does not confine
himself to known facta. When ho'
speaks about tho disastrous process of
deforestation in Northern China he
lacks evidence in support of the prop
osition. There is no reason to sup
pose that there has boon any defor
estation in Northorn China. And ko
far as that is concerned, thoro is no
placo in the world where deforesta
tion has been carried to a greator ex
tent than in Europe, and yet Europe
has recovered hor forests very largely
by attention to tree-growing when it
became evident that trees were needed.
And hero, as there, tree-growing will
be engaged in when it becomes profit
able. All this talk, however, about
forestry aud forestatiou is of littlo
real practical effect, so far as forest
reserves in this Western country arc
concerned; becauso for tho most part
these reserves aro not placed whero
thoro over wero forests, but on grazing
lands, and their separation into so
called forest reserves is very seldom
with any viow to forestntion, tho roal
point being to lako up tho grazing
land and compel tho stock owners to
pay a royalty for tho privilege of let
ting their stock cat the grass. Surely
an argument showing tho perils of
deforestation can hardly havo any ap
plication in regions whero there never
wero aiij' forests and where the for
estry service, so called, i3 not planting
trees and docs not expect to plant
them.
The President gives considerable
space in his message to tho question
of improving our inland waterways.
This is undoubtedly a question of tho
very highest importance, and one which
is of National moment. Thero can be
not tho least' doubt of the value of
improving our internal waterways, nor
of tho immensity of tho work which
can and should bo undertaken in that
direction. Such improvement should
include, among other things', the hand
ling of the Hood waters of tho great
stroains at their heads aud on their
tributaries, so as to provent the de
struction involved in tho spring floods,
as well as in providing this supply
of water to reinforce when needed tho
channel? for tho transportation of
freights along tho courses of (he nav
igable rivers. A navigable channel for
fairly docp-draft boats should be main
tained iu the Mississippi river, at least
as far up as St. Louis, and for the
usual sort of river craft to St. Paul".
Tho Ohio should bo navigable as far
as Pittsburgh, and could bo made so at
all seasons by the proper impouudr
ing of tho flood waters in tho great
gorges of the Alleghauics. The Mis-"
bouri also should be made navigable for
a long distaucc by the same means.
And the internal waterway along the
wholo Atlantic and Gulf coast, as
mapped by the internal waterway com
mission, would be of immense service
to tho country, both .commercially at
all times and protectively in tho case
of war. Tho immensity of this sub
ject is worth- of tho greatest powers
of the President and of the earnest at
tention of Congress.
Tho President urges, as does the,
Postmaster-General, the establishment
of postal savings bank?. Wo discussed
this question tho other day iu connec
tion with, the report of tho Postmaster
General, and do not see that the Presi
dent has added anything of value to
the discussion from his side of the
case, which we consider imperfect and
weak.
The President urges that tho Govern
ment should do everything possible by
way of helping on the cause of educa
tion, popular, technical, and practical.
In all this lie will receive tho united
support of every lover of tho Republic.
Thn President draws esnocial atton
tion l(jr tho needs of Hawaii in the
matter of improving tho coastwise ship
ping laws, aud the improvement of
Pearl Harbor for a naval baso and for
providing tho nocc'ssary .military for
tifications for the protection-of tho is
lands. And tho President is strenuous
in emphasizing the uocd of appropria
tions for theso purposes "of a certain
amount as will in the shortest possible
time make these islands practically im
pregnable." As to the Philippines, tho President
congratulates the country upon tho
progress made there, but withholds any
cstimato as to tho time when tho Fili
pinos will bo competent for absoluto
self-government. In two respects this
portion of his message will bo disap
pointing. First, because it docs not
deal with v tho question of the tariff as
between tho Philippines and this coun
try, and bocause it fails to say any
thing about the need of amending tho
laws governing coastwise traffic. The
needs of tho Filipino people on botli
of theso points aro tho samo as those
of tho people of Hawaii and of Porto
Kico. As to tho latter, tho President
recommends thnt American citizenship
should be conferred upon the Porto
Eicans, but says nothing about tho like
for' tho Filipinos. Wo think he is wise
as to the latter, but do not seo any
particular need of urging it for tho
Porto Iicaus, cither. Tho commercial
aud economic conditions as between this
country and ,Porio T?ico should be ex
tended in like degree to tho Filipinos,
and then tho people of both countries
should be treated ou broad, geueral Hues 1
practicallv alike.
The work of the Government in Cuba
is well briefed, and the situatiou thero
is as definitely- pointed put as can be
with such a frothy population as Cuba
has.
The President is insistent upon wocd-)
ing out tho so-called incompetent offi
cers of the army; which is a subject
that is rather raw in the public mcm
orj just now, by reason of certain
injustices and favoritisms that aro frco
ly charged by reason of such wooding
out tactics. Tho enso of Colonel Stew
art is ouo where tho weeding-out pro
cess takes distinctly the form of per
secution for no cause that it seems pos
siblo for officialdom to state. The con
gratulations of tho President upon the
bettered conditiou of tho National
Guard and tho assimilation of it with
tho Regular army, arc well placed; and
this assimilation should be carried even
further than it is.
As to tho navy, the President ad
heres to his former insistence upon a
strong navy and upon the compelling
effect for ponce of tho country being
impregnable. Ho explicitly mentions
as something dcsirablo "to build as
soon as possiblo a squadron of oight
battleships of tho be6t existing type,
the North Dakota, Delaware, and Utah,
will form tho first division of this
squadron." All of which is to bo
praised, not alone from the general
standpoint, but from the local. Wo arc
;ill glad to havo the battleship Utah
figure in the first class. The Presi
dent seems to havo very clear and
deqided ideas about the navy, much
better than ho has about tho amy.
His scrvico as First Assistant Secre
tary of the Navy is doubtless much in
his favor when ho comes to discuss
ing naval matters. In discussing naval
questions the President goes into de
tail with a minuteness and tmroness
that is most notably lacking when he
discusses army questions.
Tho message docs not loavo uu
touchod mauy matters of any general
or, wo might add, special interest; but
thero is. ono conspicuous exception. A
matter of tho keenest interest is alto
gether omitted; that is, tariff revision.
Tho President makes no reference to
the tariff or the rovisiou of tho tariff.
He knows, of course, that the present
session of Congress is too short .and
will bo too much thronged with other
matters to allow of :iny attontion being
paid lo tho tariff question, aud that it
is impossible now to take up general
tariff revision. The President evident
ly leaves this matter for the uext ad
ministration. It will be tho particular
and memorable work of President Taft
to bring about a general revision of
the tariff, suchas the country demands
at tho present time, and it is under
stood that his first work will bo to call
a special session of Cougrcss for that
purpose.
This message is Mr. Roosevelt's final
general one to Congress. Of course he
may send special messages at any time
upon subjects, which lie wishes to dis
cuss. Tt must bo admitted that this
final message is one of the most force
ful and practical ever delivered to any
Congress by any Presideut. It could
bo improved upon, very much, however,
by a candid and intelligent surgical
operation, lechuicalb' knowu in hows
paper offices as "blue penciling." but
on the whole, and except ing his vagaries
upon the forestry question which ho
discusses in a phase that has nothing
to do with tho forestry operations of
the Government in this Westorn coun
try, and some other matters of thai
kind which aro treated moro from a
standpoint of hypothesis and specula
tion than from any official or practical
basis, the messago will be ono long to
bo remembered for its practical vigor
and force.
POSTAL SAVINGS PROGRAMME.
Wc aro glad to sco that in a fuller
discussion of tho postal savings bank
proposition, tho United, States Senate
is not disposed to acccdo so readily to
the administration programme in favor
of such banks, as it was at first sup
posed it would do. Tho dispatches state
that Senator Carter, of Montana, had
an understanding with Senators and
pledges of a sufficient number of them
to pass tho postal savings bank bill in
tho Sonatc. Tt appears now, however,
that this programme is off. and that if
Senator Carter calls tho bill up on De
cember 14th, as the programme was
that tho would do, according to tho
dispatches, tho bill will then aud there
be defeated.
The investigations condnctcd by tho
members of the National monetary
commission and their report of condi
tions as found iu Europe, aro allcgod
as tho reason for this change of senti
ment. Chairman Aldrich is reported as
being ready to take a positive stand
against the passage of the bill, and it
is said that his opposition will bo suf
ficient to defeat it.
Thero has' also como to bo a much
better understanding in this counfr
about what this postal savings proposi- J
tiou really is aud (ho onc-sidednoss of
tho reasons urged for it. than iad been
had heretofore. Tho Tribune pointed
out tho other day tho fallacy of the
figures quoted by the Postmaster Gen
oral in-support of the postal savings
proposition where ho .isaumed that
there arc no savings facilities in tweu- J
ly-hix Stales of the Union. His statis- ,
tics cover only the savings banks or
ganized solely as such, and neglected
altogether the savings bank depart
ments of the general banks throughout
the country. Mr. George M. Coffin,
former deputy comptroller of the 'our- j
renc3', has recently presented ?omc facts j
on Ibid question which entirely annul
tho claims of tho Postmaster General
as to tho lack of savings banks facili- J
ties in the country at large. Mr. Cof-
fin says that Iho President-elect has i
been misled by the incorrect informa
tion' referred to, and ho undertakes to j
straighlcn out the Postmaslor General 's J
figures in tho following style: j
lie Ithb Postmaster General etatos
that In "only olevun of the Suites ore
thero .savings-bunks faclHtletj." A ref
erence to page S73, Controller's Report for
1107. shows " that there are mutual and
stock savings banks In twenty States be
sides the District of Columbia. Instead of
only In uloven States.
Bc-sldcs this every well-Informed banker
knows that not only In these twenty
Suites with savings banks, but In tho
other twenty-six States as well, "aavlnsc
hank faclIltlOB" aro freelv and fully fur
nished not only by State banks and trust
companies, hut by National banks as
Well.
In theso twenty-six States without
"auvlngs-bank facilities" wo find 10.100
banks doing business with a guarantee
tund of 5811.000,000 In capital and surplus
and holdlnp deposits to the great amount
of 53,380,000.000. In aomo of them so keen
Is tho competition and so great tho de
mand for banking funds wo find one
dollar In capital and surplus for every
two or three dollars of deposits, which
clearly affords the savings depositors
groater security than tho mutual savings
bank without any capital stock whatso
ever. It Is a well-known fact that In all theso
n-m-savlngs-bank States, the National arid
State banks and trust companies furnish
very extensive "savings-bank facilities."
not only by Issuing time certificates of
deposit hearing Interest, but by receiv
ing deposits from 25 cents up Just a
savings banks do and paying interest
thereon at 31 and 4 per cent.
All of which shows that the subject
needs a rcdiscussion from the standpoint
of "newly discovered evidence." And
Mr. Coffin estimates tho cost of con
ducting a postal savings business at
$1,000,000 above tho revenue from it.
The information supplied by tho Post
master General is thus seen to be ut
terly misleading and void. Tho country
knows better than the Postmaster Gen
eral on this point, and thnt better
knowlodgo must be taken into consid
eration. The argument for the postal
savings bank has distinctly lost ground
by reason of the misleading informa
tion cited in snpport of tho proposition.
And it looks decidedly doubtful if this
country will evor consent to tho insti
tution of the postal savings banks system.
THE MAYOR AND "RED LIGHT."
Mayor Bransford, in his interview
with representatives of tho press with
respect to his roasous for tho removal
of Chief of Polico Pitt, mado it very
clear that his personal campaign in this
matter is squarely and unswervingly in
favor of tho official establishment of
the red-light district on tho west side
of the city. In this tho Mayor coin
cides with tho schomo proposed by Chief
Pitt last winter. Tho difference be
tween the two is not ono of principle,
but as to the site. Mr. Pitt docs not
think tho Mayor's site is tho right ono;
his choice would bq somewhere else.
This, howover, does not constitute any
differenco between the two on the mat
ter of principle.
In taking this stand in favor of tho
establishment officially of a red-light
district, Mayor Bransford runs counter
to the law, and is clearly usurping a
function in behalf of tho criminal class
which in no way pertains to his office
of Mayor. As wc have pointed out from
time to time, it is impossible from a
legal standpoint for any civic official
to undertake the establishment of a
business, or to set apart any placo for
tho operation of any business, that is
an unlawful business, and that it is tho
duty of tho official to suppress and not
to promote. Ma3-or Bransford must bear
the whole brunt of tho responsibility
of this attitude which ho has assumed,
and for which wo can seo no justifica
tion, either personal or official.
When Chief Pitt proposed the cstab
lishment of such an unlawful reserva
tion for vice and crime in his annual
report last winter, Tho Tribuno came
out in unreserved disapproval. From
time to time evor since when this mat
tor has conio forward wc have opposed
tho establishment of t.his red-light dis
trict, or auy other unlawful compound
in this cit. Wc aro still opposed fo
it on tho west sido or anywhere ejse.
Tt is the business of the city officials
to clcau out Commercial street, or any
other nest of vice and crimo that may
bo found, cither oponly flaunting its
lawlessness in tho face of the publio
or burrowing iu secret fUth and abomi
nation. But to say coincident with or
in any way otherwise, that the city
officials may, either after or before
cleaning ont any nest of vice, establish
a similar placo of lawlessness and do
gradation elsewhere, is lo run entirely
counter to tho law and lo public morals.
The American party in convention and
otherwise has expressly disapproved tho
establishment of this red-light district.
The American club addressed au em
phatic letter to the Governor on this
question, sinco tho red-light district was
being established apparently under
State authority and by Stato incorpora
tion. Tho Tribuno and tho American
party, therefore, have cleared their
skirts entirely of this red-light proposi
tion, and tho party will undoubtedly
keep entirelyJclcar of it; and The Trib
une will certainly maintain its consistency-
throughout in opposition.
Wo may say, further, thd.t the suit
to restrain tho company which is al
leged to be putting in this red-light dis
trict is now pending in court. If the
court should find that this company is
proposing an illegal, criminal business,
it is likely to dissolve tho corporation
and to direct the proper officers to see
that tho business is not established. So
far as this is concerned, tho case is in
tho hands of the court, and will bo
dealt with, doubtless, according to law.
If it should transpire, however, that
the court should act against this red
light district, we do nor. see how Maj'or
Bransford can possibly carry out his
purpose, so boldly- announced, of estab
lishing the red-light district in the lor
cality selected 'for" it.
It is a bad business all through, and
tho official making himself responsible
for tho establishment of a resort of
vico and crimo in this city must bear
tho odium which that establishment will
involve. Whilo on the contrary, if the
courts step in and thwart his design,
tho odium will be no less, while he will
bo impotent to, establish tho evil that
he has planned.
The Tribune does not believe the
project to which the Mayor has given
his approval will he tolerated. Power
ful interests in tho dominant church
are vitally concerned in protecting
and retaining their Commercial
street tonants because of the
enormous revenue derived thorefrom.
These interests wero sufficiently
I potent during tho sheriff 'a raids in Oc
tober to compel tho church-controlled
officials to overlook all those who oc
cupied tho properties owned by tho
churchmou, the Tosult of which was
that tho most conspicuous places were
not visited by the sheriff's forces, and
aro yet being conducted.
Americans arc willing to accept the
statement of tho News that party man
agers have been unablo to agree with
the Mayor. Which is to say, the party
is unalterably opposed to Mr. Brans
ford's views on the red-light district.
PANAMA CANAIi BOND SALE.
Tho Government has scored a dis
tinct financial triumph in the negotia
tion of tho $30,000,000 of Panama ca
nal bonds which wero offered to tho
public. Thero wero 83-i bids received
all told; 159 accepted. Tho bonds
wero subscribed noarly thrco and ono
half times ovor, and the lowest accept
ed bid was on a premium of 2.2773.
The average premium was 2.4368. A
premium of this kind on a 2 por cent
bond shows that the Government se
curities aro counted fancy-, even with
tho vory low rate of interest.
No such financial trinmph could pos
sibly havo been scored at any timo
when thore was not such an immenso
amount of money lying idlo, as at
present. Thero is a reluctance among
the owners of that idlo money to put
it in stocks and bonds under present
conditions and with tho agitations that
aro threatened. But there is always
safety in Government bond6. Tho buy
er of thorn is frco from all taxation,
local or otherwise, upon them, aud tho
2 per cent interest received is cloar
money. It was fine for the Government
to sell these bonds as they woro sold,
and it is always a perfectly safe and
gilt-edged investment for tho publio
with money on hand that it does not
know what to do with, to buy Govern
ment bonds.
AERIAL WARFARE.
Ex.Secrotary Motcalf of tho navy
sees great impending possibilities in
aorial warfare. He considers that the
navigation of tho air has already beon
established boyond all question. Ho
speaks of tho Wright aaroplano as cap
ablo, as at present developed, of mak
ing a flight of two hundred miles
under perfect control. Certain details
as to method of starting and of perfect
ing tho motive power aro yet to bo
satisfactorily worked out, but he evi
dently considers that tho problem of
aorial navigation has been practically
solved.
He frankly 6ays that it is impossible
to forecast tho full effect of this upon
future warfare. But ho cousiders that
development of tho airship and aero
plane will havo nloro to .do than any
thing else with disarmament of tho na
tions, as the only way possible to
meet a fleet of aerial craft would bs
with a simijar fleet. But tho awful dc
structivoness of a warfare of that kind
is hideous to think about. Warfare at
tho best is dosporalely cruel and inhu
man. Warfare on tho sea. is worse
than warfare on the land, as it involves
tho destruction of hundreds, perhaps
thousands, by drowning who may not
havo been wounded 3t all; and still
somo may escape In aorial warfare,
however, tho escapo of anybody in case
an airship were crippled would be abso
lutely out of tho question. Those cu
gaged in aerial warfare would offer
themselves to certain death.
The idea has been suggested that in
caso of aorial warfare thero should bo
coriain rules and regulations to conduct
that warfaro upon; somewhat as in
pugilistic encounters we havo tho Lon?
don prizo ring, tho Qucensbury rules,
etc. But the prize ring is supposed to
be sport; war, on the contrary, is dead
earnest. The idea in war is to kill and
cripplo as many as possible of tho
enemy. And it is diffieult, indeed, to
seo how any warfare at all could be
conducted iu tho air that would be sub
ject to any real modifications in the
lino of humanity that would bo worth
while, or that would not so restrict
the-liberty of the fightors as to render
thn war play, instead of fight. And
then it must always bo remembered
that the utmost resources available will
always bo employed by a weaker peo
plo against their aggressors, so that
1 the idea -of mitigating the horrors of
figliting in the air would appear to be
impracticable.
We aro glad to note that ex-Sccrelary
Metcalf is of the opinion that a ficc,t
should -bo nmintainod in the Pacific
similar to the one iu the Atlantic, and
also that additional naval base3 should
be provided ou the west coast. This is
precisely what The Tribune has been
urging all along. The Pacific fleet
should be at least as largo as the At
lantic licet, and there should be pro
vided aJJ the accessories for tho build
inu', repairing, pud cleaning of ships.
There should be largo dry docks; there
should be every sort of machinery
that is roquired for naval purposes;
thore should be gun casting machinery
also, ospociajly for tho navy, an the
west coast. All this without regard to
tho Panama canal, whether it is finished
or not finished; becauso thorq is uo tell
ing which coast will first need the de
fenso assured by a competent naval
force, nor how quickly it will need it.
In taking this position, ex-Secrotary
Mutcalf is. clearly out Of harmony with
the administration, The carrying out
of his view would havo involved the
countormapding of the orders for tho
fleet io fail away from tho Pacific after
it got there, and there is no doubt ip
tho world but that those Orders should
have been countermanded. Thero aro.
many ships building on the Atlantic
coast, and there is an ample force thero
for all prosent purposes. Possibly thiS 1
may be also an amplo force on tho I'
cific coast for all present purposes, JkSt .
certainly tho Pacific is tho critical poSh'aI
at tho present time, and will bo so 'I
many years to come. "jMi J
