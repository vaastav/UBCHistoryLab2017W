President's Message.
We published thi document in aa Extra ou
Thursday last. Bythistimeoorsubscriberahave
ail had s chance of reading it, and all those that
did so, have formed their opinion as to its mer
its or demerit The Presidents opiaiocs, aad
his eonrse of policy toward such of the South
era States as are threatening dis-union, were,
very naturally, looked for with a great degree
of importance. He Has aisappoinrea every one.
The South expected to be rebaked, and the
forth hoped that he would enforce the laws
against them. President Bichaxas clearly
proves, says Mr. Seward, speaking of the Mes
sage, and lis the best commentary we have
seen npon it ''that no State has a right to se
cede unless it wishes to, and that it is the Pres
ident's duty to enforce the laws unless some
body opposes him."
' The Message is ridiculed by both parties.
The President has placed himself in the position
of a man trying to ride two horses going in op
posite directions. He is for a while for the
South, then he is for the North. He says first
that South Carolina has just cause for secession;
then he says she has no right to secede. Third
That we have no riehtto Drevent her waxlinir
That is the amount of the Message, substantial
ly. Then the President goes on to represent
this ss a great and powerful country, and that
BO State has a right to secede from it; and all
the power of the country consists in what Dick
ens makes the English Constitution consist the
power to do nothing. It wan incumbent on the
(President of the United States to have pointed
-out and recommended to Congress some rule,
and to hare told them what he recommended
ithem to doi The only way to escape the dan-
gur is ui iuuk 11 ib lue lace, shu toe cuunirj uiu
vsnect from the President some exrmsition of
decided policy.

The Signs of the Times.
We give up much space in to-days paper to
the 2Tewa from Washington and the Southern
States. The news from that quarter is indica
tive of trouble, serious and lasting trouble. Ko
less than five slave States are assuming an atti
tude of open hostility to the General Govern
merit. Each, by an exercise of undoubted sov-
. ereign power, has authorized or is about to au
thorize, a delegate convention of its people, to
consider questions of tne gravest concern to the
wrrmlp TTninn anrl nil nf Irtnu Sfcirps tlirpntpn.
by an exercise of power clearly denied by the
plainest import of the constitution, to throw off
- their allegiance to the Federal Government
some absolutely for what tbey claim has already
' occurred, and others on the happening of events
which will inevitably occur.
Whatever may have been the real motives in
limes past, it can no lunger be disguised that
' the leaders of the disunion movement are now
animated by a treasonable purpose to break up
this Government. That their plans, intricate
and formidable as it may be, will be finally
frustrated, is our earnest hope, but that they
will be, we have serious fears to the contrary.
We shall not be surprised if Congress is broken
up in less than a month, and in its train follow
the greatest calamity of the age, the disruption
of our Government.

Gen . Joseph Axken y, of Millersburg, was se
lected to convey the Certificates to Washington
We are pleased that the choice fell upon our
townsman. First, because he is well qualified
for the station; 2nd, he is a whole-souled, live
Republican; and 3d, it is but fair that in the
distribution of honors, we are glad Holme

speaking of our county.
It is true Holmes county is largely Locofoco,
and 'tis also true, that there arc some "mighty
mean" men amongst them, but there are also
-among them, some as clever, generous, whole
souled men as you can find anywhere. Since
we came into their midst, many of them have
lain us under obligation to them by acts of
kindness which we never hope to forget.
Thi Iberia Fugitive Slave Case. The Grand
Jury of the United States Court for the North
rn District of Ohio, has found bills against the
following persons: Rev. George Gordon, James
Hammond, Ashbury Parker, Calvin Bowland,
Joseph T. Baldwin, E. D. Ashbury, Jonathan
McLaren. The charge is for obstructing ser
vice of process by the U. S. Marsha, S. W.
Gifford, of the Southern District of Ohio, and
his deputies at Iberia, Morrow county, on the
27th of September lost. The object of the Mar
shal was to secure a fugitive slave.
r The same parties arc also indicted for prose
cuting the owners of the negro and their as
sistants, with a view to obstruct them in the
-reclamation of the negro under the Fugitive
Slave Law.- In both cases the defendants are
charged with committing the alleged offences
in company with a large number of persons un
known to the Grand Jury. .
"J"Judge Black, the legal adviser of Presi
dent Buchanan, has issued his manifesto and
declares that no State has the Constitutional
Tight to secede, and that it is the duty of the
President to enforce the laws against all parties
attempting to take possession of the property
belonging to the Government or interfering in
any way ia the discharge of their duties, by its
officers.

Scene in the Senate.
Tbe Cincinnati CommerdaTs telegraph
correspondent gives a scene in the Senate
as follows:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.
On motion concerning the reference of
the President's Message, Lane, of Oregon,
made an apology for the dissolution of the
Union, saying it must dissolve unless the
rights of the South are further guaranteed.
Hale, of New Hampshire, said the logic
of this contioversy was war or submission.
The minority must submit to the majority.
He made no threats, and spoke without
having consulted anybody; he spoke for
himself only, and one little Slate. "We
must look this matter straight in the face."
Brown, of Miss., desired to know if Hale
presented the issue of war or submission.
Hale said it must lead to that. He
made no threat.
Brown replied sternly: "We will not
submit, ana if it is war let come and God
show the right."
Iverson of Ga was quiet at first, but
laughed in the end. He accepted the
President's declaration that secession is rev
olution. "The States understand tbev do
it at the peril of consequences." He did
not believe it would lead to war, but if it
does the South is preparing to receive its
enemies with bloody bands and hospitable
graves. He hoped there would be no war;
that we would live in rjeace.
The South ; would regard the North
among the most favored of nations, and
so treat with ber, but to remain in the Un
ion she would not. No power on earth
could prevent her withdrawal. The repeal
of all tbe personal liberty bills of tbe
Isortb would be vain. "I rue they are ob
noxious, bat we care nothing for their prac
til operation. But we know their existence
shows the feeling of the people. They
indicate two distinct civilizations. Tbe
hadtred of the North for the South is deep
as bell, and I tell you my brethren on tbe
floor no love is lost between us. Two hos
tile nations occupy this floor. We are en
emies. They did not come across this
floor to extend to us ordinary' ciritities,
yesterday, nor did we go tbeni.
We are hostile. Tbe State I represent
accepts the issue of war or submission.
We will not submit. ; I tell the gentle
men South Carolina will not go alone, b lor
ida, Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia,
will all be out by January 16lu, never to
return; in less than twelve months after
our Government will be in operation, Ar
kansas and Louisana will follow. One
thing only prevents Texas that is her
Governor, and if be does not yield to over
whelming public sentinent some Texan
Brutus will reach his heart, and rid the
world of a vile and hoary-headed traitor."
Mr. Iverson discarded nil sham, saying
that the election of Lincoln was no cause
for secession, but tbe South would not be
governed by the North, and intended to
go out while she bad strength, not wail
until she was too weak.
Douglas sat scowling in his seal ; South
ern men looked cool. The Northern men
were calm ana collected. Unttenden was
profoundly moved, and the galleries were
astounded. Jen. Davis, in a decisive wny,
said he came as a Senator of the United
States. While there is yet no declaration
of war against States of which we are the
mere ambassadors, he would discharge his
duty as Senator, and would shy nothing on
the subject.
Wigfall talked Senators out of thei
seals, but he said one good th ing. He said
that he disagreed with Hale. That Sen
ator said the President's message was nei
ther one thing nor the other. Wigfall
thought it both oue thing aud the other.
Salbury of Delaware, made an earnest
and eloquent plea for the Union, which
was received wilh thunders of applause in
the galleries. He said Delaware was the
first to go into the Union and would be the
last to go out. She would use all her
power to preserve the Union. The disun
ion speeches were received in profound si
leuce. -

bill to construe tbe meaning of the words
minimum price ot public lands' passed.
It provides that the word minimum
be construed according to tbe Land Gradua
tion Act so as to apply to alternate and
reserved sections of land granted for rail
roads or international improvements, and
in favor of actual settlers, aud not to mean
one dollar and a quarter per acre as now
officially constructed.
The Speaker appointed the following
special committee uuder Mr. Boteler's res
olution to, consider questions connected

Ohio, Cor win, chairman; Virginia, Mill

The Speaker desired to say the Parlia
mentary usage was to name on the com
ruillee the mover of the resoluliou under
which the committee was ordered to be
formed. He had omitted the unme of
Mr. Boteler at that gent's own request.
He had endeavored to appoint the com
mute to the best of his judgement and at
the earliest period, in view of the impor
tant business with whin the commitee was
entrusted.
Mr. Hawkins, of Fla- said last Tuesday
I begged to be excused from voting; for
similar reasons I ask to be excused from
serving on this committee. I have consul
ted with older members as to whether it
is voluntary or not for a member appoint
ed on n committee to Ferve, and have been
informed that he is compelled by the rules
of the House to , serve unless excused
and that if ho does not serve be subjects
himself to something like rebuke or repri
mand on the part of the House. Now as
long as I am nnxions to respect all its
rules and I am unwilling to draw upon my
self rebuke or reprimand ; I therefore ask
the House to excuse me from being a mem
ber of that committee. If I am compell
ed by the ruies or custom to serve, I will
be a very unimportant and not an elhcienl
member. I know I cannot act with all the
committee. As to the idea of getting up
a committee wilh unanimity, pence, and
a Union saving manner, I have been op
posed to anything of that kind in the past
and am now, believing that the time for
compromise is past forever, .
Mr. Jno. Cocrane of New York said.
that he had heard with a great deal of re
gret his friend asked to be exensed from
serving on the committee. It has well
been said here to-day in the chaplain's
prayer that the gray shadow of the daik
wing of dissolution has been extended over
our house and country, and so deep is the
gloom that we can scarcely discern one
gleam of light to enable us to transact the
ordinary business of legislation. Men's
minds have been devoted for weeks past to
the great and absorbing topic of controver
sy which enlists all thoughts, and demands
of every individual his best exertions and
his purest wisdom. - It is of importance to
this issue that the Republic should com
mand the exertions and efforts of all its
citizens. I believe now, in the midst of
this crisis, with the perils impending over
the country, that there is no reason why
this House, representing the patriotism and
wisdom of the country, should excuse the
gentleman from Florida. I believe that
Ironi all parts of bis State where the peo
ple are looking wilh solicitude on passing
events and with anxious eyes, if the vboice
of bis constituents could be heard, it would
be in tones beseeching nnd appealing to
their representative to stand forward in this
issue and assume the brunt of tbe contro
versy. He did not believe with the gentleman
that it was important to the welfare of tha
country tbnl there should be a unanimous
report-on the subject referred to the com
mittee. ; However, God grant it may be.
(Applause in the galleries accompanied by
cries of "order, order," on the floor.) God
grant it may be stamped with the unanim
ity which patriotism demands. If this
country is to be saved if patriotism is not
sufficient to command this glorious result
it is due that the people of the United
Stales should know it: it ia due to the be
nighted regions of the country that the
fuels should be impressed on their minds
and ignorance no longer be pleaded as an
excuse for tbe acts which have brought us
to this fearful precipiCC- : If we re not t0
have a nnanimus leport to save tne coun
try from the pangs and agony of secession,
let us know what demands are made by
one section of the country from the other,
nnd let us feel what is the pulsation of the
country, llnd let ns answer the examinato
ry inquisition that comes from eveiy por
tion of tbe land, "Watchman, what of the
night," clearly and conclusively, whether
storms and madness rule the hour, whether
there is a harbinger of peace or whether
there is one glenm of morning in which
we may yet discern the stars and stripes
floating from yonder dome. Theso remarks
were greeted wilh applause. ''
Mr. Garnet hasily rose, saying I trust
in our grave deliberations the Chair will
stop applause whether on the floor or iu
the galleries. I will give notice. Here he
was met wilh hisses from the galleries.
I now move that the galleries be cleared.
These disgraceful blackguards who violate
the rules of the House and the decorum
and dignity which are due to the represen
tatives of the people, should be forthwith
expelled from the Hall.
The Speaker said he had no doubt that
the suggestions of the gentlemen from Va.
would be sufficient for a respectful auditory
and insure quiet.
Mr. Mejris of 111., appealed to Mr. Coch
rane to refrain from further discussion on the
question. -
Mr. Cochrane resumed : I deprecate with
all others these testimonials, either of ap
probation or censure, from the galleries or
floor of this House, yet an excuse might be
found in the character of the theme before
us, which appeals to the emotions nnd feel
ings of all, however humble they may be in
the Republic. But it is eminently proper
that the rules of order be observed and
the subject discussed with the gravity its
nature demands, ana that tne American
Congress, even in the pangs of dissolution,
if it is to fall, should fall decently with its
official robes gathered around it. I bad
not intended to even allude to tbe great
principle which reposes at the base of this
question. It would be unwise and improp
er, but tbe allusions 1 nave tnade were
necessary in order that I might bring td
the intelligence and heart of tbe gentle
men from Florida considerations applica
ble to bis own patriotic nature and con
sistency, which are as common, and catholic
as is the great and glorious Republic in
which we live. ' '
I appeal to him on the grounds of com
mon humanity I appeal to him on the
peril of a common country I appeal to
him by the memories of tbe past 1 appeal
to him by the existence of the sovereign
State of Florida to. remain on tbo Com
mittee. If these appeals are to be inef
fectual, I now further appeal to those here
representing a common country, 1 ask
them, without any reflection on the gentle
men from Florida, but in pursuance of a
duty to be performed, to negative the re
quest that be be excused.
Mr. Hawkins denounced tbe previous
question on bis motion for that purpose.
Mr. Millison moved to abjourn.
Mr. Crawford appealed to Mr. Millison
to withdraw his motion so that a vote
might be taken to see whether Mr. Hawk
ins would be forced to serve, tie boped
others would ask to be excused from vo
ting.
Mr. Hawkins declared that be was not
acting under impulse, but from fi convic
tion of 20 years.
Mr. Adrian arose and Mr. Underwood
and others called him 10 order.
Mr. Adrian, amid confusion, said the
Committee ' ought to be settled to-day
Mr. Adrian was called to order from the
Southern side of the Hall.
Tbe question to adjourn was carried by

Washington Time's correspondent says
Mr. Trescott, bearer of the President's
Message to South Carolina.was also charg
ed with the duty of consulting tbe State
authorities as to their purposes after the
ordinance of secession was passed. Ho
returned last evening, and reports every

To-day the arrangement is pefected, and

Secretary Thompson will soon follow Mr.
Cobb. He entered his office to day, but
did nothing more than look over a few let

Secretary Cobb has at last resigned, but
his successor has not been nomiuated; al

One report is that Mr. Guthrie has been
named, nn another, that Mr. Holt takes the
treasuary, and Hon. L. O. B. Branch takes
the Post Office department. Still another
rumor is that Mr. Schell goes into the Cab

She intends to try it fully at all costs. No

The Democrats from the Northwest have
bad several conferences relative to the
present condition of political affairs. ' They
generally take the position set forth in
Messers. McClerlnnd and Vallandigham's
speeches yesterdy, namely, that tbe Union
connot be dissolved peaceably; that the
Norlhwest will under no circumslnnces
consent to be cut off from the Gulf of Mex
ico and the city of New York ; and that
the Government, whatever may be its faults
is of inestimable value.
The leading idea is a central govern

border slave Stales, but depending for its
consummation upon future circumstances.

Mr. Seward will make no speech imme

All rumors to the contrary are entirely un
founded. His policy is to watch the de
velopment of events, and to direct them
wisely at the proper lime for peace and
preservation of tbe Union.

adjustment, the extension of the Missouri
Compromise to the Pacific, the recognition
of the right to carry and hold slaves south

declaration that tbe power ot uongress to
regulate commerce shall not be construed
to authorize the abolition of the slave trade

that such a compromize would hold all the
Southern Slates but South Carolina, and

, The New York Worlds telegraph letter
says :
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.
In the Senate the scene after the read
mg of tbe Message was very impressive.
Seuator Clingman was listened to most at
tentively, especially by the Republicans,
and, when be concluded, the interest in
Senator Crittenden s reply seemed intense,
Mr. Critenden spoke in a low lone, but his
words rang out clearly ibrougb the cham
ber, and Soulhern members paid the strict
est attention, while the vast crowds in the
o-alleries and lobbies evidently seemed sat
fsfied, but nothing was said by the Repub
licans: which seemed to disappoint the Se
cession is ts. Senator Hale, after Senator
Clingman had finally replied, arose calmly
from his seat, and moved that the Senate
adjourn.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.
Throughout that portion of the Messagi
relating to Slavery in the Territories,
seeu the crafty hand of Jeff Davis, of Mis
sissippi. He is known to have been
communication wilh the President lately.
Leading men say they know he is the orig
inator of tbe Presidents proposition for
Slave Code.
The Message is only laughed at by
all
parlies. It raps them all over the knuckles
and then tries to pacify them. Ihe South
em Senators are particularly severe in their
criticisms, while the Democrats in the
House only ridicule it. Its contradictions
are attributed to the fact of several par
ties being engaged at diltereut times in
patching it np to suit all sides.
The New York CommerdaTs letter
says :
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.
The members from the Norlhwest are
moderate in tone, but a crisis exists. They
come with the erroneous belief that the
disappointment of the Democrats, at the
election of Lincoln, is the chief cause
the present revolutionary attitude of the
South. Were that the fact, the political
agitation would soon subside, and cease to
disturb the social, financial and political af
fairs of the country.
Senator Hamlin received the hearty con
gratulation of a huge number of Senators.
Neither Seward, Sumner or any other of
the Republicans, was in any way appa
rently avoided. Even 8onator Mason, clad
in his suit of gray Virginia homespun, ap
peared genial.
In tue House nail good humor prevailed
urintr the farce of "drawing for seats."
which resulted, as a general thing, in giv
ing the best places to those members who
never have anything to say, while such
veterans as Corwin and Tbaddens Stevens
had to take "back seata.
The South Carolinians present look
their choice and seemed anxious to have
good ones. They have also laid in their
supply of stationery, Ac, and it is to be
hoped that tbey will not seceae alter an.
Still, they declare that tbey intend to go,
and that next week.
The Cincinnati Gazette's telegrah letter
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.
In the Senate, on the motion to print
the message, a most exciting discussion en
sued, in which language of a highly inflam
matory character was used. Mr. Hale of
New Hampshire, attacked the message,
and said that Secession meant war, and
that the North was not ready to make any
concessions.
Joe Lane made a prosy speech about
the equality of the States, which he said
bad been destroyed by tbo election of Lin
coln, and then the Soulhern fire-eaters
opened their batteries. Iverson, Brown,
Wigfall, and others, enunciating the most
ultra views, and bidding defiance to the
North. The galleries were crowded, and
the interest manifested was intense.
Jeff. Davis, whose proclivities to Seces
sion are well known, felt called upon to re
buke the violent temper displayed, and
counselled moderation. Wigfall was par
ticularly severe on the message, which is
likely to find few supporters in either bouse
of Cougress. Saulsburry, of Delaware,
closed the debate in a few words expressive
of devotion of tbe Union.
He said Delaware was the first to come
into the Union, and would be the Inst to
leave it. This created great applause in
the galleries, and was responded to by
hisses. The presiding officer found it im
possible to maintain order in the galleries,
which more than once manifested their
sentiments.
The Cincinnati Inquirer telegraph letter
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.
The reason that thirty Republicans op
posed Mr. Boteler's resolution was that
they believed that it was 4 step toward a
compromise, inasmuch as it was claimed
the majority of a committee thus con
structed would be on the side of the Slave
States, whether the members from South
Carolina acted or not.
The New York Posts letter says:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.
The Republicans stand firm. Tbey are
willing to consider any proposition which
may be made in a fraternal, conciliatory
spirit, but tbey will tender no ignominious
overtures, lbey know well that there is
no plan of compromise to which they as
sert which will satisfy the disunionists.
Ihey cannot surrender the principle on
which they have gained their victory the
right and duly ot Congress to prohibit
slavery in the territories; and with the se
cessionists this concession is the indispensa
ble condition of settlement. To offer other
concessions, which would cer'ainlv be re
jected, would be rolling in the dirt for no
thing. In the Republican ranks I have
yet to find any diversity of opinion on this
point. Time and the display of quiet, un-
irratable demeanor on tbe part of the Worth
will be the most efficient agencies in dis
pelling the mania which now afflicts tbe
tbe blavehoiding blates. All the Kepub
licans from the South whom I have seen,
counsel a steady, unflinching front against
the Secessionists, aud their own section
Tbey do not believe that the nullifiers will
be pleased bv anything less than free trade
iu African negroes, as well as protection to
slave properly in the territories.
The Cincinnati CommerdaTs letter
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.
is
It is quite refreshing to hear Senator
Wade on the absorbing topic. He says
"the Republican party won its victory np
on distinct principles, openly and clearly
announced from every stump in tbe coun
try, and thoy shall not budge an inch."
He arriagns the President for general -imbecility,
upon the secession question par
ticularly. He says, "if the President de
nied the right of secession, why didn't he
hold bis tongue, and quietly transfer troops
to Charleston, where, if it should have
proved necessary, be could have used them
without disturbing tbe nation! It would
have been merely changing the soldiers'
boarding house. And if Soulh Carolina
had been inquisitive, an answer might
have been given which she would have
readily comprehended." He is bitter np
on the course of the South towards North
ern men in her jurisdiction, saying that "if
the British should hang a Yankee because
he is a Yankee, there would be war in two
hours; but the South hangs scores of men,
and they beg us to conciliate them." He
is willing to do everything that is right,
but will submit to nothing wrong, wnen
secession comes np in the Senate, "old
Ben Wade" will "talk out in meetin'."
Secessionists regard Hale's speech as
menacing, and lending Republicans, who
are inviolably true to the North, condemn
it as uncalled for and contrary to the un
derstood policy of the Republicans, which
wasquietness. They consider it a surren
der of vanlnge ground, because it affords
disunionists an opportunity to precipitate
their scemes. It is admitted Hale stated
the logical issue, but it was untimely, cre
ates bad blood and involved the people
iu gloomy forebodings. Iverson's fierce de
tlaration, under other circumstances, would
have hardly been remarked. People would
have regarded it as a bid against Cobb for
election, but the circumstances gave it ug
ly significance.
Senator Wade is dissatisfied wilb Re
publican endorsement of Boteler's resolu
tion in the House, because ho thinks, it
was a surrender of prinoiplas vindicated in
Lincoln's election. Opinions differ. The
sole object in adopting it was to please
border Stntes nnd gain time. As Hale
and Iverson have torn away all shams, we
shall have the nnked issue hereafter.
