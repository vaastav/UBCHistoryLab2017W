SATURDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1894.
An Honest Assessment Law. i
“A Baltimore Coun:y Tax-Payer,” in a
communication to the Advocate writes on an |
assessment law, taking for his text an article
from the Port Tobacco Times. The Times
alluded to the fact that two bills had been :
passed and vetoed, and says that the people
demand a fair, honest and moderate assess
ment law.
The Advocate’s correspondent does not
regard either bill that has been passed as fair,
honest or moderate, and says the only law that
could be honest and fair is one that contains
no exemptions.
This has been the Advocate* s view. Under
a law containing exemptions property is ex
empted that the law never intended should be,
and a law with no exemptions leaves no room
for hair-splitting technicalities or doubt.
Under our constitution all must pay accord
ing to their actual worth in real and personal
property. Under the administration of our
laws, supposed not to be in violation of the
organic law, fully half of the wealth ot the
state is untaxed. And the courts have sus
tained the tax laws whenever they have been
attacked.
The people of Maryland are quite unani
mous upon one point—that a new assessment
law is needed. Upon details of the law there
are wide differences among them. One class,
to which our correspondent and the Advocate
belong, would tax everything—all property,
real and personal, except state, county and
municipal buildings. Another class would
tax everything except church property, pri
vate educational institutions and those that
are regarded as charitable. Another would
add mortgages to these exemptions, and
another would exempt capital of all kinds, for
fear of driving it from the state. And then
there are the single taxers, that would tax
nothing but land.
With all this divergence of opinion, it will
l>e difficult to frame a law that will be entirely
satisfactory to the people, or one that can be
passed by the Legislature and receive exe
cutive sanction. The Hayes bill would not
have been a compliance with the constitution,
but it was a considerable improvement on the
present law. Many people sustained the Gov
ernor's veto, but the majority, probably,
wanted the Hayes bill. This desire upon the
part of many no doubt resulted from imper
fect knowledge of the provisions of the bill.
Assessment will be a leading issue next
year, and the Legislature will attempt to pass
a bill iu the winter of 18%. With all the dif
ference of opinion, among all the people, of
all classes and politics, it is likely that if a law
is passed at all, it will be a compromise meas
ure. and not in accordance with the constitu
tion. The press of the state hold divergent
views and all writers and speakers differ. The
people all agree upon the necessity for a re
valuation of property, but there the unanimity
ceases. The people will also agree that if no
new subjects of taxation are included in an
assessment bill, there is no use in having a
new assessment. If the "basis of taxation is
not to be increased and the rate decreased,
there is no use of going to the expense of re
assessing property.
President Cleveland’s Message.
President Cleveland sent his annual message
to Congress ou Monday last, promptly at its
assembling. A brief summary appears else
where in this issue, and all who would gain a
knowledge of public affairs should carefully
read it.
The message is chiefly a business document,
and presents concisely the details of govern
ment and out relations with other nations.
The recommendations by the President are
not numerous, ami the moet important relate
to finance and taxation. He still declares for
free iron and coal and the abolition of the one
eight of a cent differential duty on refined
sugar. But the part of his communication
dealing with iron, coal and sugar arc rather
disappointing. The President has not urged
these views with his accustomed vigor and
force, but rather re-states them in a perfunc
tory way. There is no insistence upon the
passage of the bills bearing upon these mat
ters, ns essential to the full measure of tariff'
revision, or as a duty the dominant party owes
under its promise to the country, or as neces
sary to the manufacturing interest in one case
and to the millions of consumers in the other.
It is true the President has before written vig
orously and strongly on these matters, and
may have considered a mere reiteration of his
views as sufficient, but that part of his message
in reference to them is somewhat disappoint
ing to those who have so steadfastly stood by
him and followed wherever he has led.
On the question of finance the President
states plainly the necessity for legislation to
protect the treasury from being depleted of
its gold reserve, and asserts that if it is not
granted he will avail himself ofthe act of 1875
to do it. He also favors a change in the hank
ing laws, and endorses the recommendations
of Secretary Carlisle, which virtually compre
hend the scheme of banking, known ns the
Baltimore plan, and which was endorsed by
the national bankers’ association at its recent
session in Baltimore.
Electricity vs. Steam.
Competition is the life of trade, and a good
illustration of it is soon to be inaugurated in
the Cumberland Valley, Pa. Because of the
competition created by the Cumberland Valley
Traction Company, the Cumberland Valley
Railroad Company have decided to run fifteen
extra trains upon the southern part of their
lino and reduce fares. The Dillsburg division
will probably be converted into an electric
road. Steam railroads everywhere are doing
their best to delay and hinder the extension
of electric railways, but the latter ire going
ahead and are dividing passenger travel with
the steam roads and greatly developing it.
Congress.
The Fifty-third Congress began its second
session last Monday. A numtar of bills and
resolutions have been introduced, but the opin
ion prevails that no legislation of importance,
tayond the passage of the regular appropria
tion bills, will be effected. In the Senate,
however, an effort is being made to change
. the rules so that a limit to debate'may be fixed,
and this would indicate that that lody, at least,
is preparing to pass some important measures.
It is not likely, however, that much will be
done until after the Christmas holiday, tayond
a consideration of appropriation bills. Several
have been completed and reported.
A Cheering Industrial Outlook.
The Philadelphia Times savs:—“The gen
eral industrial situation throughout the State
continues to improve. With the end of tariff’
agitation, brought about by the passage of the
Wilson bill, manufacturers began the work of
adapting their interests to the change in trade
conditions, and this revolution in betterments
has been going on the past few months until
the situation has become one of the best known
in ten years. Resumption in iron and steel
circles is general. In fact, there are now few
idle mills, and idle mills exist simply on ac
count of repairs.”
' A despatch says that Attorney General
Olney has ordered the District Attorney for
the Northern District of Texas to bring the
five men convicted of the murder of sheriff
Cross and his posse at the Hay Meadows, in
No Man's Land, near the Kansas border, in
1888, to trial again. This case was supposed
to have been finally settled when the Supreme
Court reversed the decision of the District
Court three years ago, and the condemned
men were released on bail. The crime was
the outcome of a county-seat war in Stevens i
county, Kansas, in which Woodsdale and <
Hngoton were rivals.
THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
A Statement of Our Foreign Helatlon*-
Reeoinmeudation* n Tariff and Fi
nancial Matter*—Cieneral Report on the
Affair* of Government.
President Cleveland submitted his annual
message to Congress last Monday, and follow
ing is a brief summary of its contents :
The President’s message to the Congress of
the United States presents iu an admiraldy
clear manner the facts and measures requiring
consideration at the hands of the national
legislature. Our foreign relations are satis
factory. The war between China and Japan
is deplored, and in new of the dangers it
brings upon Americans resident in the East
the President declares that he “would not
hesitate to heed any intimation that his friend
ly aid for the honorable termination of hos
tilities would be acceptable to both belliger
ents.” Restrictions upon the importation of
American food products into Belgium and
Germany are noted, as also the “unreason
able and unjust” fines imposed by Spain upon
American vessels trading with Cluba and
Porto Rico. Under the award of the Paris
tribunal of arbitration $425,000 has been
agreed upon as the sun to be paid as damages
to British subjects on account of seizures of ves
sels in Bering sea, and Congress is asked to ap
propriate that amount. Thus far only France
ana Portugal have assented to the regulations
agreed upon with Great Britain. With^Rus
sia a modus vivendi has taen reached in re
spect to sealing interests in the North Pacific.
Germany having protested against the pro
vision ofthe tariff act imposing a discriminat
ing duty of one-tenth oi a cent a pound on
sugars coming from countries paying an ex
port bounty thereon, claiming that such duty
is in violation of the treaty of 1828 with
Prussia, the President warmly recommends
the repeal of so much of the recent tariff act
as continues the discrimination first introduced
in the McKinley act. Such repeal, it is add
ed, is in the interests of the commerce of both
countries, and is further desirable “to avoid
even the accusation of treaty violation.
The Bluefields incident is discussed at some
length. By the treaty of 1860 Great Britain
grunted Nicaragua sovereignty over the Mos
quito Coast country, stipulating for the reten
tion by the Mosquito Indians of a limited form
of self-government. Recently Nicaragua sup
pressed the native government, attempting to
substitute for it “an impracticable composite
administration.” Ultimately, after various
conflicts, Nicaragua has established a local
government at Bluefields. The rightful sov
ereignity of Nicuragua over the Mosquito
country’is not challenged. But wrongs were
committed upon a number of American citi
zens which were the occasion of remon
strances.
Samoa is shown to be in a very disordered
state, consequent upon the faulty character
of the “entangling alliance” for its govern
ment entered into by the previous adminstra
tion. The government set up by Germany,
England and the United States, acting to
gether under the Berlin treaty, has been un
satisfactory to the natives. Civil wars are con
stantly in progress, causing much expense to
the three powers concerned. It is according
ly recommended that Congress consider the
propriety of our withdrawal from its engage
ments with the other powers on terms not
preiudical to our existing rights.
The receipts of the government from all
• sources of revenue during the fiscal year end
ed June 30, 1894, amounted to $372,802,498^-
29, and its expenditures to $442,605,758.87,
leaving a deficit of $69,803,200.58. It is esti
mated that upon the basis of the present
revenue laws the receipts of the government
during the current fiscal year ending June 30,
1895, will be 5424,427,748.44, audits expendi
tures $444,427,748.44, resulting in a deficit of
$20,000,000.
The strength of the army on September 30,
1894, was 2,135 officers and 25,765 enlisted
men. While no considerable increase in the
array is demanded by recent events, the policy
ofseacoast fortification has so far developed
as to suggest that the effective strength of the
army be now made at least equal to the legal
strength.
It is noted in the report of the Attorney-
General that the Supreme Court is overcoming
rapidly the arrears of its business and it is
suggested that Congress will do well to give
an additional circuit judge to each circuit.
The President further recommends the aboli
tion of the fee svstemasn measure of compen-
federal officers; the enlargement of
the powers of United States commissioners,
at least iu the Territories, the allowance off
writs of error in criminal cases on l>ehnlf of
the United States and the establishment of
degrees in the crime of murder.
The receipts of the Postotfice Department
during the year amounted to $75,080,479.04
and the expenditures to $84,324,414.15. This
deficiency is regarded as unnecessary, being
due to an abuse of laws regulating rales upon
second-class mail matter. If pretended news
papers, trashy novels and other publications
of like character were made to pay proper
rates, and if the free distribution of seed
through the mails were abolished, the income
tints gained would suffice, it is thought, to per
mit the carriage of legitimate papers and
periodicals free of cost.
The report of the Secretarv of the Navy
shows gratifying progress in the construction
of our new navy and presents with much
earnestness a plea for the authorization of
three additional battle-ships and ten or twelve
torpedo-taats. The President accordingly
recommends that provision be made for the
construction of additional battle-ships and
torpedo-boats, and also the manufacture of a
reserve supply of guns for the auxiliary fleet.
The transfer of the work of the coast survey
to the Navy Department is urgently recom
mended.
The report of the Secretary of the Interior
shows that the public domain still remaining
amounts to a little more than 600.000,000
acres, excluding, however, about 360,000,000
acres in Alaska, as well as military reserva
tions and railroad and other selections of
lands yet nnadjsdicated. Though the condition
ofthe Indians shows steady progress, their situ
ation is not satisfactory at all points. Some
of them to whom allotments of land have been
made are found to be unable or disinclined to
follow agricultural pursuits or to otherwise
beneficially manage their land.
At the close of the last fiscal year there were
%9,544 persons on the pension rolls, being a
net increase of 3,582 over the number report
ed at the end of the previous year. Of these
pensioners 32,089 are surviving, soldiers of
Indian and other wars prior to the late civil
war and the widows or relatives of such sol
diers. The remainder, numbering 937,505.
are receiving pensions on account of the civil
war. ami ol these 469,344 are on the rolls
under the authority of the act of June 27,
1890, sometimes called the dependent pension
law. The total amount expended for pensions
dnring the year was $139,804,461.05, and the
sum necessary to meet pension expenditures
for the vear ending June 80, 18%, is estimated
at $140*,000,000.
The Secretary of Agriculture shows that
the exports of agricultural products from the
United States for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1894, amounted to $628,363,038. being
72.28 per cent, of American exports of every
description, and the United Kingdom of Great
Britain took more than 54 per cent, of all
farm products finding foreign markets.
The advantages to the public service of an
adherence to the principles of civil-sendee
reform are constantly more apparent; and a
vast majority of the voters of the land are
ready to insist that the time and attention of
those they select to perform for them import
ant public duties should not be distracted by
doling ont minor offices. Nuinerous additional
offices and places hav3 lately been brought
within civil-service rules.
The new tariff act needs important amend
ments so as to lie executed effectively and with
certainty. In addition to such necessary
amendments ns will not change rates of duty,
the President still very decidedly favors putt
ing coal and iron upon the free list. As
regards the sugar schedule, he would be glad,
“under existing aggravations,” to see every
particle of differential duty in favor of refined
sugar stricken out of the tariff law.
Legislation is recommended calculated to
promote the development of our merchant
marine. To this end the new tariff should be
supplemented by an act allowing vessels built
abroad and owned by Americans to be regis
tered here.
Much space is given to a discussion of the
decrease of the gold reserve and the necessity
of a bond issue to repair the fund designed to
keep all forms of money at par with gold. It
is declared roundly that the issne of bonds
will be continued “whenever and as often*’
as it is necessary to maintain a sufficient gold
reserve. The currency question is declared to
need the prompt attention of Congress, and a
plan for the creation of a more elastic cur
rency is presented and approved. The plan
embraces a scheme modifying present banking
laws and providing for the issue of circulating
notes by State hanks free from taxation under
certain limitations.
It is proposed to repeal all laws providing
for the deposit of United States bonds as se
curity for circulation; to permit national tanks
to issue circulating notes not exceeding in
amount 75 per cent, of their paid-up and un
impaired capital, provided they deposit with
the government as a guarantee fund in United
States legal-tender notes, including treasury
notes of 1890, a sum equal in amount to 30 per
cent, of the notes they desire to issue.
In addition to the guarantee fund required
it is proposed to provide a safety fond for the
immediate redemption of the circulating notes
of failed banks, by imposing a small annual
tox, say one-half of 1 per cent., upon the
average circulation of each bank until the j
fund amounts to 5 per cent, of the total circa- )
lation outstanding. As a further security it |
is contemplated that the existing provision |
fixing the individual liability of stockholders j
is to be retained and the bank’s indebtedness j
ou account of its circulating notes is to be
made a first lien on nil its assets.
A very important feature of this plan is the
exemption of State banks from taxation by
the United States in cases where it is shown
to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the
Treasury ami comptroller of the currency by
tanks claiming such exemption that they have
not had outstanding their circulating notes
exceeding 75 per cent, of their paid up and
unimpaired capital: that their stockholders
are individually liable for the redemption of
their circulating notes to the full extent of
their ownership of stock; that the liability of
said banks upon their circulating notes consti
tutes, under their State law. a first lien upon
their assets; that such banks have kept and
maintained a guarantee fund in Unted Slates
legal-tender notes, including treasury notes of
1890, equal to 30 per cent, of their outstand
ing circulating notes, and that such banks
have promptly redeemed their circulating
notes when presented at their principal or
branch offices.
Governor Brown’s Popularity.
The Centreville Observer, Queen Anne's
county, ( Democratic ) soys : “Governor
Brown has made some mistakes, as almost
any man would do, but all in all he has given
the State a good administration. His course
has been upright, his administration a business
one and economical. .He has prevented much
ofthe waste of public money which sometimes
attend administrations, and he has placed the
State institutions in excellent shape. Even
head of an institution in the State has been
looked after, and the Governor has seen to it
personally that proper rules and regulations
are adopted and observed in their manage
ment. He has made some enemies, of course,
as all men will do who have positive rather
than negative lives, but no man ought to be
afraid of the enemies he makes when he is
doing right. They cannot harm him ranch,
but. on the contrary, their very enmity would
be so hollow and ridiculous as to make friends
for the man they hate. That Governor Brown
may prefer to retire to private life and look
after the large financial interests he has in
' charge is likely true, but we are not prepared
to agree with the Governor that his retirement
from office is made necessary by any public
demand nor from the apprehension that the
people would refuse him a re-election if nomi
nated.

WESTMINSTER, MD.
Our Holiday Goods have arrived and still
more are coming daily, and now we find that
we haven’t room enough to honse them all.
What can we do but make room for them ?
and that is to sacrifice one article in order to
justify the other to come in. To make a start
we selected onr Cloak Room first. Here we
shall make it lively for everybody. We are
going to sell every garment at exactly Cost
Price and when the 25th day of December
arrives we shall not see a coat of any kind on
the rack; every one must go. But we are not
going to stop here; we have made the start and
must go on to every other department, and
* we shall make a reduction of at least 10 to 20
per cent, on every article. Don't put off
your day for purchasing, but come right away
and secure first choice. Your gain is onr loss.
