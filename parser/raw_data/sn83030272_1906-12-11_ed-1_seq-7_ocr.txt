that they were the best fitted men in Montclair

Tho public library was erected at a costmore
more than twice an great as that of thochurch
church and the results were used to vindicate
cate Mr Grants contention that privateenterprise
enterprise is superior to the best intentionsof
of a public officialHero
Her is a public plant said he thepublio
public library in which there is no machineryno I
no complicated equipment with the simplest
vilest problems of construction Yet hadIt
It not been for the accidental knowledgeof Iof
of some of the members of the board thepublio
public library would have been as InefficientIn
In Interior arrangements as it is anachronistic

On the other hand the church next doorput
put up a building almost perfect in interiorarrangements

beauty This result was attained at leesthan
than half the cost of the public libraryIn
In spite of the denial of thoroughgoingSocialists
Socialists thn ownership and operation bycities

it substitutes collectivism for private enterprise

of this Increased costInferiority
Inferiority of service he said is duechiefly
chiefly to the collecting of municipal employees
