COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE
In Presenting the Resolution, Con?
gressman Perkins Said Statements
By the President Could Not Bo
Lightly Disregarded?Mr. Roosevelt
Getting Ready to "Come Back" With
a Broadside of His Heaviest Cunt.
Washington, Deft 12.?Resolutions
which in themselves arc a criticism
?>f President Roosevelt were passe?!
without dissent hy the house They
appointed a committee of five In con
Rider several stnt?-ments made- l.v th?'
chief executive In his annual nvssage
to congress, which representatives
think olije? tionuMe and one stat ment
with which the house takes Issue.
infinite reference Is made to that
part ?>f the president's message which
suggested that the reason congress
knocked out the employment of si? r?t
service men by the treasury ???-part
ment was because members of < >>n
gress did not want themselves inves?
tigated.
The resolutions were presented to
the hous* by Mr Perkins, of New
York, and were adopted without divi?
sion. The followlug committee was ap?
pointed to consider the alleged qu?*s.
tlonable statements: Messrs. Perkins,
of New York; Denhy. of Michigan;
Weeks, of Massachusetts; Williams,
of Mississippi, ami I.loyd, of Missouri.
The Resolutions.
These are tho resolutions as they
passed the house:
' Whereas. There was contaim-d In
the sundry civil appropriation bill,
which passed congress at Its last ses?
sion and became a law. a provision Jn
reference to the employment of the?
secret service in the treasury d-part
rnent; and.
'Whereas. In the message of the
president of the United States to ih?
two houses of congress it was ftated
in r-.fertnee to that provision, it Is
not too much to say that this amend?
ment bas been of benefit only, and
could be of beneilt only, to the crlml
nal classes,' and It was further stated.
'The chief argument In favor of the
provision was that the congressmen
did not themselves wish to be lnvestl
kr:tt'l by secret service men.' and It
was further stated, but If this is not
considered desirable, a special excep?
tion should be made in the law pro?
hibiting the use of the secret service
force in investigating members of con
gress. It would be far better to do
this than to do what was actually done
and strive to prevent or at least to
hamper effective action against crimi?
nals by the? executive branch of the
government. Now, therefore, be It
"Resolved, That a committee of five
members of this house be appointed
by the speaker to consider the state?
ments contained in the message of the
president and report to the house what
action, if any. should be taken in refer
ence thereto."
in submitting the resolution. Mr.
Perkins said that the statements by
the president could not be lightly dis?
regarded, as they might Impair the
usefulness of the congress, that undue
obtuseness might argue a lack of
proper self-respect.
President May Return Broadside.
The president is keenly alive to the
purpose of the men in the house and
senate to "rebuke" him and he is get?
ting ready to return a broadside of
his heaviest guns.
To this end he is diligently accumu?
lating a mass of material which will
nerve as ammunition for a bombard?
ment of congress should any affront
be given to him through any action It
may take. If he should be forced to
take this step the result would be
most sensational, and the conse?
quences to mor? than one member of
congress might prove disastrous.

From an edition of the Frederk-ksburg

7th, 1818, and owned by a gentleman in
Richmond, the following advertisement
wa* takeo:
VALUABLE PROPERTY FOR SALE
1 wish to sell tbe Eagle Tavern and
lot pleasantly situated In the upper part
of the town of Fredericksburg, now In
the occupancy of Richard I. Tutt, to?
gether with tbe tenements occupied by
John Blanton, George Baggott and
Captain Alexander, adjoining the rame,
it 1? deemed unnecessary to be more min?
ute In tbe description of tbe above lot?,
not doubting but any person disposed to
purchase will first view them.
John Wallace,
ectf.
Stafford county, Nov. 7, IfflS,
A logical conclusion from thl? adver?
tisement 1* that In 1818, thirty-five
year* after tbe Revolution, thl* then
operated hotel wa* generally known to
the public as tbe Eagle Tavern. About
ten year* alter tbi? date It ceased to b*
kept sa a hotel, which Indicates that tbe
Rising Sun, If It existed, wa* a different
building. The Oriental name U per?
chance tb* delusive offspring of historic
myth or confused nomenclature. It may
have been a smaller or more retired Inn
once standing rearby.
8-iorr after the date ol tbe above ad?
vertisement John Wallace conveyed this
proper ,y to hi* ?on. Dr. John H. Wal?
lace, ol Fretlerlcksbu g, who wa? bprn In
1798, and It* last owner a* an operated
hotel. Dr. Wallace called It the Old
Eagle, which Implied that tbe name was
In hi* day time-honored and long identi?
fied with the building.
Th? late Gustavus B. Wallace, of Staf
ford, a son of John Wallace, wa* familiar
with It* name and traditional history
and state! a* an additional evidence of U?
being tbe Eagle Tavern that he recol?
lected when an eagle stood upon It* top.
It bas not been operated a* a hotel for
three-quarters of a century, and If other*
have ?lues been established by tbe
same name, what doei that signify sx
cept a? an evident** of It* former prestige
We meet with pleasure upon the
streets of Frederk-ksburg those names in
honor of Georgs Washington and Robt.

tbe more modern Eagle, a* well as the
