Run was the scene of another riot yester
day morning between striking coal ininevs
and men working at reduced wages. About

LAW DEPARTMENT.
VThat the Attorney General Has to Say
About Hi Hepartment-
Washtxgtox, Dectmber 10. TIih annual
report to Congress of Attorney General
Garland elves a detailed succinct statement
of the operations of that department
i throughout the country during the past
year, including the business of the Supreme
! Court, the Court of Claims, and the Court
of Commissioners of Alabama Claims.
I During the year 1.65S civil suits and 11,977
t criminal prosecutions were terminated iu
i the various United States Courts, leaving
2,140 of the former class and S.80S of the
' latter class pending at tho close of the year.
' The aggregate amount of judgments ren
dered in favor of the United States in civil
suits during the year was S677.SS3, and the
amount actually collected on these judg
ments was S70.457; while S37.02S was ob-
, tained during tho year on judgments as (
, rendered in former years for the United
States, and SU-M52 was othenviso realized
I in civil suits. The aggrezate amount of
I fines, forfeitures and penalties imposed dur-
j ing the year in criminal prosecutions was j
i S4S1.75G, and tho amount of these fines.
forfeitures and penalties collected during
the year was S02,12-, while SC,187 was
I realized on fines, forfeitures and penalties
( imposed in former vears. The aggre-
ate amount of court expenses paui dur
ing the year was S2,S74,733. The Attor
ney General suggested the advisability of
building jails at each place in the country
where the United States courts are held.
The necessity of building a Government
ppnitentiary, where all persons convicted
of United States offenses could be con- j
fined, is strongly urged. "Such convicts,"
he says, "could be employed in tho maim-!
facture of supplies exclusively -for the Gov-
eminent, which work would assist in mak- I
ing the institution self-sustaining." Ue J
also suggests the propriety of erecting on
the grounds adjoining the Department of
Justice a proper building for the accommo- j
dation, in addition to the department of the
Supreme Court and other proper courts and
commissions of the United States. The t
Attorney General makes a number of other
recommendations, among which are the fol- j
lowing: That the fees of Marshals in
Montana, Idaho and "Wyoming be doubled;
that the salaries of Marshals bo revised;
that the compensation of the United '
States Attorney for 2s'ew Mexico and Arizo
na be
increased and that the compensa-
tion of clerks of the United states
'-""'w
in California be reduced; that attorneys
and marshals be required to make '
returns by fiscal instead of cal-1
endur years; that the accounts of chief '
supervisors of elections be taxed m open
i court under the instructions of the District
more severe; that increased provisions be ,
made for the protection of United States
witnesses and that a suitable United States '
jail bo built at Fort Smith, Ark. The re-,
p-irt closes with a brief statement of the
Union r.icitic Railway litigation and says
that a motion will be filcdToy the Govern
ment in the Supreme Court in a few days
to advance the appeals iu the dockets so as
have a speedy determination of them. The
Attorney General adds that the motion will
doubtless be granted and the matter be dis
posed of an early dale.

EXPLOSIONS.
The Kansas City Unit Works Totally
Wrecked Gas explosion In Pennsylvania.
Kansas City, Mo., December 10. At
1:10 o'clock yesterday morning a terrible
explosion occurred at the works of the Kan
sas City Gas Light and Coke Company,
corner of First and Campbell streets, on
the East levee. The shock was plainly
felt in all parts of the city. Windows were
broken and doors wrenchod from theii
iiinires blocks away from the scene of the
disaster. The explosion occurred in the
purifying huuso and was heard for miles
around, houses fifteen or twenty blocks
away being rocueil as by an earthquake.
The shock and terrible report created the
greatest excitement in the city. Although
the hour Was late and the night very dark
and stormy, people turned out hurriedly
iu all .sorts of costumes. Many thought
that an earthquake had occurred, while
others declared that a dynamite explosion
of the most dating and gigantic character
had taken place. As soon as tins alarm
sounded all the uptown fire companies
rushed to the scene of tho disaster, and in
very few moments a large force of fire
men.' policemen, gas house employes and
others were ac work on the piles
of broken brick and splintered tim
ber to get at the wounded
if any had been engulfed in the ruins. A
large crowd had already gathered about the
works, and both the night shift at the
works and those of the day shift who lived
near and who had turned out in all sorts nf
hurriedly donned costumes, were already at
work like heroes. Several streams of water
were turned on tlio blazing ruins. The
workmen were called together and
counted, and it was found that all of the
night force could be accounted for except the
engineer, Julius W. Slosson. Soon groans
were heard issuing from a pile of brick and

hopes are entertained of his recov-1

and the loss is variously estimated at '
from S100.000 to S150.000. The officers of j
the Gas Company feel positive that it was ;
not a uas explosion, but the resuit of dyna

CANONsnuKO, Pa., December 10. Yes
terday morning at four o'clock an explosion
nf natural gas occurred at the residence of
Wesley Greer, on Main street, wrecking the
entire building and hurling the occupants
from their beds into the lot surrounding the
house, thirty feet away. The force of the
concussion was so terrific that the roof was
lifted from the house and carried a hun
dred yards. The sides of the building
bulged out and then fell. Immediately
after fragments ot the structure caught
fire, and iu less than an hour
the whole was in ashe. Mr.
Greer, his wife and two children, a babo
and a boy four years old, were sleeping
soundly at the time. They were lifted with
the flying debris, bed and all, and landed
in the yard, but none were fatally injured.

It is a good plan to milk cows regularly
in the same order, taking the same one
"tand winding up with the same one
every time. Regularity of hour in com
mencing the milking of the herd is an ad
vantage in securing the best results, since
animals, as well as men, are greatly tho
creatures of habit, and when the time
comes around, the cow will desire to bo
milked, and all the functions of the sys
tem will concur in this desire. Indiana

For Cow Itch: Keep animals out in
cool, clear air, and in well ventilated
buildings in bad weather. Give nourish
ing food and avoid crowding; oil the whole
surface of tho body with raw linseed oil,
and a few iiirs later wash clean, breaking
all the scui-i or scales. Then take eight
pounds of tobacco, boil thoroughly, strain
it and set aside; take one pint of oil of tar,
one-half pound of pure carbolic acid, two
pounds ot soft soap and dissolve in boiling;
water, add this to the tobacco decoction
and add water to make a mixture of 25
gallons. If this is too much for number of
cows make half the quantity; apply with a
brush. It might be well to give from one
half to one pound of epsom salts to each
animal. Dr. Paqiiin, in Kansas City Indi
