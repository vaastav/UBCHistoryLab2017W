Senators and Congressmen of
the West Preparing to Push
Irrigation Bill.
Caucus Held and Outline of the
Bill Gone Over—Commit
tee Appointed.
A Bill Will Be Framed and In
troduced at an Early
Day.
Washington, Dec. 5.—The effect of a
caucus held in the committee room of
Senator Warren, between the members
and senators Interested in irrigation
legislation, is believed to have been ben
eficial. A long step has been taken
toward a definite line of action. While
it has been freely predicted that the ir
rigation people would not be able to
reach any line of agreement, it was
found that there was not the divergence
of.opinion that it is generally believed
existed. The Newlands bill, which pro
vides for the use of the funds received
by the government from the sale of pub
lic lands, was made the basis for ail dis
cussion.
The definite outcome of the caucus
was the selection of a committee repre
senting the different states interested in
irrigation project?. This committee will
shape a bill and make recommenda
tions at a further caucus, which is to be
held next Thursday. The states repre
sented in the caucus included Oregon,
Washington, Utah, Nevada, Wyoming,
South Dakota, Idaho, Kansas, Nebras
ka, Colorado, New Mexico and Montana.
The caucus was the direct outgrowth
of the sentiment which developed at the
irrigation meetlug held at Cheyenne last
summer. The committee appointed to
draft a bill is composed of Senators
Butron, of Kansas Bard, of California
Kearns, of Utah Gibson, of Montana
Warren, of Wyoming Deltrich, of Ne
braska Hansbrough, of North Dakota
Duboius, of Idaho, and Congressmen
Jones, of Oregon Newlands, of Nevada
Tongue, of Washington Shafroth, of
Colorado Martin, of South Dakota
Mondell, of Wyoming, and Delegates
Flynn, of Oklahoma Rodey, of New
Mexico, and Smith, of Arizona.
In advance of their framing the bill
their statements as to what will be the
final caucus action are guarded. It is
believed, however, that the bill, when
framed, will be one providing for a sur
vey, with a view to the inauguration of
an extensive system of irrigation, which
will eventually contemplate the expend
iture of more than 1500,000,000. It is not
the intention to ask for legislation look
ing to any such expenditure by the na
tional .government. Instead a survey
will be asked. Later the government
will be asked to construct reservoirs at
the headwaters of the different streams.
After the construction work is com
pleted the bill to be framed will con
template state control of the distribu
tion of water, Some provision will be
made for handling the necessary inter
state questions. Tfie feature of the'
Newlands bill, which provides for the
creation of a fund for irrigation pur
poses from the sale of public lands, will

GOVERNMENT FAIR EXHIBIT.
Managers Believe. $60,000 Additional
8hould Be Asked for the Building.
Washington, Dec. 5.—Members of the
government board for the St. Louis
Fair say that they have received no
intimation that they will be expected to
prepare an estimate as to the amount
which should be atoked from congress
for the extension and enlargement of
the government building at the fair
and for a government exhibit. They do
not believe that such an estimate
should come from them. They have
canvassed the matter privately among
themselves, and believe that with $50,
000 additional for the building it can
be made the finest the government has
ever had at a fair. They have also
concluded that for a government ex
hibit $690,000 will provide an exhibit
superior proportionately.
Mr. Hills, one of the active members
of the board, who will have charge of
the treasury department exhibit, says
that with an allotment of funds but
little in excess of what he had at the
Buffalo fair, he can make a better ex
hibit than the treasury department
has ever had. He has some new,
unique and original Ideas as to the ar
rangement of the exhibit along artistic
lines. He says that the marine hospi
tal service will have an exhtblt which
will be much more interesting and bet
ter than ever before. In this he will
have the hearty co-operation of Dr.
Wyman, head of the service, a former,
St Louisan. He does not wish to dis
count his original ideas of publicity,
but gives some idea of what he Intends
to do by stating that instead of having
the model wards and operating rooms
unpeopled, he will have them supplied
with nurses and doctors and will have
mechanical figures for patients.
FEAR AMERICAN TRADE.
Discussion of German Tariff Growing
Warm at Berlin.
Berlin, Dec. 5.—During the course of
the tariff debate in the refohstag yes
terday Mr. Paache, of Halle University,
sounded the strongest warning concern
ing the "American peril" which has yet
been uttered. Dr. Paache visited the
United StatM in 1819 to study the so
cial and industrial conditions there.
Since bis return he has been lecturing
and the ohanged balance of the world's
trade wrought by the dominating
growth of the United States. During
bis address the speaker laid before the
house mosses of figures which set forth
the expansion of the American manu
factures and of American foreign com
merce of recent years, and the enormouB
aocuihulation of wealth in the United
States.
He accompanied his statistics with a
philosophical analysis tgipporting the
idea that Germany's most dangerous
and most immediate trade enemy was
the United States. Sr. Paache said:
"Peculiarly grave dangers threaten us
from America. Against these we must
put ourselveB in a slate of'defense." Dr.
Paache was particularly Impressed by
the rapid growth of t'he cotton goods
trade in 'the United States, which he
said now dominated the markets of the
world.
Regarding the paragraph in President
Roosevelt's message concerning reci
procity, Dr. Paache said1: "America
makes a feint of adopting a policy of
more liberal commercial treaties, but
she is determined to abandon nothing of
her protective system. What would it
profit us if we got a slight reduction of
duties wliich are now absolutely pro
hibitive? In spite of this, our treaties
say we do not dare to raise our duties.
The Yankee has not a trace of such
sentimental politics."
The oration was sustained with a
mountainous array of documents, such
as are peculiarly grateful to the Ger
man mind. It was evident that Dr.
Paache's speech Impressed the members
of the reichstag.
Herr Gotheln, secretary of the cham
ber of commerce of Breslau. and a free
trader, who was recently elected to the
reichstag from a strong agricultural
district, warned tho reichstag against
adopting defensive legislation directed
at the United States, as Dr. Paache de
manded. Herr Gotheln referred to the
chances of the trade relations between
Germany and the United States, adding
what he said Count van Posadowsky
Wehner, secretary of the interior, had
forgotten to say yesterday, when he
took up the cudgels in defense of the
bill, that "our exports last year to the
United States were larger than those of
tiny previous year. Many people In
Germany demand a tariff war on the
United States, especially the iron men,
who complain of the United States high
duties. While we should not try to
avoid a tariff war under all circum
stances, still let us not play with the
Idea that such avoidance would be un
patriotic."
AMERICA AS A MODEL.
Debate on Tariff Bill in the German
Reichstag.
Berlin, Dec, 4.—The debate on the
new tariff bill was resumed in Reich
atag yesterday, Count von Posadowsky
Wehner, Imperial secretary of state for
uhe interior' quoted the United States
as an example to be followed In the
matter of tariffs. His reference to the
opponents of the tariff as wanting in
sense and national pride caused an up
roar among the members of the left
Count von Posadowsky claimed that
the present tariff scheme was compara
tively simple. It contained 387 sec
tions, compared with 654 in France's
scheme and 740 In the United States
ariff. The object aimed at was not to
admit foreign goods too easily, but .yet
not to legislate so as to cause prohib
itive duties against foreign countries.
It was a mistake to suppose that the
tariff of the United States was directed
solely against Germany. It was di
rected against the entire world. He
pleaded strongly the cause of the agri
culturists and expressed the firm in
tention of the government of making
fresh commercial treaties.
Count von Bulow, replying to thg
criticisms of the Leftists, said he wish
ed that there should be no mistake re
garding the government attitude to
wards the commercial treaties. They
considered the renewal of the treaties
of long duration to be most desirable,
but Germany purposed arranging them
on a basis satisfactory to herself.
The Interests of other nations would
be met In a spirit of reclproctiy and
fair dealing, but Germany was in a po
sition to give effect to her wishes with
the same emphasis aB other countries.
She need show no more difference than
they.
As for the ntterances of the foreign
press, the government woud not be
driver a hair's breadth from the path
marked out, nor suiter dictation con
cerning Germany's rights and interests.
FEDERATION OF LABOR.
Annual Convention Will Open at Scran
ton Today.
Scranton, Pa., Dec. 5.—Last night the
hotel corridors, especially that of the
Jermyn, where the headquarters Is lo
cated, were crowded with delegates
I from all over the United States and
1
Canada to the American Federation of
Labor, which will open here today. The
Pacific coast delegation, headed by John
T. Morgan, of Portland, to fighting for
the re-enactment of the Chinese exclu
sion laws, with amendments to make its
provision* apply to all Mongolians and
its operation unlimited as to years. Del-,
egates from the ship building trades are
making a vigorous campaign for a de
mand from the federation that the gov
ernment build Its own ships, and not let
out the contracts to private parties, who
pay leas wages and exact more labor
than does the government.
Almost every delegate is taking an ac
tive interest in the trades autonomy
matter, and of all things to come before
the convention it promises to provoke
the most discussion. The miners and
stationary engineers and firemen are at
war over the Jurisdiction of engineers
and firemen at collieries the brewery
workers and teamsters are in conflict
ever the divers of brewey wagons the
wood workers and carpenters propose to
thresh out their longstanding feud about
the julsdlctlon over men employed in
carpenter shops, and the typos and ma
chinists are disputing over linotype ma
chinists, and so on.
Black and white delegates in the to
bacco trade are here from Richmond,
Va., and will force the federation to de
clare Itself on the color line.
The resolutions submitted for the con
vention's consideration number nineteen
in all. In addition to several on adher
ence to strict trade autonomy and one
on Chinese exclusion, they declare for
the creating of a defense fund by levy
ing a 10 cent per capita tax against ten
ement and home work among tailors,
against the "Progressive Cigaret Mak
ers' independent label, for boycott on
the tobacco and bakery trusts, and other
alleged unfair institutions, for an eight
hour day for postofflce clerks, for obli
gating of members to demand the union
label on everything manufactured by
union hands, against any loca] declaring
a boycott until tho central body ap
proves it, for the proportional preferen

of a committee to induce the masons

London, Dec. 5.—Lord Hobhouse, the
uncle of Miss Hobhouse, who visited
South Africa and made some sharp
comments on the conditions in the con
centration camps, and who was deport
ed on her recent return to South Africa,
has placed the case of his niece in the

DREYFUS CASE AGAIN.
Facts Coming to Light That May Cause
France More Trouble.
Paris, Dec. 5.—The latest develop
ments in the Dreyfus affairs aril at
tracting notice. The persons interested
on either side appear to be seeking to
call attention to their personalities.
Cross accusations and hintB that they
are able to make serious disclosures are
being made. While they do not affect
the question of the innocence of Drey
fus, they shed interesting light on tho
subsequent relations of Dreyfus, Reln
ach, Laborl, Picquart and other Drey
fusards. Relnach's withdrawal of his
brief from M. Labor! in the shit brought
against the former by Mme. Henry was
the first development which drew atten
tion to the rupture between them.
Labor!, about the same time, pub
lished an article in the Grande Revue,
which he edited, on the political situa
tion, in which he pointed out that the
Dreyfus affair was closed by the fact
that Dreyfus had accepted a pardon. In
acquiescing to this settlement and In
accepting amnesty, Laborl considered
that Dreyfus' friends had removed the
question from a high moral plane into
one of pure personality, and. that the
Dreyfus question had ceased to be hu
man and universal.
These declarations Indicated a rupture
between Laborl and Dreyfus. The na
tionalist Echo de Paris published an
Interview with a friend of Relnach, and
of the Dreyfus family, who said that
Relnach withdrew the brief because his
friend. Comely, who represented his
views, had been removed from the posi
tion of political leader writer on La
borl's promise to retain him, given him
when Relnach financially supported the
review.
The Informant of the Interviewer also
asserted that Laborl was furious be
cause Dreyfus did not remain in prison,
and. from there, continue to prosecute
the work of his rehabilitation. The In
terviewer remarked that Laborl had
sacrificed his reputation and practice
for Dreyfus, and his Informant replied:
"But, Maltre Labor! did not live forev
er on the Dreyfus affair, and the family
acted very well toward h!m in every re
spect"
Continuing, the Informant of the In
terviewer said Picquart was led astray
by Laborl in withdrawing his appeal to
the council of state, and In refusing to
re-enter the army, evep if the decision
was in his favor. The newspaper man's
informant then added:
"We do not comprehend Picquart's at
titude, or his anti-Semitism, which te
notorious. Dreyfus, when he was re
leased, wrote to him expressing warm
thanks for his devotion, and asked for
an interview to enable him to express
hiy thanks personally. Picquart pent a
cool reply, saying that he would let him
know when he could receive him, and
Dreyfus has heard nothing from him
since."
These statements caused interviewers
to flock to the residence of Labor! and
Relnach, to seek further statements on
the subject, but they both refused to
discuss it, Reinach alone remarking that
for his part the Dreyfus affair was
closed.
Lost Girl Is Found.
Wilson, N. C., Dec. 5.—A young couple
giving their names as Mr. and Mrs. Mc
Kay Durham are held by the authori
ties on the theory that Mrs. Durham is
the missing Miss Cropsey from Eliza
beth City, N. C.
A Miss Tyer, attending school here
and who was a playmate of Miss Crop
sey, testified that "Tho for four years
she had not seen Miss Cropsey, the girl
In custody resembled her." Miss Tyer
did not at once reoognlze her, but wai
sure the woman was Miss Cropsey.
Before the authorities yesterday af
ternoon the woman said she was a Miss
Kersey and was raised on a truck farm
near Chattanooga, Tenn., and that her
mother was married the second time,
now bearing the name of Mrs. Elizabeth
Clark.
She will be held in custody until per
sons arrive from Elizabeth City to
Identify her.
The alleged Miss Cropsey Bays she has
only been married a few days, and to
be deeply distressed. She appears to be
about 17 years of age, Is good locking,
and lias an intelligent face. While be
ing questioned she stated many things
contradictory -to Durham's statement!*.
She gave her home as Raleigh and
Chattanooga. The young woman denies
having been to Speed or Washington,
but states that they have been to New
born, Plymouth and Bath.
Friends Doubt Value of Clue.
Elizabeth City, N. C., Dec. 5.—It is be
lieved here tha/t the woman arrested at
Wilson, N. C., and partially Identified as
Miss Nellie Cropsey, is the same who,
with her companion, was examined at
Speed, N. C., by an agent of Chief of
Police Dawson several days ago and
found not to be Miss Cropsey, tho re
sembling her In a general way.
No clew of value has yet been, found,
and the strange case Is practically In
the s«rm« position it was the day after
the girl disappeared. Last night Chief
of Police Dawson receivea a telegram
from Wilson, N. C., giving a description
of the woman who was arrested there,
which does not all answer to Nellie
Cropsey's description.
