First: That we shall not, at this late day. endeavor I e
to increase our trade by substituting- a Selected Stock t
f?r * PoorStok, which we have at all times, by our :
thorough knowledge of the business, been able to cast ^
asiue, and allowed others less fortunate to become ' H
owners thereof.
Second : That in the future, as in the past, our cu.to- !
iners shall have the whole of this advantage and be ' >
?U>plied with merchantable and well-seasoned LUM- ! a
BER, which we always have on hand in larse and small ?
Quantities. u
Third^That our connections with a number of mills, fe
both in Virginia, North Carolina, Geoiyla and Florida, J
enables us to cut especially to order, with dispatch, bills S
of any size used in thia market, at the lowest possible ^
figures. s
That should you want any kind of HARDWOODS.

Colli Comfort for Office St'cken.
democratic president and republican senate.
In democratic circles there Is undoubtedly a feeing
of anxiety as to the probable course of the republican
majority in the next Senate. If the republicans
unite to protect federal office-holders
inder the tenure-of-office act,there will be but rew
hanges during the next two years at least. Such
course would limit the appointments of the demorat
1c President to the number of commissioned
flic! als whose terms expire under his administralonand
to the filling of vacancies as they occur from
eatii. resignation, and other causes. He will not
? able to make any removals, except, with the
ssent of the senate, so that democratic aspirants
or offices must run the gauntlet or a republican
enate even after securing a nomination.

The Interior Department Uuildine:.
he progress made in the woke of reconstruction.
The Secretary of the Interior, In his annual retort,
makes the following recommendations in reard
to the reconstruction of the department bulking:
The work of reconstructing ihe south wing of
he building occupied by the Interior department
ias steadily progressed, and will probably be competed
within the next four months. The addllonal
room which will then be available can be
ccupled in part by the clerical force of the departs
oent, and In a measure relieve some of the offices
vhlch are now seriously overcrowded. It was estlnated
that the sum of $151,000 would be required
0 complete the reconstruction of this wing, and
hat the sum or $18,000 would be necessary for sup>lylng
a new heating apparatus. The first amount
vas appropriated In ruil, but in place ot the second
imount only $2,000 was provided. In the course of
he work the heating apparatus was found to be so
corroded as to be beyond the possibility or a mere
epalr; this, together with the increase In the cost
>f labor during the past season, has made it impossible
to keep within the appropriation, and, in order
;o complete the work thoroughly, a deficiency of
;18,849 remains to be provided for, the urgency of
vhlch should receive the early attention of Congress.
This being provided lor, the south wing will
lot only be soon completed, but the galleries will
>e nearly all furnished with wrought-iron model
:ases, and with an appropriation ot $7,000 the addilonai
model cases which will be necessary can be
provided. After the completion of the south wing
-he fire proof reconstruction of this building should
se continued by extending the work ovet the east
vlng. and lor this an estimate has been laid before
-'ongresri.
The Pacific Railroad* Debt*
3xmocratic opposition to the funding scheme?
a problem for conor ess to solve.
The recommendation of the Secretary- of the In;erior,
in his report, in relation to funding the debt
)f the Pacific railroads has directed the attention
>f Congressmen to that subject. Already there 13 a
vide difference of opinion expressed as to what
ihould be done. At the last session Mr. Garland,
torn the Senate Judiciary committee, reported a
)ill similar In its provisions to the plan suggested
>y Secretary Teller, but owing to the press of buslless
and hurried adjournment. It was not taken up.
unong members or the House there is a manifest
lisposition to stand by the Thompson bill, which
>assed the House last session, but was not taken
ip in the Senate. That bill Is rigid in Its provisions,
t Is, in fact, supplemental to the Thurman act,
md requires the enforcement of the latter. Some
if the democratic mem iters say the House cannot
ifford to approve any compromise with the Pacific
ailroafls, and they regard Secretary Teller's plan
is a compromise. These democrats say their party
n the late campaign pledged Itself to compel the
^aclllc roaus to sei He up, and that democratic Conrrcssmen
cannot afford to vote lor any compromise.
1 his opinion is shared by some of the democratic
senators, and, therefore, it Is not certain that the
>lan to refund the railroad bonds can pass the
lenate. But If It should, promluent members of
he House believe that the latter body would reject

eglslature, but a strong effort will be made to reject
Senator Logan to the United States Senate.
Representative Davis, of Chicago, believes that
i,ogan will be re-elected. He say.*, there Is a good
leal of sy mpathy for him, and he thinks that some
iemoeratlc member of the legislature, purely out
)t sympathy, will absent himself aud permit the
epubilcans to elect Logan. Should the legislature,
however, get in a dead lo-k and fall to elect,
t Is understood that the governor will appoint
ien. Logan.

A telegram from Danville, Pa., says that Frank
Lewis and Jacob Gearhart, workingmen of that
Jlace, who were out of employment, went, a few
lays ago. to an uninhabited Island in the Susquolanna
river, three miles below Danville, to dig for
oots. They had not dug long when they came
ipon a metal box. Eagerly breaking It open with
their picks they round it contained coins amounting
nearly to (17.000, Including $16,000 In Mexican
diver dollars, $30,000 in gold doubloons and $1,000
n small silver coins, which will ueed some polishing
to make them passable. The general supposition
Is that the money was placed there by Capt.
Kldd during the sixteenth century. He was at one
[ime hard pressed on the Chesapeake bay by other
pirates, entered the Susquehanna river and sailed ,
up to Crook's Rifles, which at that time formed
part of the Island.
Peter lleyden, formerly treasurer of the Oklahoma
society, of Kansas City, states that the
death of capt. Payne, chough a matter for sorrow
among his co-workers, will not interrupt the pro{rew
of the colonization scheme.

Ceremonies.
Mr. W. Pierce Bell, who Has returned to the city
from a professional trip la New York state, while
away pal l a visit to Gov. Cleveland in Albany,
having gone to Albany ror that purpose with Senator
Gorman, ot Maryland, who Introduced him.
"The governor s room in that magnlilcent and
very costly building at Albany," said Mr. Bell to a
! Star re porter, who inquired for particulars of his
[ visit, "is much larger and handsomer than any
| room In the White House?outside of the East room,
and we remarked upon the fact to his excellency.
I A comfortable crowd of visitors were In attendance;
no one Is kept waiting, every caller walks
right In. and the democratic atmosphere was really
invigorating, aud lu strong contrast to the air of
ante-rooms and offices In some of our departments
here. The governor was seated at his table, busy
at work, aud Secretary Lamont, to whom also I
was introduced and who inquired alter many here,
was seated near. After I had taken a good look at
the governor's profile, and falling to recognize him
from his pictures, he turned, and seeing Senator
Gorman, at once approached us. I was presented
by the Senator as his friend from Washington.
He spoke of his pleasure in meeting us, and said ;
tliat he had Vi3ited Washington twice before, not- !
withstanding the newspaper accounts to the con- j
trary, and turning around to a Knot ot newspaper
gentlemen, he Jokingly spoke or the papers having j
assigned hlra quarters prematurely. I was Intro- ;
duced arterwards to several of these comrades of '
yours by the Senator. Our chat was very pleasantly j
prolonged bythe distinguished governor,and then he '
moved around very dlgnlfiediy and with pleasant
manners, exchanged salutations with his callers,
clearing the room in a very quiet, quick way, and
then returned to where we stood again."
"Well, as to niv Impressions of the man they are
summarized in saying he is perfectly natural; as
God created him. so evidently he has measured up
gracefully towards his Being's end. No, he Is not i
handsome, In the ordinary-or womanly acceptation !
of tlie term, and I never saw a great man who was,
and 1 have seen every President from Taylor to Arthur
and all the men prominent in po.ltics (
within that period, as Senator Gorman and I were
pages respectively in the Senate and House at the
same time. Gov. Cleveland Is wonderiuily attractive?without
knowing it himself?not magnetically,
but naturally, ills couutenance shows force
and his mouth firmness, and, like a great ruler, he '
bears scars, l.nes and lurrows, proving him a hard
worker, a thoughtful man, wno, Uke liis fellows in
humbler stations, lias met aud overcome troubles
and sorrows. His lire presents a siuuy to ouryoung
men, for he ia a grand one.
"I have not met witnmanyof our local politicians, i
and, with little time to spare, have only heard, in
addition to The St ax lu-ms, of the discussion as to
inaugural ceremonies. I talked them over lncl- 1
dentally with Senator Gorman as we ilew along <
the Hudson road.to New York city. Tne Senator 1
will recognize our central committee, and aschalr- i
man of the National sub-committee will regulate ]
the affair on a grand scale, and everybody is will- i
lng to admit he knows how. My own ideas expressed
to him and some of our prominent busi- ]
ness men, outside of organizations, was that all i
our citizens should unite in this work of courtesy I
to the President and Vice President of the country, 1
and to the thousands who will join us from the
states. It win have a head m the national committee,
now established here, and be aided by our
local central committee and citizens, without regard
to party, for I take it some of our republican
citizens desire to show their xespect for the people's i
choice and ihelr obedience to Hi1 democratic doctrine
of majorities. The ball ought to be given m j

WHERE TIIEY WILL SLEEP.
myriads of Strangers Coming to the i
Inauguration?What the Hotel J?Ien :
Say?Thousands of Applications Received
for Rooms?Plenty of Food for
All?A Question as to Where They <
Will Lodge.
The Indications are that there will be a larger
crowd in this city on inauguration day than there
has ever been before. The city will be Increased to
almost double its summer population, and its
lodging capacity will be tested to the utmost. The
hotels have already received enough applications
for quarters to All them two or three times over.
Mr. Burch, of the Ebbltt house, says they have
this early received more applications for aparv .
ments than they ever did during any Inaugural
time In the history of the city?an Immense number.
i t the Arlington, Riggs and Wormley's countless
applications have been received. Mr. Staples,
of Wlllard's, says he has received 3,500 letters of
Inquiry. At the National they say they have received
four thousand, and at the Metropolitan they
have received too many to keep an account of.
the ebbitt hocse.
At the Ebbltt eight hundred guests can be accommodated.
They are receiving a large number
of letters every day from wealthy merchants and
business men from the north and east, who want
to be provided for. Some want quarters for Inauguration
week, and some for the period covered by
the two events of national interest?the dedication
of the Washington Monument on the 22d of February
and the Inauguration. Mr. Burch savs he
never in all his experience saw such a demonstration
of Interest so tar in advance. Many state that
they have not attended an inaugural for twentyflve
years. The preparations for the accommodation
of guest3 have been very thorough, but owing
to the large number of their old guests they will be
called upon to entertain, they have declined to
make any engagements at this early date. The
house has been newly frescoed and carpeted and
furnished throughout, and preparations have been
made to provide for an unusual number of guests.
There will be no increase In rates and no bidding
for accommodations on mat occasion. This Is true i
of all the first-class hotels.
tiik arlington.
The proprietor of the Arlington has prepared
every comfort for the increased number of guests
the Inauguration will bring. The rooms have all
been refitted, and a large number of handsome
pictures and wall decorations have been recently
hung throughout the house, and firty new baths
I have been put in. In the hotel proper and the two
large houses on either side, which have been attached
to It permanently, something over four hundred
guests can be accommodated. Besides this,
t he house, across the street, recently vacated by
the republican national committee, which they
have rented and are fitting up, will accommodate
about a hundred and fifty more. They, too, have
been obliged to decline to pledge themselves to
accommodate any of their many applicants until
later on, when they could tell better Just what
they wili be able to do for them.
twk riogs house
can accommodate 550 guests, and have agreed to
take care of the Sam Randall club, of Philadelphia,
numbering 130, but have declined to pledge themselves
further. Mr. De Shields says he never heard
of such a rush as Is being made for quarters. Letters
and telegrams are coming from all parts of the
country. They will make preparations to accommodate
as many as they can comfortably, and take
care ot them as they come, but beyond what they
already have they decline to keep any rooms in re.
serve.
No strangers at all will be taken at Wormley's,
as they have not room enough for their regular
guests, who will want to be provided for on the 4th
or March.
willard's
Mr. Staples has rented four houses as annexes to
Wlllard's, and will be prepared to entertain from
twelve to thirteen hundred guests. He has already
made arrangements with 800 besides his regular
guests. Attorney General Bryson and Secretary
ot state Chapin,of New York, have engaged rooms,
as have also the Cleveland club of Buffalo, the
Ameilcus club, and the Cleveland club of Albany.
the metkopolitan and national.
Neither the Metropolitan nor the National will
make arrangements with guests thus far ahead.
The National can quarter between twelve and dfteen
hundred, and the Metropolitan nearly as
many.
All these hotels together will quarter about 6,000
people, probably not one-tenth the number who
will be here to attend the Inauguration. The rest '
will be dispersed about the city and stowed away
as best they may be. Other hotels and restaurants
will accommodate some. Many private houses will
be thrown open to guests for the occasion, the numerous
private boarding houses will be crowded to
the attic, aud probably all the halls In the city
will be tilled with bunks in order to give the people
a place to sleep.
plenty of food.
As far as food is concerned, the city can feed as i
many people as can possibly get into It. The
Riggs house dining room can accommodate 400 people
at one time; the Arlington and the Ebbltt can
each seat fully as many, and Wlllard's can seat 700
at once. With good corps of waiters they can all
serve as many as come. Besides there are hundreds
of eating places all over the city. Mr. DeShleids
will have the House restaurant open and
well equipped with attendants, so as to supply
those about the Capitol at all times. A hundred !
and fifty to two hundred thousand strangers can
be fed in the city, but where to lodge them all will be
a serious question, which, however, can probably
be satisfactorily settled.

J (
To the Congress of the United States:
Since the close of your last session the American I j
people, in the exercise of their highest right of ' j
suffrage, have chosen their Chief Magistrate tor the i
four years ensulncr.
When It is remembered that at no period In the
country's history has the long political contest t
which customarily precedes the day of the r.a- 1
tlonal election been waged with greater fervor and 1
intensity, it Is a subject of general congratulation j '
that after the controversy at the polls was over, j 1
and while the slight preponderance by which the i ,
issue had been determined was as yet unas- j
ceruilned, the public peace suffered no disturbance. \ .
but the people everywhere patlenily and quietly | ,
awaited the result. I
Nothing could more strikingly Illustrate the tern- j J
per of the American citizen, his love of ord t, and
his loyalty to law?nothing could more signally j J
demonstrate the strength and wisdom of our political
Institutions.
importance of legislation respecting tub electoral
corNT.
Eight years have passed since a controversy con- 1
cernlng the re ult of a national election sharply j
called the attention of tne Congress to thtj news- ; j
Elty of providing more precise and deiinlte regulations
for counting the electoral vote. ]
It Is ot the gravest Importance that this question i
be solved before conflicting claims to the 1'resl- ,
Uency shall again distract t he country, and I am <
persuaded that, by the people at large, any of the j
measures of relief thus iar proposed would be pre- ,
terred to continued inaction. i <
FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
Our relations with all foreign powers continue tot 1
be amicable.
With Belgium a convention has been signed, j
whereby the scope of present treaties has been so
enlarged as to secure to citizens of either country j
within the Jurisdiction or the otner equal rights <
ind privileges In the acquisition and alienation of
property. A trade-marks treaty has also been concluded.
Tne war between Chill and Peru Is at an end.
For the arbitration of the claims of American cl 1sens
who during its continuance suffered through
the acts of the Chilian authorities a convention , ;
will soon be negotiated. | j
china.
The state of hostilities between France and
China continues to be an embarrassing feature o ]
our Eastern relations. The Chinese government 1
tias promptly adjusted and paid the claims o ;
American citizens whose property was destroyed (
In the recent riots at Canton. I renew the recom- ,
mendatlon of my last annual message, that the '
Canton indemnity fund be returned to China.
The true interpretation of the recent treaty with
that country, permitting the restriction of Chinese
Immigration, Is likely to be again the subject of i
your deliberations. It may be seriously questioned ,
whether the statute passed at the last session '
iloes not violate the treaty rights of certain 1
Chinese who left this country with return certiii- i
cates valid under the old law and who now seem ; t
to be debarred from relandlng for lack of the cer- ]
tlflcate required by the new. j ;
The recent purchase by citizens of the United <
states of a large trading fleet heretofore under th 1
Chinese flag has considerably enhanced our com s
merclal Importance in the East, in view of the <
large numoer of vessels built or purchased by
American cltlzes In other countries and exclusively 1
employed In legitimate traffic between foreign {
ports under the recognized protection ot our flag, 1
ft might be well to provide a uniform rule for their !
registration and documentation, so that the bona <
fide property rights of our citizens therein shall be <
duly evidenced and properly guarded.
the congo basin.
Pursuant to the advice o! the Senate at the last j
session, I recognized the flag of the International s
Association of the Congo as that of a friendly gov- i
ernment, avoiding In so doing any prejudgment of '
conflicting territorial claims In that region. Sub- t
eequently, in execution ot the expressed wish of . c
the congress, I appointed a commercial agent for l
the Congo Basin. t
The importance of the rich prospective trade of i
the Congo Valley has led to the general conviction t
that it should be ooen to all nations upon equal
terms. At an International conference lor the consideration
of this subject called by the Emperor of
Germany, and now in session at Berlin, delegates (
are In attendance on behalf of the United States. <
of the results of the conference you will be uuly j i

kecom jlendation of purch ase of legation pkemi- 1
8es at corea. i t
The government of Corea has generously aided \
the efforts of the United States minister to secure j <
suitable premises for the use of the legation, as j
the conditions ot diplomatic intercourse with east- 1 i
ern nations demand that the legation premises be 1
owned by the represented power, I advise that an ]
appropriation be made for the acquisition of this 1
property by the Government. The United States : 1
already possess valuable premises at Tangier as a ; j
gift from the Sultan of Morocco. As Is stated here- ,
alter, they have lately received a similar gift from
the Siamese Government. The Government of
Japan stands ready to present to us extensive '
?;rounds at Toklo whereon to erect a suitable baud- i
ng for the legation, court-house and Jail; and slml- ]
lar privileges can probably be secured In China and ,
Persia. The owning of such premises would not
only effect a large saving of the present rentals but J
would permit of the due assertion of extraterrito- (
rial rights in those countries, and would the better ,
serve to maintain the dignity of the United States. ,
advises restoration of agency and consulate- (
general at caiko. i
The failure of Congress to make rpproprlatlon 1
for our representation at the au tonomus court of }
the Khedive has proved a serious embarassment in j
our intercourse with Egypt; and In view of the i
necessary intimacy of diplomatic relationship due (
to the participation of this government, as one of ,
the treaty powers, in all matters of administration <
there affecting the rights of foreigners, I advise \
the restoration of the agency and consulate-general <
at Cairo on Its former basis. I do not conceive it (
to be the wish of Congress that the United States ]
should withdraw altogether from the honorable ?
position they have hliherto held with respect to the. j
Khedive, or that citizens of this republic residing
or sojourning in Egypt should hereaiter be without 1
the aid and protection of a competent represents- \

france and the bartholdi btatije. j
With France, the traditional cordial relationship 1
continues. The colossal statue of Liberty enlightening
the World, the generous gift of the people of
France, Is expected to reach New York In May
next. I suggest that Congressional action be
taken In recognition of the spirit which has 1
prompted this gift, and In aid of the timely com- 1
pletlon of the pedestal upon which It Is to be j
placed. i
germ ant, great britain, etc. 1
Our relations with Germany, a country which t
contributes to our own some of the be3t elements '
of citizenship, continue to be cordial. The United
States have extradition treaties with several of the
German states, but by reason of the confederation ;
ot t iose states under " the Imperial rule, the appll- j
cat ion of such treaties Is not as uniform and corn- .
preuenslve as the interests of the two countries re
quire. I propose, therefore, to open negotiations .
Tor a single convention of extradition to embrace j
all the territory of the Empire. f
It, affords me pleasure to say that our Intercourse ,
with Great Britain continues to be of a most frit ndiy ,
character. i
The Government of Hawaii has indicated Its willingness
to continue for seven years the provisions
of the existing reciprocity treaty. Such continuance,
In view of the relations of that country to
the American system of States, should, In my Judgment,
be favored.
The revolution In Haytl against the established t
government has terminated. While it was In i
progress it became necessary to enforce our neu- (
trallty laws by Instituting proceedings against In- f
dividuals and vessels charged wit h their Infringe- fi

Much anxiety has lately been displayed by va- t
rlous European governments, and especially by o
the government of Italy for the abolition of our 1m- I
port duties upon works of art It is well to con- t
elder whether the present discrimination in favor v
of the productions of American artists abroad Is
not likely to result, as they themselves se .-m very c
generally to believe it may, In the practlc J exclu- i
sion of our painters and sculptors from the rich a

There is prospect that the long-pending revision
of the foreign treaties of Japan ma&be concluded t
at a new conference to be held atToklo. W hile l
this government fully recognizee the equal and Independent
station of Japan in the community of
nations, It would not oppose the general adoption
of such terms of compromise as Japan may be
disposed to oiler in furtherance ot a uniform l
policy ot intercourse with Western nations. a

During the past year the increasing good-will ?
between our own Government and that ot Mexico 0

tried and convicted.
Tue gro-.vlng need of clcse relationship of Inter- :
course and trafhe between Hie Spanish Antilles
and their natural market in the l ulled Stat.* led
lo the adoption, in .January ^t, or a commercial
agreement looking to that end. This agreement :
has since be--u superseded b\ a more carefully
framed and comprehensive convention, which I
-hail submit to the Senate for approval. It has
been the aim of this negotiation to ojx*ti such a labored
reciprocal exchange of productions carried
under the flag or either country, as to make the intercourse
bet ween Cuba and i'orio Rico and ourselves
scarcely less intimate than the commercial
movement between our domestic ports, and to insure
a n tnova. of the burdens on shipping In the
Spanish Indies, of which in the p ist our snip-owners
and ship-masters have so ouen had cause to
tcompiain.
The negotiation of this convention has tor a time
postponed the prosecution or certain claims of our
citizens which were declared to be w thout the
jurisdiction or the late Spanish-American Claims !
ronunisslon, and which are therefore remitted to
llpiomatlc channels tor adjustment. Tie; speedy i
settlement or these claims will now be urged by this
government.
OTnKR COUNTRIES.
Negotiations ior a treaty of commercial reciprocity
with the Dominican Republic have been
successfully concluded, and the result will shortly
t>e laid berore the Senate.
Certain questions between the United States and
:he ottoman Empire stili remain unsolved. Complaints
on b?'halt of our citizens are nor satlsractorlly
idjusted. The Porte has sought to withhold rrom
jur commerce the right of tavored treatment to
tviiieh we are entitled by existing conventional
ilipulations, and the revision of the tariffs Is unaccomplished.
The linal disposition of pending questions with
Venezuela has not as yet been reached, but I have
food reason to expect an early settlement, which
>vili provide the means of re-examining the Caracas
iwards In conformity with tiro < xpressed desire of
Congress, and which will recognise the Justice of
certain claims preferred against \ enezuela.
CENTRAL AND OPTW AMERICAN COMMISSION.

INTERNATIONAL MERIDIAN CONFERENCE.
The International .Meridian Conference, lately J
:onvened in Washington ujjon the invitation of the
Government ot the Unfed States, was composed of
epresentatlves rrom tweaty-flve nations. The

having with sub-tantlal un inlmlty agreed
lpon the meridian or Greenwich as the starting 1
joint whence longitude Is to be computed tLrough
me hundred uud eighty degrees eastward and

In the world's production, an 1 almlngto secure

I recommend that the scope of the neutrality ;

cover all patent acts or hostility committed In our

naturalization law should bb rbtisbd.
Our existing naturalization laws also need revision.
Those sections relating to persona residng
within the limits of the United States in 17%
ind 1796 have now only a historical Interest. Secion
2172, recogn.zlng the citizenship of the children
if naturalized parents, is ambiguous in Its terms
nd partly obsolete. There are special provisions
>f law favoring the naturalization of those who
erve in the Army or In merchant vessels, while no
imllar privileges are granted those who serve in
he Navy or the Marine Corps.
"An uniform rale of naturalization," such a* the
Constitution contemplates, should, Mno- g other
things, clearly define the fTatu-? of person* bora

It mbrht be wise to provide for a central
bureau of registry. wherein should be filed auihen:l
ated transcripts of every record of naturalization
il the several Federal and state courts, and to
make provision also for the vacation or cancellation
of such record In cases where fraud had bei?n
practiced upon (he court by the applicant himself

iaspect would strengthen the hanls of the government

pave the way for the conclusion of treaties ol naturalization

THE rtPl-OM HT1C SEKVICK.
The legislation of the last session effected In the

and reductions which have been productive of embarrassment.

and are plving rise to new, varying and often delicate
relationships with other countries, our f*eign
establishment now embraces nearly dooMf
the area of operations that it occupied twenty
ye-irs ago. The confinement of such a service
within the limits of expenditure then establishes is
not, it seems to me, in accordance w ith true economy.

A project for the reorganization of the eoosu.ar

of a short session will r."t allow of its full consideration,
I trust that you will not fall to make suitable

I concur with the Secretary of the Treasury in
recommending the Immediate suspension of the
coinage ot silver dollars and of the issuance of silver
certificates. This is a matter,to which, in former
communications, I have more than once invoked
the attention or the National L<*glslature.
It appears that annually lor the past six years
there have been coined. In compliance with the
requirements of the act of February 2s, 1878, more
than twenty-seven million silver dollars. The
number now outstanding is reported by the Secretary
to be nearly one hundred and eighty-tlve million,
whereof but little more than forty million, or
less than 22 p> r cent, are in actual circulation
The mere existence ol this fact seems to me to furnish
of ltse.f a cogent argument for the repeal of
the statute which has made sueh fact possible.
But there are other and graver consideration!
that tend in the same direction.
The Secretary avows his conviction that unless
this coinage and the .Ssu-mce ot silver certificates
be suspended, sliver is llkelv at no distant day to
become our sole metallic standard. The commercial
disturbance and the impairment of national
credit that would be thus occasioned can scarcely
be overestimated.
I hope that the Secretary's suggestions respects
lng the withdrawal from circulation of the onedollar
and two-dollar notes will revive your approval.
It is likely t hat a considerable portion ol
the sliver now encumbering the vaults of th*
Treasury might thus find its way Into the currency.
While trade-dollars have ceased, for the present
at least, to be an element of i ctlve disturbance In
our cuirency system, some provision should be
made tor their surrender to the Government. In
view or the circumstances under which they were
coined and of the fact that they have never had a
legal-tender quality, there shoul i be offered to!
them only a slight advance over their bullion
value.
The Secretary, In the course of his report, considers
the propriety of beuutiry ing the designs or
our subsidiary silver coins and of increasing
their we ght that they may bear their due ratio ol
value to the standard dollar. <lls conclusions in
this regard are cordially approved.
In my annual message of itW2 1 n commended the
abolition of all excise taxe.-? except .nose relating
to distilled spirits, This recommendation Is now
renewed. In case these taxes shah lie abolished
the revenues that will still remain to tlie Government
will, in my opinion, not only suffice to meet
its reasonable expenditures, but will afford a surplus
large enough to permit such tariff reduction
as may seem to be advisable, when the results < f
recent revenue laws and commercial t reatles shall
have shown In what quarters those reductions can
be most judiciously effected.
COMMISSION RECOMMENDED TO DKVISI? MEAN'S FOX
INCREASING OUR FOREIGN TRADE.
One of the gravest of the problems which appeal
to the wisdom of congress for solution is the ascertainment
of the most effective means ror increasing
our foreign trade and thus relieving the uepression
under w'alcfc our industries are now languishing.
The Secretary of the Treasury advlaes that
the duty or Investigating this subject be intrusted
In the first instance to a competent commission.
While fully recognizing the considerations
that may be urged against this course,' am
nevertheless of th< opinion that, ujton the whole,
no other would be likely to effect speedier or better
results.
That portion of the Secretary's report which conterns
the condition of our shipping interests cannot
fall to command your attention. He emphatically
recouimcnds that as an Incentive to the investment
of American capital in American steamships,
the government shall by liberal payments
for mail transportation, or otherwise, lend lis
active assistance to Individual enterprise, and
declares his belief that unless that course be pursued
our foreign carrying trade must remain, as it
Is to-day, almost exclusively to the hands of foreigners.
one phase of this subject is now especially prominent,
In view of the repeal by the act of Juae 86
1884, oi all statutory urovisions arbitrarily compelling
American vesseis to carry the molls to and
from ihe United States. As it is necessary to make
provision to compensate the owners of auen vessels
lor performing that service after April, 1885, U Is'
hoped that the whole subject will receive- eirl*
consideration that will lead to the enactment oi
such measures for the revival of our merchant
marine as the wisdom of Cougress may devtte.
RECOMMENDATION'S FOR PREVENTION OF OONHUO
TION OF CURRENCY.
The three per cent, bonds of the Government tc
the amount or more than floo.ouo.ooo have, slncc
my last annual message, been redeemed by the
Treasury. The bonds ot that Issue still outstanding
amount to little over f200.000.000, about onefourth
of which will be reUied through the operations
of the sinking fund during the coming year.
As these bonds still constitute tne chief basis for
the circulation of the national banks, the question
how to avert the contraction of the currency,
caused by their retirement, is one of constantly Increasing
importance.
It seems to be generally conceded that the law
governing this matter exacts from the banks excessive
security, and that, upon their present nenu
deposits, a larger circulation than Is now allowed
may be granted with salety. I hope that tfteMll
which passed the Senate at the last imsdoa, permitting
the issue of notes equal to the face walue
of the deposited bonds, will commend ttaaU to the
approval of the House of Representative*,
