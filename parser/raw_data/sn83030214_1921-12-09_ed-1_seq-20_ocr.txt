Answer Sears, Roebuck ?*?* C??. com?
mon and preferred are, in our opinion
pcculativc. During; tin? wni* period
and the boom fo.lowing the Armistice,
and up until tiie drop in prices ?if this
year, ?Ik* c mpany \\;is forced to pur?
chase great si cka of merchandise at
the then high wholesale prices. When
the drop in retail prtcea came it had
to compelo with local stores with small
st icks to be dispo od ?>f. and had either
to take rather heavy .ossea or be un?
dersold by oca; stores. Whether or
n t the merchandise of the company
Ims l?c, ?i ??I liquidated yet, we cannot
say. The quoi li a would be one on
which you wouid he sp culating", The
common paid -I', per cent dividends
in 1909 and 7 per cent from 1910 to
1!M7; then S per cent to November,
1920, February dividends was paid in
script and the May dividends was

dividends from October, Li)0(i, to dale.

Answer- \S e would not sell any of ;
the bonds that you now hold and we ?
would not switch from Belgian 8s to
cither Danish or Swiss bonds. This, of j
course, is a mere matter of opinion |
based on talks with various bankers i
and economists who have recently re- !
turned from Europe. For the addi- !
tional $3,000 w?j. suggest Shawinigan
Water & Power first refunding 6s, due
1950; recently selling slightly under I
par; Standard Oil of New York 6*. pi r
cent debentures, due 1935, selling to
yield about 6 per cent: and State of?
Queensland (Australia) 7 per cent
bonds, du<> 1941, recently selling at a
price to yield a little over 01,. per cent
to maturity.
A Switch From Tel. and Toi. Gs
Question Will you kindly e'vo me the
benefit of your advice as t" ?viml, in your
judgment, would be best for me to <io'.' '
own two bonds of the American Tel. and
Tel. Co, l! per cent, due 1925, convertible to
stock at $10!',. 1 have been advised to havo
these bonds converted into the stock at
this tima. "U'?l you kindly tell me of any
advantage this might lie to. me? Am a
business woman, and not dependent on the
Income now, but do not want to take any
undue rfaka. Tin? stock paya l> per cent,
whoreas tho bond? pay ? per cent. --M. S
Annwcr Wo regard tho stock of Ml?
American Telephon?} und Telegraph
Company oa nmong ?no best, of the in?
vestment stocks. Nevertheless, we urc
of tin' opinion Hint in converting your
13 per cenl bon Is into i >is stocK you
would bo sacrificing too largo a dogroe
of safety for n person in your position,
The Btock is dependent for its divi?
dends upon the earnings of tho com
pony and its subsidiaries, and, of
course, limits after nil tho bond Issues
of nil the Boll Telephone companies.
Wo think, however, that, tho recent in?
crease, in the price of American T?le
phone and Telegraph stock and in the
price of the convertible bonds nives you
? very unusual opportunity to increase
both your income nntl tho security of
your investment position. At current
market prices you can sell your con?
vertible bonds md buy either Hell Tel?
ephone Company o1* Pennsylvania 7s or
Northwestern H"ll Telephone 7s, both
('no in lui; *' increasing; your in?
come from ?JfJO on each $1,000 bond to
$70 and strength nin<r your invest?
ment position by acquiring a mortgage
bond which ranks ?<b -ad of the con?
vertibles ns to principal und interest.

T W
Answer International Mercantile
Marino first mortgage mid col. (is, duo
in 19-11, aro a well secured bond, in
our opinion. We think that the
capital -loi".* of tile White Star Line,
which is beind them as ;i collateral
security, is valuable enough to make
this issue an attractive investment. It
would be in about the same class as
your other securities, all of which are
good, we think.

Says American Valuation
Plan Will Be Adopted
The American Valuation A?8ociation
yesterday reasserted its belief that the
plan will be passed in the new tariff
bill. A statement issued by the ex?
ecutive con?mittee of the organization,
which includes a large number of man?
ufacturers in its membership, says:
"President Harding in hit message
to Congress sai? that the American
valuation was no radical departure, in
view of the varying condition? and the
disordered state of money ralues r.t
this time. The matter has now been
considered for many months, and no
satisfactory substitute for American
valuation has been put forward by any
one, not even the opponents of the
plan. Due to the unstable conditions
of currency abroad, as suggested by
the President, there appears, after a
long study of the. situatiqn, no alterna?
tive, if a fair and equitable tariff 4a to
be provided,"
