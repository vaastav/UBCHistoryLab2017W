The President's Message.
Wp publish this mornlnj? an abstract of
thr President's message. Before indulging
in extended comments upon it, we shall
wait until we shall have read the whole
document, since it would hardly be fair to
judge of it# merits from a telegraphic svnop
ms of its contents. Enough, however, ap
pears to justify us iu inferring that General
Gnant ha> surrendered his own policy both
at home and abroad, and instead of say inp
" Let us have peace/' calls for trouble in
the South, and trouble with Great Britain.
His declaration that the right of the nej?ro to
vote has been denied in the South, and the
verdict of the people thereby reversed, is.
to put it in a mild form jjih! not in Mr.
Grkelby's plain EnglNh, a downright false
hood, and could have lxen uttered for no
other purpose than to arouse in the north
ern States some of that old anti-rebel pre
judice upon which the Radicals so often
rode into power previous to this year. His
recommendations in regard to the fisheries
and the Alabama claim* are no l?etter.
They will touch no responsive chord in
the bosoms of the American people, who
are sick of New England and b?r tan'th
nud bounties and general blood-sucking
propensities, and have no desire to go to
war with any Power under the sun on her
account. So as to his utterances in regard
to San Domingo. No European Power has
any idea of having the least trouble with
the United States on account of San Do
mingo or the Bay of Samana.
The President's references to Germany
?nd France are non-committal enough to
Kitisfy the most prudent of his friends*.
Jli.H recommendations in regard to the
finances, and to the various other subjects
of domestic policy touched upon, we shall
not comment upon this morning. We shall,
h* in duty bound, publish the message in
full to-morrow morning. We therefore dis
miss it for the present in the hope that it j
has more of General Grant's and less of
B^'ast BrTLER's policy in it than the synop
sis of It would lead us to believe.
And Now for Work.
The Convention which*assembled in this
city yesterday nominated an unexceptiona
ble candidate for the IIou>e of Delegates.
Col. John II. Grv is the mau, and he has j
accepted the nominat ion. It is our duty to
elect him. When su<h a man consents to
?acrtfiee his time and his business for the
purpose of serving the people, it is their I
duty to make sure of having his services by
doing all that lie;, in their power to secure
his election. Col. Guy is well known to
the people, having been an active canvasser
in the Walk kr campaign. He is admira
bly fitted for the place for which he has been
nominated, lie w ill be a capable, faithful,
and efficient member of the House of Dele
gates.
Now, work for his election, Remind |
your neighbors, especially your country
neighbors, that the election will take place
three days hence? next Friday. There Is
no time to be lost. Summon the voters to !
the polls, and lei us once more put the seal
of condemnation upon the wretched crowd
of adventurers who would till our places of
trust with individuals selected from their
own raotly crew of carpet-baggers, scala
wags, and poor, ignorant, deluded (but ex
cusable), negroes.
A New Radical Paper.? Wliat have we
here ^ A new Radical paper, edited and
published (we nre guessine) by the Custom
house clique ? that is to say, J. M. Hum
rHBETS, Lewis Lindsey, and others of the
name stripe. "If wishes were horses,"
says that .Shakspeare when Anna Dickin
son classes with Dickens, " if wishes were
horses, beggars might rise on horseback."
And we say that if profession were per
formance, IIcmphreys would make a re
spectable editor. He " roars you as gently
as any sucking dove " in his first issue. He
is a 4* marvellous proper man." He de
sires only to have the privilege of tilling
the Federal offices in Virginia with his
creatures, and the handling of all the com- !
missions that pass fjom Washington to the
Federal appointees. Of course, he will
put down the State Journal , and we shall
soon hear no more of that pestilent enemy
of Porter's ; but this will be so small a
job that ** we won't mention it." We are
amazed at learning from the National Vir
ginian ? we were about to forget to men
tion its name? that " the Federal offices in
Virginia are, to a great extent, filled with
those who devoted their best energies to the
destruction of our Government and country,
and who are unchanged to-day at heart."
And we concur in the opinion that it is
high time for a change. Let us " make
k things lively." Out with the entire batch
of them, say we ; and we cherish the hope
that Grant, like Mercutio, will say, ,4A
plague on both your houses," and turn out
of office every man belonging to either the
National Virginian clique or the State
Journal clique. We trust, too, that Gillis
will ferret out the stockholders in this
41 .National Virginian joint stock company,"
and point " the slow, umnoving finger of
scorn " at them until they flee like t he guilty
wretches they are from before the face of
the paper that publishes the post-olllce ad
vertisements.
The National Virginian already wears
two faces. The outside seems to have been
printed in Baltimore or Philadelphia,
whilst the inside appears to have been print
ed in Eichmond ; and there is very little
&mily resemblance between the two faces.
We regard the National Virginian us a
torpedo, or bomb-shell, and so we wish it
much success in " blowiug up " whatever
is left at present of the Radical party in Vir
ginia.
An Adjudicated Point.? An exchange
?ays that there has been some discussion
among the newspapers of ilichiaan as to
the eligibility of Judge Sutherland, the.
Democratic candidate recently elected in i
the fourth congressional district. A clause
of the State Constitution provides that no
Judge of the Circuit Court shall be elected
to any office, other than judicial, during his
term of duty, or for one year thereafter,
and that all votes cast for such ineligible
person " shall be void."
This point has been repeatedly raised in
the two Houses of Congress, and invariably
decided, we think, against the right of a
State to prescribe any qualifications for
members of Congress. We remember the
case of Senator Trumbull, whose eligibility
to the Senate was questioned, and whose
scat was contested, upon this identical
point. The Senate wisely decided that the
Constitution of the United States fixes the
qualifications of Senators, and that that
body would not, and could not consistently
with its own dignity, look to State Consti
tutions to find disqualifications ; for if one
State might add one qualification, another
might add another, and thus the Senate
would in time come to consist of a com
pound of rare ingredients? a sort of
Joseph's coat of many colors? one color
being the only one allowed in Maine, and
| another the only one allowed in Texas,
whilst othor State* might require w many
hues as arc contained in the rainbow.
Judpo Sutherland Ir clearly entitled to a
seat in the House of Representative*, and
if ho shall be excluded it will not be because
the point raised against him Is worthy of
any consideration, but because the Radi
cals will have need of all the judical mem
berg they can got into the House of Repre
sentatives either by fair means or foul.
Oppressive Taxation. ? No better illus
tration of the manner in which this country
is misgoverned, and the southern States are
oppiessed, could be wished for than is af
forded in the annual report of the Commis
sioner of Internal Revenue. Without an
intimation that such a tax-law must be un
just, or n hint that any State is by its opera
tion robbed of her money, Mr. Delano
states that he expects next year to collect
from Virginia ,9*19,000, and from Massa
chusetts only $4,444,000. If the relative
population of the two States determined
the amount of taxation which they ought
to pay respectively, Massachusetts would
have to nay five millions to Virginia's four ;
whilst if the relative wealth of the two
States determined it, Massachusetts ought
to pay four times as much as Virginia.
Such legislation it is that causes our people
to be so tardy in renewing their love for the
old Union. .Not only is Virgiuia shame
fully oppressed in this way. but the money
which she contributes is paid out in the
shape of bounties, Ac., to those very New
Englanders who thus wrong her. Yet
Sumner and ull of the tribe of fanatics in
Boston have the face to lament over the
wrongs inflicted upon people in Europe,
Asia, Afriua, and everywhere else in the j
world than these southern States.}
I Commodore Maury is out in another long
I and glowing letter on the resources of this
J State, and the best mode of inducing immi
irration from Europe. Jle thinks farmers
should club their land in large areas and
oiler it on -redit to immigrants in lots of
forty acres to each family. Our theory is
that' the mo?t certain way of drawing whites
hither, is to get the blacks awav. SoOapieee
to each head of a tamily would induce most
of them to migrate southward, where there
is a tine field and a climate suited to them.
Of course there should, and could, in facr,
b?< no compulsion. It is a question wholly
of interest. Their labor is worth twice as
much thereto them and their employes.
Winchester Xeirs.
The yctns is not wrong. The negro is
the cause of the cheapness of the lands and j
the general appearance of uuthriftiness in
the rural districts.
The case in England does not apnear to
be parallel : there is a dense population ;
there is a pauper labor already created ;
there is a constant strife, not for wealth,
but for any employment for daily bread ;
and God grant that ii may be many years yet
before our working classes bscome similar
to those of England.? Clafiin,$ Weekly.
And this " constant strife, not for wealth,
but tor any employment for daily bread."
will aiise in this country so soon as it shall
be cursed with that too dense population
which so many persons consider the highest j
evidence of prosperity. Let us make haste '
slowly. We shall be old and decrepit soon
enough.
Poor Rives !? And Judge Rives has con
sented to contest the right of Colonel Duke
to his seat in the House of Representatives !
Well, there's no telling how low a man will
go when he once enters the downward path
of Radicalism. We feel ashamed of the
Judge as a Virginian. We are mortilied
that tills good old Commonwealth should
exhibit to Congress the spectacle which he
has arranged for her humiliation. But we
doubt that even this Congress will give him
a seat under the circumstances. Time will
soon decide. The position is good for only
three months at most.
Again has the irrepressible Porter been
snubbed by the llouse of Representatives,
i'be slap which Pat Woods once gave him
in the face was as nothing compared with
that administered to him yesterday by his
fellow-members. They beg leave to be ex
cused from performing any more dirty jobs
for Porter. Parley, the porter , was in
duced to let enemies into his master's castle
through that same weakness which will yet
ruin Porter , the parleur.

John Brown, at Charlestownj Va., for the
crime of leading an armed force against the
?State of Virginia lor the purpose of libe

has been solemnly observed by the colored
people of that city, and Friday night a large
number assembled at Shilob Presbyterian
Church, corner of Prince and Marion streets,
to assist in commemorating the sacrifice of
the dead patriot. There was singing and
prayer and eulogistic speeches. H. High
land Garnet, pastor of the church, said be
was in Brown's confidence and knew ail bis
plans. Brown was in Shiloli church just be
fore going South, u to strike a blow," and
** he sat there," said the reverend gentle
man, " in that pew which is now reserved
for the elders." On that occasion Brown's
favorite hymn, " Blow ye the trumpet,
blow," was sung at his request.
Central Methodist Episcopal Church?
Admission of Dr. Bledsoe? His Sermon . ?
Yesterday Dr. Albert T. Bledsoe, of the
Southern Quarterly Review, who lately ex
pressed publicly his dissent from certain
tenets of the Protestant Episcopal Church,
formally connected himself with the Meth
odist Episcopal Church, South, and atter
wards preached from the pulpit of the Cen
tral Church of that denomination, Lexing
ton street, on predestination. There was a
Sood congregation present, liev. Dr.
lunsey, pastor of the church, conducted
the services incidental to such occasions,
which are simple and direct.
Dr. Bledsoe appeared before the altar,
and, after answering the questions pro
pounded him by Dr. Munsey, according to
the requirements of the church discipline
for receiving new members, promising to
conform to all the usages of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, South, was duly admit
ted. After this ceremony Dr. Bledsoe as
cended the pulpit with Dr. Munsey, and
read his sermon.? Salt. Sun , 5th,

rc#tlsijF Report from llio Council
Coranilnic?? S>?tcb-Clap Csnnl to bo
Hfad?W?vlff?blc, Ac. >'
The tollowing report was presented to
the City Council at the meeting last even
ing:
Richmokd, Va,, Dec. 5, 1870.
To the Council of the City of Richmond :
Gentlemen, ? The Joint Committee on the
Improvement of James River respectfully
submit the following account ot their opera
tions since their last report on the 5th of
September, no report having been rendered
for the months of September and October
for the reason that the time was occupied
solely in completing the repairs on the tug,
dredge, and scows, and getting all the ma
chinery in readiness lor active operations.
In oiir last report we laid before you the
plan of operations we had determined on,
in conjunction with the Government cDgi
neers, for carrying out the improvements
committed to our care. Those plans have
been somewhat changed, or rather the com
mencement of their execution has been de
laved, by the memorable flood of October
l?t. The great freshet which then occur
red in the river swept away the barrier
that had been thrown across the opening
of the Dutch-gap canal, so that the whole
volume of the swollen stream swept through
the canal, deepening and widening it, while
the debris and sediment was deposited be
yond its mouth in Trent's Reach, filling the
channel iu some places to a depth ot three
feet. The result was an immediate disar
rangement of the commercial interests of
the city in consequence of the New York
steamers and large vessels being prevented
from reaching it without lightering their
cargoes or waiting for the height of tides.
It became a question, therefore, for im
mediate and serious consideration, whether
we should again close the mouth of the
Dutcb-gap-cunal, and thus throw the whole
volume ot the river through Trent's Reach,
and dredge out the bars and deposits that had
been formed, or should procced to make the
canal available for navigation. The Govern
ment engineers, learning of this change in
the river, came forward with commendable
alacrity and immediately decided to take
advantage of the action of nature, and as
sumed as a portion of their work to open
the Dutch-gap canal, throw the main cur
rent of the river through it, and make it
the general channel of navigation.
As this undertaking would require con
siderable time, and made it impolitic to
again close the mouth of the canal, it be
came of vast importance that the deposits
which had been formed in Trent's Keach
should be immediately sufficiently removed
to permit unimpeded navigation. We there
fore largely increased the force at work on
the repairs of the dredge and scows, and
on the 12th of November had them so far
completed that they proceeded to the point
of operations. * *
They have been steadily at work since
that date with most commendable results,
having completed one clear cut through tbe
new obstructions twenty-five feet in width
to a depth of fourteen feet, and now work
ing on the second cut. Tbey have removed
thus far about tour thousand cubic yards of
sand. Navigation is therefore now unim
peded for*all classes of vessels that usually
come to our port.
in view of the opening of the Dutch-gap
canal, it would be a useless expenditure for
us to open the channel in Trent's Reach to
its full width. We propose, therefore,
making the cut only to a width of fifty feet,
givinglt, however, a full depth of fourteen
teet, which will permit the passage of all
vessels that can cross the shoal points near
the city. We anticipate having this work
fully completed by tne 15th inst., and shall
theu proceed with the execution of our
plans as detailed in our report of Septem
ber 5th.
In regard to the progress of the improve
ments taken charge of by the Government
engineers, you will be pleased to learn that
they have awarded a contract for removing
so much of the wrecks and obstructions at
Drewry's Bluff and other points in the river
as wiU give an unobstructed channel
through them 250 feet in width and
eighteen feet in depth. The contractor,
Prof.B. Mallifert, of New York, began work
on the 20th of November, and is now ac
tively engaged in his operations. They
have* also awarded a contract for opening
and dredging the Dutch-gap canal to the
American Dredging Company, of Philadel
phia, who are to begin their work on the
1st of March and complete it in three
months. And thus do the difficulties and
obstacles which have so long impeded the
commercial growth of our city promise to
vanish before the appliances ol science and
energy.
Your committee deem it proper to tur
ther report that we have contracted for a
new and powerful dredge, which is now
being built by the American Dredging Com
pany, of Philadelphia, and will probably
be completed, to be delivered here by the
15th prox. With two good dredges, anu
the turther appliances we have in view, we
hope to fulfill the most sanguine expecta
tions that may be entertained from our
work.
We have also approved a plan submitted
to us by our engineer, Capt. R. D. Minor,
for depositing the material dredged from
the river. This plan was formed by him
alter full consultation with the Government
engineers in regard to their plans and in
tentions, and contemplates the building of
extended lines of piling, or timber crib
work, in proper localities, within which the
dredged material may be deposited, and
thus be effectually removed from all chance
of again washing into the channel. We
have contracted tor a pile-driver, and have
now under consideration the plans for pro
per scows and dumping cars, which as soon
as adopted will be contracted for, that no
delay may occur in the progress of the
work.
We also have the honor to report that
under the terms of the ordinances the com
mittee have filled the vacancy occasioned
by the death of Thomas Faherty. Esq., by
the election of Capt. George W. Allen, and
the vacancy occasioned by the transfer of
Capt. Allen to represent the Council by the
election of Garrett F. Watson, Esq.
We cannot close this report without re
ferring to the active Interest manifested by
Col. Craighill and his assistants in the im
provements which so much concern us.
Not only have they taken an interest in the
work committed to their charge by the Gov
ernment, but they seem to appreciate as
fully as ourselves the vast import of the
work, not to our local prosperity alone,
but in its ulterior results as a link in the
great central line of transportation. We
have reason to believe that he will present
a report to Congress, now about to meet,
in which will be demonstrated the entire
feasibility of the full extent of the improve
ments we have desired, with strong recom
mendations for liberal appropriations from
the Government to carry them out. It be
hooves us, therefore, to spare no efforts in
our own portion or the work, and also to
use every influence within our power to
induce Congress to consider favorably the
recommendations that will be made to
them. Respectfully submitted,
Albebt Obdway, Chairman.
Lawyers in Collusion with the Rail
road Robbers ? Treasure Discovered.?
Salt LakefUtah Territory, l)e e.3.? A few
days since F. F. Tracy, the agent of Wells,
Fargo & Co., in this city, received a dis
Eatcb from Elko, Nevada, stating that two
iwyers named Bonnafield and Rand, of
Elko, eaid to be employed as counsel for
Dan Taylor, one of the Central Pacific road
express car robbers, had, after a consulta
tion with Taylor, suddenly gone eastward.
Mr. Tracev put the matter into the hands
of the police, and as soon as Bonnafield and
Rand arrived on the train they were tracked
by detectives and followed west from this
city to a place near where Taylor was cap
tured ana arrested in the act of digging up
the stolen treasure. The detectives took
from the lawyers forty-five ounces of gold
dust and $2,000 in greenbacks, and digging
further they recovered $300 in gold coin.
Bonnafield* and Rand are now in jail here.
They say that Taylor told them where the
treasure was hidden in order to induce them
to act as his counsel.
14 Neck-tie parties" have dawned in the
rural districts. A neck-tie party is one
where each lady attending the party makes
a neck-tie of the same material as the dress
she wears. These are taken to where the
party is to be held and placed, in a bag.
When the gentlemen arrive each one must
go to the bag and take out a neck-tie, and
it ijs his duty to wait upon the lady during
the evening who wears the dress corres
ponding in material with the neck-tie. The
walf-flowers find it a splendid way to strike
an average.

2>r. mimbold:
Dear 8lr,_It Is with much pleasure tbut I write
yon upon facta respecting myself. I do not know
hardly how to express myself. I hare b*en Jor the
last tea or twelve years the greatest sufferer rain
could be and live ; bat more domett mes than others.
The com plaint was the "kidneys" and "bl.dder."
Have consulted doctors both In Massachusetts acd
this Ftate, and taken pills, I may say, by the quart,
also liquored medicines; but found no relief
from any, and got worse the last six months.
I was so that 1 could scarcely get about.
I conld not rest night or day. It would
soon have been ,4all up" with me if I
had not seen your advertisement In Ibe Berkshire
Courier headed "Kidneys." I rrad It through,
and thought I would try It. I purchased a bottle,
buf, mind you. I had not much faith ta it. Why
should I, when I had been trying so many things
and cost me so much ? Well, I be*an taking It. and
before I h'd taken the first bottle I felt bad ; but I
finished It aud got another. . By the time I took
half of the second I still got worse (apparent!' ).
When I walked it seemed as If my right kidney
was falling from its place, and I felt really had. I
felt so before I had finished the second that I had
made np my mind It wai no use trying any more ;
and all this t ime the ' 1 Buchu " was doing Its work,
but 1 did not know it, so I gave It up and went to
Hartford, to one of the best doctors In the city.
He said it was the neck of the bladder, and I should
hive to undergo an operation. He gave me medi
cine, and I went home quite down-hearted. On
Bunday I was unaMe to go to church. I had not
taken any of his medicines, but on my return con
tinued using "Buchu," and lite in the afternoon
of that day I passed the ugliest # tone or gravel you
ever saw, covered over with little pieces which col
lected together. It looks the color of a mud tur
tle, aud hard as a flint. So you see the " Bucbu "
was doing Its work, although I was feeling so
badly. I procured another bottle, thinking there
might he others; but since that passed, which Is
eight weeks ago last Sunday, I have l>een a? well
as ever I was In my life. I have the stone securely
wrapped, and those who have seen It in this place
are surprised. This Is a true story of my ca?e,
and you are welcome to make such use of my name
as you think proper. I am pretty well known In
Berkshire ; also In Connecticut. The advertise
ment saved me. Why not publish more? The
Sprlnirfleld Republican Is a wide-spread paper.
If any one wishes to see this wonder they can
do so- I could write all day, hut I think I have
said enough for this time, as I remain, ever your
well-wisher, EDWAKDL, HOWARD,

Mr. H. T. Hembold: Dearslr,? Iu repardtofbc
question asked me an to my opinion about Buchn,
I would say that I have used and sold the ?rtlclo In
various forma for the past thirty years. I do not
think there Is any form or preparation of it I have
not used, or kuowu to be used, in the various dis
eases where such medical patent would bo Indi
cate. You are aware, as well as in y self, that It
has been extensively employed In the various dis
eases of the bladder and kidneys, and the reputa
tion It has acquired. In my Judgment, la warranted
by the facts.
I have seen and used, as before stated, every
form of Buchu? the powdered leave*, tlnctnre,
fluid, extracts, and I am not copnlnnt of any pre
paration of that plant at all equal to youra. Twelve
years' experience ought, I think, to give nie th<?
right to Judge of Its merit*, and, without prejudice
or partiality, I j?lvc von precedtnce over all others.
I value your Buchu for Its t fleets on patients. I
have cured with It, and seea cured with it, more
diseases of the bladder and kidneys than I have
ever 6een cured with any other Buchn or any ofhor
proprietary compound of whatever name.

?? Bucliu " has effected. For four > earn J have Buf

self) came to the conclusion that my case win incur
able. Accident placed your advertisement In my
hands. I commenced taking your " Buchu." I
followed the directions, and, to my utter astonish
ment, before I had taken ?:vcn bottles of your val
uable medicine? (I would give One Hundrtd Dol
lars a bottle If I could not (ret it at any other
price)? I am entirely cured. I most earnestly re
commend It to all those suffering from disease. I
have told many persons to take your valuable med
