The funny part of the proposition is

scorafully demand proof his former
insinuation that hey Beared the trail
lag of hfg detectives are tfust as de
ceitful just as repreheniBtble just as
treockerctts as the auas 4faey wish to
t cx > ose It looks ery much like a
case of Teej > fool peep peep at
t a vour brother Winy shouWat one fool
psp at another But the fact that
mertai meiabers of xxwgressjtnay Jbe
Nat that Ilk did not warrant a presl
deBilal message containing sweeping
r initIons
i From a serious viewpoint was a
remarkable and outrageous thing
that tbe ckief executive officer of our
S great nation should make am insinu
ation amounting to an accusation
PhlSl the legislative branch of the
oYjH1iment Such a thing was un
1 fteard of before it was undignified
Inultlnj almost infamous It is im
qsfirbe to realize that an American
yr1dc t could have been so disloyal
I
1 ioi1I intry as to have opened such
ibreacfi t for foreign criticism iDspe

r
Ijrftended to be such an ardent advo
i cate of the nations honor so deeply
concerned tq defend It against all
criticism1 and make it stand as the
exE1ar of the greatest the truest
thctmoet righteous among the govern
J 1Ilts of the earth
OHO cannot help ihowever seeing
t the ludicrous side of the situation
while at the same time deploring the
oppOrtunity it may afford for a slur
< tram other nations that ihave ever
foeei eager to point out any Imperfec
1JoH in our republican form of gov
prent From this standpoint it is
no laughing matter Roosevelt was
spectacular ever when he called on
Etges to ibrlng a suit against cer
ti L new mp rs that hid questioned
kis veracity end made charges of dis
Aioseety against officials on the ground
that these papers had libeled the gov
xjnsment He was eajualy spectacular
fwticn he insinuated that members or
b national congress feared the
searching eye of government detect
ivee Should congress following ibis
advice in one instance also bring suit
a galas t him for a similar offense in
iiie other
Verily what Is sauce for the goose
is sauce for tko gander The presl
lient of the United States is not the
twkole governmeat But he is the
k1t executive of the government
auonelWould think the sauce poured
eyec such an offending gander should
Jjo quite as ample and quite as tart as
f that dished out to any goose of a
nowpa per in the country
It may be uncertain as to what was
Intended when Postmaster General
Meyer refused to renew Viis order to
have letters addressed to Santa Claus

organizations heretofore nave been 1
LBablo to investigate the various calls

Some Good Suggestions
Among the good suggestions made

All agreed that an official physician
I should ibe installed in the schools and
the matter will the taken up with the

Mr Bull submitted a plan whereby
the grounds of school No i may be
converted into a strictly model and
uptodate school ground His Idea
was accepted if having been decided
to appropriate the sum of2bO for
that purpose Messrs Bradford and
Bull were put In charge of this par

Miss Pauline Reese said that it is
the wish of the city teachers to have
Mr Gibson a prominent Georgian
identified with the w rkjto appear Jn

The distinctive religious work of

good for something Our puhllc re
