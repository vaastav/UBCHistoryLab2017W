After h brief interval t ho Congress
ol' the United States resumes its nil
mini legislative Inborn. An nll-wiso
ninl merciful Piovidenca has abated
the pestilence which visited ourshores,
leaving its calamitous truces upon
somo uirlon of onr country. Peace,
order, tranquility, nnd civil authority
have been i'ortiKilly declared to exist
throughout tho whole of tho United
States. .In all of the State civil au
thority has superseded tho coercion
of arms, und tho people, by their vol
untary action, are. maintaining their
governments in lull-activity anil com
plete operation. Tho enforcement of
the laws is no longer "obstructed in
any Slato by combinations too pow
erful to bo suppressed by the ordinary
course of judicial proceedings;" nnd
tho miiniosities engendered by tho war
nro rapidly yielding to tho Gcniflccnt
influences of our free institutions, and
to the kindly effects of unrestricted
social und commercial intercourse.
An entire restoration of fraternal feel
ing must be the earnest wish of every
patriotic heart; and wo will have
accomplished our grandest national
achievment when, forgetting tho sad
events of the past, and remembering
only their instructive lessons, wo re
sume, our onward career us a free,
prosperous, and united people
ln my niowg of- the 4tb-E-" De
cern her, lsoj, C ongress was inlorm
cd ol the measures which had been
instituted by tho Exccutivo with 3
view to the gradual restoration ol tho
States in which tho insurrection oc
curred, to their relations with the
General Government. Provisional
Governors havo loen appointed, con
ventions called, Governors elected,
Legislatures assembled, and Senators
and Representatives chosen to tho
Congress of the United Stales. Courts
have been opened for the enforcement
of laws long in abeyance. Thu block
ade had been roinoved, custom houses
ro-cstablishcd, and tho intcrnul rev
cnuo laws put in force, in order that
the people might contribute to the
national income. I'ostul operations
had been renewed, and efforts were
being made to restore them to their
former condition of efficiency. Tho
States themselves had been asked to
tako part in thehigh function of amend
ing tho Constitution, and of thus sanc
tioning tho extinction of African shi
very us one of tho legitimate results
of our internecine struggle.
Having progressed thus far, tho Ex
ecutive Department found that it hud
accomplished nearly all that was with
in tho scope of iu constitutional au
thority. One thing, however, jet re
mained to bo done before tho w ink of
restoration could bo completed, and
that was tho admission to Congress of
Joyul Senators and Representatives
from tho States whoso people had re
belled against the lawful authority of
the General Government. This ques
tion developed upon the respective
Houses, which, by the Constitution,
aro made tho judges of tho elections,
returns, and qualifications of their
own members; und its consideration
at once engaged tho attention of Con
gress. Jn the meantime, tho Executive De
partment no other plan having been
proposed by Congress continued its
efforts to perfect, as far as was practi
cable, tho restoration of the proper
relations between the citizens of the
respective States, the Slates and the
Federal Government, extending, from
time to time, as tho public interests
seemed to require, tho judicial, reven
ue, and postal systems of the country
With the advice and consent of the
Senuto, the necessary oflicers were
appointed, and appropriations made
by Congress for tho payment of their
salaries. Tho proposition to amend
tho Federal Constitution, so as to pro
vent the existence of slavery within
tho United States or any plnco sub
ject to their jurisdiction, was ratified
by tho requisito number of States ;
nnd on tho lfth day of December, 1S0.V
it was officially declared to have bo
coino valid as a part of tho Constitu
tion of tho United States. All of the
States in which tho insurrection had
existed promptly amended their Con
stitution!! so as to make them conform
to tho great rhnngo thus effected in
tho organic law of tho land ; declared
null und void all ordinances and laws
of secession; repudiated ull pretended
debts und obligations created for tho
revolutionary purposes of tho insur
rection ; and proceeded, in good faith,
to tho cnacttnont of measures for the
protection and amelioration of the
colored rnco. Congress, howevcr.yet
hesitated to admit any of these Stales
to representation ; and it was not un
til toward tho cloo of tho eighth
month of the session that un excep
tion was made in favor of Tennessee,
ly tho admission of her Senators und
Representatives.
- 1 deem it a subject of profound re
gret that Congress has thus far failed
to admit to seats loyal Senators and
Representatives from tho other State
whoso inhabitants, with those of Ten
nessee, had engaged in tho rebellion.
Ten States more than one-fourth ol
the whole number remain without
representation ; the sontsof fifty mem
bers in tho House of Representatives
nnd of twenty members in tho Sennto
aro yet vacated not by their own
counsel, not by a failure of election,
nit by tho refusal of Congress to ac
cept their credentials. Their admis
sion, it is believed, would have aceem-
X
ishcd much towards the renewal
enn sti
ni'ihoning of our relations as
me people, and removed serious cause
fir discontent on the part of tho in
habitants of thoso Slates. It would
havo accorded with the great princi
ple enunciated in tho Declaration of
American Independence, that no pro
plo ought to bear the burden of taxa
?ion and yet bo denied tho right of ,
i presentation. It would have been j
in consonance with tho express pro-l
n.-:.;r,s of tho Constitution, that "each
Hltito shall have at least ono Repre
sentative," and "'tlint no State, with
out its consent, shall bo deprived of
i's equal suffrage, in the Senate."
Thcso provisions wcro intended to
pecure to every State, and to tho peo.
pie of every State, tho right of repre
sentation in each House of Congress ;
and so important was it deemed hy

ntc should bo preserved, thai not even
!.) an amendment of tho Constitution
can any State, without its consent, bo
denied a voice in that brunch of tho
National Legislature.
It is true, it has boon assumed that
tho cxistenco of thu States was ter
minated by the rebellious acts of their
inhabitants, and that tho insurrection
having been suppressed, they wero
thenceforward to bo considered mcio
ly as conquered territories. The Leg
islative, Executive, and Judicial De
partments of the Government have
however, with grout distinctness and
uniform consistency, refused to sanc
tion an assumption so incompatible
with the nature of our republican sys
tem and with tho professed objects of
the war. Throughout tho recent leg
islation of Congress, the undeniable
(fact tnnktw itseif BopHi eut; that these
ten political communities ore nothing
less thati Stales of tho Union. At
tho very commencement ot thn rebel
lion, euch Houso declared, with a
unanimity as remarkable as it wus sig
nificant, that the war was not "waged,
upon our part, in any spirit of oppres
sion, nor lor uny purposo of conquest
or subjugation, nor purpose of over
throwing or interfering with the
rights or established institutions of
those States, but to defend and main
tain tho supremacy of tho Constitu
tion and all laws made in pursuance
thereof, und to preserve the Union
with ull tho dignity, equality, and
rights of the several States unimpair
ed ; and that as soon as these objects"
wero "accomplished tho war ought to
cease." Insorno instances Senators
wero permitted to continue their leg
islative functions, while in other in
stances Representatives wero elected
nnd udmitted to seats after their States
had formally declared their right to
withdraw from tho Union, and were
endeavoring to maintain that right by
force of arms. All of the Slates
whoso people wero in insurrection, as
States, wero included in tho appor
tionment of tho direct tax of twenty
millions of dollars unnuully laid upon
tho United States by the act approved
b'.h August, 1 SO 1 . Congress by tho
uct ot March 4th, ISO.', und by the
apportionment of representation
thereunder, also recognized their
presence as Slates in thu Union; and
they have, for judicial purposes, been
divided into districts, as States alone
can bo divided. The samo recogni
tion appears in tho recent legislation
in referenco to Tennessee, which evi
dently rests upon tho fact that the
functions of the State were not do
stroyed by the rebellion, but merely
suspended; and that principle is of
eourso npplieublo to those Mates
which, like Tennessee, attempted to
renounce their places in tho Union.
Tho action of the Executive De
partment of tho Government upon
this subject has been equally definite
und uniform, and the purpose of tho
war was specifically stated in the
proclamation issued by my prede
cessor or. tho 22d day of September,
lKi2. It was then solmnly declared
that "hereafter, as heretofore, tho war
will bo prosecuted for tho object of
practically restoring the constitution
al relation between tho United Slates
and each of tho States und the people
thereof, in which Stales that relation
is or may bo suspended or disturbed."
The recognition of tho States by the
Judicial Department of tho Govern
ment has also been clear and conclu
sive in all proceedings affecting them
as States, had in the Supremo, Circuit
and District Courts.
In tho admission of Senators and
Representatives from any and all of
the Slates, thoro can be nojust ground
of apprehension that pursuits who uro
disloyal will bo clothed with tho pow
ers of legislation ; for this could not
happen when tho Constitution and
tho laws uro enforced by a vigilant
and faithful Congress. Each Houso
is mado tho "judgo of the elections,
returns, and qualifications of its own
members," and may, "with the con
currence of two-thirds, expel a mem
ber." When a Senator or representa
tive presents his certificate of elec
tion, he may at nrco bo admitted or
rejected; or, should there beany ques
tion as to his eligibility, his creden
tials may be referred for investigation
to the appropriate committee. If ad
mitted to a seat, it must bo upon evi
dence satisfactory to tho Houso of
which he becomes a member, that he
possesses tho requisite constitutional
and legal qualifications. If refused
admission a a member for want of
duo iillegiaiice to tho Government, and
returned to his constituents, they arc
admonished that none but persons loy
al to tho United States will bo allow
ed a voieo in tho legislative councils
of tho nation, and the political power
and moral influence of Congress aro
thus effectively exerted iu the interest
of loyally to tho Government and
fidelity to tho Union. Upon thisques
tion, so vitally affecting tho restora
tion of tho Union and tho permanen
cy of our present form of government.
my convictions, heretofore expressed,
have undergone no change; but, on
tho contrary, their correctness has
been confirmed by reflection and ;
time. If tho admission of loyal mem
bers to seats in the respective Houses
,.r ... ..,l ...... ,i;....i
Ul V Ulll ,"n wm w ise 111111 vji ui. lit a
year ago, it is no less wiso nnd expe
dient now. If this anomalous condi
tion is right now if, in the exuet con
dition of these Slates at tho present
time, it is lawful tocxcludo them from
representation, 1 do not sco that the;
question w ill bo changed hy tho elllux
of tiino. Ten years henco, if these
Slates remain as they are, tho right
of representation will bo no stronger
tho right of exclusion will be no
weaker.
The Constitution of the United
Stales makes it the duty of tho Pres
ident ( recommend to the considera
ELI
tion of Congrns "such measures as ho
shall judgo necessary or expedient."
I know of no measure more impera
tively demanded by every considera
tion of national interest, sound poli
cy, and equal justice, than tho admis
sion of loyal members from the now
unrepresented States. This would
consummate the work of restoration,
and exert a inoro salutary influence
in tho re-establiHhment of peace, har
mony and fraternal feeling. It would
tend greatly to renew the confidence
of tho American people in tho vigor
and stability of their institutions. It
would bind us more closely together
as a nation, and enable us to show to
tho world tho inherent recuperative
power of a Government founded upon
tho will of the people, and established
i upon the principles of liberty,, justice
fluid" Intelligein c. Our increased
strength nnd enhanced prosperity
would irrefragiibly demonstrate the
fallacy of the arguments against free
institutions drawn from our recent
national disorders by the enemies of
republican government. Tho admis
sion of loyal tneinbere from the States
now excluded from Congress, by al
laying doubt and apprehension, would
turn capital, now awaiting an oppor
tunity for investment, into the chan
nels of trade and industry. It would
alleviate tho present condition of
those States, and by inducing emigra
tion, aid in the settlement of fertile
regions now uncultivated, and lead to
un increased production or thoso stft
pics which havo added so greatly to
llio wealth ol the nation and tho com
merco of the world. 2s'ew fields of
enterprise would bo opened to our
progressive people, and soon tho de
vastations of war would bo repaired,
and all traces of our domestic differ
ences effaced from tho minds of our
countrymen.
In our efforts to preserve "tho unity
of Government which constitutes us
ono people," by restoring the States
to the condition which they held prior
to tho rciielhon, we should lie cautious,
lest, having rescued our nation from
perils of threatened disintegration,
we resort to consolidation, and iu the
end uhsolufo despotism, as a remedy
for the recurrence of similar troubles.
The war having '.el ntinated, and with
it till occasion for the exercise of pow
ers of doiibllul constitutionality, we
hasten to bring legislation within t lie
boundaries prescribed by the Consti
tution, nnd to the ancient landmarks
established by our fathers for tho
guidance of future generations. "The
Constitution which ut any tinto exists,
until changed by an explicit and au
thentic act of tho whole people, is sa
credly obligatory upon all." "If, in
the opinion of tho people, the dis
tribution or inoditii'ulion of tho con
stitutional powers be, in any particu
lar, wrong, let it. bo corrected by an
amendment in tho way in which the
Constitution designates. Rut let there
be no change by usurpation, for it is
tho customary weapon by which free
governments are destroyed." Wash
ington spoke these words to his coun
trymen, when, followed by their love
und gratitude, ho voluntarily retired
from tho cures of public life. "To
keep, in nil things, within tho pale of
our constitutional powers, and cherish
tho Federal Union us tho only rock of
safety," wcro prescribed by Jefferson
us rules of action to endear to his
"countrymen tho truo princfples of
their Const it ution, and promote a
union of sentiment and action equally
auspicious to their happiness and
safely." Jackson held that the ut tion
of tho General Government should
always bo strictly confined to the
sphere of its npiiropriato duties, and
justly and forcibly urged that our Go
vernment is not to lie maintained nor
our union preserved "by invasion of
tho rights and powers of tho several
States, lit thus attempting to make
our General Government strong, we
m also it weak. Its truo strength con
sists in leaving individuals and States
as much us possible to themselves ;
and making itself felt, not in its pow
er, but in its beneficence ; not in its
control, but in its protection; not in
binding tho States more closely to the
centre, but leaving each to tliovo un
obstructed in its proiicrcons'itutiouul
orbit." Thoso are the teachings of
men A'hoso deeds and services have
r.ado them illustrious, anil w ho, long
sitico withdrawn from scenes of lile,
have left to their country tho rich
legacy of their example, thoir wisdom
and their patriot ism. Drawing fresh
inspiration from their lessons, let us
emulalo them in lovo of country and
respect for tho Constitution nnd laws.
Tho report, of tho Secretary of the
Treasury affords much information
respecting tho revenue and commerce
of tho country. His views upon the
currency, and with referenco to a pro
per adjustment of our revenue system,
internal ns well us impost, are com
mended to tho careful consideration of
Congress. In my last annual message
I expressed my general views upon
these subjects. 1 need now only call
attention to tho necessity of carrying
into every department of tho Govern
ment a system of rigid accountability,
through retrenchment and wise econ
omy. Willi no exceptional nor unu
sual expenditures, the oppressive, bur
dens ol taxafion can bo lessened by
such a mollification of our revenue
laws us will be consistent with the
public faith and tho legitimato and
necessary wants of tho Government.
The report presents a much more
satisfactory condition of our finances
than one year ago the most sanguine
could huvo anticipated. During the
fiViil yoarending tho HUth Juno, Ixil.'t,
tho last year of the war, the public
debt was increased f'.lll,9ll,.rt:.7, and
on the Hist of Oct. 1 xt". at amounted
to ?2,7l(-i,K-,4,7;'i(l. On the 8lst. Oct.,

period of fourteen months, commen
cing September I,lfli5, and ending
Oct. 31,lxtW,huving been SlWO.riT'J.fiO.Y
In tho last annual report on the state
of the finances, it wus estimated that
during tho three quarters of tho fiscul
year ending the iiuih June last, tho
debt would bo increased tl 12,114,!) 17.
During that period, however, it was
reduced t'!l,l,3S7, tho receipts of
tho year have been $K!),9n,),0U5 more,
and tho expenditures $2i;tl,5jy,235 less
than the estimates. Nothing could
more clearly indicate than these state
ments tho extent ftind availihility of
tho national resources, and tho rapid
ity with which, fuller our form of
government, great military and naval
establishments can bo disbanded, and
expenses reduced from a war to

that tho receipts for the fiscal year
ending the 30th of Juno, lso7, will be
$170,001, oW,and that theexpenditures
will reach tho sum of 3lrt,4iS.u7K,

ending June 8U, lfl it is estimated
that tho receipts will amount to

excess of f S5.7.V' 3')!J in fuvor of the
Government lliee estimated re
ceipts may bo diinini-'ied by a reduc
tion of excise and import duties; but
utter all necessary reductions shall
have been inude, the revenue of the
present and of the following years will
doubtless be sufficient to cover ull
legitimate charges upon the Treasury,
and leave a large annual surplus to f.e
applied to the payment of tho principal
of the debt. There seems t.ow to he
no good reason why taxes may not be
reduced as tho country advances in
population and wealth, and yet tho
debt bo cxting.ii-hed within the next
quarter of a century.
The report of the Secretary of War
furnishes valuable and important in
formation in reference to the opera
lions of his Department during the
past year. Few volunteer now re
main in the service, and they aro being
discharged us rapidly us they can be
replaced by regulur troops. The army
has been promptly paid, carefully
provided with medical treatment, well
shcllercd and subsisted, and is to be
furnished with breech loading small
arms. Tho military strength of the
nation has been unimpaired by the
discharge of volunteers, thedisjHisilion
of unserviceable or pernshublts stores,
anil the retrenchment of expenditure.
Sufficient wur inaler.ul to meet uny
emergency has bee returned, and
from tho disbanded volunteers land
ing ready to respond to the iiationul
call, largo armies can bo rapidly or
ganised, equipped und concentrated.
Fortifications on tho coast or frontier
havo received, or are being prepared
for, mora powerful armaments ; hike
surveys and l.arhorand river improve
ments are in course of cneryelic pros
ecution. Preparations havo been made
tor tho payment of tho additional
bounties authorized during tho recent
session of Congress, under such regu
lations nswill protect the Government
from fraud, and secure to the honora
bly discharged soldier the well-earned
reward of Ins faithfulness and gallan
try. More than (i.illlll maimed soldiers
havo received artificial limlis or other
surgical appurafus; and forly-ono na

already been established. Tho total

It is staled in tho report of the
Secretary ol the Navy that the naval
force at this time consists of two hun
dred and seventy-eight vessels, armed
with two thousand three hundred and
filly-eight guns. Of these, one hun
dred and fifteen vessels, carrying one
thousand and twenty-nine guns, arc
in commission, distributed chiefly
among seven squadrons. Tho number
of men in tho servieo is thirteen thou
sand six hundred. Great Activity and
vigilance havo been displayed ly all
the squadrons, and their movements
havo been judiciously and efficiently
arranged in such manner us would
best promote American comincrcc.and
protect tho rights and interests of our
countrymen abroad. Tho vessels em
ployed nro undergoing repairs, or arc
laid up until their services may bo ro
V uired.
Jlost of tho iron clad fleet is at
Leaguo Island, in the vicinity of Phil
adelphia, a placo which, until decisive
action should bo taken by Congress,
was selected by the Secretary of the
Navy, as tho most eligiblo sight for
that class of vessels. It is important
that a suitable public, station should
be prov'ded for tho iron-clud fleet. It
is intended that theso vessels shall be
in proper condition for ry emergency,
and it is desirnblu that the hill accept
ing League Island lor T'iival purposes,
w hich passed tho House of llepreeiit
tives at its last session, should receive
final action ut un early period,in order
that there may bo u suitable public
station for this class of vssc)s, as well
as a navy -yard of area sufficient for
tho wants of tho service, on the Dela

amounts to H l,7."ill.0il0, having in

of Congress,

Tho report of the Postmaster Gen
eral presents a most satisfactory con
dition of tho postal service, and sub
mits recommendations which deserve
tho consideration of Congress. The
revenues of tho Department for the
year ending Juno 30, DSfiO, were

latter of g'.tOo.Ofl.l. In anticipation of
this deficiency, however, a special ap

8700,000 for freo ruuil mutter us a
legitimate portion of the revenues yet

tho annual transportation 30,V'!I,4G7.
i lie length ot steamboat routes is
14,340 miles, and tho annual trans

service is rapidly increasing through
out the whole country, and its steady
extention iu the Southern States indi
cates their constantly improving con
dition. The growing importance of
tho foreign service ulso merits atten
tion. The Post Office Department of
Great Britain and ourown havcogreed
upon a preliminary basis for a I'ostul
Convention, w hich it is believed will
provo eminently beneficial to the com
mercial interests of the United States,
inasmuch us it contemplates a reduc
tion of the international letter postage
to one-half tho existing rates; a re
duction of "postage with all other
countries to and from which corre
spondence is transmitted in the British
mail, or in closed mails through the
United Kingdom; the establishment
of uniform and reasonable charges for

the same terms as those applicable to
tho inhabitants of the country provid
ing the mean of transmission.
'J'ho report uf Uo Secretary of the
Interior exhibits the condition ot those
brunches of the public servieo which
uro committed to his supervision.
During tho last fiscal year, 4,029,312
acres of public land wero disposed of,
l,M2,MtJ acres of which were entered
under the homestead act. The policy
originally adopted relative to the pub
lic hinds has undergone essentiul modi
fications. Immediate revenue, and
not their rapid settlement, was the
origiuul feat ure of our land system.
Lung cxiiericiice and earnest discus
sion have resulted in the conviction
that tho early development of our
ogriculturul resources, and the diffu
sion of un energetic population over
our vast territory, are objects of a lar
greater importance to tho national
growth and prosperity than the pro
ceeds of the sale of the land to tho
highest bidder in open market. The
pre emption laws confer upon the pio
neer who complies with tho terms
they impose tho privilege of purchas
ing a limited portion of "unoffcred
land" at the minimum price. The
homestead enactments relievo the
settler from tho payment of pun hose
money, and securo him a permanent
home, upon tho condition of residence
for a term of jears. This liberal
policy invites emigration fiomtheold,
and from tho more crowded portions
of the new world. Its propitious re
sults aro undoubted, und w ill be more
signally manifested when time shall
have given to it a wider development.
t. ongress nas mono uncrui grants oi
public lauds to corporations, in aid of
tho constrni tion of railroad and other
internal improvements. Should this
policy hereafter ptcvuil, more stringent
provisions will bo required to secure a
faithful application ol the fund. The
title to tho Innds should not jiass, by
palenl or otherwise, but remain in the
Government and subject to its control
until some portion of tho roiul has
been nctiinlly built. Portions of them
might then, nnd from tiino to time,
be conveyed to the corporation, but
never in greater ratio to tho whole
quantity embraced by the grant than
the completed parts bear to tho entire
length ol the projected improvement.
Tho restriction would not operate to
the prejudice of and undertaking on-.
ceived in good faith and executed with '
reasonable eiieny, as it is tho settled
practice to withdraw from market tho
lands falling wilhin the operation of
such grants, and thus to exclude the
inception of a subsequent adverse
right. A breach of tho conditions;
which Congress may deem proper to
impose should work a forfeiture of
claim to the lands so withdrawn but
uneonveyed, and of title to the lands
which remain unsold.
Operations on the several lines of
the Pacific liuilroad havo been prose
cuted with unexampled vigorami suc
cess. Should no unforeseen causes of
delay oeeur.it is confidently anticipat
ed that the great thoroughfare ill
be completed before tho expiration of
the period designated by Congress.
During tho last fiscul year the
amount paid to pensioners, includiag
tho expenses of disbursement, was
thirteen millions four hundred and
fifty nine thousand iiino hundred and
ninety six dollars, and fifty thousand
one hundred and seventy seven names
were added to the pension rolls. The
entire number of pensioners, June 30,
lHfiti, was one hundred and twenty-
six inousaiid seven hundred and tw en
ty-two. This fact furnishes inelan
choly and striking proof of the sao-
nhces tuude to vindicate tho const it u
tional authority of tho Federal Gov
eminent, and to maintain, inviolate,
the integrity of the Union. They
impose upon us corresponding obliga
tions. It is estimated that thirty
three million dollars will be required
to meet the exigencies of this brunch
of tho service during the next fiscul
year.

During the year ending September

A a subject upon which depends an
immense a nount of production and
commerce of tho country, I recom
mend to Congress such legislation as
may be necessary for the proservition
of the levees of the Mississippi river.
It is a matter of national importance
that early steps should be taken not
only to add to the efficiency of these
barriers against destructive inunda
tions, but lor the removal of all ob
structions to tho free and safo naviga
tion of that great channel of trade and
commerce.
The District of Columbia, under
existing laws is not entitled to that
representation iu the National Coun
cils which, from our earliest history,
has been uniformly accorded to each
Territory established from time to
time wilhin our limits. It maintains
peculiur relations to Congress, to
whom tho Constitution has granted
the power of exercising legislation
over tho seat of government. Our
fellow-cilir.ens residing in the District,
w hoso interests aro thus confided to
tho special guardianship of Congress,!
exceed in number the population of
several ol our ierritones, and no just
reason is perceived why a delegate of
their choice should not be admitted to
a seat in tho House of Representatives.
No mode seems so appropriate and
effectual of cnubling them to make
known their peculiar condition and
wanUMiiid securing the local legislation
adapted to them. I, therefore, recom
mend the passage of a law authorizing
the electors of the District of Colum
bia to choose a delegate, to Iks allowed
the same rights und privileges as a
delegate representing a Territory.
The increasing enterprise and rapid
progress of improvement in the Dis
trict are highly gratifying, and 1 trust
that the efforts of the municipal au
thorities to promote the prosperity of
the national metropolis will receive
the efficient and generous co operation
of Congress.
1 tie report of tbo Commissioner of

It is a suhiect of congratulation thu'.
no foreign combinations oguinst our
domestic peace and safety, or our lo-
gilimato liimicncc among the nations,
have been formed or attempted. While
sentiment of reconciliation, loyalty
andpatri'dism have increased at home,
more just consideration ot our na
tional chaructcr'und rights has been
manifested hy foreign nations.
I lio entire success of tho Atlantic
Telegraph between the Coast of Ire
land and tho provinco of Newfound
land, is an achievement which has
justly been celebrated in both hemis
pheres as the opening ot an era in the
progress of civilization. There is rea
son to expect that equal success will
attend, and even greater results fol
low, the enterprise forconnecling the
two continents through tho Pucific
oeoun by the projected line of telegraph
belween Kuntpschatka and the Rus
sian possession in America.
Tho resolution of Congress protest
ing against pardons by foreign Gov
ernments of persons convicted of in
famous offences, on condition of emi
gration to our country, has been Com
municated to the States with which
wo maintain intercourse, and the
practice, so justly the subject of com
pluiut on our jiurt, has not been re
newed. The congratulations of Congress to
the Emperor of Russia, upon his escape
from attempled assnssinution, have
been presented to that humane and
enlightened ruler, ami received by
him with expressions of grateful ap
preciation. Tho Executive, warned of an at
tempt by Sjuinish-Aiiierican adven
turers to induce I ho emigration of
freednien of Ibo United Slates to a
foreign country, protested against the
project as one which, if consummated,
would reduce thorn to a bondage even
more oppressive than thnt fiom which
they have just been relieved. Assu
rance has been received from tho Gov
eminent of the State in w hich the plan
was matured, that the proceeding w ill
ineel neither its encouragement nor
approval. It is a question worthy of
your consideration, whether our laws,
upon this subject aro adequate to the
prevention or punishment of the crime
thus meditated.
In tho month of April lust, as Con
gress is aware, a friendly arrangement
was mado between tho Emperor cl'J
Frau'-e and the President of tbo Uni
ted States for the withdraws! from
Mexico of the French exelitionary
military force. riii withdrawal was
to ho effected in thrco detachments,
tho first of which, It was understood,
would leave Mexico in November,
now pi'St, the second in March nxt,
and the third and last in November,
1H07. Immediately upon the comple
tion of the evacuation, the French
Government was to assume tho sumo
attitude of non-intervention, in regard
to Mexico, as is held by the Govern
mctit of tho United States. Repeated
assurance have been given by tho
Emperor, since that agreement, that
ho would eompleto tho promised evacu
ation within tho period mentioned, or
sooner.
It was reasonably expected that tho
proceedings thus contemplated would
produu a crisis of great political in
terest in the Republic of Mexico. The
newly apjsointed Minister of the Uni
ted Stales, Mr. Campbell, was there
fore aunt forward, on the 9tfl day of
November last, to assunio his proper
funelions as Minister Plenipotentiary
of tho United States to that Republic.
It was also thought expedient that ho
should he attended in the vicinity of
Mexico by the Lieutenant General of
tho Army of tho United Stutes, with
the view of obtaining such information
as might be important to determine
the policy of the United States in re
establishing and "maintaining necessa-"
ry and proper intercourse with tho
Republic of Mexico. Deeply interest
ed in the cause of liberty and humani
ty, it Boomed an obvious duty on our
part to exercise whatever influence
wo possessed for the restoration and
permanent establishment in that coun
try of a domestic and republican form '
or government.
Such was the condition of affairs in
regard to Mexico, when en the 22d of
November last, officiul information
was received from Paris thut the Em
peror of Franco had some tiino before
decided not to withdraw a detachment
of his forces in the month of Novem
ber past.according tocngagement.but
that this decision was made with the
purpose of withdrawing the whole
force in the ensuing spring. Of this
determination, however, the United
Stales hud not received any notice or
inlimatiou ; and, as son;, as the infor
mation was received by the Govern
ment, care was taken to make known
iu dissent to the Emperor of France.
1 cannot lorego the hope that t ranee
w ill reconsider the subject, and adopt
some resolmion in regard to tho evac
uation of Mexico which will conform
as nearly as practicable with the ex
isting engagement, and thus meet the
just expectations of the United States.
The paHrs relating to the subject w ill
be laid before you ll is believed that
with the evacuation of Mexico by the
expeditionary lorccs, no sui.ject lor
serious differences between France
and the United Slates would remain.
The expressions of the Emperor and
tho people of Franco warrant a bone
that tho traditionary friendship be
tween the two countries might in that
case bo renewed and permanently re
stored. A claim of a citizen of the United
States for indemnity for spoliations
committed on the high sous by the
French authorities, iu tbo xorciso of
a iKalligerant power against Mexico,
has been met by the Government of
Franco with a proposition to defer
settlement until a mutual convention
for tho adjustment of all claims of cit
izens and subjects of both countries,
arising out of the recent wars on this
continent shall be agreed upon by the
two countries. The suggestion is not
deemed unreasonable, but it belongs
to Congress to direct the manner in
which cluims for indemnity by for
eigners, as well as by tho citizens i f
the United States, arising out of the
late civil war, shall be adjudicated and
determined. I have no doubt that the
subject of all such claims will engage
your attention at a convenient and
proper time.
It is a matter of regret that no con
siderable advance hns been mado to
wards an adjustment of tho differences
between the United States and Great
Rrituin, arising out ot the depreda
tions on our nalionul commerce and
other trespasses committed during our
civil war by British subjects, in viola
tion of international law and treaty
obligations. The delay, however, may
be believed to have resulted in no
small degree from the domestic situa
tion of Great Rritain. An entire
change of ministry occurred in that
country during the lust session of
Parliument. The attention of the new
ministry was ca led to tho subject at
an early day, and there is some reason
to expect that it will now be consid
ered in a becoming and friendly spirit.
The importance ot an early disposition
of the question cannot be exaggerated.
Whatever might Is? the w ishes of the
two Governments, it is manifest that
good-will and friendship between the
two countries cannot be established
until a reciprocity, in the practice f
gold faith and neutrality, shall be re
stored between tho resHctive nations.
On the Ct h of June lust, in violulbn
of our neutrality laws, a military ex
pedition ntid enterprise against the
Uritish North American Colonies was
projected and attempted to lie carried
on within the territory and jurisdic
tion of the United States. In obedi
ence to tho obligation imposed upon
tho Executive by the Constitution to
see that tNe laws are faithfully execu
ted, all citinens were warned, by proc
lamation, against taking part in or
aiding such unlawful proceedings, and
the proper civil, military and liavai
officers were directed to take all nec
essary measures for the enforcement
of the laws. The expedition failed,
but it has not been without itspuinful
consequences. Some of Our citizens
who, it was alleged, were engaged in
the expedition, wero raptured and
have been brought to trial, as for a
capital offense, in tho Province of Can
ada. Judgment and sentence of death
have been pronounced nguinst some,
while others huvo been acquitted.
Fully lielioving in tho maxim ol gov
ernment, that severity of civil punish
ment for misguided persons who havo
engaged in revolutionary attempts
which dis'islcroiisly failed, is unsound
and unwise, such representations have
been made to the HritishGovemment,
in behalf of the convicted persons, as,
being sustained by an enlightened
and humane judgracct,will, it is hoped,
