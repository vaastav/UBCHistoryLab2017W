Senator Warren of Wyoming, favor
the leasing of the public domain to ttv
big cattle owners. This is not strange,
the senator is a cattle baron himself,
and can be counted upon to look after
his own Interests.

Fifty years ago he would have been

There may be some things to be said
in favor of Chinese immigration. Be
that as it may, the fact remains that
the great majority of the people of the
United States do not want such. That
being the case, congress should speedi
ly re-enact the Chinese exclusion act.
Eastern New Mexico is making a
record in the direction of homestead
entries on government land. This
another indication, which shows that
the territory's population Is steadily on
the increase and that there is a good
deal of desirable land left for home'
steaders.
Congress is taking everything very
easy and will do so until after the hoii
day recess. Then it will have to work
hard whether it will or not. New Mex
ico is greatly interested in the session
of the 57th congress on account of the
pending bills for an enabling act for
the territory.
The publication of the transaction
and business accounts of the big trusts
in the country would enable the people,
the state government and the federal
administration to get at the inside
workings of the trusts. Too much pub
licity is one of the things that trusts
fear more than anything else.
There has been no delinquent tax
list published in this county for the
past two years, although the revenue
law is very stringent and clear and
commands the publication of delin
quent tax lists every six months. Were
the requirements of the law carried out
as they should be several of the coun
ties and especially Santa Fe county,
could be in a much better financial fix,
Forty thousand acres of land have
been purchased in Oklahoma for a col
ony of 1,000 German families who will
devote themselves to cultivating sugar
beets for beet sugar factories. As there
are 500,000 men who are willing to
work out of work in Germany at pres
ent and as the Germans make good
farmers, especially of sugar beets, it
would not be a bad idea to induce a
colony or two of Germans to give New
Mexico a trial.
The Deming Herald has positive as
surance that a large smelter is to be
built at Deming and that the building
of the El Paso and Southwestern rail
road at Deming was on account of the
proposed smelter. It seems as if Dem

Is the only city in New Mexico that
has four railroads and with a big smel

tain to become the metropolis of south

If the world Is to be made any bet
ter by resolutions, the American Fed
eration of Labor will do it. Something
like sixty resolutions were introduced
yesterday at the convention of that
body. The American people are great
on resolutions and there is no conven
tion among the thousands held every
year that does'nt adopt something in
the line of resolutions, expressing sen
timents all the way from the grotesque
and chimerical to practical common
sense.
Representative Curtis of Kansas, is
to the front again with his Buffalo
Park bill, to sat aside 100,000 acres in
New Mexico for the purpose of a. buffa
lo reservation.' It seems strange that
Curtis' philanthropy should extend to
New Mexico when he might And 100,000
acres in Kansas that would be admir
ably adapted for a buffalo or any other
kind of national park. New Mexico
has enough government reservations
by this time and has not 100,000 acres
to spare for Representative Curtis" pet
scheme while Kansas is still without a
single federal reservation of any size.
A New Phase in the Railroad Situation.
It is now asserted and with some
show of reason, that the Santa Fe Rail
road company is in back of the El .Paso
and Southwestern railway and not the
Rock Island and Pacific. During the
recent railway unpleasantness at Dem
ing, ninety cars of El Paso and South
western freight were taken from the
Santa Fe tracks and the Southern Pa
cific in retaliation tore up not only the
El Paso and Southwestern switch but
also the Santa Fe switch. The Santa
Fe has granted the El Paso and South
western its water privileges and is
showing its friendliness to the new
road in more than one way, while the
Southern Pacific manifests its animosi
ty toward the Santa Fe as well as the
El Paso and Southwestern. If these
surmises are correct, then a new inter
est is added to the southwestern rail
road situation and a line from a point
south of Roswell to Deming seems to
be one of the necessary next steps of
the Santa Fe system, which will put it
on the same footing as the Rock Isl
and as far as distances to southern
New Mexico and Arizona and event
ually California are concerned, for no
one believes that the El Paso and
Southwestern will have its permanent
terminus at Bisbee or any other min
ing camp in Arizona, but that it is to
form a junction and is part of the rail
road scheme of the surveyed line from
San Diego to Phoenix.

"My business as proprietor of the Lyceum Shell Oyster Parlor, 245 Main

that my lungs became affected. My doctor told me I'd have to leave the store
and go to work at some

my lung's were in bad

just as well as he did.
The trouble had been
growing on me for a
long time. Like most
other people, I tried to
make myself believe
the trouble was not in
the lungs. I called it
stomach trouble or ner

kept coughing, spitting

falling from 140 to 115
pounds. Somehow or
other, I got hold of Ack

ten pounds more than ever. After recovering, I applied for a life insurance
policy. When the doctor began examining me, I was afraid he would discover
that my lungs had once been affected, but he didn't. I passed all right, and
was pronounced in a first-class condition. If that isn't proof of the most posi

OPEN AIR FOR CONSUMPTIVES
To Fight the International Dam and National
Lease Law Schemes.
As was to be expected, Senator Cul
berson and Representative Stephens of
Texas, have introduced bills providing
for the construction, by the government
of the United States, of an internat
ional dam at EI Paso. Incidentally
these bills contain provisions for no
person to construct new ditches or to
take any water from the Rio Grande
river and its tributaries in New Mexi
co, in addition to that already appro
priated. Senator Culberson and Repre
sentative Stephens do not care a conti
nental red cent for the well being of
the people of this territory. What is
needed in New Mexico is a state gov
ernment with two men to represent the
state in the United States senate. Had
New Mexico such representation it
could well afford to laugh at Senator
Culberson's and Mr. Stephens' schemes;
but as it is, the citizens of the territory
will have to work as a whole to de
feat these nefarious schemes. Many
citizens are of the opinion that a con
vention should be called to meet at an
early date at the capital to pass strong
resolutions asking the defeat of the in
ternational dam project and also to
nrotest against the enactment 01 a
national lease law. A delegation to
work against this proposed legislation
should be selected and sent to Wash-
ngton to aid Delegate Rodey in bring-
ng about the defeat of these, to New
Mexico very detrimental, unjust
unfair, measures.
and
French scientists have demonstrated
with the aid of balloons that the red
blood corpuscles in man's blood in
crease with altitude and the higher the
altitude that a man can bear with
comfort the better it is for him, espec
ially if he suffers from lung or other
constitutional disease. That is one of
the reasons why Santa Fe offers the
very best chances of cure for con
sumptives. It provides any altitude
from 6,000 to 13,000 feet within a cir
cumference of twenty miles.
When all the contemplated improve
ments of the Colorado Fuel and Iron
company are completed at Pueblo, Col
orado, it will employ 25,000 men, who
will support a population of 125,000.
This is only one of Pueblo's big indus
tries and Denver will have to hurry to
keep up with Pueblo. Yet, a few de
cades ago, Pueblo was an adobe vil
lage without one-tenth of the possibil
ities, advantages and resources of
Santa Fe. There are several other so
called slow, adobe towns in the great
west which will awaken some morning
to find themselves growing at so rapid
a rate that it will kill off the pessi
mists and the croakers over night.
The success of the marine sanitarium
at Fort Stanton and of the United
States military hospital and sanitarium
at For Bayard emphasizes the fact that
New Mexico possesses the best climate
in the world for the cure of consump
tion and kindred diseases. In fact,
gome of the cures at Fort Stanton and
at Fort Bayard border on the miracu
lous. It is the dry air, the altitude,
the perpetual sunshine complemented
by gentle outdoor exercise, outdoor
living, regularity of habits, the pre
vention of reinfection and the eating of
large quantities of substantial food
which will effect the cure of consump
tion In almost every case that is sent
The Insular Decisions.
The decisions of the United States
supreme court in the last of the insu
lar cases, the "diamond rings cases,"
affecting the status of the Philippines,
nd the "second Dooley cases," involv
ing the constitutionality of the Forak-
er act levying duties on goods imported
into Porto Rico from the United States
simply follow the principles laid
down in the De Lima and 'first Dooley
cases. So far from being a defeat for
the government, as some Democratic
headliners hastened to announce yes
terday, it is really a final and decisive
triumph for the important political
contentions of the administration. The
decisions affirm the power of congress
to enact tariff laws for Porto Rico and
the Philippines, and only on the claim
that the executive had power to levy
duties without the legislative authority
of congress is the government beaten.
The broad principles established by
the supreme court in these insular cas
es may be thus briefly summarized:
1. The constitution does not follow the
flag "ex proprio vigore," but only
through the direct act of congress,
2. The extension of the sovereignty of
the United States to new territory car
ries with it the constitutional guaran
tees of the enjoyment of liberty and the
right to property, but does not confer
full political citizenship
3. The islands acquired from Spain by
the treaty of Paris are "property of
the United States" in the strict sense
in which the term is used in the con
stitution, and congress can legislate re-
gardigng them, as to tariff or other
matters, in any way it deems best for
the inhabitants thereof or for the
United States.
Thus Uncle Sam can and does own
three distinct kinds of territory, in
volving three degrees of citizenship,
namely:
1. The states proper, the citizens of
which possess full and sovereign po
litical power.
2. Incorporated territories, the citi
zens of which possess restricted politi
cal power, in that they cannot vote
for presidential electors.
3. Unincorporated territory, or, in
the words of the supreme court, "terri
tory belonging to or appurtenant to
the United States," the inhabitants of
which cannot become citizens until
congress expressly extends to it all the
provisions of the constitution. '
The only difference between the cases
of Porto, Rico and the Philippines was

Sanitarium, which has been established
in a Denver suburb since last March,
has made a report which will doubtless
prove interesting to tuberculosis spec
ialists in all parts of the country. The
sanitarium follows the fresh air course
of treatment, the idea being to keep the
patients out of doors as much as pos
sible. The institution is in the nature
of a co-operative colony, and each
member is called on to contribute a
certain amount of labor to the support
of the whole. Gardening, fruit raising,
and lighter forms of carpenter work
have occupied the attention of the pa
tients, and not only have they all im
proved greatly in health, but the colo
ny has proved self-supporting from the
start.
This is a vast improvement on the
"tent cure" which has met with the
commendation of eastern physicians of
late, inasmuch as work takes the pa
tient's mind off his condition and there
by undoubtedly hurries his improve
ment. Such a plan is possible, howev
er, only in climates where there is
plenty of sunshine, hence the success
of the Colorado colony will probably
be equaled in few other states.

An Undoubted Benefit to Consumptives Is
Derived from Altitude,
Rocky Mountain News.
Those thorough-going French scien
tists who have been conducting exper
iments in balloons, with a view to es
tablishing the relation of high altitudes
to disease, have reached some interest
ing conclusions. Guinea pigs and oth
er animals that have been taken up to
great heights have shown a steady and
large increase in the number of blood
corpuscles, thereby proving the claim
of mountain sanitariums that there is
nothing like high altitudes for anaemic
persons. The French scientists migm
have accomplished the same results by
conducting their experiments at any
mountain resort, but the French are
nothing if not spectacular, even in
science, hence the balloons were chosen
as the most effective means to demon
strate a scientific fact.
The result of the French balloon ex
periments has been proved in the Roc
ky mountains, In the Alps, and in
1 other mountain resorts in many coun
tries. The benefits of high altitudes
have been unmistakable, in cases of
general anaemia, but the exact effect
of poverty of oxygen on the blood have
never been determined. For this rea
son it is to be hoped that the daring ex
periments of the Intrepid French scien
tists will be concluded without accident.

afflicted with spasmodic asthma for the past twelve years. Having exhausted my

free from all symptoms. I feel that I can consistently recommend the medicine

Two taxpayers were arguing on the
street last Saturday about their taxes,
and one of them was heard to say he
had lost $4.80 by paying his taxes
promptly on time. Being asked for an
explanation he said his taxes amount
ed to about $120. He paid the first half
last December and the last half in
June to avoid the penalty. His money
was worth 12 per cent, and interest on
his money would by January 1 amount
to $10.80. Had he failed to pay, his to
tal penalty would amount now to ex
actly $6, so he is out the $4.80. Of
course he paid on the supposition that
his property would be sold according
to law If he did not pay, but there has
been no delinquuent tax sale in this
county this year. Of course we would
not advise a taxpayer to try this every
year, but the non-payer is the winner

My wife was siok for three years. We tried
verything without relief and snant much
money. My wife tried Wine of Oardul and four
bottles ouied her. She took two mora bottles,
knowing she would have to work hard during
the hay harvest. She attended to all her home

get about, but since she has been taking Wine
of Oardul she feels better and stronger than
when 20 years of age. JOS. A. EI8BNHAFBB.
