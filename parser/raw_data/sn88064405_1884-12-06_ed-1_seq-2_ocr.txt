V., 8. & P. R. R.
The management of this road,
have at last settled down to work,
and the raising of the road bedal is!
in progress. The part west of Dlelhi
- will be attended to first and then
the section between D )elhi and I Delta
- will be raised. A train lhad of con
victs, and their llulnder went west
- last Saturday, and early in January
tIO convicts are expected to be at
- work.
S'The plan of raising the sectionl
R of road between lhelhii atl Monroe I
- first, would seem at tirst sight to
be, a sort of hind part before ar
- ralngeent. awl the tonlly collllOll
sense view to take of it is, that the
company is satisfied that the levees '
0now up, together with those Ieing!
put up, will insure the east end of
the road fromt overflow. On lno
other ground can the idea of fixing
, the west end first be rea:sonablyti
supposed to be the proper thing.
Previous to this year, thile laill
trouble, has been between Tatlu
lab and Waverly. Between those
l points the water was deeper, on1
the track, than anywhere elte on
e the road. The Canal hayou swamp
has Luae tho place where the water
was deepest. Just west of Lake
t One was another bad place, and
from Tensas, about four miles east,
at ,was another bad stretch, and final
s ly from half a mile west of Tensas,
(Henley bayou) nearly to Waverly,
the track was under during every
0 overflow. For these reasons, at
0 the first blush, the east end would
e appear to be the end most requir
ing attention, but the building of
Ashton levee changed the appear
tance of things, and now, if the
levees alrealdy up, hold, all the
water from the Mississippi that
comaes into North Loutsiana albove
Delta is shunted off west, and goes
through the country west of bayou
e Macon, whlich is therefore the first
e section requiring attention.
S Railroad companies are not given
0 to sentiment; they are enunentiy
t practical, and the very fact of their
devoting their first efforts to the
hlighest half, of the part of the road
Sto be worked on, is a strong argu
e nient in favor of safety from over
Sflow for this part of the parish.
a The company evidently have con
n fidence in the levees, they evident
ly believe this end of the road will
Sbe safe front overflow, and the ex
d ample set by them, is a safe one to
follow. So get ready for a crop
year, exercise faith, and go ahead.

The largest cattle ranch in the

Sment is that of Capt. Richlard King,
of Texas. It comprises upward of
800,000) acres, all under fence, and
n nearly 200,(0) head of cattle,:
Shorses and sheep. This ranch has
been eagerly sought by English,
SFrench and Dutch capitalists, but 1
d the successful competitor is the
united States Land and Invest
u
Smnient Company of New York City,
I. who have just concluded a purchase
n- at $6,500,000 for the entire prop
it- erty. The company anticipate an
ill annual income of nearly $1,50r0,0M0)
x- from this source, as tile increase of
to cattle is about 85 per cent. As an
indication of a more settled con
. dition of financial affairs, the man
ager says that the company's first p
)L morlage 6 per cent bonds are rapid- i
ly sought at 150 and interest, and
that the feeling now shown by
American capitalists in this class of
n, investment property is growingt
daily. Ex.
