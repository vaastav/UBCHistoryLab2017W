A'ourt House, to attend to all business in his
Tine wllh promptness and despatch.
THE President's Message has been quite fa
•Torabty received. Its toue, while not radical
as vet tirm enough to clearly indicate the course
which the Government will pursue towards
•Rebels.
•GARRET DAVIS has been elected to fill the
vacancy in the Kentucky Delegation iu the
Senate, caused by the expulsion of John C.
Breckinridge.
MAJ. KiLBOCRNiC advertises for a few mort
recruits for the Tioga Companies in the 45tii
Regiment, soon to start tor the "sunny South.'
Any one wishing to joir. this Regiment can de
so by reporting themselves in Wellsboro, a
aii early day.
Tits report that Thad. Stevens, of this State
had said in a Republican caucus in Washing
ton "that, after Mr. Couurou's Report had
been accepted by the President, Gen. McClel
lan threatened to resign if it was not modified
before being sent into Congress,"' is contra
dieted by Mr. Stevens.
I. ATE developemeuts show that instead ol
Fremont appointing his officers in Missouri
without any permission from the President, he
was promised commissions for all officers lit
would find necessary to appoint. Thus, fac!
by fact, will tiie Hero of Missouri be freed from
ihe miserable charges preferred against him
by his enemies.
Gov. CHASE announces the true economic
doctrine, in respect to the slaves of the rebels,
whose confiscation he approves and advises,
viz : that their labor will be most profitable to
the country by making them free. The ante
cedents of Gov. Cli.ise render it quite certain
that he tavors the liberation of such slaves
upon all grounds, but we are glad to find liirn
expres-iug the opinion, that even with the
view limited to profit merely, in a large and
national sc-use, it is for the true interest of the
country.

WE print this week the Reports of Messrs.
Secretaries Cameron and Welles,and will pub
lish the remaining Reports as wc find room.
1 ae Report of Mr. Cameron is one of the ablest
which has emanated from that Department.
■Some months since fnult was found in many
quarters with the course he pursued, but that
soon changed to admiration when taey saw
the energy and ability displayed in all that
J>ertained to bis Department, and this his first
report establishes firmly and permanently the
confidence wall the people necessary to a suc
cessful administration, llis position in re
gard to the disposal of the Rebel's slave pro
perty meets the hearty approbation cf the
Aiti-blavery portion of the country and shows
that while being "conservative" he can yet be

Charleston Humeri !
lORTRESS MONROE. Dec. 13.—Anincendiarv
fire broke out in Charleston at 9 o'clock 011
the evening of the 11th and at h o'clock the
text day it was still raging.
Nearly all that part of the city from Broad
street on the South-East Bay on the east, and
King street on the west, is said to be destroy
ed, including the Catholic Cathedral, the Cir
cular Church Institute. St. Andrew's Hall, the
Theater, and the Executive Rooms.
An extra train 1 ad ieft Augusta with sup
plies tor the sufferers—thousands of whom
roamed the streets—and assistance to fight
the fire.
It is supposed to be * negro insurrection,
though this view of the case is excluded from
the dispatches.
I HILADELPHIA, Dee. 14.—A special dispatch
from Baltimore to the Philadelphia Inquy-er,
attributes the fire to slave insurrection, and
. - that one-half of Charleston is in rainb.

• V> e do not believe that even in this ape ol
cheap publications any work can be more rea
sonable than t!ie terms of the SCIISTIFII
AMERICAN at S- per annum, with twenty-live
percent discount for clubs of ten. It forms
a yearly volume of 832 page 3 quarto, with ar
immense number of original engravings o:
patented machines, valuable inventions, and
objects of scientific interest. There is not ac
industrial pursuit which does not receive a
siiare of its attention. It contains official
lists of patent claims, important statistics
practical receipts for useful domestic pur
poses, nd has long stood, both in this coun
try and Europe, as the highest authority ir
the mechanic arts and sciences. There is nc
publication more valuable to the farmer. th(
miller, the engineer, the iron foundei. the me
chanic, or the rnaufacturer. We have nevei
opened a number without learning something
we never kuew before, and obtaining valu
able information for the benefit of our read
ers. The Publishers. Messrs. MUXN & Co., ol
37 Park Row, New York, have deserved tb*
success which they have achieved. No on*

palatial establishment, which is a museum o
inventive genius, collected from the entin
world. If any of our friend® away 01T in th<
country do not know this work, and will tak<
our advice, they will mail $2 and becomt

We fully indorse the above, and would re
commend our readers to take Prentice's ad
vice, and subscribe for the paper. A new
volume commences cm the first of January
and it being a valuable work of reference
containing, as it does, the only official list o
patent claims published in the country, even

published every Saturday,by the well-knowr
