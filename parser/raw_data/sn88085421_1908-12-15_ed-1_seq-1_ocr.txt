The president then quoted the spe

Then the message continue:
"The statements sometimes occurred

are false in every particular from

Castro Talks Saucy To Dutch
BERLIN, Dec. 15. —"The seizure of

In this caustic language President
Castro of Venezuela commented today

fhat if the insurrection is allowed to

Class Basketball
Games at Whitman
WJth the banquet of the football
team last night, fall sports gave away
entirely to winter athletics and indoor
contests are the whole show at Whit
man college this week. Inter-class
games are the center of attraction and
beginning tomorrow a game will be
played every day this week.
The official schedule of the series
is announced as follows:
Wednesday at 4:30 o'clock, senior vs.
juniors and sophomores vs. freshmen.
The two latter will play their first half
between the two halves of the two for
mer teams and in this way a gafe will
be in progress all the time. On Thurs
day at 4:30 the winners of Wednes.
day's game will play for the champion
ship of the college. On Friday even
ing at 7:45 the academy will play the
college champions for the champion
ship of the institution.
These games will not be, as formerly
one sided affairs, as every team has
members of the 'varsity and other good
players to fill out the squad. The
seniors are building thei* hopes around
Felth6use and Dutcher, last year's star
guards. The juniors have Barnes,
Shubert and Hawley. The sophomores
have the two Belts, Cushman, Cox and
several other fast men. The freshmen
have a bunch of good material and
altogether the series will be an inter
esting one. Tomorrow afternoon at
4:30, the first' games will be played, a
double header.
The games are for the championship
of the school; but not for that alone.
Coach Blanchard will be given the best
possible opportunity of getting a line
on his men in this manner and the
series is practically a tryout for the
squad.
Mrs. Barnes
Asks Divorce
On the grounds of desertion and re
fusal of cohabitation. Mrs. Effife
Barnes this morning filed suit for
divorce from her husband, G. W.
Barnes, brother of "Bud" Barnes, the
murderer.
The complaint states that the coup'e
were married on June 13, 1900,. During
September of last year the complain
ant says Barnes deserted (her and
refused to live with her. Since he
deserted her, he has contributed but
$20 to the support of her and the chil
dren. She has at all times been a
true and loving wife, she states, but
her husband has wilfully neglected
her.
From the union have come three
children, Effie Gladys, aged four
years and eight months; Ward
Beecher, aged two years and eight
months; and Minnie Amanda, aged one
year and eight months. There is about
$150 worth of community property.
The plaintiff prays she may be
granted a divorce, that the community
property be given her and that she
be allowed $15 a month alimony, and
be given the custody of the children.

Fitzmaurice has been in the county

of the more important manufacturing
centers of the east and also in the
west.
In speaking of the business condi
tions in the larger cities, Mr. Holt,
who was more interested in the iron
and steel industries, this morning
said:
"Indications in all manufacturing
centers of the east are excellent, nearly
all manufacturers having a large num
ber of orders booked 'ahead. Iron
business, especially manifested
an increase, and in all lines the in
dications are for a great volume of
business during the coming four
years."
On his return trip, Mr. Ho't visited
the home of the company in Stockton,
Calif., and came to Walla Walla by
way of Spokane. Conditions through
out the west, he says, are excellent,
and the coming year will witness a
most remarkable change throughout
the Pacific northwest.
Activity in railroad circles is es
pecially pronounced, and an era of
prosperity such as has never before
been recorded on this side of the
Rockies is just opening.
Mr. Holt looks for even a greater
business for his company during the
coming season, prospects for a bum
per wheat crop being better than has
been known in the past several
years.

Make a Soldier Out of
Every Schoolboy in State
SPOKANE, Dec. 15.—Military train
ing for every schoolboy in the state
is provided for in a bill which will be
introduced in the coming legislature
by State Senator-elect R. A. Hutch
inson.
The feature of the bill will be to de
vote one-half day each week to drill
in the manual of arms and maneuvers
for every boy in the seventh and
eighth grades, securing for the pur
pose some competent drillmaster from
Uncle Sam's army.
I have been giving this subject
much consideration, and believe that
it would result in much good, not only
to the boy s themselves, but to the
state as well," says Mr. Hutchinson.
One of the best pieces of capital
that a young man can have when he
leaves school and goes out into the
world is a good appearance and noth
ing gives him a better appearance
than a military training. It not only
adds to his bearing, but is a healthful
exercise as well, and one in which
the boys would take an interest and
which would add to the pleasure of
their school work.

Brownsville Affair to Have
Another Extended Airing
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15. —By virtue
of a postponement of the subject from
May 13, last, consideration of the
Brownsville case will again be; taken
up by t*he senate tomorrow. Senator
Foraker, who is pushing the bill for
the reinstatement in the army of the
negro troops discharged by President
Roosevelt for participation in the
Brownsville riot, believes that the
measure will be passed at an early
date.
It will be recalled that the village of
Brownsville Tex., was "shot up" on the
night of August 14, 1906. Response
bility for the affray was at once
charged to the colored soldiers of the
Tweinty-fifth infantry, who were sta
tioned at Fort Brown, adjoining the
villa g#. An investigation by the offi
cers of the war department failed to
connect any particular soldier or sol
diers with the shooting. It was then
charged that the soldiers of Companies
B. C. and D had "entered int'o a con
spiracy of silence" to protect their
guilty comrades. Accordingly, an order
was issued by the president dismissing
all the soldiers of theise three com
panies from the service, "without hon
or." £
The debates in the senate were di
rected mainly t'o a discussion of the
president's power in making this
wholesale dismissal. There was some
discussion, of course, as to whether the
soldiers werei or were not guilty of the
shooting, and it was in one of these
cross-fires that Senators Spooner and
Tillman clashed in their bitter con
tVoversy on the race question.
Late in January, 1907, a resolution
was adopted directing the committee
on military affairs to make an inves
tigation into the facts connected with
the shooting. In tlie committee, as on
the senate floor. Senator Foraker of
Ohio espoused the cause of the colored
men. Senator Warner of Missouri was
chosen to see that the administration
interests at the hearing were pro-
COMMISSIONERS
WANT PULLMAN
CAR TAX LEVY
Until the state tax commission gives
Walla Walla county her apportion
ment of the levy on the Pullman Car
company, the local board of commis
ers will be unable to equalize the 1908
taxes. This apportionment has been
held up and although County Auditor
McCaw whote 10 days ago for the in
formation he has not' yet received it.
This morning another letter was ad
dressed to the tax commission asking
that prompt attention be given the
matter, as it is holding up the work
of the county commissioners.
City Fathers

For the transaction of routine busi
ness, the city council will meet in reg

of further reducing the expenses of
the city. In what departments the cut
is to be made, or whether there is
really to be a change, would not be
given out for a certainty by city of

is of times correct in her surmises,
has slated tonight's meeting for a sen

TWENTY-FIVE CENTS PER MONTH.
after a few years as the boys began
to attain their majority, it would al
ways have a drilled citizen soldiery
ready to be called upon in case of an
emergency, instead of having to de
pend for its protection and safety upon
a lot of raw recruits.
"My idea is that by devoting one
half day eac hweek to this work one
drill master could look after ten
schools, and the expense would not
amount to hut little. There are plenty
of soldiers In the regular army who
are thoroughly competent to drill and
train the boys, and it would not be
necessary to have officers for this
purpose.
*'I am satisfied that if such a law
is passed, as I believe it will be. we
would only have to ask the United
States government to detail soldiers
for this work and it would be done.

few interruptions, the committer held
almost daily sessions. In all, 156 wit
nesses were examined. These witnesses
included army officer, gun experts, col
ored and white soldiers, residents of
Brownsville, and others.
On Junet 14, 1907, the committee took
a recess. Before the committee and
elsewhere the soldiers strenuously de
nied that they wre guilty of the shoot
ing, or that they had any knowledge as
to who was responsible for the out
rage. No witness tvas able to identify
any particular soldier charged with
being- involved in the affray. A ma
jority of the members of the commit
tee were convinced that the shooting
was the work of the soldiers, and that
tti« president was within his consti
tutional rights in ordering the dismis
sal of the threet companies.
On May 13 last the measures for re
instatement of the colored soldiers
came up in the senate. Senator Fora
ker, the champion of the negroes,
moved for a postponement of the vote
until December. After a motion by
Senator Culberson, of Texas, to vote
on the bill immeeliately had beien laid
on the table. Mr. F<>rak«'r's motion
was adopted by a vote of 62 to 6. The
Ohio senator considered this a victory
and gave out a statement in which he
said that while he could not have
passed the bill at that time, he be
lieved that its passage was insured
by the postponement.
There is nothing to indicate that
Senator Foraker has abated his inter
est in the cause of the discharged men.

in the middle of a fight. There have
been frequent reports that he has
something up his sleeve" in the way of
specific information as to who is re
sponsible for the shooting. This may
not be so, but those who are familiar
with the tactics and temperament of
the Ohioan feel certain the session will
be enlivened by a continuation of the
fight for the "Black Battalion."
Borleske Captain
Of Football Team
To captain the Whitman football
team of next yeaT, Vincent Borleske
was elected by the Whitman team last
night at the banquet given in the
Dacres hotel to close the season just'
ended. Borleske's choice was nearly
unanimous and every man on the team
and squad is well satisfied with the
selection.
Borleske is the best football player
in the northwest, without doubt 1 . He is
the only man who received the unani
mous vote* of the coaches for his posi
tion on the! all-northwest and was se
lected to captain that" team. .He is
a wonderfully gritty player, a catapult
when running with the ball, a stone
wall in defense an*d a terror to the op
position wh,-n running interference.
Borleske's election Is a justly deserved
honor.
The banquet last night was attended
by the squad and wa s one of the Jol
