Washington, Dec. 9.
Senator Cameron's letter to State
Senator McCarren today declining to be
a eunaidate for re-election canned quite
a breeze among Republican politicians
who are here attending the national
committee meeting, as well as Con
gressmen from Pennsylvania, and his
colleagu-s In the senate. It has been
known among Senator Cameron's
friend for sometime that he would not
be a candidate for re-election. In fact.
Is was whispered among the knowing
ones at the time he took such a bold
stand against the repeal of the Sher
man silver act during the extra session
of the fifty-third congress over two
years ago that he would not again be
a candidate. Me .discovered then that
his stand for silver finished him po
litically, but he hoped that In time he
would be able to convince the voters
of Pennsylvania that they were wrong,
and he was right. . . ,
Senator Cameron has at last seen the
"handwriting on the wall." He has
had his .ear on the ground and heard
the rumblings In favor of sound money.
During the past year. Senator Cam
eron has been feeling the public pulse,
and he has discovered that public senti
ment was strongly against him all over
the state. His old time friends have
told his that It meant political suicide
for them, as well as himself. If he
entered the race again. His letter of
declination today, while somewhat of
a surprise to everybody here was not
wholly unexpected by politicians who
knew him best In an Interview this
evening, Senator Campron said that the
only ambition he ever had had been
fulfilled. His only desire, he said, was
to serve In the United States senate
as long as his father did, twenty years,
and when his present term expires on
March 4, 1S97, he will have been a mem
ber of the upper bruncn of congress
Just that length of time. Senator Cam
eron has no further political ambition.
He will retire to private life. He will
reside In Washington during the winter
and will spend the summers on his
farm at Donegal, Dauphin county. Sen
ator Cameron is not a old man. He Is
Just as old as Quay sixty-two years.
The first political office Senator Cam
eron ever held was recretary of war,
under President Grant, from May 22,
1876, to March 3, 1877. He' was chair
man of the Republican national com
mittee mo, during the Garfield-Hancock
campaign. Senator Cameron is
reputed to be Very wealthy, having In
herited most of It from his father, the
late Simon Cameron, and made a good
deal of money himself by fortunate in
vestment.
Mentioned as Snccessor.
There Is much speculation as to who
will succeed Cameron In the senate.
There is no lack of timber to select
from. The woods are full of It. Among
the names mentioned by Republican
politicians here today from various
parts of the state. were ex-Postmaster
General Wanamaker, District Attorney
Graham, State . Senator . Penrose,
Charles Emory Smith and Thomas Do
Ian, all of Philadelphia; J. Hay Brown,
of Lancaster; State Senator Walter
Merrick, of Tioga; Congressman Jack
Robinson and ex-Lieutenant Governor
Watres and William Connell, of Scran
ton.
If Philadelphia cannot agree upon a
candidate It Is more than likely that a
man from the northeast section of the
state will be selected. The western
part of the state will not be sonsidered
In the selection of a senator, A good
many of the politicians here today are
of the opinion that Philadelphia will get
into a snarl over a candidate, and that
a mmi from the country will be select
ed as a compromise. Northeastern
Pennsylvania has never hud a United
States senator, and as It Is now but of
Its swaddling clothes. It would seem
that It has the right to demand recog
nition at the hands of the Republican
party.
Mr. Vandling in Town.
Postmaster 'Vandllng is here. He
wants the department to establish two
branch postofflces In Scranton Hyae
Park and Providence. ' He also wants
to get consent of the treasury depart
ment to allow the state Superior court
to hold sessions in the public building.
Postsl Spies at Work.
The postofflee department is evident
ly determined to break up the habit of
employes talking too much. Three of
the oldest employes of the department
have been removed for giving Informa
tion concerning their respective bur
reaua to members of congress, who wen?
unable to gain the desired Information
from higher officials. The discharged
employes are charged with "Conspir
ing to belittle the department." One
of them has confessed to giving Infor
mation to. members of congress. He
says that A. W. Machem, superinten
dent of the free delivery system, as
sessed and collected an Involuntary
contribution of $30 each from a number
of clerks In his department and which
was devoted to the late Democratic
campaign in Ohio. For ' this he was
dismissed. His colleagues were dis
charged for the same offense. A con.
irressional Investigation will likely fol
low, and some rich and racy develop
ments arc expected to result. Samuel
Belght, one of the men discharged, says
he has employed counsel and will in
sist upon a usbllc investigation. He
claims to have a letter which shows
that certain postomoe omciais leviea
and collected money for use In the Ohio
fiamnalgn .
Postmaster General Blssell Inaugur
ated a "spy'aystem a year or more ago
whifh resulted In the dismissal or sus-
wnston of a large number of mall car
riers who had committed such great
crimes as taking a glass of beer or a
glass of soda water while on duty when
the thermometer ranged anywhere from
to degrees to 100 degreei in tne snade.
Such a violation of the de tartment rules
wax nnoardonable. But nothing was
said about the higher officials gusxllng
all the beer, whiskey and wine they
wanted or could pay for. Some of the
best letter carriers in the service were
either dismissed of suspended for the
above named offence during Mr. Bis-
sell's administration. . His exit from the
pnstofttce department has not changed
matters in this respect, his successor,
the Hon. William L. Wilson,' it seems,
Is more particular than the Buffalontan.
He has Just lsued orders to tbe eueot
that any postmaster or employe of tne
postal department who, in any way,
manner or form, whether on duty or on
kiave of niv.nee;, who takes any active
part in the passage of legislation relat
ing to the service or the betterment of
their Individual or collective conditions,
will be dismissed Instantly. This r.rder
is directly aimed at the letter curriers'
assoclat'on, which has been working for
several years to better the condition of
its member?. It Is alleged that the
"spy" system cost Uncle Sam $36,000 for
the quarter ended September 30 last.
Tha MeKinlov llntim
- The launching of the McKlnley presi
dential boom at the meeting of the Na
tional Committee in tnis city is consul
cred mighty poor polities. Whether or
not Governor McKlnley authorizes his
Ohio friends to come here and shout for
him at this time Is not Known, but his
presidential stock has undoubtedly fal
len several points all the same. The na
tional committee has little If anything
to do with nominating a candidate, and
if It had It Is doubtful If the committee,
as It stands today, would favor the
Ohloan's nomination for ' president.
Governor McKlnley's friends see the
mistake they have made, but 't Is too
late. The mischief has been done. The
friends of Reed, Allison and other can
didates are chuckling In their sleeves
over the awkward position In which the
author of the McKlnley bill has -placed
himself.
Senator Hill has returned from his
Ill-fated lecturing tour through the
West. He doesn't like to discuss his
late, trip. He attributes his failure to
draw crowded houses to the hard times.
Senator Hill, for the first time since his
arrival in Washington, has taken a
house for the winter. It is located on
Lafayette square and was formerly oc
cupied by Senator Dolph, whose Oregon
constituents loved him so dearly that
they voted to keep him at home with
them. While Senator Hill Is a con
firmed bachelor and Is said to hato
women on general principles, rumor
has it that he will shortly marry. I
think he realizes the fact thut the
American people do not want any more
bachelor presidents, even if they do get
married after they have served a por
tion of their term. Senator Hill can
see the White house by sticking his
head out of a fiont window in his resi
dence and looking south.

READY FOR THE STRUGGLE.
Representatives of Various Cities Will
Present Clalm-i to the National Repub
lican Convention.
Washington, Dec. 9. The three not
able events connected with the meeting
of the Republican national committee,
which developed this morning, were
these:
'First The decision of Messrs, Cart
er and Manley to hear the claims of the
rival cities this afternoon Instead of
Wednesday, as had been agreed upon. .
"Second The combination of the
Pittsburg and San Francisco forces. '
"Third The withdrawal of Salt Lake
as an aspirant for convention honors.
The decision to pern'lt the several
cities to present their claims today was
reached at an early hour this morning,
after a "conference of the members of
the executive committee.
A meeting of the executive commit
tee was held this evening in Chair
man Manly's room to discuss the ar
rangements for tomorrow's meeting.
The national committee will sit In
open session to hear the claims of San
Francisco, St. Louis, Chicago, Pitts
burg, New York. At the conclusion of
the speechmaklng, the committee will
go Into executive session and select the
convention city.
Some time last night, after the Cali
fornia delegation reached the city, they
were visited at their headquarters by
Senator Quay, of Pennsylvania. Sena-i
tor Quay Is understood to have in
formed his California friends that Pitts
burg was very much In earnest, and
that the metropolis of Western Penn
sylvania was In the fight to win. He
said, however, that he, personally, was
well disposed to San Francisco, and
that if he were satisfied his own state
could not secure the convention he
would use his Influence for San Fran
cisco. In this effort he will be warmly
seconded by Manley, of Maine; Mr. Fes
senden, of Connecticut; and Mr. Clark
son, of Iowa. ,
The delegation which will present the'
claims of Pittsburg to the national com
mittee arrived this morning. Numer
ically it contains as many members as
those from the other cities combined.
Two of the number, Messrs. W. N.
Randolph and M. J. Billows, are col
ored attorneys, of recognised standing
at the Allegheny bar. f,.
In company with the other delega
tlons the Pennsylvania opened head
quarters at the Arlington, where they
were speedily visited by Senator Quay
and Representatives Dalsell and Stone.
Congressman Dalsell, who la a very
effective speaker, will place Pittsburg
In nomination. His efforts will be sec.
onded by his colleague, Congressman
William A. Stone, of Allegheny, and by
O. L, Hollander, the president of tba
city oounoll. .
Seoator Morgan Delivers an Address
1 Upon Bering Sea Controversy.
HOT SHOT FOR PAIXCEPOTE
The Speaker Lashes tho British Ambassa
dor with an Unsparing llsad-Tao .
. First Bills Passed by Congress.
New Senators Appear.
Washington, Dec. . The senate wus
addressed to-day by Mr. Morgan (Dem
ocrat, Alabama), chairman of the com
mittee on foreign relations, and former
ly a member of the Bering sea Paris
tribunal. In support of his resolution of
fered on tbe third of December, referr
ing to the committee on foreign rela
tions the president's special message
of February 13, 1895, and his recent an
nual message, relating to the payment
by the United States of the claims of
Great Britain arising out of the Bering
sea controversy, with Instructions to
examine Into the question of liability
on the part of the United States and of
liability on the part of Great Britain or
Canada.
Senator Morgan's speech on the Ber
ing Sea claims was in substance a con
tention that tho award of the Paris
tribunal of arbitration, of which he was
a member, contained no provision mak
ing the United States liable in the lump
sum of $425,000 for damages sustained
by English vesselB held up while fish
ing In the disputed waters. If any
agreement was made to settle with
England on that basis it was, he de
clared, unconstitutional, because not
ratified by the senate; and for one, he
did not propose to have either the pres
ident of the United States or the British
minister, Sir Julian Pauncefote, mis
represent the American position on this
matter.
The senator paid his respects to Sir
Julian In spirited style. Referring to
a political circular In which the latter
had contended that no aamission oi nu
bility became necessary from the mo-'
mnnt that the Paris tribunal, by its
award, had rejected the legal preten
sions of the United States to a special
property In the fur seals resorting to
the Prlllof Islands, and had said that
that decision at once proclaimed the
Illegality of the seizures and the lia
bility of tho United States to satisfy
the claims, adding that he ((Sir Julian)
was "at a loss to conceive what other
view could be taken without disput
ing the Paris award," Senator Morgan
said: '
"I am equally at a loss to conceive how
the tribunal should refuse to consider the
question of the liability of either govern
ment to the other, being prohibited by
the treaty from any such attempt, and
how by such refusal they have man
aged to decide the Question and' -give to
fh.tr lndinnent the effect of an"estopcl
bv matter of record.
Being urged my me
f these vessels was illegal, they express.
oi mesa vunnciH was m-...tj . -
)y , eon.wer the request, and yet
tne prit,h ambassador permits himself
to state the absurd conclusion as a fact
I that 'that decision at once proclaimed the
occu-tillegallty of the sclsures and the liability
of the United States to satisfy the claims.'
. 1 flan)ly
. , f he BPb,traton!
to consider the question of the liability
of either government upon any claims as
serted by the other?
"If Sir Julian had remembered that
there was no negotiation of the question
of liability, or as to the rightfulness or
Justice, or the Items of the claims or the
amount of them, or whether they be-
j longed to citizens of the United States,
I he would have comprehended my objec
tion, In part at least, to the diversion, or
this question from the consideration of
the senate, without which no negotiation
can mature into tne eneci or law, lie
would have seen, as he doubtless saw,
very clearly that a conditional agree
ment for a 'lump sum' of $425,000 In com
promise of all claims was a convenient
way to avoid a negotiation required by
treaty, Instead of Its being a diplomatic
negotiation, which the senate must ratify
by a vote of two-tnlrd or a quorum be
fore it Is an engagement that binds tho
United States.
The senate Is an ensentlal part of 'tho
constitutional authorities of the- United
States.' without whose consent, as Sir
Jullnn perfectly understands, no execu
tory agreement with a foreign power can
be valid under our constitution. The sen-
nate has constitutional powers to examine-
and revise negotiations with foreign
governments, which are a part of the per
manent foundations or tne government or
the United States, Tho arrangement for
a 'lump sum,' provided congress would
consent to vote It, and for a negotiation
for a Joint Commission, If congress should
refuse, was not a diplomatic agreement
concluded or negotiated through the con
stitutional authorities of the United
States' compatible with the dignity of
either government and Its Injurious ef
fects are obvious In the irascible ani
censorious criticisms of our people and
their representatives in congress, wltn
which the intrusive circular os tne untisn
ambassador abounds. The failure to drive
congress Into making a 'lump sum' appro
priation as a compromise of these claims,
which were neither proven nor discussed,
so far as congress was Informed, is made
the pretext of the statement or tne Brit
ish ambassador that congress has refused
in meet 'tha national obligations of the
United States.' He makes an analysis of
ha vnto In the house of representatives
on the rejection of the 'lump sum,- ana in
forms Earl Klmberley that It was 'Repub
licans. Populists, and forty-eight Demo-
.rnta and uoon that basis he says In his
dispatch of Feb. 28. 1895, that, 'Strong par
ty feeling would seem alone to account for
the rejection of so just and desirable an
arrangement, and, as your lordship will
h.. nniril from the Inclosure In my dis
patch, statements have been mode In con
gress which are entirely misleading.'
"It Is getting to be a familiar method
.n-.innifnt' of our national polfcy
when it Is disappointing to British de
mands and Interests, however unsatis
factory they may be to our country, to
attribute our action to the influence of
party politics. Iir-thls Instance Sir Julian
Pauncefote does not hesitate to Impute to
the action of the house of representatives.
In an unjust and offensive manner, this
motive of party antagonism as the Tea-
. . a 1 1 .. V. I 'Limn iim1 an.

Not satisfied with this form of accusa
tion. Blr Julian arraigns sonktors and
.k.i nt the house of representatives
In debate, and charges them with Ignor
ance and misstatements or iiw ana iun,
and Imputes to them discreditable motives.
"I have no fault to find with the British
amhauador for any opinion ne may en.
.in nf mv conduct as a senator, or .as
an arbitrator, nor do I ctnsure him for
freely expressing those opinions to his own
.m.ninuot, That Is his privilege, and
he has the rightful choice of the language
best suited to his tastes la making such
communications; only that he Is still re
sponsible at the bar of publlo opinion for
his motives and for the verity of his.
.i.imiuiu and the fairness of his deduc-

right to question a member of congress
for words spoken in debate, by printing,
under cover of a privileged communica
tion to his own government, a diatribe of
criticism and Invective upon his utter
ances in congress, and then pursue the ex
traordinary method of handing out those
diplomatic papers to the American preys
for publication and comment, thus fore
stalling a reply with an unjust statement.
"I do not know whether this paper,
which was handed out to the press of
Washington by the ambassador, has been
sent In to our state department by the
British government. If It has. It Is prob
able that It will bs laid before congress
with some note of approval or disapproval
by the president. I do not know, or sup
pose, that tbe president wllK Join Great
Britain In these severe comments upon
the opinions of members of congress ex
pressed In debate, although they voted
against his recommendation of this Mump
sum' appropriation. His criticisms. If he
has any to mitke, will come from a source
that is responsible to the country along
with the senate for our treaty relations,
and along with congress for our legisla
tion. - It will have none of the Intrusive
arrogance that has Induced the British
ambassador to attempt to Influence our
legislation by harsh denunciation of our
votes and arguments, and by taking an
appeal to our people against the attitude
of their representatives In pongress, and
supporting it by flattering alluulans to
their superior sense of airness and jus
tice. His manifest aversion to negotia
tion and his persistent purpose to escapo
It will lead the American people, to whom
he appeals, to a very careful and sincere
Inquiry into the motive that causes the
concealment of the real merits of these
claims from scrutiny, by grouping them
into an indistinguishable mass, and cov
ering them with a 'lump sum' appropria
tion. "If the plea of a technical estoppel by
the award of the tribunal cannot avail
Great Britain to close tha doors to the
truth and to exclude Justice, equity, good
morals, and friendly dealing from all con
sideration in the 'further negotiations,' It
will be found that her claim to damages
cannot be sustained unless there Is a prin
ciple of International law or morals that
prohibits a nation from preventing a
wrong to Its territory, its revenues. Its
property, and the support and peace of
Its people, even If It Is committed with
force and violence within a few yards of
Its boundaries. I have found' no such
declaration In the laws of nations, nor
any such precedent In the usuages of na
tions. "If the award Is entitled to the benefit
of the rules of construction that obtain in
respect of all agreements, decisions. Judg
ments, treaties, and transactions that dis

the Alleged liability of the United States
ior tnese seliures, if it Is covered by the
principles of the award, must be de

contention, and for this reason, and others
I ask that the senate will cause the facts
to be investigated and laid before con
gress. We have been asked to vot x,

Britain without anv nroof nf tha i,.ti

cannot be wrested and perverted Into the

to suppress and punish in the future, nor

resolution was agreed to.

on the witness stand to-duy. remaining
there for four hours', and her husband.
Chauncey Howell, gave testimony dur
ing the balance of the time. Their tes
timony was In regard to the scurrilous
anonymous letters which constitute a
marked feature of the case: They told
In what manner they were received by
Llbbte Knapp, the victim of the poison
ing, and how others were received by
Mrs. Howell after the girl died. In ad-'
illtion a lot of letters, perhaps forty In
all, were read to the jury. They 'were
all In the same style as has been before
Indicated, indeed too vile even to be
read aloud in the court room. One of
the letters read was revolved by Mrs.
Howell about ten days after Miss Knapp
died. It had been pinned to the front
door of the Howell house and was found
by Mr. Waters when ho call-'d. Tim
letter reads:
"I sent you a letter to the postoflice,
but the one who took It lost It, vo I will
be sure you get this. I wan drunk when
I wrote the other, so I don't .know what
I sald.hut If you mind your business. you
will be all right. 1 gave that woman .
three duses of arsenic after she came
to your house and two before but you
can't prove It, so don't try. I have had
two kinds of poison over a year, but i
never got the chance to use them. Bre-
hany's folks say I was never in their i
house. Well, 1 was Just the same and
have been since she died. Hn, Ila, (I i
was up stairs throe time's when she was
there and once since. Old Peg Leg ;
came out the bark door and I slipped ,
up stairs. I was looking for some-
thing. Ha, Ha
The letter was unsigned.
Another Strango Letter.
Howell testified that In June last,
the month following Miss Knapp's
death, he found In his yard the follow
ing letter:
"You see, no one will ever believe
I did this and perhaps you believe I
am all bad, but I am not. If I was, I
would not try to help you. Ha, Ha. By
G If a man comes and asks If you
done all this, say 'Yes,' and they will
say you are crazy and let It .
Now, the men from Wellsboro said that
If you owned urf, you did all'thls they
would drop It. So you see I tell you this
as the best way for you to get out of
it without any more trouble."
Before this letter was received by
Mrs. Howell, the disappointed lover,
Rlghtmire, had been suspected of the
crime and an information had been
made against him before a Justice, but
he had not been arrested. His evidence
shows that counsel advised him to keep
still and lot the matter drop. After
that no more letters were received by
Mrs. Howell.
Today another brother of Mrs. Howell
appeared upon the scene, A. A. Duttun,
of New York city. ' - - .
CEBMANTS PROTEST.
President Cleveland's Message Canses a
Commotion in tho Reichstag Charges
Hcvold of Foundation.
Berlin, Dec. 9. In the Reichstag to
day the minister of foreign affairs In
reply to remarks concerning the tariff
situation between Germany and the
t'nlted States, said that the American
congress had some time since adopted
a differential duty upori sugur. tier
many had protested against this and
Mr. Cleveland did loyally all that he
had the power to do In the matter, but
congress refused to modify its preylous
action. Germany, lie declared, main
tains that the differential duty adopted
by the American congress Is a violation
of the existing treaty. President Cleve
land's message charging.Oermany with
applying differential treatment to cer
tain American exports was a great sur
prise. He then proceeded to Bhow that
the charges made by the president were
devoid of foundation. The presence of
Texas fever In cuttle proved that pro
hibition of the Importation of the Amer
ican meats into Germany was neces
sary, but the same measures were In
existence against other states than
America. '
Concerning the cancellation of the li
censes of American Insurance compan
ies he said that certain American insur
ance c6mpanles doing business In Prus
sia had had their licenses revoked be
cause they would not conform to the
laws which were the same for German
companies and foreign companies. If
the American companies Would under
take to conform .to the laws nothing
could prevent them from reopening
their business. This matter, he said,
was purely a German concern, over
which he could not admit the criticism
of a foreign government. Germany, he
declared, would loyally continue to ad
here to her treaties, not allowing her
self to be frightened by threats.

I nncrlng Him.
linneapolis, Mir.n.. Dec. 2. Harry
Hayw&rd paced his arrow rUson cell
this morning, while within one hundred
l'eet the carpenters clattered boards
and drove nails, heralding to the rest
less wretch the fact that his scaffold
wns In process of erection. The Iron
doer between the cell room and hang
ing court was closed, but this did not
prevent the mullled but distinct soumia
of preparation from sniltinu; the ear.
Harry had tt been Informed as to tho
work, but at th first sounds he said
with a laugh, to his guard: "They're
off." He began to be moody in a short
time, however, sitting down only to
arise with a nervous movement and
muttering us ho walked: "They can't
hang me but once, and I guess that I
can stand that." If I take tho rope till
num. ana uwait until tney cut me
down, will they let me go if I get up
and witlk off?"
"Yes." shortly replied the guard, but
he did not join In the laugh that rang
out from the lips of tho prisoner.
"Say," and Hurry loosened the cloth
ing about his neck with his index finger,
"I flsjure that 1 won't be hurt at all, I
won't know Jut when It oecurs, unless
some devil who stood waiting for mo
told me all nbout it afterwards, for the
doctors say that there Is noihing but a
sudden soothing, dreamy feeling and
then a blank. If the d d things
work all right I won't care.
Thrcntcns to lioturn to Knrlh.
"Say. if a spirit caneomebaek to earth
you can bet your last dolar I will, and
then the prison bars will not keep me
from lilixt or Adry. I will torture Loth

neve in a nereniier, nut it 1h such an

will rive a fellow a chance to square
himself.
"There they go aftain, hammerfng nn
that scaffold. That's right. I hope they
have good men and will make It strong.
Everyone want's me to get weak in the

They will find out whether Harry Huy

Clenching his teeth, and iooklnpisav

MARY THIKMAVS LICK.
Daughter of tho i:-Scnator rinds a Gold
Mine She Was of a P-nshing, Adven
turesome Spirit, and I'isosvncd by Her
lather.
- ....
San Francisco, Cal Dec. 9. News
comes from the new ttnd lonesome des
ert mining ciimp of Pleacho. on the Col
orado desert, near Yuma, that the rich
est strike In ujl that section in years
has Just been mnde by Mary Thurman,
ti daughter of ex-Senator Thurman, of
Ohio, who has had as strange a career
as any heroine of a far Western novel.
She was among the early arrivals at
the cuiup and in prospecting she struck
a ledge of gold quartz that promises to
make her very wealt',"-
Sixteen years ngo Mary Thurman,
then a- belle of Washington, married
lieutenant Commander W. S. Cowlesi,
now I'nited States imvul ntiaehe , In
London, who wns recently married io
MismRoosevelt, sister of the sweretary
of the I'nited States Kmbnssy. They
soon quarreled unit Miss Thumnnn came
West, settling in Sun Diego county.nenr
the Mexican line, with u siser of Cowlesi.
The two women . gained notoriety at
a big dance given at Tla Juuna, on the
Mexican border. Mrs. Cowles was in
troduced to Thomas Uirford, a clerk In
a Mexican broker's otlli-e, ntsriun DUs.
Gilford wits a gallant-, and niadc rapid
headwny In courting .Mrs. Cowlos. , Sne
wus about completing her residence to
get a divorce, and within a week or two
after she secured It. ho and Gifford
were married at a hotel. They proceed
ed to make a night of It.aml tne poplptiR
of champagne corks was kcpt'up until
daylight. The revelry was the town talk
fT weeks, but meantime the bride and
groom speedily sought tho Mexican
town of Tia Juuna again.
The telegraphic reports .of the nup
tials had caused proceedings to be be
gun by a woman, until recently a resi
dent of Coronado, who claimed -to be
Gilford's wife and had two little boys
to show In proof of their relations. Her
lawyers stood ready to have Gifford ar
rest.'d for bigamy whenever he should
cross to tTie California side. He did
not cross, but the new Mrs. Gifford did,
acting as his go-between In establishing
a store at Tanama, on the Peninsula.
There his wife asslted him, and th-.r
mutual devotion was a theme of touch
ing interest for a Ions lime. Then came
a story that the businens had been given
up, and the U I fords were In camp at
the Hot Springs, two miles below the
border.
Before this, however, Mrs. Gifford had
made a journey to Ohio, io sse her dy
ing mother. The "Old Roman", would
not receive her Into his home, It Is
said that he looked at her, shook his
head and said, "I do got ..now this wo
man; I have no daughter." .
Then he shut the door, and she' went
back to Ijower California. Not long
after this Mrs. Thurman died. Follow
l..g this, Mrs. Gifford entered a suit for
divorce against her second husband,
this time at Unsenada, and secured It.
Gifford went abroad. This culminated
about a year ago. 'After this Mary mar
ried a professional ball player. "Bug"
Holllday. Mary, is well-known In South
ern California. .
Her streak of luck will not result. In
her removal from the wild life she has
led, for like all the nomads of the Colo
rado desert, she loves tne place that la
so repulsive to the newcomer.
