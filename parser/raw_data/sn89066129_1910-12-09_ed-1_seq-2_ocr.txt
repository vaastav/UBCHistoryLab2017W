con street. Chestnut Hill. Sbe was In
her 90th year, having celebrated her

to a calm sleep. The written words
of the mother of the Christian Science
church, penned as a message to bet
disciples, were "God is my life."
Mrs Eddy had been indisposed
about nine days, but she did not take

never rose after that. She ate her
meals regularly unin Saturday night,
when her supper was served while
she lay in bed. She was in possession
of all her faculties until the very eml.

"Pleasant View," her former home in
Concord, N. H., copyrights on her
books and publications and about $1,
000,000 in municipal and state bonds.
It is known that she made a WW
and that it is in existence, but no hint
as to us" contents ever has been given.
Many believe that the entire estate
will be given to the church.
CIGARETTE USERS NOT WANTED
Santa Fe Railroad Company Will Not
Keep Them in its Employ
Clouds the Mind.
Topeka, Kansas. The Atchison, To
jeka & Santa Fe Railroad company
has sent a notice to its officials
throughout the system that the com
pany does not care to have continued
in its employ those persons who are
persistent users of cigarettes.
The ground upon which this radical
that the continual use of the cigarette
clouds the-mind of the smoker, saps
his physical strength and makes him
unfit for the work that the railroad
desires of him. The company asserts
that no young man addicated to this
habit will be able to serve the rail
road to the benefit of the company
and to the safety of the public.

III TAFT MESSAGE
PRESIDENT POINTS OUT NECES
SITY OF CURTAILING EXPEN
SES TO LAWMAKERS.
ANNUAL DOCUMENT IS READ
Conservation, Ship Subsidy and For
tification of Panama Canal Lead
ing Topics Discussed Has
Little to Say About Tariff. .
" Washington, Dec. 6. Economy , in
government affairs Is the keynote of
President Taft'a annual message read
before both houses of congress today.
The message approximates 40,000
words and is one of the longest ever
submitted by a president.
Conservation of the public domain,
ship subsidy, fortification of the Pana
ma canal and the continuation of the
present tariff board are the leading
subjects touched upon. He also re
views the work of the various gov
ernment departments and concurs in
recommendation, tending toward the
bettering of the Bervice, made by sev
eral of the members of his cabinet
Economy Is Urged.
In dwelling on the urgent need for
economy In government expenditures, the
president says: "Kvery effort has been
made by each department chief to reduce
the estimated cost of his department for
the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30,
1912. I say this In order that congress
may understand that these estimates thus
made present the smallest sum which will
maintain the departments, bureaus and
offices of the government and meet its
other obligations under existing law, and
that a cut of these estimates would re
suit In embarrassing the executive branch
of the government in the performance of
its duties. This remark does not apply
to the river and harbor estimates, except
to those for expenses of maintenance and
the meeting of obligations under author
ized contracts, nor does It apply to the
publlo building bill nor to the navy build
ing program, Of course, as to these con
gress could withhold any part or all of
the estimates for them without interfer
ing with the discharge of the ordinary ob
ligations of these functions of Its depart
ments, bureaus and offices.
"Against the estimates of expenditures
$640,494,013.12, we have estimated receipts
for next year $680,000,000, making a proba
ble surplus of ordinary receipts over or
dinary expenditures of about $50,000,000, or
taking Into account the estimates for the
Panama canal, which are $56,920,847.69, and
which will ultimately be paid In bonds.
about $7,000,000, if congress shall conclude
to fortify the canal."
Wants Forest Limitation Removed.
On the subject of conservation he de
votes considerable space to forest, coal,
oil and gas, phosphate lands and water
power sites. As to the reservation of
forest lands he says: "The law now pro
hibits the reservation of any .more forest
lands In Oregon, Washington, Idaho,
Montana, Colorado and Wyoming, except
by act of congress. I am informed by the
department of agriculture that the gov
ernment owns other tracts of timber land
In these states which should be Included
In the forest reserves. I recommend to
congress that the limitation herein Im
posed be repealed.
"Congress ought to trust the executive
to use the power of reservation only with
respect to land most valuable for forest
purposes. During the present administra
tion, 62.250,000 acres of land largely non
timbered have been excluded from forest
reserves, and 3,500,000 acres of land prin
cipally valuable for forest purposes have
been Included In forest reserves, making
a reduction In forest reserves of non
timbered land amounting to 2,750,000
acres."
Wants Canal Fortified.
Regarding the Panama canal, the presi
dent asserts that unless unexpected ob
stacles arise the waterway, will be com
pleted well within time limit of Janu
ary 1, 1915, and within estimate of cost,
$375,000,000. Suggestions for levyinjr of
tolls and management are made, and re
garding fortification of the canal, he
says: v
"Among questions arlslntr for present
solution is the decision whether the canal
shall be fortified. I have already stated
to the congress that I strongly favor for
tification and I now reiterate this opin
ion and ask your consideration of the
subject in the light of the report already
before you made by a competent board.
"Failure to fortify the canal would
leave the attainment of both these alms
In the position of rights and obligations
which we should be powerless to enforce
and which could never In 'any way be ab
solutely safeguarded against a desperate
and Irresponsible enemy."
Ship Subsidy.
The president urges such action as he
believes will increase American trade
abroad, and says::
"Another Instrumentality Indispensable
to the unhampered and natural develop
ment of American commerce Is merchant
marine. All maritime and commercial na- ,
tlons recognize the importance of this
factor. The greatest commercial nations. I
our competitors, jealously foster their
merchant marine. Perhaps nowhere Is
the need for rapid and direct mall, pas
senger and freight communication quite
so urgent s between the United States
and latin America, W can secure In no
other-quarter of the world such Imme
diate benefits in friendship and com
merce as .would flow from the establish
ment of direct lines of communication
with the countries of Latin America ade
quate to meet the requirements of a rap
idly Increasing appreciation of the reci
procal dependence of the countries of the
western hemisphere upon each other's
products, sympathies and assistance.
"I alluded to this most Important sub
ject In my last annual message: it has
often been before yon and I need not re
capitulate the reasons (or its recommen
dation. Unless prompt action be taken
the completion of the Panama canal will
And this thm esly great commercial na
tion nnable to avail In International mari
time business of this great contribution to
the means of the world's commercial in
tercourse." -..v., ' -'.
Criticism of the Tariff.
In the space devoted to the tariff the
president says: ' .
"The schedules of the rates of duty In
the Payne tariff act have been subjected
to a great deal of criticism, some of It
just, more of it unfounded, and too much
misrepresentation. The act was adopted
In pursuance of a declaration by the par
ty which is responsible for it that cus
toms bill should . be a tariff for the pro
tection of home Industries, the measure
of the protection to be the difference be
tween the cost of producing the Imported
article abroad and the cost of producing
It at home, together with such addition to
that difference as might give a reasonable
profit to the home producer. The basis
for the criticism of this tariff Is that in
rcspact to a nun. war of the schedules the
declared measure was not followed, but a
higher difference retained or Inserted by
way of undue discrimination In favor of
certain industries and manufactures. Lit
tle, If any, of the criticism of the tariff
has been directed against the protective
principle above stated; but the main body
of the criticism has been based on the at
tempt to conform to the measure of pro
tection was not honestly and sincerely
adhered, to."
The president also refers to the appoint
ment of a board of experts to Investigate
the cost of production of various articles
included in the schedules of the tariff,
and concludes:!
"Whether or not the protective policy Is
to be continued, and the degree of protec
tion to be accorded to our home indus
tries, are questions which the people must
decide through their chosen representa
tives. But whatever policy is adopted, It
is clear that the necessary legislation
should be based on an Impartial, thor
ough and continuous study of the facts."
Recommends Parcels Post.
The adoption of the parcels post Is
again adopted. On this subject President
Taft sayfe: "With respect to the parcels
post, I respectfully recommend Its adop
tion on all rural delivery routes, and that
11 pounds the International limit be
made the limit of carriage In such post
The same argument Is made against the
parcels post that was made against the
postal savings bank that It is introduc
ing the government Into a business which
should be conducted by private persons
and is paternalism. The postofflce depart
ment has a great plant and a great or
ganization, reaching into the most remoto
hamlet of the United States, and with
this machinery It is able to do a great
many things economically that If a new
organization were necessary it would be
impossible to do without extravagant ex
penditures." Department of Justice.
Discussing the affairs of the department
of Justice, the president says:
"I invite especial attention to the prose
cutions under the federal law of the so
cal'ed 'bucket shops,' and of those
schemes to defraud In which the use of
the mail Is an essential part of the
fraudulent conspiracy, prosecutions which
have saved ignorant and weak members
of the public and are saving them hun
dreds of millions of dollars. The viola
tions of the anti-trust law present per
haps the most Important litigation before
the department, and the number of cases
filed shows the activity of the govern
ment In enforcing that statute.
liUa Et)ectymGseeJL
propriety and wisdom of enacting a gen
eral law providing for the Incorporation
of industrial and other companies engaged
in Interstate commerce, and I renew my
recommendation in that behalf."
The crying need in the United States
of cheapening the cost of litigation by
simplifying Judicial procedure and ex
pediting final judgment is pointed out and
action looking to correction of these evils
is urged. .
The president recommends an Increase
In the salaries of federal judges.
Postal Affairs.
In regard to postal matters the presi
dent points with pride to Its present effi
cient management and the recent reduc
tion In the .deficit. The present unre
stricted franking privilege comes in for
comment with a suggestion for the adop
tion of better methods for its regulation.
Abolish Navy Yards.
The president calls attention to certain
reforms urged by the secretary of the
navy which he recommends for adoption,
and continues: '
"The secretary of the navy has given
personal examination to every navy yard,
and has studied the uses of the navy
yards with reference to the necessities
of our fleet. With a fleet considerably
less than, half the size of that of the
British navy, we have shipyards " more
than double the number, and there are
several of these shipyards expensively
equipped with modern mchlnery, which,
after investigation the secretary of the
navy believes to be entirely useless for
naval purposes. He asks authority to
abandon certain of them and to move
their machinery to other places, where It
can be made of use."
Speaking of our foreign relations the
president says: "During the past year
the foreign relations of the United States
have continued upon a basis of friendship
and good understanding.
"The year has been notable as witness
ing the pacific settlement of two impor
tant international controversies before the
permanent court of The Hague.
"The arbitration of the fisheries dispute
between the United States and Great
Britain, which has been the source of
nearly continuous diplomatic correspond
ency since the fisheries convention of ISIS,
has given an award which Is satisfactory
to both parties. This arbitration is par
ticularly noteworthy not only because of
the eminently Just results secured, but
also because it is the first arbitration held
under the general arbitration treaty of
April 4, 1903. between- the United States
and Great Britain, and disposes of a con
troversy the settlement of which has re
sisted every other resource of diplomacy
and . which lor nearly ninety years has
been the cause of friction between two
countries whose common interest lies In
maintaining the most friendly and cordial
relations with each othjr. -
President Taft makes a few recommen
dations for cbangesjn the interstate com
merce law and says: - -
"Except as above, I do not recommend
any amendment to the interstate com
merce law as It stands. I do not now
recommend any amendment to the anti
trust law. In other words,- It seems to
me that" the existing legislation with
reference to the regulation of corpora
tions and the restraint of their business
has reached a point where we can stop
for a while and witness the effect of the
vigorous execution of the laws of the
statute books In retraining the abuses
which certainly did exist and whiaa
roused the jmbljo to demand reform." .
SYSTEM FULL OF URIC ACID THE
GREAT KIDNEY REMEDY CURED
Two years ago I was very sick and after
being treated by several of the best physi
cians in Clinton, I did not seem to get
any better. I was confined to my bed.
Seeing your Swamp-Root advertised, I re
solved to give it trial. After using it
for three weeks, I found I was gaining
nicely, so I continued until I have taken a
number of bottles. I am now restored to
health and have continued my labors. My
system was full of Urio acid, but Dr. Kil
mer's Swamp-Root cured me entirely. I
am sixty years old.

Significance In Names.
In an Illinois town a workingman
having been Informed that a sixth
: baby had arrived at his home, ex
; claimed: "Sufficient," and his neigh
bors, referring to his having given
that name Sufficient to the new
1 arrival, credited him with originality.
The Incident resembles a case nearer
home, adds the New York Tribune.
A New York family was blessed with
nine daughters, when the stork
' brought a tenth one. It was in the
days when the slang term for an oft-
told story was a "chestnut," and as
the baby certainly came under that
head she received the name, but for
euphony's sake the French for the
' word was employed, and she was call
ed Marron. '':'"

said, "IU not waste my time on you."

Triumph of Optimism.
"How are you feeling today, uncle?"
