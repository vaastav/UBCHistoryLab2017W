Without slavery the rebellion would

ry it could not continue
tho Irion Is of the Union thuro
diversity ol sentiment and po!
icy in regard to slavery and the Al
riuau race amongst us. Seine would
atiolish' it su idenly and without
compensation. Sjine would abol-
ish it gradually nnd with compensa
tion. Some would remove the free
people from us, aud somo would re
tain them with us, snd thorn are yet
other minor diversities. Ilocause
of these diversities we waste much

selves. Ily mutual concession we
should harmonize and act together.
This would bo a compromise among
