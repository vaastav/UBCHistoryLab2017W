nothing of importance. As usual,the Yallan
dighatn clique is venting its spleen against the
Government by offering Resolutions of Inqui
ry as to the constitutionality of this or that
measure of the President made necessary thro
tiie exigencies of the tunes. While demand
ing a strict observance of the Constitution by
the President of the United States, they cast
every possible difficulty in the way of that
President when lie endeavors to force back to
Constitutional allegiance the mrymidons ot
the South. These fellows preach Constitu
tionality 1 Verily, we may soon hear Eatau
preaching Christianity !
It is laughable to witness the ageny
under which the Democratic press is laboring
At the thought that, perhaps, one or two of
the party may prove traitorous during the
approaching session of the Legislature, and
thereby elect Simon Cameron to the Senate.
The Lock Haven Democrat thinks that the fate
of Satan, Judas Iseariot, and Benedict Arnold
should prove a warning to all Democrats to
keep clear of "treason to party" and spurn the
"proffered millions" stolen from the Govern
ment "during this abolition war !" Writhing
under the reproaches of a guilty conscience,
fully convinced of heart-sympathy with the
Rebel cause, aud well aware of the treason of
such renegades as Frank Hughes, Uld Public
Funk., Glancy Jones, and every prominent
member of the Breckinridge party, they still
plunge headlong towards the pool of treason,
of anarchy, aud of blood. Constantly harp
ing about the unconstitutionality of some of
President Lincoln's acts, they defend the Re
bels in their infernal attempt and praise them
for their effort to make the fallacy of "State
Rights" supreme. Having taken up the cue
in their defense and adopted the principle of
"rule or ruiu," they seek to divert the atten
tion of the well-meauing from Country to
Party,by crying"Abolitionism," "corruption,"
"tyranny," according to directions given in
the Charleston Afercuri /, and which have been
\
faivbfully carried out by every rattle-brained
scribbler of the Frank Hughes party in Penn
sylvania. Feeling that their choice for Sen
ator is not likely to be accepted as a leader
by the people, they dare, for the purpose of
securing their ends, openly threaten with
death any member or members of their party
who shall prove truly loyal by voting for a
man unconditionally in favor of exterminating
Treason. —M atcli your Members ! for we
have a little more than half ap idc-a that there
We a few honest men in the Democratic party.!
Tlie President's Message.
The following is from TRIBUNE in reference
to President LINCOLN'S Message :
" In the stormy era in which it has pleased
God to cast our lot, it is well that a country
1 so tried as ours should have one among its
leaders in whose integrity, patriotism,and un
calculating devotion to the noblest enls, all
may and do confide. That man is Abraham
| Lincoln. To disparage his abilities, criticise
his rhetoric, pronounce him too fast here or
! too slow there, may not be dillicult; but there
iive3 no loyal American who distrusts his ear
! nest desire to serve and to sqve the Union.!
When faction, meaning to stop just short of
! treason, aflirras that the war lor the Union is
only prosecuted for the aggrandizement of
contractors and jobbers—that those who
most earnestly support the Federal Govern-j
ment are quite as responsible for ( the Rebellion I
as those who fomented, inaugurated,and.still;
uphold it—it is confronted by the presence in '
the foreground of one man who refused to the
last to believe Treason,- Disunion and Civil
War to be seriously purposed—who, iu his
Inaugural, condescended to plead with the
architects of ruin and entreat them to pause
! iu their mad career —who hesitated to shed
I blood,, even in vindidatiou of rightful, essen
tial authority, until absolutely forced to do so
by the couspirators for Disunion commencing
the fray—and who, from that moment to the
present, has been anxiqus only to secure a re
turn, at the earliest possible moment, to the
mild sway of Law Order, and Peace.
Mr. Lincoln's Message discusses many topics
of grave interest and embodies many impor
tant suggestions ; but the interest of one sub
ject therein discussed overrides all others,and
! his expose wiii be hailed with hearty approval
! or spurned with execration as the reader sub
stantially agrees witli or dissents from bis
judgment on this point, Essentially,fhc Pres
ident se j s and proclaims that.Slavery has be
j come the implacable foe of the American Uni
on, and that the Slave Power must die in or
der that \he Republic may live. And this is
so obvioutly, so glaringly truo, that the his
torian will have difllculty in realizing that it
was ever gravely disputed.
It seems incredible that human audacity
should be equal to the task of misrepresenting
the Presidents position. '-Is he not pledged
to prosecute tie war to the sole end of restor
ing the legitimate authority of the Constitu
tion and Union I" Most certainly he is ; and 1
that is ju.-t whathe is doing. It is precisely
and only because the Slave Power is the chief,
the lundanicntal oistacle to such restoration,
that he is compelled to grapple with it in mor
tal encounter. It is Slavery—nothing under
I heaven but Slavery—that unites the lower;
! countries of Maryland—yes, and of Delaware!
;l l i0 —in bonds of living sympathy with the
f'oufedrate traitors, while a great majority of
the people of those State;, living uncursed by
the daily clank of human "etters, are and ever
have been loyal It is Slavery, and nothing
else, that makes the Old Jominion a den oi
treason, while IFwt Virginia on the contrary, j
having few slaves,. i 3 etaunuily loyal. It is
I Slavery which reverses the po.ej of Tennessee,
making her eastern division & citadel of Uni
onism, while Middle and WestTennei3ee are
ti kered with treason. So in Missouri, every j
county wherein Slavery was predominant has
swarmed with guerillas and sent lis jouth toj
swell the Rebel armies, while its fee-Labor [
communities rally instinctively uude- the old ;
dag. Hence, a healthy amount of Unionism,
in Northern Alabama and Mississippi, but!
none is perceptible in Southern ; hence v'nton
ism outspoken in New Orleans,Memphis,Hash
ville, but none to speak of (among Whitesjon
the great plantations whereby those cities are
surrounded. Who can misread these uadeni
! able facts ?
Were Slavery dead to-day, we might to
morrow muster out of service every Uvion
soldier, and still the Union would be ccrta]y
and speedily restored. Leave Slavery where
, this Jtebeliion found it, and you may kill aid
! bury e very man now in the Confederate armies !
with every one who could be induced to servej
! iu those armies, and still the Union would
; soon be again assailed, and must ultimately
fall unless its mortal foe should be killed first.
Secession i; ir. the blood of the slaveholdiug
! caste.aud will never be expelled while Slavery '
: remains.
•'Shall not the self-same mold
Produce the self-same men ?"
Slavery hat bc-en thirty rears reaching the
! conclusion that she is unequally and injuri
ously yoked with Free Labor in our Republic
—that her interests suffer, and must suffer,
from the partnership. She has summoned all
her resources for a life-and-death struggle—
; she has violently severed the ligament that
: bound her to the Free States—she may be;
temporarily coerced into submission,but never
reconciled to loyalty. The South may easily,
be reclaimed to sincere Unionism ; the Slave'
Power never can be. To it, the Union must
i ever be a loth oil memory, a symbol of hurnil
! iation ; while by the renovated South it will 1
be cherished as licr beneficent deliverer from '
the hideous nightmare that so long fettered'
and paralyzed her. The UnioD may and will i
be saved ; the Slave Power might he: both
together never can be.
Why is it that the opponents of the Presi-I
! dent's policy do not meet the real issue, in-1
stead of inventing and interposing another?!
lie would gladly have restored the Union as it I
was ; but that was not possible. He might as !
well be required now to fill a bushel basket >
with the dew of last Fourth-of-July morning,
j He can only save the Union by throttling its
i arch-enemy; and they who insist that he shall
! not do this, really desire that he should fail,let
the country go to pieces, and trust to their j
future incantations to resurrect it from the i
; witches" caldron into which its mangled re-<
mains will have been cast. The question is !
not between sieving the Union in one way and (
| another, but between saving it in the practica
ble way pointed out by the President, or not'
saving it at all. He urges Emancipation that \
j the Nation may be saved: he does not and!
never did seek to divert the War for the Union
! into a War for Emancipation. He simply pro
poses to save the country by the shortest,
easiest, surest way, and let Slavery abide the
1 consequences.
Heartily agreeing with liirn on the main
question,we differ on subordinate points with
! out reserve and without feeling. We know 1
that he believes Gradualism with Negro Ex
portation calculated to commend Emancipa
tion to the South: we believe, on the other
hand, that cur country has no laborers to ex
port, and that the planters of the South can
! not soon find laborers so easily paid and so
docile as those to whom they are accustomed
would generally prove themselves if free. And
if Slavery is to go under, we believe the slave
holders themselves would say, "Better end it
at once." Apprenticeship was the great error
of West India Emancipation .• it postponed
nearly all benefit from that measure for!
several years. We ought to profit by others' |
dear-brought experience.
But so long as the great end is kept steadily 1
in view, we can waive all incidentals. Grad"-!
ualism, Compensation, Exportation—if these,'
tubs amuse the whale, let him have them ! !
When it shall have been settled that Slavery
is to die, it will have ceased to be a power
able to corrupt priests and sub.-idize politi
' ciaus, and all will choose to be done with it
Iso soon as possible. And when vrc shall have
i ceased to enslave our fellow men, we shall all
| be amazed at the thriftless folly which gravely
I proposed the exportation of laborers by the
million from a country where such rude labor
as they are fitted for is urgently needed.
Meantime, let us be patient and work.

ed the issue in Numbers of a complete llistory
of the Great Rebellion in the United States.
The work has been for many months in course
; of preparation, by a writer every way qualified
; for the task.
The introduction contains a clear and suc
cinct account of the formation of the Confed
eracy of the States ; the formation and adop
tion of the Constitution of the United States,
and the establishment of the National Govern
ment ; the origin, developemeut and progress
of the doctrines of Nullification and Secession,
and the various phases which they assumed
until their final pulminatioa in the Great Re
bellion.
The History comprises a foil account,drawn
from the most authentic sources, of all the
, Events of the War ; the intrigues of the South
! era leaders at home and abroad ; the gradual
defection of one section ; the great Uprising
' of the People for the maintenance of the Na
] tional Life and Existence; the rapid creation
of an immense Army and Navy; and the Bat
tles by Land and Sea.
The Illustrations comprise Portraits of all
those who have borne a prominent part in the
struggle; Maps of the different localities;
Plans of the leading actions ; Views of everj
scene of iuterest, and of the most important
Battles. These illustrations are mostly from
drawings taken on the spot by artists deputed
for that purpose to accompany every division
of our Army and Navy.
Every facility at the command of the Pub
lishers has been employed in the preparation
and execution of this work ; and they confi
dently believe it will form the most trustwor
i thy and valuable history which can be pre
! pared of the Great Struggle for the American
j Union.
