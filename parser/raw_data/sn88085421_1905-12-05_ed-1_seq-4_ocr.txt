AS TO DIVORCE.
"Clergymen may inveigh against
the divorce evil, but if good is to come,
newspapers must intercede," says
Judge Bishop of the St. Louis circuit
court. The learned judge's idea seemed
to be that the newspapers, by ridicul
ing many of the alleged causes for di
vore, could laugh them out of court.
Inasmuch as the judge made this
statement after he had finished the job
of separating eighteen couples at a
single session, perhaps this would be
a good point of departure for the
newspaper writer. Let them comment
airily upon the immaculate wisdom
and all-pervading judgment of a man
who can in five hours, learn all about
the marital infelicities of thirty-six
individuals and decide that they ought
not to see one another any more.
This is probably an exaggeration of
what this judge did. He very likely
had the cases under other considera
tion and merely registered his decrees
at a single session. Nevertheless, there
is considerable ground for belief that
divorces are granted with too much
dispatch by many courts.
Judge Bishop remarks that there are
too many grounds for divorce. Infi
delity, desertion and the commission
of an infamous crime are, in his opin
ion, good grounds, hut there are
scarcely any others. There are two
others, which are extensively used —ip-
compatibility and cruel and inhuman
treatment. Incompatibility is a some
what vague and general complaint. It
is sometimes real and sometimes imag
inary. The presiding judge may find
it imaginary when it is real and real
when it is imaginary. There is scarce
ly any scientific line for him to draw.
Perhaps his breakfast may have some
thing to dp with it.
Cruel and inhuman treatment is not
so uncertain and yet there are ele
ments of vagueness in this class of di
vorce complaints. How much of the
so-called cruel and inhuman treatment
testimony is perjury and how much
the result of distorted views of life
cannot be known with certainty, but
surely a great deal of it is so. When
neighbors cannot have a dispute over
the clandestine visits of a few hens to
a garden without developing in the
whole neighborhood a profound ignor
ance of the truth, it is possible to
imagine what it may come to when
man and wife fall out.
But perhaps it is useless to blame
the courts for granting divorces too
easily or the clergy for marrying
couples too readily. The trouble orig
inated long before they were called in.
Divorce begins before marriage. Judges
who have tried many cases agree sub
stantially that most divorce cases orig
inate in too short courtships. The
couple took a violent fancy to one an
other and were married before they
had become acquainted. Soon the glam
our wore off and resort to the courts
-for a separation was the next step.
ABOUT READY TO QUIT.
—: cording to the Chicago Tribune's
Washington correspondent, the rate
regulation fight is about finished. He
may be too sanguine of this result, but
he states that Senator Aldrich of
Rhode Island, Senator Cullom of New
Jersey and Senator Foraker of Ohio
held a conference last week in which
they adm'tted to each other and to
themselves that they might as well ac-

cept the inevitable and agree to the
enactment of the president's plan into
legislation at this coming session of
congress.
Senator Cullom is said to have
drafted a bill which is to be the basis
of the measure to be finally passed by
the senate. This bill confers upon the
interstate commerce commission the
authority to make a new rate when the
existing rate has been found to be un
reasonable, and to fix not only maxi
mum reasonable rates, but minimum
reasonable rates to prevent unjust dis
crimination. It provides that the rate
shall into effect not less than ten
days and not more than thirty days
after it is formally promulgated. The
courts are to be made accessible for
review in case the railroad or the ship
per seeks to appeal from the commis
sion.
This change in the attitude of men
like Aldrich and Foraker, and it is
said also to include Elkins, is attribut
ed* to the conclusion that the presi
dent's railroad program is going to
pass the senate by democratic votes if
fails of general republican support
and the senate leaders realize that it
will not do to allow the democrats to
claim credit for having given the
country legislation which is so gener
ally favored as this.
If the Tribune correspondent is
right the president has won a notable
victory; but whether this victory has
been won already or whether the oppo
sition is still standing out, the final re
sult appears to be no longer in doubt.
If the senate defeats the president's
program, the issue is sure to become
political, and the result of a popular
vote on this question it would not be
hard to foresee. It is this phase of the
matter which is undoubtedly influen
cing the senate leaders who have been
so strenuously opposing rate legisla
tion. Discouraged as to any compro
mise with the president, who has de
clared compromise impossible on any
other basis than that of surrender, the
senators have apparently decided that
they might as well do the surrendering
now.
New York Mills hotel No. 3, to be
erected at once, will have fifteen stories
and 1900 rooms. Each room will be 6
feet by 8 feet 6 inches, lighted by elec
tric light and furnished with iron bed
stead, chair and chiffonier. The bed
will be provided with a spring and a
hair mattress and the bedding will be
of the best. The prices for rooms will
be either 25 or 30 cents a night. This
is philanthropy, but Mr. Mills makes
money on it. The other hotels are
not philanthropic, but then they make
more money.
An English engineer just arrived in
New York claims to have evolved a
system which will beat the bank of
Monte Carlo every time. There is such
a system in existence, but it is too
cumbersome to be effective. It involves
the use of 300 men armed with shot
guns or the application of dynamite. It
musses up the place frightfully.
Not long ago Russia forbade the
purchase and use of typewriters with
out police permission. The order was
to prevent the dissemination of type
written revolutionary circulars. Now
the typewriter companies are having
machines built with an extra magazine
of consonants and are moving on the
czar's works.
A Washington philosopher said that
the difference between a certain
brilliant official and Secretary Taft
was that everybody admired Mr. So
and-So, but everybody liked Taft. They
say that large bodies move slowly, but
Mr. certainly moved rapidly
into the public liking.
A Berlin dispatch declares the Ger
man nation is disgusted with the
"frauds committed in the recent New
York election." There are several
people in Germany who get disgusted
whenever any proposition to put any
thing in the hand of the people is
broached.
The city of Walla Walla had some
experience with "continuous stave pipe
built on the ground." as recommended
hy Engineer Thomson, in the Worley
flume on East Alder street. That flume
ha s burst half a dozen times in as
many different places and has been a
constant source of trouble, worry and
annoyance ever since it was laid. One
can easily imagine what 13*4 miles of
such pipe in the proposed gravity sys
tem would mean. Engineer Weile says
that no one but an expert can lay such
pipe satisfactoily, and Walla Walla's
experience with Expert Worley con
firms the statement.

ASKS PAY FOR DRILLING WELL
JOHN KINDER BEGINS SUIT
AGAINST WILLIAM PEIPER,
RULO RANCHER.
Alleges That He Drilled a 600 Foot
Well on Ranch and Never
Got a Cent.
John D. Kinder, a well driller, began
suit in the superior court this morning
against William Peiper, a Rulo ranch
er, to collect the sum of $2248.50 al
leged to be due him for sinking a 600-
foot well on Peiper's ranch last fall;
$6 alleged to be due as fees he paid
out for filing a laborer's lien against
Peiper's ranch and $250 attorney's fees.
Kinder in his complaint, which was
filed by Attorney R. H. Ormsbee of
Waitsburg, alleges that he and Peiper
entered into an agreement last July
whereby Kinder was to drill a 60*0-foot
well on Peiper's ranch near Rulo sta
tion. He was to receive 50 cents, a
foot for dirt work; $3 per foot for all
rock work the first 100 feet; $3.50 per
foot for rock in the second 100 feet,
and $4 per foot for all rock in the
rest of the way down to the 600 feet.
Peiper, he says, also agreed to pay $1
per foot for all casting used.
Kinder alleges that he performed his
part of the agreement and specifies
that Pieper owes him the following
amounts: Eleven feet dirt work at
50 cents per foot, $5.50; 89 feet rock
in first 100 feet at $3 per foot, $267;
100 feet of rock in the second 100 feet
at $3.5*0 a foot, $350; 400 feet of rock
at $4 a; foot, $1600; 26 feet casing at
$1 per foot, $26; total, $2248.50.
To secure his claim Kinder filed a
lien on Peiper's land and in his suit
he asks that it be made permanent.
COUNCIL T0 MEET TONI6HT
Committee of the Whole Did Not Meet
Last Night.
Owing to the inability of Council
man Martin to be present the meeting
of the city council as a committee of
the whole scheduled last night was
postponed. Tonight the council will
meet in regular session when the sub
ject of employing an engineer for the
new proposed water system will be
considered, along with other matters
of interest to the taxpayers.
The Curzons in London.
NEW YORK, Dec. s.—Lord and
Lary Curzon arrived today and were
met by a great crowd of Distinguish

ception.
DR. DARRRiN IN TOWN.
He Is Stopping at the Hotel Walla
Walla and Will Remain Till
December 20.
Dr. Darrin, the celebrated physician
who makes the eye, ear, nose and
throat a specialty, besides treating all
diseases and complications of the
heart, liver, kidneys and bladder, ar
rived in Walla Walla this morning and
has opened offices in the Hotel Walla
Walla on East Main street, opposite
the old Hunt depot, for a few weeks
only, until December 20, to accommo
date the afflicted in this vicinity, who
cannot afford to take a journey to
large cities to consult specialists. Dr.
Darrin's reputation is so well known
that the afflicted throughout this part
of the country should not hesitate to
avail themselves of his phenominal
skill.
Dr. Darrin has all the latest appli
ances for the cure of chronic and
deep-seated diseases. All diseases of
a private nature —"nervous debility,"
the result of excess, overwork or dis
sipation—positively cured. The charges
are very low and consultation free to
those taking treatment.
Sufferers from rheumatism, asthma,
consumption, catarrh, dyspepsia, in
digestion, tape worms, scrofula, fe
male weakness, cancer, heart disease,
malaria, urinary troubles, piles, bowel
troubles, fistulas, ulcerations and all
diseases of whatsoever nature should
call upon him.
Consultation and Examination Free.
A friendly talk will cost nothing and
may save years of suffering, and per
haps your life. Young, middle-aged
or old men, suffering from the effects
of follies and excesses restored to
perfect health, manhood and vigor.
Ladies suffering from any complica
tion of female trouble should call and
have a free consultation (and exami
nation if necessary) with this success
ful specialist, who has restored many
a sick woman to health after other
doctors have failed.
Each visitor is seen privately and all
communications received in sacred
confidence. No sufferer should fail to
call on him during his visit,, as
it may be the last opportunity of see
ing him in a long time.
WILL WORK IN HARMONY
WASHINGTON DELEGATION IN
CONGRESS DETERMINE ON
PLAN OF ACTION.
Will Hold Weekly Meetings in Sena
tor Ankeny's Office to Consider
Appointments and Legislation.
The Washington delegation has
formed a hard and fast combination
to squelch unsuccessful candidates for
office, and also to get things in con
gress and the departments for the
state. Preliminary to a visit to the
interior department next Saturday, the
delegation met in Senator Ankeny's
office and discussed legislation and
other matters affecting Washington
state, is the report that comes from
Washington city.
It was agreed that a bill for the ces
sion of the south half of the Colville
reservation should be introduced as
soon as Inspector McLaughlin's report
of the conference reported in press dis
patches today reaches Washington,
and its terms are fully known.
The combine or harmony agreement
came later. It was agreed that in order
to achieve results it was necessary to
have harmony in the delegation. This
applied to filling offices, rushing legis
lation, and affairs in the departments
affecting the state. With this agree
ment as a starter it was arranged
that weekly conferences should be held
in Senator Ankeny's room, Monday
to be meeting day, and the hour 10
o'clock.
In the discussion Senators Piles and
Ankeny declared they would not in
terfere with house members' selec
tions of postmasters unless some man
personally obnoxious to one or both of
them is presented for indorsement.
Division Remains Same.
Division of territory among the
three congressmen is the same as here-
tofore, Jones having jurisdiction east
of the mountains, Cushman and
Humphrey dividing that part of the
state west of the mountains. All
other offices belong to the senators, the
house members share in filling these
offices being indirect.
The first meeting was held yester
day and the first case considered was
the selection of a register of the land
office at North Yakima to fill the
place vacated by the death of Register
Henman. Three candidates from
North Yakima already in the field are:
Z. Y. Coleman, Capt. Alfred C. Stein
man and L. S. Howlett.
This plan of united action is in
vogue in other states, notably South
Dakota, where disappointed candidates
have found themselves without any
place to appeal from the decision of
the delegation. The appointing power
always looks to the delegation for in
formation as to the qualifications of
candidates and with united indorse
ment, assumes everything is all right
and the selection of the delegation goes
through to appointment without a
hitch.
Smooth Out Differences.
With this system in operation in the
Washington delegation, everything will
be lovely here, and disappointed office
seekers will be forced to content them
selves with laying for a chance to get
even at some future time. It is ex
pected there will be internal dissen
sions among the members of the dele
gation over some of the offices, but all
these differences will be smoothed out
before any recommendations are made.
Other features of the agreement, such
as to work together on all legislative
and departmental questions are admit
ted'to h«e good ones. That it is good was
demonstrated when the delegation se
cured an approval of the Okanagon ir
rigation project by the secretary of
the interior. They expect united ac
tion will secure other things for the
state, notably in connection with the
Puget Sound navy yard.
The surprising thing about the
agreement is that Cushman indorses
it. Usually the Tacoma congressman
has been found bucking the senators,
but he said he would join heartily in
the "harmony" meetings.
Entertainment Club Reunion.
NEW YORK, Dec. s.—The entertain
ment club ,the principal object of
which is the development of friendly
relations with representatives of for
eign countries, will hold its tenth annu
al reunion at the Waldorf-Astoria this
evening. The reunion and banquet will
be "in honor of our British cousins."
The guest of honor will be the British
ambassador, who will be accompanied
by Lady Durand, Miss Durand and
many members of his official staff.
Among the other guests will be Sir
Percy Sanderson, Mrs. Craigie, Miss
Eliot, Count and Countess Massiglia,
the president of the St. George and
other societies. Robert B. Roosevelt,
the brother of the president, will pre
side and there will be flve-minutt
speeches by Gen. Miles, Gen. Woodford,
Borough President Littleton and many
others.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
(Continued From Page Three.)
the policy of other nations by provid
ing adequate national supervision o'
commercial interests which are clear
ly national in character. My prede
cessors have repeatedly recognized
that the foreign business of these com
panies is an important part of our
foreign commercial relations. Dur
ing the administrations of Presidents
Cleveland, Harrison and McKinley, the
state department exercised its influ
ence, through diplomatic channels, to
prevent unjust discrimination by for
eign countries against American in
surance companies. These negotiations
illustrated the propriety of the con
gress recognizing the national char
acter of insurance, for in the absence
of federal legislation the state depart
ment could only give expression to the
wishes of the authorities of the sev
eral states, whose policy was inef
fective through want of uniformity.
I repeat my previous recommenda
tion that the congress should also
consider whether the federal govern
ment has any power or awes any du
ty with respect to domestic transac
tions in insurance of an interstate
character. That state supervision
has proved inadequate is generally
conceded. The burden upon insurance
companies, and therefore their policy
holders, of conflicting regulations of
many states, is unquestioned, while
but little effective check is imposed
upon any able and unscrupulous man
who desires to exploit the company
in his own interest at the expense of
the policy holders and of the pub
lic. The inability of a state to regu
late effectively insurance corporations
created under the laws of other states
and transacting the larger part of
their part of their business elsewhere
is also clear. As a remedy for this
evil of conflicting, ineffective, and yet
burdensome regulations there has
been for many years a widespread de
mand for federal supervision. The
congress has already recognized that
interstate insurance may be a propei
subject for federal legislation, for in
creating the bureau of corporations it
authorized it to publish and supply
useful information concerning inter
state corporations, "'including corpo
rations engaged in insurance." It is
obvious that if the compilation of
statistics be the limit of the federal
power, it is wholly ineffective to reg
ulate this form of commercial inter
course between the states, and as the
insurance business has outgrown in
magnitude the possibility of adequate
state supervision, the congress should
carefully consider whether further
legislation can be had. What is said
above applies with equal force to fra
ternal and benevolent organizations
which contract wor life insurance.
Federal Elections.
In my last message I said:
"The power of the government to
protect the integrity of the elections
of its own officials is inherent and has
been recognized and affirmed by re
peated declarations of the supreme
court. There is no enemy of free gov
ernment more dangerous and none so
insidious as the corruption of the elec
torate. No one defends or excuses
corruption, and it would seem to fol
low that none would oppose vigorous
measures to eradicate it. I recom
mend the enactment of a law directed
against bribery and corruption in fed
eral elections. The details of such a
law may be safely left to the wise dis
cretion of the congress, but it should
go as far as un ler the constitution it
is possible to g >, and should include
severe penalties against him who
gives or receives a bribe intended to
influence his act or opinion as an
elector; and provisions for the pub
lication not only of the expenditure
for nominations and elections of all
candidates, but also of all contribu
tions received and expenditures made
by political committees."
I desire to repeat i-.is recommenda
tion. In political campaigns in a
country as large and populous as ours
it is inevitable that there should b«-
much expense of an entirely legiti
mate kind. This, of course, means that
many contributions, and some of them
of large size, must be made, and, as
a matter of fact, in any big political
contest such contributions are always
made to both sides. It is entirely
proper both to give and receive them,
unless there is an improper motive
connected with either gift or recep
tion. If they are extorted by any kind
of pressure or promise, express or im
plied, direct or indirect, in the way of
favors or immunity, then the giving
or receiving becomes not only im
proper but criminal. It will undoubt
edly be difficult as a matter of prac
tical detail to shape an act wh , ,
shall guard with reasonable cert "
against such misconduct; \, u[

verified publication in detail of an ,
sums cantributed to and expended

method of stopping the evils aimed *
in corrupt practices acts v nf
should both th e national and the se •'
eral state legislatures forbid ftnv
cer of a corporation from using th e
money of the corporation in or a H„
any election, but they should also fo r .
bid such use of money in connection
with any legislation save by the em
ployment of counsel in public manner
for distinctly legal services.
Public-Land Laws.
Once again I call your attention ta
the condition of the public-land law*
Recent developments have given new
urgency to the need for such change
as will fit these laws to actual present
conditions. The honest disposal and
right use of the remaining p U b lie
lands is of fundamental importance
The iniquitous methods by which the
monopolizing of the public land is be
ing brought about under the present
laws are becoming more generally
known, but the existing laws d 0 110t
furnish effective remedies. The
omendations of the public lands
commission upon this subject are wise
and should be given effect.
The creation of small irrigated farms
under the reclamation act is a power
ful offset to the tendency of certain
other laws to foster or permit monop
oly of their land. Under that act the
the construction of great irrigation
works has been proceeding rapidly
and successfully, the lands reclaimed
are eagerly taken up, and the pros
pect that the policy of national irriga
tion will accomplish all that was ex
pected of it is bright. The act should
be extended to include the state of
Texas.
The reclamation act derives much
of its value from the fact that it tends
to secure the greatest possible num
ber of homes on the land, and to ire
ate communities of freeholders, in part
by settlement on public land, in part
by forcing the subdivision of large pri
vate holdings before they can get
water from government irrigation
works. The law requires that no
right to the use of the water for land
in private ownership shall be sold for
a tract exceeding 160 acres to any one
land owner. This provision has ex
cited active and powerful hostility, but
the success of the law itself depends
on the wise and firm enforcement of
it. We can not afford to substitute
tenants for freeholders on the public
domain.
The greater part of the remaining
public lands can not be irrigated. They
are at present and will probably al
ways be of greater value for grazing
than for any other purposes. This fact
has led to the grazing homestead of
640 acres in Nebraska and to the pro
posed extension of it to other s-atts.
It is argued that a family can not be
supported on 160 acres of arid graz
ing land. This is obviously true: but
neither can a family be supported on
640 acres of much of the land to which
it is proposed to apply the grazing
homestead. To establish universally
any such arbitrary limit would be un
wise at the present time. It would
probably result on the one hand in en.
larging the holdings of some of the
great land owners, and on the other
in needless suffering and failure on the
part of a very considerable proportion
of the bona fide settlers who give
faith to the implied assurance of the
government that such an area is effi
cient. The best use of the public
grazing lands requires the careful ex
amination and classification of these
lands in order to give each settler land
enough to support his family and no
more. While this work is -feeing done,
and until the lands are settled, the
government should take control of the
open range, under reasonable regula
tions suited to local needs, following
the general policy already in success
ful operation on the forest reserves. »
is probable that the present grazing
value of the open public range > s
scarcely more than half what it once
was or what it might easily be again
under careful regulation.
The forest policy of the administra
tion appears to enjoy the unbroken
support of the people. The great u?ers
of timber are themselves forward"*
