LABOR
COMING NORTH
Southern Efforts to Check the
Movement.
Atlanta, Ga., Dec. 5.—In an effort
to check the widespread migration
of southern negroes to northern la
bor fields, negro leaders and white
economists have joined forces and at
mass meetings which are being held
generally are pointing out that no
permanent gain awaits the average
negro in the north. It is estimated
that fully 100,000 negroes already
have left the Southern states since
the northward movement began last
summer.
Alluring offers of high wages and
easy work made by labor agents in
all parts of the South appear to
have met with a general response
from negroes in all sections. Var
ied reasons have been advanced for
the apparent willingness of many
negroes to leave their homes.
A serious shortage of labor in
the cotton fields next spring and
summer is feared if the exodus con
tinues.
When the movement began sev
eral months ago it was not viewed
seriously but when labor agents were
successful in inducing thousands of
negroes to go north to work, em
ployers of labor in the south became
alarmed.
In most cases the southern ne
groes have been placed where labor
has been scarce in the more thickly
populated districts. Reports of
their welfare vary but those which
have gained the widest circulation
in the south tell of hardships suffer
ed principally because of the cold
weather which the negro as a race
cannot stand.
PARDON PETITION CIRCULATED.
Casselton, N. D., Dec. 5.—Peti
tions were circulated here today ask
ing President Wilson to pardon Wil
liam F. Kittel, former banker who
shortly will be sentenced for partici
pation in the affaire of the First Ra
tional ba/ik 'of this city.
The fact that the stork just visit
ed the Kittel home is responsible
for the plea going to the president.
SWINDLED RELATIVES
OF DEAD PERSONS
The St. Paul Dispatch of Monday
refers to the arrest of a man named
Bert Frederick, said to have been of
Jamestown, N. D., who is alleged to
have built up a swindling system
that "worked" relatives of dead
persons.
The Dispatch says:
That Fredericks subscribed to a
clipping bureau to obtain the names
and addresses of dead men and wom
en whose relatives he victimized, is
alleged by Detective Bert Carr, who
arrested the man, after trailing him
for many days.
To these dead persons Frederick,
it is charged, shipped cheap books
for which he charged top-notch
prices. Letters sent with the con
signment stated that "in response to
your order, we ship the following
goods."
Relatives opening the letters and
the packages supposed that the
dead person had ordered the goods
and usually paid, the police say.
Express Companies Give Clue.
Express companies complaining of
many refused shipments sent by the
Northwestern Supply company,
which they could not find, gave the
police the first clue.
Detective Carr arrested Frederick
at the Hamilton hotel, 105 East
Fifth street.
STAGGERING SUMS
FOR TAXPAYERS
Washington, Dec. 4.—Estimates
of the expense of all branches of the
government for the fiscal year 1918
total $1,268,715,834.
This is exclusive of $325,355,820
for the postal service which is ex
pected to be returned by postal rev
enue, and a sinking fund appropria
tion of $60,748,000 toward the pub
lic debt.
The total appropriations for the
fiscal year 1917 ending next June ex
clusive of these two items were $1,
84,157,517.
The increase of some $74,000,000
represents the general trend of the
constantly increased cost of govern
ment as well as- the increased cost
of living. Increases in compensa
tion and in numbers of employes are
to be found in the estimates of all
branches of the government and to
meet \that tendency administration
officials have attempted a policy of
paring down all proposals for new
projects with the exceptions of na
tional defense and expenditures to

SUPREME COURT
CONTROVERSY
Regarding Time New Judges
Take Seats.
The three retiring justices of the
supreme court, Messrs. Fisk, Burke
and Goss, strenulously object to re
tiring from the bench until January
1, when they claim their terms of
office expire. Saturday there was
action taken in the matter. The su
preme court called in three district
judges to sit temporarily with the
two holdover justices, and with a
supreme court thus composed issued
a writ against the three justices re
cently elected, calling upon the new
justices to appear before the supreme
court at 2 o'clock next Thursday af
ternoon to show cause why they
(the new justices) should be allow
ed to take their seats the first Mon
day in December.
Claim Title to Office Monday.
The justices-elect have been con
tending that, under the constitution,
they are entitled to office the first
Monday in December. The present
judges contend they have a right to
their seats till the first Monday in
January, under a custom heretofore
observed but which the new justices
deny is binding.
Under the action of the improvised
supreme court, which issued the.
writ the final determination of the
controversy is to be left to five dis
trict judges, of whom three will be
the district judges called in yester
day, the other two to be chosen lat
er.
The judges called into the case
yesterday by the supreme court are
Judge Pollock of Fargo, Judge Han
ley of Mandan and Judge Nuessle of
Bismarck.
Justice-elect Robinson and Grace
arrived in Bismarck Sunday night
and filed their oaths of office with
the Secretary of State Monday. Jus
tice-elect Birdzell also sent his oath
of office but did not appear person
ally: December 5 the newly elected
judges expected to get their certifl
cates of election and on presentation
of the same to the provisional su
preme court declared that they
would take their oaths of office and
begin the term. Justice Robinson is
quoted as saying:
"No court has any jurisdiction in
this matter above that vested by the
constitution. We are proceeding un
der the constitution, and we expect
the judges to have enough good
sense and dignity not to attempt to
overrule the constitution."
It is also understood that the
new justices-elect do not want to
appear as over anxious to take pos
session of their new office, but claim
ing that their terms of office begin
December 4, declare that they should
not allow any lapse of time to inter
vene and that they should qualify at
this time in order to make sure of
the legality of any decisions and any
actions that may be taken by them
later. The order of the provisional
supreme court for the new justices
to show Dec. 7, which of the three
sets of judges are legally entitled to
sit and act as members of the court
in December, was issued by the pro
visional supreme court at the re
quest of Attorney General Linde.
Justices Fisk, Goss and Burke did
not participate in the issuance of
the order, and Justices Bruce and
Christenson, considering themselves
disqualified, were excused, the order
being issued by the district judges
called in as above stated.
It is rumored in Bismarck that if
the judges-elect are not given their
seats they will wait until January 1,
and throw aside all decisions handed
down by the present justices between
now and January 1.
A dispatch from Bismarck to a
Fargo paper last night said:
This evening, in discussing one ob
jection to the immediate accession
of new members, that some 50 cases
now on calendar and which already
have been argued would need to be
reargued, Robinson said:
"It would be an exceptional case
in which this would be true. There
would still be two members on the
bench who had heard the original ar
gument and the new members could
be expected to rely on their judg
ment for points covered in the argu
ment but not in the briefs. As a
matter of fact, if the court had. as
retiring members claimed in their
campaign, kept up with its work,
this question could not arise.
Will Speed Up Work.
"One reform I hope to see insti
tuted immediately is the elimina
tion of this unnecessary delay in
court proceedure. The duties of the
court are not onerous! I would un
dertake myself to do all the work
that is required of the supreme
court.
"If the court meets daily and puts
in an honest day's work so long as
there Is work to do there will be no
possibility of work piling up to a
point where there are 50 cases, or
even a dozen case* ahead of the

BATTLE SHIPS
CONTRACTED FOR
Dreadnaughts, Submarines
Cruisers Will Defend
Coast.
and
Washington, Dec. J.— Secretary
Daniels awarded contracts today for
more than $65,000,000 worth of new
fighting ships for the navy, including
four battleships at $11,000,000 each
two fleet submarines at approximate
ly $1,190,000 each and 27 coast sub
marines at from $694,000 to $698,
000 each.
These vessels comprise the bulk of
the great building program of 66
craft of various types appropriated
for by the last congress. Bids for
four battle cruisers will be received
Dec. 6 and for three scout cruisers
Jan. 3, with the hope of completing
the task of getting all the ships un
der contract within the six months
limit set by congress.
House Committee at Work.
Already the house naval commit
tee is at work on the 1918 bill and
early in the spring the department
must find building facilities for at
least three more battleships, one bat
tle cruiser and a proportionate num
ber of other craft remaining on the
three-year construction program. The
bill to be put thru this winter for the
navy will carry & total of nearly
$400,000,000.
Contracts for two battleships each
were awarded today to the New
York Shipbuilding company and the
Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry
Dock company. Three of the new
submarines will be built by the Cali
fornia Shipbuilding company of Long
Beach, Cal. 18 coast and one 850
ton fleet submersibles went to the
Electric boat company of" New York,
and the remaining six small boats
and one 850 tonner went to the Lake
Torpedo Boat company of Bridge
port, Conn.
Sister Ships to California.
The new battleships will be sister
ships to the California and Tennes
see, now under construction, except
*hat they will be fitterf'Sffcarry eight
16-inch rifles instead of twelve 14
inch. The department now is con
sidering plans for the 1918 ships,
three in number, carrying twelve 1 6
inch guns and to make 23 or 24
knots an hour instead of 21 knots,
the present battleship standard of
the navy.
The two first submarines will be of
the so-called 800-ton type and simi
lar in size to the German U-53. A
third boat of this size will be laid
down at the Portsmouth navy yard
where the L-8 is nearing completion.
The type is experimental and for
comparison with the 1,300-ton
Schley, now being built for the navy
with a required surface speed of 20
knots, against the 16-foot 800-ton
type.
The coast submarines will range
between 475 and 550 tons, according
to design, being substantially similar
to the most recent submersible of the
class completed for the navy.
USING MONTANA AND N.
DAKOTA WHEAT MIXTURE
Arthur Miller of Minneapolis
general superintendent of the Rus
sell-Miller Milling Co., is spending a
few days in the city, looking after
matters connected with the com
pany's milling interest at this point.
The Jamestown mill is running at
full capacity day and night. The
cleaning department has been entire
ly reconstructed. More separators
and other cleaning machinery have
been installed to separate the foul
stuff from the milling grain. None
of the light weight wheat of this
year's crop is being ground at the
mill, nothing under 49 pounds.
Wheat used is mixed with heavier
wheat from Montana and the west
ern part of the state. Most of the
Montana wheat this year weighs 62
pounds to the bushel and the mix
ture makes a very excellent flour.

COURIER-NEWS
SALE RESISTED
Dr. Guild Begins Mortgage
Foreclosure Proceedings.
The aftermath of the sale of the
Fargo Courier News to the Non-Par
tisan Publishing Co., has been an
unexpected objection raised by Dr.
L. T. Guild who sold his interest
about three weeks ago to Messrs.
Marsh and Fentress, newspaper men
from Iowa. The new management of
the Courier News says:
Dr. Guild holds a mortgage on the
plant of the Courier-News which in
no way, since his sale of the paper,
gives liini any control of it or its
policy or ownership. A provision of
the mortgage provides that he lias a
right to foreclose it at any time the
property, which is his security, if it
is being impaired or dissipated. This
is a perfunctory provision in all
mortgages.
Serves Notice of Suit.
Dr. Guild has served notice on the
Courier-News and on Messrs. Marsh
and Fentress, demanding immediate
payment of his mortgage, on threat
of foreclosure under the provision of
the mortgage above mentioned. He
claims the paper has fallen into ir
responsible hands, that its value will
be destroyed and the security of the
mortgage impaired.
Dr. Guild also claims there has
been a default on the mortgage in
terest, which is payable monthly.
This interest was paid him last
night and later returned by him.
The Non-Partisan Publishing com
pany will resist to the limit Dr.
Guild's attempt to hamper the new
management. All bis allegations
regarding the incompetency and ir
responsibility of the new owners
must, of course, be substantiated in
court, and ample evidence of the
responsibility and competency of the
new owners will be offered.
Suit was filed Saturday against
the Courier-News Co., and Marsh
Fentress for the sum of $37,000 al
leged to be due him in a preliminary
action of foreclosure by Dr. Guild
who holds a mortgage, stated by Chas.
E. Marsh to be in the sum of $27,319,
the first principal .paym^n^f which
is not due till May 1, 1917. Mr.
Marsh's statement says:
"Dr. Guild has opposed the prin
cipals and personnel of the Non-Par
tisan League, members of which
have bought control of the paper.
Not Released from Liability.
"Mr. Fentress and myself, to
whom Dr. Guild .sold his interest,
are in no way released by our sale
from our liability to Dr. Guild. Dr.
Guild now has stronger security for
his debt than lie had previous to the
present sale.
"My partner and myself further
protected his interest by arranging
a $12,500 payment on his debt May
1, instead of a $5,000 payment, as
his mortgage provides.
"I believe Dr. Guild's intense poli
tical convictions have biased his
judgment as to the security of his
mortgage, and that in this sense his
proposed foreclosure proceedings
are political in their origin.'"
In a communication to Dr. Guild
enclosing the interest money up to
December 1, in currency, Mr. Fen
tress said:
"In this connection,
tI
must say
that I am very much surprised at
your action regarding this matter,
as you will undoubtedly remember
that we had a verbial agreement,
made at offices of our attorneys, in
which it was mutually agreed that
the interest was to be paid on the
15th of each month."
The price agreed to be paid by
the Non-Partisan Publishing Co. to
Marsh and Fentress is not stated,
but it is reported that they "cleaned
up over $10,000 over the price
they paid Guild."
$800,000,000 FOR WAR.
Washington, Dec. 4.—Kstimates
for maintaining and strengthening
the army and navy during the fiscal
year 1918 indicate that congress will
be asked this winter to provide about
$800,000,000 for that purpose.
The total estimate is $757,984,560
to cover the military activities of
both departments. Statements by
navy officials to the house naval
committee, now considering that bill,
have foreshadowed, however, large
supplementary estimates to be sub
twitted later, and a similar situation
exists at the war department.
The preliminary, estimate for the
army is $373,074,565, an increase of
about $70,000,000 over the amount
appropriated for 1917. The navy
total of $379,151,701 is an increase
of $66,451,146 over 1917 figures.
Panama canal fortifications will take
$5,358,300, an increase of about
$300,000.

SATl llD.W'S I'KOCKIODINtiS
With the court room filled to its
capacity the state opened its case
against Albert Mammenga for the
murder of Andrew Sonnek, Saturday
afternoon at 2 o'clock. .Mrs. Mam
menga, wife of the accused, together
with her three children followed the
testimony of the witnesses with
strained interest. -Mrs. Andrew Son
nek, wife of the deceased man, sat.
with her three boys, Kenneth, aged
13, Armon, aged 9 and Ronald, aged
7. Mrs. Hoy Torrey, a sister of the
deceased man, accompanied Mrs.
Sonnek.
The father and a brother of the
accused are also attending the trial,
as is Miss Cecelia Betts, a niece of
Sonnek.
W. S. I tn
Mammenga then pushed Sonnek
back over the platform and had his
hands on his throat when Hoy Tor
rey, the engineer, told the men to
"cut it out." They got up, walked a
few feet from the thresher and be
gan to tussle again. Sonnek was
thrown to the ground and Mammen
ga landed on his knees at Sonnek's
side. It was while lie was in this
position, according to the witness,
that Mammenga thrust liis knee in
to Sonnek's stomach. The men were
separated and Sonnek got up, walk
ed to the separator and then started
to the cook-car but fell upon his
face before reaching the car. He was
then taken in Roy Torrey's car, by
Mr. Torrey, to his home. Later Dr.
Guest was called and took the vic
tim to Jamestown, where he died a
few hours later.
In the cross examination, conduc
ed by Attorney Freerks, which fol
lowed the questioning by Attorney
Thorp, who is assisting State's At
torney Chase, Baldwin asserted that
he could not hear all that the men
said before the struggle began but
that he was certain that Mammenga
was swearing.
Kay Baldwin Gives Testimony.
The second witness for the state,
Ray Baldwin, is the son of the first
witness. Ray asserted that he was
17 years old and was on his father's
bundle wagon at the time of the be
ginning of the trouble. The first
thing that the witness noticed was
that Mammenga was swearing or
"cussing" but the exact words used
•iy the defendant were forgotten.
Ray asserted that Mammenga shook
his fist at Sonnek and then struck at
him. When questioned further
about Mammenga striking Sonnek,
he replied, "I am not sure that he
struck him but I am sure that he
struck at him."
The witness was then asked by At
torney Thorp to illustrate just the
manner in which Mammenga grab
bed Sonnek when he was on the en
gine platform. In complying with
this request Baldwin grasped Mr.
Thorp near the waist line. He fur
ther asserted that when Sonnek was
lying across the platform of the en
gine that Mammenga had his hands
at Sonnek's throat and said, "Shut
up or I will choke you to d4ath." He
also said something more but this
ALBERT MAMMENGA IS
GUILTY, JURY'S VERDICT
Recommends Five Years Sen
tence for Accused.
After deliberating from 11:30 yesterday morning to 9:45 last
evening, the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter in the first
degree and recommended a sentence of five years in the state
penitentiary. This is the shortest sentence which could be given
under the law for the conviction of manslaughter in the first
degree, as the law prescribes that the sentence shall be from five
to fifteen years' imprisonment.
Attorneys Carr and Freerks announced this morning that the
case would be appealed.
Id win is First Witness for
State.
According to the story told by Mr.
Baldwin and substantiated in all of
its main features by the witnesses
who followed, the threshing crew, of
which he was a member* were thresh
ing on the farm of Mammenga. About
11 o'clock in the morning Mammen
ga walked up to Sonnek, who was
standing on the platform of the en
gine of the threshing machine, and,
after asking him a question, began to
swear violently at him, and walking
around the tank wagon, which was
standing about three feet from the
engine, grasped Sonnek around tlie
waist and pulled him from the plat
form.

Number Forty-nine
was not distinctly heard by tile wit
ness.
After describing bow Sonnek was
"hurled to the ground" Kaldwin was
again requested to illustrate in con
nection with the prosecuting attor
ney the exact position of both men.
During the cross examination of
the witness, Mr. Freerks asked the
witness to illustrate how Mammen
ga stood on one knee and struck Son
nek with the other knee. The wit
ness did as he was requested but was
asked to go over to the edge of the
platform because the striking of the
floor was not a fair example. The
prosecuting attorneys objected to
the consideration of this illustration
on the grounds that the blow struck
by a 17-year-old boy was not equal
to the blow of a man of the size and
build of the defendant.
It was also brot out by the witness
that the men left the thresher to
gether before engaging in the second
scuffle and that Sonnek was not fol
lowing Mammenga. When asked if
Sonnek did any fighting, Baldwin re
plied, "I did not see him do any
fighting,'' but "he tried to ward him
off."
W. S. Baldwin Recalled.
The elder Baldwin was then re
called and asked concerning a state
ment made by him at the prelimi
nary examination before Police Mag
istrate Murphy. "Did you not," he
was asked, "say at that time that
Sonnek did the best that he could
to defend himself? And in answer
to the question, 'Was not one flatt
ing just as bad as the other?' reply
"I presume they was, I guess so'
Baldwin said that he did not remem
ber the questions but asserted that,
"After the fight started one did all
he could to the other."
"Sonnek Go (iet That Wagon."
The third witness, Hoy Torrey,
who is 27 years old and was employ
ed as engineer, asserted that Mam
menga "walked right up" and said,
"Sonnek go get that wagon." To
which Sonnek replied, "I understood
that you wouldn't need the wagon."
Upon receiving this answer Mam
menga, according to Torrey, "started
to cuss" and then pulled Sonnek
from the platform. In general Tor
rey substantiated the testimony of
the witnesses who preceded him, but
claimed that he did not see all of the
fight as he stayed on the engine. He
did, however, see Sonnek on the
ground and saw Mammenga as he
went away from liini. In reply to
the inquiry as to the appearance of
Sonnek, Torrey said, "lie appeared
to be badly hurt." He also asserted
that Sonnek complained of a severe
pain in his side as he came over to
the engine. Torrey did not see Son
nek fall but saw him on the ground.
Torrey asserted that both men
were fighting and that so far as he
knew the men had always been on
friendly terms before. Sonnek did
not strike Mammenga at any time,
according to Torrey. He did not
strike before Mammenga reached
him and after that he had no oppor
tunity. He answered "yes" to the
question, "Were both of the men
fighting and struggling like Mr.
Baldwin said?" He also said that
Sonnek had his hands on Mammen
ga's face and was trying to push him
away when Mammenga was choking
him on the engine platform.
The fourth witness, Henry Custis,
told practically the same story as
those who preceded him except that
Mr. Custis told of seeing Sonnek on
the couch at his home after the fight.
During the cross examination that
followed the story told by Custis, he
admitted that he saw that Mammen
ga's ear was split after the fight was
over. He also asserted that be had
employment in another state but
