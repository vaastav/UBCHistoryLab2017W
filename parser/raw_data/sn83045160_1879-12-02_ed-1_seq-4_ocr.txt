inet. We give to onr readers the fall text of the
President'! message delivered to congress yes
terday. It is not a strong document.and is not
apt to challenge much heated discussion. lie
assumes for himself and Shf rmas the credit
of resumption which as all well informed
people know is wholly due to the unexam
pled increase of trade in all departments and
in parts of the country. He urges congress
to pass the legislation necessary to pay United
States marshals to conduct the elections, and
nnblushingly suggests a special necessity for
such service next year. He as impudently
delivers a lecture on the necessity
for the enforcement of civil
service reform when it is well known to even
the least informed persons that he and his
secretaries took pains to mark their contempt
for the movement by frequent violations of
the letter and spirit. The Mormons and the
Indians have each a special chapter, his
recommendations as to both being that the
former be put down by the strong arm of the
law, and that the latter, instead of being re
manded to the care and keeping of the army,
are to continue the wards of the interior de
partment and subject to a policy that has
cost the country many valuable lives and
many millions of money. Our foreign rela
tions are touched upon, and other minor
topics briefly dealt with.
The Him(.
Fellow-Citizens ot the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives: The members of tha forty-sixth congress
have assembled in their first regular session
under circumstances calling for mutual con
gratulation and grateful acknowledgment to
the Giver of all good for the large and un
usual measure of national prosperity which
we now enjoy. The most interesting events
which have occuired in onr public affairs
since my last annual message to congress are
connected with the financial operations of the
government directly affecting the business in
terests of the country. I congratulate con
gress on the successful execution of the re
sumption act. At the time and in the manner
contemplated by law,' United States notes
began to be redeemed in coin. Since the first
of January last they have been promptly re
deemed on presentation, and in all business
transactions, public ana private, in all parts
of the country, they are received and paid
out as the equivalent of coin. The demand
upon the treasury for gold and silver in ex
change for United States notes has been com
paratively small, and the voluntary deposit of
coin and bullion in exchange for notes has
been very large. The excess of the precious
metals deposited or exchanged for United
States notes over the amount of United States
notes redeemed is about $40,000,000.
THS RESUMPTION Or BPECTCE PAYMENTS
has been followed by a very great revival of
business. With a currency equivalent in
value to the money of the commercial world,
we are enabled to enter upon an equal com
petition with other nations in trade and pro
duction. The increasing foreign demand for
our manufactures and agricultural products
has caused a large balance oi trade in oar
favor, which has been paid in gold, from the
first of July last to November 15th, to the
amount of 59,000,000. Since the resump
tion of specie payments there has also been
a marked and gratifying improvement of the
publio credit. The bonds of the government
bearing only four per cent, interest have
been sold at or about par, sufficient in amount
to pay off all of the national debt which was
redeemable under present laws. The amount
of interest saved annually by the proos of
refunding the debt, since March 1, 1877, is
$14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely
in smaall sums, and the number of our citi
ens now holding the publio securities is
much greater than ever before1. The amount
of the national debt which matures within
less than two years is $792,121,700, of which
$500 000,000 bear interest at the rate of five
per cent., and the balauce is in bonds bear
ing six per cent, interest. It is believed that
this part ot the publio debt can be retunded
by the issue of four per cent bonds, and, by
the reduction of interest which will thus be
effected, about eleven million of dollars can
be annually saved to the treasury. To secure
this important reduction of interest to be
paid by the United States, further legislation
is required, which, it is hoped, will be pro
vided by congress during its pression session.
THE COINAGE OK GOLD
by the mints of the United States, during the
fiscal year was $40,980,912. The coinage of
silver dollars, ainco the passage ot the act for
that purpose, up to November 1, 1879, was
$45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been
issued from the treasury and era now ia cir
culation, and $32,300,506 are still in the pos
session of the government.
The pendency of the proposition for unity
of action between the United Statea and the
principal commercial nations of Europe, to
ell ec t a permanent system for
THE EQUALITY OF GOLD AND HII.VKK
in the recognised money of the world, leads
me to recommend that congress refrain from
new legislation on the general subjoct. The
great revival of trade, internal and foreign,
will supply, during the coming year, its own
instructions, which may be well awaited be
fore attempting further experimental meas
ures with the coinage 1 would, however,
strongly urge upon congress the importance
of authorising the secretary of the treasury to
suspond the coinnge ot silver dollars upon the
present ratio. The market value ot the sil
ver dollar being uniformly and largely less
than the market value of the gold dollar, it
ia obviously impracticable to maintain them
at par with each other if both are coined
without limit. If the cheaper ooin is forced
into circulation it will, it' coined without
limit, soon become the solo standard of value,
and thus defeat the desired object, which is a
currency of both gold and silver, which shall
be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with
the universally recognised money of the
world.
THE RETIREMENT FROM CIRCULATION
of United States notes, with the capa
city of legal tender in private
contracts, 'is a stop to be taken
. in our pi ogress toward a safe and stable
currency, which should bo accepted as the
policy and duty of the government, and the
interest and security of the people. It is my
firm conviction that the issue of legal tender
paper money based wholly upon the author
ity and credit of the government, except in
extreme emergency, is without warrant in
the constitution, and a violation of sound
financial principles. The issue of United
States notes during the late civil war, with
the capacity of legal tender between private
individuals, was not authorized except as a
means oi rescuing me country irom immi
nent peril. The circulation of these notes as
paper money, for any protracted period of
time alter the accomplishment of this pur
pose, was not contemplated by the frauierg of
the law under which they were issued. They
anticipated the redemption and withdrawal
of these notes at the earliest practicable
period consistent with the attainment of the
object for which they were provided.
The policy of the United States, steadily
adhered to from the adoption of the consti
tution, has been to avoid the creation of a
NATIONAL DEBT,
and when, from neoessity in time of war,
debts have been created, they have been paid
off on the return of peace as rapidly as possi
ble. With this view and torthispurpose.it
is recommended that the existing laws for the
accumulation of a sinking-fund sufficient to
extinguish the pubUo dobt within a limited j
period be maintained. It any cnanga i iu

The continued violation by a larg e number

THE TERRITORY OK UTAH
of the laws of the United States for tho pros
ecution und punishment of polygamy de
mands the attention of every department ot
tha crnvornTnanh This Territory has a popu
lation sufficient to entitle it to admission as a
State, and thefgeneral interests oi ine nation,
as well as the welfare of the citizens of the
Territory, require its advance from the terri
torial form ot government to the responsibili
ties and privileges of a State. This impor
tant change will not, however, be approved
by the country while the citizens ot Utah in
very considerable number uphold a practice
which is condemned as a crime by the laws of
all civilized communities throughoat the
world. The law tor tne suppression vi mi
offense was enacted with great unanimity by
congress more than seventeen years ago, but
has remained until recently a dead letter in
the Territory of Utah, because of the peculiar
difficulties attending its enforcement. The
opinion widely prevailed among the citizens
of Utah that the law was in contravention of
u. oinoHtntinnal ennrantee of religious free-
dom. This objection is now removed, the
supreme court ot the United States
has decided the law to be within the
legislative power of congress, and bir-ding as
a rule of action for all who reside within the
territories. There is no longer any reason
for delay or hesitation in its enforcement. It
should be firmly and effectively executed. If
not sufficiently stringent in its provisions it
should be amended, and, in aid of the pur
pose in view, l recommena man muig wm

subject.
THE ELECTIONS OP THE PAST YEAR,
though occupied only with State c ulcers,
have not failed to elicit in the political dis
cussions which attended them all over the
country, new and decisive evidence of the
deep interest which the great body of citizens
take in the progress of the country toward a
more general and complete establishment, at
whatever cost, of universal security and free
dom in the exercise of the elective franchise.
While many topics of political concern de
mand great attention irom our people, both
in the sphere of national and State authority,
1 find no reason to quamy me opinion i ex
nrraaAd in mv last annual message, that no
temporary or administrative interests of
government, however urgent or weighty, will
ever displace the zeal of our people in defense
of the primary rights of citizenship, and that
the power of public opinion will override all
political prejudices, and all sectional and
State attachments, in demanding that all
over our wide territory the name and charac
ter of citizen of the United States shall mean
one and the same thing, and carry with them
unchallenged security and respect. I carn
pb1v anneal to the intelligence and patriotism
of all good citizens of every part of the
country, however much they may be divided
in opinions on other political subjects, to unite
in compelling obedience to existing laws
aimed at the protection of the right of suf
frage. I respectfully urge upon congress to
supply any defects in these laws which expe
rience has shown and which it is within its
power to remedy. I again invoke the co-operation
of tho executive and legislative au
thorities of the State in this great purpose.
I am fully convinced that it the public mind
can be set at rest on this paramount question
of popular rights, no serious obstacle will
thwart or delay the complete pacification of
the country, or retard the general diffusion oi
prosperity.
In a former message I invited the attention
of congress to the subjeGt of the reformation
of the
CIYIL SERVICE
of the government, and expressed the inten
tion ot transmitting to congress as early as
practicable a report upon this subject by the
chairman of the civil service commission.
In view of the facts that, during a considera
ble period, the government of Great Britain
has been dealing: with administrative prob
lems and abuses, in various particulars analo
gous to those presented in this country, and
that in recent years the measures adopted
were understood to have been effective and in
every respect highly satisfactory, thought it
desirable to have fuller information upon the
subject, and accordingly, requested the chair
man of the civil service commission to make
thorough investigation tor this purpose.
The result has been an elaborate and com
prehensive result. The report sets torth the
history of the partisan-spoils system in Oreat
Britain, and ot the rise and fall of the parlia
mentary patronage, and of official interfer
ence with the freedom of elections. It shows
that after long trials of various
kinds of examinations, those which
are competitive and open on equal terms
to all, and which are carried on under
the superintendence of a single commission,
have, with great advantage, been established
as conditions of admission to almost every of
ficial place in the subordinate administration
of that country and of British India. The
completion of the report, owing to the extent
of the labor involved in its preparation, and
the omission of congress is make any provision
either for the compensation or the expenses
of the commission, has been postponed until
the present time. It is herewith transmitted
to congress. While the reform measures of
another government are of no authority for
us, they are entitled to influence, to (the ex
tent to which their intrinsic wisdom, and
their adaptation to our institutions and social
lite may commend them to our consideration.
The views I have heretofore expressed con
cerning the detects and abuses in our civil ad
ministration remain unchanged, except in so
far as an enlarged experience has deepened my
sense of the duty both of officers and of the peo
ple themselves to co-operate ior their removal.
The grave evils and perils of a partisan
spoils system of appointment to office and of
office tenure, are now generally recognized.
In the resolutions of the great parties, in the
reports of departments, in the debates and
proceedings Of congress, in the messages of
executives, toe gravity of there evils has been
pointed out end the need of their reform has
been committed. To command the necessa
ry support, every measure of reform must be
based on common right and justice, and must
be compatible with tho healthy existence of
great parties, which are inevitable and essen
tial ih a free State. When the people have
approved a policy at a natioual election, con
fidence on the part of the officers they
have selected, and of the advisers
who, in accordance with our polit
ical institutions, should be consulted.
in the policy which it is their duty to carry
into effect, is indispensable. It is eminently
proper that they should explain it before the
people, as well as illustrate its spirit in the
performance of their official duties. Very
different considerations apply to the greater
number of those who 11 tbe subordinate
places in the civil service. Their responsi
bility is to their superiors in official position
It is their duty to obey the legal instructions
of those upon whom that authority devolved.
and their best public service consists in the
discharge of their functions, irrespective of
partisan politics. Their duties are the same.
whatever party is in power and whatever
policy prevails. As a consequence, it follows
that their tenure of cilice should not depend
on the prevalence oi any policy or the su
premacy of any party, but should be deter
mined by their capacity to serve the people
most usefully, quite irrespective of partisan in
terests. The same considerations that
should govern the tenure, should also prevail
in the appointment, discipline and removal
of these subordinates. The authority of ap
pointment and removal is not a perquisite,
which may bo used to aid a friend or reward
a partisan, but is a trust to be exercised in
the publio interest, under all the sanctions
which attend the obligation to apply the
public funds only ior public purposes. Every
cititn has an equal right to the honor and
profit of entering the publio service of his
country. The only just ground of discrimi
nation is the measure of character and capa
city he has to make that service most useful
to the people. Except in cases where, upon
just and tecognized principles, as upon the
theory of pensions, offices and promotions
are bestowed aa rewards for past services,
their bestowal upon any theory which disre
gards personal merit, is an act of injustice to
the citizen, as well as a breach of that trust
subject to which the appointing power is
held. In the light of these principles,
it becomes of great importance to
provide just and adequate means,
especially tor every department, and large
administrative office, where personal discrim
ination on the part of its head is not practi
cable, for asertaining those qualifications to
which appointments and removals should
have reference. To fail to provide such meats
is not only to deny the opportunity of ascer
taining the facta upon which the most right
eous claim to offioe depends, but, of neces
sity, to discourage all worthy aspirants, by
handing over appointments and removals, to
mere favoritism. If it is the right of the
worthiest claimant to gain the appointment,
and the interest of the people to bestow it
upon him, it would seem clear that a
wise and just method of ascertaining
personal fitness for office must be an
important and permanent function of every
just and wise government. It has long since
become impossible, in the great offices, for
those having the duty of nomination and ap
pointment, to personally examine into the
individual qualifications of more than a small
proportion of those seeking office; and, with
the enlargement of the civil service, that
proportion must continue to become less. In
tha earlier vflura of the government the sub
ordinate offices were so tew in number that
it was quite easy for those making appoint
ments and promotions to personally ascertain
the merits of candidates. Party managers
and methods had not then become powerful
agencies of coercion, hostile to the free and
just exercise of the appointing power. A
large and responsible part of the duty of re
storing the civil service to the desired purity
and efficiency rests uoon the President, and
it is my purpose to do what is within my
power to advance such prudent and
gradual measures of reform as will
most surely and rapidly bring
about that radical change of system essential
to make our administrative methods satisiac
tnrv to a free and intelligent people. By a
proper exercise of authority, it is in the power

congress and considerate and intelligent sup
port among the people, jtteiorms wnicn cum

ties, and demand changes in the methods of
dotmrtments. are not the work of a day.
Their permanent foundations must be laid in
sound principles, and in an experience which
Hprnonstratts their wis iom and exposes the
errors of their adversaries. Every worthy
officer desires to make his official acion a gain
and an honor to his country, but the people
themselves, far more than their officers in
publio station, are interested in a pure, eco
nl and vigorous administration. By laws
enacted in 1853 and 1855, and now in sub-
atnnon inpnrnorated in the revised statutes,
tha nrartip.a of arbitrarv appointments to
the several subordinate grades in the great
rienarrmenta was condemned, and examma-
tions, as to capacity, to be conducted by de
nnrtmental boards of examiners, were pro
vided for and made conditions of admission
to the publio service. These statutes are a
decision bv congress that examinations of
some sort, as to attainments and capacity,
are essential to the well-being of the public
service. The important questions since the
enactment of these laws have been as to the
character of these examinations. In prae-
bee, these examinations have not always
been open to worthy persons gener
ally, who might wish to be exam
ined. Official favoritism and partisan
influence, as a rule, appear to have
designated those who alone were permitted
to go before the examining boards, subject'
in? even the examiners to a pressure from
tha friends of the candidates verv difficult to
resist. As a consequence, the standard of
admission fell below that which the public
interest demanded. It was also almost in
evitable that a system which provided for
various senarata boards of examiners, with
no common supervision or uniform method of
procedure, should result in confusion, incon
sistency, and inadequate tests of capacity
highly detrimental to the public interests. A
further and more radical chance was obvi
ously required. In the annual message of
December, 1870, my predecessor declared
that "there is no duty which so much embar
rasses the Executive and heads ot depart
ments as that of (appointments; nor is there
anv such arduous and thankless labor
imposed on senators and representa
tives as that of finding places for con
stituents. The present system does
not secure the best men. and often not even
fit men for the public places. The elevation
and purification of the civil-service of the
government will be hailed with approval by
the whole people of the United States." Con
gress" accordingly passed the act, approved
March 3, 1871. "to regulate the civil-service
of the United States and promote the effi
ciency thereof, giving the necessary authors
ty to the Executive to inaugurate a civil-eer
vice reform. Acting under this statute,
which was interpreted as intended to secure
a system of jast and effectual examinations
under uniform supervision, a number of emi
nently competent persons were selected for
the purpose, who entered with zeal upon the
discharge of their duties, prepared, with an
intelligent appreciation of the requirements
of the service, the regulations contemplated,
and took charge of the examinations,and who,
in their capacity as a board, have been known
as the "Civil tarvice commission." Congress
for two rears appropriated the money needed
for the compensation and for the expense of
carrying on the work of the commission. It
appears from the report of the commission,
submitted to the President in April, 1874,
that examinations had been held in various
sections of the country, and that an appro
priation of about 1 25,000 would be required
to meet the annual expenses, including sala
ries, involved in discharging the duties of the
commission. The report was transmitted to
congress by special message of April 18, 1874,
with the following favorable comment upon
the tabors of the commission It sustained
bv congress. I have no doubt the rules can,
after the experience gained, be bo improved
and enforced as to still more materially bene
fit the public service and relieve the execu
tive, members of congress, and the heads of
departments, from influences prejudicial to
good administration. The rules, as they
have hitherto been enforced, have resulted
beneficially, as is shown by the opinions of
the members of the cabinet and their sub
ordinates in the departments, and in that
opinion I concur." And in the annual mes
sage of December of the same year similar
views are expressed, and an appropriation
for continuing the work of the commission
again advised. The appropriation was not
made, and, as a consequence, the active work
of the commission was suspended, leaving
the commission itself still in existence. With
out the means, therefore, of causing
qualifications to . be tested in any
systematic manner, or of securing for
the publio service the advantages ot competi
tion upon any extensive plan. I recommended
in my annual message ot December, ls77,
the making ot an appropriation for the re
sumption ot tbe commission. In the mean
time, however,' competitive examinations,
under many embarrassments, have been con
ducted within limited spheres in the execu
tive departments in Washington and in a
number of the customhouses and postoffices
of the principal cities ot the country, 'with a
view to further test their effects, and in every
instance they have been found to be as salu
tary as they are stated to have been under
the administration of my predecessor. I think
tbe economy, purity and efficiency ot the pub
lie service would be greatly promoted by their
systematic introduction, wherever practicable.
through ojt the entire civil service of the gov
ernment, together with ample provision for
their general supervision, in order to secure
consistency and uniform justice. Reports from
the secretary ot the interior, the postmaster
general, from the postmaster in the city ot
New York, where such examinations have
been sometime on trial, and also from the
collector of the port, the naval officer, and
the surveyor in that city, and from tbe post
masters and collectors in several of the other
large cities, show that the competitive sys
tem, where applied, has, in various ways,
contributed to improve the public service,
The reports show that the results have been
salutary in a marked degree, and the general
application of similar rules cannot fail to be
of decided benefit to the service. The re
ports of the governments officers, in the city
of New York especially, bear decided testi
mony to the utility of open competi
tive examinations in their respective
c Hi ccs, showing that 'these exam
inations, and the excellent qualifies
tions to those admitted to the service
through them, have had a marked incidental
effect upon the persons previously in the
service, and particularly upon those aspiring
to promotion, mere has been, on the part
of these latte:', an increased interest in the
work, and a desire to extend acquaintance
with it beyond the particular desk occupied.
and thus the morale of the entire force has
been raised. The examinations have
been attended by many citizens who have had
opportunity to thoroughly investigate the
scope and character ot the tests and the
method of determining the results, and those
visitors have, without exception, approved
the methods employed, and several of them
have publicly attested their favorable opin
ion." Upon such considerations, I deem it
my duty to renew the recommendation con
tained in my annual message of December,
1877, requesting congress to make the
necessary appropriation for the resump
tion of the work of the civil service commis
sion. Economy will be promoted by author
izing a nioderate compensation to persons in
the public service who may perform extra
labor upon or under the commission, as the
Executive may direct. I am convinced that
if a jast and adequate test of merit is enforced
for admission to the public service, and in
making promotions, such abuses as removals
without good cause, and partisan and official
interference with the proper exercise of the
appointing power, will in large measure dis
appear, lhere are
OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE ABUSES
to which the attention of congress should be
asked in this connection. Mere partisan ap
pointments, and the constant peril of removal
without cause, very naturally lead to an ab
sorbing and mischievous political activity, on
the part of those thus appointed, which not
only interferes with the due discharge of offi
cial duty, but is incompatible with the free
dom of elections. Not without warrant, in
the views of several of my predecessors in the
Presidential office, and directly within the
law of 1871, already cited, I endeavored, by
regulation, made on the twenty-second day
June, 1877, to put some reasonable limits to
such abuses. It may not be easy, and it may
never perhaps be necessary, to define with
precision the proper limit ot political action
on the part of Federal officers. But while
their right to hold and treeiy express their
opinions cannot be questioned, it is very plain
that they should neither be allowed to devote
to other subjects the time needed for
the proper discharge of their official
duties, nor to use the authority of their office
to enforce their own opinions, or to coaice
the political action of those who hold differ
ent opinions. Reasons of justice and publio
policy, quite analogous to those which forbid
the use of official power for the oppression of
the private citizen, impose upon tbe govern
ment the duty of protecting its officers and
agents from arbitrary exactions. In what
everjaspect considered,. the practice of mak
ing levies, tor party purposes, upon tne
salaries of officers is highly demoraliz-
nsr to the public service and discred
itable to the country. Though an officer
should be as tree as an any other citizen
to give his own money in aid oi his opinions
or his oartv. he should also be as free as any
other citizen to refuse to make such tifts. If
salaries are but a fair compensation for the
time and labor of the officer, it is gross icjus
tice to levy a tax upon them. If they are
made excessive in order that they may bear
tbe tax, the excess is an indirect robbery of
the public funds. 1 recommend, therefore,
such a revision and extension of present stat
utes as shall secure to those in every grade ot
official lite or public employment the protec
tion with which a great and enlightened na
tion shoald guard those who are faithful in
its service.
OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES
have continued peaceful. With Great Britain
there are still unsettled questions, growing
out of the local laws of the maritime prov
inces and the action of provincial authorities,
deemed to be in derogation of rights secured
by treaty to American fishermen. The Uni
ted States minister in London bas been in
structed to present a demand for $105,305 02,
in view of the damages received by Ameri
can citizens at r ortune bay on the sixth day
of January, 1878. The subject has been tak
en into consideration by tbe British govern
ment, and an early reply is anticipated.
Upon the completion of the necessary pre
liminary examination, the subject of our
participation in the provincial bsheries, as
regulated by treaty, will at once be brought
to tbe attention ot the British government
with a view to an early and permanent set
tlement ot the whole question, which was only
temporarily adjusted by the treaty ot Wash
ington. Efforts have been mode to obtain
the removal of restrictions found injurious to
the exportation of cattle to the United King
dom. Some correspondence has also occur
red with regard to the rescue and saving of
life and property upon the laces, which bas
resulted in important modifications of the
nrevious regulations of the Dominion govern
ment on the subiect. in the interest of
humanity and commerce. In accordance
with the joint resolution of the lost session of
congress, commissioners were appointed to
represent tne United btates at tbe two
international exhibitions in Australia, one of
which is now in progress at Sydney, and the
other to be held next year at Mel
bourne. A desire has been ex
pressed by our merchants and manufacture! s
interested in the important and growing
trade with Australia, thit an increased pro
vision should be made by congress for tbe
representation cf our industries at the Mel
bourne exhibition of next year, and the sub
ject is respectfully submitted to your favor
able consideration.
A NEW ATLANTIC CABLE.
The assent of the government has been
given to the landing, on the coast of Massa
chusetts, of a new and independent trans
atlantic cable between France, by way of the
Jrrench island of St. Pierre, and this country,
subject to any futnre legislation of congress
on the subject, The conditions imposed, be
fore allowing this connection with our shores
to be established, are such as to secure its
competition with any existing or future lines
of marine cable, and preclude amalgamation
therewith, to provide for entire equality of
rights to oar government and people with
those of France in the use of the cable, and
prevent anv exclusive possession of the privi
lege as accorded by F ranee to the disadvan
tage of any future cable communication be
tween France and the United States which
may be projected and accomplished by our
citizens. An important reduction
of the present rates of cable com muni
cation with Europe, felt to be too burden
some to the interests of our commerce, must
necessarily flow from the establishment of
this competing line. Tbe attention of con
gress was drawn to the propriety of some
general regulation by congress of the whole
subiect of transmarine cables by my prede
cessor in his message of December 7, 1875,
and I respectfully submit to jour considera
tion the importance of congressional action
in this matter.
SPAIN.
The questions of grave importance with
Spain, growing out of the incidents of the
Cuban insurrection have been, for the mos
part, happily and honorably settled. It may
reasonably be anticipated that the commis
sion now sitting in Washington, for the de
cision of private cases in this connection,
will soon be able tf bring its labors to a con
elusion. The long-standing question of east
Florida claims has lately been renewed cs a
subject of correspondence, and may possibly
require congressional action lor its linal dis
posal.
NETHERLANDS.
A treaty with the Netherlands, with re
spect to consular rights and privileges, simi
lar to those with other powers, has been
signed and ratified, and the ratifications were
exchanged on the thirty-hrst of July last. Ne
gotiations for extradition treaties with the
Netherlands and with Denmark are now in
progress.
SWITZERLAND.
Some questions with Switzsrland, in regard
to pauper and convict emigrants, have arisen
but it is not doubted that they will be ar
ranged npon a just and satisfactory basis.
question has also occurred with respect to an
asserted claim by Swiss municipal authorities
to exercise tutelage over persons and proper
ty ot fewiBS citizens naturalized inthiscoun
try. It is possible this may require adjust
ment by treaty.
GERMANY.
with the uerman empire questions arise
in connection with the subjects of naturaliza
tion and expatriation; but tbe imperial gov
eminent has constantly manifested a desire
to strictly maintain and comply with all
treaty stipulations in regard to them.
GREECE.
In consequence of the omission of congress
to provide tor a diplomatic representative at
Athens, the legation to Greece has been with
drawn. There is now no chance of diplo
matic communication between the two coun
tries, and the expediency of providing for
one, in some torm, is submitted to congress.
AUSTRIA, ETC.
Relations with Austria, Russia, Italy,
Portugal, lurkey and Belgium continue
amicable, and marked by no incident of es
pecial importance.
EGYPT.
A change of the personal head of the gov
ernment of Egypt has taken place. No
change, however, has occurred in the rela
tions between .hgypt and the United States
m. . - - i A. I v.l
ine action oi tne Cigyptian government in
presenting to the city of New York one of
the ancient obelisks, which possesses such
historic interest, is nigniy appreciated as a
generous mark of international regard. If
prosperity should attend the enterprise of its
transportation across tne Atlantic, its erec
tion in a conspicuous position in the chief
commercial city of the nation will soon be
accomplished.
JAPAN.
The treaty recently made between Japan
and the United States in regard to the revis
ion of former commercial treaties, it is now
believed will be followed by similar action on
the part of other treaty powers. The atten
tion of congress is again invited to the sub
ject of the indemnity funds received some
years since from Japan and China, which,
with their accumulated interest, now amount
to considerable turns. If any part of these
funds is justly due to American citizens they
should receive it promptly; and whatever
may have been received by this government
in excess of strictly just demands should in
some form be returned to the nations to whom
it equitably belongs.
CHINA.
The government of China has signified its
willingness to consider the question ot the
emigration of its subiects to the United Stptes
with a dispassionate fairness, and to co-operate
in such measures as may tend to prevent
injurious consequences to the United States.
The negotiations are still proceeding, and
will be pressed with diligence.
LEW CHEW ISLANDS.
A question having arisen between China
and Japan about the Lew Chew islauds, the
United States government has taken meas
ures to inform those powers of its readiness
to extend its good offices for the maintenance
of peace, if they shall mutually deem it desir
able, and find it practicable to avail them
selves of the proffer.
MEXICO.
It s a gratification to be able to announce
that, through the judicious and energetic ac
tion of the military commanders of the two
nations on each side of the Rio Grande, un
der the instructions of their respective gov
ernments, raids and depredations have great
ly decreased, and, in tbe localities where
formerly most destructive, have now almost
wholly ceased. In view of this result, I en
tertain a confident expectation that the prev
alence of quiet on the border will soon become
o assured as to justify a modification of the
present orders to our military commanders as
to crossing the border, without encouraging
such disturbances as would endanger the
peace of the two countries. The third in
stalment of the award against Mexico under
the claims commission of July 4, 1868, was
duly paid, and has been put in CJursa of dis
tribution in pursuance of tbe act of congress
providing for the same. Ihis satisfactory
situation between the two countries leads me
to anticipate an expansion of our trade with
Mexico and an increased contribution of capi
tal and industry by our people to the devel
opment of the great resources of that coun
try. I earnestly commend to the wisdom of
congress the provision of suitable legislation
looking to this result.
COLOMBIA.
Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is
again fully restored by the arrival of a min
ister from that country to the United States.
This is especially fortunate in view of the fact
that the question of an interoceanic canal bas
recently assumed a new and important as
pect, and is now under discussion with the
Central American countries through whose
territory the canal, by the .Nicaragua route,
would have to pass. It is trusted that en
lightened statesmanship on their part will see
that the early prosecution of sucn a work will
largely enure to the benefit,cot only of their
own citizens and those of the United States,
but of the commerce of the civilized world.
It is not doubted that should the work be un
dertaken under the protective auspices of the
United States, and upon satisfactory conces
sions for the nht of way, and i's security, by
the Central American governments, the cap
ital for its completion would be readily fur
nished from this country ana Europe, wnicn
might, failing such guarantee, prove inacces
sible. Diplomatic relations with Chili have
aho been strengthened by the reception of a
minister from that country.
CHILI, PERU AND BOLIVIA.
The war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chili
still continues. The United States have not
deemed it proper to interpose in the matter,
further than to convey to all the governments
concerned, the assurance that the friendly
offices of the government ot the U mted
States for the restoration of peace upon an
honorable basis will be extended, in case the
belligents shall exhibit a readiness to accept
them.
BRAZIL AND THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC.
Cordial relations continue with Brazd and
the Argentine republic, and trade with those
countries is improving. A provision for
regular and more freauent mail communica
tion, in our own shiDs. between the ports of
this country and the nations of South
America seems to me to deserve the attention
of congress, as an essential precursor of an
enlargement of our commerce with them,
and an extension of our carrying trade.
VENEZUELA.
A recent revolution in Venezuela has been
followed by the establishment of a provisional
government. This government has not yet
been formally recognized, and it is deemed
desirable to await the proposed action of the
people, which is expected to give it the sanc
tion ot constitutional torms.

eastern frinctpalittes.
The subject of opening diplomatic relations
with Hoomania and Servia. now become in
dependent sovereignties, is at present under
consideration, and is the subject of diplomatic
correspondence.
OUR FOREIGN TRADE.
There is a gratifying increase of trade with
nearly all European and American countries,
and it is believed that, with judicious action
in regard to its development, it can and will
be still more enhanced, and that American
products and manufactures will find new and
expanding markets, lhe reports of diplo
matic and consular officers upon this subject,
under the system now adopted, have resulted
in obtaining much valuable information.
which has been and will continue to be laid
before congress and the public from time to
time.
ALASKA.
The third article of the treaty with Russia,
of March 30, 1S67, by which Alaska was
ceded to the United States, provides that the
inhabitants of the ceded territory, with the
exception of the uncivilized native tribes,
shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all the
rights of citizens of the United States, and
shall be maintained and protected in tbe free
enjoyment of their liberty, property and re
ligion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to
such laws and regulations as the United
States may from time to time adopt in re
gard to the aboriginal tribes of that
country. Both the obligations of this
treaty and the necessities of tha people
require that 8)me organ' zed form of govern
ment over the Territory of Alaska be adopted.
There appears to be no law for the arrest of
persons charged with common law offenses,
such as assault, robbery and murder, and no
magistrate authorized to issue or execute pro
cess in such cases. Serious difficulties have
already arisen from offenses ot this charac
ter, not only among the original inhabitants,
but among citizens of the United States and
other countries, who have engaged in min
ing, fishing and other business operations
within the Territory. A bill authorizing the
appointment of justices of the peace and
constables, and the arrest and detention of
persons charged with criminal offenses, and
providing for an appeal to United States
courts for tbe district of Oregon, in suitable
cases, will, at a proper time, be submitted to
congress.
FINANCES.
The attention of congress ia called to the
annual report of the secretary of the treasury
on the condition of the public finances. The
ordinary revenues from all sources for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, were $273,
827,184 46; the ordinary expenditures for
the ssme period were $2G6,947,883 53; leav
ing a surplus revenue for the year of $6,879,
300 93, The receipts for the present fiscal
year, ending June 30, 1880, actual and esti
mated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the
first quarter commencing July 1, 1879, $79,
843,663 61 ; estimated reseipts for the re
maining three-quarters of the year, $20S,
156,336 39; total receipts for the current fiscal
year, actual and estimated, $288,000,000.
Tbe expenditures for the same period will be,
actual and estimated, as follows: For the
quarter commencing July 1, 1879, actual ex
penditures, $91,683,385 10; and for the re
maining three-quarters of the year the ex
penditures are estimated at $172,316,614 90
making the total expenditures $264,000,
000, and leaving an estimated sur
plus revenue for the year ending
June 30, 1880, of $24,000,000. The total
receipts during the next fiscal year, ending
June 30, 1881, estimated according to exist
ing laws, will be $288,000,000. and the esti
mated ordinary expenditures for the
same period will be $278,097,364 39
leaving a surplus of $9,902,635 61 for that
year. The large amount expended for ar
rears of pensions darintr the last fiscal year,
amounting to $21,747,249 60, has prevented
the application of the full amount required
by law to the sinking fund for tbe current
year; but these arrears having been substan
tially paid, it is believed that the sinking
fund can hereafter be maintained without
any change whatever.
THE ARMY.
The secretary of war reports that the war
department estimates for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1881, are $40,380,423 93, the
same being for a less sum of money than any
anneal estimate rendered to congress from
that department during a period of at least
twelve years. He concurs with the general
of the army in recommending such legisla
tion as will authorize the enlistment of tha
full number of twenty-five thousand men for
the line of the army, exclusive of the three
thousand four hundred and sixty-three men
required for detached duty, and therefore not
available for service in the field. lie also
recommends that congress be asked U pro-
vide by law for the disposition ot a large
number of abandoned military posts
and reservations, which, though very
valuable in themselves, - have been
rendered -iihpIpss for military pur
poses by the advance of civilization ana
settlement He unites with the quartermas
ter-general in recommending that an appro
priation be mada for the construction ot a
cheap and perfectly fire-proof building for
the safe storage of a vast amount ot money
account?, vouchers, claims, and other valu
able records now in the quarter-master gen
eral's office, and exposed to great ritk of total
destruction by fir 3. He also recommends, in
conformity with the views of the judge-advocate-general,
some declaratory legislation in
reference to tbe military statute ot limita
tions as applied to the crime of desertion. In
these several recommendations 1 concur.
EADS JETTIES.
The secretary of war further reports, that
the work for the improvement of the S uth
pass of the Mississippi river, under contract
with Mr. James B. Eds, mada in pursuance
of an act of congress, has been prosecuted
during the past year, with a greater measure
of success in the attainment of results than
during any previous year. The channel
through the South pass, which, at the begin
ning of operations in June. 16 to, bad a depth
of only seven and one-half feet of witer, had,
on the eighth of July, IS it), amtmmum depth
of twenty-six feet, having a width of not less
than two hundred feet and a central depth ot
thirty feet. . f ayments bave been made in
accordance with the at at ate, as the work pro
gressed, amounting in the aggregate to $4,
250,000; and further payments will become
due, as provided by the statute, in tbe event
ot success in maintaining the channel now
secured.
MILITARY OPERATIONS,
The reports of the general of the army and
of his subordinated, present a lull .and de
tailed account of the military operations for
the suppression of hostilities among the In
dians of the Uto and Apache tribes, and
praise is justly awarded to tbe officers and
troops engaged, for promptness, skill and
courage displayed. The past year has been
one of almost unbroken peace and quiet on
the Mexican frontier, and there is reason to
believe that the efforts ot tms government
and of Mexico, to maintain order in that re
gion, will prove permanently successful.
WAR DEPARTMENT I1CTLDINU.
This department was enabled during the
past year to unu temporary though crowded
accommodations, and a sale depository lor a
portion of its records, in tbe completed east
wing ot the building designed for tbe state.
war and navy departments. 1 be construe
tion of the north wing of the building, a part
of the structure intended for the use of the
war department, is being carried forward
with all possible dispatch, and the work
should receive from congress such liberal ap
propriations as will secure its speedy comple
tion.
THE NATY.
lhe report of tbe secretary of the navy
shows continued improvement in that branch
of the service during the last fiscal year,
Extensive repairs have been made ur.oa ves
sels, and two new ships have been completed
and made ready tor sea. lhe total expendi
turea of the year ended June oO, 18 y, mclud
ing specific appropriations tot estimated for
by thajdepartment, were $ lo.aoo, f 10 09. l he
expenses chargeable to the year, alter
deducting the amount ot these specific
appropriations, were- $13,343,317 79: but

$283,725 99. that amount having been
drawn upon warrants, but not paid out dur
ing tbe year, lhe amount of appropriations
applicable to the last fiscal year was S14.53s.
646 17. There was, therefore, a balance of
$1,479,054 37 remaining unexpended, and to
the credit of tbe department, on June 30,
1879. The estimates for the fiscal year end
ing June 30. 1881, are $14,864,147 9-5, which
exceeds the appropriations lor the present fis
cal year $361,897 28. The reason for this
increase is explained in the secretary s report
The appropriations available for tbe present
fiscal year are $14,502,250 67, whish will, in
the opinion of the secretary, answer all the
ordinary demands of the service. - The
amount drawn from the treasury from July 1
to November 1, 1879, was $5,770,404 12, of
which f i,uyo,44U 33 has been refunded,
leaving as the expenditure for that period
$4,674,963 79. If the expenditures of
the remaining two-thirds of the year do
not exceed the proportion for these
fanr mrmthii. tVip-rA will remain linpxnpnprl fth
the end of the year, $447,359 30 of the cur
rent appropriations. The report of the sec
retary shows the gratifying tact that among
all the disbursing officers of the pay corps of
the navy there is not one who is a defaulter
to the extent of a single dollar. I unite with
him in recommending the removal of the ob
servatory to a more healthful location. That
institution reflects credit upon the nation, and
has obtained the approbation ot scientific
men in all parts of the world. Its removal
from its present location would not only be
conducive to the health of its officers and pro-
lessors, but would greatly increase its useful
ness.
THB DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
The appropriation for judicial expense?,
which has heretofore been mado for the de
partment of justice, in gross, was subdivided
at the last session of congress, and no appro
priation whatever was made for the payment
of the fees of marshals and their deputies,
either in the service of process or for the dis
charge of other duties; and. since June 30th,
these officers have continued the performance
of their duties, without compensation irom
the government, taking upon themselves the
necessary incidental outlays, as well as ren
dering their own services. In only a few un
avoidable instances has the proper execution
of the process of the United States failed by
reason of the absence of the requisite appro
priation. This course of official conduct on
the part ot these officers, highly creditable to
their fidelity, was advised by the attorney
general, who informed them, however, that
they would necessarily have to rely for their
compensation upon the prospect of future
legislation by congress. I therefore especially
recommend that immediate appropriation be
made by congress for this purpose.
FEDERAL CONTROL OF ELECTIONS.
The act making the principal appropriation
for the department of justice at previous ses
sions has uniformly contained the following
clause: "And for di fraying the expenses
which may be incurred in the enforcement of
the act approved February 28, 1370, entitled
'An act to amend an act approved May 30,
1870, entitled 'An act to" enforce the right of
citizens ot the United States to voto in the
several States of the United Slates, and for
other purposes,' or any acta amendatory
thereof or supplementary thereto.' " No
appropriation was made for this purpose for
the current year. - As no general election for
members of congress occurred, the omission
was a matter of little practical importance.
Such election will, however, take place dur
ing the ensuing year, and the appropriation
made for the pay of marshals and deputies
shoald be sufficient to embrace compensation
for the services they may be reqaired to per
form at such elections.
THE SUPREME COURT.
The business of the supreme court is, at
present, largely in arrears. It cannot be ex
pected that more causes can be decided than
are now disposed of in its annual session, or
that by any assiduity the distinguished
magistrates v. ho compose the court can ac
complish more than is now done. In the
courts of many of the circuits, also, the busi
ness has increased to such an extent that the
delay of justice will call tbe attention of con
gress to an appropriate remedy. It is be
lieved that all is done in each circuit which
can fairly be expected from its judicial force.
The evils arising from delay are less heavily
felt by tho United States than by privato
suitors, as its causes are advanced
by the coarts when it is seen
that they involve the discus
sion of questions of a public character. The
remedy suggested by the attorney-general, is
the appointment ot additional circuit judges,
and the creation of an intermediate court of
errors and appeals, which shall relieve the
supreme court of a part of its jurisdiction,
while a larger force is also obtained for tbe
performance of circuit duties. I commend
this suggestion to the consideration ot con
gress. It would seem to afford a complete
remedy, and would involve, if ten additional
circuit judges are appointed, an expenditure,
at the present rate of salaries, of not more
than sixty thousand dollars a year, which
would certainly be tmall in comparison with
the objects to be attained.
THE POSTOPFICE DEPARTMENT.
The report of the postmaster-general bears
testimony to the general revival ot business
throughout the country. The receipts of the
5 ostoffice department for the fiscal year ended
nne 30. 1879, were $30,011,982 86, being
$764,46-5 91 more than the revenues of the
preceding year. The amount realized from
the sale of postage stamps, stamped envel
opes, and postal cards, was $764,465 91 more
than in the preceding year, and $2,387,559 23
more than in 1877. The expenditures of the
department were $33,449,899 45, cf which
the sum of $376,461 was paid on liabilities
incurred in preceding years. The expendi
tures during the year were $801,209 77 lsss
than in the preceding year. This reduction
is to be attributed mainly to the operation ot
the law passed Jane 17, 187S, changing the
compensation of postmasters from a commis
sion on the value ot stamps sold, to a com
mission on stamps canceled. The amount
drawn from thn treasury on appropriations
in addition to the revenues of the depart
ment was $3,031,45496, being $2,276,197 86
less than in the preceding year. The ex
penditures fur the fiscal year ending June 30,
1881, are estimated at $39,920,900, and the
receipts from all sources at $32,210,000,
leaving a deficiency to be appropriated for,
out of the treasury, of $7,710,900. The re
lations ot the department with railroad coin-
nnnif a have been harmonized, notwithsiana-

their compensation, by the appropriation for
snec.ial facilities, and the railway poetoffice
lines have been greatly extended, especially in
the southern States. lhe interests oi tne
railway mail service and of the publio would
be creatlv promoted, and the expenditures
could be more readily controlled by the clas
sification of tbe employes ot the railway mau
service as recommended by the postmaster
general, the appropriation for salaries with
respect to which the maximum limit is al
ready fixed by law, to be made in gross. The
postmaster-general recommends an amend
ment of the law regulating the increase of
compensation for increased service and in
creased speed on star routes, so as to enable
him to advertise for proposals for such in
creased service and speed. He also suggests
the advantages to accrue to the commerce of
the country trom tbe enactment of a
general law authorizing contracts with
American-built steamers, carrying tne
American flic. for transporting the
mail between ports of the United
States and ports of the West Indies and
South America, at a fixed maximum price per
mile, the amount to be expended being regu
lated by annual appropriations, in like man
ner with tbe amount paid for tbe domestic
star service. Tho arrangement made by the
Dostrnaster-gener.il and the secretary of tbe
treasury for the collection of duty upon books
received in the man 'rom ioreign countries,
has proved so satisfactory in its practical op
eration that the recommendation is now
made that congress shall extend the pro
visions of the act of March 3, 1879, under
which this arrangement was made, so as to
apply to all other dutiable articles received
in the mails from foreign countries.
INDIAN
AFFAIRS.
The reports of the secretary of the interior
and of the commissioner ot Indian an airs,
setting forth the present state of our rela
tions with the Indian tribes on our ter
ritory, the measures taken to ad
vance their civilization and prosperity.
and the progress already achieved . . by
tbeui, will be iound of more than ordinary
interest. The general conduct of our Indian
population has bsen so satisfactory that the
occurrence of two disturbances which re
sulted in bloodshed and destruction of prop
erty, is all tbe more to be lamented.
THE UTS'S MASSACRE.
The history of the outbreak on the White
Civer Ute reservation in western Coloradj
has become so familiar by elaborate reports in
the public press, that its remarkable incidents
need not be stated here in ' detail. ' It is ex
pected that the settlement oi this diftuulty
will lead to such arrangements that will pre
vent further hostile contact between the la
dians and tbe border settlements in western
Colorado. The other disturbance occurred at
the Mescalero agency, in New Mexico, where
Victoria, at the head of a small band of ma
rauders, after committing many atrocities, be
ine vigorously chased by a military force.
made his way across the Mexi-
can border ana is now on ioreign
soil. While these occurrences, in which a
comparatively small number of Indians were
engaged, are most deplorable, a vast majority
of our Indian population have fully jusUhed
the expectations of those who believe that by
bamane and peaceful influences the Indian
can be led to abandon the habits of savage
life aud to develop a capacity for useful and
civilized occupations. What they have already
accomplished in the pursuit of agricultural
and mechanical work, the remarkable a access
which has attended the experiment of em
ploying as freighters a class of Indians hith
erto counted among the wildest and most in
tractable, and the general and urgent desire
expressed by them tor the education ot their
children, may be taken as sufficient prcol that
they will be found capable ot accomplishing
much more if they continue to 03 wisely
and fairly guided. The "Indian policy"
sketched in the report of the secretary of the
interior, the otject of which is to make
liberal provision tcr the education of the In
dian youth, to settle the Indians upon farm
lots in severalty, to give them title in fee to
their farms, inalienable for a certain number
of years, and when their wants are thus pro-
yiden for, to dispose by sale of the lands on
their reservations not occupied and nsed by
them, a fund to be formed out of the proceeds
for the benefit of the Indians, which will
gradually relieve the government of the ex
penses now provided for by annual appro
priations, mnst commend itself as just and
beneficial to the Indians, and aa also
calculated to remove those ob
structions which the existence of large
reservations presents to the settle
ment and development of the coun
try. I therefore earnestly recommend the
enactment of a law enabling the government
to give Indians a title in fee, inalienable for
twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned
to them by allotment. I alBO repeal the
recommendation made in my first annual
message, that a law be passed admitting In
ndians who can give satisfactory proof of
having, by their own labor, supported their
families for a number of years, and who
are willing to detach themselves from their
tribal relations, to the benefit of the tome
stead act, and to grant them patents con
taining the same provisions of inalienability
for a certain period.
THE INDIAN SCHOOL,
The experiment of sending a number of
Indian children, of both sexes, to the Hamp
ton normal and agricultural institute, in Vir
ginia, to receive an elementary English edu
cation and practical instruction in farming
and other useful industries, has led to results
so promising that it was thought expedient
to turn over the cavalry barracks at Carlisle,
in Pennsylvania, to the interior department.
This school bas now one hundred and fifty
eight pupils, selected from various tribes,
and is in full operation. Arrangements are
also made for the education of a nurtiber of
Indian boys and girls belonging to tribes on
the Pacific slope, in a similar manner, at
Forest Grove, in Oregon. These institutions
will commend themselves to the liberality of
congress and to the philanthropic munificence
of the American people.
THE INDIAN TERRITORY.
Last spring information was received of the
organization of an extensive movement in
the western States, the object of which was
the occupation by unauthorized persons of
certain lands in the Indian Territory ceded
by the Cherokees to the government for the
purpose of settlement by other Indian tribes.
On the twenty-ninth of April I issued a
proclamation warning all persons against
participation in such an attempt, and, by the
co-operation of a military force, the invasion
was promptly checked. It is my purpose to
protect the rights ot the Indian- inhabitants
of that Territory to the full extent of the Ex
ecutive power. But it would be unwise to
ignore the fact that a Territory so large and
fertile, with a population so sparse and with
so great a wealth ot unused resource', will be
found more exposed to the repetition of such
attempts as happened this year, when the
surrounding States are so densely settled, and
the westward movement of our population
looks still more eagerly for fresh lands to oc
cupy. Under such circumstances tbe diffi
culty of maintaining the Indian Territory
in its present state will greatly increase, and
the Indian tribes inhabiting it would do well
to prepare for such a contingency. I, there
fore, fully approve of tbe advice given to
them by the secretary of the interior on i re
cent occasion, to divide among themselves in
severalty aa large a quantity of their lands aa
they can cultivate, to acquire individual title
in fee, instead of their present tribal owner
ship in common, and to consider in what
manner tho balance of their lands may be
disposed of by the government for their ben
efit. By adopting such a policy they would
more certainly secure for themselves the value
of their possessions, and at the same time
promote their progress in civilisation and
prosperity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate
the present state of things in the Territory.
THE INDIAN SERVICE. ,
The question whether a change in the con
trol cf the Indian service should be made,
was in the forty-fifth congress referred to a
joint committee of both houses for inquiry
and report. In my last annual message I
expressed the hope that tho decision of that
question, then in prospect, "would arrest
further agitation of this subject, such agita
tion being apt to produce a disturbing effect
upon the service as well as the Indians them
selves." Since then, tha committee having
reported, tho question has been deci
ded in the negative by a vote in the house
of representatives. For the reasons here
stated, and in view of the fact that further
uncertainty on this point will be calculated
to obstruct other much-needed legislation, to
weaken the discipline of the service, and to
unsettle salutary measures now in progress
for the government and improvement of the
Indians, I respectfully recommend that the
decision arrived at by congress at its last ses
sion be permitted to stand.
THE PUBLIC LANDS.
' The efforts made bv the depaitment of tte
interior to arrest the depredations on the tim
ber lands of the United btates have been con
tinued, and have been met with considerable
suoees. A large number or cascsoi trespass
have been prosecuted in the courts ot tho
United State; others have been settled, the
trespassers offering to make payment to the
government for the value of the timber taken
by them. The proceeds of these prosecutions
and settlements turned into the treasury, far
exceed in amount the sums appropriated by
congress for this purpose. A more important
result, however, consists in the fact that the
destruction of our public forests by depreda
tion, although such cases still occur, has been
greatly reduced in extent, and it is probable
that if the present policy is vigorously pur
sued and sufficient provision to that end is
made by congress, such trespasses, at least
those on a large scale, can be entirely sup
pressed, except in the -territo
ries where umner ior tne uany
requirements of the population cannot, under
the present state of the law", be otherwise ob
tained. I therefore earnestly invite the at
tention of congress to the recommendation
made by the secretary of the interior, that a
law be enacted enabling tee government to
sell timber from the public lands without
conveying tbe fee, where such lands are
principally valuable tor the umber tnereon,
such sales to be so regulated as to conform to
domestic wants and business requirements.
while at the same time guarding against a
weeping destruction of the forests. Tbe
enactment of such a law appears to become a
more pressing necessity every day.
THB DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
My recommendations in former messages
are renewed in favor of enlarging the facili
ties of the department of agriculture. Ag
riculture is the leading interest and the per
manent industry of our people. It is to the
abundance of agricultural production, as
compared with our borne consumption, and
the largely increased and highly profitable
market abroad which we have enjoyed in re
cent years, that we are mainly indebted for
our present prosperity as a people. Wo
most look for its continued maintenance to
the same substantial resource. There is no
branch of industry in which labor, directed
by scientific knowledge, yields such increased
production in comparison with unskilled la
bor, and no branch of the public service to
hich the encouragement ot liberal appro
priations can be more appropriately ex
tended. . The omission to render such aid is
wise economy; but, oa the con
trary, undoubtedly reeutts in loesea
of immense sums annually that
might be saved through well directed efforts
of the government to promote this vital in
terest, lhe results already accomplished
with the very limited means heretofore placed
at the command of the department of agri
culture is an earnest of what may be expected
with increased appropriations for tbe several
purposes indicated in the report of the com
missioner, with a view to placing the depart
ment upon a footing which will enable it to
prosecute more ettecuvely the objects ior
which it is estabUshed. Appropriations are
needed for a more completa laboratory, for
the establishment of a veterinary division,
and a division ot forestry, and for an increase
of force. The requirements for these and
other purposes, indicated in the report of the
commissioner under the head of the immedi
ate necessities of the department, will not in
volve any expenditure of money that the
country cannot with propriety now undertake
in the interest of agriculture.
THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION.
It is gratifying to learn from the bureau of
education the extent to which educational
privileges throughout the United States have
been advanced during the year. No more
fundamental responsibility rests upon con
gress than that of devising appropriate meas
ures of financial aid ' to education, supple
mental to local action in the States and Ter
ritories, and in the District ot Columbia. Tbe
wise forethought of the founders of our gov
ernment has no' only furnished the basis for
the support of the common-Bchool systems of
the newer States, but laid the foundations for
the maintenance of their universities and
colleges of agriculture and the mechanic
arts. Measure in accordance with this tra
ditional policy for the further benefit of all
these interests, and the extension of the same
advantages to every portion of the country,
It ia hoped, will receive favorable considera
tion. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY.
To preserve and perpetuate the national lit
erature should be among tbe foremost cares
of the national legislature. The library gath
ered at the capitol still remains unprovided
with any suitable accommodations for its
rapidly-increasing stores. The magnitude
and importance of the collection, increased as
it is by the deposits made under the law of
copyright, by domestic and foreign exchanges,
and by the scientific library of the Smithso
nian institution, call for building accommo
dations which shall be at once adequate and
fire-proof. The location of such a public
building, which should provide for the press
ing necessities of the present, and tor the
vast increase of the nation's books in the fu
ture, is a matter which addresses itself to the
discretion of congreea. It is earnestly rec
ommended as a measure which should unite
all suffrages, and which should no longer be
delayed.
THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT.
The joint commissioa created by the act of
congress of August 2, 1876, for the purpose
Of supervising and directing the completion
of the Washington national monument, of
which oom mission the President is a member,
has given careful attention to this subject,
and already the strengthening of the founda
tionbas so far progressed as to insure the en
tire success of this part of the work. A
massive layer of masonry bas been introduced
below the original foundation, widening the
base, increasing the stability of the struc
ture, and rendering it possible to carry tha
shaft to completion. It is earnestly recom
mended that such further appropriations be
made for the continued prosecution of the
work as may be necessary for tbe completion
of this national monument at an early day.
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
; In former messages, impressed with tho
importance of the subject, I bave taken occa
sion to commend to congress the adoption of
a generous policy toward the District, of Co
lumbia. The report of the commissioners of
the District, herewith transmitted, contains
suggestions and recommendations, to all of
which I earnestly invite your careful atten
tion. I ask yonr eaily and favorable consid
eration of tbe views which they express as to
the urgent need of legislation tor the reclama
tion of the marshes of the Potomac and its
eastern branch, within the limits of the city,
and for the repair of the streets of the capital,
heretofore laid with wooden blocks, and now
by decay rendered almobt impassa
ble and a source of imminent dan-
fer to the health of its citizens,
he means at the disposal ot the commis
sioners are wholly inadequate to the accom
plishment of these important works, and
should be supplemented by timely appropri
ations from the Federal treasury. The filling
of the flats in front of the city will add to tho
adjacent lands and parks now owned by the
United States a large and valuable domain,
sufficient, it is thought, to reimburse its en
tire cost, and will also, as an incidental re
sult, secure the permanent improvement of
the river for purposes of navigation. Tho
constitution having invested congress with
supreme and exclusive jurisdiction over tho
District of Columbia, its cilizons must of
necessity look to congress alone) for all
needful legislation affecting their interest ;
and as the territory of this District is tho
common property of the people of the United
States, who, equally with its resident citi
zens, are interested in the prosperity of the ir
capital, I cannot doubt that you will be
amply sustained by the general voice ot the
country in any measures you may adopt for
this purpose. I also invite the favorable
consideration of congress to the wants of the
publio schools of this District, as exhibited in
the report of the commuBionets. While the
number of pupils is rapidly increas
ing, no adequate provision exists ior
a corresponding increase of school accom
modation, and the commissioners are without
the means to meet this urgent need. A num
ber of the buildings now used for school pur
poses are rented, and are, in important par
ticulars, unsuited for the purpose. Tbe cause
of popular education in the District of Colum
bia is surely entitled to the same considera
tion at the hands of the national government
as in the several States and Territories, to
which munificent grants of tha public lands
have been made for tbe endowment of schools
and universities.
