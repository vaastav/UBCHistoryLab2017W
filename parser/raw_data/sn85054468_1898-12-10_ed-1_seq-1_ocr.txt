Paris, Dec 9. Secretary Moore, ot the
American Peace Commission., and Senor
Villamitla, who Is acting as secretary ot
the Spanish Commission during the ab
jsenee or Senor Ojcda, the regular secre
tary, who Is still suffering Irom the effects
of his cold, have completed the drafting of
the treaty of peace by dividing some of
the articles for the sake of clearness.
Tlie treaty will consist of seventeen ar
ticles, Instead of fourteen, as was at one
lime contemplated. 11 will undoubtedly be
signed tomorrow, the hour depending upon
the completion of the engrossing.
At the close ot the last meeting of the
Joint Peace Commission, Senor Montcros,
president of the Spanish Commission,
made a statement which, though not tech
nically so. was virtually a- protest against
the rejection of ccrt-iln proposition'? made
by the Spaniards.
Among the proj uns thus indicated
was one for the recognition of existing
contracts, for public works in the ceded
territories, and another for the delivery to
the Spaniards of the sums deposited In the
public treasury, Caja dc Depositions, as
ruarantecs for the fultirmeat of these con
tracts and other public engagements.
The American attitude can ba best
described as a refusal to accept the con-T-ni-
without investigations, some ot
the Weyier contracts being, possibly,
queer ones. It was .lee'nred that the
Vnlted States Goernment, in a spirit of
Justice, will return all guarantee moneys
to the persons legally entitled to the
same.
Mr Moore and Senor Vlllarrutln com
pleted the treaty at S o'clock- 'tonight
The task was. more laboriouo than tiai
anticipated. The material con-Ists. first
of the .articles indicated in the protocol,
second, of subsidiary articles made up of
a large number of Spanish proposals,
and, third, an American list accepting
some of these articles and rejecting oth
ers, and a series of counter-proposals
from the Americans which the Spaniards
accepted en bloc .The number of arti

the above documents proved to be sev

Madrid, Dec 9. Premier Sagasta today
officially Informed the queen regent of
the result of the proceedings of the Paris
peace conference yesterday, adding that
the treaty would probably be signed to
morrow. The attitude of Senor Montero
Rios, chairman of the Spanish Commis
sion, is lauded ev erywhere. It is con
sidered that It is due to him that the
Americans accepted documents yesterday
which were rejected by them at a pre
vious conference. Senor Sagasta nppears
to be satisfied with the political declara
tions of Gen. Wcylcr and Senor Romero
Robledo.
THE KYLE STORY DENIED.
Jnpnn Iln Not Offered to llnj the
Philippine!.
Statements made yesterday In several
authoritative quarters show bej ond doubt
that the impression gained by Senator
Kyle of South Dakota that Japan had
offered the United States JMO.OOO.OuO for
the Philippines was erroneous. The story
was denied at the State Department and
It was said nt the Japanese legation that
nothing was known of any such offer, its
publication, however, has served to bring
to light additional evidence of Japan's
feeling for this country and the cordial
relations now existing between them.
Japan's friendly attitude regarding the
Philippines has been manifested to the
United States more than once since the
fortunes of war threw the Islands Into
tlie iossessIon of America. Immediately
upon the opening of the discussion as to
what the United States would do with the
Islands, Jaian let it be known that her
desire was for the United States to re
tain control and iwssesslon of them, be
lieving that the equilibrium of political
affairs In the Orient would be best sub
served by that course.
Later in the year, and shortly before
the departure of Toru Hoshl, then Jap
anese minister to this country, he called
upon Secretary Day and formally outlined
Japan's Iews In the mat'er. The govern,
ment, the minister said, was prepared to
lndore any plan the United States might
determine upon for the disposition of the
Philippines. It would prefer that the
United States should keep them and either
manage them directly or engage to con
trol a government by the natives. If, for
any reason, the United States should de
sire to avail Itself of the assistance ot any
other power In that behalf, Japan stood
ready to aid In controlling the Islands, or
to join the United States and any other
power that It might eleef to go Into the
arrangement. It Is understood that the
new minister. Mr. Komura, is charged
with supporting the same policy outlined
In the interview between Minister Toru
Hoshl and Secretary Day.

In regard to the rumor that his gov

Mr. Komuru denied any knowledge of
any such offer and begged to be excused
from discussing the possibility that his
government might contemplate such a
step.
Mr. Komura said that he came to this
city to look Into several matters which
had recently come up relating to the com
mercial interests of this country und Ja
pan. The minister received a visit from the
Japanese consul at this port and discussed
with him the variouB details ofthe Jap

Chicago, Dec 9. Tho developments of
the day In the fight for and against the
extension of the street railway franchise's
In Chicago for a period of fifty scars are
substantially as follows:
The minority members of the city coun
cil are making a plan to withdraw from
the deliberations of the Joint commltteo on
streets and alleys, which has the extension
ordinance under consideration, If the com
mittee votes down a resolution declaring
against the consideration of any extension
ordinance at the present time. The minor
ity men claim that, if left to themselves,
the alleged boodlers will work out their
own destruction. B
Public demonstrations to the number of
a dozen or more'were held this afternoon
and tonight to protest against the passage
of the extension of the ordinance. Badges
have appeared on the streets bearing u
portrait of the major, with the words:
"Save the streets; stand by Chicago and
Major Harrison against Yerkes and
boodle; save the streets."
Petitions are being circulated In every
ward. Every member of the joint com
mittee is. It Is said, being subjected tj
close police surveillance, and Chief or
Detectives Colleran has added fifty de
tectives to the regular detail for Uim
purpose. Tlie sensational feature ot the
day was the attempt by members of tne
Monticello Club, the leading Democratic
organization of the city, to pass a resolu
Hon of an Incendiary character. the
meeting of the club was attended by
many prominent I'emocrnts, Including
Judges Murray F. Tuliy and IMward F.
Dunne, Representatives McGooity and
Dennis Sulllvun. City Prosecutor II. S.
Taylor, Commissioner Jones, John T.
Keating, of the board of education, and
others. The resolution which caused al
most as much of a jstlr as did the mayor's
"riot call,"" remarks was preceded by a
number of "whereases" relative to the
enormity of the alleged franchise steal,
and was as follows:
"Resolved by the members of the Mon
tilcello club. That the terms and provisions
Of this ordinance stamps the officers, di
rectors and stockholders of the street car
companies of this city familiar with the
same, no matter how high their social,
financial, commercial or religious stand
ing, as bribe-givers und corruptlonlsts
more dangerous to the public welfare
than most of the men now confined In
Jollet, and that the alderman who votes
for the same by that vote confesses hlm
belf a boodler and a scoundrel unlit to
associate with honest men and who will
leae his children the heritage of disgrace
that gold cannot gild nor time efface.
"That a committee ot ten be appointed
by this club to participate with other com
mittees, bodies and citizens In arranging
for a monster mass meeting of 100,000 citi
zens, to be held within the elevated loop
on tho night when said ordinances are
upon the calendar for final passage, and
In further arranging for escorts of 2,000
men for each alderman, whose duty will
be to await adjournment of the council
and escort the aldermen safely to their
homes or elsewhere with music or other
demonstrations appropriate to each re
spective case."
The resolution was Introduced by John
F. Keating, State and national president
of- the Ancient Order of Hibernians.
Judge Tully attacked It vigorously.
"If we pass this resolution," he said,
"there will soon be an end of the Morti
cello Club. It Is a resolution which might
emanate from an Anarchistic body and
we are not Anarchistic"
The club finally voted to strike out the
incendiary last paragraph and the resolu
tion thus amended was adopted.
Mayor Harrison, In commenting tonight
on the proposed resolution, said:
"I am once for all heartily opposed to
public demonstrations which can be con
strued as lawless."
Mayor Harrison addressed most of the
meectings that were held tonight. He
devoted his time to scoring Charles T.
Yerkes, the head of the street railway
companies.

Mortjrnuca and Payment of Inter.
cut to lie Saul-ended.
Santiago, Dec 9. The comments ot the
Cuban newspaper. El Porvlnir, on the
action of Capt. Juan Castillo, who, with
three companions, rode on horseback
Into the Clrcnlo Espanol, or Spa Uh
Club, on Wednesday evening nnd des
troyed chandeliers and furniture with
machetes, are Interesting In the light cf
tho desire of , the Cuban Radicals that the
United States Immediately withdraw
their military forces and turn the man
agement of the island over to the revo
lutionists. The sentiments of El Pro
vlnlr are not Indorsed by all classes, but
the paper Is recognized as the leading or
gan of the Cuban republic party In this
province. Instead of blaming Castl to
for his lawless action, the paper plac s
tho blame for the affair on the managers
of the Clrculo Espanol for daring to keep
the place open when they knew tMat the
club Is abhorrent to the Cuban patriots.
It calls, the club a den of criminals, while
at the same time It knows that It Is
shortly- to be consolidated with the An-glo-Amerlcan
Club, to which Col. Bea
com and many other American officers
belong. It. says that the holy wrath of
the people cannot bo tampered with und
declares that the privilege of destroy I ng
what one does not approve of Is one of
the Inalienable rights of popular sover
eignty. The article winds up with the
statement that the authorities will be
impotent to prevent such acts as Cas
tillo's, because they have the sanction of
popular sentiment.
It was at first thought that Castillo,
who was arrested late Wednesday night,
would be kept in confinement until his
trial, but he has been admitted to bail
and released. Col. Hencom has brought
tne matter to tne attention of tho su
preme court. This will be the first chance
of the court, which Is composed wholly
of Cubans, to show the world whether It
Is capable of protecting the rights of nil
citizens within Its jurisdiction. Castillo's
trial will probably not begin before the
return of Gen Wood from Gibara.
Vice President Barbossa, ot the Cub-in
Club, said In conversation with a groun
of Cubans In the rotunda of the club
house today that If the Americans had
kept Castillo In jail any longer ten thou
sand Cubans would have known tho
reason why.
When Gen. Wood comes back to the
city he will be petitioned by the lawyers
here not to carry out his scheme of sus
endlng the foreclosure of mortgages on
plantations and other real estate and the
payment of Interest until March 31, next.
The lawyers want the foreclosures to be
gin immediately. They declare that the
interests of the mortgagees arc as much
deserting of consideration as those of
the land owners. If the mortgages are
foreclosed and tho property sold It will
enable the lawyers to collect fees. Your
correspondent has high authority for
stating that Gen. Wood will not allow
plantations to be sacrificed until owners,
have had a chance to redeem them. He
will, however, modify the plan which pro
hibits creditors entering suit to rccoter
Interest. Such suits will be allowed and
when judgment is obtained the creditors
may levy on whatever property the debt
ors may have outside their plantations
which is not ntcded for the cultivation of
the land. It Is believed that this scheme
will work most satisfactorily to all con
cerned. Gen. Wood will not permit the
sacrifice of plantations for one-tenth their
real value because the owners are unable,
en account of the three years' war, to re
deem the mortgages on them.
Col. Francisco VnlHente, who was re
cently appointed chief of the rural mount
ed police, told your correspondent today
that he had 390 men ready to enter upon
the task of maintaining order In the In
terior as soon as they could be mounted
and armed. Col. VnlHente wants to In
crease the force to C0I men. He says that
300 are not suflltlent. As the, department
Is not able to pay more than HiWW a
month for the maintenance of the rural
police. It Is pretty certain that Gen. Wood
will keep the number down to 301 men.
Col. Valliente will lay- before Gen. Wood
a plan to bring 50J bronchos from Texas nt
the expense of the province and to assign
them to the men, withholding a portion
of each, man's salary every' month until
his mount Is paid for. Col. Valliente re
ceives $209 per month. He says that some
of those he will recommend for appoint
ment as rural police are men who have
been committing robberies In San Luis anl
Guantanamo. lie advances the novel prop
osition that they are good men, who have
been drhen by hunger to steal. Tills is
not a tenable argument, In view- of the
Immense quantities of food the Americans
are giving away to anyone who properly
asks for It. Valliente says the men who
aie stealing were under his command dur
ing the rebellion and that they were good
uoldlers.
The Cuban newspapers this nfternoon
say that the failure of the Americans to
offer the services ot the Fifth Regiment
Band for the Maceo commemoration was
an act of conspicuous discourtesy to the
Cuban people. They- declare that Maceo
was much more entitled to military honors
from the Americans than the Spanish gen
eral Vara del Rey, whose memory was
treated with such distinguished considera
tion when his body was removed to Ha
ana recently.
Forty members of the Fifth Regulars
and sixty of the Fifth Immunes have gone
North on the Obdam to recuperate. Their
departure cuts the dally sick report of the
two regiments In two.

Havana, Dec. 9. The "Spanish commis
sion replied today to the American note
contalnlng.-accusatlons against the Colon
battalion "at Santo Domingo and other
Spanish troops at Batabaho, The charges
were made by people residing In the
towns referred to and were sent to the
American commissioners for action. Tlie
Spanish note declares that the charges
are grossly exaggerated am that what
ever excesses were committed by the
troops were duo to the provocation of the
residents of the towns. Referring to the
charges of robbery against the Spanish
soldiers, the note says that they are ab
solutely false. The American commis
sioners have started an Investigation of
the matter on their own account, oiid the
Spanish note will probably be answered
In a few days.
The American note, embodying the com
plaints of tho residents of Santo Do
mingo nnd Batabano, was. delivered to
the Spanish commission several days ago.
It declared that a large nhmbcr of the
people of Santo Domingo had been killed
by the troops stationed there, while many
others had been robbed. The soldiers, it
was added, had also attacked the rlvll
authorities who had attempted to pre
serve order, and wounded them. The
residents of the town were thrown Into
a state of pnnlc by tho action of the
troops and, fearing for 'their lives, had
fled to the mountains for safety. Tho
store of a man named Martinez was
sacked by the soIJlers, who carried off a
large sum of money In addition to their
other loot. A similar condition of law
lessness was complained of at Batabano.
The battalion which la charged with
these crimes and outragep hi now In Ha
vana, and much anxletycib felt lest they
attempt similar action In- the city, which
Is at present sadly In need of police pro
tection. The Two Hundred aijd Sfcond New
York Regiment, under GfiiiDlvles, num
bering 1.500 men, arrived, litre this morn
ing. The regiment brought in mules nnd
D5 horses and carts. These "have already
been landed. At 10 o'clock tomorrow
morning the troops will take the train
for Pinar del Rio province at the Crls
tlna station. They will march from the
wharf to the station through the main
streets of the city. The men are all in
good condition and hale greatly1 Impress
ed the Havaneso by their military ap
pearance. The American commissioners have re
ceived a committee of Cuban officers who
complalnW that Siianish oflleers had torn
off their hats and stripped ihcm of their
uniforms. Gen. Wade, president of the
American commission, told the committee
that Spain was still sovErrlgn here and
that they ought to drew a civilians and
wait until the Americans vTj' In iKcses
slon before displaying their .lags and uni
forms. He added that If hey did not
have the patience to wait untjl thn they
had no reason to- complain ngalnst the
conduct of the Spaniards, and the com
mission would do nothing for them.
The commission sent to Gen Greene this
afternoon many"npp Icat'ons that had been
received from Spaniards and old employes
of the city police force for places on the
new force that Gen. Greene will organize.
Gen. Greene Is closely studying plans for
the reorganization of the police. In all
the preparatory work for establishing a
new administration here l)e has been high
ly successful.
Senor Dolz, secretary ot public works.
Insists on a decree which appears In the
Official Gazette today that In spite ot the
American military occupation of some
parts of the Islands, his authority still ex

for the construction of a railroad through
the central part of the Island and for an

Berlin, Dec 9. Mr. Chamberlain's friendly-
references to .Germany .In his speech
yesterday are uniformly- received with fa
vor by the press and In official quarters.
The seml-ofllclal Post, premising that
there Is to be no chestnut pulling, Eays:
"Mr. Chamberlain's warm accentuation
of British friendship for Germany will
certainly awalten a responsive chord here.
If Great Britain Is minded to follow the
path Indicated by Mr. Chamberlain he
may 1 assured that Germany will frank
ly and- honestly place her hand In her's."
The conservative Krcuz Zeltung, oppos
ing the Idea of an alliance with Great Brit
ain, expressed approval of an undctstand
Ing Where German and British interests
are Involved. It says a mutual approach
might be extremely advantageous to the
cause of peace.
Tho National Zeltung ascribes Mr.
Chamberlain's friendliness to disappoint
ment at President McKinley's coolness to
ward an Anglo-Saxon alliance and to
anxiety concerning the development ot the
American mercantile marine, but It de
clares that It Is absolutely In sympathy
with an entente If It Is limited to common
Interests.
The Vossische Zeltung as not a word
to say against Mr. Chamberlain's view.
Tho Yolks Zeltung says that an agree
ment on mutual Interests would be full of
advantage to Germany.
Paris. Dec 9. Tlie sieech delivered last
night by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, the
British colonial secretary, has salted the
wound made by- Sir Edmund Monson, the
British ambassador here, and has had
the effect of nullifying any soothing
effect the semi-official note published, to
day by the embassy- might have had. The
.Journal des Debats says that Mr. Cham
berlain's speech may he summarized thus:
"Gentlemen"', we are "friends with every
body extept France,"
It adds that Mr. Chamberlain conttnds
that If France wants to be friendly with
Great Britain she must yield on cery
polnt. The British lion fancies that
France Is treading on his tall whener
she does not give all the lumps of meal
his greed demands.
The Temps complains of Mr. Chamber

of nggTesienoss toward Great Brltain-
M. De Cassagnac, In the Authorlte,

New York. Dec 3. An unlucky num

board oval in Madison Square Garden
tonight. Thirty-one started on Sunday-
night, all full of spirit and hope and In

fallen by the wayside during the five days
of the contest. The unlucky thirteen w ho
arc left, from present indications, are
likely to finish, with possibly- two or
three exceptions. They, have not any
flush of health on their cheeks and their
faces are drawn and pinched. Turvllle
quit shortly- before midnight.
When off their bicycles they move as .f
100 years old and had been accumulating
rheumatism during fifty years. In spite
ot all this, the men whirled around the
track today as If they were full of

o'clock. Miller, who, barring accidents,
looked like a winner, rode twenty miles
and a half. Waller got drowsy on the
wheel, the same as he did on Thursday,
and toppled over three times. .At mid
night on Thursday he looked like a man
on a spree and rode all over the track,
but he freshened up after an hour's ret
and begun to show the way.
At 5 o'clock this morning AYaller gained
the lead and held it until 9 o'clock, when
Miller went to the front and remained
there all day. By- night he was so far
ahead that everyone conceded first prize
to him unless something uncxpectifl hap
pened and he looked less likely to sue

the adrals-ion price being doubted, the
crowd was again big. 9,000 or 10.00!) people
being present the latter part of the evening-
At 1:10 Miller, amid demonstrations
from the crowd, passed his world's record
figures of last year. He spurted several

slowed down to his old plodding gait. At
midnight he was a little more than two

Create Uir&cnltieit en. Otis Stilt
'eBnUatln;r for Suanllx Prisoner
It Mny He Xecejiparjr to TnUe
Them Forcibly Confidence In Our
Coinmandem.
In respcnsfl.'to instructions from th
President; Admiral Dewey has reported by
telegraph his views on tho situation in the
Philippines, with particular reference to
the attitude of AgulnaMo. The difpatih
containing these views was received
Thursday.
Dispatches have also been received from
Gen. Otis, telling what he thinks of the
conditions In the islands. These message
were sent, it Is understood, to guide, the
President In tne task of furnishing a sta
ble.government to the Philippines without
making changes that woud cause dissat
isfaction to the inhabitants. With refer
ence to tho Information, it is admitted
that there is a possibility of trouble w-tth
Aguinaldo when the United States as
sumes authority over the entire archipel
ago. Officials, however, profess to believe,
that Aguinaldo will give way when the
final test comes. Aguicatdo's ambition is
regarded as the greatest obstacle to the
establishment of normal condition, it
will ba a severe blow to his vanity- to sur
render the tights he assumed as president
of his so-called' republic. Every body in
the higher official circles Jiere recognizes
that ho will require careful handling to
prevent troub'e. and If the efforts which
ure now- being made by Gen. Otis to bring;
Aguinaldo to a realization that the 1'n.teil
States wKl brook no Interference with lta
assumpan of complete control over tn
Philippines are not successful, drastic
measures will be carried out to effect tne
dlsbamlment tit the Filipino army.
Gen. Otis Is now acting under Instruc
tions from"the War. Department to UKft his .
good offices with Aguinaldo to secure.the
release" of all the Spanish prisoners in
,the custody of the Filipinos. So far.- h
nas not succeeded In securing Aguinaldo s '
assent to the proposition. If Gen. QtKs.
efforts prove unavailing up to the time
American roverelgnty over the archipel
ago is proclaimed, the prisoners will be
taken from Aguinaldo without further
parley. Tlie Administration appears to
lie fully determined to pursue that cQurse
It Is understood that the Government will
place the islands under combined mili
tary and civil authority, such as exlvts
today In Porto Rico. This status will be
preserved until Congress determines what
shall be lonc Gen. Otis will -probably be
made the miliiary-'govcrnor with, broad
discretionary powers." A Cabinet officer
said yesterday that, with Admiral Dewey
and Gen. Otls-at Manila, the Government
had no uneasiness as to the result of thn
transfer of authority in the Islasds.

CABEY NOT A CANDIDATE
Senator Clark of Wyunlnc Proli
nlilj Will Miceeeil Himself.
Cheyenne, Wyo Dec 9. A decided
change was made today In Wyoming
senatorial contest by a declaration roado
by former Senator Carey to his sup
porters that he will not le n candidate.
Carey has been considered one of the
leading possibilities for election by the
State legislature, which meets In January.
His decision not to be a candidate leaves,
among the more prominent applicants,
John C. Davis, a banker of Rawlins;
Gov. W. A. Richards. Col. J. L. Torrej,
former State Treasurer Ottp Gramm, and
Clarence D Clark, the present senator.
Judge Carey's withdrawal materially aids
the candidacy of Senator Clark and his
re-election Is regarded as pretty certain.
