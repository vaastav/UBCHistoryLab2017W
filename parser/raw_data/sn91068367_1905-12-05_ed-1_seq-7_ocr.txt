Meriwether Requested Official In
vestigation When Re Heard of
liranch's Death.
Annapolis, Md., November 29. Mid
ehipniaii Minor Meriwether today told
his story of the first fight between him
mid Midshipman James R Branch, Jr.,
which was followed by the death of
Branch. He closed it with the words:
"I have never seen him since. We
parted as friends."
He was testifying in his own behalf
before the court martial which is try
iug him on charges that embrace one
of manslaughter in connection with tha
death of Branch.
Meriwether -was on the witness
stand an hour and a half, testifying
in detail as to the fight and tlic in
cidents , that led to it. His evidence
excited greater interest than has any
previous portion of the trial, and while
speaking the accused was at times vis
ibly affected. When he left the wit-
ess stand the defense rested.
The prosecution called in rebuttal
several .Midshipmen, Dr. Thomas, neu
rologist of the James Hopkins hos
pital; Surgeon Byrnes, of the Naval
Academy, and Captain George 1 Col
vocoresses, commandant of midship
men. It is expected that argument of,
counsel will be concluded and the case
given to the court on Friday.
Annapolis, .Md., November 20. Mid
shipman Minor Meriwether took the
stand in the court martial today.
Meriwether told of liranch's- animos
ity toward him, saying Branch was
particularly disagreeable and fre
uuentty said he was going to bilge
witness. Branch "ran" him and re
ported him several times.
While on the Hartford at Newport
News some fruit was being brought
on ship. Witness, Branch and many
others were helping themselves to
fruit. Branch told him to turn in.
Witness said, "Go to hell." Branch
made a report of insulordination, dis
respect and not turning in promptly
4,I told these facts to tin executive
officer," said Meriwether, "and he took
off all but the last charge. 1 heard
that Branch wanted to fight, but I paid
no attention to it"
Branch made an extra inspection of
his room and had tried to get a report
against him. Meriwether continued:
"That night after consulting my
friend 1 went to Branch's room with
Jaeger, i asked Pritchard if I could
see Branch and was told that I could.,
I went in Tirani'h room :uid the licrht
was turned on. 1 said that I had
come to see him about what occurred.
Branch said, 'You arc a damn fool to
come to see me; you know that my
class hates you. 1 said, 'That is not
so; you are the only one who does.'
Branch then asked: 'What if I doV
1 said, "Then you are a damn sneak
ing coward and I will fight you,
though I am not in lighting condition.'
I added. 'If you will get up I will lick
you.' He said. 'You mean you will
try.' 'That's what I will,' I said, 'and
if you Avill get up I will show you.'
He did not get up, and after a little
further. conversation Jaeger and I left
the room.
"I called Branch what I did be
cause I was told the custom was that
;i fight would end feeling and Branch
had told me he was going to 'bilge'
me that is, make me fail, and I
wanted to fight and end the matter.
I did not intend to fight when I went
to the room, but he again told me
that he Intended to 'bilge' me."
Meriwether's counsel then asked him
about his refraining from hitting
Branch during the fight, although al
lowed to do so, underlie rules. The
witness told of two instances of this,
explaining that he did not believe any
blows should Ik? struck in a stand-off
fight unless the men were on their
feet. He also told how be fouled and
offered to frive up the fight, but the
seconds would not allow it
"After the quarrel with Branch,"
said he, "Midshipman McKittrick came
to my room and told me that he had
been appointed Branch's second to ar
range a flight ' I wanted Jaeger as
mines. The details were then arrang
ed. During the fight we first fell
under the blinds.' About the twelfth
round I rushed Branch and both fell
sideways through the door. The next
round Branch hit a terrific uppercut.
It stunned me for some rounds. I
returned to his jaw. He threw his
head back and I returned but swung
my arm around his neck. We fell in
that position, his head striking the
floor. We were lifted up. My arm
could not be used for the next two
rounds. My left arm "was crushed In
a football game about three years ago.
I had a severe operation but failed
physically. However, I passed the
next year. The arm is still weaker
than the other." ,
Meriwether then showed a deep
scar on the wr cf the left ami. He
said a silver plate had bce.i put in
there.
.U the end of the twenty-third
round." he continued, "Mr. Branch
came across the room and we both
apologized, and he said, 'Afterwards
we will le friends He then left, and
I have never seen hira since. We
parted as friends. I could not go to
break fafe the next morning. J had to
go to the hospital. An orderly came
and said that there was a man uncon
scious in the hall. He was brought
to the hospital that night Aftfr the
operation Dr. Amen told me that
Branch was doing welU A!ont 3
o'clock the next afternoon I was told
by a nurse that Branch was dead. I
requested an official investigation by
the superintendent. I was hurt and
grieved beyond all expression. I think
that Mr. Branch was indeed fortunate
in being in his place, in going to sleep
and r.ot waking up, than to be in
mine and having to live this life after
this sad and deplorable affair."
In answer to a question Meriwether
said: "If I had not resented Mr.
Branch's continued 'actions, I would be
in the same position as another class
mate with whom no one has anything
to do. Under these circumstances, I
would have to resign and could never
hold up my head again."
The prosecution then began its cross
examination. Meriwether said in an
swer to a question: "Hazing consists
of physical exercises. Running is
much .worse than hazing."
J-ieutenant Commander Robinson
"Hazing is a molestation."
Meriwether "Branch had taken a
number of opportunities of reporting
me and asking others to report me."
The defendant was requested to de
scribe running as Branch had conduct
ed it toward him. Pressed for direct
answers as to what Branch had done,
Meriwether said: "I don't care to re
late them."
Meriwe'her then whispered to the
;udye-advoeate and the question was
withdrawn.
It was evident that Meriwether hes
itated to mention certain things be
fore the women, of whom there were
;i number in the court room. He then
declared that he had not been "ratty,"
but had unfairly acquired the repu
tation. Captain George II. Colvoeoresses,
commandant of midshipmen, was the
first witness for the rebuttal. He told
of ja conversation with Midshinman
Churchill Humphreys, president of the
second class, in which he had told
Humphreys that he wajflfcnder oath to
obey all regulations'. He as command
ant took the stand that lighTing at the
academy was against good order and
discipline and would not be tolerated.
"This." he said. "I think, is also the
view of Superintendent Sands."
Midshipman Joseph R. Williams, of
Patersou. N. J., a member of -he first
class of the naval academy, 'who testi
fied before the court martial yester
day, was this morning dropped from
the navy for general inefficiency by
order of Secretary Bonaparte.
Midshipman Williams testified yes
terday that Commander Hugo Oster
haus had reported a midshipman for
not resenting an insult. He was not
dropped on account of this .testimony
reflecting on a naval officer, but it is
stated because he has been unsatis
factory in several of his studies dur
ing the present term and was set back
a class last year. The superinten
dent's recommendation that he 'be dis
missed was made before the Meri
wether court martial proceedings be
gan. Williams, was a leading member
of the academy track team.

Dr. Pattee also testified that pre
vious to the operation Dr. McLeod

ing that it be burned in a furnace
. Under cross examination Dr. Pattee
said h3 had worked several years at
the Dr Bishop's office, where Miss
Geary went and admitted that he had
performed operations there. This clos

which he declared would he an alibi.
He claimed that Dr. McLeod's part
of the case was simply that of trying
to save the woman's life. The attor
ney suggested that Hunt and Craw

Andrew Hamilton Located in Paris
Witness Retained in the Mutual Life
Insnrance Company at a Salary of
$3,000 North Carolina Policy Hold
ers Contested Right of the Company
to Increase Assessments on Certain
Class of Policies.
New York, November 29. The res
ignation of Richard A. McCurdy. as
president of the Mutual Life Insurance
Company was the most important de
velopment of the life insurance situa
tion today.
President MeCurdy's management of
the affairs of the company has been
the subject of inquiry by the legisla
tive investigating committee which
brought out the fact that during his
presidency very large commissions
were paid to his son, Robert H. Mc
Curdy, and his son-in-law, Louis A
Thebaud. The outcome of the strug
gle to secure "ontrol of the Mutual
Life Company is awaited with inter
est.
Charles P. McClelland, a former state
senator from WTest Chester county,
testified before the committee today
that he lived in the Mutual Life In
surance Company's house in Albany,
conducted by Andrew C. Fields, in
1903, while he was a senator and a
member of the insurance committee
of that body. He stated that it nevar
occurred to hin as improper, as he
and Fields were old friends: It was
shown that in several years while Mr.
McClelland was r.ot a senator he was
retained by the Mutual Life Insur
ance Company at $3,000 a year, and
Mr. Hughes had much difficulty in ob
taining a statement of what he did
to earn that retainer. He said he
appared before legislative committees
to argue against the savings bank
taxes and franchise tax bills.
Mr. McClelland had just stated that
h was never employed by the Equit
able Life Assurance Society, when Mr.
Hughes showed him a voucher for
$3,1)00 Paid hy that society to the firm
of which Mr. McClelland is a member.
It was written in his handwriting bat
Mr. McClelland said he could not re
member it. It was credited to a war
ter company account as were also oth
er vouchers paid by the Equitable So
ciety to William N. Johnson am;
Charles T. Lewis, amounting to $6,500.
Tohn C. McCan, son of the presi
dent of the New York Life Insuraice
(Company, told the committee toda
that Andrew Hamilton, the legislative
agent who got large sums of money
without an accounting from the New
York Life Insurance Company had
been located in Paris and that he had
received a message from President Mc
Call, asking him to come to New Tori:
to appear before the committee and
render an accounting of his expenbes
To induce him to do that Mr. McCali
aid he was going to start for Paris
on Saturday.
George D. Eidridge, actuary of the
Mutual Reserve life Insurance Compa
ny said the policy-holders of North
Carolina in 1896 or 1898 contested the
right of the company to increase its
assessments on the fifteen year class
of policies.. It vtas a concerted move
ment by attorneys. The courts gave
judgments against the company com
pelling it to return premiums amount
ing to about $100,000. The judgments
have not been paid, but are now in
the courts on appeal. The court of
appeals of New York state decided
against the company and an appeal
to the United States supreme court is
now pending. Mr. Eidridge said there
had been litigalion over the right to
assess the holders of policies of the
15 year class' in many other states
and the company's attitude had been
sustained. The right of the company
to so assess, he said, was sustained in
North Carolina, but the manner in
which the assessment was made was
a discrimination.
BLOODSHED IN SEBASTOPOL
Mutinous Sailors and Trooos Enjraffe
in a Desperate Battle -The Torn
and Forts' Bombarded bv Guns of a
Russian Cruiser.
St. Petersburg-. November 29. Se
bastopol was today the scene of a des
perate battle between the mutinous
sailors and the troops in the forts on
shore.
During: the battle the town and the
forts were bombarded by the guns of
the cruiser Otchakoff which now lies a
burning wreck off Admiralty Point, its
hull riddled with shells and its flaunt
ing red ensitm of revolution down.
Many of the crew were killed or
wounded. According- to one report
the barracks of the mutineers was car
bined by storm after the mutinous fleet
which is said to have "numbered ten
vessels had surrendered, and the whole
position is now in the hands of the
troops under the command of General
Neplueff. The Associated Press how
ever, is unable to guarantee the cor
rectness of this report.
Owing to the interruption of the tel
srraph dttails of the battles are difficult
to obtain, but as The Associated Press
authoritatively informed by the naval
general staff tonight, the battle was
begun by the troops on shore, who
opened fire on the Otchakoff which
was defiantly displaying the red flag-.
The commander of the Otchakoff,
Lieutenant Schmidt immediatlv accpt-
ed the challenge, repbiner with both
batteries, one trained on the town and
the other on the fort Alexander bat

and EIf. &iwe$ Unsatisfactory
E. V. MORGAN SUCCEEDS 1UM
It is Repot red tliat Mr. Squires Encour
ased the American Colonists on the
Isle of Pines Ills Attitude on the,'
Anslo-Cuban Treaty was Also Con
sidered Unreasonable by the Cubans.
Washington, November ). Edwin
V. Morgan just relieved from bis post
as Ameri- an minister at fceoui, Korva,
by reason of the establishment of the
Japanese protectorate there has been
appointed American minister to Ha
vana to succeed Herbert G. Squiers,
whose resignation has been received
and accfpted. Messrs. Morgan and
Squiers were both appointed to the di
plomatic service from New York, but
Mr. Squiers was born in Canada.
For a ing time past the relations
between Mr. Squiers and the Cuban
government have not been thoroughly
natisfaVtory to the state department
which regards it as essential to the
conduct of business between the two
governments that their respective min
isters shall be thoroughly acceptable
at their posts. It is said that in inter
terviews in the Havana Telegraph and
a leading New York newspaper, the
minister -offered much encouragement
to the American colonists on the Isle
of Pines and Americans at home who
had properly interests in the Isle. The
administration; had all along been ad
vising these people to submit them
selves to the Cuban government as
shown in Secretary Root's letter to
Mr. 'Raynard. The acceptance of Mr.
Squiers resignation, it is said, was in
evitable, for, "in the view of the state
department, it was a necessary step if
cordial relations were to be maintained
with the Cuban government.
Havana, November 20. It can be as
serted that the Cuban government
cab lex I a message of complaint to
Washington against Mr. Squiers atti
tude on the Isle of Pines question, fol
lowing his persistent opposition to the
Anglo-Cuban treaty, which the Cubans
have chosen to consider unreasonable.
On the receipt of Secretary Root's mes
sage with reference to the complaint,
Mr. Squiers immediately cabled his
resignation.
For some time there has been grow
ing a feeling of antagonism to Mr.
Squiers on the part of certain govern
ment officials. During the pendency
of the Rice -bill the Cuban government
officials criticised Mr. Sqiers for urging
the matter. The Anglo-Cuban treaty
would have been ratified on reaching
the senate but for Mr. Squiers' oppo
sition. The persistence of his opposi
tion to the treaty caused irritation to
President Palma and Secretary of
Stat O'Farrill.
When the Isle of Pines annexation
matter arosd recently and the govern
ment officials were stirred up Mr.
Squiers counselled a peaceful adjudi
cation no matter what happened. He
remarked to President Palma and Sec
retary O'Farrill that if the Americans
on the Isle of Pines really revolted
peace might be maintained -without
bloodshed by requesting the- United
States to station a small naval force
near the disputed territory until a
peaceful settlement was reached. This
suggestion was especially distasteful to
the Cuban president, especially after a
local American newspaper quoted Mr.
Squiers in a similar vein.

New York, November 23. Richard
A- McCurday today resigned as presi
dent of the Mutual Life Insurance
Company. His resignation was ac
cepted by the board of trustees, ana
Frederick Cromwell, treasurer of me
Mutual, was named as his temporary
successor. While no definite announce-!
ment was made regarding the selec
tion of a permanent successor for Mc
Curdy, it was persistently reported
that the presidency or the company
had been offered to James H. Eckels,
who was comptroller of the currency
during the administration of Presi
dent Cleveland. Mr. Eckels is now
president of the Commercial National
Bank of Chicago.
Mr. McCurdrs resignation was sub
mitted to the board of trustees In a
letter in which he declared that his
condition of health imperatively de
manded his immediate retirement Irom
active business. He had been dissuad
ed from severing his connection with
the company last June when he reach
ed the age of to years, "only by the
serious disturbance which previously
had arisen in insurance affairs.-' In
view of these conditions he believe 1
it his auty to remain at his post He
found, however that he over-estimated
his physical strength and it vrjs
upon advice of his physicians tha: he
tendered his resignation.
The resignation was accepted unani
mously and the trustees passed a
resolution in hich they expressed
hope that "much needed rest may af
ford the relief requsite for such re
covery as ma be hoped for at hJs
lme of Jfe and assure him or :ner
best v ! for his future comfort and
happiness."
The resignation of Justice Rufus W.
Peckham, of the United States su

tual, also was presented to the board
of trustees at today's meeting. The
resignation was accepted. Justice
Peckham had been a trustee of the

SITUATION VERY GRAVE.
The S trike of Telegraph Oierators
Shuts off the Russian Capital From
Communication With the Interior
The Strike Caused by Government
Circular Prohibit Ine Telegraph Ope
rators From .Toininsr a Union.
St. Petersburg, November 29. 12:10
p. m. The situation has again sud
denly grown exceedingly grave. The
Russian capital is shut off from tele
graphic comunication with the inte
rior. The pan-Russian strike of the
telegraph operators declared yesterday
has gone into operation and the work
men's council is deliberating whether
to declare a general political stride
throughout Russia tomorrow.
The telegrapn strike draws an im
penetrable curtyin between the capi
tal and the province which in such
a crisis renders the position of the
government almost desperate as being
in instant and constant touch with
the military and local authorities in
the interior is imperative. If the tel
egraph strike can be maintained the
government will be compelled to grope
blindly In the dark. Telephonic mes
sages from Mosow.which are momen
tarily expected to stop, say that the
operators on the Siberian lines and
on all the lines south, north and east
of Moscow have struck. The opera
tors on the lines throughout the Battle
provinces have Mso struck.
The telegraphers strike is the direct
outgrowth of the government's circular
prohibiting telegraph operators from
joining a union which prohibition is
attributed to M. Duniovc, Minister of
the Interior, for whose- removal from
office the radicals are vigorously work
ing . The minister recently summarily
discharged the leaders of the Moscow
union and yesterday their colleagues
sent a twelve-hour ultimatum to M.
Durnovo and Premier Witte demand
ing the reinstatement of the dismissed
men and the withdrawal of the obnox
j,.,.. . -( -'ffir.. So answer being forth
coming at the specified time, the strike
was declared. The telegraphers of
Moscow af.ter leaving their keys held
a meeting in an adjoining building and
upon the appearance of the police and
troops sent to break up the meeting
they declared firmly that they would
not disperse even if the authorities
used force.
