PRIDE AND SUCCESS
A common feeling toward pride is ex
pressed in the adage that it precedes a
fall It is looked upon as a stumbling
IiIorL and is seldom regarded as an as
set Certain bad forms of pride have
pit en personalities an unbecoming air and
hate brought into ill repute all the other
forms The value of true pride has not
been enough realised
Whether it be individual or racial
pride is essential to success Analjze the
superiority of the Aran race over other
races and racial esteem will be found at
the bottom of it It has been the unify
ing force which has led to greater effort
ti a higher culture and successful enter
prises It has meant a common interest
in the rare welfare and lias rculted in
an endeavor to better the racial standing
This pride is vividly expressed in the lo
all an individual has for his race Make
a slighting remark to an Arvan about his
race and he will likely start a fight but
rail a negro the worst of names and he
will probabl do nothing Sociologists
ay the black race needs a group con
siiousncss or a pride before it can reach
a higher culture t
A pride that would not stand tyranny
resulted finally in the establishment of
the great North American republic and a
great pride in the republic lias made it
the foremost nation of the world Pride
in militar achievement led Alexander
Cacar Pompej and Napoleon to succes
in arms This sort of success was not the
bet thing to aspire to but nevertheless
pride led to success The moment Rome
lost her self esteem she tottered and fell
Here is a case where lack of pride pre
ceded a falL
Self pride or self esteem is no more
than an honest appreciation of self It is
an indirect thanks to the Creator for ones
being Those who do not have this self
esteem are the men who Tap at the back
doer and ask for food A man must ap
preciate himself He must say to him
self I will make something of myself
to achieve success The moment a man
ceaes to respect himself his ascentup
the ladder of success stops and he likely
will slip downward Family pride has
received its share of criticism It ha
been scoffed at and called uppishness
Ssme forms of it ma be but in general
it i a possession much to be valued
Such a cautioning remark from father
to son as Remember jou are a Detwil
ler has often furnished the guidance
that has kept the young man from going
WTong
Haughtiness conceit and egotism are
bad forms of pride but because of them
the better forms should not be condemn
ed Personal pride is as essential to indi
vidual success as racial pride to a high
foim of civilization
RECLAMATION OF LAND
A hastening of the reclamation of
Western arid lands has been strongly ad
vocated b Secretary of the Interior Fall
in his annual report to the President
That such action would be a decided eco
nomic and industrial good is generally
frit
There are now about 200000000 acres
of unreserved public lands in the West
ljing idle suitable for nothing but graz
ing With the proper cultivation and
irrigalion this land could be changed
into a productive country Surely no
Letter time for improving this land could
be found than now when the general
tlBEts
lHi
gS yr ife
wve of unemployment leaves thousands
of men able and willing to work with
no regular work to do The government
could givemany of these men permanent
employment and thus bring about a dis
tinct industrial good
Then too the economic side of the
proposition is not to be ignored Geolo
gists have declared that there are great
stores ot wealth in these countries from
natural resources of coal oil and other
diposits The actual value of these has
been estimated 150000000000 and
the land would yield 12000000000 in
ro allies alone
Last of all uch a work would be a
great social service If this land were
made fit for cultivation large numbers
of World War veterans would be enabled
to secure homesteads and to build homes
in the West Our pension and general
land offices have been so inefficient that
little has been done to benefit these for
mer service men in anj wa Wc seem
to have forgotten the debt we owe them
and to be quite willing to let them shiri
for themelves now that we no longer
netd them to keep us in safe Sure
if this arid country could be changed into
an area of homes for our former soldiers
and their families that would be reward
enough in itself
In his message tn Congress President
Harding said Unreenedl I recom
mend the appropriation necessar to sup
pi the American Relief Administration
in Russia with 10000000 bushels of
corn and 1000000 bushels iif seed
grains Surely this is one means of
assuring friendliness and peace
THE FEDERAL BUDGET
The federal budget presented to Con-
1923 is the first compilation of its kind
ever made in this country The estimat
ed expenditure for that ear is 3505
754727 over two billion dullars less
than the amount spent in 1921 This
sum makes no allowance for a reduction
in the cost of armaments if the confer
ence succeeds
An agitation for a budget sstem in the
financial management and operation of
our government has been under wa sjjice
the administration of President Taft but
chiefly from political reasons has not
succeeded until now
The purpose of the budget explains
C G Dawes director of the budget is
to enable the President to present to
Congress an annual business program con
taining the necessar information con
ccrning the financial requirements of Jill
the departments of the government and
the resources from which this program
ma be met
The significance of such a system is
that it applies the methods of careful
business to government administration
The United Stales has long stood out as
a nation of business mn and money
makers Yet the fact remains that long
aOcr other enlightened countries liad
adopted budget s stems the United Stales
was still running its financial affairs in a
wa that would bankrupt an individual in
a short time The nation escaped bank
ruptc because of the nearly unlimited
resources of our countr
Since the war however our government
has realized that taxes are too high for
us to continue in this wasteful manner
So the President appointed a committee
under the direction of C G Dawes to
make a careful complication of proposed
expenditures for the coming ear The
results complete have been presented to
Congress and it only remains for that
bod to support the sstem in such a way
as to assure its success
MODERN MOTHER GOOSE
the siorv or a raindrop
Old Mr Gravity
The boy came to the window then and
together the two children looked at me
although of course they had jio idea that
the had ever seen me before Just then
the sun came out from under the clouds
and there was Miss Sunbeam dancing
down through the cold until she stood by
my side I was so happy I felt as if I
were glistening and mabe I was because
I heard theiboy say
Look at it sparkle It shines like
the snow on a Christmas tree And the
little girl clapped her hands and laughed
merril
This time I did not wait for Miss
Sunbeam to ask me to go back with her to
the Kingdom of the Clouds for although
it was quite interesting here on the
mountain with m friends it was much
nicer up in the sky and I wanted to go
back And then the most dreadful tiling
happened
I felt a hard rough hand take hold
of me andjerk me down from the win
dow to the ground away from Miss Sun
beam and awa from everything beauti
ful and pleasant I tried my best to get
Pacific Fortifications
The questions regarding the naval bases
and the fortifications of the Pacific is
lands belonging- to the United Slates
seems to be the only issue that is holding
un the Japanese assent 40 the 5-5-3 naval
ratio proposed by Secretary Hughes
The fears of the Japanese are based
not on the menace ofthe fortified islands
and naval bases in their presentcondition
but upon the greater danger lo Japan
should the fortifications be strengthened
in the future With the Hughes program
in effect the naval bases of the United
States in the Pacific are of little value
according lo American naval experts
America possesses several strategically
important islands in the Pacific Ocean
mostly unfortified The three important
fortified posts of the United States in the
Pacific are the Hawaiian Islands the
Phlippine Islands and the Island of
Guam The Hawaiian Islands are the
more favorabl located for defensive pur
poses
Ling midway between the western
coast of the United States and the Phil
ippines and on the sea route to the Far
East the Hawaiian Islands could be con
verted into a formidable defensive posi
tion but at the present time their for
tifications are limited
The Philippine Islands arc the most
distant fortified position of the United
States in the Pacific Ocean However if
the United States were to wage an of
fensive war against Japan the fortifica
tions at Cavile would have to De much
more effective than they are now
The island of Cuam is the third for
tified post of Americas in Far Eastern
awav from whatever it was that was hold
ing me but the harder I tried the deeper
I sank down At last I heard a deep voice
say lo me
There is no use for ou to resist-
ou are in the clutches of a monster who
has great power over the earth and all
that is in it No one dares to cross my
will ver often and when the do the
have lo pa for it
What is our name I gasped in ter

gress Monday for government expenses i 1 cau me ne answere
and with that gave me another hard nu
and plunged me into darkness Where
was 1 What was going to become of
mer Was 1 going to live there forever
These thoughts tormented me until I fi
nall got up enough courage to sa tim

Please Mr Cravit will ou tell
me where I am and where I am going
You are under the ground he re

ou are going further under the ground

mc that I just decided not to resist old

began to sink down down down until I
thought that surely I could Eoho further
Then I stopped aSuddenlyas Ibegan

If the cow that jumped over the moon
would get into communication with some
of the scientists who study the heav
ens it might be well worth her while
if he would tell just what the moon
looked like as she went over
She might become as famous as Mrs
0Lears cow that is alleged to have
kicked over a coal oil lamp in the family
barn and started the great Chicago
fire Indignant descendants of Mrs
OLeary have recently proved that Mrs
OLeary was sick in bed and didnt
take the lamp to the barn that night
but whether or not hers is a cow with
a reputation a burning reputation
Usually when cows get into poetry
they are called the lowing herd but
a man named Burgess ventured to use
the word cow in a poem with the
following result
I never saw a purple cow
I never hope to see one
But this Ill tell jou anhow
Id rather see than be one
Ordinarily people do not have a strong
affection for cows Once in a while
a bo or girl on the farm wont eat
an ot old Pied or old Red after
sue is butchered because she didnt
give enough milk an more because
they still have a feeling of companion
ship for the old cow they used to have
to go and hunt at milking time
Sometimes however there is someone
who really admires a cow for instance
the man who said
If I liad a cow that gave such milk
Id dress her in the finest silk
Id feed her on the choicest hay
Id milk her fort times a da
Of course though the Little Brown
Jug may be responsible for his
if he thought of the clothes
horse at the lime he could have sung
just as touching a by about it
In these times cows are registered
Just like automobile
licenses and
peo
ple stay up all night to milk them every
three hours just lo see how much milk
they will give
They have names such as Queen Bess
and Lady Rose but
they used to be
called Moo Cow Moos
