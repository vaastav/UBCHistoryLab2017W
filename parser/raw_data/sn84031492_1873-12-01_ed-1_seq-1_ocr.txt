Detailed Statement of Judge Treat’
Interference.
The controversy concerning tho Oilman, Clin

present time, in putting Mr. Hinckley (Judge
Tipton’s Receiver) in full possession of tho prop
erty. It is expected, however, that there will
bo some further proceodidgs before Judge Treat
at Springfield early this week. Mr. Crawford,
the attorney for Kolly and others, at whose suit
the Receiver was appointed, returned to this city
yesterday, and was called upon by a # reporter of
The Tiiibuke, la order to obtain from him amoro
definite statement of what had rotdly boon done
at Springfield during the last low days, tho tele
graph reports having boon more or loss inco

him is as follows:
: JUDGE TUEAT’S INTERFERENCE.
Friday f afternoon Mr. Hinckloy fllod tho sub
joined affidavit in tho Circuit Court of McLoaa
County:
Frauds E. Hinckley, upon kin oath, says that on the
morning of tho £Blh day of November, A. D. 1879,
about tho hour of 0 o'clock, ho, an Receiver ami under
tho direction of tho process of this Court, by hlmsolf
and agents, took actual and peaceable poseosaion of
tho bulldlug whore tho chief odices and doi>ot of the
Oilmau, Clinton & Sprlngdetd Railroad are located, in
Springfield, 111. ;.tbat tho chief telegraph office of said
railroad is also located la such building; that tho opotv
ator in charge of such telegraph olllco yielded your Re
ceiver full and peaceable possession of his telegraph
instrument and lino, and attorned to your Receiver;
that tho Janitor In charge of said depot building and
some of tho main ofllccs, delivered up to your Ro
edver tho keys of said building aud tbo keys
of tbo Auditor’s, tkkut-office, aud Paymaster’s
office, aud your Receiver went luto tho
ACTUAL AKD PKAOKAUMS TOSSESSIOX
of such telegraph department, ticke'.-offico, Auditor’s
and Paymaster's ofllccs without violence or objection
from any one.
That whilo your Receiver was in such possession
and had been for ova* hull or thrce-quartciia of an
hour, of Uio said otllcca and property, John ST. Palmer,
ouo of tbo Solicitors' of tho said railroad, cumo luto
tho unices and building where your Receiver was in
possession, and
DISPUTED TUB AUTHORITY

tho order of appointment of this affiant aud Richard
P. Morgan, Jr., aa Receiver*, which wm» duly certified
by tho Clerk, and scaled with tho seal of
tho Court, and tho said Palmer read tho
sazno fully, and thereafter wholly refused
to roco/mlzo tho authority or posscsslou of your
officer, although specially requested tied demanded so
to do. cud tho said Palmer did, than and there,‘notify
one O. M. Shepard, who is Superintendent of said rail
road company, and has been for one your last past, and
who cauio lu uuriug tho conversation, that your officer
had no right to tho posaotsiou of tho property of tho
qaid railroad company, or any of its books, papers,
vouchors, correspondence ; but, although your orator
exhibited bis authority to Bald Shepard. and did do*
znuud possession of any property of said railroad, or
any of Its books, papers, vouchors, or correspondence,
tbo said Shepard did deny the authority of your offi
cer, ami did, under tho aavmu of said Palmer, refuse
potuodMou of any such property in his po«iwslon, and
the said Palmer did then and liicra notify tho said
Shepard, who claimed to havo tjio property of said
railroad m his possession, that ho had tho lull authori
ty, and ought, if necessary, to use any force necessary
'to
DJZOX TOUR DECEIVKB
from lila possofalon and occupancy of said offices.
And lliu said Palmer ond Bbcpard did notify divers
of tbe clerics lu said olUco, including tbo telegraph
operators and others, who hud attorned to your odi
cor, not to longer obey your Receiver, imt to disobey
him, and refuse to recognize his occupauoy of the
property, and to obey the orders of said HUopard.
And the said Shepard claims to hold possession by
virtue of tho
following connKsroKonNGE,
copies of which he has furnished your Receiver, No.
1 of said letters was received by said Shepard about D
p. m, in the evening of Nov. 25, being bunded to Mr.
Shepard by Mr. John Mayo X’almor in tbo olUco of tho
latter in Springfield, lU.; that then said Shepard
wrote tbo letter marhed No. 3, and delivered It lu per
son to S. 11. Melvin, ami then, about noon of the 2Cib,

Is marked No. 3 ;
Then, about noon of tho 20tb, ho received from
Palmer k Palmer the communication marked No.
4, and then, about 8:30 p. m. of tbo SOtb, bo ro
eelved a telegram from IT. J, Jewett, a copy of which
lu marked No. 0 ; *
Tbe said Shepard was Superintendent of Bald rail
road on tbe 26th of November, 1873, and bad been for
more than a year, and bo states to your Receiver (but,
when bo received tbe letter No. 1, bo wao then
informed of tbo fact that a Receiver bad been appointed
for said railroad;
Tbo said Bbopard elated to your Receiver that be bad
nover received any communication or authority what
ever from Thomas A. Scott, and did not have any such
authority, to tako and bold possession of sold railroad
property;
Afterwards, about 0:80 a. m., your Receiver was,
without any previous notice, served with tbo annexed
INJUNCTION,
on a hill filed about 8:30 p. m. by John M, Palmer,
who appeared at the railroad offices when your Recoivor
was In possession, and assisted tho said Deputy Unit
ed States Marshal in making service of such injuno
tlou on your officer.
And afterwards, your Receiver demanded of S. H.
Melvin, George N, Black, and John M. Palmer pos
session of all books, papers, vouchers, correspondence,
and property of sold railroad company, but they wholly
failed and neglected to deliver over anything, allbough
they admitted tbo record book of tbo Company was In
tbe next room in tboir control, and wholly refused to
comply with tho order of tbo Court, except on a writ
ten demand, stating specificallywhich particular books
and property woro demanded, when they would de
liver them.
Your Receiver still maintains the occupancy snd
possession which he has acquired as aforesaid, andsub
uilta tho matter to the Court for its order and protec

I'OBSESSIOK GAINED,
■ Tho Circuit Court of McLean Comity (Judge

for Gov. Palmer and tho officers of thd road,
for contempt, aud, on motion' of Hr.
Crawford, . throe vrrlts of asßistonco
woro directed to tho Sheriffs of Snnga

Springfield, another for Clinton, whore tho shops
of tho Company are located, and tho third for
Gilman, tho northern terminus of tho road.
Those writs were taken to Springfield, and the
ono directed to tho Sheriff of Sangamon Comity
was served by him at half-past 0 o’clock Satur
day morning, ho ejecting all the employed of
tho Company and installing tho custodian of tho
Receiver, and notifying tho employes that ho

THE LATEST ADVICES.
Special Dievatchlo Tho Chicano Tribune.
Sprinufxeld, 111., Nov. 80.—The railroad war
is unchanged to-day. Tho Receiver is in pos
session of tho Bpringiiold olßoe, and claims to
bo in undisputed possession of the road,but this
is a technical question, and no amount of in
quiry can develop in whom the possession is at
this time. Of oourso the agents of tho bond
holders deny tho claim which tho Receiver sots
up, and this issuo will be decided next Tuesday.
Judge Treat yesterday warned tbo Receiver
and his party not to take any further stops
toward possessing themselves of tho road and us
property; but,notwithstanding this, Mr. Hiuck
loy sent Mr. brown, his agont, over tho road yea
day, who instructed all station agents that they
must, in order to rotaiu their places, acknowl
edge tho authority of Mr. Hinckley. Just how
far they did this is not known, but Mr. -Hinckley
intends to run the trains to-morrow. It is
stated that Mr. Hinckley is engaged upon a now
time-table for tho rood, which comprehends run
ning arrangements with other linesbf road than
those now in operation; It looks, therefore, as
though his possession is about complete.
Ex-Gov. Palmer, John Mayo Palmer, G. N.
Black, and 0. M. Shepard returned this morn-;
ing from Bloomington, having boon discharged
by Judge Tipton unconditionally, except in the
CH6O of Mr. Shepard, who was made to promise
not to interfere in any manner with tho Receiver,

tho means necessary for tho extraordinary work
could bo spared from tbo current appropriations
for tho support of tho navy. Tho wisdom of
this notion needs no illustration from him at
this time. Without it wo would have boon left
not only powerless to assert our owu rights, but
almost defenseless against - arrogance or ag
gression.
CONDITION OP THE STATIONS AND DETAILS.
Tbo Secretary says the 'naval force on tho
North Atlantic Station^was reduced iu tho
spring and summer*by ordering north as a
necessity some of the vessels which woro much
in need of repairs, and whoso crows needed a
change, having boon long iu tho tropics.
The expedition for tho survey of tho Darioa
and Inter-Oceanic Canal has completed its duties
and submitted its reports.
THE POLARIS.
-The Secretary, in speaking of tho Polaris,
says her cruise has boon decidedly tho most suc
cess fill of Avtio expeditious. The geographical
knowledge of tho Artie regions has Loco largely
advanced by it. A very particular questioning
of every ono of. tho officers and crow
of tho Polaris and of tho soiontillo
corps, except tho three persons yot
unoxamined, boa completely satisliod his asso
ciates and himself that Capt. Hall’s death occur
red from purely natural causes; that bis medi
cal treatment was judiciously adapted to his
case, and that ho was tenderly nursed and oaiod
for to tho last.
Tho evidence has also made it manifest that
Qnpt. Hall was always'faithful to the trust re
posed iu him in assigning him to the command
of the expedition; that ho was kind, linn, and
humane iu tho exorcise of his authority; that
ho was earnest in bis desire and in his attempts
to roach a high northern latitude, and. if prac
ticable. Polo itself; and that bis
untimely death was an irreparable
loss to tho exposition. It is also apparent that
Capt. Haddington, who succeeded to tho ohiof
command on the death of Capt. Hall, proved
himself to bo a good seaman, and that in oil
dangerous positions in which tho Polaris was
placed his conduct as tho commander was skill
ful and judicious—tho natural result of long ex
perience at sea and iu command iu Northern lat
itudes. ' ,v
BDCOSniENDATIONS OP THE BEOBETABY.
Tho Secretary renews tho recommendation
that the forces in our navy-yards bo increased and
developed so that we may bo prepared for all
emergencies; that tho old navy-yard at Phila
delphia bo abandoned, and now buildings oreotod
at League Island; that tbo New York yard bo
preserved in its present site, and that tbo Pen
sacola yard be, in a measure, rebuilt.
Tho Secretary earnestly recommends that
ample provision bo mado for tho support of tho
OrtWnco Bureau, in order that nothing may in
terfere with tbo efforts to supply our snips with
the most powerful guns.
Tho estimates
POU THE NEXT FISCAL YEAH
are $10,252,285, and to this is addod tho sum of
$801,530 for tho current repairs of buildings,
docks, and incidental expenses in the navy yards,
ote. Those estimates aro loss than those of last
year by rafchor more than $2,000,000, but thoy do
not include any extraordinary expenditure for
the permanent improvement of tho navy, nor
amounts necessary for tho repairs of onr iron
clad float, nor for tho continued prosecution of
somo of tho groat works necessary to a proper
condition of our naval establishment.
REFERENCE TO THE YIKOINIUS MATTER.
Since tho commoncomont of the present month
©vents havo taken place which make it proper
that tbo navy should bo put at ouco upon & foot
ing for active servioo. It is by no moans the
province of this Department, as snob, to take
part in the conduct or discussion of any diplo
matic question, nor should its attitude, at a tlmo
whoa serious international difficulties aro possi
ble, bo bold to indicate anything moro than a de
termination on tho part of a military depart
ment of. tho Government to bo prepared for ac
tion should tho necessity for notion arise. A
respectable forco of wor-vossols and moni
tors Is already ou tho sea and concentrating
at tho stations nearest tho scono of our
possible difficulties. Our whole available iron
clad fleet is on hand, and ovary wooden war-vos
sol that will float is in active preparation at the
various naval statioQS. Those will bo ready for
sea, fully fitted, as fast as proper crows can bo
provided for thorn. and, if tbo for ac
tion should como before tbo timo for it arrives,
all tboro Is of tbo American navy which can bo
put afloat on tbo Atlantic Ocean Trill bo In condi
tion and position to lake its proper part.
“Inadequate," says tbo Secretary, “as this
force may oo doomed to tbo responsibilities and
pretensions of a Government like ours, and
greatly at a disadvantage, as vro certainly shall
be in respect to the number and character of our
vessels in a contest with the fleets of any re*
spootablo naval power, 1 behove that tbo activity,
skill, science, and experience of our navy will
bo found equal to any difficulty which oourago
dare to moot or energy will avail to conquer."
TUB SECRETARY CONCLUDES
an follows: “In taking tbo action obove refer
red to, tbo Navy Department has already incurred
considerable expense, and has boon forood to
asuumo responsibilities unusual in times of
peace; but, convinced of tbo wisdom of prompt
and decided action, 1 have not shrunk from
those responsibilities, nor hesitated, with tbo
approval of tbo President, to make warlike prep
arations iu tbo interests of peace and humanity.
I ooufldoutly roly for support In this attitude
upon tbo patriotism and good sense of
tbo American pooplo and tbeir representa
tives, who cannot full to remember that onr
naval condition is tbo result of causes which
have been constantly pressed upon their consid
eration, but which have failed to receive full
attention,--doubtless on account of more press
ing present requirements and obligations,—and
who will clearly realize that duties constantly
postponed are certain to bo more difficult and
much more expensive when performed In haste
under tho pressure of imperious necessity. The
department has had no necessity to overstep
its appropriations, oven if it woro lawful to do
so, but the pressing demands of tho present will
consume now whnt was provided for tho service
of the year in sovoral of tho working bureaus.
These must bo promptly relieved, if their work
is to go on. Tho occasion has already shown,
1 thioK.tbnt our navy, us it exists, should at least
be put iu a condition for aotivn service ; and in
any event a moderate appropriation for
this purpose ought at onco to ho
made, oud, If war should by any
possibility come, wo must bo liberally pro
vided to;utilize moans wo bavo, and to provide
others to moot the emergency.
TWO POLITICAL RINGS.
Tweed Arrayed in Striped Clothing
and Placed in a Felon's Cell.
Approaching Judgment of Genet, Nor
ton, and Other Ring-Masters.
Charges Against District-Attor
ney Britton, of Brooklyn. ‘
/Vr»ia f* * nltp -»<o\ 'a 7*Ti <7Afi i/> flii n.
New York, Not. 00.— Tho city has hardly re
covered from its aotonlubmont at tbo conviction
and imprisonment of Tweed. The whole result
of tbo trial was only aeon yesterday in hla incar
ceration In a common jail of tho county, clothed
la stripes, and sot at hard labor among the low
est class of criminals. ' This is so marvelous a
denouement that people still wonder. Some of
this morning’s local papers, in describing his
transfer to Blackwell's Island, begin the account
in a brutal manner, which everybody condemns,
and which has tho effect of exciting some little
sympathy for tbo old man.
Everywhere his conviction Is looked upon as
an assurance that tbo prosecution of the whole
gang of ring thieves will bo conducted in tho
same vigorous manner. Ingorsoll and Farring
ton will go to prison to-morrow.
THE TBIAIi OF GENET,
who is Senator-elect, begins to-morrow, and
probably will be concluded in two days. Tho
evidence against him is very complete, and in.
volvos his Incarceration for two or throe crimes,
including forgery. It was feared that Judge
Ingraham would sit at Oyer and Terminer, be
fore which tbo case will bo tried, bat ho has
been intimidated by tho positive expressions of
public opinion which havo boon heard lately,
and will not hear tbo case. Judge Davis will
conduct court in his stead. Two years ago
Ingraham was shown to h&vo been very much
mixed up in various frauds connected with the
administration of justice, such as the appoint
ment of his relatives to receiverships, etc., and
no one baa any confidence in him.
OTHER TRIALS.
Tbo Genet trial will bo followed by that of
Cowan, and then that of Hiobaol Norton, an
other Senator. Norton has just been declared
bankrupt, and, ooDßoqneutly, his defense will bo
as weak pecuniarily os it is in fact.
THE BROOKLYN MANAGERS IN TROUBLE.
Tho trial of District Attorney Britton, of
Brooklyn, begins to-morrow. It will ho ono of
tho most important impeachments over tried in
this country, os Britton Is tho only protection
loft to tho ring in Brooklyn, and saves many of
its members from indictment. His late desper
ate attempts to save himself and his friends havo
been mado tho subject of additional charges,
specifying that, to secure the indictment
of a political opponent, ho introduced into tho
Grand-Jury room' a man whom ho know to bo an
unpardonod convict. It turns out that ho had
dsfendod tho follow years ago when convicted,
and mode a promise to him that if ho would tes
tify ho would secure hla pardon; and, although
tho man indicted is an active member,of the
Eiuty to which tho Attorney-General and Gov.
lx belong, tho former was deceived into rocoom
mouding, and tho latlor to granting, tho pardon.
Britton is also charged with falsifying tho
court records, and committing perjury In order
to secure tho confinement of Shanks, city editor
of tho Tribune, for contempt of court. This
charge Is made by Shanks; and Henry L. Cleve
land and 0. A. Buuklo, Tribune attorneys, are to
make an argument In' the matter, before tho
Governor, to-morrow. A petition by tho Deform
Committee, asking for tho suspension of Britton
during tho trial, recites othor serious offenses.
Britton's friends have approached the complain
ants with various offers to discontinue the suits,
hut iu vain.
[TV) the Associated Prut, 1
New York, Nov. 80. —After being taken to
Blackwell's Islaud yesterday, Tweed was asked
the usual questions by the recording dork, to
which ho answered that ho was aged 62, occupa
tion a*• statesman," no religion; but,as bis fam
ily are Protestants, ho was entered as Protest
ant. He was taken to tho bath, then bad his
head shaved, beard token off, and was arrayed in
full striped uniform. He had two letters from
Now York City physicians, recommending that
ho bo placed in the hospital, but, after an exami
nation by tbo Penitentiary physicians; ho was
remanded to a common coil, like all other felons.
Tho jacket given him to wear Is known at the
Peuitentlary os a “larceny jacket." His son
stayed by him till he was led away to his cell,
when he and his friends aud the reporter loft
the island.

WASHINGTON ADVICES.
Special Dispatch to The Chicago Tribune.
Washington, Nov. 80.—Quito a number of tbo
loading Administration Senators wore in confer
ence with tho President to-day. Tbo object of
tho conference is said to bavo been a general
consultation on matters of policy which will re
ceive attention in tbo President's message, es
pecially tho Spanish complications. Tho
situation with regard to tho latter
romaius qnlot and unchanged up to this time.
There has been no reason why tho vigilance of
the Government should bo relaxed, ana our olU
cials are therefore constantly on the alert. Tho
President's message will doubtless contain strong
recommendations with regard to
THE CONDITION OF THE NAVY.
setting forth tbo necessity of keeping it at ad
times in a state of oUloionoy, so that emergencies
like the present will find us in a condition for
immediate service. To placo us in tho position
that'wo ought to occupy, it will bo necessary to
construct quite a large number of first-class
ships of war at no inconsiderable expense. For
some years past' wo bavo not had a navy large
enough to represent us at many of tho naval
stations of tho world whoro tho first-class pow
ers have kept a squadron. This has had a
tendency to lower tho respect of othor
nations lor the United States, while it has not
increased tho pride of American citizens abroad.
It is. understood that tho President has had
those facts in mind in drawing up his message,
and that ho will sob forth tho necessity for a
change in tho policy wo have pursued since tho
war in strong terms.
BRITISH SUBJECTS SHOT.
New York, Nov. 30.— Tho Loudon Telegraph
says that the Acting British Consul-General at

ca and others, sixteen British subjects, forming
§ art of tho crev*»of tho Virgimus, wore shot at
outiago.
LONDON PRESS COMMENT.
' London, Doc. I.—G a.ra.—The Daily Telegraph
says it would bo premature to regard the Vir
ginias difflcultyas approaching termination, until
tire actual language used by President Grant on
tho subject, in his message to Congress, is
