MESSAGE OF

Mr. Taft Champions the Anti
trust Statute.
KEW REMEDIES SUGGESTED.
Not Repsal or Amendment, but Sup
plemental Legislation Needed The
Tobacco Trust Decision an Effective
One Federal Incorporation Recom
mended and a Federal Corporation
Commission Proposed The Teet of
"Reasonableness"
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives: This message Is the first of several
which I shall send to congress during
the interval between the opening of
lis regular session and Its adjourn
ment for the Christmas holidays. The
amount of Information to be commu
nlcated as to the operations of the
government, the number of Important
subjects calling for comment by the
executive and the transmission to con
gress of exhaustive reports of special
commissions make It Impossible to In
elude In one message of a reasonable
length a discussion of the topics that
ountit to he brought to the attention
of the national legislature at Its first
regular session.
The Anti -trust Law The
Court Decisions.
Supreme
In Mar last the supreme court hand
ed down decisions In the suits In equi
ty brought by the Lulled States to en
Jopi the further mi'lnlemince of the
Standard Oil trust nnd of the Ameri
can Tobacco trust and to secure their
dissolution. The decisions are epoch
ro-.Uing nnd serve to advise the busi
ness world nuthorltatlvely of the
m-i-pe nnd operation of the anti-trust
act of 1SII0. The decisions do not de
part in nuy substantial way from the
previous decisions of the court In con
struing and applying this important
statute, but they clarify those deci
sions by further defining the already
admitted exceptions to the literal con
struction of the net. Ity the decrees
they f'liiiis-h a useful precedent as to
the proper method of dealing with the
cnnltnl mid property of Illegal trusts.
These decisions suggest the need and
wisdom of additional or supplemental
legislation to make It easier for the
entire business community to square
with the rule of action and legality
thus finally established and to pre
serve the benelll. freedom nnd spur of
reasonable competition without loss of
real elTi' leney or progress.
No Chango In the Rule of Decision,
Merely In Its Form of Expression.
The statute in Its first section 'de
clares to be Illegal "every contract,
combination lu the form of trust or
otherwlv or conspiracy In restraint
of trade or commerce among the sev
eral -Xf.'vti i.i' with foreign nations"
anil In the so 'end declares guilty of a
i::I dome n- r every person who shal!
iimnopnMw or attempt (o monopolize
or combine or conspire with any other
IH- voi) to monopolize any part of tho
trade or commerce of the several states
or with foreign nations."
In two early cases, where the statute
was hvuked to enjoin a transporta
tion rate' agreement between inter
state railroad companies, it was hold
that it was no defense to siiow that
the agreement as to rates complained
of was reasonable at common law. be
cause It was said that tho statute was
directed against all contracts nnd com
binations in restraint of trade, whether
reasonable at common law or not. It
was plain from the record, however,
that the contracts complained of In
those eases would not have been deem
ed reasonable at common law. In sub
Bcpi -ut cases the court said that the
Mutine should be given a reasonable
construction nnd refused to Include
within Its inhibition certain contrac
tual restraints of trado which It de
nominated as Incidental or ns Indirect.
These cases of rest rant of trade that
the court excepted from the operation
of the statute were instances which
at common law would have been call
cl reasonable. In the Standard Oil
nnd tobacco cases, therefore, the court
laerely adopted the tests of the eoin
luoti law nnd In defining exceptions to
the literal application of the statute
un!v substituted for the test of being
in -Mental or indirect that of being
reasonable, nnd this without varying
J'l I lie slightest the actual scope and
effect of the statute. In other words,
nil the cases under the statute which
have now been decided would have
leivi decided the same way If the
nnrt had originally accepted In its
construction the rule nt common law.
It has been said thnt the court by In
troducing into the construction of the
s'nt common law distinctions hns
emasculated It. This Is obviously un
true. Ity Its Judgment every contract
end "omblnntlon in restraint of Inter
I ite trade made with the purpose or
neiessa-v effect of controlling prices
bv sfli"ri'j competition or of establish
ing in whole or In part a monopoly of
such trade Is condemned by tho stat
ute. The most extreme critics cannot
Instance a case that ought to be con
demned under the statute which Is hot
brought within Its terms ns thus cou
nt -nod.
The suggestion Is also made thnt t!ie
wrtreme court hv Its decision la the
last two cases has committed to the
court the undefined and unlimited dis
cretion to determine whether a case of
rc.-t;a;i!' of trade Is within the terms
of the tatute. This U wholly untrue,
A reasonable restraint of trade at com'
mon law is well understood and is
clearly defined. It does not rest In the
discretion of the court. It must be
limited to accomplish the purpose of a
lawful main contract to which In order
that it shall be enforceable at all It
must be Incidental. If it exceed the
needs of that contract It Is void.
The test of reasonableness was never
applied by the court at comman law
to contracts or combinations or con
spiracies in restraint of trade whose
purpose was or whose necessary effect
would be to stifle competition, to con
trol prices or establish monopolies.
The courts never assumed power to
ay that such contracts or combina
tions or conspiracies might be lawful
if the parties to them were only mod
erate in the use of the power thus se
cured and did not exact from the pub
lic too greut and exorbitant prices. It
Is true that many theorists and others
engaged In business violating the stat
ute have hoped that some such line
could be drawn by courts, but no court
of authority has ever attempted It.
Certainly there Is nothing lu the deci
sions of the latest two cases from
which such u dangerous theory of Ju
dlclal discretion in enforcing this stat
ute can derive the slightest sanction.
Force and Effectiveness of Statute
Matter of Growth.
We have been twenty -one years mak
ing this statute effective for the pur
poses for which it was enucted. The
Knight ense wus discouraging nnd
seemed to remit to the states the whole
available power to attack and suppress
the evils of the trusts. Slowly, howev
er, the error of that Judgment was cor
rected, and only in the last three or
four years lias the heavy hand of the
law been laid upon the great illegal
combinations that have exercised such
an absolute dominion over many of our
industries. Criminal prosecutions have
been brought, and a number are pend
lug, but juries have felt averse to con
victing for Jail sentences nnd Judges
have been most reluctant to Impose
such sentences on men of respectnble
standing in society whose offense has
been regarded as merely statutory.
Still, as the offense becomes better un
derstood and the committing of it par
takes more of studied and deliberate
defiance of the law we can be conll
dent that Juries will convict individu
als nnd thnt Jail sentences will be im
posed. The Remedy In Equity by Dissolution,
In the Standard Oil case the supreme
and circuit c(irts found the combina
tion to be a monopoly of the interstate
business of refining, transporting and
marketing petroleum nnd Its products.
effected and maintnltied through thirty-seven
different corporations, the
stock of which was hold bv a New Jer
sey company. It In effect commanded
the dissolution of this combination, di
rected the transfer nnd pro rata distri
bution by the Xew Jersey company of
the stock hold by it In the thirty-seven
corporations to nnd among its stock
holders, and the corporations and indi
vidual defendants were enjoined from
conspiring or combining to restore
such monopoly, and nil agreements be
tween the subsidiary corporations tend
ing to produce or bring about further
violations of the act were enjoined.
In the tobacco case the court found
that the individual defendants, tweu-ty-nino
lu number, laid been engaged
u u successful effort to acquire com
plete dominion over the nianufacture.
sale nnd distribution of tobacco In this
country and abroad and that tills had
been done by combinations made with
a purpose nnd effect to stifle competi
tion, control prices nnd establish a
monopoly, not only in the nianufacture
of tobacco, but also of tin foil nud lic
orice used in its manufacture and of
its products of cigars, cigarettes nnd
snuffs. The tobacco suit presented a
fur morn complicated and difficult case
than tho Standard Oil suit for a decree
which would effectuate the will of the
court and end the violation of the stat
ute. There wns here no single hold
ing company, as In the case of the
Standard Oil trust. The main company
was the American Tobacco company,
a manufacturing, selling nnd holding
company. The plan adopted to de
stroy the combination and restore com
petition Involved the mlivlsion of the
capital and plants of the whole trust
between some of the companies con
stituting the trust mid new companies
organized for the purposes of the de
cree and made parties to it and num
bering, new and old. fourteen.
Situation After Readjustment.
The American Tobacco company
(old), readjusted capital $02.(0.000:
the Liggett & Meyers Tobacco company
(new), capital $;7.i)uo.oim; the P. I.orll
lard company mewi. capital S47.0VO,
000. nnd the It. J. Reynolds Tobacco
company (eldi, capital ST.oi.'.'i.Oim, are
chiefly engaged in the manufacture
and sale of chewing and smoking to
bacco nnd cigars. The former one tin
foil company Is divided Into two, one
of SSlWOOO capital nnd the other of
JtOO.ttOO. The one snuff company Is
divided Into three companies, one with
a capital of Ji.'.ooo.txx). nmv'.ior with n
capital of $$.000,000 and a third with
a capital of $S,O0O.00O. The licorice
companies are two, one with a capital
rf $.".7.VS.3(iO nnd anothr with a capi
tal of $2,000,000. Th're Is nlso the
nrltish-Amerlcnn To'acco company, a
ltrltish corporation, doing business
abroad with a capital of fV.,OiXl,000,
the Porto Itlctm Tobacco company,
with a capital of $l.Kti.00o. and the
corporation of I'nlted Cigar Stores.
with a capital of $).ooo.o0o.
I'nder this arrangement each of the
different kinds of business will be dls
trlbuted between two or more compa
nies with a division of the prominent
brands in the same tobacco products,
so as to make competition not onlv
possible, but necessary. Thus tho
smoking tobacco business of the coun
try Is divide so that the prseut in
dependent companies have 21.39 pet
cent, while the Amerirnn Tobacco com
pany will have 33.08 per cent, the Lig
gett & Meyers 20.03 per cent, the Lorll
lard company 22. W per cent and the
Reynolds company 200 per cent. The
stock of the other thirteen companies.
both preferred nnd common, has been
taken from the defendant American
Tobacco company aud bas been dis
tributed anions ir stockholders. All
covenants restrict i ng competition have
been declared null und further per
formance of them bas been eujoined.
The preferred stock of the different
companies hiu now been given voting
power which was Ceuied it under the
old organization. The rutio of the pre
ferred stock tu Ihe common was us 7S
to 40. This constitutes u very decided
change in the character of the owner
ship and control of each company.
In the original suit there were twenty-nine
defendants), who were churged
with being the conspirators through
whom the illegal combination acquired
and exercised Its unlawful dominion
Under tho decree these defendants will
hold amounts uf stuck in the various
distributee companies ranging from '41
per cent as a minimum to 'JS',, per
cent as a minimum, except In the case
of one small company, the Porto Itlcan
Tobacco company. In which the' will
hold 45 per cent. The twenty-nine in
dividual defendant.- are enjoined for
three years from buying any stock ex cept
from each other, uad the group is
thus prevented from extending its con
trol during that period. All parties to
the suit und the new companies who
are made parties are enjoined perpet
ually from in any wny effecting any
combination between any of the com
panies In violation tof the statute by
way of resumption of the old trust.
Each of the fourteen companies Is en
Joined from acquiring stock in any of
the others. All these companies ore
enjoined from having common direc
tors or officers, or common buvincr or
soiling agents, or common offices, or
lending money to each other.
Size of New Companies.
Objection was made by certain in
dependent tobacco companies thnt this
settlement wns unjust because it left
companies with very large capital in
active business and that the settle
ment thnt would he effective to put nil
on an equality would be a division of
the capital nud plant of the trust into
small fractious In aaiount more near
ly equal to thnt of each of the Inde
pendent companies. This contention
results from a misunderstanding of
the nntl-trust law and its purpose. It
is not intended thereby to prevent the
accumulation of large capital in busi
ness enterprises In which such a com
bination can secure reduced cost of
production, snle nnd distribution. It
Is directed against such an aggrega
tlon of capital only when its purpose
Is that of stifling competition, enhanc
ing or controlling prices and estnblish
ing a monopoly. If we shall hnve by
the decree defeated these purposes
nnd restored competition between the
large units Into whHi the capital nnd
plant have been divided we shall have
accomplished the useful purpose of
the statute.
Confiscation Not the Purpose of the
Statute.
It Is not the purpose of the statute
to confiscate t lie property nnd cnpital
of the offending trusts. Methods of
punishment by fine or imprisonment
of the individual offenders, by fine of
the corporation or by forfeiture of its
goods in transportation nre provided,
but the proceeding In equity Is n spe
cific remedy to slap the operation of
the trust by Injunction nnd prevent
uie future use of the plitnt und capital
in violation or the statute.
Effectiveness of Decree,
t venture to say that not In the his
tory of American law lias a decree
more effective for such a purpose been
entered by a court than that against
fi,.. . . .
oMim-t-o irosr. as tircult Judge
Noyes said in his Judgment unnrovlni?
uie decree:
"The extent to which it has beeu
necessary to tear apart this combina
tion nnd force it Into new forms with
the attendant burdens miKht to demon
strate that the federalanti-trust statute
Is a drastic statute which accomplishes
effective results, which so long ns It
stnuds on the statute books must be
obeyed nnd which cannot be disobey
ed without incurring fur reaching pen
alties. And, on the other hand, the
successful reconstruction of this or
ganization should teach thnt the effect
of enforcing this statute Is not to de
stroy, but to reconstruct; not to de
molish, but to recreate in accordance
with the conditions which the congress
hns declared shall exist among the
people of the I'nlted Slates."
Comrron Stock Ownership.
It has been assumed that the pres
ent pro rata and common ownership in
nil these companies by former stock
holders of the trust would Insure a
continuance of the same old single con
trol of nil the companies into which
the trust lias by decree been disinte
grated. This is erroneous and is based
upon the assumed inefflcacy and inuoc
uousness of Judicial Injunctions. The
companies are enjoined from co-opera-
non or combination; they have differ
int managers, directors, purchnsinc
f.nd sales agents. If all or many of
the numerous stockholders, reacbine
Into the thousands, attempt to secure
concerted action of the companies with
a view to the coutrol of the market
their number is so large that such an
attempt could not well be concealed,
and Its prime movers and all Its partic
ipants would be at once subject to con
tempt proceedings and imprisonment
of a summary character. The immedi
ate result of the present situation will
necessarily be activity by all the com
panies under different managers, and
then competition must follow or there
will be activity by one company and
stagnation by another. Only a short
time will inevitably lead to a change
In ownership of the stock, as all op-
port unity for continued co-operation
must disappear. Those critics who
speak of this disintegration in the trust
as mere change of garments have not
given consideration to the Inevitable
working of the decree and understand
little the personal danger of attempt
ing to evade or set at naught the sol
emn Injunction of a court whose object
is made plain by the decree and whose
inhibitions are set forth with a detail
and comprehensiveness unexampled in
the history of equity Jurisprudence.
Voluntary Reorganizations of Other
Trusts at Hand.
Toe effect of these two decisions has
led to decrees dissolving the comblna
tlon of manufacturers of electric
lamps, a southern wholesale grocers'
association, aa interlocutory decree
against the powder trust, with direc
tions by tho circuit court compelling
dissolution, nnd other combinations of
a similar history are now negotiating
with the department of justice looking
to a disintegration by deree and re
organization in accordance with law
It seems possible to bring about these
reorganizations without general busl
ness disturbance
Movement For Repeal of the Anti
trust Law.
But now that the anti-trust act is
seen to be effective for the accomplish
ment of the purpose of its enactment
we are met by a cry from many differ
ent quarters for its repeal. It Is said
to be obstructive of business progress,
to be un attempt to restore old fash
loued methods of destructive competl
tlon between small units and to make
Impossible those useful combinations
of capital nnd the reduction of the cost
of production that are essential to con
tinued prosperity and uormnl growth.
In the recent decisions the supreme
court makes clear that there is noth
lng In the statute which condemns
combinations of capital or mere big
ness of plant organized to secure econ
omy In production and n reduction of
Its cost. It is only when the purpose
or necessary effect of the organization
and maintenance of the combination
or the aggregation of Immense size are
the stifling of competition, actual nud
potential, and the enhancing of prices
aud establishing a monopoly that the
statute is violated Mere size Is no
sin against the law. The merging of
two or more business plants necessari
ly eliminates competition between the
units thus combined, but this elimina
tlon is in contravention of the statute
only when the combination Is made for
purpose of ending this particular com
petition lu order to secure control of
and enhance prices und create a mo
nopoly. Lack of Definiteneta In the Statute.
The complaint is made of the stat
ute that it is not sufficiently definite
In its description of that which is for
bidden to enable business men to avoid
Its violation. The suggestion is that
we may have a combination of two
corporations which may run on for
years nud thnt subsequently the at
torney general mny conclude thnt It
was a violation of the statute and that
which was supposed by the combiners
to be innocent then turns out to be a
combination lu violation of the statute.
The answer to this hypothetical case
is thnt when men attempt to amass
such stupendous capital ns will enable
them to suppress competition, control
prices nnd establish a monopoly they
know the purpose of their nets. Men
do not dOvsnch n thing without hnving
It clearly In mind. If wlmt they do Is
merely for the purpose of reducing the
cost of production, without the thought
of suppressing competition by use of the
bigness of the plant they nre creating,
then they cannot be convicted nt the
time the union is made, nor can they
be convicted later unless It happen
thnt later on they conclude to sup
press competition and take the usual
methods for doing so and thus estab
lish for themselves a monopoly. They
can in such a case hardly complain if
the motive which subsequently is dis
closed is attributed by the court to the
orlglunl combination.
New Remedies Suggested.
Much is said of the repeal of this
statute aud of constructive legislation
intended to accomplish the purpose
aud blaze a clear path for honest mer
chants and business men to follow., It
may be that such n plan will be
evolved, but I submit that the dlscus
slous which have been brought out In
recent days by the fear of the con
tinued execution of the anti trust law
have produced nothing but glittering
generalities und have offered no Hue
of distinction or rule of action ns defi
nite and ns clear as that which the su
preme court Itself lays down In en
forcing the statute.
Supplemental Legislation Needed, Not
Repeal or Amendment.
I see no objection, and Indeed I can
see decided advantages. In the enact
ment of n law which shall describe
and denounce methods of competition
which nre unfair and are badges of the
unlawful purpose denounced In the
anti-trust law. The .attempt nnd pur
pose to suppress a competitor by un
derselling hint at a price so unprofita
ble as to drive him out of business or
'e making of exclusive contracts wiUi
customers under which thev are re
quired to give up association with oth
er manufacturer and numerous kin
dred methods for stifling competition
and effecting monopoly should be de
scribed with sufficient accuracy in a
crlmlnnl statute on the one hand to
enable the government to shorten Its
task by prosecuting single mlsdemean
rs instead of an entire conspiracy and
on the other hand to serve the purpose
of pointing out more In detail to
the business community what must be
avoided.
Federal Incorporation Recommended.
T n ,
- "i""-"" i njusresw on
Jan. 7, 1910. I ventured to point out
the disturbance to business that would
probably attend the dissolution of these
offending trusts. I said:
"But such an Investigation and pos
sible prosecution of corporations whose
prosperity or destruction affects the
comfort not only of stockholders, but
of millions of wage earners, employees
and associated tradesmen, must neces
sarily tend to disturb the confidence
of the business community, to dry up
the now flowing sources of cnpital
from Its places of hoarding and pro
duce a halt In our present prosperity
that will cause suffering and strained
circumstances ninong the Innocent
many for the faults of the gollty few
The question which I wish in this
message to bring clearly to the con
sideration and discussion of congress
is whether, in order to avoid such n
possible business danger, something
cannot be done by which these busl
ness combinations may lie offered a
means, without greut financial dls
turbance. of changing (he ebarncter.
organization nnd extent of their busi
ness Into one wltblu the lines of the
law under federal control und super
vision, securing rompllunce with the
nntl-trust statute.
"Generally in the Industrial combina
tions called 'trusts' Ihe principal busl
ness is the sale of goods lu many states
and In foreign markets in other words,
the interstate and foreign business far
exceeds the business done In nny one
state. This fact will Justify the fed
eral government in granting a federal
charter to such a combination to make
and sell In Interstate and foreign com
merce the products of useful munufnc
turn under such limitations as will se
cure a compliance with the unti-trust
law. It Is possible so to frame a stat
ute that, while it offers protection to a
federal company against harmful, vex
atlous and unnecessary Invasion by the
states, it shall subject It to reasons
ble taxation and control by the states
witli respect to Its purely local busl
ness.
"Corporations orgauized under this
act Should be prohibited from ncqulr
lug and holding stock lu other corpo'
rations (except for special reasons,
upon approval by the proper federal
authority), thus nvolding the creation
under national niisplces of the holding
company with subordinate corporations
In different states, which , has been
such un effective agency in the cren
tlon of the great trusts and monopo
lies.
"If the prohibition of the anti-trust
act against combinations In restraint
of trade Is to be effectively enforced
It Is essential that the national govern
ment shall provide for the creation of
national corporations to carry on a le
gltlmate business throughout the Unit
ed States. Tho conflicting laws of the
different states of the Union with re
spect to foreign corporations make it
difficult, if not Impossible, for one cor
poration to comply with their require
ments so as to carry on business in a
number of different states."
I renew the recommendation of the
enactment of a general law providing
for the voluntary formation of cor
porations to engage in trade and com
merce nmong the states and with for
elgn nations. Every argument which
wus then advanced for such a law and
every explanation which wns nt that
time offered to possible objections hns
been confirmed by our experience since
the enforcement of the anti-trust stut
ute has resulted in the actual dissolu
tion of active commercial organiza
tions.
It Is even more manifest now than
it wns then that the denunciation of
conspiracies In restraint of trade
should not nnd does not mean the de
ninl or organizations large enough to
be intrusted with our Interstate and
foreign trade. It has been made more
clear now than it was then that a
purely negative statute like the anti
trust law may well be supplemented
by specific provisions for the building
up aud regulation of legitimate na
tional and foreign commerce.
Government Administrative Experts
Needed to Aid Courts In Trust
Dissolutions.
The drafting of the decrees In the
dissolution of the present trusts, with
a view to their reorganization into le
gitimate corporations,, has made It es
pecially apparent that the courts are
not provided with the administrative
machinery to make the necessary in
quiries preparatory to reorganization
or to pursue such inquiries, and they
should be empowered to Invoke the
aid of the bureau of corporations in
determining the sultnble reorganiza
tion of the disintegrated parts. The
circuit court nnd the attorney general
were greatly aided In framing the de
cree in the tobacco trust dissolution by
an expert from the bureau of corpora-
tlons.
Federal Corporation Commission Pro
posed. I do not set forth in detail the term
and sections of a statute which might
supply the constructive legislation per
mitting and aiding the formation of
combinations of cnpital Into federal
corporations. They should be subject
to rigid rules as to their organization
and procedure. Including effective pub
licity, nnd to the closest supervision as
l the Issue of stock aud lionds by an
executive bureau or commission in the
department of commerce and labor, to
which In tines of dmiht they might
well submit llieir proposed plans for
future business. It must be distinctly
understood that incorporation under a
federal law could not exempt the com
pany thus formed and Its incorporators
and-managers from prosecution under
the anti-trust law for subsequent Il
legal conduct, but the publicity of Its
procedure and the opportunity for fre-
qnent consultation with the bureau or
commission in charge of the Incorpora
tion as to th lpiritlrrmto
'4VCTT7 vi Jin
transactions would offer it as great se-
curlty against successfrl proaecutioM
for violations of the law ns would be
practical or wise.
Such a bureau or commlssicu might
well be invested also with the duty
already referred to of aiding courts
In the dissolution and recreation of
trusts within the law. It should be an
executive tribunal oi the dignity and
power of the comptroller of the cur
rency or the lnterstnte commerce com
mission, which now exercises supervis
ory power over important classes of
sorporations under federal regulation.
The drafting of such a federal in
corporation law would offer ample op
portunity to preveut mnny manifest
evils in corporate management today,
including irresponsibility of control in
the bands of the few who are not the
real owners
Incorporation Voluntary.
I recommend that the federal char
ters thus to be granted shall be volun
tary, at least until experience justifies
mandatory provisions The benefit to
be derived from the operation of great
businesses under the protection of such
a charter would attract all who are
anxious to keep within the lines of the
law. Other large combinations that
fall to take advantage of the federal
Incorporation will not hnve a right to
complain if their failure Is ascribed to
unwillingness to submit their transac
tions to the careful official scrutiny
competent supervision nnd publicity
atteuduut iiikiii the enjoyment of such
a charter.
Only Supplemental Legislation Needed
The opportunity thus suggested for
federal incorporation, it seems to me,
is suitable constructive legislation
needed to facilitate the squaring of
great Industrial enterprises to the rule
of action luld down by the anti-trust
law. This statute as coustrued by the
supreme court must continue to be the
line of distinction for legitimate bus!
ness. It must be enforced unless we
are to banish individualism from nil
business und reduce it to one common
system of regulation or control of
prices like that which now prevails
with respect to public utilities and
which when applied to- all business
would be n long step toward state so
cialism Importance of the Anti-trust Act.
The nntl-trust act Is the expression
of the effort of a freedom loving peo
ple to preserve equality of opportunity.
It Is the result of the confident deter
mination of such a pejplc to maintain
their future growth by preserving un
controlled and unrestricted the enter
prise of tlio individual, his industry.
Ills Ingenult , his Intelligence and his
independent rountge
I-'or twen'i. 'years or more this stat
ute has !- i upon the statute book.
All knew lt: general purpose and ap
proved Many of its violators were
cynical over Its assumed Impotence.
It seemed impossible of enforcement.
Slowly the mills of the courts ground,
and only gradually did the majesty of
the law assert Itself. Mnny of Its
stntesmen-nuthors died before It be
en me a living force, and they nnd oth
ers saw the evil grow which they had
hoped to destroy. Now Its efficacy Is
seen; now its power Is heavy; now Its
object Is near achievement. N'ow we
hear tho call for its repeal on the plea
that It Interferes with business pros
perity, nnd we nre advised In most
general terms how by some other stat
ute and In some other way the evil
we are Just stamping out can be cured
If we only nbandon tills work of twen
ty years and try another experiment
for nnother term of years.
It is said thnt the not has not done
good. Can this be said lu the face of
the effect of the Northern Securities
