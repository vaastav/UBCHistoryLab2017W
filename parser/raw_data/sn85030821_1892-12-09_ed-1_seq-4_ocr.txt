Chump Turkey.
St. Louis, Mo., Dee. 1. There is not
anywhere in The United States a club
house owned entirely by commercial
travelers and devoted to their uses, but
there will be one as soon as the hand
some building now being planned by
architects, for the Travelers' Protec
tive association, Is erected in St. Louis.
It will cost half a million dollars, and
will be the swellest place of the sort
outside of London, both as to its ex
terior appearance and its appoint
ments lnsido. One novelty in the ar
rangements of the club which has
been proposed is to be a cab service.
The club is to own its cabs, and they
are not only to be at trains for use of
members, but fliey are also to bo at
the beck and call of any of them who
may want to drive about the city.
The rapidly flowing wator of the
Mississippi river lias swept away the
theorists who began when the cholera
scare ran over tho conntuy this year to
exhort tho peoplo to drink only water
that had been boiled. At that time,
of course, St. Louis took all sorts of
sanitary precautions, which, by the
way, are still in effective operation,
and among them warned those who
lived In the tenement districts not to
use well water. Everybody then re
sorted to hydrants. About this time
aroso the cry of the medical men who
insisted that all running water must
be boiled If the drinker would prevent
tho coming of cholera, typhoid fewer
and other dlsngreeuble visitors of that
kind. Everyone knows how difficult
it is in a household to boll all the
water that is used by a family, and
careful folks sighed as they went
about the new duty thus laid on them.
Fortunately, about this time, a party
of microseopists from the Smith
sonian institute visited St. Louis.
They wcro examing the water supply
of all the largo cities. Thoy found
that tho river water used iu St. LouIb
was not only pure but wholesomo, and
thoy promptly announced that, add
ing that it was better than that of any
other largo city where they had been.
Tho St. Louis Medical society wuntcd
to be sure that tho Eastern scientists
wore right, and appointed a commit
tco of miscroscopists from its own
members to examine tho miter. The
examination was made this week, and
the 3oneluHion reached was tho, same
as that uu flounced by the tSmithsoniun
instituto men. Tho housekeepers are
overjoyed, and the troublesome water
boiling in tho kitchens all day long
has ceased.
" Hero is a bit of information for tho
house-keepers thut will make thorn all
want to live In St. Louis. Turkey on
Thanksgiving Day sold in tho markets
hero for IS cents a pound, and fresh
venison for 20 cent.'-; and there was
much moro of both Ui mis of tho meat
than could be Bold, judging from tho
appearance of tho stands late that
night. Not only on Thanksgiving Day,
but all tho year round, house-keepers
in other parts of tho country have good
reasons to envy their sisters here. St,
Louis is in tho center of enormous nat
ural gamo and fish preserves. The
hunting aud llsliiug clubs of tho city
are numbered by hundrods. During
the eight months of tho year, fish Is
abundant on the market stalls
at insignificant prlcos, and for
tho other four months, gamo is
really cheaper than good beef. The
mochunio hero lives us well as tho pro
fessional man of moderate circum
stances in New York, Boston or Chi
cago. A comparison of housekeepers'
figures would show that the cost of
living is 25 per cent choapor hero than
in either of those cities.

How the Wall Street Wlxsard Obtained tb
Wyandotte and Northwestern,
Kansas City, Ma, Dec. 5. Superin
tendent C. F. Brotherton of the Kan
sas City, Wyandotte and Northwestern
says the death of Jay Gould will not
affect the transfer of the road. It is
now practically ownJd by the Gould
interest, although the fonmal transfer
has not yet been madp. The history
of this transaction is well
known. Goald was forced into
taking the road seemingly against
his will. In 18!'0- he contracted
to boy from the Northwestern con
struction company, which built the
road, about 8G50.000 worth of the con
struction company's bonds. Of this
amount $150,000 was turned over to
him. The remaining $300,000 were
offered to him, but lie refused to take
them on the ground that they had
been mutilated. The construction com
pany, however, claimed that Gould
knew this when he mado the contract
and it brought suit to compel him to
fulfill his contract The attorneys
garnisbeed the Missouri Pacific and
Union Pacific roads and made them
parties to the suit This plan bade
fair to show up all of Gould's Inter
ests in these two roads and make tho
whole thing public. Gould's attorneys
asked for extensions of timo in which
to make answer for the two roads sev
eral times pending an attempt at a set
tlement of the suit. The uttorneys
for the construction company insisted
on Gould taking the bonds, and finally
he did so rather than have his Mis
souri Pacific and Union Pacific hold
ings made public.
The State Ilank Matter.
Washington. Dee. 5. Tho state
bank plank in tho Democratic plat
form is likely to be the causo of a
good deal more trouble than was an
ticipated by the convention which
adopted it Talks with a num
ber of Democratic representatives
show that a great difference exists
on this question. Many Democrats
from the East and Wostare absolutely
opposed to doing anything whatever
with reference to stato banks, while
many representatives voicing the de
mands of their constituents for a
larger currency insist that the
plank in the Democratic plat
form shall bo given practical
effect Keprcscntative Livingston of
Georgia said to-day thut he was in
favor of keeping this and every other
pledge given to the people. Ihepeo-
pie, h
Sties,

anu the party that did not keep
