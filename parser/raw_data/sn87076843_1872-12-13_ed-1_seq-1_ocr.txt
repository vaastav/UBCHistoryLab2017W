Tho National Democratic Committee have
issued the following:
Headquarters or the National Dkmochatic I
I'ommittbk, new York, Dec. 8. t
Tbe Democratic National Convention did. in Ju
ly, 187S, with nn unanimity unprecedented In the
history of the party, nominate as their candidate
for the office of President of the I'nltcd States,
Horace Greeley, of New York. Six Stales cast
their Rlectoral votes for him at the lato election.
and millions of men In other States where we
failed of snrcess testified their appreciation of his
nol'lc character, and the great service he had ren
dered the country, by voting our Electoral ticket.
But Horace Greeley is dead, and the splendor of
the political victory achieved by his opponents is
now diminished by the sorrow which this sad event
has cast npon the people whom he loved, and who
regarded him as one of the best, truest and bravest
of men.
The lessons of bis pure and blameless life will
long remain lmprossed upon the age in which he
lived. Every beat of his great heart was in sym-
fiathy with humanity In Its broadest form. Ho
oved tho Government, he loved his fellow-men,
and the labors of his whole life were to elevate
tho condition of mankind. No struggle for lib
erty, civil or religious, was ever mado on the sur
face of tho earth, since his manhood began, with
which he did not affectionately sympathize, or to
which he failed to give faithful and powerful aid.
Everv dav of his lite abounded with acts of kind
ness, of charity, of forgiveness, and of love. Not
his stricken family alone, but a stricken people,
sorrow for a loss wholly inscrutable and almost
unparalleled Tho National Democratic Commit
tee, In bebalf of the groat party who achieved
honor bv their faithful effort to elect him to tho
first office In the Government, will do all In their
power to honor his name and memory.

Received vonrs of 35th Instant. I have all mv
life been doing w hat people called vastly foolish
and impolitic acts, and I do not dispute their Judg

the right thing. If I should die before election or
be beaten therein, please testify for me that I do
not regret having braved public opinion when I
thought It wrong and knew it to be merciless.

They did this after being officially informed
by the Governor that, on a canvass of tha

Mr. Greeley's daughters have stated that
they will not accept the proposed endow
ment fund started for their benefit, as they
need no personal aid, but suggest, indirect
ly, that the money bo used for a statue to
their father's memory, in which case, they
will themselves contribute toward It.
On the morning of the 5th, Governer War
moth, of Louisiana, issued a proclamation
enforcing the report of the returning officers
appointed by him to canvass the votes cast
at the recent election. By their returns the
vote stood Republican, 60,233; Democratic,
68,100. In the Eighth District Ceurt, in tho
case of the "Custom Honso Returning Board
vi. the Governor's Returning Board," it was
decided by Judge Durell that a largo number
of voters had been illegally deprived of tbe
franchise, and that ten thousand votes
which would have been cast for the
complainant were about to be suppressed by
an illegal board. The Court therefore pro
hibited Governor Warmoth from exercising
any authority over the returns or papers of
the recent election, and restraining him from
granting any certificates of election whatev

The Funeral of Mr. Greeley.
NEW YORK, December 4.
Tint interior of the Church of tho Di
vine Paternity, where Mr. Greeley's obse
quies were held, presented a sombre and
beautiful appearance. Outsitle of tbe
church were throngs waiting in respect
ful silence. Police stood in front of the
church as a guard. The church was
opened at about lialf-past ten, although
Indies had previously been admitted and
filled tho galleries. During the hour
which elapsed before the arrival of the
procession, a strain ol music was dis
coursed by the choir.
Among tho nrst celebrities to STive
were Oovernor Uotitnan and President
Grant. Koscoe-Conkline soon after enter
ed, and immediately following him were
Henry Wilson, Minister Wahburno, and
Secretary Belknap, who sat at the right
of the pulpit. There were also General
Schurz, Lvmun Trumbull, and Vice-Pres
ident (Joltax, who took a Beat near the
President. The crowds outside extended
as far as the eye could reach, on either
side on Fifth avenue, awaiting the arrival
of the procession. At eleven o'clock the
ErocesHion started from Mr. bincmtr s
ouee, on Forty -fifth street. Many affect
ing scenes took place there during the
morning. Mr. Greeley's daughters were
inconsolable in their grief. The corpse
was borne by ton men; next came the
chief mourners, then the Wbune Associ
ation, and next the Herald Club. Follow
ing the eorpse, the mourners, and tbe
Tribune and Herald Associations, came in
succession the military and civil officers,
according to the programme.
The church had been appropriately
decorated. Over the door in front hung
a flag draped up with black. In the vesti
bule was a portrait of Greeley with crape
around the lramo. The screen behind
the pulpit was covered with black cloth.
hanging in graceful folds and relieved by
festoons, while from the top of it depend
ed graceful strings of smilax. Tho mil-
pit itself and rail in front were gracefully
draped. Drapery ran around the front
of the galleries, and from bracket to
bracket along the side walls. Lengths of
sergo drooped Irom tbe center of the
ceiling to the spring of each arch, twined
about columns, and hung from the pinna
cles of the organ. The clock, stopped
at ten minutes before 7, the hour of Gree
ley's death, was surrounded with black,
and above it, in a green wreath, was a
wnite cross of llowers. The pew Mr.
Greeley used to occupy, about midway of
toe nonn aisie, next the wan, was draped
with crape. The figure in flowers of a
lyre with broken strings, hung at the
head. The seat was thickly strewn with
white flowers, camellias being placed in
the spot which Greeley himself used to
occupy. This pew will be left empty for
inmy days. T he most remarkable decor
ationa of tbe church, however, were the
flowers. There was a boaumul appro
priateness and personal significance in
many of the devices which surrounded
bis bier. At the back or the pulpit, un
der tbe words: " It is done," with which
bis great life closed, was a wreath of rip
ened wheat, a fit emblem of the rich har
vest the keen sickle of Death had so late
ly reaped. Below this was a shield of
white flowers, with the arms of the State
of New York in purple blossoms, the gift
of the Common Council. Still below the
last, an ax and a pen were arranged in
the form of a cross. A magnificent arch
of white flowers, presented by the ladies
of Dr. Chapin's congregation, spanned
the pulpit over tho speaker's head. On
its white ground waa wrought in crimson
blossoms the legend " I Know that My
Redeemer Liveth." Indeed, these words
and the "It is done," were refloated
aguin and again in decorations, In all
sorts of devices.
At the right of tbe pulpit stood another
gift from the Common Council, a large
stand, of which the whole top waa com
posed of the choicest flowers, rosebuds
and camellias, and tuberoses, surmount
ed by a crown wrought from the saute
lovely blossoms. A similar stand and
crowD was the gift of Mayor Uall, and
anither came from the Lincoln Clnb.
Tie Lotos, tho Union. League, and tho
1 1 nil 1 clubs wcro represented by ap
pnprittte oll'erlngs. From tho German
Gceley and Brown Club came an Im
mense quill, wrought la tho choicest
(lovers. One of the most remarkable of
tin tributes was a plow composed of
conellins and white roses, with a ground
vork of tlolets and oilier modest bios
sims. This beautiful design was tbe gift
d tho 1'ribune employes. Among the
post conspicuous ofl'crings was a mng
litlccnt floral tablet, three and a half feet
ride, standing about six feet from tho
ioor, and prcxenting the appearance of a
ilcture, supported by columns, of which
he frame consisted of violets and tea
Dsebuds, The ground of tho tablet was
iirmed of choicest white flowcis, lrr
snribed at tho top with the words, "I
now that my Redeemer llvolli." On the
rverse were the letters "II. G.," and the
notto, "In memoriam." The inscrip
tons were in red flowers. This tablet
tbs presented by the "Tribune Associa
tion." About tho coffin itself were ar
singed gifts of the choicest kind from
sersonal friends. The air was full of the
sweet breath of flowers. They were
tiick under tbe foot which trod so rever-
tntly as they bore him away. They filled
(very avallablo space wltn their beauty.
. Among the significant embloms dis
mayed at tbe funeral was a simple wreath
f dry loaves, with violets intertwined.

rfip!V. with a hrinf nrnrpaaion of sym
pathy. The Misses Greeley with their
own hands bound tbe wreath about the
cofiin of their father, as from one who to
the last had bis confidence and love.
Thnrlow Weed was a pall-bearer, at Ws
own request. Dudley S. Gregory, also a
pau-oearer, was tho man who loaned Mr.
Greeley the thousand dollars with which
te started tbe Trwune.
At twenty minutes past eleven o'clock
the procession entered tho church. Tho
solemnity of the scene was most impres
sive. The stillness was sucn tnat it seem
ej as though the people in the church
scarcely breathed. Prominent among
those who slowly wound their way up
the central aisle were Thurlow ced,
William M. Evarts, Mayor Hall, with the
present Postmaster-General creswell,
General Dix. ex-Governor Morgan, Gun
eral Sheridan, Governor Randolph, of

from tho Scriptures. Miss Clara Louise
Kellogg next sane, very touchingly.
Know that Mv Redeemer Liveth," after
which Ilcnrv Ward Beecher delivered
the funeral oration, speaking substantially
as foilows:
When men have filled the household of
God with their profencc. It Is not surprising
that we miss tliem, when they leave us for
ever, anrl vet thev arc nnnstuntlv. like In tiie
present case, going from us, and others are
neing called upon by means or neavcniy tm
pnlse to take their places In the great cause
of God's troth. The occasion, my friends, Is
a solemn and sublime one, and we forget the
strife and contest of the world, that strife
that separated us politically In the
aliairs of the nation: and I loin In this meet
lng to weep over the remains of him who Is
now in our presenco, soon to be taken from
us, but whose memory shall live forever in
the annals of his country. Who is this man
whom we are here to-day to commemorate?
For thirty years he has tilled, the land with
the greatest controversy. He was a man of
war, and yet he died without civic honors, a
private citizen. And vet we honor him, one
and nil. The President of the United States
and bin officers are here, and bow in silence
to the will of God in taking from us our
great brother. A little time ago, nnd we
were in the midst of a fierce battle, with tbe
great dead tbe leader of one side, and yet he
now lies lifeless before as. It is because the
man was something more than a professional
man so good and noble that ho bad few
compeers. It is for these reasons that we
assemble here to mourn tho loss of Horace
Gree.lev.
For thirty years he Duilt tor himself no
outward monument, no estate; but here to
day, between the oceans, there is not a man
who has not felt the effects of tbe labors of
Horace Greeley. What matters it that, ia the
conflict over political economy, he should
bo npon one side and you on another f I
say it is enough that he has given his life
blood for tbe good and to tbe purposes of
nobler manhood. To-day we are all speak
ing kindly and sorrowfully for him. Think
of those conflicts In which vou forgot hu
manity, out of which vou have come, and
summon your charity now, you that have
been battling on the other side. After a
long and tempestuous voyage, be has
reached shore, and angels will welcome him
to their outstretched arms. Let us hope
that; when we die, angels will open the
gates for us to the glory of the Lord.
After the address of Mr. Beecher,
which continued but a few moments,
"Bleep the Last Sleep" was rendered in
a beautiful manner by a quartette from
St. Francis Xavier's Church.
The Rev. K. II. Chapin thon spoke as
follows :
One month ago, many who are now pres
ent met in this place to express our sympa
thy with one who eat with pallid face and
quivering lips, a heart-stricken mourner
over his wife. To day, as in tbe freshnesa
of his quiet sorrow himself, he is to lie by
her side. The shadow of death through
which he was thon passing haa enveloped
him. Such is Providence, that checks all
Unman operations, and makes life a contin
ual surprise. I cannot attempt here to now
nnfold the life or estimate the worth of
Horace Greeley. Such an attempt would on
one band be premature, and on the other
unnecessary. Premature because the traits
and lessons of a great life can but be
reviewed when the grief and excitement
have ceased. This work ought to be done,
and I trust will be done, in the utterance of
some public memorial service, which will
demand and receive a much wider bearing
than 1 can give it. To speak of Horace
Greeley 'a worth Is unnecessary; It has al
ready been done. There have been bnt few
Instances in our history where expressions
of regret and regard have been so spontane
ous, so universal, and so similar. These
eulogies that pour in so thick and fast from
every part of the land are not made up of
ai Uncial rhetoric. Tney are genuine. The
tears are as freely shed to-day, by country fire
sides' and in distant cities, as beneath the
shadowing drapery of this house, from
which he Is soon to go out forever. They
ropresent no Invisible sympathy, but repre
sent the people's thought, and are twined
about the people's heart, bearing witness to
a career of honest purpose. And why
this reverential regard for the mem
ory of Mr. Greeley 1 It Is not for
his mere Intellectual ability, large and unde
niable as It was. It was not because be was
an high official, for Horace Greeley held no
official station. The will of the people ex
pressed through the Electoral College to
day decides that he should hold no such sta
tion. To-day the will of God elects him to a
place from winch an human onea loon smalt
and dim. Why Is It. thenf It Is the mag
netism of simple goodness. Mr. Greeley's
heart was as large' as his brain. His love for
humanity was inherent. He touched all sides
of humanity, so to speak. The hundreds of
poor toll-worn men, who pressed through
the crowd to take a last look at that worn
countenance, were moved by no mere curi
osity. They came there not to gaze npon
the face of the great Journalist or politician,
but because be bad always been the poor
man sinena, the sympathetic companion oi
the workingmen, who bud struggled through
their experience and never forgot
their claims, au bis public acts were di
rected by the same impulses, and it enlisted
him in the service of very many causes. Not
only did it Inspire his life-long war with op
presslon, vice, and wickedness of every kind,
but it made him unspeakably generous. Per
haps he erred on the side of mercy against
Justice, but If a man must err at all that is a
good side to err on. Whatever may bave
been the mistakes of him who lies dead be
fore us, there was no mistake in the main
current of the principles which characterized
his life, and therein is a lesson for us also.
How faltbfullv he did bis work aud led
his life, it is supcrdaous for me to say. It
waa an eminently practical one. What
various Interests of art. of labor, of eduva
tion, of temperance, of domestic policy, of
freedom, go mourning . for him to-day
Wielding the mighty power of tbe mightiest
engine of the times, placed In the editorial
chair that he was, It is no light thing to say
that however strongly some may think that
severely he used his pen as an Instrument of
his thoughts and principles, he never de
based it as a stimulus of Impurity, or made
It the Vehicle of a single social wrong.
While Horace Greeley bad made many an
tagonists, he had few, if any, enemies. And
may I not, without violating any of tlio pro
prieties of this occasion, express my satisfac
tion that, while political differences lay
scaled Within these enclosed lids, the high
est representative of tho nation to-dny here
bows bis head In honor of the thinker, the
worker, the patriot, and man.
(Attempted applause, which wad sup
pressed.)
Tho address was followed by enrnost
prayer, and nnother hymn, "Angels Ever
Bright and Fair."
The ltev. Mr. unapin men pronounced
tho benediction, and the choir sung a
most beautiful and touching chant, "O,
what is lifcf" after which the procession
moved down Fifth avenue, the police
having previously cleared the roadway
Irom curb to euro.
No music was in the line. Tbe proces
sion, as it slowly moved down the avenue,
presented a magnificently Imposing ap
pearance. The doorsteps of nil the houses along
the avenue, without exception, were
thickly crowded. The windows nnd
balconies were full, and the hotels, club
houses, and public buildings of all kinds
presented a Bca of human faces. The
gathering was greater than the multitude
wblch welcomed the oraud uuke Alexis,
or watched the funeral of Abraham Lin
coln. From Dr. Chapin's Church to
Madison Square, a distance of just a mile,
the avenue was nearly blockaded. On
the outer edge of the sidewalk the crowd
was huddled' two and three deep, and on
the walk within there was barely room to
pass. In Madison Square and on the
spaco before the Fifth Avenue Hotel, the
concourse was still greater.
All alone Broadway, from Fourteenth
street, through which the procession
moved, to Hamilton Ferry, there was
dense msBs of people. About Bowling
Green, tho Battery, and the ferry-house,
the crowd stood patiently waiting.
On the Brooklyn side, the same scenes
were repeated. Along Union street to
Fourth avenue, and down the avenue to
the cemetery, stretched the wonderful
double lines of watchers. At Greenwood
there was a still more surprising sight.
Here an enormous concourse- had gainer
ed, standing about the entrance gates,
and fringing the winding roads, and con
centrating about the open grave, so that
the mourners, when they arrived, bad the
greatest difficulty in following tho hearse.
About one hundred and twenty car
rlnges followed the remains to Green
wood. The body was deposited in Mr,
Greeley's lot. There were no ceremonies
of any kind further than , laying tbe body
in us lost resting place.
The Nitro-Glycerine Explosion at
Yonkers, N. Y.
Yesterday at noon BOO pounds of
nitro glycerine exploded near the line of
the new l orK oc Boston itatiroad, in
lonkcrs, killing George Hill, aged twen
tv-oue. and Michael Gallagher, aeed six
teen; mortally wounding John Donnolly,
aged nineteen, and seriously Injuring
Wm. Terry, aged twenty-one. Tho Now
York & Boston Railroad is to pass about
three miles east of the (Jity of lonkers,
and one mile west ol Uronxvllle. lilast
iog bas been going on in that vicinity of
late, and as a great amount ot this work
is necessarv. nitro-rrlvoerine has been do-
posited at different points for use when
wanted, l esterday Hill, Uullaeher, Don
nolly and Terry, while out gunning, found
five cans containing one hundred pounds
each. A pit about four feet- deep bad
been dug, and the cans placed in tho ex
cavation. A strong fence had been built
around it, and on all sides were placards
bearing the words, "Danger," "Beware,"
'JN it ro-Gl vcerine. "
The boys walked around the fence Cora
mcnting upon the improbability of dan
ger from such harmless looking cans, and
lull proposed that as it was Evacuation
Day they should create some fun by
smashing the cans. The others readily
consented, and all four clambered to tho
top of a large rock about fifty fect above
the glycerine, and, rolling a stone weigh
ing about fifty pounds to tbe edge of the
rock, Hill and Gallagher proposed to
tumble it Lito tho pit. Terry said the
darned thing micht strike fire and blow
the stuff up. Hill laughingly said, "Let
her blow; we'll have some fun anyway.'
lerrv seized Donnolly by the arm, and
running away about two hundred feet.
they hid behind a large tree, at tbe same
time jeered by Hill and Gallagher. Hill
then ro'led the stone down. It struck the
cans, and the explosion which followed
waa heard and felt for ten miles around
Trees, stones, and great chunks of earth
were hurled in every direction. The
rock where Mill and Gallagher stood
weighing hundreds of tons, was blown in-
to fragments. The ground was torn up
hundreds of feet around. A first class
earthquake could not have created great
er havoc. Every pane of glass in houses
for miles around was shattered, and the
inmates were terrified. The explosion
was beard in White rinins, Tarrytown
Tremout, Washington Heights, and even
over in JNew Jersey.
Workmen from the railroad hurried to
the scene, well knowing what had hap-
pened. They found Terry and Donnolly
with their clothing stripped from their
bodies, lying about two hundred feet from
the scene of the explosion, groaning in
agony. Donnolly's bedy was badly lac
eratcd. 11 is legs and one arm were bro
ken, his body was black and blue, and
one eye was gone, lie was mortally
wounded. Terry was the least hurt and
will probably recover. He is the only
one loft to give an account oi the nllair.
When the smoke had cleared away
search was made for Hill and Gallagher,
Hill's body was blown to atoms. His en
trails were suspended from the limbs of
tree 500 feet away. Other parts of the
bodies were scattered for hundreds of feet
around. Only a Bmall part of bis remains,
however, had been found last night. Gal
lagher's body was not blown into so many
particles as Hill's. His legs were found
severed from his body, which was strip
ped perfectly nude. Even bis boots bad
been torn to atoms and scattered among
the debri. The body, minus the arms
and head, lay about fifty feet from the
legs. The scalp and face, without the
skull, were found In another place The
arms were shattered, and only portions
were found. The skull is still missing.
Captain Mangin, of the Yonkers police,
was soon on the spot, and took charge of
the wounded men. They were taken to
St. John's Riverside hospital. Donnolly
is insensible and will not recover. Terry
was too badly Injured to give a full and
detailed account of tbe explosion last
night.
The excitement in Yonkers, and in fact
throughout the entire neighborhood, was
terrific. All sorts of conjectures were
advanced as to the explosion. Some in
listed that Hell Gate bad been broken up,
while others thought there had been an
earthquake. The superstitious full on
their knees in prayer. Tho irreverent
trembled with fear, but everybody anx
iously Inquired what the matter waa.
One old lady In the suburbs of Bronx
vUlo was in bur yard when a pieco of the
fcucewith the work "Danger" fell at
her fect, and she fainted on the cpot.
All four of the boys lived on what is
called Hug Hill, within tbe city limits of
Yonkers. They were of the poorer class,
and worked at odd lobs in oukers. jV.

The Chief Cause of Crime.
[From the Chicago Evening Post.]
Titm Committee of Five, consisting of
Dr. N. 8. Davis, Rev. Arthur Mitchell, J.
O. Brayman, II. W. Thomns, and O. I).
Itelmer. nrnolntcd at tho public meeting
held September !ib to report on the causes
or crime, have completed incir iiiora.
The result is embodied in a report made
to the Committee of Fifteen, of which re
port liberal extracts are subjoined :
"A clear annrccintion of those causes
that nredisnose to. or favor tbe commis
sion of crimes, is oi great importance iu
the welfare and prosperity of any commu-
ty. Reasonable security to nio, ncaitn
and property, is essoutml alike to public
order and individual banniness. The fre-
ouencv with which crimes have been
mmmitted. and cuticciallv those involv
ing personal violence, during the laBt few
years, has justly awaKenea inc intention
t all classes oi tiie community, i ne rcai
causes of crime are uivisinie into two
classes, viz. : those that predispose to, or
prepare tho way, by inducing sucn a men
tal development or condition as is capa
bio of being incited to criminal acts; uu
llioao which, acting on such mental pro-
disposition, more directly induce the
commission or crime, ineiirsi may oo
termed predinponing and the second exciting
causes. TO mo Iirst DOiong neiiieci. uu
errors in tho training or education of
children: the reading ot an ooscene, im
moral and imaginative literature;
neglect to inculcate and enforce
obedience and respect for existing
laws, both In the family circle and
the community at large; and especially
the tolerance oi open ana constant viola
tions of law by larger classes of the com
munity. To the second, or class of di
rect exciting causes, belong all those so
cial customs bv which numbers of indi
viduals are brought together at late hours
of the night or on the sabbatn, witnout
anv accompanying moral restraint, and
the use of such drinks as have the power
to influence human passions and diminish
the controlling influence ot reason ano
conscience. Of all the customs oi a so
cial character favoring the assembling of
men at unseasonable hours, and beyond
the restraining influences of either the
family circlo or tho church, which has
tipcnme almost universal, is that of keep
ing liouor saloons open a large part of
tbe niisht and all the Sabbath, thus afford
ing a convenient rendevous aliKo ior tne
unwary laborer after his hours of toil, the
idle, the victims of a vicious appetite, the
ignorant, and the designedly vicious. If
il wcro conceded tnat aicoiiouc onnKs
nie legitimate articles of trade and com
merce", there can be no good reason why
those who traffic in them should not con
form to the samo customs as regulate all
other traffics, nnd close their places of
business at a suitable hour in tne even
ing, and keep them closed on the day
recognized as the Sabbath.
"A ricld and careful examination will
show that, if these places, were simply
closed at the times ludlcated, inereoy oe
nrivine the bad elements of the commu
nity of a convenient place of meeting, it
alone would diminish tbe number of
crimes in any given community nearly
1W per cent, uui, oi an me uirect exist
ing causes of crime, alcoholic drinks, by
their power to excite the passions and
impair the control of reason and con
science, stand out pre eminent and all-im-
fiortant. This will appear more distinct
y by the presentation of a few well authen-
ucaicu Htatisucm tacts.
" More than twentv-fivc years since,
gentleman of talent and reliable character,
visited all the nrisens. iails. and noor-
houses in the State of New York, and pcr-
sonally examined the inmates, and, as fa;
o nra tlclilo aar-prt&inpii th rnimpa
as praciicaoie, ascertained ine causes o
llm AFimna nnmimllaH hv fliA nnmnfra
the crimes committed by the prisoners,
and of the causes which had led to the
poverty of the paupers. The results were
published, giving the number of prisoners
and paupers in cacn county in tne state.
To allude to these figures in detail would
be unnecessarily tedious. It is
sufficient to 'say that they showed
four fifths of tho criminals to have
been brought to the commission of their
criminal acts by the use of alcoholic
drinks; and that three fourths of the pau
pers were made such directly or indirect
ly by the same agents. Tbe results thus
obtained in New York a quarter of a cen
tury neo have been luliy confirmed by
tbe examination of the jails and prisons,
as well as of the records of the Criminal
Courts, made since, either in this or other
civilized countries. Thus, within the
lost three years, Dr. Elisha Hnrris, than
whom a more caretui and rename no
server cannot be found, after an official
inspection of several of the prisons in
New York, stated that eighty per cent,
all the criminals he had found bad been
mado such by tho use of intoxicating
drinks." If we pass from the jails and
prisons to the police stations, Bridewells
and Houses of Correction, we shall find
the results pointing in the same direc
tion."
The report proceeds to quote many par
ticular facts, showing that nine tenths
the crime committed in- tho world
caused by drunkenness. A careful exam
ination of a list of about one hundred
murders and manslaughters committed
in this city and county during the last
seven years, shows that at least ninety
out of the one hundred resulted from the
influence of alcoholic liquors.
The report proceeds: "8o we might
multiply facts in relation to evory species
of crime drawn from tbe police and ju
dicial records of every civilized country;
but the sameness of this recital would
only weary the reader, without imparting
additional force to the conclusions."
"There is, however, another aspect
this which statistical comparisons will
show results so fully corroborative of the
foregoing that we will briefly indicate it.
By careful comparison of tho amount
liquor consumed in different States
counties relative to the population
shown by revenue and census returns,
with the number of police and criminal
arrests in the same States, as shown
tbe police and court records, it is found
that the latter bold a remarkably close di
rect ratio to the former, and that in some
States and municipalities, where the con
sumption of alcoholic drinks varies, one
vear from another, tho numoer ana mag
nitude of crime varies in the same ratio."
This view is supported by abundant
examples, among them the example
Vtneiand. Wow Jersey, where enure pro
hibition of the traffic In intoxicating
drinks haa been enforced from the beam
ning. The result is an almost absolute
absence of pauperism and crime. The
entire police force of the city consists
one civil constaDie, ana ine expense
the public only 75 a year, or about
to every 1,000 Inhabitants. In Chicago
it costs $2,000 a year to each 1.000 inhab
itants, and crime of all grades is constant,
even with this large expenditure.
The report closes as follows: "If
want a local fact go and live in Evanston
a month, and then inBridgeport, and
will soon discover the difference between
prohibition aud license in tbe matter
producing crime, i neiacts nere produc
ed, or those of a similar nature, might
extended almost Indefinitely; but enough

COAST SURVEY.
The operations of the Coast Survey, as well as
those of the Light Ilouse Hoard, appear to have
been economically and efficiently managed.
THE REVENUE MARINE.
consists of 87 steam and 6 sailing vessels, carrying
4. guns, and manned bv 1!H officers and 0 men.
This service has constantly Improved in efficiency
and In the economy of Its management since tho

enue marine haa been reduced from tl,Sii3,ll.7
la 1H08 to t!l39,S-i),81 for the year ending June 80,
187.
From the report of the Supervising Surgeon of
the
MARINE HOSPITALS
it sears that branch of the public pen-Ice a
satisfactory condition. During the laBt fiscal year
13,ir,6 patients were treated in tho several hos
pitals of the country, at an average cost of abont BT
cents each per day, or a total expenditure ol
IWiiH.aiJl.ll, atrainst a total expenditure of the pre
ceding year of .tt3,0H.S, or an average cost per
patient of $1.04 per day. The increased receipt
and diminished expenses for tho lal fUcal year, aa
compared with the vear next preceding. show a net
gain to the Government of IR6.H19 91. 3nng the
same period the nnmher of districts in which relief
was furnished was greater than ever before, and the
salaries of medical officers at several of the princl- .
pill ports were increased. The financial improve
ment shown Isdue largely to a more careful scrntlny
of the applicants for relief, to tho rejection of those
who were not entitled tinder the law, and also to
the greater vigilance- in collecting the hospital
duos.

Institutions, and, without much delay, Con
gress would concede to thcin the right
to Issue notes for circulation This concession
would be followed by a surrender by the General
Government of all control over the paper cl -culm-ion
of tlio conntrv. The true pelicy will be
found in continuing the national banking syBtem,
without, however, yielding an Increase of Its
issue in proportion to the volume of Government
paper in- circulation.
There aro two effectual and certain wave of
placlug the country in a condition when specie and
imnerwill posscssthc same commercial value. By
diminishing the amount of paper in circulation
mo aincrcnre nelwcen tne commercial vaine
of paper and coin will diminish, and by
pursuing the policy the dift'erence will
disappear altogether. All legislation, however
limited in Its operation to the paper Issues of the
hanks and of tiie Government, whether bearing
Interest or not. and wb eh in effect shall lend to
diminish the market value of coin, will be found,
upon analysis, to contain a plan for controlling
the volume of paper currency, and all legislation
so limited which does not contain snch a plan.
will prove Ineffectual. Accepting tills proposition,
and believing that the country Is not prepared
to sanction tlio policy of contraction, it
only remains for mo to consider the mcar.s by
inch the value of our currency mav he Improved.
The basis of a policy of improvement mast be
found in a stead v refnsal to add to the naoer in
circulation, antll it is of the same value substan
tially as coin. This being accepted as the settled
purpose of the country, there can be no permanent
increase of difTereace between paper ana coin, and
an opportunity will be given for the influence of
national eauses tending upon tbe whole to a better
nnanciai conoiuon. we mav count nrst among
these the Increase of population and Its distribu
tion over new fields of business and labor. (Sec
ondly, In the South especially, the number of per
sons having property and using and holding money
will Increase. Next, wo mav anticipate more gen
eral nso of paper in Texas and tho Pacific States,
nywuicn, practically ror tne rest or tne country,
the volume of paper will be diminished and the
quantity of coin increased. Two facts tending to
produce an equality of value In the Influ
ences of these natural causes will be counteracted
in some degree by the increasing facility
for the transfer ot money from one polut to-
another and hv the OTAitpr nut nf hnnlt iliMba knit
certificates of deposit. Tho rapid transit of mer
chandise In brineing the period of Its consumption
nearer to time of its production Is an agency of a
simitar son. Giving tnece views incir lull weignt,
I am prepared tn say that the experience of tbe
last three years coincides with the best iudirment I
can form, and warrants the opinion that, under the
lnnnence of existing natural causes, our fluanclai
condition will gradually improve.
Diirlnir tho last fl-K-al vesr there were several
circumstances tending to oountenioi the natural
cnurre of affairs. Our exports of cotton tell off
thirty-seven million dollars, and there were ex
cessive Imports of wool, tea, coffee and sugar.
The stock of wool in warehouse on the 80th of
June was sufficient for six months' consumption ;
or sugar, i or iour ana a nail montns; oi conce,
ior live nionins. ana anor lor twelve months. In
the ordinary course of trade, the Importation of
these articles will be small during the current
year, with a consequent favorable effect upoa
the balance between this and other coun
tries. This anticipation of tho wants of the
country, iu connection with the decrease of our
exports, augmented the balance of trade; . created
an active demand for coin, and advanced the price. -
notwithstanding tttose adverse lulluunces, gold haa
averaged substantially the same premium from Jau.
1 to Nov 1, of the present year, aud for the corre
sponding period of 1871.
not aonoting tnat natural causes will in time
C reduce tho result sought for, it is yet advisable to
ring the power of the Government in aid of the
movement as fur as practicable. The revival of our
commerce la one instrumentality, and, perhaps,
the most efficient one of all. If the annual earnings
of American vessels were f 80,0 -0,000 instead of
f SO.OOU.UOO, tho difference in tho amount of ex
change available abroad would meet a large part
of the adverse balance on any ordinary year. The
experience of Europe tends to show that the abili
ty of a country to maintain specie payments la due
largely to the condition of its foreigu trade.
Next, every measure which increases or ira-
f roves the channels of transportation between
he seaboard and cotton and grain growing reelona
of the country, er lessens the costs of freights,
adds something to our capacity to compete suc
cessfully In tne markets of the world. Finally,
those measure which encourage American manu
factures, especially of iron, wool, and eotton, and
discourage the importation of like products, affect
favorably tbe balance of trade and help us toward
tbe end we seek. This statement in these words
la a general statement of a policy that, in my
opinion, will aid the country In reaching a con
dition where It will be practicable to resume and
maintain specie payments. Anticipating that
day, I anticipate also that tbe burden of resump
tion will rest upon the Government.
There are now more than nineteen hundred
hanks lu the country, and 1 cannot imagine a condi
tion of things so favorable, for a period of years,
as to enable them, at all times, to redeem their
uoles iu s;ieciu only.
Without proceeding to the discnsslon ot the
subject lu deuil.l think that all will have been
gaiuud that is or value when IheTreasuiy shall be
prepared to pay the demand notes of the Govern
ment lu coin, aud the hanks shall be prepared to
pay I heir notes either lu colli or in lvgal-teudur
uotes, and then our good foriuuo will clearly ap
pear In this, that otir paper currency la not exclu
sively of National Uauk notes, nor exclusively of
United btatos notes.
