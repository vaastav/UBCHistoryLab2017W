feared the structures will be engulfed

withstood the serious danger Wednes
day night, will be saved. The hotel
stands on the brink of the stream,

again, cause a cave-In at this point,
it is likely the structure would be en

The two houses will nppolnt commit
tees each to notify tho other house
and tho president that congress-Is
organized for business. The senate
will then adjourn for the day out 'of
respect to the memory of the late Sen
ator Allison. The house will also
terminate its brief session with reso
lutions commemorative of he lives of
Messrs Parker, South Dakota; Wiley,
Alabama; Dunwcll, Now York and
Powers, Maine.
Tuesday will be given up to the read
ing of tho president's message. As
this is President Roosevelt's lest an
nual message, there is unusual Interest
In it The general report Is that It will
prove to bo a conservative and care
fully prepared document, and that
few recommendations for legislation
will be ventured upon. ' .-is
The house likely will begin business
Wednesday by considering the bill
providing the means for the taking of
the thirteenth census. It is the ex
pectation of Mr. Tawney, chairman of
tho committee on appropriations, that
his commttteo will be prepared to re
port the making appropriations for
the legislative, executive and Judicial
branches of the government before the
end of the week and its consideration
will be begun at the first practical
moment.
The senate has agreed to take up
the bill for the establishment of pos
tal savings banks and Senator Fora
ker's bill authorlzatlng the re-enllst-
ment of tho negro soldiers who were
discharged because of the Brownsville
riot of 1906.
Party leaders expect very little legls
latlo'n other than the appropriation
bill will be attempted. Thcsoaggre
gate $100,000,000.
There will be a general effort to hold
the appropriations down to tho lowest
limit, but they likely will exceed this
figure. A bill for the Improvement M
rivers and harborB will carry not less
than $25,000,000 or $30,000,000. The
consus of 1910 will require an extra
outlay of not less than $10,000,000,
Agitation is being made for such
changes in the Sherman anti-trust
law as will provide immunity for com
binattons such as labor unions, which
have been held In restraint of trade
and which it is contended are not in
jurious.
When the houso adjourned after tbe;
first day s session 73 public bills hop
been dropped into the hopper in addj
tlon to 250 privato bills and eight
resolutions.
Indications aro that tho Japanese-
American agreement will bo the sub;
Ject of much debate during the pre
sent session of the senate, several of
tho members being Inclined to think
President Roosevelt and Secretary
Root usuroped constitutional powers ol
that body.
No now subjects being submitted
by the departments, It is believed tho
house will mako record time on the
general appropriation bills.
There was a pall of sadness over
the United States senate when It con
vened for tho second session of the
sixtieth congress, which was due to
the absence of the lato Senator Wil
liam B. Allison of Iowa, who died last
August after a service of over 85
years ia that body.
Sonatora Aldrlcb, Galllnger and
Teller were appointed In pumianco ot
a resolution offered by Senator Hole
to await upon the president and In
form him that congress was ready to
receive his annual message. Senator
Dillingham presonted the credentials
ot bis colleague, Benator-elect Carroll
S. Pago, of Vermont, and the oath ol
office was administered to htm by
the vice-president
Tho most important notion of the
house was tho passage by unanim
ous consent of a resolution authoriz
ing the committee on ways and
means in Its tariff hearings to sub
pent witnesses and to call for books
and papers.
