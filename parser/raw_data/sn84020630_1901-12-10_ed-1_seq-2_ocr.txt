Three Filipinos who had talten the
oath of allegiance to the United States
and who had been appointed to official
positions in their town, but who turned
traitors and murdered three peaceful
Filipinos because they refused to pay

sons of that kind will doubtless have a
salutary effect In the Philippine Isl

ordered that all pupils of the grammar

The Democratic managers and the
Democratic legislators of Missouri are
very hostile and very much opposed to
all sorts of trusts and money octopi. j
They fight these powerful combinations
of capital by getting all the money pos

such legislation for them as they want.
The state of Missouri Is a great state ;

money.
Colonel Bryan, in his paper the Com

tone of the poor and needy in Ne

who can afford to pay $3.0CO for blooded
heifers, can surely afford to give somc

f..i whom he claims to have greac m
licitude. New Mexico acquitted itself very well
at the meeting of the National Live

It was ably represented and Its dele

The reappointment of Albert W.
Thompson as receiver, and Edward J.
Fox as register of the federal land oi
flce at Clayton, Union county, is a
source of gratification to the Republi
cans, in fact, to all good citizens ot
New Mexico. Messrs. Thompson and
Fox are men of integrity, who have
served the government and the public
well .and faithfully in their respective
offices. They were endorsed for reap
pointment by Delegate B. S. Rodey ana
the Republican organization of New
Mexico and naturally were reappointed
although there were other applicants
for the two places.
Congressman Crumpacker of Indiana,
will introduce a bill in the house of rep
resentatives, having for its object the
reduction of the representation in con
gress from the several southern states
that lw tVmir mischievous and unfair
legislation are depriving many of their
citizens of the right of suffrage on ac
count of the race question. Such a bill,
if enacted, would be but fair and prove
of benefit. Take for instance, the state
of Mississippi, In the last few years it
has cast less votes for its several con
gressmen than the territory of New
Mexico has cast for its one delegate.
This state of affairs, of course, should
be remedied.
A census bulletin just issued reviews
the status of the salt industry in the
United States. Fifteen states and one
territory are enumerated as producing
salt, one state, Massachusetts, produc
ing but 9S0 barrels of salt in the year
1900, but one vainly looks for the name
of New Mexico as a producer of salt or
having such a thing as a salt deposit
or a salt lake. Of course, everyone
conversant with the resources of the
territory, knows that New Mexico's
salt lands and salt lakes are very ex
tensive and that they are considerable
producers of a domestic supply of salt,
but in this as In so many other instanc
es, the census does New Mexico as fla
grant injustice.
Bourke Cockran thinks that Presi
dent Roosevelt can and ought to stop
the warfare in South Africa. Perhaps
he also thinks that King Edward can
and should stop the guerilla fighting in
the Philippines. If President Roose
velt and King Edward would make
such attempts it would be mighty
pleasing to the thrashed Boers and the
vanquished Aguinaldoites, but as to
stopping the warfare it would only start
a new war and kindle the flame of in
surrection in South Africa as well as in
the Philippine islands to greater fury.
Statesmen of the Bourke Cockran type
will do to thrill an audience with their
eloquence, but as to practical states
manship, their ideas are very crude and
visionary.
The intimation of Attorney General
Knox to federal ottlcenoiaers umi mc,
had better retire from active political
leadership while holding office has had
the effect in Colorado and elsewhere of
bringing a great deal of new blood to
the top and the old guard holding fed
eral office is retiring from party posi
tions if not from party management.
This is probably as it should be for a
man In public service should devote all
of his working time to his duty as a
non-partisan official who must serve
Republicans and Democrats alike. He
need not therefore give up his In
fluence nor should his counsel In party
matters be despised or put aside, hut
the active party management should
be left to those not making a living
by public office holding.

ALBERT W.
Receiver of Public Money at the United
County, New
Albert W. Thompson, yesterday re
appointed by President Roosevelt - as
receiver of the federal land oitice at
Clayton, Union county, was born at
Belfast, Maine, May 17, 1864. He atten
ded the public schools of his native
state and when quite young, on ac
count of ill health, he was sent to Col
orado, where he entered Colorado Col
lege at Colorado Springs in 1884. After
a year's study, ill health compelled him
to abandon his proposed college educa
tion and to take up active outdoor life.
In 18S9 he entered the sheep and real
estate business at Clayton ' in Union
county. He served as secretary of the
THE BRIDGE OVER THE CANADIAN.
It Has Been Completed and Trains Are
Passing'Over It.
Railway Age.
In connection with the new line of the
Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific now
being built from Liberal, Kas., to Car
rizozo, New Mexico, a bridge of impor
tance has been built over the Canadian
river In New Mexico.
In its erection methods were-employ-ed
of considerable interest and some
what different from the plan generally
used in work of this kind.
The bridge is 769 feet in length and
spans the river at a height of 135 feet at
its highest point. It is a single track
structure supported on six steel piers,
and consists of seven spans 80 feet in
length and six spans of 35 feet, the
shorter spans having the same length
as the tops of the towers in the direc
tion of the length of the bridge. The
structural work on the bridge includes
1,710,000 pounds of soft steel, and was
built by the American-Chicago branch
of the American Bridge company.
The bridge throughout is of the deck
girder type, the girders used measuring
9 feet in height from back to back of
angles and placed 8 feet apart. The
bridge rests on six steel towers, each
of which is built on a foundation of
four pedestals of concrete, varying
in height at different points along the
bridge. The towers are all 8 feet wide
and 35 feet in length at the top; the
same length of the towers being main
tained from top to bottom, while the
sides from the top slope with a batter
of one in six, thus determining the
spacing of the piers at the base.
On the top of each leg of the towers
a plate 2 feet 6 Inches square is riveted,
which serves as a cap, and on which the
girders rest. The girders at the fixed
ends are riveted to the towers, while
the expansion ends are fastened by
means of anchor bolts in slotted holes.
In the locality in which the bridge is
built, timber is very scarce, and to
have employed false work in the erec
tion of the superstructure would have
necessitated considerable expense and
time in bringing the required materials
to the site. In view of these conditions
it was decided to dispense, if possible,
with the extensive false work which
would have been required in a bridge
of this height. Accordingly a new
method was employed In the raising of
the superstructure, which, it Is said,
has never before been used on a bridge
of this size. Two cables were stretched
ten feet apart from one side of the
gorge to the other, and on these trolley
systems were fitted up for conveying
the materials to be used in the towers
from the cars to their proper positions
in the bridge. The cables used were '
1,000 feet in length, 1 1-2 Inches in dia
meter, and were stretched by means of
hoisting engines. They were anchored
on one side in solid rock and on the
other by means of four 12x12 inch tim
bers, placed back of six piles driven in
to the ground. The pull on the anchor
ages was estimated at 85,000 pounds.
To these cables a platform was at
tached having a backward and for
ward motion along the cables, and
which at the time could be made sta
tionary in any position. In the build
ing of a tower, this platform was
fixed In position a short distance be
yond the site, and served as a means
for holding the pulleys through which
the cables of the trolley systems used
were run. A separate trolley was ar
ranged for each cable and was so de
signed that the structural material
could be run out from the embankment
or completed portion of the bridge to
the tower under construction, and
there raised or lowered as desired.
When a tower had been completed, two
men were sent out to the platform
i where the device grasping the cables
-was loosened and the platform pulled
along to the position desired for work
on the next tower and there fastened.
Bg the use of this method, no false

Republican county central committee
of Union county, and since his advent
into the territory has done efficient and
successful work for the Republican
party. In 1897 he was appointed by
President McKinley receiver of public
money at the United States land office
at Clayton, an office which he filled for
the past four years to the entire sat
isfaction of all concerned and with
efficiency and honesty.
He was married in 1899 to Miss Win

work whatever was necessary, and
there was provided a rapid and very
satisfactory means for conducting the
work. After the towers were comple
ted, the girders were placed in position
in the usual way by the use of a trav
eler. The traveler used was run on
rails spaced 10 feet center to center and
laid on either side of the rails in the
track. It was equipped with a 25 horse
power hoisting engine and two booms
60 feet in length. The platform on
which the hoisting engine rested was
13 feet above the rails, leaving an open
space 10x13 feet through the traveler,
through which the girders and other
structural material were brought for
ward to tie carried by the booms or
trolleys to their positions in the bridge.
In the construction of the sub-structure,
unusual conditions were encoun
tered, as mentioned in the recent arti
cle referred to, in that everything used
in the work, including cement, pile,
pile-drivers, boilers, engines, material
for coffer-dams, etc., was hauled for a
distance, of 80 miles across the sandy
country characteristic of that locality.

piers. The piers for the three towers
in the river are sunk to a depth of
from 10 to 12 feet below the bottom of
the stream, where they rest on a foun
dation of 20-foot plle3. No timber rap
ping whatever was used for the piles,
the tops of which were allowed to ex-
tend for a short distance into the
footings of the piers. The piers o:i thej
banks rest on foundations of solid ;
rock. All of the piers are made of unl- j
form shape, being 5 feet by 6 feet 6 in
ches at the top, with a round face on
! the up-stream side. The down-stream (1)le cu,t(u.ble of neutralizing and erad
i faces of the piers are built with a bat- icating this poison, and destroying the

The concrete used was of two kinds; j
one consisted of one part of Portland !
cement and seven parts of sand and
gravel, and the other of one part of
Portland cement to three parts of sand
and three parts of broken stone. The
substructure in all Includes 3,245 bar
rels of Alpha Portland cement andi
5,822 lineal feet of piling, while 96,436
feet of timber were required for the
coffer-dams. In the building of the
bridge, the work on both the substruc
ture and the superstructure progress
ed in an unusually satisfactory man
ner; no serious accidents or delays of
any kind having occurred. The work
on the substructure was begun about
March 1, 1901, and was completed on
September 1, 1901. The exact time re
puired for the erection of the super
structure with a force of 30 men was 10
days devoted to preliminary work, 25
days for the erection and 26 days for
the placing of the 21,000 field rivets
used. Within about 30 days after the
actual work had begun, work trains
were allowed to pass over the struct
ure. The superstructure of the bridge was
built under the direction of J. E. Took
ey of the American Bridge company,
and the substructure after plans and
under the general supervision of W. E.
Dauchy, chief engineer of the Chicago,
Rock Island and Pacific.
