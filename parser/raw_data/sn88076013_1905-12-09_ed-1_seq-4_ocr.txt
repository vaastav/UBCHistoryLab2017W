OFFICIAL PAPER FOR
STARK COUNTY.
Saturday, Dec. 9,1905.
THE MESSAGE.
CONGRESS convened again Mon
day and on Tuesday listened to
the message from President
Roosevelt. This document con
tains little that is new or striking
for the president is open frank
and communicative and his views
•n important subjects are very
well known. The document is a
careful, conservative and thorough
discussion of vital questions and
is generally conceded to be the
strongest paper the president has
ever written. His railroad rate
legislation scheme is modified
from last year, which meets with
general approval. We give be
low a condensed statement of
{principal points in the message
as compiled by the Pioneer Press:
STRIKING POINTS FROM THE PRESI
DENT'S MESSAGE.
Taken as a whole, we must all go up
•r down together.
The corporation has come to stay, just
as the trade union has come to stay.
Each should be favored so long as it
does good. But each should be sharply
checked when it acts against law and
justice.
A system of examination of railroad
accounts should be provided similar to
that of national banks.
This (railroad) legislation should be
enaeted in a spirit as remote as possible
from hysteria and rancor.
This government stands for manhood
first and for business only as an adjunct
to manhood.
We wish to secure as fair treatment
for the small town as for the big city
for the small shipper as for the big
shipper.
In. such a republic as ours, the one
thing that we cannot afford to neglect
is the problem of turning out decent
citizens.
Individual capitalist and individual
wageworker are alike entitled to the
protection of the law and must alike
•bey the law.
This government is not and never
shall be government by a plutocrkcy.
This government is not and never shall
be government by a mob.
All contributions by corporations to
any political committee or for any
political purpose should be forbidden by
law. ..
•Ff?
More and more, war is coming-'tjpf be
looked upon as in itself a lamentable
and evil thing.
As the world is now, only that nation
is equipped for peace that knows how to
fight and that will not shrink from fight
ing if ever the conditions become such
that war is demandedjin the name of the
highest morality.
We cannot have too much immigra
tion of the right sort and should have
mone whatever of the wrong sort.
These corporations doing an interstate
business are subjects without a sove
reign. We should assert the sovereignty
of the national government.
All private car lines and the like
should be expressly put under the super
vision of the interstate commerce com
mission.
Congress should consider the federal
government's duty with respect to insur
ance transactions.
Our navy is for the present sufficiently
large.
THAT letter in the Bismarck
Tribune regarding Cheneworth,
who is in the Burleigh county jail,
had all the ear marks of the
council for the defendant.
CITY elections in Fargo and
Grand Forks will be held under
the iiew primary election law.
Jamestown has over 5,000 popula
tion but not by the government
census of 1900.
THE fine new school building at
Bismafck has been named the
Oscar Will School in compliment
to the pioneer seedsman of the
capital city, who as a member of
the school board has given freely
of his time as supervisor of con
struction.

KING OF ALL COUGH MEDICINES.
Mr. E. G. Case, a mail carrier of Can
ton Center, Conn., who has been in the
U. S. service for about sixteen years,
says: "We have tried many cough med
icines for croup, but Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy is king of all and one to
be relied upon every time. We also
find it the best remedy for coughs and
colds, giving certain results and leaving
no bad after effects." For sale by all
druggists.
Tide*.
The following is given in brief as the
theory most generally entertained by
scientists, with a few exceptions, con
cerning tides: It is assumed that the
moon, acting alone, would not only
raise a wave on the side of the earth
Dearest to It by gravitation, but would
also draw the earth itself far enough
out of its course to leave behind some
of the water on the farther side, which
water would then be raised relatively to
the earth's surface and constitute the
second tidal wave. The sun alone
would act similarly, although its tide
raising effect is only about two-flfth3
that of the moon. Now, at new moon
the sun and moon "pull together" and
give higher tides than at the first and
third quarters, when the sun draws its
light angles to the line of the moon's
attraction, and at full moon, when the
sunj8 on the opposite side of the earth
from the iuoon, virtually the same ef
fect is observed as at new moon, but
the .double tide raising action of the
sun would again be superimposed 011
that of the moon and give tides on op
posite sides as high as those a fortnight
before.
Silemt Wisdom.
]£eep still. When trouble is brewing,
\eep still. Even when slander is get
ting on his legs, keep still. When your
feelings are hurt, keep still—till you
recover from" your excitement at any
rate. Things look differently through
an unagitated eye.
Dr. Burton relates how once in a
commotion he wrote a letter and sent
it and wished be had not. "In my later
years," he said, "I had* another com
motion and wrote a long letter but
life had rubbed a little sense into m«,
and I kept that letter in my pocket
against the day when I could look it
over without agitation and without
tears. I was glad. I did. Less and less
it seemed necessary to send it. I was
not sure it would do any hurt, but in
my doubtfulness I leaned to reticence,
and eventually it was destroyed."
Time works wonders. Wait till you
can Speak calmly, and then you will
not need to speak, maybe.
Au Antiphony of Love.
poet has.said that "as for Brown
ing's love for his wife nothing more
tender and chivalrous has ever been
told of ideal lovers In an ideal romance.
It is so beautiful a story that one often
perfers it to the sweetest or loftiest
p&em that came from the lips of ei
ther." True, yet the lives of the two
as poets make the story what it is.
Their lives, indeed, were poems, as Mil
ton said poets' lives should be, and their
poetry was their life, as Mrs. Brown
ing said should also be true of poets.
The world could spare neither the lives
nor the poems, and especially would it
be poor without those poems in which
each sang of the other. Take these-to
gether, was there ever, in all the treas
ury of the world's literature, so an
gelical an antiphony of love anthemed
by the two radiant and immortal lovers
themselves?—Richard Watson Gilder
in Century.
Moses as a Sanitarian.
Moses himself was a sanitarian of
no mean accomplishments, and many
of the principles established by him in
sanitary science might well- be exploit
ed in modern times. The type of camp
which he established for the detention
of unfortunate lepers, well modified to
salt modern principles, would serve for
the check and practical elimination of
consumption.—Scientific American.
