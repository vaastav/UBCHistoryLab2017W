Washington, D. C. Dec 6. The
President sent the following message
to Congress to-day :
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
During the past year the foreign
relations of the United States have
continued upon a basis of friend
ship and good understanding.
The year has been notable as wit
nessing the pacific settlement of two
important international controver
skb before the permanent court of
The Hague.
The arbitration of the fisheries
HUmite between the United States
,nH fireat Britain, which has been
the source of nearly continuous dip
lomatic correspondence since the
fisheries convention of 1818, has giv
en an award which is satisfactory to
both parties.
I'eace Commission.
Appreciating these enlightened
tendencies of modern times, the Con
gress at its last session passed a law
providing for the appointment of a
commission of five members "to be
appointed by the President of the
United States to consider the expedi
ency of utilizing existing interna
tional agencies for the purpose of
limiting the armaments of the na-
the American Sag to its ancient place!

At the instance of Colonel Goe-

charge of the work on the Panama
Canal, I have Just made a visit to the
Isthmus to inspect the work done
and to consult with tiim on the
ground as to certain problems which
are likely to arise In the near future.
The progress of the work Is most
satisfactory. If no unexpected ob
stacle presents itself the canal will
be completed well within the time
which this canal was eoastructed to
secure.

Oae of the great difficulties in the
prompt organization aad mobiliza
tion of militia and volunteer
is the absence of competent offices
of the rank of captain to teach the
new army, by the unit of the com
pany, the business of being soldiers
and of taking care of themselves so
In determining what the tolls in
the canal should be we certainly
ought not to insist that for a good
many years to come they should
amount to enough to pay the inter
est on the investment of $400,000,
000 which the United tates has made
in the construction of the canal. We
ought not to do this, first, because
the benefits to be derived by the
United States from this expenditure
are not to be measured solely by a
return upon the Investment.
My own impression is that the
tolls ought not to exceed $1 per aet
toa.
I can not close this reference to
the canal without suggesting as a
wise ameadmeat to the interstate
commerce law a provision prohibit
ing interstate commerce railroads
from owning or controlling ships en
gaged in the trade through the Pan
ama canal. I believe such a provis
ion may be needed to save to the peo
ple of the United States the benefits
of the competition In trade betweea

commerce law.
