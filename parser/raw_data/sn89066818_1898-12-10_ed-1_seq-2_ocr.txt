SENATE.
Washington, Dec. 6. When the sen
ate convened yesterday to begin th
closing session of the Fifty-fifth con
gress the chamber presented a nota
ble and beatutiful appearance. By 11
o'clock the public and private galler
ies were filled almosCto their capacity
with a distinguished assemblage, in
cluding many ladies in brilliant attire.
On the floor of the senate the displaj
of flowers was unusually beautiful,
even for the opening day of a session
of congress. The odor of the flowers
filled the chambers.
The memorable scenes enacted in
the chamber during the last session
and the momentous events that have
occurred since congress last ad
journed, created a feeling of intense
expectancy on the part of both the
spectators and the members of the
senate. This was made manifest by
the long lines of people in the cor
ridors anxious to gain admission tc
the gallaries and by the early arrival
of senators on the floor.
Through the courtesy of the vice
president the members of the joint
high commission were admitteel tc
the floor of the senate, and were the
recipients of much attention.
Just before the senate was called tc
order several well-known members ol
the diplomatic corps appeared in the
diplomatic gallery. Among them were
Sir Julian Pauntefote, ambassador o)
Gre'at Britain to the United States,
anel dean of the corps, with a party
from the British embassy; Mr. Wu
Ting Fang, the Chinese minister, and
party, anil Mr. Ye Pum Chin, the
Ccrean minister. All were interested
spectators of the opening scenes ol
the session and attentive listeners tc
the reading of the president's mes
sage. During a recess of three-quarters ol
an hour, while the senate was await
ing the presentation of the message
from the president, the members ol
the joint high commission helel an in
formal levee, greeting personally
nearly all the members of the Ameri
can senate.
The reading of the president's mes
sage, which occupied two hours and
eighteen minutes, was received with
very careful attention for an hour,
but after that the senators drifted tc
the cloak rooms or to the committee
rooms, where they could peruse the
message at their leisure in the printed
copies with which they had been
furnished.
HOUSE.
The opening session of the house was
a spectacular occasion, animated and
brilliant. There were more than the
usual number of distinguished per
sonages in the thronged galleries, in
chiding many representatives of for
eign governments, high officials, ladies
anil gentlemen conspicuous in social
and political life. The greetings of the
members were most cordial, and there
was no outcropping of partisan
rancor to mar the occasion. One ol
the most striking incidents was the
' cordial meeting between the flooi
leaders of the respective sides, Messrs.
Dingley anel Bailey. In view of the
gossip about the possibility of Mr.
Bailey being eleposed as the minority
leader it is significantthat the Fpeakei
named Mr. Bailey as the minority
member of the committee to wait
upon the president, an honor always
bestowed upon the recognized leadei
of the minority.
Speaker Reeel received a warm wel
come from both sides of the house
when he ascended the rostrum to call
the house to order, but perhaps the
greatest personal ovation to any mem
ber was that given Maj.-Gen. Wheeler,
of Alabama, who has not been seen by
many of his colleagues since he went
to the front at the head of the cavalry
division of Gen. Shaffer's army.
Mr. W. A. Stone, of Pennsylvania;
Mr. McMillan, of Tennessee, and Mr.
Sayers, of Texas, who have been
elected governors of their respective
states since congress adjourned, were
also overwhelmed with congratula-
' tions.
The floral tributes, were unusually
numerous, and made the hall a verita
ble bower of beautiful flowers. The
preceedings themselves were dull, all
interest centering in the reading ol
the president's message. For ovei
two hours the clerk droned through
the 2ong document, but the interest ol
the members and spectators nevei
flagged. With rapt attention they fol
lowed the president's recital of the
war, and listened eagerly to every sug
gestion or recommendation.
