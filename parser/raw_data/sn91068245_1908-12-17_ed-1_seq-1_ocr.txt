No. 40
EDITORIAL BRIEFS
Most politicians advocate good
roads, for as a rule they have a hard
road to travel.
The Hickory Mercury has come to
the conclusion that the South wants
protection, party or no party.
A New Jersey town has installed
women police. Their husbands now
have to go home earlier at nights.
When the Democrats reorganise,
the Socialist will stand a good chance
of capturing them boot and baggage.
Bryan was elected In Texas some
days aro for violating the game laws.
He must have been on another "wild
goose chase."
Since the Democrats have about all
declared for a protective tariff, what
will they have for their paramount
issue in 1912?
The defeat of Bryan cost the Dem
ocrats $018,000. It appears that the
job could have been done just as
well for less money.
Some of the Democratic Congress
men are kicking up a fuss about the
Panama Canal. They evidently want
a free trip to Panama to investigate
the matter.
Judging from the way the South
is looking with favor .on Republi
can policies the Democratic party
might as well apply for a receiver to
wind up its business.
Judging from the way some of the
Democratic editors talk they really
do not want Mr. Taft to do anything
for the South, for then they would
not have any opportunity to abuse
him for ignoring them.
The managers of Bryan's campain
were the only one's benefited by the
recent Democratic campaign, and in
fact, are the only ones that would
have been benefited had Bryan been
elected.
Xow thai Congress Is In session,
lhere will be some more Brownsville,
more's the pity. Greensboro Tele
gram. If we remember correctly we
had a great deal of Brownsville by
Author Bryan during the campaign.
Wasn't that a nity?
President Roosevelt says he has
recommended that the government
institute suit against the editor of
the New York World for printing li
belous articles in charging that Gov
ernment officials were improperly in
fluenced in the purchase of the Pan
ama Canal.
The Democrats who shed crocko
dile tears for the colored regiment
that was discharged by the Presi
dent for shooting up Brownsville,
Texas, will probably have an op
portunity to vote for reinstatement
of those who prove themselves In
nocent. Will they now hail the op
portunity with delight. Or has their
love grown cold since the election?
"If Taft as President wants to be
friendly with the South what can our
section lose by meeting him half
way? Our people can do this with
out making any compromise of their
political principles or losing their
f elf-respect. Wilmington Star.
Yes, and in fact, a few of them
might gain some self-respect by fol
lowing such a course.
One of the Democratic members of
the Legislature from Guilford Coun
ty is in favor of the Legislature rush
ing through with the work in a
month's time and adjourn and let the
members all go home without staying
for the other thirty days pay. This
Guilford member will find when he
gets to Raleigh that he is greatly in
the minority.
Some days ago a newspaper corre
spondent in Washington quoted Gov
ernor Glenn as saying that he would
retire from politics when his present
term of office expired. On Saturday
another story was sent out from
Washington to the effect that the
Governor would run for Congress in
the Fifth District in 1910 if the peo
ple wanted him to run. The people
of that district may decide that they
want Morehead to run again, and if
they do, it will not be necessary for
the Governor to make the sacrifice,
though they may appreciate his re
consideration ever so much.
I.ETEIt FROSI BILKIXS.
Ho- Killing at Ililkinsville Mr.
Tart and Prohibition Temperance
Verwus Xonsene Matrimony and
Hani Time The Standard Oil
Company and the Politician at It.
Bilkinsville, N. C, Dec. 15, 1908.
Correspondence of the Caucasian-Enterprise.
We have been killing gome big
hogs In Bilkinsville lately. Tom
Johnson killed one that weighed 39
pounds. Hit wuz only seven years
old an wuz the same breed that
Billy Bryan wuz goin ter interduce
if he had bin eleckted Preserdent.
Bill Moody awlso killed one that wuz
a corker. Hit weighed 28 pounds
and wuz but four years old. -
I nee by the papers that Mr. Taft,
the gentleman who will more into
the White House next March, hez
stirred up a gude deal of talk by
failin' ter drink anything at a big
banquet in hiz honor at Cincinnati
some days ergo. He turned hiz glass
down an' wouldn't even let them
pour anything in hit. Ov course the
prohibition brethren, them that don't
drink an' them that do, fer hit iz no
sign that a man don't drink when he
gits ter howlin' fer prohibition an
other luxuries. As I sed, they hev
bin howlin' at a grate rate.
Xow, I don't see anything ter git
oxsited erbout that. They iz plenty
ov men who don't drink, gude men,
too, an' they iz some gude who kin
git on the outside ov a considerable
quantity ov rye or corn licker. Some
ov the biggest drunkards I ever seed
wuz prohibitionists, an' some ov the
soberest men I ever seed wuz in fa
vor ov more licker an' better licker.
In fact, licker an' religion don't be
long in the same class. I hev seed
very religious people who could, but
who would not pass a saloon without
wettin' their whistle; on the other
hand I hev seed plenty ov people
who would stop an take a nip an'
go on an' attend ter their own busi
ness an turn up sober every time.
The trouble iz in the man. If hit
wuz only anti-prohibitionists who
drink licker they would never be an
other copper licker still made in this
world.
But I don't know what Mr. Taft
wuz up to. He may hev bin in a
condition ov health that he thought
licker would not be gude fer him.
Perhaps he hed bin takin' a few
quiet nips before he went into the
banquet hall an' thought he wuz
mellow ennuff. Possibly he hez
learned that the world iz full ov liars
nn' thought that if he took anything
at all that they would soon hev out
a report that he wuz drunk at the
first banquet in his honor after hiz
eleckshun az Preserdent. - Be that
az hit may. I'll bet Billy Taft does
n't experience any long drouth if he
cares ter irrigate. He iz rite thar
in Cincinnati, Ohio, whar they iz a
million gallons ov bug juice day an
nite. If he don't like the Ohio
brand hit ain't but a mile or so
acrost the river ter the Kentucky
side, an' they iz forty million gallons
rite thar in that State. Hit iz awl
gude licker, too; "gude, better, best."
An' when he goes ter Washington an'
gits moved into the White House he
kin still git hit at the same ole price.
No, don't worry erbout Mr. Taft.
Turn your attention ter savin some
ov the more active and noisy prohi
bitionists rite here in North Carolina.
They air in a desperate plight an'
can't hardly wait fer the jug train
ter come in from outside points load
ed with licker . I am never oneasy
erbout Preserdents an things like
that; they air able ter buy their
licker. I worry erbout prohibition
ists who cut off the supply an then
hev ter git hit from outside points.
They air the fellers who beat their
wives an' fill drunkards' graves in
many, many cases.
By the way. I notis that since Dur
ham went dry; by local election
first, and by the State law, second
they hev sorter got down ter real
business - in the way ov crime. I
see that they wuz 212 arrests thar
durin' the month ov November, which
iz a bad reckord fer a town o that
size an fer a dry town, too. The
prohibitionists in that town must hev
got news that the devil hez bin
turned loose, an' think that they will
march out ter meet him. Ov course
I don't mean that the real temper
ance people hev turned criminals.
But I do mean that the hypocrits air
givin' a record-breakin perform
ance, just az they do everywhar, an'
at all times.
I notis that the Governor ov North
Carolina hez refused ter pardon old
Major Martin, a Republikin who
went ter the penitentiary several
years ergo on the charge ov em-
bezzlin' !money from the State. But
on the same day the Governor grant
ed pardon ter two prisoners who had
committed murder. I don't know,
I guess rite now that the fellers that
had committed murder wuz dyma
krats, an' az our grate an' noble
party iz gittin' so weak an scatterin
he iz lookin' out fer tryin' ter increas
the party by hook an' crook. That iz
the way we dymakrats bv awlways
done when things begin ter look
billious; we keep the pen full ov
Repuklikins an' turn out awl the
dymakrats az fast a they air need
ed; in fack, it iz purty Hard ter
git one ov our real gude workers In
the pen.
In the town of .Statesville, county
seat of Iredell, they hev a court
house whar marriage license air sold
ter awl who her the price an a desire
ter hitch up. Last year they sold
355 pairs ov them license durin the
year, which ended December lit.
This year they sold only 282 pairs, a
considerable failin off. Who kin ex
plain hit? The old say in U that
when times air hard more people git
married. If that lz true hit iz
strange fer the reverse orterbe true.
I see that they air still takin' tes
timony an other things ter try ter
find out bow the Standard Oil Com
pany hez bin makin' so much money.
Awl the poliytlsbuns an the news
papers seem ter know Jlst how hit
wuz done. But Mr. John D. Rocke
feller an them other milyonaires
seem ter hev fergot awl erbout hit.
From the tone ov Mr. Rockefeller on
the witness stan' I judge that he hez
lay erwake at nite fer a long time
tryin' ter study up some plan ter
keep frum makin' so much money.
But the folks will sit up late an'
burn his lamp oil an' so they keep
on pilln' up millions. The court at
torneys claim that the Standard Oil
Company, or a branch ov hit, nv.de
$55,000,000 in seven years, that iz,
that much clear profit. Mr. Rocke
feller sed hit wuz erbout that much,
or ten times that an' he'd be blest if
he could remember which. The
Standard Oil Company an' the Ten
nessee "night riders" air hard nuts
ter crack. Az ever,

OFFICIALS AFTER TOBACCO
TRUST.
Nine Companies With Tluir Subsi
diaries Are Named as Constituting
an Illegal Combination Decree of
the Court.
New York, Dec. 15. Nine com
panies with their subsidiaries are
named as constituting an illegal com
bination in the final decree filed to
day in the United States Circuit
Court, putting into effect the judg
ment recently obtained by the Gov
ernment in its suit to dissolve the so
called Tobacco Trust. The companies
named are:
American Tobacco Company.
American Snuff Company.
American Cigar Company.
American Stogie Company.
Mac Andrews & Forbes Company.
P. Lorillard Tobacco Company.
R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
Blackwell's Durham Tobacco Com
pany.
Conley Foil Company.
Each of the first five of these com
panies, the Court declares, is in itself
a combination In violation of the law.
The order enjoins these companies
from continuing as parties in the
combination and restrains them from
engaging 'In Interstate- or foreign
trade until "reasonable, competition"
between them is restored.
The Government and the defendant
companies will at once take appeals
from the decree. Such action on the
companies' part will make effective
one highly important clause that
which provides for a suspension of
the injunction during the pendency
of the appeal.
ALL NATIONS WELCOME BUT
CARRIE.
Carrie Nation Creates Much Disturb
ance in a Scotland Town.
London, Dec. 12. "All nations are
welcome here except Carrie," is the
legend with which the public houses
of Dundee, Scotland, are now deco
rated. By way of enforcing the an
nouncement, two of the public-house
keepers to-day threw the reformer
from their premises without cere
mony or tenderness. Carrie was not
dismayed by this treatment, but
made tracks for the next bar. En
route she met a clergyman, smoking
a cigarette.
"Take that vile thing from your
mouth,' 'she exclaimed, but the of
fender bestowed a smile on her and
walked on.
Carrie has been shocked to find
tea drinking so common in Scotland,
where, indeed, an amazing quantity
of the beverage is consumed at all
hours of the day. She classes tea
drinking with the morphine habit,
and has added it to her crusade
repertoire.
The police have not acted on the
request of the public housekeeper
who wants her prosecuted for invad
ing his place.
SURPRISE MARRIAGE IN WILSON.
Miss Branch Jilted Her New York
Fiance for Her First Love.
Richmond, Va., Dec. 11. Engaged
to be married to a North Carolina
beauty, Nicholas F. Alston, of New
York City, while on his way to see
his pretty fiancee, was met in this
city with a telegram telling him that
he had been jilted and that the girl,
who was Miss Nan Branch, daughter
of Alpheus Branch, of Wilson, N. C,
had been married to Fred Carr, pri
vate secretary to Senator Overman.
Mr. Alston is deeply grieved over
the fickleness of his fiancee, but takes
the matter philosophically.
Negro in Albemarle Jail Charged
With Heinous Crime.
Salisbury, N. C, Dec. 151 Crimi
nally assaulted in her own home this
afternoon at Moss Siding, near Whit
ney, Stanly County, Mrs. James R.
Moss, a highly respected lady of that
place, is to-night in a precarious con
dition on account of an attack made
upon her by Henry "Young, colored,
aged about twenty-five years, who
was late this afternoon landed in jail
at Albemarle, charged with the
crime.
AN HONEST DEAL
President Roosevelt Indignantly
Denies Tbat Officials Wert
Improperly Influenced in
Panama Canal Deal.
PROTECTION FOR THE SOUTH
This Fact Ha Been Demonstrated
and it it Now a Qaotion of the
South Voting for What It Wants.
Important Conventions in Wash
ington The Commit Ion Appoint
i ed by the President to Inquire Into
the Condition" of Farm Life Will
Make Its Report t the President in
a Few Days Speaker Cannon Has
Agreed to Tariff Revision.
Special to The Caucasian.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 15, 190S.
It is now about settled that Can
non wil be Speaker, but this was
not determined as Indicated In a
former letter to The Caucasian until
President Taft knew where he was
standing on the tariff revision and
the other reform policies of the ad
ministration. When President Taft reached
Washington Speaker Cannon at once
called upon him and assured the
President on every pcint. Mr. Taft
was not, even satisfied with this, and
requested that the Wkole Ways and
Means Committee of the House would
call him and make similar assur
ances, especially with reference to
the tariff. This was done the next
day, and after these conferences it
was given out that there would be no
objection made to Cannon.
However, there is a pretty fight
going on in the House to change the
rules which have given the Speaker
such arbitrary power, and it now
looks as if some modification would
be made.
Important Conventions in Washing
ton. During the last week the Deep
Waterways Congress, the Rivers
and Harbors Congress, and the Con
gress for the Conservation of Na
tural Resources, have all been in
session in Washington" The "meet
ings were well attended and great
interest was shown by the delegates
and members of Congress. Much
good is sure to result from all of
them. t
In a few weeks the Commission ap
pointed by the President to inquire
into the conditions of farm life and
to make recommendations for a gen
eral uplift of agriculture will also
make its report to the President.
It is generally stated that the ac
tion of the President in creating
this Commission, and also in organ
izing the Congress to consider the
conservation of natural resources,
along with the building of the Pan
ama Canal, will go down in history
as three of the greatest acts of Presi
dent Roosevelt's administration. Of
course, it is also admitted, at the
same time, that he will be given the
credit for starting the great and
much needed reform in the regula
tion of trusts and monopolies.
The Panama Canal Charges.
Recently there have been publish
ed several stories and charges to the
effect that there was graft in the pur
chase of the Panama Canal. These
charges have gone so far as to inti
mate that some members of the ad
ministration were into a deal to have
the Government to buy the canal
from France, and that they got some
of the money. The President has in
dignantly denounced these charges,
stating that the Government bought
the Panama Canal from the French
Government for a price recommend
ed by the board of engineers appoint
ed by the United States Govern
ment; that the Government got what
it wanted at a price considered rea
sonable, and paid the money to the
French Government, and that no one
connected with the administration
was interested in the deal except in
the interest of the Government, or re
ceived a cent of the money, and that
outside of this, if the French Govern
ment should have paid any of the
money to any agents or to any Amer
ican citizens, it is not known to the
administration .and is not a matter
of concern.
Protection for the South.
More evidence similar to that
quoted and commented upon in the
letter to The Caucasian of last week
has been given by. Southern witness
es before the Ways and Means Com
mittee in favor of protection for the
raw materials and manufactured
products of the South.
Several Congressmen, in comment
ing upon these facts in connection
with President-elect Taft's speech in
New York, say that this evidence
shows that the President will not
have to convert the South to the
benefit of Republican policies, that
they are already converted, and that
it is simply now a question of the
South in the future voting for what
it wants.
Fraction Over Secret Service.
Considerable feeling has been
aroused in Congress by a paragraph
in the President" tne&sage with ref
erence to the Srt Service.
The hut session of CoBgre cat
down the appropriation for the Se
cret Service, aad Inserted a tUue
limiting the use of th appropria
tion by the Secret Service to the
employment by the Treasury De
partment only. This practically con
fine the use of the Secret Service to
detecting and running down coun
terfeiters of money. , Formerly the
Secret Service had been used for
detecting fraud in every dt'partraent
of the Government.
It was the Secret Service men who
detected the enormous land frauds
in the West, which ban led to the
conviction of a number of very weal
thy men who had defrauded the
Government out of large tracts of
land and great deposits of minerals,
and, besides, it will be remembered
that one Senator and one or more
Congressmen were indicted and con
victed. The President referred to this in
his message, and showed the impor
tance of continuing similar investi
gations, and asked that the appro
priation be increased and that the
limitation placed upon the use of
the Secret Service by the last Con
gress be removed.
The President also cited some of
the arguments used by members of
Congress last session for their ac
tion, and this Is what has aroused
the ire of that body.
Committees .have been appointed in
both Houses to draw a protest or re
buke to the President for the lan
guage used. It is reported that if
such action is taken by Congress,
that the President will reply in vigor
ous terms.
TAFT TO VISIT PANAMA.
Contemplates a Visit to the Canal
Zone Before His Inauguration.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 12. Wm.
H. Taft, president-elect, contem
plates a visit to Panama before his
inauguration. This visit is approv
ed by President Roosevelt and Sec
retary Root. While it has not been
finally determined upon, Mr. Taft
announced to-night that it was his
inclination to go. Should this be his
final decision he will leave the port
of Charleston, S. C, probably the
last week in January for a trip
which will occupy approximately
twenty days. There are many rea
sons, in Mr. Taft's view, why his trip
to the Isthmus would be of decided
advantage to the advancement of
the canal project and consequently
to the United States. President
Roosevelt's visit proved a decided
stimulus to the work; the three vis
its which Mr. Taft has made as Sec
retary of War all were of advantage;
there are constantly arising and ac
cumulating many minor tangles of
administration and conflict of au
thority which the presence of the
President or the President-elect
might make possible of eliminating
with little difficulty.
The journey, if made, would un
doubtedly be on one of the navy's
best ships, and Mrs. Taft, who made
the first visit to Panama with Mr.
Taft, four years ago, would, without
doubt, accompany him this time.
The only objection to the expedi
tion, which has been pointed out by
careful students of the laws and the
constitution is that pending the of
ficial declaration of Mr. Taft as
President, there is no constitutional
or legal provision for the substitu
tion of any one else in the event of
anything happening to him in Pana
ma. This objection is not regarded
as of sufficient weight to detain Mr.
Taft from a journey which is regard
ed as essential to the success of one
of the biggest enterprise of his ad
ministration. FOR A YOUXTEER ARMY.
President Wants Measure Passed
Providing for a Volunteer Army in
Time of Emergency.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 12. The
initial movement to carry out a rec
ommendation of the President was
taken to-day when Representative
Hull, Chairman of the Committee on
Military Affairs, introduced a bill
suggested by the President and pre
pared under the direction of Mr. Taft
to provide for a volunteer army in
time of emergency.
The bill would revise the present
law to provide for the raising of a
volunteer army which has been de
scribed by the President as having
been placed on the statue books by
piece-meal and hurriedly.
It is claimed for the bill that it Is
elastic and under its provisions a
force of 2,000,000 men could be
raised as well as one of 50,000.
An Unusual Meeting of Quakers at
High Point.
High Point, N. C, Dec. 14.- -most
unusual meeting of Quakers,
known as Wilburites, conservatives,
took place tonight at the Friends
church. In this meeting there was
an illustration of the custom of wor
ship among the Quakers fifty years
ago. The visiting members brought
interesting messages from England,;
Canada and the United States. Witt,
the company was Thomas Davidsor
of England, and others from Canada
and New York. The custom of tht
Quakers when they wore the pioneer
hat and bonnet and prayed and
preached during services as the
Spirit moved, without formality, at
tracted no little notice.

Manufacturers Ordered to FurnUh

Product.
Washington. Dec. 12. Unscrupu
lous and otherwise misleading
Dhrases in guarantee labels used by
manufacturers are barred under a
decision promulgated to-day by the
pure food and drug board with the
approval of Secretaries Cortelyou,
Wilson and Straus. The decision
conforms to the recent refusal of
Commissioner of Patent? Moore to
register trade-mark which include
the phrase "Guaranteed under the
food and drt'gs act, June 30, 1906,"
on the ground that it was mislead
ing. Effective January 1st next, new
guarantee labois must be changed so
as to show plainly that the guaran
tee is that of the manufacturer and
not of the government, but because
of the large sums of money invested
in good faith in labels and plates,
the old forms of labels now in use
representing guarantees already filed
with the department will be recog
nized for a term of two years.
FOR LEVEE ON THE CAPE FEAR.
Rill Introduced In Congress for Ap
propriation for Construction at
Kelly's Cove.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 14. Rep
resentatives Godwin and Thomas
have introduced a bill In the House
of Representatives, appropriating one
hundred thousand dollars, or so
much thereof as may be necessary to
construct a levee or levees at Kelly's
Cove on the Cape Fear River, in
Bladen County, N. C.
The bill provides for the levees
to be constructed under the direc
tion of the War Department.
It will be remembered that during
the floods of August and September,
1908, the water in the Cape Fear
River rose to the highest point
known and a considerable portion of
the country lying between the Cape
Fear, and the Black River flooded by
an escape of water from the Cape
Fear River at a low point near Kel
ly's Cove. The water passing from
there across the country to Black
River completely flooded French's
Creek township in Bladen County
and Cantuck township in Pender
County.
