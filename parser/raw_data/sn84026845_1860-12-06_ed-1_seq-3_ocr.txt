Deaths.?During the month
jnst past forty-five persons tinve deceased
in the city. Of these, some eighteen were
grown persons, thebalance children. Nine
of the de iths resulted from diptheria, which
singular disease has assumed something
of an epidemic from.

vonthful Priuia Douna will give n grand
concert in this city on Saturday evening,
l)cc. iJth at Washing^n Hall. Patti hus
nchieved a great triumph in her profession,
aod has everywhere received enthusiastic
applause and high favor for her eminent
artistic attainments and her extraordinary
grace and beauty.
jgay-RKTURSED.?As will be seen by n
card elsewhere. Dr. K. O. Winchell hus re
turned to the city, after a brief visit to his
professional friends, with a view or thor
oughly acquainting himself with whatever

added to the art of Dentistry. He is now
fully prepared with all the latest applian
ces and improvements and can accomo
date the public with any and. all kinds of
work pertaining to the profession. He
will be pleased to welcome both old and
new patrons.
Have Water Again*.?We are |
gratified to announco that the water was j
'?let on" last uight, and will so remain till
the aqueous dispenser breaks down again,
and may that be a long while for it is a
very inconvenient thing to be dry. If there
should happen to come a fire whilst the
Water Works was laboring under one of
its tawtrums there would be such a roaring
of flames here and such a destruction of
property as nobody ever witnessed. This
consideration alone, to say nothing of the
inconvenience which the public sustains
in other respects, ought to spur up those j
in authority to increase the security and
capacity of the works.
Bsg-Sbsf tc tiis Penitentiary.?John
Baltimore, a negro who is will known in
this city, and who was tried and acquitted
by the court of Washington county, during
liio early part of the present year, for the
murder of Jiihn McDonnell, at the Burgetts
toivu fair, in 1S3D, was tried last wojk
before the court of common pleas of Jeffer
son county, Ohio, on charges of burglury
and larceny, in entering the Franklin
ltonse, Steuben villa, and stealing from
the proprietor thiriy-six dollars. The trial
was concluded on Friday evening last.?
The verdict of the jury was guilty. The
court sentenced him, on Saturday, to three
years service iu the Ohio pcuitentiary.?
llefore the judge pronounced sentence
lliltiraurc made an affecting appeal for
mercy, with tears, denying in the most
positive manner that he stole the money
aud promising to lead n better life in fu
ture. The judge knew him too well for j
liis proteststions to have any favorable
effect.
{5^-Winter is Hrue.?The year has
fulfilled it3 ditties, says the Louisville
Journal, and is now prepared for hibernal
repose, that it may be reinvigorated when
Spriug calls upon it for action. Autumn j
gives place to winter, but it docs not |
leave us without somo remembrance of its
beauty and prodigality. Now and then n
beam of sunshine glows among the bare
limbed trees, which stnnd like giants
around the throne of the Frost-king, and
the mountain streams still murmur over
the pebbles the same delicious music
which fell upon the autumn-laden uir of
October. Sometimes a breath from the
sweet Sonth steals like a placid summer
dream over us, and the emerald-tinted
gr.is?, seems to have caught a deeper hue
tr.im the cerulean concave; these linger as
If loth to part from us, while all the d'eli
cite (lowers have hidden themselves away
and the song birds have winged their
flight to balmier zones. But the bright
autumnal smile of the sunset yet remains,
but thongh it may be compared to the lin
gering beauty of death, before "decay's
effacing fingers" destroy it, still it is ineff
ably grand in its wealth of purple and
Kohl. But soon all will he hushed in Na
ture s uight; the streams will seek their
winter sleep, curtined by ice nnd canopied
u'ilh snow, and the winds will form hil
locks of the earth strewn leaves, to stand
like grave marks in the woods; but the
Rerms of the water lillies will repose be
neath the coverlids of every rivulet and

A boon than Nature, Wisdom Song or Wit,

CONGRESSIONAL.
WasuLs'oto.v, Dec. 5. '
House.?Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, from the
Committee oh Ways and lleanF, reported
h bill making appropriations' for'the pay
ment of invalid and other pensions, and a
bill for the support of the West- Point
Academy. Referred to the Committee of
the Whole on the State of the Union.
The House, by a vote of 08 against 125,
refilesd to lay on the table Mr; G row's
(Prt.) molioii to reconsider the vote by
which the Homestead bill was last session
referred""to the Committee of- tbe Whole
on the State of the Union.
The House then reconsidered the vote
nnd the hill is thus-brought up for action.
Mr. Grow did not desire to discuss this
nwr.surr, the principle involved having
been familiar to the country for the past
two yturs._ This bill however avoids the
prominent 'objection made in - Presideut
Buchanan's' Veto ; message. It does" not
purpose to devote the lands but requires
the payment of $10 for 60 acres. He
might if necessary quote' Gen'l Jackaun
against Mr. Buchanan to show that the
public lands should not be the source of
lederal revenue. He moved the previous
question, under the operation of which the
bill passed?yeas 132, nnys 76.
Mr. Colfax, of Ind., moved that the Post
Ro'ute bill, returned from the Senate at
the former session, with; amendments, be
referred to the Post Office Committee. He
remarked that there had been uo such bill
passed for the last three years, and it was
desirous to have action as soon as possi
ble.
Mr. Smith, of Va., objected, saying that
the government was tinancially embar
rassed.
Mr. Colfax?That is true; but we draw
our pay. lie had performed his duty as
to this mailer, and said in conclusion, that
there were several reforms proposed in th1;
bill, and the Postmaster General was anx
ious to know the disposition of Congress
as to the contracts with railroad com
panies.
The objections to taking np and refer
ring the bill were persisted in.
On motion of Mr. Sherman the House
went into Committee of the Whole ou the
State of the Union, Mr. Washburn, of III.,
in the chair, and took up the Military
Academy bill.
Mr. Curtis offered nn amendment pro
viding that the study of Cadet3 shall not
be extended beyond four years.
A debate occurred on the amendment,
which uas rejected.
The Pension bill was read. This, with
the Military .Academy bill, subsequently
passed.
Mr. Sherman offered a series of resolu
tions referring various brunches of the
President's message to the appropriate
standing committees. Adjourned.
Senate.?The session was opened with
prayer.
Mr. Pugb of Ohio, appeared in his seat.
Mr. Hale, of X. 11., moved that a num
ber of the volumes of the Pacific .Railroad
report be published for the use of the Sen
ate.
Mr. Powell, of Ky., moved the reference
of so much of the President's Message as
relates to to the present political a flairs of
the country, to a special committee.
Mr. Green, of Mo., introduced a resolu
tion that the Committee* of the Judiciary
be instructed to inquire into the propriety
of providing, by law, for establishing an
armed police force along ibe border Slates,
both slave and free, for the purpose of
maintaining general peace between the
Slates, nnd preventing the invasion of
States by the citizens of another, and also
for the efficient execution of the Fugitive
Slave Law.
Mr. Cameron, of Pa., moved that the
subject be made the order of the day for
next Monday.
Mr. Latham, of Cal., presented the cre
deutiols of Edward D. Baker, Senator
elect from Oregon.
Mr. Hale, of N. H., moved to reconsider
the vote by which 10,000 copies of the
President's message were ordered to be
printed. <?le said that if he understood
the message clearly it first took the groaud
that South Carolina bas just cause to se
cede and secondly declared that she had
no right to secede. He thought the Pres
ident should have pointed out to Congress
some rule for guidance. He has failed to
i'>ok the thing in the face. We must look
to the ballot box or a war for the termina
tion of these difficulties. South Carolina
asks no council. She considers disunion
n settled question nnd is arming herself.
The voice of the majority, as announced
at the ballot box, will not be submitted to
by her. She considers that the Northern
States are the ngressors. The gentlemen
ou the other side listen to the voice of
passion rather thuu to their own convic
tions. We are trying an experiment. Our
Republic has not yet outlived the soldiers
who fought its battles and won its victo
ries. We have obtained what we have
only by great effort. We are approachiug
the culminating point, and the civil war
of England was insiguiGcant to what our
conflict may he if we cannot settle things
peaceably. Wo must look danger straight
in the face
A message was received from the House,
informing the Senate that it had passed
the hill to secure Homesteads to actual
settlers in the public domain.
Mr. Wigfall said?The more I read the
message tne less I comprehend it. I con
clude, however, that the President believes
it to be .impossible to maiutnin the organ
ization of the courts in South Carolina, or
enforce the decisions of the judicial tri
bunal. But whether the Stale secedes or
not. he lias the power to collect customs
'there,, and he has the power of holding
the Jorts. I intend introducing at an early
da}, a resolution to ascertain whether an
order has gone from' the War Department
in reference to the matter, for L l.elieve the
President Will* precipitate the measure he
seems to avoid. ' Ft will be hecossarv to put
a construction on the message after we know
what the President" int'enda to do.. After
secession.is :ftttempted, ..t,hen will we urge
forbearance no longer.. Then will =w'e

Since Nov. 1st, ?115,000 in gold has
been received at Victoria from the Frazer
river mines.
There was a serious riot at the Victoria
Theatre on Nov. 3rd, growing out of long
existing prejudices of the negroes against ,
the whites. The negro population have
emigrated to British Columbia from Cali
fornia, to improve their social position,
which they claim to be equal in all things
to any other race. The whites demurred,
and the management of the Theatre pro
vided seats for its colored patrons in a
separate part of the bouse. On the night
in question, the negroes concerted a plan
to take possession of the reserved seats.
The negroes first forced admittance to the
parquette. The whites attempted to expel
them. The netors, in stage costume,
jumped into the parquette to assist in the
tight. The iadies took refuge behind the
scenes. A party of negroes, armed with
clubs, came to the rescue, of their fellows.
A number of whites were knocked down
aud kicked by negrees. The negroes got
possession and drovo out the whites, and
were in turn repulsed. Some of the ne
groes had fire arms. The principal rioters
were arrested, and order was restored by
the' police. One hundred negroes were
engaged in the riot. Another attack on
the Theatre was planned for November
10th. When the steamer left a police
force was oil hand.

_ Constipation or Costivenesa.
No one of the "many ills that flesh ia heir to'Mj so
prevalent, so little understood, and so mnch ncgltcred
as Costiveness. Often triginating in carcleisneta or
sedentary habits; it is regarded as a slight df&order
of too little consequence to excite anxiety, uiiile.in
feality it is the precursor and companion of many cf
the most fatal and dangerous diseases, and unlvsi
early eradicated it will bring the sutterex* to an .un
timely grave. Among the lighter evila of Which
cewtiveuess is the usual attcudant are Headache,
Colic, Kheumatism, Foul Breath. Piles and others of
like nature, while a long train of frightful diseasea
such as Malignant Fevers, Abscesses, Dysentery, DK_
arrhcea, Dyspepsia, Apoplexy, Epilepsy, Paralj *h,
Hysteria. Ilypocbondriani*, Melancholy and Insanity,
fiwt indicate their presence in the aystcm by this
alarming symptom. Not tinfrcquently the disease* '
named originate in Constipation, but take on an.iVi- ?
dependent existence unless the cause is eradicated in .
an early stage. From all theso considerations it fol
lows that the disorder should rocelve immediate at- .
tention whenever it occurs, and no person should
neglect to got a box of Ceplialic Pills on the firat ap
pearance of the complaint, as their timely use will
expel the insiddnus approaches of disease and destroy
this dangerous foe to human life.
A Heal Blessing.
Fityiician?Well, Mrs. Jones, how is that headache ?
3/ra. Jones?Goba! Doctor, all gone! 'The I'ili youi
aent enred me in jiist twenty minutes, and 1 wiah
you would senjl more, so that I can have them handy.
Physician?You can get them at any Druggist's.
Call tor Cephalic Pills; J find they never Tail, and 1
recommend them in ail cases of Headache.
Mrs. Jones?I shall send for a box directly, and
shall tell all my suffering friends, fur they are a r?.tl
blessing.
Twenty Millions of Dollars saved.?Mr. Spald
ing haa aold two midious of bottles of his celebrated
Prepared Glue and it is estimated that each bottle
saves at least ten dollars worth of broken furniture,
thus making an aggregate of twenty millions of
dollars reclaimed from total loss by this valuable
vention. Having made his Glue a household word,
he now proposes to do the world still greater service
by curing all the aicliiii? heads with his Cophnlic
Pills, and if they are as good as his Glne, Headaches
will soon vanish away like snow in July.
65^" Oyer Excitkmest, and the mental care and
auxiety incident'* to close attention to business or
study, are among the numerous causes of Nervous
Headache. The disordered state of inind and body
incident to this distressing complaint is a fatal blow
to all energy and amnltion. Sufferers by this disor
der can always obtain r-peedy relief from these dis
tressing attacks by using oue of the Cephalic Pill?
whenever the symptoms appear. It quiets the over
tasked brain, and soothes the strained and jarring
nerves, and relaxes the tension of the stomach which
always accompanies and aggravates the disordered
condition of the brain.
Fact wonrn knowing.?Spalding's Cephalic Pills
are a certain ctire for Sick Headache, Bilious Head
ache, Nertous Headache, Costiveness and Geneaal
Debility. ^
Great Discovery.?Among the most Important of
all tho great medical discoveries of this age may be
considered tho system of vaccination for protection
from Small Pox, the Cephalic Pill f?r relief of
Headache, and the use of Quinine for the prevention
of Fevers, either of which Is a sure specific, whoso
benefits will lie experienced by suffering humanity
long after iheir discoverers are forgotten.
I3F-Did you everliavo the Sick neadache? Do
you remember the throbbing temples, the fevered
brow, the loathing and disgust at the eight of food.
How totally unfit you were for pleasure, conversa
tion or study. One of the Cephalic Pills would havo
relieved yon from all the suffering whicli yon then
experienced. For this and other purposes you should
always have a box of theui on baud to uso as occasion
requires.
