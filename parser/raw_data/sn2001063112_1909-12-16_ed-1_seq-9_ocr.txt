COMMENT ON THE MESSAGE
South l)ak»ta Mcmlivra of Congress
Ai'o Disappointed That Most Im
|Mrt4Uit Hecoiiiinciidations
Were Postponed.
Washington, Dec. 9.—Members of
the South Dakota delegation in con
gress commented on. President Taft's
message as follows:"
Senator Gamble—"I regard the
message as able, clear and compre
hensive. I especially commend the
position of the president in the use
he is to make cf the new tariff board
in securing data as to the cost or
production of manufactured articles
at home and abroad. The recom
mendation in regard to the economi
cal administration of the government
will meet the approval of the country.
1 am confident the special messages
which he has prom.sed on these and
related subjects will meet the ap
proval and expectation of the people.'
Senator Crawford—"1 am especial
ly pleased with the construction the
president places' upon the maximum
and minimum clause in the tariff act.
He makes it very clear that in his
judgment the cases will be rare in
deed in which the maximum rate will
be enforced, if ever. 1 am also much
pleased with his declared intention
to make the utmost out of the pro
vision for a tariff commission in the
new tariff law, and liis further state
ment that if the facts' secured by the
tariff board show generally that the
rates imposed by the present tariff
law are excessive under the principles
of protection as described in the party
platform, he will not hesitate to call
the attention of congress to the situ
ation and necessity for reductions
in the duties in such cases. As to
the recommendation of the president
concerning ship subsidies I do not
wish to commit myself until I have
seen the full text of the bills which
may be offered. My expressions have
not been favorable to legislation
granting bounties to ship owners,
and I do not believe the people of
South Dakota are friendly to the pin
ciple.
Representative Martin— "On the
subjects the president touches in his
message, his views are quits satis
itetory to me and to the western
country. I am disappointed that he
iias postponed most v: th-j impor
tant items until later messages. I be
ii ve this delay has somewhat weak
ened Lis position on tln^ij more ser
ious subjects. I am i" full accord
with the presidents views on pootal
savings banks and other subjects dis
cussed by him, except the ship sub
jsidy, which I am opposed to The
president's interpretation of the, au
thority of the tariff commission is
'very gratifying and a decided ste
I in the direction of gathering imomia
tion l'cr tariff purposes."
Representative Burl'?.—"I am es
pecially pleased with the president's
statement that to continue the dis
cussion of the tariff revision would
be harmful to the business interests
of the country, and I am glad he came
out squarely in discouraging further
legislation on the tariff at this time,
in the main it is a message such as
would be expected from Taft, con
servative, and yet he shows he expects
to take a stand and support legisla
tion in favor of the people."
MENS? CLUB ORGANIZATION.
The club which was started a
month or so ago with the idea of giv
ing some study to questions of a
municipal nature held its' third meet
ing Friday night in Rev. Harnett's
study and the plan for more definite
organization was carried out.
The following officers were elected
for the ensuing year: President,
George Rew vice president, S. G.
Boyce secretary and treasurer, F.
a
Among other things decided upon
was that the club should be called
The Mens' Club. It was also voted
that hereafter until further notice
the meetings of the club would be
held In the Y. M. C. A. room at the
city hall, the room known as the
land office room. The club was' able
to do this through the kindness of
Secretary Whittaker of the Y. M. C.
A.
The next meeting of the club will
be next Friday evening, December
17th, at 7:30 p. m. The meeting will
close at 10 o'clock.
The Mens' Club cordially invites
any men who are interested in the
study or discussion of such subjects
to come to this meeting. The topic
for discussion last evening was
"Jails" and after some interesting
contributions along that line from
some of the members, the president
was asked to appoint a committee
wfcose duty would be' to look into
local conditions and report at the
next meeting. The discussion of
"Jails" Will be continued at the next
meeting. ...r
F. B. Barnett, Secretary.
VESSEY ON TAFT'S MESSAGE.
Pierre, S. D., Dec. 13.—Governor
Vessey on being asked his views on
HI
I
57
the message of President ftlt, gave
out the following: "That message re
cently transmitted to coiigress by
President Taft is, generally speaking
a comprehensive one. The decided
stand taken In regard to reducing
the cost of administration Is import
ant and especially so In connection
with the army, and navy depart
ments.
5
"The formation of a tariff board
and Its compilation of an encyclo
paedia of the terms used and articles
embraced In the tariff law is judi
cious. I appreciate the statement
that there will be a revision of the
tariff law if it should result that the
platform pledges are not observed or
are Insufficient.
"The especial attention which the
Sherman Anti-Trust and similar laws
will receive is commendable. The
LIFE AT PUKWANA.
Pukwana, Dec. 13.—The school
children had a week of vacation last
week on account of the heating piant
In the building failing to heat com
fortably. The best that could be
done was to raise the temperature
40 degrees, and it failed to satisfy
the children. During the week sev
eral changes were made In the system
and it is believed that it will be In
working order in a few days. Con
tractor Skog claims to have followed
the specifications to the letter in in
stalling the plant.
Mr. and Mrs. H. R. Sanborn will
upend the winter months at Los An
geles, Cal., hating departed for that
place a few dayB ago. Mrs. Sanborn
had her Mitchell touring car shipped
ahead, and she will have it for use
during the winter.
Mrs. John Van Gamp has been vis
iting at the Hagerman home for the
past three months and returned to
her home at Washington, 111., stretch
ing a three weeks' visit into that
many months.
Harry Wentty Is expected to re
turn home shortly and take charge
of the Press. He has sold his paper
at Rapid City, and hereafter expects
to. devote his entire time to Interests'
in Pukwana.
-vW'
attitude taken In regard to postal eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee**
savings banks should receive gen
eral approval, inasmuch as their es
tablishment would put Into circula
tion much money that is now depos
ited in safety vaults and, thus, in
active.
"The so-called white slave traffic
is assuming mammoth proportions
and deserves the mention it haB re
ceived.
'-'t
"I trust that the message which
will be sent to congress later regard
ing the Improvement of our water
ways will be one that will receive the
approbation of the entire Mississippi
valley delegation.

Government Report on South Dakota
Explains Moisture in Soil That,
Rain Doesn't Produce.
Washington, Dec. 13.—Dr. W. J.
McGee of the bureau of soils of the
department of agriculture has sub
mitted to Secretary Wilson a report
on investigations he made recently
of the relation of soil water to pro
ductivity in South Dakota. In his
conclusions, Dr. McGee says in part:
"In central South Dakota rainfall
averages' little more than 15 Inches,
yet subsoil and cretacious shales
below are moist to a degree evidently
greater than can be ascribed to that
precipitation. The region is artesian,
flowing wells occurring wherever
shales are drilled through to Dakota
sandstone, hundreds or thousands of
feet below—the sandstone outcrop
ping in the foot hills of the Rocky
benaath the younger shales.
"While shales form a confining
stratum or cover for the sandstone,
they are more or less pervidlous and
under the hydrostatic head' of hun
dreds of thousands of feet part of
the water escapes upward to exude
slowly at the surface, and evapor*
ates either directly or through the
action of growing plants. While the
quantity of water supplied by this
natural subirrigation system has not
been measured, it is estimated at an
inch per month or a foot a year
which, with the fifteen inches of
rainfall, suffices for'moderate produc
tivity.
"The conditions extend beyond,
South Dakota, throughout a consider
able portion of the Great Plains', af
fecting an area of several million
acres. This is a region of successful
dust mulching (or dry farming) for
a dust layer at the surface not only
retains much of the moisture deriv
ed from rainfall, but conserves the
subterranean supply for the use of
crops. This season's work shows
that productivity and habitability of
the Great Plains are greatly increas
ed by natural subirrigation, which
renders available for agriculture not
only local precipitation, but part of
the rain descending on a nearly equal
area of broken country extending
westward into the mountains."
