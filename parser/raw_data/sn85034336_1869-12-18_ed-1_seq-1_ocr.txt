The Message.
.The great length of the mes
sage .Of, the President precludes]
aiiything more --ran a cursory
view of the points of chief inte
rest.
Oil the reconstruction question
the President utters some fine
senitimll'ents anld recoInInIends some
extraordillary acts.. He advises
the admiission of Virginia on the t
basis- of the- election held last
sllnlier, and that of Texas and
Aihssis'lippi arlt tho- basis of the
recent electionis. At the samine
time he advises -the-.re eacing of,(
Georgia in a sort of territorial
condidtili, "by constrairiiilg 'hler to
iadlapt her legislatiou to the inter
pretatioiis of Congress of what
she nought to ido, and the require-'(
meats of party, which she must (
do to merit favor.
While the President favors - ad
missiou for the three States, aid!-I
proliolces t lie coinstitution adopt
ed in Georgia to be "republican
in form,'-'i he. ad(vse: the-ver
throw of the State constitutiou by,
a-ct of Congress, mi'd hig politiial
friends ]meet him, by engineering
to keep. put tho~s who ougiht to
be in; ai] tfanor his action fo
wards G'eorgia on the opposite
plea, that its Government is not
leiubliican. Considering these
contraries, the ,.essag(L cannot
be thoi~tght Ofhre an. 1roiit1iou
1 eariing.-ou a sati.sfictory settle
nient of these questions. The
soft wordis of the Pres'ident are
not agreeable to his friieds, and
their hard acts will evid-utly be
accepted by Iimn.
lie is enamored of the happy
(gffet cc of -reeonistrcetion on the
1a4bor qLuestion; and somebody has
induced lhim to say of the negroes .
that "iio complhiiints. a'e. made, of
)4c k oft.iiflfltt~y when-they bL~ie
'fair comil)t':saion 1 for their labor."
i-Some of the time spenrt ini j.=nket
ing abiout last suniuner night have
jest, it which v .1 1 a uppears to be
remarklnbly deficient about i otio
rionus i tts. - .. .
It is also rather rash in him to
say lhat "the loss otf our coll- -
g crece is oIly- the result -of theo.
-Ate .c'heh.Illiti." Ve-ry few\ men
,4-ncinr with hiun in that opliuiot.
There were other c:auses, and
amrono the c ief t le bad legisla
tiolt-of his party frieul.
s He is in favor ol a restfllmtion
of sp,.ecie pnayments "''t thle ca li -.
est ira('tical ..lllWut, con.sitent .
-vith a Tffq r am"d tci the 'interest i
of t h," de ltorhlass;"' but "iume-i
djati ,.resumnption, ifp tlractical, i1 uotL .
(lesirab)lb." Tpth these coinuilo i
phwio.<, he suggests one step to
¶Ivrld Bnaking a gradual return to
specie paynenats; which is to au
Lotovize the Treasury to biuy 111) its
own: papecr "at a fixed price"
when Ir'es;etite'd, and to withhold
the same frnom circulation until
s9ld aga.in for goldl. ln other
words, the President's idea of li 1 I
itest means for attainLigr a good
-eirreicy and maintaining the na
tioital credit-is to turn broker iin
gold, buy tp its own papcr at de
irc'Ci::ted :rates, aindl sell it agaiiin
at a pi'offt. With what face the i
advocate of sunch a plan can ever
talk of repudiation as dlishouora- I
ble, it is diliieult to conceive.
As a liuacial mnieastire, in aid
of the Treasunry, the President re
eonlmends the plan, which has
been advocated., cxtensivtcly,.. in a
pamnthlet "`aeged~ fr-om Paris for
the issuing of new bons, at a
rate of iintorest not exceeding 4-1
!per ce(it., lay:ll): t , tlite olption of
the ho!lier, at atny of the moiney
centres in IEurope or the United
Staitos, with which to take up
matur -i ng bonds..
This ltlan is likely to have con
siderablel support in Congress, if,
which e",)upetent fianeciers ihoubt,
it shnll be thonghtr practicabnle.
lThe Inii-eCmsge reconmmiends a
reiiewal of the tax on income re
duced to 3 per cent.
Sit is opposed to a general revis
ion oilhe tariff, and uadvises post
ponement until another Congress,
and uatil after the debt is fmunded.
The hfigh tariff men will be very
well content with this new lease
of their unjust profits.
Relations with Spain concern
ing .Ouba- are dilated upon, with
this general result-that the Gov
ernment of the United States feels
the same interest in the contest
of Cuba with Spain that it felt
for former Spanish colonies in a
like struggle; but there is no de
facto government of the insurg
cunts sufficiently organized to be
treated as belligerent. In this
connection Oen. Grant makes the
following announcement of doc
trines, of which the British Gov
ernment will promptly take no
tice, as bearing on Alabama
claims controversy:
"'The principle is maintained,
however, that this nation is its
own judge wheni to accord rights
of belligerency, either to a people
strugghn g to free themselves
from a government they believe
to be oppressive, or to. independ,
cut nations at war with each
other."
The matter of the arrest of the 1
Spanish gunboats is explained by 4
attributing it, in the first place, to
the representations of the Pernuvi
an Government,. The Pernvian a
Government having taken no ]
steps to have the boats detained,
the President, nevertheless, did
not feel authorized to detain them
by executive order; anti therefore
tur.ned the questioil over to thle
courts. This is a very lame ex1
pIlanation. The President issues
an executive order, but does not
feel afitlhorized to ainul it by an
other order, because that wiould
release the vessels; as -if the rethrte
tion- of the vessels was the prime
object of the order instead of the
enuforcement of a law.
The reason is the true one, but
we did not expect to see it so
pilainly counfissed in the message.
There are many minor .topics
in the massage to be nmeuitioned
hereafter, which. Will be -of hii
p:)rtance if Congress does not, by
counter legislation, show they
have taken the President at his
word, to have "no policy" for him
self.
.... .- ..
Forney's Press is growing can
did, and intimates -thait the recent
expre'sions :attribute.id to Gen.
Grant.t, relative to the persecution
of the Israelites in Russia, :aiae
(luite as applicable nearer home.
The Press says: "IThe decidedly
A.nmeriecai tone of the. Prosident's
reply, has attracted, considerable
coimiellt t in diplomatic circ iCs,
and the opinion is gOnellly ex
pi'essed that it iisa defiite confirn-.
atina of the assertion recentll .
ima~te ijiroad that the pircsomt A.d
i-ni il'satiton intends making the
influence of our govierltneit ap
lirl'enit is a mediitor in behalf of
all classes who are suifering from
the -oppression of Imperial gov
crnments." TWhereon the Phila
d4';lhia Age says 1"'e do i:ot
know any civilized country in
which there are so many peoplh
suiftving from the oppressions of
Inu)erial governments, as in these
United States. Iii the Asiatic
p rovinces of Turkey, there may
be I'aechas and Governors as as a
solute as our nuilitify comnnanl
ers at the South, but in no coun
try that has ever known civil
justice or constitutional law is
there such a state of things ex
isting. Here 'Gen. Grant has
considerable power to abate the
evil. In Russia he can only offer
diplonmatic relnostrances, aLl we
sincerely hope that they will not
be inet by a refreriice to the ccl
ehrated order of Gen. Ulysses S.
G(rant, expelling tile Jews front
his lines. 1\Vlat i' want to ..,
rid of in this country is military
u;urlvation, from which every in
terest iay, in its turn, suftlr."
The Clarksville Tobacco Leaf
reluests tilhe press of tile South
to "pass around" one Captaiu'G,
V. A\hl, now traveling "in the
South as ' dlrurimer fior the boot
anid shoe house of S. hi. Po~meroy
& Co., Cincinnati. Thismtin Ah!
was in charge of thlie Yankee pris
on at Fort .Delaware during the
war, andi his cruelty to the Con
federate prisoners undler his charge
excels anything in the black his
tory of human fiendishness.
Dick Busteed, the dirty carpet
bagger who disgraced the judi
ciary of Alabama, is to be im
peached by Congress for high
c(rilms and misdemeanors. Served
hi;n right.
Specie Payments.
The policy of the Administra
tion on the subject of resumin g
specie payment, and which has
been a imatter of much specula
tion, is set forth in the President's
message with probably as much
clearness as could be expected
from that official. The principles
enunciated are sound, and in
striking contrast with the views
of that not insignificant class
who have endeavored to prove
the great blessings of a paper
currency and who urge a still fur
ther increase in its volume. With
reference, however, to the plan
by which specie. payments should
be eistored, Cono-ress is wisely
referred to the iflferent Writers
cin political economy forguidace.
The only' .positive suggestion is
on the :subject of putting a -stop
to the fluctuation in the value of
currency~ in the interinm, to accom
pllish which the treasury is to
purchase any of its own palier at
a fixed price on demand from the
hokler, and hold the currency
'thus redeemed to *be sold again
for gold. In other words, the
Seeretary of' the Treasury is to
dictate to the country what it
slhdl consider the value of a dol
.lar .in grCeiiebaks, and if the hold
er desires to convert his currency
into gold, fhe has hut to apply to
- the Government and obtain the
1- specie. Instead of selling ar cer
- tals amount of gold, weekly or
Smonthly,, it is to.be offered to any
one who desires to purchase at a
fixed premium. That such a
6 course would check speculation.
except in extreme cases would
seem probable, for all speculation
Sdepends ultimately upon the law
I of supply and denmand.
• *' Our Next Oensus. -
The New- York Tribune says
that Dr.' Jarvis, of Boston, has
been guessing at the results of
our eninth census, which will be
taken next summer--probably in
Juae. :He.guesses that th6 total
d'opulatiou of the United States
(excxhilding Iqrdians not taxed)
will be 3.9,313, 115, whereof 4,664,
418 will be colored. As tlhf total
population in 1860 *as -31,443,790
She pstimated increase exeeed,
e'iht millions. and is considerably:
.bov~^ t c enty-five per cent. Con-.
sidering that we have had four
years of dlesper:fe, 'bloody civil
war dn.this dcad(le; this 'increase
ius.t be deemed remarkable; everl
i'diuittin g that., we owe a good
share of it to immigration.
We doubt that tlho colored pop
ulatioti wil 'he found so numerous
as I)r. Jarr.ms estimates. While
we do, iot;credit half that is re
ported of their licentionsness, dis
si.ipattion and excessive mortality,
we preisumne+e that the gefieaIl
break-ulp of homes and habits re
sulting froli emancipation in the
midst of civil war has precluded
any eonsiilerable increasoe of their
nunlmber since 1860, when thdy
were returned-as
l:--vc- ............ ------ - -- ----- ....397 ,
. To.. ................. ....... .4,441.706
-Not being re-enforced, as the'
whittu's so. strongly are, by a .vig
orous and jproliii- immigration,
we doubt that the colored total
next year will exceed 4,500,000.
R~ lo.)m r MEAc~runR-One of the
fuirst and most imlnportaint measures
of legislation in Congress is that
several l)rolmineu t members will
try to get through a.bill to pre
vent persons who contest seats
'from drawing pay from the publici
treasury. As the law now is any
man who is defe~ated at an elc.
Stion can trum)p ulip chargcs on
Swhich to contestt the scat, and theln
-comm herIe and live durinig the
winter frc of expense. T''lere
t will be over thlirty cises thl.swin
r ter, and the cost to the Gover
Smoant will be.7 over one hunrded
thousand dollars.
