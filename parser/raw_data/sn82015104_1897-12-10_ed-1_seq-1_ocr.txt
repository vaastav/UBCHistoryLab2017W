SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 9.— J. W.
Fred, aged 21 years, of Woodland, was
found dead in his room at the New
Western Hotel this morning, under cir
cumstances which tend to the belief
that he committed suicide by asphyxia
tion with illuminating gas.
After he left the hotel yesterday af
ternoon it was discovered that he had
left one of the gas jets open, and he
"was warned upon his return to be more
careful. This morning, as he failed to j
appear at breakfast, a bell boy was
sent up to his room to awaken him.
Receiving no response to his frequent ,
knocks, the boy climbed up to the tran
som and discovered that Fred was :
still in bed. The door was then forced
open, and both gas jets were found to ,
be turned on, and the room filled with j
gas. Fred had evidently been dead j
for some hours. No cause is known j
lor the suicide.

he left here Wednesday morning he
said he was going to get work in San ;

FORT WHIPPLE.
Governor McCord Protests Against
Its Abandonment.
PHOENIX (Ariz.), Dec. o.—Governor
McCord has telegraphed the Secretary
of War, protesting against the aban
donment of Fort Whipple, suggested in
the last report of the War Department.
"Whipple is now the only military
post in Northern Arizona, and is es
sential," the Governor declares, "to
the protection of half of the Territory's
expanse, a district constantly exposed
to deeds of outlawry and embracing
the reservations of thousands of Indi
ans, against whose occasional turbu
lence nothing but military force is ever
effective. Even now there is a serious
and perhaps dangerous irritation
among the Navajos, with or without
cause. The National Guard is of slight
strength in Northern Arizona, and the
abolishment of the fort would be an
error, and a costly one for the Govern
ment, and I urge that the suggestion
be withdrawn."
NAVAL RESERVES.
The State Will Furnish Their Uni
forms.
SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. 9.—General
John H. Dickinson. Chairman of the
Uniform Roard, announced to-day that
the beard would soon advertise for bids
for uniforms for the naval reserves,
and that the State would furnish uni
forms of as good quality as those se
cured by the National guardsmen. It
has been customary for the Govern
ment to supply the reserves with uni
forms, but the placing of the resj>onsi
bility in the hands of the Uniform
Board is calculated to cause more satis
faction and insure much better uni
forms. All six divisions of the State
will be supplied.

TWO REPUBLICS MAY GO

Nicaragua Refuses to Receive Cap
tain Merry and Honduras
Against Dr. Huuter.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. —The De
partment of State is able to press
to the end the issue that has been
raised between it and the Government
of Nicaragua growing out of the re
fusal of Nicaragua to receive a United
States Minister in the, person of Cap
tain .Merry of California. The United
States Legation at Managua, which',
lias been closed through the absence!
of the resident Minister, will be per
mitted to remain closed for the pres
ent, and Captain Merry has been or
dered to proceed to San Juan, in Costa
Rica, to take up his mission there.
i >r. Hunter of Kentucky, who has
been appointed Minister to Guatemala
partroent to-day7and having received
his final instructions, will sail from
Mow York on the 20th inst. He goes
to Guatemala City the Capital of
Guatemala, but as his case is in many
respects similar to that of Captain
Merry it is probable that he will be
confined in his Ministry to that coun
try, and will not be received in Hon
credited. In that case Honduras will
also be without a United States Le-
The trouble arises from the fact that
when the Greater Republic was formed
it was agreed among the party nations
that their relations be conducted
through a Diet, and they insisted that
Ministers from other countries should,
be accredited to this PHet. Congress
had divided the Mission of Central
\ trice la such a fashion that each of
the two Missions includes a country
within and one without the Greater
Republic. This fact was rvp»ugnant to
< >wh:g to the terms of our Appropria
tion Act, the President was obliged to
accredit the Ministers to the countries
SSmed la the Act—Captain Merry to
Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and Dr.
and had no authority to accredit them
to the Diet. So the persistence that
Nicaragua and Honduras have shoWfl
in Their position has resulted In de
priving of them of the presence of any
I nited States Minister, and threatens
to do the same with the other. In
this case, it will t>o interesting to note

SPAIN PREPARED TO
DEFEND HER HONOR.
Will Permit of No Intervention in
Cuban Affairs.
Any Such Attempt by the United States
Would be Resisted.
Home Rule for Cuba, Sovereignty
to Spain and Reciprocity With
the United States the Pro
gramme as Defined by the Au
tonomists to Insure Tranquility
and Prosperity in the Island.
MADRID, Dec. 9.—At a Cabinet
council to-day, the Queen Regent pre
siding, Premier Senor Sagasta outlined
the opinion of the European press re
garding President MeKinley's message,
the majority of which were favorable
to Spain.
He further declared that in the event
of the United States attempting to in
tervene in Cuba, it would find the Gov
ernment prepared to defend the rights
and honor of Spain. As to the military'
operations in Cuba, the Premier in
formed the Cabinet that the results ob
tained were satisfactory. The Premier
also said he did not attach much im
portance to the "attitude of certain
Senators."
The "Imparciai" says to-day that it
takes it for granted that the Govern
ment will make preparations to meet
the intervention threatened by Presi
dent McKinley, adding: "If the new
loan for the reorganization of the navy
is Boated, it is sure to succeed. The
responsibility of the Government is
enormous, if it fails to profit by the
opportunity offered to place the country
in a position to defend its interests."
The "Et Globe" confirms the reports
that the Government "is making prep
arations to meet the intervention."
General Weyler is quoted from Bar
celona as saying he considered Prosi
dent MeKinley's hostility to be the most
glorious compliment which could be
paid him, "when coming from Spain's
enemy." The General further remark
ed that he would make a statement in
the Cortes in order to defend his policy.
CUBAN PROGRAMME DEFINED.
NEW* YORK, Dec. 9.—Home rule for
Cuba: for Spain, sovereignty; for the
United States, reciprocity. The pro
gramme is defined. If carried out it
mis'ht insure years of tranquillity and
prosperity m the Antilles, says the cor
respondent of the "Tribune" in Ha
vana.
Until the first point is settled the last
one is necessarily inchoate. It does not
form part of the public discussion of
autonomy. Only the few thoughtful
men who are looking beyond the poli
tics of to-day make it a cardinal fea
ture in the Cuban policy of the future.
Except for the fall in sugar it is con
tended by thoughtful men the abuses
of Spanish colonial misgovernment in
the island would have been endured
until corrected. In prosperity the
weight of corrupt and oppressive ad
ministration did not seem to bear so
heavily. In adversity it became un
bearable. With concessions from Spain.
Which promised to give Cuba its own
Government, the economic conditions
again become prominent, and commer
cial relations with the United States
are the basis of all the plans for im
provement.
A vide gulf must first be bridged
with autonomy before force can be
given to these ideas. The gulf man
ner :r be spanned, l>ecause support at
either end by Spanish partisans and
Cuban revolutionists is wanting; yet
the suggestion of reciprocity is signifi
cant of the future relations of the
island to the. United States. The Cu
bans, who declare the revolution must
go on until independence is won, have
theories of their own. One of these
is that broader and more stable reci
procity will be secured to the United
States if it treats with the Cuban re
public Instead of with a colony of
Spain. That is their answer.
It should not be understood that the
representatives of the Spanish Cabinet
in Cuba are concerning themselves with
these matters of economy. It is the
men of theories who are doing that.
Captain-General Blanco has too much
immediate Work to look so far ahead.
To undo what Weyter has done in mal
administration is a huge task in itself.
Something of this labor has been ac
complished In administrative offices
but this has little bearing on the main
question. The places are filled by men
who are in sympathy with the Gov
ernment, and who will loyally help to
carry out its plans. These are details
More Important is the reapproaohment
of the political parties. The Madrid
correspondents of th« Havana journals
describe the Sagasta Ministry in the
enjoyment of its honeymoon.
INDEPENDENCE OR DEATH
NEW YORK, Dec. 9.-A proclama
tion signed by the Cuban militaty and
civil leaders in Havana Province, pro
testing against the autonomy offered
by Spain, was recently issued, as re
ported by the correspondent of the As
sociated Press. The proclamation in
full follows:
"Cubans: Aft. r nil her efforts to sub
due us by force of arms have proved in
vain. Spain offers autonomy to the Cu
ban people. She expects to induce us
to submit anew to her rule under pre
tended terms of peace.
"Spain's pretension is useless. The
time is already past to think of such
compromise and transaction. Opposed
to them in an insurmountable manner
are the dignity and manifest destiny of
our country; the outrages inflicted
upon our families: the torrents of Cu
ban blood that have been shed; the
Uvea go man? innocent human be
ings who have succumbed to oppres
the sacred memory of our heroes
who bm-TS tSed In defense of their na
tive soil, and all other sorts of sacri
fices we have made in behalf of our in
dependence. To obtain this w e have
again taken up arms, and we are de
termined to continue unhesitatingly in
the task of redeeming our country until
we attain the success which is near at
hand. We shall not flinch in our ef
fort, nor is it possible that we be for
saken by the God of Justice in our sa
cred undertaking.
"Let the world at large be aware
that this is our unalterable purpose;
our only and constant aspiration; our
supreme ideal, to which we have con
secrated our lives, our property, pres
ent welfare, and, in short, our all. Let
the world know our full determination
to carry on the struggle day after day
while the Spanish Hag floats over our
beloved country. Let everybody know
that our watchword is independence or
deaths Cubans, long live Cuba, free
and independent."

DOINGS IN RAILWAY CIRCLES.
WARM FIGHT OVER HANDLING
OF MILEAGE TICKETS.
Demoralization in Through Rates
to Alaska Likely—New Tour
ist Sleeping-Car Service.
CHICAGO, Dec. 9.—At the meeting
of the Mileage Ticket Bureau of the
Central Passenger Association, which
was held to-day, a large sized fight
developed over the handling of the in
terchangeable mileage tickets.
The Lake Shore and the Michigan
Central championed a resolution to al
ter the method in which the tickets
are sold at present. The plan now in
effect is for the traveler to present his
ticket to the ticket agent, announcing
how far he deHres to travel. The
ticket agent tears from the mileage
book the required number of miles, and
issues to the traveler the ticket, which
is good on the train.
The Michigan Central and the Lake
Shore desired that the interchangeable
ticket be made good for transporta
tion when presented nil trains, and a
number of the other lines objected to
this. There was the warmest kind of
a tight, and it lasted for the greater
part of the day, but the resolution was
lost when the matter came to a final
vote, twenty of the roads voting
against it and eight for it.
The Western roads have for some
time been fighting earnestly on the
business that is expected to set in in
the late winter and early spring to
ward Alaska. 1 They have been doubt
ful whether the purchasers of trans
portation wotild wish to buy tickets
through to Dawson City, or only to
the ports on the Pacific Coast, and to
day the roads took their first action
bearing on the question of Alaska
rates. They have decided to get out
their rate sheets showing through rates
to Alaska, and will ignore entirely the
claims of the Canadian Pacific for a
differential on the business. The rates
of the Canadian Pacific will not, in
fact, be shown on the sheet at all.
In the days of the old Transcontinen
tal Passenger Association the Canadian
Pacific was allowed a differential of
fS on its Pacific Coast business, and it
claims the same now, but the roads of
the old association and those of the
Wi -tern Passenger Association, as
well, ray that the dissolution of the
old organisations after the promulga
tion of the Supreme Court decision re
garding the formation of pools and as-
BOCiariORS absolved them from all fur
ther Obligations to allow the differen
tials to the Canadian Pacific. The lat
ter road has never seen the matter in
that light, and will make a fight that
is very likely to demoralize the rates
to Alaska and the North Pacific Coast
points.
The Executive Committee of the
Western Passenger Association held a
meeting to-day, but did not accomplish
anything of interest, its time being
taken up by the considi ration of rou
tine matters 1 . It is expected that it
will get after the large matter to-mor
row.
During the past three days the Bal
timore and Ohio, the Baltimore and
Ohio Southwestern, Illinois Central and
the Southern Pacific officials have been
in consultation in Chicago, and to-day
it was announced that a tourist sleep
ing car line would be started on De
cember 15th from P3ttsbursr to San
Francisco without change, via Cincin
nati, I.v: uisville and New Orleans. The
service is to be weekly, and oftener if
necessary, the cars leaving on W< d

WHEAT GOES UP
WITH A RUSH.
Reaches the Highest Point at Chi
cago Since 1891.
Sales Made as High as $1 03 Per Bushel
for December Delivery.
Lively Bidding and Great Excite
ment in the Pit—Other Grain
and Provision Markets More or
Less Influenced by the Rapid
Advance in Wheat.
CHICAGO, Dec. 9.—Not since Au
gust, 1891, has any month's delivery
of wheat sold as high as December did
to-day. It rose from 101% at the open
ing to 109, but in ir\c*>t irregular fash
ion. It hud many a sudden backward
slide, but in the end it rested at 107,
Or the net increase of 0 3 4 C for the day.
January was a good second, winding
up with a gain of o cents. May was
less demonstrative in its bullishness.
Its advance was I%c a bushel. Other
grain and provision markets were more 1
or less influenced by the advance in
Wheat. Corn and oats closed ; * s c high
er each and provisions 5@7%c higher.
Wheat was very nervous at the start.
Shorts were evidently alarmed by the
announcement that the bull clique had
made arrangements to ship by rail all
the wheat delivered them on December
contracts, and had also made advan
tageous storage contracts in the East.
The consequence Was there was a host
of buying orders for December at the
opening*, mostly of moderate lots, it is I
true, but they had the same effect on
the already strained market as if they
were for millions. There was no wheat
for sale.
December closed yesterday at .SI 00 1/ t .
but the opening ranged all the way
from !>1 01*4 to -SI 04, and at the top
there was scarcely a bushel to be had.
This precipitated a perfect scramble
among the shorts, not in December
only, but in January and May also.
Before wheat came out £1 05 was
offered for December. Then came a
lull which lasted for an hour. The
brokers operating for the bull clique
attempted to stem the tide, but prob
ably from 200,000 to 250,000 was taken
before a reaction occurred. December
declined to -Si 03%, but by 11:45 had
again risen to -SI 05.
Then came the storm. Within five
minutes, and amid a whirl of excite
ment, December was bid to $1 08. It
reacted with a jerk to .SI 06%, then
up again without a stop to SI <j9, the
highest point bid for wheat in this
mark ?t in six years. Probably as
much wheat was sold on this advance
as on the earlier one. After that the
market was quieter.
January shorts in the meantime had
not been idle. That month opened
strong at from 93@94c, and it sold a.s
high as 07c during the excitement, an
advance of 5%0 since yesterday. It
was figured that the influences con
trolling December also applied to Jan
uary, and the shorts got under cover
as quickly as they could.
.May was also very strong, though it
did not have the same panicky appear
ance as the other positions. It open
ed at 91@91%c, as compared with yes
terday's closing price of 90%@90%c,
and had advanced by noon to 92%53
92% c
If ttie market at the opening had
been left as usual, to take its imprint
from those things that usually affect
it, a decline would in all probability
have occurred. Liverpool opened firm
at an advance of %d, and closed only a
shade higher, although they must have
known before the end of the session
of the early considerable strength of
the market here.
Reports of rain Interfering with the
harvesting of wheat in Argentine, and
that the exportable surplus would be j
red iced in consequence, was one of
the items of the day's news that, like i
a good many more, received very little
attention,
December during the final hour's;
trading moved irregularly between
$1 ON and M 07, closing nervously at!
the latter price. May had reacted to \
92%e at the close, while January
wound up at 94% c
ST. LOUIS MARKET AFFECTED.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 9.—The bulge in
wheat at Chicago to-day showed its
effebt here. December opened at 99%e i
bid, advanced J Ac soon after, and later I
sold up to SL The advance in Chicago
caused some uneasiness amonsr the
shoris here, and they began to cover.
This, with a good demand that had
developed, started the price upward,
and it shortly touched ?i 01',. Later
a jump to $1 02 was recorded. A re- j
action set in, and the price dropped to!
£1 01%, but just before the close the;
market became strong and the top!
price, $1 02, was touched again. The j
close was at that figure bid.

THE PRESIDENTS MOTHER.
She is Still Liugering at the Point
of Death.
CANTON (O.). Dec. 9.—The day has
been almost devoid of incident in the
room of Mrs. McKinley, who still lin
gers at the point of death. Her rest
during the day seemed a tritle less
peaceful than heretofore, and at times
she experienced trouble in breathirg.
the trouble being accompanied by ap
parent distress in the throat, the di
rect evidence of which was an ominous
rattle.
This evening President McKinley
thought his mother had failed very
rapidly during the day, and she was
so weak that the end could not much
longer be delayed, and he was prepared
for tn<? dissolution at any moment. He
had been at the bedside nearly all day.
and will remain there at least until
midnight. Ho took but a few hours'
sleep this morning, and with his broth
er, Abner, took a short walk during
the day.
The patient has taken no nourish
ment since Monday, and has not even
taken a. sip of water for many hours.
That she retains life so long without
any nourishment is the most surprising
feature of the case.
At 11:90 o'clock to-night Mrs. Mc-
Kinley was still living, but very weak.
Otherwise there was no change in her
condition when the doctor left her,
probably for the last time, to-night.
He had some hope of her surviving the
night, but said the ense had reached
that point where it was impossible to
make any prediction with tho slight
est assurances of certainty.
Th;? family is very apprehensive, and
entertain only slight hopes of the pa
tient surviving the night. They fear a
relapse at any moment, which in the
present condition could scarcely be
survived. The patient lies quietly, and
at times shows scarcely any evidence
of animation.
CANTON (O.), Dec. 10—At 2 o'clock
everything was quiet at the McKinley
residence. The family had evidently
retired for the night.

paring Evidence.
WASHINGTON, Dec 9.—The Rritish
and Venezuelan agents are hurrying to
completion their briefs, which must be
presented, with all evidence and argu
ments, by Febuary 14th next to the
arbitrators in the boundary dispute.
The tribunal, which is considered fully
organized, though its members have
not met each other, will not assemble
to receive the briefs, but it has been
arranged by correspondence to hold
sessions in Paris, beginning next July,
and the hope is expressed of being able
to arrive at a decision before the arbi
trators are compelled to adjourn for
their other duties in September.
The members are M. F. G. de Maer
tens, the Russian authority on interna
tional law, who is President: Chief Jus.
tiee Fuller and Justice Brewer, for the
United States, and Braon Herschell
and Sir Richard Henry Collin for Great
Britain. On or before February 14th
copies of the briefs and evidence will
be delivered to each of these Judges
and to the agents of both the disputing
Governments, who will then have until
May 14th to submit briefs in rebuttal,
which will constitute the final docu
ments in the case.

MEASURES TO COME
BEFORE CONGRESS.
House Leaders Said to Have Come
to an Understanding
As to the Course Which They Will Pursue
in the Near Future.
Appropriation Bills Will bo Dis
posed of as Fast as They Art-
Ready—Tho Bankruptcy Bill
Will bo Reported Before the
Holiday Recess. and When
Congress Reconvenes Will be
Accorded Advantage in the
Way of Securing Early Time
for Debate.
WASHINGTON, Dec. U.-Auhough no
forma] action ha* been taken, a pretty
general understanding has been reached
by the leaders in the ibd.se of It. pre
stntatives as to the course of a. Uon in
the near future. It includes the disposal
01 appropriation bills as fast as they are
ready. The bankruptcy bill will be re
port, d by Chairman Henderson of the
Judiciary Committee before the holiday
r«i oss, but will not be tak- n up by the
House until after the recess, it is
understood that Speaker Reed and tie
Committee on Rules will be disposed t"
give this bill all the advantage in the
way of securing early time for debate.
It is equally well understood
that for the present there
will be no effort to take up financial leg
islation on the Boor of the House. This
is due mainly to the fact that a strong
impression prevails among members of
the House that the Committee on Hank
ing and Currency will not be able to re
concile the many conllicting interests
inside the committee. These W nrf—ill!
all shades of the linancial subject, and
are so much at variance that it is n->t
expected a majority can be rallied for
any one proposition. Under such cir
cumstances, the purpose is to await the
action of the deadlock in that eommitt
When it becomes evident that the Com
mittee on Ranking and Currency is at a,
standstill, then the Ways and Means
Committee will frame a bill on broad
lines calculated to meet the present
financial requirements. In th - mean
time the subject will be kept in the hack
ground as much as possible.
Aside from the bankruptcy and appro
priation bills, some emergency mensures,
such as that relating to Retiring Sea,
introduced by Hitt, will have a hearing,
as they involve questions of general pol
icy, and are not likely to meet with op
position.
With these exceptions, the disposition
of the House leaders will be to keep
radical legislation to the rear.
FOREIGN QUESTIONS.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs of
the House of Representatives held its
first meeting to-day and outlined its
work on the several important foreign
questions now pending. Chairman Hitt
appointed the following sub-committ- c
to deal with Cuban aft airs: Adams of
Pennsylvania, Heatwole of Minnesota
and Perry of Kentucky. The sub-com
mittee to consider Hawaiian affair's is
Hitt of Illinois, Cousins of lowa and
Newlands or Nevada.
The committee determined to report at
once the bill prohibiting American citi
zens from conducting pelagic sealing in
Retiring Sea, and an understanding was
reached that the bill would be pushed to
final passage before the holidays.
Much interest was shown in the initial
meeting of the committee, as it was feit
that it might bring an Indication of the
general line of policy toward Cuba and
the other subjects before it. Except,
however, in the announcement of the
Cuban and Hawaiian sub-committees,
no reference was made to either of these
subjects, as all of the time of the com
mittee was given to the question of seed
ing in Behring Sea. On this question
considerable discussion occurred, which
showed a general sentiment toward re
stricting American sealers only in case
Great Britain adopts the same restric
tions.
The committee found plenty of ma
terial before it on all the important for
eign questions. These wen 1 in the forms
of bills and resolutions submitted dur
ing the extra session, but which could
rot be considered at that time, as the
committee had not been appointed.
On Cuba the phases of the subject
Si nted. Th most important of these was
the Morgan joint resolution which
passed the Senate at the extra session,
and was now referred to this committee.
It recognizes a state of war as existing
between Spain and the Cuban insur
gents, and declares that the United
States will maintain strict neutrality be
tween the two belligerents.
