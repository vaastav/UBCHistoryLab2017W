TOUR CITIES HAVE
COMMISSION FORM
Xaurel and Gulfport Join Hands With
Clarksdale and Hattles
burg.
The adoption of the commission
plan of government by the cities of
Laurel and Gulfport during the past
few days furnishes a striking illus
tration of the growth of sentiment in
favor of that plan among the larger
■cities and towns of the state.
Although statutory authority for
adoption of the commission plan has
existed in Mississippi since 1906, only
twt> cities, Clarksdale and Hatties
burg, had adopted the plan up to the
time elections were held at Laurel
and Gulfport, and in both of the latter j *
pities the commission system was giv- \ '
■en overwhelming endorsement.

Campaigns are now in progVess to
-secure the commission plan at Green
Yille and Meridian, two of the largest
cities in the state, and indications are
that the commission advocates will
1>e successful, although they are op
posed by the political forces that have
been in control for many years.
Jackson is also hankering for the
commission system, owing to the
large measure of dissatisfaction ex
isting among property-owners towards
the present municipal government,
•and it is quite likely that a campaign !
for change from the code chapter on
municipalities to the commission
plan will be launched after the first
of the year.
When the legislature meets in Jan- j
' uary several amendments to the sta
tutes defining the commission method
-will be presented for adoption, and in
event of their passage it is more than
likely that the municipal code chap
ter will be discarded in nearly all of
The larger cities and towns of the
State.
NEW VARIETY OF
THEATRICAL ENTERTAINMENT.
Jackson, Ga., Dec, 15.—Will Turner,
•"a negro preacher, was hanged in
'King's opera house here today for
killing Jesse Singley near Indian
Springs, Ga.. August 26. Only a few
newspaper men and officers and rela
tives of the man were present.
' Singley, a young white man, was
ambushed after trying to settle some
trôuble between hotel bell boys in
'which Turner's two sons were impli
cated.
Race trouble was narrowly averted
at that time. ,

State-Wide Interest In

throughout the state on Saturday for
the purpose of discussing cotton acre

for the coming year.

The majority of the jurors refused

Several of them had not made up

convinced Dr. Hyde would have been
acquitted, as many of the jurymen
j thought the state witnesses had been
coached.
Dr. Hyde received the dismissal of
the jury as he has every other unus

courtroom after the jury had been dis

It is estimated that the second trial
of Dr. Hyde, which would have closed

cost $75,000. About $10,000 of this

On January 7, 1912, certain of the
prominent Southeastern railroads will

Legislature May Raise The Pension
Apporpriation To $500,000.00
Per Annum.
V
Jackson, Miss,, Dec. 15.—The rather
astonishing fact that the United States
government distributes among Fed
eral pensioners in Mississippi each
year more than twice the amount paid
by the state to Confederate pension
ers is revealed in figures given out at.
Washington in connection with the
Sherwood bill, now pending in Con
gress for passage.
The pension disbursements to vet
erans of the Union army and navy,
widows and servants, amounts to
nearly $5,000 beenfleiaries.
The state pension fund distributed
among the Confederate soldiers and
sailors, widows and servants, is $36b,
000, divided among about 8,000 bene
ficiaries.
It is understood that at the ap
proaching legislative session an effort
will be made to have the Confederate
pension fund increased to $600,000
per annum.

This is no hoax. Moving day has ,

the local postoffice will be domiciled
in its handsome new building on West
Pine street. In the many moves made
by the postoffice during the last few
years this is the first one that the pub
lic has had any prior notice of and for
that very reason there may be some
among the skeptical, who though an
ticipating this information, yet are
wary in the novel knowledge of the
fact. The last move the office made
in that direction was accomplished
overnight and many of its patrons on
coming to work the next morning
were dumfounded at its strange dis
appearance and only after a diligent
search did they locate the new mail
house and have their anxiety, that
maybe the office had left town, remov

moved without the knowledge of the
clerks and they reported at the old
site to find it uninhabited.

London, Dec. 15.—Philip Edward
Morrell, Liberal in the House of Com
mons, today said that a poorer excuse
for taking away the independence of
Persia than that advanced in the case
of Mr. Shuster had never been put
forth in the House of Commons. The
exact, crime committed by Shuster,
said Mr. Morrell was that he did not
call at the Russian legation as often
as he ought to.
This statement was made after the
foreign secretary, Sir Edward Grey,

demand that the consent of the Brit

In joining her efforts with others to

be in prison while he remained free.
Another reason, she said, was that

WINONA, MISS., BANK
WINS BIG VICTORY.
Special to The News.
Jackson, Miss., Dec. 15.—The final
decree in the matter of W. P. War
field, trustee of the bankrupt estate
of the Blackston Mercantile Company,
of Winona, has been filed in the Fed
eral court and is a complete victory
for the bank. The decree is to the ef
fect that the trustee is not entitled to
recover $150,000 claimed by the trus
tee to be the amount paid over to the
bank by the corporation in preference
over other creditors. The Blackston
Mercantile Company was one of the
largest general stores in Mississippi.
It failed on December 31. 1910, leaving
a vast property almost worthless for
the benefit of
creditors.
The trustee, shortly after having |
set expert acocuntants at work on the !
books of the corporation, instituted i
suit against the Bank of Winona al- i
leging among other things that the
bank, through business dealings witn
the Blackstone Mercantile Company,
was recipient of the amount claimed.
It was charged that the amount so in
the hands of the bank was illegal, and
constituted a violation of the Federal
bankruptcy laws, in that the bank
rupt corporation gave the bank a pref
erence.

RUSSIA IGNORES
CONGRESS'ACTION
Llttle Interest Excited Over Abroga
tion Of American
Treaty.
St. Petersburg, Dec. 15.—The Jew
ish passport question has awakened
only slight public interests here. The
prospect of the abrogation of the
treaty of 1832 does not seem to dis
turb anyone.
the United States are duly appreciat
ed, especially as they affect the Far
East, but it is pointed out that Rus
sia and Germany waged a terrific war
in the 90's, during which they re
mained on good terms politically,
j The abrogation of the treaty would
j affect Russian trade to the extent of
j about $8,000,000 annually, whereas
j American trade to four times that
amount would be affected. Abroga
tion of the treaty, it is realized, would
strike a more vital blow if by reason
of this Russian subjects were Bhut out
of America. From the standpoint of
the Russian government to cessation
j of Jewish emigration would be very
I disagreeable but the government does
I not believe that the matter would be
I pressed so far.
On the other hand the government
sees a greater peril in the indiscrim
inate admission of Jews to Russia, as
many of these, it is asserted by gov
ernment officials, * are revolutionists,
Socialists and Anarchists. Their
ing, armed with American passports
and with the right to claim consular
aid, it is argued, would endanger the
public peace and cause ultimately
diplomatic friction and a serious ag
gravation of Russo-American rela
tions.
The Jewish question looms so large
in Russia proper that the question of
Russo-American relations take
ondary piace, and, finally, it is de
clared- Russia cannot surrender
trol over the admission of foreigners
These are the
representative views in government

STATE NEEDS
ANOTHER COURT
Appellate Court Bill To Be Urged
For Passage In The
Legislature. .
• räck<0 'b Miss;; Déc. iS Àccoràlng
to the a " vocates °f the plan to create
an aptK ' ,late court system in Missis
sippi, the criminal docket of the Su
preme Court for the December call,
to be submitted next Monday, fur
nished a striking illustration of the
necessity of such a tribunal in this
state.
The docket contains sixty-two cases,
appealed from the
various circuit
courts, and seventy-five per cent of
the cases are for misdemeanors.
It is contended that litigation of this
character should not occupy the atten
tion of the state's highest tribunal:
that it is an extravagant waste of
time to burden the Supreme Court
calendar with illicit retailing
similar misdemeanor
and
which
cases,
consume as much time as appeals In
which human lives are Involved.
The appellate court plan will be
urged before the legislature with
much insistance, and it is currently
reported that It will be given the en
