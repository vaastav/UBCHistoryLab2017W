' The President regrets the continu
ance 6f the unfortunate straggle in
Cuba, which seems "to be ho nearer n
aeosive result than it' -was a year agoi
ka.4 attributes it to a desire to pre

revenue for the current fiscal year.
The President recommends that no
further reduction of taxes bo made
until time has proved that it can be
safely done, and still provide sufS
cieut revenue to pay the interest on
tho public debt, maintain the sinking
fund, arid pay tho current expenses
ol tho Uovernment. Ine preserva-
of the national credit is urged as of
the first importance, and next to that,
to provide a currency of fixed value,
and as soon as possible, convertible
into gold duo regard being had for
the interests of the debtor class and
tha vicissitudes of trade and com-
mereo. ?

benefit to commerce.
THE SIGNAL SERVICE.
Ten additional stations have been
established in the TJ. States, and ar
rangements made for an exchange of

Recommendations of the Secretary of
WAR.
The favorable attention of Congress
is recommended to various suggest
ions of the Secretary of War, among
which are the followinc: the sale of
such arsenals east of the Mississippi as
can be spared, and the establishment
of one : large arsenal on the Atlantic
coast: a modification of the mode of
re-election of cadets for the Military
Academy ; authority to purchase sites
for : military posts in Texas : &c. &c
INCREASED FACILITIES FOR TRANSPORTATION
OF PRODUCTS.
' The President calls the attention
of Congress to "various enterprises
for the more certain and cheaper trans
portation of the constantly increas
ing surplus of Western and Southern
products to the Atlantic seaboard.
He mentions the proposed water route
to connect the Mississippi valley with
the Atlantic at Charleston or Savan
nah, "by way of the Ohio and Tennes
see rivers : and canal and slack-water
navigation to the Savannah and Oc
mulgee rivers, which has been sur
veyed and favorably reported on by an
officer of the army; also the proposed
extension of the Chesapeake & Ohio
Canal, and the Kanawha & James
River Canal to the Ohio river. He
suggests the' appointment of a com
mission to examine the whole subject
and report to Congress at a future
day. :'.- ;
THE NAVY.
Congress is earnestly recommended
to take prompt action for the preser
vation of - our navy, as without such
measures the TJ. States will soon be
the weakest of the great powers in
her naval equipment. : The suggest
ions of the Secretary of the Navy are
recommended and endorsed.
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.

Department for the last fiscal year,
was: $21,915,426 37, and the expendi
tures $26,658,192 21. The increased
revenue over the previous year was
$1,878,380 95, or 9.37 per cent, and
the increased expenditures were $2,
268,088 23,' or 9.29 per cent The
deficiencypaidoutof the general treas
ury for last year was $3,317,765 94,
an excess of $389,707 28 over the
previous year's deficiency.
. Improved postal arrangements have
been -.made with all the leading na
tions of Europe.'-; ' '
The President repeats his recom
mendation of ' the' abolition ' of the
franking privilege, or at leastaeor-
rection of its glaring abuses,
GOVERMENT TELEGRAPH.
. The, . President also recommends
the appointment of a commission to
inquire into the .best method of ac
quiring possession .. by. the Govern
ment of all the telegraph lines now in
operation, and connecting them with
the postal service. ..
AMERICAN OCEAN STEAMERS.
Contracts for carrying the mails are
recommended to be given to the three
existing lines of ocean steamers own
ed and operated under our flag; and
the expediency is suggested of extend
ing similar aid to other lines that have
not hitherto received it, especially to
a line between Panama and the west
ern ports of South America. .
OUR CARRYING TRADE.
,.. The large falling off .in our carry
ing trade for the last ten or twelve
years is referred, to, and liberal appro
priations are recommended with
new, to recover it if possible.--. The
President thinks that, .five millions
year for , the next five years would be
profitably expended, if. it would ac
complish the end in view, j. : .
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
;. The expenditures, of this depart?
ment; have been increased by ; lawless
combinations in some sections of the
Union to deprive one class of citizens
of their rights under the 14th Amend
ment to the Constitution ; but the
punishment of many of these offend
ers has tended greatly to the repres
sion of such disorders ; and the Pres
ident . expresses his. confident hope
that the time is not far distant when
unlawful combinations for such objects
wl cease, and further prosecutions
jjecome unnecessary., Should it be
necessary, however, he declares his
intention to continue to enforce, the
laws with.vigor, against all "combina
tions" or conspiracies to disturb the
peace of the conntry. .

IIY,LSBORU17C.II. OHIO.
Thursday,
Dec. 12, 1872.
Congress is reorganizing the Com
mittees and preparing to go to vcork
vigorously after the holidays.
JL C. ilitchell, the,. United States
Senator elected from Oregon, ' to
succeed Corbett, will be the youngest
man in the Senate, being only about
tliirty-six years of age.
Miss Ida Greeley has much grief
to endure. She mourns the loss of
her father, mother, and affianced hus
band, all in the short space of a few
weeks. Her lover was lost on the
Steamer Missouri. .
According to the lost estimate not
more than two million pounds of
wool were lost iu the Boston fire.
The President expresses himself in
favor of throwing all places in the
civil service open to women, and of
paying them the same as men when
they do the same work.
There is a rumor current in New
York that the Harpers intend to buy
the Tribune for one million dollars,
and place Geo. William Curtis in
charge of it
, General . Rosecrans proposes to
build a broad-gauge railroad from
the City of Mexico to the Pacific
Ocean, and has applied to the Gov
ernment ior a 8UDsiay 01 $ lauuu a
mile to enable him to carry the pro
ject, into effect . . .... :
Mr. Lawns (maculates the wheat crop
of the United Kingdom for 1872 to be
14 per cent below the average, and
considers this to be equivalent to the
necessary importation from other
countries of about " 12,000, 000 quar
ters during the year running from
Sept 1, 1872, to the same date in
187a--- -- '
The Misses Greeley very properly
discountenance the proposed subscrip
tion for their personal benefit, but
signify a willingness to join in a move
ment to procure a fund for the purpose
of erecting a statue to the memory
of their dead father. The Greeley
estat will prove sufficiently large for
the daughters, and they are not de
sirous of other pecuniary aid.
Last Monday was a day of horrors
in Cincinnati Four men were killed
and four others badly injured by
falling from a scaffolding 75 feet
wgii, at, me water vvorKs; and a
butcher named Bill "Wolf stabbed a
fellow workman, Valentine Daum,
through the heart, killing him in
stantly. The murderer escaped to
Kentucky and is still at large.
" . " '
Nast is engaged in illustrating
"Pickwick for Harper's Household
Dickens, a work for which he is pecu
liarly well fitted.' . . , , .
The barks Samuel Larrabee, from
Savannah for Bremen, and Lan-
ercost, from Baltimore for Belfast
have been lost at sea, together with
all on board. ...
The question as to the right of wo
men to vote, under the Constitution of
the United States, is to be legally
tested. A lady in St. Louis has com
menced suit against the register for
refusing to record her as a voter.
She sues for $10,000. :,
The Constitution of Missouri, like
Ohio, says only male citizens shall
vote.
