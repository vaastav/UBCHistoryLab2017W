Merchant Marine.
I "The previous congress, deeply con
cerned in behalf of our merchant ma
Irine'in 1920 enacted the --existing ship
1 ping law,' designed for the upbuilding pf
j the American merchant marine. Among
- other things providaet to encourage - our
i shipping on the world's seas, the execu
i tive ' was directed to give notiGa of the
j termination of all existing commercial
treaties in order to admit of reduced
duties on imports carried in American
being ued to distinguish
it from the tmergeney act which tiie
co'ngress expedited early in the extraor
dinary session and which is the-law to
day. -
"I cannot- too strongly urge an ear-1-
jempletlon of this -necessary legisla
tioif -It is needed to stabi ize our in
dustry at hc-pe, it is essential to make
more definite . ur tra relations
abroad. More, it Is vital to the"preser-.
nation or many of our own industries.
Avbi.ch cmtrftiiite- so -uolabiy to the very
life blood of our nation.
"There . is now, and there always will
be, a. storm .of conifleting opinion about
any. tariff revision'. We cannot go ' far
wrong, when we base eur tariffs on the
policy ;f preserving the productive activ
ities which- enhance employment and add
to our national prosperity.
"Again conies the reminder that we
must -not be unmindful of world condi
tions that neo'iles pre Ftru,?rlinr for in
dustrial rehabilitation and that we can
not dwell' in industria' and commercial
exclusion and. st. the t-amo time do the
just thing in aiding world reconstruc
tion for re-adjustment.
Aloofness is Sot Sought.
"We do not sec-k a selfish aloofness,
and we could not profit by it, were 'it
possible. We recognize the rJccssfty
et buying wherever we sell and the per
manency of trade lies in its acceptable
exchanges. In our .pursuit -cf markets
wo - must give as well as receive. We
cannot sell to others who do not -produce,
nc-r can we buy unless we produce
at home.' Sensible of every, obligation
of humanity, commerce and finance and
mked as they are in the present world
condition, it is not to be argued that we
need 'destroy ourselves to be helpful to
others. -
"With all my heart I wish restora
tion .to the peoples blighted by the aw-
lul Worid war, but the process of re
storation does not Ho in our acceptance
of like cpnditions. It.were better to re
main on firm ground, strive for a-nnl-i
emplqyroent -and high- -standards of wage
at home and point the way to ba lanes
budgets rigid -economies and resoluf-x
eflic ient work as .the necessary remedies
to cure disaster.
''Everything relating to trade, among
o"urssvcs and among nations has been
expanded, excessive. inflated. . Vvw
aial, and there is a madness in finance
which no American policv alone can
cure. It Is not an unworthy se'fishness
to seek to save ourse'ves when the nmr
cesses of that salvation are not only
hot denied to others, but commended to
them. We seek to undermine for others
no industry by which they subsist ; which
are obligated q jiermit.the undermining
oi none ot ocr own which make for em
ployment and .maintained - activities...
- Tariff Legislation Difficult.
"Eery contemplation," it 'little matters
In which direction one turns. magn'fis
the difficulty : of tariff legislation, but
tho necessity of the revision is mtnifi(!
Wth it. Doubtless we are justified in
seeking a more flexible policy than we
httvq provided, heretofore. X hon a' wav
will ba found to make for flexibility an
ptaBtioity so that the rates may be ad
justed to meet unusua' and diapering
conditions, which cannot be' accurately
anticipated. .There are problems ' inci-
u-m io unrair practices ana to ex-
cnanges wnich mafini!s In money have
made almost unsojvah'e. I know of -no
manner In which to effect this flexibility
ohpr .than the extension of the powers
of the tariff commission, so that it can
adapt iteIf to saienfific and wholly ad

AT THE BBEED TH31ATBB
We used to jog along, with a great deal 1 house the children. The chamber co
operated with the school board to secure
an appropriation of $200,000 to build
tho new Mt. Pleasant street school and
purohase adjoining property for schoof
purposes In Preston.
Moern Lighting System.
The chamber endeavored to secure an
appropriation of $12,000 for the installa
tion of fifty- lights in the business sec
tion of the city and known as a White
Way. The type of standard proposed
was similar to those being Installed In
other cities at present and is the most
approved type known. The removal of
evcrhead wires and poles, particularly
In the business section, was a subject of
consideration.
Freight and Paesenger Facilities. .
Chamber cooperated in securing dally
delivery of freight from Boston. Provi
dence and New Haven. Six conferences
have been held with the New Haven
railroad officials as to better passeneer
service, the restoration of an evening
train from New indon, connecting with
the 5 B. m. train from New York city,
being strongly urseij. This matter is
nendinr. The chamber render-d assist-
of urging, often getting into deep ruts,
but keeping at it until we somehow art
rived.' The new methods are like the
improved, roads over which wo may tra

True some children are high powered
cars and are capable of better things
than others, but the good road offers
great possibilities even to the .cts pow
erful. . . .
With this introduction Miss Harrison
went on, explaining her ideas ana
methods of teaching reading .illustrating
her points with materially actually used
in her schoo) as well as by references
and statistics.
Even the kindergarten should contrib
ute toward the teaching of reading by
furnishing a much richer bavi.igreuni
of stones, by emphasizing, dranuutes
and by much conversation. The kin.
dergarten child should be able to read
his name, printed numbers arvd very
simple directions when he is ready for
grade one. '
