Makes Many Recommendations for
Radical Changes
WASHINGTON. Dec. 4.—In his
message to congress President
Roosevelt urges greater elasticity
io our currency, based upon adequate
securities approved by the govern
ment and subject to a heavy tax;
"provided, of course, that we recog
nize the even greater need of a safe
and secure currency."
The fundamental business condi
tions of the country were never more
sound, he says, and it is foolish for
people to hoard money, thereby caus
ing a financial stringency. Instead
of keeping it in sound banks.
The president recommends extend
ing the powers of the interstate com
merce commission over railroads and
other vast business concerns.
Other recommendations Include:
Anti-trust laws more in harmony
with actual conditions; revision of
revenue laws; an income tax; ex
treme care in use of the injunction
in labor disputes; a model employers'
liability act; compulsory investiga
tion of industrial upheavals; foster
ing of agriculture and the trades;
improvement of waterways, includ
ing the Mississippi river, by the na
tional government; further reclama
tion of arid lands; strict guard on
forest reserves; postal savings banks
and parcels post extension; higher
pay for officers and men in the army;
a greater navy for the offensive if the
need arises, and quicker promotion
of officers.
Me reiterates belief in the system
of protective tariffs.
Foreign relations are discussed at
length.

Foolish Girl Sells Herself for For

NEW YORK, Dec. 4.—That Miss
Gladys Vanderbilt, who is to be the
bride of Count Ladlslaus Sechenyl
Ivon Savar-Felso-Videk, is highly
• popular W ith the social leaders of
I Hungary, whom he met last summer,
[and that her wedding has aroused
general interest in that country, is
the statement of relatives of the
fount who are here for the wedding.
They allege that the marriage is
the result of a love match, but this
is dnied by private reports received
from Budapest correspondents, who
declare that Count Szechenyi's fam
ily is in an imitoverished condition
and that an alliance with a woman
iof wealth was necessary for the
count. In arranging a marriage of

pers state. Count Szechenyi is hut
following the precedents established
by his ancestors, the family having
become as famous for its financially
fortunate marriages as for its antiq
uity and its caste.
Since 1697 the Szechenyis have
been titled aristocrats in Hungary.
Hardly a line of the nobility of the
realm antedates them or has won
more favors from the throne. The
ancestors of the present head of the
house were nearly all dignitaries,
statesmen, renowned soldiers or dip
lomats, and the count himself is a
member of the Hungarian house of
lords.
^ et. despite its prominence, the
family has attained so little wealth
that the Hungarian papers admit
•hat such an alliance as that with
the \ anderbilt family had become im
peratively necessary. This is in
s Pite of the fact that Count Sxech

newspapers, that his family was im

BOGUS BANK CERTIFICATES
Many in Circulation Which arc Be

Several bogus bank clearing house
certificates are in circulation. The
certificates affected are those first is
sued by the local baaks before they
put out printed ones. This morning
several were passed at the grocery
store of J. L. Voelker.
These were originally made for
two dollars but the counterfiter
converted the figure "2" and word
"two" into the figure "5" and word
"five." The T of the word "two"
was changed to F, the w to iv and
the o blurred into an e. One cer
tificate was skillfully raised while the
others have been poorly changed.
It is said many are in circulation
and citizens are constantly on the
lookout for the counterfits. It is al
so claimed that the banks are draw

FRUIT JOBBERS HI SESSION
Holding Annual Meeting in Chi
cago.
CHICAGO, Dec. 4.—Mayor F. A.
Russe welcomed the delegates who
assembled In the Auditorium hotel
this morning for the fourth annual
convention of the Western Fruit
Jobbers' association. Buyers and
shippers of fruit from all sections of
the west from Illinois to California,
are participating In the convention.
H. K. Jones of Soulx Falls, S. D., is
president of the organization.
The most important matters to b«
considered at the present session are
the investigation of express com
panies by the interstate commerce
commission, and of their methods in
the buying, selling and handling on
consignment fruits, vegetables and
oysters. The senate resolution pro
viding for this investigation was se
cured through the work of the as
sociation. Recent hearings on this
order have been held in Omaha,
Kansas City and Chicago and much
evidence was adduced by members
of the association tending to show
that the express companies have en
gaged In the fruit and produce com
mission business. Another hearing
will be held by the Interstate com-j
merce commission In Dallas, Tex.,
January 9, and plans will be made
at the present convention to present
additional and convincing evidence.
The correction of alleged freight and
refrigerator rate discriminations
Jobbers and shippers will also oc
cupy much time of the convention,
and it Is likely that a formal com
plaint will be filed with the Inter
state commerce commission as a re
sult of the conference.
CHILDREN ARE GUARDED
The diphtheria that prevails at
LaCrosse and on the Fort Grounds
has been well quarantined by the
county physician. Both school houses
have been thoroughly disinfected by!
formaldehyde and imtasslum. The 1
same plan that proved so effective
last year In stamping out diphtheria!
and smallpox has been put Into op
eration on this occasion. Each morn
ing the pupils with sore throats are;
examined by the superintendent and
taken to a physician who in turn *
thoroughly examines them. Those'
with fever, high pulse or other sus
picious symtoms are sent home and
closely watched by the physician, j
This plan places the afflicted child
In the hands of the physician long
before the unsuspecting parent would
call a doctor, and antitoxine is ad
ministered to the child. This plan al
so renders the children immune who
have been exposed to the dreaded dis
ease. Therefore, the public schools
are a much safer place than at home
or on the streets.
The attendance has been little af
fected and no s -hooIs are closed and
probably will not be while these vig
orous measures on the part of the
school authorities are continued.
ATHLETIC EXHIBITION
The wrestling and boxing tourna
ment was attended by about 250 peo
ple, one of whom was a woman, the
sweetheart, it Ib said, of one of the
performers. It is claimed that order
prevailed and was apparently enjoy
ed by those present.
Herbert Smith, the local man,
in a fifteen minute wrestling bout
with l£d Larson, of St. Paul, showed
some clever work, but neither made
a fall and the men rested for three
minutes and allowed another five
minute bout, in the first minute of
which. Smith threw bis opponent
apparently without much effort.
The first boxing contest was be
tween Bill Daly, of Denver and Jack
Owens, of Salt Lake. The bouts con
sisted of four rounds of three minutes
each with one minute rest. Shad
duck acted aa referee. The first
round was slow, Owens being more
clever but Daly being a heavier bit-j
ter. Honors were even. During the!
second round Daly knocked Owens
out in 2:45 minutes, by a right,
swing to the Jaw. Owens was clever!
but Daly was too much for him.
The second bout was between Dick!
Sullivan, of Seattle, and Tim O'Brien
of Portland. The first round was;
slow, both doing some clever boxing
but there was no hitting. Honor*
were even. The second round was;
BEAD PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Both Houses of Congress Listen to
Document.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 —The an
nual message of President Roosevelt
was read yesterday in both houses of
congress, and practically no business
waa attempted by either body beyond
listening to the message. The gal
leries of both senate and house were
croweded at the beginning of the ses
sion of each body, but aa the reading
progressed the attendance diminished
somewhat. In the main, however, it
was well maintained until the last
sentence had fallen from the lips of
the speaker. Senators and members
were supplied with printed copies of
the message and many of them fol
lowd the reading clerks with scrupul
ous care. The reading consumed
about two and a quarter hours in
each of the houses.
Speaker Cannon treated the house
to a surprise In anounclng the mem
bership of the committee on bankers
and currency. This advance forma
tion of that committee led to the in
formation that it waa the intention
to press financial legislation, but
those close to the speaker say his only
purpose was to afford a depository
for petitions and letters bearing upon
the currency question. The member
ship of the committee was Increased
by the additon of one Democrat, mak
ing seven members of that party on
It, instead of six as during the f>9th
congress. This Is In accordanee with
the request of minority leader, Wll
Hams, but It Is sutd that It is not to
be taken as an Indication that the re
quest will be complied with in ail
committees.
HONOR FOR SHONTS
Will be Made President of Chicago
A Alton.
NEW YORK. Dec. 4.—It is stated
on good authority that Theodore F.
Shunts. former chairman of the Pan
ama canal commission and present
president of the interborough-Metro
politan traction merger, will not re
sign the latter position in order to
assume the presidency of the Chlca
go & Alton railway. The facts In the
case are that Mr. Shouts will occupy
both posltlolns, as well as being
president of the Clover ls>af line.

WASHINGTON, Dec 4.—An en

ing their occupation of the isthmus

faster and there was much cllnch
tng. Sullivan was knocked down,
but appeared to have tripped himself.
At the close things were exciting,
there being considerable enthusiasm
and some mixing. Again honors
were even. The third round was
fast with much clinching. The fourth
was hard fought and fast but failed
to show up a winner and was called
a draw.
The last bout was between Maur
ice Thompson of Butte, and Louis
Long of San Francisco. There was
hard and fast hitting from the first.
Thompson drew blood Thompson
The second round was In Thompson s
favor with much slugging and clinch
ing. The third was even though
fast. The fourth was faster and
there was much slugging in clinches.
The bout was called a draw.

it touched a tender cord in our

THE CUSTER MASSACRE
Hiftorian Curtiz Vilifies General Cos
ter.
A historian named Curtis la just
now engaged in furnishing syndicate
articles to a number of the leading
daily newspapers, In which he at
tempts to question the Judgment of
General Custer In the dlastrous battle
which coal himself and his men their
lives, lie goes further and intimates
that Custer ruahd into a death trap
and sacrificed his men for seif ag
grandizement. That such statements
are untrue and based on false evi
dence every person who resided in
Montana in those days, and who is
conversant with the facta, will testify.
Curtis bases his information on the
description and statement of two old
Indians who claimed to know the
truth. He does not take into consid
eration the habit of the Indian to lie
and misrepresent, but jumps to the
conclusion that the statements of the
scouts sre true. He says that "the
time to write the history of the Custer
battle hus not come" because loo
many are living who know too much
about the fight. Curtis is unjust to
Custer and his men.
The writer was a resident of east
ern Mon Una when the facU of the
battle of the Liule Big Horn were
fresh In the minds of the hardy pio
neers who knew Custer, the Indians
and the country. In conversation
with men in Major Reno's command
and others we learned the truth. In
their pursuit of the Indians who were
under the leadership of Sitting Bull,
whom we know to have been nothing
more than a cunning redhanded mur
derer—regardless of the adulation
and praise given his generalship by
eastern admirers—General Custer and
Major Reno, parted company on the
Kooebud with a complete understand
ing that their commands were to pro
ceed by dlfferen routes and make a
simultaneous attack on the Indian
camp; or, rather Custer was to engage
the Indians, Reno to follow by an at
tack on their rear. Custer reached
the camp and made the attack as
Who was teat to Puuubm to Jm

aad the rscmfitm ad tkm mmol
planned, while Reno delayed his ad
vance—although almost within gun
shot hearing of the battle- until the
massacre had beau completed and
the Indians had departed for the
Canadian border. Keuo waa either
a coward or incapable of seeing the
necessity of giving Custer the prom
ised support. Men who were with
him on that tardy march, when the
horrible scenes that met their eyes
on that battle field were still fresh
In their minds, have personally
stated to us their belief that Reno
was afraid to advance to the relief
of Custer and preferred to let his
comrade in arms take chances with
th# treacherous Soulx alone. The
result is history, and Custsr and
evary muu In his command crossed
the divide fighting ror their coun
try. white Reno rested on his arms.
It is easy to traduce a dead man, and
Curtis' attack on Custer and the
men who marched with him to death
is not history—It is rank cowardice.
