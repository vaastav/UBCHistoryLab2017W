THE REWARD OF MERIT.
*
Annie had arrived at the mature age of
(do not start, reader,) twenty-seven, and was
yet in the state of single blessedness. Somehow
or other she had not even fallen in love
as yet. "Had she no offers?" What a simple
question! Did you ever know half a
million dollars to go begging? Offers? Yes,
scores of them ! it may be accounted as one
of her oddities, perhaps, but whenever the
subject happened to be touched upon by her
fattier, Annie would say she wanted some
one who could love her for herself, and she
must have assurance of this, and how could
she in her present position ? Thus matters
stood, when Annie was led to form and execute
what will appear a very strange resolution
; but she was a resolute girl. We must
now go back six years.
~ " # XT
Uae dark, raiuy morning id nuvemuer,
as our old friend was looking composedly at
the cheerful fire in the grate of his countingroom,
really indulging, in 'orae serious reflections
of the past and future, the far future,
too, a gentleman presented himself, and
inquired for Mr. Bremen. The old man uttered
not a word, but merely bowed. There
was that in his looks which suid "I am be."
The stranger might have seen some thirty
years or so of age. He was dressed in black,
a mourning weed was on hi3 hat, and there
was something in his appearance which seemed
to indicate that the friend whose loss he
deplored had recently departed. The letter
of introduction which he presented to Mr. B.
was quickly yet carefully perused, and as
it was somewhat unique, we shall take the
liberty of submitting it to the inspection ot
the reader:
, 11 mo., 18?.
Friend Paul This will introduce to thee,
friend Charles Copeland. He has come to thy
city in pursuit of business. I have known him
from a youth up. Thou mayest depend upon
him for aught that he can do, and shalt not lean
on him as on a broken reed. If thou canst do
anything for him, thou mayest peradventure benefit
thyself, and cause to rejoice, thy former and
present friend, Micha Loomis."
"It is not every one who can get old Micah
Loomis' endorsement on his character," said
Paul Bremen to himself, as he folded up the
letter of a well known associate of formerdays.
"Old Micah is good for a quarter of a million,
or anything else?it will do?I want him?
getting old?business increasing?must have
some more help?now as well as any time."
The old gentleman looked at all this, as be
stood gazing in perfect silence on the man
before him. At length he opened his lips.
"Mr. Copeland, you know all about
books ?"
"I have some few years ex|>erieuce."
"Any objection to a place here ??pretty
close hard work?thousand a year."
"None in the world."
"When can you begin ?"
"Now."
A real smile shone upon the old man's
Aipo Tf linororod thpro lilrp the rftVH of the
setting sun among clouds of evening, lighting
up those seeming hard, dark features.
A stool was pushed to the new comer,
books were opened, matters explained, directions
given, the pen was dipped in the ink,
and in short, before an hour had passed away,
you would have thought that the old man
and the young man had known each other
for years.
In reference to 'our new friend it will be
sufficient to remark, that he bad been liberally
educated, as the phrase goes, and though
he bad entered early into business, he had
not neglected the cultivation of his mind and
heart. He had found time to cherish a general
acquaintance with the most noteworthy
authors of the day, both literary and religious,
and with many of past times. After a
few years of success in the pursuits to which
he had devoted himself, misfortunes came
thick and fast upon him. Ha found himself j
left with scarcely any property, and alone in
the world, save his two lovely sisters.
As year after year passed away, he grew
steadily in the confidence of his employer,
who felt, though he said it not, that in him
he possessed a treasure.
Very little, indeed, was said by either of
them not connected with the routine of business,
and there bad been no intercourse
whatever between them, save in the countingroom.
Thus six years went by, towards the
close of which period old Mr. Bremen was
found- looking with much frequency and
earnestness at the young man before hira.
Something was evidently brewing in that old
head. What could it be? And then, too,
at home he looked so curiously. The Irish
servant was puzzled. "Sure," said James,
"something's a coming." Annie, too, was
somewhat perplexed, for those looks dwelt
much on her.
"What is it, father?" she 3aid to him one
morning at the breakfast table, as be sat
gazing steadfastly in her face ; "what is it ?
Do tell me."
"I wish you'd have hira," burst forth like
an avalanche. "Known him for six yearstrue
as a ledger?a gentleman?real sensible
man?don't talk much?regular as a clock?
prime for business?worth his weight in gold."
"Have who, father? what are you talking
about ?"
"My head clerk, Copeland?you don't
know him?I do?haven't seen anybody else
worth an old quill."
Annie was puzzled. She laughed, however,
and said: "Marry my father's clerk !
what would people say ?"
"Humbug, child, all humbug?worth forty
of your whiskered, lounging, lazy gentry ;
say what they please what do I care ? what
do you care ? what's money after all ? got
enough of it?want a sensible man?want
somebody to take care of it; all humbug."
"What's all humbug, father?"
"Why, people's notions on these matters.
Copeland is poor?so was I once?may be
again ; world's full of changes?seen a great
many of them in my day?can't stay here
loner?eot to leave vou. Annie?wish vou'd
like him."
"Father, are you serious ?"
"Serious, child !" Aud he looked so.
Anuie was a chip of the old block ; a
strong minded, resolute girl. A new idea
seemed to strike her.
"Father, if you are really serious in this
matter, I'll see this Copeland ; I'll get acquainted
with him. If he likes me and I
like him, I'll have him. Bet he shall love
me for myself alone ; I must know it. Will
you leave the matter to me 1"
"Go ahead, my child, and do as you like.
Good morning."
"Stop a moment, father. I shall alter ray
name a little ; I shall appear to be a poor
girl, a companion of our friend, Mrs. Richards,
in H street, she shall know the
whole affair ; you shall call me by my middle
name, Peyton ; I shall be a relative of yours;
you shall suggest the busiuess to Mr. Copeland,
as you call him, and arrange for the
first interview. The rest will take care for
itself."
"I see, I see and one of those rare
smiles illuminated his whole face. It actually
got between his lips, parted them asunder,
glanced upon a set of teeth but little the
worse for wear, and was resting there when
be left the hou8e for his counting-room. The
twilight of that smile was not yet gone when
he reached the well known spot, and bowed
and looked "good morning" to those in his
; employ, for old Paul was, after his fashion,
a polite man. On the morning of that day,
i what looks were directed to our friend Charles!
so many, so peculiar, so full of something,
J that the head clerk could not but notice them,
: and that, too, with some alarm. What was
coming ? At last the volcano burst forth :
"Copeland, my good fellow, why don't you
get a wife ?"
Had a thunderbolt fallen at his feet, he
could not have been more astounded. Did
Mr. Bremen say that, and in the countingroom,
too ? The very ledger seemed to blush
at the introduction of such a subject. He
for the first time made a blot on the fair pages
before him.
"I say?why don't you get a wife ??know
just the thing for you?prime article?poor
enough, to be sure?what of that?a fortune
in a wife, you know?a sort of relation of
mine? don't v.ant to meddle with other people's
affairs, know your own business best?
can't help thinking you'll he happier?must
see her."
Now the fac is, that Charles had for some
time past thou ;ht so himself; but how the
old man shoul have completely divined his
feelings, was q lite a puzzle to him. In the
course of the day a note was put into Mr.
Bremen's hands by James, his Irish servant,
the contents of which produced another grim
sort of a smile. Wheu the moment for his
return home arrived, Mr. B. handed a sealed
document of rather imposing form to Charles,
saying?
"Copeland, you'll oblige me by leaving
that at No. 67 H? street. Place it only in
the hands of the person to whom it is directed
; don't want-to trust it to any one else."
The clerk saw on the outside, "Mrs. Richards,
67 H street." The door bell was
ruug. The servant ushered Copeland into
a small, neat parlor, where sat a lady apparently
twenty five or thirty years of age,
plainly dressed, engaged in knitting a stocking.
Our friend bowed, and inquired for
Mrs. Richards.
"She is not in, but is expected presently ;
will you be seated ?" There was an ease and
quietness, and an air of self-command about
this person that seemed peculiar to Copeland.
He felt at ease at once, (you always do with
such people,) made some common place remark,
which was immediately responded to;
then another; and soon the conversation
grew so interesting that Mrs. Richards was
nearly forgotten. Her absence was strangely
protracted, but at length she made her appearance.
The document was presented; a
glance at the outside.
"Mr. Copeland." Charles bowed.
"Miss Peyton." The young lady bowed ;
and thus they were introduced. There was
no particular reason for remaining any longer,
and our friend took his departure.
That night Annie said to Mr. B., I do like
his appearance, father.""
"Forward?march 1" said old Paul, and he
looked at his daughter with vast satisfaction.
"The ould man's as swate to night as a new
potato," said James to the cook.
The next day Charles Copeland came near
writing several times, "To Miss Peyton, Dr.,"
as he was making out some bills of merchandise
sold.
"Deliver the paper last evening ?"
Copeland bowed.
"Mrs. Richards is an old friend?humble in
circumstances-?the young lady, Peyton, worth
her weight in gold any day?have her myselt
if I could."
* * * * * *
"How much you remind me of Mr. Bremen,"
said Charles one evening to Anuie ;
"I think you said you were a relation of
his?"
"I am related to him through my mother,"
was the grave reply.
Mrs. Richards turned away to conceal a
smile.
Somewhat later than usual, on that day,
Anuie reached her father's house. There
was no mistaking the expression of her countenance.
Happiness was plainly written
there.
"I see, I see," said the old man ; "the accouut
is closed?books balanced?have it all
through now in short order. You are a sensible
girl?no foolish puss?just what I
want?bless you, child, bles3 you."
The next day Paul came, for almost the
hrst time in his life, rather late to his counting
room. Casks and boxes seemed to be
staring with wonder.
"Copeland, you are a 6ile fellow?heard
from Mrs. Richards?proposals to my relative,
Peyton?all right?done up well. Come
to my house this evening?never been there
yet, eh??eight o'clock, precisely?want to
see you?got something to say."
Yes, Mr. Charles Copeland, even kinder
than you think for.
At eight o'clock precisely, the door-bell
of Mr. Bremen's mansion rang. Mr. Charles
Copeland was ushered in by friend James.
Old Paul took him kindly by the hand, and
turning round abruptly, introduced him to
" ??? Mleo A nniA PattfAn PpQmfln "
WJ uaugu ICIj iUICO X1U1JIU X X^J IVU ^IOUIWUj I
aud immedially withdrew.
"Charles, you forgive rue this ?" He was !
too much astonished to make any reply. "If!
you knew all my motives and feelings, I am I
sure you would."
That the motives and feelings were soon ex- i
plained to his entire satisfaction no one will j
doubt.
"Copeland, my dear fellow," shouted old |
Paul, as he entered the room, "no use in a j
long engagement!"
"O, father !"
"No use, I say ; marry now?get ready afterwards
; next Monday evening; who cares ?
Wan't it over; feel settled. Shan't part with
Anuie, though; must bring your wife here;
house rather lonesome; be still; no words ;:
must have it so ; partner in business ; Bremen
& Copeland; got the papers all drawn up to;
day; can't alter it. Be quiet, will you ?
Won't stay in the room !"
I have now finished my story, reader. I
have given you the facts. I cannot say, however,
that I approve of the deception pracj
ticed upon our friend Charles. As, however,
j our Lord commended the "unjust steward be!
cause he acted wisely," so I suppose the good
I sense shown by the young lady, in choosing a
| husband for the sake of wh^t he might have
possessed, merits our approbation. It is not
! every one who has the courage to step out of
j the circle which surrounds the wealthy, and
j seek for those qualities .of mind and" heart
j which the heart can neither give nor take
away.
Stories as to Mrs. Liucoln being in
want are all false. Afte#r her husband's
death Congress gave her 875,000. About
! 860,000 of this was invested in 6 per cents,
j Then the government pnys her an annuity of
! 83,000. She sold some property to her son
Robert, the present Secretary of War, from
which she received a considerable amount
While iu Europe her annual income was
88,000. She is in mental distress and has
been at times since the assasination of her
husband, but there is no danger of her suffering
for want of money.

THE PRESIDENT'S" MESSAGE.
The message of President Arthur to the
first session of the Forty-seventh Congress
was read in both houses on Tuesday of last
week. As a departure from the custom which
has obtained of late years, the message was
not printed in advance, but was read in Congress
from manuscript. It is the most elaborate
document that has reoently emanated
from the Executive Department; and while it
discusses at great length, all the various questions
bearing upon the home and foreign policy
of the Government, it is pronounced by
the press representing all shades of political
opinion a practical and eminently conservative
paper. The message opens with the following
allusion to the extraordinary event that called
him to the head of the government:
An appalling calamity has befallen the
American people since their chosen representatives
last met in the halls where you are now
assembled. We might else recall with unalloyed
content, the rare prosperity with which,
throughout the year, the Nation has been
blessed. Its harvests have been plenteous;
its varied industries have thriven ; the health
of its people have been preserved; it has
maintained with Foreign Governments the
undisturbed relations of amity and peace.
For these manifestations of His favor we owe
to Him who holds our destiny in His hands,
the tribute of our grateful devotions. To
that mysterious exercise of His will, which
has taken from us the loved and illustrious
citizen who was but lately the bead of the
Nation, we bow in sorrow and submission.
The memory of his exalted character, of his
noble achievements and of his patriotic life,
will be treasured forever as a sacred possession
of the whole people. The announcement
of his death drew from Foreign Governments
and peoples tributes of sympathy and sorrow
which history will record as signal tokens of
the kinship of Nations and the federation of
mankind. The feeling of good will between
our own Government and that of Great Britain
was never more marked than at present.
In recognition of this pleasing fact, I directed,
nn the occasion of the late Centennial celebra
tion at York town, that a salute be given to
the British flag. Touching
foreign relations with this Government,
to which much space is devoted,
the message recites that American subjects
about Alsace and Lorraine have been guarded,
although the best feeling has been
strengthened between Germany and the United
States. Relations with France are cordial
; differences with Spain are being firmly
adjusted, and recent detentions to American
shipping at the port of Mantilla have been
examined, with a view to their satisfactory
settlement; American Israelites in Russia
will have influences from Washington thrown
about tbem in the anti-Jewish agitation in
Russia ; several important conferences have
recently been held with Italy; American
missionaries in Turkey will be looked after
and protected ; the Swiss Government has
again solicited the good offices of our diplomatic
and consular agents for the protection
of its citizens in countries where it is not itself
represented. This request has, within
proper limits, been granted. Our agents in
Switzerland have been instructed to protest
against the conduct of the authorities in certain
communes in permitting the emigration
to this country of criminals and other objectional
persons. Several such persons,
through the co-operation of the Commissioners
of Emigration at New York, have been
sent back by the steamer which brought
them ; a continuation of which course, the
President thinks, may prove a more effectual
remedy than diplomatic remonstrance. Treaties
of commerce and navigation, and for
the regulation of Consular privileges, have
been concluded with Roumania and Servia
since their admission into the family of European
States. Treaties of an important nature
have been lately negotiated with China ; but
in relation to both China and Japan some
further changes are desirable in our present
system of Consular jurisdiction. He hopes,
at some future time to lay before Congress
a scheme for the improvement of our Consular
jurisdiction in the entire East. Relations
of unimpaired amity have been maintained
throughout the year with the respective Governments
of Austro Hungary, Belgium, Denmark,
Hayti, Paraguay, Uruguay, Portugal
and Sweden and Norway. This may also be
said of Greece and Ecuador, although our
relations with those States have for some
years been severed by the withdrawal of appropriations
for diplomatic representatives at
Athens and Quito. It seems expedient to
restore those missions, even on a reduced scale,
and I decidely recommend such a course with
respect to Ecuador, which is likely, within the
near future, to play an important part among
the operations of the Southern Pacific. In
regard to the Panama Canal, President Arthur
insists that despite the position of Colnnihift
in rptnird to our maintaining alone
the neutrality of the work, the prior guarantee
of the United States is indiepensable, and
that the intervention of any Foreign Power
to assist in the guarantee will be considered
superfluous and unfriendly. He, therefore,
recommends the abrogation of so much of
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty as does not comport
with this obligation of the United States.
Alluding to the hostile relations between
Chili, Bolivia and Peru, the President intimates
that the growing sentiment is that our
Government must finally assume protectorate
over the whole continent of South America.
Of our relations with Mexico, the President
says : As is natural with contiguousi
States having like institutions and like aims i
of advancement and development, the friend- i
ship of the United States and Mexico has i
been constantly maintained. This Government
has lost no occasion of encouraging the
Mexican Government to a beneficial realization
of the mutual advantages which will j
result from more intimate commercial inter- |
course and from the opening of the rich iute- i
rior of Mexico to railway enterprise. I deem
it important that means be provided to restrain
the lawlessness, unfortunately so common
on the frontier, and to suppress the forays
of the reservation Indians on either side of
the Rio Grande. The neighboring StateB of
Central America have preserved internal
peace and their outward relations towards us
have been those of intimate friendship. There
are encouraging sigus of their growing disposition
to subordinate their local interests to
those which are common to them by reason
of their geographical relations. The boundary
dispute between Guatemala and Mexico
has afforded this Government an opportunity
to exercise its good offices for preventing a
rupture between those States, and for procuring
a peaceabl, solution of the question. I
cherish strong hope that in view of our relations
of amity with both countries our friendly
counsels may prevail. A special envoy of
Guatemala has brought to me the condolence
of his Government and people on the death
of President Garfield. The Costa Rican
Government lately framed an engagement
j with Colombia for settling, by arbitration, the
| boundary question between those countries,
| providing that the post of arbitrator should
be offered successively to the King of the
Belgians, the King of Spain, and the President
of the Argentine Confederation. The
King of the Belgians has declined to act, but
I am as yet unadvised of the action of the
j King of Spain. As we have certain interests
i in the disputed territory, which are protected
| by our treaty engagements with one of the
! parties, it is important that the arbitration
should not, without our consent, effect our
rights, and this Government has, accordingly,
thought proper to make its views known to
the parties to the agreement, as well as to intimate
them to the Belgian and Spanish
Governments.
On the subject of the finances of the Government,
he says the report of the Secretary
1 " J-._M _ L.'.LI..
or me .treasury preseiiia iu ueiau ? ingulf
satisfactory exhibit of the state of the finances
and the condition of the various
branches of the public service administered
by that Department.. The ordinary revenues
from all sources for the fiscal year ending
June 30,1881, were 8360,782,292.57; and the
ordinary expenditures for the same period
were 8100,069,404.98. The requirements of
the sinking fund for the year amounted to
890,786,064.02, which sum included a balance
of 849.817,128.78 not provided for duriDg the
previous fiscal year. The sura of 874,480,201.05
was applied to this fund, which left a
deficit of 816,305,873.47. The increase of
the revenues for 1881 over those of the previous
year was 829,352,901.10. It is estimated
that the receipts during the present year
will reach 8400,000,000, and the expenditures
8270,000,000, leaving a surplus of 8130,000,000
applicable to the sinking fund and the
redemption of the public debt. I approve the
recommendation of the Secretary of the
Treasury, that provision be made for the early
retirement of silver certificates, and that
the act requiring their issue be repealed.
They were issued in pursuance of the policy
of the Government to maintain silver at or
near the gold standard, and were accordingly
made receivable for all customs taxes and
public dues. About 866.000,000 of them are
now outstanding. They form ab unnecessary
addition to the paper currency, a sufficient
amount of which may be readily supplied by
the National banks. In accordance with the
act of February 28, 1878, the Treasury Department
has monthly caused at least two hundred
millions in value of silver bullion to be
coined into standard silver dollars. One hundred
and two millions of these dollars have
been already coined, while only ahout thirty
lour minions are in circulation, jp or tne reaBons
which he specifies, I concur in the Secretary's
recommendation that the provision for
the coinage of a fixed amount each month
be repealed, and that hereafter only so much
be coined as shall be necessary to supply the
demand. The Secretary advises tnat the issue
of gold certificates should not for the
present be resumed, and suggests that the
National banks may properly be forbidden by
law to retire their currency except upon reasonable
notice of their intention so to do.
Such legislation would seem to be justified by
the recent action of certain banks on the occasion
referred to in the Secretary's report.
Of the fifteen millions of fractional currency
still outstanding, only about eighty thousand
has been redeemed the past year. The suggestion
that this amount may properly be
dropped from future statements of the public
debt seems worthy of approval.
The customs revenues for the last fiscal
year, and the sources from which they were
derived are reviewed at length, as also the
refunding measures of a previous Congress;
and touching the question of refunding the
bonds of the Government, he says the reduction
of the annual interest on the public debt
through the transactions introduced by the
Funding Act is as follows: By reduction of
interest to 31 per cent., 810,473,952.25 ; by
redemption of bonds, 86,352,340?total, 816,826,292.25.
The 31 per cent, bonds being
payable at the pleasure of the Government,
are available for the investment of surplus
revenue without the payment of premiums.
TT?-?1 r\nn f Uaoa Kaw/Io aam Ka o f a mnoK
uu1cco IIJWO huuuq tau ut iuuuvu Ub n i11ui/u
lower rate of interest than they now bear, the
President agrees with the Secretary of the
Treasury that no legislation respecting them
is desirable.
His next topic is the business of the country
and measures of relief from taxation, on
which he says: It is a matter of congratulation
that the business of the country has
been so prosperous during the past year as to
yield by taxation a large surplus of income
to the Government. If the revenue laws remain
unchanged this surplus must year by
year increase on account of the reduction of
the public debt and its burden of interest,
and because of the rapid increase of our population.
In 1860, just prior to the institution
of our internal revenue system, our population
but slightly exceeded thirty millions;!
by the census of 1880, it is now found to exceed
fifty millions. It is estimated that even
if the annual receipts and expenditures should
continue as at present, the entire debt should
be paid in ten years. In view, however, of
the heavy load of taxation which our people
have already borne, we may well consider
it is not the part of wisdom to reduce the
revenues, even if we delay a little in the payment
of the debt. It seems to me that the
time has arrived when the people may justly
demand some relief from their present onerous
burden, and that by due economy in the
various branches of the public service this
may readily be afforded. I, therefore, concur
with the Secretary in recommending the abolition
of all internal revenue taxes, except
those upon tobacco in its various forms, aud
upon distilled spirits and fermented liquors,
and except also the speciul tax upon manu
tacturers and dealers in such articles, ine
retention of the latter tax is desirable as affording
the officers of the Government a
propersupervisiou of these articles, for the prevention
of fraud. I agree with the Secretary
of the Treasury, that the law imposing a stamp
tax upon matches, proprietary articles, playing
cards, checks and drafts, may, with propriety,
be repealed, and the law also by which banks
and bankers are assessed upon their capital
deposits. There seems to be a general sentiment
in favor of this course. In the present
condition of our revenues the tax upon deposits
is especially unjust. It was never imposed
in this couutry until it was demanded
by the necessities of war, and was never exacted,
I believe, in any other country, even in
its greatest exigencies. Banks are required
to secure their circulation by pledging with
the Treasurer of. the United Slates, bonds of
the General Government. The interest upon
these bonds, which at the time the tax was
imposed, was six per cent., is now in most instances
three and one-hulf per cent. Besides,
the entire circulation was originally limited
by law, and no increase was allowable.
When the existing banks had practically
a monopoly of the busiuess, there was force
in the suggestion that for the franchise to
the favored grantees, the Government might
very properly exact a tax on circulation, but
for years the system has been free and the
the amount of circulation regulated by the
public demand. The retention of this tax
has been suggested as a means of reimbursing
the Government for the expense of printing
and furnishing the circulating notes. If the
! tax should be repealed it would certainly seem
proper to require the National banks to paj
the amount of such expense to the Comptrollei
of the Currency. It is, perhaps, doubtful
whether the immediate reduction of the ratt
of taxation upon liquors and tobacco is advisable,
especially in view of the drain upon r.he
Treasury which must attend the payment oi
arrears of pensions. A comparison, however,
of the amount of taxes collected renders the
varying rates of taxation, which at different
times prevailed, suggests the intimation that
some reduction may soon be made without
material diminution of the revenue. The tariff
laws also need revision, but that all due
regard may be paid to the conflicting interests
of our citizens, important changes should be
made with caution. If a careful revision
caunot be made at this session, a Commission,
such as was lately npproved by the Seuate,
and is now recommended hy the Secretary ot
t.hfl Treasurv. would doubtless lighten the
| labors of Congress whenever this subject shall
be brought to consideration.
The report of the Secretary of War is reviewed
at length and various suggestions
therein contained recommended. The actual
expenditures of that department, for the fiscal
year ending June 30,1881, were $42,122,201.39
; the appropriations for the year 1882 were
$44,889,725.42; the estimates for 1883 are
$44,541,276.91.
Referring to the report of the Secretary of
the Navy, which exhibits the condition of
that branch of the service, he says: "I cannot
too strongly urge upon you my conviction
that every consideration of National safety,
economy and honor, imperatively demand a
thorough rehabitation of our navy, with a full
appreciation, that compliance with the suggestion
of the head of that department and his
advisers must involve a large expenditure of
the public moneys. I earnestly recommend
such appropriations as will accomplish an
end which seems to me so desirable. Nothing
can be more inconsistent with true public
economy than withholding the means necessary
to accomplish the objects entrusted by the
Constitution to the National Legislature.
One of those objects, and one of which is of
paramount importance, is declared by our
fundamental law to be the provision for the
"common defense." Surely nothing is more
essential to the defense of the United States
and of all our people than the efficiency of
our navy. We have for many years maintained
with foreign Governments the relations
of honorable peace, and that such relations
may be permanent, is desired by every patriotic
citizen of the Republic. But if we heed
the teachings of history, we shall not forget
that in the life of every nation emergencies
may arise, when a resort to arras can alone
save it from dishonor. No danger from
abroad now threatens this people, nor have
we any cause to doubt thtf friendly professions
of other Governments; but avoiding, as well
as foreseeing, dangers that may threaten us in
the future, we must be prepared to enforce
any policy which we may think wise to adopt.
We must be ready to defend our harbors
against aggression ; to protect, by the distribution
of our ships of war over the highways
of commerce, the varied interests of our foreign
trade, and the persons and property of
our citizens abroad; to maintain everywhere
the honor of our flag, and the distinguished
position which we may rightfully claim
among the nations of the world.
Of the report of the Postmaster General,
he says that document is a gratifying exhibit

vice. The receipts from postage and other ordinary
sources, during the past fiscal year,
were $36,489,816.58. The receipts from the
money order business were 8295,581.39, making
a total of 830,785,397.97. The expenditures
for the fiscal year were 839,251,736.46.
The deficit supplied out of the general treasury
was 82,481,129.35, or 6 3-10 per cent, of
ithe amount expended. The receipts were
$3,469,919.63 in excess of those of the previous
year, and 84,575,397.97 in excess of the
estimate made two years ago, before the present
period of business prosperity had fairly
begun. The whole number of letters mailed
in this country, in the last fiscal year exceeded
one thousand millions. The registry system
is reported to be in excellent condition,
having been remodeled during the past four
years with good results. The amount of registration
fees collected during the last fiscal
year was 8712,882.20, an increase over the
fiscal year ending June 30th, 1877, of $345,443.40.
The entire number of letters and
packages registered during the year was 8,338,918,
of which only 2,061 were lost or destroyed
in transit. The operations of the money
order system are multiplying yearly under
the impulse of immigration, of the rapid development
of the newer States and Territories
| and the consequent demand for additional
: means of intercommunication and exchauge.
During the past year 138 additional money
order offices have been established, making a
[ total of 5,499 in operation at the date of this
report. During the year the domestic money
orders aggregated in value $105,075,769.39.
A modification of the system is suggested, reducing
the fees for money orders, not exceeding
$5, from ten cents to five cents, and making
the maximum limit 8100 in place of $50.
Legislation for the disposition of unclaimed
money orders in the possession of the Post
Office Department is recommended in view of
the fact that their total value now exceeds 81,nnn

invited to the subject of establishing a system
of saving depositories in connection with
the post office department. The statistics of
mail transportation show that during the past
year railroad routes have been increased in
length 6,249 miles and in cost $1,114,382,
while steamboat routes have been decreased
in length 2,182 miles and in cost $134,054.
The so-called Star Routes have been decreased
in length 3,949 miles and in cost $364,144.
Nearly all of the more expeusive routes have
been superseded by railroad service. The
cost of the star service must, therefore, rapidly
decrease in the Western States and Territories.
The Postmaster-General, however,
calls attention to the constantly increasing
cost of the railway mail service as a serious
difficulty in the way of making tbe Department
self sustaining. As has been already
stated, great reductions have recently been
made in the expense of the Star Route Service.
The investigations of the Department
of Justice and the Post Office Department
have resulted in tbe presentation of indictments
against persons formerly connected with
that service, accusing them of offenses against
the United States. I have enjoined upon the
officials who are charged with the conduct of
the cases on the part of the Government and
upon the eminent counsel, who, before ray ac|
cession to the Presidency, were called to their
assistance, the duty of prosecuting, with the
utmost vigor of the law, all persons who may
be found chargeable with frauds upon the
postal service.
On the Court system and its future, he
says : The Acting Attorney General calls attention
to the necessity of modifying the
present system of the Courts of the United
States, a necessity due to the large increase
of business, especially in the Supreme Court.
Litigation in our Federal tribunals became
greatly expanded after the close of the late
war. So long as that expansion might be
attributed to the abnormal condition in which
the community found itself immediately af
i ter the return of peace, prudence required
> that no change be made in the constitution ot
our judicial tribunals. But it has now be1
come apparent that an immense increase of
i litigation has directly resulted from the
wonderful growth and development of the
i country. There is no ground for the belief
? that the business of the United States Courts
will ever be less in volume than at present.
i Indeed, that it is likely to be much greater
, is generally recognized by the bench and bar.
In view of the fact that Congress has already
given much consideration to this subject, I
make uo suggestion as to detail, but express
the hope that your deliberations may result
in such legislation as will give early relief to
our overburdened Courts. The acting Attorney
General also calls attention to the disturbance
of the public tranquility during the
[ past year in the Territory or Arizona, a
I hand of armed desperadoes, known as "Cow
j Boys," probably numbering from 50 to 100
men, have been engaged for months in committing
acts of lawlessness and brutality
which the local authorities have been unable
to repress. The depredations of these "Cow
Boys" have also extended into Mexico, which
the marauders reach from the Arizona frontier.
With every disposition to meet the exigencies
of the case, I am embarrassed by a
lack of authority to deal with them effectually.
The punishment of crimes committed
within Arizona should ordinarily, of course,
be left to the Territorial authorities. But it
is worthy of consideration whether the acts
which necessarily tend to embroil the United
States with neighboring Governments should
not be declared crimes against the United
States. Some of the incursions alluded to
may perhaps be within the scope of the lawful
Revised Statutes, section 5,286 (forbidding
"military expeditions or enterprises" against
friendly States), but in view of the speedy
assembling of your body, I have preferred
to await such legislation as in your wisdom
the occasion may seem to demand. It may,
perhaps, be thought proper that the setting
on foot within our own territory of brigandage
and armed marauding expeditions against
friendly nations and their citizens shall be
punished as an offense against the United
States. I will add that in the event of a
request from the Territorial government for
protection by the United States against "domestic
violence," this Government would be
powerless to render assistance. The act of
1795, chapter 36, passed at a time when Territorial
governments received little attention
from Congress, enforced this duty of the
United States ODly as to the State governments.
But the act of 1807, chapter 39, applied
also to Territories. This law seems to
have remained in force until the revision of
' ... I .t At- -
tne statutes, wnen tne provision ior me
Territories was dropped. I am not advised
whether this alteration was intentional or
accidental, but as it seems to me that the
Territories should be afforded the protection
which is accorded to the State0, by the Constitution,
I suggest legislation to that eod.
It seems to me, too, that whatever views may
prevail as to the policy of recent legislation
by which the army has ceased to be a part
of the posse comitatus, an exception might
well be made for permitting the military to
assist the civil Territorial authorities in enforcing
the laws of the United States. This
use of the army would not seem to be within
the alleged evil against which that legislation
was aimed. From the sparseness of
population and other circumstances, it is
often quite impracticable to summon a civil
posse in places where the officers of justice
require assistance, and where a military
force is within easy reach.
The Department of the Interior next claims
his attention, in connection with which the
Indian problem is discussed at length.
Among other recommendations, be advises
liberal appropriations for the maintenance of
Indian schools.
On the subject of polygamy and the marriage
relation in the Territory of Utah, he
says : For many years the Executive in his
anuual message to Congress, has urged the
necessity of stringent legislation for the suppression
of polyaray in the Territories, and especially
in the Territory of Utah. The existing
statute for the punishment of this odious
crime, so revolting to the moral and religious
sense of Christendom, has been persistently
and contemptuously violated ever
since its enactment. Indeed, in spite of commendable
efforts on the part of the authorities
who represent the United States in that Territory,
the law has in very rare instances been
enforced, and for a cause, to which reference
will be presently made, is practically a dead
letter The fnet flint nrlliprpntn nf thfl Mor
raon Church, which rests upon polygamy as
its corner-stone, have recently been peopling
in large numbers Idaho, Arizono and other
of our Western Territories, is well calculated
to excite the liveliest interest and apprehension.
It imposes upon Congress and the Executive
the duty of arraying against this barbarous
system all the power which, under the
Constitution and the law, they can wield for
its destruction. Reference has been already
made to the obstacles which the United States
officers have encountered in their efforts to
punish violations of law. Prominent among
these obstacles is the difficulty of procuring
legal evidence to warrant a conviction, even
in the case of the most notorious offenders.
Your attention is called to a recent opinion
of the Supreme Court of the United States,
explaining its judgment of reversal in the
case of Miles, who had been convicted of
bigamy in Utah. The Court refers to the
fact that the secrecy attending the celebration
of marriages in that Territory makes
the proof of polygamy very difficult, and
the propriety is suggested of modifying the
law of evidence, which now makes a wife
incompetent to testify against her husband.
This suggestion is approved. I recommend,
also, the passage of an act providing that in
the Territories of the United States, the fact
that a woman has been married to a person
charged with bigamy shall not disqualify her
as a witness.upon his trial for that offense. I
further recommend legislation by which any
person solemnizing a marriage in any of the
Territories shall be required, under stringent
penalties for neglect or refusal, to file a certificate
of such marriage in the Supreme
Court of the Territory. Doubtless Congress
may devise practicable measures for obviating
the difficulties which have hitherto attended
the efforts to suppress this iniquity. I assure
you of my determined purpose to co-operate
with you iD any lawful and discreet measures
which may be proposed to that end.
On the subject of education, the President
says: Although our system of Government
does not contemplate that the Nation should
provide or support a system for the education
of our people, no measure calculated
j to promote that general intelligence and
! virtue uDon which the perpetuity of our insti
tutions so greatly depends, have ever been
regarded with indifference by Congress or the
Executive. A large portion of the public
domain has been from time to time devoted
to the promotion of education. There is now
a special reason why by setting apart the proceeds
of its sales of public lands, or by some
other course, the Government should aid the
work of education. Many who now exercise
the right of suffrage are unable to read the
ballot which they cast. Upon many who
had just emerged from the condition of
J
slavery were suddenly devolved the responsibilities
of citizenship in that portion of the
country most impoverished by war. I have
been pleased to learn from the report of the
Commisioner of Education that there has
lately been a considerable increase of interest
and effort for their instruction, but all that
can be done by local legislation and private
generosity should be supplemented by such aid
as can be constitutionally afforded by the National
Government. I would suggest that if
any fund be dedicated to this purpose it may
be wisely distributed in the different States,
according to the ratio of illiteracy, as by this
means those localities which are most in need
of such assistance will reap its special benefits.
Of the Agricultural Commissioner he says:
| The report of the Commissioner of Agricul
ture exhibits the results of the experiments in
which that Department has been engaged
during the past year, and makes important
suggestions in reference to the agricultural
development of the country. The steady increase
of our population, and the consequent
addition to the number of hose engaging
in the pursuit of husbandry are giving to this
department a growing dignity and importance.
The Commissioner's suggestions touching
its capacity for greater usefulness deserve
attention, as it more and more commends
itself to the interests which it was created to
promote.
The report of the Commissioner of Pensions
is discussed at length and the propriety suggested
of making some special provision
for the prevention of fraud in this department.
There are now pending for
settlement 265,575 original pension claims,
227,040 of which were filed previous to July
1, 1880, and for the probable number of admissions
of these claims, the first payment on
each of which Is 81,350, the sum of $250,000,000
will be required for the item of the first
payments alone.
He advises appropriations for such internal
improvements as the wisdom of Congress
may deem to be of public importance, and
urges the necessity of improving the navigation
of the Mississippi River.
Considerable space is devoted to discusj^ng
and advocating civil service reform ; to the
subject of competitive examination for office ;
and to District of Columbia affairs; to
the decline of the merchant marine of the
United States; and the message closes as follows
:
The importance of timely legislation with
respect to the ascertainment and declaration of
the vote for Presidential electors was sharply
called to the attention of the people more
than four years ago. It is to be hoped that
some well defined measure may be devised
before another National election, which will
render unnecessary a resort to any expedient
of a temporary character for the determination
of questions upon contested returns?
questions which concern the very existence of
the Government and the liberties of the people?were
suggested by the prolonged illness
of the late President and his consequent incapacity
to perform the functions of his office.
It is provided by the second article of the
Constitution, in the fifth clause of its first
section, that in case of the removal of the
President from office, or of his death, resignation
or inability to discharge the powers
and duties of said office, the same shall devolve
upon the Vice-President What is the
intendment of the Constitution in its specification
of inability to discharge the powers
and duties of said office as one of the contingencies
which called the Vice-President to exercise
Presidential functions ? Is the inability
limited in its nature to long continued
intellectual incapacity or has it a broader
import ? What must be its extent and duration?
How must its existence be established? '
Has the President, whose inability is the subject
of inquiry, any voice in determining
_t -At i. _ IL.
wueiner or not 11 exists, or is toe aeeisiuu ui
thiit momentous and delicate question confided
to the Vice-President, or is it contemplated
by the Constitution that Congress should
provide by law precisely what should constitute
inability, and how and by what tribunal
or authority it should be ascertained ? If the
inability proves to be temporary in its nature
and during its continuance the Vice-President
lawfully exercises the functions of the
Executive, by what tenure does he hold his
office ? Does he continue as President for the
remainder of the four years' terra ? Or would
the elected President, if his inability should
cense in the interval, be empowered to resume
his office, and if, having such lawful authority,
he should exercise it, would the VicePresident
be thereupon empowered to resume
his powers and duties as such ? I cannot
doubt that these important questions will receive
your early and thoughtful consideration.
Deeply impressed with the gravity of the
responsibilities which have so unexpectedly
devolved upon me, it will be my constant
purpose to co-operate with you in such meas
ures as will promote the glory of the country
and the prosperity of its people.
Chester A. Arthur.

"SOMETHING ELSE !?
Mr. Editor: Every man has his peculiars
ty, not to say idiosyncrasy. What is true of
a single individual, is also true of many individuals
congregated together, who are subjected,
to a greater or less extent, to the same
influences.
The writer has heard that it has been said
of your town, that it is the most quiet town in
South Carolina. As quietness suggests rest,
men like myself, ever "on-the-wing," turn towards
Yorkville as naturally as mortals sigh
for the rest that is buried in the fabled waters
of Lethe. To complain, then of one
idiosyncrasy (pardon the use of the word) of
the merchants in Yorkville, or of their clerks,
may be an ungrateful, if not presumptuous,
act on my part. Withal, it is a small matter,
if I have found it a source of annoyance.
And yet, in no single instance have I entered
any merchant's place of business in Yorkville?perchance
to purchase a cigar?and
been permitted to retire without the inquiry,
"Something else?" or similar words to ?,ne
