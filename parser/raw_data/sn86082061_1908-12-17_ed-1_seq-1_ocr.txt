laat at a o'clock Tuesday morning a.'ter a
few days of rapidly failing strength doe
to a general weakening of tbe vital force.

WATER, WATER. THE CRY.
Reservoir Naarly Emptied, Dua to a
Cloaed Pipe-
A traveller in Arizona was told by a loy
al denizen of one of those woe-begone,
(Trout h-atricken, Greaser-ioteted towns.
that tbe place waa all right except in one
or two particulars. "AH it needs.", be
aaid, "ia more water and a tittle better
society."
Randolph lead the world in society, to
be sure, but ia nearly aa destitute ot wa
ter as tba Arizona town aforesaid. In
deed, for a few daya tbe past week it
looked as though Our citizens would go
aa dry aa the proverbial codfish.
Tbe newly acquired Soper springs were
connected in and tbe water started a week
ago Sunday. Tha condition of
reservoir waa then not bad, and with
ttia addition a gain was looked for. But
almost Immediately the water level began
to lower with startliDg rapid it j. Aa thia
came in conjunction with tbe very cold
snap of early laat week, tbe loss waa
attributed to tba practice some water
patrons bava of letting faucets run at
night to prevent freezing, and notice
waa given tbit thia must be atopped.
An inspection ot every bouse in the vil
lage waa madd to check any waste o
water, and soma losses ot this kind were
discovered. But altogether it did not seern
to fully account for tbe condition, nor
did the reforms achieve the desired result.
Finally, at a meeting ot tbe water com
missioners Friday forenoon, it waa voted,
aa a last resort, in order to prevent the
freest ng of the village mains and tba
possible destruction ot much of tbe sys
tem, aa well as to provide tbe water
actually needed by patron, to pump
from the branch into tbe main. A loca
tion waa selected opposite School street,
on land of M. F. Preston, where it
waa planned to run the village road
roller, whom 25-borsepower engine ia
adapted to any work of thia nature. A
I tour-inch pipe waa to ha laid to the School
street main and a large pump aeenred,
' to be run by tba roller engine. The
I point cbosen was ia tbe running stream
I above tba mill pond setback, and likely to
be aa free from contamination at this sea
son of tba year aa any open brook or
river. It waa also voted to purchase of the
Sargent, Ogood A Rouady company an
eight-horsepower Abenaque gasolene en
gine to be Installed at tbe Foreat street
reservoir. Thia reservoir .had filled, but
tba water t.i tn strongly Impregnated
with lime oa xcont of tb cement ased

and required to ba emptied and filled

Doath of Miaa Elian C. Grlawold.
Miss Ellen C, elder daughter of Mrs.
D. C Grisaoid of Boeton and grand
daughter of the lata Mr. and Mrs. Loren
Griawold ot Kaodolph, died Sunday at
the borne of bermotber at 180 Hunting
ton avenue, Boatcn.
A short time ago Miss Griswold under-'
went a surgical operation tor a trouble
dating back to September, at which time
abe was visiting in Waban and slipped oa
the platform at the railroad atation. Sbe
did not think sbe waa badly hurt and
continued teaching until five weeks ago.
wben she vss taken ill in school and car
ried home. Though tbe operation waa
deemed successful, her recovery was slow .
and sba suffered also from extreme aerv
onsnesa. arising1, it ia believed, from the
tbelgtrain attendant npon her transfer from
the Girls' Latin school to the Dorchester
High school against tbe win bee of many.
She waa educated in tbe public schools,
of Boeton and was a graduate of tbe
Girls' Latin school, tn which sbe taught
13 years.
About three years ago Miaa Griswold.
with her mother and sister, Katharine
was at tha Center several weeks during
the summer, revisiting tbe mother's old
home, and in the midst ot tbeir pleasant'
outing came tha dreadful tidings tbat
the only son and brother, Loren Gris
wold, 2d, wbila bicycling in Naw Hamp-.
shire, bad been run over and killed by a
train at Lancaster, N. H. In this third
great affliction, the two surviving mem
bers ot a sadly depleted family will bava
tbe ympatby of tbeir many Randolph
friends.
The funeral of Miss Griswold was held .
In Emmanuel church at noon Tuesday,
Bev. Elwood Worcester, D. D.K the rec
tor, officisting. There waa no music, no
pail hearers, no as ber.
All of Mi Griswold's pupils in the
Dorchester High school were present; also
a large number of those whom sbe form-,
erly served in tba Girls' Latin school..
There waa also a representation from Rad-.
cliffe college. .
The body waa taken to Forest Hill
cemeterv, where tbe burial was private. ,
Misa Griswold's life work waa tbongbt
worthy of the following editorial mention '
by tbe Boston Herald, in Toesday'a issue:
' "Misa Ellen Griswold was one of tba
beet known and one ot tba moat highly- j
honored teacher ia tbe Boeton public
school. Her death ia deplored by all
wbo knew ber and, wa believe, by alt"
wbo ever heard of her. Her long term of
service bad endeared ber to many pupila
and to many borne. Her influence
apread far, as does tba influence of all
good teachers. She wa a graduate of the
Girls' Latin school, where sbe taught for
many year before aha waa transferred
last January. Her heart waa ia tbat ,
school and in few work. Sba waa a!to-
i.per fT.ii li4 fi
week, derided to tnske a tiornugh inspec
tion ot the whole eastern feed supply and
see if all tbe water normally received
from that direction waa coming. Tbey
ecrm ascertained that tbera waa trouble oa
the main Una above tbe bridge-oa tba
Tilsoa flat a little distance up on tbe
Iwtr-inch pip above ita junction with the
four-inch pipe. No water at all was com
iog from tbe Mono and Daraon springs,
which, with tbe loas of tbe Soper springs,
meant a catting off of seven springs In all
for a fall week and easily explsined the
drop In tbe reservoir level, Tba pipes
war evidently frozen, and a break waa
found part way up tba Slack bill, with
tha water escaping. It wa at first sap
posed to be due to tbe cold weather and
tba sluggish running of tha diminished
flow in tbe pipes, but the commissioners
found another cause for it presently. Tbe
gate at the Tilson bridge had been abut off
w ben tbe Soper pipe was connected and
waa still closed laat Sunday, cutting off
tba whole aupply above and explaining
the treezeup. It developed tbat a work
man had been told to turn on the gate,
but bad forgotten or neglected or failed
property j to do so. and the break had resulted In
and constantly improved it, greatly en- j Consequence. Monday, it w as but tbe
Isreing tha house and putting it Into . WOrk of a few boora to thaw tba olpe,
modem shape. He eold the hotel in mend tbe break and restore tbe flow "from
March, 1907, and retired from tbe hotel , the Morse and Damon springs. A percep
bueines. i tible gain in tbe reservoir ensued, and ia
Mr. Yarrington wa popular with tbe j continuing. T"e danger point has not
traveling public and maintained a sue- j ben4aesed yet. but with care and atten-
russion concerning the administration of
tha schools. Sbe shrank from tbe notori
al, but bore it all with gentla dignity,
which greatly increased tbe already great
general respect for , bar. Sba waa thor
oughly loyal. But ft hurt her to feel, aa
sbe did feel, tbat ber years of steadfast
labor and her devotion to duty aa sba
aaw it were not appreciated nor under
stood in official quarters. Sba was oour-.
ageona aa well as loysL and sba showed
ber coarag again wben after her recent

In view of this turn In events, tbe com
miesionera bave decided to hold In abey
ance tbeir plana for pumping from tbe
branch. They will re-lay tbe pipe from
tbe Soper spring, wbich waa consider
ably shattered by its freezing, putting in
a smaller pipe to give a faster flow and
possibly placing tbe pipe a few inches
underground. Thia will give about ten
gallons a minute. The Forest street
reservoir will be ready to empty in a day
or two, probably aa soon aa tha new en
gine can arrive and be set up. This
water added to the system ought to help
materially. The plan ia to pump this
water in as faet aa tbe reservoir fills, once
in four or five daya, as long an needed.
