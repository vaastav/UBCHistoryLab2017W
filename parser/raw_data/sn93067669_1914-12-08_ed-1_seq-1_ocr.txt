where the Germans hold a very
strong position, the Allies are begin
ning to feel their way eastward.
The same process ls being followed
along the whole front The official .
statement speaks of "the superiority
of our offensive," and the "marked
advantage" of the French artillery
over that of the Germans.
I The advance in the northwest bss
ended for the present? st least, tn the
opinion of many, the German menace
of the coast ports. It is believed
that so long as the Gormans aro com
pelled to keep up the strength of their
army in the-east,-they will be unable
to assume the offensive in the west.'
There is a report, however, that the
Germans have kept the pick of their
Western army in the Aise valley
whence, at an opportune moment,
they cen hurl it afainfet the French
linea and make another effort to get
through to Paris.
King Peter, of Servia, who has been

The court's action ends attempts to]

Attorneys for Frank first sought the j
writ for review in ah application to

cation. The effort was renewed by I
application to Justice Holmes, who
likewise denied the writ.

Charles W. Rober teem, formerly a
State detective under.OoVernor Bless*,
was shot and Instantly killed late yes
terday afternoon at - Pendleton by
Chief of Police 8. H. Whitlock ot that
place. Causes underlying the tragedy
were not revealed last night, and, lt
was authoritatively stated, if these are
not shown today at the inquest
lt ls probable that the trial of the case '
will bring to light some interesting
details.
Whitlock was brought to Andersorr
last night by Sheriff Ashley and lodg- ,
ed in the county Jail. Interviewed up
on his arrival by a representative of
The Intelligencer, he stated that he
knew nothing as - to events
Immediately preceding the kill
ing, and did not know that
be had shot .Robertson, until .ad
vised so by the physician,who dress
ed severe wounds which bad boen in
flicted on bis head with a bludgeon of
some description. "I was standing in
Campbell's atore," said Whitlock,
"when someone approached'rae mai
behind and struck me a terrific ?dow
In the beear
handle. I do not remember luring ani
on enjone; and did not knoar what had
taken place until I waa told by Doc
tors Watkins and Day, who dressed my ,
wounds."
Several questlonr e put to the
prisoner by Th? L*" ^ Ccer report
e-, but e??.tha? \s* sad ?rom
him was that he knew nothing what
had. happened. When asked lt he hsd
seen Robertson at any tims during tea
day previous to the difficulty In the
store, Whitlock replied that he didn't
know, ttfat he might have seen him
for all he knew. Sheriff Ashley ked
so little time at Pendleton tb-* kc .
did not make aa investigation ot the
case, but returned immediately upon
the first train with the prisoner. It .
is understood that a Jury of Inquest
was Impanelled last night for the pur
pose of viewing the body in order: .
that lt might be removed to tho the
home. The coroner will go np to.
Pendleton thia morning and conduct
the usual investigation.
It was learned from reliable source
that Whitlock and Robertson had net
been on the best ot terms for sonia
Urne, sud it is thought that bad bleed
was probably at the bottom ot the
tragedy. As to circumstances lead
ing up to the killing, however? noth
ing could he learned. As stated, the
sheriff did not have time to make an
investigation of tba affslr; and tele
phone coiumunlcstioa with Pendleton
lest night could not be had.
Up until something like a year age?
lt is stated, Robertson held a com
mission sa a State defectiva anaer

worked at Chesterfield with Sheriff D.
P. Douglass. Since the election ot Mr.
Manning as gove-nor, it la under

chief of police at Penlaton and ked
been making bia home thora for a
number qt years. He ls said to have
been exceptionally popular in bia
community.
8. H. Whitlock stated tot night
that he had been ebie* ot police at
Pendleton tor ll years. That be had
been dealth a terrine blow in . the

from the spectacle which he nra*
seated when brought to th? county

Though direct Information relative
to the homicide could not he had last
