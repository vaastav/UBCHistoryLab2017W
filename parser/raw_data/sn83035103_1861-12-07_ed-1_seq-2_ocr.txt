The war continues. In considering the pol
icVW lo adopted for suppressing the insurrec-
: tirtn; I have been nnxhtiis and careful that the
inevitable conflict for the purpose shall mt do
gencrrte iiiio a vidlent awl ronlorscless revo
lutionary trtgilo. I have, therefore, in eve
ry case; thdught it proper to keep the integ-
rity of tltiS (.'iiion prominent as the primary
' object of the contest on our part, leaving all
questions which arc not of vital military im-
: portance to the more deliberate action of the
' Legislature. In the exercise of my best dis
cretion, I have adhered to the blockade of tho
porta hold by the insurgents instead of putting
- in force bv proclamation
" enacted at the last session
; ports. S i also, oluymg the dictates of pru
dence, as well as the obligations of laws, in
stead of transcending, I have adhered rW the
' act of Congress to tunfiscatc pmjicrty used for
instirrectiiirtry purposes. If a new law upon
the saute subject shall be proposed, its pro
priety will be duly considered. The Union
tWttst W preserved, and hence, all indispen.si-
hr means must lie enjlycL Wo should
not be in li.Hte to dctenriine that radical and
extreme nt easting which may Wiu-h the loy

The inatt 'iiral address at the beginning if the
administration, and the message til Congress
' at the late special session, wore both mainly
devoted to the domestic controversy out of
which the insurrection and consequent war
have sprung. Nothing now occurs tc5 add 'r

purposes stated find expressed in those dH.-ol

the Union peaceably expired with the assault

what has occurred since may not be unptHra:

gents claimed a strongs upport from north of
"Mason and Dixon's line, and the friends of
the Union were not free from apprehension
on that. ptMtit. This, however, was soon set
tled dcHrtit'ely and on the right side. South
of the line, noble little Delaware led off right
from tlte lint. Maryland was made to seem
against the Union, and our soldiers were as
sailed, bridges were burned and railroads were
torn an within her limits, and we were many
days at one time without the ability to bring
a single regiment over her soil ttf the capital:
Now her bridges and r.iilroads are repiiifed

have solved the cotton question.- Within a

ton already stored will bo sent fcrtfard to mar
ket, and the crops will Ins galherevl and fiif
tvarded without delay. There will txi ntf oc
casion for maniifruttiirers, foreign or domestic,
to desire the breaking of the blockade of South
ern ports. The Union navy and army have
opened the way to supply all the demands for
this great staple, the proceeds of the sale of
which will lie applied to the payment of the
negroes will thus be made available, ami until
the cotton-growing communities in which the
Cotton is fUund rctitrn to their allegiance, the

ing paragraph; ' ' ' '
".Meanwhile-, however much it may Alarm
'grieve ua, wo are bound to say we are go
ing to trust to God and get along without
England. Laughter. Of all the advice
that has been given, while it may seqm to
those who know not the nature of our insti
tutions most rational, there is none that chimes
more with the Northern feeling than this
to make a declaration of emancipation to set
tle this difficulty ; and yet neither the popu
lar impulse nor the foreign advice can be fol
lowed. We must conduct this icar by and Qirotujh
our institutions, or qlsO we must declare that
our institutions have failed, and that wc have
reverted to original principles. There is only
one or Ihe other of these courses. . Tho last
we cannot and shall not do. Wo aro not go
ing to say to the world that Republican insti
tutions have so signally failed that wo must
aUandwa them and reestablish other ones. No
man will sec that. We wiw boast bf tttir
Constitution, must not violate it osmelves m
putting down those who violate it. We must
not by congrcssioml legislation dechrt political
emancipation: I wish we could, t wish Adam
had not sinncrl and his posterity had not been
affected ; but tnat does not lictp too matter.
I wish our fathers had stood out against what
are called tho compromises of the Constitu
tion. Better then than now. Tho serpent
just hatched is not half so much tb be feared
as the serpent foil groWn. ' Our troubles have
increased with every generation, and what is
the use in sighing over what can't bo helped.
Gur fathers signed the bond and we accepted it.
Can we afford to breali it for the sake of even so
magnificent a result as the emancipation of the
slaves? Shall wo rend the chrystal ins'ru
ment the joy of the world and our pride? It
is very easy to say, ' now it is a state of war
let us declare emancipation." The war
has not driven lis out of our institutions. We
aro not ourselves in a state of rebellion.' Wc
ennnbt expect by destroying the Constitution
to put down tlte rebellion. If any one ask mc
wlisthcra law Br a constitution is inferior to
original prinrllics of mb'raiity and justice, I
say no ; but plighted faith fs itself in nature of
sacred moral principle. Our faith is given
and must bo kept, ! When we cannot abide
by our promise, then, in methods expressly
provided, we must withdraw the pledge and
the agreements of the constitution, and stand
apart as two separate people."

Since yesterday morning it has been grow
ing cold, until at the timc I am writing, the
snow-flakes arc: flying pretty briskly, but the
boys arc very comfortably fixed for old King
Frost." From every tent you may see the
smoke puffing from the atovo pipes. This
morning saw almost any number of boys on
horscibaCk cttrriing into camp with b"he of the
last inventions of camp convenience and com
fort, a 6id!ill tt-iit stove; which is made of sheet
iron, about twenty incites nigU and" nine in
ches in diameter, and I can assure you it was
really homo-like to sit down by one.
In passing over the camp to-day, near the
outskirts, I noticed a brick dwelling house, of
very good appearance; but one wall had been
entirely removed. I asked some soldiers
standing near, why so good a building had
boon pulled down, and the reply was, "Oh,
wc wanted some brick to build our ovens." !
Tho health of bur boys has been remarkably
goodj owing to t) Watchfulness and kind at
tention of our physician; B. F. Pitman, who;
by-thc way,- is worth a fortune td us. But
all are getting impatient for a fight; and from
present indications I think; wc shall not have
to wait lofcg before we shall be gratified.

An6thcf Hilton Head letter of &6v. 25th
states that a large number of men are mak
ing additions and improvements to the Torts,
and some 1,600 men ate throwing up ft line of
trenches about a mile in tho rear of the forr,
which will cStend afcfiss the island. This is
intended to be a formidable fortification, for,
in addition to the trenches which are tb screen
infantry, here arc, at short intervals, bastions
upon which are mounted heavy siege guns,
part of which are rifled and of the largest cal
ibre. Tho writer says:
" Tho health of our troops here is very good
at present, with tho exception of the 9th
Maine, which has been somewhat unfortunate
in this respect. Our men have fared better
since landing here than tho army regulations
allow. We found large fields of sweet pota
toes, peas, beans awl corn, which looked par
tienlarly tempting to our men, (many of whom
aro New England farmer,) and in fact, already
ripe for the harvest. They therefore imme
diately set about harvesting their crops for
the rebel owners ; and as they were the pro
duct of the boasted soil of South Carolina, not
a few of the men were possessed with a de
sire to try the quality of it, and, finding it very
palatcablc, there is now a good prospect that
the entire crop will be speedily consumed.
We liavc also in more tHari one sense", put an
effectual blockade Upon one of the cotton ports
of South Caorlina, for wc have taken tne har
vesting of some 'of tlib cotton plantations into
our own hards, particularly the 'field upon
which our brigade is encamped". When we
landed wc were ordered back about tvo miles
and to pitch our tents in a Vast cotton field.
The cotton Was ail ripe ixir picking, ami. wo1 at
once set about picking it up by tho roots tb
make room for our tents. We cannot say
that, this is the most profitable mode of har
vesting tho article ; and as this is our first
experience in the business, do not rtt immond
the method lo our Southern " friends," as n
Yankee improvement; Until wet cxjicrinient
further. We can at least siiy tiiat it is the
most expedititjtl? way that wo can cancoiyc
of. f Ho cotton raised here is of the fines
grade sea-islan'cl cotton, and 11 is a pity that
such quantities of it should W wasted. In the
storehouses upon some of the plantations arc
large quantities, which had been picked be
fore we arrived, which has been taken posses
sion of. Also in one storehouse, upon the
north side of the island, wc found seven thou
sand bushels of corn, which our teams arc
now removing to our storehouses. Taking it
altogether; our forces have not only got pos
session of an important point, but a large a
mount of army stores have fallen into their
hands."

TEnriini.E Accieent fbom Cakbon dir,;--On
Thrsday evening last, a most frightful ac
cident occured at Cleveland, by tho cxplosibn
of a can of carbon oil, by wliicrl a Mrs: Kipp;
a respectable Ucnrian laVK'; lost her life;" The
Plain Dealer gives the following account of
horridlc accident: "Sir. and Sirs. Kipp were
sitting up together, having a sociable, com
fortable timc. Mrs. Kipp was knitting and
her husband reading. Fnally he lay down
upon tho lounge and fell asicep. , The light
of tho lamp, a coal oil one, getting dim, she
procured the can of oil and proceeded to re
plenish it. Holding it too near the flame, the
oil ignited and a terrible explosion followed,
blowing the can into fragments and setting fire
to the poor woman's clothe which burned
with frightful rapidity. The husband, awak
ened by the noise; sprang to his feet, when an
awful sight met his eyes, llis wife was
writhing in the agonies of death -her hair
entirely bufne'd from" her head; and her cloth
ing entirely gone with the exception of a
shred of tho drawees. , A portion of the room
was also on fire, but was very soon extin
guished." People hove generally supposed that there
was no danger to fie apprehended - from, the
use of carbon oil, but tho nuttierous casualties'
reported of latej show that it is nearly or quite
as dangerous to handle as fluid1 or camphene,

The Washington correspondent of the New

lations in regard to tho action l tlte army t
Washington during the present winter: :
"That the whole army will not go into
winter quartors here is doubtless true, while,
contradictory as it may seem, it is equally true
that tfcerc will be no general advance wi the
enemy's lines unless howasrJsty KMlit tllerii in
force". JSettft or is thd ";citW!pi! to be 'traniu
forred to South Carolina. What, tliciij is to
be (tone witfi the army ? The policy is to hold
it in hand here and sijipcy erjjcditioiis that are
to be. fi'te l out against tlte Southern coast. A
demonstration may be made on the enemy's
batteries down tho Potomac, which may un
cover his right wing and change somewhat
this programme, but the former policy will
be the ruling one. A little reflection will en
able one to see tho propriety of this. The
public expect large and successive expeditions
to be sent along tho coast; but where are the
men to como from who shall compose them?
Nothing could be moro unwise than to send
only raw recruits; They will need ihc best
drilled soldiers Wc have; and where aro they
to lie obtained unless froni our canips liere'
But how can they be furnished from' washing
ton if there is to bo an advance? We have
rbw toO few, instead of too many; soldiers on
hand for such n movement. It is therefore;
inevitable that the naval expeditions or an
advance movement hero must lie given up.
Which would a wise policy select, ami which
would even the people prefer? The (ma
that have been longest in camp must accompa

in td supply their places, and drilled till ready

The nation has well-nigh jasscd through
the stage of .military prcjiaration, which, says
the Press, was the lirst great step necessary to
tho accomplishment of the gigantic tai-k of
crushing the most formidable rebellion that was
evcr organized. At the outset, confusion and
serious errors were unavoidable. A nation of
millions, most of whom had not only ''ncvr
:e' a squr.dron in the field," but had reverse rl
a regiment of well-drilled soldiers, were to be
transformed into a nation of warriors, and to
lie under the direction of officers who, from the
great number required; were; necessarily com
posed chiefly of meh but little better inforrnrd
ih regard to military affairs tlian the volun
teers iinderthciteomniaiid.
But wc liavc now actually in.field one of the
largest armies in the world, and a large portion
of it is as Well drilled, well equipped, and wel 1
directed as the trained soldiers of Europe.
Gen, McCleilnn is reported to have said, re
cently, that the poorest volunteer regiment in
the vicinity of vVashlngn is as well organ
ized, in every respect, as tho best voliii.tker
regiment engaged in the Mexican' war. .'The
grand review of more than 70,000 trooj's, on
tho 20th. inst, while it wis one of the most
magnificent spectacles ever witnessed on our
continent, only cxibited to tho admiring speiv
tutors a jiortion of ono of the grand division ot
our army. Many of the soldiers then in the
vicinity of tho capital were required to remain
at thoir ustiill posts, to gtwrd agiinst surprise
and to watch over their respective camps.
It should be remembered that we nave at
thrfi moment an army del .nding the Upper Po
tomac; an army occupying the Peninsula .of
Virginia; an arni stationed at Fortress Monroe
awl its immediate vicinity; armies in 'Western
Virginia, under the command of llosccrans and
Iteynolds; 'armies in KentuckvJ under flic-Voin -ma'nd
of Buel, Nelson, and rlchoepff; an armth
ct t'ario, under the command ofGencr.il Grant
an riiiy in Missouri, under the command of
General Uallbck; an army in Kansas and We

Hunter; an army at Pcnufort,r. C; under the
command of General Sherman; an army at
Fort Pickens; and that many troop are station
ed at various military posts acit'ttercd through
the eountfy. (
IMio increase of iwer of tile hilvy is almost
as marked as th increase of tli!i army. The
reliels have already had many d .monstratiotis
of its power in the capture pf vessels which st
tentpted tt) run tho blockade; In the destruc
