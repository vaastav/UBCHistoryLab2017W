WASHINGTON CITY:
1 HI ??WAT Hffftfr I, 117?.
The President's message seems to b? rather
exceptionally well rcceircd by the pres.*,
thocgh there Is considerable discrepancy of
C|?nion m to the point* to it most worthy or
commendation. The New York Tim*i regards
the financial portion a* being moat deserving of
approbation, and uj* no one expected that
4 len. < irant would discuss the aabject from the
star.<tpomt or a theorist, and he does not, bat
'-a remarkable pertinence and directness are
noticeable In his suggestions, and his principles
are extremely sound " The Tribune, on the
other hand, does not find mich to endorse In
the President's financial views, bat concedes
tbat the President represents the Cuban case
"very fairly, and treats it with such dignity and
calmness as will meet the approval or Congress
and the people.'' The Herald regards the mes
sage in the light of a dispassionate record, and
Veneres it was written simplr for the purpose of
( rercnting. as briefly *s deeme<t possible, the
Acts of the Adminisirationduring the pa?t year,
and the legislative measures which the Kxecu
tive thinks necessary or expedient upon oar
foreign and domestic affairs for the genera!
welfare; ami baring thus discharged bis duty,
with his mind relieved, he leaves the work sug
gested to the consideration and the discretion
of Congress. The Stm naturally has no admi
ration to bestow ap<>n anything coming trom
the Presideut, bat admits tbat it presents "a
lair new of the condition of the different de
partments of the Government." The Philadel
phia Pr'Mi praises the condensation shown in
tbe message, "considering how much the Presi
dent had to say," and says "it is a satislaot ory
s'ewaniship on the whole, and he gives authori
ty to what was previously believed." The Rich
mond IHspa'ck says the President "seem* to be
an\ions to do his duty," bat that "his raitare to
refer to l.oaisUna stands in striking contrast to
his solicitude for the negroes In Cab*, who are
not more truly deprived of their rights than are
the white people of Louisiana." The Baltimore
Sun notes a? an unusual omission tbat the mes
sage contains no all-Ion to Divine Providence.
, ?
It Is important in every aspect ol the case
that the nhme of Georgetown should be merged
and extinguished in tbat of Washington. The
two cities are one and should be one in name.
Georgetown baring ceased to be a s-pars'.- mu
nicipality and forming now an integral part ot"
the city of Washington, governed by the same
laws, and represented by the same constituted
authorities, and every day becoming more and
more identified by the increasing facilities of
transit and inter-communication, this nominal
distinction is a positive and manifest disadvan
tage in manifold respects. It is opposed to a
thorough ami cordial unity and fusion of social
and commercial interests. It creates a vigue
i lea of dirersity in substance, as well as in
form, fosters a sentiment of local estrangement
and rivalry, and repels the influx 01 population
trade an.l wealth. It reduces Georgetown to a
suburban grade and obscurity, to a sort of terra
iitfynila to the world at large, while she is
justly entitled to a share of the civic rank and
prestige of the national Metropolis, and to be
endowed with its postal and all other incidental
benefits. It requires the supreme authority of
Congress to effect the new b iptism with this il
lustrious and venerable name. Minor details
may safely be left to the legislature of t.ie Dis
trict. Tbe popular voice is unanimous in sup
? of the proposition. Murmurs of dissent
t-?n the office-holders, of course, are to be ex
pected. Prompt and decided action before
Congress is necessary by the Ir.eud- ot the
measure.
?
Housekeepers in thisse tlon, where anthracite
coal is much o?ed tor domestic purposes, will be ,
glad to bear from Pennsylvania tbat the Coal i
combination is said to be breaking up. A
special to the New York Tin's from Phila
delphia say* that the disturbance in the com- 1
bination is owing to the declaration of inde- j
pci.dence by the Pennsylvania Coal Company, .
* powerful corporation, which controls almost '
exclusively the Pittston coal region. The Penn
sylvania company, although not properly be
longing to tbe coal league, has always combined
with it so far as prices were concerned, but has
now made a reduction of fifty and sixty cents
on all sizes ot coal for December, while the
other companies connected with the combina
tion hold to the prices made in October?the
figures being neither increased nor lowered.
Combining this with the fact that the trade
is unusually dull for the season, those best
informed say that there must be a redaction
of price* at *n early date, and a consequent
breaking ap of the combination. As some indi
cation of the coming collapse, the Philadelphia
and Ke*ding Company, which has been recog
nized as the leader or the combination, has
announced a partial closing or their collieries
in Schuylkill county, as well as ? reduction ot'
ten per cent, in the wages of all the employes
of the company.
There is a disposition on the part or many
democratic journals or influence in Virginia to
tre*t President Grant fairly, and to give him
proper credit for tbe desire on bis part for the
restoration of perfect good feeling between all
Mctionsof the country. The Virginia Sentinel,
a conservative journal, takes the Petersburg
h. I't ami Ayya! to task for Its arraignment of
the President and bis administration because
o( tbe arrest in Montgomery county, Virginia,
recently, or certain parties charged with vio
lating the election laws. After faying that the
administration was. probably, no more respon
sible for those arrests than the writer of the
strictures himself, tbJ Sentinel ad'ls:
??Let the .Ij-i-eal seek other cause of .|iiarrel.
Or. rather, let it condemn the unjust judge or
wocslen beaded ju-y who enourage these
things but, at the same time, re:l'<ct that such
cares of individual outrages will continue t j
happen everywhere, but that the rulers, who
exet ute laws! are not re?|>om-ible for them. And
let it thus seek to allay the bad p i^ions, which
cause them, ami uphold tbe President in his
desire and purpose, which be has plainly indi
cated, to wipe out the rankling memories which
encourage and promote them."

The experiment of woman sullrage in Wyo
ming territory is pronounced a success by high
authority. Gov. Campbell, in his late annual
message to tbe Legislate e Assembly.tba* gives
the measure his unqualified Indorsement:
"Tbe experiment of granting u? woman a
voice <n the government, which was inaugu
rated tor the first time in the history of our
rountry. b> the Legislative Assembly of Wyo
-aiii2. ran win been tried for four year?. I have
Imttcforf taken occasion to express my riews
in regarii to the wisdom and J ustice or this meas
ure ai d my conrlcllon that its adoption had
been attended on.'* by good results. Two years
more of olwerration ,,f the practical working or
the system hare only se? to deepen my con
viction that what we, in ?u.'* territory,' have
done, ha* t een well done, ami on,' *y*tem of tm

Telegraphic dispatches in to-day's Stab in
reference to Cuban aff airs show that wo were
right yesterday in discrediting the New Orleans
sensation stories about the Spaniards fitting out
the Virginias as a man-of-war, alarm of Amert
cans in liarana, Jfcc , &c. It turns out that
those reports were f*l ric*ted from the whole
cloth.
