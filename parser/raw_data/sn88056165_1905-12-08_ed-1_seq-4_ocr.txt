Owing to unavoidable delay we
are not able to make the change in
the Chronicle we hoped to thiB
week but will make it next week
without fail.
An Anti-Mustache and Whisker
club has been organized at Weiser
and Borne painful sights are to lie
seen since some of the fellows have
abbreviated their hirsute adorn
ment.
President Roosevelt has issued
his message to congress hut it is
such a lengthy article that lack of
space prevents us from publishing
it. The message, however, is char
acteristic of the man and is one of
the best issued in recent vears.
If you toot your little tooter
And then lay aside your horn,
In ten short days there's not a soul
Will know that you were horn;
The man who gathers pumpkins is
The man who plows all day,
And the man who keeps a-humping
is
The man who makes it pay.
While the announcement of the
letting of the contract for the con
struction of the Northern Pacific
line across the prairie has not been
made it is expected daily and will
be the signal for the commence
ment of great activity in all lines
in this country. It is doubtful if
the labor supply will equal the
demand.
If a couple more tracts of land
in and around Cottonwood could
be purchased by some enterprising
people who would put them on the
market at reasonable prices we
could expect to see the town take a
start next spring and develop a
growth that would astonish the old
settleis. Right prices and a little
boosting is all that is needed.
The way President Roosevelt is
bringing to light the grafters and
dishonest government servants re
minds one of Rider Haggard,s
African tale where the Zulu king.
Chaka, had his doctors "smell out"
the witches, except that Chaka
had the heads cut off of those he
disliked while the president severs
the official heads from those who
have not performed their duties
properly.
Late reports state that engineers
of three or four different railroads
are now fighting to secure the Lo
Lo pass which certainly means one
or more transcontinental lines be
ing built through central Idaho
within the next couple years.
And every indication points to
the Harriman people extending
their line from the south to connect
with the joint line on the prairie.
Evidently Idaho is to be the scene
of great railroad activity in the
near future.
