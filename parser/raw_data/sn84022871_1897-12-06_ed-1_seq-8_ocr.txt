WASHINGTON LETTER.
fSPEIAL COREB8PONDESCB OF THE MONITOR.
Washington, Nov. 29. IS 97.
Republican conferences are the or
der of the day, as Senators and Repre
sentatives arrive in Washington.
President McKinley, having finished
his annual message to Congress and
got it into the hands of the printers,
is devoting a considering portion of
his time to conferring with prominent
members of the party as to the legis
lation of the session. He is particu
larly anxious that whatever party
measures are brought before Congress
shall have the united support of re
publicans, and he is losing no oppor
tunity to impress that idea upon those
with whom he talks. While not ex
pecting that all his recommendations,
financial or otherwise, will be favor
ably acted upon by Congress, he be
lieves that by good management,
some of them can be put .through.
There are reasons for the belief that
a sufficient number of Senators will
under certain circumstances vote
with the republicans in the Senate to
pass several bills that will greatly
strengthen the administration and
benefit the country. It is not deemed
expedient to specify these measures
at this time, but just wait and see if
the President does not justify his rep-'
utation as a harmonizcr.
It is refreshing after reading the
numerous jingo schemes advanced
just now to find the following sensible,
language in tha annual report of the
Secretary of the navy: "Additions to
our fleet may be hereafter necessary
to bring it up, in case of an emergen
cy, to an extent commensurate with
the growing necessities of the country,
especially in view of the development
of Alaska, which is a continent in it
self, and of the possible annexation
of islands in the'Pacific. On the other
hand, it is a mistake not to recognize
that our Naval power has more than
doubled within the last few years;
that the case of any divergency beyond
our present resources is the very rare
case; that until it comes ships will be
gradually taken out of commission
and put into reserve in order to reduce
running expenses; and that a due
regard is necessary to the relation of
the National expenditures to the Na
tional revenues. The department
recommends that the authorization of
new ships by the coming Congress, be
limited to one battleship for the Pacific
coast, where, after the five now under
construction, are completed, there
will be only two, while on the Atlan
tic there will be seven; and also to a
a few torpedo boats and torpedo boat
destroyers, both of which- are com
paratively of little cost, and tnre of
which are desirable in order to bring
this swift, mobile, and handily effect
ive arm of the service up to its place
in the general scheme for coast de
fense." Senator Pritchard, of North Caroli
na, Chairman of the Committee that
is, under a Senate resolution, investi
gating the workings of the civil ser
vice law, says the Committee will
resume work during the first week of
the session of Congress, paying par
ticular attention to the internal reve
nue service, and that its report will
probably be submitted to the Senate
early in January. Senator Pritchard
will not attempt to say what the re
port of the Committee will be, further
than that he thinks it will probably
recommend modification of existing
rules, but his personal opinions, which
b.9 freely gives, are believed to be
about what are held by a majority of
the Committee, and probably are in
line with the report that will be made.
He said: "A too broad extension of
the civil service law is calculated to
weight it down and render it unpopu
lar, thereby endangering its continu
ance. A good principal to adopt
would be that a scholastic examina
tion is proper to determine the fitness
of persons for clerical positions, but
such a test is not suitable to determine
the fitness of a man to fill a position
where the duties are executive. The
idea that the law is a sort of blanket
to cover everything is very unpopu
lar." Ex- Speaker Keifer of Ohio is re
newing old acquaintances in Washing
ton. He says he isn't in active poli
tics, but tries to know what's going
on. Of Ohio matters he says: "Sen-

ator Hanna will be elected, if he lives;
no possible combination can be made
to beat him," and of the silver ques
tion: "It is a very effete question in
my section. It is seldom that you
hear any mention of the subject in
Ohio, and out in Nebraska, where I
visit my oldest son occasionally, I
observe that there is really but little
interest taken in the 16 to 1 idea. It
is true that the republicans were beat
en this year in Nebraska, but it was
merely a rebuke administered by the
voters on account of the conduct of
former republican state officials.
Later, you will see Nebraska getting
back into the republican column and
the same will be-true of Kansas, where
the furore over free silver, has, I
think, permanently abated."
