Ve hope that our Wake brethren
will do all in their power to make
Bro. Parker's visit to this county a
success. Wake cannot afford to lag
so far behind her sisters. It may
not In; out of place to say just here
that the Mecklenburg farmers heard
Bro. Parker gladly and it is expected
that the January meeting will show
morx' than 300 per cent, increase in
the number of Mecklenburg Alliuncc

Parker also rc-organized Subs, in

Tlu4 Fourth District has three rep
resentatives upon the State B mrd of
Agriculture, the former's depart
ment of i he State Government, one
of tbes.- representatives being a city
lawyer, another a city editor, and
the fh;rd a city "business man."
They ro doubtless very good men
in their respective lines, but wo have
not been able to learn just why they
are better fitted t serve on the
Board than any of the practical
farmers of this district, or others in
close t"uch with agricultural inter
ests. In iunrir of the two great religious
bodies they represent, the Biblical
Recorder, Raleigh Christian Advo

Editor Johnson, of Charity and Chil
dren, issued a special edition of his
paper Thanksgiving week, but mod
esty led him to surrender his editorial
space to writers who may have been
as able bat hud not so thoroughly
maste-ted the art of "boiling down"
as he. To our way of thinking,
thero have been many issues of
Charity and Children this year fully
as attractive as the Thanksgiving
number.

FOE A FAIR ELECTION LAW.
We are glad to see that editors
Pearson, of the Morganton Herald,
London, of the Chatham Record,
Caldwell, of the Charlotte Observer,
and Connor, of the Roanoke-Chowan
Times, are demanding a better elec
tion lawl The present one is, as the
Charlotte Observer says, "unjust
and unfair and ought to be repealed."
A fair and honest election law is
truly one of the things most sorely
needed in North Carolina, and the
good 'people of the State ought to
unite in demanding the Legislature
ture to put such a one on our statute
books. And it ought to be'a good
deal' fairer than any law we have
had since the Civil War. Even the
combination of parties that went into
power with "honest elections" as its
battle cry, gave us a law that gave
that combination two registrars and
two poll-holders for each one allowed
the opposition a thing manifestly
unjust. Editor London is exactly
right in the statement that a law
even fairer than that is needed, and
that a just law "would not only be
generally approved, but would create
a kindlier feeling between fair
minded men of all parties."
And just here it may be well to
say that the people generally, and
especially the next Legislature, ought
to labor earnestly to develop this
"friendlier feeling" between men of
different parties. Let us hope that
wo are now closing the era of par
tisan hatred and narrowness that tor
years has cursed the Old North State
and that the new century will usher
in another era of srood feelinjr. A
consummation is this devoutly to be
wished ; and we know of no better
way to begin it than for our Legis
lature which is to meet with the sun
rise of the twentieth century, the
beginning of a mighty hundred years,
to pass an election law fair, just,
honest.

THE NATIONAL LIVE STOCK ASSOCIA
TION. We have received a copy of the
ctill for the fourth annual conven
tion of the National Live Stock As
sociation which convenes in Salt
Lake City on January 15, 1901, for a
session of four days.
This Association stands for the
live stock industry of the United
States, its membership representing
10,000,000 head of live stock with an
invested capital of $300, 000,000 scat
tered through erery State in the
Union. It has, by wise management,
grown to be a power in all National
and State affairs in which live stock
men are interested, and its nets are
read with interest by large numbers
of people.
The coming convention promises
to be the largest of the kind ever
held in the United States and sub
jects will come up for considerati n
which are of the greatest importance
to all branches of the industry. It
is a great pity that there is no live
stock association in North Caroliua
to co-operate with the National As
sociation in matters affecting the
welfare of our stockmen.
MEETING OF THE 2 3 Alt D OF AGRICUL
TURE. An import mfc meeting of the State
Board of Agriculture was held in
this city last week.
One of the most interesting facts
brought out at this meeting was that
in regard to the rapidly increasing
sales of commercial fertilizers in
this State, as shown by the follow
ing statement by Commissioner Pat
terson :
Tons, guano sales, fall '98 31,751
Tons, guano sales spring '99 210,988
Tons, guano sales fall '99. . 33,820
Recepts of sales fall '98. . . 7,938.05
Receipts of sales spring '99 $52,747.01
Receipts of sales fall '99. . 6.764.00
Total tonnage for year '99 244,808
Total receipts for 1899 $59,511.09
Tons sold spring 1900 223,175
Tons sold fall 1900 44.063
Receipts spring 1900 $16,435.09
Receipts fall 1900 $ 8,812.60
Total tonnage 1900 276,238 '
Total receipts 1900. 55,247.69
The above table shows an increase
in the tag sales for 1900 over 1899 of
31,430 tons, or nearly 13 per cent.
The increase in sales for the fall of
1900 over fall of 1899 is 10,243, or
over 30 per cent.
The report of Dr. Kilgore, State
Chemist, directed attention to the
extent of adulteration in canned
goods and other foods sold in this
State, as shown by the several hun
dred analyses made by him this year.
The facts thus made plain ought to
be carefully considered by the mem
bers of the next Legislature and all
persons ipterested in pure food laws.
Commissioner Patterson called at
tention to the importance of the cat
tle quarantine question-and the ne
cessity of carrying on the work so
well conducted by Dr. Curtice A
committee of five was apxjointed to
select a State Veterinaiian.
Much study was given the fertili
zer question by the Board. As a re
sult the next Legislature will be
asked to enact :
"That the Board of Agriculture
snail forbid the sale of fertilizers
and fertilizing materials not coming
up to the following minimum require
ment: (1) Any complete fertilizer
containing phosphoric acid, am
monia and potash, when the sum of
the available phosphoric acid, am
monia and potash do not amount to
11 per centum when added together ;
(2) Any fertilizer containing phos
acid and potash, when the sum of
the available phosphoric acid and
potash do not amount to 10 per
centum when added together ; (3)
Any fertilizer containing phosphoric
acid and ammonia, when the sum of
the available phosphoric acid and
ammonia do not amount to 10 per
centum when added together; (4)
Any fertilizer containing ammonia
and potash when the sum of the
ammonia and potash when added to
gether do not amount to 10 per
centum when added together ; (5;
Any acid phosphate which contains
less than 10 per centum of available
phosphoric acid, and provided
further, no mixed fertilizer of any
kind shall be sold which contains
less than 2 per centum of either am
monia or potash, or both where they
are claimed in the same fertilizer."
Before adjournment the Board also
raised the salary of Commissioner
Patterson from $L,650 to 2,000 per
year; reelected Prof. Gerald Mc
Carthy, salary $1,200, and appro
priated $4,000 for the establishment
of a fish hatchery near Avoca, at the
head of Albemarle Sound.
Reports from all sections of the
State indicate that the acreage of
grain crops is remarkably hirge. We
also hear that many tobacco farmers
will drop the weed for the fleecy
staple next year. In Georgia, how
ever, Commissioner of Agriculture
Stevens says the cotton acreage will
nut be increased.
THE BAPTIST STATE CONVENTION.
The Baptist State Convention, rep
resenting the htrgest religious de
nomination in North Carolina, with
170,000 white members and 1,565
churches, held one of the most suc
cessful, and perhaps the most largely
attended, session in its history in
this city last week.
Better educational facilities seemed
to be the key note of the Conven
tion. Meeting almost in siirht oi
their splendid Baptist b'emale Uni
versity, they were filled with new
;:eal in its behalf, while their devo
tion to Wake Forest College was in
no wise lessened The spirit ot
progress swept over them and
it was resolved to raise $100,000 for
education during 1901, half of this
sum to go to the Female University,
three tenths to Wake Forest, and
the remainder to be divided among
other Baptist schools. More than
ten thousand dollars of the $100,000
was subscribed Friday night.
The selection ot a successor to
Rev. Jno. E. White, who leaves the
position of Corresponding Secretary
which he has filled so ably and faith
fully to accept a pastorate in Atlanta,
was one of the most important act.-
of the Convention. Rev. Livingston
Johnson, of Greensboro, was chosen
to succeed Mr. White. The way in
which Mr. Johnson was sought out
and selected against his will evi
denced the esteem in which he is
held by his brethren.
The Convention seriously consid
ered the factory probiem ana seemed
almost unanimously in favor of great
changes in the present factory sys
tem in this State. Hours too long,
child labor, and other evils were dis
cussed. A resolution strongly en
dorsing the Reformatory for youth
ful criminals was unanimously
adopted. .
On Saturday a committee was ap
pointed to organize a stock company
to own and operate the Biblical Re
corder. Notwithstanding - the re
port published in a certain Raleigh
daily, those who were present know
that this action was a victory, for
editor Bailey and that the delegates
present enthusiastically endorsed his
oourse.
The Convention adjourned Sunday
night to meet in Winston next December.
THIS WEEK'S PAPES.
Our first page contains the usual
number of letters from experienced
farmers. Tha, question of ditching
and drainage is one of the greatest
with which the farmer comes in con
tact and much more ought to be said
and written on it than is now done.
Mr. Barbrey s letter on ditching is
intensely' practical and common
sense.
A series of articles that is attract
ing much attention among thinking
farmers is that now running in The
Progressive Farmer contributed by
one of the largest corn growers in
the great corn State of Illinois, Mr.
J. C Suffern. And one of the best
of the, series is that published in this
issue. Think about it.
Secretary Bruner, of the North
Carolina Department of Agriculture,
calls attention to Commissioner Pat
terson's plan for curing hams. The
good price secured for hams treated
in this way speaks volumes for Mr.
Patterson's method, and we are glad
to lay it before our readers.
The Inter-State Cotton Growers'
Association made no mistake in elect
ing Mr. Jno. P. Allison, of Concord,
this State, Secretary. We are" sure
that our readers will be interested in
his report of the Macon meeting.
There are other articles on our
agricultural pages that deserve men
tion, among them those -contributed
by Messrs. Johnson and Moore.
Young men not yet married will
find much good advice in Frank Pix
ley's poem on pago 4, while those
already married will find some good
suggestions in the article immedi
ately following it.
And now while everybody is dis
cussing the reformatory, the better
ment of the public schools, and the
factory problem, the thoughtful let
ters on page 6 are very timely.
"The schools cannot do their best
work when the home atmosphere is
wrong" a fact that is a great deal
biguer and more stubborn than our
educators seem to realize is the key
note of D. L's letter. A newspaper
of the right kind in the home will
usually increase the efficiency of the
schools 25 per cent. Not every news
paper will have this effect, but a
clean, enterprising family paper, not
devoted exclusively to politics or
sensational news, but giving proper
attention instead to matter for the
homo circle or a children's corner,
will invariably prove a great stimu
lus to educational effort. Few of
the brightest pupils in any school
come from homes where there is no
paper of this kind. The school ques
tion also interests Harry Farmer,
and his suggestive letter on page 1
is worth study.
The President's message in a con
densed form is published on pago 7.
Mr. McKinley seldom makes an effort
to control his party, is its servant
rather than its dictator. Hence there
are not as there would ba were Mr.
Bryan, Mr. Roosevelt, or Mr. Cleve
land President any suggestions of a
surprising nature or calculated to
raie objection from party friends in
the annual message. As the Outlook
says: "The President apparently
does not consider himself the leader
of his party, nor regard it as his
function to outline for it a policy, as
is the function of the Prime Min
ister in England. His message is
largely historical, and in so far as it
looks toward the future its recom
mendations are rather interpreta
tive of policies already approved by
he party than suggestions of a policy
fer the party to adopt and pursue in
the future."
CONGRESS IN SESSION.
The short session of Congress be
gan last Monday. The ship subsidy
bill, one of the most bare-faced pieces
of looting in Congressional history,
bobbed up early and the indications
are that it will soon become a law,
though the disclosure that the buk
of the appropriation of $9,000,000
would go to the fast mail and pas
senger steamers "and not to the ves
sels carrying the actual products bf
the country hits; it is said, alienated
some of the former friends of the
bill.
The first of the bills introduced
in the House ot Representatives was
by Representative Crumpacker, 'of
Indiana, "making an apportionment
of Representatives in Congress un
der the Eleventh Census." It pro
vides an increase of membership
from 357 to 365. The following States
gain in representation : Arkansas
1, Colorado 1, California 1, Connecti
cut 1, Florida 1, Illinois 2, Massa
chusetts 1, Minnesota, 2, Missouri 1,
New Jersey 2, New York 3, North
Dakota 1, Pennsylvania 2, Texas 2,
Washington 1, West Virginia 1. The
following States lose : Kansas 2,
Louisiana 2 Mississippi 3, Nebraska
1, North Carolina" 4, South Carolina
3 Virginia . 1. 5 The Southern States
that would lose representation are
discriminated against because of ne
gro disfranchisement. The bill is
exciting no grave alarm among
Southern members, however. Presi
dent McKinley has declared himself
"opposed to any movement to reduce
the representation of any Southern
State because of restriction of suf
frage." The Army bill has already passed
the House. It provides for a mini
mum force of 58,000 and a maximum
strength of 100,000. the strength of
the army between these limits to be
determined at the discretion of the
President. Some opposition devel
oped in the shape of opposition to
what was termed one-man power,
but the bill passed 166 to 133. An
amendment was adopted prohibiting
the "sale, or dealing in beer, wine
or any intoxicating liquors by any
person in any fort, or camp, or army
transport or upon any premises
used for military purposes by the
United States."
The Grout anti-oleomargarine bill
so thoroughly discussed in The Pro
gressive Farmer last winter and
since went through the House by
an overwhelming vote Friday.
The bill as passed makes all arti
cles known as oleomargarine, butter
ine, imitation of butter or imitation
cheese transported into any State or
Territory for consumption or sale
subject to the police power of such
State or Territory, but prevents any
State or Territory from forbidding
the transportation or sale of such
product when produced and sold
free from coloration in imitation.
The bill increases tax on uncolored
oleomargarine colored in imitation
of butter from two to 4en cents per
pound, and decreases the tax on oleo
margarine from two cents to c.
per pound. The passage of the bill
through the House is a great vic
tory for the dairymen and The
Progressive Farmer rejoices with
them. It is a victory for old fash
ioned honesty and pure food as well.
METHODIST C0NFEEENCE.
The . sixty-fourth session of the
North Carolina Methodist Conference
was held in Newbern last week.
Bishop Morrison presiding. "One of
the first acts of the Conference was
the passage of a resolution express
ing unabated confidence in Messrs.
Kilgo, Duke, and Odell, the losing
parties in the great Gattis Kilgo
case. The character of Mr, Gattis
was also passed, as was that of Dr.
Kilgo. A splendid collection to aid
in rebuilding Methodist churches de
stroyed in Galveston was taken
Thursday. On Friday, a ringing
resolution was passed urging the
Legislature to establish a Reforma
torv for youthful criminals.
The question of Sabbath observance
came up Saturday in the shape of a
strong resolution condemning Sun
day papers, Sunday travel, etc. The
Methodists are proud of their Orphan
age ; one large building is now ready.
Both sexes will be received. Dr.
Ivey was re-elected editor of the
Raleigh Advocate.
Altogether, the Conference held a
quite successful session. Bishop
Morrison said he had neverv presided
over a Conference more orderly or
well-behaved. The next session will
be held in Fayetteville. ; '
The Thinkers,
A PLAIN DUTY.
The Alamance mill men having
shown their intolerance of labor
unions and having undertaken to
starve their employees into submit
ting to their will by refusing to em
ploy any one who belongs to a labor
union, the duty of the Legislature is
plain. A law forbidding such high
handed., and unjust actions, with
heavy penalties should be enacted.-
There is no law against labbr
unions. A member thereof is as
efficient in his work as he would be
if he had never heard of one. . But
there is a difference. The union
man is more independent. If un
justly treated he has friends, whereas
is a scab has only himself to re
dress a wrong. How puny unaided
individual efforts on this line. must
be against the combined thousands
of dollars which those who employ
him have on their side.
The wages of skilled labor in the
last fifty years have greatly risen,
and most of the increase is due to
organized efforts on the part of the

SPECIAL PRIVILEGES TO BNXUS
Now we would like to kn nv
it was that Congress ht wja
should keep all the war taxes
eluding the petty stamp taxes,
they reduced the tax on the eiri.,
tion of National Banks one h;lf j"
it that the National Banks iire
and had to be favored above
simple citizen? On the other hanj
are the National Banks n it payi
dividends ranging from live t- forty
per cent, per annum rigbt ninn-r
laying up a surplus besides?
Take the National Banks of
York city. Out of forty-four h,
only five failed to pay dividends tHe
past year, and only four laiie.itoin.
crease the surplus capital. One paid
150 per cent, dividend, an .tiier 10()
and a third pud. forty-live. Qne
bank niid forty per eent. and an
other twenty. Eight paid six per
cent., five seven per cent.. ix eight
per cent., five ten per cent . three
twelve per cenf., two sixteen per
cent., and one eighteen percent.
Besides paying these dividends, they
added to their surplus capital an
average of over sixteen per sent.., the
total increase in surplus amountm"
to $10,150,600.
Recently the whole country was
startled by the conduct of the cashier
of the First National Bank of vew
York in skipping uway to pure -unknown
after robbing the bank of
$700, U00, wasted through several
years in gambling and hi-jh living.
With' a surplus fund of $5.uuu.000,
and undivided profits of over $1.000,.
000, being a sum eighteen times
greater than the bank's capital, the
amount stolen was scarcely nri&e,
indeed, it was not until a.ttentioii
was called to the theft by accident.
The profits of this bank had ijeen so
enormous that the stock is now
worth many times what it was at
'the start, and this is not an excep
tional cae. Then with what reason
and justice was there a demand made
upon Congress for a reduction of
taxes, when there was no abatement
of other taxes? And why .luui(i
Congress yield to such a demand?
iSay what you will, these questions
must be answered, sooner or later,
to the people who continue to pay
taxes as before.
And another thing Why should
the National Banks be permitted to
issue notes that are not legal tender
in the payment of debts? Alany do
not know that they are allowed
do this, but it is a fact. Tneir n-)ts
cannot be used to used to pay ordi
nary debts except with tin; consul
of the creditor. Nor are tuey boon j
to redeem these notes in gia. it a
lawful money of the United Stutt'S
that is, in silver, greenbacks, etc.
other people may pay their ohiig
tions in gold, but the banks are not
compelled to redeem their notes Uj
gold. In the name of farmers and
citizens generally we would iie t0
know why these corporations are s
favored? Why should any corpora
tion be favored beyond tuesP

against the banks whatever,
