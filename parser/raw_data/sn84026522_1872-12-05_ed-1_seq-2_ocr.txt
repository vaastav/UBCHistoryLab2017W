"The Country i G-one-The
Tribune Is Gone-And I Am
Gone"
Horace Greeley is dead arid the
above are said to have been his last
coherent words.
Horace Greeley is dead.
What a difference the sad an
nouncement causes in the minds of
the Southern people, in contrast
with the same announcement ten
years agol
Times change, and men change
with them. Ten years ago, we, of
the South, considered Horace Gree
ley as our bitterest enemy looked
upon him as a bitter abolition fanatic,
nnd the main author of all our woes.
To-day, his death falls upon our
ears and the sensation is pain and
regret tliat such a brilliant genius
such wholesonled philanthropy
euch universal charity such diver
sified talents has been removed
from American Usefulness.
Horace Greeley, alive, was a man
subject to much animadversion
from us of the South.
Horace Greeley, dead, is recog
nized by the entire nation, North
md South, East and West, as a great
writer as a great philanthropist
as a great speaker as a great polit
ical newspaper manager and, above
all, as a great prrmnal man.
Peace to his ashes ! ! i
The Senatorship.
The agony is over and Hem. A.

The Usury Laws.
"We have always thought that
money "should to placed upon the
snnic basin as any other marketable
commodity, subject to the chances
of supply and demand. -It is, there
fore, -with plea&ure, we notice a bill
has been introduced in the Leg
islature for the. enactment of a law
which makes legal interest G per cent,
if no amount is specified, but permits
contracts at any rate of interest
agreed upon.
We heartily commend this resolu
tion and trust it will become a law.
Money, like any other commodity,
is worth what it will bring in the
market. "
It is a well known fact that the
present usury laws of the State are
dodged or evaded daily, until they
have become almost a dead letter;
especially in our Banks which allow
8 per cent interest on special depos
its, thus necessarily requiring them
to charge a higher rate of interest
in order to make the fine dividends
they do. This is dune by way of
"disccunt" and is considered per
fectly legitimate.
In our opinion this foolish law
should bo done away, with that says
a man may not charge a living rate
for the use of his money, when he
can charge what profit ho pleases on
merchandise or other property.
We see it reported from Washington
that the Comptroller of the Curren
cy, in his annual statement to Con
gross, will recommend the passage of
a law repealing all enactments against
taking interest on loans in excess of
sis per cent. We understand that
the Comptroller takes the broad
ground thai it is impossible to en
force the usury laws, from the ease
with which they can be and are con
stantly evaded: that the laws them
selves are evil ia. their tendencies,
and that Congress should sweep from
the statute book every relic of their
existence. It is believed that if Con
gress adopt the recommendation of
the Comptroller, the example will
result in raforaaiag the usury laws
of the different States.
For some time past, the question
of a modification of these vexatious
and obstructive laws has been agita
ted in many of the States, and, in
some instances, the promoters of the
m moment have been successful in
getting them so an? elided s to be
more in accordance with the spirit
cf the age. In other States, the
legislative bodies have beeii control
led cither "by traditiuna) prejudices
or from a mistsien view of the Mo-
i saic law against usrcu-y: forgetting
Jergoing a great change. When the
proposi iion wr.s first enunciated that !
money was a commodity, and should
be dealt in like any other commodity,
many intelligent men were startled
at its lo!dnes3. But it is now very
generally conceedecl that the opera
tion of the usury laws tends to raise
the rate of interest, under the pres
sure of an active demand for money;
whilst perfect freedom in the em
ployment of money, by stimulating
competition, has invariably had the
effect to reduce the rate at which
loans could be had.
Election of Judges by the
People.
In the better days of the State;
before carpet-bag and scallawag re
construction assumed its sway:
when politics were ignored, and
legal ability considered, it was deem
ed a high honor to be a North Caro
lina Judge.
Then the Judiciary of our State
reflected lustre upon the Ermine in
point of learning, ability, high char
acter, purity and worth.
North Carolinians have a just
pride in the many memorable names
which have added reputation and
fame to North Carolina juxispru
pence. In those better days, to secure the
prominent position of Judge it was
necessary to exhibit the high char
acteristics of legal talents and abil
ities, dignity and strict impartiality.
Under the present Radical system of
elections or appointments these
requisites are done away with.
Everything has changed, and we
are living under a new order of
things. 1
To take a seat upon the Bench a
Judge must be a bitter or active
pailizan..
To be a Judge the man must have
shown undoubted evidence of his
loyalty to the Radical party.
' To be a Judge the aspirant must
fiibt ehow conclusively such service
to the "party" that Trill entitle him
to T,rcr..otioT rnd, consequently,
with Jew exceptions, our Judges are
bitter partlzans, under the ccntrol
1 and inllin sice of party dictation.
So appointed or elected, it is but
a natural . consequence .that they
should lean. to the Radical side on
all questions affecting the interests
of their party.- ... - , '
Seyeral years ago the Kadical dom?
inant party took from the Legisla
ture the right of electing judges and
conferred jt upon the people of' the
State at large.
This, of course, was done in Rad
ical interests, in order to secure Rad
ical Judges throughout the Siate.
The House of Representatives has
recently passed a law which provides
that the Superior Court Judges shall
hereafter be elected by the voters in
their respective Judicial Districts,
instead of by the vote of the whole
State, as under tho present law.
This is a good law, because it is to
bo presumed that the people in the
Districts where the candidates re
side are better acquainted with their
characters and qualifications for the
position than the people in the State
at large- Besides if the Judges are
to be nominated by political caucus
es, one party may have a small ma
jority in tho State, wliile several of
the Districts may have majorities on
tho other side. Then, according to
the present mode of elections, such
Districts would have foisted upon
them Judges not of their own choo
sing, but who have been elected by
the popular vote of the State, and
they may be persons who are exceed
ingly obnoxious to tho masses of
tho citizens in their respective Dis
tricts. Again, if electing Judges by the
people 13 an evil, and this fact seems
now to be generally admitted, the
restriction of the election of Superior
Court Judges to the voters of their
own Districts, is a modification of
the evil, and is ail tho modification
that can possibly bd made so long
as the present Radical Constitution
remains in force.
"A Bird of Passage" Slander
ing the South.
The Washington Xatiunul lirpul
L'cmi indulges in a lot of false and
silly accusations against the people
of the South. In substance, it says,
theNorthern settlers or travelers who
ventures into the South raid dares to
avow that he is a Republican is 'im
mediately ostracised and driven from
society, nd scarcely tolerated." The
statement is, of course, as tuijust as
it is false, and evidently came from
the pen of some vult'ire who steered
South to prey irx)n the people- and
found the plaoe in which he 'camped
too hot for SCtonndr-t-lin-H-i TTiatnmnj.
"bird of passage" from, the North
are "ostracised"' is very true, but you
will always find them belonging to a
class of cattle who had no character
at home, and brought less with them.
They came here to plunder the. peo
ple; they made associates and ron
panions of the negro; they were
"check by jowl" with, him on the
streets, and oe eujiel seats at his tire
siue and tabic at night; filling his
mind v. ith incendiary statements and
arraying him against the white peo
ple "native here and to the manor
bom." Tho citizens' of the South
will ''tolerate" any honest difference
of opinion, and will welcome every
Northern man who comes here with
his money and his industry with
kind feeling for our people and an
honest purpose. But thi3 is trot tho
class of Northern men we have to
deal with. As a rule, the creatures
who come South are in search of of
fice they come beggars and soon
rise to afll icnce through trickery and
fraud. They are the 'mournful facts'
of which Mr. Greeley spoke, and
who have piled up a debt that will
take unborn ge nerations to pay.
Look at every city, county and State
they all want office, and when they
lose, maniptdation is immediately in
voked to secure another. . They claim
to be the exponents of government
and the expounders of our rights.
They want to make our laws and fas
ten their fingers to every purse.
Give us honest Northern men, will
ing to take their chances with us,
men of principle and integrity, whose
minds are not filled with maliee and
evil deeds, and who dream of some
thing else besides how to plunder
our people; and they and their fami
lies will find a hearty welcome. We
want reunion and harmony, which
the North recently repudiated, and
desire citizens from every clime who
will aid us in bringing about such a
result, and put down those who in
voke despotic designs to forward per
sonal deeds of aggrandisement.
This is the feeling of the South, and
by it the people are willing to b&
judged.
