THE PRKSIDBKT'g MBSIA
On the 6th inst., President 'Johnson's
message was read to Congress. It is of or
dinary length, opening with a reference to
the assassination of President Lincoln
eonsiders the .Union indissoluble, ai'd the
oonstitution ample for its maintenance and
for the redrew of all grievances the con
stitution la the-Supreme law the powers of
both the national' and State goTcrnntenta
are limited .the perpetuity of, the consti
tution is essential to State existence con*
aiders military, government an evil to he
aroided when possible the process of res
toration is going on speedily and quietly
the President's policy vf 'reconstruction de
fended reasons for the adoption of the
constitutional amendment restoration of
the United States courts traitors, .must, be
tried andpunished the franchise question
belongs to the States1 the rights of freed
men to life, liberty and the pursuit of hap
piness must be secured, and these people
are promised a fair.trial -magnitude of the
evil of slavery powers of Congress to reg

the Department reports Congress must
provide for paying the national debt it may
be paid in thirty years Great Britain the
ally of the rebels our claims for indemni

of the nation blessings* of freedom. From
this very brief outline-—all we haveioom to
give—our readers dan obtain a knowledge
ef the spirit of the tee!sage.
TWRNTT-IIGHT 'St'»tes have adopted the
constitutional amendment, making.the req
uisite three-fourths number, and Slavery
in the United States abolished forever.
TH« official report of Gen. Grant has
been published, and is quite a lengthy but
interesting document. He details .the dif
ferent campaigns, giving great credit to
Sherman, Sheridan, and others,, but none
to Butler.
THC Chicago Republican, in speaking of
the pitiable depth to which the Democracy
had fallen in voting for James Brooks lor
Speaker of the House, says:
Jeff. Davis in prison. Breckinridge and
Toombs in exile no:hing left but Brooks!
and this is the end of long,years of demo
cratic devotion to slavery To be enrolled

tives as voting for James Brooks for speak

Two chiefs of the Bed Lake Indians,
Nah-gun-e-wan-abe (Leading Father)• and
Que-we-ya (Son of Elder Brother,? visited
our town last week on an errand unusual,
if not unprecedented, in the annals of the
Bed Man. The two or three hours to which
their stay was limited was spent in dicta
ting to Rector Chase an earnest appeal to
Bishop Whipple to send' them seme,one to
toe missionary and teacher to them, their
children and the children of- their people.
They propose with one-third of their tribe
to separate from the main body who grim
ly cleave to 'the manners and religion of
"Nature and* to form anew settlement,
within their legal reservation, to be for
mally and solemnly "dedicated ^o good''
•and to an attempt to imitate .the civilisa
tion of she whitei race.They, pfedge them
selves to feed and clothe a. missionary,
ahould one- be sent to them, .out.of their
annuity. This Offer on the part of be
nighted "Gentiles" is .somewhat novel, and
while it insures respect, for their petition,
it betokens a strange depth of feeling in a
new direction. .If the mere vision of a man
of Macedonia praying, "Come and help
ns," was an assurance to the Apostle Paul
that the Lord had called him to preach-the
Gospel to them, what is to be said of the
actual presence of these savage delegates
after a journey of hundreds of miles in
Winter, to urge their plea for a "Teacher f«
Disappointments may justify.us in not be
ing over-sanguine of the speedy civilising
of any large number of. the Indians but
after nil that .we, have said leco.mmeudjng
such a course to them as their on\y escape
trom utter^.xtinction, we are r.ut-.of ..the
number who. .would.,discourage. ,or, ..make
Jight of any self-originating atteinpt to
rise from their.present degradation, eape:
cially when dignified, by. such a substantial
offer and guaranty.
