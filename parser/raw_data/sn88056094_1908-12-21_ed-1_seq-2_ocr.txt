KIDDED THE OVKRPDOW HIDD
Congressman French has earned
the everlasting gratitude of the peo
ple living in this city, along the lake
shore and In the valleys of the St.
Joe and Coear d'Alene rivers by
voluntarily killing his own bill, in
traduced last session to permit the
Washington Water Power company
to overflow Indian reservation lands.
It will be remembered that at the
last session of congress, through the
efforts of Idaho's representatives
law was passed creating a national
park reserve at the mouth of the St.
Joe river, where people could go for
an outing and spend a time camping
In an Ideal spot. By raising the wat
er In the lake the Washington Water
Power company has practically de
stroyed this park and had It succeed
ed in working its overflow bill
through congress permitting It to
overflow "certain Indian lands" the
greater part of the park would have
been covered with water, and arms of
the lake extended up the St. Joe and
Coeur d'Alene rivers ten to twenty
miles. The passage of this bill meant
that the company would have raised
the water In the lake ten feet—and It
may do so yet If the people permit It
—thus submerging thousands of acres
of the best land in Kootenai county
and ruining hundreds of farms. It
would mean the flooding of the Sher
man addition to Coeur d'Alene every
spring and ruin to many homes, en
tailing a heavy financial loss.
The company should be given all
possible encouragement In developing
its power so long as It does not en
croach upon the rights of Ini'.vldunls
or the public, and when It doeu this
it should be checked. .
The code commissioner will submit
the result of his labors to the coining
legislature for action. This Is proba
bly the most Important legislation
that will come before the session, as
It embraces a complete revision and
codification of the laws, with many
changes, all of which sboulu be care
fully gone Into and studied before be
ing adopted, it is a matter requiring
the closest attention that blunders,
and mistakes may be guarded
agalnat.
The government has Jus: destroyed
®fty barrels of whiskey under the
pure food act. That 'a a good stroke
of law enforcement, as linputo boose
and adulterated foods are responsible
for many of the Ills of the h'.iman
race. Det us have pore foods, puie
liquors, pure drugs aud pure water
Add to these purity of thought and
action, then what a glorious world
this would he.

elation.)
1 met Mian Tully In a boarding bouse.
Uhe was supposed to earn her own liv
ing, but no one In the house knew her
occupation. 8 be usually went out
about 0 o'clock In the morning aud re
rnalned moat of the day, but there was
nothing regular either about her going
or her staying. Sometimes abe would
remain In the bouse for several days
at a time, and sometimes when abe
went out to the morning would return
before noon and not go out again.
There was a good deal about Mlsa
Tully that Interested me. 8be was
never for a long period In the same
mood. One day she would be merry aa
cricket, the next In the depths of
deapalr. Then abe would be subject
to flta of anger, when no one cared to
approach her. Any sensible jhtkoh
may Judge from this tbat Mias Tully
waa not likely to make a good wife,
but I have noticed In young men a dis
position to neglect the girls who are
especially fitted to make homea com
fortable for those who are so const!
tuted aa to make a husband's life
burden. At any rate, I became fasci
nated with Mias Tully's moods. At
our first meeting there was a girlish
gladness about her that waa simply
delicious. A few days later ahe met
me with au Imperious look on her face
tbat well nigh froae the marrow lu my
bones. The next week my pity waa
excited by a melancholy that waa no
becoming than her aprlghtllnesa
or her regal dignity.
It was not long before I was madly
In love. Hut, realizing the folly of
making a life partner of a girl who
waa not only changeable as the wind,
but whom I knew nothing about—in
deed, whose mode of support was
mystery—I fought agalnat my passion.
All to no purpose. I was caught In a
mesh and unable to extricate myself.
One evening Mias Tully and 1 were
sitting In the drawing room—the board
era. seeing my Infatuation, bad by this
time come to give up the apartment to
us—side by aide on a aofa. it was In
the spring of the year, and Miss Tully
was like the season, light hearted, ex
uberant In spirits and. It seemed to me,
willing to listen to love's young dream.
Little by little I turned my words upon
that dream, which by this time had en
thralled me. Miss Tully saw my drift
and seemed to yield to a pleased lan
guor, listening eagerly to what 1 said.
I poured Into her ear all a lover could
say. leading up to a proposal, when she
stopped me and said ecstatically ;
"Bay It all again."
I confess I was pussled-Indeed, a trl
fie put out. To repeat my glowing
words was not to my mind. Fortunate
ly wy embarrassment was relieved by
a maid entering with a note for Miss
Tully. She opened and read It. From
that moment ahe was changed. Her
light heartedness disappeared and with
It her apparent Interest In what 1 had
been saying to her. Smarting under
this sudden Indifference. I left her.
The next evening at dinner I noticed
that Miss Tully appeared to have some
thing on her mind of an exasperating
nature. Her teeth were set, and her
eyes were filled with flashes, coming at
long Intervals, like heat lightning on a
summer night. After dinner 1 was go
ing up to my room wheu she passed me
In the hall, gave me a glance I did not
understand and went into the drawing
room. I followed. We were alone
there, and. turning on me like a fury.
ahe began to accuse me of some unex
pressed crime, working herself luto a
very demon. In vain I begged her to
tell me what I had done. Without
heeding me she talked on, or, rather,
stormed on, till at last, seeing no pros
pect of an end to what waa like a storm
swaying to the east, to the west, any
where, everywhere In accordance with
Its unbridled passion. I left the room.
Its unbridled passion. I left the room.
The next morning 1 made an effort
to escape from this mad creature. I
took an early train. For a week 1
remained away, then, professing to
myself to feel confident of my ability
to resist the fascination, returned to
the house and Mias Tully
UWHBV «UU MISS 1 UU/.
At our flr*t meeting 1 saw upon her
face the most engaging sadness. She
gave me a reproachful look, which 1
took to exnresa iialn that 1 Kid
took to express pain that 1 bad kept
away from her. 1 longed to take her
In my arms; but. with a muffled moan,
ahe went up to her room.
I saw nothlug of her for a week.
Then she was plain Miss Tally, neither
happy nor miserable nor angry. She
gave me a smile, pat out her hand to
me and. Intimating that ahe bad some
thing to say to me, led the way into
the drawing room.
"1 owe yon an explanation," ahe said,
"and 1 am going to reveal to you that
which no one else In this house knows.
I am an artists' model. I never poee,
however, except In proper clothing and
only for artists who wish to catch an
expression of some one of the passions.
They have found me very versatile in
this respect, and I have beeu success
ful. The secret of my success is that
I can at any time work ray self Into
any required mood, and this gives the
artist the expression which comes from
the model really feeling what la
pressed, indeed, it can be expressed in
no other way. When you begun to talk
to ms the other evening 1 was preps*
tag myself to sit for a bride. While
yon were talking I received a note that
the artist would Instead work on s pic
ture representing s tragedy. On your
return I was to poee tor Mary Magda
