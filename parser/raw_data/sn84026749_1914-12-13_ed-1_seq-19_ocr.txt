The American business world found

of the past week. Another factor in
which the entire country Is deeply In

the railroad rate questlon-lf decided
favorably to the transportation lines,
would place the nation's commercial
and financial interests on as stable a
footing as might be expected while
war continues to. occupy the attention
of the greater part of tho remaining
civilized world.
"Big business" has been freed from
much of Its fear by the declaration of
President Wilson in his message to
Congress, announcing the completion
of his program for the control of cor
porate Interests.
Investors, finding that with local
stock and bond trading resumed on the
New York Stock Exchange, there has
been no evidence of the predicted heavy

Railroad stocks, however, were not
the only issues which were on the up-i
ward trend with the resumption of)
&iock iruuinK. ine copper siocks were
also on tho boom. This. was attributed
to a marked Improvement In the copper
situation or the countryr arising from
recent dividend declarations by the sev
eral larger copper companies, and a
growing consumption of American cop
per abroad. For tho first time since
July copper during the past week sold
auovc J3 cents a pouna.
War Orders Continue.
That the steel trade, is slowly emerg
ing from the slough is evidenced by tho
smaller decreaso In orders of tho Unit
ed States Steel Corporation. Tho figures
Just published showed a decrease of
130,000 tons of unfilled orders for Novem
ber, which, while bringing the total or
ders to a new low level since the middle
of 1311, was not so largo a decrease as
had been expected.
Meanwhile, the foreign orders arising
from the war continue to pour in.
Greeco is said to be negotiating,
through A. U. Cooko. the American
consul at Fatras, with Chicago firms for
l,tj6S,W0 bushels of wheat per month, for
whicli it is willing to pay cash.
From Dallas, Tex., reports have re
cently come of efforts on the rait of
agents, presumably representing Ger
many, to purchase 50.000 horses and 12,
000 mules. Tho purchases of horses and
mules in that State, it Is said, will re
sult In tho expenditure by foreign agents
of J3,000,0i.
The manner In which the United
States has evolved from the threatened
panicky disturbances arising from tho
European war Is attributed by Secre
tary of the Treasury McAdoo to tho
formation of the tlOO.000.000 gold pool,
the establishment of the flZZMQ.&V) cot
ton fund, the iwnianco of emergency
currency, and the deposit of crop-moving
funds in tho national banks. These
steps taken by the Government, tho
Secretary in his report says, have re
stored confidence, relieved the situa
tion, and probably saved tho country
from a panic of "cataclysmic" propor
tions. Congress is progressing with consid
eration of the great appropriation meas
