Washington.--The president trans
mitted the following message to con
gress:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
The relations of the United States with
all foreign governments have continued
upon the normal basis of amity and good
understanding, and are very generally
satisfactory.
Latin America.
One of the happiest events In recent
Pan-American diplomacy was the pacific,
independent settlement by the govern
ments of Bolivia and Peru of a boundary
difference between them, which for some
weeks threatened to cause war and even
to entrain embitterments affecting other
republics less directly concerned. From
various quarters, directly or indirectly
concerned, the intermedliation of the Uni
ted States was sought to assist in a so
lution of the controversy. Desiring at all
times to abstain from any undue mingling
In the affairs of sister republics and hav
ing faith in the ability of the govern
ments of Peru and Bolivia themselves to
settle their differences in a manner satis
factory to themselves which, viewed with
magnanimity, would assuage all embit
terment, this government steadily ab
stained from being drawn into the con
troversy and was much gratified to find
its confidence justified by events.
On the ninth of July next there will
open at Buenos Aires the fourth Pan
American conference. This conference
will have a special meaning to the hearts
of all Americans, because around its date
are clustered the anniversaries of the in
dependence of so many American repub
lics. It is not necessary for me to remind
the congress of the political, social and
commercial importance of these gather
Ings. You are asked to make liberal ap
propriation for our participation. If this
be granted, it is my purpose to appoint
a distinguished and representative dele
gation, qualified fittingly to represent this
country and to deal with the problems of
Intercontinental interest which will there
be discussed,
The Argentine Republic will also hold
from May to November, 1910, at Buenos
Aires, a great international agricultural
exhibition in which the United States has
been invited to participate. Considering
the rapid growth of the trade of the Uni
ted States with the Argentine Republic
and the cordial relations existing between
the two nations, together with the fact
that it provides an opportunity to show.
deference to a sister republic on the oc
casion of the celebration of its nation
al Independence, the proper departments
of this government are taking steps to ap
prise the Interests concerned of the op
portunity afforded by this exhibition, in
which appropriate participation by this
country is so desirable. The designation
of an official representative Is also receiv
Ing consideration.
The Pan-American policy of this gov
ernment has long been fixed in its prin
ciples and remains unchanged. With the
changed circumstances of the United
States and of the republics to the south
of us, most of which have great natural
resources, stable government and pro
gresslve ideals, the apprehension which
gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be
said to have nearly disappeared and nel
ther doctrine as it exists nor any
other doctrine of American policy should
be permitted to operate for the perpetua
tion of irresponsible government, the es
cape of just obligations or the insidious
allegation of dominating ambitions on the
part of the United States.
Beside the fundamental doctrines of our
Pan-American policy there have grown
up a realization of political interests.
community of institutions and ideals and
a flourishing commerce. All these bonds
will be greatly strengthened as time goes
on and increased facilities, such as the
r-eat bank soon to be established in Lat
In-America, supply the means for build
ing up the colossal intercontinental com
merce of the future.
My meeting with President Dias and
the greeting exchanged on both Amerl
can and Mexican soil served, I hope, to
signalize the close and cordial relations
which so well bind together this republic
and the great republic immediately tp the
south, betweep, which there is so vast a
network of material Interests.
I am happy to say that all but one of
the cases which for so, long vexed our
relations with Venezuela have been set
tied within the past few months and that,
under the enlightened regime now direct
Ing the government of Venezuela, proli
mion has been made for arbitration of the
remaining case before The Hague tri
bunal.
Since the Washington conventions of
1907 were communicated to the govern
ment of the United States as a consult
Ing and advisory party, this government
has bqen almost continuously called upon
by one or another, and in turn bIy all of
the five Central American republlcs, to
exert itself for the malntenance of the
conventions. Nearly every comphaint has
been against the Zelaya government - of
SNicaragua, which has kept Central Amer
ica In constant tension and turmoil. The
responses made to the representations of
Sentral American republics, as due from
11 United States on account of its rela
tion to the Washington conventions, have
been at all times conservative and have
avoided, so far as.possible, any semblance
of Interference, although It Is very appar
ent that, the considerations of geograph
Ic poximiity to"the canal zone and of the
very 's.bl American Interests in
Cbentratl' Aia give to the United
.I.tatee a 'spedi position in the sone of
these republic athd the CarilBbean sea.

At the date when this message is
printed this government has terminated

ernmnent, for reasons made public in a
communication to the former Nicaragua

such future steps as may be found most
consistent with its dignity', its duty to
American Ihterestr rthd Ity ritoral obliga=

bepartmrent of State.
I earnestly recommend to the favor
able consideration of the congress the es
timateA submnitted by the department of
state and most especially the legisla
tion suggested in the secrtary of state's
letter of this date, whereby it will be
possible to develop and make permanent
the reorganization of the department
upon modern lines In a tnanner to make
it a thoroughly effllcient instrument in
the furtherance of our foreign trade and
of American interests abroad. The plan
to have divisions of Latin-American and
Far-Eastern affairs ahd to institute a
certain specialization in business with
Europe and the near east will at once
comm(end Itself. These politico-geograph
Ical divisions and the detail from the
diplomatic or consular service to the
department of a number of men who
bring to the study of complicated prob
lems in different parts of the world
practical knowledge recently gained on
the spot, clearly is of the greatest ad
vantage to the secretary of state in
foreseeing conditions likely to arise and
in conducting the great variety of corre
spondence and negotiation. It should he
remembered that such facilities exist in
the foreign offices of all the leading com
mercial nations and that to deny them
to the secretary of state would he to
place this government at a great disad
vantage In the rivalry of commercial
competition.
The consular service has been im
proved under the law of April l, 19Wf,
and the executive order of June 27. 1906,
and I commend to your consideration the
question of embodying In a statute the
principles of the present executive order
upon which the efficiency of our consular
service is wholly dependent.
Expenditures and Revenues.
Perhaps the most important question
presented to this administration is that
of economy in expenditures and suffi
ciency of revenue. The deficit of the
last fiscal year, and the certain deficit
of the current year, prompted congress
to throw a greater responsibility on
the executive and the secretary of the
treasury than had heretofore been de
clared by statute. This declaration
imposes upon the secretary of the
treasury the duty of assembling all the
estimates of the executive departments,
bureaus and offices of the expenditures
necessary in the ensuing fiscal year.
and of making an estimate of the reve
nues of the government for the same
period; and if a probable deficit is thus
shown, it is made the duty of the presi
dent to recommend the method by
which such deficit can be met.
The report of the secretary shows
that the ordinary expenditures for the
current fiscal year ending June 30. 1910,
will exceed the estimated receipts by
$34,075.620. If to this deficit is added
the sum to be disbursed for the Pan
ama Canal, amounting to $38.000.000,
and $1,000,000 tq be paid on the public
debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts
and expenditures will be increased to
a total deficit of $73,075.620. This def
icit the secretary proposes to meet by
the proceeds of bonds issued to pay
the cost of constructing the Panama
Canal. I approve this proposal.
In order to avoid a deficit for the
ensuing fiscal year, I directed the
heads of depaqtments in the prepara
tion of their estimates to make them
as low as possible consistent with im
perative governmental necessity.
Civil Pensions.
I am aware that there is a strong
feeling in both houses of congress, and
possibly in the country, against the
establishment of civil pensions, and
that this has naturally grown out of
the heavy burden of military pensions,
which it has always been the policy
of our government to assume; but I
am strongly convinced that no other
practical solution of the diiflcultles
presented by the superannuation of
civil servants can be found than that
of a system of civil pensions.
Frauds in the Collection of Customs.
I regret to refer to the fact of the
discovery of extensive frauds in the
collection of the customs revenue at
New York city, in which a number of
the subordinate employes in the weigh
ing and other departments were di
rectly concerned, and in which the
beneficiaries were the American Sugar
Refining Company and others. The
frauds consisted in the payment of
duty on underweights of sugar. The
government has recovered from the
American Sugar Refining Company all
that it Is shown to have been defraud
ed of. The sum was received in full
of the amount due, which might have
been recovered by civil suit against
the beneficiary of the fraud. but there
was an express reservation in the con
tract of settlement by which the settle
ment should not interfere wyth, or pre
vent the criminal prosecutidn of every
one who was found to be subject to
the same.
Criminal prosecutions are now pro
ceeding against a number of the gov
ernment officers. The treasury de
partment and the department of jus
tice are exerting every effort to dis
cover all the wrongdoers. Including
the officers and employes of the com
panies who may have been privy to
the fraud. It would seem to me that
an Investigation of the frauds by con
gress at present, pending the probing
by the treasury department and the
department of Justice. as proposed.
might by giving Immunity and other
wise prove an embarrassment in secur
ing conviction of the guilty parties.
The Tariff Act.
Two features of the new tariff act
call for special reference. By virtue
of the clause known as the "maximum
and minimum" clause, it is the duty
of the executive to consider the laws
and practices of other countries with
reference to the importation into those
countries of the products and mer
chandise of the United States, and if
the executive finds such laws and prac
tices nqt to be unduly discriminatory
against the United States, the mini
mum duties provided in the bill are to
go into force. Unless the president
makes such a finding, then the maxi
mum duties provided in the bill, that
is, an increase of 25 per cent. ad valo
rem over the minimum duties are to
be in force. Fear has been expressed
that this power conferred and duty
Imposed on the executive is likely to
lead to a tariff war. I beg to express
the hope and belief that no such result
need be. anticipated.
The discretion granted to the execu
tive by the terms "unduly discrim
inatory" is wide. In order that the
maximum duty shall be charged against
the imports from a country, it is neces
sary that he shall find on the part of
that country not only discriminations
in its laws or the practice under them
against the trade of the United States,
but that the discriminations found
shall be undue: that is, without good
and fair reason. I conceive that this
power was reposed in the president
with the hope that the maximum du
ties might never be applied in any case.
but that the power to apply them would
enable the president and the state de.
partment through friendly negotiatiod
to secure the elimination from the laws
and the practice under ,hem of any
foreign country of that which is un
duly discriminatory. No one is seek
ing a tariff war or a condition in which
the spirit of retaliation shall be
aroused.
Needs of the Navy.
The return of the battleship fleet from
its voyage around the world, in more
efficient condition than when it started,
was a noteworthy vient of interest alike
td our citizens and the naval authroritieg
of the world. Besides the beeficial and
far-reaching effect on our perkonai and
diplomatic relations ith the countries
which the fleet visited, the marked suc
cess of the ships in steaming around the
world in all weathers in schedule time
has increased respect for our navy and
has added to our national prestige.
Injunctions Without Notice,
the platform of the duecepkfui party In
the last election contained the following:
"The Republican party Will uphold at
all times the authority and integrity of
the courts, state and federal, and will
ever insist that their powers to enforce
their process and protect life, liberty
and property shall be preserved inviolate.
We believe, however, that the rules of
procedure in the federal courts with re
spect to the issuance of the writ of in
junction should be more accurately de
fined by statute and that no injunction
or temporary restraining order should be
issued without notice, except where ir
reparable injury would result from delay,
in which case a speedy hearing there
after should be granted."
I recommend that in compliance with
the promise thus made appropriate legis
lation be adopted, The ends of justice
will best be met and the chief cause of
complaint against ill-considered injunc
tions without notice will be removed by
the enactment of a statute forbidding
hereafter the issuing of any injunction
or restraining order, whether temporary
or permanent, by any federal court,
without previous notice and a reasonable
opportunity to be heard on behalf of the
parties to be enjoined; unless it shall ap
pear to the satisfaction of the court that
the delay necessary to give such notice
and hearing would result in Irreparable
injury to the complainant and unless also
the court shall from the evidence make
a written finding, which shall be spread
upon the court minutes, that immediate
and irreparable injury is likely to ensue
to the complainant, and shall define the
injury, state why it is irreparable and
shall also indorse on the order issued the
date and the hour of the issuance of the
order. Moreover, every such injunction
or restraining order issued without pre
vious notice and opportunity by the de
fendant to be heard should by force of
the statute to expire and be of no effect
after seven days from the issuance there
of or within any time less than that pe
riod which the court may fix, unless
within the injunction or order is ex
tended or renewed after previous notice
and opportunity to be heard.
Second-Class Mail Matter.
The deficit every year in the post
office department is largely caused by the
low rate of postage of one cent a pound
charged on second-class mail matter,
which includes not only newspapers but
magazines and miscellaneous periodicals.
The actual loss growing out of the trans
mission of this second-class mail matter
at one cent a pound amounts to about
$63,000,o00 a year. The ave'rage cost of the
transportation of this matter is more than
nine cents a pound.
It appears that the average distance ov
er which newspapers are delivered to
their customers is 291 miles, while the
average haul of magazines is 1,049, and
of miscellaneous periodicals 1,128 miles.
Thus, the average haul of the magazine
is three and one-half times and that of
the miscellaneous periodical nearly four
times the haul of the daily newspaper, yet
all of them pay the same postage rate of
one cent a pound. The statistics of 1907
show that second-class mail matter con
stituted 63.91 per cent. of the weight of
all the mail, and yielded only 5.19 per cent.
of the revenue.
The figures given are startling, and
show the payment by the government of
an enormous subsidy to the newspapers,
magazines and periodicals, and congress
may well consider whether radical steps
should not be taken to reduce the deficit
in the postofflce department caused by
this discrepancy between the actual cost
of transportation and the compensation
exacted therefor.
A great saving might be made, amount
ing to much more than half of the loss
by imposing upon magazines and peri
odicals a higher rate of postage. They
are much heavier than newspapers and
contain a much higher proportion of ad
vertising to reading matter, and the aver
age distance of their transportation Is
three and a half times as great.
Postal Savings Banks.
The second subject worthy of mention
In the postoflice dqpartment is the real
necessity and entire practicability of es
tablishing postal savings banks. The suc
cessful party at the last election declared
in favor of postal savings banks, and al
though the proposition finds opponents in
many parts of the country, I am con
vinced that the people desire such banks,
and am sure that when the banks are fur
nished they will be productive of the ut
most good.
Favors Ship Subsidy.
Following the course of my distin
guished predecessor, I earnestly recom
mend to congress the consideration and
passage of a ship subsidy bill, looking to
the establishment of lines between our
Atlantic seaboard and the eastern coast
of South America, as well ad lines from
the west coast of the United States to
South America. China, Japan and the
Philippines. The profits on foreign mails
are perhaps a sufficient measure of the
expenditures which might first be tenta
tively applied to this method of inducing
American capital to undertake the estab
lishment of American lines of steamships
in those directions in which we now feel
it most important that we should have
means of transportation controlled in the
interest of the expansion of our trade. A
bill of this character has once passed the
house and more than once passed the
senate, and I hope that at this session a
bill framed on the same lines and with
the same purposes may become a law.
Conserving National Resources.
In several departments there is present
ed the necessity for legislation looking to
the further conservation of our national
resources, and the subject is one of such
importance as to require a more detailed
and extended discussion than can be en
tered upon in this communication. For
that reason I shall take an early oppor
tunity to send a special message to con
gress on the subject of the improvement
of our waterways, upon the reclamation
and Irrigation of arid, semi-arid, and
swamp lands; upon the preservation of
our forests and the reforesting of suit
able areas; upon the reclassification of
the public domain with a view of sep
aratlng from agricultural settlement min
eral, coal, and phosphate lands and sites
belonging to the government bordering on
streams suitable for the utilization of
water power.
Political Contribution.
I argently recommend to congress that
a law be passed requiring that candi
dates in elections of members of the
house of representatives and committees
in charge of their candidacy and cam
paign file in a proper office of the United
States government a statement of the
contributions received and of the expelp
ditures incurred In the campaign for such
elections and that similar legislation be
enacted in respect to all other elections
which are constitutionally within the con
trol of congresas.
LEVEE FUNDS INTACT
ATTORNEY GENERAL GUION REN
DERS OPINION IN MATTER.
Right to Appropriate Money to Pay
Expense of Juncket Trip
is Questioned.
Ilaton Rouge.-An opinion has been
received from Attorney General Gui
an which upholds the position taken
by State Traveling Auditor Archie M.
Smith, that a levee board has not the
right under the law to make an ap
propriation to pay the expenses of
any of its members as delegates to
a waterways, river and har%r or like
convention.
The question recently came up in
the Tensas board investigation, in
which State Traveling Auditor Smith
criticised the board for its action in
making an appropriation to pay the
expenses of the members to the riv
er and harbors convention.
Some of the members of the board
took issue with the statements of the
traveling auditor, and contended that
the board had a perfect right to
make such appropriations, and to pay
such expenses as were incurred in
the transaction of bu ine:;s and the
gaining of information incident to the
work in hand.
Several of the presidents of other
levee boards have written to the Gov
ernor of the state in rceg'rd to the
matter, urging that they be permit
ted to send delegates to the Rivers
and Hlarbors Congress to be held in
Washington, and that their expenses
be paid from the levee board funds.
Governor Sanders submitted the en
tire matter to Attorney GCneral Gui
on, and the opinion rendered was to
the effect that the levee board finds
cannot be used for that purpose.
In his opinion the Attorney General
says:
"The funds of the levee boards
have been raised solely for the pur
pose of building levees, an'd there is
no authority given them by the Leg
islature of the State for the use of
the same, or any part thereof, for
any other purpose. I have reached
the conclusion that the expense of the
delegates who may be appointed
should not be paid by the boards."
WILL ESTABLISH COLONY.
Large Tract of Land Suitable for
Truck Farming Purchased.
Covington.-A long step toward an
early development of this section was
taken when J. E. Cooper, of the Lou
isiana Fruit anid Truck Farm and
Manufacturing Company, Ltd., of
New Orleans, closed a deal for 4,800
acres of land in one tract near this
place, and far another large tract in
the immediate section.
Mr. Coopr states that he now has
thirty-eight families ready to start
South to settle on this land, and the
representatives of his company in the
North and East are completing ar
rangements with about sixty more
families to come here.
The plans of the company, when
fully carried out, will cut this tract
up into small farms and will be sold
at a very reasonable price to actual
settlers, who will be assisted in every
way to insure their success.
Th New Orleans Great Northern
Railroad has been liberal in its treat
ment of the company, and will make
the most liberal concessions to get
the people here and to encourage
them to succeed. The company has
been promised from 30 to 50 acres
of land to be used as an experiment
station. Mr. Cooper states that this
place will be put in prime condition
and under the care of an expert far
mer the crops planted will serve as
a guide to the less experienced.
Mr. Cooper is enthusiastic over the
prospects of the company in this sec
tion, and states that in the near fu
ture he expects this to be the lead
ing truck shippin" point in the en
tire South.
A canning factory will be estab
lished ta take care of the over-ripe
produce, and in the event of low pri
ces the entire output of the farms
will be canned for the market.
CORN CLUBS GET RESULTS.
Instructor Says Arkansas Boys Grow
Best Grade of Crops.
Baton Rouge.-Something of vwhat
an increase in the corn crop will do
for the state of Louisiana is given
by V. L. Roy, who is devoting his
time to teaching the boys of the
state how to raise corn.
Commenting on the work in hand
lMr. Roy called attention to the fact
that the big end of the corn show
at the State Fair mad made by the
boys of the corn clubs. All the space
apportioned to the clubs was filled
and many exhibits had to be placed
in spaces set aside for general sgri
cultural exhibits.
In quality, as well as quantity, the
boys' corn made a splendid showing,
measuring up fully with the best of
corn grown by the experienced far
mers and planters.
Boll Weevil Too Warm to Hibernate.
Baton Rouge.-The continued warm
weather has restltde in keeping the
boll weevils out of hibernation. This
is the opinion of Willmon Newell, of
the State Crop Pest Commission, and
the situation applies to Louisiana in
general. Usually by the last of No
vember the weevils are in their win
ter quarters, but so far this year the
winter has been unusually mild. In
open weather the weevils move all
around, and have no doubt been very
busy In finding new locations,
MODEL ROAD IN PROGRESS.
Work of Construction Under Supers
Vision of the State.
Batoil Rougo,--Splendid Progress
is now being made in the construc
tion of the model road which is be
ing built out of Baton Rouge under
the supervision of the state. Already
about three miles has been built,
with the exception of the surfacing,
and this part of the work will not
be commenced until the entire road
way for the distance of the parish
is completed. The surfacing mate
rial will then be selected and placed
in position.
The delay In inaugurating the read
construction in the parish was caus
ed by the work on the drainage ca
nal that was necessary to build in
order to drain the water front the low
stretch just outside the city limits.
Now that the drainage has been ef
fected, work on the roadway will be
pushed to early completion.
The progres has been further In
creased by the fact that a number
of convicts doing this work has been
added to the force, and instead of
twenty-five, there are nearly fifty on
the job.
BUILDING BIG PAPER MILL.
Structure is Planned to Admit Easy
Expansion as Business Grows.
Bogalusa.-The plant of the mam
moth Southern Wood Distillates and
Fiber Company, now under course of
erection here for the manufacture of
fiber board, will have a daily output
of fifty tons of finished product, and
a large quantity of what iu known as
mechanical and soda pulp. The site
comprises 50 acres of ground, and
the buildings will have an actual floor
space equal to ten acres.
The buildings are erected in the
form of a rectangle, with fifty feet
of space betw'en each for fire pro
tection, and with the power house as
a central unit. the power house will
be equipped with a battery of Scotch
boilers of the marine type, and 1,000
horse power in prime movers, which
will be distributed throughout the
factory by rope transmission. The en
tire plant will be furnished with the
latest improved machinery, and is to
be equipped with a universal convey
or system which is unique as well as
practical.
The plant has been designed with
the idea of most economical expan
sion, as the supply of raw material
available is suffielent to provide for
the manufacture of at least 200 or
more tons of fiber board daily.
Big Tracts in Chicot Sold.
Lake Village.-Elglit sales of farm
land in Chicot county within the past
few weeks have involved more than
$200,000, and options are held on oth
er property worth double this im
mense sum.
The eight purchases were nearly
all made by parties from Illinois and
New Hampshire, and it is reported
that many more New Englanders will
settle here.
Among the" prominent sales men
tioned is that of the Paepcke-Leicht
Lumber Company, containing more
than 8,000 acres, the Grittman prop
erty, containing 1,920 acres, sold for
$1,900. The Sam Burgie property,
consisting of 320 acres, sold for even
$15,000.
Road Certificates co Begging.
Mansfield.-The police jury met in
special session to discuss the good
roads work in progress in this par
ish, under plans drawn up by Gov
Sanders. The committee sent to New
Orleans reported that no money is
available in that city on the cer
tificates, and that all orders for work
will be rescinded unless the money is
forthcoming to carry out the con
tracts, in which the use of convicts
for road construction and repair is
a part.
Waterworks at Lake Village.
Lake Village.-The construction of
the tower, power house, and the ac
tual laying of mains for the water
works system, for which Lake Village
recently let the contract, is progress
ing. Justin Matthews of Little Rock
is the contractor, and Lund & Hill,
of the capital city, are the engineers
in charge.

This is the burden of parts 4- and 5 of
the report of ('ollr lisiKiler of (irlpra
tions Herbert Knox Smith on tIhI' .uii c .tt
of such exchanges. The practie of dail
ing in future., as it is carried ,n at
present, is cundemtned, although the re
port dies not cunlleln llthe existelite of
the exchange.
"The brief disciui-in of general speeu- A
latiun in this report," says MIr. Smith,
"recoguizes the lios~ibililits for g ,Il in
hIerent in a great central llmarket like a
cotton exchalnge, and the need that this
good be develpedl and evils eliminated
,by regulations in line with economiic
law."
The report is especially condenminattry
of the dealing in futures, branding this
form of spleculatin as pure gambling
and highly injurious to leg itimate trade.
In quotations for "future" deliveries of
cotton the market is si- uncertain andl
so nmanie elements of chance enter into
the transaction that all bids are made at
a mluch lower figure than those offeredl
for cotton actually in existence.
The effect of these fictit ious quota
tions, the report points out, tends to inis-  
lead the c:tton llanter as to the true
value of his crop. honestly grown. In
addition, it leads brokers to "play" hot I
sides of the market to protect tllhemlselves
against loss in such trades, with the re
sult that the producer is forced to pay
in the end, while the farmer loses like

HIS OFFER NOT APPRECIATED
Elderly Gentleman May Have Meant
Well, But the Damsel Was
Suspicious.
The plump waiter girl at the lunch
counter, having nothing to do at the
moment, was trying to reach with her
fingernails a place on her back well
up between the shoulders, but with
her short and chubby arms she was
unequal to the task. In vain she
squirmed and struggled, and twisted
her face. She failed to achieve the
desired connection.
The elderly man on the outside of
the counter, who has been fighting a
piece of overdone steak, leaned for
ward and spoke to her in a low tone,
but with intense earnestness.
"My dear young woman," he said,
"pardon the freedom of a man who
has grandchildren almost as old as
you are, but if you will come a little
closer I shall take pleasure in scratch*
I ug that spot for you, as I see that you
can't quite-"
"Mind your own business!" she
snapped.
How seldom-O, how seldom-is a
good deed or a generous impulse a.
preciated in this ungrateful world!
Red Cross Christmas Stamps.
The Red Cross Christmas Stamp
crusade against tuberculiosis promises
this year to be broader in extent than
ever before. While last year less than
twenty million stamps were sold, the
present indications point to a sale of
nearly fifty million for this year.
The Red Cross Stamps are issued by
the American National Red Cross, and
are sold for one cent each. They are
designed to be placed upon letters and
mail matter during the holiday sear
son. The money derived from the saie
of these stamps will be devoted to tu
Sberculosis work in the localities in
which the stamps are sold. In this
manner it is expected that about $400,
000 will be realized for the campaign
against tuberculosis in all parts of the
United States.
f There All the Time.
SIt is told of Dr. Thorold that he was
Sonce asked to give away the prizes at
a school belonging to the London
e school board.
SIn the course of his opening address
he gravely asked the children, "Which
was the largest island in the world be
r for Australia was discovered?"
When the youngsters gave it up, he
said in the same grave way, which
made them laugh all the more, "Why.
Australia, of course; it was there all
the time!"
