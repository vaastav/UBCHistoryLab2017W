Many other "my policies" were ig-
red In the Taft message, but are not
mentioned by the Rooseveltlans now
because of the opportunity the presl

Ji the messages that are still to come.
Jl Under this head come such subjects
as a better anti-trust law, effective

Eleven per cent is the amount of in
crease in the cost of living during the
last year. This figure represents th«
average increase in cost
commodities.
Marked advances in the last year
have taken place in breadstuffs, pro
visions, livestock, hides and* leather
and textiles. One of the noticeable
effects of increased cost of living has
been the forced demand of labor for
higher wages. Wages, however, have
not advanced In proportion to,the cost
of living. The natural conclusion, and
the only conclusion to be reached la
that the workingmen and their fam
ilies have been forced to a trifle lower
standard of living.
Dealing with wholesale prices, Brad

average price for ninety-six commodi
ties stood at 9.1262 against 8.2133 on
the same date last year. Here Is a

The Increases above dealt with re

what a 11 per cent increase in the
cost of living during the last year

that the cost of living In- 1907 aver
aged 47!4 per cent more than in 1897.

than this was. The pleasing effect
upon the ear Was but little diminished
on learning by what animal it was
produced. The vocalist was a frog
and soon another, from a more dis
tant-spot took up the strain, and the
two sang together, now in solos, now
In chorus.
"Curious to see this musical frog,
I took a torch from the fire and went
to look for "him. I arrived at the
spot whence the sound was proceed
ing, but as I stopped to search the
grass the music seemed to float away
ih pother place some yards distant
"I followed, and still the sound
moved, and nowhere could I discover
whence It came,, I searched for near
ly.a quarter of an hour, without being
able to fix tjie spot, /and then I gave
tip -in despair.
"T!i6 {Act is, this frog is recognised
tp be a, ventriloquist of no common
order.have many a time since
heard him crying ,ln broad daylight,
and the power of ventriloquism is no
doubt given, him as. a protection,
against tbe numerous cranes and other
frog ^nejmies that would otherwise be
giiided by the sound and soon render
the sncicles extinct."
