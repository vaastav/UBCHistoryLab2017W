PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Is In Line With Republican Theories
of the Lae Campaign.
President McKinley's annual mes
sage was submitted to Congress
last Monday. It proved to be about,
the kind of a document outlined in
THE UNION of last week.
The message opens with congratu
lations on the "evidence on every
hand of individual and national
prosDerity" and the increasing
power for good of republican insti
tutions. It declares that the re
public was never so strong, because
so strongly intrenched in the hearts
of the people, as now.
The Chinese question is the first
point taken up. The Boxer trouble
is reviewed, the action of the Ameri
can government made plain, losses
during the outbreak are re-counted
and the question of suitable indem
nity is taken up and discussed, but
there is an absence of a demand for
Chinese territory in payment of any
indemnity.
The message endorses a restric
tion of the liquor traffic in unciviliz
ed countries, "especially those of
the western Pacific," touches on our
relation to the Central and South
American republics and recommends
improved trade relations with Bra
zil. Our relations with Great Brit
iah and Germany are declared to be
amicable, though a restoration of
our meat trade with the latter na
tion is much to be desired.
The construction of the Nicarau
guan canal is urged and a conven
tion with Great Britian is advocated
to get rid of possible difficulties
which may come from a resurrection
of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty.
Then the president takes up the
Philippine question, mention is
made of "where our flag rightfully
floats" and the declaration is made
that the military arm of the govern
ment has been employed there
through necessity. However, "pro
gress in the hoped-for direction has
been favorable." He then declares
that our forces have successfully
controlled the greater part of the
islands, overcoming organized for
ces of the insurgents and carrying
order and administrative regularity
to all quarters. What opposition re
mains is for the most pari scatter
ed, obeying no concerted plan of stra
tegic action, operating only by the
methods common tothetra .itions of
guerrilla warfare, which, while in
effective to alter the general control
now established, are still sufficient
td beget insecurity among the pop
ulations that bave felt the good re
sults of our control and thus delny
the conferment on them of the fuller
measures of local self-government,
of education and of industrial and ag
ricultural development which we
stand ready to give them. On the
question of civil government in the
Philippines.the president declares
that "it will be necessary to fill
some offices for the present with
Americans, which, after a time, may
well be filled by natives of the island.
As soon as practicable a system for
ascertaining the merit and fitness of
candidates for civil office should be
put in force. An indispensable qual
ification for all offices and positions
•of trust and authority in the ilands
must be absolute and unhampered,
authority and power to remove and
Jxinish any officer deviating from
that standard must at all times be
retained in the hands the central
authority of the islands.
•Safe* '1° reference to the financial and
banking law enacted last March
the president declares that "the
beneficial effect of the act is already
apparent. Ths provisions for the
incorporation of national bauks
with a capital of not lest than $25,
400 in places not exceeding 3,000 in
habitants, has resulted In the ex
tension of banking facilitier to many
small communities hitherto unable
to provide themselves with banking
institutions under the national sys
tem. 'There were orgonized from
%he enactment of the law. up to and
including November 30, 369 national
banks, of whitb 266 were with capi
tal less. than 950,000, and 103 with
c$pitaf'of $50,000 or more.
?,j€:£ifore.
He further notes that a large in-
•--V'crease
in national bank notecircula
Ippllon has resulted from the provision
of.the act, wjiich permits national
banks to issue circulating notes to
the par value of the United State*
bonds deposited as security, instead
90 p*r sent thereof, as hereto
The increase in circulating
notes fromMarcb 14 to Novembei

Jw'fcfrtiie varying needs
wWMMM
of business at all seasons and in
sections.
He recommends the construction
of a cable between the America and
Hawaii, with an extension to Ma
nila.
On the question of increasing the
standing army President McKinley
reviews our present demand for
troops and cites that we have in
Cuba between 5,000 and 6,000 sol
diers. For the present our troops
in that island cannot be entirely
withdrawn or materially diminish
ed. In Porto Rico, he says, we
have reduced the garrisons to 1,328,
which includes 28 native troops.
We will, adds the president, be re
quired to keep a considerable force
in the Philippines for some time to
come. From the best information
obtainable, he continues, we will
need there for the immediate fu
ture from 45,000 to 60,000 men.
It must be apparent, concludes
the chief executive, that we will re
quire an army of about 60,000 men
aud that during present conditions
in Cuba and the Philippines the
president should have authority to
100,000. Included in this number
the president asks that authority
be given to raise native troops in
the Philippines up to 15,000, which
the Tuft commission believes will
be more effective in dotecting and
suppressing guerillas, assassins
and Ladroaes than our own sol
diers.
The president advocates restrain
ing legislation for "such combina
tions or trusts as are harmful," en
dorses the Hanna ship subsidy bill
'for the encouragement of Ameri
can shipping," and closes with a
plea for economy in appropriations
and public expenditures.
Quarterly Meeting.

conference year will be held at the M.

August Flower.
"It is a surprising fact," says Prot.
Huuton, "that in all my travels in all
parts of the world in the last ten years

medicine for dyspepsia, deranged liver
atd stomach and for constipation. 1

Belt's Gold Trust
Mr. Alfred Belt of London and
South Africa, whose ambition it is
to become the richest man in the
world, is justified in his argument
that, since the the world's diainond
output has been monopolized under
syndicate control, the gold output
may be manipulated in similar man
ner.
It is but natural, therefore, that
a man of belt's daring, energy and
•ast financial aspirations should be
planning to effeot a combination
which shall virtually amount to a
Gold Trust.
Provided that he marshals suffi
cient capital behind him in the move
ment, the thing is simple. It mere
ly a question of buying up the gold
producing mines in all quarters of
the globe and of placing his syndi
cate representatives in control of
the properties.
The cable story from London
which tells of this gigantid scheme
being now put under way by the
Anglo-African multlnilllonaire is
right in declaring that its successful
culmination would place all the great
Powers of the world at the mercy of'
Belts colossal Gold Trust. About
the only Government secure against
such a combinatior is Russia, which
itself owns and operates the Russian
gold mines as state property. The
remaining Powers would apparently
be helpless agaiust the Titanic
combine.
This would mean that Belt and his
associates would control the money
supply of the world. It brings to
the front the concrete materialisa
tion of the monopolistic combine as
the master of Governments. Just
what would follow the full develop
ment of this condition it is not easy
to foretell. The gold magnates
would be more powerful than kings
or presidents or other accepted rul
ers. The Gold Trust would be a
supreme autooracy. Its govern
ment would be the government of
men by the dollar. Are the fruits
of clvilzation to be found in such
government?

Death of Patrick McDonough,
Few deaths have called forth mo^e
expression of sorrow and sincere re
gret than that of "Patsy" Mc
Donough. He died from a stroke of
appoplexy at about 9:30 Saturday
morning. He had been feeling
somewhat indisposed for about two
day a and on Friday night he request
ed that someone remain all night
with him at his room. The request
was granted. Mr. McDonough grew
worse during the night and death
came to his relief at the hour given
above. It is thought that a blood
vessel was broken a day or so before,
but the olot had not attained suffi
cient size to produce appoplexy
soon erT
The deceased was born in Clinton,
Iowa, and at the time of his death
was in his thirty-eighth year. He
leaves a father, mother, two sisters
and three brothers at bis old home,
besides one sister residing in
Chicago. He first visited Rapid
City in 1888, remaining here until
1890. In 1395 he returned and has
since been a member of the firm of
Herron & McDonough, cigar manu
facturers. Few men had a kindlier
disposition than he, and none were
more ready to help an unfortunate
brother. He was a quiet and un
assuming man, attentive to his own
affairs and an expert at his chosen
trade. In the order of Modern
Woodmen he was one of the most
active workers and in the future
work of that order he will be sadly
missed.
Brief, but impressive services
were conducted at the hall of the
order at three o'clock Sunday after
noon and the remains were shipped
to the old home of the deceased at
Clinton, Iowa, Sunday evening for
interment. The sad occurrence is
deeply mourned by all and removes
a familiar figure from our midst.
BOLD TRUST'SEEKS MINES.
Colorado Prooertles Being Eagerly

Colorado Springs, Col., Dec. 1.—
Werener, Beit & Co., wbivb includes
Alfred Beit, South Africa's diamond
king H. W. Robinson, the Mineral
Assets Company and Stratum's In
dependence,. Limited, all of London,
are represented here by agents em
powered to buy Colorado's big gold
mines on a satisfactory test. The
companies are probably one, though
acting independently here. They
are believed to compose the great
gold trust that seeks to control the
world'd gold production. They will
visit Colorado, Utah, California,
Oregon and will buy only the devel
oped mines. The Hidden Treasure
and the Mercury mine, the latter at
$4,500,000, are under bond. The
Camp Bird at Ouray, ths Portland,
Gold Coin, Elkton, Free Coinage
and other mines at Cripple Creek
are wanted.
The total value of fheie mines
may reach 160,000,000. Cripc
Creek mines are proving hardest!
buy, the Gold Coin having refusi
$15,040,000, and the Portland as
iog 1,000,000.

JUDGE MOORE NOT A DESERTER.
His
Stands as True to Bryan and
Principles as liver.
It seems that when the Lead Call
joined the deserters and went over
to the republicans the report was
circulated and accepted as true by
many that Judge Joseph B. Moore
had followed the Call or was about
to do sc. In justice to Judge Moore
THE UNION desires to brand there
port as absolutely false in every
particular. .Our authority for this
emphatic denial is contained in a
letter received from the judge a few
days ago in which he says:
"I stand just where I have always
stood, a member of the People,s
Party, or Bryan democrat. I be
lieve McKinley's foreign policy will
bring imperialism, militarism and
pauper labor. We went to an over
whelming defeat, fighting for prin
ciple and a just cause. I am prouder
to have the honor of going to defeat
in such a cause under the leadership
of Mr. Bryan than I would been to
be elected to congress upon any
other platform. Unless some great
change comes, we who are opposed
to McKinley republicanism will re
nominate and elect Mr. Bryan to the
office of president of the United
States.
"Grover Cleveland and his coterie
of gold democrats cannot "reorgan
ize" 7,000,000 reformers and depose
Mr. Bryan from his leadership.
These would-be reorganisers must
first reorganize themselves into
DEHOCBATS. Mr. Bryan is the great
est living American and represents
all that is pure and good in Ameri
can politics.

charge of grand larceny and was
given two years iu the state peni
tentiary in which to ponder over
his misdeeds and form a resolve to
do better when he got out.
The case of Henry Summers was
again taken up. His attorney stat
ed that although the defendant was
not guilty as charged in the indict
ment, yet ii view of his inability to
secure bonds he would plead guilty
rather than remain in the county
ail indefinitely. Judge McGee took
into consideration the youth of the
accused lad, who is only fifteen years
of age, and made the sentence light
as possible, giving biin one year in
the penitentiary.
On Monday the case of Twombly
vs. Christy was taken up and on the
failure of the defendant to appear a
judgment was rendered in favor of
the plaintiff.
The court then took a recess until
December 14, one juror, A. C.
Boland, being retained as talesman.

When your optics fall on the post

looks just like Jim proposed to hold

Well, THE UNION is willing and the

Gov. Andrew E. Lee of Vermillion
and Uol. Arthur Linn of the Soldiers

most pleasant call last Friday.
The doughty little governor takes
the result of the late election very
philosophically and seems not a bit
discouraged. He has no shady spots
in his two terms as governor, no eX'
cuses or apologies to make and noth
ing to regret so far as his official
acts are concerned. Gov. Lee leaves
a mighty clean record behind him
Col. Linn was not particularly
wrought up over the prosject of los

On the contrary he expressed his
