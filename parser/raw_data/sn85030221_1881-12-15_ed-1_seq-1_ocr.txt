in this decidedly satirical reflection:

. Tbe preaident's message Is commended
on all bands for lis soasible and digni
fied, tone, an4 the views which It ex
presses on all important questions of
public policy .are evidently those of a
man well versed in the jreoeral affairs of
the country, and who la therefore com
petent to Indicate the course 'of legisla
tion best calculated to promote the gen
eral interest of the nation.- Th recom
mendations madu by the president to
congress are of inch a character a to
warrant the careful ami 'favorable con
sideration of that body at the earliest
practicable moment, arid we , earnestly
trust thai the present session will see
the luauguration of many ot the reforms
suggested. It-.
Mr. Sidney Clarke, In an Interview
with the reporter of the J,ee ven worth
Standard, expresses the belief that there
will have to be an extra seion of the
legislature to apportion the state for
congressmen, unless congress should
otherwise provide. The last legislature
failed to make an apportionment be
cause it was believed it could not be
done until congress took action. The
tat was in exactly tbe same condition
on this matter ten years ago, when the
number ol members was increased from
one to three, it is now. The additional
members were elected at large and we
believe they can be aain. At least we
should oppose an extra session of the
legislature for this purpose.
Senator Jones, of Nevada, says that
tbe south does not desire any legislation
of a general nature.' The south, tiesays,
Is more prosperous thau at any time in
its history. It bas entirely recovered
from the effect of the civil war. The
people to-day are industrious, saving
and contintedv Senator Jones will
strongly urge the construction of a ship
canal across the Isthmus of Florida.
Tbe canal, he says, will save to the pro
ducers of tbe west and south over eight
hundred miles of water transportation.
.The canal, according to government es
timates, will cost about .$300,000,000.
But this cost, he maintains, will soon be
covered by decreased rates of transport

; To the "literature of cranks" may be
added some curious statistics recently

reports or Gulteau's trial continue to be
received dally by the London papers,
and "seem likely to discredit perma
nently American courts with the Eng
lish public." The Times remarks that
the. trial astonished and shocks English
readers. Lawyers declare that no such
spectacle of judicial incapacity has ever
been seen. The constantly-recurring
scenes, the difgrsctfut license allowed
Guiteau, the hilarious demeanor of the
spectators, the applause bestowed on
Hcoville, tbe indecent demonstrations of
every kind tolerated by the judge and
hie tatter inability to keep order or con
trol tbs) proceeding of his own court,
are all. unhappily, regarded here
typical instead of exceptional. The
lawyers, moreover, consider tbe exam
ination of Guiteau touching his own
Insanity aa a scandalous innovation.
POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.
v It seems likely there will be a revival
of tbe discussion of the question of pos
tal savings banks, which occupied so
much attention two or three years ago,
the postmaster general having opened up

surprising tbat congress bas not author

Our government is a borrower, and
should continue in that position for an
Indefinite time, seeing that it can bor

It would certainly be bad policy to take
money from the people which is worth

to pay off the debt of the people which
only costs them for Interest tbree and
half per cent. But If the government is
a borrower at all. it should make arrange

JOHN W. FORNEY.
This gentleman, whose death was an
nounced in our dispatches last night,
bad been prominent in political matters
for thirty years. He was born in Lan
caster, Pennsylvania, September 30, 1817,
and was therefore past 64 years old.
In 1833 be entered the office of tbe Lan
caster Journal as an apprentice at the
printing business, and in 1837, became
tbe Joint proprietor and editor of the
Lancaster Intelligencer. In 1845 be
went to Philadelphia, where he was long
the editor of the Pennsylvania, one of
the most decided Democratic journals
or the time. In 1831 and again in 1853
he was chosen clerk of tbe house of rep
resentatives at Washington. lie then
became editor of the Union, the Demo
cratic organ at Washington. lie re.
signed this position m 1858. retimed to
Philadelphia and was chosen chairman
of the Democratic stale committee. In
Jjiiuary, 1857, be was a candidate for
senator but was defeated by Simon Cam
eron. The same year, August Jst, he Is
sued the first number of the Philadel
phia Press, an independent Democratic
Journal. It was during bis connection
with this Journal tbat he achieved bU
principal fame. ' He became an able and
influential leader in 'his, party.
He advocated ' the election of
James Buchanan as presee( and per
haps dM more than any other man to
secure hie nomination, but notwithstand
ing this tbe Press became an able and
determined opponent of Buchanan's ad.
ministration when it sought. to fasten
slavery upon Kansas. . The paper be
came an outspoken champion for free
dom In Kansas, and vigorously opposed
tbe Lecompton constitution, lie ever
remained a true and devoted friend of
Kansas. In consequence of his position
as an opponent of the Democratic party,
he was elected again as clerk of tbe
house of representatives in tbe SCih con
gress by the Republicans. Tbe civil
war coming on, he gave a constant sup
port to the national government. In
1801 be established, in addition to the
Press, a weekly paper in Washington
called the Chronicle. It became a daily
in October, 1802. lie was secretary of
tbe U. S. senate from 1861, to 1868, and
the latter year was a delegate to the Na
tional Republican convention which
first nominated Gen. Grant. In 1807 he
went to Europe and from there wrote an
interesting series of sketches which
were published in bis paper. lie also
wrote "Anecdotes of Public Men." pub.
lished originally in his two papers,
"both daily," and , afterwards
published in book form. Some years ago
be sold the Press at a big figure and re
tired from it entirely. , II is next paper
venture wa 'The Progress" which .was
started in Philadelphia over , four
years ago. It was devoted principally
to literature and historical and personal
matters, and was handsomely printed.
He paid some attention, also, to politi
cal affairs. lie was an advocate last
year of General Grant for president, Uv
lieving his election would do more to
restore unity between the north and
south than -Uie election of any other Re
publican i candidate. : After : the. two
parties bad placed their candidates in
the field Mr. Forney decided in favor of
the Democratic nominee, and opposed
General Garfield with much bitterness.
But the great influence which ha once
had wielded was gone, and bis follow
ing waa small. lie indulged in tbe
most glooruy forebodings in tbe event of
the success of the Republican nominee,
and was uanutrcifully ridiculed by tbe
Republican press, aud rapidly lost caste
among his political friends and
associate. VHe had ; evidently become
Bound and disappointed. .
When t he-old settlers ot Kansas had
their quarter-centennial celebration at
Bismasck in 1870. Mr. Forney was in
vited to participate on account of the
prominent part he had taken in their ear
ly struggles for freedom, and came out
and delivered the Principal addiess.
Ills visit was almost an ovation, the peo
ple gathering from every quarter of the
state to welcome their old friend. His
address was full of good words for Kan
sas, and vas widely published in
the papers. All will retrret his un
timely death.
MAKING IT HOT.
In another column will be found a
special Topeka telegram to the Chicago
Times, which will, wo have no doubt.
prove ratUsT interesting reading matter,
especially to radical prohibitionists and
their opponents. It professes to srive
the substance of a proclamation by
Governor St. John, to bo promulgated
to-morrow In relation to the enforcement
of the prohibition law. He proposes to
make it hot for the violators of the law.
We have no doubt of the correctness of
what the special relates, as we were told
yesterday by a prominent Topeka gen
tleman the proclamation was to be is-
sued In a day or two. This is a very de
cided step In the aggressive. It will no
doubt be sustained by a large propor
tion of the temperance people, but
whether it will enlist a sufficient follow
ing to make it effective, is a matter to be
tested. - Where the money is to come
from to pay the large rewards which it
is proposed to offer, we do
not know, as the governor bas
no fund at bia disposal by legislative
appropriation for such a psrpose. We
are emphatically of the opinion that so
long aa the law remains upon tbe stat
ute book it should be enforced, and have
no sympathy with those who are i
tempting to trample it under foot. They
are certainly in the wrong, and ought
not to be encouraged in their course. If
the law is a bad one there is a rightful
and peaceable way to dispose of it. But
it is a fact that no law can be rigidly en
forced unless backed by the support of
the people, and there is no doubt but
tbat in the communities where the spec
ial says the proclamation will be made
to apply, to-wlt : Topeka, Leavenworth,
Atchison, Wyandotte, Kansas City, Kan
sas, and Dodge City, the public sentiment
Is opposed to the enforcement of the law,
Then the question presents itself, how
Is the proclamation to be enforced t If
the people will not assist in its enforce
ment there seems to us but one answer.
It must be done by the use of force.
That will be the logic of the situation.
I the governor, and are the people
ready for this? If they are not,"
we apprehend Is - the case, all
preferring the settlement of the question
by the ballot, then it seems to as the
proclamation will be indiscreet to say
the least. This question must be set
tied. We bave often said there is as
irrepressible conflict between the two
principles, temperance and intemper
ance, and one must prevail and the
other die. If the issue must enter our
elections all right, though we are not in
favor of making temperance a party is
sue. But If it most corns to the point
of; deciding whether whisky, shall
run the country and ruin it,
or whether temperance shall have swsy,
it will not take as long to decide, party
or no party. But we fear, under all the
circumstances, that tbe proclamation
will have a bad effect at least it would
havs been the wiser policy, it strikes us.
to have waited until the people had i
other chance to add the weight of their
public verdict to what has been 'done.

KANSAS AT ATLANTA.
. Tbe Atlanta correspondent of the Cin
cinnati Gazette gives the following sc.
count of the Kansas display at the . great
Cotton Exposition: . -
"Visitors to tbe Philadelphia exhibi
tion will remember that Kansas carried
off many of tbe honors. Although the
present exposition is a southern enter
prise, the young giant of the west is
present through the Atchison, Topeka &
bant Fe railroad.- and bas been very
courteously entertained. It occupied a
pavilion conspicuously located in the
centsr of the annex, otherwise filled by
the southern roads. It haa carried tbe

Sheaves of wheat and long stalks of corn

arranged at every commanding point,
and beneath the w beaten roof rise piles
of rosy apples and golden ears of corn.
They are disposed with a perfection of art
which eeaeeah ir beneath simulated
carelessness. There is nothing stiff, or
apparently studied, bnt s master hand
has placed everything. A big map and
other documents stilt further enforce the
attractions ef the new west.". .
Tbe Washington correspondent of the
St. Louts Globe Democrat says:
The friends of Mrs. Garfield here re
ceive constant and cheering news from
jr Cleveland heme, assuring them of
her pleasant surroundings and the con
tinued goed health of her family. It
was expected that ex-Secretary, or Sena
tor, and Mrs. Windosa wonJd -aaak ham
a visit before the opening of congress,
but pressure ot business prevented, and
the matter has been paetpooed without
date. CoL Rockwell's family, it is said,
will spend the Christmas holidays at the
Euclid Avenue House. It would seem
to be a sad gathering without the head
of the family and tne leader of the
Cbrlstmas frolics in .the merry seasons
gone by, but tbe close intimacy of the
two families may make their presence a
consolation to Mrs. Garfield at that anni
versary time. The friendship between
tbe younger members of the two house
holds has been as, close as any tie of
kindred, and it is qaite as much for her
children as for herself that Mrs. Garfield
fills np the great chambers of her bouse

The passengers on a train on the

There were United States soldiers on the

sons equipped with pistols. No sooner
had the buffaloes been discovered, there
fore, than these marksmen began firing
at these peaceful beasts. Soon the
smoke from the weapons enveloped tbe
cars and hid the buffaloes from sight.
Firing then ceased. In a few moments
the smoke lifted, and all the animals
were seen to ben half smile sway,
peacefully eating grass. The train then
moved on, without, however, any buf

A commemorative silver plate bas
been placed upon the pew formerly oc
cupied by President Garfield in the

Mrs. Garfield has been elected the first
honorary member of the New Shaks-
peare society, of London, "as a slight
tribute of admiration for the loving de
votion shown by her during the long

Prince Leopold, -duke of Albany, one of
the vice-presidents of the society, was
appointed to communicate the resolu
tion. A dispatch received by Secretary
Blaine from Baron Von Steuben says
the latter has called his sen, born a few
days ago, "Blaine Steuben." There
have been a good many wild rumors
afloat about Mr. Blaine retiring to pri
vate life, but a man may always be set
down as a political possibility as long
as people insist upon naming their ba
bies after him.
It is said that when Mr. Conkling
heard, at the dinner table, of the defeat
of Htscock, the Half-breed candidate
for speakership of the house from New
York, he read the dispatch with a placid
smile, and then sent it to friends in an
other part of the room. The statement
that My Lord Roscoe is out of politics,
is probably true in a Pickwickian sense.
It is stated on good authority that
Mrs. Scoville, the sister of the assassin,
received a letter from him some days
before the 2d of July, in which he in
formed her of his intention to murder
the president, and that she telegraphed
her husband to return to Chicago, which
he did, and heard of the assassination on
his arrival. Had she telegraphed to
Washington instead, the deed of blood
would have been averted.
President Arthur is both a good shot
and a good fisherman, and follows
President Hayes in that respect, who
hunted all over the Sandusky marshes
when a boy, and kept at it until he
reached the presidency. Mr. Hayes once
joined the cod and mackerel fleet to the
Newfoundland banks, and spent a sea
son in that tempestuous and dangerous
occupation. Washington was one of
the best sportsmen of his day, and
raced horses, like General Jackson, and
shot every description of bird and beast
in Virginia.
The Princess of the Piute Indians
ot Nevada, commonly called Sarah
Winnemucca, was married last Tuesday
night at the Ruas House, in San Fran

the United States army, who arrived
there from Arizona on November 3. Tbe
bridegroom informed a reporter that as
far back as 1879, during the Bannock
campaign, he first met the Princess and
was smitten with her charms. Since
then a mutual feeling has inspired them
and, an opportunity presenting itself,
they resolved never to be separated
again. Dr. Beers was the officiating
minister. Princess Winnemucca and Mr.
Hopkins will take their departure for the
east at an early date. The princess is well
known on the Pacific coast. She has
lived mainly in Carson, Nevada, with
her father, the old Chief Winnemucca,

bright girl, has had a good English ed
ucation, and looks more like a Mexican
girl than an Indian. She has regular
feature and dresses Curly. She is a
great advocate of education nd has
lectured In San Francisco and other cit
ies on the wrongs of her tribe.
PRESS COMMENTS OH THE MESSAGE.
- The New York press eomments as
follows upon President Arthur's mes
sage: .
The Times, in two columns, approves
all but the part referring to the star
route frauds, it says: ine rresiueni
makes a somewhat gingerly allusion to
the star route frauds. It might have
been worth while to point out that the
great reductions which have recently
been made in the expense of tbe star
route service, can only be justified on
tbe theory that the system which ren
dered these reductions necessary was
both extravagant and corrupt."
- The Herald in a column and a half,
says the message of President Arthur is
admirably written, calm and- dignified
in style and tone, and advises congress
as it is Ms constitutional duty to do, on
many important subjects, with a wisdom
and sound judgment which win for him
the public's confidence, and for his
recommendation the attentive consider
ation of both houses.
The Tribune says : "The message is
the strongest on foreign relations and
finance, but it is not weak anywhere,
and it will be generally accepted by the
country as a judicious mandate, and in
most respects a satisfactory document.
On tbe civil service question it shows a
disposition to submit as little as possible
the program of. civil service re
former. The Sun says: "The message is s
well written, business like document,
marked by the characteristics that be
long to Gen. Arthur himself. It is free,
from novelties and surprises, bit is full
of facts and suggestions."
The World says: "the only possible
criticism of this proposal to do away
witb some ot tne internal revenue taxes
is that it does not go far enough. It is
a business like paper, full on views,
bristling with points, sound of all Amer
ican questions, and will receive the
united support of Democrats in congress
on all foreign affairs."
Tbe Truth says: "The message speaks
too well tor itself to need any editorial
comment."
The 8 tar says : "Tbe first message
from President Arthur will be a great
disappointment to tbe country, which
has expected so much and will receive
In this message so little of practical
value or interest."
Of evening papers the Graphic says:
"It is a magnificent production; the
phraseology is perfect; no vain repeti
tion ; sentences are clear, cogent and con
cise; the production of a scholar, states
man, man of affairs and a patriot. The
message is full ot subjects worthy of
thought and discussion."
The Post says: "The message is, on
the whole, a very creditable paper. The
president has contrived to say some
thing of value on a great many topics,
and dismisses others without expressing
an opinion on them, but also without a
great waste of words."
The Philadelphia Ledger has this to
say of the class of ladies who attend the
trial oi Guiteau :
"We would be very sorry to aid in
anv way in ha vine these 'ladies' consid.
ered as representative of the society of
Washington, or even ot tne 'lasniona
bles,' for all who know the permanent
population of the federal capital are
aware that there are innumerable home
circles there which make up a gentle
and refined society worthy of the name.
But the frivolous 'ladies' who make such
display of their rude manners and worse
tastes, bolong to the showy and shallow
kind, pretentious and obtusive, whose
sole aim is to excite the envy and rival
ry of 'ladies' as shallow as themselves.
Their chief occupation is to exhibit
costly clothes and other kinds of ve
neering. They do, unfortunately, repre
sent one kind of 'style' in Washington,
beset, as that city is, witn star route'
and other contractors, lobbyists and ad
venturers; but it would be a great mis
take and wrong to that city to consider
them as representative of its home so
ciety, or of any others than themselves.
Judge Cox appears to have attracted full
delegations of these to the disgraceful
exhibition permitted in his court for the
last fortnight, but there wag a very
small representation of the true woman
hood of Washington among the 'fash
ionable ladies.' "
Tbe Kansas farmer gets in some good
suggeMioas, as follows: "If you are a
farmer, do not overwork your children,
and thus, by a hard, dreary life, drive
them off to the cities. Arise at a rea
sonable hour in the morning, take an
hour's rest after meals, and.quit at five
or six o'clock in the afternoon. Let the
young people, in games and other amuse.
ments, have a happy time during the.re
mainder of the day- There is no reason
why a farmer's family should be de
prived of recreation and amusement any
more than others."
THE
BOY WHO WAS HOT
TIVE."
"SENSISI-
BY ANNETTE L. NOBLE.
Two boys, almost young men, were
standing before a closed shop-door in
earnest debate. It was. a half-holiday,
and JNea urey was teasing Morris bark
er to go with him on a barge up the
river to tne nremen's picnic.
"No, Ned ; there are. as you say, some
grand fellows going, but you know we
can't keep away from Tom Allen's set;
he won't let us; and they all drink."
"You need not care lor that; you
boast that you ain't afraid to say 'No !'
"1 don't mean to boast about it; but it
is true I can say 'No' to au invitation to
drink any hour of the day or the night."
"Well, you aren't sensitive, ana l am.
I can't bear to set myselt up for some
body with extra-fine notions and so seem
to cast reflections on other people;
and it hurts me to be made fun of
and sneered at. You never seem to feel
tbat; some folks never are sensitive. It
is good ; I wish I had been made that
way," sad Ned.
Morris colored; he considered him
self, and with reason, a boy of quite as
much fine ieeling as was Ned, who
many times had spoken in this way.
"Perhaps you would not think some
things worth feeling now if you had
felt more in the past if you hod felt
half what I have."
"Tell us your life, Methuselah," said
Ned, with a careless laugh.
"Sit down a minute, then, on that box,
and I will," said Morris; and Ned sat
down.
"I was born in G , fifty miles
from here. My father was an educated
gentleman in the fullest sense of both
words. He was a lawyer. But he
drank. For years he managed to con
ceal it from everybody but mother. She
did everything for him a woman could
do, but if she had not had a small prop
erty secured to her in a way he could
not appropriate she would have come to
want. By the time I was nine years
old I realized that father earned little or
nothing and that mother spent hours
crying alone in her room. I had the
loveliest little sister Bess you ever could
imagine. I never saw any picture half
so pretty. She had long, floating yel
low hair and the strangest blue eyes,
with long, jet-black lashes. Father was
very proud of her, and always kind to
us both ; but then we had never seen
him drunk. When he came home
intoxicated mother must always
have got us out of the way.
Well, one day she had gone away
from home, and father returned at a
very unusual hour. He was going on
business to L , a large city near
our town. Be3S and I teased to go, and
he took us along just as we were Bess
with her little straw bat stuck full of
flowers, I remember, and her pretty
hands all strawberry stains. We got to
L early in the day and father at
tended to his business. We followed
him up and down long stairs until we
were tired and hungry, for it was a hot
June day. About noon, Bess said she
wanted something cool to eat some ice
frozen pudding; she meant ice-cream-Father
discovered then that he had only
a little money in his pocket. He had
come off on in haste, and our tickets had
taken hia extra change; but he had
enough for a cheap lunch for us all, he
said. He looked about and saw a saloon
and took us in. It waa cool and neat
Just like all those places; they make me
deathly sick when I glance in even now.
They were just out of ice-cream, tbe
waiter aaid, but bad sent for some.
Wouldn't we wait a minute He asked
father to have a drink of something.
From the little I knew 1 was alarmed,
and little Bess, too, was quick enough
to begin begging him away. 'Papa, papa,
do let us go on; by the other corner I
saw such a nice cake, and I am very
hungry; we dont want the cream so
much as cake and meat, papa.
"It wasn't any use; he had found a
man he knew standing at the bar, and
they drank together, and father forgot
he hadnt much money snd paid for all
they drank. . They talked and laughed.
and at last tried a new drink the bar-
keeper joked them about. Bess began
to cry, and father remembered, perhaps,
that he had nothing to pay for anything
more, and in shame hurried us off. He
said he was 'so sorry, and if 'poor little
sister was very hungry' be would pawn
something. She said, 'No, no, papa;
let ns go right home!
"She looked all white around her lips,
and it was very hot; but we both were
airald to be left with father, and longed
to get him home. He had begun to talk
not roar and laugh before be leit
the saloon. Soon he staggered and
mumbled and pulled uf here and there,
or half tumbled over us. People began
to stare and whisper, boys jeered and
yelled, "Hi ! hi t Old Tipsy !' I tell you
for two high spirited children it was
pretty hard. We felt it. Bess was like
a little woman. She said : 'We must got
him right to the station, and he may
wait there until the train comes. In
the depot we can sit each side of him
and bold him up straight.' She looked
like a little broken white lily in the
blazing sun as she said it. A
policeman insisted upon arresting
him, but when we pleaded with
him he was very kind and
went to the corner near the depot
with us. We got there at last, and fath
er went to sleep. Bessie kept getting
dizzy, and said the benches and the stove
were swimming in the air. There was
a refreshment table in tbe room with
great sugar-sprinkled buns and cool
milk for sale. It seemed as if we must
have some, but when Bess put her little
stained bands in father's pockets she
coMd not find one penny; the bar-tender
had the last. I make more of this be.
cause I can't bear to tell the Well, two
or tbree trains came in at once. We
waked father up to go and see which
was ours for G . He could not think
at first and staggered about ; then he got
into a great hurry, and tried to be very
smart and appear to know just where
we were to go.. He was half ashamed
and half crazy. Litte Bess thought he
knew where to go when he got out by the
tracks. A man pushed me one way.
Father must have started and sent her
ahead another An engine started, a train
backed ; I heard people groan, and oth
othcrs cry. 'Where? 'Who? I
rushed with the rest and I saw O Ned 1
You think I haven't any sensitiveness!
Was it just the cruel great iron wheels
that had crushed my beautiful little sis
ter's body into a mass of blood and
broken bones? Wasn't it the brandy in
my father's brain tbat sent her little
feet straight under that backing train ?
And you wonder I can stand being
sneered at when 1 say I hate it!
I did not know what it meant until a
brakeman picked up a little straw bat
with a wilted pink rose in it; then I
don't remember how we ever got home
or who told my mother. Poor mother!
Who left Bessie happy as a queen in the
quiet garden at home.
"That was not the end of trouble,
either ; but it was the end of my father
He drank drank, drank, drank. Itdid
not kill him, but it made him almost id
iotic. A year after he was put in a ward
in a lunatic asvlum. For three years I
went witb my mother once a week to
see him. people used to ask ber why
she took me, and she said : "That my
boy may learn to hate his father's mur
derer. In old times some of a murder
ed man's family vowed to slay the mur
derer. I want Morris to give hi life to
nunting down tne devil ot intemper
ance.' "We took that poor silly creature sit
ting mumbling to himself, grinning or
crying trom one day's end to another,
cakes, fruit, anything he asked for.
Sometimes he would say: 'Give Bessie
some. Bissie likes coke.' And this is
the reason, Ned, I am not afraid to say
"No.' But ifsfa no reason why I should
not feel some thinirs." -
Ned's eyes were full of tears. He got
off the box and grasping Morris s hand
said : "I will stick to you hereafter, and
you stick to me. I don't go off to any
drinking spree tnis nay." .

The Oultesa Case- Mrs. Wilson. Cons In
or the Assassin, on the Stand.
Washington, Dec. 8. As soon as the
criminal court opened this morning
Guiteau shouted out: "A crank in Chi
cago says I talked with him about this
case. I don't know tbe man. It is false."
Col. Corkhill called as the first witness
of the day Mrs. Julia M. Wilson, of
Leadville, Colorado. She knew L. W.
Guiteau from her earliest recollection.
He was ber uncle. The witness gave a
most- feeling account - ef tbe lite and
character of her mother, Mrs. Maynard,
who, it has been alleged by the defense,
bad died insane, but who really died of
pneumonia in ISoll. Her
mother wos4
noted for her lovely disposition and
Christian character and her
virtues are remembered and
spoken of to this day. The witness was
her nurse and constant, attendant up to
her death, - and never saw the slightest
indication of flightiness or insauity.
The witness was questioned in relation
to the evidence of Davis, one of the
witnesses for the defense. Davis testi
fied tbat be was at one time in Mrs.
Maynard's room during her last illness,
and she wss very flighty and incoherent,
and continually charged him (Davis) to
look out for her husband and children,
for sue feared they would go to the poor
nouse. liie witness curs. Wilson)
smiled incredulously wuiie tne question
was being put, and replied she did not
even remember the man Davis.
ine deposition ot Mr. Turner was
read in which be stated : "I bave beard
her husband say she died insane and the
witness was questioned in regard to it.
tscoviiie objected to the reply
never beard of it," and a lively discus
sion ensued between J udge Porter and
bcoville. Guiteau became enraged at
Judge Porter aud shouted: "Now
hold your thunder till you eet to the
jury, Judge. You are doing this sort of
wing too mucn."
Judge Porter, without noticing this
outburst, continued in a most impres
sive manner to argue his poiut when
uuiteau broke in again :
''I'm not a criminal, and I won't be
convicted. I won't bave that word
You just hold your eloquence till you
get to tne jury."
Scoville expostulated with him, but
ne retorted in the most vicious manner
"Shut up and mind your own business.
I know what I am doing."
Witness was questioned in regard to
various members of the family and
stated decisively she never saw
any indications of insanity in any
of them. Speaking of L. W,
Guiteau, she said: "My uncle
Luther visited me frequently and J
loved him with a very tender affection
Our whole family were delighted with
bis lovely character and such a thing as
that be might in any dcirree be of un
sound mind never entered my head."
The witness was subjected to a close and
critical cross-examination- he was
asked if she entertained any prejudice
against having hereditary insanity al
leged in this defense and replied
"1 object to au unfair statement being
made upon that subject. Perhaps tor
the sake of my children I might dislike
to have it set up, but for myself facts
can make no difference." - Her evidence
In chief remained unshaken and her tes
timony produced a marked sensation
Tlie Gnlteau Trial Tha Prisoner Still
Impressible.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 9. The
criminal, court opened promptly at 10
o'clock and Dr. Juo. McArthur again
took the stand.
Guiteau shouted out: "Your honor"
Scoville Keep still, please."
Ouitcau "Well, then, you state it at
once. If you don't I will."
Scoville then addressed the court and
objected to the character of the evidence
which was being given by witness, on
the ground that the evidence as to any
other crimes could not be introduced
when the prisoner is on trial for this
particular offense. He desired all such
evidence to be stricken out.
Quiteau here brj'ia in excitedly and
shouted out: "It Is purely in the nature
of a confession. McArthur is not on
expert or a lawyer, and I obiect to his
telling the jury aud tho American peo
ple facts which I told hiin years ago in
reeard to my history."
The court ruled that the evidence
could be admitted as tending to show
the ireneral character ot the prisoner.
Corkhill "Did you ever see anything
in the prisoner to indicate insanity?"
Answer "No, sir; I never did."
Uuiteau here broke out in one of his
noisy harangues, and despite the can
tion of the court and expostulations of
his couusel. proceeded to express
his opinion of Doctor McArthur
in terms not at all delicate
Turning to the reporter's table he pro
claimed for some minutes against the
scandalous reports of his character being
sent to the country; singling out the re
porter of the Washington Republican,
his shook his fist at him threateningly.
Corkhill desired the court to restrain
the prisoner, when Guiteau turned to
him and said, "You go slow, Corkhill.
You nre spotted, and as soon as this
business is over the president will re
move you."
Scoville cross-examined the witness
and became very angry and much ex
cited at some of his replies. The testi
mony in chief was not shsken.
W. S. Caldwell, physician, treated
L. W. Guiteau during his last illness.
He never detected any evidence of men
tal unsoundness.
Geo. W. Plummer called.
Guiteau immediately shouted, "i owe
this man $30 and it has cost the gov.
eminent $ 300 to get bim here. 1 think
the president's attention had better be
called to the way you are squandering
the government's money .Uorknin, so be
might bounce you at once. You'll cost
tbe government two or three hundred
thousand dollars at this rate."
Witness allowed prisoner to occupy a
desk in his law office at Chicago for
some months. He was in the collection
business and acted like any business
man.
Guiteau continually interrupe.. and
finally the witness said to him : "It
seems that your close relations to the
Deity of late have corrupted your man
ners." Worse and Worse
Washington, Dec 9. Plummer
further examined :
"Did you ever see anything in bis con
duct tbat indicated unsoundness of
mind " was tbe next question.
"No. sir," replied the witness, "noth
ing whatever. He seemed to be a man
of ability, vain and conceited ; but then
be had 'late from New York' on bis
card, and we expected the rest.
This convulsed the court.
Stephen English, editor and proprie
tor of tbe Insurance Times, New ork,
took the stand. Guitean called out.
"This man was in Ludlow street jail
and I got him out for $300," and gave
tbe circumstances under which he be
came acouainted with the prisoner.
Witness was in jail in $4,000 bonds
charged with libel. Tbe prisoner acted
as his attorney.
Guiteau frequently and noisily inter
rupted the wiaiess, calling him a liar
and perjurer. .At one time ne snouted;
"There ia not an insurance man in New
York that does not know what a fraud
you areu
Witness continued The prisoner bsd
swindled him out of $300 and bad
swindled many poor creature in jail by
Dromlsicz to help them and renin r
their money, and had never raised a fin
ger in their behalf.

Guiteau, excitedly "I want to know,
Mr. Corkhill, what all this kind of evi
dence has got to do with the real issue?
Who fired the shot that killed Garfield,
the Deity or I I. think it is devilish
mean to rake up my character in all 'its
details. Tbe only issue , here is, who
fired that shot, the Deity or I? Just
take that home, Corkhill, and think it
over. To-morrow morning I want to
know what all this has got to do with
the question of my sanity or insanity on
the 2d day of July. As I have told you
before, I had lime enough to go craz a
hundred times in the iuterval."
D. McLean Shaw testified that Gui
teau told him he was bound to have no
toriety someway or other. He might
kill some big man and imitate 'Wilkes

At this the prisoner became very vio
lent and abusive
Colonel Corkhill presented a commu-
mention trom frcsident Arthur in an-
swer to the interrogation of the defense,
The document was not read, but sub
mitted to Scoville for examination
John Farmer, of Saratoga Springs,
was the next witness.
Beiore he was examined the prisoner
said: "1 owe this man $10 tor board.
It cost the government $100 to bring
him here. I might haye admitted this
fact and spared this expense to the
nation."
The witness detailed the difficulty be
bad in collecting a board bill from the
prisoner.
In the meantime Guiteau had read
PRESIDENT ARTHUR'S ANSWERS TO SCO
YILLE'S QUESTIONS
and declared in an emphatic manner
that they should be published, and at
once. The document was then read by
Scoville,
The first question was, "Do you know
the prisoner in the case ? '
President Arthur answered in the
affirmative. He said he had seen him
ten or probably twenty times around the
Republican headquarters at the Fifth
Avenue hotel in New York, but bad had
no conversation with him except return
insr the ordinary salutations of the dav.
What political service did the prisoner
render the Republican party during the
last campaign ? was tbe next question.
Ans None that 1 know of, the presi
dent wrote in response, and I dou't know
that there was anything in relation to
myself. Gen. Grant or Senator Conkling
that would entitle him to believe ' he
would assist him in his political prefer
ment.
The prisoner That is a matter of
opinion.
Tbe president added, by way of post
script, tbat he had received a letter from
the prisoner asking for a postponement
of the trial in order to allow him time to
prepare hia defense.
Rev. R. S. McArthur, pastor of the
Baptist church of New York, testified
tbat the prisoner had brought a letter ol
admission to him from a Chicagocburch
Guiteau complained of poverty, result
ing from the Chicago fire, and the wit
ness heart went out toward hi in and be
loaned him $95. There was nothing in
tbe prisoner's manner to indicate iusan

wife represented to him that herself

witness men stated tn at tne prisoner
was brought up before the committee of
the church in regard to certain immoral
conduct. His wite claimed that she
supplied him with money which he
spent with other women. The prisoner
again became excited and stated that
his conduct in this regard was prompted
by his . desire to procure sufficient
grounds for divorce from the woman
whom be married on ten hour s notice.
CoL Corkhill said the government in
tended to show that what was claimed to
be insanity on tbe part of the prisoner
was notmnz but outrageous depravitv.

Kansas Prohibition.
Chicago, Dec. 8. A Topeka special
to the Times says that in an interview
with a correspondent of that paper this
morning on the success of prohibition.
Gov. Bt. John said that the measure
was a success; tbat tbe prohibitory law
was as rigidly enforced as any other law
on the statute books, among nine-tenths
of the people of that state. In tbe larger
cities, notably Leavenworth. Atchison
and Topeka, the law never had been en
forced, and more stringent measures are
required. The governor said there was
no objection to the law on the ground of
its Deing too stringent; on tbe
contiary, he would recommend such
modifications as make it more iron-clad
than now. In the meantime other
measures must be devised to procure
the enforcement of the prohibitory
measure. When asked what would be
the nature of the measures hinted at the
governor said he contemplated issuing
a proclamation about Sunday morning,
which as bo expressed it, would make it
hot for the violate rs of the law. That
such a course was contemplated has been
wnispered around the capitol, it is said,
for several days by enthusiastic, but

but no newspaper man before the Times
correspondent bas been granted a
glimpse of the document which is to be
the signal that war bas been declared
against the whisky men, and not only
against them, but against the officers
who fail to perform their duty under the
prohibitory act. The proclamation is a
very unpretending document, but every
paragraph is full of meat. After speci
fying tbe exact clauses to which tbe pa
per particularly refers it proceeds to say
tbat the governor as the cnief executive
of the state will pay a reward of $500
for tbe conviction of any distiler or
brewer in the state doing business
in violation of tbe law; $300 for tbe
closing as a nuisance of any brewery or
.distillery run in violation of the law ot
the state ; $100 for the conviction of any
saloon keeper or other person violating
the law of the state by retailing intoxi
cants; $100 for closing any saloon as a
nuisance; $300 for conviction of a coun
ty attorney, sheriff or city marshal for
failing to do their official duty in tbe en
forcement of the prohibitory law; $100
for the conviction of any policeman or
under-sheriff for like failure to discharge
his duty, and $200 for conviction of per
jury In cases that may grow out of the
prohibitory law.
THIS 'PROCLAMATION.
the governor said, would only be made
to apply to Topeka, Leavenworth, Atch
ison, Wyandotte Kansas City, Kas., and
Dodge City, in all of which the prohibi
tory law is openly and boldly defied.
With the observance of the law in other
parts of tbe slate he said he was well
satisfied.
The effect of this proclamation is al
ready discussed among those who are
tniormed ot its existence, it bas been
called out in response to the appeals of
prohibitionists throughout the state, but
it is reared that tbe eitect, if it has any at
all will be to wipe out all party lines
and divide the state, politically with
prouibitiomsts find anti-proiiibitiontsls.
It is almost sure to add bitterness and
heat to the contest between the ultra
temperance people and those opposed to
pronibitiou. -
