DEFENSE OF U.S.
CABINETMENACE
Differences of Opinion of Sec
retaries Proving Stum
bling Block.
RESIGNATIONS PREDICTED
Publication of Report of Secretary
Garrison Starts Speculation
on Outcome.
What effect the obvious differences be
tween Secretaries Garrison, Daniels and
Bryan on the question of national de
fense's will have, upon the personnel of
President Wilson's Cabinet is an Inter
esting subject for conjecture In Washing
ton at present, following the publication
of Secretary Garrison's annual report.
The relations of the three Cabinet of
ficers may be best understood by consider
ing Bryan on one side. Garrison on the
other, with Josephns Daniels in between.
Mr. Daniels is decidedly the most uncom
fortable of the three, and there are al
ready indications that he is realising that
fact.
Mr. Bryan Is the great apostle of the
movement against armaments, honest
ly believing that to be one of the main
roads to his ideal of universal peace.
His chief, and perhaps only satisfac
tion in his present position is the
thought that he can further the ad
vance toward this ideal by his ac
tions as Secretary of State.
Garrlaoa'a Long Stady.
Mr. Garrison, on the other hand. Is
the mental antithesis of Mr. Bryan, and
has no dreams which he Is seeking to
bring Into realization through his oc
cupancy of a Cabinet position, pos
sessed of a mind unusually keen. In
cisive, and clear, he has been accus
tomed by his long service on the
bench, to adduce the facta and base
his conclusions thereon.
Finding himself responsible for the
War Department and the army, he has
spent twenty months Investigating its
adequacy and needs, and his report,
published yesterday. Is the clear, crys
tallized result of such study. He rec
ognizes that the I'nited States army
is inadequate for the defense of the
country and recommends measures for
Improvement of the situation.
Mr. Daniels, on the other hand, la
neither the one nor the other. An en
thusiastic admirer of Mr. Bryan, and
a sincere lover of peace and all that the
Idea suggests, he has found himself
suddenly intrusted with responsibility
for the navy. The chief criticism made
against his administration by the serv
ice ha been that he has used the navy
as a laboratory in which to try out his
political notions and theories as to a
properly ordered social system. Navy
men feel atao that he is at heart not
at all in sympathy with the navy, that
he refuses to accept the fundamental
purposes for which navies are created
as the basis of his policy, but endeavors
Instead, to turn it to this and that sub
sidiary purpose.
Daniels la Divided.
Consequently, it is no surprise here
that Mr. Daniels, pressed on the on
side by his devotion to all Mr. Bryan
stands for. and on the other hv Ilie
naval service with all its facts and
theories so contrary to those Sir. Bryan
believes In. finds himself in a difficult
position, and in entire agreement with
neither one side nor the other.
Pn dictions that Bryan and Daniels are
to leave the Cabinet In the near future
are not much credited here. It is more
expected that Mr. Garrison will be the
one to retire if there are any Cabinet
changes as a result of this situation.
Mr. Garrison Is the type of man who
will withdraw from a position exactly
the moment he finds it incompatible with
his self-respect.
But. on the other hand, differences be
tween his views and those of Bryan anil
Daniels will not disturb Mr. Garrison In
the least, so Jong as he is assured his
official conduct Is satisfactory to the
President and his relations with his chief
are agreeable.
Mr. Garrison's report was In the Presi
dent's hands long before the letter's an
nual message to Congress was given
out for distribution to the press.
STERLING IS OPPOSED
TO STRAIGHT PENSION!
Senator Tells Navy Yard Men People
Would Revolt at $159.-
000,000 Cost.
"Is this country to labor under the
reproach that It ts the only great na
tion in the world that haa failed to
provide, in old age, for men and wom
en who have spent all of their lives in
serving it?" said Senator Thomas Ster
ling, of South Dakota, addressing l.joo
employes of the Washington Navy
Yard, at a banquet In the Arcade last
night.
"I favor the Perkins bill, which pro
vides for the compulsory contribution
plan, and I believe it will be relntro-
duced at the next session of Congress." I
said Senator Sterling. "My Impression
Is that the people would revolt against
the straight pension plan, which would
cost the country S159.000.000 after It
had been In operation twenty-flvs
years.
"Although I am eager to see civil serv
ice retirement become a reality. I be
lieve that to ask Congress for legislation
now would be a great risk," said William
E. Andrews, auditor of the Treasury De
partment. "I am certain the people of
the country would not act affirmatively
on the question now. Kducate the people
by showing them that government re
tirement pensions would not reach the
alarming amount they Imagine."
Other addresses were delivered by T.
P. Sylvan, author of the Bell Telephone
pension system, and Rev. Dr. Granger,
who presented the question from the
moral andethlcal standpoint.

GARDNER BACK
ATMRJILSON
Says President Erected a
Man -of Straw in
Message.
OVER NATIONAL DEFENSE
Representative Attacks Administra
tion's Military Policy Outlined in
Address to Congress.
A reply to that portion of President
Wilson's message to Congress In which
he decried the agitation for increased ar
maments was made in the House yester
day by Representative Augustus P. Gard
ner, of Massachusetts, author of the re
solution proposing the creation of a
national securities commission. Mr. Gard
ner, who spoke In caustic vein, charac
terized the administration attitude to
ward the national defense as the "lullaby
policy." He charged that the President
had erected a man of straw, and then
sought to destroy it "with the grape
shoS of his scholarly eloquence."
"I sat at the feet of Gamaliel the day
before yesterday while he discoursed on
our present capacity to defend ourselves
against a foreign enemy," exclaimed Mr.
Gardner, who was frequently applauded
by Republicans.
Mr. Gardner announced that In advo
cating a policy that would enabl. tha
i'nited States to get Itself In a readiness
for war he proposed "to discuss the situ
ation in the cencrete and to get most of
the cocoanut Inside the shell of the Presi
dent's generalities." Mr. Gardner paused
at one stage In his seech to challenge
Representative Hay. of Virginia, chair
man of the House Committee on Military
Affairs, to call to the stand Gen. Wooo.
and Gen. Wotherspoon. former Chiefs of
Staff of the army; Assistant Secretary of
the Navy Roosevelt and Admiral Waln
wrlght, to support on refute Mr. Gard
ner's contention that the country Is in a
woeful state of unpreparedness for war.
Chairman Hay believes In the administra
tion's "lullaby policy." Replying to Mr.
Gardner's challenge. Mr. Hay said he
would put Gens. Wotherspoon and Wood
and others on the stand "If he thought it
necessary."
Mr. Gardner declared that he did not
ask Congress to create a large standing
army, or that the young men of the
country should spend the best years of
their lives In the military service. All
he asked, he said, was a p aceful In
vestigation by an Independent commla
sion "which shall ! charged with the
duty of recommending to the country ex
actly what we ought to do to Insure
our national safety." The only sugges
gestlon of compulsory military .ervlee.
he said, had come from' Assistant Secre
tary Roosevelt, of the Navy Department,
and hs added that the President "has
the power to discipline Mr. Roosevelt
for his temerity, but he should not rely
on Mr. Roosevelt's words for stuffing his
man of straw."

Poland have received -. f--' re-enforcements,
according to an olT. ial review of
the military situation In Poland and
GaJicla, published in the Army M-sseng r

The review follows:
"It is estimated that th Germans have
brought "'.' men. Including 60.000 cav
alrymen from the wtstern theater of war
to the eastern, part of them have been
sent Into East Prussia where the Ger
man are enraged in renewing their cam

to a supreme decision of tiv Raise i :

territory and gradually abandon the orig
inal plana for an invasion on Russian
soil
"The Germans are throwing them
selves into the fray with frantic des
peration at both ends of the Russian
line. Their renew d attempt yesterday
with the aid of strong r- nofrcements,
to pierce the Russian front south of
Cracow was defeated with terrible
blood shed.
'Tin- fighting in the region northwest

Tha tis to say It has be-n a series of

The exclusion of automobiles from
the plaza during the progress or the

required size can be arranged. Thus
an Item of expense which had to be
borne last year will be eliminated. Ap
peals for contributions to the general
