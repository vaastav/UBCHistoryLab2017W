The Pioneer Press enters the confessional
and publishes a letter from Manager Scott,
of the Opera bouse, showing that their exces
sive demands for gratuities have been de
nied. It puts in the plea that thio does not
influence its criticism but it is endeavoring to
"elevate, the standard" of amusement no
tices. Oh, yes, exactly. But this elevating
the standard did not occur to them until the
demand for fifteen tickets per night was re
fused. Hereafter the public will know just
how to rate the abuse which the P. P. is
heaping on the Grand Opera house and the
companies which appear there.
Somebodt sent Gov. Cleveland the present
of a Newfoundland puppy and the gilt was
accepted. At this the New York World grew
hint-holy and animadverted to the gift
taking in Grant's time, which was a sort of
bull-pup and yellow dog period, and hoped
the incoming President would draw the line
at tbe young Newfoundland and let that end
It. By tbe next day the World had recovered
its tone perceptibly and was quite resigned
to the canine episode, philosophizing thus:
Gov. Cleveland ha* accepted a Newfoundland
"purp" in his Gubernatorial capacity. It is his
purpose to accept no gift*, we believe, after en
taring the Wnite llout>e. The twelve-pound
piece of melancholy plum-pudding which has
beeu forwarded by the Democrats of Richmond.
Va., will come under the rule.
The- World's hint is a good one.
CHEERFUL TIE \V OpIiUSIS-ESS.
The scandalous efforts of certain public
' journals, to spread abroad alarm in regard to
a claimed unusual depression in business,
consequent upon tbe result of the Presiden
;ial election, in a change of party udmiuistra
tea, is, most reprehensible. Business always
JuiiVrs, more or less, every Presid.-utial year,

Why there should always be a fever of
anxiety among the newspapers in regard to
the publication of the iuP6siveof the Presi
dent to congress is almost a taarvvl. From
time immemorial there baa beeu a strife to
| publish the message first, and in many in
stances the only enterprise of the whole year
among the papers would be to get the earliest
copy of tbe message and issue it in printed
form. The curious thing about tbe matter Is
I that publishers should be At such infinite
{ pains and after considerable expense to
serve the public with a document no one
cares much for and no one ever reads well,
hardly ever reads, perhaps on« man in ten
thousand reads it all through. In
the earlier period, before there
were telegraph facilities 60 copious as
those now enjoyed, when there were no fast
mails, and only the slow and logy &t g>*
coacb, the strife among the publishers was
highly cxhilirating, and it was a grand thing
to issue the message in two or three day* or
more after its delivery, as the distance might
be from Washington, and then time em
ployed in setting the type was a matter of
boa6tfulue6B,and to gain an hour or two over
a rival was a thing so satisfactory that it was
• spoken of at intervals during the year as a
great Journalistic feat and victory.
An instance is recalled of the old Whiz
days, when the publisher of the administra
tion paper in a flourishing city determined
to outdo his Democratic neighbor. He sought
the postmaster an 'l procured from him
a key that would uulock the mall bags, aud
being also armed with an order to tue post
master of a given town many miles away,
the enterprising publisher stationed relays
of horses at short distances bo that they
could be pushed at high speed, and then
calmly waited tbe advent of the coach bear
ing the coveted document. Upon Its arrival
be possess«d himself of all copies of papers
containing the message, und role post haste
wit.'i frothing steeds to Bet vis printers at
! work, thinking tbe while of the great scoop
in store for his rival. What was his dismay
upon arriving 1 I town toliud that bis cotcm
purary bad outwitted him, and having pro
cured "copy" from another quarter, had bis
paper already out containing President Fill
more's message. Of course there
was crowing, long and loud upon
tbe part of the successful printer, and in de
scribing the efforts of tbe unsuccessful party
a graphic account was given of the method
adopted to secure the prize, a part of which
was the charge upon the Wulg editor of rob
bing the mail, a mluute description being
given of his intercepting the coach, seizing
the mail bag as if a highwayman and open
ing tbe same by means of a rat-tail file. Tais
was too much. It was bad enough to be
beateu in the enterprise, but to be charged
with being a mail robber was not to be en
dured, so tbe Whig editor brought a libel
suit against his Democratic brother and they
were forever at enmity, though the law suit
was never tried.
Some of the Presidents, in order to accom
modate tbe press, sent out advance copies,
so that as soon as the message might be de
livered to congress it could also be given to
the public, and simultaneously in all parts
of the country. But this plan failed to meet
the emergency, as some publishers forgot to
wait until the message bad been read to
congress. Latterly the strife for the early
copy has been centered at Washington, and
the special correspondents vie with each
other to secure the great catch. A few years
ago an advance proof was stolen from the
President's office and sold to a New York
and two western papers for $1,500, and the
message published before its delivery.
One of tbe western papers was the Chicago
Times, but its enterprise was really unavail
ing. The Chicago Tribune got an early copy
of the New York Times, which was one of the
$1,500 syndicate, and tbe difference in time
between New York and Chicago, the use of
the wires and the fact that it was Sunday
morning when papers do not have early mails
to meet, enabled the Tribune to be on tbe
street within half an hour of the Tima with
tbe message complete.
It is tbe custom now of tbe Presidents to
observe the greatest secrecy in the prepara
tion of their messages and to prevent all sur
reptitious access. Grant submitted bis mes
sage to Congress in . manuscript, thus nar
rowing his secret to few bands.
In the preparation of his message which
will reach Congress to-day, President Arthur
has used all safeguards. He has caused it
nil to be put in type at the Government
Printing office. To prevent premature pro
mulgation, the copy is placed in scaled envel
opes, has been sent in small Installments by
special messenger to the Public Printer. The
type has been set in a small room, by a few
trusty men under the eye of the Public
Printer.
As the copy was put In type a proof was
taken by the Public Printer and the type then
taken to the clerk's office and put Into a 6afe.
The Public Printer having read the first proof
and superintended the corrections another
proof was taken to send to the President,
and the type re locked in the safe. This
procedure it was thought would secure to
congress the first presentation of the message
and 60 far the plan is not known to have
miscarried.
Death of Mrs. Alexander Ramsey.
It is rare that co sad a task ba.s been imp- ceil
upon a St. Paul paper us to be compelled to an
nounce the death cf Mr*. Anna Earl Ramsey,
wife of ex-Governor and ex-Senator Ale*« d r
Ramsey. The cad ml occurred at 4 p. m. yes
terday at the family residence on Exchange
street, after an Illness of seme month*, though
only a few weeks of absolute entire confinement
to the houoe.
This estimable lady was born at Newton, Pa.,
in 1828, and came to Minnesota In 1813, when 23
years of age. She had married Gov. liamsev
five years previous and upon hi« being appointed
Governor of Minnesota accompanied him to his
western residence and this city has' been her
home ever t-iuce, embracing a ppriod of thirty
five years. Besides her husband, an only child,
Mrs. Chus. Furni»6. and her brother J. R. Jcnks,
Esq., are the immediate arriving relatives.
With the exception of the twelve year* which
Senator Ramsey served in the Senate at Wash
iugtou and the short period that ho wan a mem
ber of the Cabinet, Mrs. Ramsey's residence has
been in St. Paul. In public life she proved most
graceful and accomplished, and «M a material
aid in her husband's political preferment. She
adorned every circle in which she moved, and
though the official station of Gov. Kamsey
brought her into public life, it wa
in the private and home circle where
the was at her best, and where she leaves only
kind and loving memories. A very literal pion
! Me In western life, she took an active part in
I every good work for the development of the lo
| cality where she resided, e nd the earlier settlers
of St. Paul will feel in her death a personal be
| reavement. Gov. lUm&ey has the deep sym
pathy of the community, a sympathy based upon
! the love and respect entertained for the estima
i Ma lady who has been hi.- iife companion.

There ought to be some penalty for In
jurious t. utb telling aside from the gabbling !
i of the hurt.. Fur instance that poor Dr. Bur
chardbe will hare to sro about his few re
maining days on earth wish the finder cf
partisan »com pointed at him for hi* blund
ering, yet most bonegt candor. Now i: Jeff |
Davis had been — we'll 6av the nee to hoist ]

{it Is true, jet rather on the heroic as well, j
I But to survive in a defeated, worthless and I
'. wholly spiked life — a tolerated poacher on
the plantation of a fatuous admirer whose
. kin contest his ownership— this Is indeed
such a subsidence of the heroic, yea, of the
i respectable, as makes one almost regret
'. that the sour apple tree threat wasn't
literal.
Mr. IV. D. Heard finely said In 1579 in a
memorably noble old settlers' address — "no
, more strange than that the widow's son .the

' should fill exclusively M that there Is room

No more strange indeed, when he could

With the New York board of education ex
! tant it will not be necessary to wait for the
'■ slow crybtalizing verdict of posterity in
settling the fame of poets and authors.
1 In a recent session of this board when the
j report of the committee on Course and Study
and School books came up, Commissioner
| Wood opposed the use of William Culleu
' Bryant's poetry in the schools, because it was
second rate, and if says be pupils must read
any, it should be the best poetry such as
Longfellow's and Whittlt-r's. He regarded
Bryant favorably as a political economist but
, his poetry wasn't worth much, and the board
voted to exclude it.
'Tis well for the once fairly regarded au
thor of ThinatopsU that his extinguisher's
; name is Wood, and what he affected was
naturally and narrowly a Board. At eighty
I years of age Bryaut used occasionally to walk
up the stairs of the Evening Post building,
and there are eleven flights of them, of which
there are nine from the street to the office
where he worked. Perhaps notwithstanding
this set back to bis fame the poet will keep
up the flights of bis poetic repute for all _
Commissioner Wood's disapprobation.
The account of the A6tor- Wilson wedding,
with 'pictorial illustrations in some of the
New York papers is suggestive reading. Tue
coat of arms in one picture is a queer be
longing when one thinks of the old peddler
founder of the family, John Jacob Astor.who
once sold knick knacks out of bis pack, about
William, Wall and Beaver streets. It would
have been a bold idea to have commem
orated that pack In American Heraldry be
cause out of it came the vast wealth, and
social distinction of the Astors of to-day.
Not one of them Is remarkable for anything
but the towering income from enormous
rents, and the hereditary tendency to care
for little else outsiue the finances of the
family. Once in a while they give thousands
to some worthy charity, Newsboy's Lodging
Houses and the like, which seems large to
the ' public reading of such
gifts, but they are in fact
no extravagant donations In view of the stu
pendous riches of the givers. Mrs. Aster's
dinner to the patients in Bellevue hospital at
the same time that the grandees were at the
wedding feast in the Fifth Avenue palace
reads like some beautiful benefaction — but in
reality aside from the transient thoughtful
ness it isn't worth the sentimental gush of
the newspapers.
ides we are informed that Mrs. Astor's
kind remembrance whereby the poor and
sick feasted at the same time with the rich,
was in accordance with old tradition — to in
sure a happy and auspicious marriage, which
old tradition with its ensuing happiness and
ausptciousness was in the market to be
bought like everything else with the Actor
money — in aSchemerborn's band* however.
The Astors themselves couldn't do it with
out considerable violence to the peddler's
blood which never spent a dollar for personal
comfort, and as for luxury it would have
seemed heinous to him. but now as an "an
cestor" be has a coat of arms which would
require a Thackeray to quarter yea and cut
up In a manner befitting the Astor history.
The best part of this recent wedding is
that the golden Miss Astor loved the fortu
nate young man she married, who while be
had money enough to have been a matrimo
nial prize toother girls, must still have
seemed an indigent creature among the
Astor money gods.
The newspaper* have bad much to say
about Mrs. John Beccb<-r, who was dis
patched with the bow string in Japau said
one account, for inconstancy to the prime
minister who was presumptious enough to
consider himself the bolder of her allegiance
pro tern. Another version makes
her . alive, and detached from
oriental MM and intrigues, In Switzerland.
You can believe anything about her except
the accounts concerning her beauty past or
present. Years ago hi New York society she
wag surely a. striking looking woman of the
yellow variety as to hair and skin, and of a
naturalness in manners which killed off the
least rivalry among other women for only
a few would care for conquests on such term*
when they Involved costiy coovcntioaalitiis,
and hurtful conjecture. ' Men who admire
such women and marry them are usually
quite agreeably surprised that they are
uot the other kind, and they bccoa.o so
shocked at the discovery tL-t nothing, can
assuage their disappointment save divorce.
Mr. John Beecber got one. Perhaps he
knew he could, and if he failed to recognize
the possibilities for it he must have been a
tstupid wiiul. The Ooost de
PourUnce next allowed the use of bis name,
but bis tie Is said to have required no divorce,
aud Mrs. ex-lift was free to tro to Japan
or Guinea in quest of advt-utun 8.
• But she never was beautiful nor even in
teresting, yet she will always be called so, as
she will be known to the last as Mrs. Beecber.
which seems to be a name of wonarous vital
ity for man and woman.
Historical beauties arc rather curiously de
scribed for beauties at times. Fancy one of
them the Duchess of Burgundy of Louis
XlY's time, who had a goitrous neck and
decayed front teeth, and yet Is passed down
to us as a beauty.
Marguerite de Valois renowned likewise
for personal charms and conquest* makes
the attractive picture for us of having had
heavy monkey checks, very prominent con
gested eyes, and a thick hanging under lip.
Bishop Ireland's citation of St. Augustine
in the following extract is timely and perti

June, 1877, in which bs said Republicans
must nut think of any other means beyond :
moral resisUuce for the political advance

of putting the Aurustiuian sentiment, but
the corroboration U from a very uncxp.cted
source, surely.
There Is no man that like "Younj: Loch

sentially a Western man in all the best act

in this ampler air — spiritualized in John

The revenues were $2,170,565.53, or 4.7
per cent less than those of the previous year:
the decrees beinc attributable to the due
tion of letter postage from three to tiro cents
which took effect October 1, 1883.
In addition to the amount expended for
the service of the year, $519,5'J9.62 was paid
on account of liabilities of previous years,

REDUCTION I!« TUB KATE OP POSTAGE.
The past year marked an Important epoch
in the history of the postal t--rvice throuzh
the reduction in the lettt r rate of postage
from three to two cent*, taking < fleet on the
Ist of October, I*S3. under the provision*
of the act of Hatch 3, 188 < As the class of
matter ■ affected yielded kf far the
larger portion of the postal revenue,
the chance, of course. produced
an immediate falling off In the receipts. .The
ordinary postal revenue for the year ended
June 30, 1354, tsj $2,275,433.24* less than
that of the preceding ar. To this loss
should of course be added that of the natural
increase to have been expected had the three
cent rate remained in force. An increase
of 9 per cent, on the ordinary mini of
ISS3 (exclusive of the money «>rlcr business)
would amount to $4,053,735.59,wh1cb, added
to the amount previously stated, would give
16,337,174. 53 to represent the loss for the
first year under . the change in the rat« .
Ti«>us;b the three cent rat*- was in force dur
ing the quarter ended Sept. 30, .1853, the
sales of stamps, etc., for that quarter were
$137,271.65 less than the average for the
three remaining quarters under the two
cent rate; the anticipated chancre In the rate
having led to a serious falling off in the mile
of stamps. That the loss of revenue was
not create r must be regarded as gratifying,
In view of the fact that the estimates on
which the change was based contemplated a
loss for the first year of about $5,000,000. It
is evident the prediction has be n fully ver
ified that the reduced rate wcuM greatly
stimulate letter correspondence, and lead to
the substitution of sealed in closures for pos
tal cards and open circulars. The increase
in the number of letters cannot be stated,
the department having no statistics to show
the number of pieces of each of the several
classes of matter mailed, and the same kind
of stamps being used indiscriminately for
first, third and fourth-class matter. Neither
do the sales furnish any guide, since post
masters in accounting to the auditor report
the amount In the aggregate- and not In rle
tail of the several kinds and denominations.
A comparison of the issues to postmasters
of two and 3-cent stamp-* and stamped en
velopes for the nine months ended June 30,
1883 under the 3-cent rate, with the Issue of
two and 3-ceut stamps and stamped envel
opes during the corresponding nine months
ended June 30, 1834, under the 2 -cent rate,
may be found of interest in this connection,
though affording no certain Indication of th a
actual sales. During the nine months
ended June 30, 1883, the number of 2-cent
stamps and stamped envelopes issued was
104,642,125, valued at $2,092,842.50, and of
3-cent stamps and stamped envelopes 653,
--629,330, valued at $19,608,879.90. The
number of 2-cent stamps and tamped en
velopes issued during the nine months ended
June 30, 1884, was 955,427,400, valued at
$19,103,548, and of three-cent stamps (the
issue of three-cent stamped envelope* hav
ing ceased) was 127,300, valued at $3,819.
The total number of two and three-cent
stamps and envelopes issued, therefore,
during the former period was 758,271,445,
valued at $21,701,722.40. and during the lat
ter period 1)55.554,700," va1ued at $19,112,367;
an increase In number of 197,233,245. or 26
per cent., and a decrease in value of $2,539,
--355.40, or 11.9 per cent.
In postal cards there was a decrease In the
issues of 16.640,000, or 4.5 per cent., for the
year ended June 30, ISS4, as compared with
the previous year.' During the preceding live
years there has been an average annual in
crease of 13.68 per cent.
POSTAGE OX SECOND CLASS MATTER.
The amountof postage collected on second
class matU-r during the year was $1,559.
--592.14, an increase of $184,414.61, or 10.82
per cent, over the previous year.
Of the receipts from this source 24. per
cent, was collected at New York; 9.41 per
cent, at Chicago; 6.42 per cent, at Boston;
5.08 per cent, at Philadelphia; 4.67 per cent,
at St. Louis; 3.53 p.>r cent, at Cincinnati;
1.82 per cent, at San Francisco; 1.54 per
cent, at Milwaukee; 1.51 per cent, at De
.rolt; 1.32- per cent, at Louisville; 1.22 per
cent, at Cleveland; 1.20 per ceot. at Elgin,
III.; 1.15 per cent, at Washington ; 1.09 per
cent, at St. Paul; 1.06 per cent, at Augusta,
Me. ; 1 .0.1 per cent, at Toledo; 1.05 per cent,
at PilUbunr; .88 per cent, at Baltimore. The
remaining 31.06 per ceut. was collected at
5,707 puatoflices.
REGISTRATION.
The number of letters and parcels sent
through the registered mails during the year
whs 11,240,545. of which 8,063,333 were " do
mestic letters, 466,902 were letters a ldressed
to foreign countries, 1.005.565 were domestic
parcels of third and fourth-class matter, 29,
--453 were parcels of third ami foutth-ela?*
matter to foreign countries, aud 1,875,052
were letters and parcels of official matter for
the government, by law free from the pay- !
ment of registry fees. The amount of regis
try fees collected was $957,059.30, an - in
crease of 509. 60, or 8.3 per cent, over
the previous year.
The actually ascertained losses during the
year number 516. or one i::, every 21.795 let-
Urn and parcels registered. This is a smaller
proportion of loss than in any previous year,
and shows increasing efficiency and fidelity
on the part of postal officials in this branch
of the service.
DEAI> LETTERS.
The gross receipts of articles of undeliv
ered mall matter during the year were
4,751,872, being an increase of a little more
than 8 per cent, over the previous year.
There was a decrease in the bcld-for -postage
matter received of 44.681, or '"about 34 per
cent., which was cans:::! by the reduction of
postage on letter* (many of those which
were formerly detained by postage in cities
having been actually prepaid by a 2 cent
•tamp,) and the chanced method of treating
such matter in posiomces. The new prac
tice is to postmasters to notify the persons
addressed that their letters or parcels, are
withheld for prepayment of postage, and to
forward the articles to destination upon the
receipt of the amount due. Under previous
regulations, the matter was sent to the dead
letter office, and the notice sent from there.
TDK CARRIER SERVICE.
The postmasters and employes of the
service number 71,671. '
The carrier delivery erlsta In 159 cities

RAILWAT MAIL SERVICE.
AH railway postal clerks are appointed for
a probationary period of six months, during
which time their fitness and capacity for the
service are tested. . They are examined <
monthly as to their knowledge of the postal !
laws and regulations, as well as the practical
workings of their office. If, at the expiration
of this probation period, they have proven
lwMß)*»tv«a competent, they are given a full
appointment at class one. Alter an appoint
ment in class one, all clerks are promoted,
nLcacdlasx to merit, when vacancies occur.
It usually takes a clerk several years to
work his way up to class five, which is the
highest grade. The clerks of this size are in
charge ol an office in a car which is known
as a railway postotlic, and usually have
wrerul clerks under their direction.
T ere ar.- at tie present time about four
thousand <• It- rks in the way mail service,
m ii.y if them aving been so employed a
irre number of years. The amount of
ipect«] stu .y that the*e clerks have devoted
to i«e uut.i s. of their Bee would have made
them proficient in almost uny of the profes
sion* of life.
Darin; the past twelve years not a single
clerk has t*-en removed without good cause,
and that cause has been incompcteucy, in
tempi riii cc, or neglect of duty. By such
means the clerks have, in great measure, feit
s -i v em their tenure, and have devoted
themselves with all energy to tue best iutor
esU of the service.
TUB POSTAL MONEY ORDER SYSTEM.

POSTAL notes.
The following statistics of the postal note
business for the first ten months of its opera
tion, from Sept. 3, ISS3, to June 30, 1384,
are interesting, inasmuch as they exhibit the
large field which this new means of remitting
small sums has already occupied, and show
the relation, in extent of business done, be
tween the postal notes and th« money orders:

Cathedra,! Service. •
The first Sunday of Advent was,
as is usual, marked at the Cathedral
yesterday by most impressive cere
monies and the attendance of the
I large number of communicants of the Cath
olic faith at all the masses. High mass at
half past 10 o'clock was celebrated by the Rev.
Father Reilly, and a most instructive sermon,
appropriate to the occasion, was delivered by
the Rev. Father Burns. A most grati
yiag feature of the service was the quality
of toe music. Messieurs Fabrini and Brod
crick, tenor and basso, respectively, and
soloists of the Emma Abbott Opera company
vow performing in St. Paul, "kindly volun
teered their services for the occasion, and it
is needless to say that the singing partook of
a character waica elicited the encomia ms of
an approclatve and grateful"* congregation.
The solo at the ''offertory" was rendered by
Mr BrodericK, the selection being the Fro
Prccatis" from Rossini's "Subat Mater."
Tula composition is regarded by musician «
a* one of the most brilliant and difficult pro
ductions of its gifted author. Mr. Bruderick
is to be complimented upon his masterly
rendition of tue work; his beautiful, and at
the same time powerful and resonant voice
penetrating every portion of the sacred
structure and cementing:, in tie universal
opinion of Ids auditors, his deserving reputa
tion as a finished vocal artist.

Louisville, Ky., Nov.' 3o. —The Courier-
Journal's staff correspondent, who Is in the
mountains of eastern Kentucky investi
gating he plaeue of that section, sends tho
following to-night from' Borbounvitle, Ky. :
I met Mr. C. F. Davidson, agent of the
Cumberland River Lumber corn pan v, who hail
been over the infected district. Mr. Davidson
says: "The disease, which is an aggravated
and very fntal form of flux, began about six
weeks ago in Letcber county. Joseph Day,
brother of the county judge, being the first
victim. lie lives on Poor Fork, about fifteen
mlle3from ■unhand was taken ill when
a short distance from home. He
was first seized with a grip-
Ing pain, and in a few moment!
was paralyzed so completely that he had to be
carried to the how The griping «M fol
lowed by a bloody and weakening diarrhoea,
and in a few hours he was a dead man. From
thi3 point the disease i»pre.ad with great ra
pidity, and it now extends over a territory
embracing about one-half of the north por
tion of Wise county, Virginia, the north
western portion of Lee county, Virginia,
the entire county of toiler in Kentucky,
the upwr edirc- of Horton county, soutuwtst
ern part of Knot:. southwestern* part of Pike
ami southwestern portion of Leslie. Tins
embraces a territory about twenty miles
wide by eighty milesin length.'.!
"In what particular neighborhoods is the
disease the worst ?''
It is most violent at the headwater? ot
Straight creek. Clover fork and other small
streams, which rise on the north side of the
pine mountains, and on Poor Fork in Har
lem, at the head oi Powell's creek an ' other
stre-ms rising in the Cumberland mountains
in Wise county, Virginia. At the head of
those streams, which rise in Knott and empty
into the Bus Sandy, at the head of North
Fork and another branch of Powell's creek
in Lee county, Virginia, at the heads of
Shelby and Elk Horn creaks in Pike, and at
scattered points on streams in Letcher aud
Leslie. In Leteher it is worse along Poor
Fork. It prevails at the headwaters of
almost every stream in the district
named that empty into the Cumberland,
Big Sandy, Kentucky, Powell's and Eliciting
rivtr. hi variably it is most widespread
closest tJ the higaest mountains."
"How lung does it generally take for the
disease to run its course, and what are its
exact symptoms.
"About two days, and it generally proves
fatal. In many instances those attacked
died in a few hour*. The symptoms are as
related la the case of Joseph Day, griping
pains in the stomach, violent flux and hem
orrhage of the bowels after a total or partial
paralysis and intense thirst. The latter sat
isfies me that mineral poison is the real cause
of the epidemic. It is a well known fact
that the streams along which the disease pre
vails Ind their beginning In the mountains
among rocks containing alkali, arsenites
and other poisonous minerals. Until re
cently no rain bad fallen for many weeks, and
the streams liad nearly dried up. The
water remaining, and which these
people an forced to use was
therefore powerfully charged with these
poisons und continued use of it resulted in
the epidemic. One peculiar feature of it is
that it is certainly contagions, for if it once
entered a family it let Done escape, aid I
have been told of Instances where those who
have visited afflicted persons and have not
themselves used wutej- have contracted the
disease.
"Has any rain fallen lately in the infected
region 1"
"Yes, light rains fell last week, but Ido
not think they were sufficient t» purify the
water and cheek the disease.' 1
"Mow about the reported famine?"
"The people raise little beside corn, and
while the :rop was not heavy this year, they
are about as well oil as last year.
Of course, there may . have been
individual cases of suffering, for instance,
when an entire' family was down with the
disease, but if there were any I have not
heard of them."
"Have you any idea of the number who
have fallen victims to the plaguef 1
•I em cive no reliable estimate, but from.
800 to 1,000 would probably cover it. 1 base
my conjectures solely upon the death aver
age in the particular neighborhoods which 1
have visited."
•'I presume there were many very pitiable
cases f"
"Yes, some very shocking. In one crave
yard at a point on Straight creek, in Harlon
county, seven people were buried one day
last week. In the family of Judge Day, the
death of whose brother I mentioned, there
were live deaths, his wife and four little ones
falling a prey to the awful plague. In the
same locality deaths hive been very num
erous. At the head of Clover Fork, in Har
lan county, and just at the foot of Garrison's
gap crossing, in the black mountains, lived
a family by the name of Clark, the hus
band and lather now serving
out a sentence at Frankfort for murder
I believe. The wife and four children, who
are as poor as the poorest you can find in the
mountains eked out a livelihood as best they
might from the arid land on which they had
their abode. The disease attacked them and
in a few days they were all dead. In Wise
county, Virginia, I was told that thus,- bury
ing the dead were two days behind
their work.and could not begin to gather up
and coffin the victims as fast as
they fell. I was told by most reliable gentle
men living at Poor Fork poßtufHee in llarlau
county that twenty-five new graves have
been tilled in the cemetery on the banks of
Poor Fork in Letcher county, near, the Ilarlan
line. Many other instances of the same na
ture were either told me or came under my
observation, but I cannot just now recall
them."
"Do the people appear to be much alarmed
at the progress of lue disease?"
"No, they talk about it a creat deal, but I
dM not see a person who appeared to be at
all frightened. They arc a sort of careless,
easy going class, never borrow trouble and
take life just as it comes, good or bad.
I learned from other sources last evening
that the plague bad also made its appearance
in this (Knox) county, and that a number
of cases had occurred on Stinkijg creek,
from fifteen to twenty miles distant from
this place. Several cases were also reported
on Goose creek. The disease does not ap
pear to have the same virulence in these lo
calities, however, as in those mentioned
above, and the mortality is com
paratively email. This morning I leave in
company with Mr. Davidson, lor Pineville
and bit Pleasant, and, in all probability, will
cuter Leteher county and Wise county, Va.,
betore my return."
