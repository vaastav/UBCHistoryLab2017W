American minister Peirce in an elo-',
quent speech thanked parliament in
the president's name and read the fol

am profoundly gratified and touched by
the signal honor shown me through^
your body in conferring on me the/
Nobel peace prize. Tnere is nO gift
I could appreciate more and wish it:
•were in my power to fully express my'
gratitude, I thank you for it, thank you
in behalf of the United States for what!
I did I was able to accomplish only as a
representative of the nation of whichj
for time being I am president. After
much thought I have concluded that'
the best and most fitting way to apply
the amount of the prize is by using it(
as a fund to establish at Washington a'
permanent industrial peace committee.:
The object will be to strive for better
and more equitable relations among',
my countrymtn who are engagedi
whether as capitalists or wage work
ers in industrial and agricultural pur-,
suits. This will carry out the purpose
of its founder.

The shippers of oil advise the bu

years they are now rapidly obtain

transportation companies." Ex
tract from Garfield's report.
Washington, Dec. 12.—In his annual
report made public today Corporations
Commissioner Garfield says in part:
"During the- investigation of the oil
industry it was discovered that a very
widespread system of railway discrim-".
inations existed in favor of the Stan
dard Oil company, affecting a very
large proportion of the country r.nd re
sulting substantially in giving "to the
Standard Oil company an overwhelm
ing advantage in transportation in al
most all sections of the country that
this system had been in existence for
a number of years, and that largely
by virtue of it tne Standard has beeii
able to restrict or eliminate competi
tion throughout many parts of thei
country and thereafter reap the bene
fits of monopoly.
"These railway discriminations took
various forms, often very ingenious in
their nature, and so skillfully concealed"
that their existence was very rarely
suspected even by the active competi
tors of the Standard, although such'
competitors knew that in a general
way they were doing business at I
disadvantage.
WOMAN WHIPS MAN
AFTER BACKING HIS
THEATRICAL WORK
New Tork, Dec. 12.—Mrs. C. C. At
wood, a dashing young widow in a pic
ture hat, used a silver handled riding1
whip on Eugene B. Sanger, a theatrical
agent, in front of his office in thev
Knickerbocker Theater building, on
Broadway. She was welting him at a
lively clip when Policeman John Brady
interfered.
The widow was mad clear through
and Sanger was so uncertain as to
what to do that Policeman Brady
thought the best way to settle the diffi
culty was to have a police magistrate1
hear both sides. An hour later Mrs.
Atwood was at the bridge of Jefferson
Market police court. Then it lie»^.'.cped,
according to the story told Magistrate
Mayo, that she was an angel—a theat
rical angel.
"I gave Sanger and his partner, Rich
ard Pittman, $3,000—every cent I had
in the world—to back their theatrical
agency," said the widow emotionally.
^That was about a year ago, soon aft
er I came here from Mexico City. I
pawned all my jewels to raise the
money and Pittman went with me
when I negotiated the loan. I was
cheated out of the money, and that ia
all there is to it."
FREES HER CUB BY
GNAWING OFF LEG
Chamhord Junction, P. Q., Dec. 12.—
Henry Tate, a trapper, got track of a
silver gray fox and used his utmost
skill to catch the valuable animal. He
set several traps, and was sure that
the fox sprung one of them. Thinking
that the steel jaws were not heavy
enough to hold so clever a prisoner, lis
finally set a wolf trap near an old log
.and then baited it with a live chicken.
For three days he fed the chicken
without even getting sight of the fox,
but on the fourth he heard sounds as
he neared the spot. The sounds were
evidently made by two animals, but
not foxes and he approached cautious
ly. Peering through the bushes he saw
an old bay lynx and an 8-months-old
cub directly over the trap. The young
one was crying out with pain, while the
•old one now and then snarled and
grunted.

Sturgls, S. D., Dec. 1.'.—President Roose-^
velt can find plenty and sincere backing in'
his attitude against the colored troops in
this town and in Valentine, Neb., both of
which places have been "shot up" by
members of the Twenty-fifth infantry,
which has finally exceeded the llmJt at
Brownsville, Tex.
Both here and at Valentine murders,
were committed in the most wanton man
ner and at the latter place the guilty men,
although seen to leave the. scene of the
crime were never caught because for fear
of their own lives and of the "stick-to
gether" policy of the colored men, wit
nesses could not be found who would tes
tify to the truth. At Sturgis, September
23-24, 1S85, the raiders were under command
of one of iheir number, but at Valentino
just after their return from the Philip
pines, October 29, 1S04, the affair was of a
more clandestine nature.
From an account of the Sturgls raid, irf
a local newspaper, the following is taken:
Terrorized Town Killed One.
"Last Saturday night a crowd of color
ed soldiers from Fort M-eade, members
of Company H, Twenty-fifth infantry,N
marched up the main street of Sturgis, in
file of fours with their arms, the prop-\
erty of the United States and under com
mand of one of their number, fired up
wards of fifty shots into various buildings.
They killed one man, an inoffensive cow
boy who, was looking out of a window..
This crowd of murderous men arrived
about 2 in the morning. They had escap
ed sentry, guard and patrol and taken,
their guns from the barracks, with whichi
bo commit this crime of murder. They
marched up the street with military pre-*
cision and at the command given by John)
Taylor, in command of the squad, came'
to a halt in front of Hill's place. Taylor,
gave the order to lire and the place was
riddled with bullets. After this these 'de-',
fenders of our country' fired several more,
volleys at random, Judge Ash experienc-',
ing a narrow escape as he was looking out,
of his window. Whenever a citizen show-\
ed himself these men fired and but for the I
poor markmanship of the mob there!
would have been more deaths. The wholei
town was terrorized and at the mercy
of the raiders."
Four Sent Up for Life.
The newspaper relates that troops from
the fort scattered the mob, that a cor-•
oner's inquest on the body of Robert S.
Bell, the murdered man resulted in identi
fying Evans, Watson, Greer and Taylor.5
A later issue says the four men were sen-,
tenced to life imprisonment.
It was in the fall of 1S85 that Dr. R.
Lynch was murdered in cold blood by Cor-,
poral Ilallen of the colored troops and al-'
though the murderer was summarily dealt:
with by the enraged citizens, the shooting:
of the doctor is still remembered here with!
feelings of hatred for the negro soldiers,
Dr. Lynch had been called to treat Mame,
Lewis, a sweetheart of Corporal Hallen,.
whom the latter had brutally beaten. He
remarked to the woman that Hallen'
should be prosecuted and when she later:
related this to Hallen the trooper swore

The woman told on Hallen and when he
was placed in the jail the citizens broke

The "shooting up'
of Valentine, Neb.,
was related the other day by C. H. Cornell
of that place, who said: "If those colored
pastors itnd people would investigate at a
little closer range they would mollify their'
resolutions and memorials directed against
an honest and courageous president."
Two battalions of the Twenty-lif tli regi-.
men: were stationed at Fort Niobrara,!
be a in a he am re at on to a
entine, respective distance and commercial!
interests, as Fort Brown does to Browns-,
ville, Tex. The raid was on a dance hall,
kept by a discharged colored soldier, nam

shattered, the dancers miraculously es
caping injury. Sixteen empty Krag-Jor-'
genscn cartridges were found arid at least'
two soldiers in uniform wcr« st-cn leaving
with their rilles, still as before stated,:
they were never punished.
Mr. Cornell points out that whatever'
excuse prejudice in the south might give
for violence on the part of the negro sol
diers. no such justification exi/ted in the'
north where they were given every con
sideration.
Describing some of their orgies he said:

Zola was devotedly attached to his
wife. They were inseparable com

that he turned for solace when exiled
from France by the powerful enemies
of Dreyfus.
At the same time Zola loved Mme.
Rosereau. She became the mother
of his two children. She had loved
Zola for years before she knew his real
name.
Mme. Zola knew of the intimacy be

Rosereau Mme. Zola insisted that the
mother and the child be invited to her

Then began the strange friendship

and her children, of whom Zola was

Zola's home.
