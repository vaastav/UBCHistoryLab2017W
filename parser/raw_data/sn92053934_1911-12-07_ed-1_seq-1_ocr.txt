Gary urged a federal commission
authorized to consider the manage

warranted. He would give this com

their sons. Their majesties and the
viceroy's suites were next.
HATS ARE DOFFED.
As their majesties approached, the
troops presented arms, European spec
tators took off their hats, and natives
bent deep toward the ground. A body
guard of Indian princes, who followed

M'HANIGAL A WITNESS.
Ortie E. McManigal, the dynamiter
who made the first confession in the
McNamara conspiracy, was taken be
fore the federal grand jury today.
McManigal was the first witness. The
jury is to investigate a conspiracy
alleged to have existed throughout
the United States through which
dynamiting damage running into
millions of dollars has been done;
dynamite has been transported un
lawfully from one state to another
and perhaps that improper use hat
been made of the malls.

Chicago, Dec. 7. Thirty-eight hun

that "If unionism is to prevail it must

STORAGE RAISES
COST OF LIVING
Secretary of Agriculture, in
Annual Report, Tells of
Conditions in Nation.
FARMER GETS 50 CENTS
Who Receives Other Half of Dollai
Is Question Official Can't
Answer.
Washington, Dec. 7. "The consum
er pays a dollar for food; the farmer
gets less than fifty cents of it. Who
gets the rest?"
That is a question which Secretary
Wilson of the department of agricul
ture asks in his annual report. The
secretary does not attempt to answer
it He does explain in some detail
the results of an investigation his de
partment has just concluded into the
effect of cold storage on the whole-
someness and cost of food. His in
vestigation leada him to recommend
publicity for the amount of food in
cold storage, just as :he department
now gives publicity to the condition
of crops from month to month.
COLD STORAGE DELIVERIES.
Instead of food remaining In stor
age for longer than a year or two
years, as a rule, the secretary de
clares that his investigation showed
that "receipts into cold storage are en
tirely or very nearly exhausted by the
deliveries out of cold storage within
ten months."
Lot.g storage is the exception, the
secretary asserts, warehousemen ex
plained to the department that ex
cessive long storage was due to law
suits and other circumstances of an
uncommercial rature. The cost of
storage, including storage charge, In
terest and Insurance, is considered as
a barrier to veiy long storage.
Cold storage, the secretary reports,
has taised the cost of living by In
creasing the annual price level for but
ter and eggs.
The secretary cays that an examina
tion of the record of prices gives a
"suspicion" that there has been much
speculation in some years by the men
who keep commodities in cold storage.
OVERESTIMATE CONSUMPTION.
Ho refers to "atv apparent mistake"
of tfce storage .men. in ovet estimating
the consumption of eggs by the public
at exorbitant prices last winter with
the tesult that In the spring the stor
age men had to sell eggs at remark
ably low prices and send abroad the
largest amount of eggs ever exported
in order to get rid of the supply. The
secretary dedan s that the warehouse
men ought to be required to send to
Washington each month the amount
of commodities placed in storage so
that the public may be able to judge -of
the future trend of prices.
A great variety of subjects are dealt
with by the secretary In his report
He says that the day is not far dis
tant when -the United States will cease
to import potasb, Florida Kentucky,
Tennessee and Idaho are mentioned as
repositories.
RECOMMENDS ONE BUREAU.
Recommendation is made that all
government agencies that- conserve
health should be grouped together in
one bureau. The success of the depart
ment in the southern states through
object lessons In the fields la pronounc
ed to have been such as to justify the
extension of the work to all states.
The department announces that the
corn crop is moving northward by
feed selection.
The American systems of renting
land are declared to be faulty and re
sult in eoil robb'ng. It is suggested
that domestic animals be kept on farms
even if the lanl owneT must furnish
them, and that there be a rotation of
crops.
Af er years of experimentation tha
department says that Egyptian cotton
can be crown io southern California
and bulbs in the state of Washington.
The crayfish is pronounced to be a
serious pest In the south. Carbon bi
sulphide Is said to be a sure remedy.
The finest dates from the Sahara
desert succeed in the southwestern
states.
S 750)00,000 POULTRY.
Poultry products for the past year
are estimated to have been worth
$750,000,000.
The foresters of the forestry bur
eau are learning by experiments how
to reforest 30,000 acres in a year.
The secretary says that ten times
this much must be planted annually
to cover all the bare acres in a gen
eration.
"We are sending explorers to the
ends of the earth for new plants and
getting them," says Secretary Wilson.
The secretary warns the irrigation
farmers that they must conserve
their soil; that irrigation will bring
maximum crops while the land is new
and full of plant food. But where
the crops are sold year by year. Ir
rigation of itself will not of itself
assure good results. s
