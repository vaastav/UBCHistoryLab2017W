In Opposition.
There are unmistakable siins that
the republican party is showing won
derful vitality as an opposition par
ty. This was not only inilicatoil by
the t-ongressional elections last year,
by which the democratic inajonty in
the house of representatives was re
duced from 40 to lo, but it has Wen
indicated this year in nearly all the
elections held from Maine to Califor
nia. There is no loss of republican
states, no flagging in the republican
host. Party distractions and faction
al liues have disappeared. Not only
Lave the ranks solidified but there is
an enthusiasm pervading the party
that has not appeared so strikingly
for yeais.
Nor is it mere enthusiasm, llai
nest purposes underlie it. As the re
publican patty in the majority was
the let party that the country ever
had. This does not consist alone in
keeping vigilant watch of the demo
cratic party, and especially of the
democratic administration. That is
necessary aud useful. But a Ligher
work remains. That work is the
suggestion and formulation of meas
ures for the further advancement of
the country and of the jeople. A
rrkd when no one issue overtops
fl.ll others is just the perk-d for piac
tical legislation ami the practical
statestuaa. It may not be a time
when men shiae. bqt is a time when
their talents may be employed to
great uses.
The republicans in congress have
waited three years for the adminis
tration to present soaje policy. The
best it can do now is to attack the
tariff, running the risk of up-jetting
business and precipitating a pauic.
,The republicans propose to vppo&e
the scheme, while at the ame time
furnishing rtlief in other and Letter
directions. The sugar and tobatt-o
taxes should go bef ore the home mar
ket is thrown open to foreigu manu

Blaine on the Message.
A New York Tribune reporter in
terviewed 31 r. P.laine iu Paris on the
th instant, who said: "1 have been
reading au abstract of the president
message and am especially interested
in the comments of the London pa
ners. Those naners all assume to
, , - i i.
! declare the message a free-trade nian
I ifesto, evidently anticipating an en
larged market for Knglish fabrics in
the I'nited States as a consequence
of the president's recommendations
Perhaps that fact stariiped the char
acter of the message more clearly
than any words of mine can. This
is the first time within the history of
the United States the president rec
ommends retaining the internal tax
that the tariff mav be forced down
even below a fair revenue standard
lie recommends that the tax ou to
bacco be retained. Thus many mil
lions will annually be levied on thij
domestic product which might far
better come from the tariff on foreign
fabrics. I should urge the repeal of
the tobacco tax at once, even Defore
the Christmas holidays. It would
bring great relief to the growers of to
bacco all over the country and world ;
moreover, it would materially lessen
the price of the article to the consum
ers. Tobacco to millions is a neces
sity. The president calls it a luxu
rv. It is such a luxury as tea and
coffee. Watch the men on the farm,
in the iron foundry, in any calling;
you will find ninety-five in every hun
dred using it. After each meal the
ame proportion seek the solace of
the pipe or cigar. These men pay
the millions of the tobacco tax, pay
on every plug of tobacco or cigar an
enhanced price which the tax enables
the manufacturer and retailer to im
pose.
Whiskev would be everywhere dis
tilled if the surveillance of the gov
ernment was withdrawn by the re
mission of the tax. Whiskey has
done a vast deal of harm, and I would
try to make it do some good. I
would use the tax to fortify the cities
on the sea-board. In view of the
powerful letter addressed to the dem
ocratic party by the late Samuel J.
Tilden in 1S.", I am amazed that no
attention has been paid to the subject
by the democratic administration.
Never before in the history of the
world has any government allowed
its great cities on the sea-board to
remain defenceless ; and after forti
fications are constructed I would still
maintain the tax on whiskey, and
when the national government had
no use for the money would divide
the tax among th federal Union
with the specific object of lightening
the tax on real estate, houses and
firms. The whole country pays too
large a proportion of the total taxes.
If ultimately relief could not be giv
en in that direction, it would, in my
judgment, be a wise and beneficial
policy.
Some honest aud misguided friends
of temperance have urged that the
government should not use the money
derived from the tax on whiskey. My
reply is that the tax on whiskey, with
suppression of all illicit distillation
and with the consequent enhance
ment of the price, has been a power
ful agent in temperance reform by
putting it beyond the reach of so
many.
I should seriously object to the re
peal of the duty on wool, as it would
work great injustice to many inter
ests. The question of labor under
lies the whole subject. It is, in fact,
the entire question. Whenever we
can force artisans in every depart
ment to work cheaply and live as
pooily in the United States as simi
lar workmen in Europe, we can, of
course, manufacture just as cheaply
as they do, but I am totally opposed
to the policy it would entail. To at
tempt it is equivalent to a social and
financial revolution that would bring
untold distress.
The moment you begin to import
freely from Europe yon drive your
own workmen from mechanical and
manufacturing pursuits. In the same
proportion they become tillers of the
soil, increasing steadily the agricul
tural product and decreasing steadily
the large home demand which is con
stantly enlarging as honie manufac
tures enlarge. That, of course, works
great injury to the farmer, glutting
the market with his products and
tending constantly to lower prices.
I do not mean to imply there should
be no reduction of the national sur
plus. 1 would reduce it by the prompt
repeal of the tobacco tax ; make some
changes in tariff ; not reduce protec
tion, but wisely foster it. No great
system of revenue like our tariff can
operate with efficiency and equity un
less the changes of the trade he close
ly watched and the law promptly
adapted to the changes. In the -act
of l s- we made changes of the char
acter I have tried to indicate. If
such changes are made and the forti
fying and sea-coast thus undertaken,
at very moderate annual outlay, no
surplus will be found after that al
ready accumulated is disposed of
The president's recommendation to
admit raw material will not find a
strong support by wise protectionists.
It is vastly more important not to
lose our own great market for our
own people in the vain effort to reach
the impossible. It is not our foreign
trade that has caused the wonderful
growth aud expansion of the repub
lic. It is the vast domestic trade be
tween thirty-eight states and eight
territories, with their population of
terhaps 62,CW,0o0 to-day. The
whole amount of our export and im-
port trade together has never, I think,
reached I,y,C-w,uo0 any one year.
Our internal home trade oa J3',0A
miles of railway, aloug l-,iju miles
of ocean coast, over the five great
lakes and along 20,W0 miles of nav
igable rivers, reaches the enormous
f annual aggregate of more than $iJ,-
nitude not dreamed of twenty years
ago, that the Europeans are strug
gling to enter. It is the heritage of
the American people, of their chil
dren and of their children's children.
It gives an absolutely free trade over
a territory nearly as large as all Eu
rope, and the profit is all our own.
The-genuine free-trader appears un
able to see or comprehend that this
continental trade not our exchanges
with Europe is the great source of
our prosperity. President Cleveland
now plainly proposes a policy that
will; admit Europe to a share of this
trade.
The president's message will bring
the country where it ought to be
brought to a full and fair contest
on the question of protection. The
president himself makes it the one is
sue by presenting no other. I think
it well to have the quesiion settled
while the democratic party is iu pow
er. It is a standing menace to the
industrial prosperity of the country.
Nothing is so mischievous to busi
ness as'uncertainty, nothing so para
lvzing as doubt."
WASHINGTOH LETTER.
SPBClAI-CORRBSPOXDEJiCE OF THE dOSITOR.
Washing con, Dec. 12th.
In the political world the bold
message of the president is the chief
topic of discussion, and while there
are diverse opinions concerning its
expediency and practicability, men
of all parties willingly concede Mr.
Cleveland the courage of his convic
tions something really refreshing in
a candidate for the presidency, be
cause so rarelv seen. jiany ions-
headed politicians express the belief
that the president's course on the only
real vital issue of the day, will cause
new alignment of parties in the
next presidential struggle, and ou
the most exciting contests in the his
tory of the country. Mr. Blaine's
swift criticism of the message is
practically regarded as a declaration
of his own candidacy for the presi-
ienev as the champion of the protec
tion principle. It is thought here
that the calliug of the national repub-
ican convention at Chicago was due
to the Blaine influence, and that it
foreshadows his re-nomination.
Congress was organized quietly, and
in a manner becoming the dignity of
that bodv on its centennial annivers
ary, despite the bloodshed in the dem
ocratic caucus and the anticipations
of a dead-lock in the senate, the only
interruption being from a religious
enthusiast, who, at the moment of
most intense silence in the house,
chanted the doxology in a plaintive
solo, greatly to the amusement of
fully oOOO spectators ; the poor man
was cared for by the police, but he
succeeded in favoring the president
with the same tune at his reception.
As usual on such occasions, many of
the desks were burdened with beau
tiful floral favors, the gifts of admir
ing frieuds.
Only brief sessions of congress
were held the past week, as the com
mittees have not yet been formed :
Speaker Carlisle says that he hopes
to be able to announce the house
committees before the holiday recess ;
but he lias a very difficult task before
him, for there are about 125 new
members to place. It is a remarka
ble fact that two-thirds of the chair-
mee of the house committees of the
last congress were decapitated by
their constituents. A plausible rea
son for these changes is that the im
portunate congressmen, m dividing
the spoils, did not have enough offic
es to distribute ; and many familiar
faces are missing from the places that
will know them no more forever.
The only committee yet appointed
in either house or senate is the com
mittee on mileage of the house, which,
as far as circumstances would permit,
is the same as formerly, and this is
rather an indication that, as far as
practicable, the speaker means to re
appoint the same old committees.
The bitterness engendered among
the democrats over the doorkeeper
ship fight has brought to light allega
tions that both Donelson and Wimer
mith, late incumbents of that office,
are defaulters, and it is whispered
about the capitol corridors that the
republicans will introduce -a resolu
tion for the appointment of a com
mittee to investigate the accounts of
these officials.
It is believed that the nominations
of Lamar for associate justice of the
supreme court, Vilas for secretary of
the interior, and Dickinson for post
mastei general, will be confirmed
without difficulty by the senate.
The Evangelical Alliance of the
United States, embracing 2000 dele
gates, and numbering among its mem
bership many of the most eminent di
vines of the country, held its session
in the capital the past week, and the
occasion was a season of glorious
spiritual edification to thousands of
Christian believers whose privilege it
was to attend these meetings.-
One of the most pdeasant events of
the meeting of the alliance was the
president's reception of the organiza
tion in a body, the members being
personally introduced to the chief ex
ecutive by Wni. E. Dodge. When it i
came the turn of the Rev; Dr. Burch
ard, who made the famous allitera
tive allusion in references to rum.
Romanism and rebellion, in the last
presidential campaign, a general j
smile went around, aud it was especi- j
allv bright on the faces of Mr. and
3Ir
s. Cleveland, both of whom ex- j
ded a very cordial greeting to the
tended
noted divine, who also appeared to
share fullv the spirit of the situation..

When Senator Edmunds stood at
the bar of the United States Senate
on Monday last, to take the oath of
office, he did so for the sixth time
He took it first ou the 4th of March
lNiiG, when he held the office by the
appointment ofGov. Dillingham. He
took it next on the 4th of March
1SG7, having been elected by the leg
islature to fill out the unexpired term
of Senator Foot. He took it again
after each of his four successive elec
lions to tne tun term. iy tne way,
the remark printed in the New York
T-ibuite, the other day, that Mr. Ed
munds was not a United States sena
tor because he had not been sworn in
since his last election, was not quite
correct. A man begins to be a Unit
ed States senator from the day of the
commencement of his term and is en
titled to draw his pay as such. Mr
Edmunds' present term commenced
ou the 4th of March last ; and there
has been no intermission in his teiv
ure of the office for the last twentv-
oue vears.

was a graduate of West Point in the

the war of the rebellion broke out.
He was appointed brigadier-genera

of brigadier-general July 1, 1A,6
Gen. Emroy was a noble gentleman,
and a soldier possessed of the high
est sense of honor and duty aud true
in every respect to the best standards
of his profession.
Senator Edmunds answers a host
of free-trade sophistries, including
the crude re-hash of stale theories in
President Cleveland's message, when
he says : "You remember that the
tax on tea aud coffee was taken off
some years ago, aud what was the
result? The income from these prod
ucts was withdrawn from the treasu
ry, but the prices of tea and coffee
remained as high as ever. The im
porters made the extra profit, and we
lost the taxes." The notion that the
removal of the tariff duties inevita
bly results in gain to the consumer is
one of the most glaring of hoarv-
ueaueu liee-iraue lunacies. it nas
been exposed again and again, and it
is simply astounding that the chief
magistrate of this great nation should
re- assert it without qualification.
Senator Morrill on Monday intro
duced a bill to regulate immigration,
requiring American consuls on appli
cation to inquire about and certify to
the moral character and ability' to
earn support of intending immigrants.
It levies a duty of -$2 a head on for
eigners not having a certificate, and
requires a transportation under pen
alty to return immigrants not found
to be fit to become citizens. For
eigners coming temporarily for pleas
ure or business are exempt from the
provisions of the act. There ought
to be general acquiescence in a meas
ure of this scope.
