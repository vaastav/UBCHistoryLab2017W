AUSTIN, MINN., DECEMBER 9,186!).
"J. is an unpleasant fact thai nearly
all classes of men, with perhaps the
single exception of dealers in money,
are to-day unable to meet (heir indebt
0 Ineaa. We speak now, more especial
ly with reference to Minnesota, though
the same remark is true of most other
new Western States. The common ex
planation of this undesirable condition
of things is that the product* of the
State being
at a low price in market, while
articles of importation required for
lomc consumption are extremely high.
.ct us accept this theory, which is un
doubtedly correct. The staple product
ni'the State is wheat. To-dav, the far
utcr goes to market with a load of this
commodity and receives therefore the
sum of sixty cents per bushel. He
takes his money and goes to the mer
chant to buy clothing and groceries
l'ir his family, and pays for them near
1 or quite as high a prioe as was de
manded when wheat was worth one
dollar per bushel. The machinery
with which he tills the soil and gathers
his harvest costs as much now as when
wheat brought double the present price.
The causes which keep merchandise up
to the present standard and operate so
unjustly towarus iiid JfwuTlcing clss?
are found in the financial problems
that now agitate the country, and are
consequently beyond the control of our
home merchants. Eveu if they could
get their pay, the traders of Minnesota
are deriving very little more profit
from their business now, than when
wheat was worth a dollar and twenty
five cents per bushel. Hundreds of
merchants in all parts of the State are
insolvent, and many are going into
bankruptcy. They claim that this is
because the farmers will not pay them.
Now, here are two prominent facts,
I^oth of which are of sufficient impor
tance to command attention, first the
producing classes of the State are at the
mercy of traders, and second, mer
chants are crippled in their business in
consequenae of the failure of customers
to pay their debits.
How to avert such calamities in the
future is the problem of the hour.
The present unfortunate condition of
the fanning population of 3Iinnesota is
the certain and inevitable result of re
lying upon a single product. In this
instance the product is wheat, it might
be something else with the same results.
Pork, beef, butter, and cheese, and
young stock, all command a good price,
and how many farmers mourn that
tbey have not now these products to
sell. But the fault is their own, and
this experience, ought to be sufficient
to teach them to devote henceforth, at
least, half their money and time to
stock raising.
Again, the vast expenditure for ma
chinery that is now impoverishing so
many farmers should be reduced at
lea9t one half. The extravagant pur
chase and profligate use of reapers, see
ders. mowers &c., is absolutely astonish
ing. This farm machine business has
become a mania, aud will ruin the
country unless checked. There is hard
ly a better grass growing region in the
west, than southern Minnesota, and the
sooner the people turn their attention to
this branch of industry, the sooner
will they relieve themselves from the
embarrassed condition they are in to-day.
Wheat is good, but like anything else,
to much or it will make a man poor
Merchants, as well as farmejs, are also
in trouble, and the fault is partly their
own
Since the war a large number pf
young men, with a few hundred dollars
and no business capacity or experience,
have set themselves up as merchants.
Tne west, always offering an ample field
for enterprise, has become crowded with
this class of traders, all anxious to dis
pose of their wares. Competition has
been active and the demand for credit
has been great, which,, they have not
been slow to gratify. Consequently a
majority of these unexperienced trades
men find themselves to-dfay embarrassed
beyond hope of recovery. The goods
they bought on time w* Wt Pa"l ^or
their customers have BO money, aud
bankruptcy stares them in the face.
These evils may be avoided in fu
ture. At least one-third of those who
call themselves merchants should buy
a peico of prairie, go to work and help
strengthen the productive forces of the
country. The balance should sell only
for cash,cxccpt to a few who are known
to bo prompt and honest.
It is proverbial that a Western man
will buy anything lie can get trusted
for, whether he needs it or not, but
the pay day is too frequently forgotten.
The credit system is the father of dis
honesty and ruins both parties, those
who trust and those who get trusted
The experience of these dark days
oughtAo
be worth something. The ca
lamities of the past ought to be a warn-,
ing for the future. Minnesota needs
to-day fewer merchants and wiser farm
ers. The raising of herds, to consume
tho herbage of our vast pasture. lands,
must take the place, in part .at least,
of wheat growing before our agricul
tural communities will be relieved from
their hardens of dabt.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The first annual message by Presi
dent Grant was sent to Congress on
Monday. It is much more lengthy
than we had anticipated, but its length
is dne to the multitude of topics on
which it ranges. Upon these topics
the views of the administration has
been looked for with intense interest.
On the Financial question, the Presi
dent gives very satisfactory ideas, which
will generally be endorsed by the Re
publicans, and which has been awaited
with deep anxiety. He considers the
irredeemable currency an evil growing
out of the war, which should command
the early attention of Congress, and
that a part, and one of the highest du
ties of the government is to secure to
the citizens a medium of exchange of
fixed unvarying value, and that immedi
ate resumption, if practicable, would
not be desirable that it would compel
the debtor class to pay beyond their
contracts the premium of gold at the
date of their purchases and would bring
bankruptcy and ruin to thousands. He
earnestly recommends such legislation
as will insure a gradual return to specie
payments, and put an immediate stop
to fluctuations inthe value of currency
to secure which, the treasury to redeem
its own paper at a fixed price whenever
presented and to withhold from circu
lation all such currency redeemed until
sold for gold.
He puggests that-the Governor of
Georgia be empowered to convene the
old Legislature requiring each- mem
ber to take the oath, who are eligible
under the third clause of the 14th amend
ment.
He takes a bold and high tone towards
England regarding the Alabama Claims
and opposes a reciprocity with Canada
and recommends a neutral attitude to
wards Cuba.
Our foreign relations are generally
in a very satisfactory condition.
A synopsis of the reports of the va
rious Departments of the goverment is
given, exhibiting a healthy condition
of their transactions, during the past
year.
On the whole, the message is a good
one, and will command the praise of all
good men. It is fair, candid and coin
Lj eise, treating the various matters with
commendable sagacity, and casts into
shades all doubts as to the poliey which
the administration designed pursuing,
Of this message we shall speak again
mora at length.-- W»
ntg« our-reader*
to carefully read it and ponder on its
many suggestions and see if does not
campare favorably with their own views.
Wo shall lay it before our readers
either in supplement or in next week's
issue.
The luconae iaw.
The law imposing the Income Tax,
expires during the coming year by its
own limitation, and it will bo removed,
unless Congress shall renew it. There
are mauy advocates for Exemption of
incomes, but we are not yet prepared
for it. Our National debt is still
heavy, and though it has been decreas
ed at a rapid rate, unprecedented in the
history of Nations, yet the improve
ment in our crcdit is not sufficient to
invite undue liberality when we get
our debt into consuls, bearing a lower
rate of kterest, we may begiu to let up
a little, Only through this law do we
reach the wealthy bondholders, who
have put their capital into bonds, which
are not taxable, either by the State or
Nation. As a political measure the
Republican party must not assume,
the responsibility of exempting from
taxation the wealthy men who draw
large incomes from coupons, iuterest
"and rents. It is enough that we
have to contend against repudiation
ists and those who complain because
bonds are not taxed, without adding
',l jtfiother privileged class. Such bond*
holders are taxed on their net an
nual income, and in that way help to
support the government. It will not
do to tax the income ofthe enterpris
ing manufacturer who puts his mon
ey in works which sustain a large
population conferring thereby immense
benefits on the community at large,
and then exempt the crafty capitalist
who seeks the safest and least expen
sive investments that can be found.
"The bond owner has exemption
enough—we are willing to abide by
«the, contract we made with him to
thc{ utmost of the letter and spirit
thereof —but no more. At present
ouly lefc tho tax on the'poor man's tea,
eofiee and sugar be taken off—but let
the wealthy render to the govern
ment,the tribute due to it for the
fidelity with which their interests
have been always guarded.
It is said our people are uncommonly
sensitive about officials prying into
their private affairs. There is force in
the objection but they have been taught
by the events of the late war to snbdue
their extreme sensibility. It WJS some
time before we quietly submitted to
direct taxes, but we* have., come to it
«n.d
BPW
consider- it t'ne best adapted
mode to our necessities. We are not
prepared to djjgpens? with tho income
tax. It meets our present necessity.
Our chief concern is to pay thft. debt,
improve the public credit, until. thei
payment of interest is reduced, and
then talk about exemption to those
who consider themselves oppressed..
