Cotton Report Encouraging.
The report of the Oklahoma state
board of agriculture shows that there
have been ginned nearly 100,000 more
bales of cotton than at corresponding
date In 1910, and the present ginning
is running within 68,000 bales of the
amount ginned last year, at this time.
This will be a matter of news to the
general public Inasmuch as tbe ran
dom reports coming in were to the
effect that cotton was little good in
the state this year and that the great
er part of it was picked during tbe
first picking In early September.
Hennessey's Statement.
Commenting on the situation as
shown by the monthly crop report,
Ben Hennessey, secretary of the state
board ot agriculture, said:
"The government reports will sub
stantiate the above statement regard
ing the amount ginned up to this time
and, with the Increase In price, more
money will come Into the state for
this product than did last year.
Regarding the Increased acreage of
wheat In the state for next year's
crop, one report from one of the lead
ing wheat counties was to the effect
that the increase was 1,000 per cent
over last year, in another 2,000 per
cent and this reported specifically that
where there was one acre laBt year
there was twenty sowed for the next
year's crop.
"Personal Investigation shows that
there are few stubbles burned, but
Instead turned under to enrich the
soil. . A number of our best farmers
are using listers to turn the stubble
under immediately after harvest.
throwing back the ridges with another
listing Just before seeding time.
'This furnishes a partly decayed
mulch right at the surface of the soil
where the wheat plant roots can take
the immediate advantage ot its extra
plant food. This gives a surface ad
vantage which the plowing under does
not furnish, and Is largely responsible
for the splendid conditions found to
day In the wheat pastures of our dis-
tricts where this method has become
popular,
"The burning of straw piles Is al
most obsolete and slack times ot win
ter are utilized In scattering this straw
over the sandy spots of the wheat
fields. While I believe that the straw
should all be returned to the land
there is some doubt as to whether or
not this Is the proper procedure. The
reasons for this doubt cannot be dis
cussed In thl sartlcle.
"In mv iudement ereater strides
have been made In the proper culti
ration of wheat and cotton than any
other crops raised In Oklahoma,
Below Is given the conditions as
furnished by our crop correspondents:

Still Making Immigration Bureau Plan.
A movement to make It possible for
the state to maintain an immigration
bureau is to be launched again, and a
measure is to be initiated repealing
Section 48 of Article 5 of the consti
tution which prohibits the state going
intorfhe immigration business. In the
constitutional provision the legislature
has no power to "appropriate any of
the public money for the establish
ment and maintenance ot a bureau of
Immigration.
J. A. Qulnn of Pryor is behind the
movement for the repeal of the con
stitution provision, and in a letter to
Governor Cruce wished to have the
governor's views about the matter.
Governor Cruce said that he did not
know the details of the plan by which
it is proposed to Induce immigration
Into Oklahoma, but that he would fa
vor any legitimate and honest method
by which people could be Induced to
come to Oklahoma and help develop
the state to the advantage ot both they
and the state.
Several months ago 'a movement
was started to establish an immigra
tion bureau, but no Bupport was ex
pected from the state because of the
constitutional provision. Some oppo
sition was made because it was un
derstood that certain methods might
be employed that had proven unsuc
cessful In previous ventures. It was
thought, too, that as the state would
receive a great benefit from a suc
cessful campaign to bring people into
it, some help should be received from
the state. The matter was dropped,
however, for the time being.
Mr. Quinn Is at the head of a com
mittee now working on the matter of
Initiating the measure to repeal or
modify the constitutional section pro
hibiting the state from helping In the
Immigration work, and expects to be
ready soon, to start a campaign of
education on the subject.
Furman Affirms Death Sentence.
An Indirect attack on the policy of
Governor Cruce, with reference to
commuting death sentences. Is made
by Judge Henry M. Furman of the
criminal court of appeals In an opinion
handed down affirming the conviction
of Newton Henry, a negro, In the su
perlor court of Oklahoma county.
Henry has been sentenced to death
and In affirming' the conviction and
sentence Judge Furman sayB: "As a
great misapprehension exists as to the
right to commute the death penalty,
and as this apprehension has done In
finite, harm to the administration of
law In Oklahoma, and as this is
death penalty case, It Is Imperatively
necessary for this court, which alone
has the right to finally construe the
law and the constitution in criminal
cases, to declare the true meaning of
the right to commute the sentence of
the courts. We will not discusB the
wisdom and Justice of capital pimlnh
ment. This Ib a question for the people
or the legislature alone. The supreme
question Is. shall the laws bo en

First Land Tax Payment.
The first payment of the graduated
land tax was received at the ofllce
of State Auditor J. C. McClelland. J
L. Bullen of El Reno reported that he
had 240 ncreB' above the exemption
and that it had been assessed at 13,400,
Under the provision of the law he was
required to pay $3.40. John A. Hansen
of Perry, was the second to remit, he

7-! I companion suits Instituted In district
I court of Oklohoma county by the Man
j gum Electric Light Company and by
the Duncan Electric Light and Ice

Iff of each county wherein the plants
! are located be permanently enjoined
'7 j from attempting to collet the tax
I which petitions allege contravene both
I the state and federal constitutions.
Biggest Charter Fee.
The biggest charter fee paid the
secretary of state for some time, in
the Incorporation of a company, was
that of the Cosden Oil Company of
Tulsa. The company 19 composed of
J. S. Cosden and E. R. Perry of Tulsa
and A. W. Gleske of Baltimore. The
capital stock of the resident concern
Is given at $1,200,000 and tho charter

BETTER IHAN HASTE
Slow Congressional Deliberation
Proper.
Under Autocratic Rule of Former Re
publican Speakers Important
Measures Had Not the Proper
Consideration Necessary.
Certainly no one can accuse the
Democratic congress of being head
long in legislation. The Underwood
Simmons tariff bill had been under
consideration In committee for months
before it was submitted to the house,
and after Its passage there the leisure
ly senate debated It for Just four
months before taking favorable action.
Several weeks in conference followed
before it reached the president
The currency bill seems to be follow
ing much the same procedure. Though.
President Wilson had hoped to have it,
disposed of in the special session, it is
now predicted that serious debate up
on It can hardly begin before Decem
ber 8, and that probably two months
more will be required for discussion.
It seems not unlikely that spring will
roll around before final action Is taken.
In all probability the anti-trust legist
latlon which It is proposed to enact
will follow the same program.
It all seems provoklngly slow, but it
may well be believed that the cautious
methods followed by senators and rep
resentatives are the best for both the
country and the dominant party. It
was always brought up against Speak
er Thomas B. Reed, who Introduced
the autocratic rules that led to the re
volt against Cannon, that he boasted
that under his regime the house had
ceased to be a deliberative body. That
cannot be said of the present congress.
Waat Indorses Administration.
"Out In the western country the
people are approving President Wil
son's administration," remarked A. C.
Mllnor of Chicago at the Willard. Mr.
Mllner was one of the developers of
Irrigation projects In the western
country and Is a Btrong supporter ot
the administration.
"The national banks," continued Mr,
Mllner, "are a unit against the pro
posed currency measure, but the state
banks are not opposed to currency
legislation. There Is a general lm
presBlon that the president Is going to
force through his program of legisla
tion and that a currency law will be
written on the statute books before
the present session of congress is end
ed. The national banks lire opposing
governmental control, of course. I did
not find that the people were greatly
Interested In politics. They appear to
have accepted the tariff revision with,
tho utmost equanimity, and are ready
for any other legislation." Washing

When a Tradition Disappears.
The belle has been assiduously cul
tivated In this country that protection
ism Is essential to Its prosperity. This
theory became a tradition with a gen
eration that did not know that the
most rapid Industrial development In
the nation's history came before the
war In an era of low tariff.
Millions of persons have become Im
bued with the belief that a reduction
In tariff means business distress and
hard times. With a multitude of poli
ticians this tradition hns become their
stock in trade and their chief political
asset. i
What Ib going to happen to these
men when business Increases under
the stimulation of the Wilson tariff
law Instead of going to pieces? How
are they going to explain? What will
become of their old battle cries?
The outcome Is likely to be a serious
Impairment of political credits such
an impairment that large numbers of
politicians are likely to go Into polit
ical bankruptcy. J
Higher Plane of Debate. ,
In times past the tariff In congress
has attracted many men whose knowl
edge of the subject was scant. In tho
debates they used the patter of tha
stump. They marshaled catch phrases,
and poured them out In profusion. The
rich were getting richer and the poor
poorer. Robber barons were hogging
everything. Give the poor man at
chnnce. And so on.
Such deliverances were principally
assertion and came from men without
practical knowledge of business of any
kind. They were particularly unfa
miliar with big business and could not
have found their way around unassist
ed In a manufacturing plant.
By pitching the recent debate on a
higher plane, both Republicans and
Democrats served their parties and
their policies. t
Mr. Underwood's Position.
Mr. Underwood has never appeared
to be anything like the type of radical
free trader that wants to hack away
every duty, whether or not, as the Re
publicans claimed. His general course
In congress has Indicated that he has
never desired to exterminate or evea
weaken American Industries.
The President's Duties.
The people' chose Woodrow Wilson,
as tbelr president and voted the Demo
crats Into power because they wished!
certain policies carried out Few of
the Democrats who supported their
party In the recent campaign care any
thing whatever about the offices. What
they wish Is to see their party and Its
president make a record that shall
commend itself to the people. That Is
all they ask. The country as a whole
Is deeply interested In the work that
Is to be done.
