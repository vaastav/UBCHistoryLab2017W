The prohibitionists of the South t
Atlantic States are apt to spread r
broadcast the joyful news that
Lynchburg, Va-.'the last city be- a
tween Washington and Atlanta fc
to retain saloons, has just gone s
"dry." |v
No more personal solicitation ^
of liquor orders by agents in ^
South Carolina, The supreme
court has just, handed down a
decision holding that it is not a
necessary that the purchase c
price of the liquor be paid when j
the order is given, but that "the 0
purchase is completed when the 0
order is sent in. No appeal is s
apt to be taken from this decision, s
but we venture the assertion ^
fc lat if the matter were carried q
to the supreme court of the ,
United States that the South c
Carolina court would see its' t
decision reveled. . a
The neWs dispatches from r\
Washington a few days ago car- %
Tied an item that should be of J;
universal interest throughout the $
I o :th. It states that a company, t
capitalized at $500,000 has been a
organized in Atlanta to manu- p
facture paper from cotton stalks. [ t
If the report is true, this will \
m an a large annual revenue to r]
the cotton i J inters from a here- t
tofore useless by-product of the y
South's chief staple, and whilejv
Jc is not anticipated that the ?
atalks will prove as valuable as a
t le cotton seed, it is encouraging 1
t > recall that 25 years ago the ! t
\ itter was considered useless ex- a
pept as fertilizer and cattle food. ;
The active ^ar which is being
p ale in aii sections of the country
against tuberculosis supports
the contention in these columns
Jast week that there is no place
>11 South Carolina for the proposed
national sanitarium for
consumptives. The fe.ir in which
the consumi fve patient is now
held Is strikingly illustrated in a
proclamation of quarantine issued i
some days ago by the governor
of Texas. The quarantine
/declares against all persons afflicted
with contagious or infecr j
tious diseases, and requires that'
. they shall not be admitted to the 1
Rotate. Tuberculosis is not spe-1
pificajly rpentioned as one of the
disposes designated for detention,
but jt is the accepted belief in
and out of Texas that it is included
in the general term of
contagious and infectious diseases.
!c
It is a beautiful thing for breth- j
ren to dwell together in harmony,
pnd a littb thing like the dilTer- !
ence in principle which actuates .
one man to be a Democrat and
another ? Republican is too small
a consideration to affect the .
j
mutual admiration of such fast ^
friends as Governor Ansel and
Q
A. C. Kaufman, he of negroelectoral
ticket fame. The cs,
teem in which these patriots hold
each other is indeed a thing of ^
beauty and a joy forever, and
no more touching scene can be j ^
imagined than the fond embrace ^
i:i which they have recently been !
lacked, each boo-hcoing on the
other's brisket, with the result 1 ^
that Ansel appoints Kaufman a .
3outh Carolina delegate to the
National Rivers and Harbors Cor- j
gress and Kaufman, pleased to ^
l e governed by the adfhonition ^
rf the old saw, 'Tickle me, c
Davy, tickle me true, when my;k
^nm a/v?\ao I'll * *?1 -1 ? -* 11 ^
^ui ii vuiuci? i ii ucivit you too, ^
in turn appoints Ansel a delegate
to the national meeting of the j
Red Cross Society. It is all
very beautiful, and likewise all ^
very nauseating.
i
There is indeed always some- L
thing to thank Heaven for. The 1
t latest universal blessing is found a
in the fact that the iast regular ^
message wjth which President ^
Roosevelt will burden the coun- ^
try was sent to Congress Mon- *
day. Of course the message 1
contains nothing new, for Roose-1
velt told all he knows long, long C

11 his state "papers breathe is j
ittlo styort of disgusting, and!
ve hope that the good Lord will 1
emove us to a better world be- .
ore the country is again afiiicted 1
vith his like. Disassociating the J
nan from the great office lie has :
o unworthily filled for the last
even years, we recognize in him \
he supreme faker of the unirerse,
a man who does not hesi
ate to stoop to mean practices
o accomplish his ends, and one i
vhose unsupported word we j
vould hesitate to believe. And s
his is the man who has for so I
nany years preached early and 1
ate of morality and right living, ,
,nd tens of thousands of people,
eipg ipiable to think for them- I
elves, have heeded his every '
vord, taking him for what he
iught to be, and followed his <
ead to the brink of the country's j
induing.
A correspondent of The State i
sks if there is no way to stop or
heck the lawlessness which he
>ictures as hanging over the (
ommonwealth like an angry, j
iminous cloud. Then he finds a j
olution for the question that is i
0 painfully harassing his soul I
>.v suggesting that the day of ^
leiverancc surely will have ar- r
ived if the legislature can he in- <
luced to pass a law reqi i.ing '
hat parents and guardians send 1
ill children between the ages 01
1 and 18 years to Sunday seho >1. ,
?he thought of any hardship:
vhich the enactment of such a 1
aw might entail is immediately J
lispelled by the magnanimity of
he correspondent in agreeing to
l provision allowing the parent or *
guardian the liberty of choosing <
he denomination of the school to (
vhieh the child shall be sent, j
rhe correspondent is certain that j
he passage of such a law would :
irove a panacea for every iil :
\ith which the State is afflicted. '
>uch a proposition is, of course,
ibsurd, and the only reason we i
lave for noting it is to direct atention
to the immeasurable
imount of harm which is done 1
he State by its own citizens |
idding the commonwealth up <
or the gaze of the worid as a <
immunity in which red-handed (
nurder and every other crime in
he decalogue stalk abroad. The
ights of life and property are
ibout as secure in South Caro- i
ina as in any other State, and
ve deplore the senselessness of i
hose who are forever and eterlally
advertising our people us so
nany savages who neither fear
he God who Inade them nor re- '
ipect the rights of their fellownan.
There is no gainsaying the fact
hat there is widespread lack of
confidence in the sincerity of
^resident Roosevelt. He is, so
'ar as our information goes, the j
inly man who has ever filled the (
greatest office in the land against
vhom the charge of lack of any
>ersonal obligation m respect to '
ruth has been brought?not
ince, but a thousand times. The '
atest illustration of the presilent's
deficiency in sincerity and
consistency is strikingly shown
a a letter which he made nublic
Junday night, touching an incilent
of the recent campaign, and <
n the message which he sent to
Congress Monday. During the
campaign it was charged and
lot disproved?that the presi- ;
lent's brother-in-law had been
nixed up in a crooked deal in ;
he purchase of the Panama (
anal rights by this government
io:n the French government. ;
The president denies the charge,
ind in replying to an editorial 1
i the Indianapolis News, edited
>y Mr. ^Delavan Smith, says:
'Mr.Delavan Smith and the other c
>eople who repeated this false- 1
lood lied about the president's !
>rother-in-law." Nice language |
or the president of the United ,
States to use! Now let us see !
vhat he says in his message a (
lay or two ago about the con- !
ideration which should uniform- ,
v govern the conduct of one ,
gentleman toward another: "The
luty of respectful and truthful
omment and criticism should he 1
tinding when we speak of any- |
tody." This is consistency with j
, whoop. The president, it is to ,
e hoped, will some day take ar. ]
lour olf to remove the sawlogs <
rom his own eyes before he atempts
to discover the note in his
ellow-man's. <

which occurred Thursday after- I

are studying the facts and i
igures of the tables, noting i
imong other things that there <
will be four eclipses .next ye u\ I

:ween the sun and the mo >n. 1
Three of the numb r, total eclipse t
af the sun, a total eclipse of ti.e c
no or., another eciiose of th.o c
rnoon, will not be visible in ?;
this place, while the fourths a t
partial eclipse of the sun, will c
not be visible in this o untry. t
A total eclipse of the sun, P
which will occur on Jun > 17. will c
ae visible to the United States, r
with tne exception of a small I
part of the Pacific coast States. I.
A total eclipse of the moon is <;
scheduled for November 2d and ?
11, which will be in the nature i
af a Thanksgiving offering. ;
A partial eclipse of the sun. f

The Necessity cf Quarantining Cattle.
In the twelve northwestern J
counties of this State which are Js
now protected from tick infested %
areas of this and other states by ^
State and Federal Regulations, ^
cattle inspectors have been at g;
work since July 1, making a *
farm to farm canvas and examini- >
i.ii ; cattle. These men have ! 0!
placed In quarantine all tick in-jG
fested premises, in order to pre- ?
vent the spread of the cattle tick 5
which causes Texas or Tick 5
Fever. VV1 i'e a few infested **
farms in these counties may
have been overlooked, the ma- ^
jority of tick infested premises
m V ./vv^il ll?IU II1C I'UlUt" Ki
quarantined. Jrj
This quarantine of infested >
cat11 o causes some inconvenience vi
lo the cattle owners, but it is ^
absolutely necessary for the: e {?
premises to be quarantined if S
they are to be freed from ticks >
and these counties released from y
the Federal restiictions which k!
now prevent the growth of our ?
live stock industry. Unless this &
quarantine were established and
erifi reed, it would be impossible 5"
to eradicate the ticks, and remo\ e ^
the Federal Regulation, as move- Q;
me':t of tick infested cat vie {?
would spread infestation to free ft
fv'.rms, and cause not only an en- jc
large*I infested area, but also
serious loss among the cattle ^
within this district. v
In placing these cattle in
quarantine, State authorities en- o,
itcason. i to cause cattle owners
as little inconvenience as poss:i?ie,
but the enforcement ot the It
quarantine is absolutely neces- C;
s:?.ry, and therefore quarantined ?
L* .tile can only be moved aft r ?
they have been examined and ?=
found free from ticks by an >
authorized inspector, and a
written permit given for their ^
release Inspectors are stationed ^
in each county, and should an (Z
owner of quarantined cattle de- <
sire to move or dispose of any of
these animals, he can a] ply to Qj
that inspector and obtain neces- (t
sary permit, provided his cattle ?
are lrom ticks. Cattle owners
will tind the State authorities !c
willing and ready to grant every y
request as long as mis can be 0:
done without danger of spread- ?
ing ticks to tick free farms. ft
These officers desire to encourage ?
the breeding of cattle, and are ^
enforcing this law with that pur- ^
p >se in view. Therefore, the Gj
assistance of all citizens is expected.
?
If any person desires information
concerning tick eradication Rework
or any other phase of
stock raisinir, he can obtain
assistance and advice by ad- ?
dressing State Veterinarian at
Clernson College.

1'he habit of indulging in the /
