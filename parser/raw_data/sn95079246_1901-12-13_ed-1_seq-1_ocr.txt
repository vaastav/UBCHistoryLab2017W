Following is the first annual message
in part, of President Roosevelt to tb
Congress of the United States:
To the Senate and House of Represer
tatives:
Thc Congress assembles this year ur
der a shadow of a great calamity. O
the sixth of September, President Mi
Kinley was shot by an anarchist whil
attending the Pan-American Expos
tion at Buffalo, and died in that cit
on the fourteenth of that month.
Of the last seven efected President
he is the ehird who has been murder
ed, and the bare recital of this fact i
sufficient to justify grave alarm anion
ni! loyal Aemricans citizens. Moreovei
the circumstances of this, the third as
sassination of an American Presider!
have a peculiarly sinister significance
Both President Lincoln and Presider!
Garfield were killed by assassins o
types unfortunately not uncommon i:
history; President Lincoln falling th
victim to the terrible passions arousei
by four years of civil war, and Presi
dent Garfield to the revengeful vanit;
of a disappointed offiice-seeker. Presi
dent McKinley was killed by an utter!
depraved criminal belonging to tha
body of criminals who object to all gov
ernments, good and bad alike, who ar
against any form of popular liberty i
it is guaranteed hy even the most jus
and liberal laws, and who are as hos
tile to the upright exponent of a fre
people's sober will as to the tyrannica
and irresponsible despot.
The anarchist, and especially the an
archist in the United States, is mere!
one type of criminal, more dangerou
than any other because he represent
the same depravity in a greater degree
The man who advocates anarchy direct
ly or indirectly, in any shape or fash
ion, or thc man who apologizes for an
archists and their deeds, makes him
self morally accessory to murder befon
tlic fact.
I earnestly recommend to the Con
gress that in the exercise of its wisi
discretion it should take into consid
eration the coming to this country o
anarchists or persons professing prin
ciplei hostile to all governments and jus
tying the murder of those placed it
authority. Such individuals as thosi
who were not long ago gathered in opet
meeting to glorify the murder of Kinj
Humbert of Italy perpetrate a crime
and the law should ensure their rigor
ons punishment. They and those liki
them should be kept out of this country
and if found here they should be prompt
ly deported to the country whence thc;
came; and far-reaching provision shouh
be made for the punishment of thos
who stay. No matter calls more ur
gently for the wisest thought of th
Congress.
The Federal courts should be giver
jurisdiction over any man who kills o
attempts to Tc ill the President or an;
man who by thc Constitution or b;
laws is in linc of succession for tin
Presidency, while thc punishment foi
an unsuccessful attempt should be pro
portioned to the enormity of the of
fence against our institutions.
Abounding Prosperity.
During the last five years business
confidence has been restored, and thc
Nation is to be congratulated because
of its present abounding prosperity
Such prosperity can never be created
by law alone, although it is easy enougli
to destroy it by mischievous laws. Ii
the hand of the Lord is heavy upon
any country, if flood or drouth comes,
human wisdom is powerless to avert
the calamity. Moreover, no law can
guard us against the consequenses of
our own folly. The men who arc idle
or credulous, the men who seek gains
not by genuine work with head or hand
but by gambling in any form, are al?
ways a source of menace not only to
themselves but to others. If thc busi?
ness world loses its head, it loses what
legislation cannot supply. Fundamen?
tally the welfare of each citizen, and
therefore the welfare of thc aggregate
of citizens which makes the Nation,
must rest upon individual thrift and
energy, resolution and intelligence. Noth?
ing can take the place of this individ?
ual capacity; but wise legislation and
honest and intelligent administration
can give it thc fullest scope, thc largest
opportunity to work to good effect.
Trusts.
Thc tremendous and highly complex
industrial development which went on
with ever accelerated rapidity during
the latter half of thc nineteenth cen?
tury brings us face to face, at the be?
ginning of the twentieth, with very
serious social problems. The old laws,
and the old customs which had almost
the binding force of law, were once
quite sufficient to regulate the accumu?
lation and distribution of wealth. Since
the industrial changes which have so
enormously increased the productive
power of mankind, they are no longer
sufficient.
Thc growth of cities has gone on be?
yond comparison faster than thc growth
of thc country, aud the upbuilding
of the great industrial centers has
meant a startling increase, not merely
in the aggregate of wealth, but in the
number of very large individual, and
especially of very large corporate, for?
tunes. The creation of these great cor?
porate fortunes lias not been due to
the tariff nor to any other governmental
action, but to natural causes in the
business world, oerating in other
countries as they operate in our own.
The first essential in determining how
to deal with the great industrial combi?
nations is knowledge of the facts?pub?
licity. In the interest of the public, the
Government should have the right to in?
spect and e-ramine the workings of the
great corporations engaged in interstate
business. Publicity is thc only sure rern
edy_wbich we^njn^ftke. _What lynher
1- j remedies are needed in the way of gov?
ernmental regulation, or taxation, car
regulation, or taxation, car
only be determined after publicity ha?
been obtained, by protest of law. and it!
the course of administration. Thc first
requisite is knowledge, full and com?
plete?knowledge which niny be made
public to the world.
Artificial bodies, such as corporations
and joint stock or other associations,
depending upon any statutory law for
their existence or privileges, should be
subject to proper governmental super?
vision, and full and accurate informa?
tion as to their operations should be
made public regularly at reasonable in?
ter .ls.
The large corporations, commonly
called trusts, though organized in one
State, always do business in many
States, often doing very little business
in the State where they are incorpor?
ated. There is utter lack of uniformity
in the State laws about them; and as
no State has any exclusive interest in
or power over their acts, it has in prac?
tice proved impossible to get adequate
regulation through State action. There?
fore, in the interest of the whole peo?
ple, thc Nation should, without inter?
fering with the power of the States in
the matter itself, also assume power of
supervision and regulation over all cor?
porations doing an interstate business.
This is especially true where thc cor?
poration drives a portion of its wealth
from the existence of some monopo?
listic element or tendency in its busi?
ness. There would be no hardship in
such supervision; banks are subject to
it, and in their case it is now accepted
as a simple matter of course.
When the Constitution was adopted,
at thc end of the eighteenth century,
no human wisdom could foretell the
sweeping changes, alike in industrial
and political conditions, which were to
take place by the beginning of thc
twentieth century. At that time it was
accepted as a matter of course that thc
several States were thc proper author
ties to regulate, so far as was then
necessary, the comparatively insignifi?
cant and strictly localized corporate
bodies of the day. Thc conditions are
now wholly different and wholly differ?
ent action is called for. I believe
that a law can bc framed which will
enable the National Government to ex?
ercise control along the lines above in?
dicated ; profitable by the experience
gained through thc passage and admin?
istration of the Interstate-Commerce
Act. If, however, the judgment of thc
Congress is that it lacks the constitu?
tional power to pass such an act, then
a constitutional amendment should be
submitted to confer the power.
There should be created a Cabinet'
officer, to be known as Secretary of
Commerce and Industries, as provided
in the bill introduced at the last ses- j
sion of the Congress. It should be his
province to deal with commerce in its
broadest sense; including among many
other "things' whatever concerns labor
and all matters affecting the great
business corporations and our merchant
marine. I
The Fanner aud Wage-Worker.
With the sole exception of the farm?
ing interest, no one matter is of such
vital moment to our whole people as
the welfare of the wage-workers. If
j the farmer and the wage-worker arc
i well off, it is absolutely certain that all
j others will be well off, loo. lt is therc
| fore a matter for hearty'congratulation
I that on the whole wages are higher to
I day in the United Slates tuan ever be-!
fore in our history, and far higher than
, in any other country. The standard of i
j living is also higher than ever before.'
I Every effort of legislator and adminis?
trator should be bent to secure the
permanency of this condition of things
and its improvement wherever pos- j
sible. Not only must our labor bc pro?
tected by the' "tariff, but it should also
be protected so far as it is possible
from the presence in this country of
any laborers brought over by contract,
or of those who, coming freely, yet rep-'
resent a standard of living, so depressed
that they can undersell our men in the
labor market and drag them to a lower
level. I regard it as necessary, with
this end in view, to re-enact immedi-;
ately the law excluding Chinese labor- '
ers and to strengthen it wherever nee- j
essary in order to make its enforce-'
merit entirely effective.
Our present immigration laws are
I unsatisfactory. We need every honest
! and efficient immigrant fitted to bc
i come an American citizen, every im- !
j migrant who comes here to stay, who j
! brings here a strong body, a stout l
I heart, a good head, and a resolute pur- J
! pose to do his duty well in every way,
i and to bring up his children as law
: abiding and God-fearing members of
; the community. But there should be
i a comprehensive law enacted with the
! object of working a threefold improve?
ment over our present system. First,
! we should aim to exclude absolutely
; not only all persons who are known to
I be believers in anarchistic principles
I or members of anarchistic societies.
j lint also all persons who arc of a low
moral tendency or of unsavory reputa?
tion. This means that we should re?
quire a more thorough system of in?
spection abroad and a more rigid system
of examination at our immigration
ports, the former being especially neces- j
sary. |
The second object of a proper immi- .
gration law ought to be to secure by a
careful and not merely perfunctory ed
ucation test some intelligent capacity
to appreciate American institutions
and act sanely as American citizens. .
This would not keep out all anarchists,
for many of them belong to the intel
ligent criminal class. But it would do j
what is abo in point, that is, tend to
decrease thc sum of ignorance, so po- I
tent in producing tire envy, suspicion, i
malignant passion and hatred of order I
out of which anarchistic sentiment in- r
evitably springs. Finally, all persons \
should be excluded who are below a'c
certain standard of economic fitness to t
enter our industrial field as competi- ? c
tors with American labor. There should a
be proper proof of personal capacity to c
earn an American living and enough j t
money to insure a decent start under ! s
American conditions. This woud stop f
the influx of cheap labor, and the re- j i
suiting competition which gives rise | J
to so much of bitterness in American j a
industrial life. j s
Both the educational and eonomic | p
tests in a wise immigration law should v
be designed to protect and elevate the j n
general body politic and social. A very e
close supervision should be exercised g
over the steamship companies which t<
mainly bring over the immigrants, an
they should be held to a strict accounl
ability for any infraction of thc law.
Present Tariff System.
There is general acquiescence in 011
present tariff system as <i national po!
icy. The first rcqnisite to our prosper
ity is the continuity and stability c
this economic policy. Nothing could li
more unwise than to disturb the busi
ness interests of the country by an
'general tariff change at this timi
Doubt, apprehension, uncertainty ar
exactly what we most wish to avoid i
the interest of our commercial and ma
teral well-being. Our experience in th
past has shown that sweeping revision
of the traiff are apt to produce condi
(ions closely approaching panic in th
j business world. Yet it is not only pos
' sible, but eminently desirable, to com
bine with the stability of our economi
system a supplementary system of rc
ciprocal benefit and obligation witl
other nations. Such reciprocity ts ar
incident and result of the firm estab
lishment and preservation of our pres
cut economic policy. It was especially
provided for in thc present tariff law.
Reciprocity must be treated as tin
handmaiden of protection. Our firs
duty is to sec that the protection grant
ed by thc tariff in every case where
it is needed is maintained, and thai
reciprocity be sought for so far as ii
can safely be done without injury tc
our home industries. Just how far tim
is, must be determined according to thc
individual case, remembering alway!
that every application of our tariff pol
icy to meet our shifting national needs
must be conditional upon the cardinal
fact that the duties must never be re?
duced below the point that will cover
the difference between the labor cost
here and abroad. The well-being of the
wage-worker is a prime consideration
of our entire policy of cconomice legis?
lation.
Subject to this proviso of the proper
protection necessary to our industrial
well-being at home, the principal of
reciprocity must command our hearty
support. Thc phenomenal growth of ex?
port trade emphasizes the urgency of
the need for wider markets and for a
liberal policy in dealing with foreign
nations. Whatever is merely petty and
vexatious in the way of trade restric?
tions should be avoided. Thc customers
to whom wc dispose of our surplus pro?
ducts in thc long run, directly or indi?
rectly, purchase those surplus products
by giving us something in return.
Their ability to purchase our products
should as far as possible, be secured
by so arranging our tariff as to enable
us to take from them those products
which we can use without harm to our
own industries and labor, or the use of
which will be of marked benefit to us.
I ask the attention of thc Senate to
the reciprocity treaties laid before it
by my predecessor.
American Merchant Marine.
The condition of the American mer?
chant marine is such as to call for im?
mediate remedial action by the Con?
gress. It is discreditable to us as aNation
that our merchant marine should be ut?
terly insignificant in comparison to that
of other nations which we overtop in
other forms of business. We should not
longer submit to conditions under
which only a trifling portion of our great
commerce is carried on our own ships.
To remedy this state of things would
not merely serve to build up our ship?
ping interests, but it would also result
in benefit to all who are interested in
the permanent establishment of a wider
market for American products, and
would provide an auxiliary force for the
Navy.
Our Government should take such
action as will remedy these inequali?
ties. The American merchant marine
should be restored to the ocean.
The Cold Standard.
The Act of March 14, 1900. intended
unequivocally to establish gold as the
standard money and to maintain at a
parity therewith all forms of money
medium in use with us, has been shown
lo be timely and judicious. The price
of our Government bonds in the world's
market, when compared with the price
of similar obligations issued by other
nations, is a flattering tribute to our
public credit. This condition it is evi?
dently desirable to maintain.
In many respects thc National Bank?
ing Law furnishes sufficient liberty for
the proper exercise of the anking
function; but there seems to bc need
of better safeguards against the derang?
ing influence of commercial crisis and fi?
nancial panics.
Internal Taxes.
The collections from duties on im?
ports and internal taxes continue to
?xcecd the ordinary expenditure of
the Government, thanks mainly to the
reduced army expenditures. The ut?
most care should be taken not to re?
duce the revenues so that there will lie
my possibility of a deficit; but, after
iroviding against any such contingen
:y, means should be adopted which
viii bring the revenues more nearly
within the limit of our actual needs. In
lis report to thc Congress the Secrc
ary of the Treasury considers all these
piestions at length, and I ask your at
ention to the report and rccommenda
ions.
Strict Economy.
I call strict attention lo the need of
trict economy in expenditures. Thc fact
hat our national needs forbid us to be
laggardly in providing whatever is actu
Jly necessary to our well-being, should
nakc us doubly careful to husband our
lat ional resources, as each of us hus
ands his private resources by scrupulous
voidance of anything like reckless or
tasteful expenditure.
Agricultural Department.
Thc Department of Agriculture dur
ng the past fifteen years has steadily
roadened its work on economic lines,
nd has accomplished results of real
abie in upbuilding domestic and for
ign trade. It has gone into new fields,
ntil it is now in touch with all sections
f our country, and with two of the isl
nd groups that have lately come under
ur jurisdiction, whose people must look
3 agriculture as .1 livelihood. It is
[?arching thc world for grains, grasses,
ruits and vegetables specially fitted for
Production into localities in the several
tates and Territories where they may
dd materially to our resources. By
cientific attention to soil survey and
ossible new crops, to breeding of new
arieties of plants, to experimental ship
lents. to animal industry and applied
liemistry, very practical aid has been
hen our farming and stock-Trowing in?
posts.
j * Insular Possessions.
In Hawaii our aim must be to de?
velop the territory on the traditional
American lines. We do not wish a
region of large estates tilled by cheap
labor; we wish a healthy American com?
munity of men who "themselves till thc
farms they own. AITour legislation for
the islands should be shaped with this
end in view.
It is a pleasure to say that it is
hardly more necessary to report as to
Porto Rico than asp.to any State or
territory within our continental limits.
The island is thriving as never before.
and it is being adifinistered efficiently
and honestly. Its people are now en?
joying liberty and order under the pro?
tection of the United States, and upon
this fact we congratulate them and our?
selves. 1 ask the attention of the Con?
gress to the need of.4cgislation concern?
ing the public lands f>f Porto Rico.
In Cuba such process has been made
towards putting the independent gov?
ernment of the island upon a firm foot?
ing that before thc present session of
the Congress closes this will be an ac?
complished fact, Cuba will then start
as her own mistress; and to thc beauti?
ful Queen of thc Antilles, as she unfolds
this new page of her destiny, we extend
our heartiest greetings and good wishes.
Elsewhere I have discussed the question
of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, how?
ever, there arc weighty reasons of mor?
ality and of national interest why the
policy should bc held to have a pecu?
liar application, and I most earnestly
ask your attention to the wisdom, in?
deed to the vital need, of providing for
a substantial reduction in thc tariff du?
ties on Cuban imports into thc United
States.
In the Philippines our problem is
larger. They are very rich tropical is?
lands, inhabited by many varying tribes,
representing widely different stages of
progress toward civilization. Our earn?
est effort is to help these people upward
along the stormy and difficult path that
leads to self-government. We hope to
make our administration of the islands
honorable to our Nation by making it of
the highest benefit to the Filipinos them?
selves; and as an earnest of what we in?
tend to do, we point to what we have
done. Already a greater measure of
material prosperity and of governmental
honesty and efficiency has been attain?
ed in thc Philippines than ever before in
their history.
There are still troubles ahead in the
islands. The insurrection has become
an affair of local banditti and maraud?
ers, who deserve no higher regard than
thc brigands of portions of the Old
World. Encouragement, direct or in?
direct, to these insurrectos stands on the
same footing as encouragement to hos?
tile Indians in the days when we still
had Indian wars. Exactly as our aim
is to give to the Indian who remains
peaceful the fullest and amplest consid?
eration, but to have it understood that
we will show no weakness if he goes
on the warpath, so we must make it
evident, unless we are false to our own
traditions and to the demands of civil?
ization and humanity, that while we
will do everything in our power for the
Filipino who is peaceful, we will take
the sternest measures with the Fili?
pino who follows the path of the in
surrecto and the ladrone.
The heartiest praise is due to large
numbers of the natives of the islands
for their steadfast loyalty. The Maca
| bebes have been conspicuous for
their courage and devotion to the flag
The time has come when there
should be additional legislation for
thc Philippines. Nothing better can
be done for the islands than to intro?
duce industrial enterprises. Nothing
would benefit them so much as throw?
ing them open to industrial development.
I call your attention most earnestly
to the crying need of a cable to
Hawaii and the Philippines, to be con?
tinued from the Philippines to points
in Asia. We should not defer a day
longer than necessary the construc?
tion of such a cable. It is demanded
not merely for commercial, but for
political and military considerations.
Either the Congress should imme?
diately provide for the construction
of a government cable, or else an ar?
rangement should be made by which
like advantages to those accruing from
a government cable may be secured to
the government by contract with a pri?
vate cable company.
No single great material work which
remains to be undertaken on this con?
tinent is of such consequence to the
American people as the building of a
canal across the Isthmus connecting
North and South America. Its import?
ance to the Nation is by no means lim?
ited merely to its material effects upon
our business prosperity; alone it would
be to the last degree important for us
immediately to begin it.
I am glad to be able to announce to
you that our negotiations on this subject
with Great Britain, conducted on both
sides in a spirit of friendliness and mu?
tual good will and respect, have resulted
in my being able to lay before the Sen?
ate a treaty which if ratified, will enable
Ul to begin preparations for an Isthmian
canal at any time, and which guarantees
to this Nation every right that it has
ever asked in connection with the canal.
The signed treaty will at once be laid
before the Senate, and if approved, the
Congress can then proceed to give effect
to the advantages it secures us by pro?
viding for the building of the canal.
The Monroe Doctrine.
Our people intends to abide by the
Monroe Doctrine and to insist upon it
as thc one sure means of securing thc
peace of the Western Flemisphere. The
Navy offers us the only means of mak?
ing our insistance upon the Monroe
Doctrine anything but a subject of de?
rision to whatever nation chooses to dis?
regard it. We desire the peace which
comes as of right to the just man arm?
ed ; not the peace granted on terms of
ignominy to the craven and the weak?
ling.
Army and Navy.
The work of nj building the Navy
must be steadily continued No one
point of our policy, foreign or domestic,
is more important than this to the honor
and material welfare, and above all to
the peace, of our Nation in the future.
Whether we desire it or not, we must
henceforth recognize that wc have inter?
national duties no less than internation?
al rights. Even if our flag were hauled
down in the Philippines and Porto Rico,
even if we decided not to build the Isth?
mian Canal, we should need a thorough?
ly trained Navy of adequate sire, or else
)e perpared definitely and for all time to

A great debt is owing from the pub
lie to the men of thc Army and Navj
They should be so treated as to enabl
them to reach thc highest point of ef
ficiency, so that they may be able to re
spond instantly to any demand made up*
on them to sustain thc interests of tin
Nation and the honor of the flag. Tin
individual American enlisted man is pro
baldy on the whole a more formidabli
fighting man than the regular of an]
other army. Every consideration shoulc
bc shown him, and in return the highes
standard of usefulness should be exacter,
from him. It is well worth while for th<
Congress to consider whether the pay o!
enlisted men upon second and subsequent
enlistments should not be increased tc
correspond with the increased value ol
thc veteran soldier.
Civil Berrie*
The merit system of making appoint
ments is in its essence as democratic
and American as the common school
system itself, lt simply means that in
clerical and Other positions where thc
duties are entirely non-political, all ap?
plicants should have a fair field and no
favor, each standing on his merits as
he is able to show them by practical
test. Written competitive examina?
tions offer the only available means in
many cases, for applying this system In
other cases, as where laborers are em?
ployed, a system of registration un?
doubtedly can be widely extended. There
are, of course, places where the writ?
ten competitive examination cannot be
applied, and others where it offers by no
means an ideal solution, but where under
political conditions it is, though an im?
perfect means, yet the best present means
af getting satisfactory results.
Interstate Commerce.
In 1887 a measure was enacted for
the regulation of interstate railways,
commonly known as thc Interstate
Commerce Act. The cardinal provi
ons of that act were that railway
rates should be just and reasonable
ind that all shippers, localities, and
commodities should be accorded equal
treatment
The act should be amended. The rail?
way is a public servant. Its rates should
je just to and open to ali shippers alike.
Fhe Government should see to it, that
vithin its jurisdiction this is so, and
should provide a speedy, inexpensive
md effective remedy to that end
Uprising in China.
Thc general terms of the settlement
if the questions growing out of the an
i-foreign uprising in China of 1900,
laving been formulated in a joint note
ddrcssed to China by the representa?
ble* of the injured powers in Decem
ier last, were promptly accepted by the
Chinese Government. After protracted
onferences the plenipotentiaries of the
everal powers were able to sign a final
irotocol with the Chinese plenipoten
iaries on the /th of last September,
etting forth the measures taken by
3hina in compliance with the demands
if the joint note, and expressing their
atisfaction therewith. It will be laid
icforc the Congress, willi a report of
he plenipotentiary on behalf of the
Jnited States, Mr. William Woodville
Rockhill.
The Consular Service.
The consular service is now organ
zed under the provisions of a law pass?
el in 1856, which is entirely inadequate
0 existing conditions. The interest
bown by so many commercial bodies
hroughout the country in thc reorgan
zation of the service is heartily com?
mended to your attention.
St. Louis Exposition.
I bespeak the most cordial support
rom the Congress and the people for
lie St. Louis Exposition to commemo
ate the One Hundredth Anniversary
f the Louisiana purchase. This pur
hase was the greatest instance of ex
ansion in our history. It definitely
erided that we were to become a great
ontinental republic, by far the fore
iost power in the Western Ilcmis
liere. It is one of three or four great
indmarks in our history?the great
urning points in our development.
The Charleston Exposition.
Thc people of Charleston, with great
ncrgy and civic spirit, are carrying
n an Exposition which will continue
iroughout most of the present session
f the Congress. I heartily recommend
lis Exposition to the good will of the
eople. It deserves all the encourage
lcnt that can be given it.
At Peace With the Nations.
The death of Queen Victoria caused
ie people of the United States deep and
eartfelt sorrow, to which the Govern
icnt gave full expression. When Pres
lent McKinley died, our Nation in turn
xeived from every quarter of the Brit
lh Empire expressions of grief and
empathy no less sincere. The death of
ie Empress Dowager Frederick of Ger
lany also aroused the genuine sympathy
f the American people; and this sym
alliy was cordially reciprocated by
iermany when the President was assas
nated. In thc midst of our affliction
e reverently thank the Almighty that
t are at peace with the nations of man
ind; and we firmly intend that our pol?
ly shall bc such as to continue unbroken
icsc international relations of mutual
aspect and good will

There has been a great deal of sym?
pathy wasted upon Siberian exiles,
writes William E. Curtis from St.
Petersburg. While there have doubt?
less been innumerable cases of in?
justice and brutality, for Russian of?
ficials are corrupt and cruel, and the
Slavs, as a race, have always regarded
human suffering with indifference,
nevertheless, under ordinary circum?
stances, the majority of those who
have been banished to Siberia are
much better off than they were at
home and ought to consider them?
selves fortunate to escape Imprison?
ment for a term of years. The cara?
vans of convicts, whose misery and
anguish have aroused so much horror
and indignation In civilized countries
have not usually undergone any great?
er hardships than were borne by the
pioneers who crossed our own prairies
to Colorado, Montana and California
before the overland railroads were
built. And, upon arriving at their
destinations, unless they were guilty
of serious crimes, their surroundings
and circumstances were often much
better than those of the men who
developed the wealth of the mountains
and the prairies west of the Missis?
sippi river. The life of a miner or a
ranchman or a farmer in Siberia,
whether he bo an emigrant or a con?
vict suffering banishment, offers in?
finitely greater advantages for moral
and material improvement than can
be found in any of the great Russian
cities, and In the great majority of
cases what was imposed as a punish?
ment turned out to be a blessing, for
many of the wealthiest and most in?
fluential men In Siberia are exiles
who have found unlimited opportuni?
ties for tho exercise of their talents
and Industry. The exile system was
adopted by Nicholas I., "the Iron
czar," with the idea of utilizing con?
vict labor for thc development of the
timber, pastoral and agricultural re?
sources of the Yast region beyond the
Caucasus mountains, and, Instead of
sending offenders to prison, shipped
them Imo the wilderness to work
out their email salvation under the
surveillance of the police. They
were ticket-of-leave men. They were
permitted to go and come and do
whatever their hands found to do, and
enjoy the fruits of their Industry with?
out interference from the authorities
so long as they remained in the neigh?
borhood of the community to which
they were assigned. Good behavior
was rewarded by additional liberty.
Exiles who proved trustworthy were
allowed the privileges of ordinary citi?
zens and were sometimes permitted on
parole to return to their old homes
in Russia to visit their parents or at?
tend to business affairs. No one was
chained either on the march or after
arrival unless he had committed a
capital crime, or had tried to escape,
or was refractory or had violated the
orders or the rules imposed upon him.
The heartrending pictures drawn by
Mr. Kennan and other writers were
often accurate, but the figures who
appeared in them were usually men
who had aroused the hostility of tho
officials by resistance or defiance and
were punished for that reason.
