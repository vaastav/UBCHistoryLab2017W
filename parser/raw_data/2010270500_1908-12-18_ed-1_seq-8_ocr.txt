CHICAGO.
While the commercial mortality e
htblts a surprising elimination of weak

Is attested by sustained gain in vol
ume of payments through the banks
and steadier conditions In manufactur

the annual inventories and repairs, but
there Is Increase In hands employed
and a lietter flow of spoclfleatlous and

and at interior points ore seasonably
stimulated by colder weather and tha
absorption of heavyweight apparel,
household needs and food products
makes gratifying headway. Christinas
warps sell freely and the improvement
also appears to'some extent in the lux
uries. Henvlcr movements are seen In
the breadstuff's, provisions and live
stock, with prb-es at ft lower average
and more encouraging to consumers.
A strengthening Influence Is derlvcdj
from the sustained recovery in earn

expanded, business in regular whole
sale and Jobbing lines has quieted
down. Colder weather and the ap
proach .of the clsso of the year have.
helped to stimulate final distribution,
but it is noted that both regular retail
trade and the usual Christmas shopping
demand havo not yet fully met expec

at the South, where low-priced cotton
is a retarding feature. Best reports
come from the southwest and the spring
wheat and Pacific Northwest In whole
sale and Jobbing, except where the lat

ments to meet current needs, there is
a disposition to go slower, pending a
clearer view of year-end distribution
and the taking of inventories. In In
dustrial lines, while there is still some
Jdlo machinery, the volume of orders
booked Is sufllclent to Induce manufac

Prof. Kenneloy of Harvard says tSiat
tho Importance attached to winning a
race and beating a concrete competitor is
old-fashioned and savors of tbo "ante-
chronometer" days, and that the Imper
sonal scientific age demands a different
attitude in athletics. Ho says that the
only attempt worth while nowadays is
to havo a try against the record. '
Tbo Cornell educational special is tho
first farm train to be sent out by ths
New York Stats College of Agriculture.
Forty-five minute stops were made at
tbo smaller stations, and the subjects
chosen for the lectures were those adapt
ed to tho products raised in the territory
covered. In the larger towns and cities
tho boards of trade hired halls for the
speakers, and many people attended tho
lectures. Schools were given a holiday to
enable students to attend.
In discussing the subject of refractory
children at tho Congress of Neurologists
In session recently at Ghent, Belgium, It
was generally admitted by physicians pres
ent that the refractory can not be cured
by represaivo measures. "It "s quite
possible," said one, "to punish a child
into jail." It was agreed that most un
manageable children suffer from some
nervous disease and should be treated as
sick rather than as merely refractory.
Great stress was laid on the necessity of
developing the psychic faculties.

the annual report of the isthmian canal

tures of the report is the fact thnt It

ments of historical fact which cannot
be disputed or become subjects of con
troversy. One of the Interesting chapters of the
report Is on the lock and dam construc
tion. In view of the reported break In
the Gatun dam, the experience of the
commission In the construction of the
Sosa-Corosal dam and the Gatun locks
Is Important at this time as illustrat
ing the unexpected obstacles being met
with by the nrmy engineers In charge of
the work. It wns found necessary to
move the site of the Sosa-Corosal dam
when 8Uposedly solid ground shifted.

sary to move the site of the dam be
cause of the shifting of the ground
when dumping wns begun, and this de
spite the fact that the plans and speci
fications showed the foundation for the
proposed dam to be a solid base. Bor
ing at Gatun. where the reported break
Is alleged to have taken place recently,
plainly indicated the presence of un
derground water, but the engineers
were proceeding with the greatest con
fidence that the difficulty could Is? ob
viated and thnt the bottom was sound.
