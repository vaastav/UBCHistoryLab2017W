Their National Characterised
tics Misunderstood, De'?
clares the Premier.
TOKIO. December 11.?Denying that
Japan is militaristic and inviting foreign
critics to study Japanese history
to prove the contention. Premier Ta10
kashi Hara has written an article entitled
"Japanese National Character?
is ties as Misunderstood by the World."
which is published in tlie Cliuwe. an
organ of the Seiyukai party.
"It is charged that the Japanese is
an aggressive race, bellicose and lackG
ing in civilization other than the art
of war," the premier wrote. "This
misunderstanding may be attribute^
to three defective points of view.
86 First. Japanese history is disregarded;
second, Japanese literature and
art are set aside; and, third, the true
conditions of the life of the people
have not been studied by the critics.
I. "Japan has no record in her history
It, of having conquered other races, as
>, every one knows. The foreign wars
;o in the Meiji era, especially the Rus>r
sian war, were simply wars for selfdefense
against foreign aggression.
"If Japan's history is examined
closely It is rich in records of warfare,
to be sure, but it is a great
mistake to jump at the conclusion
- that the Japanese people have been
_ f a warlike race altogether, born and
reared in the midst of wars. The wars
of Japanese historical records have
been political wara In the days before
civilization had advanced, nolit
ical and mijitary wars were employed
for the same purpose by all countries
which are now civilized.
"Japan has never violated international
laws or international faith.
She has been rather too timid to do
so, or too inexperienced .for it. In
other words, she has not yet been degraded
to that extent. It there is any'
fault to be found with .the Japanese
it may be, as critics at home tell us,
that Japan is too modest and reserved.
In respecting international
obligations and in being loyal to
friendly nations there perhaps is no
country which will surpass Japan,
thouph many nations apply the same
principles of mora] conduct between
nations as between individuals.
"To be sure, we cannot say that
there has been no cause for misunderstanding
as regards affairs with
China in the past, but that was a
question of the ability of the men in
power at the time. It was not due to
any of the traditional principles of
Japan. That the result of the deals
with China were not such as a section
of Americans had understood
them to be is a matter which has
now been brought home clearly to
the people of the world. Of that I
am firmly convinced."

Rusty Has Another,Visitor.
What sePins a wrong and nothing less
You yet nay have good cause to bless.
?Rusty the Kox Squirrel.
All the day after the visit of his
small cousin. Chatterer the Red Squirrel.
Rusty the Fox Squirrel was in better
spirits. Chatterer had given him hope,
hope that some day soon Fanner
Brown's Boy would set him free so that
he could go back to the Green Forest.
He had begun to hate that cage in ,
which he was a prisoner. He hated it
no less now, but the thought that he i
might not have to stay in it much longer
helped a whole lot.
All day long he thought of Chatter- :
, er's visit early that morning, and he
I quite forgave Chatterer for his meanness
in trying to drive him awav from the
Green Forest It had been very good
of Chatterer to come way over to that
barn to visit him and cheer him up.
What he didn't know was that Chatterer
had not been wholly unselfish in
that visit. He had had a very good
breakfast of yellow corn from one of
Farmer Brown's bins before he had
visited Rusty. .
That night after (Farmer Brown's Boyhad
left Rusty was still thinking of
Chatterer and hoping that Chatterer had
been right, when he heard a soft thump
on the roof of his cage, just such a
thump as Chatterer had made when
he jumped onto it that morning. He
looked up expecting to see Chatterer
there again, and in the dim light, for it
was already quite dark in the barn, he
thought at first that it was Chatterer.
He opened his mouth to speak when
he saw that this small person had a
much longer body than had Chatterer,
and that he was glaring down between
the wires with eyes that were red with
savage longing. Rusty's heart almost
stopped beating. At least, that is the
way it seemed, for fear, dreadful fear,
was clutching at it. He knew now who
that was. He knew that he was staring
up into.the- cruel face of Shadow
the Weasel. Big as he was, ever so
| much bigger than Shadow, a feeling of
helplessness swept over Rusty, for he
knew that he was no match for that
slim, quick-moving little hunter. So
Rusty simply crouched down in a corner
of the cage and shook with helpless
terror. He had quite forgotten that
an ne couian i gei out ho qiuiuok cuuiuii l
get in.
Shadow bit savagely at the wires a
couple of times, ran all over the cage
looking for a hole big enough for him to
I get through, and, finding none, snarled
angrily and bounded away. For some
time Rusty remained right where he
was, too frightened to move. At last,
still trembling, he crept into his bed.
I J&fe I
HK HAD BAD DREAMS. DREAMS OK
RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE FROM
SHADOW THE .WEASEL.
From time to time he heard the sound
of small feet racing across the barn
floor and shrill, squeaks of terror, and '
he knew that Robber the Rat and his
friends were running from Shadow the
Weasel.
Rusty shivered at the sounds. Then
a great thankfulness filled his heart, i
thankfulness that he was a prisoner in
that wire cage. Yea. sir, that wire cage
no longer seemed the dreadful prison
he had begun to think it. Now it was
a place of safety. The enemy that all
Squirrels and many other little people
fear more tlian any other could not
harm him. and all because of that wire
that kept him a prisoner. It kept him
n prisoner, but it kept Shadow the
Weasel away from him.
At last Rusty fell asleepu -but it was
a troubled shep. He bad Dad dreams,
dreania of running for his life from
Shadow the Weasel and vainly looking
for a place in which to hide where
Shadow could not follow him. Ill the
morning when he awoke his first thought
was of that dreadful visitor of the night
before, and for the first time he was
glad, glad way through, to find that
he was still inside, not outside, that
wire prison.

said today:
"Information rrom our missions in

"Polish marks are now approximately
500 to the $1, Austrian and
Hungarian crowns about 600 and
Czecho-slovakian crowns almost 100.
The German mark is around 70
to the 51. Austria is in a worse plight

"With a proper revision of our tax
laws," he said, "we can do much to
lid in bringing about permanent
prosperity. There is only one just
ule of taxation, and that is that
:very man should contribute toward
sharing? the burden of the government
iccording to his ability."
Although he could see no immediate
hope of reductions in taxes, Senator
Lenroot said that the next administration,
he hoped, would be able to
reduce the government expenditures
tiy a billion dollars.
"We must expect to raise upon the
average four billions a year for some
years to come. Senator Lenroot declared.
"We therefore cannot look
for any great reduction in the sum
total of taxes, except as business conditions.
as they are today, will automatically
reduce the amount."
He counseled- "cool judgment and
steady purpose among business men
"if the country is to come through the
present readjustment period without
disaster."
"There can he no permanent prosperity,"
he said, ."until general price
levels are reached, and the aim and
purpose of every business man should
be to establish the price level as soon
as possible."

"The European children's fund of the
American relief administration is furnishing
one meal a day to about 3.000,000
children in these countries and is

It also has warehouses in all the countries
named, by which persons in the

staple foods through food drafts. The

; with the continued scarcity of food and
faulty means of distribution, indicate
that the approaching winter will see the
need of the fullest employment of every
