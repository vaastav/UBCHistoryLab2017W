THE MESSAGE.
The first message to be addressed by
President McKinley to a regular ses
sion of congress, and therefore the first
in which he has had occasion to ex
press opinions comprehensive in their
scope, is a document of dignity and
force. Laying aside all partisan prej
udice and treating this utterance of
the official head of all parties and our
people under the constitution with the
respect that it deserves, the opinion
of the careful reader must be that it
is the work of a man sincerely concern
ed to do his duty by the nation which
has honored him. Disagreeing heartily
ar.d entirely as we do with certain por
tions of it, we wish at the outset to
commend its tone and the spirit of dig
nified American patriotism that pos
sesses most, of it.
The bulk of the message is devoted to
the two pressing subjects of financial
reform and our foreign relations. With
a brief reference to the new tariff act,
of which Mr. McKinley himself prob
ably realizes that the least said is for
his party the best, he at once attacks
the problem of financial legislation. On
this his opinions are expressed with
something more of positiveness than he
was wont to use in his campaign
speeches, and leave no doubt of his
sympathy with the cause of sound
money. Nevertheless, in following the
main lines of the report of Secretary
Gage, he falls much short of what the
country has a right to expect and de
mand.
The recommendations which he
makes are summed up, as has already
been hinted in the press dispatches,
in a suggestion that the greenbacks,
when redeemed, should be paid out
only in exchange for gold; that
national banks should be allowed to
Issue notes to the face value of their
bond deposits; that the tax on circula
tion should be reduced to one-half of
I per cent; that the minimum capital
for establishing a national bank should
be reduced to $25,000; that the issue of
national bank notes be restricted to de
nominations of $10 and upwards, and
that national banks be required to re
deem their notes in gold.
While putting forward these doc
trines, President McKinley takes oc
ia.sT.rn to minify and shame the criti
ci.sms of his party upon Mr. Cleveland's
administration by announcing emphat
ically that he will, if emergency arises,
pursue its policy. Declaring that, If
present conditions continue, bond is
sues may at any time become necessary
in order to maintain the gold standard,
he says: "The nation, without any fix
ed gold revenue, is pledged to maintain
gold redemption, which it has steadily
and faithfully done; and which, under
the authority now given, it will con
tinue to do." This is Mr. Cleveland's
policy reiterated.
He further gives the lie to the as
sertions of his party organs during the
last campaign by confessing what they
then knew to be the fact, as we all
know it, that the proceeds of the bond
sales were only partially required to
supply deficient revenues, and that the
real necessity for bond sales came in
order to maintain the gold reserve. He
dared not advert to the fact that the
tariff policy of his own party has in
eured a perpetual deficit. The value
of his recommendation is, therefore,
greatly impaired by the proviso which
he has attached to it. He says: "I
earnestly recommend, as soon as the
receipts of the government are quite
sufficient to pay all the expenses of the
government," that greenbacks, when
redeemed, shall remain in the treasury
when paid for in gold.
Inasmuch as Secretary Gage him
self estimates the deficit for the year
ending on the 30th day of June' at
$25,000,000, and there Is every prospect
that these figures are as insufficient
as those of Mr. Carlisle, the qualifica
tion of Mr. McKinley would postpone
even the partial precaution that he
advises to the indefinite future. Un
less congress cuts down appropriations
beyond all probability, revenue will
never be equal to expenditure until to
the Dingley act, reducing the nation's
income, is added some supplement
that will increase its resources.
As we have said, in commenting upon
these suggestions, as foreshadowed by
the news dispatches of the last two
weeks, the scheme is temporary, par
tial and insufficient. It is not what
the country has a right to expect and
require of the party in power. It does
not even go to the modest length of
retiring the dangerous greenbacks.
It would orly hoard these notes in the
treasury, to be released again by act
of congress upon the first pressure on
j our finances. It it be a great advance
' from Mr. McKinley's former position
as an open sympathizer with the free
silver movement, it must be a tre
i mendous disappointment to those who,
as believers in sound money, helped
to place him in his present position.
The message outlines, we may as
sume, the utmost that can be accom
plished by the party, and more than
its own leaders are disposed to ap
prove. Yet, were all these recom
mendations embodied in laws, we
should have made but one tiny, halt
ing step toward financial reform. Our
currency would be as chaotic and
heterogeneous as ever; the maintenance
of its parity would be a task almost
as herculean; the business of Issuing
money would not have been separated
from the rational and proper exercise
of governmental power, and, in one
word, we should be left exposed In the
future to every danger of the past.
We can conceive that, for Mr. McKin
ley, the positions of the message rep
resent a great advance. For the cause
of sound money and financial reform
they are a poor achievement, a petty
promise, a mere sop to Cerberus, and
will neither satisfy the demand for
scientific monetary reform nor pacify
those who clamor for cheap money
and plenty of it.
The section of the message which
deals with the Cuban situation con
stitutes the bulk of the document,
and is prepared with great care and
expressed with vigor and art. Presi
dent McKinley is to be congratulated
chiefly upon this portion of the docu
ment. He has written there an un
answerable argument, the argument
which we have urged again and again
upon our readers in the last two pears,
against the bellicose interference of
congress as expressed in resolutions
recognizing the belligerency of the
Cuban insurgents. Mr. McKinley
quotes with aptness and effect from
a message of President Grant on this
same subject. It is proved that, un
der the conditions actually existing in
Cuba, there is no propriety or advan
tage in such action by congress.
The relation of the parties is not
that to which a declaration of bellig
erency is germane. We should have
to violate the understandings and defi
nitions of international law in order
to express a mock and empty sympa
thy. Furthermore, and again as we
have pointed out repeatedly, the prac
tical effect of such action would be
hurtful rather than helpful to Cuba,
while immensely inconvenient and
damaging to ourselves. To recognize the
existence of a state of war between
two parties, one of which has absolute
possession of all seaports and total
mastery of marine communication,
would be to subject the commerce of
the United States to a hateful es
pionage, and to invite an almost cer
tain collision, without conferring upon
the people of Cuba the slightest bene
fit.
Much stress is placed by Mr. Mc-
Kinley upon the meaning and con
sequences of the change of ministry
in Spain. He asserts that the change
of policy toward Cuba is in good faith
and big with consequences. Speaking
from the information accessible
through the state department and his
agents in Cuba, he asserts that the
Spanish policy has been reversed since
the recall of Weyler; that the atroci
ties which excited ungovernable hor
ror have ceased; and that there is a
determined effort being made to restore
Cuban people to the soil, to protect
them in the exercise of their ordinary
employment and to bring peace about
rather by concession and political re
form than by the bayonet and the
stock. The president, therefore, declares
positively that he regards "the recog
nition of belligerency of the Cuban in
surgents as now unwise and therefore
inadmissible." He promises that, if such
a step should become proper in the fu
ture, the executive will take it. He says:
"It is our honest duty to Spain, to our
friendly relations with Spain, that she
should be given a reasonable chance
to realize her expectation and to prove
the asserted efficacy of the new order
of things to which she stands irrecov
erably committed."
It is scarcely usual for a president
to express himself so firmly and open
ly upon an issue on which the houses
of congress have already taken action.
As far as intermeddling under the
name of "recognition" is concerned,
we hope that his representations will
avail with the pettifogging jingoes
who have set the country by the ears.
We believe that the United States
should have interfered of its own mo
tion, not by wads of paper, but with
ships of war, in the Cuban contest
long ago. If conditions are being made
more tolerable there now, and a new
policy is under trial, it might be well
to stay the hand of justice for a mo
ment. As for anything that congress
has proposed to do, or is likely to do,
it can only be following the lines of
past prefension to our own disgrace.
The country will, therefore, hope that
Mr. McKinley may be able to hold in
check the demagogues who are ready
to use Cuba's misfortunes to their <Swn
personal advantage.
It is hard to understand how a man
who could think so clearly and express
himself so carefully and conrmendably
THE SAINT PAUI, Gr,083: TUESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1897
on one question of foreign relations
should fall so lamentably when he ap
proaches another. Mr. McKinley gives
hir unqualified approval to the scheme
for Hawaiian annexation; again, we
need hardly say, without furnishing a
single valid reason therefor. We have
ceased to expect this, because the ad
vocates of that policy admit by their
silence that they have no reasons. Mr.
McKinley. like the rest of them, shows
that for three-fourths of a century the
independent life of the Hawaiian
islands has been assured; our predomi
nant interest there has been estab
lished, and the understanding that in
terference by any other power would
not be tolerated by us has been accept
ed by all the nations of the world.
He admits, therefore, at the outset
that every possible advantage of an
nexation already exists both for our
selves and for the people of these
islands. Nevertheless, he asks that we
violate the safe and sound policy of a
hundred years simply to satisfy what
he calls "the logic of events." Very
wisely, he shuns the practical problems
that show their heads forthwith. He
says that "the wisdom of congress will
see to it" that action is taken to "avoid
abrupt assimilation of elements per
haps hardly yet fitted to share in the
highest franchises of citizenship."
This is the presidential euphemism for
concealing the fact that we are asked
to incorporate into the United States
a population of 109,000 people of
whom only a little more than 3,000 are
Americans, of whom 46,000 are persons
that would be excluded from our terri
tory by our own laws, and some 40,000
are natives unfit for citizenship and un
alterably opposed to annexation by the
United States.- Whenever was there a
greater crime against the American idea
than this proposition to enforce upon
us, in the interest of a greedy ring, an
abhorred and unwholesome union?
They who advocate it do well to keep
silence when they are asked to show
cause. It is little to the credit of Mr.
McKinley's patriotism or his intelli
gence, or both, that he should not have
dealt with this subject in the same hon
orable temper and mind, and with the
same care for the American state, that
he bestowed upon the section relating
to Cuba.
The remainder of the message is de
voted to the usual diversity of topics
and touches them with an agreeable
conciseness. The absurd monetary
commission comes in for some words
of faint praise, and Mr. McKinley and
his secretary must have exchanged
grins when these words were written
down: "It is to be hoped that their
labors may result in an international
agreement which will bring about a
recognition of both gold and silver as
money, etc." There is an intimation
that subsidies to shipping would not be
distasteful, as, indeed, they are a log
ical part of the wicked protection re
gime. The condition of the Indian Terri
tory is set forth at much length, and it
is made perfectly clear that the time
has come when that anomalous govern
ment and social system should be made
to conform to the conditions of life and
citizenship elsewhere.
The president takes the rather sur
prising position that the government
must bid in the Kansas Pacific railroad
at the forthcoming sale, unless another
bidder appears who will pay its claim
in full. With only ten days interven
ing, he announces to congress that, un
less it takes action in the meantime, he
will make the necessary deposit and
authorize the payment, on behalf of the
public, of the $7,000,000 of indebtedness
which constitutes a lien prior to that of
the United States. It thus appears
that the contingency avoided by post
poning the sale of the Union Pacific is
likely to occur in the case of the Kan
sas Pacific, and we may expect the peo
ple to become the proud possessors of a
railroad line without independent busi
ness to keep it alive, at a cost of many
millions of dollars, to serve as a basis
for future congressional scandals.
The closing words of the message
sustain in strong terms the system of
civil serviee\reform, and give a mild
hint to congress that economy in ap
propriations will be appreciated. Had
pages, instead of a paragraph of the
message, been devoted to this last duty,
to the necessity and propriety of cut
ting our annual expenses down by $100,
--000,000 per annum. Mr. McKinley
would have discharged, perhaps, his
greatest duty, and made an issue that
will yet be the winning war cry be
tween parties in this nation, rushing
now so fast toward an abyss of profli
gacy.
BUT IT IS NOT TRUE.
What makes the notes of national banks
good? Not the honesty of the bank officials,
not the largeness of assets— but because Uncle
Sam guarantees that those notes will be
paid. If that is true, it would seem that
Uncle Sam could guarantee notes just as
■well without an intermediary. — Little Falls
Herald.
Very much of the prejudice in favor of j
the greenbacks rests upon just such j
misapprehension as that shown in the !
above extract. There are two provi
sions for making good the notes of a
national bank that fails to redeem its
notes. The act provides for a liability
of the stockholders for all the debts
and obligations of the bank. Power is
given to the comptroller to require the
shareholders to make good any loss of I
capital through mismanagement. He j
can appoint a receiver In case of fail
ure. All these provisions are intended
to keep the banks solvent and their
notes safe. But back of these are the
bonds of the United States deposited
with the comptroller as a guarantee
of the solvency of the notes. Should
the market or cash value of the bonds
deposited fall below the amount of the
circulation of the bank, that officer
can require the bank to put up addi
tional bonds, a provision clearly indi
cating that the United States does not
even guarantee the permanent par of
their own bonds. It a bank fails to re
deem and goes into a receivership, the
comptroller uses these securities to
get the money for the redemption of
the notes.
There is nowhere any guarantee of
the notes of the national banks. There
is only the promise that Ihe bonds
will stand as security for their sol
vency to the extent of the value of
the bonds. Should a contingency arise
under which the bonds of the United
States should fall in value, as they
might in case of war, and the amount
realized from the deposits be insuffi
cient to redeem at par the bank notes,
they would be redeemed pro rata.
There is no guarantee of the govern
ment that it -will redeem them in full
in any event."
In the national bank act the govern
ment exercises the only function any
government should ever assume to
wards any money t all that ours as
sumes towards its coins. It emits the
latter and stands sponsor that each
contains a determinate quantity of
metal of a specified fineness. But it
does not guarantee them against the
loss from abrasion, and the holder has
to suffer the loss when use has brought
the coin Delow the limit of tolerance.
The treasury will not receive gold coin
at its face value when reduced* by
abrasion below the standard of weight
more than y 2 per cent. When
lower than that they must be recoin
ed when received at the treasury. So,
in the proper supervision assumed over
issues of credit money by private cor
porations, all that the government as
sumes is the duty of providing as far
as possible for their solvency. It de
mands securities which it will sell and
redeem the notes, but there is no ab
solute guarantee, and there should be
none. For seventeen years the United
States could not redeem the green
backs, and their bonds sold below par.
What happened then is possible again
to occur. It is well in the beginning
of the impending conflict between the
policies of sole issue of credit money
by the government and by private en
terprise under governmental supervi
sion to have accurate understanding of
facts.
"MUST BE TAUGHT TO THINK."
On page 14 of the report of Mr. Wil
son, present secretary of agriculture, is
an observation that is profound and
pregnant with significance. "The farm
er must be taught to think," he says.
This assumes, of course, that the farm
er does not think, for if he doea he
needs no teaching. There is an impres
sion in the mind and on the memory of
those who have spent any part of their
lives on a farm that there is no indus
trialist who does quite as much think
ing as does the tiller of the soil. Why
"Tama Jim" should think farmers do
not think is difficult even to conjecture.
Possibly lowa farmers say "I reckon,"
or "I calculate," instead of "I think,"
but even reckoning or calculating im
plies thinking. Farm life is one con
tinual round of thinking. All seasons
demand it. From the time the roosters
forewarn the coming day and the sleep
rested farmer says to his drowsy
spouse, "I reckon it is time to get up,"
until the night's chores are done and
he remarks, "I guess I'll turn in,"
he keeps a steady stream of thinks
running through his head. If, in addi
tion to all his work, he has a mortgage
on his farm, any spare time he may
have between thinking about his work
is occupied in thinking about the mort
gage.
There are, however, some affairs that
concern him about which we agree the
farmer should be taught to think, for
he has shown a remarkable capacity
for letting others think for him; gulping
down their thoughtß and acting on them
without the least apparent considera
tion, whether the thoughts are sound
ones or are merely the flim-flam of a
confidence man. It is not of such mat
ters that Mr. Wilson would have the
farmers taught to think, we are sure,
for if they had been so instructed and
had got to thinking right he would not
now be adorning the office of secretary
of agriculture, and when they ever get
so to thinking the political party he
embellishes will be laid away In the
graveyard with its mother, the Whig,
and its grandmother, the Federal par
ty. It was not about matters politi
cal that the secretary would have farm
era taught to think, whatever else he
may have counseled.
What would happen, for instance,
should farmers go to thinking straight
about the markets they sell in and
those they buy in? Suppose they should
all get onto the hard fact that they
sell in markets that are open to all the
farmers of the world, and that they
must buy what they need in a market
from which the world's makers of those
things are either shut out entirely or
made to advance a smart tax on their
wares to enhance their cost and that of
similar ones of domestic make, which
increase the farmer has to pay. Might
they not demand that they have the
right to buy in the same kind of a mar
ket in which they are compelled to sell?
And then where would the secretary's
party be "at?" Suppose, again, they
should get to thinking correctly about
the effect of a policy professedly in
tended to keep up a high wage rate
upon the price of wages on the farm, so
high now that no ordinary farmer can
afford to employ the help he really
needs and would gladly hire If the
profits of the farm would allow it.
Might he not conclude that he had been
working against his own interests in
supporting such" a policy?
Then he might think profitably about
that siren's song of his Home Market
tlrat was to compensate him for the
burden he carried in helping the men
of the shops and mills, by creating a
home market that would consume all
he raised. He might calculate how long
he had been helping build up that mar
ket, how little progress had been made
in it, how far in the future it yet is and
what chance t^iere.,^s of its arriving be
fore the millennium. He might compute
what it has cost him so far, and he
would be pretty aRt, to conclude that he
was paying dearly for his whistle. He
might get to i asking why the men in
the shops and mills could not make and
sell their goods under the sarrfe market
conditions in ''which he inescapably
irid.de and  his produce. All
these and many more matters he might
get to thinking about if he were
"taught to think," and there is no ques
tion if he did that the result would be
very disconcerting to the party now
served by the secretary of agriculture.
On the whole, we think he would better
withdraw his advxie.
AT THE THEATERS.
That fascinating romance, "The Prisoner of
Zenda," was presented in its dramatic dre3s
at the Metropolitan last evening. Local
theatergoers are acquainted with the dramat
ization of Anthony Hope's absorbing story,
as it was produced at the same theater last
season.
Each succeeding season that a play con
tinues on the road generally witnesses a de
terioration in the cast. Those wise Eastern
managers figure that the provincial Western
public tastes good wine bo seldom that it
cannot detect the domestic brand. While this
is not exactly the case with the company
Daniel Frohman has sent to the Northwest
thi3 time with the "Prisoner o£ Zenda," for
Howard Gould still dteads the company, still
the fact remains that the performance is not
as satisfying as that given here last season.
There is no disposition to cavil, but theater
goers are rather particular. As already in
timated, Howard Gould's impersonation of
Rudolph Rassendyll and Rudolph V.,
as well as his portrayal of Prince Rudolph
in the prologue, must meet with universal ap
probation. So must the Col. Sapt of that
veteran actor, R. F. McClannon. Neither can
the captious critic deny the sincerity, direct
ness and freedom from theatrlclsm that
characterized Miss Grace Reals in the role of
the jealous Antoinette de Mauban. But these
roles were well played last year. Now the
candid critic cannot tell his readers that Rob
ert Elliott is a Black Michael that anybody
would fear. Mr. Elliott has a good stage
presence, appearing to advantage when silent.
But a word from — well, almost anybody — sets
him in a fury, touches him off, explodes him.
as it were. Such men are not dangerous, and
they fail to inspire other men with the no
tion that they are. In tearing his passion
to tatters, Mr. Elliott's enunciation becomes
Indistinct, and he sacrifices repose, repres
sion and dignity.
An intelligent actress Impersonated Princess
Flavia, but a love story Is a love story. Fer
vor and passion, such as may become a
princess, it is true, are the qualities we de
mand in Flavia. Miss Franchon Campbell,
a young woman of refined personality, es
sayed the role. She read her lines with
proper emphasis, but her love-making must
have given Rudolph the chills. What though
Flavia does afterward reflect "If love were
all," there was a time when love was all to
her. Miss Campbell's Icy propriety needs a
little more sunshine.
The performance, aa a whole, was pleas-
Ing. Mr. Gould's delineation of the princi
pal roles, so to speak, was always artistic.
Reserve force, a clear comprehension of the
requirements of a situation, a pleasing, manly
deportment and adequate powers of expres
sion characterize his performance, which
gives evidence of considerable versatility. R.
F. McClannon's Col. Sapt was a capital im
personation, and Vaughan Glaser's Fritz yon
Tarlenheim is worthy of mention.
The others were acceptable.

TWO ROADS TO RAINY LAKE.
Anoka and Mille Lacs Are Rivals In
the Names.
The newly-incorporated Minneapolis,
Anoka & Rainy Lake road appears to
have a rival in the field. Under the
name of the Minneapolis, Mille Lacs
& Rainy Lake Railroad, a prospectus
has been issued by Orville Rinehart as
attorney, and C. B. Maben and L. S.
Sherman as advance agents, setting
forth the plans of the organization.
All interested are asked to "take hold
and help secure" rights of way, ties,
grading, etc., and especially to push
through a 5 per cent tax in counties
through which the new road is to run,
the counties being reimbursed with
stock to the amount of the tax. This
last may be readily supposed to sound
the keynote to the scheme. The local
parties interested have taken the road
up with the idea that it can be built
by the counties themselves which are
most concerned in its projection.
It is announced that a systematic
trip will be made over the entire route
within a short time to arrange for
meetings which shall give expression
to the sentiment now being cultivated
in favor of the 5 per cent tax.
The proposition advanced is that of
incorporating a construction company
with the smallest amount of capital
thought advisable, the stockholders of
this company to later form and incor
porate a railroad company, the trans
action being made to promise a hand
some profit to the promoters. The 5
per centum is expected to amass $300,
--000.
The prospectus further states that
"one of the best known capitalists in
Minnesota, well acquainted in three
continents" has agreed to place the
necessary bonds for rails, rolling stock,
etc., as soon as the roa4 is ironed.
The prospectus is very glowing in
its presentation of the productive and
fertile country through which the line
is to pass and of the immense value of
the ore region it will tap. In this con
nection the circular warns all who may
be interested that old and established
companies will likely send out agents
to attack and if possible defeat the
present scheme by surveying or prom
ising to survey or run parallel lines.
SURPLUS OP 22,000,000
Bushels of Spring Wheat Not Yet
Marketed.
State Grain Inspector Clausen says
that 67,000,000 bushels is the amount of
the spring wheat crop of 1897 that has
already been marketed. There are, ac
cording to Mr. Clausen, 9,000,000 bushels
in country elevators. For bread and
country milling, 25,000,000 bushels of the
remainder of the estimated crop of 140,
--000,000 bushels will have to be set aside;
17,000,000 bushels will have to go for
seeding, leaving the farmers 22,000,000
bushels to sell. At Duluth, the receipts
have averaged up 60 per cent No. 1
northern and No. 1 hard; at Minne
apclis, there has been only 25 or 30
per cent of the higher grades. The Du
luth receipts have been duplicated a
little by about 2,000,000 bushels of wheat
that have been shipped to Duluth from
Minneapolis, and there has been a simi
lar but lesser duplication between Du
luth and Chicago. Mr. Clausen says
that Southern Minnesota and South Da
kota farmers ought not to seed from
their own this year's crop. Southern
parts of the state and South Dakota
should go to lowa and Nebraska for
pood seed, and the central regions to
North Dakota and Northern Minnesota.
The acreage in need of new seed is not
less than 5,000,000 acres. At present
there Is an abundance of good seed,
but it will soon be shipped out. For
seeding 5,000,000 acres, 7,500 bushels are
required.
AMES ELECTED CUSTODIAN.
Required Twenty-Seven Ballots to
Make the Selection.
John Ames, who for the past year has
held the important position of night watch
man at the court house and city hall, was
yesterday elected custodian of the building,
to fill the vacancy caused by the death of
Frank H. Dayton. The election itself took
but a moment, but the caucus which preceded
the election occupied tho time of the Re
publican members of the court houso and
city hall commission nearly two hours. Tho
caucus was held in the mayor's reception
room, and although Night Watchman Ames'
frlend3 claimed that he had five of the six
votes at 1 o'clock, It was not until after 5
p. m. that he secured a bare majority in the
caucus.
Present at the secret caucus were Mayor
Doran, Assemblymen Daly and D!x. Aid.
Lindahl and County Commissioners Kellerman
and Moritz. Commissioner McCarron, who 13
called the Democratic member of the court
house and city hall commission, was not In
vited to attend the caucus: in fact, he was
politely told that his presence was not de
sired. When the caucus assembled it was
predicted that Ames would be selected on the
first formal ballot. But there was a hitch
somewhere, for it was not until twenty-seven
ballots had been cast that Ames received a
majority of the six votes. Mayor Doran and
Assemblyman Daly voted for Ames right
along, and Commissioners- Moritz and Keller
man stood by George Gerlich. Assemblyman
Dlx, in order to prolong the agony and also
make himself a good fellow, kept casting hi 3
ballot for M. L. Mclntyre, although he was
ready, when the mayor gave the office, to
switch to Ames. Aid. Lindahl voted stead
ily for Emanuel Johnson, but was understood
to be willing and ready to cast his vote for
Gerlich whenever it was found necessary in
order to elect the Eighth ward candidate.
The balloting see-sawed along until after
5 o'clock, when, on the twenty-seventh ballot.
Ames received four votes and was declared
the caucus nominee. It was claimed after
the caucus was over that Kellprman was the
one who deserted Gerlich and voted with
Doran, Daly and Dix for Ames.
Dixs candidate for custodian, M. L. Mc
lntyre, was elected night watchman.
MINNESOTA LEFT OUT.
Commander 'Wood, <». A. It.. Respon
nlble for an Oversight.
General orders No. 3, issued under
date of Nov. 24, by Commander-in-
Chief Gobin, of the G. A. X., contains
the names of the comrades honored by
appointment on the staff of the com
mander-in-chief. A glance at the list,
however, shows that Minnesota has
been overlooked in the selection. As
there are plenty of soldiers in Minne
sota who are as competent and as de
sirable aides as those to be found In
other states, the question arose as to
the occasion of the slight. It was said
by a prominent G. A. R. man yesterday,
whom a reporter for the G1 o b c asked
about it, that the absence of Minne
sota names is due to the neglect of
State Commander Wood. It seems that
each state is entitled to as many aides
as it has delegates to the national en
campment. Minnesota has abi>ut four
teen delegates, and accordingly should
have been recognized to the extent of
that many aides. But as the comman
der-in-chief is not supposed to be able
to select his aides from all the states,
the department commanders furnish
him with a list of men qualified to act
as aides, and at the same time who are
satisfactory to their respective state de
partment or its head. From this list
the commander-in-chief can select such
names as he desires. It is presumed
that Commander Wood, of Minnesota,
neglected to send this list and the re
sult is that Minnesota alone of all
states, where there is a G. A. R. or
ganization, is not represented on Gen.
Gobin's staff. It is probable that when
a list from this state has been sent to
Philadelphia Minnesota will be recog
nized.
ELKS* "ABSENT" LIST.
Xiiine of Leslie P. Rli-hnrdson In
Added to It.
"We do not know," said H. P. Hall,
at the Elks' lodge, of sorrow Sunday,
"whose names will be added to our
marble tablet a year from today," and
even as he spoke the unseen hand had
grasped a chisel to add to the roster
of "the absent" the name of Ltslie P.
Richardson. Mr. Hall had related how
one of the three members of thn lodge
who passed away In the last year had
gone among strangers, and far from
home, on the eastern shore of the
United States, and even as he spoke
far in the opposite direction where the
setting sun sank in the Golden gate,
another member of the lodge expired.
Consumption was the malady which
caused Mr. Richardson to leave St.
Paul. Here he had been clerk of the
United States court and afterward !
private secretary to President, James J.
Hill, of the Great Northern. Later he
was treasurer of the Montana Coke
and Coal company, a position which he
held until failing health drove him to
California three months ago.
The mother and brothers of the de
ceased reside in St. Paul.
FIRE IN HERBST BLOCK.
Some Excitement on West Seventh
Street Last Mrm*.
The corner store in the Herbst block
at West Seventh and Walnut streets
was damaged by flre shortly after 11
o'clock last evening to the extent of
$250. The store is occupied as a mil
linery establishment. The tenants
were absent at the time of the fire and
its origin is unknown. Lodgers over
the store were somewhat frightened by
the smoke which filled the entire build
ing, but no one was injured.

with fierce national cries.
VIENNA, Dec. 6.— A dispatch from
Bucharest, the capital of Roumania,
says that yesterday a fanatical mob,
20,000 strong, armed with iron bars and
cudgels, attacked the Jewish quarters,
pillaged shops and destroyed windows
and furniture. Sanguinary encounters
took place between the rioters and the
police, the latter being too weak to
make an effective resistance. Finally
the gendarmerie, with fixed bayonets,
dispersed the mob.
PRESENT RELATIONS PROLONGED
By a Bill Introduced in the Hun
unriaii Legislature.
BUDAPEST, Dec. 6.— ln the lower
house of the Hungarian parliament to
day a bill was introduced by Haron
IJanffy, the premier, prolonging for a
year the compact between Hungary
and Austria proper. Without reference
to any action on the same subject on
the part of the Austrian government.
Baron Banffy's bill provides that the
pn sent economic relations between
Hungary and Austria be prolonged, un
changed, until Dec. 31, 1898. The enact
ment, however, will lapse if a now
agreement is constitutionally concluded
before then. In the event of ;l new
agreement no! being concluded by May
1, 1898, the Hungarian government will
submit to parliament bills providing
for a definite regulation of the economic
relations between the two states, which
measures will come In force al th
of the year 1898.
After the bill had been read Francis
Kossuth, the leader of the Independ
ents, asked leave to Introduce a mo
tion tomorrow, instead of today, as
the hour was late. Permission was
granted and the house adjourned amid
cries of "Kossuth" and "Independent
Hungary forever." It is believed to be
Kossuth's intention to obstruct th
if possible until the end of the year,
when the existing treaty with Austria
expires.
HEARING VGREEMENT.
Austrian Factions May Agree Upon
a Compromise.
VIENNA, Dec, 6.— A paper says the
negotiations of the Austrian premier.
Baron yon Frankenthurn, with the va
rious parties are progressing towards
an agreement on the language ques
tion. The young Czechs, it appears,
are willing to agree to a division of Bo
hemia into three language territories,
Czech, German and mixed. The great
est difficulty, it is added, is found in tha
fact that the Czechs Insists that the of
ficials throughout Bohemia must speak
both languages. To this the Germans
are opposed.
At a banquet to the delegations yes
terday Dr. Herold, a prominent citizen
and deputy, told the emperor that con
ciliation was impossible until equal
rights were granted to the Czechs and
Germans in Boheriiia, The emperor
replied In the severest terms referring
to the riots at Prague and expressing
his indignation at the conduct of Herr
Pedlpin, the mayor of Prague. Ac
cording to a guest Emperor Francis
Joseph said: "Your mayor is the guilty
man. There has been agitation. I know
very well that the Czech deputies have
much to bear, but what the mayor
said cannot be tol< i

SIX HUNDRED ARRESTS.
An Official Report on the Rioting at
Prague.
VIENNA, Dec. G. — It Is officially stat
ed that since the beginning of the dis
turbances al Prague there have i n
600 arrests; 300 people have '#» -n in
jured by the swords of the po..ce and
troops and sixty policemen and twenty
soldiers injured by the stones of the
mob. It is understood that the Ger
man leaders In the relchsrath will
unanimously reject all proposals made
' by the government. This was foreseen
by Hungary, and therefore Baron
Banffy, the Hungarian premier, intro
duced today In the Hungarian parlia
ment tho bill prolonging the ausgleich
for a year without ref< any
action on the subject by Austria. Prob
ably the Hungarian indep ndent party,
led by Herr Francis Kosi uth, will
