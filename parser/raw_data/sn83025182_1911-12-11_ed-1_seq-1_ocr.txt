[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 11.—A
sensation was created in the trial to
day of Bert H. Franklin, chief detec
tive for the McNamara defense, on
charge of trying to bribe a prospective
juror in the McNamara case, when
the name of Clarence S. Darrow, chief
counsel for the McNamaras was drag
god into the case. G. N. Lockwood,
the man whom Franklin iB alleged to
have bribed, testified that before the
alleged bribe was paid to him, Frank-
Lockwood testified that, after Frank
lin had made one bribery proposal to
him, he went to District Attorney
Fredericks and advised him of the
proposition. Fredericks advised him,
said the witness, to "go through with
it," if the bribery proposition was re
newed.
Lockwood continued:

$4,000 in this for you.'

THIS IS IMPORTANT!
5 Here is an important announcement to not only the patrons of The Daily Gate City,
but to every citizen of Keokuk and vicinity as it means more than merely what it shows
on the surface.
Commencing today The Daily Gate City is taking the full leased wire service of The
United Press Associations.
The telegraphic news of the world is received direct in The Daily Gate City office,
15,000 words daily to be received over the wires, taken by The Daily Gate City's own op
erator and the pick of this great mass of news, published in the paper. It is the greatest
service received by any newspaper in the United States—no more complete service being
given by the United Press to any of its patrons—the same service taken by the papers of
New York, Chicago, St. Louis, Denver, or any of the great cities.
It is a business stroke by The Daily Gate City, something never before attempted in
Keokuk, or in a city of this size. It is possibly the most important announcement ever
made by a newspaper in this section.
It is an improvement and advancement Which The Gate City believes its patrons and
friends will appreciate.
It is another one of the signs of the times. Keokuk isgoing to grow and The Daily
Gate City realizes it. With faith in the future growth of the city, this paper intends to
'keep up with the procession and grow right along with the city.
The undertaking is really a greater one than The Daily Gate City could swing were
it not for the optimistic feeling that Keokuk will appreciate the move and that the imme
diate future justifies it.
The additional expense is considerable, but the magnitude of the improvement is but
in keeping with what Keokuk should expect in all lines. Appreciation and support of
the people will determine whether or not the move has been made at the proper time, or

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 11.—Ev
ery police detective in Kansas City
together with a number of private

trail of Harry Waldron, juror in the
second trial of Dr. B. Clark Hyde for
the murder of Col. Thomas H. Swope,
who, having tired of Jury service, be
ing unable to escape by legal means,
climbed through the transom of his
room at the Centropolis hotel and dis
appeared, either last night or early
this morning.
Both sides 1n the trial are in con
fusion and lt ls generally admitted
that Waldron's sudden leave taking
will necessitate an entire re-hearing
of the case. Judge Porterfleld will not
be quoted in the matter except to say
that nothing will be officially decided
until Waldron is found and lt is dis
covered how and when he escaped
and with whom he has talked since
his departure. Prosecutor Conkling.
now conducting the case ln the ab
sence of United States Senator Reed,
said that if the defense demand^ a
new trial they probably will get it
but that a sweeping Investigation will
be made to discover whether Waldron
left of his own volition or was indue
ed to go.
Attorney Walsh for the defense said
that he was not prepared to say what
he would do but that the court prob
ably would be asked to appoint eli
sors until Waldron's return.
Waldron's transom had been nailed
down, but the juror abstracted the
ature, escaping unnoticed.
The appearance of eleven men at
breakfast this morning was the first
intimation the deputies had of his es

BRICEVILLE Tenn., Dec. 11.—After
hours of exploration within the CrosB
mountain mine for traces of life, Dr.
J. A. Holmes, chief of tho United
States bureau of mines, today an
nounced that there was a possibility
that men are alive ln the furthermost
parts of the pit, and that there may
be open places wherein Imprisoned
miners have sought relief, and that the
hot air may not have penetrated that
far.
From what I have heard and obser
vations I have made, I have an im
pression that there are a hundred and
fifty men ln the mine,'.' said Dr.
Holmes.
Eighteen ibodies have been recover
ed in the mine.

[United Press Leased Wire Service..!
BRICEVILLE, Tenn., Dec. 11.
With the break of day, miners who
escaped the explosion in the Knox
ville Coal and Iron company's mine
Saturday and the crew from the gov
ernment rescue car this morning re
sumed tholr work of searching tho
ruins of the ill-fated mine I'-jr the
bodies of the men now believed to be
certainly dead. Officials stated today
the death list would be somewhere
between 150 and 200.
Black damp has started working its
havoc within the mine and the res
cue parties are able to remain in the
workings only a short time. The hun
dreds who have volunteered to search
for bodies are divided into squads of
fifty and remain two hours in the
mine when they are relieved. Eight
bodies have been recovered.
Widows and children burned watch
fires last night on the hills and wait
ed for their dead to be brought forth
from the pit. Babies slept in shawls
on mossy slopes.
Sang Hymn In Choru9.
t~~
Above the weeping of the women a
man's voice rose in song and an old
Methodist hymn became a swelling
chorus of perhaps one hundred voices,
long since made rough and rasping
from the dust of the mine. Then in
prayer, the widows, and children and
fathers whose sons are in the mines,
knelt on the hillside besido their fires.
Destitution is stalking hand in hand
with death in this village. Most of
the men whose lives were blasted out
by the explosion are either husbands
or the sole support of their mothers
and fathers.
The average wages of a miner here
is $35 a month. And what with low
pay and high prices, few if any of the
miners lost in tho disaster has been
able to save anything against such a
tragedy as this.
There have been whispered protests
against conditons here for some time.
Once the miners organized, but the
union was broken up.
