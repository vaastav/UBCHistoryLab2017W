Washington, Dec. 5.—President
Taft's annual message, which was read
In both houses of congress today, deals
exclusively with tho anti-trust statute.
The full text of the message Is as fol
lows:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives: This message is the first
of several which I shall send to con
gress during the interval between the
opening of its regular session and its
adjournment for the Christmas holi
days. The amount of Information to be
communicated as to the operations of
tlie government., the number of impor
tant subjects calling for comment by
the executive, and the transmission to
congress of exhaustive reports by spe
cial commissions, make it impossible
to include in one message of a reason
able length a discussion of the topics
that ought to be brought to the atten
tion of the national legislature at its
first regular session.
The Anti-Trust Law—Tho Supreme
Court Decisions.
In May last the Supreme court hand
ed down decisions in the suits in
•quity brought by the United States to
•njoln the further maintenance of the
Standard Oil trust and of the Ameri
can Tobacco trust, and to secure their
dissolution. The decisions are epoch
making and serve to advise the busi
nsss world authoritatively of the scope
*and operation of the anti-trust act of
1890. The decisions do not depart in
any substantial way from the previous
decisions of the court in construing
and applying this important statute,
but they clarify those important deci
sions by further defining the already
admitted exceptions to the literal con
struction of the act. By the decrees,
they furnish a useful precedent as to
the proper method of dealing with the
capital and property of Illegal trusts.
These decisions suggest the need and
•wisdom of additional or supplemental
legislation to make it easier for the
entire business community to square
•with the rule of action and legality
thus finally established and to preserve
the benefit, freedom and spur of rea
sonable competition without loss of
real efficiency or progress.
No Change In the Rule of Decision—
Merely In Its Form of Expression.
The statute in its first section de
clares to be illegal "every contract,
combination in the form of trust or
otherwise, or conspiracy. In restraint
of trade or commerce among the sev
eral states or with foreign nations,"
and In the second, declares guilty of a
misdemeanor every person who shall
monopolize or attempt to monopolize
or combine or conspire with any other
person to monopolize any part of the
trade or commerce of the several
states or with foreign nations."
In two early cases, where the statute
was invoked to enjoin a transportation
agreement between interstate railroad
companies, It was held that it was no
(defense to show that the agreement as
to rates complained of was reasonal
at common law, because it was said
that the statute was directed against
all contracts and combinations in re
straint of trade whether reasonal at
common law or not It was plain from
ithe record, however, that the contracts
complained of in those cases would
not have been deemed reasonable at
«ommon law. In subsequent cases the
court said that the statute should be
given a reasonal construction and re
fused to include within its inhibition
certain contractual restraints of trade
-which it dominated as Incidental or as
Indirect.
These cases of restraint of trade that
the court excepted from the operation
of the statute were Instances which, at
common law, would hare been called
reasonable. In the Standard Oil and
Tobacco cases, therefore, the court
merely adopted the teste of the com
mon law, and in defining exceptions to
the literal application of the statute,
only substituted for the test of being
Incidental or indirect, that of being
reasonable and this, without varying
in the slightest the actual scope and
effect of the statute. In other words,
all the caseB under the statute which
have now been decided would have
been decided the same way if the court
had originally accepted In its construc
tion the rule at common law.
It has been said that the court, by
introducing into the construction
the statute common law distinctions,
has emasculated it. Ttrts is obviously
untrue. By its judgment every con
tract and combination in restraint of
Interstate trade made with the purpose
or neccssary effect of controlling prices
by stifling competition, or of establish
ing in whole or in part a monopoly of
such trade, is condemned by the stat
ute. The most extreme critics cannot
in^tAnoA ens9 til—t ousht tc be ccu
demned under the statute which is not
brought within its terms as thus con
strued.
The suggestion is also made that the
Supreme court by its decision in the
last two cases has committed to the
court the undefined and unlimited dis
cretion to determine whether a case
of restraint of trade is within the
terms of the statute. This is wholly
untrue. A reasonable restraint of
trade at common law is well under
stood and Is clearly defined. It does
not rest In the discretion of the court.
It must be limited to accomplish the
purpose of a lawful main contract to
which, in order that It shall be en
forceable at all. It must be incidental.
If it exceeds the needs of that contract
It is void.
Tho test of reasonableness was
never applied by the court at com
mon-law to contracts or combinations
or conspiracies in restraint of trade
whose purpose was or whose neces
sary effect would be to stifle competi
tion, to control prices, or establish
monopolies. The courts never as
sumed power to say that such con
tracts or combinations or conspira
cies might be lawful if the parties to
them were only moderate in the use
of tho power thus secured and did
not exact from the public too great
and exorbitant prices. It is true
that many theorists, and others en
gaged In business violating the
statue, have hoped that some such
line could be drawn by courts but
no court of authority has pvor at
tempted it. Certainly there is noth
ing in the decisions of the latest two
cases which should be a dangerous
theory of judicial discretion in en
forcing this statue can derive the
slightest sanction.
Force and Effectiveness of Statute a
Matter of Growth.
We have been twenty-one years
making this statue effective for the
purposes for which it was enacted.
The Knight case was discouraging
and seemed to remit to the states the
whole available power to attack and
suppress the evils of the trusts.
Slowly, however, the errors of that
Judgment was corrected, and only in
the last three or four years has the
heavy hand of the law been laid upon
the great illegal combinations that
have exercised such an absolute do
minion over many of our industries.
Criminal prosecutions have been
brought and a number are pending,
but juries have felt averse to convict
ing for jail sentences, and judges have
been most reluctant to impose such sen
tences on men of respectable standing
in society whose offense has been
regarded as merely statutory. Still,
as the offense becomes better under
stood and the committing of it par
takes more of studied and deliberate
defiance of the law, we can be confi
dent that juries will convict individ
uals and that jail sentences will be
imposed.
The Remedy In Equity by Dissolution.
In the Standard Oil case the Su
preme and circuit courts found the
combination to be a monopoly of the
interstate business of refining, trans
porting, and marketing petroleum and
Its products, effected and maintained
through thirty-seven different cor
porations, the stock of which was
held by a New Jersey company. It
in effect commanded the dissolution
of this combination, directed the
transfer and pro-rata distribution by
the New Jersey company of the
stock held by it in the thirty-seven
corporations to and among its stock
holders. and the corporations and in
dividual defendants were enjoined
from conspiring or combining to re
store such monopoly and all agree
ments between the subsidiary corpor
ations tending to produce or bring
about further violations of the act
were enjoined.
In the Tobacco case, the court
found that the individual defendants,
twenty-nine in number, had been en
gaged in a successful effort to ac
quire complete dominion over the
manufacture, sale, and distribution of
tobacco in this country and abroad,
and that this had been done by com
binations made with a purpose and
effect to stifle competition, control
prices, and establish a monopoly, not
only in the manufacture of tobacco,
but also of tin-foil and licorice used
in its manufacture and of its products
of cigars, cigarettes, and snuffs. The
tobacco suit presented a far more
complicated and difficult case than
the Standard Oil suit for a decree
which would effectuate the will of the
court and end the violation of the
statute. There was here no single
holding company as in the case of
the Standard Oil trust. The main
company was the American Tobacco
company, a manufacturing, selling,
and holding company. The plan
adopted to destroy the combination
and restore competition involved the
redivislon of the capital and plants
of the whole trust between some of
the companies constituting the trust
and new companies organized for the
purposes of the decree and made
parties to It, and numbering, new and
old, fourteen.
Situation After Readjustment.
The American Tobacco company
(old) radjusted capital, $92,000,000
the Liggett and Meyers Tobacco com
pany (new) capital, $67,000,000 the
P. Lorillard company (new) capital,
$47,000,000, and the R. J. Reynolds
Tobacco company (old) capital, $7.
525,000. are chiefly engaged in tW
manufacture and sale tof chewing and
smoking tobacco ami cigars. The
former one tin-foil company is di
vided into two, one of $825,000 cap
ital and the other of $400,000. The
one snuff company is divided into
three companies, one with a capital
of $15,U00,000 another with a cap
ital of $8,000,000 and a third with a
capital of $S,000,000. The licorice
companies arc two, one with a cap
ital of $5,758,00 and another with a
capital of $2,000,000. There is, also,
the British-American Tobacco com
pany, a British corporation, doing
business abroad with a capita! of
$26,000,000, the Porto Rican Tobac
co company with a capital of
$1,800,000, and the corporation of
United Cigar Stores, with a capital
of $9,000,000. Under this arrange
ment each of the different kinds of
business will be distributed between
two or more companies, with a di
vision of the prominent brands in the
same tobacco products, so as to make
competition not only possible but
necessary. Thus the smoking tobac
co business of the country is divided
so that the present independent com
panies have 21.39 per cent., while the
American Tobacco company will have
33.08 per cent., the Liggett and
Meyers 20.05 per cent., the Lorillard
company 22.82 per cent., and the
Reynolds company 2.66 per cent. The
stock of the other thirteen companies,
both preferred and common, has been
taken from the defendant American
Tobacco company and has been dis
tributed among its stockholders. All
covenants restricting competition have
been declared null and further per
foimance of them has been enjoined.
The preferred stock of the different
companies has now been given vot
ng power which was denied it under
the old organization. The ratio of
the preferred stock to the common
was as 78 to 40. This constitutes a
very decided change in the character
oi the ownership and control of
each company.
In the original suit there were twen
ty-nine defendants who were charged
with being the conspirators through
whom the illegal combination acquired
and exercised its unlawful dominion.
Under the decree these defendants
will hold amounts of stock in the va
rious distributee companies ranging
from 41 per cent, as a maximum to
2S% per cent, as a minimum, except
in the case of one small company, the
Porto Rican Tobacco company, in
which they will hold 45 per cent. The
twesty-nine individual defendants are
enjoined for three years from buying
any stock except from each other,
and the group is thus prevented from
extending its control during that pe
riod. All parties to the suit, and the
new companies who are ina.de parties,
are enjoined perpetually from in any
way effecting any combination be
tween any of the companies In viola
tion of the statute by way of resump
tion of the old trust. Each of the
fourteen companies is enjoined from
acquiring stock in any of the others.
All these companies are enjoined from
having common directors or officers,
or common buying or selling agents,
or common offices, or lending money
to each other.
Size of New Companies
Objection was made by certain in
dependent tobacco companies that this
settlement was unjust because it left
companies with very large capital in
active business, and that the settle
ment that would be effective to put all
on an equality would be a division of
the capital and plant of the trust into
small factions in amount more nearly
equal to that of each of the independ
ent companies. This contention re
sults from a misunderstanding of the
anti-trust law and its purpose. It is
not intended thereby to prevent the
accumulation of large capital in busi
ness enterprises in which such a com
bination can secure reduced cost of
production, sale and distribution. It
is directed against such an aggrega
tion of capital only when its purpose
is that of stifling competition, enhanc
ing or controlling prices and estab
lishing a monopoly. If we shall have
by the decree defeated these purposes
and restored competition between the
large units into which the capital and
plant have been divided, we shall have
accomplished the useful purpose of
the statute.
Confiscation Not the Purpose of the
Statute.
It Is not the purpose of the statute
to confiscate the property and capital
of the offending trusts. Methods of
punishment by fine or imprisonment
of the individual offenders, by fine of
the corporation, or by forfeiture of its
goods in transportation, are provided,
but the proceeding in equity is a spe
cific remedy to stop the operation of
the trust by injunction and prevent
the future use of the plant and capital
in violation of the statute.
Effectiveness of Decree.
I venture to say that not in the his
tory of American law has a decree
more effective for such a purpose
been entered by a court than that
against
the Tobacco trust. As Circuit
Judge Noyes said in his judgment ap
proving the decree:
"The extent to which has been
necessary to tear apart this combina
tion and force it into new forms with
the attendant burdens ought to dem
onstrate that the federal anti-trust
statute is a drastic statute which ac
complishes effective results which so
long as it stands on the statute books
must be obeyed, and which cannot
be disobeyed without incurring far
reaching penalties. And, on tho oth
er band, the successful reconstruction
of this organization should teach that
the effect of enforcing this statute is
not to destroy, but to reconstruct not
to demolish but to re-create in ac
cordance with the conditions which
the congress has declared shall exist
among the people of the United
States."
Common-Stock Ownership.
It has been assumed that the pres
ent pro-rata and common ownership
in all these companies by former
stockholders of the trust would insure
a continuance of the same old single
control of all the companies Into
which the trust has bv decree been
disintegrated. This is erroneous and
Is based upon the assumed inefflcacy
and innocuousness of judicial injunc
tions. The companies are enjoined
from co-operation or combination
they have different managers, direc
tors, purchasing and sales agents If
all or any of the numerous stockhold
ers, reaching into the thousands, at
tempt to secure concerted action of
the companies with a view to the con
trol of the market, their number is so
large that such an attempt could not
well be concealed and its prime mov
ers and all its participants would bo
at once subject to contempt proceed
ings and imprisonment of a summary
character. The immediate result of
the present situation will necessarily
be activity by all tho companies un
der different managers, and then com
petition must follow, or there will
be activity by one company and stag
nation by another. Only a short time
will inevitably lead to a change in
ownership of the stock, as all oppor
tunity for continued co-operation must
disappear. Those critics who speak
of this disintegration in the trust as
a mere chango of garments have not
given consideration to tho inevitable
working of the decree and understand
little the personal danger of attempt
ing to evade or set at naught the sol
emn injunction of a court whose ob
ject is made plain by the decree and
whose inhibitions are set forth with a
detail and comprehensiveness unex
ampled in the history of equity juris
prudence.
The effect ol' these two decisions has
led to decrees dissolving the combina
tion of manufacturers of electric lamps,
a southern wholesale grocers' associa
tion, an interlocutory decree against
tho powder trust with directions by
the circuit court compelling dissolu
tion, and other combinations of a sim
ilar history are now negotiating with
the department of justice looking to a
disintegration by decreo and reorgan
ization in accordance with law. It
seems possible to bring about these re
organizations without general business
disturbance.
Movement for Repeal of the Anti-Trust
Law.
But now that the anti-trust act is
seen to be effective for the accomplish
ment of the purpose of its enactment,
we are met by a cry from many differ
ent quarters for its repeal. It is said
to be obstructive of business progress,
to be an attempt to restore old-fash
ioned methods of destructive competi
tion between small units, and to make
impossible those useful combinations
of capital and the reduction of the cost
of production that are essential to con
tinued prosperity and normal growth.
In the recent decisions the Supreme
court makes clear that there is noth
ing in the statute which condemns
combinations of capital or mere big
ness of plant organized to secure
economy in production and a reduc
tion of its cost. It is ouly when the
purpose or necessary effect of the or
ganization and maintenance of the
combination or the aggregation of im
mense size are the stifling of competi
tion, actual and potential, and the en
hancing of prices and establishing a
monopoly, that the statute is violated.
Mere size is no sin against the law.
The merging of two or more business
plants necessarily eliminates competi
tion between the units thus combined,
but this elimination (s in contravention
of the statute only when the combina
tion is made for purpose of ending this
particular competition in order to se
cure control of, and enhance, prices
and create a monopoly.
Lack of Definiteness in the Statute.
The complaint is made of the statute
that it is not sufficiently definite in
its description of that which is forbid
den, to enable business men to avoid
its violation. The suggestion is, that
we may have a combination of two
corporations, which may run on for
years, and that subsequently the attor
ney general may conclude that it was
a violation of the statute, and that
which was supposed by the combiners
to be innocent then turns out to be a
combination in violation of the stat
ute. The answer to this hypothetical
case is that when men attempt to
amass stupendous capital as will en
able them to suppress competition,
control prices and establish a monop
oly they know the purpose of their
acts. Men do not do such a thing
without having it clearly in mind. If
what they do is merely for the purpose
of reducing t.be cost of production,
without the thought of suppressing
competition by use of the bigness of
the plant they are creating, then they
cannot be convicted at the time the
union is made, nor can they be con
victed later, unless-it happen that later
on they conclude to suppress competi
tion and take the usual methods for
doing so, and thus establish for them
selves a monopoly. They can, in such
a case, hardly complain If the motive
which subsequently is disclosed is at
tributed by the court to the original
combination.
New Remedies Suggested.
Much is said of the repeal of this
statute and of constructive legislation
intended to accomplish tho purpose
and blaze a clear path for honest mer
chants and business men to follow. It
may be that such a plan will be
evolved, but I submit that the discus
sions which have been brought out In
recent days by the fear of the con
tinued execution of the anti-trust law
have produced nothing but glittering
generalities and have offered no line
of distinction or rule of action
definite and as clear as tint whlcli the
Supreme court itself lays down in en
forcing tlie statute.
Supplemental Legislation Needed—Not
Repeal or Amendment.
I see no objection—and Indeed 1 can
sG" decided advantages—in the enact
ment of a law which shall describe and
denounce methods of competition,
which are unfair and are badees of the
unlawful purpose denounced in the
anti-trust law. Tlie attempt and pur
pose to suppress a competitor by un
derselling him at a price so unprofit
able as to drive him out of business,
or the making of exclusive contracts
with customers under which they are
required to give up association with
other manufacturers, and numerous
kindred methods for stifling competi
tion and effecting monopoly, should bo
described with sufficient accuracy in a
criminal statute ou the oue hand to
enable the government to shorten its
task by prosecuting singlo misde
meanors instead of an entire con
spiracy, and, on the other hand, to
serve the purpose of pointing out
more in detail to the business com
munity what must be avoided.
Federal Incorporation Recommended.
In a special message to congress
on January 7, 1910, I ventured to
point out tho disturbance to business
that would probably attend the disso
lution of these offending trusts. I
said:
"But such an investigation and pos
sible prosecution of corporations
whose prosperity or destruction affects
tho comfort, not only of stockholders
but of millions of wago earners, em
ployes, and associated tradesmen must,
necessarily tend to disturb the con
fidence of tho business community,
to dry up the now flowing sources of
capital from its places of hoarding,
and produce a halt in our present
prosperity that will cause suffering
and strained circumstances among
the Innocence many for the faults of
the guilty few. The question which
I wish in this message to bring clear
ly to the consideration and discus
sion of congress is whether. In order
to avoid such a possible business
danger, something cannot be done by
which these business combinations
may be offered a means, without great
financial disturbance, of changing the
character, organization, and extent of
their business into one within the
lines of the law under federal control
and supervision, securing compliance
with the anti-trust statute.
"Generally, in the industrial com
binations called 'Trusts,' the prin
cipal business is the sale of goods in
many states and in foreign markets
in other words, the interstate and for
eign business far exceeds the busi
ness done in any one state. Thi3
fact will justify the federal govern
ment in granting a federal charter
to such a combination to make and
sell in interstate and foreign com
merce the products of useful manu
facture under such limitations as will
secure a compliance with the anti
trust law. It Is possible so to frame
a statute that while it offers protec
tion to a federal company against
harmful, vexatious, and unnecessary
Invasion by the states, it shall sub
ject it to reasonable taxation and
control by the states with respect to
its purely local business.
"Corporations organized under this
act should be prohibited from ac
quiring and holding stock in other
corporations (except for special rea
sons, upon approval by the proper
federal authority), thus avoiding the
creation under national auspices of the
holding company with subordinate
corporations in different states, which
has been such an effective agency in
the creation of the great trusts and
monopolies.
"If the prohibition of the anti-trust
act against combinations in restraint
of trade is to be effectivtl/ enforced,
it is essential that the national gov
ernment shall provide for the creation
of national corporations to carry on a
legitimate business throughout the
United States. The conflicting laws of
the different states of the Union with
respect to foreign corporations makes
it difficult, if not impossible, for one
corporation to comply with their re
quirements so as to carry on business
in a number of different states."
I renew the recommendation of the
enactment of a general law providing
for the voluntary formation of cor
porations to engage In trade and com
merce among the states and with for
eign nations. Every argument which
was then advanced for such a law,
and every explanation which was at
that time offered to possible objec
tions, have been confirmed by our ex
perience since the enforcement of
the anti-trust statute has resulted in
the actual dissolution of active com
mercial organizations.
It is even more manifest now than
it was then that the denunciation of
conspiracies in restraint of trade
should not and does not mean t.he de
nial of organizations large enough to
be intrusted with our interstate and
foreign trade. It has been made more
clear now than it was then that a
purely negative statute like tho anti
trust law may well be supplemented
by specific provisions for the build
ing up and regulation of legitimate
national and foreign commerce.
Government Administrative Experts
Needed to Aid Courts in Trust
Dissolutions.
The drafting of the decrees in the
dissolution of the present trusts, with
a view to their reorganization into
legitimate corporations, has made it
especially apparent that the courts
are not provided with the administra
tive machinery to make the neces
sary inquiries preparatory to re
organization, or to pursue such in
quiries, and they should be empow
ered to invoke the aid of the bureau
of corporations in determining the
suitable reorganization of th* disin­
tegrating parts. The circuit court
and the attorney general were great
ly aided in framing the decree in the
tobacco trust dissolution by an ex
pert from the bureau ot corporations.
Federal Corporation Commission Pro
posed.
1 do not sot forth in detail the term»
and sections of a statute which might
Supjilj the constructive legislation per
mitting and aiding the formation of
combinations of capital into federal!
corporations. They should be subject
to rigid rules as to their organization
and procedure. Including effective pub
licity and to tho closest supervision as
to the Issue of stock and bonds by an
executive bureau or commission in the
department of commerce and labor, to
which in times of doubt they might
well submit their proposed plans for
future business. It must be distinctly
understood that Incorporation under a
federal law could not exempt the com
pany thus formed and its incorporators
and managers from prosecution under
the anti-trust law for subsequent ill«
gal conduct, but the publicity of Its
procedure and tho opportunity for fre
quent consultation with the bureau or
commission in charge of the incorpora
tion as to the legitimate purpose of Its
transactions would offer it as great se
curity against successful prosecutions
for violations of the law as would be
practical or wise.
Such a bureau or commission might
well be Invested also with the duty al
ready referred to, of aiding courts in
the dissolution and recreation of trusts
within the law. It should be an execu
tive tribunal of the dignity and power
of the comptroller of the currency or
the interstate commerce commission,
which now exercise supervisory power
over Important classes of corporations
under federal regulation.
The drafting of such a federal incor
poration law would offer ample oppor
tunity to prevent many manifest cvllSj
in corporate management today, in
cluding irresponsibility of control In
the hands of the few who are not the
real owners.
Incorporation Voluntary.
I recommend that the federal char
ters thus to be granted shall be volun
tary, at least until experience justifies
mandatory provisions. The benefit to
be derived from the operation of great
businesses under the protection of
such a charter would attract all who
are anxious to keep within the lines
of the law. Other large combinations
that fail to take advantage of the fed
eral incorporation will not have a
right to complain if their failure is
ascribed to unwillingness to 6ubmlt
their transactions to the careful scru
tiny, competent supervision and pub
licity attendant upon the enjoyment
of such a charter.
Supplemental Legislation Needed.
The opportunity thus suggested for
federal incorporation, it seems to me,
is suitable constructive legislation
needed to facilitate the squaring of
great industrial enterprises to the rule
of action laid down by the anti-trust
law. This statute is construed by
tho Supreme court must continue to
he the line of distinction for legiti
mate business. It must be enforced,
unless we are to banish individualism
from all business and reduce It to one
common system of regulation or con
trol of prices like that which now pre
vails with respect to public utilities,
and which when applied to all busi
ness would be a long step toward state
socialism.
Importance of the Anti-Trust Act.
The anti-trust act is the expression
of the effort of a freedom-loving peo
ple to preserve equality of opportun
ity. It is the result of the confident
determination of such a people to
maintain their future growth by pre
serving uncontrolled and unrestricted
the enterprise of the individual, his
ingenuity, his intelligence and his In
dependent courage.
For twenty years or more this stat
ute has been upon the statute book.
All knew of Its general purpose and
approved. Many of its violators were
cynical over Its assumed impotence.
It seemed Impossible of enforce
ment. Slowly the mills of the courts
ground, and only gradually did the ma
jesty of the law assert itself. Many
of its statesmen-authors died before it
became a living force, and they and
others saw the evil grow which they
had hoped to destroy. Now, Its effi
cacy is seen now its power is heavy
now its object is near achievement.
Now we hear tho call for its repeal on
the plea that It interferes with busi
ness prosperity, and we are advised In
most general terms how, by some
other statute and in some other way,
the evil we are just stamping out can
be cured, if we only abandon this work
of twenty years and try another ex
periment for another term of years.
It is said that the act has not don
good. Can this be said in the face of
the effect of the Northern Securities
decree?
That decree was in no way so dras
tic or inhlbitive in detail as either the
Standard Oil decree or the tobacco de
cree but did it not stop for all time
the then powerful movement toward
the control of all the railroads of the
country in a single hand?
Such a one-man power could not
have been a healthful Instance In tho
republic, even though exercised under
the general supervision ot an Inter
state commission.
Do we desire to make such ruthless
combinations and monopolies lawful T|
When all energies are directed, noti
toward the reduction of the cost oti
production for the public benefit by a!
healthful competition, but toward neW
ways and means for making perma
nent in a few hands the absolute con
trol of the conditions and prices pre
vailing In the whole field of industry,
then individual enterprise and effort
will be paralysed and the spirit ot
commercial freedom will be dead.
