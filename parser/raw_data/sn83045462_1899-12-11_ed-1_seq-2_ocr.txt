A.F.0F L. CONVENTION
Nearly Two Hundred Delegates at
the Meeting in Detroit.
VICE PRESIDENT DUNCAN PRESIDES
Herbert J. Greville Welcomes the
Visitors in a Speech.
PRESIDENT GOMPERS'REPORT
DETROIT. Mit h., December 11.-Nearly
!.Fm delegates. representing all branches of
trad- unionisin. with an estimated total
mtebership of nearly SWmpmu. were seated
at writing tables scattered over the floor
of larmonte Hail today when the nine
leent,' annual convention of the American
Federatlon of Labor was called to order.
The first evidence of a contest was ap
parent when the stationary engineers
sought to prevent the seating of the brew
cry employes' representatives. In the ab
sence of both President Gompers and Vice
President McGuire the gathering was
called to order by James Duncan of Balti
more. second vice president. Mr. Duncan
announced that Mr. Gompers was still suf
fering severely from a dislocated knee and
other Injuries rerulting from a recent
wagon and st.eet car collision in Washing
to8, and po-sibly might not be able to at
tend the convention. In compliance with
the federation rules prohibiting speeches by
outsiders, no welcomes were tendered by
officials of the city or state. The only ad
dress of this character was by Herbert J.
Grevilie. president of the Detroit Council
of Trade and Labor 'nIons.
Vice President Duncan Responds.
Vlce President Duncan. responding to the
welcome. said that the convention Is the
largest meeting of organized labor repre
sentatives ever held in the United States,
besides containing affiliated delegates from
.across the sea and from Canada. When
the comminttee on credentials had reported
the seating of the brewery workers was
proested against by representatives of the
Stationary Steam Engineers. The brewery
men retorted by protesting against the cre
xi ntials of the stationary engineers and
firemen. All the other delegates were de
clared seated and the brewers and engin
et rs proceeded to air their strike, label and
other local difficuities before the credentials
committee.
After adoption of a resolution of sym
pathy for President Gompers. the annual
telport of the president was read by Vice
President Duncan.
Coneentrated capital-Trusta.
On the subject of trusts the report says:
We are all conscious of the giant strides
with which industry during the past decade'
has combincd and concentrated into the
n- dern trust. There is considerable differ
ence of opinion, however, as to what is re
gardei by many as an intolerable -vil.
4rganizedi labor is deeply concrned re
gariding the "swift and interse concentra
tion c.t the industries.' and it realizes that
unless sutccessfully confronted by an equai
or superior power'. there-is --conomic danger
and political subj:gation in store for all.
Itut organizozl I -bor looks with apprehen
su.n at the many panaceas and rcnedies
off. red by theorists to cirb the grow !, 1
<1. vlopment. or to destroy the c 'mbina
,i-s of industry. We have see those who
knew littilt of statccraft. and less of eco
temics. ure the ad. ption of laws to "regu
-ittertate commerce. and laws to
prvent- 'ombinations and trusts: and n5e
I als. is .een that thest measures. when
enacted, ha-te be-n the very instruments
to leprive labr of the benefit of organized
-ffxrt. wnil at the same time they have
sinply pro%-d incentives to more subtly
a'ui surelv lubricate the wheels ot capita'is
comblination.
.r or -wn part, we are convinced that
th, state is not capable of preventing the
e- vixpmnt. or the natural concentration
of industry. AU the propAitlois to do so
which havo come under our obscration.
woubl. beyonl doubt, react with greater
fire and injury upon the working people
of our country than upon the trusts.
The great wrongs attributable to the
trusts are their corruptlng influence on the
polities of the country, but as the state
has always been the representative of the
wealth possessors. we shall be compelled
to endure this evil until the toilers are or
ganiz-d and educated to the degree that
they shall know that the state is by right
theirs. and finally and justly come to their
own. while, never relaxing in their efforts
to secure the very best possible economic.
social and material improvement in their
condition.
There k no tenderer or more vulnerable
spot in the anatomy of trusts than their
dividend paying function; there is no power
on earth other than the trade unions which
wields s, potent a weapon to penetrate.
disrupt. and. if necessary, crumble the
whole fabric. This, however. will not be
n-essary. nor will it occur; for the trade
unions will go on organizing, agitating and
enlucating. in order that material improve
ment may keep pace with industrial devel
opment, until the time when the workers,
who will then form nearly the whole peo
ple. develop their ability to administer.
who will then form nearly the whole peq
plh. develop their ability to administer the
fun:tions of government in the interest of
all.
There will be no cataclvsm, but a tran
sition so gentle that most men will wonder
how It all happened.
In the early days of our modern capital
ist system. wh.*n the individual emplover
was the rule under which industry was
conducted. the Individual workmen deemed
thems:xelves sutlicietntly capable to cope for
their rights; when industry developed and
employers formed companies, the work
mien formed unions; when Industry concen
trated Into great combinations. the work
it gmen formed their national and interna
tional unions; as employments became
trustifled. the toilers organized federations
of all unions. local, national and interna
tioal. such as the American Federation of
L~abor.
We shall cotinue to organize and feder
ate the grand army of labor, and with our
mottoes, fewer shours of labor, higher
wages and an elevated standard of life, we
shall establish equal and exact justice for
all.
"0ur New Possessions" and Militarism
A marked change wIthin the recent past
has overcome the pollcy and trend of our
country in Its internatIonal relations. A
humane war. undertaken for the Indepen
dence of Cuba from Spanish domination
and musrule and the circumstances In con
nection therewIth, has been taken advan
tage of to ruthlessly tramsple under foot
every principle upon which our republic was
founded; every tradition which has made
Its naqie sacred to patriots, thinkers and
humantarians, and every pulicy which has
endeared the names of the statesmen,
heroes antd emancipators, have been fla
grantly flung to the wInds. Hawaii is an
nexed in spite of the protests of her peo
ple. Slave-like conditIons of labor obtaIn
there. The agents of the stavemasters are
luring workers to Hawaii to continue In
definitely the slave-like contract conditions
of labor there, where the specficl enforce
meat of the conditions of the contract to
labor are enforcable with the whIp and
the dungeon. Porto 'ico has by armed
fore, been conquered and annexed; Cuba,
promised her freedom anti Independence, Is
held by the armed mIlitary forces of our
country.
tIn Cuba the worxkers s.ught by united
effort to secure some of the adivantages re
sultant from modern cisilxzation; that Is, a
reduction in the hours of their daIly toll;
and upon their request being denied them
by employers, they exercIsed their natural
ard legal rIght to cease work.
The general in command Issued an order
contaIning the most offensive and unjusti
fiable attacks and abuse upon the workers,
w'is eox~ght an amnelloration Is theIr condi
tlr'us and relief from butrdensome toll. The
arrest of every man er.gaged in the strike
was threatensed, asnd an ultimatum glvent
that unless the msen returned to work with
in forty-eight hours after the imuance of
the military order the leaders would be ar
rested. charged with conspiracy or treason
and punisheg in accordlance with the mili
tary code.
Right-Res- 31n1.
The eight-hour law met with defeat. and
uinder moat pec'ullai r cuta -1.be
House passed the bil unanimously. It
failed in the Senate princ aly by reason
of the actions of Senator Kyle of South
on education and labor. Senator Kyle, at
our request, gladly undertook to. ant did.
introduce our eight-hour bill in the Senate.
He first approved the bill, then procrasti
nated the proccodings of the committee.
.then provoked opposition to it, and finally
submitted a minority report against the
bill which he himself introduced. No won
der then that it met its fate, when it re
ceived its death blow -at the hands of its
irtroducer. I am confident'that if there
had been an opportunity for the Senate to
have voted upon the bill it would not have
been defeated.
There have been some who hold that our
eight-hour hill is too far-reaching in Its
effect. In answer to this we say that the
ills from which labor Euffers are far-reach
ing: and the relief or remedies which we
seek to employ must of necessity be equal
in scope. There are many who propose
remedies for all the ills which the human
farily is heir to. yet they can have but
little faith in their propositions. or they
would not antagonize the adoption of the
eight-hour law from the fear of its wide
scope. This convention should insist upon
the.passage of its original proposition and
held to a strict accountability all who have
been, or who may hereafter be, antagonis
tic to it.
PRONOUNCED FRAUDULENT
Decision Against the La Abra Mining
Olaim.
A Famous Case in the Supreme Court
President's Signature During
a Recess Valid.
The United States Supreme Court today
affirmed the opinion of the Court of Claims
in the case of the claim of the La Abra
Silver Mining Company against the republic
of Mexico, holding that claim to be fraudu
lent and unfounded. The claim was for
about $4,000,000.
Bills Signed During Recess.
In passing upon the case the chief justice
incidentally decided that the signature of
the President attached to a bill during a
recess of Congress. if attached within the
constitutional ten days, renders an act so
signed as valid as if Congress were in ses
sion.
The point was raised for the purpose of
attacking the constitutionality of the act
of 192 and authorizing the investigation
of the claims by the Court of Claims.
which was approved during the Christmas
holiday recess of 1892-'9t.
Justice Harlan said the essential require
n'ent was that the Piesident should sign a
bill, and It could not be considered im
portant whether the sigiature was at
tached during a recess or whether Congress
was actually sitting, if the act was done
within the ten days' time allowed for execu
tive examination.
He said, however, that the decision on
this point did not cover the legality of ex
ecutive approval after the final adjourn
ment of Congress, that point not being
raised.
The opinion in the case was handed dowa
by Justice Harlan, who went fully into its
history.
TO Pt NISH WIFE BEATERS.
Bill Proposing to Make Whipping
Fit the Crime.
Spelal Dispatch t. The Erening Sta r.
RICHMOND. Va., December 1.-Dele
gate John Whitehead of Norfolk will in
troduce in the house on Monday a bill
which will excite the liveliest interest. The
bill Provides for the punishment of wife
beaters by whipping, with a specified num
ber of lashes. It will be prepared by Major
Parks of Page. and will be supported by
Delegates Pitcher of Fauiuler, Feather
stone of Campbell and other leaders. Mr.
Whitehead said today that he had long
seen the necessity of such a law. At pres
ent there is nothing for a judge to do but
to se-nd the wife beater toi jail in default of
his tine, and this results in the wife spend
ing hours of hard work sewing or some
thing else, in order to get her husband
free again. He believes the bill will be
come a law.
A petition has been received from several
veterans at the Soldiers lume here, com
plaining that they are farmed out; that
they are roughly treated by the employes
and are poorly fed. They charge that the
institution is not properly run, and they
beg that it be put under a board of visi
tors to be appointed by the state, and taken
from the control of Lee Camp. TW, peti
tion vas brought before the senate by Sen
ator Opie and will be investigated.
Delegate J. M. Whiteheal of Lee county
will shortly introduce a bill designed to
eradicate the widespread practice of pistol
carrying in Virginia. There have been many
shooting affrays lately, and the legislature
recognizes that something more than a fine
is necessary to put a stop to them. The
bill will provide that any magistrate or
justice of the peace may search any party
whom he suspects of having a weaporr
without a search warrant. If his sus
plcions are correct the guilty party is to
be fined $20 and given thirty days in' jail.
Should the offense be committed on elec
tion day the fine is to be $500, with two
years' confinement in the penitentiary.
A bill was introduced in the Senate to
day directed against trusts. It is almost
identical with the Texas law and is a strin
gent measure.
TO DOUBLE GERMANY'S NAVY.
Prince HoheltoUe Announce Govern
ment's Policy in the Reichatag.
BERLIN, Decnber 11.-During the de
bate on the estimates In the reichatag to
day Count von Buelow, the minister of for
-eign affairs, reiterated the terms. of the
various agreements for partitioning Samoa
between the United States and Germany,
for repealing the Samoa act and for sub
mitting to arbitration the losses resulting
from unjustifiable militdtry action upon the
part of officers belongirg to either of the
three states. He said that after assent of
the United States Senate and the bunndes
rath, a bifl ratifying the treaty would be
submitted. In the meanwhile, he hoped the
relchstag would not discuss the matter. He
added that no increese in next year's im
perial budget would arise from the supple
mental estirnates for Samoa.
Prince Hoheniohe, the imperial chancel
lor. then announced that the federal gov
ernments had come to the cor.clusion that
the present navy was insufficient for the
country's needs and that estimates for
doubling the present number of warships
would be submitted.
He added that the- period within which
the increase of the navy would be effected
was not to be fixed by law, the number of
new ships to be provided f'or annually In
the estimates being decided in accordance
with budgetary requirements.
"In this matter," he continued, "the fed
erated goverrnents are acting on the sup
position that in accordance with the general
principles governing the financing of esti
mates the additional vessels will be paid
for by loans.'

DE0ION Or UE ZPIEE COURT
First Prize TaenMiring the Span
OTHER CASES CONSIDERED
The United States Supreme Court today
decided in the naval prize money case
growing out of the capture of the Spanish
steamer Buena Ventura. the first prize of
the war with Spain,. that the condemnation
of the vessel was contrary to the terms of
the Preeldent's procianmtion, and ordered
the proceeds of the sale of the vessel to be
turned over to the owners. In the cases of
the vessels Pedro and Guido, also owned by
Spaniards. the condemnation was affirmed.
The opinion in the case-of the Buena Ven
tura was handed down by Justice Peckham
and turned upmn the construction of the
clause of the President's message of the
25th of April, 1898, exempting Spanish ves
sels in American ports- from the operation
of the proclamation of war until the 21st of
May following. It was shown that the Ven
tura had left an American port on the Gulf
of Mexico on the 19th of April, seven days
before the presidential proclamation was
issued, and that it was eaptured on the 26th
of that month, or the same day in which
the proclamation appeared.
The decision turned upon the point as to
whether the Presidenit's exemption order
applied to Spanish vessels whLch had left
American ports for ports in a neutral
country prior to the Issuance of the procla
mation.
Justice Peckham's opinion held that it
did apply to vessels under this condition.
and that on this account the Ventura.
though owned by a Spanish house, was ex
empt. He said In this connection that the
policy of the United States had always been
one of liberality in such cases, and that
there was no reason for a change of policy
at this time. He therefore held that the
owners were entitled to-the proceeds of the
sale of the vessel. Jusices Gray and Mc
Kenna dissented from the opinion.
The Other Prizes.
The chief justice" delivered the opinion
of the court in the cases of the Pedro and
the Guido and, while.the condemnation of
these vessels was affirmed, there were dis
sents in both instarces. Four ef the nine
members of the court united in a dissent
ing opinion in the Pedro case. This dis
senting opinion was.handed down by Jus
tice White and. was concurred in by Jus
tices Brewer. Shiramnd Peckham.
The chief justice, in ohMI opinion in this
case, stated the facts to be that the Pedro
had left Liverpool in March with a cargo
for Cuban ports.'.with the intention of
afterward proceeding to the t'nited States
for a 'cargo of lumler for her return voy
age. She reache4 Havana April 17, and on
the 221 toolk her departure for Santiag.,
Cuba. and was captured the same day by
the cruiser New York and dttly condemned.
Left After War Opened.
In passing upot the nerits of the case
the chief justice Ited that war had been
practically declared on the 21st, and !iat
the officers of the vessel must have knj wn
this fact.
ie dwelt upon the fact that the vessel
wts llroceeding from a port of the enemy
to another port of the enemy when over
taken. and contended that the cese did not
come under an.y of the exemptions of the
President-s message.
Justcee White. In his dissenting opinion.
called attention to the fact that the Pedro
had been for tie y geaneaged In a regu
lar line of busiPeps helweer .iverpool and
the I'lited States, via Cult. ind said that
the landing of the light -arg,, she carried
to Hadreyt WsA only an'inidotit. as It was
not nea-ly so -mIortant as 'the cargo of
lumber which was: to be -arried fruta the
United States on the rI-turn. He also
urged that Havana harbor was not block
aded when the Pedro left that port.
The Guido case turned upon a similar

FUNK TRIAL BEGINS
Proceedings Before Judge Cole' in
Criminal Oaurt No. 2.
REG1AR JURY PANEL EXHAUSTED
One Hundred Talesmen to Be Spe
cially Summoned.
THE CRIME CHARGED
Soon after the session of Crimina' Court
No. 2 opened today United States Attorney
Anderson announced that the government
was ready to proceed with the case of
Frank W. Funk, indicted for the murder of
William H. Brooks. It was stated that the
defense also was ready, and the work of
impaneling a jury was thereupon com
menced. At the end of three hours the
twenty-six members of the regular jury
panel of the court had been examine-l.
Only ten members retained seats in the
box, and to challenges had been exercised.
The cour irected an adjournment until
tomorro~ iorning at tO o'clock, the United
States marshal in the meantime to sum
mon 100 talesmen.
To judge front the state of affairs today
it is not thoight a jury will be secured un
til Wednesday, or possibly Thursday. The
question of the qualifications of jprors is
being gone into more fully than heretofore.
Justice Cole is presiding at the trial, Attor
neys D. W. Baker, Alexander Wolf and
Newton C. Price appear for the -defendant.
and United States 'Attorney Anderson and
Assisrant United States Attorney Taylor
are conducting the prosecution.. The
hearing Is being held in the room usually
occupied by Crimiral Court No. 1. for the
reason that it is of larger size than the
room assigned as Criminal Court No. 2.
Although appearing somewhat pale and
wan. due, no doubt, to the confinement in
jail, Funk seemed to be in the best of spir
its today. He was deeply interested in all
that transpired and smiled frequently. His
entry into the court room was followed by
an emotional outburst on the part of one
of the female witnesses.
The CrIme Alleged.
As is generally well known. the crime for
which Funk is being tried was the killing
of William H. Brooks. about C o'clock the
evening of June 23, ItIS, at 914 22d street.
Brooks, a veteran of the civil war, was sev
enty-three years of age. He was beaten to
dcath in his room. the implement used lie
ing a small ax. When his body was found
his wife was lying near hy in what was
thought to be a dying condition.
The surgeons at the Emergency Hospital.
to which institution she was taken, found
five depressed fractures on the skull of
Mrs. Brooks. It was thought at the time
that nothing short of a miracle could save
her life. She survived. hiiwever. but coul.i
tell nothing of what had occurred. The dis
covery was made by George 4.arson. who.
when he went to the room which was the
scene of the murder. found the door bolted
on the outide.
That robbery was the motive for the
crime-was attested boy the fact that in the
neighborhood of Sl.oti had been taki from
a false pocket t-rn boy Mrs. Brooks about
her waist.
Funk Suspected.
Suspicion pointed to Funk as the murder
er. It was found that he had left the city
the evening of the murder and, before de
parting, hid changed bloody clothes for
new garments. lie was apprehended at
Columbia, Mo., last August, more than a
year after the killing. The defendant do
nies that he murdered Brooks. His con
tention is that he obtainel the money from
a daughter of the mureared man. and knew
nothing of the murder until he read a
newspaper account of it while in New
York. He stoutly maintains that he is not
guilty under the indictment.
