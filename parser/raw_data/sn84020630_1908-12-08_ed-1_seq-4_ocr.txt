BENEFICIAL PROVISIONS OF ;!THE
STATEHOOD-BILL.
MORE TREES SHOULD BE
PLANTED.
Meteorological and climatic observa
tions by experienced meteorologists
and scientists seem to have demon
strated that the climate of the state
of Kansas, which up to ten years ago
in the western portions of the state,
was very dry. and very hot, with but
little moisture and rain, has become
much more moist, and humid, and this
beneficial result is ascribed to the
planting of millions of trees in the
farming sections of the state. There
teems to be much to substantiate this
claim and the Kansas City Times dis
cuses it very intelligently and ably.
What can be done and has been
done in the Sunflower state will be ac
complished in the Sunshine Territory,
which contains many high mountain
ranges that are well timbered and at
tract moisture. In many sections in
this territory where it was thought
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
It -is a different Roosevelt who
speaks in his message to Congress to
day from the Roosevelt of seven years
ago, or even two years ago. It is a
Roosevelt mature In years and
thought, a Roosevelt who is mellow
where he formerly was aggressive, a
Roosevelt judicial where he was at
one time academic. What a loss to
this Nation, that the President had not
arrived seven years ago, from where
he speaks today; and what a gain it
would be if the Nation could have the
command of hits experience and his
wisdom for the next seven years.
The message is in greater part de
voted to the corporations, the courts,
labor and the 'preservation of the for
ests. Outside of these four topics it
is brief, concise, emphatic. The rec
ommendations for positive legislation
are few; in fact, the state paper is
less a message to Congress than it
is a sermon to the American people; a
ton voors am tn "1'fnv rrtllt
tmIiri for limberthere are! Judicial opinion rather than a demand
now manv thousands of such and the
fruit trees especially are doing splen
didly and the fruit crop In many sec
tions of this territory hai become very
valuable and important. What has
been accomplished in Western Kansas
can be done in New Mexico if the peo
ple will put the same intelligence, the
same labor, and the same care into
fruit tree planting aud timber tree
cultivation.
The Kansas City Times editorial is
very instructive and hence the New
Mexican republishes it herewith for
the information of the many thousands
of farmers and new settlers who are I
coining into New Mexico. The Times
Bays:'
"The rainfall in Kansas during the
present year exceeding that of any
other year in the history of the State
so far as the official "Snow records"
of the State University reveal, has re
vived the discussion in that state of
the old. old Question: Are the seasons
changing in Kansas?
"Undoubtedly the weather conditions
have been materially altered within
thfi nast twentv-five years. The high
winds during the spring and . fall
months that formerly swept the cen
tral and western part of the state have
noticeably decreased in violence and
frequency, and it has been many years
since the people of that part of Kan
sas witnessed one of the old-time "dust
storms."
"The careful students of weather
conditions attribute this change to the
growth of trees by the farmers. Prac
tically every farm noire is now sur
rounded by a grove, and the driveways
are lined with trees that have at
tained dignified proportions.
"The annual and consistent increase
in rainfall is also ascribed by the same
authorities to tree cultivation, supple
mented by artificial lakes and ponds
which together create conditions that
produce, rain.
"The hot winds, which were former
ly so common to the state and were
altogether, the most disastrous visita
tions suffered in pioneer days, have,
within the past ten years, become al
most unknown in the agricultural dis
tricts. "The trees again!
"It has been demonstrated to prac
tically a scientfic conclusion that the
tree culture In Kansas has been the
paramount factor in the elimination of
the hot winds.
"The state i? no longer the "treeless'
waste" described by the early geogra
pher and historian. Still, it lacks the
systematic, scientific effort In the cul
ture of forestry that the state's knowl
edge of the tremendous value of such!
a movement warrants.
"The forthcoming Legislature is
pledged to progressive measures in be
half of forestry. Kansas should de
mand that the ipledge toe fulfilled, and
that the measure should provide for a
substantial beginning in forestry cul
tivation upon a broad and comprehen
sive scheme, and not merely as an
"experiment."
"Kansas has had quite enougn ex
perience in tree growing to know that
It Is a mighty good Investment."
Tinder the provisions ot the AndtV.ws.
statehood blil every county In. the ter
ritory will be greatly benefited by' the
many favorable provisions for the ben
efit, of the people contained therein.
Specially will this be the case with
Santa Fe anil Grant counties and the
remainder of the counties ure also ben-J
eficially remembered in donations ofi
public lands for the settlement of their
d'ebts. The passage of the statehood
bill means an Increase of va ue in
Santa Fe city and county properties
alone of 100 and more per cent and
fixes the capital here for the next 20
year?, a long time, Indeed, ahead. It
provides for the establishment , and j
maintenance of a manual training
school in this city which if estab
lished will be a source of great benefit
to the people and of much good to.
this city. An appropriation of public.
lands for the maintenance and sup
port of the Archaeological School of
the United States in this city is also
made in the bill and its location will
also be productive of great good and
will bring thousands of scientists, tour
ists and sightseers ts the capital of
New Mexico. The bill has been intro
duced and is being pushed strongly
for passage. President Roosevelt has
recommended its passage by the con
gress now in session. It looks very
much indeed as if by this time next
year New Mexico will be a sovereign
state in this great Union.
THE RIGHT IDEA.
The Carlsbad Argus lias the right
idea concerning the adoption of the
constitution for the future state of New
Mexico and voices this in the follow
ing sensible editorial:
"It now appears certain that the ter
ritory will be admitted at the special
session, though it is not at all un
likely that the wish of President
Roosevelt that it be accomplished
at the short session will be gratified.
It will be a difference of only a few
weeks either way, and It is this fact
that makes wise the present discus
sion of essential features of the state
constitution, part in which is being

There has been a change in the ed

er published at Estancia, the county
seat of Torrance county, conducted
during the past year by C. W. Coombs.
Mrs. R. N. Maxwell, an experienced
printer and writer, has again assumed
charge of the paper, and will improve
It in many ways. She was the former
owner and sold out to Mr. Coombs
about a year ago. The change will
prove for the benefit of Estancia and
Torrance country. Mrs. Maxwell can

A FAIRER ASSESSMENT DE
MANDED. The coming legislative assembly will
be asked to cope with the perrennial
assessment and taxation problem.
While much better assessment meth
ods prevail than ever before and the
collection of taxes is more thorough
than at any time before in the history
of the commonwealth, yet, New Mex
ico does not make the assessment
showing that it should and its tax
rate Is apparently too .high, unless it
is considered in connection with the
low assessment rate. When one coun
ty in Texas, bordering on New Mexico,
that of El Paso, shows a total assess
ment two thirds that of the entire
territory, then it will he readily ack
nowledged that either the assessment
rate is too low ov too much property
escapes assessment and Its just share
of taxation. With a probable limit to
the tax rate by the state constitution,
should New Mexico become a state,
the territorial legislature will be mere
ly preparing the way by the passage
of laws that will assure a uniform
and reasonable assessment rate. . I
too thorough understanding of the
principles of government that will be
embodied in the document, and after
the Christmas holidays we are going
to try to outline some principles that
appear to be necessary In the basic
formation of the legal code, in order
that the new state may avoid the mis
takes of some of the older common
wealths. It is a sure cinch that we
are going to have the best governed
state in the American commonwealth,
and it is a fact that the first step
toward it must be the constitution." , ' ,
for new and radical legislation.
The topics touched upon besides the
three main subjects mentioned are:
Finances, labor, Inland waterways, na
tional parks, denatured alcohol, pure
food, Indian service, secret , service,
postal savings banks, parcels post, ed
ucation, censais, redistribution of bu

j most of these are dismissed with a
j paragraph, while more than one half
of the message is devoted to a preach
ment upon the four main subjects
above indicated. His views upon all
of these subjects are so well known
that it is idle to discuss them except
each one by one and in detail. To
New Mexico this short ' paragraph
looms above all others and earns1 the
gratitude of every person in the Ter
ritory as the fulfillment of the promise
made by Roosevelt ten years ago at
the Rough Riders' Reunion in Las Ve
gas: '
"I advocate the immediate admission
of New Mexico and Arizona as states.
This should be done at the present ses
sion of the Congress. The people of
the two territories have made it evi
dent by their votes that they will not
come in as one state. - The only alter
native is to admit them as two, and I
trust that this will be done without de
lay."
However, the entire message is
worthy of more than being merely
read. It gives food for deep thought,
a decade LeDce it will be regarded as
a prophecy. Today, its major portions,
to those who approve of what is said,
as does the New Mexican, need no
editorial elucidation, they are the best
editorial in themselves that could be
written upon conditions in American
affairs thaf demand the attention of
lnw makers, and, in fact, of every
other citizen.
The 38th territorial legislature meets
in this city on the third Monday of
next month and will have much Im
portant legislative business to accom
plish. The Daily New Mexican will
print the full proceedings of the body
daily and will keep its readers and the
people thoroughly posted on all legis
lative affairs and doings. Every cltl
zen who desires to know what la" go
ing on in the assembly and to keep
posted should promptly subscribe for
the Daily New Mexican or the Weekly
New Mexican Review or the Spanish
edition published by the New Mexican
Printing company, El Neuvo Mexicano
and read either of the papers that he
may know what is going on in legisla
tive circles and what the members
of the legislative assembly will do in
the matter of passing needed and ben
eficial legislation for the government
of the people of the Sunshine Territory.

The Colorado legislature will be

lieve state officials from the duty of
serving on state hoards. The New
Mexico legislature . should move for
ward in the same direction. The gov
ernor, the secretary of the Territory,
the superintendent of public instruc
tion and other officials, whose duties
demand all their time, and frequent ab
sence from their office, should not be
asked to serve on boards, unless this
duty is prescribed by federal law.
There are always a sufficient number
of capable citizens willing to accept
the honor of serving on a territorial

pense, and these should be given the
opportunity to serve the common
wealth with their experience and enthusiasm.

. From the reports of the different
land offices in . the territory it is
learned that the settlement of public
lands Is constantly going on and that
many hundreds of new settlers are
coming steadily into the territory for
the purpose of making their future
homes here. There are still many
acres of public land here that can be
used for farming purposes successfully
if these are so situated that they can
be irrigated. The results assure fine
fruit crops and cereals as well as veg
etables can . and will be raised. It
has also been established that in many
sections where the rainfall is small
crops can be raised by the use of the
dry culture system, by thorough culti
vation and deep plowing.
