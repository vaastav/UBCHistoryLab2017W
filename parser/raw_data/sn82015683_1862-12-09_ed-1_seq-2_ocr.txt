We are happy to notice that the Secretary
recommends a return to liie constitutional cur
rency as speedily as possible. On this point he
sagaciously remarks:
The Secretary recommends, therefore, no more
paper money rcheme; but, on tho contrary, a
series ol measures looking to a afe and gradual
return to gold and rilver as the only permanent
basis, st u dard and me uure of articles recoiizetl
by the Constitution between whitllTttid an irre
deemable paper currency, as he believe, the
choice is now to be made.

Abolition Union Appeal in Memphis, has pob

provided he gets up earlier, I took the Mur-.
freesboro pike, and soon came to the l'rovot
(uanl's station. Confiding in my horse's equip
ments, and a bit of impudence, put on for the
occasion, I came to a military lope, and gave a
military salute, whereupon the guard came to a
present arm?, and I ran the blockade safe!.
But it was no go on in v return. I had rode some
fitteen miles, and old Bay was tlow t start on
the lope, and that inevitable "Halt!" brought me
op standing. I fumbled around for some papers,
and after due parley I got through.
My ride had several items of interest. In ad
dition to hunting up some regimenu with whom
I had business, it opened my eyes to some pe
culiarilies of Southern life which I had no where
een. The city and it surroundings are pro
verbial for their beauty, both natural and rli
ficial, and here msy be seen the perfection offtvle
in architecture and Sonthern agriculture. Due
allowance must of course be ma:e fr the ravages
of war for rom nine months, for until the oc
cupancy oT this city by oi.r troops 1 ist March, it
was as far removed from war influences as Indi
anapolis. It was nn interior city and felt war
on rcmotelv.
i have spoken of the city and its dilapidation.
The more I travel through it the more manifest
the contra.xt becomes. There was nothing, until
the war came, that should given Nashville any
less l'reshne and cleanliness than Indianapolis,
Dayton or Columbus; yet. all through it, in the
center, on the most fashionable streets, no less
than in the suburbs, are dilapidated log buildings,
unpuinted fences and window shutters, and every
thing else which indicates that peculiarity of
Southern life that I had not expected. I had
re id in "Uucle Tom" and other novels, such
gorgeous descriptions of plendor all of which
may be true once in a million cases that I had
not expected to find it so wanting.
Theie are farms almost unmolested, though
they are rare. The fences are a curiosity. They
are made chiefly of cedar. More tha'n half are
made by sharpening one end and driving the rails
some eighteen inches in the ground. These rails
vary from four feet to eleven, and are kept in a
somewhat straight line by nailing cedar board
along it seme live feet from the ground. Very
rarely the to pa are sawed off, so na to leave a
tegular hight ol some five or six feet, and some
times they are sharpened, reminding one ol the
wisdom of Mrs. Partington, who said she didn't
pee how a soldier could sleep on the pickets, es
pecially if the sharp end was up. These fences,
when sawed -off so as to present u uniform hight,
are very neat and very durable, though I do not
fully credit the statement of a native that they
last forever and turn to stone, as has often been
verified in this vicinity.
Oiten these pickets are composed of round
sticks ol uniform dimensions, say about thiee
inches in diameter, with the limbs trimmed, leav
ing about an inch to the picket, which is taste
fully rounded off. This makes a beautiful yard
fence. But the prevailing style is that ol insert
ing split rails, say ten or eleven feet long, leaving
the upper ends ragged, and a fence for miles,
nine or ten feet high. Where the wotm fence is
adopted, the stakes, instead of being of our style,
lying across the corners, are set perpendicular
and held together at the top by a cedar bo ml,
though which they are inserted, and cn which
the "rider" is laid. There must tea deal ol per
manency in this that we could never obtain out
of oar oaks, for in old fences I found the stakes
and "riders," for the most part, in as good order
as anything else on the farm. It is said that a
majority of the cedar rails in this immediate city
n re foty years old. They may not be, but cer
tainly cedar is good material for rails, and it is
said that they burn freely. This I have no occa
sion for doubting, judging from the appearance
of tires along thj road and the unfenced fields
nearby. T. A. 0.

1 esterday I took a ride to Fort Negier, built
on the summit ot a hill ri the south ede of
town known as St. Cloud Hill, ami overlook
ing the countrv for miles, and also the city. The
fort is garrisoned by the 12th Indiana battery,
and will be, when finished, one ot the most com
plete wotks of defense ever built iu this region
It is believed that no forces could approach the
city from any direction with this fort well
maimed. They hive tuns there already which
command a radius of three miles. West of this
is Fort Confiscation, so named because the hill
on which it is situated has been confiscated. By
what authority I know not, but suiely not bv the
so called confiscation act of Congress. I have
not seen that law for a long while, but I hive a

Wendeil rhilüps.in his recent political address
here, admitted thit the Wet was even now pre
paring to go wih the i-inth. One could hear
talk of it all through the western coui.trj. 1 he
Wet did not love the Hist. It did not love ne
groes. It did not love hich tariff.. If disunion
became a fixed fact, the West would follow the
South. New England and New Yoik would be
left out in the cold.
Oar belief is, that iVrtr England alone will be
left out in the cold. We mi id. vear ro. that if
separation came, a new Confederacy would fol-
low, and that it would not embrace N'ew Knc-
land. We have not changed our belief on this
point. Indeed, it is every day strengthened; and
we entertain no doubt that the Wett itselj would
object to our Company if it stiould be offered.
New York will belong to the new Republic, if
one is established. Certainly it will seek to; and
we see no reison why both South and West
should not unite in desiring her presence. But
New England, with her Alo!itionism and her po
litical prie-ts the hot-bed of all the isms, and
the author of our great calamity the everlast
ing beggar for protective tariffs will he objected
to, and will be excluded. The old Union once
gone, it can never belong to another, unless, per
chanee, it finds fur herself and is forced to ac
cept the same condition ol dependency which she
is now preaching for the South. No other sec
tion will want her on terms of equality.
And this is the finale to which this Adminis
tration is now driving us. It is every day render
ing a restoration of the Union mre and more
difficult. Instead of acting upon the recent ex
pressions of sentiment bv the people at the ballot-
box, it is defying this great source of power, and
exhibit!? the utmost contempt for popular con
demnation.
Lincoln, the President, is represented as saying
lhat he would sooner die thousand deaths than
withdraw his Abolition proclamation, and as at
taching lar more importance to the result of the
election in Missouri a result secured by his hire
lings at the point of the bayonet, and by a terror
m which kept more than two fifths of all the vo
ters from the polls than a-ll the other elections
which had takeu place during the 3 ear. He re
joices over a verdict thus tdiameluliy obtained.
in a State where he desires to introduce, in a
practical shape, the fire-brand of emancipation,
and spurns with contempt the honest condemna
tion of his conduct which comes to him wiih the
indorsement of fifteen millions of Northern peo
ple! He removes the ablest General in the arm v.
with no other than a political motive, and declares
his intention to thrust out every officer who dares
criticise his conduct. He empties Forts Warren
and L.favette of political prisoners, without a
word of apology or explanation to their victims,
and without the moral courace to rescind the un
constitutional order under which they were, nnd
others probably will be, ariested. Ho throws
himself, body and soul, into the embraces of the
Greeleys nnd Lovejoya of the partr which elect
ed him, and defies the honest men who h ive sup
porteu the Uovernment to change his policy, or
avert the final calamity to which radicalism is
tending.
This is our position. The hone of the Union
is every hourprowing fainter, until a majority of
the people of the North at last look upon separa
tion or revolution as a certainty. We have al
lowed personal rights and State rights to be
tra moled upon we have allowed the country to
be noooeU with a currency whicn, five years
hence, will not be worth the paper upon which it
is printed we have submitted to ttxation such
as Americans before never dreamed of we have
offered up hundreds of thousands of valuable
lives. And what have we gained? Why. go
hopeless is our cause to-day. tliat the people of
the West, as Wendell Phillips truly said, are
making their arraneem nta to follow the South!
They will follow the South, and so will the mid
tile Slates, if the Union is sundered: nnd that it
will be sundered if the President adheres to his
determination to make this n Abolition war after
the first of January, is as certain as that the sun

Our lo-s was between fifty and sixty killed and

We resume our review of some of the mot
celebrated css.iys written during the early d.iysof
the Nation's history, in reference to the i?ue of
paper money. In our former articles on this
theme, we m;ide no partisan appeal, and only
alluded to the present condition of things eo far
as to show tint there was no point now in dispute
w hich had not been dicufed in the old contro
versy. We might have gone further an 1 illus
trated this assertion by showing that the oppo
nents of the Government paper money theory, al
though among the first patriots in the land, were
assailed before the close of the eighteenth cen
turv, bv the same coarse terms of abuse used by
political organs in these days; and when their ar
guments were too stiong for refutation, their
motives w ere denounced, after the same uncour
teous fashion.
Wc promised in our last to introduce our read
ers to a sericsof essays written in North Carolina.
These were republished in Philadelphia in Au
gust, 1787. The author admits that money ban
heroine inconvementlv scarce, and "the difficulty
of paying debts has leen very common." Cer
tainly, he dli. when nur article ia scarce, the
trcnerul remedy is to make more; and if it shall
be found when money is scarce, that private and
public debts can he honorably discharged by a new
emission of paper, the expe ient h admirable, for
it is the most easy process by which debts were
ever paid .'
The author assumes, without any attempt at
proof, that it is wi-e to be hone.-t; and itnme
diately asks whether t lie issues in riue-stiol, are
not prohibited by this consideration. A paper
cunency, which is a legal lender when it may be
depreciated 20 or 30 per cent., he thinks is not
generally considered an honest tender; and he
adds many reasons why fuc-Ii a currency will not
in the sequel prove useful to the States. There
are many people, he add, who sty that the
money ought not to hive depreciated; they say
that necessity ju.-litled the manufacture; and they
argue that we are bound to receive such payment
is the law prescribes. But will any man pay that
it would be perfect justice to pas a law by which
every creditor should be compelled to rot tixe
three fouri hs, or two-third of his debt, instead
of the whole debt? And yet Mich a law would
be perfectly similar to the tender of depreciated
paper, except that it would be a proof of more
frugality and plan dealing; for it would be f illing
things by the right name, and would save the ex
pense of paper coinage. Our author goes on to
insist tint however convenient depreciated piper
money may appear to thoe who use it in the dis
charge of debts, he is certain that the credit as
wed hs the finances of the country is injured bv
it; and this injury and suffering will continue and
increase until the cause is removed.
He does not argue against the use of bank
notes, or confound these with an inconvertible
paper currency. When a person has the option to
refuse or receive the paj er.and knows that he can
exchange it for gold, he may prefer it. But it
uever was found (and he questions if it ever will
tie!) that banknotes could be circulated at par
unless w hen it was believed that they might be
exchanged for solid monev; nor could they be so
circulated if they were declared to be a legal
tender. The reason is obvious the whole value
is imaginary, and men do not believe by comptil
m'oii. Every attempt to force a man to believe
thatpajer is equal in value to coin, implies a
consciousness that it is not eqiiil. Our author
goes on to prove these propositions at great
length, but we need not follow him. Tlie bet
proof is the fact that the very issue against
which lie wns then contending, furnished h:s vin
dication in its own history.
Writing with the full consciousness tint he
was advocating greit principles, whose outwork
hi: no law of man could let or hinder, he pic
tures the unfriendliness to industry, the injury to
the poor, the damage to good morals, the in fit
tion and overthrow of credit, the burden of tax
ation on the fiugal and temperate, in favor of the
idle, the profligate and luxurious, and the gradual
exportation ot sp ecie from the country.
All this was nothing but prophecy as it
dropi ed from his pen; but the final result might
h ie sat for it before the painter, and never ob
tained so true a likeness. A depreciated piper
currency made a legal tender, he declares to be
the poor expedient of a day, tending in its inevi
table lesults to the destruction not only of prop
ertv, but of the Government it-elf. "If it is
true that men have not virtue enough to bear
a Government that is perfectly free, the proof
is like to come from that quirt er! The re
lief given by paper money is neither durable nor
honest."
We commend these thoughts, garnered for us
in it patriotic age. to the attention of the people
ol this day and generation. PJxpdients for a
day are only the floundering of little minds in
a sea of trouble, where honesty and courage are
the only saviors. We are now involved, and
must perpe'uate the mischief, i the argument of
moral w eakness caught in a delinquency which is
thus nude the excne for further wrong. The
people luve been patient during the past veir,
but the mass are too intelligent not to see the evil
and dinger, and those who hive this matter in
hand cannot escape their full measure of rc-pon
sibilily. They did not run into this danger in the
dark, for niuiy warning voices were uttered. If
thev persevere in a cour:e fraught onlv with evil,
they must rot complain that they are he'd re- !
