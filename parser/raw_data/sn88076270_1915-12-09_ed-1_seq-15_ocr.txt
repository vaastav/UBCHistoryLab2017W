National Preparedness Main
Theme of Head of Nation.
Submits Definite Plan to In
crease Present Standing Force
of Regulars and For Four Hun
dred Thousand Citizen Soldiers
Raised In Increments of One
Hundred and Thirty-three
Thousand.
FOLLOWING
is the message of
President Wilson delivered at a
joint session of the senate and
house at the beginning of the
Sixty-fourth congress:
Gentlemen of the Congress—Since I
last had the privilege of addressing
you on the state of the Union the war
of nations on the other side of the sea,
which had then only begun to disclose
its portentous proportions, has extend
ed its threatening and sinister scope
until it has swept within its llaine
some portion of every quarter of the
globe, not excepting our own hemi
sphere, has altered the whole face of
international affairs, and now presents
a prospect of reorganization and re
construction such as statesmen and
peoples have never been called upon
to attempt before.
The president tells how this country
practiced neutrality and declares that
he hopes that when the time comes
for readjustment and recuperation this
country will be of infinite service. Re
ferring to Central and South American
problems, the president dec-lares that
we should retain unabated the spirit
which has inspired us throughout the
whole life of our government and
which was so frankly put into words
by President Monroe.
We have been put to the test in the
case of Mexico, and we have stood the
test. Whether we have benefited Mex
ico by the course we have pursued re
mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in
her own hands. But we have at least
proved that we will not take advan
tage of her in her distress and under
take to impose upon her an order and
government of our own choosing. Lib
erty is often a fierce and intractable
thing, to which no bounds can be set
and to which no bounds of a few
men's choosing ought ever to be set.
Every American who has drunk at
the true fountains of principle and tra
dition must subscribe without reserva
tion to the high doctrine of the Vir
ginia bill of rights, which in the great
days in which our government was set
up was everywhere among us accept
ed as the creed of free men. That doc
trine is, "That government is or ought
to be instituted for the common bene
fit, protection and security of the peo
ple, nation or community that "of
all
the various modes and forms of
government, that Is the best which Is
capable of producing the greatest de
gree of happiness and safety and is
most effectually secured against the
danger of maladministration, and that
when any government shall be found
Inadequate or contrary to these pur
poses a majority of the community
hath an Indubitable, inalienable and
Indefeasible right to reform, alter or
abolish it in such manner as shall be
judged most conducive to the public
weal." We have unhesitatingly ap
plied that heroic principle to the case
of Mexico and now hopefully await
the rebirth of the troubled republic,
which had so much of which to purge
itself, and so little sympathy from any
outside quarter in the radical but nec
essary process. We will aid and be
friend Mexico, but we will not coerce
her, and our course with regard to her
ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer
ica that we seek no political suzerainty
or selfish coutrol.
PAN-AMERICANISM HAS
NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT.
Economic Adjustments Inevitable With
in the Next Generation.
The moral is that the states of Amer
ica are not hostile rivals, but co-op
erating friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community of interest,
alike in matters political and in mat
ters economic, is likely to give them a
new significance as factors in interna
tional affairs and in the political his
tory of the world. It presents them as
in a very deep and true sense a unit
in world affairs, spiritual partners,
standing together because thinking to
gether, quick with common sympathies
and common ideals. Separated, they
are subject to all the cross currents of
the confused politics of a world of hos
tile rivalries united in spirit and pur
pose. they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
This is pan-Americanism. It has none
of the spirit of empire In it. It is the
embodiment, the effectual embodiment,
of the spirit of law and independence
and liberty and mutual service.
The president calls attention to the
meeting In Washington recently of
representatives of the pan-American
republics and says that economic ad
justment is inevitable in the next gen
eration.
No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people for whom we
are appointed to speak can fail to per
ceive that their passion is for peace,
their genius best displayed In the prac
tice of the arts of peace. Great democ
racies are not belligerent. They lo not
peek nr desire war Their thought 1=

of individual liberty and of the free
labor that supports life and the un
censored thought that quickens it.
Conquest and dominion are not in our
reckoning or agreeable to our princi
ples. But just because we demand un
molested development and the undis
turbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent, from whatever
quarter it may come, the aggression we
ourselves will not practice. We Insist
upon security in prosecuting our self
chosen lines of national development.
We do more than that. We demand it
also for others. We do not confine our
enthusiasm for individual liberty and
free national development to the Inci
dents and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel it wher
ever there Is a people that tries to walk
In these difficult paths of independence
and right. From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
of liberty on this side the sea and have
deemed it as important that our neigh
bors should be free from all outside
domination as that we ourselves should
be have set America aside as a whole
for the uses of independent nations and
political freemen.
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a peo
ple against aggression. And we are
as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dicta
torial power within our own nation
as of aggression from without. We
will not maintain a standing army ex
cept for uses which are as necessary
in times of peace as in times of war.
SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN
FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.
Increase Standing Regular Force—Four
Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers.
But war has never been a mere mat
ter of men and guns. It is a thing
of disciplined might. If our citizens
are ever to fight effectively upon a
sudden summons, they must know
how modern fighting is done, and what
to do when the summons comes to
render themselves immediately avail
able and immediately effective. And
the government must be their servant
in this matter, must supply them with
the training they need to take care of
themselves and of it The military
arm of their government, which they
will not allow to direct them, they may
properly use to serve them and make
their independence secure, and not
their own independence merely, but
the rights also of those with whom
they have made common cause, should
they also be put in jeopardy. They
must be fitted to play the great role
in the world, and particularly in this
hemisphere, for which they are quali
fied by principle and by chastened am
bition to play.
It is with these ideals in mind that
the plans of the department of war for
more adequate national defense were
conceived which will be laid before
you, and which I urge you to sanction
and put into effect as soon as they can
be properly scrutinized and discussed
They seem to me the essential first
steps, and they seem to me for the
present sufficient
They contemplate an Increase of the
standing force of the regular army
from its present strength of 5,023 offi
cers and 102,985 enlisted men of all
services to a strength of 7,136 officers
and 134.707 enlisted men, or 141.843
all told, all services, rank and file, by
the addition of fifty-two companies of
coast artillery, fifteen companies of en
gineers, ten regiments of infantry, four
regiments of field artillery and four
aero squadrons, besides 750 officers re
quired for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all important
duty of training the citizen force of
which I shall presently speak. 792 non
commissioned officers for service In
drill, recruiting and the like and the
necessary quota of enlisted men for
the quartermaster corps, the hospital
corps, the ordnance department and
other similar auxiliary services. These
The program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
five years of ten battleships, six battle
cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de
stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coast submarines, four gun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni
tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one
repair ship. It is proposed that of this
number we shall the first year provide
for the construction of two battleships,
two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers,
fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,
twenty-five coast submarines, two gun
boats and one hospital ship the second
year two battleships, one scout cruiser,
ten destroyers, four fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat
and one fuel oil ship the third year
two battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet
submarines and fifteen coast subma
rines the fourth year two battleships,
two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one ammuni
tion ship and one fuel oil ship, and
the fifth year two battleships, one bat
tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de
stroyers. two fleet submarines, fifteen
coast submarines, on* gunboat, one am
munition ship and one repair ship.
The secretary of the uavy Is asking
also for the Immediate addition to the
personnel of the navy of 7.500 sailors.
2,500 apprentice seamen and 1,500 ma
rines. This increase would be suffi
cient to care for the ahlps which are
to be completed within the fiscal year
1917 and also for the nrmber of men
which must be put ir training to man
the ships which win be completed
early in 1918. It is also n- essarv that
the number of midshipmen at the Na
val academy at Annapolis should be
Increased by at least 300 in order that
the force of officers should be more
rapidly added to, and authority is ask
ed to appoint, for engineering duties
only, approved graduates of engineer
ing colleges, and for service in the avi
ation corps a certain number of men
taken from civil life.
If this full program should be carried
out we should have built or building in
1921. according to the estimates of sur
vival and standards of classification
followed br the renern1 honrl of the

are the additions necessary to render
the afmy adequate for its present du
ties, duties which It has to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders and at our interior
army posts, but also In the Philippines,
In the Hawaiian Islands, at the Isth
mus and in Porto Rico.
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part of its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale
should occasion arise the plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
by a force of 400,000 disciplined citi
zens, raised in increments of 1153,000 a
year throughout a period of three
years. This it is proposed to do by a
process of enlistment under which the
serviceable men of the country would
be asked to bind themselves to serve
with the colors for purposes of train
ing for short periods throughout three
years and to come to the colors at call
at any time throughout an additional
"furlough" period of three years. This
force of 400.000 men would be pro
vided with personal accouterments as
fast as enlisted and their equipment
for the field made ready to be supplied
at any time. Tliey would be astern
a in in a a a Is at
a in as so at on it
suitable units of the regular army
Their period of annual training would
not necessarily exceed two months in
the year.
The president says it is up to the
patriotic young men of the country to
respond to this call.
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
FOR GREATER NAVY.
Always Looked to It as Our First and
Chief Line of Defense.
The program which will be laid be
fore you by the secretary of the uavy
is similarly conceived. It Involves only
a shortening of the time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
out, but It does make definite and ex
plicit a program which has heretofore
been only implicit, held In the minds of
the committees on naval affairs and
disclosed in the debates of the two
houses, but nowhere formulated or for
mally adopted. It seems to me very
clear that it will be to the advantage
of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the
navy upon a final footing of strength
and efficiency and to press that plan
to completion within the next five
years. We have always looked to the
navy of the country as our first and
chief line of defense we have always
seen it to be our manifest course of
prudence to be strong on the seas.
Year by year we have been creating a
navy which now ranks very high In
deed among the navies of the maritime
nations. We should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete what
we have begun and how soon.
