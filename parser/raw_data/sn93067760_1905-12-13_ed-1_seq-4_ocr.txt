LAURENS, S. C, Dec. 13, 1905.
About one year ago the price of cot
ton dipped to a point below seven cents.
The ginner'8 report showed a crop bor
dering on fourteen million bales?by far
the largest ever made.
We confess that we thought then
that the notion of the price climbing to
ten cents before the coming in of an
other crop seemed to us foolish. We
were mistaken.
It is just as reasonable, more rea
sonable perhaps, for cotton to sell at 15
cents the pound in June 1906 than it
was for it to sell at 10 cents in June
1905. Nevertheless, if we had cotton
we would take eleven cents for it.
However, if there is a man in Lau
rens county who thinks he knows more
about cotton than The Advertiser, we
entirely agree with him. We are sure
he does.

Laurens is about the only town of
importance not scheduled for a court
house in the bills that have been intro
duced Congress, providing for the
establishment of a United States Court
in the Western District of South Caro
lina.
One of the first bills passed at the
present session of Congress was the
voting of an appropriation of eleven
million dollars toward the construction
of the Panama Canal. The amount, it
is said, will carry on the work until the
first of March.
President Roosevelt's annual message
to Congress, containing twenty-two
thousand words, was read, last Tues
day.
PATENT MEDICINE ADS.
Our able brother of The Laurens Ad
vertiser, whose head is so level that
quick silver wouldn't run off of it, may
depend upon the Press and Banner
agreeing to what that paper has to say
of the mistakes which country editors
make in publishing patent medicine
ads. This office has a regular price for
its space, and those who cannot pay it
cannot get the space. We try to treat
every customer fairly and justly. To do
this, it is better to lose an ad now and
than, than to be unjust to our neigh
bors. This editor is not now running
the business department of the office,
but at the time we sold out there was
not, with a single exception, an ad that
did not pay ten cents an inch. In that
exception it was a big ad and the usual
agent's commission was conceded.
The above from the Press and Ban
ner is good hard sense. It took us quite
a while to learn it, but we have adopted
a Hat rate of ten cents per inch, and
the foreign advertiser who gets in our
columns must pay the same rate that is
paid by our home people, and he can no
longer have special position, even if he
pays for it, because if such a contract
is made with the foreign advertiser he
will always find some technical excuse
for avoiding payment. Another rule
which we have adopted, and which we
expect to follow, is that no display ad
vertisements can have place on our
first page. We believe it is best for
the advertiser and best for the paper.

Product of Mills.
The product in one day of the Long
man & Martinez great works is enough
to paint every house and everything
made of wood in a city with the L. &
M Paint.
In use thirty years; several houses
painted with L. & M.
L. & M. costs about $1.20 per gallon.
The L. & M. is the best and cheap
est, because the L. & M. Zinc, hardens
the L. & M. White Lead, and makes it
paint more surface and wear a longer
time than any other paint.
L. & M. costs about $1.20 a gallon.
It only requires 4 gallons of this cele
brated and 3 gallons of Linseed Oil at
60 cents per gallon to paint a moderate
sized house. Therefore a property
owner ought not pay $1.50 per gallon
for Linseed Oil, which he must do when
a ready-for-use paint is bought.
L. & M. costs about $1.20 a gallon.

A LAURENS CASE.
Many More Like It la Laurens.
, The following case is but one of many
similar occuring daily in Laurens. It is
an easy matter to verify its correct
ness. Surely you cannot ask for bet
ter proof than such conclusive evidence:
Lee Bishop, of Laurens, S. C. pro
frietor of a general store, on Mill St.,
'actory Hill, says: "I can from ex
perience recommend Doan's Kidney
Pills. My back and kidneys have given
me great trouble for a long time, not
only costing me untold misery, but
costing me a great many dollars. There
was a dull toothache like pain con
stantly across the small of my back
and after sitting for a bit I could
scarcely get up. Sharp shooting pain
sometimes ran down to first one knee
and then another, and I never knew
when it was going to strike me. The
secretions from the kidneys were too
frequent in action and disturbed my
night rest so that I would arise in the
morning feeling worse than I did the
night before. Y tried numerous reme
dies, but did not get any positive relief
from anything until I learned about
Doan's Kidney Pills and procured them.
The next day after using them I felt
better, and I continued taking them
until the kidney secretions become regu
lar. I could go bed and get a good
night's rest, and the aching in my back
disappered.
