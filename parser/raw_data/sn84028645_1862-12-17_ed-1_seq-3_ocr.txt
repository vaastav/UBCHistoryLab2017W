advise our friends, when tbey go to the olty of

There Is no need of a separate notice of eaob

that the Southern Confederacy has already vir

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,
FALMOUTH, VA., Dec. 16, 1:45 P. M.
During last night tbe Army of the Potomao
evacuated their positions on the opposite side
of the river. The movement was a perilous
one, but it was cooduoted in safety. The ar
tillery was the first to cross the river. The last
of the infantry brought up the rear shortly after
daylight, me enemy never discovered the
movement until it was too late to do us any
damage.
As soon as the last man bad got safely across
the river the pontoon bridges were removed,
thus cutting off all communication between tbe
two shores.
Our wounded are all safe on this side.
There was a beavr wind all last night, ac
companied with considerable rain, whloh as

Washington, Deo. 16. From what is now

upon the open field. Although onr loss Is
heavy, it Is far below the published statements,
