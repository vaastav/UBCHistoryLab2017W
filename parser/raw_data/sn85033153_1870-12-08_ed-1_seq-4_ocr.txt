PBESIDKXT'S MESSAGE.
The President’s Message might be
much shorter without much injury to the
writer or to the nation. It contains
much which will meet strong opposition,
especially the repeated recommendation
of annexing San Domingo. The Pres
ident is as fully satisfied with the dis
graceful conduct of the “protector,” Mr.
Washburn at the expulsion of some
80,000 Germans from Franco without
even a protest, as he is with the recog
nition of the “Mob Republic” in Paris
at the receipt of a single telegram. The
President’s pionositioa con cerning
Alabama question, is very proper, and if
carried out, will bring on an early settle
ment ; for bis strong remarks in regard
to Canada he has not sufficient cause.
The best part of the message is con
tained in the Presidents remarks on
“revenue reform” and on the reform in
public offices. Taken as a whole, the
message contains much material, many
good suggestions and propositions and
surpasses by far in its diction and in its
whole attitude the first j’ears message of
President Grant.
TAXATION AND REVESCE.
In the report of air. Delano, Commis
sioner of Internal Revenue, he gives the
comparative figures of the collections cf
revenue euring the last eighteen months
of Andrew Johnson’s administration,and
the first eighteen months under Grant.
The tables compare as follows :
From Svpf. 1, From March 1
1867, to Feb, ISG9 to Aug.
28.1860. 31,1870.
$241,5-0,760 $291,492,827
This shows an increase of revenue to
the amount of §-19,072,041. But, in the
latter eighteen months, taxes, which had
yielded $52,216,010 had been repealed,
showing a total gain in the collection ex
ceeding $100,000,000. This result estab
lishes the two facts, that an honest col
lection of the taxes is but justice to those
who pay them, and that’a reduction of
the rate, and of the number of objects of
taxation does not involve a loss of revenue.
In Johnson’s time, the tax on whiskey
was $2 per gallon, and, during the eigh
teen months covered by this estimate,
$41,678,000 were collected from spirits.
During the’second eighteen months, the
specific tax was 50 cents per gallon, and
the revenue collected was $82,477,000.
The rate of tax on tobacco was also large
ly reduced, and the revenue therefrom
increased from $29,327,000 to §40,504,-
000. lot there was not a gallon more
spirits, nor a pound more of tobacco sold
during the one period than there was in
the other.
The repeal of the taxes on other articles
which yield $52,000,000, in no way di
minished the revet uc, yet it was a great
boon to the people.
HUME.
The coil of the Pru sian army is slowly
tightening around the Ton mine. A
heavy force is gradually moving down to
ward the valley of the Loire, nowhere
seriously resisted t>y the French. The
dispatches report a body of 8,000 Ger
mans at Chateau Regnault on the 28th,
not more than a half-day’s march north
of the scat of Government. The vast
wave is spread all over the Departments
of the Sarthe, the Loire and Cher. They
are reported as occupying in force the
towns of Mainers and St. Calais to La
Chartre and Chateau Regnault, a dis
tance ot sixty miles. At right angles to
this gicat line runs another of about
equal length trom Cha'eaudum to Mon
tugis. nearly due cast and west, only
about twelve miles north of the city of Or'
leans. At the extreme left of this line
the veteran army of Prince Frederick
Cher.es lies massed, in apparent inactiv
ity, contenting itself with occasionally
feeling the force of Gen. Puladines, and
easily repulsing all his attacks. As we
have before shown, the present purpose
of this force is merely to detain the army
of the Loire where it is, while the army
of the Duke of Mecklenburg pursues
its advance southward upon Tours.—
Meantime, the forces of Man tea lie 1 are
making clean work in toe extreme north,
•weeping through Picardy, capturing
Amicus and defeating the army of Gen.
Farrc in two engagements.
The ganison of Paris, growing restive
in their enforced leisure, have been given
* breathing by Trochu. They have
made a demonstrotion upon Doz
ens, a village nine miles north of Ver
sailles, where the Rouen railroad crosses
the Seine ; and ;.n apparently serious at
tack against Choisy le Roi, six mi’es
south of Paris on the Orleans road, which
resulted in a severe repulse cf the French.
Alarming symtems of insubordination
are visible among the officers of the Re
publican army. Gen. Bourhaki hesitates
to take command of the Eighteenth
Corps, and Count Keratry has tendered
his resignation in a violent and indecor
ous letter addressed to the Provisional
Government. Keratry is a man of great
energy and talent, and has hitherto ex
hibited a fortunate faculty of deserting a
losing cause at the most advantageous
moment. His revolt at this time is per
haps more significant as an omen than as
an event. —-V F. Tribune.
RfTSS^A. —The Eastern question is rap
idly subsiding into a matlcr of purely
diplomatic interest. It seems probable
that a European Congress will soon be
held to give another settlement to the
claims of Russia, which will hardly stand
as long as the last. The Prussian Gov
ernment has taken a lively interest in this
Compromise; and it is saij that the Cab
inet ot Petersburg accepts it in principle.
The Sublime Porte regards the whole af
fair with characteristic apathy, and no
more thinks of actively interfering in the
discussion than a patient, sick unto death,
would think of dictating a course -of
treatment to his physician.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Washington, Dec. s.—The following
is part of the President’s messaee :
To the Senate and House of Representa
tives :
A year of peace and general prosperity
to this nation has passed since the last
assembling of Congress. We have,
through a kind Providence, been blessed
with abundant crops and have beer spar
ed complications and war with foreign
nations. In our midst comparative liars
mony has been restored. It is to be re
gretted, however, that a free exercise of
the elective franchise has by violence and
intimidation been denied to citizens in ex
ceptional cases, in several of the States
lately in rebellion, and the verdict of the
people has thereby been reversed. The
States of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas
have been'restorod to representation in our
national councils; Georgia, the only State
aow without representation may confiden
tially be expected to take her place there
also at the beginning of the new year.
Then let us hope will be completed the
work of reconstruction.
GENERAL HARMONY AND PROSPERITY
With an acquiesence on the part of the
whole people in the national obligations
to pay the public debt, created as the
price of otir Union, the pensions to
our disabled soldiers and sailors, and
their widows and orphans, and in the
changes to the Constitution which have
been made necessary by the great rebel
lion, there is no reason why we should
not advance in material prosperity and
happiness as no other nation did, after so
protracting and devastating a war.
THE WAR IN FRANCE.
Soon after the existing war broke out
in Europe, the protection of the United
States Minister in Paris was invoked in
favor of the North German domiciled in
French territory. Instructions were issu
ed to grant the protection. This has
been followed by an extension of Ameri
can protection to citizens of Saxony,
Hesse and Sax Coburg,Cotben,Columbia,
Portugal. Uruguay. The domnician re
public, Equador, Chili, Paraguay and
Versailles in Paris. The charge was an
enormous one, requiring constant and se
vere labor as well as the exercise of pa
;ienoe, prudence and good judgment. It
has been pci formed to the entire satisfac
tion of (his government, and, as I am
officially informed, equally so to the sat
isfaction of the government of North Ger
many.
******
CENTRAL AMERICA.
It is the obvious interest, especially of
neighboring nations, to provide against
injury to those who may have committed
high crime? within their borders, and
who may have sought refuge abroad. For
this purpose extradition treaties have
been concluded with several of the Cen
tral American republics, and others arc
in progress.
VENZUELLA.
The sense of Congress is desired, as
early as may be convenient, upon the pro
ceedings of tho Commission on claims
against Venzuella, as communicated in
the messages of 31 arch 4th, ISC9, March
Ist, 1870, and March 31st, 1870. It has
not beer, deemed advisable to distribute
any of the money which has been receiv
ed from that government until Congress
shall have acted upon the subject.
THE CHINESE MASSACRES.
The massacre of French and Russian
residents at Toin Tein under circumstan
ces of great barbarity were supposed by
some to have been premeditated, and to
indicate a purpose among the populace to
exterminate foreigners in the Chinese
empire. The evidence fails to establish
such n supposition, but shows a complic
ity by the local authorities and the mob.
The government at Pekin, however,
seems to have been disposed to fulfil its
treaty obligations ; so far as it was able
to do so. Unfortunately tho news of the
war between tho German States and
France reached China soon after the mas
sacre. It would appear that the popu
lar mind became possessed with tho idea
that this contest, extending to Chinese
waters, would neutralize the Christian in
fluence and power, and that the time was
coming when the superstitious mass
might expel all foreigners and restore
mandarin influence- Anticipating troub
le from this cause, I invited France and
North Germany to make an authorized
suspension of hostilities in the East,
where they were temporarily suspended
by act of the commanders, to act together
for the future protection in China of the
lives and pro] erty of Americans and
Europeans.
TREATIES WITH ENGLAND.
Since the adjournment of Congress,
the ratifications of the treaty with Great
Britain for abolishing the mixed courts
for the suppression of tho slave trade,
have been exchanged. It is believed
that the sl.avo trade is now confined to
the eastern coast of Africa, whence they
are taken to tho Arabian markets.
The ratifications of the naturalization
convention between Great Britain and
the I id ted States have also been ex
changed during tho recess, and thus a
long standing dispute between the two
governments has been settled in accor
dance with the principles always contend
ed for by the United States.
THE BRITISH BOUNDARY LINE.
In April last seven who engaged in lo
cating a military reservation near Pem
bina, a corps of Engineers discovered
that tho commonly received boundary
line between the United States and the
British possessions at that placets about
fifty seven hundred I’eot south of the
true position of the zenith parallel, and
that tho lino when run on what is now
supposed to be the true position of that
parallel would leave the fort of the Hud
son's Ray Comp ny at Pembina within
the territory of the United States. This
information being communicated to the
British government, 1 was requested to
consent, and I did consent, that the
British occupation of the fort of the
Hudson Ray Cos. should continue for
the present. I deem it important, how
ever,-that this part of the boundary lines
should be definitely fixed by a joint com
mission of the governments, and submit
herewith estimates of the expense of
such a commission on the part of the
I nited States, and recommend an appro
priation for the purpose.
Russia and England. —The New
York Tribune fears Lord John forgets
that his Crimean war cost Great Britain
thirty thousand lives and forty millions
pounds sterling. It humbled Russia,
but it did not solve the Eastern question.
Yet the old Earl places himself again at
the head of the war party, willing to pro
tect a rotten empire that has been a
curse to civilization, and to again injere
Russia, which embodies more elements of
greatness and progress than almost any
other power in Europe.
The Herald is of opinion that England
can scarcely form anew war Cabinet ca
pable of managing the situation. Tho
people are slightly enthusiastic, but they
will soon realize that the treaty of Paris
does not give food to their children,
while a Russian licet on tho Black Sea
cannot possibly diminish British com
merce. Manchester’s influence in Eng
land is all-powerful, and Manchester
wads foreign trade, not foreign war,
THE TREASURES OF THE ANDES
-SILVER AND GOLD OF BOLIVIA
AND CHILI.
Before the discovery of California and
Australia th.ew gold into the hands of
men bv the lap fulls, says a writer in the
Panama Star and Herald, classical stu
dents of the past history of mankind
had pretty well induced the world to be
lieve that the age of gold had passed by.
Man iu the primitive ages had to do the
best he could with stone implements,
and silver has had no predominant age
assigned it among the influences and an
naL of the human race. For utility, to
iron must be given the rank of the king
of metals.
Iron has made Europe what it is, but
then the virtues of iron are incompati
ble with laziness: and a man to get rich
on iron must do so by the intelligent use
of his muscles and brain. A piece of
steel made into the spring and chain or
a watch becomes increased five hundred
per cent, in its market value. The find
er of gold can at onco take the metal in
its native and natural state aud exchange
it for all the fruits of other men’s in
dustry and live at ease, or buy his own
ruin and go to the devih Between these
extremes silver holds a medium place.
Coal is st trod for us in the bowels of the
earth, but wo search for silver near the
snowy tops of the highest Cordilleras.
For the one we burrow in the earth like
rabbits, for tho other we must climb
mountains like a chamois goat. Silver
ssems to have a cooler and loss inflam
able effect on the minds of men than
gold.
W Leu the cry was beard in Europe of
the abundance of gold in America, the
poor of all nations otaitcd up, careless
of home and country, to partake in the
sudden riches, whereas the reports of
silver in Mexico and Peru, diamonds in
Brazil or the Cape of Good Hope have
excited but little emotion. Our latest
advices from Chili bring us continued
and excited accounts of tho discoveries
of rich mines of silver. The Indepen
dent of the 15th October says; More
news has been received from the Moluc-
a recently discovered mine, of tho
Rosilla, another a little lujirc to the
north. Crowds of people have gone
from Chanarcilla, each one to prospect
for himself. It was further reported
that at Algarobba, south of Chanarcilla,
vast deposits of silver and copper had
been found deposited in the form of
streets. In view of all this it is recom
mended that the government should ap
point officers to regulate the supply of
water and prevent disorders. Two days
alter, continues this paper, a correspon
dent wrote, “Good news ! reat news!
Caracoles beaten !” In effect the mines
found lately in Bolivia have found
a rival in the Sapos, about ten or twelve
leagues more to the south. Two miners
who had been out prospecting, arrived
with specimens of anew mine discovered
by them, which gave two thousand mar
cos the box or cujon , which from virgin
Cordilleras need not cause wonder or un
belief, and might well give rise to a
second Chanarcilla. In a vein worked by
Jacinto Torres two hundred and fifty
p unds of the ore gave forty-eight mar
cos of silver. Inconsequence of all this
there are some five hundred persons on
the spot, some looking on soma prospect
ing. There is great enthusiasm and a
feeling of rivalry to beat the lately dis
covered rich mines in Bolivia. Impa
tient enthusiasts are recommended pa
tience, and told that, furnished with this
virtue, and aided by saliva, an ant might
be able a swallow an elephant. This
piactical proverb is recommended to d:s
satisfied workmen and mechanics who
wish to abandon the certain for chance
speculations.
3 arious fortunate speculators bad re
turned in the steamer. The locality is
good and abundant room for all. The
worst of it is that food is not- easily ob
tained and only at high prices. Water
is bad in quality and produces a pecu
liar disease, by which the sufferers are
afflicted with a sort of fungous tumors
under the skin called clavos or warts,
which extend ra; idly and are accompa
nied by the most atrocious pains Through
out the body. Like the ancients who
placed dragons, serpents and other su
pernatural beings to guard the treasures
of the faith from those who sought to
get suddenly rich, we have natural ob
jects to overcome,if we wish to obtain the
silver from the mines of Caracoles. —
However, instead of envying with our
arms crossed the luck of our Chilian
and Bolivian friends, have we not also
the Spurs and Cordilleras belonging to
the same great Andean system of moun
tains? We know where the mines of
Cana are and what they produced. To
partake of the riches of the kingdoms
of nature, we must do as we are told how
to do to enter the kingdom of Heaven,
“Seek and you shall find.”
France. —The military situation in
trance it is impossible now to determine
with accuracy, so confused and contra
dictory are the dispatches. One thing
seems to bo certain, however, and that
is, that there has been almost continu
ous fighting since the 2Sth ult., and,
though there has been no great, decisive
battle, there have been many sanguinary
engagements, with results sometimes
favorable to one side and sometimes to
the other. Trochu a desperaj
attempt to raise the siege ot Paris, but,
though his sorties at first drove the
Prussians from their positions, he does
not appear to have been able to break
through their lines. There is a report,
however, that a portion of his forces had
broken through and effected a junction
with tho army of the Loire ; but this is
probably not true, as, if a portion of his
army succeeded in getting out, it would
indicate such a success of the French as
would have been far mare disastrous to
the Prussians than anything which has
yet been reported.— Wisconsin.
Two Governors in Alabama. —ln
the Alabama Legislature on Saturday,
Robert A Linsday, Democrat, was count
ed in as Governor by a majority of 1,4:20,
and took the oath; but Gov. Smith,
Republican, having obtained an injunc
tion, on the ground that.Linsday was
illegally elected, the State will,'for a
time have two Governors, The
majority for E. 11. Maren, Democrat
for Lieutenant Governor, was found to
be' 4,377, and he was installed as presi
ding officer of the Senate. Other Demo
cratic State officers were also declared
elected.
New Jersey. —The evidences of the
decay of the Republican party do not
seem to be very strong in New Jersey.
The official count returns a Republican
gain not only of one Congressman but of
over 8,000 Republican votes, while the
loss ol the Democracy exclusive of the
Congressman, is 4,063 votes. In the
Stale Senate the Republicans have gain
ed 3, and in the Assembly 8 members.
The Senate will stand 12 Republicans to
9 Democrats, and the Assembly 34 Re
publicans to 26 Democrats. The Legis
lature will meet on the 10th of January
and elect a United States Senator.
