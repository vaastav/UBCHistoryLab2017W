A Hmllton county Texas correspond
ent of the Home and Farm says that if
stockmen will give their cows an over
gorge of cotton seed it will help if not
cure tham of creeps or stiff disease for
he has tried it and knowi of cows that
have been cured sound and well Give
them all they will eat there is plenty of
that disease in this country but it is al
ways cows that suckle calves He never
saw any have it but what did suckle
From the report of tne Fort Worth and
Denver Railway pre > eited by the presi
dent for the year ending Octooer 311887
the following facts are taken During
the year mentioned the Fort Worth and
Denver hau ed 4572 carloads of stock
made up of 125133 head of cattle 3104
horses 14 446 sheep G63 hogs making a
total of 143408 animals hauled by the
road for the year being an increase of
37301 head of stock or 1348 carloads
over the year previous Snce the road
opened for business it has hauled 26570
cars of stock or 779438 head
Mr n C Holloway one of Tarrant
countys able commissioners brought to
The Gazkttic office for exhibition several
bunches of Alfalfa clover grown on his
farm one and onequarter miles north of
the courthouse The grass has been cut
twice during the season and the third crop
was again rich and luxuriant and about
ten inches long The roots were some
three or four feet long and it is said they
grow downward to a depth cf fifteen feet
Alfalfa is evidently the coming food for
Texas stock Mr Holloway sayej he has
been feeding it for some time and finds
better results than from any other
character of grass About six tons per
acre can be raised on suitable land and by
frequent cuttings the grass can be saved
while young and nourishing
Cotulla Ledger inasmuch as the eyes
of all the stockmen of Texas are now
turned upon LaSalle county watching to
see how the feeding of beef cattle on cot
tonseed meal and prickly pear is going
to pan out we truss that every one feed
ing will realize the importance of the
situation and do the stock they feed
justice The outcome is being watched
irfci more interest abroad than our
people imagine and a great deal
depends upon the result of the feed
ing business in this county this winter
If the stockmen here make a thorough
success of the business their example
will be followed next winter by almost
every county in the state where the
growth of the prickly pear is sufficient to
warrant it This will serve to lift the
stockmen out of debt and make the voca
tion of stock raising a pleasant as well as
a profitable one whereas lor years past it
his been drudge and no money to be
made out of it
What the newspapers in this part of
the state ought to point out to the
hraers is the fact that while they are
getting into debt raising cotton they
might oe getting rich growing corn for
stock feed
So spoke a gentleman in one of the
hotels the other evening and he was sup
plied with a quantity of arguments to
substantiate the proposition he enunci
ated some of which are given for what
they are worth
A 900pound steer is worth now 2c a
pound or 318 Thirtyfive bushels of
corn will at 30c cost 10 50 and that
will put 200 pounds of fl sh on the steer
so altogether your 1100pound cornfed
steer costs you 28 50 The steer
can now be sold for 4c per pound I e
4 giving a clear profit of 15 50 for the
beef alone The value of the manure and
the hulls for hoss willj make the profit
20 easily alf made with thirtyfive
bushels of corn that could be grown on
one acre of land
Now to look at the cottongrowing
Three acres of land will grow a bale year
in and year out The bale weighs 500
pounds and there is a clear pre fit of 2c
per pound on it The grower makes 10
on three acres of land where with corn
he might have made 20 on one acre
The fact Is says the gentleman if a
cottongrower makes 2c per pound on his
cotton he is doing extraordinarily well
He generally comes out in debt at the end
ol the season

this county was convicted on the charge
of incest and given two years in the peni
tentiary The case against him was for
marrying the daughter of his deceased
wife It appears that shortly after tLis
trial the Court of Appeals rendered a
decision in a case identically the same as
Paxtons and decided that the pasty was
guilty of no offense but in the meantime
Mr Paxton bad been carried to Hunts
ville and there remained until in Novem

trial The juiy was impaneled and
the taking cf evidence was begun
Joe Guyles was convicted

the same charge and was given two years

thought Akers will be convicted also as
the same evidence is against him as was
against Guyles as they were charged
with the same offense claimed to have
been committed at the same time Guyles
was tne first person convicted of wire
cutting in the state and Parker county

Answer the Description
Special to the Gazette
Texarkana Tex Dec 14 Three
men were arrested last night above here
and brought here and lodged in jail
They are strongly suspected of being the
parties who robbed the train nine miles
from here on the Cotton Belt last Friday
night They answer the description of
the robbers very well and there is strong
evidence that they were in the Immediate
vicinity at the time of the robbery al
though they assert to the contrary Par
ties who were with the train at the time
are doubtful as to whether the
right men have been caught but
this is explained by the fact that the rob
bers were masked When arrested all
of them were spending money freely and
buying whlBky for all who would drink
The general public here Inclines to the
belief that the captured men are the rob
bers

Fiftieth Congress
THE SENATE
Washington Dec 14 Senator Hoar
from the committee on privileges and
electionepresented the report in the West
Virginia case He said that the report
was unanimous The questions raised
were very simple ones and easily com
prehended One of them had been long
ago determined by the Senate and he sup
posed that all the Senators had had occa
sion to reflect on the others In order
that the Senator entitled to the seat might
enter at once upon his duties he hoped
there would be no objection
to haviDg the report disposed
of at present The report was
read at length It concludes with two
resolutions one declaring that Daniel H
Lucas is not entitled to the seat and the
other declaring that Charles J Faulkner
has been duly elected Senator from the
state of West Virginia for a term of six
years commencing the 4th of March 1887
and is entitled to a seat in the Senate as
such Senator The resolutions were
agreed to viva voce and the oath of
office was thereupon administered to Mr
Faulkner
Mr Hoar then moved that Mr Faulk
ner be assigned to the committee on
claims District of Columbia mines and
mining and pensions Agreed to
Senator Harris from the committee on
rules reported an amendment to the
thirtyfirst rule That rule provides that
where an adverse report is made on a
claim and the report is agreed to it shall
not be in order to take the papers from
the file for the purpose of referring them
at a subsequent session unless the action
states that new evidence has been dis
covered and the substance of it The
amendment is to add to the rule a clause
that in cases where there is no adverse
report it shsll be the duty of tie Secre
tary of the Senate to transmit all such
papers to the committee in which suck
clsim is pending The report was
agreed to
Among the bills introduced were the
following
By Senator George To protect inno
cent purchasers of patented articlesmak
ing it a valid defense for actions against
infringement that the article was bought
for nee not for sale and in good faith
and in the usual course of trade and pro
viding that old patents shall be subject
to purchase by the government for gen
eral use at a reasonable valuation
Senator Chandler offered a resolution
authorizing the select committee on In
dian treaties authorizsd on June 30 18SG
to continue its investigation Referred
The Senate then took up Senator Mor
rills bill to regulate immigration and
was addressed by thst Senator in advo
cacy of the bill
Senator Morrill said the measure intro
duced by him was intended to regulate
immigration by a Echeme so moderate bb
to receive general approval Its main ob
ject he said was to have the character
of the immigrants examined first by the
United States consul at the ports of de
parture instead of by the state commis
sioners at the ports of arrival Tne for
eign idea he said was that the United
States invited free immigration regard
less of the character of the people but
the Anerlcsn idea was that it never
really offered an asylum to convicts to
irreconcilable enemies of law and order
or to occupants of the Old Worlds insane
asylums and workhouses The doors
were left open to persons of good moral
character The fact that nearly 5000000
immigrants had come to this country
within the last ten years proved that the
question was one of great importance
The American principles of free
admission of immigrants was not pro
posed to be abandoned but that the prin
ciple had always had one condition that
the immigrants should be of good charac
ter and able to support themselves He
referred to the fact that the mayor of the
Athens cf America had presided at
a banquet given in honor of
the champion slugger of the prize ring
and if not the will at least the political
ntcessities of the Mayor had consented
to that He said 70 per cent of the popu
lation of Boston was composed of persons
of foreign birth and foreign parentage
Eight per cent of the population of New
York and 9 per cent of the population of
Chicago and these figures might
be aggravated by future immigraiion
By the census of 1880 the population ot
foreign birth and parentage was 15000
000 and the immigration since then was
4304438 so without including children
born of foreign parentage there was now
in this country a foreign population nearly
onethird of the entire population This
discloses the enormous attractive force
exerted by this country on the people of
Europe He had lately visited Castle
Garden N Y where a vessel had juBt
arrived from Antwerp with 6000 immi
grants and the sights he witnessed sug
gested the doubt whether this country
possessed the transcendent power to
transfer ail those immigrants into good
and valuable American citizens He
quoted the reply of Mr Balfour to
a question in the House of Commons as
to the government aiding immigration to
the effect that the government would ap
ply no more money to that purpose dur
ing the year This he said was a negative
pregnant Mr Balfour had not said that
parishes or neighbors should not
aid immigration At the end of
the year Immigration might be aided
by the government again unless the
fishery commissioners should implore
Mr Balfour to refrain from putting briars
In their path while cunning diplomacy
was going on here The paupers of
Great Britain numbered nearly 1
000000 outside the uncounted vag
rants and the paupers far exceeded
the number of socalled paupers
There was too strong a tendency in Ea
rope to regard the United States as a cess
pool for the vilest products of the old
world Provident husbandry demanded
that young America should not be wholly
deprived of its birthright
Mr Morrill said his measure would
of course be referred to the judiciary
committee He hoped that that commit
tee would report some measure to check
mate the gross imposition from foreign
nations to which this country has been
so largely subjected He moved that the
bill be referred to the judiciary commit
tee
Senator Edmunds suggested the sub
ject more properly belonged to the com
mittee on foreign relations and he moved
to that reference

granted the change of venue on the opin
