MISSOURI STATE NEWS.
Not a Nickel JLeft- '
Btewartsville, DeKatb County, wa? the
scene a few days agoof a sensation which
shook the quiet town to its foundation,
and caused almost a suspension of busi
ness for the time being. It was the clos
ing of the doors of the well-known Stew
artsville bank of Buck & McCrosky, and
the announcement of the total collapse of
the bank as a business institution. It was
discovered that the firm of Buck & Mc
Crosky dissolved partnership on Novem
ber 28, and that the fact was not revealed
to any one until the news of the failure
began to be circulated upon the
streets. As ;it Is always customary
to give public notice of the dissolution of
a partnership as soon as it takes place,
the fact that it was not done in this in
stance caused much surprise. The as
signee, John W. Coberly, is a well-known
citizen of St. Joseph. Mr. Coberly is a
heavy loser. - The assignee went to the
bank for the purpose of opening the vault
and seeing how much money was left for
the victims. His surprise maybe imag
ined when, upon opening the safe, not a
s.ngle nickel was discovered to gladden
his eyes. All of the merchants and many
farmers are victims to a greater or less
extent, and much suffering will be caused.
A number of St. Joseph people suffered
by the failure, and the probabilities are
that the affair will create long litigation.
Miscellaneous Items.
The recent rains have been of great bene
fit to the growing wheat. Much of the
crop that was considered de.ad and ru

thirty-live years old, and no cause was
known for the act.

Washington, Dec 6. Following is the
full text of President Cleveland's message
transmitted to Congress to-day: : a
j To the Congress 6f hb United 'StateS
! Yon are confronted at the threshold of your
legislative duties, with a condition of the .
., nation At.' finances, ; rr;-
Which Imperatively demands immediate and
' careful consideration. The amount of money
annually exacted, through the operations of
present laws, irem me inausines ana neces
si ties of the, people, largely exoeed the sum
i necessary xo meet ine expenses or the Govern
i ment. When we consider that th theonr. nf
our institutions guarantees to every fcitizen the
; run enjoyment i au toe iruits oi his industry
i uuu em.eriiae, wim uuiy sucn aeauctlon
las f may - be liis share towards' the
I careful and economical maintenance
! or tne government wmch protects
i mm, it is piain mai me exaction oi more than
j this is indefensible extortion, and a culpable
I betrayal of American fairness and justice. This
i wronir inflicted upon those whobear the burden
ot National taxation, like other wrong's, multi
plies a Drooa oi evn consequences. Tne public
treasury, which should only exist as a conduit
conveying the people's tribute to its legitimate
objects of expenditure, becomes a hoarding-
piare ior money neeuiesaiy wixnarawn irom
trade and the people s u-ie, thus crippling- our
National energies, suspending our country
development, preventing invetsment in pro-
uuctive enterprise, mreaiening nnanciai dis
turbance, and inviting schemes of public plun
aer.
This condition of our treasury is not al
together new : and it has more than once of
late been submitted to the people' representa
tives in Congress, who alone can apply .a
remedy. Ana yet tne situation still continues,
with aggravated incidents, more than ver
presaging financial convulsion and wide-spread
disaster. It will not do to neglect this situation
because its dangers are not now palpably im
minent and apparent. They exist none the
less certainly, and await the unforeseen an
unexpected occasion when suddenly they will
be precipitated upon us.
On the 30th day of June, 18S", the excess of
revenues over public expenditures, after com
plying with the annual requirement of the
Sinking-Fund act, was tl7,ttS,735.8i; duringthe
year ended June 30, 1886, such excess amounted
to m s,54 ana our ngine year enaea June
30, iaS7, it reached the sum of f5.',5B7,&49.5t. The
annual contributions to tne sinning tund dur
ing the three years above specked, amounting
in the aggregate to -:13S,O58,3.04, and deducted
from the surplus as stated, were made by call
ing in for tuat purpose outstanding three per
cent, oonas or tn uovernment. uunng tne six
montns prior to June , iH7, the sur
plus revenue had grown so .large by
repeateu accumulations, tnat it was
feared the withdrawal of this great
sum of money needed by the people, would so
affect the business or tne country that the sum
of $79,864,100 of such surplus was applied to tho
payment of the principal and interest of the
three per cent, bonds still outstanding, and
which were then payable at the option of the
Government. The precarious condition of
financial affa rs among the people still needing
rener, immediately alter tne autn aav or June,
J8S7, the remainder of the three per cent, bonds
then outstanding, amounting with principal
and interest to the sum of SlS.STT.oOO. were
c-tlled m and applied to the sinking fund con
tribution for the current fiscal yep.r. Notwith
standing these operations, of the Treasury
.Department representations ormstress in ousi
ness circles not only continued, but increased.
and absolute peril seemed at hand. In these
circumstances the contribution to the sinking
lund lor tne, current nscai year was at once
completed by the expenditure of 1 27,684,285;
in the purchase of Government bonds not yet
aue, bearing rour ana lour ana a hatf.per cent.
interest, the premium paid thereupon averag
ing about twenty-four per cent, for the former
and eight per cent, for the latter. In addition
to this the interest accruing during the current
year upon the outstanding bonded indebted
ness of tbe Government was to some extent
anticipated, and banks selected as depositories
of public money were permitted to somewhat
increase their deposits.
hile the expedients thus emoloved. to re
lease to the people the money lying idle in the
treasury, served to avert immediate danger,.
our surplus revenues have continued to ac
cumulate, the excess for the , present year
amounting on tne nrst aay or jjecemoer to Soi
258.701. 19, and estimated to reach the sum oi
8113,000,000 on the 30th day ,of June next, atf
which date it is expected that this sum, added
to prior accumulations, will swell the surplus
in tnq-reasnry to fiw.iw,ww. .
H There seems to Be no assurance that, with
Fuch a withdrawal from use of the people's
circulating medium, our business community
may not in the near future be subjected
to the same distress which was quite lately
produced from the same canse. And while the
functions of our National Treasury should be
few and simple, and while its best condition
would be reached, I believe, by its entirs , dis
connection with private business interests, yet
when, by a perversion of its purposes, it. idly
holds money uselessly subtracted from the
channels of trade, there seems to be reason for
the claim that some legitimate means should
be devised by the Government to restore in an
emergency, without waste or extravagance,
such money to its place among the people.
If such an emergency arises there
now exists no clear and undoubted
executive power of relief. Heretofore the
redemption of three percent, bonds, which were
payable at tho option of the Gov rnment, has
afforded a means for the disbursement of the
excess of our revenue; but these bonds have
all been retired, and there are no bonds out
standing, the payment of which we have the
right to insist upon. The contribution to . the
sinking fund, which furnishes the occasion for
expenditure in the purchase of bonds has been
already made for the current year, so that there
is no outlet m that direction.
In the. present state of legislation the only
pretense ot any existing executive power to re-
store, at this time, any part of our surplus rev
enuestotue people Dy its expenditure, con
sists in the supposition that the Secretary of
the Treasury may enter the market and pur-
hase the bonds of the Government not yet due,
at a rate or premium to be agreed upon.
The only provision of law irom which such
power could be derived is round in an appropri
ation Din passed a numoer or years ago; and it
is subject to the suspicion that it was intended
as temporary and limited in its application, in
stead of conferring a continuing discretion rnd
authority. No condition ought to exist whu-h
would justify v e grant of power to a single
olhcial, upon his judgment of its necessity, to
witnnoia rrom or release to tne ousincss of the
people, in an unusual manner, money held in
the treasury, and thus affect, at his will,
the financial situation of the country; and if
It is deemed wise to lodge in the Secretary of
tne Treasury tne authority in the present junct
ure to purchase bonds, it should be plainly
vested, and provided, as far as possible, with
such checks and limitations as will define this
official righi- and discret.on, and at the same
t.me relieve him of undue responsibility
In considering tho question of purchasing
bonds as a means or restoring to circulation
the surplus money accumulating in the treas
ury, it should be borne in mind that premiums
must or course te paid upon sucn purchase.
.that there may be a large part of these bonds
held as investments which can not be pur
chased at any price, and that 5 com
binations among noiaers wno ' are
willing to sell, ' may unreasonably
ennauce tne cost-oi sucn oonas to tne liovern
ment. It has been suggested that the present
bonded debt might be refunded at a less rate
of interest, and the difference betwe-m the old
and new security paid in cash, thus finding use
lor the surplus in the treasury. The success
of this plan, it is apparent, must depend upon
the volition of the holders of the present
bonds; and it is not entirely c-vrtaia that the
inducement which must be o.t . them would
result in more financial ben. the Govern
ment than the purchase of boit -, while the lat
ter proposition would reduce tie principal o
the debt by actual payment, instead of extend
ing a., . i i
The proposition to deposit the money held by
the Government in banks throughout tbe coun
try, for use by the people, is, it seems to me.
exceedingly objectionaole m principle, estab
lishing too close relationship between the
operations of the Government Treasury and thdi
business of the country, and too .extensive a
commingling of their money, thus fostering an
unnatural reliance in private business upon
public funds. If this scheme should be adopted
it should only be done as a temporary expe
dient to meet an urgent necessity. Legislative
and executive effort should generally be in the
opposite direction, and should have a tendency
to divorce, as much and as fast- as
an' safely be ' done, the Treasury De
partment from private enterprise. Of course t
is not expected that unnecessary aud extrava
gant appropriations will be made for the pur
pose of avoiding the accumulation of an excess
of revenue. Such expenditure, besides the de-,.
moranzauon or all just conceptions oi pursue
duty which it entails, stimulates a habit of
reckiess improvidence not in the least consist-
nt with tho mission ot our people or the high
and beneficent purpose of our Government.
I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the
knowledge of my countrymen, as well as to the
attention of their - representatives charged
with the responsibility of legislative, re-;
lief, the- gravity of our financial situation.
The failure of Congress heretofore to provide
against the dangers which it was quite evident
the very nature of the difficulty must neces
sarily produce, caused a condition of financial
distress and apprehension since your last ad
journment, whieh taxed to the utmost all the
authority and expedients within executive con
trol: and these appear now to be exhausted.
If disaster results from the continued inaction
of Congress, the responsibi ity must rrat
where it belongs. Though the situation thus
far considered is fraught with danner which
should be fully realized, and though it presents
features of wrong to the people as well as peril
to the country. It is but a result growing out of a
perfectly palpable and apparent cause, con
stantly reproducing tbe same alarming circum
stancesa congestod National Treasury and i
depleted monetary condition In the business of
the country S-! It need hardly", be.stated that
whilB the present situation aeiBand' remedy,
we capjanlyjuO saved from a "like predicament
in the future by the removal of Its eause.
Our schema of taxation, by mens of which
this needless surplus is taken from the people
and put into the public treasury, consist
-of a tariff or duty levied wpon importa
tions from abroad, and internal revenue taxes
levied upon the consumption of tobacco and
spirituous and malt liquors. It must be conced
ed that none of the things subjected to internal
revenue taxation are, strictly speaking, -necessaries:
there appears to be no just complaint
of this taxation by the consumers of these ar
ticles, and there seems to be nothing so well
able to bear the burden without hardship to
any 'portion of .the people.' But our present
tariff laws, the vicious, inequitable and illogical
source of unnecessary taxation, -ought to be at
once revised and amended. These laws, as their
primary and plain effect, raise the price to con
sumers of silt articles imported and subject to
'duty t by precisely - the sum. paid . tot
such duties. " Thus the amounts of the
duty measures the tax paid by those who
purchase for nse these imported articles.
Many of these things, however, are raised or
manufactu ed in our ' own -country, and the
duties now levied upon foreign goods and pro
ducts .are called .protection to these home
mauufaetnres, because they render.it possible
: Iorthose of our people who are manufacturers
to make these taxed articles and sell tnem tor
a price equal to that demanded tor the im
ported goods that have paid customs duty. ,So
it happens that, while comparatively a few use
the imported articles, millions of our people,
who never use and never saw any of
the foreign products, purchase and use
things of ' the same kind made in
this country and pay therefor nearly or
quite the same enhanced price which the duty
adds to the imported articles. Those who buy
imports pay the duty charged thereon into the
public treasury, but the great majority of our
citizens who buy domestic articles of the same
class pay a sum at least approximately equal
to this duty to the home manufacturer. This
reference to the operation of our tariff laws is
not made by way of instruction, but in order
that we may be constantly reminded of the
manner in which they impose a burden upon
those who consume domestic products as well
as those who consume imported articles, and
thus create a tax upon all our people.
' It is not proposed to entirely relieve the coun
try of this taxation. It must be extensively
continued as the source of the Government's in
come; and in a readjustment of our tariff the
interests of American labor engaged in manu
facture shoulo be carefully considered, as well
as the preservation of our manufacturers. It
may be called protection, or by any other name,
but relief irom the hardships and dangers of
our present tariff laws should be devised with
especial precaution against imperiling the- ex
istence of oar manufacturing interests. But
this existence should not mean a condition
which, without regard to the public welfare
or a National exigency, . must - al
ways insure the realization of immense
prollts instead of moderately profitable re
turns. As the volume and diversity of our Na
tional activities increase, new reernits are
added to those who desire a continuation of the
advantages which they conceive the present
system of tariff taxation directly affords them.
So stubbornly have all efforts to reform the
present condition been resisted by those of our
fellow-citizens thus engaged, that- they can
hardly complain oi the suspicion, entertained to
a certain extent, that there existed an organ
ized combination all along the line to maintain
their advantage.
We are in the midst of centennial celebra
tions, and with becoming pride were rejoice in
American skill and ingenuity, American energy
and enterprise, and in the wonderful natural
advantages and resources developed by
a century's National growth. "Yet when an at
tempt is made to justify a schemei which per
mits a tax to be laid upon every consumer in
the land for the benefit of -our manufactures
quite beyond a reasonable demand for Govern
mental regard, it suits the purposes of advocacy
to call our manufactures infant industries, still
needing the higiiest and greatest degree of
favor and fostering care that can be wrung from
Federal legislation. ;
It is also said that the;' increase in the
price of domestie -manufactures ' resulting
.from the present J&riffjris 'necessary in order
that higher wages may bj p lid to , our
workingmen employed in manufactorievthah
are paidor vfh-dX i called the pauper labor of
Eu-rope. All will acknowledge the force of the
argument that, a government which involves
the welfare- and liberal compensation of our
labor is honorable in the eyes of every Ameri
can citizen ; and as it lies at the foundation of
our development and. progress,-: it is pntitled,
without affectation or hypocrisy, to the ut
most regard. The standard of Our laborers'
life ' should not'; be measured by that of any
other country les favored, a-nd they are en
titled to their full share of all ""Our advantage. -
By the lasfcensus it is "made to appear that
of the 17,592, "9! of our' population engaged in
all kinds of industries, 7,070,495 are employed in
agriculture. 4,074.238 in professional and , per
sonal service, (8,934,876 of whom are domestic
servants and laborers) while 1.810,-i"j6 are em
ployed In trade and transportation, and 3,837,118
are classed as employed in manufacturing and
mining. :"'';., ;
For presect purposes, however, the last num
ber given should be considerably reduced;
Without attempting to enumerate alL it will be
conceded that there should be deducted from
those which it includes 375,143 carpenters and
joiners ; 285,401 milliners, dressmakers and seam
stresses, 172, 728 .blacksmiths, J33,756 tailors and
tailoresses, 102.474 masons, 76,241 butchers, 41.

amounting jin the aggregate to 1,214,' 23,j leav
ing 2,623,19 persons employed in such manu

low j prices for : the majority. ; their
compensation, as it may be af
fected liy the operation of tariff
laws, should at all times be scrupulously kept
in view; and yet with slight inflection they will
not overlook the fact that they are consumers
with the rest r that they, too, have their own
wants and those of:rtheir families to supply
from their earnings, and that the prices of the
necessaries or lire, as well as tli-. amount or
their wages, will regulate the measure of their
welfare ana comfort. Hut the reduction or taxa
tion demanded should be so measured as not to
necessitate or justify the loss of employment
by the workingman nor the lessening
of his wages: and the profits still
remaining to the manufacturer, after
a necessary readjustment, should
furnish no excuse for the sacrifice of tho inter
ests of ins employes either in their opportunity
to work or in the diminution of their compensa
tion. Nor can the worker in manufactures fail
to understand that while a high tariff is claimed
to be necessary to allow thrt payment of re
munerative wages, it certainly results in a very.
large increase in tne price of nearly all sorts of.
manufactures, whicn. in almost countless
forms, he needs for the use of himself and his
family. He receives at the desk of his employer
his wages, and perhaps before he reaches his
home is obi ged, in a purchase for family use of
an article which embraces his own labor, to re
turn in the payment of the increase in price
which the tar ft permits, the hard-earned com
pensation of many days of toiL
The farmer and the agriculturist, who manu
facture nothing, bu- who pay the increased
price which the tariff imposes upon every agri
cultural implement, upon all he wears and upon
all he uses and owns, except the increase of his
flocks and herds and such things as in his hus
bandry he produces from the soil, is invited to
aid in maintaining the? present situation:-and
he is told that a high duty on imported wool is
necessary for the benefit of those who have
sheep to shear, tn order that the price or their
wool may be increased. They, Of course, are not
reminded that the farmer who has no sheep is by
mis scheme obliged, in his purchases or cloth
ing and woolen goods, to pay a tribute to his
llow-farmer as well a to the manufacturer
and merchant; nor is any mention m-tde of the
fact, that the sheep-owners themselves and
their households, must wear clothing :nd use
other articles manufactured from the wool they,
sell at tariff prices, and thus as consumers must
return tneir share or this increased price to the
tradesman. .... .
I think it may be fairly assumed that a large
proportion of the sheep owned by the farmers
throughout the country are found in small
flocks numbering from twenty-five to tif v.
The duty on the grade of imported wool which
these sheep yield, is ten cents- each pound if
oi tne vaiue oi tnirty cents or less, and
twelve cents if of the value of more than twelve
cents. If the liberal estimate of six pounds be
allowed for each fleece, the duty thereon would
be sixty or seventy-two cents and this mav be
taken asthe utmost enhancement of its price
to the farmer by reason of this duty. Eighteen
dollars would thus represent the increased price
of the wool from twenty-five sheep, and thirty
six dollars that from the wool of fifty sheep;
and at pres-jnt values this addition would
amount to aboutot)e-th.'rdof its price.' If unon
its sale tbe farmer receives this or a less tariff
profit, the wool leaves his hands charged with
precisely that sum,"wnica itt all its changes

its cost is not only increased "to the extent of
the farmer's tariff profit, but a further, sum has
en aoaea ior tne oencnt ot the manufacturer
under the operation of other tariff laws. In the
meantime the aav arrives when the farmer
finds it necessary to purchase wooln rnnAa nr
material to clothe himself and family for the
winter. When he faces the tradesman for that
purpose he discovers that be is obliged not only
to return in the way of increaser!
tariff profit on thewool he sold, and which then,
perhaps, lies before him in manufactured form,
but that he must add a consider.-Lbio anm
thereto to meet -t ; s further in
crease in cost caused by a tariff duty,
on the manufacture. Thus in the end he is
aroused to the fact that he has- paid upon a
moderate purchase, as a resnit nf tji
-scheme, which, when he sold his wool, seemed
...uuiuwc, an increase in price, more than
snfflcient to sweep away all the tariff nmt ho l
received upon the wool he produced and sold.
When the number ot farmers engaged in
wool-raising is compared with all the farmers
in the country, and the small pornortion they
puu.nuuu uuuatuereu ; wnen it
is made apparent that, in the case of a large
part of those who owa sheep, the
benefit of the present tariff on .wool
is illusory: and, above all, when it must

fastenedmjon-the clothintr of every, man,
woSand clnM in the land, reasons are sug
gested why the removal or reduction or this
dutyvXuld be included, in a revision of our
tariff laws. .
In speaking of tho increased cost to the con
Bumerof our home manufactures, restating
?rom a dnt?lald pon imported articles of the
game description, the fact is e.2
that competition amongourdomestioprodueers
sometimes has the effect of keeping the price of
their products below the highest limit Uwei
by such duty. But it Is notorious at . this
competition is too often strangled by MmW
tion qu.te prevalent at this time, and fre
nuently called trusts, which have for their ob
ject the regulation -t the supply and pnoeot.
commodities made snd sold by members of toe
combination. The people can hardly hope for
any consideration in the operation of these
selfish schemes. If. however, in the absence
of such combinations, a healthy and free com
petition reduces the prio of any particular
dutiable article Of home production below tne
limit ? which It might otherwise rea.??
under our tariff laws, and if, with
such reduced prices,- its manufacture
continues to thrive, it is entirely evident that
one thing has been discovered which should be
carefully scrutinized in an effort to reduce taxa
tion. The necessity of combination to main
tain the price of any commodity to the tariff
point furnishes proof that some one is willing
to accept lower prices for such commodity, and
that such prices are remunerative: and lower
prices produced by competition prove the same
thing. Thus where either of these conditions
exist a case wonld seem to be presented for
an easy reduction of taxation.
The considerations which have been present
ed touching our tariff laws are intended only to
enforce an earnest recommendation that the
growth of the surplus revenues of the Govern
ment be prevented by the reduction of our cus
toms duties, and, at the same time, to emphasize
a suggestion that in accomplishing this pur
pose, we may discharge a double duty to our
people ty granting to then a measure of relief
from tariff taxation in quarters where it is most
needed and from sources where it can be most
fairly and justly ai-corded.
Nor can the presentation mado of such con
siderations be. with any degree of fairness, re-,
garded as evidence of unfriendliness toward our
manufacturing interests, or of, any lack of ap
preciation of their value and importance.. These
interests constitute a leading and most sub
stantial element of our National great
ness and furnish the proud proof of
our country's progress. - But- if in the
emergency that presses upon us our manufact
urers are asked to surrender something forthe
public good and divert disaster, their patriot
ism, as well as a grateful recognition of advan
tages already afforded, should lead them to
willing co-operation. 'No demand is made that
they shall forego all ' the benefits of govern
mental regard: but they can not fail to be ad
monished of their duty, as well as their enlight
ened self-interest and" safety, when they are re
minded of the fact that finan--ial panic and col
lapse, to which the present condition tends,
afforded no greater shelter or . pro
tection to our manufactures -than to
our other important :- enterprises. . Oppoiv
tunity for safe, careful and deliberate reform is
now offered ; and none of us should be unmind
ful of a time when an abused and irritated peo
ple, heedless of ihose who have resisted timely
and reasonable relief, may insist upon a radical
and sweeping rectiflcation of their wrongs,
The difficulty attending a wise and fair .re
vision of our tariff laws is not underestimated.
It will require on the part of Congress great
labor and care, and especially a broad and
National contemplation of the subject, and a
patriotic disregard- of such local and selfish
claims as are unreasonable " and reckless
of tho welfare of the entire country.- Under our
present laws more than four thousand articles
are subject to duty. Many of these do not in
any way compote with our own manufactures,
and many are hardly worth attention as sub
jects of revenue. A considerable reduction can
be made in the aggregate by adding them to the
free list. The taxation of luxuries presents no
fe.rvtures of harrthio; but the necessaries of
life, used and consume .! by all the people, the
duty upon which a ids to the cost of living in
every -home, should be greatly cheapened. The
radical reduction of the duties imposed upon
raw5 material used in manufactures, or its free
importation, is of course an important factor in
any effort to reduce the price of these neces
saries. It would not only relieve them from the
increased cost caused by. the tariff on
such material, but the manufactured
product, being thus cheapened, that part ot the
tariff now laid upon such product, as a com
pensation to our manufacturers for the present
price of raw material. . could be accordingly
modified. Such reduction, or free importation,
would serve besides to largely reduce the rev
enue. - It is not apparent how such a change can
have any injurious effect upon manufacturers.
On the contriry, it would appear to give them
a better chance in foreign markets with the
manufacturers of other countries, who cheapen
their wares by free material. Thus our people
might have the opportunity of extending their
sales beyond the limits of home
consumption, saving them from the depression,'
interruption in business, and loss caused by a
glutted domestic market, and affording their
employes more certain and steady labor, with
its resulting quiet and contentment, u
The question thus imperatively presented for
solution should be approached in a spirit higher
than partisanship, snd considered la the light
of that regard for patriotic duty which should
characterize the action of those intrusted with
the weal of a confiding people. But the obliga
tion to declared party rolicy and principle is
not wanting to urge prompt and effective ac
tion. " Both of the great political parties now
represented in the Govern ment have, by repeat
ed and auihoritative declarations, condemned
tneconaition oi our laws which permit the col
lection from the people of unncessarv revenue,

its (nrrpiHnn- -in,l noithai. ,ir nn, n ... . , . . ;
its correction ; and neither as citizens or parti
sans are our countrymen in a mood to condone
the deliberate violation of these pledges.
Our progress toward a wise conclusion will
not be improved by dwelling upon the theories
of protection and free trade. This savors too
much of bandying epithets. It is a condition
which confronts, us not a theory. Relief from
this condition may involve a slight reduction of
the advantages which we award our home pro.
ductions, but the entire withdrawal ol
such advantages should not be contemplat
ed. The question of free trade is absolutely'
irrelevant: and, the persistent claim made in
certain quarters that all efforts to relieve the
people from unjust and unnecessary taxation
are schemes of so-called free traders, is mis
chievous and far removed from any considera
tion forthe public good. The simple and plain
duty which we owe the people is to reduce
taxation to the necessary expenses, of an,
economical operation of the Government, and
to restore to the business ot the country the
money which we hold in the treasury through
.the perversion of governmental powers. T'tye
things can and should be done with safetyto
all our industries, without danger to the op
portunity for remunerative labor which our
workingmen need,and with benefit to them and
all our people, by cheapening their means oi
subsistence and increasing , the measure of
tneir comrorts. . . , ,, . . , ;
The' Constitution provides that the President
shall from time to time, give to the Congress
.information of the State of the Union. It has
been the custom of the Executive, in compli
ance with this provision, to -annually exhibit to
Congress, at the opening of its session, the
general condition of the country and to. detail
with some particularity, the operations of tho
different executive departments. I .would be
especially agreeable to follow this course at
. the present time, and to call attention to the
valuable accomplishments of these - de
partments during the last fiscal year.
But I am so much., impressed with the

element of our safety and prosperity depends.
The reports of the heads departments, which J

formation touching the transactions or the
business intrusted fo them and such recom

interest as they deem advisable. I ask for

ance. 5 Upon being presented to the Chris
tian workers in the East room, the Presi
dent said: "I am glad to meet so large a
delegation from the Evangelical Alliance
of the United States. 1 understand the
purpose of this alliance to be the applica
tion of Christian rules of conduct to the
problems and exingencies of social and po
litical life. Such a movement can not fail
to produce the most valuable results. AU
must admit that the reception of the teach
ings of Christianity results in the purest
patriotism, in the most scrupulons fidelity
to public trust and in ths brst type of citi
zenship. "Those who mahare the affairs
of government, are by this means re
minded that the law of God demands that
they should be courageously true to tho
interests of the people, and that the Ruler
of the Universe will require of them a
strict account of their stewardship. The
people, too, are thus taught that their
happiness and welfare will be
best-, promoted by a conscientious
C-ritd for the interest of a common
brotherhood, and that the success of a
Government by the people depends upon
the morality, the justice and the honesty
of the people. : I am especially pleased to
know that your efforts are not cramped
and limited by denominational lines and
that your credentials are found in jx broad
Christian fellowship. Manifestly, if yon
seek to teach your countrymon toleration
you yourselves must be tolerant; if you
would teach them liberality for the
opinions of each other you yourselves
must be liberal, and if you would teach
them unselfish patriotism you yourselves
must be unselfish and patriotic.
There :,: is enough of . work in the
field you hava entered to enlist
hearty co-operation of alt who believe
in the vatue and efficiency of Christian
teaching and practice. Your noble mis
sion, if undertaken in- a broad and
generous spirit, will surely arrest the at
tention and respectful consideration of
your fellow-citizens, and your endeavors,
consecrated by benevolence and patriotic
iove, must exert a powerful' influence in
the enlightenment and improvement of
our people in illustrating the strength and
stability of our institutions, and in ad
vancing the prosperity and greatness of
our beloved land." ' . ; , -
