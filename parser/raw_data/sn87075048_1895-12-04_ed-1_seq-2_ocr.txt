Hoaxers for Prlvut-i Secretiiry to
Governor Buslinotl.
Says the Ohio Stuto Jouriml,
"Those who pretended to bo next
to tho Governer's throne werp
treated to a surprise" in his recent
appointment, and surprises often
moan disappointments.

fur Governor was thought of wo
said In an editorial "Keep your eye
on Jim Campbell this fall;" and a
world of eyes wero on him before
tho fall passed. Wo say again,
"Keep your eye on Jim Campbell
next fall."
A di:taim:u statement of tho
piins and losses or the two leading
parties at the recent election has
been prepared in tho oillce of the
Secretary of State and shows that
tho net Ilepublicnn gain over the
vote of 1801 was 13,103, while the
not Democratic gain was87,G17.
Point, if you dare, Republican
calamity howler, to one interest
that you predicted death to, under
tho Wilson bill, but.hns sprung in
to newness of life since its passage;
and was as dead as u door nail un
der tho Mcltinlcy bill. Ye,t here's
one. Wo forget it. Tho tramp
business Is about destroyed. Jack
son Herald.
Ahout the only pooplo who seem
desirous ol having drover Cleve
land accept a third term of the
presidency are our Republican
friends. Wo do not believe Hint
tho president himself nor any of
tho Democratic, lenders hnvo any
idea of nominating him for n third
term. Tho Democratic party is
not enough in favor of paternalism
for that. Marion Democrat.
By all means let us hnvo a
pompous inaugural of Governor
Buslinell. Let (hero be n stunning
array of soldiery, with guns and
horses and sabres. Let a few per
sons be killed as evidence thnt'our
state government is alive, and
ready for business after January 13
next. A big parade in tho day and
n big ball at night will help tho
taxpayer to bear their burdens.
The Texas Democrat, published
nt Bonlm.n, says this paper started
out as a "round money" organ, and
strnyed nwny Into tho free silver
fold. Which might bo taken as
true, for blmetalism provhTes for
hound money. Tho goldltes, how
over, claim that no money is sound
unless the monarchies of Europe
upprovo it. A fig for such doctrine.
Let us havo money that tho people
of this country npprove; and then
if wo can't paddle our own canoe
we'll sellout to England altogether.
It seems strange, however, that a
brother Democrat bhould so lacer
ate tho truth. Wetfierjord (Texas)

TUB SlIiVEIt DEMOCRATS
l'roposo Making nil Independent
Campaign IfNcccRsarf.
The pllver Democrats of Ohio,
propose going Into the presidential
campaign next year. Judge E. J.
Blandln, who stands close to
Allen W. Thurman, of Col
umbus, sahl that plans wero being
formed for the nomination of a sli
ver enndiduto for tho presldenoy.
A conference of tho silver men
will be lipid in January, either nt
Chicago or Washington, tonrrnngo
for a convention to bo held in April
next.
It Is proposed to nominnte Sibley
of Pennsylvnn!nt for president, nnd
somo western mnn for vico presi
dent. "With thoso cnndldatcs,"
said Judge Blandln, "wo will go to
tho Democratic national conven
tion nnd ask for Its endorsement
Jf tho Democrats rcfuso to endorso
tho ticket, wo name, wo shall make
an Independent campaign."
Tho Coming Mcssniro.
It has been announced, 'from
Washington, upon what authority
wo do not know, that the message
which President Clcvoland will
send to tho 54th congress nnd to
the bennto will bo short
nnd dovotod almost entirely
flnnnclnl affairs. It is to ho believ
ed that this announcement is noth
ing more than n inore guess based
on what scorn reasonable probabil
itics. Any ono reviewing national
nffalrs at this time from tho stand
point of President Cleveland,
should bo able to discover without
nny great mental effort that the
chief executlvo ol thonntion under
present conditions can say but very
llttln except in relation to tho op
eration of tho new tariff law and in
connection with tho financial af
fairs and prospects of the govern
ment. Of course he can communi
cate silent tacts of the reports of
the various cabinet officials and he
can touch.'very briefly upon foreign
affairs, but tho burden of tho argu
ment, if tliero Is nny attempted,
must rest upon tho business out
look. Tliero is every reason nlsn
why President Clovelnnd should
cut that portion of his message
down to ns fow words ns possible.
His position is well known nnd he
probably realizes that further ex
planation is unnecessary. It is to
bo expected, however, that the
message will contain ono or two
strong recommendations In con
nection with foreign affairs. For
in'stn'nce, tho president will proba
bly recommend federal participa
tion in tho Nicaragua cnnal and he
may hnvo something to say about
tiio Alaska boundary question. It
is hardly to bo believed, however,
that tho president will go into the
Venezuelan question.
Mr. Cleveland has a splendid op
portunity to make somo new
friends by this message and it Is
more than probnblo that he will do
so. Tho firmer his declaration up
on tho financial question the more
pronounced will bo tho applause
foi his message.

At A mketino of tho Columbus

legislation effecting their business
was discussed. Tho legislative

recent election, and they wore

know they aro In the helpless mi

othor night they decided that It
would bo useless to oppose tho
the passage of tho Haskell local op

hands off. They argued Hint they
.M'ouldn't prevent thepiiHsago of tho
Ifuskell bill Jftho Republicans pd
desired, and that it would he a
waste of time nnd funds to fight It.
They are hoping Hint tho passage
of tho Haskell bill will cause it re

A certain captnin once left Mar
seilles for China, but being buffeted
by tho winds, made for tho harbor
of Tunis to await tho better weuth
cr. Tho collector of the port came
on board, and, although the captnin
stated that ho was freighted for
Canton, and hud nothing to do
with Tunis, tho collectorsucceeded
In proving to him that ho must pay
his harbor dues:
Captain B, did so, butinstnlit-
ly repaired to tho palace of the Bey
nnd demanded justice.
"Good FrHiik," said tho Bey. "I
am your friend. What do

"Highness," nnswored tho cap
tain, "you custom house has rob

"Excellent Individual," answered
tho Bey, "In this country when wo
hnvo tho money, wo keep It. Tho
Iltst acquisition Is a difficulty, but
toglvo back a thing Is unknown
In Africa."
"Shall I not have Justico then?"
"Certainly you ahull; everyone
has Justice in Tunis. Will you
have it in French or Tunis fubh-
ion ?" ,
"So he it then," replied the Bey.
"What Is your cargo.
"Marseilles soap and 20,000 cot
ton caps."
"It is w ell; go nwny nnd bo tranquil."
Tho Bey then summoned his
Vl.er, "Vlzer," suld he, "wo lovo
