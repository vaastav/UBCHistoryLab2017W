Governor Cutler Introduced. .
It Is now my pleaant duty to introduce
to you the first speaker of the evening
and the first man of the state, who will
bid our honored guests welcome In behalf
of the imperial commonwealth of Utah.
It lu my testimony that he Is a sincere,
honest and honorable man a capable,
self-mado man, and a gentleman in all
that tho word implies. He came to Utah
when but a mere boy, before the shriek
of the locomotive revorberated through
our mountains. He came across the
great plains in a rude wagon drawn by
oxen and it took him as many months ns
ft took you. my visiting friends, days, to
make the journey. Since thoso days he
has l'vcd to see our desert places where
at first only lizards crept and cricket?
riak"(l. blossom Into farms and gardens
whore tho fruits of tho earth are gar
nered in abundance, where roses bloom,
whore pink cheeked children swing their
baskets on their way to school, and where
the Grand Army of the Republic will hold
its next annual' encampment. By hig own
energy and Industry, coupled with an in
stinct for business and raro good judg
ment he has risen from adversity to af
fluence, from obscurity Into the llmcr
light of official distinction, and while thus
carving out his own destiny he has helped
to build the commonwealth of which he Is
ono of its strongest pillars.
He is the-second governor of the stato
of Utah, and the second best governor tho
state has cvor known. Let me present
tho Hon. John C. Cutler.
ADDRESS OF WELCOME
BY GOVERNOR CUTLER
' Gov. Cutler was grootod with ap
plauso, after which ho spoko as follows:
There aro epoch-making events in the
experience of every Btate and city. Utah
and Salt Lake City have had their share
of these, considering: the brief hlstorv
1 of our commonwealth. But I believe tha't
the ovent this occasion refers to by an
ticipation, is ono of tho most Important
iu all our experience. The visit here of
the remnant of tho noblest band of self
saerlflcliig citizen-soldiers the world has
ever known the band that saved the
nation, freed the slaves, and protected
tho south against its own mistaken zeal,
is an occasion tho like of which we can
j hope to experience only once In a life
time. It seta a new milcpost In tho his
tory of our stato and city. The year
1009 will bo known as the year of tho
visit of the Grand Army of tho Republic
to Utah; and wo and our children shall
speak of tho years to como In terms of
measurement from this notable event.
To the commander-in-chief of this or
ganization and to thoso who are with
him, I extend tho welcome and the greet
ings of the Stato of Utah. To you, Henry
M. Nevius, commandor-in-chief of the
G. A. R., and through you to your gal
lant comraden, I give the freedom of our
Utah. I officially notify you now that
when you come In forco next summer
there will bo no re-slstanco to your inva
sion. Wo shall surrender without a
struggle. Every loyal citizen, and wo
have no others, will open his heart and
his homo; and our wlvos and mothers and
sisters and daughters will feel thomselv.ns
honored in extending to you the hos i
tnllty for which those homes of ours f!ro
famous.
Honoring Oursolves.
( In honoring tho Grand Army of tho
Republic wo honor ourselves still more.
Your great and splendid organization Is
fast dwindling In number. And, thank
God, it hos not been succeeded by an
other of similar origin, und I trust It
never will be. For wo shall always pray
that the darkness and death of such a
war as made your fame shall never cover
and devastate our land again. There
has been but ono Grand Army of the Re
public in nil our history. And much ns
we honor you, sincerely ns we thank you.
deeply as wo appreciate you, wc hope
there will never be another. An I said,
your ranks are thinning. Tho llnal roll
call and the welcoming words of appro
bation, "Come up higher," are drawing
your comrades from you.
liven tho youngest and most vigorous
who Burvive must, like all of us who
remember "tho tlmo that tried men's
souls." soon answer thnt summons and
make their bed with Grant and Leo. und
Sherman and Jackson. Therefore, it will
not bo permitted for tho nation to give
you personal recognition bevond a lim
ited time. To us thin privilege may novor
come again after next summer. Yet It
is not becauso lt Is the first tlmo or tho
last opportunity we have- had to honor
ourselves and our state by giving you
greeting and enhancing your sood cheer,
but because we feel that you are worthy
of more than wo can give, that wo aro
proud of the distinction you bestow upon
our city and stato by holding your en
campment hore.

I VITUPERATIVE SCORING
i OF EDITORS EX JOYED
. I
j Executive Seemingly Exhausts
Vocabulary- in Denouncing
; Objects ol' "Wrath.
I . WASHINGTON, Dec. 15. Kcpeaied
I peals of laughter greeted the reading
; of tho opening paragraph of President
R.oosevelt's messago lo congress on the
Panama charges today. As the secre
tary read the statement that the charges
I were " false in every particular," Sen
ator Bailey laughed outright. .Othcr
senators oil both sides of the chamber
.joined with him, and when the reader
reached the statement that a statement
in a newspaper which he mentioned
would not bo believed, 'here "was gen
eral merriment.
There was only a small number of
senators present when the reading was
begun.' and wss hurried through, the
I papers accompanving the message not
being read at all.
The mcssago elicited the greatest in
terest in the houso. The members gave
closo attention during the readinjr of
the document, and there was a ripple
of laughter over the president's char
acterization of Joseph Pulitzer, po
lisher of tho New York World.
Tho message, with its accompanying
papers, was referred to committee. An
abstract of the message follows:
j - Panama Canal Message.
1 President Roosevelt today sent to the
I senate a statement concerning tho pur-
I chase of tho Panama canal property by
the United States, denouncing in strong
languago charges that there was any
thing wrong in the acquisition by tho
1 Unitod States of tho canal property.
' "These stories," ho continues, ''were
first brought to my attention as pub
lished in a paper in Indianapolis called
the News, edited by Mr. Delavan Smith.
Tho stories were scurrilous and libelous
in character and false in every essen
tial particular. Mr. Smith shelters him
self bobind tho excuse that be merely
accepted the statements which had ap
peared in a paper published in New
York, tho World, owned by Mr. Joseph
-Pulitzer. It ifi idle-to say that the
knon character of Mr. Pultiner. and
his newspaper are such that tho state
ments in that paper will be believed
by nobody; unfortunately, thousands of
persons arc ill-informed in this respect
and bolievo tho statements they see
printed, ovon though they apnea r in a
newspaper published by Mr. Pulitzer."
Summarizing charges made in this
j connection, the president says: j
Roast tor Editors. 1
''Theso statements sometimes ap-j
peared in tho editorials, sometimes in j
the news columns, sometimes in the
shape of contributions by individuals
cither unknown or known to be of bad
character. They are false in every par-,
ticular from beginning to end. - The
wickeduess of tho slanders is only sur
passed by their fatuity. So utterly
baseless are the stories that apparently
thoj' represent iu part merely material
collected for campaign purposes and in
part stories originally conceived with
a view of positive blackmail. Tho in
ventor of tho story about Mr. Charles
P. Taft, for instance, ovidenth sup
posed that at somo period of the Pan
ama purchase Mr. William Taft was
secretary of war. whereas, in reality
Mr. William IT. Taft never became sec
retary of war until long after the wholo
transaction in question had been closed.
The inventor of the story about Mr.
Douglas Robinson had not taken the
tronblo to. find out tho fact that Mr.
Robinson hud not had the slightest con
nection, diroctly or indirectly, of any
kind or sort with any phase of the
Panama transaction from beginning to
end. The men who attached Mr. Root
in the matter had not taken the trouble
to read tho public documents, which
would havo informed them that Mr.
Root had nothing to do with the pur
chase, which was entirely arranged
through tho department of justice un
der then Attorney General Mr. Ivuo..
No Shadow of Proof.
''Now theso stories, ns a matter o
fact, need no investigation whatever.
Nofc shadow of proof has been, or can
bo, produced in behalf of any of them.
They consist mainly of a string of iu
famous libels. In lorm thoy are partly
libels upon Mr. Taft and Mr. Robinson,
for instance; but they aro in fact
wholly, nd. in form partly, a libol
upon the.Uuitcd States government. 1
do not Mlievo we should concern our
selves with the particular individuals
who write the lying and libelous edi
torials, articles from correspondents, or
articles in tho news columns. The real
offender is Mr. Joseph Pulitzer, editor
and nroprictor of tho World. While the
criminal offense of which Mr. Pulitzer
has been guilty is in form a libel upon
individuiinls, the great injury dono is in
blackening the good nnnio ot' the Ameri
can people it should not bo left to a
I private cir.izen to sue Mr. Pulitzer for
1 libel, lie should be prosecuted for libel
I by the govornmont authorities. In
point of encouragement, of iniquity, in
I point of infant, of wrong doings, thcro
is nothing to choose between a public
servant who betrays his trust, a public
servant who is guilty of blackmail or
theft, or financial dishonesty of any
kind, and a man guilty as Mr. Pulitzer
has bocn guilty in this instance. In
is therefore a high national duty to
brings to justice this villifior of tho
American people, this man who wan
tonly and wickedly, and without ono
shadow of justification, seeks to

LOGAN, Dec. 15. A killing, entire- j
ly unprovoked, occurred in this citv ' ij;H
this evening about S o'clock, when lll
John W. Att. without the slightes1- Hiul
provocation and without a -svord of j iUH
warning, fhofc and" instantly killed ' f;'H
Junius Nelson, in the doorway of the I''iH
former's house. Nelson had gone to j juJH
Att's house with a party of men on '(!'!
a purely friendly mis-ion. and the mo- i-!lH
mcnt the door "was opeucd Att imme- PiH
diately fired, tho bullet entering Nel- 'itjjH
son s breast and causing instant death. j fhllH
The news spread over the city liko flrjH
wildfire, and the police bad hard work j jrj
to keep the mob which quickly gath- !
ered from hanging Att to the neaies' f- .ijH
telegraph pole and riddling !ii3 body j
with bullets. ; p
Earlier in the evening Att. visitad 3 ; ti jjH
saloon, and while there became in- j. ,r
volved in an altercation with Isaac. . !)
j Elweil. After a time tha two men ! S' IH
separated, and Att went to his home. ftifH
! A party of his friends, hearing of tho v
I trouble, started for Att's home to lean jj
the nature of the "dispute. Arriving, , vh
I Nelson knocked on tho door. Somebodv ,
opened it from within, and as Nelson li'lH
I -tarted to enteV a shot rang out and ; V
I Nelson fell backward to tho ground, IH
I dead. It is presumed that Att mi? I r ,
j took the mission of the paTty, sup ! t t
posing them to be seeking- him to setti" I Ji j
matters growing out of his trouble with . .

Mob Quickly Gathers. . ; ,)
In a few moments the uews of the j
killini; had spread, and a mob gathered j 1
at Ait's house, bent upon hurra to the )'iiH
slayer. Marshal Petorsou was soon ; M(fl
there,' affd he immediately placed Att ,
under arrest and locked him up. Th" HitH
crowd followed Ihe prisoner to tha 1. IH
police station, hooting and ycUing at 'M
him all tho way, and Att was glad to ili-'ilH
be locked in n cell out of the threaten- , ;,,
intr dangordf-;tbem0b. All tho way 10 i k' IH
jail there were cries of "Lynch bim." rl
"Ha is no gbod," "'"String him up." ' ;
and occasionally it looked as though 1
the mob would 'tear the prisoner aw;r i -'liiH
from the officer. Jt was with consid-
arable difficulty that Marshal Potr- i':JH
soii kept the crowd away. but. uevr- i i'lJH
theirs?, Att' felt something of the fun 1 i-j
of tho crowd br various blows landed
upon him despito the marshal's protee 1 ijH
tioii. 1
I Concealed Weapon Pound. T
As 'soon as Att had boen locked up. tl
the crowd returned ro his house- ami 1 ' 'il
mado a careful search for the weapon
ho had used. After a diligent search . "-tH
.it was found beneath a pile of clothing, ; j Vl
and was found to be a .0$ caliber Smith ,
& Wesson, fullv loaded, except for tin : ? '.jH
one chamber which had been fired into r :
Nelson's body. t ),'
Aft had boen drinking rather' heavilv tH
during the day. and those who saw him i MI
previous to the tragedy assert that ho ij iH
was drunk. He was 40 years of age. iK-
and had lived here but a short time. K!'JH
His wife recently secured a divorce if
from him. '
Nelson was 2S years of ago, and i
leaves a bride of three months. Ho ' .
was well liked and has always borne y. -M
an excellent reputation. H
Aft will bo arraigned in court tomor- 1
row on a charge of murder in the first If V 'tH
degree.
