FtOcv-eiliient of thr SmaU
and Homt of Htprtttnlaihtt:
Since jour last annual assembling au
other year of health And bouutitul buTuts
bupuivd. And while it baa not pi eased
tbe Almighty to bins us with a retam or
PMC*, ire 6?n but preu on, guided by tli?
best light He girts us, trailing that Id Hi.
own go jd time, and wise war, all will ret
bewail. '
The correspondence toacbing foreign af-,
which Las taken place duriog the last
year if herewith submitted! in rirtual com
pliance with a request to tbst effeot, made
by ?.be House of Representatives near tbe
close of the last session of Congress,
If tbe conditions of our relations with
other nations is less gratifying than It has 1
usually been at lortner periods, it is cer
tainl} more satisfactory than a nation so
unhappily distracted aa we are, might reas
onably bare apprehended. Id the month
of June last there were some grounds-to
expect that tbe maritime powers whicb, at
tbe beginning of our domestic difficulties,
10 u(?W''ely and unneceaiurily, as we think,
recognized the insurgents as ? belligerent,
would Soon recede from that position,
which has proved only Jess injurious to
themselves, than to our o?u country. But
tbe temporary reverses which afterwards
befell the national arrnp, and which were ex
aggerated by 1 our own disloyal citizens
abroaJ, have hitherto delayed the aat of
simple justice'.'
The civil war, which has so radically
changed, for tbe moment, tbe occupations
and habits of tbe Amerlcau people, has nec
essarily disturbed the social condition, and
Mooted very deeply the prosperity of the
nations with which we bare carried on a
commerce that bas been steadily increas
ing throughout a period of half a century.
?V' "*? il4me excited political
ambitions and apprehensions which have
produced a profound agitation throughout
the civilized world. In this unusual agi
tation we have forborne from ukingpart
in any controversy between foreign states,
and between parties or factions in such
states. We have attempted no propagad
ism* and acknowledged no revolution. But
we bava left to every nation tbe exclusive
conduct and management of its own affairs.
Our struggle bas been, of course, contem
plated by foreign nations with reference
less to Its own merits, than to its suppos
ed, and often exaggerated effects and con
sequences resulting to those nations them
selves. Nevertheless, complaint on tbe
part of tbis government, even if it were
just, would certainly ba uo-rise.
The treaty with Great Britain for the
suppression of the slave trade has been
put into operation with a good prospect o
complete success. It is an occasion ol
special pleasure to acknowledge that tbe
execution of it, on the part of her Majes
ty's government, has been marked with a
jealous respect for the authority of tb<
United States, and tbe rights of their our.
?1 and loyal citizens.
The convention with Hanover for tbt
abolition of tbe state dues lias been car
ried into effect, under the act of Congress
for that purpose.
A blockade of three thousand miles ol
sea-coast could not be established, and
vigorously enforced, in a season of great
commercial activity like the present, with
out committing oecaaiuual mistakes, and
inflicting unintentional injuries upon
foreign natloos and their subjeets.
A civil war occurring in a country whor<
foreigners reside and carry oo trade uodei
treaty ?tipulations, is necessarily fruitful
of complaints of the violation of natural
rights. All such collisions tend to excitt
misapprehension, and possibly to product
mutual reclamations between nations wbioh
have a common Interest in preserving peace
and friendship. In clear oases of these
kinds I bare, so far as possible, heard and
redressed oomplaintt which have beeo
presented by frienSlly'powers. There i>
still, however, a large and augmenting
number of doubtful cases upon wbicb the
government is unable to agree with the
governments whose protection Is demand
ed by the claimants. There are, more
over, many cases in which tbe United
States, or their citizens, suffer wrongs
from the naval or miliury authorities of
foreign nations, wbioh tbe government of
those are not at once prepared to redress.
I have proposed to some of the foreign
Itates, thus interested, mutual conventions
to examine and adjust sucb complaints.
Tbis proposition has been made especially
to Oreat Britain, to France, to 9|>ain, and
to Prussia. In each case it bas been kindly
received, but baa not yet been formally
adopted.
I deem it my dnty to recommend an ap
propriation in behalf of tbe owners of the
Norwegian bark Admiral P. Tordensklold,
which vessel was, in May, 1861, prevented
by the commander ef the blockading force,
off Charleston from leaving that port wltb
cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege
bad, shortly bsfore, been granted to an
English vessel. I have directed the See
retary of State to cause tbe 'papers In the
case to be communicated to tbe proper
committees.
Application bave been made to me by
many fire Americans of African'descent to
iavor their emigration, with a view
to such colonisation as ;eas contemplated
in recent acts of Congress. Other parties,
at home and abroad?some from interested
motives, others from patriotic considera
tions, and still others influenced by philan
thropic sentiments?have suggested slmi
1 lar measures; while, on tbe other hand,
' several of the Spanish American republice
have protested agaiait tbe sending of such
colonies to their respective territories.?
Under these clrcumstanoes.'t bave declined
to more any sucb colony to any autei with
out first obtaining the consent of its gov.
ernment, with aa agreement on Its part to
reeeive and protect such entfgnuiu in al
tbe rights of freemen; anti I bave 'at tb<
same time, offered to tbe eeVdnal state
situated within tbe tropics, or having coli
onies there, to negotiate with them," subject
to tbe advice and ooasent of the Senate, to
-ilavor-the voluntary emigration of persons
, of that class to tbeir respective territories,
upon conditions wbicb shall be equal, jost,
and humane. Liberia and HayU, are, es
yet, the only countries to wbleh colonists
or African descent from here, could go
With certainly of being received and adop
ted as citizens; and I regret to say s&ch
persons, oontemplating colonisation, do
nojt seem willing to migrate to tboM tMfjm
tries, as, to some others, nor so willlng-ts
I think their lnternt demands. I believe,
however; opinion among them, thle< *>
spect, is Improving; and that, ere lqjgi
there will be an augmented, and considers
?ble migration to both these countries,
rom the United Statea.
rr The,?'w commercial twty between the
united Sutra and the Sultan of Turkey baa
t>een carried into execution.
A commercial and consular treaty has
been negotiated, ipbj#ct- to tbt Senate1#
consent, with Liberia ; and a similar nego-'
liation is now pending with tbe republic
of Hayti. A considerable improvement of
the national commerce ia expected to result
from tbe^e measures.
Our relatione witb Great Britain, Prance,
Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark,
Sweden, Austria, tbe Netherlands, Italy,
Home, and all the other Kuropean slates
remain undisturbed. Very favorable rela
tions also continue to be maintained with
Torkey, Moroeeo, China, and Japan.
During tbe Ust year there has not only
been no change of one. previous relations
with the independent states of our owa
continent, but more friendly sentiments
than have heretofore existed, are believed
to be entertained by theseneigbbors, whose
safety and progress are so intimately con
nected with oar own. This statement es
pecially applies to Mexico, Nioaragua,
Ooita Rica, Honduras, Per* and Chili.
Tbe commission under tbe conrention
with the republic of .New Grenada closed
its session, witbont having audited and
passed npon, all the claims which were
submitted to it. A proposition is pending
to revive the convention, that it may be
able to do more complete justice. Tbe
joint commission between the United States
and tbe republic of Coeta III& has com
pleted its labors and submitted its repart.
I have favored the project for connecting
tbe Uuited States with Europe by nn At
lantlo telegraph, and a similar project to
extend tbe telegraph from San Francisco,
to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the
line whlcu is being extended across the
Russian empire.
The Territories of tbe United States, with
unimportant exceptions, have remained
undisturbed by the civil war: and they
are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity
as juati6es an expectation that aou.e of
them will 8oon soon be in coudition to be
organised as States, and be constitution
ally admitted into the federal Union.
The immense mineral resources of some
of those Territories ought to be developed
as rapidly as possible. Every step in that
direction would have a tendency to 1m
prove the revenges of the government, and
diminish the burdens of tbe people. It is
worthy of yonr serious consideration
whether some extraordinary measures to
promote that end cannot be adopted. The
means which snggests Itselt as most likely
to be effective. Is a scientific exploration
of the mineral regions in those Territories,
with a view to the publication of its re
mits at home and in foreign conntrles
results which cannot fail to be ausplcions.
The condition of tbe finances will claim
your most diligent consideration. The
vast expenditure incident to the military
and naval operations required for tbe sup
pression of the rebellion, have hitherto
been met with a.promptitude, and certain
ty, unusuaHn similar oircumstances ? and
the public credit has been fully maintained
The continuance of the war, however, and
the increased disbursements uiade neces
sary by tbe augmented forces now in the
held, demand your best reflections as to the
best modes of providiog the necessary
revenue, without injury to business, and
labor "" leB" pos,ible burdens upon
The suspension of specie payments by tbe
banks,at tbe commencement of your last ses
sion made large issues of United States note!
unavoidable. In no otber way could tb<
payment of the troops, and tba satisfaction
of other just demands, bo so economscally
or so well provided for. The judicious le<
0oDKrc8?i securing tbe receiv.
ability of these notes for loans and interna
duties, and making them a legal tender foi
other debts, has made them an universal
currency, and bas satisfied, partially al
least, and for the time, the long felt w'ani
or an uniform circulating medium, savins
thereby to the people, immense sums it
discounts and exchanges.
A return to specie payments, however
at the earliest period compatible with dm
regard to all interests concerned, sboulc
ever be kept in view. Fluctuations in the
valae of currency are always injurious, and
to reduce these fluctuations to tbe lowest
possible point will always be a lendinc
purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility
prompt and certain convertibility into coin
is generally acknowledged to be Itbe best
and surest safeguard against tbem: and il
isi extremely djubtful whether a circulation
or United State notes, payable in coin, and
sufficiently large for tbe wants of the peo
fym"uufuePd"m'"nUy- U9efU"y"nd
Is there, then, any other mod. in which
the necessary provision for the public wauti
can be made, and the great advantages of
a safe and uniform currency secured 7
I know of none which promises so cer
tain results, and ia, at the same time, so
unobjectionable, as the org.nix.tioi of
banking associations, under a general act
of Confess, well guarded in Its provisions.
J0 *u?'1 associations the government tnijrbt
Vn^.?!?ul*ting notes, on the security
of United States bonds deposited -In the
treasury. Tbese notes, prepared uoder the
supervision of proper officers, beiog uni
form in appearance and seenrity, and con
veruble always into coin, would at once
protect labor .gainst the evils of a vicious
currency, and facilitate commerce by cheap
and safe exchanges.
A moderate reservation from the interest
on tbe bonds would compensate the United
States for the preparation and dlstributinn
of the notes, and a general supervision of
the system, and would lighten the burden
of that part of tbe public debt employed a.
securities. The poblic credit, moreover
would be greatly improved, and the nego
tiation of new loans greatly facilitated bv
for government
[bonds which'the adoption of the pioHosed
system would create.
It it an additional recommendation of
the measure, of considerable weight, to my
I judgment, that It would reconcile, as fir..
' possible, all existing interests, by, the op
portnnlty offered to existing Institutions to
recognise, under tbe act, substituting onlr
the secured uniform national circulation for
the local and varlousclrtnlatlon, secured
and unsecured, now issued by them.

Our information on the subject of fi
nances will be fouod in tbe report of the
Secretary of the Treasury, to whose state
ments aud views I invite your most can*
did and considerate attention. -
Tbe reports ot the Seretarios of W*r,
and of the Navy, are herewith transmitted.
These reports, though lengthy, *r? scarce
ly more than brief abitracu of tbe very
uumerous and extensive transactions
and operations conducted through
those departments. Nor could I
give a aommarr of them here, up
on any prlnoiple. which would ad
mit of its being much >horter than the re
port themselves, i iberelore content my
self with laying the reports before you, and
asking you attention to them.
It gives me pleasure to report a decided
improvement in the financial condition of
the Post Office Department, as compared
with several preceding years. Tbe receipts
Tor the fiscal year 1861' amounted to $8,
349,39$ 40, which embraced the revenue
from all the States of tha Union for three
quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the
cessation of revenue from the so-called se
ceded States during the last fiscal year, tbe
increase of the correspondence of the loyal
States has been sufficient to produce a rev
enue during the same year of $8,299,829
90, being only $50,00* less than was de
rived from all tho States or the ITuioo dur
ing the previous year. The expenditures
show a still more favorable result. The
amount expended in 18lil was $1.1,606,759
11. For the last year theamount has been
reduced to Sll, 125.304 13, showing a de
crease of about $2,491,000 in the expendi
tures as compared with the precediogyear,
and about $3,750,000 as compared with the
fiscal year I860. The deficiency in the de
partment for the previous year was $4
1 f *
!)06 98. For the last fiseal year it was re
duced to $2,112,814 57. These favorable
results are in part owing to the cessation of
mail service in the insurrectionary States,
and in part to a careful review of all ex
penditures in that department in the inter
est of economy. The efficiency of the pos
tal service, it is believed, has also been
much improved. The Postmaster General
has also opened a correspondence, through
the Department of Stale, with foreign gov
ernments, proposing a convention of postal
representatives for the purpose of simpli
fying the rates of foreign postage, and to
expedite the foreign mails. This proposi
tion, equally important to our adopted cit
izens, and to the commercial interests ol
this country, has been favorably entertain
ed, and agreed to, by ail tbe governments
from whom replies have been received.
I ask the attention of Congress to the
suggestions Of the Postmaster General iu
bis report respecting the further legislation
required, in his opinion, for tbe benefit ol
the postal service.
Tbe Secretary of the Interior reports as
follows iu regard to the public lands :
??Tbe public laods have ceased to be a
1 source of revenue. From the 1st July,
' 1861, to the 30th September, 1862, the eo
' tire cash receipts from the sale of lands
I were $137,476 26?a sum much less than
tbe expenses of our land system during the
same period. Tho homestead law, which
I will take effect on the Is' ot January next.
? offers such inducements to settlers, thai
' sales for cash cannot be expected, to an ex
! lent sufficient to meet tbe expenses of tbt
I General Land Office, and the cost of sur
. veying and briogiog the land into market."
Tbe discrepancy between tbe sum bert
? stated as arising from tbe sules or tbe pub
I lie lands, and the sum derived from th?
same source as reported from the 1 reasurj
I Department arises, as I understand, from
l the fact that the periods of lime, though
t apparently, were not really, coincident al
' the beginning point?the Treasury report
1 including a considerable sum now, which
bad previously been reported from the in
, lerior?sufficiently large to greatly over
' reach the sum derived from tbe tbret
1 monlbs now reported upon by the Interior
> and not by the Treasury.
1 The Indian tribes upon our frontiers
? have, daring the past year, manifested a
' spirit of insubordination, and, at several
> points, have engaged in opea hostilities
against the white settlements in their vl
' cinlty. The tribes occupying the Indian
' country sooth of Kansas, renounced their
1 allegiance to the United States, and enter
ed into treaties with the insurgents -Those
who remained loyal to tbe United States
were driven from the cooutry. The chief
of tbe Oberokees baa visited this city for
the purpose of rsltoriog the former rela
! tions of the tribe with tho United States.?
He alleges that they were conitraioed, by
superior force, to enter iuto treaties with
the insurgents, and that tbe Uuited States
neglected to furnish the protection which
their treaty stipulations required.
In tbe month of August last the Sioux
Indiani, in Minnesota, attacked the settle
ments in their vicinity with extreme feroc
ity, killing, Indiscriminately, men, women,
and children. This attack was wholly un
expected, and, therefore, no means ot de
fense bad been provided. It is estimated
tbat not less than eight hundred persons
were killed by the Indians, and a large
amount of property was destroyed. How
this outbreak was Induced Is not definitely
known, and suspicions, which m*y be un
just, need not to be stated. Information
was received by the Indian bureau, from
different sources, about the time hostilities
were commenced, that a simultaneous at
tack was to be made upon tbe white settle*
meats by all tbe tribea between the Missis
sippi river and the Rockr mountains. The
Slate or Minnesota hassuffered great injory
from this Indian war. A large portion of
her territory has been depopulated, and a
severe loss bas been sustained by the de
struction of property. Tbe people of tbat
State manifest much anxiety for tbe remo
val of the tribes beyond the limits of the
State as a guarantee against future hostili
ties. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs
will furnish full details. I snbmit for roar
especial consideration whether onr Indian
system shall hot be remodeled. Many wise
and good men have impressed me with tbe
belief that this can be profitably done.
. ^submit a statement of the proceedings
of commissioners', which 'shows the pro
gress that has been made tn ibe enter
prise of constructing tha Pacific Bailroad.
And this suggests tbe earliest completion
of this road, and also the favorable action
of Congress opos the projects now pending
before them for enlarging tha capacities of
the great canals in New York and Illinois,
as being of vital, and rapidly increasing
importance to the whole nation, and espe
cially to the vaat interior region beteinaiW
to be noticed at sume greater length. I
purpose having prepared and laid before
yon at an early day some interesting and
valuable atalistical information upon this
subject. The military and commercial im
portance o??enlarging the Illinois and
Michigan canal, and improving the Illinois
river, is presented In the report of Colonel
Webster to the Secretary ol War, and now
transmitted to Congress. I respectfully
ask attention to it.
To earty oat the provisloss of the act of
Congress of tha 16th of May last, I have
caused tbe Department of Agriculture of <
the United States to be organised.
The Commit.ioner informs me that with
in the period ol a few months lb is depart
ineLt ht# established tin extensive .ystem
of correspondence and exchanges, both at
home and abroad, which promises to effect
highly beneficial results to the development
a< a correct knowledge of recent improve
ments in agriculture, in the introduction of
new products, and in the collection of the
agricultural statistics of the different
States.
Also that it will soon be prepared to dis
tribute largely seeds, cereals, .plants and
cBMtngs, and.has already published, and
liberally diffused, much valuable informa
tion in anticipation of a more elaborate re
port, which will in due time bo furnished,
embracing some valuable tests in ch.micai
science now in progress in the laboratory.
The creation of this department was for
the more immediate benefits of a large class
of our most valuable citizens ; and 1 trust
that the liberal basis upon which it bas
been organized will not only meet your ap
probation, but that it will realize, at no
J distant day, all the fondest anticipations of
Its most sanguine friends, and become the
fruitful source of advantage to all our peo
pie. __ r
On the twenty-second day of September
last a proclamation was issued by the Ex
ecutive, a copy or which is herewith sub
I Jutted.
Ia accordrtoco with the purposes ex
| pressed In the second paragraph of thai
I paper, I now respectfully recall your atten
I tion to what may be called "compensated
emancipation."
A nation may be said to consist of its
territory, its people, and iu laws. The ter
ritory is the only part which is of certain
durability. " Ooe generation pa.seth
away, and another generation cometb, but
| the earth abideth forever." It is of the
I brst importance to doly consider, and esti
mate, this ever-enduring part. That por
tion of the earth's surface which is owned
and inhabited by the people of the United
I States, is well adapted to be the borne of
one national family; and it is not well adap
ted for two, or more; Its rant extent, and
lU variety of climate and productions, are
of advantage, in this age, fur one people,
whatever tbey might have been in forme;
u S'cu?- "'^graphs, aud intelligence,
h.ve brought these, to be an advantageous
combination, for one united people.
In the inaugural address I briefly point,
ed out the total Inadequacy of disunion, at
a remedy for the differences between the
people of the two sections. I dldl.o in Ian
WlllTCll 1 caonot imPr?ve, and which,
therefore, I beg to repeat.
"One section of our country believes that
wmi"?.. ?J"' ?n,d OD&ht to be *ztendedj
while the other believes It la wrong, and
onght not to be extended. This istheonlj
substantial dispute. The fugitive slavi
clause or the Constitution, and tbe law foi
the suppression of the foreign slave trade
are each as well enforced, perhaps, a. .n,
law can ever be in^a community where the
. moral sense of the people imperfectly sup.
ports the law itself. The great body ortbt

There is no possible severing of this, but
would multiply, and not mitigate, evils
among us. In ail Its adaptations and ap
titudes, it demands anion, and abhors sep
aration. In Jact, it would, ere long, force
re-nnlon, however much of blood and trea
sure the separation might have cost.
Our strife pertains to ourselves?to the
passing generations of men; and it can,
without convulsion, be hashed lorover with
tho passing of one generation.
In this view, I recommend the adoption
9f the fallowing resolatioa and articles
amendatory to the ConitUuiiOQ ?t lb* Uni
ted States: _
"Kttolrtd Ay the Senate and Haute oj
Hepreeentative* of the United State* of Amer

shall be forever free; but all owners 0
such, who shall not have been disloyal
shall be compensated for them, at the sami
rates as is provided for States adoplinf

that no slave shall be twice accounted for
"AlTIOLS ?.
Congress may appropriate money, and
otherwise provide, for colonizing free col
ored persons, with their own consent, al
any place or places without the United
States."
I beg indulgence to discuss these propos
ed articles at some length. Without slave
ry the rebellion could never have existed
without slavery It would not continue.
Among the friends of the Union there ii
great diversity of sentiment, and of policy,
in regard to slavery, and the African race
auioogst us. Some would perpetuate
slavery; some would abolish It suddenly,
and without compensation; some would
rttnove the freed people from ns, and some
would retain them with ua; and there are
yet other minor adversities. Because of
these adversities, we waste much strength
in struggles among ourselves. By mutual
concession we should harmonise, and act
together. This would be compromise; but
it would be compromise among the friends,
and not among tbs enemies of the Union.
Tbeso articles are iutended to embody a
plan of such material concessions. If the
plan shall be adopted, It is assumed that
emancipation will follow, at least, in sever
al of the States.
As to the first article, the main points
are: first, the emancipation; secondly, the
length of time for consummating it?thir
ty-seven'years; and thirdly, the compensa
tion.
The emancipation Will be unsatisfactory
to the advocates Of perpetual slavery;
\>ut the length of time sboald greatly
mitigate their dissatisfaction. The time
spares both races from the evils of sadden
derangement?in fact, from the necessity
of any derangement?while moat of those
whose habitual course of thought will be
disturbed by the measure will have passed
away before its consummation. They will
never see It. Another class will bail the
prospect of emancipation, bnt will depre
cate the length ol time. They will feel that
it gives too little to the now liviog slaves.
But it really gives them much. It saves
them from the vagrant destitution which
must largely attend Immediate emancipa
tion in localities where their numbers are
very great; and it gives the Inspiring as
surance that their posterity shall be free
forever. The plan leaves to each State,
choosing to act nnder it, to abolish slavery
now, or at the end of the century, or at any
intermediate time, or by degrees, ex
tending over the whole or any part of the
period; and it obliges ai two States
to proceed-alike. It also provide* for com ?
pensatioo, and generally, the mode ot ma
king it. Thi*, U would seem, must farther
mitigate the dissatisfaction of lltaSd who
favor perpetual slaver), and especially ef
those who are to receive the compensation.
Doubtless some of those who are to pay,
and not to receive, will object. Yet tba
mvasnre Is both just and economical, fp>
a certain sense, the liberation of slaves it
the deetrnctlon of property?property ac
quired by descent, or by purchase, tba
same as any other property. It is BO lest
true for. having been often said1, that tba
people of the south are not more
I responsible for the original introduce
tion of this property, than are the
people of Dm aorth; and wbes it U re
membered how unhesitatingly wo all ate'
cotton and sngar,and sbara'tbe profits of
dealing in them, it may not be qaite safe
to say, that the sooth hat bees more re
sponsible than the nqrih, (or ite.continu
ance. It,- then, for a common object, this
property is to be tfcrifieil, is it not joat
thai.it be done at si common cbjuge.
And if, with less money, or money more
easily paid, we can preserve the bcajefitt of
the Union by this means, than we can by
the war aloae, Is it not also economical to
do it ? Let ns consider it then. Let ns
aaeertalo the earn we have expended in the
war sinoe compensated emancipation was
proposed lastMareh, asd consider whether,
if that measure had been promptly accept
ed, by even tome of the Slavs States, aha
same sum woald hot have dona -tut* to
sloaa the war,, than haa been otherwise
done. U so, tbe measure wonld save mon
ey, ?nd, in that view, would be ? prudent
?ad economical measure. Certainly it ia not
<o eair to pay tomtlking, u it is to pay
notiring f but it ia easier to paJ a large mm,
than it Is to pay a larger one. And it is
eaaier to pay any no tckm when ve are
?U?, than It is to pay it le/ore we ara able.
The war requires large sums, and requires
them at once. The aggregate sum neces
for compensated emancipation, of course,
would be large. But it woald require no
ready casb ; nor the bonds eve,, any faster
(than the emancipation progresses. This
might not, and prnhahly ?saW<ioll- slaat
before the end of the thirty-seven years.?
At thattfiiKWft ikall probably bare a hun
dred millions of people to share the bardan,
instead of thirty-one millions, as oper.?
And not -only so,- bor tba increase of our
sr??ss.l"jir&'!?s8K
rapidly as before; because oor lefrj
tory will not bar* become full. I 'do
not state this inconsiderately. At tba
same ratio of increase which ire hare
maintained^ on un average, from our first
national census, ia 1790, until that of
1800, we should, in UK*). bare a .popula
tion of 103,208,415. "An<f why may wo
not continue that ratio far beyond .tfiat
period? Our abundant room?our broad
national homestead?ia oor atnple re
source. Were oor territory as limited as
are the British Isles, very certainly, our
population ooold sot expand as stated.'?
Instead of receiving the foreign born, as
now, we should be compelled to pend
part of the native born away. But sucb
is not our condition. We have two mil

with a population averaging Bevehty-thre<
and one-third persons to thWtquare mile,
why may not our oountry, at some time,
average aa many? Is it less fertile? Hju
it more waste surface, by mountains, riy
f?. lakes, deserts, or other causes? 1
it inferior to Kurope in any natural ad
vantage? If, then, we are, at some time,
the past and the present; as to when i\
will be, if ever, depends much on wheth
er we maintain the Union. Several oi
our States are already above the average

id a ratio, since passing that point, vu
ever before: while no one of them is equal
to some other parts of our country, it

Taking the nation in the aggregate, aoc
we find its population and ratio of i?

objection urged against free colored per
sona remaining hi the country, which ia
largely imaginary, if not sometimes mali
cious.
It is insisted that their presenoe woald
injure, and displace white labor and white
laborers. If there ever could be a
through lime and in eternity. Is it true,
then, thaticototed" people can displace any
mow white labor, by. being free, than by
remaining slaves? If they stay in thelr
old places, they jostle no white laborers:
if they leave their old places, they leave
them open to white laborers. Logically,
thete a neither more nor less-of it.?
Emancipation, even without deportation,
would probahlv enhance the nm of
white labor, and, very surely, would not
reduce them- Thua. the customary amount
of labor would still have to be performed;
Ujafoed people Of^uldjureli notjio more

, iw uiiiuii j~- increase the demand for,

I But it Ts dreaded that the ftieed people
I will swarm forth, and cover the whole
lland? Are they not already in the land?
I Will liberation malce them more numer
|ous? Equally distributed among the
I whites of the whole country, and there
I would be but one colored, to sev.n whites.
Could the one in any way greatly disturb
I the acTcu? There are many eommuni
I ties now, having more than one frrrcolor
I ed person, to seven whites: and thisi with
I out'any apparent consciousness of evil
I from it. The District of Columbia, and
I tlic States of Maryland and Delaware, are
I all in tfei* condition. The District has
I more than one free colored to six whites;
I and yet in its frequent petitions to Coo
I cress, rbelieve it has never presented the
I presence of free colored persons as one of
I its grievances. But why should emanri
I nation south, send the freed people north;
I Kople, of any color, seldom run, unless
1 there be something to run from. Herrto
\fore colored people, to some extent, have
tied north from Widage; ajjd noir, per
I haps, from both bondage ana destitution.
, I Bfl if gradual emancipation and deporta
I tion be adopted, ther will have neidwr to
I (lei from. Their old masters will give
them wages at least until new laborers can
I be procured: and the freed, men. in turn,
I wilfgladly give their labor for the wages,
I till new homes can be found for them, m
I congenial climes, and the people of their
I own blood and race. This proposition ran
I lie trusted on the mutual interest tnvolv

decide for itself.' whether to receive them!

theory, in any case, has ;there been say
I irruption of colorcdpcoplp northward. bt?
I cause of the abolishment of alavery in
this District last spring?
I . What I have said of the proportion of
I free colored persons to the whites, in the
District; is from the census of 1880. hav
I ing no reference to persons called contra
I bands, nor to those made free by the art
| of Congress abolishing slavery here.
I The plan consisting of these article^ is
I recommended, not but that a restoration
I of the national authority would be arcepl
I ed without its adoption.
1 Nor will the war, nor proceeding* un
I der the proclamation of September ?
I 1862, be stayed I because of the irro?i??
I 'lotion of this plan. Its timely adnpHom,
II dbubt not, would bring restoration, and
ll> Aud' notwithstanding this plan, the re
I commendation that Congress provide hy
I law for compensating any State which
may adapt emancipation, before this plaa
I shall have been acted upon, whereby ear
I nestly renewed. ; Such would be only an
I advance part of the plain, and the same
I arguments apply to both. ?
This plan is recommended
inearr
X ni? pttt" lO l?.uuiiuv??- - 1 II
not in exclusion of, but additional to. all
others for restoring and preserving the: na
tional authority throughout the Lnuw.
The subject is presented exclusively in its
economical aspect. The plan would. 1
am confident, secure peace more speedi
ly, and maintain it more permaneni
' ly, than can be done by force alone:
while all it would cost, considering
amounts, and manner of payment, and
times of payment, would be easier paid
than will the additional cost of the war,
if we rely solely upon force- It is much
?very much?that it would. Cost no blood
at all.
The plan is proposed as permanent con
stitutional tew. It cannot become such
without the concurrence of, first, two
thirds of Congress, and, afterwards, three
fourths of tie States. The requwu
three-fourths of the States will necessari
ly include seven of the slave States.?
Their concurrence, if obtained, mil 5"
assurance of their severally adopting
emancipation, at no very distant <lav, npon
the new constitutional terms. This assu
rance would end the struggle now. an1!
aave the Union forever. .... u
