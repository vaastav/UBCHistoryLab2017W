ALLEGED REFLECTION ON BOTH
HOUSES MAY GO HOME TO
THE PRESIDENT.
GEN. WORTHINQTON
STRICKEN IN HOUSE
Former Member from Nevada At
tacked by Apoplexy—Appropria
tions Bill Contains Great Amount
—Ways and Means Session.
Washington, Dec. 11. Congress
has scheduled a return to Presi
dent Roosevelt of that part of his an
nual message to congress relating to
the secret service in which the presi
dent reflected, in the opinion of the
leaders of both houses, upon the mem
bers for restricting the use of secret
service operatives to those duties pre
scribed by law. The first time such
action was taken against the national
executive was in the administration of
President Jackson when he castigated
congress for its attitude on the nation
al bank question. President Tyler
was the last president to feel the sting
of such action, in 1842, when he crit
icised congress because of its meth
ods in handling an administration
veto.
Ire of Tawney Up.
This action was agreed to by the
leaders of both houses, but the de
tails were kept secret over night. It
is now proposed that Representative
Tawney of Minnesota, chairman of the
house committee on appropriations,
which recommended a limitation on
the secret service, or some one desig
nated by him, shall request the house
to appoint a select committee to de
termine what action shall be taken.
The action of this select committee
has already been determined upon as
indicated. When the committee re
ports to the house, debate will be pos
sible, although every effort has been
made by the house and senate lead
ers to make the vote of congress unan
imous. If the house accepts the re
port of the committee its resolution
will be sent to the senate to be con
curred in.
Hold Conference with Cannon.
Leaders of the senate and house
were in conference in Speaker Can
non's room Thursday afternoon to con
sider what action shall be taken con
cerning that portion of President
Roosevelt's annual message which re
lates to the secret service. Among
those present were Senators Hale and
Aldrich, Speaker Cannon and Repre
sentatives Tawney and Perkins. The
Congressman Tawney.
last named has prepared a resolution
providing for the appointment of a se
lect committee of the house to con
sider that part of the president's mes
sage regarded as offensive to members
of congress. The question of expung
ing from the Congressional Record all
of the alleged offensive matter has
been suggested.
Gen. Worthington Stricken.
Gen. Henry G. Worthington, a for
mer member of congress from Nevada,
the only living pall-bearer at the fu
neral of Abraham Lincoln, was strick
en with apoplexy on the floor of the
house Thursday afternoon. He was
conveyed to a cloak-room in a critical
condition.
Because of his four-score years Gen.
Worthington's friends view his illness
with alarm. He fell heavily to the
floor in tho center aisle and members
at once went to his assistance. Rep
resentative Burton of Delaware, who
is a physician, pronounced the case
apoplexy and gave the stricken man
medical attention. Later he was ta
ken to his home in this city.
Gen. Worthington at one time also
was minister to Uruguay and the Ar
gentine Republic.
Appropriation Bill Reported.
The legislative, executive and ju
dicial appropriation bill was reported
to the house Thursday from the com
mittee on appropriations by Repre
sentative Bingham, of Pennsylvania.
It carries $31,667,820, which is $816,259
less than the estimates asked for and
$34,876 more than appropriated in the
legislative bill for the current fiscal
year.
Salaries specifically provided for in
this bill will number 14,441, or 186 less
than estimated for. Chairman Taw
ney, of the committee, gave notice
that he would call the measure up
Friday, immediately after the reading
of the journal.

Gov. Johnson Announces Some Ap
pointments He Will Make—Vis
it Prevented By Death.
Campaign Funds.
Minneapolis.—L. S. Swenson, treas
urer of the republican state central
committee, has filed with the auditor
of Hennepin county a financial state
ment showing that the campaign re
ceipts and expenditures of the com
mittee were $22,314.49, and that the
committee is in debt to the extent of
$1,504.66. The statement is brief,
and lawyers say that Mr. Swenson
and the treasurers of the different
campaign committees in Hennepin
countj who have filed statements
with the county auditor have failed
to obey the provisions of the state
law and are liable to prosecution for
misdemeanor.
The state law provides, in section
258 of the code, that the treasurer
of a political committee shall prepare
and file with the auditor of the
county in which he resides "a true
and detailed statement, subscribed
and verified by him, setting forth
each and every sum of money by
him received or disbursed for such
purposes, the date of each receipt and
disbursement, the name of the per
son from whom received or to whom
paid, and the purposes of each. Such
statement shall also contain a detail
ed list of the unpaid debts, if any,
of such committee, with the nature
and amount of each, and to whom
owing and, if there are no such
debts, the statement shall so allege."
The code makes failure to file the
account required by law a misde
meanor.
Plums.
St. Paul.—Gov. Johnson before his
departure for Washington admitted
that the following officeholders were
practically sure of reappointment:
Frank A. Day, private secretary.
Harvey Grimmer, executive clerk.
John E. King, state librarian.

custodian.
Fred B. Wood, adjutant general.
Geoige S. Wood, assistant adjutant

vacated by him will be filled by E. J.
Lynch. These two appointments
have aheadj been announced.
Ore Shipments.
Duluth.—The News-Tribune's com
pilation of iron ore shipments for
190S from the Lake Superior region
gives the tonnage at 25,420,752. This
is complete with the exception of two
or thiee cargoes which will leave Es
canaba, Mich., tomorrow or Monday.
The Mesaba range in northern Min
nesota produced the bulk of the ore,
its output being 17,231,804 tons. Ship
ments from ports were as follows:
Duluth, 8,808,000 Two Harbors, 5,
702,237 Superior, Wis., 3,563,111 Es
canaba, Mich., 3,346,149 Ashland,
Wis., 2,513,670 Marquette, Mich., 1,
487,485.
Last season the iron ore produc
tion of the Lake Superior region was
42,245,070 tons. Indications are that
last year's record-breaking tonnage
will be equalled or beaten by the out
put of next season.
Fifty Families Needy.
Duluth.—Mayor W. A. Haven of
this $ity, chairman of the relief com
mittee appointed by Gov. Johnson to
succor the unfortunates in this sec
tion who suffered by the forest fires
this year, has a list of fifty North
Shore families deserving of assis
tance. At first it was estimated that
not more than fifteen families would
need assistance, but investigation
has increased the original estimate.
Many of the settlers need lumber to
rebuild their houses, and it is plan
ned to hurry the necessary building
material north as soon as possible.
N. J. Miller is making a tour of the
North Shore investigating meritorious
cases, and upon his return, definite
advices as to actual needs of the
fire sufferers will be available.
Miscellaneous Notes.

duties with those of his new position
as president of the Minnesota Mutual

DENMARK.
The Danish minister to Great Bri
tain, M. De Bille, and his American
wife, were given a farewell dinner by
Ambassador and Mrs. Reid. M. De
Bille has been the dean of the diplo
matic corps in London for eighteen
years.
The Alberti scandal gave "The
Grocer," an English newspaper, an
opportunity to deal a blow to the
Danish farmers' co-operative unions.
Alberti, by means of his prominent
position in the farmers' butter ex
port union and the farmers' savings
bank, ruined both, and caused the
loss of millions of dollars to the
Danish farmers. The Grocer points
to this disaster as proof that it is
too unsafe for farmers to meddle with
the export trade and with banking
business. The paper claims that no
matter how circumspect the farm
ers are they cannot control those
branches of trade because they lie
beyond their legitimate sphere of ac
tion. The Danish farmers however,
are not going to lose much sleep over
the warnings of The Grocer. Almost
10,000 farmers and others* have raised
money lor a new savings bank, and
in the worst of times they are out to
make arrangements for selling their
butter in England without the use
of middlemen.
London, Dec. 1.—The United King
dom, together with othpr portions of
the British empire, paid the custom
ar\ tiibute to Queen Alexandra on
the occasion ot her birthday. It was
the queen's sixty-fourth anniversary.
Greetings frQm all parts of the world
were received, flags were displayed
eveiywhere and there were the usual
salutes at the naval and military sta
tions. Queen Alexandra spent the
day at Sandringham, where there
was an unusually large gathering of
the royal family in celebration of the
occasion. Queen Alexandra is in ex
cellent health. Despite her sixty
and-fotir ears and the fact that she
has nine grandchildren, her majesty
still retains her youthful beauty.
King Edward has aged far more
rapidly than has his gracious con
Fort. As the years have rolled on
the queen has kept her figure and
her freshness, her grace of move
ment, her smooth cheek and full,
bright eyes, and at three score and
three drives out with the king, look
ing very much like an eldest daughter
instead of a wife but eighteen months
his junior.
FINLAND.
Finland has no wheat flour mills
of importance, and, relatively speak
ing, not many rye mills. The major
part of the rye flour, which forms
the greater part of the cereal prod
ucts consumed, comes from Russian,
mills, as do most of the supplies of
mill feed. Of the wheat flour im
ported, half in 1906 came from the
United States, and in 1907 there was
a decided increase in our flour ex
ports to Finland. American flour
finds its way there not only by di
rect transactions, which for 1906 were
172.492 barrels, but the importing
houses of Germany, Denmark, Nor
way and Sweden are many of them
directly represented in Finland and
trans-ship large quantities of Ameri
can flour to that country. One rep
resentative of an American mill in
Hclsingfors claims to have imported
over 182,000 sacks from the United
States the last season.

RICH IN RECUPERATIVE POWER.
Forests of Northern Maine That More
Than Held Their Own.
That is the one astounding thing in
this whole region of northern Maine,
the regenerative power of the forest.
Men with axes have been hacking at
the giants of the woods up here for
two centuries and more. The goli
aths have been laid low, indeed, yet
for one tree tnat stood on a given
space along the hillsides and in the
valleys of No. 1 a century ago, five
stand to-day.
They are giants no more, it is true,
but they are splendid trees, and just
as the Liliputians might prevail where
Gulliver was bound, so these trees hold
their own against man and even press
in on his clearisgs and wipe them out.
There must be many more lumbermen
with axes along the Macwahoc, the
Moluncus and the Mattawamkeag be
fore this beautiful region will fail of
its forest.
