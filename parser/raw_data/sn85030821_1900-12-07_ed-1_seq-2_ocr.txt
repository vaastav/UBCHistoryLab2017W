The ratio between gold.nd silver in
Old Testament times was exactlj 13 to
1, the same as it is in Asia to-day. A
silver shekel was worth 61 cents. The
gold shekel was worth 59.00. Divide
and you will find the ratio is as stated.
Congress convened Monday. The
coming session will be an interesting
one and the proceedings will be watch
ed with interest by the people. It is
what is known as the short session
and ends on March 4. There will be
hardly time for any radical measure to
pass, as long debate will deter and the
opposition will block its passage if
possible.
India continues to absorb silver at
a rate which is steadily advancing the
price of silver. In the 12 months end
ing in the middle of September over
60,000,000 ounces of silver , had gone
into circulation or consumption in the
arts in India. This is about one-third
of the world's annual product, which
in recent years has been from 175,000
000 to 1S5,000,000 ounces a year.
The mints of the United States will
be kept red hot for a long time to come
coining silver. Ia the first place there
are the Porto Kican pesos to recoin.
Then, if congress establishes the gold
standard in the Philippines, there will
be millions of Mexican dollars to re
coin. The secretary of the treasury
can at any time purchase silver to coin
small change, 'and can replace worn
subsidiary coin. The price-of silver is
rising steadily, and will continue to
advance.
According to the report of the direc
tor of the mint, to January 1, 1000, the
amounty of money in the United
States is, gold stock -5002,000,000; silver
stock, Su30,000,000; uncovered paper,
31000,000. The per capita of each is
a3 follows: Gold, 512.6.3; silver, 3.10;
paper, ?L20; total, ?25.23. There is no
good reason why there should not be a
large .increase of silver coinage, as the
needs of business require a constantly
increasing amount of silver money,
especially for small change.
McKinley didn't have a word of
sympathy in his message for Jhe Boers
and poor old Paul Kreuger, but he
very calmly tells congress that the
seizure of Amirican 'corgoes, not con
traband of war, by the British on the
coast of Portuguese South Africa was
settled, for and the incident closed by
England paying for the goods. In
other words, in order to help England
starve the Boers, the rights of a neu
tral to exemption from search and
seizure were waived, and h stood pat
and demanded no apology or disavow
ment of the act.
The president's position on the
Chinese question is corect, if he will
only stick to it, but it is to be feared
he won't. He is a Methodist, and the
Methodists believe in backsliding. He
was a free silver man once but be
backslid and is now a devout devotee
cf the golden calf. He expressed him
self very forcibly, that it was our plain
duty to give the Porto Ricans the ben
efit of our markets, but he backslid
and signed the double-acting tariff bill
against them. lie said, to force an un
willing submssion to our authority by
another people would be criminal ag
gression, but he backslid and has been
citing a little of that sort of busi
ness on his own account, but he has
changed the name to "benevolent as
similation." At any rate it is to be
hop-id that Brother McKinley will not
backslide cn the Chinese question.
THE PRESIDENT'S M.KSSAGE.
The president's message is a very
en-thy and prosaic document. It has
LS.0CO words and fills- about nine col-.-.7iS
cf the average daily newspaper.
?ew people will have the patience to
through it. There is not a single
.rikicg line in it and the lack cf point
.'-Teres little opportunity for criticism
ivoratle or adverse. It is perfunctory
.-3 platitudinous. Its tencr is com-:lc-:;a.nt
and reminds one cf a miss
i-rseu. m a gjass.
ji.e trust matter is touched with the
:1t Lsni. His remedy is usiformityj
al law restraining them. He is very
solicitous, however, that, no harm be
done to the beneficial combines. His
consistency is beautiful to contem
pite He would;, net kill, the goose
that lays'the golden egg. How could
he? He. knows where the republican
campaign sinews cf war came from.
The president distinctly endorses
the ship subsidy bill, which is well
known to be a job in the interests cf
wealthy corporations. He refers to the
fact that only nine per cent of Ameri
can exports are carried ia, American
vessels, and, therefore, urges subsidies
to promote the building of a merchant
marine; whereas, if the restrictions of
obnoxious navigation laws were re
moved and the whole field was thrown
open to free competition, our mer
chant marine would soon grow to large
proportions. Everyone knows that
the great railway lines are, as a rule,
in business combination with the great
ocean transportation companies, so
that subsidies to fast ocean transports
would Te equivalent to pouring mil
lions of the people's money into the
coffers of great railway companies. .
After all this the president advises
congress to practice economy and
warns against extravagance in appro
priations. He recommends supple
mental legislation to secure ."parity
of all our monies. He would have gold
leaf put all-over the golden calf. He
makes other sundry recommendations
to congress, which reminds one of the
old lady's advice to her daughter who
wanted to go in swimming:
Mother, may I go out to swim?
Yes, my clearest daughter;
Hans jour clothes oa a hickory limb,
But don't go near the water.
THE TREASURER'S REPORT.
Retiring Greenback ly Paying Oat Gold.
They Are locked Up la the Taalts
of the Treasury Department.
The daily press gives an abstract of
the annual "report of the treasurer
of the United States, submitted to
Secretary Gage for incorporation in
his report to congress. The abstract
is an unsatisfactory one in many re
spects, and therefore it is difficult to
ascertain anything definite from it.
We will, therefore, have to await the
full report beforeit will be possible
to comment upon it. There are, how
ever, some items that can be noted
now. For instance, the treasurer says
that up to October 1, 1000, under the
provisions of the gold standard act,
22,530,S54 iu United States notes were
redeemed in gold out of the reserve
fund of 150,000,000.
Each day the notes so redeemed are
exchanged for gold from the general
fdnd, so the gold was kept intact in
amount and character. Nearly twenty
two million and odd dollars in green
backs are now in the treasury aud are
counted as a part of the cash assets of
the government. Under the provisions
of the law above mentioned, these
notes must remain in the treasury,
unless gojd is presented for them.
Under such circumstances, these notes
are only an asset of the government,
available for use, on the books of the
treasury. They cannot be pot into
general circulation, for it is beyond
the power of the treasurer to do so,
unless he can find some bankers who
will be kind enough to give him gold
for notes. They act precisely like gold
certificates and are still "an endless
chain."
Only one year of declining revenues
will be necessary, if our fund of the
so-called balance in the treasury be
changed into greenbacks, and then, if
there come a demand for gold for ex
port, the gold In the reserve will be
reduced below the 150-million mark
and the secretary of the treasury,
under the provisions of the act, must
issue more bonds. This bond condi
tion is inevitable. It is as certain to
come as night follows day. It would be
in the hands of the banks right at this
moment, if they deemed it advisable,
to drain the treasury of every dollar of
its available assets. They do riot do it
because they do not deem it advisable,
at present. When it is remembered
that there is estimated to be ?336,000
000 in circulation, less the amount
recently redeemed, the danger can ba
understood.
The report of the treasurer also
shows that highwater mark in govern
ment revenues has. been reached. On
June"30, 1000, the cash balance of the
treasury was ?3,CC3,273 greater than at
the end of the.quarter following. The
revenues from internal duties, war
stamp tax, and the tariff, are abnormal,
owing to conditions, as everyone ac
quainted with government finances
knows. When they fall to normal,
either there must be an increase in
taxation or a deficit in the revenues,
in the face of th-ir pledges to reduce
taxation, the republican party leaders
will hardly dare to increase it. It is,
therefore, most probable that before a
year has elapsed the McKinley admin
istration will be face to face with the
problem ot a constantly enlarged defi
ciency in receipts, as compared with
expenditures. Farmers' Advocate.

DenTer News.
Fhilippine Commission Unconstitutional.
In the long section of the message
relating to the Philippines the presi
dent mentions, as though it were an
every day occurrence, that he has ap
pointed a commission, responsible
only to himself, and the acts of which
are subject to review only by himself,
to legislate for the Philippines.
The commission has been legislating
for some time and its proclamation of
new laws are published under the offi
cial form of "by the authority of the
president of the United States." On
this subject congress should have a
great deal to say, because the enact
ment of legislatian by the president is
outside of the constitution, and is im
perialism pure and simple. It is at
the very opposite pole from every
principle embodied in the foundation
of the American government. Rocky

The Canal and Ih- Ilay-I'aunrefoce Treaty.
The president recommends that the
Hay-Pauncefote convention, in regard
to the Nicaraguan canal be ratified.
The convention is objectionable be
cause it deprives the United States of
the right to fortify the canal. It gives-
the distinct advantage tcr the power
with the largest navy, and that power
could seize the canal as easily as it
seized -American non-contraband goods
destined to Lorenzo Marques. Rocky

Trusts Are Here to Slay.
New York, November 20. Charles
R. Flint, in the course of an address
before the Outlook Club at Montclair,
N.,J., referred to trusts as'follows:
"This new 'consolidation' has come
to stay. Let no young man think
otherwise. That fact was settled in our
recent presidentialelection. The 'trust'
is here for good, aud under the new
system in business, increased intelli
gence and mental accumen are demand
ed of the business man. It may,4here
fore, be that a collegiate education
with the mental training it invqjves
will m the future be of greater irjpor
tance than it was in the past to the
business man. In a measure this has
perhaps been already shown."
