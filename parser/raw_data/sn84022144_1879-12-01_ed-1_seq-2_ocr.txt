Life-saving crews assisted off when stranded,

.William Henry Smith, general agent of
the western associated press, had made ar
rangement* for supplying all newspapers
which are patrons of the association with
advance copies of the president's message.
These copies were distributed last Thurs
day, under seal, with strict instructions to
telegraph operators not to break the seals
until permission was given by telegraph,
which permission was to follow the delivery
of the message in congress. Through some
omission the Sioux City Journal and the
Press and Dakotaian did not receive
their quota of the advance copies
sent out, which is all the more aggravating
the way the matter has resulted. Through
some other source the papers of New York,
Cincinnati and Chicago procured possession
of advance copies, and their this morning's
issues contained the message in full. The
following telegrams received by us this
morning from William Henry Smith, ex
plains the affair:
"Chicago, Dec. 1.—The premature publi
cation of the annual message of the mes
sage of the president in New York, Chicago
and Cincinnati, compels delivery to you
without further delay of the copies in the

the president, has been sacredly observed to

consummation of their designs. For the
convenience of the newspaper fraternity
and to assist in placing the annual message
quickly before the people, President Hayes
cauaed a large number of copies to be print

trusted agents, in. advance of its delivery.
He was doubtless the victim of deep cha

Thanksgiving day. The holes for the tele
graph poles are all dug to this point and
the poles are at the end of the track, for
this winter the regular passenger trains will
r.un
by that much favored class, the editors. An I £uKa !*ere.in forenoon and back to
exchange thus explains it: "One of the
greatest charms of an editor's life is his
'beating* it on all occasions. No one who
has.ever tested of the sweets of that bliss
can begin to take in its glory and its happi
ness. He does $100 worth of advertising
for a railroad, gets a 'pass' for a year, rides
*25 worth then he is looked upon as a
dead head, or a half blown dead beat. He
'pufii' a theatre or concert troupe $10 worth
and gets $1.00 in 'complimentaries' and is
thus passed in'free.' If the hall is small he
is begrudged of the room he occupies—for
if his 'complimentaries' were paying tickets
the troupe Would be so much in pocket. He
blows and puffs a church festival free, to
any desired extentr and does the poster

in theit report say they found great difficulty
in obtaining truthful testimony frpni wit
nesses, who, from their own admissions, and
from the circumstances could, if they would,

Washington, Nov. 28.—Inquiry in offi

assurance to the Indians that the report of
the advanoe of troops at Los Pinos agency
is wholly untrue. Secretary Schurz has for
some time suspected that some adverse ele
ment was secretly at work to retard, or if
poesible defeat the reports of the commis
sion and he is strongly, inclined to believe
that the source of the present trouble is
correctly indicsted by .Ouray as being Mor
mon.
