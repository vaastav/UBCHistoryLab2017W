WASHINGTON, Dec. 4-Senators Per

the President to-day to discuss with
him the appointment of a successor to
Xormer Governor Fifer of Illinois on the

would appoint: Franklin K. T^ane of San
Francisco to.- the vacancy created by Fi
fer's resignation, | which will take effect
on January l.next.
Mr. Lane, whose nomination will be
Bent to. the Senate to-morrow, -is a Demo
crat, and his- appointment will change
the political complexion of the. Interstate
Commerce . Commission from Republican
to Democratic. Former Governor Fifer
ef Illinois, -whom. Mr.. Lane" will succeed
on the commission, is a Republican, as
also ere Commissioners Knapp and:
Prouty. Commissioners ' Cockrell ana
Clements are. Democrats. While Mr.
fcane has beer^a Democrat in politics, he
\u25a0was a supporter of .President Roosevelt
In the last campaign. -
In connection. with this appointment, it
is pointed out that. \in the event of the
enactment of railroad rate legislation by
the present Congress," the Interstate Com
merce Commission very likely will be re
organized.* " " ; •. ' '

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.— The . assem
bling to-day of the members of the Fifty-
ninth Congress for their first session was .
marked , by 'no unusual incidents, but it
attracted to the Capitol crowds of spec
tators who took a lively interest in the
proceedings. The day was beautiful. The
sun shone brightly and the air was keen.
Society was out In force and , filled the
reserved galleries, while visitors, unable
to find seats, roamed the corldors to catch
glimpses of public men.
In the Senate the proceedings were
brief.. but most of the spectators seemed
to find aulte as much to interest them in
observing the Senators who remained on
the floor after adjournment as they could
have experienced had the session con
tinued longer. •
„\u25a0 The House was in session more than
three hoars, and while the proceedings
followed the programme* tnat had marked
the opening of Congress for many years,
there was* enough interest to hold an
exceptionally large audience during the
entire, time^ , v " - ~. \u25a0
~ r One" noticeable feature was the absence
of; ; Cowers» * heretofore ..have been
'common to". both '• chambers. On*"openlng '
days the display bad been so great that
the, exhibition alone would have been snf
cierit^to draw great crowds, and the ah
sence.of floral tributes, due to a resolu
tion adopted unanimously by the Senate
and to; an order of the Speaker in the
House, robbed the occasion of much of its
picturesqueness. . , .
-During the session Senators and Repre
sentatives visited the' galleries and
chatted with friends.
Senators Allison and Morgan were ap
pointed by Vice President Fairbanks as a
committee to notify the President that
Congress was ready for any communica
tion he desired to make. The Senate was
,in session only twenty minutes. Senators
Aldrich of Rhode Island. Knoz of Penn
sylvania. Warner of Missouri and Fra
zer of Tennessee took the oath of office,
and an adjournment was taken as a mark
of respect to the late Senator Platt of
Connecticut.
The preliminary steps to organization
were taken by the House. Joseph G.
Cannon of Illinois was re-elected Speaker;
the members of the House took the oath
of office; the officers and floor employes
of the body were re-elected; the rules of
the last : Congress were adopted, art!
members went through the formality of
drawing for seats, all of which was en
livened by the presence of the crowds in
the galleries, the animation of the reunion
of. veteran members and interest in new
ones.
•In a brief speech against the adoption
of the rules the minority leader. Williams
of Mississippi, touched on the interest of
the country in tariff legislation, and told
of. the new Republican "ideas", which
were belrrg **wafted to Washington on
breezes from every part of the country."
These, he said, might be properly legis
lated should the "minority of . the major
ity"- stand with the Democratic members
in opposing the adoption of J the old rules
and forming new ones which would per
mit consideration : of such legislation as
popular opinion might dictate.
. A committee lwas appointed to act with
the Senate committee in notifying Presi
dent . Roosevelt that Congress ; was ready
to transact business; the rules 'committee
and the \ Committee on Mileage were ap
pointed, and the House adjourned after a
session which lasted • three and a halt
hours, in "compliance with resolutions an
nouncing.'the death of .Senator' Platt of
Connecticut and Representative Marsh of
Illinois. WmOStSBS^SaBBKBOSB

WASHINGTON. Dec. t— For '. an * hoar
preceding; the opening of the Fifty-ninth
Congress there 'were scenes of increasing
animation on the floor and in the galleries
of '^he House of Representatives. Legis
lative "veterans exchanged cordial greet
ings and newly elected members made ac
quaintances. As early as 10. o'clock -the
galleries began to fill- Admission was by
card only and the many who camo to
the^aDltoljUnprovided. thronged the cor
ridors in vain efforts to gain entrance. /
•Major "Alexanders McDowell, clerk of
the House/ called that body to order. De
claring the "House' "in order."" he an
nounced" a prayer by the chaplain, Rsv.
Dr. * Henry M. Couden. A rollcall by
States to show. the. presence of a n'uorum
was at once \ begun. A large number of
members : were present, every seat on ; th«
Rpublican side of the hall being. occupied,
with but a fewA-acant seats on the Dem-'
ocratic side. Several of the newly. electetl
members ;who could not "Qnd s a' seat lon
the Republican side contented . themselves
with I standing in \u25a0 the; rear of 4 the : hall .on

aisle 'and sat with their Democratic ; col
leagues." pending the dniwins for . perma
