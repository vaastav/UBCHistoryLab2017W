O. TINAS, PUULISBKR.
KIMBALL, SOUTH DAKOTA
One of the foremost players has suf
fered & peculiar effcct from his recent
severe Illness. Richard Mansfield, who
Is still at Lakewood, N. J., recuperat
ing from his severe attack of typhoid
fever, Is now virtually well again. He
has just made a startling discovery,
however. St Is that he has forgotten the
lines of all Mie plays In his repertory.
In every other 'respect Mr. Mansfield
feels remarkably alert merotally, but it
Is peculiar result of Ills recent Illness
that the leading roles In "Beau Drum
med," "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." "A
Parisian Romance" and other pieces In
•Which he has been seen hundreds of
tlmea are now quite strange to him.
He has, therefore, set to work to study
diligently his various Impersonations,
•ml will have to come to New York
shortly to rehearse with his company
preparatory to opening his season flit
the Chestnut Street Opera house, Phil
adelphia, on November 25.
Fanny Davenport Is now negotiating
tor the purchase of a site in Westches
ter oounty, or on Long Tsland, near
New York city, on which she proposes
to erect a building to be called the
"Davenport •house." The home Is In
tended to furnish to venern.ble mem
bers of the dramatic profession a place
In which to ies.de when old a?e has in
capacitated them for further active
work on the stage, In addition to being
a place where retired actors and act
resses can receive good apartments and
first class care. It will include a school
for the children of oirtlsts who desire
to adopt the profession of their par
ents, but are without the means to ed
ucate 'themselves properly for this ob
ject. Unknown authors may submit
plavs In nanuscrlp»t, which will be read
by a. committee, and 4f they are thought
worthy they will be presented, cast by
the Inmates of the ihome and the pu
pils.
A Boston dentist has ihi't upon a novel
way of collecting a bill for services.
After reminding his debtor of the an
tiquity of the account and in the regu
lation manirer he finally wrote a letter
In these words: "I don't intend to ask
you again for the sum you owe me but
there Is one thing I want to tell you
•very time you cut oft a piece of steak
•and pass it to your wife I want you to
remember she Is not cfhewing that beef
with your iteeth nor hers, but with
mine." The pungency of these words
(hiad the desired effect and a check was
the result. Tihe husband was obliged
to suocumb to the mastication of those
doubly false teeith.
All the world that Inhabits a certain
New Jersey town is talking Just now ol
the following Incident: A spinster aged
62. recently announced her engagement
of marriage to a man aged 60. The
k^Aeplnster owns, among other goods and
chattels, a handsome country residence
Hpjjtseveral miles from the New Jersey town.
,.i Some time since she invited her intend
ed spouse to pay an afternoon visit with
her at this residence. She was, however,
anxious not to shock the proprieties In
any way. She therefore Insisted thai

'"W -thls object a widow, aged 30, was per-
Kuaded to accompany the pair. There if
-nothing like a due regard for Mrs. Grun

New York's British colony has lo

there "by the presence of the Camer

Vi-^of Britain. There they keep up their

.f" .-English country life. They have theii
^dogs, their horses, their billiard rooms
,-iand entertain in the lavish good old
English style. On their sideboards ar«
^always decanters of wine and whisky
they give their visitors the choice o8
cig-ars or pipes. They ride with the
hounds, sail their yachts, play cricket,

Senator Edmunds was once standing
'-with a visiting: English statesman on
the high steps at the west side of the
capltoi looking down Pennsylvania ave

The stranger had seen much to interest
and amuse him in Washington. "You
?-have a wonderful country and a won*
rderful people here, Mr. Senator. Noth*
ring can be impossible with such go
ahead inhabitants." "Oh, yes," said the
senator, "some things are impossible
v*hore. It is impossible to march a brass
band down that avenue and have a
crowd of colored people go In the oppo-
Bite direction at the same time."
'.if. A New York lawyer explaining his
rapid Increase in wealth, said It was due
yto the tomfoolery of other people. "Foi
'example, a client of mine had a race*

the sound. The racehorse went wrong
and the other man brought suit to re*
cover damages. This made my client
*.mad and he brought suit for misrepre*
oBentation of property. The opposing
lawyer was a friend of mine. We had
two suits and we fought them tooth and

have the island in the sound."

SIOUX FALLS BISHOP.
I^ev. Father O'Govman, Professor ol
Church History la IVnshinffton,
Iiikely to Re Appointed Tod Ay.
Stoux Palls, S. D., Dec. 2.—There Is
hardly any question that the name ofl
the new Catholic bishop of the Slou*}
Falls diocese will be announced today,
and that his name will be Rev. Father
O Gorman. Father O'Oorman former-,
ly lived In St. Paul, but is now profes
sor of church history in the Washing
ton, D. C., university. This report is
based on a remark made by Archbishop
Ireland to the effect that the next bish
op of Sioux Fails would sign hin name
"Thomas." Father Thomas O Gorman
has been frequently mentioned as the
successor of Bishop Marty, who waa
transferred from here to St. Cloud,
Minn., last spring. Since the transfer
of Bishop Marty the diocese has been
presided over by Kev. Father Mensing
of Webster. There has been for sev
eral years more or less trouble In the
Sioux Falls diocese, and it has been
said that Bishop Marty inability to
cope wjth the disturbing elements was
the reason of his being transferred to a
quieter diocese.
German-American in Jail in Germany
Huron, S. D.. Dec. 2.—Rome six weeks
ago a German named Carl Keinke, liv
ing on a farm of this countv. left his
home without telling his iamily where
he was gMn^-. Some time after his de»
parture It was learned that he had pur
chased a t'eket and sailed for his old
hon.-e in Germany, sent word to his fam*
ily that he would never return. A few
days ago his wife received a letter from
him advising her that he had forgotten
to get his passport before sailing and
desired her to procure the document
for him at once and forward It as he if
In Jail on the other side of the ocean
and must remain there until the arrival
of the passport. When Reinke de
parted he took all the savings of him
self and family and left them almost
pennyless. In view of this fact and foi
the reason that the document he so
much desires costs 5, Mrs. Reinke is
not disposed to exercise any undue
haste in complying with her eccentric
husband's request.
Ghost Dunccs.
Huron, S. D., Dec. 2.—George A. Fes
senden and party, who have been exam
ining government moneys In the vicin
ity of Pine Ridge, Rosebud and Lower
Brule Indian agencies, have returned
for the winter. Mr. Fessenden says
there is not a very general disposition
on the part of the Indians to take up
and Improve land, although very many
have been quite successful at forming.
In the late summer there was an at
tempt mode to revive the ghost and
other dances but the authorities inter
fered before they were far under way.
The Indians at the points visited are
pretty well fixed for winter.
Took the Poor Debtor's Oath.
Sioux Falls, S. D., Dec. 2.—Paul Bres
nahan took the poor debtor's oath Sat
urday and was released from the peni
tentiary here, having served a year for
trying to stop a train in order to get a
ride. He was one of the North Dakota
Coxeyites and was sentenced under the
federal statutes.
Parker Telephone Line.
Sioux Falls, S. D., Dec. 2.—The busi
ness men of Parker are just now much
Interested in the construction of a tel
ephone line from that place to Sioux
City by way of Centerville. They are
sure that enough business can be guar
anteed to make the line pay from the.
stai't and feel certain that it will be con.
structed at an early day.
PABST IN DAKOTA.
The Bmvnr's Son Will Got a Divorce
Prom Margaret
Milwaukee, Wis., Dec. 2.—Colonel
Gustav Pabst will bring suit for divorce
against his wife in a Dakota court.
Mrs. Margaret Mather Pabst left for
New York Saturday. In announcement
of the fact the name of Pabst is left off,
and she Is again known as simple Mar
garet Mather. Her departure at this
time has given rise to a rumor to the ef
fect that terms of settlement between
herself and husband have been agreed
to, and that she has gone to take up
her residence in the east. Colonel Gus
tav Pabst, her husband, has not been
here since a few days after the horse
whipping escapade. He got leave of
absence from his duties as quartermas
ter of the Fourth regiment of the Wis

months. It was given out he had gone
west. Since then it has been learned
he has gone to South Dakota, where he
will remain until he secures a legal res
idence, when it Is his Intention to bring
suit. This will dispense with the scan
dal which might attend bringing the
suit in a local court. It is understood
also Mrs. Pabst will not fight the case
If her demands for adequate alimony
are granted.

REVELATION IN A DREAM.
A Mexican Ghost. Locatcs Its Skele*
ton—"Was Murdered.
Mexico City, Dec. 2.—The authorities
of Jaiapa, capital of the state of Vera
Cruz, have been notified of an alleged
revelation In a dream to Senora Emllli
ana Mendoza. She says she has been
troubled recently with strange dreams,
in which her mother, who disappeared
mysteriously about twenty years ago,
appeared and informed her that she and
her babe were murdered by her hus«
band, who also disappeared, and that
their skeletons would be found undet
the floor of the house in which Senora
Mendoza lived. The authorities have
searched the city records for the entry
of the death of the mother or infant, bul
no trace was found. Excavations were
then made under the house, resulting In
the finding of human bones—one set
those of an adult and the other those oi
an infant.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Devoted to Foreign Relations and
the Financial Problem, mm
Money Question Given Unusual
.' Prominence. ~.:-L
Retirement of the Greenbacks Is
a Necessity.
Onr Foreign Relations Present No
Serious Aspoct in Any Quartor
—No Hint of Cuban Bel

Mention
Washington, Dec. 3.—The president's
annual message was presented to con
gress today. It is devoted almost en
tirely to foreign relations and the finan
cial question, the latter predominating.
Th«s President's Message.
To the Congress of the United Stales:
The present assemblage of the leg
islative branch ol our government oc
curs at a tune when the interests of our
people and ihe needs
OL
ihe country
give especial prominence to the condi
tion of our foreign relations and the ex
igencies of our national finances. The
reports of the government officials fully
and plainly exhibit what has been ac
complished within the scope of their re
spective duties and present such recom
mendations for the betterment of our
country's condition as patriotic and In
telligent labor and observation suggest.
I therefore deem my executive duty
adequately performed at this time by
presenting to congress the important
phases of our situation as related to our
intercourse with foreign nations and a
statement of the financial problems
which confront us, omitting, except as
they are related to these topics, any
reference to departmental operations.
I earnestly invite, however, not only the
careful consideration, but the severely
critical scrutiny jof congress and my
fellow countrymen to the reports con
cerning these departmental operations.
If justly and fairly examined they will
furnish proof of assiduous and pains
taking care for the public welfare. I
press the recommendations they con
tain upon the respectful attention of
those charged with the duty of legisla
tion, because I believe their adoption
would promote the people's good.
Foreign Relations.
The first part of the message Is given
exclusively to foreign relations. There
are no se-Ious complications. Payn-en»
of the Dehrlng tea claim to great Brit
ain, $425,'iV) is urged. Assurances of
protection of Americans In Turkey have
been received from the sultan. Turkish
soldiers are furnished as guards to the
coast. No Americans have lost their
lives, but considerable missionary prop
erty has been destroyed.
Concerning Cuba, the message is ex
tremely conservative. No hint of grant
ing belllgerant rights to the revolution
ists is given. The president says:
"Whatever may be the traditional
sympathy of our countrymen as indi
viduals with a people who seem to be
struggling for larger autonomy and
greater freedom, deepened as such sym
pathy naturally must be in behalf of
our neighbors, yet the plain duty of
this gc jrnment is to observe in good
faith the recognized obligations of
international relationship."
FINANCIAL SITUATION.
Review of the Money Problem—Re
tirement of OreenbaokN.
The president reviews the financial
situation at great length and recom
mends as vital the retirement of the
greenbacks. Referring to the bond is
sue, the president recites its history
and says in part:
I have never had the slightest mis
giving concerning the wisdom or pro
priety of this arrangement and am quite
willing to answer for my full share of
responsibility for its promotion. I be
lieve it averted a disaster, the immi
nence of which was fortunately not at
the time generally understood by our
people. Though the contract mentioned
stayed for a time the tide of gold with
drawals, Its good results could not be
permanent. Recent withdrawals have
reduced the reserve from $107,571,320 on
the 8th day of July. 1890, to $79,333,960.
How long it will remain large, enough to
render Its Increase unnecessary Is only
matter of conjecture, though quite
large withdrawals for shipment In the
immediate future are predicted In well
informed quarters. About $16,000,000
has beerf withdrawn during the month
of November.
The foregoing events and conditions de
velop the fact that after increasing our
Interest bearing bonded indebtedness
more than $102,000,000 to save our gold re
serve we are nearly where we started,
having now in such reserve $79,333,966 as
against $05,438,377 in February, 1894, when
the first bonds were issued. Though the
amount of gold drawn from the treasury
appears to be very large, as gathered from
the facts and figures herein presented, it
actually was much larger, considerable
sums having been acquired by the treas
ury within the several periods stated
without the issue of bonds.
On the 28th of January, 1895, it was re
ported by the secretary of the treasury
that more than $172,000,000 of gold had
been withdrawn for hoarding or shipping
during the year preceding. He now re
ports from January 1, 1879, to July 14, 1890,
a period of more than eleven years, only a
little over $28,000,000. was withdrawn and
that between July 14, 1890, the date of the
passage of the law for an Increased pur
chase of silver, and the 1st of December,
1895, or within less than five and a half
years, there was withdrawn nearly $375,
000,000, making a total of more than |4udv
000,000 drawn from the treasury in gold
since January 1, 1879, the date fixed in 1S75
for the retirement of the United States
notes. Nearly $327,000,000 of the gold thus
withdrawn has been paid out on these
United States notes and yet every one of
the $340,000,000 is still uncancelled and
ready to do service in future gold deple
tions. More than $76,000,000 In gold has,
since their creation in 1890, been paid out
from the treasury upon notes given on
the purchase of silver by the government
and yet the whole, amounting to $li3,
000,000, except a little more than $10,000,000
which has been retired by exchange for
sllvcr at the request of the hokTers, re
mains outstanding and prepared to Join
their older and more experienced allies in
future raids upon the treasury's gold re
serve.
In other words, the government har. paid
In gold more than nine tenths of its United
6tates notes and still owes them all. It
has paid In gold al.'Ut one half of its
notes given for silver purchases without
rxtingulshlng by such payment one dol
lar of these notes.
Retirement of Greenbacks.
When added to all this we are reminded
that to carry on this astounding financial
scheme the government has incurred a
bonded Indebtedness of $95.BOO.OOO in es
tablishing a gold reserve, and of $ltu.,
816,400 In efforts to maintain it, that th
annual interest charges on such bondo»
indebtedness is more than $11,000,000 tha
a continuance of our present course ma,
result In further bond Issues, and that
have suffered or aro- Ihreatened with a:
this for thesftke of supplying gold for foi
elgm shipment or facilitating its hoardii
at honpe, a situation is exhibited whlc^
cartaiaUir ought te arrest attention anu
A
provoke immediate legislative relief. I
am convinced the only thorough and prac
tical remedy for our trouble is found in
the retirement and cancellation of our
United States notes, commonly called
greenbacks, and the outstanding treasury
notes Issued by the government in pay
ment of silver purchases under the act of
1800. I behove this could readily be ac
complished by the exchange of theue notes
foi Imited States bonds of small as well
us large denominations bearing a low rate
of interest. They should be long term
bonds, thus increasing their desirability
as investments and because their payment
could he well postponed to a period far
removed from present financial burdens
and perplexities when with increased
prosperity and resources they could be
moie easily met. lo injure the cancella
tion of these notes and also provide a way
by which gold'may be added to our cur
rency in lieu of them a feature In the
plans should bo an authority given lo the
secretary ol the treasury to dispose of the
bonds abroad for gold if ncccssarv to com
plete the contemplated redemption and
cancellation, permitting him to use the
proceeds of such bonds to take up and
canct-1 any of the notes that may be in
the treasury or thut may be received by
the government on any account. The in
crease of our bonded debt Involved in this
plan would bo amply compensated by re
newed activity and enterprise in all busi
ness circles. The restored confidence at
home, the reinstated faith in our mone
tary strength abroad and the stimuiauun
of every interest and Industry would fol
low the cancellation of the gold demand
obligations now atthcting us.
In any event the bonds proposed would
stand for the extinguishment of a trouble
some indebtedness, while in the path we
now tollow there lurks the menace of un
ending bonds with our indebtedness still
undischarged and aggravated in every
feature. The obligations necessary to
fund this indebtedness would not equal in
amount those from which we have been
relieved since lfcili by anticipation and pay
ment, but the requirements of a sinking
fund out of our surplus revenues. The
currency withdrawn by the retirement of
the United States notes and treasury
notes amounting to probably less than
$1W,000,000 might be supplied by such gold
as would be used on their retirement or
by an increase in the circulation of our
national banks. Though the aggregate
capital of these now in existence amounts
to more than $6ti!,(KRi,000. their outstanding
circulation based on bond security
amounts to only about 100,000,000. They
are authorized to issue notes amounting
to 90 per cent of the bonds deposited to
secure their circulation, but in no event
beyond the amount oi' their capital stock,
and they are obliged to pay 1 per cent
tax on the circulation they issue.
1 think they ahould be allowed to issue
circulation equal to the par value of the
bonds they deposit to secure it and that
the tax on their circulation should be
reduced to one fourth of 1 per cent,
which would undoubtedly meet all the
expense the government Incurs on I heir
account. In addition they should be al
lowed to substitute or deposit in lieu of
the bonds now required as security for
their circulation their notes which
would be issued for the purpose of retir
ing the United States notes and treasury
notes. The banks, already existing, if
they desired to avail themselves of the
provisions of the law thus modified
could issue circulation in addition to
that already outstanding, amounting to
?'17S,000,0Q0, which would nearly or quite
equal the currency proposed to be can
celled. At any rate. 1 should confidently
expect to see the existing national banks
or others to be organized, avail them
selves of the proposed encouragements
to issue circulation and promptly fill any
vacuum and supply every currency.
It has always seemed to me that the
provisions of law regarding the capital
of national banks which operate as a
limitation to their location fall to make
proper compensation for the suppression
of state banks, which came near to the
people in all sections of the country and
readily furnished them with banking
accommodations and facilities. Any in
convenience or embarrasment arising
from these restrictions on the location of
national banks might well be remedied
by better adapting the present system
tem to the creation of banks in smaller
communities or by permitting banks of
large capital to establish branches in
such localities as would serve the people,
so regulated and restrained as to secure
their safe and conservative control a^d
management. But there might not be
the necessity for such an addition to the
currency by now issues of bank circu
lation as at first glunec is Indicated. If
we should be relieved from retaining a
gold reserve under conditions that con
strue it the barometer of our solvency,
and If our treasury should no longer be
the foolish purveyor of gold for nations
abroad or for speculation and hoarding
by our citizens at home, I should expect
to see gold resume its natural and nor
mal functions in the business affairs of
the country and cease to be an object of
fear to the timid of our people.
Revenue Receipts No Help.
In the present stage of our difficulty
it is not easy to understand how the
amount of our revenue receipts directly
affects It. The important question is
not the amount of money received in
revenue payments but the kind of mony
we maintain and our ability to continue
in sound financial condition. We are
considering the government's holdings
of gold as relating to the soundness of
our money and as affecting our nation
al credit and monetary strength. IT
our gold reserve had never been im
paired or if no bonds had ever been is
sued to replenish It. if there had been no
fear ana timidity concerning our ability
to continue gold payment, if any part
of our revenues were not paid in gold,
and If we could look to our gold receipts
as a means of retaining a safe reserve
the amount of our revenues would be an
Influential factor In the problem, but
unfortunately all the circumstances that
might lend weight to these considera
tions are entirely lacking. In our pres
ent nredicament no gold is received by
the government in payment of revenue
charges, nor would there be if the rev
enues were increased. The receipts of
the treasury, when not In silver certifi
cates, consist of United States notes
and treasury notes issued for silver pur
chases. These forms of money
are only useful to the govern
ment In paying Its current or
dinary expenses and its quantity
in government possession does not in
the least contribute toward giving us
that kind of safe financial standing or
condition which Is built on gold alone.
If it is said that these notes if held by
the government can be used to obtain
gold for our reserve, the answer Is easy.
The people draw gold from the treasury
on demand upon United States notes
and treasury notes, but the proposition
that the treasury can on demand draw
gold from the people upon theru would
be regarded in these day* with won
der and amusement. And even if this
could be done, there is nothing to pre
vent those thus parting with their gold
from regaining It the next day or the
ne: hour by the presentation of the
notes they received In exchange for it.
The secretary of the treasury might
use such note taken from a surplus rev
enue to buy gold In the market. Of
course he could not do this without pay
ing? a premium. Private holders of gold,
unlike the government, having no par
ity to maintain, would not be restrained
from making the best bargain possible
when they furnished gold to the treas
ury, but the moment the secretary of
the treasury bought gold on any terms
above par he would establish a general
and universal premium upon it, thus
breaking down the parity between gold
and silver which the government is
pledged to aintalr and opening the
way to new and serious complications.
An Absurd Spectacle.
In the meantime the premium would
ot remain stationary and the absurd
pectade might be presented of a deal
selling gold to the government and
villi United States notes or treasury
lotes In his hand Immediately clamor
'ng for Its return and a resale at a
dgher premium. It may be claimed
'.hat a large revenue and redundant re
ceipts might favorably affect the situ
tlon under discussion by affording an
pportunity of retaining these notes in
-.he treasury when received and thus
preventing their presentation for gold.
Such retention to be useful ought to be
at least measurably permanent and this
is precisely what is prohibited, so far
as United tSates notes are concerned,
by the law of 1878, forbidding their fur
ther retirement. That statute in so
many words provides that these notes
when received into the treasury, and
belonging to the United States, shall be
"paid out again and kept in circula
tion." It will moreover be readily seen
that the government could not refuse
to pay out United States notes and
treasury notes in current transactions
when demanded and insist on paying
out silver alone and still maintain tht
parity between that metal and the cur
rency representing gold. Resides, the
accumulation In the treasury of cur
rency of any kind exacted from the peo
ple through taxation is lustlv regarded
as an evil, and it cannot proceed far
without vigorous protest against an un
justifiable detention of money from the
business of the country and a denunci
ation of a scheme of taxation which
proves Itself to be unjust, when It takes
from the earnings and income of the
citizen money so much in excess of the
needs of the government support that
large sums can be gathered and Kent
In the treasury. Such a condition nas
heretofore in times of surplus revenue
led the government to restore currency
to the people by the purchase of its
unmatured bonds at a large premium
and by a large increase of Its deposits
in national banks and we easily re
member that the abuse of treasury ac
cumulation has furnished a most per
suasive argument in favor of legisla
tion radically reducing our tariff.
Perhaps it is supposed that sufficient
revenue receipts would In a sentimental
way improve the situation by inspiring
confidence in our solvency and allaying
the fear of pecuniary exhaustion, and
yet through all our struggles to main
tain our gold reserve there never has
been any apprehension as to our ready
ability to pay our way with such money
as we had and the question whether or
not our current receipts met our current
expenses has not entered into the esti
mate of our solvency. Of course t*ie
general state of our funds exclusive of
gold was entirely immaterial to the for
eign creditor and investor. His interest
could only be paid In gold and his only
concern was our ability to keep on hand
that kind of money.
On July l, 1893, more than a year and
a half before the first bonds were Is
sued to replenish the gold reserve, there
was a net balance In the treasury ex
clusive of such reserve of less than
$13, 000,000 but the goid reserve amount
ed to more than $114,000,000, which was
the quieting feature of the situation. It
was when the stock of gold began rap
idly to fall that fright supervened and
our securities held abroad were re
turned for sale, and debts owed abroad
were pressed for payment. In the mean
time extensive shipments of gold and
other unfavorable Indications caused
restlessness and fright among our peo
ple at home. Thereupon the general
state of our funds exclusive of gold be
came also immaterial to them and they,
loo. drew gold from the treasury for
hoarding against all contingencies.
This is plainly shown by the large in
crease in the proportion of gold with
drawn which was retained by our own
people as time and threatening inci
dents progressed. During the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1S94, nearly $85,
000,000 In gold was withdrawn from the
treasury and about $77,000,000 was sent
abroad, while during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1895, over $117,000,000
was drawn out, of which only about
$60,000,000 was shipped, leaving the large
balance of such withdrawals to be ac
counted for by domestic hoarding.
Refers to l-'reo Silver.
Wlille 1 have endeavored to make a plain
statement of the disturbed condition of
our currency and the present dangers
menacing our prosperity and to suggest a
way which leads to a safer financial sys
tem, I have constantly had In mind the
fact that many of my countrymen whose
sincerity I do not doubt insist that the
cure for the ills now threatening us may
be found in the single and simple remedy
of the free coinage of silver. They con
tend that our mints will be at once thrown
open to the free, unlimited and independ
ent coinage of both gold and silver dol
lars of full legal tender quality, regardless
of the action of any other government,
and in full view of the fact that the ratio
between the metals which they suggest
calls for 100 cents worth of gold in the
gold dollar at the present standard and
only 50 cents in intrinsic value worth of
silver in the silver dollar. Were there in
finitely stronger reasons than can be ad
duced for hoping that such action would
secure for us a bimetallic currency mov
ing on lines of parity, an experiment so
novel and hazardous as that proposed
might well stagger those who believe that
stability is an imperative condition of
sound money. No government, no human
contrivance or act of legislation has ever
been able to hold the two metals togeth
er in free coinage at a ratio appreciably
different from that which is established
in the markets of the world.
Those who believe that our independent
free coinage of silver at an artificial ratio
with gold at 16 to 1, would restore the
parity between the metals, and conse
quently between the coins, oppose an un
supported ami improbable theory to the
general belief and practice of other na
tions and to the teaching of the wisest
statesmen and economists of the world,
both in the past and present and, what is
far more conclusive, they run counter to
our own actual experiences. Twice in our
earlier history our lawmakers attempted
to establish a bimetallic currency by free
coinage upon a ration which varied from
the actual relative values of the two met
als not more than 3 per cent. In both
cases, notwithstanding greater difficul
ties and cost of transportation than now
exist, the coin whose intrinsic worth was
undervalued in the ratio, gradually and
surely disappeared from our circulation
and went to other countries where its
real value was better ecognized. Acts of
congress were impotent to create equal
ity where natural causes decreed even a
slight inequality. Twice in our recent his
tory we have signally failed to raise by
legislation the value of silver. Under an
act of congress passed in 1S7S the govern
ment was required for more than twelve
years to expend annually at
least $24,000,000 in the pur
chase of silver bullion for coiuage.
The Act of 1890.
The act of July 14, 1890, in a still bolder
effort. Increased the amount of silver the
government was compelled to purchase
and forced It to become the buyer an
nually of 54,000,000 ounces, or prac
tically the entire product of our mines.
Under both laws silver rapidly and
steadily declined in value. The proph
ecy and the expressed hope and expec
tation of those In congress who led in
the passage of the last mentioned act
that it would re-establish and maintain
the former parity between the two met
als are still fresh In our memory.
In the light of those experiences
which accord with the experiences of
other nations there is certainly no se
cure ground for the belief than an act
of congress could now bridge an in
equality of 50 per cent between gold and
silver at our present ratio, nor is there
the least possibility that our country,
which has less than one seventh of the
silver money in the world, could by its
action alone raise not only our own but
all silver to its lost ratio with gold.
Our attempt to accomplish this by the
free coinage of silver at a ratio differing
widely from actual relative values
would be the signal for the complete de
parture of gold from our circulation,
the immediate and large contraction of
our circulating medium and a shrink
ago in the real value and monetary effi
ciency of all other forms of currency as
they settled to the level of silver mono
metallism. Everyone who receives a
fixed salary and every worker for wages
would find the dollar in his hand ruth
lessly scaled down to a point of bitter
disappointment if not to pinching pri
vation. A change in our standard to
sliver monometallism would also bring
a collapse of the entire system of
"redit which, when based on a standard
vhlch is recognized and adopted by the
vorld of business. Is many times more
otent and useful than the entire vol
ume of currency and is safely capable
almost indefinite expansion to meet
he growth of trade and enterprise.
In a self invited struggle through
darkness and uncertainty our humilia­
vvfefe
tion would be Increased by the con
sciousness that we had parted compan
with all the enlightened and progres
*Ive nations of the world and were des
perately and hopelessly striving to meet
the stress of modern commerce ano
competition with a debased and unsuit
able currency and in association with
the weak and laggard nations whlcl
have sliver as one of their standards ot
value. All history warns us against
rash experiments which threaten
changes in our monetary standard and
the degredatlon of our currency.
Conlidence in the People,
The past is full of lessons teaching
not only the economic dangers but the
national immorality that follows In tin
train of such experiments. I will noi
believe that the American people car
be persuaded after sober deliberation to
jeopardize their nation prestige ano
pioud standing by encouraging finan
cial nostrums nor that they will yield
#o
the false allurement of cheap mon^v
when they realize that it must, result In
the weakening of that financial integ
tity and rectitude which thus far in our
history has been so devotedly cherished
as one of the traits of true American
ism.
Our country indebtedness, whether
owing by the government or existing
between individuals, has been con
tacted with reference to our present
standard, to decree by act of congress
that these debts shall be payable In
less aluable dollars than those within
the contemplation and intention ot the
paities when contracted would operate
to transfer by the fiat of law and with
out compensation an amount of prop
el ty and a volume of rights anil inter
ests almost incalculable. Those who ad.
vocate a blind and headlong plunge into
free coinage in the name of bimetallism,
professing the belief, contrary to all
experience, that we could thus establish
a double standard and a concurrent cir
culation of both metals in our coinage,
are certainly reckoning from a cloudy
standpoint. Our present standard of
value Is the standard of the world and
permits the only bimetallism now possi
ble, or that is within the independent
reach of any single nation however
powerful that nation may be.
While the value of gold as a standard
Is steadied by almost universal commer
cial and business use It does not despise
silver nor seek its banishment. Where
ever this standard is maintained there
is at its side in free and unquestioned
circulation a volume of silver currency
sometimesequallingand sometimes even
exceeding it In amount, both main
tained at a parity notwithstanding a de
preciation or fluctuation in the intrinsic
value of silver.
Standard o/Vahie and Currency.
There is a vast difference between a
standard of value and a currency for
monetary use. The standard must
necessarily be fixed and certain, the
currency may be in divers forms and of
various kinds. No silver standard
country has a gold currency in circu
lation, but an enlightened and wise svs
tem of finance secures the benefits of
both goid and silver as currencv and
circulating medium by keeping the
standard stable and all other currency
at par with it. Such a system and such
a standard also give free scope for the
use and expansion of safe and conserv
ative credit so indispensable to broad
and growing commercial transactions
and so well substituted for the actual
use of money.
livery dollar of fixed and stable value
has throuSh
the agency of confident
credit an astonishing capacity of mul
tiplying itself in all work. Every un
stable and fluctuating dollar falls as a
basis of credit and In its use begets
gambling speculation and undermine*
the foundations of honest enterprise.
I have ventured to express myself on
this subject with earnestness and plain
ness of speech because I cannot rid mv
self of the belief that there lurks in the
proposition for the free coinage of sil
ver, so strongly approved and so en
thusiastically advocated bv a multi
tude of my countrymen, a serious men
ace to our prosperity and an insiduous
temptation to our people to wander
from the allegiance they owe to public
and private integrity. It is because
do not distrust the good faith and sin
cerity of those who press this scheme
that I have imperfectly but with zeal
submitted my thoughts upon this mo
mentous subject. I cannot refrain from
begging them to re-examine their vl«wa
and beliefs in the light of patriotic rea
son and familiar experience and to
weigh again and again the conse
quences of such legislation as
their
ef­
forts have invited. Even the continued
agitation of the subject adds greatly to
the difficulties of a dangerous financial
situation already forced upon us.
In conclusion I especially entreat the
people's representatives in the congress
who are charged with the responsibility
of inaugurating measures for the safe
ty and prosperity of our common coun
try, to promptly and effectively consider
the ills of our financial plight. 1 have
suggested a remedy which my judgment
approves. I desire, however, to assure
the congress that I am prepared to co
operate with them in perfecting any
other measure promising thorough and
practical relief and that I will gladly
labor with them in every patriotic en
deavor to further the Interests and
guard the welfare of our countrymen,
whom in our respective places of duty
we have undertaken to serve.

Convention to Divide the Diocese
Meets in Ijos Angeles.
Los Angeles, Cal., Dec. 3.—At the re
cent triennial convention of the Protest
ant Episcopal church in Minneapolis,
one of the first matters to receive the
sanction of both houses was a proposi
tion to divide the diocese of California
and to erect a new see In the southern
section of that state, and today the first
diocesan convention, called for the pur
pose of putting this action into legal ef
fect, opened in this city. Clerical and
lay delegates were present from the
counties of Santa Barbara, Ventura,
I-os Angeles, San Bernardino, River
side, Orange and San Diego, all of
which are within the new diocese,
Bishop Nichols, who has heretofore
ruled over the afTairs of the church in
the entire state, has chosen the north
ern diocese, having San Francisco for
its see city and it therefore becomes in
cumbent on the convention today to se
lect the first bishop of the new diocese.
A large number of representative di
vines have been spoken of in connection
with the elevation. First and foremost
Is Dr. Spalding of St. John's church,
San Franciso, who took a prominent
part in the convention at Minneapolis,
and towered like a giant among the cel
ebrated orators and debaters in that
gathering. Then there is Dr. Daniel H.
Greer of St. Bartholomew's church,
New York city, who refused a call to
become the successor of the late Phil
Hps Brooks in Boston, and would doubt
less have been a bishop ere this had he
accepted. Dr. J. H. Johnson of Christ
church, Detroit, Mich., has many
friends, but it is doubtful whether he
would accept an election, in view of the
fact that last year he declined the bish
opric of Indiana. Others favorably
mentioned are Rev. Dr. George W.
Douglass, formerly of Washington, D.
C., and who is now traveling in Europe
owing to ill health of his wife, and Rev.
H. B. Restarick of San Diego, who was
also a delegate to the recent convention.
The convention will doubtless decide
to designate the see as the "Diocese of
Los Angeles."

CONGRESS IS IN SESSION
An Unusual Number of Young
Statr smen.
Many of the Now Representative*
Are Uiuler Thirty—KiFeeiH of
the Great Landslide on
the Personnel.
Washington, Dec. 2.— The Fifty
fourth congress began lis public sessions
at noon today with crowded galleries
and many o-ther manifestations of acute
interest in its proceedings including, oi
course, the inevitable floral decorations.
For the third time in the last twenty
one years the popular will found expres
sion in a reversal of political dominance
and the new congress was called to order
with democratic ascendency in the sen
ate on the point of disapne-arlng and
the house overwhelmingly republican.
There were fifteen new faces among the
senators, not counting Mr. Chilton of
Texas, who reoccupkd a seat he once
held before by appointment, and there
were in addition thirteen re-elected sen
ators to be sworn in by Vice President
Stevenson as their own successors.
Of the holdover senators whose terms
will expire two years from now, some ot
the most prominent, including Black
burn, Brice, Hill. Voorhees. Vest and
Peifer, took their seats today with the
shadow hanging over 'hem of strong
probability that their places might be
filled by others when this congress ex
pired.
In the house of representatives, the
changes were still more marked. One
of the features which provoked com
ment from the galleries was the youth
ful appearance of many of the new mem
bers. Several states have sent as rep
resentatives, men who are still in their
twenties. Probably two score of oth
ers are under forty. In point of age,
the present house is the youngest known
to the history of American legislation.
These boyish appearing men, bright
faced. Intelligent looking, well groomed,
well mannered and well dressed, col
lege men, presented a striking contrast
in their youthful appearance to their
veteran associates, such as Grosvenor
of Ohio, whose flowing white beard gives
him a venerable appearance dispropor
tionate to his age to ox-Speaker Gal
usha Grow of Pennsylvania, hale, hear
ty and vigorous, despite the seventy and
odd years to Culberson of Texas, now
entering on his eleventh term, and other
of the house veterans whose political for
tunes were not temporarily submerged
in the November elections of 1S94.
But there were among the house neo
phytes older men, who also claimed the
attention of the galleries. There were
William C. Owens of Kentucky, who
defeated the silver tongued Breckin
ridge of Lexington for renomination
Chester I. Long of Kansas, who was re
peatedly pointed out as the successor of
Jerry Simpson, the populist leader of
Medicine Lodge James A. Connelly,
who takes the place of William M.
Springer, now a United States judge In
the Indian Territory, representing!
Abraham Lincoln's old district In Illi
nois. and Frederick Haltemmn of Phila
delphla, representing Samuel J. Ran
dall's old district, a district which never
before sent a republican to congress.
There were also many familiar faces
•*faces that are as well known to the
habitues of the gallery as the bronze
goddess of liberty. Among these were
Cannon and Hitt of Illinois, Henderson
and Dolliver of Iowa, Crisp, now de
posed from the speakership to the lead
ership of the opposition, and his col
league, Judge Turner of Gc-orgia Walk
er of Massachusetts, Allen and Catch
Ings of Mississippi and Docker* oi Mis

Carlisle's Ftetimntefi.
Washington, Dec. 2.—Secretary Car
lisle today sent to congress the esti
mates submitted by the several cabi
net officers of the money required to be
appropriated by the present congress
for conducting the government for the
fiscal year, ending June 30, 1897. The
estimates aggregate $418,091,073.
For 1896 the estimates footed up $410,
i35,079, and the appropriations made for
the year by congress aggregated $432,
753,264. Among the mass of detailed es
timates are noted: For a cable between
Alcatraz and Angel island. California,
$6,000 road to national cemetery, San
Francisco, $10,000 enforcement of Chi

Will Be Dismissed "Wednesday.
Chicago, Dec. 2.—Joseph B. Greenhut,
of whisky trust fame, will be purged of
:ontempt next Wednesday by the United
States court. So Judge Grosscup lold
Attorney Julian Mack this niarning.
Several days ago, when the matter was
brought to the court's attention, he re
fused to dismiss the case on his own re
sponsibility. He told Mr. Mack, how
ever, that if P. J. Goodhan & Co., of
New York, were willing to bear the bur
den ot refusing to come to Chicago and
testify as to facts which might tend to
wove the contempt, he would dismiss
he case'. Mr. Mack told the judge this
norning that his clients were unwilling
to come to Chicago on account of the
loss of time and expense. Personally
they cared nothing about the case.
They had no desire to see Mr. Greenhut
to jail.

the deposit in the Black Hills has beer,
such that blasting was necessary In or

s-rTHE BALL BEGINS.
its
rhoinas Brackett Reed ts Elected
Speaker of the Hoiiro.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 2.—At noon,
the hour of convening, the seats in the
senate were generally filled and the gal
leries were overflowing On the desks
of many members were floral tributes
from admirers and Senator Shoup was
•surprised by a basket of fruit and con
fections.
Never, perhaps, in the history of con
gress has a larger assemblage of specta
tors gathered in the galleries, halls and
corridors of the great marble rtructure.
An hour before noon, the galleries of
the house were packed and crowds
forceu their way into the chamber it
self. These, however, were dispossessed
by the dooi keeper as the hour of meeting
.approached and some minutes before
noon all the seats on both sidet were
occupied by those entitled to them—
the 244 republicans occupying, as usual,
che western side and the 105 democrats
he eastern side.
The floral tributes, as usual, plentiful
in number and unique in design, added
"an attractive background to ihe scene
on the floor. A bunch of exquisite
roses was one of four hothouse gifts
resting on Mr. Reed's desk.
At noon the Rev. Mr. Bagby, chaplain
of the last house, offered prayer. Then
Mr. Kerr, clerk of the last house, called
the members to order and the roll of
states was called, 341 members respond
ing.
Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio, rep., lose and
said:
"I have the honor to present the name
of Thomas Brackett Reed, a represen
tative In this body from the state of
Maine, for the office of speaker."
Before the sentence had been finished,
a hand clapping was started among the
republican members and for a minute
or so the applause was kept up on the
floor and repeated from the galleries.
Then Mr. Sayers of Texas, dem., nom
inated, in the same brief terms. Charles
F. Crisp, a representative from Georgia.
Mr. Kem, pop., Nebraska, nominated
John O. Bell, a republican from Colora
do. The nomination was greeted with a
laugh of derision from the republicans.
The only break from the political traces
was when Mr. Crane of Texas dem
cast his vote for Mr. Culberson of Tex
as, dem.
The result was as follows:
Reed 234 votes. Crisp 95, Bell fi, Culber
son 1.
The oath of ofilce was administered to
Mr. Reed by Mr. Harmer of Pennsyl
vania, rep., the member who has had
the longest continuous service.
The organization of the house was
completed by electing the following offi
cers: Mr. McDowell of Pennsylvania,
clerk Mr. Russell of Missouri, ser
geant-at-arms Mr. Glenn of New York,
doorkeeper Mr. McElroy of Ohio, post
master. and Rev. Mr. Couden of Mich
igan, chaplain.
IN THE SENATE.
Scntitors-Elect Take Oath of Of!lce-«
Adjourned Till Tomorrow.
Washington, Dec. 2.—Promptly at noon
the blind chaplain of the senate, Mr Mil
burn, tapped the gavel and offered prayer.
At the close, Vice Pro&ident Stevenson
laid before the senate the credentials of
the senator from Idaho, Mr. Shoup.
Then the vice president called upon the
senators-elect to come forward as their
names were called by the clerk and tak©
the oath of ofilce. Mr. Sherman, rep.,
Ohio, offered a resolution to inform the
house tbat the senate was organized and
ready for business, which was adopted.
On motion of Mr. Vilas, dem., Wisconsin,
a committee of two was appointed to join
a similar committee on the part of the
house to wait upon the president, the vice
president naming as such committee Mr.
Vilas and Mr. Allison.
The senate then took a recess for an
hour.
Immediately after the senate resumed
Mr. Sherman moved an adjournment til)
tomorrow, which was carried.
Cattle Shipments.
Chamberlain, S. D., Dec. 2.—Between
July 3 and the closing of navigation a
total of 4,532 head of fat cattle from the
ceded Sioux land ranges were crossed
on the pontoon boat at this point for
shipment to eastern markets. The ag
gregate value of the cattle was about
$180,000, and they were but a part of the
shipments from th's point.
The latest report from Rosebud agen
cy says the government experimental
artesian well now being sunk there Is
down 1,320 feet, without any indication
of water. As the well is located at an
elevation of 1,375 feet above the Mis
souri river at tills point, it is expected
that ihe well must be sunk nearly 2,000
feet In order to tap the artesian basin.
The contractor is required to go to a
depth of 2,600 feet unless water is struck
before reaching that depth.
