immediately appeared at the main door,
and the whlts-halrcd Isaac Bassett, of
the Senate staff, announced: "A mes
sage from the President." The large
document was carried to the Vice-President,
who directed that the message be
read. In the mean time printed copies
of the message had been secured by
many Senators, who read the text In
stead of listening to IL .
There was special attention given to
the reference to the China-Japan war.
It 'was the first official Information
known even to members of the Foreign
Affairs Committee.
It was much briefer, however, than
had been expected, and left still open
the exact details of the negotiations.
Shortly before the reference to China
Japan was reached the Chlneso Minis
ter, attended by Mr. Chung, an attache,
entered the gallery reserved for the
diplomatic orps, and were Interested
listeners to the foreign features of the
message.
TO REPEAL THE INCOME TAX.
Congressman Bnrtlett Introduces a
Dill for that Purpose.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3, The first bill
Introduced In the House to-day was one
by Mr. Bartlett (Dem., N. Y.) to repeal
the Income tax provisions of the Tariff
law.
Mr. Curtis, of New York, Introduced a
bill to restrict the appointment of cadets
to West Point and the Naval Academy
to one actual resident of the Congres
sional districts, one from each Territory
and the District of Columbia and ten to
be appointed at large by the President.
Representative -McMUlln, of Tennessee,
who was the prime mover for an Income
Tax law, says there Is no danger that It
will be repealed or that there will be no
appropriation for It this year.
Chairman Sayers, of the House Com
mittee on Appropriations, says that the
Income tax will be provided for In the
Urgency Deficiency bill.
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.-
President Clerelnnd Leaves 'Wood
ley for the Executive Mansion.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.-Presldent
Cleveland camo to the White House
from Woodley at 10 o'clock this morning.
It was the first visit he had mado to the
city In two weeks past.
He came alone and was met by Mr.
Thurber when he entered. The Presi
dent looked very well, considering the
severe Illness he has suffered from, and
the only outward sign of his ailment
was tho pronounced limp which charac
terized his walk from the carriage Into
the house.
Probably because his coming had not
been generally expected, there were very
few callers at the White House In the
morning, the only one of note being
Representative Catchlngs, of Mississippi,
who. In behalf of the Speaker, came to
Inquire whether the President would re
ceive the Committee of Notification at
the White House.
HAVEMEYERS SPEECHLESS.
They nrfnse to Comment Upon the
President's MeiMge,
The President's message was In the
hands of the Sugar Trust officials long
before Us publication In the afternoon
papers.
When an "livening World" reporter
saw the secretary, John E. Searles, at
tho offices, 117 Wall street, the latter
was visibly excited. He had Juet come
from a conference with Theodore A. and
II. O. Havemeyer.
"You must see Mr. Havemeyer either
of them will do.'he said. "I have notic
ing to say concerning - the i President's
message." "
When 11. O. Havemeyer was .seen im
mediately afterwards he said:,..'",
"See my brother, Theodore. I cannot
talk about It." . -
When Theodore A. Havemeyer was
seen he said:,
"See my brother, H. O. He will talk.
J "annot."
Both Havemeyrs were seen together
half an hour later. When approached
they cried In unison:
"I have an Important business meet
ing to attend."
Isaac Sellgman, of the firm of J.
& W. Sellgman Ci Co., brokers, 21 Broad
street, said:
"President Cleveland's attitude on the
drain on our gold reserve. Its cause and
remedy, Is perfectly sound. His remarks
on the lack of elasticity in our currency
circulation and Us frequent concentra
tion In financial circles, when It ' Is
most needed In other parts of the coun
try, are equally sound.
"I believe that Congress should
promptly authorise the Secretary of the
Treasury to issue a gold bond, say a 3-por-cent
bond. This would relieve the
drain upon our gold reserve and make
solid our credit"
Henry Clews said:
" The President's message Is of com
paratively little Importance. It will have
but little effect upon legislation during
the present short session of Congress, as
under the existing circumstances, alb
measures that may be Introduced will be
Inspired by members of Congress and
not by the Executive.
" No pop-gun legislation, or other dis
turbing measures can possibly become
law during this term of Congress."
HIS FINANCES ALL RIGHT.
So Says Bishop Cotter Regarding
Archbishop Ireland.
OREEN BAY, Wis., Dec, 3. Bishop
Cotter, of Winona, In an Interview, de
nies that Archbishop Ireland Is finan
cially embarrassed.
He says that Archbishop Ireland's vast
property has all been given to diocesan
usages, and the panic has helped to make
It difficult. to pay the tax's and Improve
ments. But the Archbishop's affairs, he
says, are all right. He will probably
soon Issue t personal statement, show
ing the state of things In the diocese.

HELPED . Bt -THE MESSAGE.
Rtook Fricea Bulod Higher in
Into Trading.
Sugar Rallied and Coalers and
Grangers Were Stronger.
A rise in sterling exchange to 4.S71-J
and 4.89, which revived the talk about
gold shlpmonts by this week's steamers,
wa availed ot by the bears to hammer
the stock market at the opening.
Prices yielded 1-1 to 1 1-S per cent..,
with Sugar and Chicago Oas In the
lead. The sellers were getting along
swimmingly, when suddenly heavy buy
ing orders appeared and the complexion
of affairs underwent a complete. change.
A feature of the dealings was the ac
tive demand for Northwest, over 10,000
shares being taken during the first hour
from 9S1-S up to 99
8ugar was purchased In blocks from
84 5- up to 80 f-4. Chicago Oas rose. 1 3-8,
to 701-8; Burlington 5-8, to 697-8; Canada
Southern 7-8, to 81; St. Psul 1-2, to
891-8; Bock Island 1-2, to 611-1; Louis
ville & Nashville G-8. to 54 6-8: Manhat
tan, 5-8, to 106 3-4: Missouri Pacific S-4,
to 281-4; Jersey Central 1-2, to 94, and
Western Union 8-8, to 87 1-2. In the In
active Hat American Tobacco jumped 3,
to 95.
The sharp Jump In Sugar gave rise to
rumors that the directors of the Trust
would override President Havemeyer
and would declare the regular dividend
of 3 per cent for the quarter, but this
seems hardly poailble. In view of the fact
that the operations of the Trust have
been so conducted as to make a poor
shotting on the reassembling of Con
gress. Money 1 a 2 per cent, on call. Foreign
exchange firm, with sales of bankers'
60-day bills at 4.86 3-4 a 4.87, and sight
at 4.87 a 4 88. The offerings of bills are
light and 'he demand fairly active.
Commercial bar sliver declined to
615-x. Mexican dollars are unchanged
at -V). Bar silver In London fell to
'J8 3-Sd. per ounce.
The early rise In Sucar Induced sales
for both accounts and the price ran off
2 6-8, to 84 1-8. The decline was due to
advices from Washington that the Presi
dent, In bis annual message recom
mends the abolition of the one-eighth
differential on refined sugar.
The stock market gained strength as
the day drew to a close, and still higher
prices were made. Sugar, after selling
down to 82 3-4. rallied to 84.
The strongest stocks were the Gran
gers, Lake Shore and the Coalers. Thero
were free purchases to cover short
The President's message had a favor

(Continued from First Page.)
at the beginning 'of the controversy to
tender our good offices to induca an
amicable arrangement ot the Initial dif
ficulty growing out of the Japaneso do
mands for administrative reforms In
Corea; but the unhappy precipitation
of actual hostilities defeated this kindly
purpose.
Deploring the destructive war between
the two most powerful or the Kastern
nations and anxious that our commer
cial interests in tnoso countries may
be preserved and that the safely of our
cltlsens there shall not be Jeopardised.
I would not hesitate to heed any intima
tion that our friendly old ror the honor
able termination ot hostilities would be
acceptable to both belligerents.
A convention has been finally concluded
for the settlement by n mutation of the
prolonged dispute with Ecuador growing
out of the proceedings against Kmlllo
Santos, a naturalised citizen of tho
United States.
Acting upon the reported discovery of
Texas fever In r.'trgoes of American cat
tle, the Qermah prohibition against Im
portations ot live stock and fresh meals
from this country has been revived, it
Is hoped that Germany will soon become
convinced that the Inhibition Is as need
less as It Is harmful to mutual Interests.
HEPKALINQ DlSCniMIXATlNQ 1JL'-
IIUS.
The Qerman Government has protested
against 'hat provision of the customs
tariff act which Imposes n discriminating
duty of one-tenth of one cent n pound
on bursts coming from countries paying
an export bounty thereon, claiming that
the exaction of such duty Is In contra
vention of articles five and nine of the
treaty of 1828 with Prussia,
In the Interests cf the commerce o
both countries and to avoid even the
accusation of treaty1 violation, I recom
mend Ihe repeal of so much of the
statute as Imposes that duty, and t In
vite attention to tho accompanying
report of the Secretary of State contain
ing a discussion of tho questions raised
by the German protests
81nce communicating the voluminous correspond
enoe In regard to Hawaii end the action taken
br toe senate and Ilouae of Ilepreeentattvee nn
certain qurstlona submitted to the lodgment and
wider discretion ot Congress. Ihe organisation 1 f

rangement which followed fhe depostUun of the

etfectlio op'rstlon. The recognition usual In such
cases has been accorded the new UovernmenL
.t'nder our present trestles of eitraditlon wUh
Hair lolerarrlaaee of Justice have occurred owing
to the refusal of that (Internment to surrender Its
Own subjects. Thus tsr our efforts to negollete
an amended convention obWttlng this difficulty
have b?eu unavailing.
Apart from the war In which tho Isl
and Umpire Is ngaged, Japan nttracts
Increasing attention In this country by
her evident desire to cultlvnte moro lib
eral Intercourse with us and to seek our
kindly aid in furtherance of her lauda
ble desire for complete automony In her
domestic affairs and full equality In the
family of natloi.s. The Japanese Lib
plre of to-day Is no longer the Japan of
tho past, and nur relations with this
Erogreaalve nation should not be 1-ss
road and liberal than those with other
pon crs.
Good will fostered br many Interests In com
mon haa marked our relations with our neereat
Southern neighbor. Peace being restored along
her northern frontier. Meilco has aaked ths
punlvhment of the late disturbers ot bar tran
quillity. There ougin to be a new treaty of
commerce and navigation with that country to
take the place of the one which terminated thir
teen yeara ago. The frlendllneas of the Inter
course between the two countries Is attested by
the fact that during thla long period the com
irerce of each haa steadily Increaeed nnder the
rule of mutual consideration, being neither stim

TUB nitUnFIELUS IXCIDKNT.
Prominent among the questions ot the
year "vat thu nideflelds Incident. In what
Is known as the Mosquito Indian Strip,
bordering on the Atlantic Ocean and
nlthln the jurisdiction of Nicaragua. By
the treaty of '800 between Great Drltaln
and Nicaragua the former Government
expressly recognized the sovereignty of
the latter over the Strip, and a limited
form of self-government was guaranteed
-o the Mosquito Indians, to be exercised
according to t.ielr customs, for them
selves ond other dwellers within Its
llmts. The so-called native Government,
which grew to te largely made up of
aliens, for many years disputed the sov
ereignty of Nicaragua over the Strip
and claimed the right to maintain there
in a practically Independent municipal
fovetnmnnt. Early In the past year ef
oris of Nicaragua to maintain sov
ereignty over the Mosquito territory led
to serious disturbances culminating In
the suppression of the native Govern
ment and h attempted substitution of
an Impracticable, composite atlmlnstra
tlon, In which Nicaragua and alien resi
dents were to participate. Failure was
followed by an insurrection which for a
time subverted Nfcaraguan rule, expel
ling her officers and restoring1 the old
organization. This, In turn.' gave place
to the existing local government cutub
llshed and upheld by Nicaragua.
Although tho alien Interests arrayed
agaltiBt Nicaragua In these transactions
have been largely American, and the
commerce ot that region for some time
has been and still Is chiefly controlled
by our citizens, we cannot for that
reason chnllenge the rightful sover
eignty of Nicaragua over this Important
part of her domain.
For some months one, and during part
of the time two, ot our naval ships
have been station at Dlueflelds for the
protection of all legitimate Interests of
our citizens. In September last the
Government at Managua expelled from
Its territory twelve or more foreigners.
Including two Americans, for alleged
fiartlclpatlon In the seditious or revo
utlonary movements against the re
public at Blueflelds already mentioned;
but through the earnest remonstrunce
of this Government the two Americans
have been permitted to return to the
peaceful management ot their business
Our naval commanders at the scene of
these disturbances, by their constant
exhibition of firmness and good Judg
ment, contributed largely to the pre
vention of more serious consequences
and to the restoration of quiet and
order. I regret that In the midst of
these occurrences there happened a
most grave -and Irritating failure of
Nlcaraguan justice. An American citi
zen named Wilson, residing at Rama,
in the Mosquito territory, was mur
dered by one Arguello, the acting Gov
ernor of the town. After some delay
the murderer was arrested, but so In
securely conflned or guarded that he
escaped, and, notwithstanding our re
peated demands, It Is claimed that his
recapture has been Impossible, by rea
son of his flight beyond Nlcaraguan
Jurisdiction.
The Nlcaraguan authorities having
given notice of forfeiture of their con
cession to the canal company, on
grounds purely technical nnd not em
braced In tho contract, have receded
from that position. '

In my last annual message I referred
briefly to the unsatisfactory state of af
fairs In Bamos, under the operation of
the llerlln treaty, as signally Illustrating
the Impolicy of entangling alliance with
foreign powers; and. nn May 9, 1K94, In
response to a resolution of the Senate,
I sent a special message and documents
to that body on tho sarno subject, which
emphasized my previously expressed
opinions. Later occurrences, the corre
spondence In regard to which will be laid
before Congress, further demorntrnte
that the Government which was devised
by the three powers nnd forced upon the
Ramoann against their Inveterate hos
tility can be maintained only by tho
continued presenco of foreign military
forco and at no email sacrifice of life
and treasure.
The Suppression of the Mat.inf.-t Insur
rection by the powers, snj the subse
quent banishment of the leader ami
eleven other chiefs, nn recited In my
last message, did not bring lasting
peace to the Islands. FormlUable upris
ings continued, nnd finally a rebellion
broke out In the capital island, Upolu,
headed In Anns, the ncstrn district,
by the younger Tamaseee, and In Atua,
the eastern district, by other leaders..
Tho insurgents ravaged the country and
fought the Government's troops up to the
vtrv doors of Apia. The King again ap
pealed to the powers for help, nnd the
combined Hi itlsh nnU German naval
forces reduced the Atuans to nppsrent
subjection not, however, without con
siderable loss to the natives. A few days
later Tsmasese and his adherents, fear
ing the ships and the marines, professed
submission.
TIIOMILES I.Y SAMOA.
Reports received from our agents at
Apia do not Justify the belief that the
peace thus brought nbout will bo of
long duration. It Is their conviction
that the natives are lit heart hoatllo to
the present Government; that such of
them as profess loyalty to It do so from
fear of the powers, and that It would
speedily go to pieces If the war ships
were withdrawn. In reporting to his
Goernment tin the unsatisfactory situ
ation since the suppression of the lato
levolt by foreign armed forces, the Ger
man Consul at Apia stated:
"That peaco will be lasting Is hardly
to be presumed. The lesson given by
firing on Atua was not sufficiently sharp
and Incisive to leave a lasting impres
sion on the forgetful 8amoun tempera
ment. In fact, conditions aro existing
which show that peace will not last
lletoa, the King, and his chiefs are con
vinced that the departure of the war
ships will be a signal for a renewal of
war. The clicumstance that the rep
resentatles of the villages of all the
districts which were opposed to tho
Government have already withdrawn to
Atua 'to hold meetings, -anti that both
Atua and Anna have forbidden Inhab
itants of those dlstrlots Which fought on
the side of the Government to return
to their vlllagcs'and have already partly
burned down the latter. Indicate that
a real conciliation of the parties Is still
far off."
And In a note of the 10th ultimo. In
closing a copy of that report for the in
formation of this Government, the Ger
man Ambassador Hald:
"The contents of tho report awakened
the Imperial Government's apprehen
sion that under existing circumstances
the peace concluded with the rebels will
afford no assurance of "the lasting res
toration of tranquillity In tho Islands."
The present Government has utterly
failed to correct. If Indeed It has not
aggravated, the very evils It was Intend
ed to prevent. It has not stimulated
our commerce with the Islands. Our
participation In Its establishment
against the wishes of the natives was
In plain defiance of tho conservative
teachings and warnings of the wise and
patriotic! men who laid the foundations
of our free Institutions, and I Invite an
expression of the Judgment of Congress
on the propriety of steps being taken
by this Government looking to tho with
drawal from Its engagements with the
other powers on some reasonable terms
not prejudicial to any of our existing
rights.

graphic work, which must be dene over and -over
agsli by reason of the shifting an J tarylng
depths of water, consequent upon tbt action ot
streams and tides, has herttofort been done undtr
tht direction of naval officers In sobordlnstloi to
tht Superintendent of tht Coast Purvey. There
stems to bt no gjod resson why tht navy should
not hare entlrt chirie hertifttr of such work,
especially aa tht llydrograpblc OCJct of tht Navy
Department Is now. and baa bstn tor many years,
tnesged In making efficient maps entirely similar
to tbost preparad by tht Coast Survey.
1 ftel It my Imperative duty to call attention
to tht recommendation of tht Secretary In re
gard ti the personnel of tht lint of tht Nary.
Tht stagnation of promotion In this, tbt vital
branch of the service, ts to great at to seriously
Impair Its efflclenry,
I consider it of tht utmost Importanct that tht
young and middle-aged officers should, btfore
the tvt of retirement, bt permitted to reach a
grade en'ltllng them to active and Important
duty,
'The system adopttd a ftw years ago regulating
tht employment of labor at tht Nary-yardt It
rigidly upheld, and has fully lemonst rated tta
usefulness and eipeJtency, It It within tht do
main of ClvlI-Servlce reform. Inasmuch aa work
men art employed through a board of labor tt
lee ted at each Navy-yard, and art given work
without reference to polltlca and In tht order of
thtlr application, preference, however, being
Ktveu to Army and Navy veterans and thoet bar
log former Nary-yard tvptrlenct.
Amendments so tees ted by experience have been
madt to tht rules regulating tht system. Through
lit optrstloA. the work at our navy-yards haa
bttn taatly Improvtd In efficiency, and the oppor
tunity to work haa been honestly and fairly
awarded to willing anl competent applicants.
It Is hoped that. If thla system continues to be
strictly adhered to, there will toon be, at a
natural consequent, such an equalisation of party
beneOi aa will remove all temptation to relax or
abandon IL
SOLUTIUXOK rilE INDIAN mOULUM
I am convinced that tho proper solu
tion of tho Indian problem and the suc
cess of every step taken 'n that direc
tion depend to a very targe extent upon
the Intelligence and honesty of the reser
vation ugents and the Interest they have
In their work. An agent fitted for his
placa can do much towards preparing
tho Indians tmJor his chare e for citizen-J-hip
and allotment of their lands, and
hU hdvlt-e ti any matter concerning
their welfare will not mislead. An unfit
agent will make no effort to advance
the Indlins on his rervatlJn towards
civilisation or preparation for allotment
of lands In severalty, and his opinion as
to their condition In this and other re
gards Is heedless and valueless.
The indications are that the detail of
army officers as Indian agents will
result In Improved management on the
reservation
Whenever allotments are made and
any Indian on tho reuervatlon. has pre
viously settltd upon a lot and cultivated
tt or shown a disposition to Improve It In
any way, such lot should certainly b air
lotted to him, and this .should be made
plainly obligatory by statute.
