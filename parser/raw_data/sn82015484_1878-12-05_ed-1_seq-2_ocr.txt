State Pjuxtec The State Printer contest
come np again, this Winter. We have a prefer
ence among the candidates, lint hare no interest
in the office, and shall, therefore, not advocate
the claims or any caudldato. Bat there is a
candidate who is malting a strong effort, whom
we do not want to see elected. That candidate
is Samnel Dodsworth, of Leavenworth. It has
been charged that George Martin does commer
cial printing, that ought to go to the offices in
the several Cocntie. Unt Mr. Martin says he
never solicit sneh wojlc, and takes it only when
it is tbrnst upon him; and tbt tbe major part
of the commercial work that he does, is such a
the country offices are not prepared to do. Unt
Samuel Dodsworth is the worst competitor that
Kansas country printing offices have. He is
constantly, in person or by letter or sample, so
liciting work tUat Intimately belongs to offices
in the several Counties. Year after year, Coun
ty Doardi are solicited to give him the printing
of assessment blanks, tax receipts, County war
rants, and all manner of other County blanks,
that the offices in ilie Comity are prepared to
do. By gettiug the work fur a large number of
Counties, he is enabled to do It at reduced pric
es, and therefore ho is constantly undermining
the conutry i.fflerJi. The St. Joe. Steam Print
ing Company do not do this, and we do not be
lieve that George W. Uarllti d, or that other
candidates for Printer wonld. Mr. Dodsworth
is the only mau who noses in, and seeks to take
from the country primer bis legitimate patiou
oge. We hpe the KaiiMi pspe rs n ill pass bim
around, and do all in their pmvir to keep him
out of a ponitiou iu which he could do them still
greater damage.
Bkfobm A glorious thing is Reform. If Ke
pnhlicans can be baten ou the issue of Keforni,
itis a graud achievement, although Republicans
may have conducted public affairs with the
strictest integrity. Brown County, west of us,
has experienced the benefit of Reform. For
years, the Republicans bad control of the Connty
offices, and iu that time not dollar was lost to
the people. But the Grange reformation struck
the County, and the people wanted Reform.
They elected a Reformer County Treasurer, over
a good Republican, and re-elected him; and
when he could no longer be re elected, by reason
of a wise provision in onr laws, his deputy was
elected to the office. Then a settlemeut with
the Reform Treasurer was necessary. It is now
openly asserted that at least $12,000, if not more,
has somehow slipped out, during the adminis
tration of this Reformer and his Reform depnty.
But if the people of Brown County are williug
to pay for Reform, they ought to enjoy It. The
Democrats aud Reformors have for years been
trying to get bold of the important offices of
Donlphao County. The Republicau officers
liavo never stolen a dollar from the County, but
fttill some people are clamorous for Reform. If
they ever do succeed iu their designs, it will
turn out to be such Reform as the people of
Brown Connty have enjoyed.
ty The Holton Recorder disputes our asser
tion, that Hayes' policy secured Democratic ma
jorities in both branches of Congress. It says
the House was Democratic beforo Hayes was in
augurated. We do not charge that Hayes' pol
icy was responsible for every Democratic vio
tory, before his election ; but we still staud by
our assertion, that be is responsible for Demo
cratic majorities in both branches of Congress.
Ho betrayed the Republicans of the South, and
demoralized and disheartened, for a time, those
of tho North. Had he not betrayed tboSmth
ern Republicans, they would have elected
enough members of Congress, this year, to have
made the House Republican. Had it not been
for him, the Republicans would have had two
Senators from South Carolina, two from Louisi
ana, one from Ohio, aud one, if not two, from
Indiana. He was responsible for Ohio going
Democratic, last year, enabling them to elect a
Senator, and to Gerymauder th Statu so as to
gain half a dozen or more Cuugressiaau. Hois
a first-class fraud, and has done the Republicau
party more harm than he could do it good, were
he to lire a thousand years, aud devote bis
whole time to the business.
X5T And now the man who defeated the rene
gade, Curtin, in Pennsylvania, is to bo contest
ed ont of bis seat. Tho reason, as giveu, is, that
tho District Is very strongly Daiuocratic, and
everybody expected that Curtin would bo elec
ted by at leant 3,000 majority; but he was very
sick ut the time of the election, and, to the sur
urise of everybody, he was defeated. This
makes tho election fraudulent. It is very sin
gular that, with every County iu the District
having over 1,000 Democratic majority, the Re
publicans were able to perpetuate such enor
mous frauds at the polls. But a Democratic
Congress will place Cnrtiu iu a poiition where
the people refused to pnt bim.
jf Onu ot the latest Constitutional amend
tueuts provides that when the right of suffrage
in auy State is abridged or denied to any class
of citizens, the representation of that State iu
Cougress shall be leduced in proportion. Rep
resentative Page, of California, will offer a res
olution reducing the representation of those
Southern State in which Republicau have
been deprived of a vote. But as Congress is Dem
ocratic, thcru is no prospect that such a meas
ure can pass. However, it will offer an oppor
tunity to the Democrats to practice their pro
fessions of accepting the Coustitutioual amend
ments iu good faith.
S We recently mentioned that W. V. Barr,
"formerly of Kansas," was the candidate of the
Greenbackers, or Nationals, or whatever they
call themselves, for Congress in the First Illi
nois District, in the vicinity of Chicago. Per
haps the reader would like to know how ha came
out. lie came out the hindmost of four, falling
even below the candidate who ran as a "Socialist-"
Out of 23,013 votes cast iu the District,
ho received but 1,85.. Ban's popularity docs
not seem to increase by immigration.
CF Congress is in sessisn. The Southern
Democrats and their Northern donkeys express
surprise at the President's changed tone. Sena
tor Blaine has offered a resolution for investi
gating the Southern electiou outrages, and the
Democrats are surprised again. They never
beard of any oatrages iu the South ; and they
want the resolution to include election outrages
in the North.

alone cannot be bought for lea than about 50

scibers might have expected it to stop on their

backing the paper, for the purpose of advocating
the most foolish and disgusting Greenback and
Communistic doctrines, as the surest way of set

is still made. Now that tbe elections are over,

Editor Chief : Here we are, iu the metropolis of
the United States, and, as we expect to stay awhile,
we shall try to send you a letter weekly, telling your
readers the most important news, gossip, etc
Tbe police are no nearer a clew as to who desecrat
ed the grave of A. T. Stewart than they were two
weeks ago ; iu fact, things seem to become more com
plicated and confusing as time passes, and the sensa
tional New York dalies are about out of material for
scare heads. Judge Hilton has offered an additional
$5,000, making $30,000, for the arrest and conviction
of tho thieves, and return of the body, or $10,000 for
any one of tho ghouls, (it is conjectured that there
are five men implicated,) and the return of the body.
It is a pnzxle to us to know how it will bo proved
that the right corpse er bones arc returned. Mrs.
Stewart is in very delicate health, and this event has
causrd bar to grow worse.
The weather has been gloomy and disagreeable,
for the past week, but the people move to and fro as
lively as on clear days, and business, to all outward
appearance, is lively, but on investigation, it is dull,
and hundreds are out of employment. This has been
the complaint for the last five years, throughout the
wfaola country.
Talmage draws crowded audiences every Sunday,
at the Brooklyn Tabernacle, who listen with the
most profound attention to h(s descriptions of the
night side of New York. No one nods or sleeps in
his presence. He is so full of life himself, that be
stirs np every one within hearing distance ; wp think,
however, he is too sensational, exaggerates his awful
pictures, and describes the disease to soch an extent
that he forgets to give a remedy. Perhaps he will
give it pretty soon, for he hss promised to tell of tbe
bright side of Gotham, as soon as he has finished
narrating his dark journey.
How the New Yorkers who live on tbe streets
whero the elevated railroad passes manage to keep
from tearing np the whole roadway, is beyond onr
comprehension. Soch a clatter! Every two minutes
a train goes thundering by, making more noise than
well, we can't tell what. Besides, in the narrow
streets, the iron frames and girders shut out the light,
and the smoke and dust remain, to make the bad air
worw. This mode of transit is of great benefit to
those living far from their business, and is a great
improvement on the strut cars, for one can keep
warm, and get home In a few minutes from his place
of teal. A great blessing it is to some, while to oth
ers it is a nuisance.

nEAD'WaTEK or Salt Rivxk, )
November 15, 1878. $
Ma EblTOE : As tho Greenback party dies an an
nual death, I thick it well that we should leave some
memorial of onr existence and onr mission behind us.
From my present position head waters Salt River
I can survey tbe field, and correct our bearings. This
shall be done in due time ; and when we enter tbe
field in 1879, we shall come a "a giant refreshed
from his slumbers." But, in the meantime, let me
say to my Greenback friends "who still lire" Be of
good cheer. One more funeral like tho present, and
we rise to die no more forever. In this contest va
bare done well ; we have more than tripled onr num
bers, and hold the balance of power in the next Con
gress ; and, God be prsissd ! CTen in Kansas, we hare
not been unmindful of our dnty. Let ns keep the
watch-fires burning, and light oar beacons oo every
hill, so that by 1830 we can be prepared for victory,
stemember, onr cause is just, and our means are
honest. We demand "equal and exact jnstiee for all
men." We deroacd that legislation shall b for the
interests of off the people the whole people "the
greatest good to the greatest number." For these
end are governments established among men. For
these ends the Revolution was fought and the Re
bellion pnt down ; and for these ends are the work
ing own combining, and the Greenbackers organiring.
We want no rings, no monopolies, no class legisla
tion, no bond, and no delated monrgt Away with
banks of issue and shoddy money! We want no
Peter Funks to tell us how much money we shall
use, or of what kind it shall be. Away with them
and it give us the greenback without the debasing
brand on its back gennine greenbacks and the
people shall live again. Give us equal laws, and
equal taxation, so that the hardens and blessings of
government shall fall, as do the showers of rain, up
on all alike; the high and the low, tbe rich and the
poor. We ask, in the language of James Madison,
in his seventh annual message, that "the notes of the
Government shall be issued upon motives of general
policy, as a common medium of circulation.' Genu
ine greenbacks, these.
Now. sir, we Greenbackers have determined not to
be "hewers of wood and drawers of water" to this
congregation of bondholders, forever. No, sir; that
condition of things must cease We can see no in
justice iu paving these men in full, in genuine green
backs, full legal tenders for all debts, and not all in
Fiat gold and Fiat silver. This would give us, in
greenbacks, about $1,800,000,000, and something less
than we had in 18GG, when the shoddy bankers, with
out the fear of "inflation" before their eyes, shoved
ont 171,000,000 of their currency onto the people.
This 'currency' we can dispense with ; bnt give us
good money Uncle Sam's money and the country is
safe, and we are content Wonld to God that this
could be brought about without the intervention of
the Greenback party. Bnt this cannot be done, hence
we most organize, let us honor the men who, without
money and without price, have borne the brunt of
battle, and hild up the cause of honest money, Such
men as Taylor, Elder, Gsle, and above all. our gal
lant Mitchell, who, by word and work, day and
night, everywhere, all over the State, spoke to and
stirred the hearts of tbe people as they had never
been moved before. Bravely done, "Elder" Mitchell.
Ton failed, bnt you deserved success; and every
Greenback man will wear you in his heart as a cham
pion worthy of his cause, and yet to be honored; for
Truth crushed to earth shall rise again,
The eternal years of God are hers ;
But Error, wounded, writhes in pain.
And dies amid her worshippers.
In 1830, we shall call you to the front again, and
marshal our forces for ono grand charge on the hosts
of shoddy. Then shall a ransomed people rejoice,
for Itrsumption will have done its work. Resump
tion i ah, yes, Resumption will seem a blessing for
two months or more, whilst Congress is in session, at
least ; but from March 4 to July 4, it will be a vcrv
different matter. Then there will be "weeping and
wailing, aud gnashing of teeth." Then will Sherman
izing be the order of the day. Then we will find that
the repeal of the Bankrupt law cannot prevent bank
ruptcy, as Sherman promised it would do ; and when
Scott, Gould, Vanderbilt, aud Garrett shall have
pooled their interests against our Resumption sham,
as they will surely do in March next, it will be worse
than Jim Fisk or Black Friday. Then look out for
Shermanizing on a grand scale ; for it will be nice
weather until Congress meets again, and gold and
silver are the only legal tenders after Januray next,
and shoddy money will be at a discount.
Now, in conclusion, let me thank my friends, per
sonal and political, who havo honored me by such a
generous support, running me ahead of my ticket,
even in the face of falsehood and trickery. That I
had nothing to do with the passage of the herd law,
all inquiring men well know. True, I favored the
law, and acted as the attorney of those favoring it,
in 1876, and I desired it to be submitted to a vote, and
expected it to be done ; and here my mission ended
on this subject. Again, I thank you, fellow-citizens,
for this evidence of your confidence. Friends of Burr
Oak and Wayne, I thank you ; and colored friends
everywhere, I more than thank you. Yours, etc.,
B. O'DRISCOLL.
JOHN GRABLE.
Eiiitob Chief: No person, whether Jew, Gentile,
Mohammedan, Brahmin, Free Thinker, or devotee of
any other of the one thousand religions of the world,
ever walked down into the dark valley of the shadow
of death with a firmer step with more fortitude
than did John Grablc I visited him at the begin
ning of his sickness, and when later he came to the
conclusion that ho was soon It, go, and sent for me, I
found him cheerful, and perfectly reconciled to tbe
mandates of Nature. Knowing nothing of the future,
he could frame no belief concerning it. Belief with
out evidence he regarded as superstition. Heap,
plied the samo rules of reasoning to the solution of
this problem that he did to all the questions of life.
"As the world goes," said he, "proofs arc called for
in finance, politics, bpsiness, law, mathematics, the
sciences, etc., and evidence must precede conviction
and belief everywhere bnt in theology. There you
must go it blind shut your eyes, and run with the
crowd." lie thought that whatevor future awaited
him, woujd be for the best. Nature committed no
wrongs. She dealt honorably and equitably with
her children sought their good in this life, and
would undoubtedly do so in the next, if there was
onr. He was not afraid to trust her. He had a cu
riosity to know what, if anything, was behind tbe
veil. If he awotp to another existence, he felt as
sured of greater scopo for enjoyment than in this life.
If he should never wsfcr, he wonld never know it.
If he had ever wronged a human being, be did not
know it. He thought tbe best preparation fur the
next life, if there was one, wss to follow the impulses
of love, gnided by the dictates of reason, in this one
Reason was the gift of the Infinite, to be a lamp to
our ieet a light to our path. A man without reason
is a brute a religion without reason was on the same
let el. There was bnt one only true religion tbe re
ligion of Nature natural religion, and not unnatural
religion. His conversation showed that be contem
plated death with a philosophic mind, and a simple,
childlike trust in the infinite goodness of Nature.
He requested me to take his body, after death, to
the St. Joseph Medical College, for examination and
dissection, and the preparation of his skeleton for
lecture-room uses and the museum. I endeavored to
dissuade him from this purpose. lie finally said I
might do as I thought best bury bim under a tree
there, either with or without autopsy, or give his
body to the college. If I buried him, I must, of course,
use the forms of the Liberals. He did not want a
clergyman to officiate. Not that he had anything
agaiust them, as individuals, but no did not believe
in their doctrines. He thought that if a man belong
ed to an organization, whether Masons, Odd-Fellows,
Methodists, Catholics, or what not, it was right for
his society to bury him with its peculiar honors and
rites. As for him, he belonged to the grest church of
humanity, apd he wanted to be buried, if buried at
all, by its forms. lie knew that I had the song and
form books of both the English and American lib
erals. Nothing was said about cremation, at that
time. The editor of the Ciiemisunderttood me. It
was weeks before, while spending the night with me,
at Troy, that we talked about cremation.
The next day, Mr. Grable seemed better. I bade
bim good-bye, and it was the last time I saw him
alive. A few days later, he requested his daughter
Rose to write for me to come again, bnt the letter
never reached me. At his death, he was conscious,
and conversed InteUigently to tbe last moment. In
deed, he was in the middle of a sentence when life
expired. After his death, Mrs. Grable telegraphed
for me, as be had directed her to do. I went, ex
pecting to bury him. But it appears that in the
meantime he had entered into definite arrangements
with the college for tbe reception of his body. Upon
learning this, 1 made no objection to the carrying ont
of his wishes. While I well knew that he had a right
to dispose of his body as in his judgment he saw fit,
yet I could not help feeling and expressing regret
that he had made such a disposition of it imperative
upon his family and friends. Dr. Crippen, who
was employed by Mrs. Grable to attend the body in
a professional capacity, expressed himself as feeling
in the matter precisely as I did.
It was noon the next day when we got started. To
Wathena it was about six miles, and tbe roads very
heavy. There a consultation was held, and as Dr.
CripPfB willingly offered to assume the responsibili
ty of delivering the body to the college in person,
withoat farther assistance from ma, it wu thought
best for Mrs. Grable and myself to not go over the
rirer, bnt trust the body to him. I was" anxious tq
get borne, as my wife was sick; and if I went to St.
Joseph, it wonld necessitate my remaining away
from home another eight- I there handed to Dr.
Crippen the paper signed by tha tamily, and request
ed him to take receipt for tbe body, and returait
to Mr. Grable. Whoever started the story that I re
fused to deliver Mr- Grable' body Jo. the Medical
College, either started an Intended falsehood, or
was incapable of discriminating between a refusal,
and language intended to express my willingneM to
do it. at the same time wishing it had been otherwise.
Perhaps it is wrong for me to entfcrtabi a preference
for burial, but nothing was more foreign to my hon
est intenllehi than a refusal to carry out Mr. Grable
wishes, after I found ont what they were.
Arriving at Troy, I met Col. Tracy, of the Herald,
just starting tor St. Joseph, and we had a talk about
Mr. l.rable s death. I. briefly wrote tbe tacts, ana
handed them to him, which appeared in the Herald,
signed "S." It is not stated there that I delivered
the body to the college. The Chief, however, infer
red that I did. Bat it does state that I was commis
sioned by Mr. Grable to dispose of his body, and. that
it had been delivered to tbe college, in accordance
with hut wishes. AU of whkb. was literally true. It
is not a matter of overwhelming importance how far
I went with the body, or whose custody it was in the
balance of the way. I bad so authority to publish
Dr. Crippen's name in connection with the matter,
and therefore did not. From some remarks of bis, I
have serious donbts about his thanking any one for
his name being used.
After the issue of November 1, the editor of the
Chief met me upon the street, and we had some talk
abont Mr. Grable' death, but he did not hint that he
intended publishing anything further on the subject.
In interviewing for publication, it is nsual(l J to In
form the victim to that effect, thereby putting him
on his guard ; and (2) to put it in writing, and read
it to him for approval. Neither was done. I was
sorry any reference was made in his editorial to some
of Mr. Grable' neighbors, or to hi property, or to
tbe theology of the tamily, ot to the crowd that gath
ered there that night. I did not say I was in danger
of being mobbed, bnt that at one time I thonght, If
tbe liquor hebl out, there might be a mob or a row
before morning. At one time, by actual count, I saw
fifteen men inside and several outside the house, be
sides tho hired maa and myself; Dr. Crippen not hav
ing arrived. They conversed among themselves, bnt
I overheard some denunciations abont the disposition
of the bod v. There were no threats or demands made,
that I know of. Some drunken ruffians came into the
room where the hired maa and I;had retired, and
jerked the clothes off the1 bed, and wanted to fight.
One of them offered to ump" me for "two cents."
The price appeared extremely low, but not being In
fighting condition, I declined the entertainment. This
might or might not havo been an attempt to get a
row started. They stole a rair of gloves out of my
overcoat pocket, and a monkey-wrench ont of my
buggy- But it was not my intention to make tbe affair
public, and I regret that the Chief mentioned it, The
faets, however, are as I state them. People can draw
their own conclusions. Instead of 210, Mr. Grable
owned 433 acres of land. Liabilities, HfiOO, at 10 per
cent, $900 having three instead of two years to run.
Mr. Grable was sot what I call an Infidel. Rev.
John Cook's definition of tbe word is unquestionably
correct. In a sermon here in Troy, he held that
church members who were unfaithful to their pro
fessions and their beliefs, wrro the real Infidels,
and not those unbelievers who eert consistent and
faithful to their beliefs. The word Infidel means not
faithful. Mr. Grable tntlr faithful in every sense of
the word. He did not dis-believo in a future life, as
yon stated. On that question he 'was negative or
passive neither believed or disbelieved. Still, he
thought the evidence was against it However, he
hofed that, in her intricate and mighty potencies and
powers, Nature had made provision (by a higher
stato of existence, where he could go on with the re
searches and studies begun in this. And when you
come down to the point, that is where most men stand.
When yen find n man that Jruoirt all about the In
finite and the future existence, &c, 4c, you gener
ally find an ass. Mr. Grable prudently refrained
from guesting about what he knew nothing of, but
still thought that his guess was as good as a preach
er's. Mr. Grablc didnt believe in "speerits." He
thought that if he survived the dissolution of this
body, he would exist still in a natural body ore
fined and ethererialized form of matter and that in
time, one might wear out, nnd give place to a higher
type, and so on. He thought that a thing was either
something or nothing, and it couldn't be something
unless it had substance. Outside of matter in some
of its forms, visible or Invisible, thcrp w as nothing.
As to his financial scheme, it was not so visionary
and Utopian as some wonld make ns believe He
had advocated it for forty years. It was simply to
have our paper circulating medium based upon real
estate, instead of gold and silver. The specie basis,
said he, a like an ash hopper standing on the little
end no basis no foundation ten dollars in circu
lation based on one, (perhaps -nothing.) and that one
a little scrap of metal that was neither food, raiment,
or shelter. The land basis was the ash-hopper stand
ing on the big end, like a pyramid no panic could
overturn it. He had it arranged so as to bo sclf-reg-ulating
as to volume, and largely beyond tho control
of those enemies to their race those human vultures
who are tbe authors of more misery than war, pes
tilence, aud famine and w ho, for a dozen years, have
fattened and gloated over the wretchedness they
caused and are causing in our lamb Mr. Grable had
corresponded with philanthropists, and his theories

FRO.TI THE OTHER SIDE.
Mb. Editob : I notice, in the last week's Chief, a
statement by S. K. (Shepherd, which needs correction
very badly. When father first took sick, he did not
think that his vitality was exhausted, and that he
wonld not recover, for he did not want to send for a
doctor; he said he would lie well in a few days. He
spoke of getting well not two weeks beforo his death.
Father did not send for S. R. Shepherd, to talk abont
final affairs ; in fact, he did not send for him at all.
Father had been sick four weeks before Mr. Shepherd
had been to see him once. Shepherd and wife had
been to St. Joseph, and on their return, stopped over
night with ns, instead of being "sent for," as S. K.
Shepherd said. Father hss said, for the last twenty
years, that he wanted his body dissected, after death,
and made a skeleton of; and he spoke of it to Mrs.
Shepherd. Shepherd opposed it very strongly. Father
had been complaining of something ailing his heart
and brain for the last six or eight years. Morphine
was the cause of father's wild actions, which the doc
tor gave him to make him rest at night. Those spells
lasted till the effects of the morphine had left him;
and when father was In that state of mind, he never
once spoke of having his body dissected. When he
spoke of having his body dissected, his mind was per
fectly clear. He never once said that Mr. Shepherd
should use his own judgment in the disposal of his
body. Only a day or two before his death, he asked
Ida if she thought mother and I would consent to
have Ids body dissected. She told him that we wonld,
certainly, consent to his last wishes, no difference
what they were. We could never be at ease, had we
not done so. My mother sent for Mr. Shepherd to
come and take fatbe'rVbody to the St. Joseph Medical
Hospital College, aa father told Mr. Shepherd that
ha wanted hinT to take'Jjm'ovrr'fbere, asTwas by
when father told him that; and now Mr. Shepherd
tries to make the public believe that it was not
father's wish, only ours. He must be very short of
memory. Father sent Jim Clark, then a hired hand
of ours, to St- Joseph with a note, asking the proprie
tors of the college if they would not receive his body
for dissection. That was three weeks before his
death. When Mr. Shepherd reached onr house,
mother did not say John had changed his mind that
is all false as father said that he wanted his body
dissected, and stuck to it to the last. No unlooked
for difficulty arose at all.. Jf ost of the folks were not
Irish Catholics, and they were not drunk. Not an
Irish Catholic was drunk. There were some from the
Bottom that were drunk. Not one person protested
against the contemplated outrage, as Mr. Shepherd
puts it, nor demanded that the body should be buried.
There was no dsnger of Mr. Shepherd being mobbed,
at alL Another great mistake. No one said any
thing against taking tbe body to St. Joseph, but Mr.
Shepherd, Mr. Eirkpatrirk, and Frank Straub. In
deed, we children are intelligent enough to know
truth from falsehood. .Tours, for truth and justice,

from its diseased condition to a healthy circulation.
Vscniai regulates the bowels, which is very important
in this complaint. One bottle of Vesetlae will giro re
lief! but to effect a pemauent cure.it must be taken
regularly, and may take several bottles, especially in
cases oflong standing. VEorrox is sold by sit Drug,
gists. Try it, and yqur verdict will be the same aa that
of thousands before you, who sav, "I never found so
much relief as from the use of VEGETINE," which is
composed exclusively of JSartt, Hoots, and HerU.
"TtGETOT." says a Boston physician, "has no equal
aa a blood purifier. Hearing of iu many wonderful cures,
after all other remedies had failed, I visited the labora
tory, and convinced myself of its genuine merit- It Is
Erersred from roots, barks and herbs, each of which is
ighly eflective, and they are compounded In such a
manner as to produce astonishing results."
NOTHING EQUAL TO IT.
