F.W. Peacock Hears
Brother Is Prisoner
Was Wounded And Carried Off Field
By Huns Had Been With Austra
lians V2 Years Other Brother
One Of 9 Survivors
P. W. Peacock, of f minene has just
received word from his family In Eng
land announcing the distressing news
that one of his two brothers in the
British army was wounded and cap
tured by the Germans on October 5.
This was Lt. John Peacock, who went
into the service 3V4 years ago with the
Australians and has been in service
continuously ever since.
He served first in Kgypt and then
on the Gallipoli peninsula. He had
been home on a furlough and had re
joined his battalion but two days
when his misfortune occurred.
While leading a charge he was seen
to fall, and although an effort was
made to rescue him the machine gun
fire of the Huns prevented. Later he
was seen to be picked up by Germans
and carried away on a stretcher. He
waved his hand as he was going, so
hope is felt that his injury is not ser
ious and that he may be homo again
by this time.
Lt. Peacock had been wounded sev
eral times and had been decorated for
bravery. His brother Arch, is also a
lieutenant, but with the Canadian
forces. He was a member of the
famous "Princess Pat's" and was one
of the 9 survivors of his company af
ter the terrific engagement early in
the war In which the Canadians were
all but wiped out. This brother was
wounded three times and has been
decorated twice.
Both young soldiers rose from the
ranks and have probably had as
steady and long continued fighting as
any men who took part in the war.
Mr. Peacock's last information was
written on October 24. He hopes daily
to receive further information.
Bad Vegetable Pest
Discovered On Maui
The California morning-glory, a
bind-weed which has probably come
to the Islands in shipments of hay or
grass seeds, threatens to become a
serious pest on Maui, according to
advices received recently by James
Lindsay, of Haiku territorial forester
for Maui, from C. S. Judd, chief forest
er in Honolulu.
The menace was first discovered
near Paia by Manager H. A. Baldwin,
of the Maui Agricultural Co., who
took prompt steps to eradicate it and
lt may be that he has succeeded as
Mr. Lindsay has been unable to locate
any specimens.
The plant, which was a well-known
pest in England more than a century
ago, is a twining vine which seems
to thrive by being cut down, and it
also grows from roots left in the
ground. It chokes other plants on
which it climbs for support. The only
sure way to destroy it is to dig it up
and burn it.
Mrs. Jane Mist Passes
Away After Long Illness
Mrs. Jane Mist, a kamaaina resident
of the Islands, and a sister of Alexand
er McKibbin and Mrs. S. H. Dowsett,
of Makawao, died at her home in Ho
nolulu last Saturday, afternoon. Nov
ember 30, after in illness of several
years. She was a native of Ireland,
and was in her 79th year at the time
of her death.
Mrs. Mist, was the daughter of the
late Robt McKibbin and came to the
Islands from Belfast, Ireland with her
family when she was 15 years of age.
She married tha late Capt. Henry
Wfcntworth Mist, a British naval offi
cer in 1863, and spent a number of
years following her marriage in Eng
land, Canada, and other places where
her husband was assigned for duty.
They returned to the Islands in 1872.
A number of children survive her.
The funeral, which was largely at
tended, took place last Sunday from
St. Andrews Cathedral.

WILSON TELLS PLANS
AND HOPES OF FUTURE
WASHINGTON, December 2 The President read his message
before the joint session of congress today. It was an eloquent tribute
for the fighters who won the war, and also for the industrial leaders
who gave the nation splendid services and for the laborers whose work
at home made victory possible.
The President expects a final peace treaty will be signed next spring.
He urged the adoption of Secretary Lane's plans to provide work at
home for returning soldiers through great reclamation projects; also
the development of public works projects.
He admits that the future of the railroads is a great problem, and
he has no solution to offer. He asks congress to help in framing legis
lation on the matter.
He urges a square deal for business when taxes are imposed, that
as ear'y as possible business concerns be informed what share of the
taxation burden they must bear so that they can figure on reconstruc
tion problems. The government's expenses will continue heavy during
demobilization. He recommended heavy taxation of war profits, and
urged America to help northern France and Belgium through priority
shipments and otherwise in the restoration of their shattered industrial
structure which makes them face immediate keen competition in the
world's markets, and arc thus heavily handicapped.
The President stated that he feels he must go to the peace con
ference because all belligernts have accepted the American principles
and the ideals which he annunciated, and they reasonably desire his
presence to assist in their interpretation and application. He feels that
to carry out ideals for which Americans fought and died is his first
duty, and he appreciates the heavy responsibility and earnestly asks
and hopes for the united support of congress in the delicate task. "I
am the servant of the nation," he said.
He promised to keep this country and congress fully in touch with
progress so as full co-operation may be possible, through cable and wire
less communication. Absolutely no censorship will be placed on peace
discussion.
Mr. Wilson praised women's splendid war work and said congress
should reward them by granting them equal political right of suffrage.
He expects an immediate revival of a great industrial development.
He has no definite program for internal reconstruction, but counts on
the native intelligence of the people and industrial leaders bringing
about readjustment satisfactorily much faster than legislation could do.
He takes it for granted that congress will continue its naval pro
gram undertaken before we entered the war.

functions, there is no sickness. B.
B. C. does that very thing builds
up your body and makes it stronger
than the ailments that assail it and
they are beaten and utterly routed,
and health is the result. That's

sick headaches, nervous depres
sions, sleepless nights, aenemic
and run-down condition, billious
ness, torpid liver, constipation,
kidney and bladder ailments give
way to an extended course or B. B.
C. even in cases of long standing
and the body vibrates with health.
The extraordinary merit of B. B. C.
is proved by the many prominent
local people who have testified to
that effect. B. B. C. is a bottled
