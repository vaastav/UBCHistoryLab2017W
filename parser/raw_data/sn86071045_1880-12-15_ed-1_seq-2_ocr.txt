HON. JOUN HAI.L has been re-ap
pointed Marshal of the United State.-
Courts for the Western District ofj
Pennsylvania.
Coi RT this week is engaged in the
trial of criminal cases, Judges Bredin
and Storey occupying the Bench. Pro
ceedings uext week.
MR. ROBERT LINCOLN, sou of the j
martyred President, received more
votes than any other candidate as a
Presidential Elector in Illinois.
THE revenue to the United States
derived from the tax on spirits and to
bacco amounted to about a hundred
millions of dollars during the past year.
MB. FBANKI.IN JAMISON, of Alleghe
ny township, wa £ appointed foreman
of the Grand Jnry Inst week instead of
Mr. Westerman, who became too ill to
attend Court.
FOR pensions, including the amount
paid for arrears of pensions under the
late law, there was paid during the
past fiscal year the large sum of nearly
fifty-seven millions o r dollars.
THE Republican Committee of Mont
gomery county met iu session last
•week and passed a resolution instruct
ing the Senator and members from
that county to vote for Mr Grow
for U. S. Senator. The delegation
from the county is one senator and five
members, making six additional votes
for Grow. His friends now claim his
election certain. He is undoubtedly
the popular favorite, taking the State
all over.
"FORTR&VENUE ONLY."
After the experience of the late elec
tion one would have supposed that the
tariff question was pretty well settled,
and that we would not soon have heard
again of the "for revenue only" princi
ple. But not so. On the very first day
of Congress last week a leading Demo
crat introduced a bill of that principle,
and declared it his intention to urge it
and make the Pennsylvania and all
other Democrats show their hands for
or against it. He declares it the true
Democratic doctrine and appears dis
posed to have it continued as an issue
in our politics. Of him it may be said
"whom the Gods wish to destroy they
first make mad."
PRESIDE TVT HAY ES.
In another place will be found a syn
opsis of President Hayes' late annual
message to Congress, together with ex
tract:; from the same on some interest
ing subjects. This is the last annual
message the President can deliver, and
he takes occasion to give what may be
regarded as a general review of the
policy of his administration. There is
no doubt that it has been one of singu
lar purity, honesty and fidelity to the
public interest, and will go down and
be recorded in history as such. Com
pared with the closing scenes of some
former administrations it stands out iu
striking contract. There are but one
or two questions dealt upon in his late
message that there exists any differ
ence of opinion upon. His civil service
ideas would seem to be impracticable
in this country where we have parties,
and where the successful party expect,
and, in one sense, have the right to fill
the offices. The object is good if it
could be enforced from the highest to
the lowest office. But to merely estab
lish it for minor places in the Govern
ment always seemed to ns of but little
public benefit.
The retirement of the legal tender
currency, or greenbacks, is another
question that the majority of his party
and of the country would likely differ
with him upon. Although issued as a
war measure, as he states, yet their
convenience and use are such that it
would difficult to see how we could
get along without them. Nothing bet
ter could lie substituted a paper money
and what is singular the President
points out no substitute for them. That
currency is firmly secured, of great con
venience and general use, and in our
opiuion should be maintained and con
tinued as the liest and safest paper
money we ever had and as an actual
necessity to the people.
DO THEY MEAN TROUBLE ?
We can hardi v believe that the Dem
ocrats in Congress mean trouble, by
calling up, on the Bret day of the meet
ing of that body last week, a resolu
tion relative to the counting of the
electoral votes next February. Yet it
looks as if something was intended,
from the effort made to force it through
on such short notice. It is true there
is an obscurity in the language of the
Constitution of the United States as to
KAO or how the electoral votes of the
different States shall "be counted."
They are "directed to the President of
the Senate," who, "in the presence of
the Senate and House shall open all
the certificates, and the votes shall
UMHI tie counted." Now it would seem
to be intended, and seem to be in ac
cordance with all our daily transactions
of life, that the person or officer to
whom any papers or documents are
"directed" is the person who has the
right to open them and make known
their contents. This would seem to
give the Vice President the power to
have those votes "counted " But, in
asmuch as they are required to be open
ed "in the presence of the Senate and
House," that would also seem as if
those two bodies had some power ami
rights as to the proper counting of the
votes. There wps no difficulty silica
jbe ORIGIN of the GOVERNMENT until tbt*J
election of 1870, four years ago, which
was- avoidtd by the creation, it will be
recollected, of the Electoral Coromis
n. Then there were double sets of
returns fri.m some of the States, which
threatened trouble. But now there are
uo fuch returns, as yet known. And
hence there would seem to be no reason
for the action now pressed in
Congress by the Democratic members j
thereof. The pending bill gives either
branch. Senate or House, the right to !
object to any return from any State. '
and prevent it from being "counted." i
This would certainly be dangerous aud i
unwise. Both Houses should concur
at least before t e vote of any State
was refused for any cause. But time
should be taken and the Constitution
either amended entirely, or a perfect ,
bill matured ar.d passed to remedy the
present uncertainty in the language of
the Constitution.
THE public debt is stili a billion, eight
hundred and eighty-six milllions of
; dollars. President Hayes speaks of it
in his late message to Congress as fol
lows :
"The debt of the United States, le»s
cash in the Treasury and exclusive of
accruing interest, attained its maximum
of 52,756,431,571.43 in August, 18C5,
and has since that time been reduced
to $1,886,019,504.65. Of the principal
debt, $108,758,100 has been paid since
March 1, 1877, effecting an annual sav
ing of interest of $6,107,593. The bur
den of interest has also been diminish
ed by the sale of bonds bearing a low
rate of interest, and the applica ion of
the proceeds to the redemption of bonds
bearing a higher rate. The annual sav
ing thus secured since March 1, 1877,
is *14,290,453 50.
Within a short period over six hun
drt d mil i ns of five and six per cent,
bonds will become redeemable. This
presents a very favorable opportunity
not only to further reduce the principal
of the debt, but also to reduce the rate
of interest on that which will remain
unpaid. I call the attention cf Con
gress to the views expressed on this
subject by th • Secretary of the Treasu
ry in his annual report, and recommend
prompt legislation, to enable the Treas
ury Department to complete the refund
ing of the debt which is about to ma
ture."
OCOD NEWS, IF TRUE.
The following from the Pittsburgh
Commercial Gazelle is good railroad
news, and we hope it may all soon
come to pass. The Baltimore and
Ohio road has for years been seeking
connections north, and if this effort suc
ceeds Butler county will he unanimous
in its favor. The Gazette says :
"The rumor that the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad Company was interest
ed in the combination .made by the
Pittsburgh, Titusville it Buffalo Rail
road with other corporations, to build a
direct line to Pittsburgh from the Ti
tusville system, receives corroboration,
from the fact that the Baltimore &
Ohio have had ax-orps of engineers for
nearly two months surveying a route
across the eastern part of Allegheny
county, from Nine Mile run, on the
Monongahela river, to Xeglev's run,
on the Allegheny river. At the latter
point the new railroad will bridge the
river and the Allegheny Valley Rail
road North of the Allegheny river
the road will run north from Sharps
burg an;l Pine Creek, and up Conuo
quenessing Creek The necessary con
necting road will be about forty miles
long, and will strike the New York,
Pennsylvania fi Ohio Railroad proba
bly at New Hope or Hilliard, in the
northern part of Butler county. Hil
liard is the eastern terminus of the
Shcnango and Allegheny division of
the New York, Pennsylvania Ac Ohio
Railroad, and from New Hope there is
almost an air line to Cleveland by the
Mahoning division. The line from
Nine Mile run to the Allegheny river
was run more than ten years ago, and
the surveyors have found m ny of the
old stakes which had i>een put in. It
is expected that the Baltimore <fc Ohio
Company will build the branch, but
not before spring. The matter will be
discussed at the annual meeting to be
held in this city to-day, and then the
Baltimore directors will make a person
al inspection of the proposed route.
PRESIDENT HAYES refers to the
transmission of power in our Govern
ment from one Administration to
another, as illustrating the beauty and
stability of our institutions :
The occurrence of the twenty-fourth
election of Chief .Magistrate has afford
ed another opportunity to the people
of the United States to exhibit to the
world a significant example of the
peaceful and safe transmission of the
power and authority of government
from the public servants whose terms
of office are about to expire to their
newly chosen successors. This exam
ple cannot fail to impress profoundly
thoughtful people of other countries
with the advantages which [Republican
institutions afford The immediate,
general and cheerful acquiescence of all
good citizens in the result of the elec
tion gives gratifying assura: ee to our
country, and to its friend* throughout
the world, that a govern merit based on
the free consent of an intelligent ami
patriotic people possesses elements '.-I
strength, stability and permanency not
found in any other form of govern
ment."
The following is his mode for the
suppression of polygamy :
It is the recognized duly and purpose
of the ]>eople of the United States to
suppress polygamy where it now exists
in onr Territories, and to prevent its
extension. Faithful and zealous efforts
have pecn made by the United States
authorities in Utah to enforce the laws
it. Kxperience has shown that
the legislation upon this subject, to be
effective, requires extensive modifica
tion and amendment. The longer ac
tion Is delayed the more difficult it will
be to accomplish what is desired.
Prompt and decided measures are
necessary. The Mormon sectarian or
ganization which upholds polygamy
has the whole power of making and
executing the local legislation of the
Territory. I>y its control of the grand
and petit juries it possesses large in
fluence over the administration of jus
tice. Kxereising, as the heads of this
sect do, the local political power of the
Territory, they are able to make effec
tive their hostility to the law of Con
gress on the subject of polygamy, au<J
iu fact, do pftrvcut its eufbrbemcut.
Qtifje ©itiseu: ta, ISStJ.
Polygamy will not be abolished if the
enforcement of the law depends on
those who practice ami upnold tie
crime. It can only be suppressed by
taking- away the political power of the
sect which encourages and sustains it.
The power of Congress to enact suit
able laws to protect the Territories is
ample. It is not a case for half-way
measures. The political power of the
Mormon sect is increasing; it controls j
now one of our wealthiest and most
populous Territories. It is extending ■
steadily into other Territories. Wher
ever it goes it establishes polygamy
and sectarian political power. The
sanctity ot marriage and the family
relation are the corner-stones ofj our
American society and civilization. Re
ligious liberty and the separation r»f j
Church and State are among the ele-j
mentary ideas of free institutions. To |
re-establish the interests and principles j
which polygamy and Mormonism have j
imperiled," and to fully reopen to intel- |
ligent and virtuous immigrants of all
creeds that part of our domain which
has been, iu a great degree, closed to
general immigration by intolerant and
immoral institutions, it is recommend
ed that the government of the Territory
of Utah be reorganized.
I recommend that Congress provide
for the government of Utah by a Uover
ncr and Judges, or Commissioners, ap
pointed by the President and confirm
ed by the Senate-a government analo
gous to the provisional government
established for the Territory northwest
ol the Ohio, by the ordinance of 1787.
If, however, it is deemed > est to con
tinue the existing form of local govern
ment, I recommend that the right to
vote, hold office and sit on juries in the
Territory of Utah, be confined to those
who neither practice nor uphold polyga
my. If thorough measures are adopt
ed, it is believed that within a few
years the evils which now afflict Utah
will be eradicated, and that this Terri
tory will in good time become one of
the most prosperous and attractive of
the new States of the Union."
A Synopsis of Tha President's Mes
sage.
In his message the President refer
to the late election, denouncing the
Southern States for fraudulently count
ing out the votes ot the negroes, thus
virtually disfranchising them. He asks
for the abolishment of sectional issues.
He speaks of the necessity of a general
system of education in the South,
urging that Congress shall make ap
propriations to this end and establish
Federal supervision over the expendi
ture of such grants as it may make.
In the South the means at the com
mand of the local and state authorities
are in many cases wholly inadequate
to furnish free instruction to all who
need it. Whatever the government
can fairly do to promote free popular
education ought to be done. Wherever
general education is found, peace,
virtue and social order prevhil, and
civil and religious liberty are secure.
lie reviews at some length the suc
cess which he believes has been attain
ed during his administration in improv
ing the tone ar.d efficiency of the civil
service. The danger of patronage, or
appointments for personal or partisan
considera ions, have been strengthened
by observation and experience in the
executive office, and 1 believe these
dangers threaten the stability of the
government. The reasons are impera
tive for the adoption of fixed rules for
the regulation of appointments, promo
tions, and removals, establishing a uni
form method, having exclusively in
view, in every instance, the attainment
of the best qualificat otis for the posi
tion in question. Such a method alone
is consistent with the equal rights of
all citizens, and the most economical
and efficient administration of the pub
lic business. In several of the depart
ments he says they have tried the com
petitive mode of appointment, and it
has wonderfully benefitted the service ;
so a method which has so approved
itself by experimental test at points
where such tests may be fairly consid
ered conclusive, should be extended to
all subordinate positions under the
government.
He recommends an annual appro
priation of $25,000 to pay the expenses
of a commission whose duty it shall be
to devi.-u a just system of competitive
examinations throughout the country
for applicants for the service, which
would relieve the president and con
gressmen greatly. The first step in
the reform of the civil service must be
a complete divorce between congress
and the executive 111 the matter of ap
pointments. The corrupting principle
that "to victors belong the spoils," is
inseparable from congressional patron
age as t he established rule and" practice
of parties in power.
The question of polygamy in Utah
has also a share of attention. He
heartily denounces the "crying evil,"
and asks for the abolishment of the ;
"crime."
Our foreign relations have been good.
He refers to the fisheries question, the
firing on Ann r can vessels in Cuban
waters, and says that these matters
are approaching a settlement The
President considers it as one of the
striking successes of his administra
tion that resumption has been accom- j
plitb'd and maintained, and the country I
brought out of thi- disasters following ]
the panic.
lie calls attention to the fact that J
the legislation ol the last congress in
regard to silver has failed to produce
tlje effect then predicted The United
.States produces more silv r than any
other country, and is dnucjjy jjjtffested
in maintaining it as one of the precious
metals.
He recommends the legislation for
organizing, arming and disciplining the
militia, and ask* for liberal appropria
tions for this purpose,
He recommends the completion of
the new war department building, and
the erection of a lire-proof building for
the army m -dical museum and library.
He commends to the attention of
congress the great services of the com
mander-in-chief of our armies during '
the war for the union, whose wise, firm
and pitriotic conduct did so luupU !<l
bring that momentous conflict to a
close. The legislation of the United
States cont ins many precedents for
the recognition of distinguished mili- ;
tary merit, authorizing rauk and emol
uments to Is; conferred for eminent
services to the country. A'» act of con
gress authorizing the appointment of u
captain-general of the army, with suit
able provisions relating to a compensa
tion, retirement and other details,
would, in my judgment, be altogether
fittimr and proper, and be warmly ap
proved by the country.
He recommends the establishment
of American linys of steamers to yurry
the TUails between our tfwa pWrts 'and j
those of Mexico, Central America,
Suit! America, and trans-Pacific coun
tries.
He leeoniaienda the attorney-gen
eral's suggestion for tiie establishment
of an immediate court of errors and ap
peals, j
He advises : '.f increase of schools
for Indian education, a> much g >od is j
accomplished thereby.
He recommends that provisions be
made for the sale of abandoned posts,
the proceeds to be applied to establish
ing new posts.
McCandless, Pa., Dec. G, r BO.
MESSRS EIHTORS :—In the Herald
(Butler) of December Ist, ISSO, we
find allusion to an address of ' Bob
lugersoll" on the South, Slavery, etc.,
The Herald says that Ingersoll
says : "The church taught the doctrine
that slavery was a divine institution"
and it founded this doctrine on the
teachings of the bible. Now in this
Ingersoll tells the truth. Doubtless
his father, as a minister, taught him
this doctrine, as many others did.
But does this prove that the church
taught that slavery was a divine insti
tution? By no means. But it does prove
that there were men in the church,
who in support of the Democratic par
ty preached in favor of slavery and
tried to support it from the bible.
Every preacher of this type was a
Democrat and every preacher so
preaching is an aider and abettor of
infidelity. Bob's logic is right—his
premises wrong. He calls Democra
tic preachers the church. They are
not. The Herald need not fear. No
taint will attach to Garfield from con
; tact with Ingersoll. Infidelity is not
1 diffusive among Republicans, as that
! ihinii called Democracy is among Dem
i ocrats. If 11. B. Maxwell had been
! here to enlighten the Democracy, then
I "my idol had not died." Oh! igno
| ranee, ignorance. Comeback my dear
: Maxwell—come ere infidelity hath
' ruined the Nation —confederacy. "Bob"
is orgauized ; "a great many preachers
are helping him on to the consumma
tion he so devoutly wishes," and this
"great many" are in the Democratic
fold. Men whose logic would every
where bind the poor in chains aud
shelter themselves under the "divine
right." MAC.

If the statements now flying over
the State are correct, that our Repub
lican "bosses" aie just now drawing
tbe lines so as to compass the defeat
of Mr. Grow by forcing Gov. Iloyt
into the field against him, then that
would be about as glaring and grace
less piece of ingratitude as could well
be devised. II it had not been for the
advanced position taken by .Air Grow
two years ago, in favor of honest mon
ey,—a position up to that time our lead
ders had been too cowardly to as
sume—and which he maintained labor
iously and with signal ability, from
one end of tbe State to the other,

would not to-day have the honor of
attaching the title of Governor to his
name In view of the connection of

it would not be the best thing for the

The New York Tribune for ISBI.
TIIE LARGEST CIRCULATION AMONG
THE BEST PEOPLE.
During the past year The New York Tribune
reached tin; largest circulation it ever attained,
with the single exception of a short period in
theiiist Liocohi campaign It is a larger cir
culation, aud more widely distributed over the
whole country tiiiin :iny ever enjoyed by any
other ncw.-puper in the l T nite! >i;ites. This
may he taken as tiie verdict of the Amer
ican people on the Tribune'; pelittl force, its
fidelity to sound principles, mid its merits :t» a
newspaper.
For lS.sl, The Tribune will try to deserve
npially well of the public. What and how
much it did for the success of General Garfield
it is content to let earnest Republican!) tell. It
It now hopes to give to his Administration g
discriminating support as effeetive as its effort*
for his elcotion.
The Tribune will iabor for, and il confidenlly
ex;iect.s the incoming .Vdiiiinistration to pro
mote a free and fair MiU'ragc, S;>utii and North,
sound money, protection to Home Industry, ju
dicious liiieraiity iu Internal Improvements,
and ii Civil Service conducted on business prin
ciples, on the theory ol'elevating, not of ignor
ing or degrading jsilitica.
livery citi/'.n who helped to bring in this Ad
ministration should watch its course. The
events to be recorded in The Tribune for 1881
will therefore have u peculiar interest. The
year prourses liesidcs lo show whether the
South will still sacrifice everything to solidity;
and whether the Democratic party, after twenty
years of disloyalty and defeat, will dissolve or
reform. Abroad it »i|i show whether Kn.'lund
can ooin;>ose Ireland; whether the Itcpublic in
France, without the support of the leaders who
established it, can siund alone; whether the
Turk can long, r pollute Europe. In >eience it
promises such practical triumphs as the n-e of
electricity for gas, new modes of heating 1 , and
new forms of power in place of steam. In Lit
erature and Art, it « ll"-:rs the very (lower of o®r
nineteenth century development; in Itcligion,
a concentration ot force and union of organiza
tions on simpler creeds and better work.
