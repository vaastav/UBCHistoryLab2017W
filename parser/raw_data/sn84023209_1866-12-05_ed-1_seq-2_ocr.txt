The Message.
The annual message of President Jolineon,
given in full in this paper, "will he read 'with
cons'derable interest ; although this interest
has been mainly occasioned by the report?,
indubtriout-ly circulated by some newspapers
and corrr fp ndents, that the message would
manifest a disposition on the part of the
President to meet Cosgress half way in
harmonizing the differences which Lave ex
ited between the legislative end executive
departments of the government for the past
year. 1 be hopeful individuals who gave
credence to these prophecies, and who were
-ady to advise Conerefrt to meet the Presi-
dei.

and amity between them, will peruse

and elections in the states which have never
lost their organization, that the credentials
of those claiming seats in CongTees from the
rebellious states have any claims to be pre
sented in Congress ; and this is the very point
that the republicans, in Congress and out,
contest on the threshold of the inquiry. The
argument of the message is. therefore, a pe
titio principii, and begs the very question at
issue.
Nor does it help the President's vi-w to
quote resolutions passed in Congress in 161,
or declarations of any official at any time
during the rebellion ; for whatever they may
mean "they are of no binding force upon the
conscience cf anybody to-day. The resolu
tions of Congress adop ed in July 1861, and
set forth in this message, meant, if they
mean" arjthir?, that slave-y should not be
disturbed by the war ; yet slavery has been
since aloIished in spite of them. This Congress

The only rtmaining subjects in the mes
sage upon which there had been much spec
ulation, relate to Mexico and our relations
witu r ranee, t p" mn,
gixts us no facts which we were not in pos
session of liforc. Certainly the message
gives o adequate reason Tor the extraordinary
step of sending Lt. Gen. Sherman to Mexico,
although it hints at a possible difficulty with
France. We trust CongTess will thoroughly
ventilate the Mexican business, and will in
- eist that our government shall keep fiee fr m
an partieitation in the plunder of that peo
ple. The Alabama claims and the Fenians are
briifly alluded to, and the Fenians being a
body of political consequence in this country,
are -reated with great consideration. We

have received much more deferential treat

glad to believe that it was the production of
his ten. But it beais tue strongest mu-riwi
vid me of bcine the work ol some calmer
and more finely cultivated mind than John
eon's. Its tone ;s dignified, and its rhetoric
worthy a state parer ; though its recommen
dation that Congress admit members from
the Southern States, that being, certainly
in President Johnson's view of the duties of
each House, not one of the " Measures''
whose "consideration" the Constitution
makes it his duty to " recommend" to Con
gressis in the worst taste, and in the high
est degree impertinent.

In the Senate, Mr. Sumner attempted to call
op the bill granting suffrage to the colored
people of the District of Columbia, but it was
decided that according to the rules, it could
not be taken up until the sixth day of tbe
session. The Senate should act upon it at
the earliest possible mcment. Tbo people,
who have just pronounced so emphatically in
favor of Congress agiinst tbe President, ex
ptct that bill will te passed at once.

rebellion can only be inferred from the great
military activity in England. It has created
great excitueent among the Fenians in this
country.1 'Whatever merciful views the

treatment of blave-holdicg rebels, it is vigor

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. . .
i Fellow Citizens of the Stna't and House of
He resentatives :
! Aitcr a brief ir.tcrval lbs Congrccs of the
Umtei S at resumes its annual legislative
labors. An ail-wise ana mercllul rroviaenoe
has abated the pestilence which visited cur
shores, leaving is calamitous traces upon some
portions of our country. Peace, order, tran
quility, and civil au hority have been formally
aVc!au-d 'o c x sr throughout the whole cf the !
United States. In all of the S ates civil !
authority has superseded the coercion of arms,
and ttio pet-pie, by their voluntary action, are
meiniiinirg their government in full activity
and compltte operation. The enforcement ol
the ls.ws le no loogcr " obstructed ia any
etate by combinations too powerful to be sup
pressed by tho ordinary rcursa ot judicial
prece dings ;" und the animosities engendered
oy the war are rapidly yielding to the
beneficent iLtlujucfa of out free irstitutions,
and to ike kindly effect's of unrestricted social
n J commercial intercourre. An entire res
coratioc ct fraternal feeling must be the
oern est wish ot every patriotic heart j and
we will have accomplished our grandeet na
ional achievement, wbeji, forgetting the fud
events ot the pass, and remembering only
iheir instructive lessons, we resume our en
ward carter as a free, pr.jpperoue, and urjt'cd

- In the admission of Smatois and Represen

can bs no just ground of appfebectiian that
peisons who are disloyal will ba clothed with

happen when the Cor-titution and tha laws
are enforced by a vigilant and faithiul Con

heretofore exnsed, have undergone no
change ; but, on the contrary, their correct
nebs bas been cotibrmtd by rttiectiou and tune.
It the admission of loyal members to seatd iu
the respective fb. us a ol Congress was wise
and exjiedieut a jetir ago, ii is m itss wise
and expedient now. It ibis anomalous condi
tion is right now 1 do cut see that the
qutstion will be olianged by the eillux of

as they are, the right of represent itu n will
be no s.ronger the right ot exeitsion will be
no weaker.
The constitution of tbe United St.ites makes
it thy duty of the President to reccouiend to
th5 consideration of CocgrtFS such meas
ures as he shall judge necessary or expedient."
1 koi.w ol no measure more imperatively de
m;iicid by every cunsideratiun tf national

closely together as a nation, ard enable us to
show to the world tbe inbtrent and recupera

Congress has made liberal grant ' cf pablic
.and lo corporations, in aid of the construction
of railroads and other internal improvement.
Should this policy hereafter prevail, more stria
gent provisions will be required to secure a
faithful application of the fund. The title to
the land should not piss, by patent or other
wise, but remain in the Government and sub
ject to its cintrol until some portion of the
road his been actually built. Portions of ihem
might then, from time to time, bo eonveyed
to the corporation, but never in s greater ratio
to the whole quantity embraced by ths grant
thin the cimple'.ed pirts bear to tha entire
len?th of tha projected improvemeit. This
reatrxtioa would not operata to tha prejudice
of aay undetakiog conceived in good f itn snd
executed with reasonibla energy, an it is the set
tled practice to withdraw from market the lands
filling within the operation of such grants,
and tbui to exclude the inoeption of a suba -quent
adverse right. A breach of the condi
tions which Cngresi miy deem proper to im
pose should work, a forfeiture of claim to the
lands so withdrawn but unconveyed, and of title
is the laods conveyed which remain unsold.
Operations on the several lines of the Pacific
Raiiroad bave been prosecuted with unexampled
vigor and success. Should no unforeseen cause
of deity occur it is confidently anticipated that
ihu greit thoroughfire will be completed be
fore the expiration of the period designated by
Congress.

was received by the government, oaie wm tak
en to make known its dissent to the Emperor
of France.
1 cannot forego the hope tbat France will
reconsider the subject, ana adopt some resolu
tion in regard to the evacuation of Mexico,
whioh will conform as nearly as practicable
with the existing engagement, and thus meet
the just expectations of the United States.
The papers relating to the subject will be laid
before you. It is believed that, with the evac
uation of Mexico by the expeditionary lorces
no subject for serious differences between
France and tha Uuited States would remain.
The expressions of the Emperor and people of
France warrant a hope that the traditionary
friendship between the two countries might in
that cie be renewed and permanently restor
ed. A claim of a citixen of the United States for
indemnity for spoliations committed on the
high seas by the French authorities, in the ex
ercise of a beligerent power against Mexico
baa been met by the government of Francs
witb a proposition to deter settlement until a
mutual convention for the adjustment of all
claims of citizens and subjects of both coun
tries, arising out of the recent wars on this
Continent, shall be agreed upon by the two
countries. The suggestion is not deemed un
reasonable, bat it belongs to Congress to di
rect the manner in which claiais for indemnity
by foreigners, sa well as by citizens or the
United Scutes, sriaing out of tun late civil wa
ihail bi adjudicated and determined. 1 hive
no doubt that the subject of all such c.Uiu.i
will engage our af.en'.un at a c .venient and
proper time.
lt is a matter of regret that no considerable
advance has been made towards tin adjustment
j of th differences between the L'niteu Stales
and Great liritain. arising out ot the depreda
tions upon our national commerce and othtr
trespasses committed during our civil war, b)
British subjects, in violation ot international
law and treaty obligations. The de!ayt how
