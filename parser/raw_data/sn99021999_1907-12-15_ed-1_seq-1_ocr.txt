HLIl'.IN, Dec. H. (Special.) The topic
of the hour in Irish political circle Just
now il the propct of political unity,
which Is believed to be brighter than It
has been at any time for the last two or
three rear. The first move In the preaent
negotiation! waa made by William O'Brien,
who haa been out of the party fold for
aome time, and who declared publicly that
ha waa willing to meet Mr. Redmond and
Mr. Dillon In a conference to discuss a
plan of union. It at no suggested that Mr.
Hoaly, who haa been running a little party
of hla own, and Sir Thomaa Esmond and
Mr. Dolan, who were excommunicated be
cause they subscribed to the Sinn Fein
heresy, sltould be Invited. To this Mr.
Redmond has replied that he Is willing to
go Into such a conference, and he adds
that ho has reason to hope that It will be
held, and that the Irish party will preaent
an absolutely united front at the next
sessiqn of Parliament.
The negotiations have given rise to the
usual crop of rumors about ths terms of
agreement, and almost every newspaper In
Ireland has published Its own plan of a
settlement. None of these are correct, for
no plan has been even sketched out yet,
but I am In a position to state that all the
factions are agreed on two or three clauses
which must form part of the peace treaty.
One of these Is the continued leadership of
Mr. Redmond, for there Is no man In the
party of, equal skill as a parliamentarian,
or who Is fitted to conduct the delicate ne
gotiations with the English politicians
which must 'be undertaken by the Irish
leader.
Will PrMt Homo Hole'
The second Is that a genuine home rule
bill shall be pressed forward at the next
session, and If the liberal government can
not be Induced to take It p. It will be In
troduced and managed by the Irish party
themselves. . Another plank In the new
platform Is that while every effort must
be made to obtain genuine and complete
home rule, the party must not lose sight
of the need of Immediate legislation to
remedy ths economic and sovlal evils which
prevail In Ireland, and must be prepared
A accept and anprmrt any reasonable meas
ure of rrtetHmriSrW' offered by either of J
the Kngllsh parties, and that It must also
do all In Its power to encourage and sup
port the Industrial revival movement In
aufurated by the Sinn Felnersv
I am also, able' t state that the credit
for .the restoration of unity In t! Irish
party, tf It U restored, is due to the
strength gained by the Burn Fein movement
and the . defection to It, of men like Sir
Thomas Esmond. There can be little doubt
that some, of the Irish leaders had been ao
long at Weatmlnster ' and had become so
engroaaed In parliamentary affairs that they
had lost touch with the progress of events
and of opinion at home. The sudden growth
of Sinn Fein and lta threat to swallow the
party brought them to their sense and In.
dueed them to devote more attention to
what was going on at home than they had
done for years.
Cattle Drive fnjast. '
One immediate result of the reunion will
probahly be the abandonment of the policy
of cattle scattering which has already
been' condemned by many of the most
thoughtful men In the party, and In Irish
life. Only a few days ago the Most Rev.
Dr. Healy. archbishop of Tuara. at mass In
the cathedral, denounced the cattle drives
as unjust -and Immoral, and lamentable
folly. They were directed, he said, against
a class of men who were as good irishmen
as the cattle driver themselves, and only
served as a weapon to strengthen the de.
mand of the enemies of Ireland for the
revival of coercion.
One of the most fsmous boycotts of re
.cent year ha Just ended In victory
for the boyretters. A family named Brady
nve years age teok five evicted farms In
county Ieltrlm. Since the day they' took
ttie farms they have been rigidly boy
cotted. They have been guarded rrtght and
flay by a force ef pelloemen who lived on
the farm and they have been compelled to
get their supplies fron as far away as
nny miles, several times when they were
bringing heme their supplies their carts
have been overturned and the feod de
stroyed. A few days ago they gave up the
nght and surrendered their-farms to the
estate commissioner for division among
the people. The occasion wss celebrated
by bonfires all over the county.
Strike of the Doctors.
A remarkable situation which can only
be described a a strike of the doctors has
. arisen at Carrlck-on-Suir, because of the
recent decision of the local guardians to
Reduce the scale of fees paid to the med
ial officers at the workhouse and publl"
dispensary. The doctors refused to accept
this reduction, but went a step further
and, on tho theory thst ' the guardians
were acting as the elected representatives
of all the people.- they have determined
to raise their scale of fee for general
practice to a point that seems almost pro
hibitive They began by fixing their Tates
ror workhouse and dlspenaary work at
JXIi-etiii t.a.76 a week, respectively. In
private practice they refuse to accept less
hun lit 50 and mileage for a day consul
tation, or 115.78 and mileage for consulta-
lon at night, while their midwifery charce
a ill be liL!i. The guardian have so fsr
taken no action, but they threaten to break
the strike by Importing nounlon doctors
from England. It la doubtful, however. If
ny can be found, for the rules of the pro
fession are very strict on this aide of the
Atlantic, and the medical men have more
han once succeeded In bringing local eu-
naritiea to terms.
The Ormonde Hunt, which la one of the
argest hunts In Ireland, has been dls-
nded for the season because of the df
crmlned opposition to It displayed by the
eople of the Dunkerrln and Bhlnrone dls-
.rlcts. , Tne opposition arises from the fart
:hat two or three notorious landgrabbers
were among the membership, and the local
orancn or me I'nited Irt&h league served

H1GHTOWN, Scllly Islands, Dec. H.
The American seven-masted schooner
Thomas W. Lawson, the largest vessel of
lta class ever launched, was wrecked In
Broad sound during a fierce gale last
night. The captain waa rescued from a
rock and two sailor were picked up by
boatmen. Bo far as known these three
men are the only survivors.
The schooner turned turtle and Is now
floating bottom up. Three dead bodies
have been found off Annnt island, an un
inhabited lalet of the Scllly group. One sur
vivor, who was landed at St. Agnes by
the St. Agnes' lifeboat. Is only partly con
scious at this writing.
The schooner turned turtle and Is now
floating bottom up. Three dead bodle have
been found off Annet Island, an unin
habited Islet of the Scllly group. The ole
survivor, who had been landed at BU
Agne by the 6t. Agne lifeboat I only
partly conscious at this writing.
Signals of distress were heard at the
Bishop Rock lighthouse at 4 o'clock yes
terday afternoon. The lifeboats at once
ut out and found the Thomas W. Lawson
anchored In a dangerous position Just
north of Gunner Rock. Great seas were
running and the lifeboats, although they
stood by for several hours, were unable to
render assistance.
At the request of the captain of the
Lawson the St. Mary' lifeboat, tho masts
of which had been broken off In attempting
to rescue the crew of the schooner, put
back with the purpose of telegraphing for
a tug to come to the assistance of the Law
son. The St. Agnes lifeboat was left stand
ing by. A little later, however, this life
boat had to leave, a ono of It crew wa
dying of exposure, while the other were
almost completely exhausted.
Boat' Light Missed.
At about ten minute before S this morn
ing the lookout at the St. Agnes and
Bishop' Rock llghthouaea and the coast
guards missed the light of the Lawson at
the same time. and when a lifeboat re
turned to ths . seen oil floating on the
wave Indicated the disaster. A few mln.
ute later the Jifeni.s; found the
Lawson. bottom -up,
Searching In the vicinity : th. St.. Agnes'
Ilghtboat picked up a solitary survivor,
Oeorge Allen of London, anJ found three
dead bodle oft Annet 'Island. The eur
vlvor and tho dead were brought back to
Bt. . Agne - , .
The gale I still blowing fiercely and the
seas are running high. A doctor from St.
Mary'a has gone out In a lifeboat to render
assistance to other possible survivor.
Among the drowned I W. C. Hicks, a
Scllly pilot, -who managed to scramble on
board the lawson during one of the at
tempt of the St. Agne lifeboat to help
the lllfated ahlp. .
The search up to noon failed, to discover
any further survivors, and It now seem
to be eatabllahed that Allen 1 the only
member of the crew who did not lose his
life. The number of drowned Is said to be
eighteen. Allen was seriously Injured and
the doctor In attendance Is doubtful If he
will live out the day.
Story of Sarvlvar.
. From scrap of Information that have
been obtained from the semt-consclous
man. It seems that the Thomas W. Lawson
encountered prolonged bad weather and
lost all It boat on ths trip out from Phil
adelphia. It lighted the Scllly Islands .yes
terday afternoon, and, finding Itself In a
dangerous position, dropped both anchors,
the captain hoping that the weather would
moderate.
The captain thought It wis to send back
on of the lifeboats that came out to se
cure the assistance of a steam tug. The
St. , Agnes boat continued to stand by the J
training Kiiugnor unm tnf exnausiea con
dition of the crew made It absolutely neces
sary to seek the shelter of a harbor.
The vessel was battered by the waves,
finally tiynlng over.
Allen says that when ho last saw them,
the captain and mnte of the Lawson and
the pilot were lashed to the rigging.

The task of saving the live of the. crew
of the Phlnney Was extremely hasardous,

sea and they prepared at once to shoot "a
life line over the bark and bring the crew
ashore in a breeches buoy, Aa the bark
lay only about 100 feet from the beach
there wa a good chance of saving the
sailors In that way. " v '
The llfeaavers made several unsuccessful
attempts to shoot the life Una to the bark,
but owing to the gale the Lyle gun would
not throw the line so far as the wrecked
vessel Two tugs tried to reach the bark,
but failed, and the llfeaavers then tried
to reach the vessel In their pwer lifeboat.
Ten or twelve men are In the rigging of
the Phlnney, watrhlng the efforts of ths
llfesavers.
A wrecking tug vowing life asaat was

For hour Saturday th police captains
handed out advice over the talephonoa to
those anxious Inquirer i whd desired to
know what they could do Bunday when the.

lug law. To sum up the advlca of th cap
tains it was:
"Do as you please as you do In regard td
obeying every olher law."
Citizens attempted to get bills of excep
tion through, but the captains who did not
want to advise anyone, simply told thos
who had special reasons, that th "just and
beneficent luw Is no respector of persons;"
Grocers wanted to keep open a aide door,
others entered the plea that they sold milk
to a large number of people and felt th
should supply their customer on Sunday
as well as any other day.
"I am now supplying milk to families
where there are many sick babies," tale
phoned a north side grocer. '
"How many sick babies did you say jretS
were feeding?" ssked Captain Moatyn.
"Sixteen," replied the anxious) shot)
keeper. '
Feed the Babies.
"Well, you feed those sixteen babie thole
milk Bunday morning, but remember that
sick babies do not need cigars, sardine or
brick cheese and If we catch you selling
anything but milk for the sick babies, yon
come down"' replied the captain

The clerks will sort the mall and distribute
It, rendering unto Peter the mall that la

NEW ORDER FOR SANTA CLAUS
Letter of Children Tbrenak Mall
Will. He Sent to III
Agent.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 14.-In past years"
many communications have been received
by the Postomce department requesting
delivery of so-called 'Santa Claua letters'
to philanthropic societies and other la
various parts of the country, but th ra
quest have always been denied. Th de
partment, taking the stand that letter of
Importance would be classed with "Santa,
Claua letters'' through error, that It would
be exposing to private parties confidential
correspondence that the letters might con
tain valuable enclosures, and that such a
practice would not be in keeping with th
principle of th sanctity of the malls.
Now, however, l'ost master General Meyer
has adopted a more liboral attitude toward
the children, as Indicated by his action ofr
today in Issuing an order to postmasters
all over the country (to whom letters full
of trust and pleading are coming In such
numbers ' from the little ones) to let tb
people of their cities know through th
newspapers ti.at mall addressed to Santa
Claus will be delivered to any responsible
parties who will undertake to act as Santa
Claus' agents In the matter.
