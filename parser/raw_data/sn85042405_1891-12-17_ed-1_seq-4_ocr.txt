TUB population of North Dakota, as
given by tbe official report o? the census
department shows that as far as can be
determined there were 36,909 people in
this territory in 1880, and that ten
years later there were 182,719, an in­
crease of 145,810 residents, or 394.05 per
cent. The population is given in detail
by counties, townships, cities, wards
cities, towns and villages.

ed
In the state there are but eight cities
and villages having over 1,000 inhab­
itants. These are, in the order of their
population, as follows: Fargo, Grand
Forks, Jamestown, Bismarck, Grafton,
Wahpeton, Mandac and Valley City, un­
der village government.
The population of Fargo is given as
5,664, Grand Forks 4,979, Bismarck 2,186,
with the other cities ranging under 2,000.
The population of Stutsman county is
5.266, and of this Jamestown has more
than half within the city limits. There
is not another city in the state which
contains as many people in proportion
to the population of the county, as James­
town. All the other larger towns are
supported by well sottled communitus
around them. For instance, the popul
tion of Fargo is less than a third of th
of Cass county, and the ratio is still
greater between Grand Forks city atd
county. The last year may have changed
these figures somewhat in the interest of
the cities, but not materially.
From these census figures Jit will I
seen that in the eight towns there area
little over 20,000 people or about one
ninth of the population of the state. The
state of North Dakota is purely and
simply agricultural in its population.
Many of the residents of the towns and
cities are farmers and live on the pro­
ceeds of farming. The farming interests
of the state are the chief ones, and the
farmers have it within their power to
regulate their own affairs, if they will.
THE president's message is a business
man's document, plain, and straight to
the point. It reviews the immense
amount of work accomplished by the ad­
ministration, and condenses the results
into a showing that every citizen can be
proud of. The president modestly, yet
independently, suggests measures and
methods fr^m his own point of view.
He again declares his well-known opin­
ions on the silver question, advocates an
ocean mail subsidy, believes that the
present tariff is in nowise oppressive to
any class ot the people, aud that it is
creating new industries and assisting
those already in existence.
The circulation of money has been in­
creased by applying the large surplus
left in the treasury in 1889 in tbe re­
demption of securities, rather than let­
ting vast sums lie in national banks with­
out drawing interest. There have been
redeemed over two hundred and fifty
millions of United States bonds and a
reduction of interest of over eleven mil­
lions annually has been thereby effected
since March 1,1839.
The message shows a splendid condi­
tion of the country and especially em­
phasizes the wisdom of the business
management of the nation since Presi­
dent Harrison was elected.
AT a recent meeting of the Illinois
State Grange at Springfield, the crop
statistics presented in the address of the
grand master attracted the most atten­
tion. Among tbe facts set forth was that
during the last year the average price of
a bushel of wheat was 87 cents. The
total crop in the Btate was worth about.
$15,000,000 and the net profit upon the
crop was less than $2,000,000. The fig­
ures for the last thirty-two years show
that for fourteen years wheat raising in
Illinois was pursued at a profit, but for
tbe last eighteen years there had been an
actual loss. The farmers of the state are
paying interest amounting to 86,800,000
per annum on a mortgage indebtedness
of 8146,000.000, while the net profit on
farm products is only about 87,000,000.
This is significant for North Dakota
farmers. It means that the winter
wheat states are not going to cut the
fignre in the wheat production of the fu
tore that they have in the past. Land
is every where advancing in value. The
•oil of the middle states is rapidly wear­
ing out, and never can be replaced for
the profitable production of certain crops.
Wheat can be raised with profit in North
Dakota where it would be a loss in Illi­
nois. The North Dakota wheat farm is
all right.
TUG Lisbon Gazette was recently ex­
cluded from the mails of its navire city
because it sontained a notice of a church
fair drawing. This heinous offence was
construed by the postmaster, who is
publisher of the Lisbon Star, as suffi­
cient excuse to make a lot of trouble for
his ''esteemed contemporary." The

hundred miles west of the Red river,
found to be third in population. In
there were 393 people at "the crossing
and last year 2,296, again of 484.22
cent, the largest gain of any single com­
munity in the state. This without a
booru, a capital building, a government
land office, or any artificial stimulus. It
proves that Jamestown grows and pros­
person its own merits and demonstrates
that with the returning prosperity
in view, this city is to take a long
forward and become the undispiu
metropolis for the great grain and stock
growing region west of the Red river val­
ley, now practically undeveloped.
that he same matter
held illegal, was printed in the post­
master's own paper, the Star, which went
through the mails without interference.
There are a number of republican
postmasters publishing papers in the
state, who are now manifesting their
fidelity to republican principles by
loudly advocating the prohibition law as
a party measure, abusing prohibitionists
themselves, and denouncing all others as
spurious republicans who do not come
into that mongrel camp. The LiBlx.n
Star P. M. conn-sunder this class,—whose
great loyalty to the party requires the
advocacy of prohibition and a construc
tion of postoffloe regulations which
seems to indioate that the republicanism
of the P. M. is no purer, more elevated,
or patriotic than the publisher himself.
THAT masterful hypnotizer, Lawyer
Bill Erwin, has cleared another client
charged with murder. Ground, insanity.
There is some reason for this kind of an
acquittal when Sir Knight Erw demon­
strates it. But nine out of t6n acquittals
for insanity are clumsy and unrighteous
despoilations of justice and exhibitions
of credulity. In the case of the North
Dakota murderer Bamington, the public
does not believe the evidence shows hiui
to be insane, or even imbecile. Theoret­
ically every man who commits murder is
insane—charity for the humau animal
leans towards this conclusion—and scien
tifically it has some support. But
the
majority of murders are contemplated b\
men whose minds would have never been
questioned had they not done the deed
Remington, the slayer of the elevator
agent, ought to take the consequences of
bis action, and every man who has mur­
der lurking in his savage heart, ought to
be impressed with the fact that he
is alone responsible for the evil nature
born in him, and must alone take the
consequences of his criminal acts.
AN illustration of the building.anda
description of the new Northern Pacific
hotel at Winnipeg will be found else­
where in this issue. The structure is a
magnificent edifice, and speaks for the
enterprise and broad guage policy of the
company which has erected it. The citi­
zens of Winnipeg are justly proud of the
new hotel, and regard it as a handsome
earnest of what the Northern Pacific is
to do for that city and province.
The present management of the North­
ern Pacific, is in many respects, the
ablest and most satisfactory for so great
a system, of any railroad corporation in
tbe United States. In this connection
The Alert believes that the effects of the
company's energetic endeavors to popu­
late the unoccupied lands of North Da­
kota will be seen sooner than the public
now believes. One of the practical
phases of this effort is shown in the
radical change of policy whereby indi­
vidual shippers have been supplied with
cars to ship their own grain, this year,on
a equal footing with elevator and ware­
house owners.
As winter leisure grows apace, the
press of the Red river valley, as well as
elsewhere in the state is beginning to
formulate what the farmers think of the
present elevator system by which they
are yet largely compelled to market
grain. The opiuions are uniformly hos­
tile to the system. One farmer writing
to a Grand Forks paper, after denounc­
ing the injustice of the monopoly, says:
One man shipping from Inkster made
a profit of S156 on one car of wheat over
and above what he could have got for
tbe same wheat in Inkster. Several
other cars were suipped at profits that
agreeably surprised the shippers' and
made it clear to them why the elevator
men were millionaires. Now few who
can get cars, sell to the local buyers. In
spite of the efforts made by tbe railroad
to favor the elevators, nearly all the
shipping is done by the farmers and at
clear profit of from about 850 to 8156 on
each carload. Farmers it is time for you
to think hard.
And so it goes, all over the state, in
the Red, in the James, and in the Mis­
souri valleys. Always the same story
everywhere.
PRESIDENT HARRISON let the subject
of reciprocity alone, in his message, and
devoted himself to a full consideration
of the tariff. He estimated the relative
values of the two topics correctly. Reci.
procity is as yet largely a glittering de­
vice emanating from the fertile bran of
Blaine, and created chielfy for his politi­
cal purposes. It has an attractive sound,
but as yet, there has been little prac­
tical development in it, except to adver­
tise the secretary of state. The McKin
ley bill on tbe other hand has produced
abundant results in a short time, its ef­
fects are promptly and generally, seen,
and the people of the country are able to
know a good deal about the workings of
the law. It is a beneficial act. and Presi­
dent Harrison wisely gave it preference
in his message over the brilliantly illn
tuminated scheme of reciprocity w.th
few South American republics in con­
stant insurrection against any form of
government or any permanent enoour
agement of commercial progress.
THE memory of an old fashioned news­
paper reporter of the Twin cities has
been recently honored in an unusual way.
At the funeral there were people of all
classes—officials, private individuals, ac
quaiiitnn vs.friendsand fellow workmen—
who appeared to do honor to one who
was old fashioned in this: that, for thirty
years he had plodded along, in the ca­
pacity ot newsgatherer, and in his deal
ings with all kinds of men and womeu,
seeing their faults and frailties, having
their prejudices, selfishness and schemes
revealed to him daily, he never betrayed
or purposely wrovged one, or knowingly
took advantage of his position, to make a
point at the expense of any one who im­
posed a trust in him. He was a worthy
servant of the public and a golden scroll
of his character could adorn no fitter
niche than in the sanctum of each news­
paper for which Mart Williams worked.
MINNEAPOLIS millers have donated a
train load of Hour to the starviug peas­
antry of Russia. It is pleasant to read
why this has been done. The Tribune
explains:
In their own prosperity and abund
ance the Minneapolis millers have
not been blinded to the misfortunes of
others. They have deliberately made a
monetary sacrifice for the benefit of peo
pie in whom they have no particular in­
terest, and from whom they can derive
no particular gain. Mankind's philan
thropv can go no further than this.
It is well for all to know that a com­
mercial Elysium has been sidetracked at
Mirneapolis, and that spot of earth now
contains noble and illustrious members
of the human race whose hearts are
blockaded with humanity and whose
generosity radiates sunshine and Pills
bury's Best around the world like morn­
ing drum beats.
PRESIDENT HARRISON agrees with the
postmaster general that it is not just that
small cities of 5,000 people should get
the benefits of free delivery, while the
farmer who receives his mail at a neigh
boring town should not onlv have to
send for it, but pay a box rent or wait at
the window. The president does not
suggest any remedv for this, but recom­
mends that the money order and postal
note system be largely extended into tbe
smaller country offices.
In the conduct of the postoffice de­
partment, tbe people at large feel that an
active interest is being taken in their be­
half. The service has been improved at
many points, and continued progress is
promised. Notwithstanding the revenues
have increased over five million dollars,
next year's estimates show a surplus
of receipts over expenditures.
THE comments of the leading news­
papers throughout the country on tbe
president's message are, on the whole,
dignified approvals. A great newspaper
office cannot for an instant lose the con
sciousness of its individuality, and every
utterance on a widely discussed topic is
slanted in tbe direction of the "policy"
of the journal. The desire of the editor
to attract more attention to what he says
than what the president said, is protu­
berant in most of tbe comments of the
big dailies. In this something of the
t-ntb is sacrifice*!, ani tbe mat­
ter under discussion not clearly stated as
it is And the value of it is in what it is.
THE row over lignite coal rates from
Dickinson and Sims still goes merrily on.
Like Clevelands view of the tariff, it is
largely a private affair. The chief feat­
ure of public interest is the fact that tLe
Northern Pacific railroad willing to re­
duce the differential of 50 cents a ton,
between Dickinson f.nd Sims, to 25 cents
a ton although claiming that the
road is now transporting coal at less
rates than the law allows, and at a loss
to the company. The desire to build up
a large coal mining business west of tbe
Missouri IH evident on the part of tbe
rMorthern Pacific.
Tm whea', movement last week show­
ed another large decrease in receipts and
shipments over the preceding week. The
shipments a^ primary points were greatly
decreased and the exports were increased
indicating that while Europe is a steady
and heavy buyer at present fair prices,
the shrewd heads in this country see a
limit to what we can export and are be­
ginning to hold on to the grain for the
rise that must of necessity come when
the great bulk of this crop is out of tbe
producers hands.
MR. DONNELLY of Minnesota does not
believe that the independent party is all
broken up, and will never recuperate,
because the country has bad a big crop.
"It is an insult to th« intelligence of the
farmers to suppose that they are like
swine, ready to lie down as soon as they
are fed," savs the alliance leader. Mr.
Donnelly is correct. The alliance will
not win as a third party, but he who
thinks its influence in the elections of
the old irties will be slight, is keeping
poorly posted.
ACCORDING to Quinn of tbe Butte
Miner, tbe latest requirements for mem
bership in the Denny Hannafin Suicide
club are that a candidate must be willing
to carry a torch into a powder mill, and
walk into the top of an elevator shaft'
Since the distinguished president of tbe
club has broken his leg, there is no tel­
ling what frightful stipulations will next
be imposed upon candidates. It is all
the more ominous because there is to be
a senatorial election in North Dakota be­
fore long.
A WASHINGTON paper recently printed
the following thanksgiving fiction about
the North Dakota congressman:
"The Hon. M. N. Johnson, of North Da*
kota, is thankful that be is a lineal de
scendent of Thor, and his pioture hangs
on one side ot the 'Crucifixiou' in every
Norseman's home of the Northwest be­
sides that he is solid with Uncle Ben."
There are those, howevei, who declare
that the "solid with Uncle Ben" feature
is not a wild wierd romance. But a plain,
unvarnished reality.
IT was a significant partisan remark of
Speaker Crisp, in acknowledging his
election, that he would pledge himself to
work far the "real interests of the demo
cratic party." The idea of national legis­
lation did not out any figure in the mind
of tbe new speaker. His entire speech
of acceptance was an harangue about
"democratic principles." It bad nothing
in reference to the publio affairs that in­
terest all citizens and which tbe public
naturally looks for.
THE United States Senate, from "pre­
cedent," will in all likelihood give a Beat
for six years to Call of Florida, whose
election waB contested by tbe farmers of
his state almost to a man, and who was
not the choice of the people. Call is said
to have been friendly to nearly every
scheme that has required lobbying to get
through congress, for the last twelve
years. "Precedent," however, knows no
other law, in the senate chamber.
SENATOR CASEY has been given the
chairmanship of that railroad committee,
a very considerable conpliment for a
comparatively new member to receive.
People the northwest know what a
chairman of a railroad committee can do
for his constituents, in the matter of
shaping state legislation. It is the same
in national matters, only the leverage is
all the greater.
SOUTH DAKOTA as well as North Da­
kota has a citizen, who is
making a success at literary work.
He was given a public recaption at
Watertown tbe other night, and the tele­
graph describes tbe gentleman as "a lit­
erary geuius of pronounced ability." A
literary genius without pronounced abil
probably trots in the class as "one of
them literary fellers."
IT may come to pass that "Old Hutch"
is right—that speculators keep up pro­
duce and stock prices, instead of de­
pressing them. The "legitimate interest,"
known as millers and elevators, are
against wheat this year ae always, but
speculators have lost a great deal of
money, and it is said the Board of Trade
in Cnicago is a regular asylum for the
poor this year.
A FROM NENT democrat of a Red river
county is against Cleveland because
when president he was hostile to certain
pension legislation and had hired a sub
stitue in the war. Same democrat would
vote for filaine in preference to Cleve­
land, but whether because Blaine's war
record is more brilliant than Cleveland's,
deponent sayetb not.
THE New Rockford Transcript remarks
that in some parts of this great country
they boast of raising two crops in one
season, but North Dakota is the only
state in the Union where so much is
raised in one season that it requires the
work of two seasons to handle it.
THE Benson County News complains
that blind pigs are not molested at Min
newaukau or Oberon. The republican
officials are evidently taking their cues
from tbe Iowa election. Tbe North Da­
kota prohibitory law might as well be re­
pealed at once if it cannot be enforced
in small towns and villages.
TnE Turtle Mountain Star believes
that temperance men should grant pro­
hibitionists honesty of purpose and everv
aid in enforcing tbe law now on trial.
Other laws on the statute books, how­
ever, have no special champions, and do
not appear to need any.
IT is said that Senator Casey will be
given tbe chairmanship of the senate
railroad committee. This is a very im­
portant position, and shows that the sen­
ator has some powerful influences work­
ing in his behalf.
IN the selection of delegates to the re­
publican national convention, tbe party
managers of this state should include in
the delegation out and out prohibition
ists, and give them a fair show to be
beard.

The Pekin Gazette contains a curious
memorial from the viceroy of Canton re­
specting 102 7£-centimeter guns manu­
factured by Kruppon the order of Chang
Chihtung, the late viceroy of tbe prov­
ince. The viceroy says the guns are
excellent in every respect, but they do
not suit the fortifications for which they
were intended. The damp climate of
the province and the white ants, "which
eat anything and everything," would
destroy them the district is so hilly that
they could not be moved, the coast is
composed of wet sand, in which the
wheels would get fixed immediately the
guns are too long for the embankment
on which they were to be placed and
could not be turned around there are no
horses in the province to drag them, and
if there were there is no forage for them
finally, the horses in the adjacent prov­
inces are so smull that if they were im­
ported they could not drag such heavy
guns. The obstacles being so numerous
and insurmountable, the memorialist
asks that he may be allowed to transfer
the guns to his brother, Li Hung Chang,
for use in the north, payment to be made
for them when he can. Should he re­
ceive any money from his brother on
this account, the memorialist promises
to report the fact. The emperor author­
izes this course to be followed.
