IFF ICIAL CITY & COUNTY PAPER
A Chignon Horror ia Fulton County.
The Lewistowa (Fultoa county) Union
reports that the daughter of an acquaint
auoe, in the southern part of thai county,
lately tonod her bair comiujr out to an
unusual extent, and wai alto troubled with
cuutinuoua itching ou tha bavk pari of her
head. As a matter of course too youug
lady wore a chignon. Ivpon examination
of her acalp, beoeaih the chignon, it waa
found to be covered with smell black inaect
about the aiza ot a grain of wheat, which
had eaten into bar head and down her neck
in a moat frightful manner. Says the
Union : ,
Toia ' head gee" ia ma.de of sea moss,
aud it ii supposed to coo lain the eggs of aa
insect which were, incubated by the warmth
of the head.- The vermin were at last
removed, though not without considerable
trouble and pain. The ceie wus at first
reported to be critical, but lately we learn
that the lady ia recovering. She will how
ever, lose all the bair whioh grows on the
back part of ber head, but will no doubt,
consign to the flames the chignon. -A
si.uilar cast, near Fertnington, it report
ea as proving latai, tae truth ot which we
are unable to vouch for.
But the developetneott of the case meo
tioned ought to banish from society thit
unsightly fashion. Already a number of
ladies, hearing of this case, have consigned
to the Uamet their chignons, and do doubt
many others who wear them will do the
same thiug.
Baltimore gave a Democratio majority of

an intensely Radical journal, save the re
suit of the election proves "that the negro is
an element of weakness and not of strength''

the Radical papers in Indiana. In their oom

administration ha come to light in relation

intends that the loss must be borne by the
holders, altogether the offence was the
result of official negligence.

Reported Expressly for the Argoi.J
Toms Deo. 7. A proclamation has been
issued by the Committee of National Defence
sigued by Gam betta, Cremeinx and Glais
audressed as foliowt :
lolhe trencn J'eople : After sustaining
several reverses, Ueu. JJe falauine, com
mandiiig the Army ol the Loire, proposed
nis evacuation ot the city ot Orleans. As
oe had at the time at his disposal 200,000
able bodied men and nve hundred cannon
entrenched in a fortified camp, protected by
toe rmea guns ot the naval artillery, we
aaked him to attempt resistance aud to hold
Orleans against the enemy. This he, at
first, refused to attempt to Oo, asserting that
retreat was necessary, tie then intimated
thai be h d changed hit plana and wonld
carry out the defense. The advice was
encouraging and Gambetta thereupon left
tor Orleans upon a special train, with all
possible haste. The train was stopped on
ihe road by a heavy detatchmeot of
Prussians who fired upon it and compelled
retregrade movement on this engagement
Gambetta narrowly escaped capture, and
went to Blaia. The delegation at Toon
have received no further die
patches from General De Paldines
out allboaph tome ot his officers have
4ince learned of the evacuation of Orleans,
under a threat from the Proaaians that if
the city was not evacuated immediately it
would be bombarded.
The committee are uninformed as to the
tubseqnent movements of the army of the
Loire. "
The proclamation is considered by many
-is a charge of incapacity and treachery
against DePaldines.
Bkulin, Deo. 7. A dispatch from Ver
sailles dated Monday, announces that an
officer was tent from the King's headquar
ters on Monday morning, into Paris with a
letter to the Government, stating that the
city of Orleans had been captured by the
Prussians. That the army of the Loire had
oeen routed, and lost thirty guns and
several thousand prisoners were taken.
Gen. Ducrot is supposed to have been
killed in the retreat across the Mint.
Washington, Dec. 7. It is thought that
Admiral Porter's chances of being confirm
-d as full Admiral, have been greatly
damaged by his attempts to repudiate his
letter on Grant. There is a rumor that
more of the same sort will be brought to
light, by the late head of the Navy Depart
ment, who is interesting himself in the
matter. The parties explanation of his
scarlet letter, as published to day, is looked
upon by every body here, as a very weak
and unmanly affair, and as doing him more
harm than good.
As a political move a bill to provide for
the election of delegates to Congress from
the Indian Territory was introduced to day
by Senator Harlan. Its principal feature is
that delegate! are not to be elected by the
popular vote, but are to be chosen by a
council of delegates from the various tribes.
