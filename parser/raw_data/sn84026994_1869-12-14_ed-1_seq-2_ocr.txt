specie payments mean ?" asks one. "Simply that
the legal-tender act is unconstitutional, and the
Supreme Court has forced the recommendation,"
was the answer. "Let them decide as we know
they will decide, and where will we be ?" These
remarks occurred among the congressional
financiers of the Republican persuasion, and have
cast a gloom over those who have pet theories to

The Late Ex-Governor Picken*.
We need hardly invito the attention of oar
readers to the warm and graceful tribute to
the memory of the late Hon. Francis W.
Pickens, printed in another part of to-day's
NEWS. Arnon;' a people who had so often
recognized the worth and ability of Edge
field's honored son. and who, under his
leadership, inaugurated the most colossal
conflict of modern times, a memorial article
like this, from the pen of one of his dear
and trusted friends, will be welcomed with
sad but eager interest.
A Chapter of Railroad History.
Between the Anderson Intelligencer and
THE CUARL%TON NEWS there is an honest
difference of opinion. The Intelligencer,
with characteristic frankness, condemns this
paper for "having endeavored to make the
"question of Stute aid" to the Blue Ridge
Railroad "savor too much of politics," and
candidly avows its belief that the policy of
TOE NEWS in regard to that important rail?
road is "totally at variance with the true
" interests of the State." These views are
contained in a leading article which we re?
print this morning.
The Intelligencer is in error in assuming
that THE NEWS has endeavored to give a
political caste to the question of State aid to
the Blue Ridge Railroad. This' has been the
aim of no less a person than Governor Scott,
who has thoroughly reconstructed the board
of directors, not in the interests of the com?
pany, but in the interests of the Radical par?
ty. A publication of the names of the pres?
ent directors, side by side with the names of
the directors two years ago, would show
very clearly what the Radicals have done to?
ward giving the concern a political savor.
THE NEWS, on the other hand, has never
treated the Blue Ridge Railroad as anything
but a matter of money-a question of price
and value, cost and profit. When Governor
Scott sent to the Legislature a special mes?
sage in regard to the Blue Ridge Railroad,
this paper did not oppose the passage of a
bill authorizing the endorsement by the State
of $4,000,000 of Blue Ridge Railroad bonds.
The heart of tue up-country was set upon
this work ; for a quarter of a century it had
been the dream and hope of the seaboard.
And when it was stated that $4,000,000
would complete the road and that the work
could be done in one year, we were willing*
that the State should risk the millions whose
expenditure should pour into the bosom of
South Carolina the trade and riches of tho
West. We had no thought then, nor have
wc now, of raising a clamor against the
road, and when the Cincinnati Convention
met, uo journal was more earnest than THE
NEWS in endeavoring to secure the con?
struction of the Southern road from Cincin?
nati to Knoxville the terminus of the Blur;
Ridge lino. A more thorough investigation
of the scheme caused this paper to bc far
from sanguine in its estimate of the benefit
to be received by this State from her trans
montane railroad, but nothing was said to
chill the ardor of tneu of stronger faith.
This was tiia position of allairs when the
contract for completing the Blue Ridge Rail?
road was awardod to Crissvell ?t Co. That
bargain has not been justified and cannot
bc; bul what we have to deal with now is
the fact that the awarding of the contract
made it evident that tho road, wit'iout de?
pots, robing stock, and other equipment,
would cost $9,000,000, besides thc s.'J.OW,
001) already spent. Until the road was com?
pleted it could earn nothing, for thc country
through which it passes, after leaving Wal?
halla, is a mountainous waste. The road
could not be finished in less than two year?,
and the State would have had to provide for
the payment of interest on $9,000,000 of
bonds amounting at six per cent, to $510.
000 dollars a ywir-one half tiie whole
amount paid in State taxes iu lb'f.9. This
tiuancial view of the subject was enough to
compel THE NEWS to withhold its further
support of the road until thc State was in a
more prosperous condition But when, in
addition, there was the certait/y that the
road and the laying out of ni'-.a million dol?
lars would be controlled by JOVEKNOB SCOTT
and MAYOR PILLSBURY, i* became tito duty
of this paper to expose 'he huge job on all
occasions, and to attack it in and odt of
season. This was the least that we owed to
the people whom we represent.
At the time that the contract with Crissvell
?: Co. was made, the Intelligencer ar?
gued, as it argues no", that it mast have
been a marvellous pr per contract, or it
would not have been at "opted hy President
Harrison and the Executive Committee.
There is no forcii in this a.gunjctiL Govern?
or Scott and Mayor Pillsbury represent offi?
cially about seven-eighths of the stock of thc
road They can make and unmake directors
as they please. Mr. Harrison is president
it is true, but he lias no more real power
than is possessed by one of bis own cross
ties. All his tact and energy go for nothing
when pitted against the votes of Pillsbury
and Scott. We assume, therefore, that Mr.
Harri30u, with other directors, consented to
accept the Crissvell &, Co. contract in the
same way that be consented to the election
of a colored director at the meeting lately
held in Charleston. He could not prevent
tlie acceptance of the contract, or the elec?
tion of the colored man, and it did not suit
him to resign. It was easier to bow tlutn to
break. We are compelled to put the case in
this way, because it President Harrison
avows that he sustains the directors in all
that they have doue, and approves of tbeir
action in every important particular, it may
become the pleasure of the people to call upou
him-au 1 not u;on Mayor or Governor
-for an account of the momentous interests
committed to his care. How long Mr. Har?
rison, and other gentlemen similarly situated,
will remain in a position where they share
the responsibility and have no share of pow?
er, they alone can decide. If Mr. Harrison
has not changed his mind siuce lie wa3 last
in Charlestyn, he may be expected to sever
his connection with the company in a very
short time.
We turn now to Hie part played by Governor
Scott in the matter of Hie contract. The
Intelligencer says that "if Governor Scott
" made arrangements to obtain a nice little
"joh with these contractors, it is somewhat
" singular that he should be among the first
"to relinquish and advise a discontinuance
" of the contract." This is very poor preach?
ing. Governor Scott became a partner in
tho Blue Eidge Railroad Company in order
to make money. THE NEWS succeeded in
keeping down the price of State bonds, and
in making it doubtful whether the Legisla?
ture would cancel the $4,000,000 guarantee
and give a guarantee for S9.000.000 in its
stead. This and the tardiness of the con?
tractors made Scott believe that more money
could be made by ballooning State securi?
ties than by fighting the battles of Crissvell
?fc Co. Out of the Senate resolutions not to
graut State aid to railroads, the gold inter?
est bill, thc bill to fund the new bills of the
Bank of thc State, and thc bill requiring cer
taiu companies to deposit State bonds with
the Comptroller-General, Governor Scott
hopes to make more than he expected to
realize out of the Blue Ridge Ring. And
this brings us to the assertion made by the
Intelligencer that "itmay be true that the
" State officials were interested with the con
" tractors, but we respectfully submit that
" t/ie sequence to this contract Joes not fur
11 nish evidence to that effect." "We say that
it does furnish ample evidence, and that if
tlie beginning of the contract was only as
bad as ita end is, THE NEWS was fully justi?
fied in treating the whole transaction as a
swindle and cheat.
The last meeting of the Blue Ridge Rail?
road Company, held in Charleston, was not
open to the public-Scott and Pillsbury, by
proxy, represented the people and thc $3, -
000,000 spent upon the roath The first
news of the result of the meeting came from
Columbia. Two of the Charleston directors
had resigned, and one had been dropped,
and the Crissvell Sz Co. contract had boen
carefully discussed. Subsequently a meet?
ing of the directors was held in Columbia.
They sat with closed doors, and every mem?
ber was pledged to secrecy. The Intelligen?
cer, however, admits that "they agreed to
"pay seventy-five thousand dollars" to Criss
"vell<fc Co., who had done "about fifteen or
"twenty thousand dollars worth of work on
"the road." This is part of the truth, hut not
the whole truth. Is the Intelligencer aware
that the value of all the work done by Criss?
vell &, Co. on the Blue Ridge Railroad is set
down in the public prints at fifteen hundred
dollar* ? Has the Intelligencer heard that
the Attorney-General, consulted by the
Hoard, gave his opinion that Crissvell &, Co.
legally forfeited their contract and could
claim no damages ? Does the Intelligencer
know that, besides paying S7.'?,000 for work
which cost ouly 51500, the Board agreed to
settle with the sub-contractors T The truth
of this statement i.s not denied, and we say
that this la3t job, this settlement with the
contractors, is to the full as bad as the first.
This paying $75,000, where not a cent was
legally due, Ls the natural "sequence" of the
Crissvell & Co. contract, and does, if there
is anything in the reasoning of our contem?
porary, "furnish evidence*'that the orgina]
contract was corruptly and improperly
made.
And we desire the Intelligencer to under?
stand that there are oilier "nice little jobs"
connected with the Blue Railroad besides
thoae which this paper has already publish?
ed. Does our contemporary know how many
of the $4,000,000 bon is authorized to be
guaranteed have been delivered to the niue
Ridge Railroad Company, and how much it
cost to get them ? Ugly rumors upon thia
subject are flying thick and fast. And. per?
haps, the Intelligencer can inform tu au?
thoritatively whether ono of the signatures
necessary to nuilee the bonds negotiable was
very hard to obtain, and what was thc
amount (thousands or tens of thousands !
of the ollicial fee ? We know enough al?
ready of these schemes of plunder, but the
Intelligencer is not easily convinced. It
says that it will "heartily join THE NEWS in
''exposing rascality of every sort," and that it
can "never allow its prejudices to outweigh
"judgment for thc purpose of creating a sen?
sation." We now ask the Intelligencer to
join THE NEWS in unearthing the jobberies
of the IJIue Ridge Ring, and beg that it will
not allow its prejudices in favor of a great
public work to outweigh what is due to it?
self and to the State.
Hubbard.
Chief Constable Hubbard hos submitted
hU first (and we hope last) annual report of
thc State constabulary, in which he recom?
mends that the constabulary guard at Abbe?
ville and Edgclleld be increased to fifty men,
and that the same number of constables be
stationed in Chester, Newberry and Union.
The cost of sustaining the constabidaryjbrco
during the year Ls $31,492, thc tota! appro?
priation being ?12,000. To justify this ex?
travagant outlay, Constable Hubbard says:
'.Crimes of all kinds have been numerous
throughout the State, aud it has been almost
Impossible to effect the arrest of murderers
and other crimin?is, for the reason that they
have received aid at all times from their
friend-. In many Instances parses have been
made up to enable them to leave the Sut to.
Provisions have been furnished them while
lying secreted in the woods and swamps, and,
ia some cases, parties hare been regularly de?
tailed to remain with them and warn them of
the approach of officers of the law. Yet not?
withstanding tiiese difficulties, the force hus
succeeded in arresting a number of offenders,
as the table will ehow."
This is A very pretty story for thirty-one.
thousand dollars. The table spoken of by
Hubbard allowa tht .^lowing arreste:
"Recapitulation.-Bigamy, I; arson, 2; rape,
I; larceny, 107; disorderly conduct, 18; assault
and battery, 159; assault and battery with in?
tent to kill, G7; threats to kill, 10 ?robbery, 21;
highway robbery, 2; murder, 54; accessory to
murders, 7; abduction, S; bastardy, I; grand
larceny, 22; riotous conduct, 21; violation o;
iaw, 31; fraud, 2; gabbling, 3; burglary, '-.
Total, 53C."
No on: denies that a large number of por
soas have been arrested by the Stute police.
They can moke arrests .ns they did in Abbe?
ville and Sumter, Mnd run up the black list to
5000. But how tn .ny o: the persons whom
tlicy arrested were guilty of any crime? How
many of them were tried and convicted?
Until Constable Hubbard supplies this infor?
mation, his long roll of offenders may show
how much lie and his minions have done to
insult and wrong the innocent, but will not
tell the people what has been done to punish
the offender and make crime odious.
WE PBECT, this morning, reports of sales
of land in eleven counties of South Carolina,
on Monday last Trices generally were
fair, with an upward tendency, and in Abbe
ville, Sumter, Spartauburg anil Lancaster,
there was a decided advance in the selling
rates. At Georgetown, live tracts of land for
which Governor?"Allston paid S222.500, so'ld
for $42,700, and a large quantity of pine and
swamp sold at from 8 to 22 cents per acre.
IT WILL be seen by reference to the letter of
our Washington correspondent, that the bill
to pay Southern officials who could not take
the iron-clad oath is aiiain before Congress,
and will probably pass both Houses without
material opposition. The bill is just and right,
and none of the old talk about "test oaths"
and "rebellious sentiment" can well be
used against it at the present lime.
