Declaration of War on
Austria-Hungary.
Washington, Dec. 4. —President Wil
son In his message to congress today
declared emphatically for a peace bas
ed on generosity and justice after Ger
man autocracy “shall first be shown
the utter futility of its claims to
power or leadership In the modern
world.”
The message follows:
“Gentlemen of the Congress—Eight
months have elapsed since I last had
the honor of addressing you. They
have been months crowded with events
of Immense and grave significance for
us. I shall undertake to detail or even
to summarize these events. The prac
tical particulars of the part we have
played in them will be laid before you
in the reports of the executive depart
ments. I shall discuss only our pres
ent outlook upon these vast affairs,
our present duties, and the immediate
means of accomplishing the objects
we shall hold always in view.
“I shall not go back to debate the
causes of the war. The Intolerable
wrongs done and planned against us
by the sinister musters of Germany
have long since become too grossly
obvious and odious to every true Amer
ican to need to be rehearsed. But 1
shall ask you to consider again and
with a very grave scrutiny our objec
tives and the measures by which we
mean to attain them; for the purpose
of discussion here in this place Is ac
tion. and our action must move
■tralght towards definite ends.
Must Win the War.
“Our object is. of course, to win the
war; and we shall not slacken or suf
fer ourselves to be diverted until It is
won. But it is worth while asking and
answering the question: When shall
w consider the war won?
“From one point of view it is not
necessary to broach this fundamental
matter. Ido not doubt that the Amer
ican people know what the war is
about and what sort of an outcome
they will regard as a realization of
their purpose in it. Asa nation we
are united in spirit and intention. I
pay little heed to those who tell me
otherwise. I hear the voices of dis
sent —who does not? I hear the criti
cism and the clamour of the noisy,
thoughtless and troublesome. I also
see men here and there fling them
selves in impotent disloyalty against
the calm, indomitable power of the na
tion. I hear men debate peace who
understand neither its nature nor the
way in which we obtain it with uplift
ed eyes and unbroken spirits. But 1
known that none of these speaks for
the nation. They do not touch the
heart of anything. They may safely
be left to strut their uneasy hour and
be forgotten.
No Peace by Compromise.
“But from another point of view I
believe that it Is necessary to say
plainly what we here at the seat of ac
tion consider the war to be for and
what part we mean to p’ay in the set
tlement of its searching issues.
“We are the spokesmen of the Amer
ican people, and they have a right to
know whether their purpose is ours.
They desire peace by the overcoming
of evil, by the defeat once for all of
the sinister forces that interrupt
peace and render It impossible, and
they wish to know how closely our
thought runs with theirs, and what ac
tion we propose. They are impatient
with those who desire peace by any
sort of compromise—deeply and indig
nantly impatient—but they will be
equally impatient with us if we do not
make it plain to them what our ob
jectives are and what we are planning
for In seeking to make conquest of
peace by arms.
Menace Must Be Crushed.
*T believe that I speak for them
when I say two things: First, that
this intolerable thing of which the
masters of Germany have shown us
the ugly face, this menace of com
bined Intrigue and force which we now
see so clearly as the German power,
a Thing without conscience or honor
or capacity for covenanted peace, must
bo crushed and, if it is not utterly
brought to an end, at least shut out
from the friendly Intercourse of the
nations; and, second, when this Thing
and Its power are indeed defeated and
the ..time conies that we can dismiss
THE WATERTOWN NEWS
pence—when the German people have
spokesmen whose words we can be
lieve and when those spokesmen are
ready in the name of their people to
accept the common judgment of
the nations as to what shall hence
forth be the bases of law and of cov
enant for the life of the world —we
shall be willing and glad to pay the
full price for peace, and pay it un
grudgingly. We know what that price
will be. It will be full, impartial Jus
tice —justice done at every point and
to every nation that the final settle
ment must affect, our enemies as well
as our friends.
Final and Convincing Lessor.
“You catch with me, the voices of
humanity that are in the air. They
grow daily more audible, more articu
late, more persuasive, and they come
from the hearts of men everywhere.
They insist that the war shall not end
In vindictive action of any kind; that
no nation or people shall be robbed or
punished because the irresponsible
rulers of a single country have them
selves done deep and damnable wrong.
It Is this thought that has been ex
pressed in the formula ‘No annexa
tions, no contributions, no punitive in
demnities.’ Just because this crude
formula expresses the instinctive judg
ment as to right of plain men every
where, it has been made diligent use
of by the masters oS German intrigue
to lead the people of Russia astray—
and the people of every country then
agents could reach, in order that a
premature peace might be brought
about before autocracy has been taught
its final and convincing lesson, and
the people of the world put in control
of their own destinies.”
Right as the Arbiter.
“But the fact that a wrong use has
been made of a just idea is no reason
why a right use should not be made of
it. It ought to be brought under th*
patronage of its real friends. Let it be
said again that autocracy must first bt
shown the utter futility of its claims to
power or leadership in the modern
world. It is Impossible to apply any
standard of justice so long as such
forces are unchecked and undefeated
as the present masters of Germany
command. Not until this has been
done can Right he set up as arbiter
pud peacemaker among the nations.
But when that has been done —as, God
willing,’ it assuredly will be —we shall
at last be free to do an unprecedented
thing, and this the time to avow our
purpose to do it. We shall be free to
base peace on generosity and justice,
to the exclusion of all selfish claims to
advantage even on the part of the vic
tors.
To Win War Our Present Task.
“Let there be no misunderstanding.
Our present and immediate task is to
win the war, and nothing shall ttirn us
aside from it until it is accomplished.
Every power and resource we possess,
whether of men, of money, or of ma
terials. is being devoted arid will con
tinue to be devoted to that purpose
until it is achieved. Those who de
sire to bring peace about before that
purpose is achieved I counsel to carry
their advice elsewhere. We will not
entertain it. We shall regard the war
as won only when the German people
say to us, through properly accredited
representatives, that they are ready to
agree to a settlement based upon jus
tice and the reparation of the wrongs
their rulers have done. They have
done a wrong to Belgium which must
be repaired. They have established a
power over other lands and people than
their own —over the great empire of
Austria-Hungary, other hitherto free
Balkan states, over Turkey, and within
Asia —which must be relinquished.
Must End German Autocracy.
“Germany’s success by skill, by in
dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise,
we did not grudge or oppose, but ad
mired, rather. She had built up for
herself a real empire of trade and in
fluence, secured by the peace of the
world. We were content to abide the
rivalries of manufacture, science and
commerce that were involved for us in
her success and stand or fall as we
had or did not have the brains and the
in.tlative to surpass her. But at the
moment when she had conspicuously
won her triumphs of peace she threw
them away, to establish in their stead
what the world will no longer permit
to be established, military and political
domination by arms, by which to oust
where she could not excel the rivals
she most feared and hated. The peace
we make must remedy that wrong. It
must deliver the once fair lands and
happy peoples of Belgium and north
ern France from the Prussian conquest
and the Prussian menace, but it must
also deliver the peoples of Austria-
Hungary, the peoples of the Balkans,
and the peoples of Turkey, alike in
Europe and in Asia, from the impudent
and alien dominion of the Prussian
military and commercial autocracy.
To Manage Their Own Affairs.
“We owe it, however, to ourselves to
say that we do not wish In any way to
impair or to re-arrange the Austro-
Hungarian empire. It is no affair of
ours what they do with their own life,
either industrially or politically. We
do not purpose or desire to dictate to
them In any way. We only desire to
see that their affairs are left In their
own hands, in all matters, great or
small. We shall hope to secure for the
peoples of the Balkan peninsula and
for the people of the Turkish empire
the right and opportunity to make
their own lives safe; their own for
tunes secure aaalnst oppression or io-

justice arid free from the dictation'/ of
foreign courts or parties.
“And our attitude and purpose with
regard to Germany herself are of a
like kind. We intend no wrong against
the German empire; no interference
with her internal affairs. We should
deem either the one or the other ab
solutely unjustifiable, absolutely con
trary to the principles we have pro
fessed to live by and to hold raosi
sacred throughout our life as a na
tlon.
German People Deceived.
“The people of Germany are being
told by the men whom they now per
mit to deceive them and to act as their
masters that they are fighting for the
very life and existence of their em
pire; a war of desperate self-defense
against deliberate aggression. Nothing
could be more grossly or wanton! v
false, and we must seek by the ut-'
most openness and candor as to our
real*aims to convince them of its false
ness. We are in fact fighting for their
emancipation from fear, along with
our own —from the fear as well as
from the fact of unjust attack by
neighbors or rivals or schemers after
world empire. No one Is threaten
ing the existence of or the indepen
dence or the peaceful enterprise of
th German empire.
Not Again to Be Trusted.
“The worst that can happen to the
German people is this, that Jf they
should still, after the war is over,
continue to be obligated to live under
ambitious and intriguing masters in
terested to disturb the peace of the
world, men or classes of men whom the
other peoples of the world could not
trust, It might be impossible to admit
them to the partnership of nations
which must henceforth guarantee the
world’s peace. That partnership must
be a partnership of peoples, not a mere
partnership of governments. It might
be Impossible, also, in such untoward
circumstances, to admit Germany to
the free economic intercourse which
must inevitably spring out of the other
partnerships of a real peace. But
there would be no aggression In that;
and such a situation, Inevitable be
cause of distrust, would in the very
nature of things sooner or later cure
itself, by processes which would as
suredly set In.
Wrongs Must Be Righted.
“The wrongs, the very deep wrongs,
committed In this war will have to be
righted. That of course. But they
cannot and must not be righted by the
commission of similar wrongs against
Germany and her allies.
“The world will not permit the com
mission of similar wrongs as a means
of reparation and settlement. States
men must by this time have learned
that the opinion of the world is every
where wide awake and fully compre
hends the Issues involved. No repre
sentative of any self-governed nation
will dare disregard it by attempting
any such covenants of selfishness and
compromise as were entered Into at the
congress of Vienna. The thought of
the plain people here and everywhere
throughout the world, the people wh
enjoy no privilege and have very sim
ple and unsophisticated standards of
right and wrong, is the air all govern
ments must henceforth breathe if they
would live. It is in the full disclos
ing light of that thought that all poli
cies must be conceived and executed in
this raid-day hour of the world’s life.
People Have No Say.
“German rulers have been able to up
set the peace of the world only because
the German people were not suffered
under their tutelage to share the com
radeship of the other peoples of the
world either in thought or in purpose.
They were allowed to have no opinion
of their own which might be set up as
a rule of conduct for those who exer
cised authority over them. But the
congress that concludes this war will
feel the full strength of the tides that
run now in the hearts and consciences
of freedom everywhere. Its conclu
sions win. run with these tides.
WATERTOWN, WISCONSIN, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1917.
“All these things have been true
from the very beginning of this stu
pendous war; and I cannot help think
ing that If they had been made plain
at the very outset the sympathy and
enthusiasm of the Russian people
might have been once for all enlisted
on the side of the allies, suspicion and
distrust swept away, and a real and
lasting union of purpose effected. Had
they believed these things at the very
moment of their revolution and had
they been confirmed In that belief
since, the sad reverses which have re
cently marked the progress of their
affairs towards an ordered and stable
government of freemen might have
been avoided.
“The Russian people have been
poisoned by the very same falsehoods
that have kept the German people In
the dark, and the poison has been ad
ministered by the very same hands.
The only possible antidote Is the truth.
It cannot he uttered too plainly or too
often.
Freedom of the Seas.
“From every point of view, there
fore, it has seemed to be my duty to
speak these declarations of purpose, to
add these specific interpretations to
what 1 took the liberty of saying to the
senate in January. Our entrance Into
the war has not altered our attitude
towards the settlement that must come
when it is over. When I said in Janu
ary that the nations of the world were
entitled not only to free pathways up
on the sea but also to assured and un
molested access to,those pathways I
was thinking, and I am thinking now,
not of the smaller and weaker nations
alone, which need our countenance and
support, but also of the great and pow
erful nations, and of our present ene
mies as well ns our present associates
in the war. I was thinking, and am
thinking now. of Austria herself,
among the rest, as well as of Serbia
and of Holand. Justice and equality
of rights can be had only at a great
price. We are seeking permanent, not
temporary, foundations for the peace
of the world and must seek this can
didly and fearlessly. As always, tjie
right will prove to b > expedient.
Declare War on Austria.
“What shall we do. then, to push
this great war of freedom and just to
its righteous conclusion? We must
clear away with a thorough hand all
impediments to success and we must
make every adjustment of law that
will facilitate the full and free use of
our whole capacity and force as a
fighting unit.
“One very embarrassing obstacle
that stands in our way Is that we are
at war with Germany hut not with her
allies. I. therefor>j|r earnestly rec
ommend that the congress Immediately
declare the United States in a state of
'var with Austria-Hungary. Does It
seem strange to you that this should
be the conclusion of the argument I
have just addressed to you? It Is not.
It Is in fact the inevitable logic of
what I have said. Austria-Hungary Is
for the time being not her own mis
tress, but simply the vassal of the
German government. We must face
the facts as they are and act upon
them without sentiment in this stern
business. The government of Austria-
Hungary is not acting upon its own
initiative or in ■‘sponse to the wishes
and feelings of its own peoples, but as
the instrument of another nation. We
must meet its force with our own and
regard the central powers as but one.
The war can be successfully conducted
in no other way.
As to Turkey and Bulgaria.
“The same logic would lead also to
a declaration of war against Turkey
and Bulgaria. They also are the tools
of Germany. But they are mere tools
and do not yet stand in the direct path
of our necessary action. We shall go
wherever the necessities of this war
carry us, but it seems to me that we
should go only where Immediate and
practical considerations land us and
not heed any others.
“The financial and military meas
ures which must be adopted will sug
gest themselves as the war and its un
dertakings develop, but I will take the
liberty of proposing to you certain
other acts of legislation which seem
to me to be needed for the support of
the war and for the release of our
whole fqrce and energy.
“It will be necessary to extend in
certain particulars the legislation of
the last session with regard to alien
enemies; and also necessary, I be
lieve, to create a very definite and
particular control over the entrance
and departure of all persons Into and
from the United States.
“Legislation should be enacted de
fining as a criminal offense every willful
violation of the presidential proclama
tions relating to alien enemies promul
gated under section 4067 of the Re
vised -Statutes and providing appropri
ate punishments; and women as well
as men, should be Included under the
terms of the acts placing restraints
upon alien enemies. It is likely that
•is time goes on many alien enemies
will be willing to be fed and housed
at the expense of the government In
the detention camps, and it would be
the purpose of legislation I have sug
gested to confine offenders among
them in penitentiaries and other sim
ilar Institutions where they could be
made to work as other criminals do.
Go Further in Fixing Prices.
“Recent experience has convinced
me that the congress must go further
In authorizing the government to set
limits to prices. The law of supply
and demand, I am sorry to say, has
been replaced by the law of unrestrain
ed selfishness. While we have elim
inated profiteering In several branches
of Industry, It still runs impudently
rampant in others. The farmers, for
example, complain with a great deal of
justice, that while the regulation of
food prices restricts their incomes, no
restraints are placed upon the prices

“It Is imperatively necessary that the

water power of the country and also

and yet economical development of

be centered, expenditures standardized

“Additional legislation may also be

the most efficient co-ordination and op

portation systems of the country; hut
to that I shall. If circumstances should
demand, call the attention of the con
gress upon another occasion.
Concentrate on Winning War.
“If I have overlooked anything that
ought to he done for the more effective
conduct of the war, your own counsels
will supply the omission. What I am
perfectly clear about is that in the
present session of the congress our
whole attention and energy should be
concentrated on the vigorous, rapid
and successful prosecution of the great
task of winning the war.
“We can do this with all the greater
zeal and enthusiasm because we know
that for us this as a war of high prin
ciple, debased by no selfish ambition
of conquest or spoliation; because we
know, and all the world knows, that
we have been forced into it to save the
very institutions we live under from
corruption and destruction. The pur
poses of the central powers strike
straight at the very heart of every
thing we believe In; their methods of
warfare outrage every principle of hu
manlty and of knightly honor; their
Intrigue has corrupted the very
thought and spirit of many of our
people; their sinister and secret diplo
macy has sought to take our very ter
ritory away from us and disrupt the
union of the states. Our safety would
be at an end, our honor forever sullied
and brought into contempt were we to
permit their triumph. They are strik
ing at the very existence of democracy
and liberty.
Cause Is Just and Holy.
“It Is because it Is for us a war of
high, disintei’ested purpose, in which
all the free peoples of the world are
banded together for the vindication of
right, a war for the preservation of our
nation, and of all that it has held dear
of principle and of purpose, that we
felt ourselves doubly constrained to
purpose for Its outcome only that
which is righteous and of irreproach
able intention, for our foes as well as
for our friends. The cause being 'just
and holy, the settlement must be of
like motive and quality. For this we
can fight, but for nothing less noble
or less worthy of our traditions. For
this cause we entered the war and for
this cause will we battle until the last
gun is fired.
“I have spoken plainly, because this
seems to me the time when it is most
necessary to speak plainly, in order
that all the world may know that even
GERMANS ARE FORCED
FROM FRENCH POSITIONS
IMPORTANT POINTS IN
WISON MESSAGE
One very embarrassing obstacle that
stands in our way is that we are at
war with Germany, but not with her
allies. I, therefore, very earnestly
recommend that the congress imme
diately declare the United States in
a state of war with Austria-Hun
gary.
Our present and immediate task is to
win the war and nothing shall turn
us aside from it until it is accom
plished.
Every power and every resource we
possess, whether of men, of money
or of materials, is being devoted and
will continue to be devoted to that
purpose until it is achieved.
Any peace that America makes must
not only deliver the people and the
lands of Belgium and northern
France from Prussian conquest, but
also must deliver the people of Aus
tria-Hungary, the Balkans and Tur
key from the impudent and Prussian
military and commercial autocracy.
First, this itnolerable thing of which
the masters of Germany have shown
us the ugly face, this menace of
combined intrigue and force which
we now see so clearly as the German
power, a thing without conscience or
honor or capacity for covenanted
peace, must be crushed.
In the heat arid ardor of the struggle
and when our whole thought Is of
carrying the war through to Its end
we have not forgotten any ideal or
principle for which the name of Amer
ica has been held in honor among the
nations and for which it has been our
glory to contend in the great genera
tions that went before us. A supreme
moment of history has come. The
eyes of the people have been opened,
and they see. The hand of God is laid
upon the nations. He will show them
favor, I devoutly believe, only if they
rise to the clear heights of his own
justice and mercy.”

vented the Germans from breaking

discounts the small gains which the

Germans were collected from the
eastern theater and various parts of
the German line in the west. At La
Vacquerie the enemy fought his way
through the town, and one party pene
trated for some hundred yards Into
British territory. This was the ex
treme gain.
The attacking forces secured a very
narrow strip of ground a little north
and south of La Vacquerie, but the
British still clung grimly to the high
ground north of this place.
The British commander voluntarily
pulled back his line to the west and
southwest of Masnieres to make it
firmer. Tuesday morning the British
li/ie was near the western part of Mar

a small triangular piece of territory,
therefore, has been sacrificed by the
British. Since eight o’clock Monday
