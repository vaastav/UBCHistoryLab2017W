No one, of course, can save all he earns, but you

Washington, D. C.—Because the

Speaker Cannon himself opened the

first time in many years. Then the

it was ended, only fififteen were in

Washington, Dec. 0.—President
Wt'» annual message to congress
contained 40,000 words, and Is said to
be the longest document of Its kind
ever written. In It he reviews the
work of each of the administrative
departments beginning with the state
department. He devotee considerable
apace to the satisfactory settlement
of the fisheries dispute with England
through the medium of the Hague
Tribunal, and recounts both the his
tory of the fisheries dispute and the
establishment of the tribunal.
In connection with the state depart
neat he tells of the Important poli
tical happenings of the past twelve
months throughout the entire world,
and the action of this country In con
nection with them.
Tariff Negotiations.
Referring to the negotiation of new
tariff agreements President Taft
says:
"The new tariff law, In. Section J.
mum tariffs of the United States,
whloh provisions came into effect on
April 1, 1910, Imposed upon us re
sponsibility of determining prior to
that date whether any undue discrim
ination existed against the United
States and its products In any coun
try of the world with which we sus
tained commercial relations.
"In tho case of several countries in
stances of apparent undue discrimina
tion against American commerce were
found to exist. These discriminations
were removed by negotiation. Prior
to April 1, 1910, when tlic maximum
tariff was to come into operation with
respect to Importations from all those
countries In whose favor no proclama
tion applying the minimum tariff
should be issued by the president, one
hundred and thirty-four such procla
mations were Issued.
"This series of proclamations em
braced the entir commercial world
and hence the minimum tariff of the
United States has been given univer
sal application, thus testifying to the
satisfactory character of our trade
relations with foreign countries.
"Marked advantages to the com
merce of the United States were ob
tained through these tariff settle
ments.
"The policy of broader and oleser
trade relations with the Dominion of
Canada which was Initiated In the ad
justment of the maximum and mini
mum provisions of the tariff act of
August. 1909, has proved mutually
beneficial, it Justifies further efforts
for the readjustment of the commer
dal relations of the two countries so
that their commerce may follow the
channels natural to contiguous coun
tries and be commensurate with the
•taady expansion of trade and Indus
try on both sldea of the boundary
Chip 8ub*idy.
Th« president urgea such action aa
It believes will increase Americas
trade abroad, and says:
"Another instrumentality indlspen

Washington, D. C.—Senator Cum

in the Senate. today two resolutions
providing for modllflcations of the

the whole tariff question, by declar

Washington, D. C.—Bills were in

Pierre, S. D.—The man, M. M. Ed
wards, who is wanted in Stanley
county on a charge of "rustling,"
and who escaped from a Brule coun
ty deputy by jumping from a buggy
an:l dodging out of sight, is shown
by the circumstances of his case to
have been a regular Fagin in his
methods of operation. Two sons of
-j.rs. Xellie Merrifield, a homesteader
nenr Cottonwood were used as his
victims. Edwards was teaching^
school, and one of the Merrifield
boys was living with the Edwards
family and going to school. This
boy about fifteen years old had been
at the j-uwards home some time
when his thirteen year old brother
.came to the place, and Edwards sent
them out with a stolen cow which
they managed to sell for $25 and
turned over $10 to Edwards as his
share. He then tooks the boys to the
ranch of Gilbert Dock, and had the
boys stand guard while he stole a
mare and colt. He had armed the
boys and instructed them to shoot in!
case anyone showed up. He sent the'
boys north with the stolen animals,
and the owner discovering the loss!
started to follow but lost the trail
and after several days learned that
the animals were in possession of thej
Merrifield boys, and he secured pos
session. The boys were arrested
and Edwards learn of this made a
quick get-away before the Stanley
county authorities could get to him,
leaving a wife and several small
children on the claim. The Stanley
county authorities are offering a re
ward of $50 for his capture, but as it
has been learned since he escaped
that it is not his first experience It
is not likely that be will be captured.

Mayor Hitchcock delivered the adi o?6
dress of welcome ro the
as
buttermakers, in vhicli he said some
encouraging things to the men en
gaged in the business, which, he de
clared, has been one of the means
to bring up the price of land from
a mighty low point to a very hign
one, his mind going back to the per
iod of some twenty years ago, when
land was worth about $5 per acre
and then resting at the present per'
lod when lanu Is selling for nearly
twenty times that much. The mayor
urged the men of the dairy interests
to study their work thoroughly and
to bring about the situation to se
cure the best possible health for the
citizens through their line of bust
ness.
P. A. Zollninn, of Alexandria, re
sponded to the address. He said
that South Dakota was once refer
red to and really was the range coun.
try, but the situation 1 snow differ

country. Speaking of the right kind
of cows for the dairy, air. Zollman
said that ne had recently been over
in Minnesota, where he found the
farmers were using the highest type
of cow for dairy purposes, and he be
lieved that if some of the dairymen
in this state could see the difference
of bringing up a good cow and try-
animal, that he wouid at
once get rid of the common cow. The

Radcliffe's statements were drawn
from actual expedience in the dally
test and he had no hesitancy in oUTer
in it as the best system for adoption
by the creamerymen.
W. Sly, of this city, presented
an interesting paper on "The Value
of Using a Starter." The buttermak
er believed with much faith in the
starter method oil:-the., commercial
type, for the reaao? that it ia posalble^®!
to improve the flavor of the butter
which is made .from all gradea of
cream. The commercial started has
been found, through his experience,
to have the Bame proportionate effect
on sour cream aa well aa aweet. The
ideas set forth by Mr. Sly were found
to be in harmony with the butters
makers. ss
"Record Keeping la Creamariea"
was discussed by Prof. Wm. White
of Brookings college. He said that
in his experience In the-butter busl-^
ness he found many creameries
throughout the state lacking in thia
one essential of the buaineas—rthat ot
keeping a record of the business, a
record which waa thorough' 1« de
tail.. Creameries which were ahort
on this detail were not ln the main
successes, and .without -it the manager
is at hi swits end to know how he is
coming out. Prof. White expressed
the idea that the manager should
keep a very accurate account of ev
erying pertaining to hia end of the
business and that the buttermaker
should be just as careful with his de
partment. This record should be
kept daily to make it uaeful and
helpful in the business^ and: with the
system in practice, both managers of
their respective departmenta will be
able to tell just what their atahding^
end of each day. With
was generally conceded: among the?
buttermakers that the details of Tec
ord keeping have not been kepi up"
the way the should,'-resulting in
losses wherfi proflta really should bo ,1
