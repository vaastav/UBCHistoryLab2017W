TAB SLAVERY SUBJECT.
For laog period Slavery in our country
ailed delicate subject" one, wmcn
MohJb Congress could touch upon (unless
k speech was in favor of the doctrines,
pltai, and policy of slaveholders) without
fciag denounced as a political fanatio of the
aott odious and dangerous 6ort, one,which
me religious Tract Societies would not al
low to be bo much as named in their publi
cations, one which the preacher of the
fospel must never discuss, even if his test
wsrt the one which the Saviour discoursed
pan in the Synagogue, (Luke !. 18.) with
out being fiercely condemned for "preaching
politics."
But all that has gone by. Willing or un
willing, congressmen, preachers, politicians,
esKyuts, lecturers, military and civil func
tionaries ol all grades, in snort, men oi all
classes and conditions irom one end of the
Nation to the other, are obliged to think on
it, to talk on it and to hear on it, and those
in authority are obliged to rote on it and to
act on it; mayez treatc cni ci :r.t vegtn
TZT.y. What ought to be done, what can be
done, what mutt bo done with Slavery in
tkis country, and how can it be done, aro
now mighty questions, which this nation is
forced to give answer on. If in a great meas
ure, they have been kept out of sight for the
last seventy-five years, they can not be kept
Out of sight any longer. Shutting our eyes
608 not help us. The terrible reality is there,
More us, and vrejnow it. The only patri
otio, sensible way, the only buuiane and
christian way, the only prudent and sano
Way is for as to examine dispassionately all
the bearings of the subject, to hear with pa
tirsioe the reasonings and propositions ct
otbers,and to weigh atl in the scales of truth
justice, humanity, and the eternal princi
ples of the law cf God ; and to be ready to
act not to shuffle the matter off, but to act
in such a way that we as individuals, may
alway have the testimony of a good con
science before God and men to sustain us,
now and hereafter, and as a Nation, may
stand up fearlessly' and without reproach,
before the eyes of the world for all aes to
come.
Speeches, essays in public journals, and
pamphlets are abundant on this subject; and
of the lost mentioned, we giro a reprint of
one of griat weight on the outside of our pa
per to-day. It is one which will bear read
ing many times. There uro no waste words
in it. It makes nq appeals to passion. It
is not written to create a "sensation." It
is for "thoughtful and patriotic men" to
read and think upon. It does not pretend
to exhaust the subject, nor any ono of it
parts ; but the reader who shall have thor
oughly mastered its positions, will find him
self able with far the greater advantage to
weigh, and apply whatever else on the
subject he may moct with.
The ship ilarvey Birch, destroyed by the
Nashville off the coast of England on the
19th of October, wus a fine American- built
ship of 1500 tons. When brought to by the
Nashville, her Captain, Nelson, was ordered
With his crew by Capt. Pegraui of the con
federate steamer.to come on board his vessel,
as he intended to burn tho Ilarvey Birch.
The men were allowed an hour or an hour
and a half for this purpose, and got pirt of
their things out. The men from the steamer
took most of the provisions, with the ship's
chronometer, barometer, and some of the
charts, permitting Capt. Nelson to retain
his own chronometer, but ho lost $1200 or
$1400 worth of personal effects.bookBharts,

vessel was Boon in flames from stem to stern

and set at liberty", with their personal effects.
On leaving the Nashville Capt. P'egram
old Oapt. Nelson that he hoped they would
not part bad friends', for what bad been done
was a simple act of retaliation on the North
era States for invading their territories, burn
ing their houses, ill treating their women,
and stealing their negroes; and they were
bound to retaliate on the property of tho
North m every way" they could.
Vol. Peyton, an ngent ol the Southern
Confederacy, and his wife, were onboard tho
Nashville.
T5e Captain stated that the Nashville had
but in to have her fop deck taken off and to
be fitted out as a vessel of war. The arrival
of the vessel there, under the circumstances,
and her landing prisoners of war, as they
are called, was looked upon by many as a
direct infraction of the Queen's proclamation
of ncut'falilyv
Of the general excitement in England in
respect to the Nashville, a letter from Lon
don to the New York Tunes says .
"The town has not yet recovered from tho
shack this event has caused, and is waiting:
with great anxiety to see its results. No
6ne doubts that unless tho British govern
ment sets rn an honorable and straightfor
ward manner, there will be an immediato
rupture. It is seldom tlnvt great battles,
where the destinies of nation were decided,
have caused rnoie exoitement or more alarm
among the phlegmatic people of this city
than the arrival of this wretched two gun,
half-manned pirate. It is the subject ol
discussion in every counting house, in every
hotel, on 'Change, and even among the few
fasbLnaole patrons, who, unable to follow
fee bounds still populate the billard rooms
Of the Travellers' and the conservative clubs.
Public opinion has not yet bad time to settle
n6n s course, and it is plain that it is "wai
ting for the direction which government
will give to its current. The press gives
oat only hollow murmurs, not daring as yet
to grapple with tne Bareness ui wjb cm.

the refBsal ct redress on their part, would be
followed by an immediate suspension of di

our possession ; that it was not as earily captured
as the Mary Yard sad Harper's Ferry. At far
back as the Sthtf January last, 1 00 limited with a
gentleman wnose position enabled nun to
strength of that fortress:, ud whose experience in
military matters enabled to form an opinion ai to
the number 01 men that would bo required w f
ture it. II represented it to be ono of the strong
est fortifications In the world, and expressed bis
doubts whether it could be taken, unlets assa-.o
by waler as well as by land, and simultaneously.
He stated emphatically and distinctly, that wit-.
the force then m the fortress, it woum do uiv.
to attempt its capture without a large force, thor
oughly equipped and well appointed. At no timo
previous to the secession of Virginia had wo a
military organization sufficient to justify an at
tempt to take it; ana events since mv
demonstrate very clearly that with our military
organization since, and now existing, it has not
been deemed prudent to make the attempt.
The abovo is from the message of Letcher
tho traitorous Governor of the traitorous
Stato of Virginia, to tho Senate and House
of Delegates, under date of Dec. 2.
Tho message breathes treason and war
from bccinn'iDK to end, and W3 advert to tho
rassazo abovo, only to show how thoroughly
its author was engaged in treasonable
schemes long before President Lincoln was
inaugurated
"While John Tyler and his
associates wero holding peace congresses, and
he especially was hoiror struck at hearing
that some of tbo guns of Fortress Monroe
vi ero pointed inland, and calling for explan-
aliens from President Buchanan, consulta
tions were going on among the traitorous F.
F. V.'b in authority as to the possibility of
their seizing that important post. Tho
world never saw a fouler nest of traitors
than were brooded and hatched in EaPtorn
Virginia.
"WHY LETTERS FAIL.
The portion of the Keport of tho Post
Master General, of most general interest, is
probably that which refers to tho occasional
fuluro of letters sent by mail. Mr. Blair
says:
"Tho result of successful investigation in
7,500 cases confirms tho past oxperienee of the
department that the failure of a letter to reach
its destination is,in the vast majority of instances,
the fault of the trrifer and stndtr. Out of tho
above 7,501 valuable dead letters, 3,995 wero di
rected to the wrong office; 407 were imperfectly
addressed; G12 were directed to transient persons;
357 to panics who had changed their residences;
S21 wero addressed to fictitious persons or firms;
83 were uncalled for; 10 vtilhuut any directions;
2,136 were not mailed for want of postage stamps;
79were mistent; and for the lailure of postmasters
to deliver 133 no satisfactory reason was eaigned.
The department, therefore, can justly ba neld
responsible for the non-delivery of but 212 of
the to letters.
In other words less than three per cent of
tbo failures of valuablo letters, was the fault
of tho Post Offioo Department. This per
ccntage is doubtless much less in the caso of
letters not containing valuable enclosures,
and which generally rule, it is reasonable to
Eupposc, aro directed by the writers with less
care than more important letters. The P.M
General could doubtless with all truth havo
added to theso suggestive figures, that in
about every caso of misdirection, the writer,
till confronted by his own handwriting on
the return of tho letter from the dead letter
office, Btoutly insisted that ho knew his letter
was properly directed.
The Report adds ;
It is worthy of remark that out of 76,769
letters before alluded to, originating ia the loyal
States and addrecscd to ridenU of duloyal States
10,100 could not be returned, cither because the
signature of tho writer was incomplete, or bo
caue the letter contained no clue to bis residence.
The experience of the Department shows tbat a
largo proportion of dooct-ti, letters written by
educated person;, and particularly Wumen, ire
deficient in ono or both of these respects',"

f VEXING vs. .MORNING PAPER'S.
The relatiro positions of tho morning ami cvo
ufng papers have changed jrrjatly during tho pres
ent war. A little while ago, the morning papers
were here, as they have always been iu London and
Paris, pre-eminently the ncur-pspers. They fur
niched their readers over their breakfast Ublo?,
nil the incidents of tho previous day snd night,
livening pajer merely repeated the informa
tion, with a few additional particulars gathered
in the local city news. But tince tho oponiztg ol
the war it has been different Tho fir t accounts
of nearly every important action and movement,
as we said the other day, have been given to the
public of iJew York by tie ovsning papers. Thus
the reports of the Great Bolbcl fight; of our suc
cesses in Western Virginia; sf the Hull ltun
defeat; of the liatteras Inlet affair, and most
iignal of all, of tho Port Hoyal victory and of the
capturo of ilason and Slidcll wero all receivid
in this city too late for the morning papers to
print, but early enough for the evening papers to
give lull particular?- To day we have another
pronf in the echoes of tho first guns from Pensaoola.
The considerations mentioned by the Post
have occurred to a number of other poop'.e.
We may bo allowed to add that tho Free
Press receives despatches regularly, by bo;h
tho American and Vermont and Boston
lines, up to 4 o'clock of each day. Its tele
graphic news is consequently cs Ictc, and in
1 most cases as full, i in fact the same as that
given by tho A'. Y. Evening Post and tho
New York and Boston evening papers gener
ally.
Ihe Buffalo Commercial eives an amusing
private letter received by a Buffilonian from
a Florida acquaintance, by the way of
Nassau, N. P. Tho following is an extract :
'Pray havo you any idea of our prices
here ? Pork fifty dollars per barrel, butter
filty cents per pound, lard forty cents. I
have paid theto prices this day ; soap also
thirtyJivo cento per pound, "and in short
pretty much everything else in the same
ratio except perhaps flour. But wo don't
Becm to mind it, except that it seems tefwe
it makes us hungry, lor I can swear we eat
more than we ever did in peaceable times.
We have raised this season abundant crops
of all kind6 of provisions in tha South. Tnis
is attributed to Providence ; but I under"
stand tbat he has done tho same thing for
our enemies. His position therefore is not
vry well defined. Although I am well
satisfied, if tho roal truth could be got at,
ho is on our side, still I am inclined to think
that tho making our crop for this year, he
left pretty much to our niggers. I mean to
say tbat xj it hadn't been Jot our niggers, J
don't think much oj a crop icon d haw been
made.
The Present's Position. The Wash
ington correspondent of the New York Eve
ning Post says- ;
"The Democrats cenerally profes3 to be
pleased witb th'e meaiage, and will support il
in and out of Congress. Ut course, suen
men as Vallandicrham and Ben Wood, who
are opposed to the war, will not favor any
thing coming trom a itepuDiicin president.
The passage in tho message which refers
to the t-laverv Question wih not produce any
division in Republican ranks, us the Presi
dent evidently refers the whole matter tj
Congress lor its careful consideration, Iu
private conversation the Irresiaent expresses
himselfus undecided upon tbo question.
lie says : 'This is a great question, and one
that I do not feel competent to settle. Let
Congress consider it, not passionately not
with reference to any former political issues
but seriously and prudently, and then give
me its advice either in tho lorm of a resolu
tion or a bill.' This is precisely what Con
gress will do, but tho question will not be
hastily settled.
The Panorama of Palestine and Scenes in
the life of Christ, drew a full house on Sa
turday evening. Tho paintings are much
better than the average ot such exhibitions,
and illustrating as they do, scenes and
events of universal interest, will be found to
well repay the trouble of going to see them
and the low price of admission. Tne accom
panying explanation! by Mr. Burnbam, are
abo aracfa above the usual parrot talk of

LETTER FROM NEWMTORK.
Nxw YoRX,'iec 6, 1861.
Main. Editors cf the Free Prut f
Ono effect of the war was brought to my notice
yesterday In going up Broadway. A year ago,
for the distance of a doten blocks above Canal Bt.
It seemed almost as If every other shop was a
sewing-machine agency. Machines of every kind,
singlo and doublo thread, lock-stitch, chain-stitch
and double chain-stitch at all prices frsm five
dollars to a hundred, might bo purchased within
the distance of a few steps. It is well known that
of really good and valuablo machine?, there are
but throe or four kinds: and the rebellion has
had the effect, doubtless entirely undesigned by
its authors, to show unmistakably which they are.
Tho single thread machines and "cheap" machines
general y, havo neatly all "gono under," their
signs havo disappeared, tbelr flaming advertise
ments vanished, and their wob of life ravelled out,
as soon as their own stitching. Curious to Icain
what effect toe present condition of tho country
has had upon the better class of machines, I went
into tho salesroom of the Wheeler If Wilson Co.,
and made some inquiries, the answers to which
mav interest von
At the outbreak of refccllion.of course all South
ern trade was at occo cut off. But thougn quuo a

pression of tho rebellion and tho dismemberment
of the rebel Confederacy. Nay, they would glad
and as clothing has tho peculiar faoulty of wear
ly havo famished any number of eenlng machines,
if they could havo been used effectually, to "sew
up" tho ports of tho rebels, "hem in" their
forces, and "gather" them within Undo Samuel's
strong clutch. Their trade in machines suffered
much, all over the country, as every other busi
ness did. County agoncics that had boon selling
ono or two a day, hardly sold ono a week. But
tho Sewing machine has becomo too much of a
housohold necessity to bo dispensed with. Tho
Lyons looms may ceaso their weaving, but the
cloths which tako the place of their costly fab
rics, still must bo fashioned and sewed. 0 tho
sale of tho Sewing Machines revives, and now one
hvndrtd a week go from this Broadway agemy
a! ono.
There is no loss without somo gain: tho war
makf work, as well as stops it. Tho equipment
of the vast army of tbo Union tho providing of
uniforms and under clothing, it is well known
taios the mills of tho 0 untry beyond their capac
ity to supply cloth which all the tailors, who
haven't enlisted, aro doing their utmost to make
up. Tho task would be a hopeless cne, but for
tho cid of mochiocrj'd Iron fingors. JIany a mich
ino is soing shoes, sewing co.it s, sewing panta
loon J, overcoats, shirts and drawers, which, but
for tho vast wants of tho army, would bo rusting
idly in its case. Oao firm, I was told, now com
pleting a contract for 150,000 suits of clothos in
this city, runs constantly in its largo workrooms,
more thin 100 0: tho Wheeler Ikon machines.
Thcro arc many such cases hero and in other cities,
ing ou, the demand is not likely to bo lessened
for somo time to oomc.
The fareiji trade of tho Wheeler 4 Wilson Co.
was never better. The Company havo not taken
out letters patent in foreign countries, but havo
geno on tho theory that tbo market can bo better
controlled through tho regular channels of trade
by dc7oting the oxpenccs of ncces ary litigation
to tho reduction of prieoj. And so, with no less
profit to themselves, they drive cut inferior mach
ines and imitation;, by tbo low cost of theirs, It
would require a very largo capital and years
of time to produce a machine from foreign manu
factories, that should equal in beauty and accu
racy of workmanship, those which the cnortnoug
factory ai Bridgeport, Conn., turns out by tho
hundred thousand. And a Wheeler S. Wilscn
Sewing Mschine of American mak , can be pur
chased in Paris for 10 or 12 dollar less than the
best French machine. From Liverpool the Com
pany have a standing order to furnish five hundred
machines a month, and letters from purchasers
among tho titled aristocracy of Great Britain, nbo
favor nothing American if they can holp it, aro
constantly rtceired, e.vproiog their satisfaction
with tbe new Yankee notion.
Among tho curiosities in the tvay of foroign
testimonials, Is 11 letter from the Tjcoon uf
Japan,, expreisiag his thank for a beau
tiful Sawing Machine, tent by Wheeler
A Wilsn Co., on tto Niagara, when she carried
homo the Japanese Ambassadors. It was accom
panied by a l-.tter from Mr. Ilarrh, tne American
Minister, saying that the machine delighted tho
women of tho Tycoon's household, who very
speedily learned to use it; anil that a number of
pitCdi cf velvet, richly figured silk, etc., etc.,
wero ordered to bo sent to the company, as pres
ents lo shew their appreciation cf it. When they
arrive they will be exhibited as a farther adorn
ment of tho Compaq's beautiful rooms on Broad
way. 'Under Boyal patronagb' it might be at first
supposed that a iargo and profitablo trado might ej
onco bo opened wth Japan; an J Mr. Harris says
a consignment of machines would bo speedily
sold. But there are few people so skilled in imi
ttion as the Japanese, and in six months they
would produco sewing machines in Euoh numbers
and at so low a price as to cut off effectually all
profitable sale of foreign made articles. It is
wonderful with what skill and accuracy thoy will
reprodaco anything of which they havo a pattern,
and already many of the articles sent out as cu
riosities from this country, are mde by them, in
every rcspo t equal to ibe originals; and steam
engines, lified cannon and other "modern im
provements" are ooming into use aaiong tbat cu
rious and heretofore isolated people.
No, Iho immense maculactory at Bridgeport
will not have to be enlarged to meet tho wants of
the Japin.ee market. It faot it will be a yeir or
two, probably, before the capacity of tbat great
factory, which covors four acres nd can produce
more than 500 machines a day, will bo fully
taxed. Bet what a contrast already to tho first
little shop in Watortown, that could build but ten
machines a week I

Fike in Essex. Monday morning,between
five and six, two barns and a shed in Essex,
opposito tho Drury place, owned by Thomas
Cjon, were consumed by fire , with a largo
quantity of hay, &c. The fire was caused
by leaving a lighted lamp on the floor,
when a colt knocked it over and broke
it, and scattered tho burning fluid about.
Leavenworth Block, Wo uro glad to
see this block filling up again. Mr. F. Smith
now occupies tho Eastern end with his
grain and feed store. Mr. J. Jewell, ol
Bichmund, has opened a store for the salo of
Furniture of his own manufacture, in one of
the spacious centre stores. While L. A
Edgell h s removed his Auction and Furni

Mr. Walton writes to Walton's Daily
Journal from Washington Dec. 4, as follows:
Last evening Bov. Wm. II. Lord returned to
this city from the Vermont Brigade, and gave a
very sorrowful account of tho sickness of troops.
About eleven hundred ol the brigade :.ro on tbo
sick list; and in ca-ts of malign .nt typhus fever
there have been many dnaths. Tbo Fourth and
Fifth regiments which were hurried off without
thorough preparation, and arrived at a b it time,
suffer the most. Still it is a remarkable fact that
even in these some companies havo almost en
tirely escaped disease, wnile othcts have greatly
suffered. Something then is duo to tho precau
tion and care of tffitorsand men. Ihe Second
regiment which has been lougest iu service, I am
told is compsratively veil; nd, mororer, that
col. Whiting is growing rapidly and strongly iu
the csteom ot tho legiment nii of the brigade.
Tho Macomb Regiment, now filling up
rapidly at Plattsburgh numbers in , Barracks
about COO men, and is under the command
of Col. James Fairman, of New York City.
The success in recruiting this regiment is
duo, in a great measure, to tho indciktigablo
and untiring exertions of Capt. Lot Chak-BEEUN.
PERSONAL,
Our townsman Mr. Miner B. Oatlin,
succeeds Mr. A. S. Dewey, ao treasurer ot
too Savings Bank. Mr. Catlin is a careful
and methodical business man, and will wor
thily fill the place of his worthy predecessor.
Major Isaac Lynde, of tho Second Infan
try, who, we aro sorry to say, is a Vermon-
tcr, has been dismissed from the service, for
surrendering Fort Fillmore, in New Mexico.
to an inferior forco of rebels, in July last.
Vice President Ilainlin has appointed
Senators Fesscnden and Trumbull, Regents
of tho Smithsonian Institution to fill tho
vacancies occasioned by tho death of Snnator
Douglas and tho treason of Mason.
Mrs. John C. Breckinridge is said to bo
holding receptions at Baltimore. A party
was lately given iu her honor, at which all
tho ladies woro badges of red and white
ribbon, and tho cake was frosted with tho
samo colors. Sho is represented as the
center of the female secession element of
Baltimore.
Mrs. Phebo II. Brown, tho author of that
ftdmirahlo hvran commcncinc, "I lovo to

October, nt Henry, 111., aged 7S. She has
left an enduring memorial 111 that sinsh
hymn.
A CoNSCitiriiON at tue South. While
the General Government is giving notice that
no more regiments aro wanted, the Southern
papers aro beginning to advocate a conscrip
tion. A late number of th Richmond En
quirer, observes that "the only way to meet
" tho North with any prospect of success, is
to raise a regular army by some means
" resembling the conscription of all other
" uations in the world except England and
America." It is reported that conscrip
tion for the rebel army has already begun in
Tennessee, and the fear of it has produced a
stampedo of able bodied Union men. In ono
week six hundred had left Nashville for East
Tennessee,
Bayard Taylor Cojiisc. Our Lecture
going public aro rejoicing in tho promiso of
an opportunity to hear Bayard Taylor, who
is announced to lccturo at the Town Hall on
Monday ovening next. Mr. Taylor has
lectured in Burlington several times hereto
fore, and always to largo and delighted
audiences. Hes theme this timo is " Ihe
American People, socially and politically,'"
and as there are few things which people
liko to hear about so well as themselves, we
anticipate a bigger crowd than ever.
Tue National Loan. We learn from Mr.
Vernon P. Noyes, tho agent for tho 7.30 per
cent, loan, that he has received instructions
to close his books, with an intimation that
ho will shortly be allowed to open now a 6ub
sription tor tho loan. The subscriptions re
ceived by him in Burlington amount to sixty
thousand dollars, which it is stated is more
than has been received at all tho other
agencies in tho State.
Orders havo been received at Charlcstown
Yard to rig tho old Vermont, which is to be
sent to Port Royal as a storeship. Workmen
will commence operations upon her in a day
or two. Sho was launched in 1847,and bad
been on the stocks uearly thirty years pre-
vious. Her masts and rigging wero nover
put up. She will havo twenty-four guns.-
Tho Vermont was originally intended to
carry 84 guns.
Money sent Home. Walton's Journal says
that Mr. Poland has returned from tho
army, bringing between $26,000 and $27,000
from tho 2d, 3d, -1th and 5th Regiments
which has been distributed among the several
Banks of the State, to be drawn by the fain
ilks and friends of the soldiers.
The several Regiments sent, in round num
bers, as follows: 2d. S7,0'K) : 3d, 7,000
4th, 5.000 ; 5th. $S,0U0. This must not be
regarded as in any manner indicating tho
cntira amount remitted by the several reel
ments, for it is known that wbolo companies
especially 111 tbo Zi and -ltls remitted
through officers or individuals who were re-
turning directly to their homes.
To show what companies do, when tho
officers take a direct personal interest in the
mutter, it ought to bo remarked that Uapt
Dudloy s Lompany, (b, tho oth Regiment
sent upwards of $1,200, and Capt. Benton's
(D, in tho samo regiment), sent nearly
1,000 ; and this when tbey received but
six weeks pay about 19 to a man.
Mr. Poland acknowledges tho uniform
and generous kindness and co-operation
which ho received from tho officers and
members of tho Regiments.
The Northern Frontier. Wo learn from
a letter in the Times that Ool. C. A. Waite,
U. S. A., has been placed in command of
the Military Posts on tho Northern Fron
tier. His department extends from Maine to
Michigan, and the different osts are immC'
diately to be occupied and put in a stato ot
defence. A regiment of Cavalry will bo
stationed at Detroit. A regiment of Artil
lery will bo located in divisions at Niagara,
Lockport and Sackett's Harbor, and Fort
Montgomery at Rouse's Point will be octu
pied by two companies of U. S. Infantry
within a fow days, tho works put in a stato
of defence, aud guns mounted as soon as
practicable.
Tue Cavalry. It has been found impos
siblo to movo the regiment before Saturday
next, when it is expected that it will leavo
without fail, and arrive in New York the
next day. Tho elegant stand of colors, pro
cured by tho citizens of Burlington for tho
Regiment, was presented on Thursday
afternoon, with appropriato ceremonies, acd
a "presentation Levee," was held at tho
American in tho evoniuj:.
Exchange or Prisoners. A despatch
from Boston states, 240 men, including nine
invalids and eleven officers, captured at liat
teras. and confined of late ia Boston harbor,
arc to ko sent to Fortress Monroe,and thenco
to Norfolk by a flag of truco, thcro to effect
an exchange of prisoners.
The Seventh Regiment. The recruiting

The Governor has selected Lieut. Geo. T.
Roberts, (1st Lieut, of tho Rutland Light
Guard) for the Colonel of the Regiment.
The Rutland Herald tays: "We believe in the
selection ot tho commanding officers of the
five Regiments of Vermont, now iu tho field,
tho Governor has made his appointments ex
clusively from tbo graduates of the Military
Academy. Col. Roberts has not the prestigo
of this military education. Like Scott,
Wool, and Fremont, be enters the army as a
civilian . and like the gallant Miller at tho
battlo Of Niagara, ho only proposes 4 to
try' to ' win his spurs and the laurels,' in
the coming conflict."
Senator Wilson's sharp stick troubles tho
sutlers, and Borne enterprising lawyers at
Washington hoping to profit by their fears
have issued a circular to them, in which
they warn them of their danger from Sen
ator Wilson's bil, and call for a contribu
tion of $25 from each sutler as a fund for
the protection of thoir interests. "With the
ciroular is a blank petition to Congress, to
bo 6igned by tho officers and privates of tho
1 ecimeut, announcing their satisfaction witn
tho arrangement. Twenty five dollars apiece
from tho sutlers would make up a very pretty
sum for tho lobby agents. Tho sutlers can
take care of themselves. Wo hope Congress
will take care of tho soldiers. Tho suction
force of every sutler to draw money out of
the soldiers' pockets is equal to at least a
hundred man power, compared with that of
any grocer at homo, and nineteen out of
twenty work it at the highest pressure possi.

In Washington, at sunset hour,
Ono red October day,
Alone a dyinj soldier lad
Upon his rode conch lay.
His boyish brow was cold and pale,
The humid dew of death
Clung to hie curl', and heavily
He drew each sobbing breath.
The fever glow had left his cheek.
Ilia beardless lip was white,
And on his eyes unheeded fell
The slowly purpling light.
His thoughts had wandered faraway
From Bwfft Potomio'j tide;
And in his dreams bo looked upon
A fairer, clearer tide.
He reamed again each homeland glade.
And sought each olden haunt:
Where h6 had straytd, a careless boy,
In mountain crowned Vermont.
His mother smiled again on him,
His sister's winsome glee,
Was mingled with tho laugh of one
His wild heart thrilled to sec.
A shy, sweet girl, with golden hair,
Tho village pet and pride;
Had promised when the war wa3 o'r,
"-'-Vide.
That h wouia no u.-
And mingled now amid his dreams
Strange music, sweet and wild ;
An angel fannod him with her wings,
And wore bis mother's smile.
Tho sunlight faded, softly closed
The red October day,
And dead upon his couch of straw,
Tha young Vermonter lay.
Ihey found hira with a peaceful smile
Upon his lips, and pressed
Within his hand, a golden curl,
Held closely to his breast.

ho exclaimed sharply: " What is that man doiDj,"
in the ranks with a bass drum?" He pointed at
me, but I hadn't any drum.
I overheard a spectator inquire cf the drill
sergeant one day:
"Do yon drill the whole of him at once ?"
"No," he returned ia aa awful whisper, "I
drill him by sqads V

"Sly ancient agriculturist,'' said I, sailing at

THE VERMONT
"Carlton," the army correspondeotei its
Boston Journal, saya
The Green Mountain State has an army or
its own across the Potomac. Tnera ars five
regiments from that State in one brigade,
commanded by Gen. Brooks, and forming the
second brigade of Gen. Smith's division. It
is a brigade worth visiting. The officers are
all indefatigable in their efforts to make their
regiments as good as any in the service.
There is, at the present time, a good deal of
sickness in tho brigado. I have not been
able to ascertain tho particular cause, but
have heard it attributed either to the water
used or to tha locality of tha camp. Ths
regiments have occupied tbeirprecent locality
since the advance was made, early in October,
and so long an occupation of one site is liabh
to induce disease. The Sanitary Corasiisaioa
is endeavoring to obtain all the statistical
information possible- relative to grocsd,
water, shade, shelter from wind, and tht ,
habits of the men, as bearing upon the causes '
of epidemics. It is possible that the cause of J
sickness in this brigade will ba found in th
soil. There are many cases of fevers. There
are not many aeatbs. The efficiency of ths
regiment, is somewhat impaired by so much
sickness, but it would make the heart of
Vennonters swell with pride to ride with m
through the camp and see tbo noble beans;
of the soldiers. We find genuine New Eng
land hospitality every where. Col. Hyde, of
the Third, is on the examining board ap-e
pointed to judge of the qualifications of ths
officers. lie is a young, efficient officer. Tb
captains and lieutenants who have not passei
an examination hold tho board in wholesoc!
reverence. Some young gentlemen resign ia
advance of tbo day of examination ; othan
meet the trial manfully. I am assured that
there has been much studying of the ana;
regulations, Scott's and Hardee's tactics, ani
a prompt attention to drill, on the part of tbi
officers sinco the board commenced its lawn
Col. Whiting, Col. Stoughton, Col. Small?
and Col. Lord, are spoken of in high terc!
by their brother officers.
It the timo ever arrives when this arsj
shall meet the enemy, I should like to be is
a position to see Gen. Brooks lead his brit
auo w its appointed piaco. xnere is awi y
