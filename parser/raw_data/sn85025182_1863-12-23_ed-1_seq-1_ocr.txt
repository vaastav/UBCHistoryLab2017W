GIVE H B1CI CUE OLD COSBASDER.
c Give u back oar old Commander,
Little Mac, the people's pride ;
Let the army and the nation
In 'heir choice be satisfied;
With McClellan as oar leader,
Let os strike the blow anew :
Give os back our old Commander
He will ee the battle through.
Chorus Give as back oar old commander.
Let him manage, let him plan
With McClellam as our leader,
We can wish no better man.
. Men may fiaht for fame and glory,
' Some may fight just "for the tin,"
Giro as then our noble leader,
Let as fight bat fight to win,
Uncle Sam has lots of mo.,ey.
Mighty stores and many men ;
Yet the people "think it funny1'
We should be repulsed again.
Chorus.
Pope he made a dash lor Dixie;.
Said he'd set the darkies free ;
Bui he hasn't done a'ready .
What we did expect to see,
Down upon the Rappahannock,
Burn-tide went with army bold
Tho' repuls'd, he did his duty,
Acting just &s he was told.
Chorus.
Congressmen may plan and twaddle
How the fighting should be done;
Ball Run taught them to skedaddle,
Ely took too slow a ran,
Editors, oar men of wisdom i
Lay the plan for Richmond's fall:
Greeley knows just how McClellan
Could have bag'd the rebels a!l.
Chorus,
Down in Dixie he may lead as,
We will follow any route ;
: Still the learned War Department
Gives the order Right about.
Lincoln's great on Proclamations,
Stanton councels Uncle Sam,
Halleck does as their adviser
Generals; some a perfect sham.
THE DESPOT'S EDICT.
There was a time when the annual Mes
sage of a President of the United States was
designed for the instruction, guidance and
benefit of the white race for whom the Re
public was created ; to-day we publish a
President's Message that, while it insulting
ly ignores these topics of .vital interest to
the white citizen, is devoted almost exclu
sively to suggestions and theories relative
the negro. If anything could inspire the
chief magistrate of an enlightened, people
witli statesmanship and sense of duty, such
inspiration, one might hope, would have
resulted from the contemplation of the des
olation and ruin that have been wrought
wiibin the space that assion and preju
dice have give lo the horrors of civil strife
Millions of American citizens will this day
peruse the President's Message with the
hope of fiading therein something sugges
tive of a termination of the hideous scenes
of the past thirty months. How bitter will
be the disappointment to discover nothing
i..r--;M nA tmnrootir.MA ntan ,
for the consummation of abolition ! The Meanwhile, from day to day, we have
Massage is rambling,-vague and evasive -canned the columns of the "War Demo
opon every subject but this. Its greater j cralic" journals with cariosity and expect
ation, brief as it ts, is devoted to details i
disconnected with our domestic troubles.
But the very first sentence that Mr. Lincoln
dedicates to the subject of our sectional
diSerences,' brings him in contact with the
negro question, and from that point to the
conclusion, Lhare is no fact, no argument, no
theory advanced that has not in view the
realization of the scheme of emancipation.
The "policy of emancipation" "and of em
ploying black soldiers" is first alluded to in
connection with onr political situation, and
having beau thoroughly exhausted, gives
place to the labyrinthine outlines of a plan
jo make abolition the imperative condition
of reconstruction. -v
No unprejudiced mind can dwell upon
ttis part of the Message without the convic
tion that Mr. Lincoln has determined to
prosecute i.'lia war hereaftur exclusively in
the interest of emancipation and according
to the extreme purposes of the Radicals.
If the intention" were openly avowed,. one
Slight give the man at least the tribute due
in boldness ; but there is a low cunning ex
hibited ia parade of sophistry that jars upon
t!i3 fcslingi as something which, when a
' 5c:a:sd w:ih ideas of oCcial digaity and
icsor, bring shame and humiliation to the
entire people. The plot, for ir is nothing
hi33 than a treacherous and despicable plot,
ii not developed ia the Jlescase proper.
To give it it osce the fores of an executive
ec'ict, h-3 appeaia a proclamation, purport
i ia be one of amnesty, but in reality de-

slavery. "A number of persons not less
than one-tenth in number of the rotes cast
in such States at the Presidential election
of the year of our Lord J8I0, each having
taken the oath aforesaid, and excluding all
others," may "re-establish a State Govern
ment,'' which "shall be recognized as the
true Government of the State?" "And it
is engaged as not improper that ioconstract
ing a loyal State Government in any State,
the name of the State, the boundary, the
mb-divisions, the Constitution, and the
general code of taxes be maintained, subject
only to the modifications made necessary
by the conditions herein before stated (those
of. the Emancipation Proclamation), and
such others which may be deemed expedi
ent by the; new State Government." The
suggestion is that it is not "improper" to
retain tin old Constitution, bat the sugges.
lion amounts to au invitation to do other
wise. By observing the tenor of -'the oath
aforesaid," it will be seen that no person
can assist in the formation of these new
State Governments who is not sworn to
"abide by and faithfully support all acts of
Congress passed daring the existing rebell
ion, with reference to slaves," and also "to
abide by and faithfully support all procla
mations of the President made during the
existing rebellion having reference to slaves,
Patting this and that together, the simplest
logician will perceive that it becomes int.
possible for any Stale to return to the Union
except coder the oath of its citizens to con
sent to the abolition of slavery. -
Is not this an effectual bar to reconstruc
tion ? j not this a prosecution of the war
directly for for the consummation of Eman
cipation 1 Having sacrificed so much of
their best blood and .undergone so much
financial, social and political misfortanes
with the prospect before them of years oj
ruinous warfare, the people of the North
cannot be blind to the propriety of establish
ing some standard of reconciliation that it
is possible for the South "to accept. Yet
now we have it distinctly proclaimed by the
Administration that the only avenue to re
construction leads under the yoke of Aboli
tion. Who shall say that is not the pliant
tool of fanaticism, that it is in accordance
with our Republican institutions for one-
tenth of the voters of a State to remodel,
ar.d in fact to re-create the laws and Constitution-o(
the State, especially when it is
within tae power of the. Administration, in
the event ol military occupation, to flood
such a Slate with me emissaries of its will ?
So far from being stlf-government, the re
alization of such a scheme would be worse
than tyranny ; it would be the betrayal of
the principle fought for by our fathers, by a
mean and treacherous trick, which would
eternalize discord, suspicion and haired be
tween the sections.
A noticeable feature of the Message is the
absence of all allusion to the arbitrary acts
of the Administration, to the suspension of
Habeas Corpus, to the Conscription Bill and
its ridiculous failure, and to the many de
parture?, from our system of government
which Lave been the themes for universal
comment. These things have touched the
popular heart to the core ; the public jour
nals have dilated upon them unceasingly,
they have been and are a source of general
concern and anxiety; but our Chief Magis.
irate does not condescend, to give them s
passing nottce ; secure tit the military
power be commands, he disdains to explain
to excuse or to justify ; his official attention
is too much preoccupied with that now
confessed purpose : Emancipation at all
hazards. Mr Lincoln's present Message
reveals the Radical policy in all its disloyal,
disunion and anti-republican aspects, and
consigns its author to eternal infamy. N.

The 'War Democrats."
Several days have now elapsed since the
publication of Mr. Lincoln's Emancipation
Jiessage ana -ADoiuion r rociamation.
c lOMwnain wneuior may wouia at
once renounce tueir advocacy oi a war
now confessed to be for the single purpose
of Abolition, or whether they would still
seek to justify their absurd doctrine by
some miserable subterfuge and canning
sophistry. We have examined the editorials
of The World of The Journal ot Commerce,
of The Express, not conceiving it possible
that those ardent organs of a "War for the
Union" could continue to advocate a pro.
longation of hostilities, after the President
had distinctly proclaimed that no "War
for the Union" was being waged. Bat
those journals seem postively to ignore this
fact, which completely confounds and de
molishes their theory, and while they com
ment severely upon the disunion tendencies
of the Message, still uphold the murderous
and runious strife which according to their
own argument, is destructive of ail the ele
ments of Reconstruction. Mr Lincoln,
th.jy admit, has postively. proclaimed the
war to be hostile to Reunion, yet . they in
sist upon the prosecution of this Anti-Union
War. The inference is, either that there is
no sincerity in their protestations of regard
for the Union, or that being completely be
wildered by the intricacies of the false po.
sition they have assumed, they have, deter
mined to ignore all troth and consistency,
and to toss without rudder or compass upon
the currents of the political maelstrom.
At a time like this,, when so much de
pends upon journalistic honesty and firmness
nothing can be more despicable than a
rAnnlrstinn (tf rusnnntihi t It v nr t, a rart rt f
- J - - t -
a public joarcal. GsaUsasa cl its 'War
Democratic' Press, define your position and
let the people know what principle yon
are contending for ; or if you dare not own
; a principle, confess your unworthiness to
guiae ana instruct tne paonc, ana aostain
hereafter from comment upon political
themes. You acknowledge the war to b
conducted in the interest of disunion, so far
yoa are in the right. Bat yoa support the
war such as it is, tempering only your sup
port with occasional denunciations of the
Administration. .The fact is still patent
that you support a war which you insist has
every disunion attribute. How can the
conclusion be avoided either that at heart
yoa are disonionists, or that some eelfmh
motive controls your boasted affection for
the Union and makes yoa "palter with us
jn a double sense V The World says that
that Mr. Lincoln "has rendered a Union
party in the Sonth impossible." In the face
of that impossibility, why sanction a war
so frought with misery and mistortuno f
Why should The World demand that hun
dreds of thousands of lives, billions of treas
ure commercial prosperity, financial order,
social happiness, political security, should
be sacrificed in a mad endeavor to accom
plish an impossibility! Perhaps The
World thinks that reunion can be effected
without a Union party at the Sooth. Does
it pretend that such a Union would be de
sirable, or that it would be possible without
the entire overthrow of oar political fabric ?
Oar contemporary does not intimate that a
Union majority wocld be impossible, but
a "Uoioa party,'' which means that, in its
estimation, the South is and will remain
unanimous in resistance to reconstruction.
Does The World expect to prevail upon
the Administration to change its policy ?
Does it hope that some miracoleus agency
will intervene between Mr. Lincoln and
his fanaticism t Will that insensate wor
ship of Abolitionism, which has intensified
from year to year, until now it is the para
mount, nay the onlj object of Radical exist
ence, be relinquished by its idolators, and
the pore flame of patriotism supply its
place ? There is not a "War Democratic"
organ that conceives so vain a hope, or that
would haTe the effrontery to make it the
excuse for prolonging the appeals to arms.
The North is being decimated, tmprovereh-
ed, ruined by a strife for which no b.?ter
result is claimed, even by Mr. Lincoln,
than the extenction of Slavery. The "War
Democratic" organs admit the fact, deplore
it, but cry let ns fight (on I We are fight
ing to achieve that which is impossible, yet
let as fight on ! They describe the Jugger
naut in all its hideous aspects ; they call
attention lo in as it rolls on through blood
p.nd carnage, leaving desolation behind,
while every hope of Union vanishes betore
its path; they nay, Lo '.the accursed engine
of the Republic's destruction, the in stru
ment of disbnion, and they call upon the
people to put their shoulders to the wheels
and push it on.
If the "War Democratic" organs, by
some subtle reasoning, have discovered
how it can be just for them to advocate that
which they condemn. or how it can be wise
to attempt that which they confess irnpos
sible, we trust they will give their logic to
the people. We ask them two plain ques
tioos : Do they believe that the Admin
istration design to prosecute the war for
the restoration of the Union ? Do they sap
port the war ? - If the first question be an
swered in the affirmative, tbey belie their
own words. If in the negative, how in
their conscience, can tbey answer the
second, except likewise in the negative ?
Speak, geutlemen, and to the purpoae, so
that, although but few may agree with you
all may understand yoa ; and let the people
after their President's direct repudiation of
a "War for the Union," be no longer mysti
fied by the sophisms of journals that still
cling to that abandoned theory. N. Y

'from Greenland'! ley Sonntains."'
The late Dr. Raffles, in a letter to Dr.
Lowell Mason, gives the following interest
ing account of the origin of the Missionary
Hymn of Bishop Heber, "From Greenland's
Mountains,'7 which is now sang tho wide
world over :
"Heber, fhen rector of Hodent, married
the daughter of Dean Shiply, Rector or Vi
car of Wrexham, in North Wales. On a
certain Saturday, he came to the house of
his father-in-law, who resided at the rec
tory or vicarage, to remain' over' Sunday,
and preach in that church for the Church
Missionary Society. '
As they sat conversing after dinner, the
Deaa said to Heber, "Mow, as yoa are a
poet, suppose yoa write a hymn for the ser.
vice to-morrow mornicg "
Immediately be took a pen, ink and pa
per, and wrote that hymn, which, had be
written in nothing else, would have im
mortalized him.- He read it to tho Dean,
and said i
"Will that do?"
"Ah," he replied, "and we will hsve it
printed and distributed in the pews, that
the people may sing it after the sermon.''
-"Bat," said Heber. "to what tnna will il
go ! " - - " ' - v
"Oh?' he added, "it will go to Twas
when the seas were roaring."
And so he wrote in ' the corner, at the
top of the page, Twaa when the was were
roaring." ."' - ; " ;
The hymn was printed accordingly. :

The Dead Wife.
Yes the wife yon loved so f oundly, cher
ished so tenderly is dead. She lies in the
shady room she loved so wel! ; but she
heeds not now where they palace her. Yoa
go in and look on thecalm and sweet face
marble like in its repose no smile beams
there on on your approach. The warm
blood mounts no longer to the soft cheek.
Yon press your lips wildly to hers, that for
the first time gave back no answering
pressure. Yoa take the little pale hand in
yours, but the slender fingers clasp around
yours no longer. Yon breathe the name
that has ever been the dearest to yoa in the
wide world, bat she bears your voice no
more ; she is dead ! Tbey. robe her in a
snowy shroud and lay her In a narrow coffin.
Oh ! can you live while she is 'prisoned
there, yoa wildly ask. ( The minister of
God sajs a few solemn words weeping
friends gather round to uke a last farewell,
and when turned away yoa stand by her
but for the last time. Can it be you must
part with her forever; that yoa look for the
last time on that deer face, press the last
kiss to her cold lips ; but no tears come to
your relief, and friends draw yoa away bat
yoa watch the undertaker as he folds the
muslin over that face, and torus the coffin
lid closely down. Yoa feel as if yoa would
suffocate, He does not heed, but puts the
screws in qnickelt, tightly and yoa follow
to the grave fhat yawns to receive the form
clasped so maoy times to your heart. Yoa
see them lower her in, and hear the clods
with a doll hollow sound upon her coffin.
Oh ! methinks there is no sound on earth
that brings such feelings to tba heart, as
the sound ot earth as it falls, covering the
forms of those we love. Yoa seek your
darkened home, but no white arms are
clasped round yoar neck ; no sweet voice
bids yoa welcome; no blue eyes look into
yours speaking the love the lips do not
always utter.
Here is where she used to sit close by
your side ; here the books she read : there
her piano stands open with your favorite
song spread ont ; bulrhe will sit by your
side, read for yoa, play for yoa, no more
forever. Yoa stand by the window look

are blossoming as brightly as if her band
had trained them up this very morning,
bat off beyond the garden yoa see the
quaint church spire, and there close by, she
slumbers. Yoa turn away and sit down
with all this agony at your heart, and
memory takes yoa back to the long ago, to
the first bour of your acquaintance with

penned to you in yoar absence yoa look
on a tress of sunny hair severed after death,
with a grief at your heart whicn will not
be hushed.
Years pass on, and another may bright

merry words and joyeous laugh, when the
dark eyes look in yoar own, when ber hand
is warmly closed in yours, the memory of
the loved and lost will sweep. over your
own heart until yoa forget the loving one
by yoar side. Sometimes yoa see a face or
form that resembles hers, or hear a voice
low and soft as hers used to ' be and you
find the young heart mouldering in the
grave is as dear to yoa as ever; though an

yours into your soul ; yoa hear the low
tones telling yoa again bow dear yon are,
bat yoa start op nervously and look around
on those gathered about yoa, trying to shake
off the illusion as yoa remember how long
she has been sleeping. Ah, the first true
love of the heart never will, never can die
out. It may be silent for a time, bat it will

might otherwise be happy. The heart,
thank God, is locked away from all human

AN EVENING REVERIE,
One rainy eve I sat me down, beneath the
murky skies,
Where sleepy hogs were grunting, aoa
tobacker sheds arise ;
Where bull-frogs sing the loudest, and the
lurid vapor shoots
A thought was running through my mind,
and water through my boots ;
And as a sudden thunder-clap far id the
distance sunk,
Once more I roused my ideas, and this was
the thought I thunk.

Oh, is there not some happy land a land
beyond the seas
Where pot-pie smoke in boundless lakes,
and dumplins grow on trees ?
Can gingerbread be found in stacks, and
smear-kase by the ton ?
And wben you do a job of work, you get the
"ready John ?"
Where Nature's lesson may be read in every
. babbling brook ?
Where bumble-bees don't sting a chap, and
muley bulls don't hook ?
Do people there get milk from cows, as
much as from the pumps 1
Doescholic ever come about, the measels
or the mnmbs ?
Do lovers fear for rival swains, to "run them
off the track V
And do they find the girls at 'home, and
never get the "sack ?"
Do hatbands bear upon their snoots the
mark of finger naiU ?
Do lambs skip o'er the verdant hills, and
xag their wooly tails 1
And in that land thats far away, do mad
dogs ever bite 1
Can "green ones.' see the "Elephant," at
fifty cent's a sight 1
Do scents of oys'ers reach one's nose, upon
each passing breeze 1
Do people fear for bed bugs there, or ever
dream of fleas 1
Do trousers rip without a cause or brogans
pinch your corns ?
And does the whiskey make yoa "yorked,"
at half a dozen "horns 1"
As if that land were nigh, there came a
strange and pleasing smell ;
And then upon ray list'ning ear the sound
of footsteps fell ;
At length I heard a deep-toned voice,
which seemed to mutter "Aye !"
I looked around it was a goat it only hol
lered "Bah 1'
My train of thought was broken off my
happy vision fled
I quickley hustled to my feet, and scamp
ered off to bed.

Midnight Charge of the Mnle Brigade.
A correspondent with the Army of the
Cumberland writes as follows:
During the advance of Hookers corn-
mand upon the enemy near Lookont Moun
tain, an incident happened that is worth re
lating, and one which I believe has never
been made public, notwithstanding the fact
that it was at the time of its occurrence a
subject of much merriment at the expnse of
the rebels. You will remember that Hook
er moved on Lookout Mountain very cau
tiously from the west side. While engaged
in the movement up th valley, owing to
some cause, unknown to me, a stampede
among the mules took place. It was in the
night, when both armies were resting
from the fatigues of the previous day, and
the sentinel's tread was the only sound that
disturbed the universal quiet. Rushing from
the wagons, to the number of about thirty,
the mules made for the enemy's lines like
frightened sheep. The drivers were awak
ened by the noise, just in time to witness
the disappearance of the animals through
our advanced pickets. The enemys pick
ets were not caught nappisg. Hearing the
mule brigade tearing across the valley, tbey
mistook them for the Yankee cavalry, dis
charged their muskets at the supposed
''Yanks" and fell back upon a batallion sta
tioned a little in the rear of them, with the
cry that the enemy were opon ihem. The
battallion partaking of the alarm, sprang to
arms only in time to hear the sound of the
frightened males, whose race was not check
ed by the volley from the pickets. They
retreated also a short distance to a point
where the whole brigade had stacked their
arms, and were calmly dreaming of home
and battle scenes. In rushed the battallion,
more deftd than alive from the fright, with
the exclamation, "Hooker has surprised us,
his cavalry ib upon ns' The valiant sons
of Mars did not wait to gather op their
blankets or guns but made the fastest pe-
dettrian time on record back to the main
force, leaving apon the field for the mule
brigade one thousand stand of arms, among
which were three hundred new Enfield
rifles, blankets, small arms, knapsacks, &c.
Meantime our teamsters bad given the
alarm and a force was sent out for the re
covery of the mules, and in a few hours the
expedition inaugurated the mules, returned ;
to our lines wiih the valuable spoiU."

him of a highland road in the West, where
a friend avowed he once met a man sound

I have lost

The saddest picture of the times is a roan

Who is the Husband of Miss Chase !
The Brooklyn (N. Y.) Eagle thus daguer
reotypes Senator Sprague, whose marriazo
with Miss Kate Chase has occupied so much
of the time of Washington newspaper wri
ter: Mr. Spragne is a young man of vast here
ditary possession accumulated by his father
in the printing of calicoes, and so on, in the
small but enterprising State of Rhode Island.
Personally Mr. Sprague is not attractive -pecuniarily
he is several millions. When
a mere lad, he was taken . from school and
placed in the cotton mill, where he soon
became an expert in all the varied manipu
lative and mechanical operation, as devel
oped in the calico line, to an extent that
warranted his friends in the belief that be
would make a merchant worthy of his fath
er's name, and not only keep what was left
to him, but vastly increase his store.
To this one branch of his education, young
Sprague devoted himselt day and night, Bo
th at, although comparatively ignorant of lbs
ways of the world, and wholly innocent of
even an approximate understanding of the
arte and sciences, polite or vulgar literature?
he was, at the time he attained his majori
ty, one of the best-informed manufacturers
in the country. Socially, he never amount
ed to math, antil within theiast year or so.
Retiring and modest, or rather, bashfal, he
avoided the society of ladies, paid no atten
tion whatever to dress, and was ragarded aa
eccentric, and far on the road which termi
nates in confirmed mierihness.
Some three or four years since, the young
mea of Rhode Island deemed it well to
break up the "machine" which had so long
controlled the Slate, and which had put in
nomination Seth Paddletord for Governor
They selected yoaug Sprague, whose fami
ly friends werepossessed( as well as he, of
vast wealth, which they would gladHy
spend, to gain position. At it they went,
hip and thigh, Sprague and Paddleford,
money against money. It was estimated
that the Paddlefordians were mulcted in the
modest sum of $75,000. Corruption of the
most unblushing nature was openly prac
tised at the poll, and the whole Slate flash
ed with the brilliancy of the golden drops.
Sprague was elected, and, by the aid and
comfort of an able Secretary of Slate (Bart-
'eu) an a distinguished prelate of tho
Church, accquitted himself with credit. His
long-closed purse was opened, and, with
great generosity his messengers promised
to the Prince of Wales that if he would visit
Rhode Island, be should be entertained
it.
He was chosen Senator with but little
! lronbIe. although he was not of the required
age. indeed, we doubt if be is yet old
enough for the position, or will take his
' 8eat al lhe aPPraching session. He makes
I 110 'Peche' ''he neither writes nortalks:
I he W,U no1 contribute to the dignity of the
Senate, for he is small, thin, and unprepos
sessing in appearance ; he will not vote
regularly, and just as Papa Chase tells him,
and be will always regret that he forsook
bis congenial factory, where he made a
mark, and could hold his ewu with the best
of them, for the marble halls of the legisla
tors whom he can neither influence nor
comprehend.
However, he, the timid, shrinking youth,
has added another success to his list. He
has added the hand of Miss Chase.
Coercion of Soldiers Votes.
If citizen soldiers could vote without res
traint, and under the influences which af
fect their fellow citizens, there would bo
no hesitation about leaving to them the
choice of officials in civil life. But they
are not allowed to choose their own officers
much less to vote nnconstrainedly for civil
officers. Here is an example of how the
system works in practice :
In Louisville, at the Exchange Barracks,
an Ohio regiment was stationed at the time
of the Ohio election. The vote of this regi
ment was 308 for Brough and 2 for Yallan
digham. Bt the hoar of 2 o'clock p. ra., I went to,
the place oppointed for the Ohio soldiers to
vote. Royal Taylor, the State asent officia-'
ted. 1 asked iflhey had any Democratic
tickets. They said they had not. 1 had a
ticket in my pocket, neately folded, oa
purpose for the occasion. 1 handed it to
one of the officers. The man who pat the
the ticket into the box had it in his hand
the last I saw of it. I started back to the
hospital. I got part way back, when an
officer cought me and took me back ido
the office, and said : "There is another
man that voted for Vallandigham." -They
took as down to the barracks and pot as in
the guard house. We were summoned to
appear before a coart-martial about 10
o'clock that night. The charge against me
was, voting for Vallandigham. I plead
guilty to the charge ; I wrote my defense
and was then taken back to prison, and
have been kept there ever since.
At a social party one evening, the ques
tion was put "What is religion ?" ' "Re
ligion," replied one of the party, is an in
surance against fire in the next world, foe
which honesty is the best policy."
