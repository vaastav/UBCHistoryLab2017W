WILMINGTON. X. C
WLTiMlXGTOX NOT INHOSPITABLE
that ,The
II JS Willi CACCU"S
- t, con nut '
Messenger notes the dispatch sent out .
to the papers of the state on Wednes
day last by Rev. Mr. Hale in regard to
the entertainment or rather to the in
dication that there would be lack of
entertainment by the people of Wil
mington of the delegates and visitors
proposing to attend the state conven
tion of the Baptists of this state. It
had been our intention to have noth
ing to say editorially on this subject.
Conditions here have become so se
rious and the situation among our
best citizens so strained of late that
this paper has felt that the best
course was to say nothing about it,
in the hope that the unfortunate state
of affairs would soon blow over. And
believing that it was in the nature of
a family affair, we thought that the
unfortunate circumstances should not
be published abroad; but in the last
day or two things have occurred and
publications made broadcast over the
state to the detriment of our city and
to the discredit of her people's well-
established reputation for hospitality,
which we think it our duty to comment
on and to deny. We are sorry to state
that the dispatch sent out by Rev.
Fred D. Hale to the papers stating
that only delegates can be entertained
at the state convention in Wilmington
this week and that no ladies can be
entertained because of unforeseen
conditions, coupled with his state
ment that so far only seven person:
outside of his own denomination had
agreed to entertain delegates or visi
tors to the convention, does the people
of our city great injustice and holds
them up to the people of the state in
false light. We feel sure that had
Mr. Hale accepted instead of rejected
the proposition of a responsible busi
ness man of the city authoritatively
made that the mayor would appoint a
committee to co-operate with Mr. Hale
and any committee he might appoint
there would have been no difficulty
in providing homes for all who wish
ed to attend tho convention. Mr.
Hale's emphatic denial to accede to the
proposition that the mayor should ap
point such a co-operative committee
estops him from saying that no effort
was made to secure accommodations
for those intending to visit our city.
rThe city's reputation for hospitality
and the manner in which it entertain
ed the many hundred delegates and
visitors to the city at the time of the
meeting here some years ago stand as
refutation of the charge that the people
of the city have any feeling against
the Baptist denomination or refuse to
entertain its delegates to the approach
ing convention. The statement can
not be successfully denied that if a
committee has been appointed by Mr.
Hale, as is usual in such cases, to pro
cure accommodation for delegates and
visitors to the convention such commit
tee has been very derelict in its duty,
for there are scores of householders
in the city who have not been ap
proached on the subject. Of the seven
persons who Mr. Hale speaks of as
having agreed to entertain one, we
know fas not approached by ,;any
one, but because of what he heard at
the Baptist church cn one occasion,
made the offer. He says had he not
been at the church on that occasion
he very probably would not have
heard any thing of the matter and
would not, therefore, have offered to
entertain any of the visitors. This we
mention to show what little ground
Mr. Hale has for his wholesale
charges against the people of our city.
He has not given them an opportunity
to display their accustomed hospital
ity and then publicly criticises them
foi not doing so.
TO THE BOARD OF ALDERMEN".
l
Gentlemen of the board of alder-
men: Kumor nas k iuai yum
board on last Tuesday night at Its
conference with closed doors consld-
ered the question of more strict reg
ulation of the retail liquor traffic
in this city; that you, because of
the fact that there had been put on
foot a strenuous effort to supplant
the present system of open and
legally licensed saloons with prohi
bition, had taken up the question in
several phases of restricting the
liquor business in the city of nar
rowing the privileges1 now enjoyed
by the men who are conducting sa
loons in the city under the licenses
granted to them by your body and
by the state authorities and it Is
further reported that It is likely
your board will take definite action
on these questions at its next regu
lar meeting, which will be. held next
week.
Presuming that these rumors are
true, we wish to say to you. Gentle
men of the Board of City Aldermen,
that The Messenger, for one, does
not think this is any time for swap
ping horses, for making a compro
mise of the political, economic or
moral question whichever it may
suit our different readers to call it
which has been brought face to face
with the people of our city. This
is no time for you to try to hedge
or to dodge the issue. The Issue
has been fairly raised for the people
to decide. If rumor is correct,
enough names have been secured to
the petition to your body to compel
it, under the law, to order an elec
tion on the question of saloons or
prohibition. .If the petitions are
sufficiently signed you have but one
and a plain duty before you, which
is to order the election and to pro
vide the machinery for its holding.
Vrn nrp rmt thp arbiters of the ex-
.... , .,. ,
peaiency oi me uemauu oi iuuw tu- j
izens who petition for the holding
of the election. The people have
drawn the issue and your duty is to
provide for the legal conduct of the
contest. The issue has been raised
and it can be determined and set-
tied only by a vote of the people.
It is your duty to carry out the law
and provide for the holding of the
election, ana mat is your oniy auty.
The issue that has been raised can
be settled in only one way by vote
of the people and the sooner it is
settled the better it will be for the
peace and prosperity of the city.
Therefore, you owe it to the city
if you are presented with a properly
signed petition to order the elec
tion at as early a date as possible,
so that the unfortunate contest may
be prolonged no ldnger than the ex
igencies of the case demand.
NO CAUSE FOR CRITICISM.
That was some rather plain talk
Standing Master Montgomery gave
to the lawyers, the public and to a
certain newspaper when his court
opened last Wednesday for taking
testimony in the railroad rate case.
When the postponement of the day
before was ordered we could not see
why such action should have been
ordered because of the absence of one
of the state's seven lawyers, but we
took it for granted that Mr. Mont
gomery knew what he was doing and
had good reason for his conduct.
We have no criticism to make of his
action, for we are not in position
to judge of his conduct. We believe
him to be honest and sincere in his
endeavor to make a thorough in
vestigation of the case as submitted
to him as standing master by the
federal court and until he most obvi
ously deviates from the proper
line of duty we will not presume
to criticise him personally or to find
fault with his action. We take
pleasure in believing every man,
whether private person or public of
ficial, to be honest and upright in
his dealings with his fellow-man or
in the discharge of his public duties
until he has proven himself by his
conduct to be otherwise. So far as
we have been able to judge, Mr.
Montgomery has been fair and hon
est, and we do not see that there
has been any call for newspaper criti
cism of his conduct.
ROOSEVELT AND HIS PARTY.
Is. Mr. Roosevelt paving the way
for republican defeat in the presi
dential election next year? would
be an appropriate heading for an ed
itorial in a recent issue of The Wash
ington Star, a republican paper,
which we quote in part below.
The Star makes some suggestions
which it would be well for Mr.
Roosevelt to heed, if his interests
in the success of his party are greater
than his political preference as to
who the next nominee for president
by his party shall be, and it calls
to mind some very significant occur
rences in the recent political history
of the country from which it leavefe
its readers to draw the conclusion
that Mr." Roosevelt is not the all
powerful leader of his party that he
and his friends-would have the gen
eral public to believe.
XI JJUUllU iv ugucic.
The Star would have us think
.MTNGTON MESSENGER,
the alleged scheme of the president
"to name his successor is more uu-
popular in nls 0wn party than is
the idea of his being a candidate
for the nomination.
The Star takes no stock in the
talk about Mr. Roosevelt being able
to break the solid democratic south
with Mr. Bryan as ns opponent, and
by way of sustaining Its position,
points to the great popularity of
President McKInley in the southern
states just after the war with Spain,
and still he was not able to defeat
the democratic nominee in a single
one of them. It points to the mani
festation in Cleveland over the de
feat of the president's candidate for
mayor of that city by Mr. Johnson
and to the sagging of the Taft boom
"because of the Roosevelt weight";
also to the situation la New York
where men pretending to act by au
thority are making war on Governor
Hughes and creating divisions in the
party of that pivotal state.
Furthermore, The Star does not
take any stock in the president's de
liverance on the subject of govern
ment officials pledged to him attend
ing conventions.
The article on the whole is a very
significant one, and from its authori
tative source, may be taken as an
indication of the waning popularity
of Mr. Roosevelt, or rather as evi
dence of increased opposition within
his party to the idea of his renom
ination or to his being allowed to
dictate to his party the man whom
it shall choose to be his successor
in the high office of president should
his party be successful at the polls.
It is an evidence of repudiation of
boss-rule and one-man-power in the
party, according to The Star; still,
we think that paper in going so far,
has misjudged the popularity of Mr.
Roosevelt among the masses of the
people. In its editorial it says:
The nresident's deliverance on the
snhiert of " federal officials and
tne
- mr.vpmf.nr does not
touch the la rarer aspects cf the case.
It will not even accomplish the limit
ed ends it would appear to cover.
Federal officials, earger for the presi
dent's nomination and anxious to pro-
mote it, neea not opemy amuwic nc
cause or ask lor instructions in
instructions in nis
f-ivnr nss ripipsritps to the republican
I national convention. If he does not
take himself out of the calculation
nave to rj0 to aid in the consumma-
tion of the third term project is to
get themselves elected delegates to
that body. The rest will be easy.
With the president, at that time a
possibility, a shout in his behalf in
the convention hall will give them
their cue, and if the convention can
be stampeded for him they will be
on hand to help it along.
Mr. Roosevelt owes it to himself,
to his party and to the country to go
far beyond this. He should make it
absolutely impossible for any man,
in office or out a prfervid republi
can, or a democrat disgruntled by
Bryanism to make further mention
of his name in connection with next
year's republican leadership. He
should speak so as all men would un
derstand, and no man dare disobey.
Instead of putting the mr.tter on the
easy elevation of "impropriety and
courtesy," he should put it on the
sheer height of an affront to him.
For that is what the matter, in its
proper analysis, amounts to.
But more than this. Mr. Roosevelt
should, definitely and at once, dis
connect his name and the influence
of his office from all boon?. He can
as little afford to undertake to name
his successor as to run again himself.
His party is fully able to choose its
leader and is impatient of White
house direction in the premises. Look
at the manifestation a: Cleveland,
where Mr. Burton, wearing an ad
ministration tag, met a Waterloo.
Look at the Taft boom, sagging be
cause of the administration's weight.
Look at the situation ii New York,.
where men pretending to act by au
thority are making war on Governor
Hughes, and creating diversions which
may rival those that marked the old
stalwart and halfl breed days in that
imnortant and pivotal stare, and which
ended in the republican disaster of
1884.
This business is not without its
specious pleas and representations.
No man. we are told, may withstand
the commands of the country. If the
countrv calls Mr. Roosevelt he must
obev. Certainlv. That is to be ad
mitted readily. But whst sort of call
is that which is being irilled like a
dramatic mob, or an optratic chorus,
by experts, and in defiance of the pres
dent's plain announcement on election
niht three years ago.
Then there is that old tongue-worn
blather about Mr. Roosvelt and the
south. Let him run a?ain. we are
told and states which have not been
republican since reconstruction days
will vote for him. No republican was
ever as popular in the south as Mr.
McKinley. At the close of the war
with Spain the south, in her pulpits
and in her newspapers, paid him the
heartiest tributes for the broad and
patriotic spirit he bad nanifested in
the conduct of hostilitbs. But the
next year she voted for Mr. Bryan
again without a bobble. Mr. Rcose
velt couldn't life the lecoral votes of
any one of the lower southern states
out of the democratic column with
the aid of a derrick.
TO THROTTLE THE PRESS.
The Littleton News-Reporter, in
speaking of the recent slugging
match carried on among the students
of the Agricultural anc Mechanical
college under supervision of the au
thorities of that institition, states
that "President Winston saw his mis
take and was brave enough to ad
mit it." So far, so good, but that
naner follows this un with the re-
markable statement that President
Winston "being a big nan, of large j
mental calibre, he did not sour on j
the press and make ad attempt to
throttle it." Now that last expres
sion is the limit did -not attempt
. ,
J to throttle the press because it saw
TUESDAY, DECEMBER
fit to criticise his conduct as a state
official. In that President Winston
did not attempt to do anything of
the sort shows that he is a man of
sense. We would like to know what
would have been the result had he
attempted to throttle the press in
that matter. On second thought we
must say that we are not prepared
to admit that it acquired the pos
session of such great amount of sense
for a man to realize that he could
not throttle the press of the state
in such a case as this. Of course,
there are some papers in the state,
as are to be found in every other
state, which would have helped him
smother the facts had be so desired,
but they do not represent the people
or the press of the state.
THE'lMtESIDEXTS MESSAGE?"
Congress meets tomorrow. We expect
to give our readers the President's
message in full in Wednesday's paper.
It is said the message is of unusual
length and deals with several matters
of vital Importance to the people of
the whole country. There has not
been a president's message to congress
in vpars which has attracted the
attention that will be given to this
one. What its tenor is of course, we
do not know, but general surmise is
that it will treat on several subjects
of great interest to the people and we
feel sure that in laying it in full before
oi.r readers the day after it has been
rtad to congress we will not be doing
a piece of useless work. It will be
cortiilly read by a much larger num
ber of people than have read a pres
ident's message of much shorter length
in many years. Because of the pecul
iar political situation now existing
anything the president may say which
has or may be construed to have bear
ing on the next presidential election
will be read with great interest, and
there is no doubt that no matter what
Mr. Roosevelt may say will have sotre
connection in one way or another with
the presidential election in 190S.
SHOULD PAY THE FULL PENALTY
The Greensboro Telegram classes to
gether Harry Thaw and Mrs. Bradley
as two persons who "perhaps" should
not suffer death,, but it thinks that
should they be set free or consigned
to an asylum for the insane the ends
of justice would not be met. The
)Telegram is right. An insane asylum
is not the place for either of those
murderers. Each took the life of a
person not a bit better than the slayer.
There was in each case such a sur
rounding atmosphere of immorality
and social filth, willingly lived in by
all parties concerned that those who
finally took the law into their cwn
hands have no excuse for their con
duct. iThey cannot pose as advocates
of or purifiers of social life. Their lives
were as vile as were those of the per
sons whose existence were snuffed out
without chance of or time for repent
ance and their action was solely a
matter of revenge and done in anger.
Such persons should pay the full pen
alty of their crimes.
WHOSE THE FAULT?
The New York Times of recent
date publishes an interview of Pres
ident Woodrow Wilson, of Princeton
college, on the financial situation
and its causes. The reported inter
view is headed by a few paragraphs
giving the pith of the long article.
Among these paragraphs we find the
following two which we think will
attract the attention of our readers:
I charge the present financial panic
to the aggressive attitude of legislation
toward the railroads, that made it
impossible for them to borrow
money.
The corporation problem resembles
a society of burglars, legally organ
ized to plunder, against whom crimi
nal proceedings result only in an in
dictment, or a fine which the plun
dered themselves must pay.
We regret that we have not the
space to give Mr. Wilson's remarks
in full; but the two paragraphs
given above are enough to show the
trend of thought in the full inter
view. We are glad to see that Mr
Wilson's ideas are the same that
The Messenger has tried to lay be
fore the people. We believe, and j
we are glad to know that we have J
such high authority for our position,
that anti-corporation legislation has
had much to do with the greatly un
settled state of money conditions of
the present day.
The shyster politicians have much
to account for to the people. They
have destroyed values; they have
impoverished the widow and the or
phan; they have tried, and for a
time succeeded, to build up for them
selves a popularity which has cost
the country millions of dollars. For
the sake of securing some petty po
litical preferment they have been
willing to stagnate business, to pau
perize' hundreds of people and to
bring toa stand-still the industry of
the whole country.
This is a terrible arraignment to
bring against these men who have
n nlaced in control of the politi
cal and economic affairs of;tbe states
and of the nation; tmt, nevertheless.
it u a true accusation, and In the
end the people will find that they
have been deceived and that tne
men into whose hands they have
placed their interests have proven
false to the trust imposed on tnem
and have been unworthy stewards
men who have used their power and
authority, not for the good of the
people, but to secure their own po
litical advancement. There U a day
of reckoning ahead for these stew
ards of the people and w&en that
day comes some of them will wish
they had never accepted the stew
ardship, for they will find themselves
weighed in the balance and found
wanting. The people can't bo foole 1
all the time, nor are the people un
just and unfair. They will have
their eyes opened to the machina
tions of this coterie of self-seeking
politicians and they will mete out
to them their just deserts.
DECIDEDLY OUT OF TASTE.
The Charlotte Observer editorially
criticises Justice Brewer, of the fed
eral supreme court, for what he said
a few days ago about President
Roosevelt playing hide and seek
with the presidential nomination.
Perhaps Justice Brewer should not
have said what he did about tho
head of a co-ordinate branch of the
government, but criticism of his lan
guage would come with poor grace
from Mr. Roosevelt or any of his
friends in face of the severe arraign
ment by him of a judge of the fed
eral court a short while back be
cause that judge did not declare the
law in an indictment of a party for
violation of the anti-trust law to be
what the president thought it should
be declared to be. Mr. Roosevelt
and his friends are estopped to deny
the right of a federal court judge
to criticise his conduct. The presi
dent's action in the case was out
rageous and should have boon con
demned by every newspaper and
every person in the whole country.
We are glad to know that it did
receive very general condemnation,
and, no doubt, Mr. Roosevelt has
regretted his conduct. But because
he violated the proprieties in that
case gives no excuse to Justice
Brewer to be guilty of the same of
fense. ' His remarks were to the
point and were enjoyed by many
persons, but still they were very
much out of taste.
SENATOR OVERMAN.
The Durham Herald pays Senator
'Overman a very handsome compli
ment when it says his "conduct is
such as becomes a senator, but is
not such as counts for much in
times like these." The people know
that Mr. Overman had rather not
be re-elected than to stoop to the
tricks of certain persons desiring po
litical preferment. We believe the
people thoroughly understand Mr.
Overman and honor him for the up
right, manly position he has taken
in regard to the election of his suc
cessor, and we believe that the peo
ple will say that he should be his
own successor. They 'see through
the schemings and political trickery
of the few men in the state who are
trying to down him, and they are
not going to stand for it. We do
not believe the people of the state
would be so blind to their own in
terests and to those of the whole
south, as to consent that he should
at this time be put aside for any
scheming politician. They are not
going to consent to the exchange of
a tried and proven statesman for a
mere politician and political wire
puller.
WHOSE TOES DO THEY PINCH?
The latest Chanler cartoon repre
sent? Uncle Sam standing between
Tii-van nni Chandler at mile oosts-
the Bryan signboard pointing "The
Road to Ttuin" and the Chanler sism-
board pointing to "The Road to True
Democracy." Such puerile stuff Is
costine Mr. Chanler n:re than it Is
worth. He cow M better afford. to have
it suppressed. Naws and Observer.
Of course Mr. Chanler should
have such cartoons suppressed. Bu
what we want to know is, why an
avowed organ and supporter of Mr.
Bryan should be so urgent for their
suppression If they are hurting Mr.
Bryan's opponent for the nomina
tion? Why should The News and
Observer be so solicitous about Mr.
Chanler being hurt by libelous car
toons? If it really is for Mr. Bryan,
as we suppose it Is, as sincerely be
for any body except itself, why
should it be so anxious for Mr. Chan
ler to put a stop to a course which
it says hurts that man's chances for
the nomination? Isn't one who
knows the character of that paper
and of its editor bound to think
that he wants thosfe cartoons sup
pressed because they, in his opinion,
are hurting Mr. Bryan and not Mr.
Chanler? If he thought they were
injuring the chances of the latter he
would be displaying them on every
page of his paper.
