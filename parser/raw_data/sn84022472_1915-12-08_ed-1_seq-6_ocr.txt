7, ,ytion. - This may account
i makes as a man of pessimism and fault-finding.
. His " comments; up on President Wilson's: message are more
petulant' than virile, more envious than generous, more harmful
,1 than helpful. . . ' t ' . ;
' -4 The tenor of Mr. Roosevelt's criticism is-in one direction.
J It sums his own -views in the sentence in Which he complains
I that thepresident "Met blood and iron with milk and water." -;
' The. United' States is not making war in Mexicd. The United
States is; not making war in Europe. Therefore the president is
not executing the will of thgr American people. This is literally
the attitude of Col. ! Roosevelt a position which would have
: more dignity, if he stated it in plain terms,' and left out the petty
comments upon the president's method pf expressing himself., .
i Mr. .Roosevelt will find that the people, in this country do
i not want a: war with' Mexico.? They dp'not'desire a war 'with
i Europe. They will embark' in either with greatest reluctance.
j '. The truth is -.that-Mr Roosevelt is like many men. of ac
f t ion, who- attempt to act; according to a school "of thdtight.. With
' many scholars and statesmen he makes the mistake of applying
"."the terms xf European' "political economy to American condi
tions. ' I'jt- ' " ': , . .
lie speaks truly when he suggests, as he has in time past,
that a Eiu-opean nation would take arms to Mexico .were the
coiigj "iS as they are between Mexico. and the United States. ,
.But he does not consider the different situation of Euro
j pea n states, as compared with American-states. " '
;.. : The clue to trio political action .of a European state, in such
! a situation as.that in Mexico is, in he dense population of the
; land of , Europe1 TJie laii will hot support the jpeople; they must
emigrate. The land does not afford opportunity to capital, and
! capital tnust emigrate. ' ( - '
- '. - Thus European: capital" in foreign lands. and European im
? migrants in "foreiga lands, serve their country. ( L '
But American states, have more land than, they know what
I to do wth. 'TheY do 'not'jjesire, AmericJan.''capiWlv:nor,,American
citizens1 fo rush to the development of other' countries. v ;
Thercapital in. Mexico, -and the Americans iri'Mexipoj are
thocght to be father mjuidiig their conntryy han aiding it.fc The
f -people see no reason why they should, defend" with arms those
( who ha-veutaken;-tZaeir; ' persons ' jd-&'eilr;.fortuneis -out of. ;,tbis
i sparsely populated -country,- to' enricli other countries. v
j A state will sli,ed its : blood for Its interest;' but -U will, not
sl:ied its blood against its interest.;;, Ivor does tsuch aerogram
bar a war of nercy, ; Th e war with Cuba was doubtless a war
cX mefcy, 111 that the Cubans desired American intervention.
; ' But there is no party in Mexico that asks or desires Amerj
' can-intervention.. Under the1 usages of precedents of our gov-
eminent the people of Mexico haveJ a right to work out their
own destiny. . ' ' . .
If they desire to wade in blood they have the same right
to do it that any European state has. ' i"
The president in keeping at peace with Mexico represents
his country better than Mr. Roosevelt. does, who would go to
.' war there. i .t- - ' 1 , . ,
' Mr. "Roosevelt' 3 concepts of duty are based on European
political maxims, which do not 'apply to American states. The
' precepts of the '.president 'are a natural result of his understand-
I ing of American conditions. vV-; : .V-.;7; .
; As for Mr." Rotsevelt's notion! that America ought to arm for
' ! the protection of Eelgium, it is a notion too fantastic for serious
consideration. It is out of touch with the policy of the nation,
! since Washington gave Ms warning against foreign entangle-
ments. '."..' , ' .
A And if we are unprepaf edy as Mr. Roosevelt says we are, as,
(he left us when he left office, why tdoes he suggest that we
fight for Belgium? Should a nation go to war befQre it is ready
' to" fight? ' j "y v l

Prince Kropotkin,
Russian Bebel, Has
Brilliant Daughter
Prince Peter Alexieyitcn Kropotkin,
lonsr th most famous of the Ptussian
revolutionists, will ; be seventy-three
years old to-morrow. . The distin
guished and scholarly defender of
philosophic anarctiism has royal blood
.in his veins, and it is said that the
Kropotkin. family has almost as good
a claim to the Russian ' throne as that
of the Romanoffs. Except for his
radical tendencies, Prince Peter might
have become a great power in Rus
sia, for .in intellectual k vigor he is
vastly superior to the great majority
of Russian nobles. When he had just
attained his majority he made a jour
ney across North Manchuria , which
won for. him the, gold medal of the
Russian Geographical Society. , In
1872 he ' joiroed the International
Working Men's Association, the pa
rent body, of both modern socialism
and anarchism, and was arretted and
confined in .the grim prison of St. Pe
ter and St.' Paul. , He finally' contrived
to escape, and found i a refuge in Eng
land, where he has since -resided the
greater" part of the' time. , While his
reputation as a revolutionist and ni
hilist has somewhat-' eclipsed -his oth
er activities, he is honored by geogra
phers the world over, while his liter
ary style Is the admiration of all men
of letters. Prince leter has but one
child,- a daughter,- now Mrs. Sasha
Kropotkin-Lebedoff! ' : She was born
.and educated in England, and, her hus
band, Boris Lebedoff, is a Russian ex
ile and a Journalist. Prince Peter's
.daughter has . iphoritetl , much of his
genius, ana nas maae quite" a reputa
tion as a writer. In a r5ent article
she defended the ideals of pan-Slavism,
which -she describes , as Tsr..vtsr
lor its fundamental aim "tht closer
union, of Slav speaking nationalities - a
union not in any way desirous of' in
tertfering with ith freedom - of . other
nationalities." U- She- insists . that1 the
ideals oft pan-Slavism , and of Pan
Germanifm are entirely, different; .and
that the former can never betime a
minace to other, peoples.' while th-i lat
ter has- for its' purpose "the Qerraani
zation of as much of the world as pos
sible and of Europe ' in. any case."
While denouncing the "autocratic and
arbitrary regime" of the Romanoffs,
she has mothing . but praise f or Rus
sia's participation in this war. and der
dares that except for Russia's aid'1', "a

' - INDIAN BLOOD. : i -; ; : .'-x
In the, eatly days of the republic.
an .Infusion ;of Indian ' blood',' would
have been c'ohsidered a bar sinister.
No one even spoke -.well for the half-
breed. ,, But. as the. generations go on.
many of bur older famuiea. are show
ing' pride; ini-having" in their ( lineage
some infusion :o Indian blood. (Among
them is the family of Mrs. Gait, the
President's fiancee. 'jvThus the . Indian
tribes for' the first time -will now be
able to claim some slight kinship, with
an occupant of the White House. '.;
Seen, near to, .the Indian , was never
popular.-; 'The. idea that the only good
Indian is the dead one was always the
view of the frontier.- He was a rebel
from; the responsibilities of civiliza
tion. As many of them are now set
tling down, and.; cultivating land like
white .folks, the virtues of his; face
uuty u5 .UQLicr.icwBiuxcu. .-. -. .... . ;
Most of the aboriginal strains t are
thick-witted, ' earth-born creatures,
slow of thought and dull of apprehen
sion. - The. Indian , was quick, alert;
nervous, lithe of motion, passionate.
He '.was capable of affectionate loyalty
and ; fiendish revenges. Tie had' his
own beauty 'of imagery and) was not'
lacking in . fine . ideals. -He was : the
poet of the stone age, a dreamer and
mystic. '. , .- ; ., :-
Other, undeveloped races have grad
ually adjusted themselves to the white
man's regimen of sober industry. The
negro never rebelled at being a hewer
of, wood and drawer of water. : But
for the - Red man, ' tilling the ground'
has been but slavery , to a. proud
spirit. : Vi . .;:. -H ' ' 'i ' ' j ,
Qnce the- owners of a continent . the
Indian is but' an ; insignificant factor
in our life today. Only a slight infus
ion of his blood has entered ourj-aoe.
I xr oia lammes iikjs ivxrs uaii s are
j.prouci of it, it is as a. poetic sentiment
If bid families like Mrs- Gait's are
and a . sign . of the age of the family
tree. The remnant of the race, how
ever, inherits, qualities of endurance
and1 imagination, . which properly
trained - in the yoke ' of industry will
yet be valuable. . " ' v . V
