the pretty Miss May Goelet recently had
two narrow ribbons fastened to It, and on
the other end of the ribbons there hung
a velvet rose, dangling fully four inches
below the chou. He sure in trimming u»
your handsome shirt waists to use -arti

Quite apart from the waist of flannel,
or the one of handsome velvet and lace,
Is the winter shirt waist, which is made
of corduroy and its cousin, winter velvet.
This waist is for utility, and well does it
serve, out its self-appointed mission 7 of
wearing well. A good shirt waist of
heavy, warm, dark velvet will furnish
a staple article of dres.i for every day
all winter and probably make a mountain
jacket next' fall.
Get Good Velvet.
In buying a dark velvet shirt waist
there -is -only one course- open— get the
best. Poor velvet never was a bargain at
any time and made up Into a shirt waist
it Is doubly not what It seems to be.
Good velvet does not "crock," does not
wear off, does not crease readily and is
warm and beautiful while an inch of it re
mains.
Corduroy is still more serviceable than
velvet, for it has about it certain admir
able traits of. durability. Where velvet
"spots" corduroy does not; it can be
cleaned here and there delicately with a
sponge and water. It wtll bear hard
usage and It Is a little heavier than vel
vet. ■ ' •
The young women of New York's Pour
Hundred are wearing corduroy shirt
waists for their tramps daily on Fifth
avenue. They select the dark-green
shades, buttoned down the front with big
brass buttons, and they choose i the
strange blues, with their big army-like
fastenings. There are browns, too, browns
galore, In corduroys, and- the waists Hint
are made from any of these are good.
The corduroy waist is very much liked
made us a Norfolk, with a wide plait
each side of the middle of the back and
one each side of the middle of the front.
The plait is stitched upon each edge and
Is very flat and trim, not loose, uncertain
an- baggy, as some plaits are.
Corduroy is also brought under the spell
of the tucker's art and Is tucked. A
beautiful corduroy waist, worn by Mrs.
Harry Payne Whitney, was In black, *. .th
the uppers of the sleeves tucked as far
as the elbow. The tucks were very, very
small and were released only to allow
the elbow room, then were resumed again
to the wrist, where they were released
again to make a Russian puff, below
which came a tight little coat cuff, all of
corduroy. The waist showed a tucked
front, with the fullness of the release com
ing over the bust, then there was tucking
again, the whole caught in a belt, which
waa, very pointed In front.'- though not
by any means exaggeratedly so. ■• . -
Mrs. Vanderbilt's Corduroy.
1 Mrs., Alfred Vanderbilt ha# been v.ear
ing a corduroy which 1 was warm and
pretty. The waist and skirt were alike
and in» a tobacco brown." The skirt was
perfectly p'ain, except for rows and rows
of stitching around the foot, and the
waist was of the full blouse variety. Over
it she wore the prettiest. of ermine capes,
coming just over the shoulders. The cape
had • those "eyes' 1 - which 'mark ermine
with the price mark of expen&lveness.
The collar was very tall, but was cut to
roll back irom the ears. . . !
Around the neck there was a iband.of
brown velvet put on in u half puffed, half
gathered fashion, with a big bow' in front
with Jong ends that came far bjelow the
waist. These ends were "made"; ones o"
velvet, cut slanting' upon the ends, and
widening all the wajr They were lined
with satin.
"Made" velvet bows will be very much
worn and the velvet in them must be of a
very, high quality. To be extremely up-to
date these velvet ends and loops, indeed
the whole bow, must be satin lined; in
stead of velvet lined, and they must be.
large, not at all suggesting the skimpy
little .velvet bow worn upon the shirt
waist a year ago.
The winter shirt walnt is built for the
back, as the summer tsliirt waist is built
for the front. The summer girl wants to
look attractive as she comes to meet you
in the sunlight. The winter girl must
look attractive at all times, in parlor and
in Kitting room, on dull days and bright
ones. To accomplish this she must build
her shirt waist for both views, front and
back.
Not a few of the new waists are ui
trimmed In front except for bunds, per
haps of sllk.Jaid on in great circles, one
circle looping the front from shoulder to
shoulder, one edge of the band sewed
tight, the other loo.«e. There may be three
bands of ullk, one laid below the other,
and slightly overlapping, as though they
were tiu-ks. This style is very much af
fected by those who like the shirt waist
that is buttoned In the back.
The buck of such a waist may be quite
elHborate with Its folds of silk, its hem
stitohiiiK and its very handsome buttons
whieh can sentinel the path between tho
back of the neck and the back of the
belt. —
The trick of trimming the waist for the
back view Is much noticed upon the even
in; waists. Many of these are positively
elaborate, even fussy, in the flouncing^
and. rutnings that fall from tho neck and
from the yoke. , .
• ihere Is- a back that is liked by those
-who enjoy the French waist. It begins,
to start with the belt, with a very wide
liberty satin ribbon • which Is hooked in
the back under»a very.ornate buckle. Tho
belt In the back" is very, very wide and
would suggest an empire were It not for
the fact that It dips upon the sides and la
pulled low, in front.
At the back of this fancy French waist
there Is. a litle bolero, put on the back
only, for. it comes only from the armpits.
Then there ' s » little puffing of chiffor.
wnich falls below the bolero^and over
the belt all the way around; anl
finally/ to finish at the neck there, is a
yoke of lace with a deep lace ruffle. Th»
stock ie, of course, necessary, but it is a
thing that Is put on afterward and whicto
can be varied. -
Shirt "Waist Belts.
The shirt waist belt is a thing that d«
mands attention, for it Is a thing apart,
like tho stock. Belts spring up every
day, and are every day buried and for
gotten in the depths of Mme. La Mode's
castaways, but they come to light again,
anew; enjoying another existence.
The belt which at this very second
holds the center of the world's attention,
that part of It which is interested in the
winter shirt waist, Is the one that haa
two buckles, one in the middle of the
front and one In the middle of the back.
This may be a shaped belt, but it must
be Bhaped by some one who understands
the how und wherefore.
The buckle in the back, in the case of
the beltwlth two buckles, is the one that
Is for show. It is slidden upon a ribbon
and takes Its place right in the middle of
the back. It may be one of those long,
nanow buckles which make the waist
look so lengthy and slender, or it may be
a more up-to-date thine.
One of the very newest of the back-of
the-walst buckles looks like three buckles
— and, indeed, U Is three, fastened .under
neath in some way. Visible there are
three circular buckles caught in buckle
fashion through the Bilk. They may b«
in pearls, which are so pretty, or In steel,
which is so fashionable, or In silver, which
is a fad with so manv women.
The newest convert to the silver fad Is
Queen Wilhelmina, who has decided that
all her small ornaments shall be stiver.
