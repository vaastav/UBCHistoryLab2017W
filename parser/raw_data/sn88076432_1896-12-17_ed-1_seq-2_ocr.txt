Th#- Doctor's Story.
Havana. Dec. 13.—Dr. Zomn ha. the
personal physician of Antonio Maceo.
•who. aTter surrendering to Col. Tort at
San Felipe, furnished confirmation of
tbe reported death of the great Cubau
leader, has given to the press in an
interview at Malena del Sur. addition
ad facts in connection with the case.
It seems that Antonio Maceo and his
companions did not cross the trocha
or military line of Pinar del Itio in the
«ense generally understood. They
-|iassed from Pinar del Rio into Ha
vana province by sea, in an open boat,
live trips being required to take the
-whole party of insurgents froni Pinar
•del Kio to Carbuiez. this province, and
as the boat would only hold eight men
"in addition to the handlers, it will be
seen that Maceo's party was com
posed of only forty men. The night
was dark and stormy. -ceo was ac
companied by Miro. nether important
insurgent leader, and others of his
staff. They landed near Banes, and
shortly afterward occurred the en
counter with the Spanish troops under
Maj. Cirujeda. resulting, as alleged, in
the death of the Cuban chief.
The meeting between the Spaniards
-and the insurgents was seemingly of
an accidental nature, the former hav
ing no idea at that time that Maceo
bad succeeded in leaving the Province
of Pinar del Rio. In spite of the of
ficial accounts of the death of Macoo
and Francisco Gomez there are many
Iiere who refuse to credit the report.
"Friend* of the insurgents express the
"belief that either the jewelry and otli
-er things alleged to have been found
by tiie Spanish soldiers did not belong
••to Maceo or else that they -were placed
upon the body as a ruse, in order to
"throw dust in the eyes of the Span
iards while Maceo pushed on east
ward and communicated with Maximo
-Gomez.
Still Discredited.
Key West, Fla., Dec. 13.—Maceo's
-death is still discredited by the great
er number of prominent Cubans here.
"Yet there are a number who fear it is
'true. All await the arrival of the
steamship from Havana to-morrow,
however, before conceding it to be true.
The Spanish consul received official
news of Maceo's death yesterday. The
^report that Dr. Zertucha, who was
Maceo's physician, had seen Maceo's?
body exhumed, is untrue. It is learned
from a reliable source that the doctor
never was Maceo's physician. Some
3!entlemen here brlieve that Maceo had
•formed a plan with Gomez to go to the
Havana district to meet Gomez's
•forces there, as Gomez had sent 7.000
-men to the Havana district. Maceo
•crossed the trocha with 600 men. Iu
A skirmish with the forces of Gen.
Arolas after he liad crossed the troche
Maceo's forces wounded twelve of the
Spanish troops. It is reported that
Maceo left Rios Rivera, his second in
command, who landed from the Unit
-ed States Sept. 1, in charge of the in
snrgent forces in Pinar del Rio. Rios
Rivera defeated the Spanish in the
last war in the presence of .lovcllar.
If the rejjort of Maceo's death be true,
then Cubans will cry "viva Rios Ri
vera."
The United States warship Newark
arrived here this morning. Nothing
ean be learned of her errand.
Dauntless Seised.
Jacksonville, Fla., Dec. 18. Tbe
-steamer Dauntless, that has achieved
8Dch a reputation as a filibuster, was
seized by the government last night
-on complaint of the Spanish consul
that she was contemplating another'
•expedition. Her papers were taken
a.way and an officer from the Boutwell
pnt on board. To-day. on demand of
•Owner Bisbee's lawyer, her papers
•were returned, but he was informed
that, she could not leave the harbor
until he had made affidavit that she
was not going on any expedition save
with a revenue officer on board. Bis
"bee intimates that the revenue officer
here will lie sued, as also the captain
-of the Boutwell for seizure.

381 Utcs were lost by the wreck of
the Sailer. The Salter was wrecked
on tbe night of Dec. 7 fonr miles north
of Villacariea. Spain, and two and one
half miles from land. She must have
broken up almost imirediately. as
parts of the steamer have already
washed asliore. The steamer had a
general cargo. The disaster occurred
during a dense fog and very heavy
weather. The Salier had a fearful
passage from Bremen to this port.
Two of her boats were swept over
board by the heavy seas which beat
over ter and she sustained other dam
ages from the same cause. It is be
lieved that about 400 perished. The
steamer struck during the night of
Monday last on a ledge of rocks. A
large amount of wreckage is rejwrted
to have washed ashore. Of the steer
age passengers there were over W
Russians, about 35 Galacians. some
Germans and about -00 Spaniards, ac
cording to the estimates, all on their
way to the Argentine Republic, look
ing for new homes "for themselves and
families. The agents of the North
German Lloyd company have been in
structed from Bremen to spare no ex
pense in searching for the missing pas
sengers and crew of the sunken steam
er. It is known tli/.t the Salier had a
pilot on tioard when she struck. The
weather, however, which she experi

New York. Dec 13.—A Washington
special to the World says: President
Cleveland has been called to account
by the sultan of Turky. An emphatic
protest was made yesterday by the
Turkish government against the lan
guage used in the president's message
to congress respecting the massacre of
the Armenians and the general con
duct of the government toward the
Christians in the empire. The situa
tion is said to threaten the rupture of
the diplomatic relations between the
United States and Turkey. The Turk
ish minister, it is rumored at the state
department, has intimated that if some
amends is not made by the president,
he will lie obliged to ask for his papers
and will return to Constantinople.

MAKES A BAD HITCH
VENEZUELANS OPPOSE THE P80
POSED AGREEMENT.
Reports From Venezuela State That
a Serious Agitation Han Sprans
Cp Against the Boundnry Settle
ment Agreed Ipon by Represent
atives of the Governments of the
I'nlted States and Great Britain.
Washington. Dec. 13.—The unofficial
ivjtorts from Venczjela that a serious
agitation has sprung up against the
boundary settlen eut agreed on br
tween the United States and Great
Britain causes miich nuprise. and no
little concern in official quarters here.
Minister Andrade and Jan cs A Stor
row were to have sailed from l~i
Guayara, the seaport of Caracas, yes
terday noon on the Red Star steamer
Philadelphia, and the boat was ex
pected to reach New York ou the Kith.
Mr. Andrade had cabled the time of
his leaving as given in the Associated
Press dispatches or. the day the cable
was received, and had added an of
ficial cablegram to Mr. Olney stating
that President Crcspo approved the
agreement and would call an extra ses
sion of congress to ratify it. For this
reason the reports that Mr. Andrade
and Mr. Storrow will not return at
present owing to developments grow
ing out of the agitation against the
settlement is felt to embarrass and
possibly imperil the final adjustment,
which had beeu confidently expected
at an early day.
I'p to the present time President
Crespo has not called an extra session,
and thirty days must expire after the
call before congress meets. This has
led to a question whether Venezuela
fliould bear the heavy expense of an
extra session convening only one
month before the regular session of
Feb 20.
The Venezuela papers which reached
Washington on the last steamer are
being carefully scauned. but they are
very guarded and appear to le subject
to some government advisement on
the subject. The arrival of Mr.
Andrade and Mr. Storrow and their
conferences with President Crespo are
not mentioned, the only reference be
ing an eulogistic welcome to Mrs. Stor
row. La Liberal treats the settlement
as advantageous and says it not only
aids Venezuelans, but establishes a
great precedent by which the United
States "stands as a sentinel" in front
of the American republics against Eu
ropean greed and dominion.
The adverse agitation now reported
and Mr. Andrade's determination to
defer his return makes the acceptance
of the treaty less assured, though in
diplomatic circles it is believed Ven
ezuela in tinie will accept because of
the seeming affront whii-h adverse ac
tion would be to the United States.
President Crespo has accepted the
treaty, and thus far his influence has
been exceedingly potent in shaping the
policy of his natiou.

Huge Cavern Whose Walls Bear

Winona, Minn.. Dec 13.—A curious
cave has been discovered or rediscov

here. It is in an unfrequented locality
and the entrance is reached after a
tramp on low .-jnd marshy bottoms.
Until lately this cave has been consid

recently a local scientist, in reading a
work of the great explorer. Jonathan
Carver, noticed he had made mention
of a wonderful Indian picture cave,
situated near La Moille. the walls of
which were one mass of Indian writ

The cave has a semi-circular en

cave is a large room, oblong in shape.
This chqmber is a hundred feet long,

one end bubbles up a little spring
which flows out into the marsh below.
The walls are found to be a mass of

writings have been partially destroyed
by the falling down of large portions

SAN FRANCISCO CHURCH SCANDAL
FORCIBLY RECALLED.

Overman, the Principals In tbe
Case. Aecldeatnlly Meet In a Sal

nent Women of. San Francisco
Suicide as a Result of the Scan­
dal.
Chicago, Dec.
13.—"The
Lord saves—
he has saved me—of all sinners the
lowest." Uttered with fervor, these
words rang from the lips of a young
woman at a Salvation Army meeting
in Willard hall. As she spoke her
eyes wandered over the little sea of
heads bowing in prayer.
At the sound of her voice one of the
heads turned involuntarily toward her.
A man with a palid face started as
though to rise. The eyes of the two
met for a moment and there was a
flash of recognition. Then the man re
covered control of himself. He re
sumed his seat and through the re
mainder of the service sat with bowed
head and shamefaced mein. Few in
the audience saw the little scene.
There two were the principals in the
notorious Overman-Brown church trial
in San Francisco. Rev. O. C. Brown
and Miss Mattie Overman. At the
close of the trial Miss Overman went
among the Crittenden workers and
was made one of the little army.
Henccforth she was known as Sister
Martha. It was while on her way to
Washington. D. C.. where she goes t
assist. Mrs. Emily Waller Barrett in
rescue work, that Sister Martha hap
pened into Willard hall. When the
meeting was over she went out and
went straight to the Anchorage mis
sion. there to address an audience of
young women. Rev. Mr. Brown, when
the meeting was over, went his own
way. and that brief glance during the
services was their only meeting. What
the clergyman is doing in Chicago no
one seems to know. Shortly after the
trial he left San Francisco and drifted
East, to be lost sight of until this dra
matic meeting with the woman whose
name was once linked with his own.
Dr. Brown has issued a statement
in which he denounces Miss Overman
as a perjurer. He says that instead of
him lieing ashamed at the meeting it
was she who became confused and left
the hall.
DRIVEN TO DEATH.
Strangle Case of the Snlcide of Mrs.
Cooper and Daughter.
San Francisco. Dec. 13.—Mrs. Sarah
H. Cooper and her daughter, Harriet
Cooper, were found dead in their home
in this city this morning, with the gas
turned on and every evidence of sui
cide.
Mrs. Cooper was president of the
Kindergarten association, and her
daughter was deputy superintendent.
Mrs. Cooper had lived here thirty
years and was widely known as an
educator, philanthropist and writer.
She was president of the Women's
Press association, president of the
Women's Suffrage association, and
was prominent as an officer of the
W. C. T. LT. For many years she
taught the largest bible class in the
city, at the First Congregational
church, her class numbering several,
hundred adults. She was also assis
tant pastor of the church under the
pastorate of Rev. C. O. Brown.
In her will, written yesterday, she re
quests that the body of herself and her
daughter be not taken to the morgue.
When the scandal concerning Dr.
Brown was first talked about Mrs,
Cooper stood by the pastor and ex
pressed confidence in him. letter de
velopments caused her to change her
mind, and she and her daughter be
came his most prominent opponents
and accusers after Mrs. Davidson.
Much bitterness in church circles was
engendered by Mrs. Cooper's state
ments on the witness stand at the
church trial. Miss Cooper was even
more pronounced than her mother iu
opposition to Dr. Brown. This action
estranged many old friends and the
suicide of mother and daughter is as
cribed to the brooding over coldness
and snubs from former friends. No
woman on the Pacific.coast has been
so prominent for a generation as Mrs.
Cooper, who has often preached in
Congregational pulpits and has been
engaged in all departments of Chris
tian work. She formerly resided in
New Orleans and acted as nurse dur
ing the war. Her husbaud and other
children died in New Orleans. Her
tragic end has caused an immense sen
sation in this city.

nnd Collections Were Poor.
Duluth, Minn., Dec. 13.—The Nation
al Bank of Commerce failed to open
for business this morning. A notice
posted on the doors stated that, ow
ing to the inability to make any money
in the business the directors "had de
cided to stop. The notice also stated
that the bank expected to pay depos
itors at an early date. The'bank is
capitalized at $200,000 and has $30,000
surplus. Its deposits have been grad
ually but steadily drawn down since
the failure of the Security bank, and
it lias been unable to make any profit
for some time. Collections were hard
and c-uhl not keep up with the with
drawals. its deposits at this time are
quite small, far less than its capital,
and it owes Eastern banks, as redis
count. something l.ke $4,000. E. XV.
Matter is cashier. The deposits of the
bank four mouths ago were $200,000.
At the time of closing last evening
they were only $50,000. This leaves
Duluth with only two banks of any
considerable size.

LtMllKR BUSINESS.
According to the Yearly Rmnd-l'p
by tbe Lmnbcrten.
Minneapolis. Dec. 13. The "New
Year's Day" of the lnmlier trade has
come and goue. and tbe annual round
up of the stocks on hand has beeu
made by the Mississippi Valley Lum
berman. The figures show a heavy
•decrease from a year ago, and also
that the local consumption has been
much smaller during 1890 thau during
1805. The Lumberman comments as
follows:
In the lumber column it will be
noticed that the stock in the hands of
the Minneapolis wholesaler is alio lit
60,000,000 feet less than a year ago.
This would indicate, were all other
things equal, that the trade of the past
year had been better than usual but.
as other things have not been equal,
nothing of the kind is true. The pro
duction of lumber during tbe year has
been nearly ISO,000,000 feet less than
last season, so it is plainly evident
that the business of the year has been
smaller than it Avas last year. Of this
decrease in business the shipping trade
has stood a decrease of about 88,000,
000 feet since the beginning of the
year, while the local consumption has
fallen off about 34,000,000 feet."
NORMAL SCHOOL NEEDS.
State Board Discusses Legislative
Appropriations.
St. Paul, Dec. 13.—The state normal
school board met at the state capitol.
All the members were present except
Mr. Clark of Maukato and Mr. Grinde
land of Wairen. Authority was grant
ed to the St. Cloud normal to give free
tuition for one year to pupils attending
the kindergarten. The committee on
legislatiou was authorized to prepare
and have printed for the use of the
legislature a statement of the work
and needs of the normal schools, the
expense of printing not to exceed $100.
The requirements of the schools were
considered. St. Cloud wants money to
complete its dormitory and Winona
also wants a new dorn itory. The peo
ple of Duluth have, donated a live
acre tract and want money for the
erection of a normal school building.
The board favors thesg propositions,
but the improvements will depend on
the size of tbe appropriation by the
legislature. The Moorherd school is
satislied with what it received two
years ago and Mr. Comstock stated
that Moorhead would not ask for any
thing this year. The Mankato school
was also reported in good condition
and will not ask for any extraordinary
appropriations.
