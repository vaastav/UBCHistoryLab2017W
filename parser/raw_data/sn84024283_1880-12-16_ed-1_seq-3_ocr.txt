To th Senate and Bouse of Ileprttentatirtt:
I roHgratjJlate yon on the continued and
lncrettfer&w prosperity of our country. By the
lavoniM Divine! Providence we have been

oppoitMty"ito the "people of the United
State. tt exhibit to. the world a significant ex
anipliicaUno peaceful and safe transmission
of tlW-pdwer and authority of government
iroirfflrtl public servants whose terms of office
are about' to )5rpire,to their newly-chosen
successor Thi4xauaple can not fail to im
press . profoiindy, thoughtful people of other
countries with tpd advantages which Bepub
lican i InWtrtntionS- afford. The immediate.
generaladchjoerful acquiescence of all good
citizens, in Win .result ol the election, gives
gratifying assurance fo our country, and to
Its frleh'fJs throughout the world, that a Gov
ernment stued on the free consent of an in
telligent rand - patriotic people possesses ele
mentr'of strength,t ability and permanency
not found in any other form of government.
Continued opposition to the full and free en
joyment; of the rights of citizenship, conferred
upon the colored "people by the recent amend
ments to' t,ne Constitution, still prevails in
several of the-late slaveholding States. It
haaptrliKps.tiot been manifested in the re
cenCeluctionito any large extent in acts of vi
olence or intimidation. It has, however, by
fradfilerit practices in connection with the
ballot,-with the regulations as to the places
andtiianncr of voting, and with counting, re
turning and canvassing the votes cast, in suc
cessfully defeating the exercise of the right
preserVirtrve of all rights, the right of suf
fragsy whlcl" t he Constitution expressly con
fers tpqm;ur enfranchised citizens.
Iwjf JEH ax-kiohxs amendments.
It ifttlie desire of the good people of the whole
country that sectionalism us a factor in our
politic? should disappear. They prefer that
no fcetfarri:'Of ; the country should be
unit( f in - solid - opposition ' to any other
section,,. ..The .disposition to refuse a
prompt .. and hearty obedience to
the eutidl1 rights Amendments to the Constitution-,
ulijiiuat now stands in the way of a
complete obliteration of sectional lines in our
political exjriteats. As long as either of these
amendments-1s flagrantly violated or disre
garded, it- is safe to assume that the people
who placed tlxnn in the Constitution, as em.
bodying the legitimate results of the war for
the Union, and who believe them to be wise
andm-fcessttrv, will continue to act together,
and to-insist that they shall- bo obeyed. The
paramount question still is as to the enjoy
ment o', the right, by everv American citizen
who' litis the ' requisite rpiftlilieations, to freely
cast his vote and to have it honestly counted.
With this question rightly settled, the country
will be velieved of the contentions of the past ;
bygones will indeed be bygones ; and political
and pMrty issues with respect to economy and
efficiency1 of Administration, internal inipVove
inents, --thf tariff, domestic taxation, educa
tion, finaiDce, and other important subjects,
will tnn receive their full share of attention ;
but resistance to and nullificxtion of the re
suits oi the. war will unite together in resolute
purpose lor their stiporc all who maintain
the authority of the Government and the per
petuity of the I'nion, and who adequately
apprerijrtcJfwTIjie of the victory achieved.
This determination proceeds from no hostile
sentiment or feeling to any part of the people
of our country, or to any of their interests.
The inviolability of the amendments rests
upon the f uiuluint ntal principle of our Gov
ernment, They are the solemn expression of
the will of the ieople of the United States.
The sentiment that the constitutional rights
of all our citizens must be maintained does not
grow weaker. It will continue to control the
Government of the country. Happily, tle
history oS -the lata election shows that in
many parts of the country where opposition
to the Fifteenth Amendment has heretofore
prevailcdrit is diminishing, and is likely to
cease altogetherif firm and well-considered
action is taken by Congress. I trust the House
of Representatives and Senate, which havo
the rilit to judge of the elections, returns,
and qualifications of their own members, will
see to.' It that every case of violation of the
letteiiiH spirit of the Fifteenth Amendment is
thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit
from'such violatlbn shall accrue to any per
son or par$; ; It Hvill be the duty of the Exec
utive, with sufficient appropriations for the
pui-po-ic,.;, prosecute unsparingly all who
nave beon, engaged in depriving citizens of
the rights guaranteed to them by the Consti
tution. It is hot, however, to be forgotten that the
best and su rest guarantee of the primary rights
of citizenship is to be found in that capacity
for sejf -protection which can belong only to a
people whose right to universal suffrage is
supported by universal education. The means
at the command of the local and State author
itietfWreln many cases, wholly inadequate to
furnish free instruction to all who need it.
This is especially true where, before cmimci
patitn the education of the people was ncg
IectecLor prevented, in the Interests of slav
ery, firmly convinced that the subject of
poptmfr education deserves the earnest atten
tion of the people of the whole country, with
a view to xtte html 'comprehensive action by
the Government of the United States, I re
speetfullv recommend that Congress, by suit
able legislation and with proper safeguards,
supplement the local educational funds in the
severM "States where the urave duties and re
sponsibilities of citizenship have been devolv- H

purpose grants of the public lands, and, it
necessary, bV appropriations from the Trea-'.
sury of the United States. Whatever Govern
ment fan.' fairly do to promote free popular
education 'aught to be done. Wherever gen
eral education is found, peace virtue, and
social 'order .prevail, and civil and religious
liberty are secure.
THB CITIL SERVICE.
In- uT i former annual messages, I have
asked the attention of Congress to the urgent
necessity of a reformation of the civil-service
system of the Government. ' My views con
cerning "the dangers of patronage, or ap
pointments for personal or partisan consid

vise a justnalfonn and etBcierrt systemof
competititivf examinations, and to super
vise thowpplicatiQn of the eamu xUrpughout

am persumled that the facilities which such a
comuii8siinwf U afford for testing the fitness
of those- wbfaply for office will not only be
as welcome relief to members of Consrress
as it will be totlie' President and eads of
Departments but that it wilk-ntso,gratly
tend to remove the causes of embarrassment
which now inevitably and constantly attend
the conflicting claims of patronage between
the Legislative and executive Departments.
The most effectual check upon the pernicious
competition of influence and official favorit
ism, in the bestowal of office, will be the sub
stitution of an open competition of merit be
tween the applicants, in which every one can
make his own record with the assurance that
his success will depend upon this alone.
I also recommend such legislation as, while
leaving eirery onTeer as free a any "other citi
zen to express -bis political) opinions and to
use his. means for their advancement, Shall
also enable him to.feel as -sate as (my private
citizen in refusing all demands upoii his sal

should thuSguMnS&tee trueliberty and justice
toallwho'arengagedii the public s'serviee,
and likewise cvutam strip nent prQisions
against the use of official autliority to coerce
the political action of private citizens or of
official subordinates, is greatly to be desired.
The most serious obstacle, however, to an
improvement of the civil service, and es
pecially to a reform in the method of apioiiit
nient and removal, has been found to be the
practice, under wliat is known as the spoils
system, by which the appointing power has
been so largely encroached upon by mem
bers of Congress. The first step in the re
form of the civil service must be a complete
divorce between Congress and the Executive
in the matter of appoiutmcnts. The corrupt
ing doctrine that " to the victors belong the
spoils," is inseparable from Congressional
patronage as tne established rule and prac
tice of parties i power, (ltoomos to be un
derstood by applicant for olftce,"afld by the
people generally, that Heiiresentatives and
Senators au-e entitled to dwlrtirse the patron
age ojc tfaeir resifective ?dfeic and States.
It is lioS-neces'sHry to recite at length the evils
resulting from this invasion of the Executive
functions. The true principles of govern
ment on the subject of appointments to office,
as stated in the National Conventions
of the leading parties of the
country, have again and again been
approved by the American people.and have not
been oallctMn question in auyquarter. These
authentic' expressions of pabiic opinion upon
this all-important subjuct, are the statement
of principles that belong to tlie constitutional
structure oftlie Government.
" ITnder the Constitution, tlie Pj-esident and
Heads of Departments are to make nomina
tions for office. The Senate is to advise and
consent to appointments, and the House of
Representatives is to accuse and prosecute
faithless officers. The best interest of the pub
lic service demands that these distinctions be
respected ; that Senators and Representatives,
who may be judges and accusers, should not
dictate appointment to office." To this end
the co-operation of the legislative Depart
ntent of tlie Government is required, alike by
the necessities of the case and by public opin
ion. Members of Congress will not be relieved
from the demands made upon them with ret
entia4o appointments to office until, by leg
islative enactment, the pernicious practice is
condemned and forbidden.
It is therefore recommended that an act be
passed defining', the relations of members of
Congress with respect to appointment to of
fice by the President ; and 1 also recommend
that the provisions of Section 170 and of the
sections following, of the Kevisdr, Statutes,
couipritf ngheTenure-of:Oilica act, of March
2, IStiT, be repealed.
Believing that to reform the system and
methods of the Civil service in our country is
one of the hfglieSt Mitl most imperative duties
of statesmanship, and that it can be perma
nently done only by the co-operation of the
Legislative and Executive Departments of the
Government, I again commend the whole sub
ject to your considerate attention.
I'MLlUASl.
It 19 the recognized duty and purpose of the
people of the United States to suppress polyg
amy where it now exists in our Territories and
to prevent its extension. Faithful and zealous
efforts have been made by the United States
authorities inl'tah toenlorce the laws against
it. Experience has shown that the legislation
upon this subject, to be effective, requires ex
tensive niodiucatlon and amendment.-1-The
longer action is delayed the more difficult it
will be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt
and decided measures are necessary. The
Mormon sectarian organization which upholds
polygamy has the wliolo. power of making and
executing the local leutslatlon of the Terri
tory. "By its control or the grand and petit
Junes, it possesses large influence over the
administration ot justice. Exercising, as the
heads of this sect dp,' the local political
power of the Territory; tliey are able to ma Ice
ettective their hostility to the laws of
Congress on the subject of polygamy, and,
in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polyga
my will not be abolished if the enforcement
of the law depends on those who practice and
uphold the crime. It can only be suppressed
by taking away the political power of the
sect which encourages and sustains tt. The
power of Congress to enact suitable laws to
protect the Territories is ample. . It is not a
case of half-way measures. - Th political
power of the Mormon sect is Increasing; it
controls now one of our wealthiest and most
populous Territories. It is extending steadily
into other Territories. Wherever 'it-goes it
establishes polygamy and sectarian political
power. The sanctity of marriage and the
family relation are the. corner-stone of our
American sociofyjand ctvitizatfon --Religious
liberty and the ieparatioru ol. Church and
State are among tlie elementary Ideas of free
institutions. To re-establish the interests and
Srinciples which polygamy and Mormonism
ave imperiled, and to fully re open to intel
ligent and virtuous immigrants of all creeds
that part of our domain which has been, in a
gt eat degree, closed to general immigration
by intoleraut and immoral institutions, it is
recommended that the government or the
Territory of Utah be reorganized.
I recommend that Congress provide for the
fovernment of Utah by a Governor and
udges, or Commissioners, appointed by the
Pre.-ident and continued by-the Senate a
government analogous to rtlre'ipTOvlsfoTfal
government established for the Territory
northwest of the Ohio, by the ordinance of
1787. If, however, it is deemed best to con

Our relations with all foreign countries have
been those of undisturbed peace, and have
presented no occasion tor concern as to their
continued maintenance.
nir friendlv relations with the German Em
pire continue withont interruption. At the
recent International Exhibition of Fish and
Fisheries at Berlin, the participation of the
United states, notwithstanding the haste with
which thocommlsstori was forced to make its
preparations, was extremely successful and
meritorious, winning for private exhibitors
numerous awards or a high clas. and for the
country at large the principal prize ot honor
offered by his Majesty the Emperor. The re
sults of this great success can not but be ad
vantageous to this important and growing
industry. There have beenom- questions
raised between the two Governments as to
the proper effect and intsrpretation of our
treaties of naturalization,'lJUt reoent dis
patches from our Minister at Berlin show that
tavorable progress is making, toward an un
derstanding, in accordance-with the Views ot
this Government, which makes anl admits no
distinction whatever between the Tights of a
native and a naturalized citizen of -the Vnited
State. In practice, the complaints of no

OCR SISTER REMTBLICS.
In my lastannual message I expressed a hope
that the prevalence of quiet on the border be
tween this country and Mexico would soon be
come so assured as to justify the modification
of the orders, then In force, to our military
commanders. In regard to crossing the fron
tier, without encouraging such disturbances
as would endanger the peace of the two coun
tries. Events moved in accordance with these
expectations, and the orders were according
ly withdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of our
nwn eitixens and th Mexican Government.
J Subsequently, the peace of the border was
again uisturoeu oy a savage roray, nnuer me
command of Chief Victorio, but, by the com
bined and harmonious action of the military
forces of both countries, his band has been
broken up and substatially destroyed.
. There Is reason to behove that the obstacles
which have so long prevented rapid and con
veniept communication between the United
States and Mexico by railway, are on the
point of disappearing, and that several im
portant enterprises of this character will soon
be set on foot which can not fail to contribute
largely to the prosperity of the two countries.
ew envoys front Guatemala, Colombia,
Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua have re
cently arrived ut this capital, whose distinc
tion and enlightenment afford the best guar
antee of the continuance of friendly relations
between ourselves and these sister Republics.
The relations between this Government and
that of the United States of Colombia have
engaged public attention during the past
vear, mainly by reason of the project of an
interoceanic canal across the Isthmus of Pan
ama, to be built by private capital under a
concession from the Colombian Government
for that purpose. The treaty obligations sub
sisting between the United States and Colom
bia, by which we guarantee the neutrality of
the transit and the sovereignty and property
of Colombia in the Isthmus, make it necessa
ry that the conditions under which so stu
pendous a change In the region embraced in
this guarantee should be effected transform
ing, as it would, this Isthmus, from a barrier
between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, into
a gateway and thoroughfare between them,
for the navies and the merchant-ships of the
world should receive the approval of this
Government, as being compatible with the
discharge of these obligations on our part,
and consistent with our Interests as the prin
cipal commercial power ol the Western Hem
isphere. The views which I expressed In a
special message to Congress in March last, in
relation to this project, I deem it my duty to
press upon your attention. Subsequent con
sideration has but confirmed the opinion
"that it is the right and duty of the United
States to assert and maintain such supervis
ion and authority over any interoceanic canal
across the Isthmus that connects North and
South America as will protect our national
interest."
The war between the Republic of Chili on
the one hand, and the nllied Republics of
Peru and Bolivia on the other, still continues.
This Government has not felt called upon to
interfere in a contest that is within the bel
ligerent rights of the parties as inde
pendent States.:; AVe have, however, always
held ourselves in readiness to aid in accom
modating their ditterence, and have at differ
ent times reminded both belligerents of our
willingness to render such service.
Our good offices, in tills direction, were re
cently accepted by all the belligerents, and it
was hoped they would prove efficacious ; but
-1 regret to announce that the measures, which
the Ministers of the United States at Santiago
and Lima were authorized to take, with the
view to bring about a peace, were not success
ful. In the course of the war some questions
have arisen affecting neutral rights; in all of
these the Ministers of tlie United States have,
under their instructions, acted with prompt
ness and energy in protection of American in
terests. The relations of the United States with the
Empire of Brazil continue to be most cordial,
and their commercial intercourse steadily in
creases, to their mutual advantage.
OCR NATIONAL FINANCES.
The condition. of the financial affairs of the
Government, as shown by the report of the
Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisiactory.
It is befieved that the present financial situ
ation of the United States, whether consider
ed with respect- to trade, currency, credit,
growing wealth, or the extent and variety of
our resources, is more favorable than that of
any other country of our time, and has never
been surpassed by that of any country at any
period of its history. All our industries are
thriving; the rateof interest is low; new rail
roads are being constructed ; a vast Immigra
tion is increasing our population, capital, and
labor; new entcrpi Is-es in great number are in
progress; and ourcoiiiineretal relations with
other countries are improving.

thereto the sum of $73,90417.41, being $35,972,
973.86 in excess of the actual requirements for
the year. "
The aggregate of the revenues from all
sources during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1880, was $333,526,610.98, an increase over the
preceding year of $59,699,426.5. The receipts
thus far, of the current year, together withthe
estimated receipts for the remainder of the
year, amount to $350,000,000, which will be
sufficient to meet the estimated expenditures
of the year, and leave a surplus of $90,000,000.
It is fortunate that this large surplus reve
nue occurs at a period when it may be di
rectly applied to the pavment of the public
debt soon to be redeemable. No public duty
has been more constantly cherished in the
United States than the policy of paying the
Nation's debt as rapidly as possible.
The debt of the united States, less cash In

SILVER COHTAOB.
-' At the time of the passage of the act bow
in force requiring the coinage of silver dol
lars, fixing their valne and giving them legal
tender character, it was believed by many of
the supporters of the measure, that the silver
dollar, which it autli-.r.zed, would speedily
become, under the operations of the law, of
equivalent value to the gold doUar. There
were other supporters of the bill, who, while
they doubted a to the probability of this re
sult, nevertheless were willing to give the ex
periment a fair trial, with a view to stop the
coinage, If experience should prove that the
sliver dollar authorized by the bill continued
to be of less commercial value than the stand
ard gold dollar.
The coinage of silver dollars nnder
the act referred to, began In March,
1378, and has been continued as
required by the - act. The average rate
per month to the present time lias been
$2,276,402. The total amount coined prior to the
first of November last was $72,347,750. Of this
amount $47,084,450 remain in the Treasury,
and only $25,768,281 are In the bands of the
1eopIe. A constant effort has been made to
Leep this currency in circulation, and consid
erable expense has been necessarily Incur
red for this purpose, but its return to the
Treasury is prompt and sure. Contrary to
the confident anticipation of the friends of
the measure at the time of Its adoption, the
value of the silver dollar, containing 412V
grains of silver, has not increased. During
the year prior to the passage of the bill au
thorizing its coinage, the market value of the
silver which it contained was from ninety to
ninety-two cents, as compared with the
standard gold dollar. During the last year
the aversige market value of the silver dollar
has been eighty-eight and a half cents.
It is obvious, that the legislation of the last
Congress in regard to silver, so far as it was
based on an anticipated rise in tne value of
silver as a result of that legislation, has failed
to produce tlie effect then predicted. The
longer the law remains in force, requiring as it
does the coinage of a nominal dollar, Hhich,
in reality, is not a dollar, the greater becomes
the danger that this country will be forced to
accept a single metal as the sole legal
standard of value, in circulation, and this a
standard of less value than it purports to be
worth in the recognized monev ot the world.
The Constitution ot the United States,
sound financial principles, and our best inter
ests, all require that the country should have
as its legal-tender money, both gold and sil
ver coin, of an intrinsic value, as bullion,
equivalent to that which, upon its face, it
purports to possess. The Constitution, in ex
press terms, recognizes both gold and silver
as the only true legal-tender money. To
banish either of these metals from our cur
rency is to -narrow and limit the circulating
medium of exchange to the disparagement of
important interests. The United States pro
duces more silver than any other country,
and is directly interested in maintaining it as
one of the two precious metals which furnish
the coinage or the world. It will, in my
Judgment, contribute to this result if Congress
will repeal so muctl of existing legislation as
requires the coinage of silver dollars contain
ing only 412 grains of silver, and in its stead
authorize the Secretary of tho Treasury to
coin silver dollars of equivalent value as bul
lion, with gold dollars. This will defraud no
man, aud will be in accordance witU
familiar precedents. Congress, on sev
eral occasions, has altered the ratio of value
between gold and silver, in order to establish
it more nearly in accordance with the actual
ratio of value between the two metals.
In financial legislation every measure In the
direction of greater fidelity in tlie discharge
of pecuniary obligations, has leen found by
experience to diminish the rates of interest
which debtors are required to pay, and to in
crease the facility with which money can lie
Obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our
own recent financial history shows how surely
money becomes abundant whenever confi
dence in the exact performance of moneyed
obligations is established.
...c. AUJtV.
The Secretary of War reports that the ex
penditures of the War Department for the
fiscal year ended June 30, lusn, were SW.924,
773 03. The appropriations for this Depart
ment, for the current fiscal year, amount to
$n,s:?,:5o 40.
With respect to the Army, the Secretary in
vites attention to the fact that its streng'th is
limited by statute (swtion 1115. Revised stat
utes) to not more than HO.OOO enlisted men, but
that provisos contained in appropriation bills
have limited expenditures to the enlistment
of but 25,000. It is believed the full legal
strength is the least possible force at which
the present organization cn be maintained,
having in view etliciency.dim-ipline and econ
omy. While the enlistment ol tuis force would
udd somewhat to the appropriation tor pay of
the Army, the saving made in other reiqx-ets
would be more than an equivalent for this
additional outlay, and the efficiency of tho
Army would be largely Increased.
The rapid extension of the railroad svstem
west of the Mississippi Uiver, and the great
tide ot settlers which has llowed in upon new
territory, impose in the military an entire
change "of policy. The maintenance of small
posts along wupon and stnue routes of travel
Is no longer necesssrj-. Permanent quarters
at points selected. of a more siibstantiuichar
acter than those heretofore constructed, will
be required. Under existing laws, perma
nent buildings can not be erected without the
sanction of Congress, and when sales of mili
tary sites and buildings have been author
ized, tho moneys received have revertea to
the Treasury, and could only become avail
able throng!) a new appropriation. It is rec
ommended that provision be made, by a
general sratute, for the sale of such aban
doned military posts and buildings as are
found to be unnecessary, and for the applica
tion of the proceeds to the construction of
other posts. While many of tho present posts
are of but slight value for military purposes,
owing to the changed condition of tho coun
try, their occupation Is continued at great
expense and inconvenience, because they af
ford the only available shelter for troops.
The absence of a large number of officers of
the line, in uctive duty, from their regiments,
is a serious deti intent to the maintenance of
the service. The constant demand for small
detachments, each ot which should be com
manded by a commissioned officer, and the
various details of officers for necessary service
away from . their command, occasions a
-carcity in the number required for company
duties. With a view to lessening this drain to
some extent, it is recommended that the law
authorizing the detail of officers from the ac
tive list as professors of tactics and military
science at certain colleges and universities, be
so amended as to provide that all such details
be made from the retired list of the Army.
Attention is asked to the necessity ot pro
viding by lesislation for organizing, arming,
and disciplining the active militia of the
country, and liberal appropriations are re-cot-imended
in this Behalf . The reports of
the Adjutant-General of tlie Army and the
Chief ot Ordnance touching this subject fully
set forth its importance.
Especial attention I asked to the report of
the Chief of Engineers upon the condition of
our national defenses. From a personal in
spection of manv of the fortifications refsired
to, the Secretary is able to emphasize the rec
ommendations made, and to state that their
incomplete and defenseless condition is dis
creditable to the country. While other na
tions have been increasing their means for
carrying on offensive warfare and attacking
maritime cities, we have been dormant in
piaparation for defense; nothing ot Impor
tance has been done toward strengthening
and finishing our casemated works since our
late civil war, during which the great guns of
modern warfare and the heavy armor of mod
ern fortifications and ships came Into use
among the nations., and our earthworks left,
bv a sudden failure of appropriations some
years since, in all stages of incompletion, are
now being rapidly destroyed by the elements.
IMPROVEMENT OF HAVIGABLB WATERS.
The two great rivers of the North American
Continent, the Mississippi and the Columbia,
have their navigable waters wholly within the
limits of the United States, and are of vast
importance to our Internal and foreign com
merce. The permanency of the important
work en the South Pass of the Mississippi
River seems now .to be assured. There has
been no failure whatever In the maintenance
of the maximum channel during the six
months ended August , last. This experi
ment has opened a broad deep highway to
the ocean, and is an improvement, upon the
permanent success of which congratulations
may be exchanged among people abroad and
at home, and especially among the com
munities of the Mississippi Valley, whose
commercial exchanges float in an unobstruct
ed channel safely to and from Zte sea.
A comprehensive improvement of the Mis
eisslppi and its tributaries is a matter of tran
scendent importance. These great water
ways comprise a system of inland transpor
tation spread like net-work over a large por
tion of the United States, and navigable to
the extent of many thousands of miles. Fro
ducers an 4 consumers alike have a common
interest in such unequaled facilities for cheap
transportation. Geographically, commercial
ly and politically they are the strongest tie
between the various sections of the country.
These channels of communication and inter
change are the property of the Nation. Its
jurisdiction Vs paramount over their waters,
and the plainest principles of pnblic interest
require their careful and intelligent supctvi
sion, with a view totheirprotection. Improve
ment, and the enhancement of their useful
ness. The channel of the Columbia River, for a
distance of about one hundred miles from its
mouth, is obstructed by a succession of bars
which occasion serious delays in navigation,
and heavy expense for lijjutejae and towage.
A depth of at least twenty feex at low tide
houid be secured and. maintained, tojneet
the requirements of the ' extensive and
growing inland and ocean commerce It sub
serves. The most urgent need., however, for
this great water way M a permanent lmprove
ment of the channel at Ut month - til the
river.
From Columbia River to Baa Fran
cisco, distance of ' over - ' six
hundred - miles, there is no -n arbor
on our Pacific coast which can - be
approached during stormy weather. - An ap.
propriation of $150,000 was made by the Forty -fifth
Congress for the commencement oil
break-water and harbor of refuge, to be locat
ed at some point between the straits of Fnca
and San Francisco, at which the necessities
of commerce, local and general, will be beat
accommodated. The amount appropriated la
thought to he quite inadequate tor tne pur
noae intended. The cost of the work, when
finished, will be very great, owing to the want
of natural advantages for a site at any point
on the coast between the designated limits,
and it has not been thought to be advisable to
undertake the work without a larger appro
priation. I commend the matter to the at
tention of Congress. S ... r V
The completion of tM new building for tae
War Department is urgently needed, and lee
estimates for continuing tt construction are
especially recommended. -
CKXERAL ORAWT.
I commend to the attention of Congress the
great services of tlie CoMmander-m-Chief of
our armies during the war for the Union, whose
wise, firm, and patriotlo conduct did so much
to bring that momentous conflict to a clone.
The legislation of the United States contains
many precedents for the recognition of dis
tinguished military merit, authorizing rank
and emoluments to be conferred for eminent
services to the country. An act of Congress
authorizing the appointment of a Captain
General of the Army, with suitable provisions
relating to compensation,- retirement, and
other details, would, in my Judgment, be al
together fitting and proper, and would be
warmly approved bv the country.
THE MAVT.
The report of the Secretary of the Xavy
exhibits the successful and satisfactory man
agement of that Department during the last
fiscal year. The total expenditures lor the
year were $12,916,639 45, leaving unexpended
at the close of the year $2,141,682 23 of the
amount of available appropriations. The ap
propriations for the present fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1881, are $15,095,061 45; and the
total estimates for the next fiscal vear end
ing June 30, 1882. are $13,K3,75I 61. '.Tlie
amount drawn by warrant from July 1, 1880,
to November l.lsso, is (6,041,670 45J
The recommendation of the secretary of
the Navy, that provision bo made for the es
tablishment of tome form of civil government
for the people of Alaska, is approved. At
present there is no protection of persons or
property in that Territory, except such a is
afforded by the oflicers of the United States
ship Jamestown. This vessel was
dispatched to Sitka, because of the fear that,
without the immediate presence of the Na
tional authority, there was iin-ending danger
of anarchy. The steps taken to restore order
have been accepted In good faith by both
white and Indian inhabitants, and the'neces-
sit y tor this method of restraint does not. In
my opinion, now exist. If, however, the
Jamestown should be withdrawn, leaving the
people, as at present, without the ordinary,
judicial, and administrative authority of or
ganized ifcal government, serious conse
quences mieht ensue.
, TUB fOSTAL PEPARTMEKT.
The report of the Postmaster-Genera ex
hibits the continual growth and the high state
of efficiency of the postal service. The opera
tions of no Department of the Government,
perhaps, represent with greater ex.ictnetm the
increase in the population and thebiisinessnf
the country. In lio the jswtal receipts were
$S,.M8,OU7.40; In IScO the receipts were 13,315,.
479.34. All the Inhabitants of the country sre
directly and personally interested In having
proMr mail facilities, and naturally watch
the Post office very closely. This cateful over
sight on the purt of the people has proved a
constant stimulus to improvement. During
the pnt year there was un Increase of 2,1-H
Post-offices, and the mail route wereextend
ed 27,177 miles, makimt an additional annual
transportation of 10,f(d,l'.U mile. The reve
nues of the postal service for the ensuing year
are estimated at f34.st5.174. 10, and the ex
penditures at $I2,47.Y9:!2, leaving a deficiency
to be appropriated out ol the Treasury ot $3,
630,757.!0. The Universal PotaI Union hasrecclieil the
accession of almost all tho' countries and col
onics of the world lna-ntaining organized
postal services, and It is confidently exjecn d
that all the other countries and ooiotiiea now
outt-tdo the Union will unite therewith, thus
realizing the grand idea and aim ot the
founders of the Union, of forming, for pur
poses of International mail communication, a
ingle postal territory embracing the world,
with complete uniformity of postal charges
and conditions of international exchange for
all descriptions of co'-respondencc. To enable
the United States to do its full share of thia
great work, additional legislation Is asked, by
the I'ostmastcr-Gene'al, o whose recom
mendations especial attention is called.

that it would le w.se to encourage, by appro
priate legislation, tne establishment of Amer
ican line of steamers by our own citizens io
carry the walls between our own ior: and
those of Mexico, Central America, South

DEPARTMENT Or JUSTICE.
The necessity for additional provision, to
ntd In the transaction of the bus ness of the
Federal courts, becomes each year more ap
parent. Tho docke'sof the Supreme Court,
and of the t ircuit courts, in the greater num
ber of the circuits, are encumbered with the
constant accession of cases. In the former
court, and -in many Instances in the circuit
courts, yenrs in ervene lieiore It is practicable
to bring cases to a herning.
1 he Attomev-Gcneral recotnn ends the es
tablishment of an intermediate court of F.r
rors and Appeals. It is recommended that
the number of Judges of the Circuit Court . in
eache'renit, wi'h the exception of tin fr-ecotul
Circuit, should be increased by the ad
dition of anothet Judge; in the Second Cir
cuit that two sh'ukl be added; and that an
intermediate Appellate Court should be
formed in eacli circuit, tt consist of the Cir
cuit Judges an! the Circuit Justice, and that
in the event ol the absence of either Of these
Judges the place of the absent Judge should
be supplied by the Judge of one of the Dis
trict Courts in the circuit. Such an Appellate
Court could be safely Invested with large Jur
isdiction, and it decisions would satisfy suit
ors in tnanv cases where appeals would still
be allowed to the Sun.eme Gouit. The ex
pense incurred for this intermediate court
will require a very moderate increase of the
appropriations for the expenses of the De
partment of Justice. This reecomtnendation
is commended to the careful consideration ot
Congress.
It is evident that a delay of justice, In many
instances oppressive and disastrous to suit
ors, now neoeasartlv occurs In the Federa'
courts, which will in this way be remedied. -
-THE INTERIOR PEPARTMEKT THE IJIIilASS.
The report of the Secretary of the Interior
presents an elatiorate account of the opera
tions of that Department during the past
year. It gives me great pleasure to say that
our Indian affairs appear to be In a more
hopeful condition now than ever before. The
Indians have made gratifying progress in ag
riculture, herding, and mechanical pursuit.
Manv who were a few years ago in hostile
conflict with the Government are quietly set
tlisgdownon farms where they hote to make
their permanent homes, building houses and
engaging In the occupations of civillxee itiet
The introduction of the freighting business
among them has been remarkably fruitful of
good results, in giving many of them eeegn
nlal and remunerative employment, and lit
stimulating their ambition to earn their own
support. Their honesty, fidelity and efficiency
as carriers are highly prai-ed. The organiza
tion of a police force of Indians baa been
equally successful la maintaining law and or
dnr upon the reservations, and in exercis
ing a wholesome moral Influence among
the Indians themselves. I concur -with the
Secretary of the Interior In the recommenda
tion that the pay of this force be Increased,
as an inducement to the beat class of young
men to enter It.
Much care and attention baa been devoted
to the enlargement of educational facilities
for the Indiana. The means available for this
important object bars beea very inadequate.
A few additional boarding-sahools at Indian
agencies have been established, and the erec
tion of buildings has been begun for several
more, but an increase of the appropriations
for this interesting undertaking U greatly
needed to accommodate the large number of
Indian children of school-age. The number
offered by their parents from all parts of the
country for education in the Govrraiaeat'
schools Is much larger than can be aec-ommo-t
dated with the means at present available for
that purpose. The number ot Indian pu- tls
at the Normal School at Hampton, Virginia,
under the direction of Gen. Armstrong,
has been considerably increased and their
progress Is highly encouraging. The Indian
school established by the Interior Department
in 1879, at Carhale, Pennsylvania, under the
direction of Capt. Pratt, has been equally sue
cesstui. It lias now nearly two bun
dred pupils of both eexee, represent

n expressing the earnest hope that Congress
Will at this session take favorable action on
the bill providing for the allotment of land
on the tnflerent reservation In severalty to
tho Indians, with patent conferring lee-simple
title Inalienable lor a certain period, and
the eventual disposition of the residue of the
reservations, for general settlement, with the
consent and tor the lieneltt ot the Indiana, '
placing the latter under the equal prote-tku
of the jaws of tlie country. This measure, to
gether with a vigorous prosecution ol our edu

and etiecUve advance toward the solution of
the Indian problem, in preparing for the
gradual merging of our Indian imputation la

A large Increase Is reported In the disposal
of public lands tor settlement during the past
year, which marks the prosperous irro tu of
our agricultural Industry .and a vigorous move
ment of population toward our unocc-ipled
lands. As this movement proceeds, Ui odl
