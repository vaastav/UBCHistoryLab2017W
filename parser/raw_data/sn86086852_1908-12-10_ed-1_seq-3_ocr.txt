CONGRESS GETS
DOWN TO BUSINESS
TOWNSEND ON HAND WITH PRO
POSAL TO AMEND HEPBURN
RATE LAW.
REPRESENTATIVE SMITH WOULD
MAKE EXECUTIVE MORE
RESPONSIBLE.
ROOSEVELTS FOUR BATTLESHIP
PLAN SEEMS TO BE OUT
OF FAVOR.
Washington, Dec. 9. —Tne business
of both houses of congress was con
fined largely to listening to the read
ing of the president's message, but in
addition to this a few bills were in
duced in both houses. In the bouse
a number of bills were sent to con
ference. in addition, the speaker an
nounced the appointment of Higgins
of Connecticut, to the committee on
judiciary in place of Littlefield, re
tired, and ot Martin to the committee
on Indian affairs in place of Barker,
deceased. For the first time daring
the present congress there was a call
of the committee of the house, but no
measure was reported by any of them.
The miscellaneous work of the senate
consisted in the main of reference in
executive session of about 1,500 recess
nominations, which were yesterday
sent to the senate by the president
and the adoption of resolutions of re
gret on account of the death of mem
bers of the house who have passed
away since adjournment last May. Th*
senate adjourned for the day at 2
o’clock, and the house at 2:35.
To Amend Hepburn Rate Law.
Several important amendments to
the Hepburn railroad rate law were
proposed in hills introduced by Con
gressman Townsend of Michigan, one
of the most active advocates of r?
medial legislation along interstate
commerce lines.
One of the hills gives the interstate
commerce commission jiower to pro
hibit the faking effect of an advance
in rates in a case in which shippers in
dividually or collectively protest
against the advance prior to the ex
piration of the legal thirty days’ no
tice. The bill places the burden on
the carrier to show at a subsequent
hearing on the proposed rate that the
increased rate is just and reasonable.
Townsend would also give the ship
per the right and privilege of routing
and prescribing what connecting lines
a shipment shall take. He would have
t)i‘ law declare that in ease the ship
per designates no route rhe lowest pub
lished rat*‘ between the points of orig
in and of destination should apply.
Another amendment provides that ear
ners shall quote rates in writing upon
application aid give rates upon bills,
of lading upon request, and that rates
be reckoned therefrom. In the event
an error is made in these rates it is
provided that claims for recovery
shall be made only through the inter-1
state commerce commission.
More Care of Estimates.
If the bill which Representative
Smith of lowa introduced becomes a
law, more responsibility for estimates
for appropriations would be put upon
the executive officials. The bill pro
vides that in case the annual esti
mates for appropriations to meet the
running expenses of the government
exceed the sum estimated by the sec
retary of the treasury as the probable
revenues for that year, both sets of es
timates shall be submitted to the pres
ident. to the end that the latter may
give his advice as to how the esti
mates can best be reduced or how ad
ditional revenues may be raised, either
by loan or taxes.
Tariff Question Soon.
An executive meeting was held by
the ways am! means committee of the
house yesterday, presumably for the
purpose of selecting names of those
witnesses whom it is proposed to
subpoena to appear at the tariff hear
ings before the committee.
A short hearing was held by the
cimmittee and another has been set
for tomorrow. In order ro get an early
start on consideration of the new tar
iff bill it is believed the majority
members of the committee will mo©*
today ns a sub committee to *ake the
lirst active steps in framing the bill.
Committee Against Battleship.
While the house committee on naval
affairs has not given formal consider
ation ;o the proposed increase in the
navy, i; was learned yesterday that
members of the committee stand prac
tically the same as last winter, when
the authorization for the two battle-1
ships was made. That the committee
will vote down the proposition o'.
President Roosevelt for four battle
ships is now indicated.
The attitude of the leaders in the
senate, declaring for an appropriation
for two battleships annually, is saio
ti appeal to many members of the
hiuse, and a majority of the member
ship is willing to have such a policy
approved in the house. To go furthei
than that it is claimed would endan
ger the passage of a satisfactory riv
ers and harbors bill.
Roosevelt Urges Army Measure.
An emergency volunteer array mea
sure was advocated by President
Roosevelt in a special message to con
gress and a draft of the bill accompa
nying the message was introduced in
the senate by Senator Cullom. The
president says the bill is intended to
replace the present law which he de
clares is faulty and wholly inadequate
'ey a speedy and proper organization
of a volunteer force. The proposed
bill is elastic; under its provisions a
force of 2 000000 men could be raised
as well as one of 50.000.
To Arrange for Inauguration.
A resolution was introduced in the
senate yesterday by Mr. Knox pro
viding for the appointment of three
representatives to make necessary
arrangements for the inauguration ot
President-elect Taft. The resolution
was adopted.

who, surrounded by his companions

Holt then accosted the woman ana

MURDER MISTER!
FROM ST. LOUIS
FRANCIS D. HIRSCHBERG SHOT
IN HALL OF HIS OWN
HOME.
St. Louis, Mo., Dec. 9.—Francis D.
Hirschberg, prominent in the Roman
(’atholic church and personal friend of
Archbishop Blennon, also well known
in club and bu iness circles and as a
director of the Louisiana Purchase
exposition, was shot and killed at his
home, 3818 Lindell boulevard, early
yesterday.
Members of the family aver that ho
was the victim of a burglar. The po
lice investigators take the other view,
declaring that thtve wa no evidence
of the presence of intruders in the
palatial home.
A trail of blood stains on the snow
white stairway leading from the re
ception hall on the fir. ft lloor indicate
that Mr. Hirschberg was shot at the
foot of these stairs and then turned
and walked back to his bedroom on
the second floor. From there he
crossed a hallway and passed through
his wife’s room to the bedroom. As
lie returned, staggering into his wife's
room, Mrs. Hirschberg awoke ju t in
time to see him sink to the floor un
conscious', according to statements
made to the police.
Mrs. Hirschberg had her husband
carried to his bedroom where he died.
He made no statement as to how he
was shot. So far as the police could
learn no member of the household,
was' on the lower floor. It was ex
plained that deafness of long standing
prevented Mrs 1 . Hirschberg from hear
ing the report of the revolver.
.Mr. Hirschberg was a prominent
Komaji Catholic layman, and it was
largely through his instrumentality
that the site for the archiepiscopal
residence adpoining the Hirschberg
home on the west was purcha ed. He
was Archbishop Glen non \s closest per
sonal friend among the laity.

KIERAN’S ARREST
IS LOOKER FOR
LIST OF PECULATIONS GROWS
AND MANY SUFFER FROM
HIS DISHONESTY.
AUTHORITIES HAVE WARRANT
AND EXPECT TO LAND
HIM SOON.
Pitistmrg f Dec. 9. —Pittsburg police
have had a warrant for the arre.-t of
P. J. Kieran of the Fidelity Funding
company of New York for the past
three weeks. The affidavit charges
him with larceny and false pretense.
A local charitable institution of the
Roman Catholic church, the name of
which attorneys in the case decline
to make public, is an alleged sufferer
through the peculations' charged, and
it is probable the loss is between
SS.OuO and SIO,OOO, According to the
attorney representing the institution.
Kieran placed a loan upon liberal
terms several years ago. When this
loan became due a partial payment
was accepted and the balance re
newed upon eqully liberal terms.
Those managing the institution, how
ever, failed to take up the first note
when the second was given, it is
claimed, and since both have been
presented for payment.
Another local firm of attorneys, it
is reported to the authorities, now
hold claims for collection amounting
to over SIOO,OOO against Catholic
churches and auxiliary -ocieiies in
this diocese, growing out of loans
placed through Kieran. Whether
these are duplicated and fraudulent,
as charged in the case of the organ
nation which caused the issuance of
the warrant, hati not been fully es
tablished, as all the notes and securi
ties have passed into the hands of
third parties, who have sent them
I.' re for collection.
hocal police ye ‘terday heard that
Kieran was in Washington and asked
for his arrest there, but. it is said, he
left, the capitol before the message
was received. The authorities last
night said they had information which
leads them to expect Kieran’s ar
rest in Xew York before morning.

LARGEST FEDERAL
TASK Of loony
IS DEVELOPMENT OF WATER
WAYS AND FOREST
PRESERVATION.
WORK MUST BE DONE CONCUR
RENTLY, DECLARES THE
' PRESIDENT.
Washington. Dec. 9. In his addro -s
opening the national conservation
congress, President P.m> evelt de
clared "it is the largest national task
of today." No right-minded citizen
would stop the proper use of mi" re
sources. he added, "but every good
American must realize that national
improvidence follows the same course
and leads to the same end as personal
improvidence. and that needless
waste must stop. The time to deride
or neglect the statements of experts
and the teaching of the facts has gone
by. The time to act on what we
know has now arrived Common
prudence, common sense, and com
inon business principles are applicable
to national affairs just as they are to
private affairs, and the time has come
to use them in dealing with the foun
dations of our prosperity.
“Our natural resources are . re
lated that the use of one affects the
I use of a i the others. This is espec
ially true of our waterways. 1C very
man, woman and child within our hol
ders Inis an interest in them, through
all four. We have neglecte’d our wa
terways more than any other natural
resource and we must put an end to
that neg.ect.
“First. Let us prepare a compre
hensive plan for inland waterway de
velopment. Such a plan must con
sider every use of (In* waters, it must
put the interests of all the p* ople in
advance of any private interests what
soever. The preparation of this com
prehensive plan should begin at once
“Second. L* t ns proceed immedia
ately with Ihe con -traction of the
waterways for which plans have been
approved, and which we are now cer
tain will lit into tin* outlines of
the general plan. Our previous policy
of procrastination, delay, and fitful
and partial action hs borne its per
feet fruit. Our waterways are de
sorted, and in return for our vast ex
penditures we have little or no actual
navigation to show. The people are
ready for a change. Let iC have it,
and at once. If we can pay the cost
from current revenues let ns do so
If not let ns issue •ends. By eitln r
method, let us have the waterways
and that quickly. The plan and tin*
work can and should proet ed together
While the work we are sure of i he
ing begun, the plan for the rest can he
prepared.
“The work therefore should begin at
once. But there must not he the
slightest recklessness or waste of
money. No work whatever should he
undertaken that has not been borough
ly examined and fully approved hy
competent experts. Above all not one
cent should he expended to satisfy
special interests, whether of a busi
ness or a locality, or promote any
man's political fortunes. Thi-s is too
large a matter to he handled in
such a way. We must approach it
from the point of view of the utional
interest under the guidance of tin*
wisest experts in engineering, in
transportation, and in all the uses of
our stream Forests and water
ways cannot he separated in any
successful treatment of either. Forest
protection and river development
must go hand in hand. The three*
things' which should he done without
any further d* lay are:
First, To provide for a compre
hensive plan of waterway develop
ment,
Second, To begin at once on work
already planned that will surely 111 in
to the larger plan.
Third, To provide amply for for* st
protection against fire, against reck
less cutting, against wanton or rock
less destruction of all kinds, and to
secure the Appalachian and White
mountain national forests without de
lay.”
SHORT COT Kin
PANAMA CANAL
Washington. Dec. 9.—Secretary
Wright of the war department, be
fore the southern commercial con
gress declared that it was impossi
ble to fully predict the effect of the
Isthmian waterway upon commerce.
Speaking of the trade of western
South America he said: “In the past
Great Britain and Germany have al
most wholly supplied this need. The
I United states supplies less than 10
per cent of the Imports to the west
coast of South America. The com
pletion of the canal should in the
future give to the United States the
same dominance in this region that it
exercised in countries similarly situ
ated. Canada draws nearly 60 per
cent of her imports from us; and
notwithstanding the greater difficul
ties of transportation we still furnish
49 per cent of her imports to Mexico;
and 30 per cent of theirs to Vene
zuela and Colombia.
‘fjy the Panama canal. New York
will be brought nearly 4.000 miles
