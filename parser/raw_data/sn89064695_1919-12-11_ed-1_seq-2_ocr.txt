On Radical and Mounting
Costs Are Asked.
Following is the full text of Presi
dent Wilson's message to the Sixty
sixth congress:
I sincerely regret that I cannot be
present at the opening of this session
of the Congress. I am thus prevented
from presenting in as direct a way as
could wish the many Questions that
are pressing for solution at this time.
Happily, i h*.ve had the advantage of
the advice o* the heads of the several
executive departments who have kept
In close touch with affairs in their
detail and whose thoughtful recom
mendations 1 earnestly second.
In the matter of the railroads and
the readjustment of their aftairs grow
ing out ol ieueral control, I shall take
the liberty at a later day of addressing
you.
Budget System Urged.
I hope that Congress will bring to
a conclusion at this session legislation
looking to. the establishment of a
budget system. That there should be
one single authority responsible for
the making of all appropriations and
that appropriations should be made
not independently of each other, but
with reference to one single compre
hensive plan of expenditure properly
related to the nation's income, there
can be no doubt. I believe the bur
den of preparing the budget must, in
nature oi the case, if the work is
to be properly done and responsibility
ooncentrated instead of dividend, rest
upon the executive. The budget so
prepared should be submitted to and
approved or amended by a single com
mittee of each House of Congress and
no single appropriation should be
made by the Congress, except such as
may have been included in the budget
prepared by the executive or added by
the particular committee of Congress
charged with the budget legislation.
Another and not less important as
pect of the problem is the ascertain
ment of the economy and efficiency
with which the moneys appropriated
are expended. Under existing law the
only audit is for the purpose of as
certaining whether expenditures have
been lawfully made within the ap
propriations. No one is authorized
or equipped to ascertain whether the
money has been spent wisely, econo
mically and effectively. The auditors
should be highly trained officials with
permanent tenure in the Treasury de
partment, free of obligations to, or mo
tives of consideration for thiB or any
subsequent, administration and au
thorized and empowered to examine
Into and make report upon the meth
ods employed and the results obtained
by the executive departments of the
government. Their reports should be
made to the Congress and to the Sec
retary of the Treasury.
I trust that the Congress will give
immediate consideration to the prob
lem of future taxation. Simplifica
tion of the income and profit taxes
has become an immediate necessity.
These taxes performed indispensable
service during the war. They must,
however, be simplified, not only to
save the tax payer inconvenience and
expense, but in order* that his lia
bility may be made certain and defi
nite.
Income Tax Revision Sought.
With reference to the details of the
revenue law, the Secretary of the
Treasury and the Commissioner of In
ternal Revenue will lay before you
for your consideration certain amend
ments necessary or desirable in con
nection with the administration of the
lawrecommendaMons which have my
approval and support. It is of the ut
most importance that in dealing with
this matter the present law should not
be disturbed so far as regards taxes
for the calendar year 1920, payable
in the calendar year 1921. The Con
gress might well consider whether the
higher rates of income and profit taxes
can in peace times be effectively pro
ductive of revenue and whether they
may not, on the contrary, be destruc
tive of business activity and produc
tive of waste and inefficiency.
There is a point at which in peace
times high rates of income and profit
taxes discourage energy, remove the
incentive to new enterprise, encourage
extravagant expenditures and pro
,duce industrial stagnation with con
sequent unemployment and other at
tendant evils.
America Creditor Now.
Before the war America was heavily
the debtor of the rest of the world and
the interest payments she had to make
to foreign countries on American se
curities held abroad, the expenditures
of American travelers abroad and the
ocean freight charges she had to pay
others, about balanced the valus of
nsr pre-war favorable balance of
trade- During the war America's ports
have been greatly stimulated, and in
creased prices have increased their
ralue. On the other hand, she has
purchased a large proportion of the
American securities previously held
broad, has loaned some $9,000,000,-
000 to foreign governments, and has
built her own ships. Our favorable
balance of trade has thus been great
ly increased and Europe has been de
prived of the means of meeting it here
tofore existing. Europe can have only
three ways of meeting the favor
able balance of trade in peace times
by imports into this country of gold
or of goods, or by establishing new
credits. Europe is in no position at
the present time to ship gold to us nor
could we contemplate large further
imports of gold into this country with
out concern.
America "Greatest Capitalist."
The time has nearly passed for in
ternational governmental loans and it
will take time to develop in this coun
try a market for foreign securities.
Anything therefore which would tend
to prevent foreign countries from set
tling for our exports by shipments of
goods into this country could only
have the effect of preventing them
from paying for our exports and there
fore of preventing the exports from
being made. The productivity of the
country greatly stimulated by the war
must find an outlet by exports to
foreign countries and any measures
taken to prevent imports will inevit
ably curtail exports, force curtailment
of production, load the banking ma
chinery of the country with credits
to carry unsold products and produce
industrial stagnation and unemploy
ment. If we want to sell, we must be
prepared to buy. Whatever therefore,
may have been our views during the
period of growth of American busi
ness concerning tariff legislation we
must now adjust our own economic
life to a changed condition growing
out of the fact that American business
is full grown and that America is the
greatest capitalist in the world.
No policy of isolation will satisfy the
growing needs and opportunities of
America. The provincial standards
and policies of the past, which have
held American business as if in a
straight-jacket, must yield and give
way to the needs and exigencies of the
new day in which we live, a day full
of hope and promise for American
business if we will but take advantage
of the opportunities that are ours for
the asking. The recent war has ended
our isolation and throws upon us a
great duty and responsibility. The
United States must share the ex
panding world market. The United
States desires for itself only
equal opportunity with the othe"r na
tions of the world and that through
the process of friendly co-operation
and fair competition the legitimate in
terests of the nations concerned may
be successfully and equitably adjusted.
Soldier Relief Advocated.
"We must see to it that our return
ing soldiers are assisted in every prac
ticable way to find the places for
which they are fitted in the daily work
of the country. This can be done by
developing and maintaining upon an
adequate scale the admirable organiza
tion created by the Department of
Labor and placing men seeking work
and it can also be done, in at least
one very great field, by creating new
opportunities for individual enterprise.
Tho Secretary of the Interior has
pointed out the way by which return
ing soldiers may be helped to find and
take up the land in the hitherto un
developed regions of the country which
the federal government has already
prepared or can readily prepare for
cultivation and also on many of the
cut over and neglected areas which lie
within the limits of the older states
and I once more take the liberty of
recommending very urgently "that his
plans shall receive the Immediate and
substantial support, of the Congress."
Dyestuff Protection Urged.
In the matter of tariff legislation, I
beg to call your attention to the state
ments contained in my last message
urging legislation with reference to
the establishment of the chemical and
dyestuffs industry in America.
Among the industries to which spe
cial consideration should be given is
that of the manufacture of dyestuffs
and related chemicals. Our complete
dependence upon German supplies be
fore the war made the interruption of
trade a cause of exceptional economic
disturbance. The close relation be
tween the manufacture of dyestuffs, on
the one hand, and of explosives and
poisonous gasses, on the other, more
over, has given the industry an excep
tional significance and value. Al
though the United States will gladly
and unhesitatingly join in the pro
gram of international disarmament, it
will .nevertheless be a policy of obvious
prudence to make certain of the suc
cessful maintenance of many strong
and well-equipped chemical plants.
The German chemical industry, with
which we will be brought into compe
tition, was and may well be again, a
thoroughly knit monopoly capable of
exercising a competition of a peculiar
ly insidious and dangerous kind.
Farmers' War Work Praised.
"During the war the farmer per
formed a vital and willing service to
the nation. By materially increasing
the production of his land he supplied
America and the Allies with the in
creased amounts of food necessary to
keep their immense armies in the
field. He indispensably helped to win
the war. But there i3 now scarcely
less need of increasing the produc
tion in food and the necessaries of
life. I ask the Congress to consider
means of encouraging effort along
these lines. The importance of doing
everything possible to promote pro
duction along economical lines, to im
prove marketing, and to make rural
life more'attractive and healthier, is
obvious. I would urge approval of the?
plans already proposed to the Congress
by the Secretary of Agriculture, to se
cure the essential facts required for
the proper study of this question,
through the pronosed enlarsomont
programs for farm management stu
dies and crop estimates.
'Attention Called To Unrest..
I would call your attention to the
widespread condition of political rest
lessness in our body politic. The
causes of this unrest while various
and complicated, are superficial rather
than deep seated. Broadly, they arise
from or are connected with the failure
on the part of our government to ar
rive speedily at a just and permanent
peace permitting return to normal
conditions, from the transfusion of
radical theories from seething Euro
pean centers pending such delay, from
heartless profiteering resulting in the
increase of the cost of living, and last
ly from the machinations of passionate
and malevolent agitators. With the
return to normal conditions this un
rest will rapidly disappear. In the
meantime it does much evil. It seems
to me that in dealing with this situa
tion Congress should not be impatient
or drastic but should seek rather to
remove the causes. It should endeavor
to bring our country back speedily to
a peace basis with ameliorated living
conditions under the minimum of
strictions upon personal liberty fiat
is consistent with our reconstruction
problems. And it should arm the fed
eral government with power to deal in
its criminal courts with those persons
who by violent methods would abro
gate our time-tested institutions.
With the free expression of opinion
and with the advocacy of orderly po
litical charge, however fundamental,
there must be no interference, but to
wards passion and malevolence tend
ing to incite crime and insurrection
under guise of political evolution there
should be no leniency. Legislation to
this end has been recommended by the
attorney general and has been enacted.
In this direct connection I would call
your attention to my recommendations
on August 8th, pointing out legislative
measures which would be effective in
controlling and bringing down the
present cost of living which contrib
utes so largely to this unrest. Only
one of these recommendations has the
Congress acted. If the government's
campaign is to be effective.it is neces
sary that the other steps suggested
should be acted on at once.
Continued Food Control Asked.
I renew and strongly urge the neces
sity of the extension of the present
food control act as to the period of
time in which it shall remain in opera
tion. The Attorney General has sub
mitted a bill providing for an exten
sion of this act for a period of six
months. As it now stands it is limited
in operation to the period of the war
and becomes inoperative upon the
formal proclamation of peace. It is
imperative that it should be extended
at once. The Department of Justice
has built up extensive machinery for
the purpose of enforcing its poVi
sions all of which must be abandoned
upon the conclusion of peace unless
the provisions of this act are extended.
During this period the Congress
will have an opportunity to make
similar, permanent. provisions and
regulations with regard to all goods
destined for interstate commerce and
to exclude them from interstate^Ship
ment, if the requirements of the law
are not complied with. Some such
regulation is imperatively necessary.
The abuses that have grown up in the
manipulation of prices by withholding
of foodstuffs and other necessaries of
life cannot otherwise be effectively
prevented. There can be no doubt of
either the necessity or the ligitlmacy
of such measures.
As I pointed out in my last message,
publicity can accomplish a great deal
in this campaign. The aiw of the
government must be clearly brought
to the attention of the consuming pub
lic, civic organizations and state of
ficials, who are in a position to lend
their assistance to our efforts.
You have made available funds with
which to carry on this campaign, but
there is no provision in the law author
izing their expenditure for Ihe pur
pose of making the public fully in
formed about the efforts of the gov
ernment. Specific recommendation
has been made by the Attorney Gen
eral in this regard. I would strongly
urgeSipon you its immediate adoption,
as it constitutes one of the preliminary
steps to this campaign.
Cold Storage Curbs Requested.
I also renew my recommendation
that the Congress pass a law regulat
ing cold storage as it is regulated, for
example, by the laws of the state of
New Jersey, which limits the time dur
ing which goods may be kept in stor
age, prescribe the method of disposing
of them if kept beyond the permitted
period and require that goods re
leased from storage shall in ail cases
bear the date of their receipt, It
would materially add to the service
ability of the law, for the purpose we
now have In view, if it were also pre
scribed that all goods released from,
storage for interstate shipment should
have plainly marked upon each pack
age the selling or market price at
which they went into storage. By this
means the purchaser would always be
able to learn what profits stood be
tween him and the producer or the
wholesale dealer.
We should formulate a law requir
ing a federal license of all corpora
tions engaged in interstate commerce
and embodying in the license, or in
the conditions under which it is to be
issued, specific regulations designed to
secure competitive sailing and prevent
unconscionable profits in the method
of marketing. Such a law would af
ford a welcome to effect other much
needed reforms in the business of in
terstate shipment and* in the methods
of corrcrat:or..3 which are engaged in
it, but ior the raomont I coadne my

cost of living.
No one who has observed the march
of events in the last year can fail to
note the absolute need of a definite
program to bring about an improve
ment in the conditions of labor. There
can be no settled conditions leading
to increased production and a reduc
tion in the cost of living if labor and
capital are to be antagonists instead
of partners. Sound thinking and an
honest desire to serve the interests of
the whole nation, as distinguished
from the interests ef a class, must be
applied to the solution of this great
and pressing problem.
The failure of other nations to con
sider this matter in a vigorous way
has produced bitterness and Jealousies,
antagonism, the food of radicalism.
The only way to keep men from agi
tating against grievances is to remove
the grievances. An unwillingness
even to discuss these matters pro
duces only dissatisfaction and gives
comfort to the extreme elements in our
country which endeavor to stir up dis
turbances in order to provoke govern
ments to embark upon a course of re
taliation and repression. The seed of
revolution is repression. The remedy
for these things must not be negative
in character, it must be constructive.
It must comprehend the general inter
est. The real antidote for the unrest
which manifests itself is not suppres
sion but a deep consideration of the
wrongs that beset our national life
and the application of a remedy.
Congress had already shown Its wi
lingness tb deal with these industrial
wrongs by establishing the eight-hour
day as the standard in every field of
labor. It has sought to find a vray to
prevent child labor. It has served the
whole country by leading the way in
developing the means of preserving
and safeguarding iives and health in
dangerous industries.. It must now
help in the difficult task of finding a
method that will bring about a genuine
democratization of industry, based
upon the full recognition of the right
of those who work, in whatever rank,
to participate in some organic way
in every decision which directly af
fects their welfare. It is with this
purpose in mind that I called a con
ference to meet in Washington on
December 1 to consider these problems
in all their broad aspects with the
idea of bringing about a better under
standing between the two interests.
Unrest Shows Need of Action.
The great unrest throughout the
world, out of which has emerged a
demand for an immediate considera
tion of the difficulties between capital
and labor, bids us put our own house
in order. Frankly, there can be no
permanent and lasting settlements be
tween capital and labor which do not
recognize the fundamental concepts
for which labor has been struggling
through the years. The whole world
gave its recognition and endorsement
to these fundamental purposes in the
league of nations. The statesmen
gathered at Versailles recognized the
fact that world stability could not be
had by returning to industrial stand
ards and conditions against which the
average workman of the world had re
volted.
It is, therefore, the task of the
statesmen of this new day of change
and readjustment to recognize world
conditions and to seek to bring about,
through legislation conditions that
will mean the ending of age long an
tagonisms between capital and labor
and that will hopefully lead to the
building up of a comradeship which
will result not only in greater con
tentment among the mass of workmen
but also bring about a greater produc
tion and a greater prosperity to busi
ness itself*
To analyze the particulars in the
demands of labor is to admit the jus
tice of their complaint in many mat
ters that lie at their basis. The work
man demands an adequate wage, suf
ficient to permit him to live *in com
fort, unhampered by the fear or pov
erty and want in his old age. He de
mands the right to live and the right
to work amidst sanitary surroundings
both in home and in workshop, sur
rounding that develop and do not re
tard his* own health and well-being
and the right to provide for his chil
dren's wants in the matter of health
and education. In other words, it is
his desire to make the conditions of
his life and the lives of those dear to
him tolerable and easy to bear.
League Shows Way, He Says.
The establishment of the principles
regarding labor laid down in the cove
nant of the league f nations offers
us the way to industrial peace and
conciliation. No otter road lies open
to us. Not to pursue this one is long
er to invite enmities, bitterness and
antagonisms which in the end only
lead to Industrial and social disaster.
The unwilling workman is not a profit
able servant. An employe whose in
dustrial life is hedge about by hard
and unjust conditions, which he did
not create and over which he has no
control, lacks that fine spirit of en
thusiasm and volunteer effort which
are the necessary ingredients of a
great producing entity. Let us be
frank about this solemn matter. The
evidences of world wide unrest which
manifest themselves in violence
throughout the world bid us pause and
consider the means to be found to stop
the spread of this contagious thing
before it saps the very vitality of the
nation itself.
Do we gam strength "by withholding
the remedy? Is it not the business of
statesmen to treat these manifesta
tions of unrest which meet us on every
hand a3 evidences of an economic dis
order and to apply constructive reme
cies wherever necessary, being sure
that in the application of the remedy
we touch not the vital tissues of our
industrial and economic Hfe? There
can be no recession of the tide of un-
rest until constructive instrumentali
ties are set up to stem that tide.
"Labor Not Commodity."
Governments must recognize the
right of men collectively to bargain
for humans objects that have at their
base the mutual protection and wel
fare of those engaged in all industries.
Labor must not be longer treated as a
commodity. It must be regarded as
the activity of human beings, pos
sessed of deep yearnings and desires.
The business man gives the best
thought to the repair and replenish
ment of his machinery^ so that its use
fulness will not be impaired and its
power to produce may always he at its
height and kept in full vigor and mo
tion.
No less regard ought to be paid to
the human machine, which, after ail,
propels the machinery of the world
and is the great dynamic force that
lies back of all industry and progress.
Return to the old standard of wage
and industry in employment are un
thinkable. The terrible tragedy of
war which has just ended and which
has brought the world to the verge
of chaos and disaster would be in vain
if there should ensue a return to the
conditions of the past. Europe itself,
whence has come the unrest which
now holds the world at bay is an ex
ample of stand-pat-ism in these vital
human matters which America might
well accept as an example, not to be
followed but studiously to be avoided.
Europe made labor the differential,
and the price of it all is enmity and/
antagonism and prostrated industry.
Tie right of labor to live in peace and
comfort must be recognized by govern
ments and America should be the first
to lay the foundation tones upon which
industrial peace shall be built.
Entitled to Reasonable Return.
Labor not only is entitled to an ade
quate wage but capital should receive
a reasonable return upon its invest
ment and is entitled to protection at
the hands of the government in every
emergency. No government worthy of
the name can "play" these elements
against each other for there is a mu
tuality of interest between which the
government must seek to expand to
safe-guard at all cost.
Right To Strike Inviolate.
The right of individuals to strike is
inviolate and ought not to be. inter
fered with by any process of govern
ment, but there is a predominant
right, and that is the right of the gov
ernment to protect all of its people
and to assert its power, and majesty
against the challenge of any class.
The government, when it asserts that
right, seeks not to antagonize a class,
but simply to defend the right of the
whole people as against the irrepar
able harm and injury that might he
done by the attempt by a olass to
usurp a power that only government
itself has a right to exercise as a pro
tection to all. I
In the matter of International dis
putes which have led to war, states
men have sought to set up a remedy
arbitration for war. Does this not
point the way for the setlement of in
dustrial disputes, by the establishment
of tribunal, fair and just alike to all.
Which will settle industrial disputes
which in the past have led to war and
disaster? America, witnessing the
evil consequences which have fol
lowed out of such disputes between
the contending forces, must not admit
itself impotent to deal with these mat
ters by means of peaceful processes.
Surely, there must be some method
of bringing together in a council of
peace and amity these two great in
terests, out of which will come a hap
pier day of peace and co-operation, a
day that will make for more comfort
and happiness in living and a more
tolerable condition among all classes
of men. Certainly human intelligence
can devise some acceptable tribunal
for adjusting the differences between
capital and labor.
Hour of Test and Trial.
This is the hour of test and trial for
America. By her prowess and
strength, and the indomitable courage
of her soldiers, she demonstrated her
power to vindicate on foreign battle
fields her conception of liberty and
justice. Let not her influence as a
mediator between capital and labor be
weakened and her own failure to set
tle matters of purely domestic con
cern be proclaimed to the world.
There are those in this country who
threaten direct action to force their
will upon a majority. Russia, today,
with its blood and terror, is a painful
object lesson of the power of minori
ties.
It makes little difference what mi
nority it is, Whether capital or labor,
or any other class, no sort of privilege
will ever be permitted to dominate
this country. We arc a partnership
or nothing that is worth while. We
are a democracy, where the majority
are the masters, or all the hopes and
purposes of the men who founded this
government have been defeated and
forgotten. In America there is but
one way by which great reforms can
be accomplished and the relief sought
by classes obtained, and that is
through the orderly processes of rep
resentative government Those who
would propose any other method of
reform are enemies of this country.
America .will not be daunted by
threats nor lose her composure or
calmness in these distressing times.
We can afford, in the midst of this day
of passion and unrest, to be self con
tained and sure. The instrument of
all reform in America is the straight
road of justice to all classes and con
ditions of men. Men have but to fol
low this road to realize the full
fruition of their objects and purposes.
Let those beware who would take the
shorter road of disorder and revolu
tion. .The right road is the road of
justice and orderly process.
