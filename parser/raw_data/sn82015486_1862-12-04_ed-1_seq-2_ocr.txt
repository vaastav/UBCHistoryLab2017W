It is again asserted, upon what is said
to be good anthority, that France has do-.
termined to recognize the Southern Con
federacy, and to break the blockade ; in
retnrn for which, the South is to favor
French designs npon- Mexico.
It continues to be reported that the

Tho army before Fredericksburg is still
quiet. Damside is said to have told some
officer that he expected to fight next week.
The long delay was caused by neglect of
tho proper officer to furnish pontoon
bridges, nntil abont a week after ho re
ceived orders. He has been arrested.
The rumors ofthe removal of Burn
side are,, unfounded, lie has been given
fuller powers than ever.
A large expedition, consisting of gun
boats, transports and iron-clads, has sail
ed from Fortress Monroe, with scaled or
ders. Destination unknown. Look out
for something stirring.
Col. Lee and the Kansas 7th are gain
ing an enviable fame by their exploits in
Mississippi. If the Colonel keeps on as
he has begun, and is prudent, and don't
get "picked off," he is bound to distin
guish "himself. Doniphan County may
'well be proud of him. By the way,
Doniphan has furnished both the Colonel
and Lieutenant Colonel of that Regiment.
Col. Hovey, with 20,000 men, has, by
a rapid march, taken Grand Junction,
Mississippi, butned bridges, locomotives
and cars, and thus cut off the retreat of
the rebel army. If Grant and Hovey,
between them, don't succeed in bagging
the whole ''kit" of them, it will be their
own fault.
The liieMlcsni'cuMir aSlAroWlHgEYllu aai a Bad State
ventien.
By the agreement entered into by the
present Republican County Central Com
mittee, which we published some few
weeks since, the party vote for State offi
cers is the guide in apportioning the del
egates for the next County Convention.
According to that vote, we have compiled
the Tallowing tables. The average ..vot0
for State officers, including member of
Congress; in the various Townships; ae-
cording to tne othciat returns, is as fol
lows: SA v "

TakiDg.the abovo averages, the Con

out the vote for member of Congress,
does not change the number of delegates
from .any Township. In making the
tables, we have given delegates for fnll
numbers and thergeat fractions. In "a
Convention of "4T delegates, the largest
fraction is that of Centre, the next Wolf
River, 'and Wayno third each giving
one of the odd delegates. In a Conven
tion of 31 delegates, they are Bnrr Oak,
Washington, and Wayne. In a Conven
tion of 21 delegates, they are Iowa,

. Tne.SouTHERN Confederacy, and the
-Wbst. Beyond a question, a lasting
"peace can never co'me'to this nation, with
'one foot of foreign soil west of tho Mis
sissippi, or in the valley of the Ohio. It
Ms then of vital importance, that some
"General of abilty and energy should com
mand the Western Department. Snch a
General is not Gen. Curtis. A fair sec
ond iij command, he is timid as .chief,
and lacks the essentials of success as see
his failure in Arkansas. An able officer
ought to overcome and subdue Arkansas
with an army of 40,000 men.
If the C. S. A. must bo acknowledged,
(a consummation which we cannot think
'possible,) wo would lend every energy to
make their boundary line include only
such' States as lie east of the Mississippi,
and out. of the Ohio Valley. We now
hold the latter; and with Banks in Texas,
and a good commander (6uch as Sigel)
in Missouri, the former would soon he
ours. As for Virginia, the State of Ka
nawha is about all we hold, save the vi
einlty of Washington, and we fear all we
are likely to win, nnder existing manage
ment: though we must admit that the re
moval of McCIellan gives U3 new hope
and encouragement.
William H. Seward. There was a
. time when the name of William H. Sew
ard awakened in the heart of radical
Young America a sympathetic throb, and
at that name the pulse beat higher. Now,
alas1! how changed. Almost despised by
live -men, his smooth diplomacy abound
ing'in incessant promises of speedily re
stored peace, his Cabinet influence show
ing timidity, ho stands to-day the embod
iment, of pulseless, trembling Conserva
tism. -'Mr. Seward's timidity seems to
have pervaded all his fellows. Delay af
ter delay ha marked the inception of the
.war, and. hampered its progress to the
present hour.
As will be seen at a glance, the Conven
tion of 21 delegates is the fairest for the
small Townships, as it places the two
larger Townships on an equality, cutting
Washington Township down to tho same
number of delegates as Iowa. We think
a Convention of 21 delegates is largo
enough, and we are suro the large Town
ships will not object, though their strength
may by proportionately decreased. With
a Convention of 21 members, we are like
ly to have greater average ability. Every
one must have noticed bow many proxies
always come up from Washington Town
ship; and to that, perhaps more than to
anything else, Washington owes its suc
cess in always getting so large a propor
tion of the officers.
We throw out theso hints as sugges
tions to the Central Committee, and for
the consideration of all Republicans.
ofAflklrm.
This country is full of soldiers, who
have returned homo without leave in
plain language, deserters. They can be
found everywhere. Go where yon may,
in any nook or corner, you will find men
in military clothes, nine-tenths. of twhom
have deserted the flag of their, country.
The remaining tenth have been discharge
Led from the service, bnt a majority of
. .- i- ' . - 7
these have got out npon Might or preten
ded complaints. It is no hard job to ob
tain the. requisite certificate from the ar
my surgeons. Very many of these will
grant certificates for a small considera
tion. wo woniier tnat our armv is ac
complishing nothing, and that calllafter
call and draft upon. draft is, made for new
troops. Discipline. is too lax, and pun
ishm'eht' too tardv and-slicht. Some ef-
fsctualmeans, should ,bex adopted Jo stop
this wholesale desertion, nnder the mil
der name of absence without leave. If
a few of the'fcllows were "shot for deser-
tion, and tbns made an example of, it
might have a wholesome influence npon
the others. If not, they all ought to he
shot.
But the above is not the worst feature
of the bnriness. Horse-thieving is car
ried on to an alarming extent. No
man's property, loyal or disloyal, is safe.
And almost the whole of this thieving is
done by men ir. United States uniform
deserters irom tne army. In many ca
ses, they go to men having fine horses,
pretending to be United States officers,
and seise 'the horses as jayhnwked or
contraband properly, in tho name of the
Government. Once in their hands, the
horses are seldom seen again by their
owners. Within a week past, wo lmvo
heard of about a dozen horses being sto
len in this County,, mostly by deserters ;
and scarcely a day passes, but we see per'
sons from other Counties, who aro hun
ting for stolen horses.
What can be done to put an end to
this evil ? The military has been tried,
and has proven utterly inefficient; and
the civil authorities can do nothing. It
is time for tho people to take the mntter
into their own hands. Let them organ
ize, and have their agents and detectives
in every part of the connlry. And when
ever a horse-thief is caught, let him be
strung np on the spot.
1W The Wyandotte Gazette gives, as-
a reason, for supporting a portion of the
- mongrel State ticket, "just bec.nse it bad
"av'ind to." A good reason, truly, and
Iota of argument in it. Then, why Joes
it: grumble because a majority of the vole
in New York elected'' the Tory ticket ?
iney acted precisely npon the same prin
ciple, and voted that ticket "just because
.they had a mind to," It is coming to
pretty pass, when a public journalist
- hasoojight to take exceptions to any
inconsistent or mean act performed by a
newspaper or a politician, because they
. had a right to do so. and "had a mind to!'
Tinkemso the CONSTITUTION. There
will be, this Winter, the usual number of
amendments to the State Constitution of
fered. We hope all snch amendments
will be more fairly considered than they
were last Winter; and wheie worthy of
adoption, th.it they will pass. We do
not regard the Constitution as nearly per
fect; and we think it is far better, safer
and cheaper for a State to amend its Con
stitution, as experience dictates, than once
in ten or twenty years to have a Conven
tion to frame a new Constitntioit. In the
main they must be quite similar; and
when a body of men get together to frame
a new Constitution, they think their sole
business is to vary as far as possible from
the old one, and the voter is only left a
choice of evils. But when a Legislature,
after mature deliberation, submits an
amendment to the people, it is probable
that tho new and unlooked-for wants of
the State reqnire the change, and the voter
has the opportunity of voting upon a
single distinct proposition.
A Scaly Reminiscence. Whv don't
the State Central Committee place some
one on the Committee, in the place of the
late John James Ingalls, who can proper
ly represent the Second Judicial District?
The making np of that same Central
Committee was one of the mean, little,
dirty tricks of the majority of the late
State Convention, of which we should
think they must now, in their cooler mo
ments, feel a little ashamed. After send
ing ono of their leading men to the Wil
der men, to inquire whose names they
wished on the Committee, and the Wilder
men simply 'asking two to which their
numbers and ability fairly entitled them
the majority were shabby and greedy
enough to take advantage of their numbers
and break their agreement, and construct
the Committee entirely from their own
faction. There are some very small and
illiberal politicians in this State, who
call themselves Republicans, and fatten at
the public crib.
"Ylrinoiis (!) Indignation."
The "Colonel." (!) of the Topeka
Tribune, shows his ill natriro over tho te-
marks we havo seen proper to make re
specting the course which that papor pur
sued during tho late campaign. From his
flounderings, we are convinced that, in
giving expression to our suspicions, we
struck him on a sore spot: lie confines
his reply to slop-shop and slang phrases,
and throws ont insinuations abont virtue,
morality, honesty, and hope of gain. He
likewise violates editoni courtesy,
which, by persons pretending to respects
bility; is observed even when engage in
unpleasant controversies instead of re
ferring to ns in the namo of our paper,
he makes a practice of using our personal
name, in all his bandy-house effusions for
our benefit. Honesty, indeed ! Wo were
never convicted of complicity in a nice
arrangement to swindle the people of the
whole State ! Morality ! We occasion
ally draw a sober breath ! Hope of gain,
and proffered allurements ! We were nev
er charged with selling ourself, our prin
ciples, and our paper, for 150 dollars !
The Tribune, while pretending to be a
Republican organ, may have a right to
support mongrels and Democrats who are
intent upon breaking the party down; bnt
we have an equal right to express our
opinion of such a course. The military
gentleman who controls its editorial de
partment, may have a right to make
a pnblic nuisance of himself; bnt we
have a right to tell him what we think
of it. He may have a perfect right to
sell himself to the Democracy, at every
State election, and to be bought back, as
tne tool and mouth-peace of some one in
power, with tho name of some other indi
vidual aUthe editorial head of his paper,
in order to bring it back to respectability;
but we claim and shall exercise the right
to let the .Republican party know of the
imposition that is sought to be practiced
upon it, just as often and in as strong
language as we see fit. Now, if he has
any more slop to fling at us, let him
squirt away !

Just before -the etmnwaeement of the
pork-packing aeasoa, wsmsT all was; on
certainty as to the market,-sad packers
bad not yet set ; their flgares, sainy farmers
became scared, and iaiagiasJ:tbey would
get nothing for their perk. At taet junc
ture, speculators from abroad tent Jlheir
agents, throngs the eouBtry, to buy up, all
the hogs titey'seeld get; and ivery many
farmers (let their Kegs go attl.75 and

Now that, the packing business has fairly
commenced, and Dork is bringing 83 at
White CJqnd, these farmers are regretU'n,
that they did not keep, their, hog,, ,and
feed them a Mew weeks longer.ar they
would have had mora pounds to sell, at
'higher figures thaa they;rectived. Their
corn is.no object, "as there is no market
for it. Bat we do not pity them an-iota.
Mr. Bailey always pays the highest mar
ket price for hogs. He keeps' a constant
watch npon this market, and understands
it thoroughly; and when be raises or lowers
the price of hogs, it is sure evidence that
the head market is rising' or falling.
Farmers may sometimes think the prices
offered at other places are a little 'bet
ler; bnt after going to the expense of
driving or transportation, (to say nothing
of frequent delay, and probable backing
down of buyers,) they will find that they
wonld have made money by bringing them
to White Cloud. When pork is high,
hog raisers expect Mr. Bailey to pay them
the ruling figures. But if, when the price
is small, they permit themselves to be
duped by somo gonging speculator, rather
than givo their own homo doaler tho ad
vantage, of any probable rise, they deser vo
to'be "stuck," every lima.

A letter from Suffolk. Va.. dated 26th.

ment with the enemy at Znni on the
Blackwater.
Having no orders to cross, he could
not pursue his advantages, and after dri
ving the enemy back from the river, re
turned to his post. The only serious cas
ualty on our side was the severely wound
ing of private Jones, belonging to the
battery.
The enemy's fire was not heavy, and
their force in the opposite woods and be
hind their entrenchments was strong, bnt
they had no artillery at first, and onr
grape and canister troubled them.
They evidently lost several men. for
they fonght under cover and had a dense
forest in their rear. After we ,had left
