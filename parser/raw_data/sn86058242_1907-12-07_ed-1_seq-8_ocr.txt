Monogah, W. Va., Doc. C. Thr'e hun

behind tons of coal, rock and mlnu
debris in two successive mine explo
sions this morning in f-hafts Noa. 6 find
8 of the Consolidated Coal company on
opposite sides of the West Fork river
here.
Six bodies, horribly charred, have
been recovered, and tive men escaped,
more dead than alive, through air
shafts.' It Is feared every one of the
men in the mines U dead or will suc
cumb before rescuers rt aoh them.
Clarence W. Watson of llaltimore,
president of the mining company, was
At Parkersburg. W. Va., when the ex
plosion occurred and chartered a spe
cial train to bring him to the scene,
lie reached here late tonight.
AVornt Mine Itnter In America.
The disaster is the worst in the his
tory of coal mining in West Virginia,
and probably the worst which ever
occurred in America.
While no dellnlto statement can be
obtained it is believed the explosion
was caused by Are damp, as only last
week both mines were inspected and
found in good condition. The ventilat
ing apparatus was in perfect order and
expert miners say there could not have
been any dnst in the mine.
Rescue work was begun promptly.
Superintendents and officers of the mine
were on the ground within half an
hour after the explosion and hastened
the relief measures.
Plij-nlclanM Unshod to the Scene.
Every physician in Fairmount was
hurried here to help the local doctors.
A temporary hospital was established
near the mouth of one of the mined.
This was of great benefit to members of
the rescue gang, who were often over
come. The deadly fire damp made it im
possible to do much early in the day,
especially at mine No. 8, where the
ventilating system was completely
wreckpd. Until another fan could be
brought from Shinnston, twelve miles
away, and temporarily installed, the
rescuers practically faced death every
time they ventured into the gas filled
hole.
Tonight the fumes are so strong It
is almost impossible to proceed until
carpeftters replace the airholes in the
hillside and thus establish circulation
of air in the mines. Without these
the fan is of little avail.
Survivor Tell of Horror.
The explosion occurred shortly after
10 o'clock today after the full day force
had gone to work in the two mines
affected. These mines are located on
opposite sides of the West Fork river,
at this place, but merged in their un
derground workings by a heading and
or. the surface by a great steel tipple
and bridge.
The living men are unable to give
any detailed report of the disaster or
even explain how they reached the
surface.
They say that immediately back of
them when they began their frantic
struggle for liberty there was a large
number of men engaged in a similar
struggle, while still farther back in the
workings there was a larger number,
of whom they know nothing.
May Oct Air, but Perish.
There is more hope for those in more
remote sections of the mine, as they
may have reached workings where
fresh air is supplied by other openings.
Tut at best only the most slender hope
is entertained for the survival of any
one of the men in the mine until the
debris can be cleared away and com
munication with the outside reestab
lished. The two mines regularly employed
1,000 men, working in two shifts, 500
during the day and COO during the
night.
The best information obtainable at
this time is that the entire day force
had gone to work this morning and
that all were caught.
The explosion occurred at an hour
when even the latest of the straggling
force is customarily at work, according
to mine officials.
P.eyond these figures the company
otHoials do not attempt to give estimates.

Subsequently the Japanese notified

prohibiting immigration. Thus the
president was placed is an embarrassing

Kaneko said:
"President Roosevelt always is the

he has clearly stated the position of

Alligators in Ecuador.
A new minor industry that Is devel
oping in Ecuidor is the killing and
skinning of alligators. This industry
was launched in 1903 by an American,
who went to Guayaquil for the pur
pose of huntin; down the myriads of
alligators which abound in the River
Guayas and its tributaries. He was
markedly successful. The business
was temporarily interrupted in the
early part of 1905 by the untimely
death of the American, who had start
ed the fun, but it has recently been
resumed. The total value of the ani
mator skins exported during the years
1003, 1904, 1S05 and 1305 was $33.000.
The skins shipped from Ecuador to
this country last year weighed 57,000
pounds, and were valued at $4,573.

Mr. Bryan's reception was certainly

Stephenson and the surrounding coun
ties are republican territory, but it
seemed as if the entire 13,500 popula
tion with which Freeport is credited
was in evidence last night. Two brass
bands and a torchlight procession met
the candidate at the depot, and the
triumphal procession was escorted to
the hotel, another to the meeting places,
and the halls were crowded long before
he got there.
In his talk Mr. Bryan followed close
ly his recent Washington speech. He
upheld the Chicago platform of 1S9G
by claiming that the eleven years of
substantial history had proved the
justice and wisdom of every important
plank in that document, although with
no specific reference to the 16 to 1, and
asserted that the only thing which
made President Roosevelt popular were
the things he had done in the line of
that platform. In fact, Mr. Bryan put
himself ithenaer ct oaintaointntnant
himself in the reactionary class. He
practically said the platform of 1S96
was good enough for him, that it had
been vindicated, and that he proposed
to "stand pat" on it.
From the Chicago viewpoint a large
part of the Interest In the demonstra
tion was the happening on the train
carrying Mr. Bryan here. Roger Sulli
van was not aboard, but nobody ex
pected him. Carter Harrison also
staid behind, and none of his friends
were aboard. This was a surprise. The
Bryan league surely was expected to
be represented. Ex-Mayor Dunne and
the Jefferson club was in force, and.
while Sullivan was absent, his friends
were along.

that the Mutual Benefit will withdraw
from business in that state at the end

It was also announced that the di
rectors of the Connecticut Mutual Life

Cleveland Pleads for Honest'.
Fx-President Cleveland opened his
speech with a strong plea for honesty
and integrity in the Insurance busi
ness, telling the presidents they could
not afford at any time, particularly
during the present searching investi
gations by legislatures, to lose caste
before the people through broken prom
Ises or delusive misrepresentation.
"Those that control life insurance
companies should be absolutely and
disinterestedly devoted to the interests
of the assured," he said. "And the re
lation between the policy holders and
their companies should be friendly,
trustful, and co-operative. Laws pro
fessedly regulating life insurance
should We free from senseless resent
ment, predatory acquisitiveness, or
demagogic appeal."
Mr. Cleveland said it would be folly
to blink at or avoid the disgraceful
fact that the dislocation of these ideal
conditions began in the "faithlessness
of those occupying places of greatest
influence in life insurance circles who
invited discredit and humiliation to
some of the largest and strongest com
panics in life Insurance by their lead
ership."

Chicago, Dec. 7. Automobile racing.
which last year resulted in a large
number of fatalities and serious acci
dents to spectators and participants.
to be shorn of a great part of its
terrors. By the adoption of a rvu.i
et of rules the American Automobile
association believes that auto r;ii..s
will become as safe as any strenuous
contests may be.
It was at a meeting of the sanctions
committee, which later reported to the
xecutive committee of the national or
ganization at its meeting at the Col-
seum auto show in the afternoon, that
the new rules were drawn up. If the
new rules are observed and there are
serious penalties provided for their vio
lation accidents, it is predicted, will
be next to impossble.
All Tracks to He Inspected.
The new provisions- specify that the
organization will not sanction any race
that is not given in accordance with
all of these rules. Prior to the grant
ing of a sanction an investigation of
the tracks must be made by a compe
tent committee and photographs of all
turns and fences on it must be sub
mitted to the national body.
There also must be drawings of the
buildings and stands for spectators,
with their descriptions. It further is
provided that the racing board shall
decide in what places spectators shall
be permitted, and then only after they
have made a thorough study of the
peculiarities of the locality in which
the race is to be given.
There are many other stipulations
regarding the judges, guards, and other
details of the tracks, but the com
mittee gave most of its attention to
the study of safeguards against acci
dent. Officers of the organization de
clare it their belief that automobile
racing under these rules will be as
safe as horse racing.
IligKcst Day at the Show.
While this meeting was in progress
the Coliseum, the Annex, and the Ar
mory were humming with long de
layed auto business. Spectators who
have attended every day's show at
last decided that the time was ripe to
place orders. At many of the
booths those in charge were unable
to attend to the purchasers and vis
itors.
It may have been due to the weather
and it may have been due to the fact
that the show is so nearly over, but
the attendance of the day was greater
than at any preceding day of any of
the auto shows given in Chicago. The
ticket sellers announced in the even
ing that 50,000 persons had passed
through the doors in the afternoon and
evening.
Tn this final rush of business the
commercial car, which has been climb
lng steadily toward the top rung of
the ladder of supremacy, held its place,
There were more orders for commercial
cars than on all the other days of the
show combined.

HAMMOND, IND.
Pittsburg, Dec. 7. The Fort Titt Na
tional bank was closed yesterday by
the controller for the currency. Last
night national, bank examiners were
making an examination to determine
just what condition the bank is in.
The bank officials declare the insti
tution is entirely solvent and that no
one will lose a cent. The bank has
capital stock of $1,000,000, a surplus
o $1,000,000, and undivided profits of
$137,809.06. It was regarded as one of
the most conservative institutions of
the city. It had been known for some
time, however, that the bank was short
of currency.
Following the controller's action, the
directors issued a statement to the ef
fect that a suspension of business was
forced by the clearing house committee
demanding that the bank immediately
raise a large amount of cash, which
under existing financial conditions it
could not do without great sacrifice.
The only alternative under which
business could be continued was to pay
its clearing house exchange in cur
rency, to do which would exhaust the
bank's supply of ready money within
a few days. In fairness to depositors
and al lothers interested it was deemed
advisable to suspend business.
No excitement attended the closing of
the bank and at no time during the
day was there more than a few loiter
ers around the bank building. No
other institution is involved in the
trouble.
Kansas City Is Confident.
Kansas City. Mo.. Dec. 7. With few
withdrawals from any of the local
banks and increased deposits, the finan
cial situation here today apparently had
assumed normal condition and local
confience has been restored.
Rides and Fares Stolen.
The assertion made by the head of
the surface car system in New York
city that all fares are net paid ap
pears to be well founded. One man
who kept tab v.-hile riding in 19 cars
in six days last week said 24 passen
gers did Eot pay, and that 31 fares
that were paid did not receive recog
nition from the register.
Washington, D. G, Dec. 6. Thrilling
tales of the chase were told tonight
in the state dining room of the White
house. Surrounded by boon compan
iGns of the gun and rod President
Roosevelt swapped stories of exciting
adventures. Looking down from th
walls were the stuffed heads of moose
and other animals which served as
mute witnesses to the prowes of the
chief executive.
The occasion was a dinner the pios
ident gave in honor of the men who
helped him get a bear in Ivoulslana
recently. There were present others
who took part in the unsuccessful hunt
near Smedes, Miss., several years ago,
and a few who never hunted at all ani
who served as the audience. The list
as revealed by one of the guests was
as follows:
Olive Metcalf Ilarley Metcalf, John
Osborn, Tom Osborn, John M. Parker,
Mahor Amacker, Mr. Vesey, Postmaster
General Mayer, Assistant Secretary of
State Bacon, Secretary Loeb, Gifford
Pinchot, Representative Ransdell, J. M.
Dickinson, Col. Cecil Lyon, Capt. Fitz
hugh Lee, Surgeon General Rlxey.
Hear a Piece le Resistance.
The services of the last named were
not required, for the gore shed was
only that which flowed from the pieces
of bear served as the piece de resist
ance of the feast. A plump bruin had
been secured from Alabama and he was
cooked to a turn by the cultivated
pinkney, who occupies the position of
chef at the White house.
During the court of the dinner, the
president referred to the absence of
some-of the men who made his hunting
enjoyable.. Phil Stewart of Colorado,
a brave tracker of mountain lions,
could not come. Ben Lilly, who has
killed 2.000 bears, who knows every
foot of ground in the northern Louisi
ana swamps, and who has lain down
at night with his feet in the hollow
of a tree lest the bear within should
escape while the hunter was asleep,
was too bashful to appear, or perhaps
too busy hunting. Bill Sewall, the
Maine guide, and Capt. Jack Abernathy,
who kills wolves by breaking their
jaws with his naked hands, also were
absent.
Washington, Dec. 7. Carriage mak
ers and manufacturers of farm imple
ments, as well as the men of a num
ber of other industries which are con
cerned in the use of hickory will fol
low with interest a series of tests
of this valuable wood about to begin
at the forest service timber testing
laboratory at Purdue university, at La
fayette, Ind.
The importance of the tests lies in
the fact that they will furnish accurate
data on the relative strength on the
different kinds of hickory, which Is
wood for which no satisfactory sub
stitute has been found. The timber of
no other tree possesses the peculiar
properties which make hickory neces
sary in the manufacture of parts of
vehicle and farm implements.
The hardwood forests of the northern
section of the country are being rapid
ly denuded and it is therefore import
ant that accurate information regard
ing like species in other sections of the
country be obtained. The hickory of
the northern states has always been
considered of better quality than that
of the south and has been quite gen
erally given the preference by manu
facturers and users of this species of
wood. Prejudices once established are
not readily removed and because of
this fact the forest service is pre
paring to prove conclusively the rela
tive merits not only of hickory or the ;
same species obtained in different sec
tions of the country, but also differ
ent species of hickory grown in the
same section. It is intended later to
extend the scope of this work to other
species of wood in the order of their
Importance to the manufacturing in
terest of the country.
A shipment of southern hickory has
just been received at the Purdue tim
ber testing laboratory. This material
was collected by a representative of
the forest service and accurate data
regarding species, growth, and local
ity were taken for each tree from
which the material was obtained.
Other material of the same species, to
be selected, will be treated in a like
manner and all will be tested for the
purpose of determining its strength,
stiffness, and suitability for tho pur
poses for which It is used. The
strength, stiffness, and other data ob
tained by these tests will make pos
sible direct comparison of the merits
of the wood as regards Its species and
locality of growth.
A pinch in the hickory supply has
been felt for several years and it is
already seen that the growing of hick
ory must be encouraged either by na
tural growth or artificial planting, if
the permanence of a number of indus
tries is to be insured. The importance
In this first series of tests by the
United States forest service lies In the
fact that they will determine just what
species of hickory are strongest, and
will give much valuable information
to owners of farm woodlots and others
who plant trees for profit. Not until
It is accurately determined just what
species produce the strongest timber
will it be possible to know Just what
trees to plant. When the report on
tests Is completed, information on the
work will be gladly given to all who
write to the forest service at Wash
ington.
All orders from Hammond or East Chicago
will be given prompt attention.
Married in Sackcloth.
In order not to lose a legacy of
$25,000 left to her by an eccentric
aunt, a young lady was, in France,
some little time ago, married wear
ing a wedding dress which, though
of fashionable cut. wa3 made of
sackcloth.
SURNAMES NOT USED BY KINGS.
Only Christian Names Signed by
Members of Royal Houses.
The origin of most royal houses was
similar throughout Europe, and kings
and their families, speaking broadly,
never had or used surnames. They
signed their Christian names alone.
So universally was this the case
that it became rigid etiquette that a
person of royal birth should not use a
surname, though there have been num
bers of cases of dynasties, like our
own Stuarts, like the Eernadotte dy
nasty of Sweden or like the Bonaparte
family, who unquestionably and in
dubitably had inherited surnames. But
it has always been a puzzle why the
cadet members of our own royal
house do not subscribe themselves as
peers by their peerage designations,
as do other peers.
However, the fact is they do not,
but it has not been discovered what
are the rules which govern their sig
natures. The sovereign fiigns by the
Christian name and usually adds "R."
or "R. and I." Princes and princesses
sign by their Christian names and
sometimes, but not always, add the
letter "P." When or why this is added
or omitted is not known.
But the habits of royalty lead oth
ers into strange happenings. There
was an occasion upon which Queen
Victoria after a "function" was asked
to sign a visitor's book. Her majesty
write "Victoria R. and I." Princess
Henry of Battenberg then wrote
"Beatrice P." The turn of the local
mayoress came next and she signed
"Elizabeth." The surname was hastily
written in the following day, but too
late to prevent the story gaining currency.
