Important Official Order.
Hon. S. P. Chase, Secrotarv of ths Treas
ury, Lbs issued an important order relative
to the seizure of property In disloyal States
by the national forces, llio order provides,
in brief, tbat there shall be agents appointed
in the different places conquered by our
arms, who shall secure and prepare for
market the cotton, rice and such other pro
ducts as may be seized, and that the naval
Bed military authorities shall aid in this
work. Slaves or in the euphemism of the
Secretary "persons held to service for life
under Slate laws" may be employed by the
agents, and will be organijed for systematized
labor, in securing and preparing for markot
their products. Fay-rolls will be prepared,
end a just compensation allowed to these
laborers, the amount to be fixed by the
agent, and approved by the military com
tnandant and the Secretary of the Treasury.
An inventory of all stock and a record of all
products taken will be carefully made by the
gents and officers. The cotton and other
foods will be shipped to this city for market,
end accounts will be Bottled by the Secretary
of the Treasury. The agent must so trans
act business, tbat as little Injury as possible
tray accrue to loyal citlsens, of those who
within reasonable time may assume the
character of loyal citizens.
Southern Union Sentiment.
It is not nnfrequently that we hear some
tee remark that It will no.t do to trust to
the Union sentiment which is believed to
exist in the South for aid In suppressing the
rebellion snd restoring the authority of the
laws. So far in the South wherever onr
arms have been victorious, or the least evi
dence of onr success has been manifested,
the people in those States seem ready at once
to return to their allegiance, and, if it were
cot fur the force which threatens them from
tbe rebel government and their armed bands,
this manifestation would be more lively and
extensive in every part of tho South, oxcept,
perhaps, in South Carolina the nest of the
present conspiracy against popular govern
rrent. We know that in Western Virginia
and the eastern counties it has been so. In
North Carolina, as soon as our forces landed,
the people, who felt secure, proclaimed for
the Union.
eastern lennessee is openly In arms
egttinst the usurpation, and in the city
tie yi Ork ass tbe Unionists have been found
organized against the government, and their
organization is found so threatening that the
rebel government has become alarmed at its
character, and has undertaken to break it np
by force and the arrest of the prominent
actors in it. Theae facta are all positive in
dicutions that the present rebellion does not
refit upon the popular sentiment, but
maintained by the force with which It was
first inaugurated. In faot, it can not be
Otherwise, When we look at the prosperity
which eveVy-where exlste previous to the
rebellion, the security every-where enjoyed,
both in property and person, and contrast
these advantages, the greatest which any
government can confer npon a people, with
the miserable prostration of trade In the
South, tbe destruction of business, tho suffer
ing among tbe people, the vast accumulation
of debt to be paid out of their toil hereafter, the
desolation and misery of war, and the utter
bcpelesssess of ever living in peace, even
successful in their purpose of separation, with
tbe powerful, wealthy, enterprising and in
due trious States of the North, the prospect
before the people of the rebellious Btatos
tnuat be gloomy, and the present effect sad
opening and dieheartealng. Whatever ad
vantages promised themselves can be no
greater than they were previously enjojiog,
while the sacrifice tbey will have to make to
effect a change Lringiog no greater benefit
ere enough to appal the stoutest hearts, even
where a more ennobling cause animated the
people to revolution. It is contrasts like
these which are bringing the people of the
South to their reason, and giving force
the opposition agaiost the wicked usurpation.
Just in proportion as our arms become tri
umphant will this sentiment grow stronger
and more active, till tbe rebel power, finding
itself pre&sed powerfully from the outside,
and weakening continually from the Inside,
will be compelled to give way, and the au
thority of legitimate popnlar government
again extended over a willing people.
Honest Joe holt.
The Washington correspondent of the
BpriDgfield Rrpnlliean says Mr. Linoo'.n
pays great respect to the opinions of Mr.
Holt in all tbat he does in reference to Ken
tucky. A day or two since a Kentucky Re
publican, a moderate and moat worthy man,
asked a small favor of Mr. Lincoln, and was
referred to Mr. Joseph Holt. "If hi says yon
ought to be attended to, I will do so," was
the reply of tbe President. Tbe man went
away somewhat indignant, especially as 11
Iioit was bis old political adversary.
Brigadier Thomas A. Morris.
There has been considerable surprise man
ifested, and not little fault finding in
Western States, because Brigadier-General
Thomas A. Morris, of Indiana, bus not been
assigned a command. General Morris was
very successful in Western Virginia daring
his short campaign, but his whole force being
three months' men, when their time expired
they left tbe service, and General Morris was
thus forced into retirement, where he has
since remained. He is a graduate of West
Point, end has the reputation of being a very
fine officer.
Letters to Soldiers.
A volunteer writes home and asks why
friends do cot write ofiener. He says "No
one knows the joy of receiving a letter until
he has been a soldier. It comes like a wel
come messenger from old familiar scenes and
is welcomed as a friend direct from home.
Write often to your soldier friends, and write
cheerful, brave letters, about all the affairs
at home. Children write tbe best letters,
they tell all the little things tbat happen."
If it is such a luxury to receive letter,
see bo reason why the brave fellows bow
service shonld not have a continued taut.
It is a cheap and not unpleasant way to
abeeat enes tbat they are still kindly
remembered. Let all who have friends
the army try it
Fire and Brimstone.
A citizen of Salem, Mass., well known for
his inventive genius, has given his attention
to the subject, and, ills said, has concocted
a preparation which, when Ignited, becomes
an unquenchable flame of fire and brimstone.
Ee proposes to put it u p in glass bottles, make
an ascension in a balloon, Boat over tbe
camps of the rebels, toss over the bottles,
which, npon breaking, will explode and set
the camp on fire and blow np ammunition
wagons making them, to use Scriptural
largnage, as Sodom and Gomorrah. Not to
speak profanely, in bis teal to preserve the
Government, he wants to give the rebels a
foretaste of the wrath to comet There may
be difficulties In the execution of such a plan,
but a few experiments would test its efficacy.
It would be a novelty in war to see fire and
brimstone rained npon the jpbel?, but
stranger things have happened. We pre
sume this is tbe Yankee who proposes to
close the war on "contract."
The Land Office.
The report of Mr. Edmonds, Commissioner
of tbe General Land Office, shows that since
the 30ih of June, 18G0, there have been sur
veyed 8,892,125 acres of the public lands,
which have not yet been offered for sle.

Our Foreign Policy.
of
President Lincoln avows his purpose to
adhere to a cautious and prudent policy in
relation to foreign affairs. There need be
no apprehensions of the ocenrrence of hostli
itles between the United States and Great
Britain; for, unless the British Government
should seek a pretext for war, there U no
ground for creating serious difficulties. It
Is said tbe Cabinet at Washington feels no
anxiety on this subject, believing that
temperate policy will allay excited feelings
and tend to cement the friendly relations
which have hitherto existed between the
two countries.
An Item Not in the Bill.
A eye-witness of the arrest of Messrs,
Mason and Slldell furnishes the Panama Star
and Herald with some particulars of the
affair, which would be amusing If they were
not so seriously told. Miss Slidell, we learn
from this veracious observer, not only re
sisted the attempts of Lieutenant Fairfax to
take possession of her father, but went so far
as to bare her breast, defying death, itself.
The former Captain of the Jeff Davis, it is

Interesting Southern News.
The Richmond Diipaich of Saturday, the ,

Charleston:
Charleston. November 29. The patriotlo
planters of the seaboard are hourly applying
tbe torch to their crops of cotton and rice.
Those who have not the heart to apply the
torch themselves have authorized tbe mili
tary authorities, to save'their crops from tbe
ravages ana lust or tne enemy, to aestroy
every thing before them. Tbe plantations
on North Edistoand its neighborhood, are
now in one theet of flames and smoke
throughout. Parties from below unite In

General Humphrey Marshall has written
a lying letter to tne war .Department at
Richmond, in reference to the battle at
Piketon, Ky. He says :
The Piketon battle occurred with 300 Con
federates against 1,500 Federals. Our troops
lost one killed, four wounded and seven
missing. Tbe Federal loss was killed, 200
counted, 140 wounded and 200 prisoners.
Tbe unequal loss resulted from the fact that
our men were successfully ambuscaded, and
tbe enemy were entrappea.

and Mr. Bishop Is confident that with five of
tnese stnguiar vessels tne blockade ot all tne
inmortant ports of the Confederacy could be
destioved and kept destroyed, and the ports
kept open to the commerce of friendly na
tions. We may remark that Mr. Bishop's
plan of opening channels and deepening
them, which was laid before a soientiln
board at Washington two years ago, met
wiih the entire approbation of the three em
inent engineers who composed it, with that
of Mr Toucey, Secretary of the Navy, and
Mr. Flojd, Secretary of War. He has
charter from the Legislature of Louisiana for
permanently deepaning the passes at tbe

South Carolina ts to be next, may be, in suf
fering, to Virginia, as it will learn by the
news in our columns. The armada is to dis
gorge its bate and f ury on South Carolina.
We hope President Davis, and the troops on
tbe Potomac, lying on their books In the sun,
feel very corutoi table, but we do not envy
tbam their glorious inactivity:
It is vuin to hope that Lincoln or hts nartv
will ever make peace as long as they can
carry on tbe war npon onr territory. An in
explicable policy bas allowed tnein to take
possession of a large portion of Virginia,
where they are ruiuing the country aud its
people as fait as tbey can. As long as they
con conduct the war in that way, so long
will they refute to listen to peace. Only by
carrying It into their own territories can tbe
people of Yankeedom be reached, and made
to take tbe matter out of tbe bands of the
politicians. As things are managed at pres
ent we have no hope of such a consumma
tion. Virginia bas been selected as the
battle-field. It is not enough that she has
70,000 men nnder arms it is not enough
that she has furnished 83,000 stand of arms
to troops belonging toother States it is not
enough that she has fed the whole enormous
army congregated on tbe Potomac for
months it is not enough that she has fur
Dished them with cannon, and powder, and
balls it is not enOngh that she has done
more for this war than all the other States

am. I abked one of them to take a letter
out with him to Cuba and mail it for me;
said he would, and that be was going
leave in the morning.
The times are dull enough here now, and
as there is comparatively nothing doing
tbe stores, tbey close from two to tour o'clock
in the afternoon. There is nothing doing
except for the army. There are very
goods in the city now, and what there
are bringing just what they choose to
for them. I wi.l give you a list of some
atd their prices I Cotton flannel, 60
60c. per yard ; coarse cloths any price; blan
kets, none to be had; shoes (coarse brogam),
none to be bad, last sold at $3 per pair; bacon
25c. per ponnd; bam, 3i)4c. per ponnd; bat

(except rice) in proportion. Every luxury
that we used to bave from abroad is dis

frost. It is expected that some visitors from
the North will be down this way before long,
and arrangements are making to give them

fortified. The prisoners were maved

If the United States troops do no better
tiae to come than they bave as yet, I think
tbe war will be a short one, for I bave
known of their being victorious as yet
once (at Hatteras), and the battle of Manas

ailair on the Federal side; but probably
newspaper accounts printed at tne North

I hope it may be short. Tbe worst thing that
can befall a Government is civil war, and
this I believe to be the worst kind of oae. It

There are a great many people here that have

OUR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
WASHINGTON, Thursday, December 5.
The miners relation to foreign affairs, aoeom-
ranving tbe President's Message, cover four
hnndred and twenty-five pages.
Minister Adams writes to Mr. Beward, May
17. annonnolos: bis safe arrival at London. &o..
to which Mr. Seward replies that l
This Government eonilders that our relations
In Europe have reacbed a oriels, in whloh It Is
Decesiary for It to take a decided stand, on
whloh not only its Immediate measures, but Us
ultimate and permanent policy, on be deter
mined and defined. At the same time it nei
ther means to menace Great Britain nor to
wound the snseeptibllity of that or any other
European nation. That polioy is developed in
this paper.
After instrnotlog Mr. Adams on the subjeot
of the blockade, Ac, Mr. Seward ssvs i
As to the recognition ef the so-called South
ern Confederaev, it is not to ba mad the sub
ject of technical definition. It Is, of coarse,
rilrunt rMOffiiltion to cuDiisa an bokdowibuk-
tnent of tbe sovereignty and independence of
a new Power. It Is direct recognition u re
ceive its Embarsadors, Ministers, Agents or
nnmmlialonara officially. A oonoession of bel
ligerent riffhi is liable to be construed as a
reoofmltion of them. No one of these pro
eeedioM will pus unquestioned by th United
States In this cfcse.
Mr. Adams, In a subsequent dispaton, details
his Interview with Lord John Rnssell, remark-
ins that Lord Russell said "he did not himself
know waat ne was to say. xi it was expeoieu
of him to give any pledge of an absolute na
tare that hts Government would not at any
future time, do matter what the otroumstanoes
might be, recognise an existing Btata in Amer
Isa. It was more than be could nromle," o.
In the course of the oorrespondenoe Mr.
Beward says:
"The British Government can never expet
to Induce the United States to acqulesoe in ber
aBnmed position of tils Government as divided
In any degree in tbe powers of war more than
for peace. At the same time, If Her Majesty's
Government shall continue to practice absolute
forbearance from any interference in onr domes

inauire what name It sivos to that forbearance,
or in wnat cnarsocern present r.scu oeioro ids

friendly power, acting nnoonsclo'isly of a do
mettia disturbance among u of whloh friendly
States ean take no oognirartoe. On this point
our views are not likely to undergo any obange.
In maintaining this noaltion, we are sure we do

OUR RELATIONS WITH FRANCE.
The correspondence wjth France ts volnmln
on; Btoretarr Seward to Minister Dayton,
May 30, says:
I first desire that M. Thouvenel may be in
formed that this Government can not but regard
ar-y communications held by the French Gov
ernment, even though unofficial, wlih the
agents of the Insurrectionary movement in this
country, as exceptional and injurious to the
dignity and Donor ot tne united states, 'xney
piotrot against this Intercourse, however, not
so much on that ground as on another. They
deelre to maintain the most cordial relations
wl'h tbe Government of France, and would
therefore, if possible, refrain from complaint;
but It is manifest that even an unofficial recep
tion of the emissaries of disunion has aoertaln
though measured tendency to give them a
pres-ige wblcb would encourage weir eilorta to
prosecute a civil war aeetruouve to tne pros
perity of this country, and aimed at the over
i brow of tbe Government itself It is earnestly
hoped tbat this protest may be sufficient to
relieve this Government from the necessity of
an action in the nnpleasant subject to whioalt
related.
Secondly The United States cut not for
moment allow the French Government to rest
under the delusive belief that they will be con
tent to bave th Con ft derate States reoognlzed
as a belligerent power by States with whiob.tb.la
catien is In amity. No concert of action
among foreign States so lecogntslog the insurgents,
can reconcile the United Bute to auoh
a proceeding, whatever may be the oonseqaenoe
of resiu'enee.
Thirdly The President turns away from
theee points of apprehended aificrenee of opin
ion between the two Governments, to Bailee
other and more agreeable subjoot.

lately released from confinement as a
at Fort Warren, lajs: -
One of the prisoners, 8. B. Frost, was taken
at Fort Hatteras. lie li a young man, a native
of Connecticut, where his father rotidos. When
tbe rebellion broke oat he was keeping sohool
at the South. Ee says be went to Fort Hat
teres to visit a friend among the offioers of
garrison, and while there the plaoe was stormed
and captured. That he might be better
than the bulk of the prisoners, he claimed
be tbe colonel's orderly, and by doing so
was "messed" with tbe offioers. After
arrival at Fort Warren, he wrote to Secretary
Beward a statement of bis ease, and was there
fore plaecd npon the list of poUUoal prisoners.
An investigation, bv order of Mr. Beward,
sulted in bis dlaeharge, and be new foes
to Connecticut. He says that while there
some itnorant men among the Hatteras prison
ers, the majority of the privates are persons
ordinary intelligence, and some 01 mam
wealthy otusens.
The Latest from Port Royal.
The steamer Vanderbilt arrived at New
York on Friday last from Port Royal, 8. O.
Nothing of special importance bad tran
spired since the departure of the steamer
The naval expedition WAS fitting out with
all possible speed, and would leave on its
mission ss soon as the troops from Fortress
Monroe and Annapolis should arrive.
Port Roral Harbor bas been surveyed and
buoys bave been placed, so that a vessel
drawing twenty-five feet of water can enter
troops continues.
Beaufort is still unoccupied by tbe Federal
troops. Visits are daily made to that place
by officers of the army and navy. Several
transports were busily discharging stores,
ordnance, Ac, at Port Royal.
Tbe contrabands to the number of about
one thousand still remained In the vicinity
of the forts, and others were coming in. The
large stores of potatoes, vegetables and fruit
lett by tne anrigntea reoeis was turnisning
an abundant supply of wholesome food, and
the negroes, as well as many of the troops,
were employed in securing it.
Large numbers ot cattle, nogs ana Dorses
had naturally fallen into the possession of
the slaves, as well as furniture and household
effects, which they were offering for sale at
any price tbe soldiers were willing to pay.
REBEL PROPERTY SEIZED.
The Seventy-ninth Regiment had been on
an expedition toward Charleston, captured
three batteries and spiked the guns, retut ned
after having a reconnoissance to within
twenty miles of Charleston. A large amount
of cotton was found stored ready for ship
ment, but the rebels were Improving every
opportunity to burn and destroy it.
Tbe ea!y reply to General Sherman's pro
clamation was "Take care of yourselves and
Ill .fnn,,.!..,, nnunnull.
none but slaves occupied Beaufort.
THE REBELS BURNING COTTON.
Four days before the Vanderbilt sailed, a
gun boat want up one of the rivers in the
vicinitv oi t on itovai. ana remained over
night. On the passage up vast quantities of
cotton were discovered stored ready lor gin
ning. The gun-boat penetrated for several
miles. JNO rebels were discovered; but on
the return the cotton which had been noticed
was found on fire: and as far as could be seen
in all directions dense smoke rose in cloud?,
indicating tbat an organized ettort to burn
all the cotton, and probably other property,
bad been made. The rebels, it is thought,
were nnder the impression that the vessel
baa come for tbe purpose ot seizing it. How
ever, not a single white man was seen.
An Arrival from Nashville.
Mr. A. B. Barker, arrived from Nashville,
Tenn., last evening, having left that place
on tbe 23d nit. He made bis way to this city
with much difficulty, as he was known to be
a Union man, and was nnable to obtain a
pass from the rebel authorities. Mr. Barker
has resided in Nashville during the past two
years, and, as he was immediately connected
with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad
op to tbe time of his departure, enjoyed fine
opportunities for observing the movements
of the arrnv in ttiat Quarter.
It will be remembered that Governor Har
ris, of Tennessee, made a requisition a few
months ago, for thirty thousand men and
additional arms. The eall met, with no
response whatever, and the authorities were
compelled to resort to a drcift in order to fill
the requisition. The vf ork of drafting com
menced in Nashville the day of his depart
ure.
He estimates the number of rebel troons
between Nashville and Bowling Green at
twenty-eigut tD.ou.woa. xie assures as that
ther are miserably fed and badlr clothed.
aud that there is a great deficiency in tbe
matter of arms. Many of them, too, are ill,
and be thinks there are fully three thousand
five hnndred sick soldiers in Nashville alone.
No attention is given to the payment of
toe troops, ana tne soldiers nave been so ac
customed to tbat sort of neglect that they do
not expect to receive remuneration for their
service, being but too glad if they can obtain
sufficient snbsistence to keep their souls and
bodies togetber.
Mr. Barker was familiar wltn many or tne
boys who left this city and joined the rebel
army, and relates some amusing episodes in
their histories down there. lie says that
Blanton Duncan has fallen into disgrace even
there, having given np tbe pursuit after mil
ltory lame ana adopted gamoiing as a pio-
rtssion. iionttttue journal, tin.
