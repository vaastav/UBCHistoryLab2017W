ARE NOT ALTOGETHER BAD.
The article in the Saturday Evening Post by J. D. Archbald, vice presi
dent of the Standard Oil company, is worthy of the attention of every Ameri
can who is interested in the economic problems that have been raised as a
result of the centralization of capital.
Since the recent financial flurry, which is partly due to the persistent
agitation against corporations, the opinion is more generally prevalent that
there are good corporations and that while there are also bad ones, even
those bad ones have their good points.
Mr. Archibald's article brings out this fact most forcibly. The Standard
Oil company has for many years been looked upon as one of the predatory
concerns that are a menace to the welfare of the people of the whole country.
But in spite of the charges of stifling competition, of accepting rebates
to crush the small dealer, it is apparent that even this giant of octopi has
had troubles of its own.
Mr. Archbald points to the fact that unlike many of the other large
corporations the Standard Oil company has not inflated its stock to enormous
proportions in order that its dividends may appear nominal.
On a small capitalization it has been paying
the yellow press and their readers have gasped,
been four times as large and the dividend had been

and

the
On the other hand if the capitalization had been four times as large the
company would have been accused of an equally great crime, of watering its
Btock and foisting it upon this same unthinking public.
So it appears that the big corporation of today is between two fires. If
by conservative management and the utilization of numerous by-products a
manufacturing concern Is enabled to make a handsome profit, the public
seems unwilling that they should enjoy the fruits of its own industry and
intelligence. j.
it is true that there nave been a great many pernicious practices on the
part or certain concerns that have laid them open to criticism, but it is also
true that much or this criticism has been unjust and has worked an inesti
mable damage to organized capital throughout the country.

WITH THE EDITORS
cers and It Is Impossible to secure
enough enlisted m-;n."
Interest is quickened. "What shall be
done to bring the army up to its
proper complement? The rate of offi
cers' pay, says the president, should
be "greatly increased," and there
should be a "relatively even greater in
crease In the pay for the enlisted men."
Vborefore the enactment of the Diek
Capran service pay bill is recommend
ed. Under that bill the pay of officers
is to be increased from ten per cent,
in the highest grades to twenty-five
per cent, in thr- lower commissioned
grades, and the president is authorized
to fix the pay of unlisted men. If
there should be " a relatively even
greater increase" in the case of the
private soldiers and the non-commissioned
officers, they may expect a lib
eral raise from the president.
As Mr. Roosevelt points out, there
are other things wrong with the army
besides Inadequate pay. Evidently
his attention has been drawn to stric
tures on the service which have ap
peared in the newspapers, often anony
mously from a fear of exile to the
Philippines. Twice the president rec
ommends the creation of a "special
corps" to cio the manual, m?nial and
unmilitary labor which is now imposed
upon the enlisted man vastly to his dis
gust and discontent. What visitor to
a post but has seen him in soiled
clothes doing hated chores that de
tract from the dignity and smartness of
the soldier? When it comes to "prac
tice marches" Mr. Roosevelt has no
patience witli those who say that therf
is too much "hiking" in the hot sun
-0r the physical welfare of the enlisted
men. Let the marches be continued
and entended, urges the president. In
making the same recommendation with
regard to field nienoeures lie is on
irer ground there can hardly be too
much training. Mr. Roosevelt is not
satisfied with the horsmanship of the
army. He wants "a far more rigid
and thoroughgoing test" for all field
onicers. Apparently the riding school
at West Point is at fault in its meth
ods, or the officers soon lose their seats
r.d shun the back of a horse. We are
inclined to think that the president
by implication falls to do justice to the
equestrianism of field officers. There
may be some marines among them,
but as a class they ride as well as he
does, or better.
Mr. Roosevelt is extremely vague
when he proposes for the encourage
ment of the private soldier a rank in
the army corresponding to that of war
rant officer in the navy. How could it
be managed outside of the Coast Artil
lery; which requires the services of
skilled mechanics? A chief boatswain.
a chief gunner, a chief carpenter, a
hief sailmaker or a warrant machin
ist in the navy is one or tne mose use
ful and intelligent men in the service,
tncl often he receives more pay than a
second lieutenant in the army, some
times, but too seldom to excite the
envy or his shipmates, he wins promo
tion to the rank of Ensign. In the
army commissions are to be o'otained
with less difficulty by enlisted men,
and as there is now a dearth of sub
alterns the sober, obedient and edu
cated soldier need not envy the war
rant officer of the navy. The organ
ization and needs of the army are so
different from those of the other ser
vice that there seems to be few places
in the army which a "warrant officer"
could fill. It is a pity that the presi
dent, Instead of discussing reforms
diffusely, did not confine himself to the
Dick-Capron .pay bill and urge congress
to pass it promptly. New York Sun.

THE PASSING OF THE PANIC
AND OF THE OCCASION OF IT.
Matters are much improved. The
conditions of money are steadily ap
proaching the normal. A subdued
activity is seen In general business and
It is possible to take account of stock
and determine the extent of the dam
age Incurred. The spectocle is impres
sive. No precening panic ever ap
proached It for the impartiality and
extent with which the ruin was dis
tributed. Since Mr. Roosevelt came into the
presidency he has conducted an ex
traordinary campaign againr-t wealth,
and In particular against the railroads.
His hatred of the last named has
taken the form of an intellectual ob
session or lesion. It began with his
rublic declaration that the accepted
definition of property must be changed,
and it proceeded cumultaively ever since
until it culminated in the rresent
commercial convulsion.
Of Mr. Roosevelt's proficiency in the
arts of the politician, in tho worst
significance of that word, he has
left us no room for doubt. A more
canscienceless of more reckless dema
gogue never afflicted this country. By
slow and insidious degrees he has
upset tho public confidence, arrayed
class against class, and fomented mis
trust and hatred. No one ever ap
proached him in creating a hopeless
disaffection and unrest in the ranks
of labor. He joined a labor union un
der conditions of intense publicity; he
has constituted himself the champion
of every known extremity of labor
agitation; he has associated upon
terms of close personal intimacy with
the worst and most sinister figures
among- those professional disturbers
of whom Orchard. Mover, Fottibone and
lluywood are the familiar expression,
and lie has welcomed them as the
guests of the president of the United
States in the White House in Wash
ington. All tills lias been accom
panied by the steady denunciation and
sophistical vituperation of capital in
vested in railroads and therefore in
most intimate contact with the peo
ple by steady abuse of what he
called swollen fortunes and by fix
ing public attention on abuses in
corporate management in ways as
subtle a? irresponsible, but excellently
devised to arouse and inflame the pub
lic mind.
Any vulgar and unscrupulous dema
gogue could have done the same thing
with no particular harm to the great
body politic; but when the role of
agitator and of sower of evil seed is
taken up by the president of the
United States and he goes up and down
the land engendering discontent, jeal
ousy and hatred in the hearts of the
people it is a Tery different and a very
serious thing. Even in time of over
flowing national prosperity, even in
"o of & prosperity more evenly dis
tributed and shared than .ever before
m the history of this or any other
country, it was possible for Mr. Rooso
velt to achieve a disaster that ordi
narily could ensue only in time of
great public depression, disappoint
ment and common misfortune.

indifference and contempt and dis

VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.
Toleston, Ind. Dec. 9, 1907.
Editor Lake County Times:
I noticed in a recent issue of the
Lake County Times, where a lady of
Hegewisch lost some money in a fire,
and naturally considered it a complete
lost.
Mv own experience may be of value
to iier anil others who might have this
experience in the future, to recover
such losses.
Severn 1 years ago I lived in Windsor
Park, and by some mistake my wife
threw her pocket book with some paper
into the fire and the pocket book and
money ($1-) were apparently a total
loss, as it was burned to a crisp. The
two fives and a two dollar paper could
not be distinguished from one another.
I was careful not to crash nor disturb
the burnt crisp, except to remove it
from the frame of the pocket book.
I showed it to Mr. McGrath, then
Cashier of the Calumet National bank.
South Chicago, who advised me to
throw it awav, but nevertheless I
called at the office of the United States
sub-treasury in Chicago and followed
their instructions, towit:
I made an affidavit to the fact that
I was a citizen of the United States
and had lost the money in a fire, and
that it was my property. I also had
the notary attach a statement that he
know me personally for several years
past, that I was a law abiding citizen,
and that ho had every reason to be
lieve that my statement was true, and
with these papers I sent the ashes to
the third assistant to the treasury of
United States, Washington. D. C.
In a few days to my surprise I re
ceived by mail two fives and a two
dollar green back, crisp and new as
though they had just been issued the
day before.
Yours Repectfully,
J. Q. JAMES.
There will be no Coulon-Murphy fight
at Dolton, 111., tonight, nor will there
be a boxing show of any kind in that
burg, which has recentlv gained cn- tlle
siderable prominence through the ad
vertising of tho bantam-weight light
in mention.
Sheriff Christopher Strassheim last
night announced that as Dolton was
situated in Cook county he would pre
vent the entertainment being held.
This lie did at the request of Fred
Webber and John S. Harter, two num
bers of the board of trustees of the
town of Dolton. When told by Webber
and Harter that a prize fight had b-en
extensively advertised to take place
at Delmar's hall in Dolton the sheriff
readily agreed to stop it.
Instructs Deputy Sheriff.
Forthwith Deputy Sheriff Thomas
Morrison was instructed to inform Joe
Choynski, physical director of the
Illinois Athletic club, who was engaged
to referee the contest between Coulon
and Murphy, that the battle Would not
be allowed. He was also notified to
bear similar instructions to Manaeer
Joe Levy and other officers of the
Twin City Athletic club, under the
auspices of which the bouts were to
be held.
None of the officials of the Dolton
club could be found last night, but it
goes without saying that in view of
the sheriff's orders no attempt will be
made to stage the show, and if Coulon
and Murphy are to settle their grudge
they will have to seek other battle
grounds at some future time.
Extensive preparations had been
made for the show, with an arrange
ment to seat 1,200 persons, and tickets
were to have been sold at $3 each
They would have all been sold, too,
as interest in the bout, which was
virtually a championship ailalr, was
intense. A special train had been en
gaged to carry the fans to the ring
side, and besides the main contest two
other good bouts were to have been
fought, making the show in all one of
excellent class. Great is the disap
pointment thereof.
Promoter Slow to Ltjirn,
This is only one of several shows
that have . been attemptel by en
terprising but not far-seeing pro
motors within the Cook county bound
ary line only to be stopped by the
authorities at the eleventh hour, and
it seems they will never learn. '
Coulon and Murphy were trained to
the hour, and fit for the fight of their
lives, but their hard work was all for
naught unless one of the outside clubs
at Milwaukee, Peoria, or even New
York or Phildelphia, take advantage
of the chance to grab one of the best
matches between little fellows that
could possibly be arranged.
BOOK REVENUES TO BE

adopted resolutions declaring that the
money received from the sale of its

hiring ceaches for the baseball and
football teams and supporting generally
the other athletic teams, especially the
crew. The board expects to get about
$4,000 from the sale of these member-

The Army in the Message.
In dealing with army matters In his
message President Roosevelt wm vol-
i uminous but vague. He argued that a
i cheap army is poor economy, which
nobody would deny. He undertook to
show by citing the casualties of Indus
try that the outcry in America against
militarism, a system under which com
paratively few persons are killed any
where, is absurd. The logic is bewil
dering, and it was superfluous because
Mr. Roosevelt had dealt with the topic
sufficiently when he said that there
were foolish people "who denounce
any care of the army or navy as mill
tarims" but that "these people are not
numerous." The first grain of wheat
among the chaff is to befound In the

in the compass of her slender purse.
With two invalids boarding was out
of the question, and a summer cot
tage, uo matter how small, had so far
been beyond the means of Penelope,
the breadwinner of the family, a
frail but determined girl, the idol of
the crowded city schoolroom in which
she taught Day after day since
school closed she had answerexl ad
vertisements, only to be disappointed.
And it was imperative that the two
invalids should have country nlr. Ruth
grew paler week by week, and Mrs.
Compton but Penelope never dared
to think of that, for she needed nil
the courage at her command. On this
particular afternoon the pathetic pa
tience of Iluth's question nerved Penel
ope to further effort. Something must
be found! It was a matter of life and
death!
Rising suddenly from her seat by
the window, Penelope caught up her
hat that lay on a chair near by and
began to pin it on with swift, nerv
ous gestures.
"Are you going to try again?" said
T.nth, the quickening of hope in her
voice.
"I am going to take a 6treet car any
car and go out to the end of the line
and then ask from door to door till I
find what I want," said Penelope ve
hemently. "Do you feel strong enough,
dear, to be left alone with mother?"
"Oh, yes." responded Ruth, brighten
ing, as she always did at the expecta
tion that their El Dorado might yet be
reached.
Penelope stumbled blindly upon the
first car that came. Beneath her brave
exterior she was weary and sick at
heart, but the keen rush of the air past
her as the car left the crowded streets
and took a downward grade in a more !
sparsely populated district was tonic
and refreshing. She began to feel less
tired, less hopeless. The car whizzed
on through suburbs with trim, fenced
in houses and green fields that stretch
ed away in pleasant undulations. The
leaves of the trees rustled, silver green
in the afternoon light. When the end
of the line was reached Penelope got
out. her spirits rising. Surely among
the cottages dotted here and there
would be one that answered her re
quirements. But Penelope eoon discov
ered that they were all rented. It was
a thriving community, and there were
no vacancies. Tears welled in Penel
ope's eyes, and she was forced to stop
and wipe away the brimming drops.
"I must find something." she said al
most savagely. "I must! I will!"
A shady road opened before her.

up a sweet briery perfume from the
roadside. Cottages became fewer and
fewer. Finally there were none at all.
It became very still. Now and then a
twig dropped or a tree toad chirred.
The peace of it was balm to Penelope's
tired nerves. She delighted in the flick
ering, leafy shadows, the warm es
sences of the earth. She paused to
lean on fence rails and look at bits of
views framed by swaying branches.
She lingered to gaze at the ruins of
what had once been a fine brick man
sion and which now stood Cre charred
and desolate. A little way farther on
Penelope came upon the barn tielong
lng to it. It was a large, spacious
structure, its red paint storm worn
and peeling, its weathercock stf.l twirl
ing merrily as if in defiance to sun and
rain.
Moved by an impulse she could
scarcely define, Penelope tiptoed up to
it and looked in Its window. The inte
rior was clean and airy. A few wirps
of straw showed at the edge of the
mow; the stalls were dimly hospitable.
But it was the great width down the
center of the barn that made Penelope
thrill with sudden resolve. If only her
idea were feasible! She wrenched at
the door. It was bolted and did not
yield. She looked in the window again
and then, fired with the rapture of her
find, went back along the road whence
she had first come, her feet seeming
liardly to touch the earth. By diligent
inquiry among the cottage colony she
learned that the barn belonged to peo
ple by the name of Mason, but they
had been abroad for years, and a Mr.
Frederick Carey was in charge of the
-ropertv. Back to the city went Pe
nelope, hunted up a directory and aft
erward Mr. Carey. To him she breath
lessly broached her plsn. Would ho
rent her the barn for the season?
Mr. Carey's lips twitched. Penelope
was so pretty, so desperately tn ear
nest! Then as her words tumbled over
ach other in her eagerness he caught
a feeting glimpse of her life, grim
with struggle against desperate odds.

sons, with their immense fortune. Mr.
Carey's iosition was one of friendship
fts well as trust, which left him a mar
gin for any altruism he choose, and he
Mailed inwardly as he thought of the
Masons' amusement when they found
tx what uses their barn had been put.
It was a radiant Penelope whogreet
rd her family at nightfall, and a week
Ititer they were ensconced in their
row home. The great floor of the barn
n-as the living room. The stalls held
rots, and the loft was stored with Hn
ti and weariDg apparel. Gay posters
p.nd magazine pictures decorated the
trails. Bright calico cushions were
iileel on a sofa constructed of soap
xxes. Bowls of wild flowers stood
riere and there. And Penelope, trip
ping about with a new elasticity to
her step, was like a wild flower her
self, joyous with bloom.
Every day the great doors of the
barn were open, and air and sunshiue
rioted within. By night came cool,
dewy odors of hedgerow and field.
Week by week Penelope's mother

He came the next afternoon with

After he had ridden away Penelope
went and slood by her favorite fence

came a soft thudding of hoofs behind
her. Aldrich Mason was back again.
"Don't think me an Infernal bound

like to ask if I'm if I'm cutting In on

"No." Penelope said, with a smile.
'If I write to you will you"
"Perhaps." said Penelope demurely.
"Good!" he cried buoyantly and rode
away a second time.

happy flutter at her heart. The fairy,

Practical Wives.
The wives of men of sentiment often
possess a vein of strong common sense
and a matter of fact nature which may
at times serve to bring their poetical
husbands down from their flights of
fancy rather rudely.
