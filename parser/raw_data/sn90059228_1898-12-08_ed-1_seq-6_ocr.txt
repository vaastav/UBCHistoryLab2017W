Washington. Dec. 5.*Following is the
-text of President McKinley's annual
message read at the opening of the last
session.of the Fifty-first congress:
To the Senate and House Of Representa
tives Notwithstanding the added burdens
rendered necessary by the war. our people
rejoice in a very satisfactory and steadily
increasing degree of prosperity evidenced
by the largest volume of business ever re
corded. Manufacture has been productive,
agricultural pursuits have yielded abun
dant returns, labor in the fields of industry
is better rewarded, revenue legislation
passed by the present congress has in
creased the treasury's receipts to the
amount estimated by its authors, the
finances of the government have been suc
cessfully administered and its credit ad
vanced to the first rank, while its currency
has been maintained at the world's highest
standard. Military service under a com
mon flag and for a righteous cause has
stiergthened the national spirit and served
to cement more closely than ever the fra
ternal bonds between every section of the
country. A review of the relation of the
United States to other powers, always ap
propriate, is this year of primary impor
tance in view of the momentous issues
which have arisen, demanding in one in
stance the ultimate determination by arms
and involving far-reaching consequences
which will require the earnest attention
of the congress.
SPAIN AND CUBA,.
A Resume of the Conditions Which
Led Up to the War.
In my last annual message very full con
sideration was given to the question of
the duty of the government of the United
States toward Spain and the Cuban in
surrection as being by far the most im
portant problem with which we were then
called upon to deal. The considerations
then advanced, and the exposition of the
views therein expressed, disclosed my
sense of the extreme gravity of the situ
ation. Setting aside, as logically un
founded or practically inadmissible, the
recognition of the independence of Cuba,
neutral intervention to end the war by im
posing a rational compromise between the
contestants, intervention in favor of one
or the other party, and forcible annexation
of the island, I concluded it was honestly
due to our friendly relations with Spain
that she should be given a reasonable
chance to realize her expectations of re
form to which she had become irrevocably
committed. Within a few weeks previous
ly she had announced comprehensive plans,
which it was confidently asserted would
be efficacious to remedy the evils so deep
ly affecting our own country, so injurious
to the true interests of the mother country
as well as to those of Cuba, and so repug
nant to the universal sentiment of hu
manity.
The ensuing month brought little sign of
real progress toward the pacification of
Cuba. The autonomous administration set
up in the capital and some of the prin
cipal cities appeared not to gain the favor
of the inhabitants nor to be able to extend
their influence to the large extent of ter
ritory held by the insurgents while the
military arm, obviously unable to cope
with the still active rebellion, continued
many of the most objectionable and offen
sive policies of the government that had
preceded it. No tangible relief was af
forded the vast numbers of unhappy re
concentrados despite the reiterated pro
fessions made in that regard and the
amount appropriated by Spain to that
end. The proffered expedient of zones of
cultivation proved illusory indeed, no less
practical nor more delusive promises of
succor could well have been tendered to the
exhausted and destitute people, stripped of
all that made life and home dear and
herded in a strange region among unsym
pathetic strangers hardly less necessitous
than themselves.
Destruction of the Maine.
At this juncture, on the 15th of Febru
ary last, occurred the destruction of the
battleship Maine, while rightfully lying in
the harbor of Havana on a mission of in
ternational courtesy and good willa
catastrophe the suspicious nature and hor
ror of which stirred the nation's heart pro
foundly. It is a striking evidence of the
poise and sturdy good sense distinguishing
our national character that this shocking
blow, falling upon a generous people, al
ready deeply touched by preceding events
in Cuba, did not move them to an instant,
desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the
sxistence of a condition of danger and dis
order at our doors that made possible such
a deed by whomsoever wrought. Yet the
instinct of justice prevailed and the nation
anxiously awaited the result of the search
ing investigation at once set on foot. The
finding of the naval board of inquiry estab
lished that the origin of the explosion was
external by a submarine mine, and only
halted through lack of positive testimony
to fix the responsibility of its authorship.*
Action of Congress.
All these things carried conviction to the
most thoughtful, even before the finding
of the naval court, that a crisis in our re
lations with Spain toward Cuba was at
hand. So strong was this belief that
it
needed but' a brief executive sugges
tion to the 'congress to receive imme
diate answer to the duty of making instant
provision tor the possible and perhaps
speedily probable emergency of war, and the
remarkable, almost unique, spectacle was
presented of a unanimous vote ot botr
houses on the 9th of March, appropriating
$50,000,000 "for the national defenses, and for
Each and every purpose connected there
with, to be expended at the discretion of
the president." That this act of provision
came none too soon was disclosed when the
application of the fund was undertaken.
Our forts were practically undefended. Our
navy needed large provision for increased
ammunition and supplies, and even num
bers to cope with any sudden attack from
the navy of Spain, which comprised mod
ern vessels of the highest type of conti
nental perfection. Our army also required
enlargement of men and munitions. The
details of the hurried preparation for the
dreaded contingency is told in the reports
of the secretaries of war and of the navy,
and need not be repeated here. It is suffi
cient to say that the outbreak of the
war, when it did come, found our nation not
unprepared to meet the conflict.
Efforts Continued.
Still animated by the hope of a peaceful
solution and obeying the dictates of duty,
no e'Tort was relaxed to bring about a
speedv ending of the Cuba nstruggle. Ne
.totiations to this
obpectSpain,
continued actively
I with the government of looking to
fj" the immediate conclusion of a six months'
tf.^A armistice in Cuba with a view to effect the
I recoenition of her people's right to inde-
IB pendence. Besides this, the instant
f,sifw
I .cation of the order of reconcentrationrevo- was
fMylai asked, so that the sufferers, returning to
WmM their homes and aided by united American
S And Spanish effort might be put in a way
Mk ito support themselves* and, by orderly re
sumption of the wetl-nigh destroyed pro
ductive energies of the island, contribute
time at MMrra,.^umnr43V'offe*gtfjy the'
Spanish government which could not^but
be regarded as inadequate. It was pro
posed to confide the preparation of peace
to- the insular parliament, yet to* be con
vened under tfte^autonomous'* decrees 'of,
November, 1897, but without impairment in
any wise of the constitutional powers of
the Madrid government, which, to that
end, would grant an armistice, if solicited
by the insurgents, for such time as the
general in chief- might see fit to fix. How
and with what scope of discretionary
powers the insular parliament was ex
pected to set about the "preparation" of
peace did not appear. If it were to be by
negotiation with the insurgents, the issue
seemed.to rest on the one Side with a body
chosen by a. .fraqtion of the electo'rs ifi the
districts under Spanish control, and on
the other with the insurgent population
holding the interior country, unrepresented
in the so-called parliament, and defiant
at the suggestion of suing for peace.
CONGRESS ASKED TO ACT.
Whole Question Submitted to Legis
lators on April 11.
Grieved and disappointed at this barren
outcome of my sincere endeavors to reach
a practical solution, I felt it my duty tp re
mit the whole question to the congress.
In the message of April 11,1898,1 announced
that with this la3t overture in the direc
tion of immediate peace in Cuba, and its
disappointing reception by Spain, the ef
fort of the executive was brought to an
end. I again reviewed the alternative
course of action which I had proposed,
concluding that the only one consonant
with international policy and compatible
with our firm-set historical traditions was
intervention as a neutral to stop the war
and check the hopeless sacrifice of life,
even though that resort involved "hostile
constraint upon both the parties to the
contest, as well to' enforce a truce as to
kuide the eventual settlement."
In view of all this, the congress was
asked to authorize and empower the pres
ident to take measures to secure a full and
final termination of hostilities between Spain
and the people of Cuba, and to secure to the
island the establishment of a stable govern
ment, capable of maintaining order and
observing its international obligations, in
suring peace and tranquillity, and the se
curity of its citizens as well as- our own,
and for the accomplishment of those ends
to use the military and naval forces ot the
Urited States as might be necessary, with
added authority to continue generous re
lief to the starving people of Cuba.
Action of Congress Approved.
The response of the congress, after nine
days' of earnest deliberation, during which
the almost unanimous sentiment of your
body was developed on every point save
as to the expediency of coupling the pro
posed action* with a formal recognition of
the republic of Cuba as the true and lawful
government of that islanda proposition
which failed of adoptionthe congress,
after conference, on the 19th of April, by
a vole of 42 to 35 in the senate and 311 to 6
in the house of representatives, passed the
memorable joint resolution, declaring:
"First. That the people of the island of
Cuba are, and of right ought to be, free
and independent.
"Second. That it is the duty of the United
Stales to demand and the government of
the United States does hereby demand, the
government of Spain at once relinquish its
authority and government in the island of
Cuba and withdraw its land and naval
forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.
"Third. That the president of the United
States be, and he hereby is, directed and
empowered to use the entire land and naval
forces of the United States, and to call into
the actual service of the United States
the militia of the several states, to such
extent as may be necessary to carry these
resolutions into effect.
"Fourth. That the United States hereby
disclaims any disposition or intention to
exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control
over said island except for the pacification
thereof, and asserts its determination when
that is accomplished to leave the govern
ment and control of the island to its peo-
ple."
Diplomatic Relations Enileil.
This resolution was approved by the ex
ecutive on the next day, April 20. A copy
was at once communicated to the Spanish
minister at this capital, who forthwith an
nounced that his cdntinuance in Washing
ton had thereby become impossible, and
asked for his passports, which were given
him. He thereupon withdrew from
Washington, leaving the protection of
Spanish interests in the United States to
the French ambassador and the Austro
Hungarian minister. Simultaneously with
its communication to the Spanish minister
Gen. Woodford, the American minister at
Madrid, was telegraphed confirmation of
the text of the joint resolution and directed
to communicate it to the government of
Spain with the formal demand that it at
once relinquish its authority and govern
ment in the island of Cuba and withdraw
its forces therefrom, coupling this demand
with announcements of the intentions of
this government as to the future of the is
land, in conformity with the fourth clause
of the resolution, and giving Spain until
noon of April 23 to reply.
The demand, although, as above shown,
officially made known to the Spanish envoy
here, was not delivered at Madrid. After
the instruction reached Gen. Woodford on
the morning of April 21, but before he could
present it, the Spanish minister of state
notified him that upon the president's ap
proval of the joint resolution the Madrid
government, regarding the act as "equiva
lent to an evident declaration of war," had
ordered its minister in Washington to with
draw, thereby breaking off diplomatic re
lations between the two countries and ceas
ing all official communication between
their respective representatives. Gen.
Woodford therupon demanded his pass
ports and quitted Madrid the same day.
/WAR IS DECLARED.
Spain and Other Countries Notified of
Beginning of Hostilities.
Snain having thus denied the demand of
the United States and initiated that com
plete form of rupture of relations which
attends a state of War, the executive pow
ers authorized by the resolution were at
once used by me to meet the enlarged con
tingency of. aetital war between Spain and
the United States. On April 22 I pro
claimed a blockade of the northern coast of
Cuba, including ports on said coast be
tween Cardenas and Bahia Honda and the
port of Cienfuegos on the south coast of
Cuba and on the 23d I called for volun
teers to execute the mirpose of the resolu
tion. By my message of April 25, the con
gress was informed of the situation and I
recommended formal declaration of 'the
existence of a state of war between the
United States and Spain. The congress
accordingly voted on the same day the
act approved April 25, 1898, declaring the
existence of such war, from and including
the 21st day of April,,and reenacted the
provision of the resolution of April 20, di
recting the president to use all the armed
forces of the nation to carry that act into
effect. Due notification of the existence of
war as afore'said was given April 25 by
telegraph to all the governments with
which the United States maintain relations,
in order that their neutrality might be as
sured during the war. The various gov
ernments responded with proclamations of
neutrality, each after its own methods.
It is not among the least gratifying inci
dents of the struggle that the obligations
of neutrality were impartially discharged
by all, often under delicate and difficult
circumstances.
Response to Call for Volunteers.
Our country thus, after an interval of
half a century of peace with all nations,
found itself engaged in deadly conflict with
a foreign enemy. Every nerve was strained
to meet the emergency. The response to
the initial call for 125,000 volunteers was
instant and complete, as was also the result
of the second call of May 25 for 75,000 ad
ditional volunteers. The ranks of the reg-
TT*
iil^r array^wef6.tincrefl,ed, to t$e limits.
groYiSM by theact of April 26. The enlisted
worpe of the navy Qn the 15th of. Ausust,
.when it Cached its maximum, numbered
,24,123 men and apprentices. One hundred
and three vessels were added to the navy
by purchase, one was presented to the
government, one leased, and the four ves
sels of the International Navigation com-
pany,' the St. Paul, St. Louis, New York and
Paris, were chartered, in addition to these
the revenue cutters- and lighthouse tenders
were turned over to the navy department
and became tena/porarily a part of-the Aux
iliary navy.
Strength of the Navy.
The maximum effective fighting force of
the navy during the war, separated into
classes, was as follows: Four battleships
of the first class, one battleship of the sec
ond 'c.iass, two armored cruisers, six coast
defens^ monitors, one armored ram, 12
protected cruisers, three unprotected
cruisers, 18 gunboats, pne dynamite
cruiser, 11 torpedo boats, 14 old vessels of
the old navy, including monitors. Auxil
iary navy: Auxiliary cruisers, 28 converted
yachts 2 converted tugs,.19 converted col
liers, 15 revenue cutters, four lighthouse
tenders and 19 miscellaneous vessels.
Defense of the Coast.
Much alarm was felt along our entire
Atlantic seaboard lest some* attack might
be made by the enemy. Every precaution
was taken to prevent possible injury to
our great cities lying along the coast.
Temporary garrisons were provided, drawn
from the state militia infantry and light
batteries were drawn from the volunteer
force. About 12,000 troops were thus em
ployed. The coast signal service was es
tablished for observing the approach of an
enemy's ships to the coast of the United
States and the life-saving and lighthouse
services cooperated, which enabled the
navy department to have all portions of the
Atlantic coast, from Maine to Texas, under
observation. The auxiliary navy was cre
ated under the authority of congress, and
was officered and manned by the naval
militia of the several states. This organ
ization patrolled the coast, and performed
the duty of a second arm of defense.
War Revenues.
The national defense under the $50,000,000
fund was expended in large part by the
army and navy and the objects for which
it was used are fully shown in the reports
of the several secretaries. It was a most
timely appropriation, enabling the govern
ment to strengthen its defense and making
preparations greatly needed in case of war.
This fund being inadequate to the require
ments of equipment and for the conduct of
the* war, the patriotism of the congress pro
vided the means in the war revenue act of
June 13, by authorizing a. three per cent,
popular loan not to exceed $400,000,000 and
by levying additional imposts and taxes.
Of the authorized loan, $200,000,000 were of
fered and promptly taken, the subscrip
tions so far exceeding the call as to cfover
it many times over, while, preference be
ing given to the smaller bids, no single allot
ment exceeded $5,000. This was a most en
couraging and significant result, showing
the vast resources of the nation and the
determination of the people to uphold their
country's honor.
BRIEF HISTORY OP THE WAR.
Leading Engagements and Thrilling
Achievements Recounted.
It is not within the province of this mes
sage to narrate the history of the ex
traordinary war that followed the Spanish
declaration of April 21, but a brief recual
of its more salient features is appropriate.
The first encounter of the war in point of
date took place April 27, when a detach
ment of the blockading squadron made a
reconnoissance in force at Matanzas,
shelled tne harbor forts and demolished
several new works in construction.
Dewey's Victory.
The next engagement was destined to
mark a memorable epoch in maritime war
fare. The Pacific fleet, under Commodore
George Dewey, had lain for some weeks at
Hong-Kong. Upon the colonial proclama
tion of neutrality being issued and the
customary 24 hours' notice being given
our
repaired to Mirs bay, near Hong-Kong,
whence it proceeded to the Philippine is
lands under telegraphic orders to capture
or destroy the foimidable Spanish fleet then
assembled at Manila. At daybreak on tne
1st of May the American torce entered Ma
nila bay and after a few hours* engage
ment effected the total destruction of the
Spanish fleet, consisting of ten warships
and a transport, besides capturing the
naval station and forts at Cavite, thus an
nihilating the Spanish power in the Pacific
ocean and completely controlling the Bay
of Manila, with the ability to take the city
at will. Not a life was lost on our ships,
the wounded only numbering seven, while
not a vessel was materially injured. For
this gallant achievement the congress, up
on my recommendation, fitly bestowed up
on theactors present permanent and sub
stantial reward.
The effect of this remarkable victory
upon the spirit of our people and upon the
fortunes of the war was instant. A pres
tige of invincibility thereby attached to
our arms, which continued throughout the
struggle. Reenforcements were hurried to
Manila under the command of Maj. Gen.
Merritt, and firmly established within sight
of the capital, which lay helpless before
our guns. On the seventh day of May the
government was advised officially of the
victory of Manila, and at once inquired of
the commander of our fleet what troops
would be required. The information was
received on the 15th of May, and the first
army expedition sailed May 25, and ar
rived off Manila June 30. Other expeditions
soon followed, the total force consisting
of 641 officers and 15,058 men.
Following the comprehensive scheme of
general attack powerful forces were as
sembled at various points on our coast to
invade Cuba and Porto Rico. Meanwhile
naval demonstrations were made at several
exposed points. On May 11, the cruiser
Wilmington and torpedo boat Winslow
were unsuccessful in an attempt to silence
the batteries at Cardenas, against Matan
zas, Worth Bagley and four seamen fall
ing. These grievous fatalities were strange
ly enough among the very few which oc
curred during our naval operations in this
extraordinary conflict.
Advance of Ccrvera's Fleet.
Meanwhile the Spanish naval prepara
tions had been pushed with great vigor. A
powerful squadron under Admiral Cervera,
which had,assembled at the Cape Verde
islands before the outbreak of hostilities,
had crossed the ocean and by its erratic
movements in the Caribbean sea delayed
our military operations while baffling the
pursuit of our fleets. For a time fears were
felt lest the Oregon and Marietta, then
nearing home after their long voyage from
San Francisco of over 15,000 miles, might
be surprised by Admiral Cervera's fleet
but their fortunate arrival dispelled these
apprehensions and lent much needed reen
forcements. Not until Admiral Cervera
took refuge in the harbor of Santiago de
Cuba about May 9 was it practicable to
plan a systematic military attack upon the
Antillean possessions of Spain.
Several demonstrations occurred on the
coasts of Cuba and Porto Rico in prepara
tion for the larger event. On May 13 the
North Atlantic squadron shelled San Juan
do Porto Rico. On May 30 Commodore
Schley's squadron bombarded the forts
guarding the mouth of Santiago harbor.
Neither attack had any material result. It
was evident that well-ordered land opera
tions were indispensable to achieve a de
cisive advantage.
1 Hohson's Rand of Heroes.
The next act in the war thrilled not alone
the hearts of our countrymen but the world
by 'ts exceptional heroism. On the night
of June 3 Lieut. Hobson, aided by seven
devoted volunteers, blocked the narrow
outlet from Santiago harbor by sinking the
collier Merrimac in the channel, under a
fierce fire from the shore batteries, escap
ing with their lives as by a miracle, but
falling into the hands of the Spaniards. It
is a most gratifying incident of the war
that the bravery of this little band of
heroes was cordially appreciated by the
Spaniards, who sent a flag of truce to notify
Admiral Sampson of their safety and to
compliment them On their daring act. They
were subsequently exchanged July 7.
s. Fall of Guantanamo.
By 'June 7 the cutting, of the last Cuban
cable isolated the island. Thereafter the
invasion was vigorously prosecuted. Oa
June 10, under a heavy protecting fire, a
landing of 600 marines from the Oregon,
Marblehead and Yankee was effected in
Guantanamo bay, where it.had been deter
mined to establish a naval station. This
important and .essential port was taken
from the enemy after severe fighting by
'the marines, who, were ,the first organized,
force of the United States to land in Cuba
The position so won was held, despite des
perate attempts to dislodge our forces. By
June 16 additional forces were landed and
strongly intrenched. On June 22 the ad
vance of the invading army under Maj.
Gen. Shafter landed at Baiquiri, about 15
miles east of Santiago. This was accom
plished under great difficulties, but with
marvelous dispatch.
THE SANTIAGO CAMPAIGN.
Its Successful Issue Gave Us the En
tire Eastern End of Cuba.
On June 23 the movement against San
tiago was begun. On the 24th the first se
rious engagement took place, in which the
First and Tenth cavalry and the First
United States volunteer cavalry. Gen.
Young's brigade of Gen. Wheeler's division,
participated, losing heavily. By nightfall,
however, ground within five miles of San
tiago was won. The advantage was stead
ily increased. On July 1, a severe battle
took place, our forces gaining the out
works of Santiago on the second El Caney
and San Juan were taken after a desperate
charge, and the investment of the city was
completed. The navy cooperated by shell
ing the town and the coast forts.
Sinking of the Spanish Fleet.
On the day following this brilliant
achievement of our land forces, July 3,
occurred the decisive naval combat of the
war. The Spanish fleet, attempting to
leave the harbor, was met by the American
squadron under command of Commodore
Sampson. In less than three hours all the
Spanish ships were destroyed, the two
torpedo boats being sunk, and the Maria
Teresa, Almirante Oquendo, Vizcaya and
Cristobal Colon driven ashore. The Span
ish admiral and over 1,300 men were taken
pri&oners, while the enemy's loss was de
plorably large, some 600 perishing. On
our side but one man was killed, on the
Brooklyn, and one man was seriously
wounded. Although our ships were re
peatedly struck, not one Was seriously in
jured. Where all so conspicuously dis
tinguished themselves, from the command
ers to the gunners and the unnamed heroes
in the boiler rooms, each and all contribut
ing toward the achievement of this as
tounding victory, for which neither an
cient nor modern history affords a parallel
in the completeness of the event and the
marvelous disproportion of casualties, it
would be invidious to single out any for
especial honor. Deserved promotion has
rewarded the more conspicuous actorsthe
nation's profoundest gratitude is due to all
of those brave men who by their skill and
devotion in a few short hours crushed the
sea power of Spain and wrought a triumph
whose decisiveness and far-reaching con
sequences can scarcely be measured. Nor
can we be unmindful of the achievements
of our builders, mechanics, and artisans
for their skill in the construction of our
warships.
Capture of Santiago.
The capitulation of Santiago followed.
The city was closely besieged by land, while
the entrance of our ships into the harbor
cut off all relief on that side. After a truce
to allow of the removal of nonconibatants
protracted negotiations continued from
July 3 until July 15, when, under menace
of immediate assault the preliminaries of
surrender were agreed upon. On the 17th
Gen. Shafter occupied the city. The capitu
lation embraced the entire eastern end of
Cuba. The number of Spanish soldiers sur
rendered was 22,000, all of whom were sub
sequently conveyed to Spain at the charge
of the United States.
Gratitude of the Nation.
The story of this successful campaign is
told in the report of the secretary of war
which will be laid before you. The indi
vidual valor of officers and soldiers was
never more strikingly shown than the
several engagements leading to the sur
render of Santiago, while the prompt move
ments and successive victories won instant
and universal applause. To those who
gained this complete triumph, which estab
lished the ascendency of the United States
upon land as the fight off Santiago had fixed
our supremacy on the seas, the earnest and
lasting gratitude of the nation is unspar
ingly due. Nor should we alone remember
the gallantry of the living the dead claim
our tears, and our losses by battle*and dis
ease must cloud any exultation at the re
sult and teach us to weigh the awful cost
of war, however rightful the cause or sig
nal the victory.
MILES AT PORTO RICO.
A Brief History of the Expedition
to That Island.
With the fall of Santiago, the occupation
of Porto Rico became the next strategic
necessity. Gen. Miles had previously beer
assigned to organize an expedition for that
purpose. Fortunately he was already at
Santiago, where he had arrived on the 11th
of July, with reenforcements for Gen.
Shafter's army. With these troops, consist
ing of 3,415 infantry and artillery, two com
panies of engineers and one company of
the signal corps, Gen. Miles left Guantana
mo on July 21, having nine transports cor
voyed by the fleet under Capt. Higginson,
with the Massachusetts (flagship), Dixie,
Gloucester, Columbia and Yale, the two
latter carrying troops. The expedition
landed at Guanica July 25, which port was
entered with little opposition. Here the
fleet was joined by the Annapolis and the
Wasp, while the Puritan and Amphitrite
went to San Juan and joined the New Or
leans, wi .ch was engaged in blockading
that port. The major general commanding
was subsequently reenforced by Gen.
Schwann's brigade of the Third army
coips, by Gen. Wilson, with a part of his
division, and also by Gen. Brooke, with a
part of his corps, numbering in all 16,973 of
ficers and men. On July 27 he entered
Ponce, one of the most important ports in
the island, from which he thereafter di
rected operations for the capture of the
island
With the exception of encounters with
the enemy at Guayama, Hermiguerez,
Coamo and Yauco, and an attack on a force
landed at Cape San Juan, there was no se
rious resistance. The campaign was prose
cuted with great vigor, and by the 12th of
August much of the island was in our pos
session and the acquisition of the remainder
was only a matter of a short time. At
most of the points in the island our troops
were enthusiastically welcomed. Protesta
tions of loyalty to the flag and gratitude for
delivery from Spanish rule met our com
manders at every stage. As a potent in
fluence toward peace, the outcome of the
Porto Rican expedition was of great con
sequence, and generous commendation is
due to those who participated in it.
Fall of Manila.
The last scene of the war was enacted at
Manila, its starting place. On August 15,
after a brief assault upon the works by the
land forces, in which the squadron assisted,
the capital surrendered unconditionally.
The casualties were comparatively few.
By this conquest of the Philhppine islands,
virtually accomplished when the Spanish
capacity for resistance was destroyed by
Admiral Dewey's victory of the 1st of
May, was formally sealed. To Gen. Mer
ritt, his officers and men for their uncom
plaining and devoted services for their gal
lantry in action, the nation is sincerely
grateful. Their long voyage was made
with singular success, and the soldierly
conduct of the men, most of whom were
without previous experience in the military
service, deserves unmeasured praise.
Our Losses. \j
The total casualties in killed and wounded
in the army during the war was as follows:
Officers killed, 23 enlisted men killed, 257
total. 2S0 officers wounded, 113 enlisted
men wounded, 1,464 total, 1,577. Of the
navy: Killed, 17 wounded, 67 died as result
of wounds, 1 invalided from service, 6
total, 91. It will be observed that while our
navy was engaged in,two great battles and
in numerous perilous undertaRlngs in the
blockades and bombardment and more
than 50,000 of our troops were transported
to distant lands and engaged in assault
and siege and battle and many skirmishes
in unfamiliar territory, we lost in both
arms of the service a total of 1,668 killed and
wounded and in the entire campaign by
land and sea we did not lose a gun or a
flag or a transport or a ship, and with the
exception of the crew of the Merrimac, not
a soldier or sailor was taken prisoner.
Troops Return.
On August 7,. 46 days from the date of the
landing of Gen. Shatter's army in Cuba,
ard 21 days from the surrender of Santiago,
the United States troops commenced em
barkation for home and our entire force
was returned to the United States as early
as August 24. They were absent from the
United States only two months.
Tribute to Patriotism.
It is fitting that I should bear testimony
to the patriotism and devotion of that
large portion of our army which, although
eager to be ordered to the post of greatest
exposure, fortunately was not required out
side of the United States. They did their
whole duty, and like their comrades at the
front, have earned the gratitude of the
nation. In like manner, the officers and
men of the army and of the navy who re
mained in their departments and stations
of the navy, performing most important
duties connected with the war, and whose
requests for asignment in the field and at
sea it was compelled to refuse because
their services were indispensable here, are
entitled to the highest commendation. It
is my regret that there seems to be no pro
vision for their suitable recognition.
Work of the Red Cross.
In this connection, it is a pleasure for
me to mention in terms of cordial appre
ciation the timely and useful work of the
American National Red Cross, both in re
lief measures preparatory to the campaign,
in sanitary assistance at several of the
camps of assemblage and later, under the
able and experienced leadership of the
president of the society, Miss Clara Bar
ton, on the fields of battle and in the hos
pitals at the front in Cuba
PEACE OVERTURES.
Spain Takes Steps to Bring About
Close of the War.
The annihilation of Admiral Ccrvera's
fleet, followed by the capitulation of San
tiago, having brought to the Spanish gov
ernment a realizing sense of the hopeless
ness of continuing a struggle now becoming
wholly unequal, it made overtures of peace
through the French ambassador, who with
the assent of his government, had acted as
the friendly representative of Spansh in
terests during the war. On the 26th of July,
M. Cambon presented a communication
signed by the duke of Almodovai, the Span
ish minister of state, inviting the United
States to state the terms upon which it
would be willing to make peace. On July
30, by a communication addressed to the
dtike of Almodovar and handed to M. Cam
bon, the terms of tins government were an
nounced, substantially as in the protocol,
afterwards signed On August 10, the Span
ish reply, dated Aueust 7, was handed by
Cambon to the secretary of state. It ac
cepted unconditionally the terms imposed
as to Cuba, Porto Rico and an island of the
Uadrones group, but appeared to seek to
introduce inadmissible reservations in re
gard to our demand as to the Philippines.
Conceiving that discussion on this poir.t
could neither be practicable
ordprofitable,
directed that in order to aAr
*3
I
oi misunder
standing the matter should be forthwith
closed by proposing the embodiment in a
formal protocol of the terms in which the
negotiations for peace were to be under
taken. The vaJTiie and inexplicit sugges
tions of the Spanish note could not be ac
cepted, the orlv reply being to present as a
virtual ultimatum a draft of protocol em
bodying the precise teims tendered to
Spain in our note of July 30, with added
stipulation? of detail as to the apooirt
ment of commissioners to arrant for the
evacuation of the Spanish Ant lies On
August 12 M. Cambon announced his re
ceipt of full powers to si?n the orotocol
So submitted Accordingly, on the after
noon of August 12, Cambon, as the
plenipotentiary of Spain, and the secre
tary of state, as the plenipotentiary of the
United States, signed a protocol, provid
ing:
The Protocol.
"Article 1. Spain will relinquish all claim
of sovere.gntv over and title to Cuba.
"Article 2 Spam will cede the United
States the island of Porto co ard other
islands now under Spanish sovereignty in
the West Indies, and also an islard in the

States.
"Article 3. The United States will oc
cupy and hold the city, bay and harboi of
Manila pending the conclusion of a treaty
of peace which shall determine the con
trol, disposition and government of the
Philippines
The fourth article provided for the ap
pointment of joint commissiors on the part
of the United States and Spain to meet in
Havana and San Juan, respect'vely, lor
the purpose of arranging and carrying out
the details of the stipulated evacuation of
Cuba, Porto Rico and other Spanish is
lands in the West Indies.
The fifth article provided for the ap
pointment of not more than five commis
sioners on each side, to meet at Pari=: not
later than October 1, and to proceed to
the negotiations and conclusiors of a
treaty of peace, subject to ratification ac
cording to the respective constitutional
forms of the two countries..
The sixth and last article provided that
upon the signature of the protocol hos
tilities between the two courtries should be
suspended, and that notice to that effect
should be given as soon as possible by
each government to the commanders of its
military and naval forces.
Hostilities Suspended.
Immediately upon the conclusion of the
protocol I issued a proclamation of August
12, suspending hostilities on the part of the
United States. The nee^-sary orders to
that end were at once given by telegraph.
The blockade of the ports of Cuba and San
Juan de Porto Rico was in like manner
raised. On August 18 the muster out of
100,000 volunteers, or as near that number
as was found to be practicable, was or
dered. On December 1 101,165 officers ani
men had been mustered out and discharged
from the service, 9,002 more will be mus
tered out by the 10th of the month. Also
a corresponding number of generals and
general staff officers have been honorably
discharged from the service.
OUR NEAV POSSESSIONS.
Discussion of Their Future Govern
ment Is Deferred.
I do not discuss at this time the govern
ment or the future of the new possessions
which will come to us as the result of the
war witn Spain. Such discussion will be ap
propriate after the treaty of peace shall be
ratified. In the meantime and until the
congress has legislated otherwise, it will
be my duty to continue the military gov
ernments which have existed since our oc
cupation and guarantee the people se
curity in life and property and encourage
mtnt under a just and beneficent rule As
soon as we are in possession of Cuba and
have pacified the island, it will be necessary
to give aid and direction to its people to form
a government for themselves. This should
be undertaken at the earliest moment con
sistent with safety and assured success. It
is important tnat our relations with these
people shall be of the most friendly char
acter and our commercial relations close
and reciprocal. It should be our duty to
assist in every proper way to build up the
waste places of the island, encourage the
industry of the people and assist them to
form a government which shall be free and
independent, thus realizing the best as
pirations of the Cuban people. Spanish
rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent
and humane government, created by *t'he
people of Cuba, capable of performing ail
