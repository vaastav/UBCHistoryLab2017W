NATIONAL INTELLIGENCER.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
We are sure that do feature of the President's
Message caa Lave brought more satisfaction to
readers in the lx>jal States than the very gratifying
account it gives of our relations with foreign Pow
ers. We are reminded by an intelligent contem
porary that it would be hard to find one of the
eeveuty-odd annual messages which have been
transmitted to Congress that did not make men
' tion of seme difficulty of some kind with some for*
eigu Power; and in a majority of them such diffi
culties formed one of the most important themes
But wo look in vain through the present dooument
for the slightest token of any difference with any
foreign State. The distinction is remarkable enough
n itself. But, as our contemporary adds, " it is
' much more so when the fact is noted that here
' tofore nothing has been so prolifio of internation
' al trouble as the relations of neutrals to bellige
' rents. The very time when it would be natural
' ly anticipated that we should have the most se
' ricus controversies with other nations, and espe
' daily commercial nations, ii the very time when
' our National Executive has nothing to oomplain
1 of, and most decidedly testifies to universal fair
1 dealing. This certainly bespeaks very wise man
1 agement of our State Department/'
Nor are we compelled to look alone to our own
official expositions for this satisfactory state
ment of our relations with foreigtf Governments.
When the President says that the efforts of dis
loyal citizens of the United States to involve us in
foreign wars " have been unavailing," we can find
ample confirmation of the fact in the disappoint
ments confessed under this head by Gen. Jefferson
Davis in his recent message to the Confederate
Cor.gres*, the substantial portions of which may
be louLd in another part of to-day's Intelligencer.
It will be seen that he reports with "regret"?we
quote his own text?that "there has been no im
' provcuuent in the state of our relations with for
' eiga countries since my message in January last.
' On the contrary, there has been a still greater
' divergence in the conduct of European nations
' from that practical impartiality which alone de
' Bervcs the name of neutrality, and their action,
1 in some cases, has assumed a character positively
( unfriendly." Gen. Davis then prooeeds to make
a " lull statement" of what he calls the "just
grounds which exist for dissatisfaction with the
oonduct of the British Government," and laments
that the Southern Confederacy is unfortunately
without adequate remedy for this "injustice" at a
juncture when its entire energies are absorbed in
the struggle against an enemy possesse i of greatly
superior numbers and material resources. The ne
cessary implication is, that if the powers of the
Confederacy were adequate to the undertaking, and
were not at present overtaxed by the war already on
its hands, there would be ample cause to seek arm
ed redress for injuries received and indignities too
long endured from the British Government.
When we consider how much more intimate,
varied, and delicate have been the relations of our
Government with Great Britain than those of the
insurgent States, we can still more justly appre
ciate the wisdom and skill which, under the man
agement of the distinguished Premier of the Ad
ministration, have conducted our foreign affairs to
their present prosperous attitude. As the Presi
dent remarks, questions of great intricacy and im
portance have arisen out of the blockade and other
belligerent operations between our Government and
several of the maritime Powers, but, he is able to
add, " they have been discussed, and, as far as was
possible, accommodated in a spirit of frankness,
justice, and mutual good will." And thus it is
that he was able to report, at the very threshold of
his annual exposition, giving to the announcement
a place according to its dignity and significance,
the no less rare than gratifying fact that " we re
main in peaoe and friendship with foreign
Powers."
THE LEGAL ARBITRAMENT.
We yesterday stated, in our comments on the
Message, that by remitting the finality of the
emancipation (diet to the decision of Congress or of
the Supreme Court, the President oould not have
done any thing more, even by a revocation of the
proclamation j for, whether the proclamation be
revok d or maintained by him, the question of its
le^al cffect would equally come up for final adjudi
cation by the Federal Judiciary?the ouly differ
ence bfiDg that, in the one case, the question
would be wheth'r, in spite of its revocation, the
rlavet of the insurgent States were not aotually
emancipated by it, and, in the other case, whether
it is com potent for the President, in the exercise
of his "war powers," as emmander in-chief of the
army and navy, to abrogate the laws of a State re
cognising flavery.
As, in the haste of composition, we tr ay not
have made our thought under this head as clear to
ail our readers as it was to our own minds, we may
add, t?y way of explanation, that in case the edict
of emancipation had been revoked by the Presi
dent, the q icition would still have arisen whether
tha slaves who were "ordered and declared" to be
free by it (but who were left in bondage on the
return of peace) might cot still olaim its benefits,
if the constitutionality of the edict should be sus
tained by the Federal Judiciary. And it is no
thing more nor less ?.han this same question whioh
tire President oontomplates as likely to arise under
the eontinned pr< valence of his proclamation as
an Kxeoutive measure?the only difference b.ing
that, on the former (-u. position, it is a question
wh* ther men left in bondage are not entitled to
their freedom, and, on the latter, whether men
who have been declared free, and who may have
aotually obtained their freedom, should be re
manded to t-Iavery in consequence of a judicial de
cision pronouncing the proclamation unoonstitu
ti< nal. It is this latter phase of the question
whic/i iho President proposes to submit to the
arbitrament of the Supreme Court.
We understand that the President has signed a
pard ?r exempting E W Gantt, of Arkansas, from
the penalty of treason, which he incurred by accept
ing Bnd exercifing the offioe of Brigadier General
in the service of the insurgents. The pardon also
reinstates Gen. Gantt in all his rights of property
except those relating to slaves.
THE PKESIDENT'B PLAN.
The reader will find in another part of to-day's
paper a communication, to wliioh wo give place,
because it proceeds from a statesman whoso long
and varied experience in public affairs, as well as
his approved loyalty, imparts a reoognised value to
all his political suggestions, and because the objec
tions which it brings against the " plan of recon
struction" proposed by the President are taken on
grounds so different from those to which we ad
verted yesterday, that, in proportion to their tena
bility, they must serve to set in a clear light the
wholly indefensible character of the latter.
We submit our correspondent's views to the
notice of our readers without oomment, further
than to say that we do not understand the Presi
dent to prescribe the oath in question as an indis
pensable condition precedent to tbe exercise of the
right of suffrage in any " revived State," but that
he merely suggests it, of his own motion, as a
" rallying point" which may bo accepted by the
people of such a State under tbe assurance that, if
accepted, it will not be rejected by the General
Government so far as that Government is embodied
in the Executive. The President is particular
to say that " no man is ooerced to take it,"
(the oath,) and he adds that in "saying that
reconstruction will be acoepted if presented
in a specified way, it is not said it will never
be aooepted in any other way." In a word,
the whole plan under this head is proposed to the
consideration and free disoussion of the people
ooncerned, without any injunctions binding them
to its involuntary acknowledgment, and without
any restrictions closing the door to their indepen
dent aotion on the subjeot in such other direotion
as they may judge to be more ^expedient, and on
suoh other principles as they may judge to be
more consistent with their rights and dignity as
loyal oitixens of the United States, entitled, as
suoh, to regulate their domestio concerns acooiding
to their own will and pleasure, it being understood
that, as " loyal citizens" of the United States, they
oan have no will or pleasure incompatible with the
Constitution [and laws. The President docs not
submit his plan as any thing more than a " sug
gestion," which he says " is made in the hope
that it may do good, without danger of harm." If
it should be rejected by th? people of the States
interested, it will fall to the ground. If acoepted
by them, it must necessarily be very transient in
its duration?serving merely to bridge over the
chasm which is now fixed like a great gulf be
tween the order of the past and the anarchy of the
present. The authors of secession have proved
themselves " able architects of ruin," and to bring
political symmetry and beauty out of the chaos
they have superindaoed promises to tax the skill oi
our wisesi statesmen, and, we may add, to try tbe
patienoe of our most hopeful and sanguine pa
triots.
For reasons whioh will readily oocur to our
readers, we have preferred, as far as possible, to
leave the disoussion of the President's plan in the
hands of the people to whom it is addressed, and
in whose interest it purports to be conceived and
promulgated. If they shall be inclined to adopt
it as a provisional "rallying point" for the estab
lishment of a more regular system of State Govern
ment which shall place them on an equality ef
rights, and bind them to an equality of duties with
their sister States, we are not disposed <o raise
technical objections against it, lest we might seem
willing to defeat its benefioent purpose. If the
people concerned shall reject it, we wish it to be
seen that the plan failed for other reasons than be
cause of the opposition brought to bear upon it by
discussions arising outside of the sphere to whioh
it applies. We have very definite and deoioed
views as to the nature and effeot of this last pro
clamation of the President, but we are not in
haste to forestall the progress of the events whioh
shall justify or confute them. If the President
had assumed to promulgc it as anything more than
a tentative expedient, we might not have thought
it proper to praotise this prudent reserve. But,
as it is, we prefer to judge of the plan by its fruits.
FKOM MISSISSIPPI.
Loyal citizens from the State of Mississippi have
arrived here who confirm the previous accounts as
to the suffering condition of the freedmen of that
region. Large numbers of slave men, women, and
children, who have been driven from the shelter
of plantation cabins and exposed to the.elements,
have actually perished, and the rest are subjected
to fatal diseases. 'J he race is likely to waste away
under the various influences of the war, which
brings nothing bat oalamity, from either party, to
them. The slaves were at the commencement of
the war very hopeful of its effect on their condition.
They believed that liberty meant an abundance of
food and clothing without labor. But, disappoint
ed in that, they have beoome indifferent to change,
or desirous of returning to their former condition
A system might be devised and adopted, how
ever, whereby this class of persons may be em
ployed on the plantations on terms that will ensure
a gradual improvement in their condition. But
little cotton remains on the banks of the Mis
sissippi; only a million of bales can be obtained by
purchase when we shall take possession of Mobile.
The ootton on the Alabama, Tombigbee, and other
nvers awaits a market, and not the torch of the
lebels. The holders much rather sell than burn it.
POLITICAL TOLERANCE.
We find in the New York Times the following
just observations in condemnation of the fierce and
acrid intolerance which no greatly mars the deoo
rum of our current political discussions, and whioh
so needlessly disturbs the unity of loyal men at
the present orisis:
" The truth ii th%t there is too little tolerance among
some claaa*** of Uni?>n men of the boneat convictions of
those who differ from them. For the veritable copper
head of the Vallandigham (tripe we have not one word to
?ay. We have done our part, we think, in impaling aucb
creature*. They are, to all intent* and purpoies, i?llie< of
the rebellion?for they h*ve given it constant aid and
comfort?and they may justly be styled disloyal. But the
word ' copperhead,' and the imputation of dialoyalty are
bandied quite too freely. It is a way some people have of
showing their spite toward the men who don't exactly
agree with them upon wime of the qu-ations touching
slavery, or upon some of the features of President Lin
eoln's policy. It is a bad spirit, and it should be dis
countenanced by every man who has breadth of mind
enough to understand (hat the essential distinction between
loyalty and disloyalty relat. a t<> ?iden, and not to difference
in position r>n any one side. Tru? Union men are obliged
to agree only in one thing?t he support of the war f.>r the
preservation of the Union. But, until the constitution of
the human mind is changed, it will be impossible for all
true Union men to agree in re?p?*ct fo th? precise itv de in
which that war shall be conducted Men, however de
voted to a common cause, always differ about ineti:oda
and details; and tbey hive a right ao to differ, ao 1 >ng aa
they will keep clear of factious conduct Fair discussion
Is always not only admissible, but profitable."
GEN. HALLECK'B REPORT.
We observe that several of oar Administration
oontemporaries arc animadvorting with muoh seve
rity on the annual report of Major Qen. Halleck, the
General-in-Chief. Among those participating in
thtse strictures the New York Tribune is oonspi
euous. After stating that the report is an elabo
rate document whioh " professes " to be a review
of the military operations in the different depart
ments, from November of the .last to November of
the present year, our contemporary prooeeds to add:
" It does not contain many fact* that are new to the
country, but it contains some versions of well known
events which are, to say the least, surprising. It is a
very belligerent document. We reokon not less than eight
Generals who are directly or indirectly censured for mis
conduct?all of them commanders of departments or eorps.
There is not a single disaster or failure for which the
General-in-Chief seems to consider himself responsible;
not one for whioh be is not able to account by the dere
liction in duty of some subordinate oommander. On the
other baud, it is made to appear that the operations which
were successful were conducted strictly in accordance
with the orders or suggestions issued from Washington.
" There are deficiencies in this report for whieh we are
at a loss to account. For instance, in the brief narrative
of that remarkable movement by which Lee withdrew his
army from in front of Gen. Hooker on the Rappahannock,
we find no explanation of the reasons whieh iodaoed the
latter to permit a flmk march by the rebel oommander of
more than one hundred and fifty miles without any attempt
at its interruption. The result of this inactivity on the
part of Gen. Hooker, as is well known, was to permit
Gen. Lee to occupy the Shenandoah Valley and advance
into Pennsylvania unmolested. Still more singular is the
omission of Gen. Halleck to justify the strategy by which
Gen Dix, with an army estimated at not less than thirty
thousand men, was kept on the Peninsula while Gen
Meade was fighting a decisive battle in Pennsylvania. It
is known that if Gen. Meade had been reinforced by Qen.
Dix, immediately after Gettysburg, the annihilation of the
rebel army would have been certain. Gen. Halleek would
have done the oause a service if he had told us who was
responsible for the detention of Gen. Dix; who it was that
kept those forces uselessly promenading on the Peninsula
at so critical a moment, and whether the General in Chief,
who must have had the power, failed to see the necessity
to reinforce the army of Gen. Meade; for, if Lee had
beqn destroyed north of the Potomac, Richmond would
have fallen of its own weight. If, on the other hand, for
want of reinforcements Gen. Meade had been defeated,
we could not have held Richmond had we taken it. But
on these p< ?ints we fail to find the information we sought
in Gen. Hallock's report."
We fear the critical editor has not very carefully
read the dooument on whioh he animadverts. On
a hasty perusal we noted the same omissions in
Gen. Hallcck's report as regards the operations
which oulminated in the invasion of Pennsylvania
and the battles at Gettysburg, but we supposed
ourselves to find a sufficient explanation of the
paucity of Gen. Halleck's information under this
head in the following statement, with which he
prefaces his remarks upon these events :
" A severe battle took place on the 2d and 3d of lfay,
and on the 5th our army was again withdrawn to the north
side of the river. For the want of official data I am un
able to give any detailed accounts of these operations or
of our losses. It is also proper to remark in this place
that from the time he was placed in command ot the Army
of the Potomac till he reached Fairfax Station, on the 16th
of June, a few days before he was relieved from the com
mand, Gen. Hooker rtpor ed directly to the President and
rtceived instructions directly from him. I received no offi
cial information of his plans or of their execution."
. It will thus be seen that during the early part
of the period within whioh Gen. Hooker was per
mitting Gen. Lee to outflank him the General-in
Chief was not in correspondence with the former,
and that military relations were not established
between him and Gen. Hooker until a few days
before the latter was relieved from the command
of the Army of the Potomac by Gen. Meado. It
is obvious that the General in-Chief should not be
held responsible for such omissions in his report
as result from an ignorance whioh was his misfor
tune and not his fault.
"THE PAPER BLOCKADE."
Jefferson Davis devotes a large part of his Mes
sage to the work of showing that ^ur blockade of
Southern ports is a mere "paper blockade," and
that England is guilty of a great negleot of duty
in not break ng it. But surely that must be a
most extraordinary paper blockade which has cap
lured one thousand and forty-five blockade runners,
of which 547 were schooners, 179 steamers, 131
sloops, 30 brigj, 26 barques, 15 shipi, and 117
smaller craft. Mr. Davis had better declare his
paper blockadc of Northern ports, at whioh he
hints. He would then discover tho virtue of such
a blockade.?Express.
THE PRESIDENT TO GEN. GRANT.
The President on the 8th instant sent the ?ubjoined tele
graphic despatch to Gen. Grant, complimenting him and
hia army for their late victoriea near Chattanooga. The
General immediately embodied in a "general order" thia
expreaaion of the gratitude of the Executive, and plaoed it
before the brave men whose heroic deeda it recogoiaea
and exalta:
Washington, December 8, 1863.
Major Gen. Grant : Understanding that your lodgment
at Chattanooga and Knoxville ia now secure, I wish to
tender you and all under jour command mj more than
thanks?my profoundeat gratitude?for the akill, courage,
and perseverance with which you and they, over so great
difficulties, have effected that important object. God
bless you all! A. LINCOLN."
GENERAL MEADE.
We find in the Northern papers the following extract of
a private letter from Gen. Meade to a friend, which, aaa
contemporary remarks, indicates the possession of jaat
those qualities of bead and heart whi, h ahould charac.
teriz? the man in command of one of our moat Important
armiea:
" I am fully aware of the great anxiety in the public
mind that something should be done I am in receipt of
many letters, some from persons in high positions, telling
me 1 bad better have my army destroyed and the country
filled up with the bodies of the aoldiers than remain inac
tive. Whilst I do not auffer myaelf to be influenced by
?uch communications, I am and have been m<?st anxiona
to effect something, but am determined, at every hazard,
not to attempt any thing unleas my judgment indicates a
probability ot accomplishing some obj?ot commensurate
with the destruction of life necessarily iuvolved. I w ?uld
rather a thousand times be relieved, charged with tardi
ness or incompetency, than have my conscience burdened
with a wanton slaughter, uaelessly, of br^ve men, or with
having jeoparded tbe great cause by doing what I thought
wrong."
GEN. HOOKER.
The Legislature of California having pasaed resolutions
on the 23d of March complimentary to Gen Hooker, and
forwarded them to him, he' repliea on the 20th of Septem
ber, and in bia reply makea thia statement as to bis retire
ment from tbe Army of tbe Potomac:
" I can only add that I relinquish ita command from tbe
highest considerations of tbe public good, and with un
shaken confidence of tbe Government and of the army in
my ability to guide and direct ita fortunea.*'
GEN. BUTLER AND MR OULD.
A correspondence has juat taken place between Gee.
Butler and Mr. Ould, the Confederate Commissioner for
the exchange of prisoners. It appeara that smallpox has
broken out among the Union prisoners at Belle Isle, and
that Gen. Butler has forwarded a quantity of vacoine mat
ter, sufficient to vaccinate aix thousand persons, which
has been received and acknowledged by Mr. Ould, who
says :
" Permit me, in reaponse to the friendly tone of your
letter, to assure you that it is my most anxious desiie and
will b? my constant fffort to do every thing in my power
to alleviate the miseries that spring out of this horrible

diers in captivity in rebel hands because of the refusal of
the rebel authorities to exchange negro soldiers, and
touched upon the various political and constitutional ques
tions connected with the status of the negro in this coun
try, aud denounoed the attitude and polioy of the Admin
istration on that subjeot.
Mr. JOHNSON favored the continuance of the ex
change, aud thought that humanity required efforts for the
release of the thousands of our soldiers, while hostages
might be retained for the safety and proper treatment of
the few hundreds of negroes in the bands of the insurgents.
If employed in the servioe, these negro soldiers thi uld be
protected. He took position in opposition to the Senator
from Kentucky upon tbe right of the Executive to oall
out the slave population. There was an executive power
and a legislative power He quoted from tbe Constitution
to show that Congress had power to arm any persons,
whether citizens or otherwise. While slaves were pro
perty for the purposes of taxation, they were also persons;
as property, tbey should be paid for when taken. Were
there no army or navy existing, it would still be the duty
of the President to execute the laws and provide the
means therefor. He had doubted the policy of emancipa
tion as unproductive of results beyond those obtained by
the armies in the field. Yet he did not defend slavery;
it could be defended on no plea, human or divine. He
proceeded to oontrovert the positions of the Senator of
Kentucky in opposition to the Administration.
Mr. HALE was astonished at the charge of the Senator
from Kentucky, which led to bis unexpected participation
in this debate, to the effpet that the policy or the Admin
istration was directed expressly to continue tbe war until
another Presidential eleotion, to perpetuate its party
power. It was a monstrous charge. If true, the men
around him, supporters of that Administrasion, were per
jured and black-hearted traitors, and he wou'd rather take
in his own tbe band of one from the oharnel house reeking
with pestilence than to take them by tbe band. He bad
never before heard tbe honesty or patriotism of the Exe
cutive doubted. He continued, in an impassioned remon
strance, against a charge so foul against men whose only
aim was their country, whose only purpose the salvation
of that country,
After a brief Executive session the Senate adjourned.

THE PR0V03T MARSHAL GENERAL'S REPORT.
Col. Fry, the Provost Marshal General, says in his re
port that, in making up the quota for each district, he
took into consideration the number of available men, not
of the population, and drnfted one-fifth of those enrolled in
Class No. 1. The commutation money received at tbe
date of tbe report, November 17, amounted to $10,783,000,
paid by 35,960 men.
Col. Fry recommends that tbe " three hundred dollar
clause," as it is called, be abolished, or limited to the
cases of those whose religious ereed, like that of the
Quakers, will not permit them to bear arms, bnt who cer
tainly cannot be conscientiously opposed to contributing
in this mode to the support of the Government which pro?
tects them, though it may be averse to take up arms.
Col. Fry thinks it probable that " large reinforoemeuta
will be obtained under the President's oall of October 17,
1863, for 300,000 volunteers. If Congress should at an
early day amend the enrollment act, as proposed, the
prospects for getting volunteers will be greatly improved,
and the certainty of getting men by draft, if volunteering
should fail, will be established."
It is recommended that $300 bounty be paid to raw re
cruits for old orga-ticttions, and $400 for veterans. The
present pay and bounty of the soldiers do not compete
with the wages paid throughout the oountry. Procuring
volunteers will be better effected by increasing the bounty
than by increasing the pay.
Eighty-three thousand two hundred and forty-two vo
lunteers were received into the United States aervioe be
tween January 1 and November 1, 1863?68,943 of them
being for three years or the war. Nearly 22,000 abseotee*
and deserters have been apprehended by the offlcera of
this Bureau between 1st of May and 1st of November.
Tbe number of deserters in October is not yet known,
but is probably leas than in September. Assuming, how
ever, that it ia tbe same, it is lound that the number who
deserted and absented themselves in September and Octo
ber is but oue-half as great as tbe number in May and
June. This diminution is attributed to the increased pro
babilities of arrest, and to the punishment reoently infliot
ed upoii deserters. Continued sucoess in tbe arrest of de
serters and adequate punishment will, he think*, reduce
the evil of deaeriion to small proportions.
8ALE ~)F LANDS IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
The " Free South " of the 5th instant gives the recall
of the tax isle of land*, on Bilton Head Island, the pre
vious Tuesday. Nineteen parcels, of from three hundred
to two thousand acres eaoh, near eighteen thousand acre*
in all, were purchased by the United States at an aggie
Kate price of 924,000. Six olher parcels were sold to in
dividuals, the highest at less than three dollar* an aere.
The " Free South " says:
" Most of the valuable locations were needed-for mili
tary and naval purposes, or were woodlands needed for
fuel and timber by the army. The island is inferior for
agricultural purpose*, and its liability to incursion* from
the enemy made a residence on isolated plantation* not
very d-sirable: consequently prices did nut range *o high
as mi||ht have been expected."
DEATH OF GEN. JOHN BUFORD.
It is with sincere regret we have to announce the death
of the pallant Major General John Bcford, of the army.
He died in this city ye?terday, at the residence of Gen.
8toneman, after an illness of four or five weehs, contracted
in his recent arduous duty in the Army of the Potomac,
commencing with diarrhoea and followed by typhoid fever
Gen. Bulord was a native i>f Kentuchy. He graduated at
West Point in 1848, and has been in active aervioe ever
?ince, distinguished in every field by bravery and every
so'dierly quality. His ranh in the regular army w** that
of Assistant Inspector General, and was Brigadier General
of volunteers, but had the commission ?f Major General
placed in bis hands yesterday just before he died, the rank
having been bestowed on him by the President a* a mark
of his distinguished services in the Army of the Potomac
He died with the fortitude of * soldier and the resigoatioa
of a Christian.
We learn that the funeral arrangement* will not he
ma le until the arrival of Mrs. Buford, who wa* telegraphed
two days ago at Roch Island, and may be expected here
Unlay.
THE UNION 8PIRIT IN TEXAS.
The New Otleana correrpondent of the Boston Traveller
writes that the expedition of Gen. Bank* to Texas i* a
glorious success " The Union men of the State are rally
in? under the standard of Gen. Bsnhs in large number*.
All the Texans required was a force to bsck them up, and
they repeatedly said that if a sufficient army wm *ent to
as*;*t they would soon have Tetaa all right again. Thejr
hare already proved the truth of their atatementa, tor Gen.
Banks has recruited two regiments since he landed in the
State, and the work ia still going on. The Texans are
coming forth from their plaees of conoealment and enrolling
themselves in the Uuion army."
1 he Russian naval officers visited the headquarter* of
the Army of the Potomac on Monday l*at, and were ooar*
tenualy received and entertained. During their brief visit
they witnessed a review of the Sixth Army Corps and the
artillery attaohed thereto. Tbey returned to the fleet the
?ante night.
It i* stated that the trade in immorlsli**?the yellow
flower* lor graves?produce* 700,000 franca a year te the
eople of Provence.
