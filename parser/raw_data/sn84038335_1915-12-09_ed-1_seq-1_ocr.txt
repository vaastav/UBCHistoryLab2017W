Washington, D. C., Dec. 7.—President
'Wilson today in his annual message to
•congress explained American ideals
with reference to the future, spoke of
the need of stronger defense in order
to uphold the Mohroe doctrine and
touched upon internal .problems.. He
.specifically scored the un-American
•actions of some citizens and .the-activi
ties of certain 'aliens and requested
the enactment of laws to punish of
fenders. The message follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress: Since I last
had the privilege of addressing you on
the State of thp .union the war ot nations
•on the other side of the sea,, which had
then only begun to disclose its porten
tous proportions, has extended itB threat
ening and sinister scope until it has
•wept within its flame some portion of
.every quarter of the globe, not except
ing our own hemisphere, has altered the
whole face of international affairs, and
now presents a prospect of reorganiza
tion and reconstruction such as states
men and peoples have never been called
•upon to attempt before.
We have stood apart,. studiously neu
tral. It was our manifest duty to do so.
Not only did we have no part or interest
in the policies which seem to have
hfought the conflict on It was necessary,
If universal catastrophe was t6 be
avoided, that a limit should, be set to
the sweep of destructive war and that
aome part of the great family of nations
.Should keep the processes of peace .alive,
W only to prevent' collective economic
rwlq and the' breakdown throughout the
/world of the Industries by which Its pop.-,
ulatlona are' fed and sitatalned-. It was
manifestly the duty of the self governed
nations of this hemisphere to redress, if
possible, the balance of economic loss and
•confusion in tho other, if they could do
nothing more. In .the day of r^adjust
njdntand recuperation, we earnestly hope
and believe that they can be of infinite
aervicc.
New U. 6. Relationships.
Ia this neutrality, to which they were
bidden not only by their sepsu-ate life
arid their habitual detachment from the
politics of Burope, but also by a clear
perception of international "fluty, the
atates of America have become conscious
•of^JMH^'and more vital community of In
tepiet'and, moral partnership in affairs,
nejMto clearly conscious of the many com
mote Sympathies and Interests and duties
which bid them stand together.
There was a time in the early clays of
our .own great nation and of tlie ,repub
lics fighting their way to independence
in Central and South America when the
(government of the United States looked
upon Itself as'in some sort the. guardian
the republics to the south of lier as
against any encroachments or efforts at
political control from the other side of
the„jvater)..felt it lts duty, to,play the
part Oven "without invitation from them
and I think that we can claim that the
task was undertaken with a true and
disinterested enthusiasm for the freedom
of the Americas and the unmolested self
government of lier independent peoples.
But it was always difficult to maintain
su^ a .roie,.wtth9ut- offense -to-the pride
we sought KTfjfBlBctr Hil"WlfliSWF pro!
'voking1 serious misconceptions of Our mo
tives, and every thoughtful man of af
fairs must welcome the altered circum
stances of the new day in whose light
wo now. stand, when, there is no claim
of guardianship or thought of wards, but.
instead, a full and honorable association
as ot partners between ourselves and
our neighbors, in the interest of all
America, north and south. Our concern
for the independence and prosperity of
tiie states of,-Central and South-America
Is not altered. We retain unabated tho
spirit that has inspired us throughout the
whole life of our government anl which
wa3 so frankly put Into words by Presi
dent Monroe. We still mean aiways to
make a common cause of national inde
pendence and of politic. liberty -.In
America. But that purpose is now better
understood so far as it concerns our
selves. It is known not to be a selfish
purpose. It is known to have in it no
thought of taking advantage of any gov
ernment In this hemisphere or playing
Its political fortunes for our own benefit.
AU tho governments of America stand,
no far as we are concerned, upon a foot
ing of genuine equality and unquestioned
independence.
Mexico and Liberty.
We have been put to the test in the
case of Mexico, and we have stood the
test. Whether we have benefited Mexico
by the course we have pursued remains
to-be seen. Her fortunes are in her own
bands.' But we have at least proved that
we will not take advantage of her in her
distress and undertake to impose upon
her an order and government of our own
ohooaing. Liberty is often a fierce and
Intractable thing, to which no bounds can
he set and to which no bounds of a few
men's choosing ought ever to bo set.
Every American who has drunk
at the- true fountains of principle and
tradition 'must, subscribe without reser
vation, to. the. high doctrine of the- Vir
ginia bill of rights, which in the great
iays In which our government was set
up was everywhere amongst us accepted
as the creed of free men. That doctrine
la: "That government is, or ought to be.
Instituted for the cOrnmon benefit, pro
tection, and security of the people, na
tion, or community:" that- "of all the
various modes and forms of government,
that Is the best which is capable of pro
ducing the greatest degree of happiness
and safety, and ia most effectually se
cured against the danger of maladmin
istration, and that.' when any govern

4- *crr no
tabic body of men recently
la the city Washington, at the In­
vitation and as the guests of this gov
ernment, whose deliberations are likely
to be looked back to as marking" a me
morable turning point in the history of
America. They were representatives
spokesmen' of the several independent
states of this hemisphere and were as
sembled to discuss the financial and com
mercial relations of the republics of the
two continents .which nature and political
fortune have so intimately linked to
gether. I earnestly recommend to your
perusal the reports of their proceedings,
and of the actions of their committees.
You will get from them, I think, a fresh
conception of the ease and intelligence
and advantage with whicli Americans
of both continents may draw together in
practical cooperation and of what the
material foundations of this hopeful part
nership of interest must consist—of how
we should build them and of how neces
sary it is that we should hasten their
building.
Destiny of Americas.
There is, I venture to point out, an.
especial significance just now attaching
to this whole matter of drawing the
Americas together In bonds of honorable
partnership and mutual advantage be
cause of the economic readjustments
which the world must Inevitably witness
within the next, generation, when peace
shall have at last resumed Its healthful
tasks. In the performance of these tasks
I believe the Americas to be destined to
play their parts together. I am inter
ested to fix youi' attention on this pros
pect now because unless you take it with
in your view and- permit the full sig
nificance of it to command your thought
I cannot find the right light in which
to set forth the particular matter that
lies at the very front of my whole
thought, as I address you today. I mean
national defense.
Ideals of Democracy
No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people for wnom we
are appointed to speak, can fall to perr
celve that their'passion is for peace, their
genius best displayed in the practice of
the arts of peaiGreat democracies are
not belligerent. They do not seek or de
sire war. Their thought is of Individual
liberty and of the free labor that sup
ports life and the uncensored thought
that quickens It. Conquest and dominion
are not in our reckoning, or, agreeable to
our principles. But just because we de
maud unmolested development and the
undisturbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles, of right and
liberty, we resent from whatever quarter
It may come, the aggression we ourselves
will not practice. We ihsUtt upon security
in prosecuting our self chosen lines of na
tional development. We do more than
that. We demand It also for others. We
do not confine our enthusiasm for indi
..Vidual. liberty .and-free national develop1-'
meiit to tho incidents and movements of
affairs which affect only ourselves. Wo
feel it wherever there is a people that
tries to walk in these difficult paths of
independence and right. From the first
we have made common cause with all
partisans of liberty on this side the sea,
and hay? doejpod it. as Important that
utfflfte We ourseWw
should be have set America aside as a
whole for the uses of independent nations
and political freemen.
Can't Depend on Farmers.
Out of such thoughts grow all our poli
cies. We regard war merely as a means
of asserting the rights of a neople against
aggression. And we are as fiercely leal
pus of coercive or dictatorial power with
in our own nation as of aggression from
without. We will not maintain a stand
ing army except for uses which are as
necessary in times of peace as In times
of war and we shall always see to it that
our military peace establishment Is no
larger than is actually and continuously
needed for the uses of days in which no
enomies move against us. But we do be
lieve In a body of free citizens ready and
sufficient to take care of themselves and
of the governments which they have set
up to serve them. In our constitutions
themselves wo have commanded that "the
right of the people to keep and bear arms
shall not be Infringed," and our confi
dence has been that our safety In times
of danger would lie in the rising of the
nation to take care of itself, as the farm
ers rose at Lexington.
Must Understand War. 'i
But war has never been a mere matter
of men and guns. It is a thing of disci
plined might. If our citizens are ever to
fight effectively upon a sudden summons,
they must know how modern fighting Is
done, and what to do when the summons
cpmes to render themselves immediately
available and immediately effective. And
the government must be their servant In
this matter, must supply them with the
training they need to take care of them
selves and of It. The military arm of
ilielr government, which they will not al
low to direct them, they may properly use
to serve them and make their Independ
ence secure—and not their own independ
ence merely but the right's also of those
with whom they have made common
cause, should they also be put'ln jeopardy
They must be fitted' to play tho great
role in the world, and particularly In this
hemisphere, for which they are qualified
by principle and by chastened ambition
to play.
It Is with these ideals In mind that tho
plans of the department of war for more
adequate national defense were conceived
which will be laid before you. and which
I urgo you to sanction and put Into effoct
as soon as they can be properly scrutin
ized and discussed. They seem to me the
essential first steps, and they seem -to -mo
for the present sufficient.
Proposed Army Increase.
They contemplate an 'increase of the
standing force of the -regular army from
its present strength or 5,023 officers and
102,!«5 enl.sted men ofa.1 services to a
strongth of 7,136 officers ahd 134,707 enlist
ed men,• or 141,843, all told, all.. Horvicea,
rank- and file, by the addition of 62 com
panies of'toast uriillery. is companies of
ongineoris, 10, regiments. or Infantry, four
regiments of'field artillery, and four aero
Squadrons, besides 750 o/llcers required for
a great variety of extra service, especially
chs all Important duty of training the cltlr.
zon force of which I .shall presently speak,
793 noncommissioned officers. for .service
1n dryi, recruiting, and h'e '.like arff' the
necessary quota of enlisted men for the
quartermaster corps, the' hospital corps,
'he ordnance department, nnd other simi
lar auxiliary services. These are the ad
ditions necessary to render the army ade
quate for its present duties duties which
ft has to perform not.only upon, our own
continental Offtaats ahd. borders and At- our
Interior army posts, but also In thtf Phil
Ippines, In the Hawaiian islands, at the
isthmus and .in Porto Rico.
...15y way 'of-'making tho country ready
to assert some' part of ltS'*r£al jower'
promptly and upon a larger scale, should
occasion arise, the plan also contemplates
supplementing the army by' a forde' of
400,000 disciplined citizens, raised'ln incre
ments of 133,M0 a year throughout a
period of three years. This it is proposed.
a"-process-inf -eirtbrt-meet -Glider
which the serviceable men of the countiy
wouM lie uskeU to bind tliemaelve-s
serve with the colors for purposes of
training for short period^. throughout
three years, ahd to come to. the colors at
at any time throughout an additional
futJough period of three years. This'
fored 'of 400.000 men winld be- provided
I thperudna,! accoutrements tig fe«t agien-:
listed and their equlptqent for the field
made ready to be supplied at any time.
They would be assembled for training-at
stated intervals at convenient place* In
assochithm -wltlrimltable unlfs'of "the"teg
ular army. Their period of annual train
ing .would -not necessarily exceed two
month* In the' yean
It would depend upon the patriotic fee
ing ot the younger men or the
wTietfKfer they responded to such a call to
service or not. It would depend upon the.
patriotic spirit of the employers of the
country whether they made it possible for
the younger men In their employ to re
spond under favorable conditions or not.
I, for one, do not doubt the patriotic de
votion either of our young men or of
those who give them employment—those
for whose benefit and protection they
would In fact enlist. I would look for
ward to the success of such an experiment
with' entire confidence.
At least *o much by way of prepara
tion for defense seems to me to be abso
lutely Imperative now. We can not do
lets.
New Naval Plan.
The program which will be laid before
you by,the secretary of the navy is sim
ilarly conceived. It Involves only a
shortening of the time within which planB
long matured shall be carried out but
it does make definite And explicit a pro
gram which has heretofore been only Im
plicit, held in the minds of the commit
tees on naval affairs and disclosed In the
debates of the two houses, but nowhere
formulated or formally adopted. It seems
to me very clear that It will be to the
advantage of the country for the con
gress to adopt a comprehensive plan for
puting the navy upon a final footing of
strength and efficiency and to press that
plan to completion within the next five
years. Wo have always looked to the
navy of the country as our first and chief
line of defense we have always seen it
to be our manifest course of prudence to
be strong on the seas. Year by year we
have been creating a navy which now
ranks very high indeed among the navies
of the maritime nations. We should now
definitely determine how we shall com
plete what we have begun, and how soon.
The program to be laid before you con
templates the construction within five
years ot 10 battleships, six battle cruisers,
10 scout cruisers, B0 destroyers, 15
fleet submarines, 85 coast submarines,
four gunboats, one hospital ship, two
ammunition ships, two fuel oil ships
and one repair ship. It is proposed
that of this number we shall the
first year provide for the construction
of two batleships, two battle cruisers,
three scout cruisers, 15 destroyers, five
fleet submarines, 25 coast submarines,
two gunboats, and one hospital ship the
second year, two batleships, one scout
cruiser, 10 destroyers, four fleet subma
rines. 15 coast submarines, one gunboat,
and one fuel oil ship the third year, two
battleships, one battle' cruiser, two scout
cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet sub
marines, and 15 coast submarines the
fourth year, two battleships, two battle
cruisers, two scout cruisers, 10 destroyers,
two fleet submarines, 15 coast subma
rines, one ammunition ship, and one fuel
011 ship, and the fifth year, two battle
ships,1 one battle cruiser, two scout cruis
ers, 10 destroyers, two fleet submarines,
IE coast submarines, one gunboat, one am
muntlon ship, and one repair ship.
More Men' Needed.
The secretary of the navy is asking also
for the Immediate addition to the per
sonnel of the navy of 7,500 sailors, 2,500
apprentice seamen, and 1,500 marines. This
Increase would be sufficient to care for
the ships which are to be completed with
in the fiscal year 1917, and also for the
number of men which must be put in.
training to man the ships which will be
completed early In 1918. It Is also neces
sary that the number of midshipmen at
the naval academy at Annapolis should be
increased by at least 300 in order that the
force of officers should be more rapidly
added to and authority is asked to ap
point, for engineering, duties only, ap
proved graduates of engineering colleges,
and for service in the aviation corps a
certain number of men taken from civil
life.
If this full program should be carried
out we should have built, or building in
192i according to thi estimates of sur
vival and standards of classification fol
lowed by the general board of the depart
ment, an effective navy consisting of 27
battleships, of the first line, six battle
cruisers, 25 battleships of the second line,
10 armored cruisers, 13 scout cruisers!, five
first class cruisers, three second class
cruisers, 10 third class cruisers, 108 de
'opeig._
18 Xlgpt submarines. 167 coast
-Ivor lujqn "fptlrf
transports, three tenders to torpedo ves
sels, eight vessels of special types, and
two ammunition ships. This would be a
navy fitted to our needs and worthy of
our traditions.
U. S. Merchant Marine.
But armies and Instruments of war are
only part of what has to be considered If
wo are to consider the supreme matter of
national self-sufficiency and security in
all its aspects. There are other gres
matters which will be thrust upon our at
tention whether we will or not. There is,
for example, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping involved In this great
problem of national adequacy. It is neces
for many weighty reasons of national ef
ficiency and development that we should
have a great merchant marine. The great
merchant fleet we once used to make us
rich, that great body of sturdy sailors
who used to carry our flag into every sea,
and who were the pride and often the
bulwark of the nation, we have almost
driven out of existence by Inexcusable
neglect and Indifference and by a hope
lessly blind and provincial policy of so
called economic protection. It is high
time we repaired our mistake and resumed
our commercial Independence on the seas.
Why Ships Are Needed.
For it Is a question of independence. If
other nations go to war or seek to ham
per each other's commerce, our merchants,
it seems, are at their mercy, to do with
as they please. We must use their ships,
and use tlieni as they determine. Wo
have not ships enough of our own. We
cannot handle our own commerce on the
seas. Our independence Is provincial, and
is only on land arid within our own bor
ders. We are not likely to be. permitted
to use even the ships of other nations In
rivalry of their own trade, and arc with
out means to extend our commerce oven
where the doors are wide open and our
goods desired. Such a situation is not to
be endured. It Is of capital Importance
not only that the United States should
be Its own carrier on the seas and enjoy
the economic independence which only an
adequate merchant marine would give It,
but also that the American hemisphere
as a whole should enjoy a like Indepen
dence and self-efficiency. If it is not to be
drawn into the tangle Of European affairs.
Without ouch independence the whole
Setermlnatlon
uestion of our political unity and self
Is very seriously clouded
an'd complicated Indeed.
Moreover, we can develop no true or ef
fective American policy without ships of
our own—not ships of war, but ships of
peace, carrying goods atid carrying much
more: creating friendships and rendering
indispensable services to all interests on
this side of the water. They must move
constantly back and forth between the
Americas. Tney are the only j-hutties
that can weave the delicate fabric of
sympathy, comprehension, confidence, and
mutual dependence in which we wish to
clothe our. policy of America for Ameri
cans.
Remove the Obstacles.
The task Qf building up an adequate
merchant marine for America private cap
ital must, ultimately undertake and
achieve, as It has undertaken and achieved
every other like task amongst us in the
past, -with"admirable enterprise, intelli
gence, and vigor and it seems to me a
manifest dictate of wisdom that we should
promptly remove every legal obstacle that
may stand In the way of this much to do
desired revival of our old independc*'—?
and should facilitate in every possible
way the building, purchase, and American
registration,of ship*.' But capital cannot
accomplish this great task of a sudden.
It must embark upon It by degrees, as the
opportunities of trade develop. Something
must be done at once done to open routes
and develop opportunities where they are
as yet "undeveloped done to open the
arteries of trade where the currents have
not yet learned .to run—especially between
£he two -American continents, where they
are, singularly enough yet to be created
and quickened and It is evident that
only the government can undertake such
beginnings and assume the initial finan
cial risks. When the risk has passed and
private capital begins to' find Its way in
sufficient abundance into these new chan
nels, the .government may withdraw. But
it- ca jnot omit to begin. It should S4ke
ttie fU'st steps, and Bhould take them ut
the roads must not be left without means
of transport to any foreign quarter. We
must riot await the permission of foreign
shipowners and foreign governments to
send them where we will.
What la Proposed.
With a view to meeting these pressing
necessities of our commerce and availing
ourselves at the earliest pnwdblo moment
MISSOURI VALLEY, IOWA, THURSDAY, DEC. 9, 1915.
of the present unparalled opportunity of
Unking the two Americas together in
bonds of "mutual interest and (service, an
opportunity which may never return again
if we miss it now, proposals w(ll .be made
to the present congress for the ^purchase
or construction of ships to be owned and
directed by the government Similar to
those made to the last congress, but modi
fied in some essential particulars. I rec
ommend these proposals to yoll for your
prompt acceptance with the iqore confi
dence because every month that has
elapsed since the former proposals were
made has made the necessity for such
action more and more manifestly Impera
tive. That need was then foreseen It Is
now acutely felt and everywhere realized
by those for whom trade is waiting but
who can find no conveyance for their
goods. I am not so much Interested in the
particular* of the program I am In
taking Immediate advantage 3 the great
opportunity which await* us7lf we will
but act !n thl* amef-gency. ItLthls mat
ter,, a* In alt 'others, a spirit »f common
counsel should prevail, and out of it
should come an early solution of this
pressing problem. f-i-
Insular Problems.
There is another matter whltii seems to
me to be very Intimately associated with
the question of national safetytand prepa
ration for defense. That Is ..our policy
towards the Philippines- and "jthe people
of Porto Rico. Our treatment ot' them
and their attitude towards us lire mani
festly of the first consequence in the de
velopment of our duties in theiVorld and
in ^getting a free hand to perform those
duties. We must be free from*jevery un
necessary burden or embarrassment: and
there is no better way to bo omar of em
barrassment than to fulfil out- promises
and promote tho interests ofrthose de
pendent on us to the utmost. ,-Bills for
the alteration and reform of the govern
ment of the Philippines and fdf rendering
fuller political justice to thor people of
Porto Itlco were submited to tne Sixty
third congress. They will be submited
also to you. I need not particularize
their details. You are most of vou al
ready familiar with them. Biit I 'do rec
ommend them to your early adoption with
tho sincere conviction that there are few
measures you could adopt which would
more servlceably clear the way for the
in enterprises oi peace and goed
economic and political freedom.
The plans for the armed forces of the
nation which I have outllned^luid for the
for
eneral policy of adequate Preparation
mobilization and defense, Involve of
course very large additional expenditures
of money—expenditures whicli will con
siderably exceed the estimated revenues
of the government. It is made my duty
by law, whenever the estimates of expen
diture exceed the estimates *t revenue,
to call the attention of the congress to
the fact and suggest any means of meet
ing the deficiency that it may be wise
or possible for me to suggest. 'I am ready
to believe that It would be iny duty to
do so In any case and I feel particularly
bound to speak of the matter -when It ap
pears that tho deficiency will arise di
rectly out of the adoption by Wve congress
of measures which I myselr 'urgo It to
adopt. Allow me, .therefore, to speak
briefly of tho present state of the treas
ury and of the fiscal problems which the
next year will probably disclose.
Problems of Revenue.
On the 13th of June, last, there was an
available balance in the genetaB.1 fund of
the treasury of $104,170,105.78.'», The total
estimated receipts for the yei&r 1016, on
the assumption that the emergency rev
enue measure passed by the last congress
will not be extended beyond '.its present
limit, the 31st of December, 1915, and that
the present duty of 1 cent Mr pound on
sugar will be discontinued -oner the first
of May, 1916, will be $670.M,5eK The bal
ance ot June last and these estimated rev
enues come therefore, to a grand total
of $774,035,605.78. The total .estimated dis
bursements for the present fiscal year.
Including $25,000,000 for the Panama canal,
$12,000,000 for probable deficiency appro
priations, and $50,000 for miscellaneous
debt redemptions, will be 9iS3,891.000 and
the taflance^in^th^general fund of^the
beyonftltspreaent 'Utttt limit5loS-«oulu
produce, during the half year/ then re
maining, about $41,000,0(10. Thfe duty of
1 cent? per pound on stigar, .If continued,
wouldj-protluce during the two months of
the fiscal year remaining'"after the first
of May, about $15,000,000. These two sums,
T#U,VV»|V»71. A I1UOO inw OUIIIi9i
amounting together to $56,000,000. If added
to the revenue of the second half of tho
fiscal year, would yield tne treasury at
the end of the year an available balance
of $76,644,605.78.
The additional revenues required to
carry out the program of military and
naval preparation of which I have spo
ken, would, as at present estimated, be
for the fiscal year 1017, $93,800,000. Those
figures, taken with the figures for tho
present fiscal year which 1 have already
given, disclose our financial problem for
the year 1917. Assuming that the taxes
Imposed by the emergency revenue act
and the present duty on sugar are to be

the close of the present fiscal year will
be only $20,644,(iOa.78, that tho disburse

mates in 1917 and these additions would
make a total deficit of some $297,000,000. It
the present taxes should be continued
present taxes should be eont.nued
throughout this year and the next, how
ever, there would be a balance in the
treasury of some $76,500,000 at the end of
the pivsent ti.scul iear, and a deficit at
the end of the next yedr of only some
$50,000,000, or, reckoning In $62,000,000 for
deficiency appropriations and a safe
treasury balance at the end of the year,
a total deficit of some $112,000,000. The
obvious moral of the figures Is that It is
a plain counsel of prudence to continue
all of the present taxes or their equiva
lents, and confine ourselves to tho prob
lem of providing $112,000,000 of new rev
enue rather than $297,000,000.
Must Pay as We Go.
How shall we obtain the new revenue?
We are frequently reminded that there are
millions of bonds which tho treasury Is
authorized under existing law to sell to
reimburse the sums paid out of currcut
revenues for the construction of the Pan
ama canal and It is true that bonds to
the amount of approximately
$222,000,000
are now available for that purpose. Prior
to 1913 $134,031,980 of these bonds- had actu
allj' been sold to recoup the expenditures
at the Isthmus and now constitute a con
siderable item of the public deft. Hut I,
for one, do not believe that the people of
this country approve of postponing the
payment of their bills. Borrowing money
Is short-sighted finance. It can In- justi
fied only when permanent things are to
be accomplished which many generations
will certainly benefit by and which it
seems hardly fair that a single genera
tion should pay fur. The objects we are
now proposing to spend money for cannot
tic so -classified, except In the sense thai
everything wisely done may be said to be
done In the Interest of posterity as well
as in our own. It seems to me a clear dic
tate of prudent statesmanship and frank
finance that In what we are now, I hope,
about to undertake we should pay as we
go. The people of the country are en
titled to know Just what burdens of tax
ation they are to carry, and to know from
the outset, now. The new bills should
be paid by internal taxation.
To what sources, then, shall wo turn?
This is so peculiarly a question which the
gentlemen of the House of Representatives
are expected under the constitution to
propose an answer to that you will hardly
expect me to do more than dlscu»s It In
very general terms. We should be follow
ing an almost universal example of mod
ern governments If we were to draw the
greater part or even tho whole of the
revenues we need from the Income taxes.
By somewhat lowering the present lim
its of exemption and tho figure at which
the surtax shall begin to be imposed, and
by increasing, step by step throughout the
present graduation, the surtax Itsrlf, the
income taxes as at present apportioned
would yield sums sufficient to balance
the l)00k3 of the treasury at the enrl of
the-flscal year 1917 without anywhere mak
ing the burden unre:i*ona.biy or oppres
sively heavy. The precise reckonings are
fully and accurately sec out in the report
of the secretary of the treasury which will
be immedlaiely laid before you.
And there are many additional sources
of revenue which can Justly he resorted
to without hampering the Industries of
the country or putting any too great
charge upon Individual expenditure. A tax
of 1 per cent per gallon on gasoline and
iwptha would yield, at the present esti­
mated production. $10,000,000: a tax of 60
cents per horse power on automobiles and
internal explosion engines, $16,000,000 a
stamp lax on bank checks, probably $18,
000,000 a tax of 25 cent* per ton on pig
iron, $10,000,000 a tax of 00 cents per ton oil
fabricated iron and steel,, probably $l'i,
000,000. In a country of great industries
like this it ought to be easy to distribute
tho burdens of taxation without making
them anywhere bear too heavily or too'.ex
clusively upon any one set of persons or
undertakings. What is clear, Js,- that.the
industry of this generation should pay
the bills of this generation.
I have spoken to you today, gentleifien,
upon a single theme, the thorough prepa
ration of the nation to care for its o.wn
security and to make sdre of entire free
d°m. to play the Impartial, -role iti this
hemisphere and in the world which: we
all believe to have been providentially as-
signed to it. I have had In my mind* no
thought of any Immediate or particular
danger arising out of our relations with
other nation*. We are at peaco with all
the nations of the world, and there is rea
son to hope that no question, in contro
versy between this and other govern
ments will lead to any serious breach of
amicable relations, grave as some dif
ferences of attitude and policy have been
and may yet turn out to be. I am sorry
to aay that the gravest threats against
our national peace and safety have been
uttered within our own borders. There
are citizens of the United States, I blush
to admit, born under other flags but wel
comed under our generous naturalization
laws to. the full freedom and opportunity
of America, who have poured tne poison'
of disloyalty Into the very arteries of our
national life who have sought to bring
the authority and good name of our gov
ernment Into contempt, to destroy our in
dustries wherever they thought It effec
tive for their vindictive purposes to
strike at them, and to debase our politics
to the uses of foreign intrigue. Their
number Is not great as compared with
the whole number of those sturdy hosts
by which our nation has been enriched
in recent generation out of virile foreign
stocks but it is great enough- to have
brought deep disgrace upon us and tu
have made It necessary that we should
promptly make use of processes of law by
which we may be purged of their corrupt
distempers. America never witnessed
anything like thla before. It never
dreamed It possible that men sworn Into
Its own citizenship, men drawn out of
great free stocks such g-s supplied some
of tho best and strongest elements of that
little, but. how heroic, nation that In a
high day of old staked Its very life to free
Itself from every entanglement that had
darkened the fortuned of the older na
tions and set up a new standard here—
that men of such orlglns-and such -free
choices of allegiance would ever turn ill
malign reaction against the government
and people who had welcome and nur
tured them and seek to make tliisnipiroUd
country once more a hotbed of ICu'roiWljiijv
passion. A litle while ago such a tliWVf{
would have seemed Incredible. Becaim!:
It was Incredible we made no preparation
for It. We would, have been almost
ashamed to prepare, for It, as if we were
•usplclou* of ourselves our own comrades
and neighbors. But the ugly ami incred
ible thing has actually come about, nno
we are without adequate federal laws to
deal with it. I urge you to enuct such
laws at the eailiest possible moment and
feel that in doing bo 1 am urging you to
do nothing less than save the honon- and
self respect of the nation. Such crea
ture* of passion, disloyalty ,and anarchy
must be crushed out. Thoy-'ave not mapy,
but they are Inf.nltely mal.ntiam, and the
hand of our powr should close over thtm
at once. They have formed plots to de
stroy property, they have entered Into
conspiracies against the neutrality of the
fnto
iovernment, they have sought to pry
every confidential transaction of th
government In order to serve Interest*
alien to our own. It Is possible to deal
with these things very effectually. I
need not suggest the terms In which they
may be dealt with.
Disloyal Americans.
I wish that it could be said that only
a -few men. misled by mistnken scnti
ments of allegiance to the governments
"inder which they wpro born, had been
tfllty of dlaturblnK^hohBelf- -pojwssloii

clples of the Country dtfrlng theHe miVs'
of terrible war, when it would seem that
every man who was truly an American
would instinctively make it his duty and
his pride to keep the scales of Judgment
oven and prove himself a partltan of .no
nation but his own. But it cannot. There
are some men among us, and many resi
dent abroad who, though born and bred
in the United States and calling them
selves Americans, have so forgotten
themselves and their honor as citizens as
to put their passionate sympathy with
one or the other side In the great Euro
pean conflict above their regard for the
peace and dignity of the United States.
They also piemen and practice oisloyaity.
No laws, I suppose, can reach corruptions
of the mind and heart but I should not
speak of others without al.so speaking of
these and expressing tho even deeper hu
miliation and scorn which every self pos
•sessed and thoughtfully. patriotic Ameri
can must feel when he think: of them
and of the discredit they are dailv bring
ing upon us.
Domestic Affairs
While we speak of the preparation of
the nation to make sure of her security
and her effective power we must not fall
Into the patent error of supposing that
her real strength comes from armaments
and mere safeguards of written law. It
comes, of course, from her people, their
energy, their success in.their undertak
ings. Uielr free opportunity to use the
natural resources of our greut home land
and of the lands outside our continental
borders which look to us far protection,
for encouragement, and for assistance.in
their development: from the organization
and freedom and vitality of our economic
life. The domestic questions which en
gaged the attention of the last congress
are more vital to the nation in this Its time
of test than at any other time. We can
not adequately make ready for any trial
of our strength unless we wisely and
promptly direct the force of our laws Into
these all-Important fields of domestic ac
tion. A matter which it seems to me wo
should have very much at heart Is the cre
ation of the right Instrumentalities by
whicli to mobilize our economic resources
In any time of national necessity. 1 take
it for granted that I do not need your au
thority to call into svstematlc consultation
with the directing afflcers of the army
and navy men of ecognlzed leadership
and ability from am\ng our citizens who
are thoroughly familiar, for example, with
(he transportation facilities of the Country
and therefore competent to advise how
they may be co-ordinated, when the nce-1
arises, those who can suggest the best
way in which to bring about prompt co
operation among the manufacturers of
tlie country, should It be necessary, and
those who could assist to" bring the tech
nical skill of the country to the aid of the
government in the solution .of particular
problems of defenao. I only hope that If
I should find it feasible to constitute such
un advisory body the congress would be
willing to vote the small sum of money
that would be needed to defray the ex
penses that would probably be necessary
to give it the clerical and administrative
machinery with which, to do serviceable
work.
Vocational Education.
What Is more important is,. that the in
dustries and resources' of the country
should be availablu and -ready for ruoV
blllzatlon. It is the more Impera
tively necessary, therefore, that ,we
should promptly devlijo means .foe

that we should -give Intelligent fed

vocational education,, as.-we have long
done In the largo Held of bur agricultural,

to make certain that we have the neces
sary instrumentalities of information con
stantly at our service so that we may
I10 sure that wc know exactly what we
are dealing With when we come to act,
if it should be necessary to act at all.
We must first certainly know what it is
that we are seeking to adapt ourselves to.
I "may ask the privilege of addressing vou
more at length 011 this important matter
a little later in .your "session.
Transportation Problem.
In the meantime may I make this sug
gestion? The transportation problem is
an exceedingly serious and pressing one
in this country. There lias from time, to
time of late been reason to fear that our
railroads. Would not much, longer be able
to cope with it successfully, as at present
equipped'-and coordinated. I suggest that
it would be wise to provide for a commis
sion of Imtub'.v to ascertain by a thorough
canvass of the whole question whether
our laws as at present framed and ad
ministered are as serviceable as they
mifrlit be in the solution of the problem.
It-Is obviously a problem that lies at tho
vnry foundation of our efficiency as a
people. Such an inquiry ought to draw
out every circumstance and opinion
worth considering and we need to know
all sides of the matter if we mean to do
anything In the field of federal legisla
tion.
•No 011c, I am sure, would wish to take
any backward step. The regulation of
the railways of the country bv federal
commission has had admirable results
and lias fully justified the hopes aud ex
pectations of those by whom the policy
of regulation was originallv proposed.
The question Is not what should we un
do? It is, whether there Is anything else
Wo can do that would supply us with ef
fective means, in the vcrv process of reg
ulation, for bettering the conditions un
der which the railroads are operated and
for making them more useful servants of
the country as a whole. Jt seems to me
that it might be the part of wisdom,
therefore, before further legislation in
tills field Is attempted,. to look at the
whole problem of coordination and effi
ciency In the full light of a fresh assess
ment of circumstance and opinion, as a
guide to dealing with the several parts
of It-
For what we are seeking now, what in
my' mind Is the *lngle thought of this
mdssade, Is national efficiency and secur
ity. Wc serve a great nation. We should
serve it in the spirit of Its pecular genius.
It Is the genius of common men for self

CHANCELLOR TO DI8CUS8
HIS SPEECH WITH KAISER
Amsterdam, (via London), Dec. i.—
Dispatches: from Berlin state that Dr.4)
von Dethmann-HollWeg, the Germatt
imperial chancellor, has gone to con-^
fcr wifti Emperor William at army
headquarters. It is said that the pur-:
pose of this visit Is to discuss with the
emperor the details of the chancellor's
coming speech in the reichstag, which
is awaited with feverish interest by the
public. Seldom has there been such a.
demand for seats in the galleries of the
reichstag.
(lermany's intentions regarding tho
Balkans and the possibilities of peace
are the chief topics upon which the
chancellor is expected to give light.
SAYS PEACE TALK WILL HAVE
KAISER'8 INDIRECT SANCTION
Paris, Dec. 8.—It would be a mistake
to believe that a discussion of peace
conditions in the reichfetag will be in
stituted against the will of the Ger-,/
man government, according to trust--'
worthy information from Germany,
says the special correspondent of- the
•iftftftpg,rat
Heme.
•7 '.bfc fofcKefrUn,? the COTAfii
respondent writes, "that the hiterpelto
tor is the socialist member, Philipp
Scheidemann, well known to be in.
harmony with the government and
violently opposed to the small group
of opposition socialists of which Dr..
Karl ljiebknecht is the leader.
"The social democrats seek by
means of the interpellation to prevent:
llus minority from voicing a claim that'
it is inducing the government to ex
press itself publiclv on the question
of peace and they are endeavoring at
the same time to facilitate indirectly
the propaganda of .certain groups of
socialist pacifists in allied countries.
"Ou his side Chancellor von Betb
mann-Mollweg is satisfied to have an.
iiccasmn to explain himself regarding
conditions of peace, making it appear
that lie was being forced to the ex
pression by the popular will. The gov
ernment thus could not be reproached
with having taken the initiative in this
matter."
Tin chancellor, the correspondent^
asserts, also counts on certain neu
tral influences, particularly the Vatican
and the White House taking notice ot
the telegram which he will set forth:
and making efforts to have accepted.
"Thus," says the dispatch, "the
scenario is well prepared for the use
of neutrals."
FREE CONSERVATIVES WOULD
