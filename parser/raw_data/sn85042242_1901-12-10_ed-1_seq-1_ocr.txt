TELEGRAPHIC MARKET LETTER
Chicago, Dec. 10.—The reason why
y'ou should busy wheat: Corn is 30c
per bushel higher than last year, oats
25 oenlts higher, wheat only 5c higher.
Wheat is the cheapest of all food com­
modities and in order to bring it up
to a parity with other cereals, it should
advance 20@25c per bushel from pres
nelt figures. "We have continually ad
Vised the purchase ptf wheat for the

vance was coming. The bulge has
just started. Buy some wheat.

Republican Leader of the Mouse Pre­

for Philippines.
—______
Applies Dingley Law Imports to this
Country and the Commission's
Schedule on Exports.
McLaurin-Tillman Dispute is Disciissed
by the Members of the Senate
at Session.
Washlnigton, Dec. 10.—Chairman
Payne of the ways amd means commit­
tee has presented to his Republican
colleagues of the committee a reVenne
tariff bill for the Philippines, Which he
had drawn to meet the conditions of
the recent supreme court decision.
The Republican members of the com­
mittee met ait 10:30 o'clock to continue
the discussion of the general subject.
Flie meeting was executive and was
preliminary to a meeting of the full
committee when the Philippine tariff
will be submitted to the Democratic
members and be voted upon. The
"Payne bill is quite brief, with two
main features, viz.: Applying the
Dingley law as against Philippine ex­
ports to this country and applying the
Philippines commission's tariff sched­
ule to goods entering the Philippine^.
A further section grants a rebate of
customs tariffs on goods which have
paid an internal revenue tax in this
country. There is no proviso in the
measure that it shall be temporary,
so that the rates, if imposed, would
be applicable until congress otherwise
acted.
During the debate it developed that
Mr. Russell (Conn.) and some other
Republican member® strongly favored
the proviso to the biill offered by Mr.
Payne by which the tariff rates would
be scaled down from 15 to 20 per cent
on goods passing between the United
States and the Philippines. This was
urged on the ground that Great Brit
adn now 'had 40 per cent of the trade
of the Philippines and Germany and
other European countries held a con­
siderable percentage, while the United
States haxl only about 5 per cent of the
trade. On. this account it was urged
by Mr. Russell that the United States
should have some concession as
against foreign countries to gain a fair
share of the trade of the Philippines
for American goods.
SOUTH CAROLINA ROW.
McLaurih-TiUmar Dispute Comes Up
in the Senate.
Washington, Dee. 10.—After the
usual preliminary business in the sen­
ate, which included the presentation
of numerous petition®, memorial and
joint resolution®, etc., Mr. Gallinger
(N. H.) asked for the printing of the
documents relating to ecclesiastical
holdings in the Philippines. He said
there wis a great demand for this doc­
ument. The printing was ordered.
Mr. McLaurin (S. C.) made a speech
in the senate during the day defining
his position, in South Carolina and dis­
cussing the campaign in that state as
well as his position regarding federal
patronage in South Carolina and his
relationship with it. He said the cam­
paign against him has been one of
calumny, vituperation and misrepre­
sentation. As to the appointments in
the state he sought to have Democrats
appointed and where these could ftot
be accomplished, he tried to have such
Republicans selected as would give
satisfaction to the people. He did not
want the crime Q? burning a postmas­
ter repeated in his state.
Mr. MfTjaurin said the movement
against him in the Democratic party
was one to keep alive sectionalism.
Speaking of his views on the tariff he
staid that Samuel J. Randall was a pre
tectionist, Hancock said the tariff was
a local issue and David B. Hill opposed
the income tax, but none had been vead
out of the Democratic party.

GIGANTIC SKELETONS FOUND.
Hunters Discover a Wonderful Cave
in Jefferson Canyon, Mon.
Butte, Mon., Dec 10.—A new cave
,that gives promise of developing into
the most wonderful of its kind in the
known world, has been discovered in
the mountains about 48 miles east of
Butte, in Jefferson canyon.
Its extent is as yet unknown, though
it has been explored for a distance of
10 miles and to a depth of about 800
feet.
The entrance to the cave, which is
near the track of the Northern Pacific
railway, and about 1,600 feet above the
bed of the river, was discovered a
few weeks ago by a hunter, and the
cavern has just been explored by a
party headed by J. W. Gilbert.
Several skeletons were found in one
of the many rooms, and many articles
and utensils of stone and copper weTe
lying about, some of which have been
brought out.
The skeletons are of people of gigan­
tic stature, and the belief of Mr. Gil­
bert is that the cave was the abode of
a prehistoric people, and that further
exploration will bring to light proof of
that fact and more remains of its in­
habitants.
A theory is that by a sudden change
and disturbance of earth, the entrance
to the ancient home was closed and
the inhabitants walled up and left to
die.
A large river with a fail of 100 feet
at one place is one of the wonder*
of the caVe, and a score of apartments,
eome hundreds of feet in extent, are
decorated with the wondrous forma­
tions of nature.
UNIVERSITY EXTENSION.
Andrew Carnegie to Donate $10,000,000
to the Cause.
Chicago, Dec. 10.—A dispatch to The
Record-Herald from Washington says:
Andrew Carnegie is to give $10,000,
000 to the cause of university eiten
sipn in the United States. Mr. Garner
gie was here a few days ago and took
luncheon with: President Roosevelt,
when details of the plan were fully
discussed.
Mr. Carnegie has thought best tb
create a national board to handle this
magnificent benefaction. President
Roosevelt will probably nominate such,
a 'board, or at least set in motion the
machinery which, shall lead to a na­
tional organization.
Nicholas Murray Butleir, who has
succeeded Setfh Dow at the head of Co­
lumbia college, -has been here_for two
days, a gue&t of President Roosevelt a+
t)he White House, and he has aided in
perfecting the plans. Mr. Birtler has
long been one of the foremost cham­
pions of university extension and it is
understood Mr. Carnegie has had fre­
quent consultations with him concern­
ing the enterprise.
According to the plans prepared by
Mr. Carnegift and his advisers the na­
tional organization is to ha/ve its head­
quarters in Washington, but its oper­
ations are to extend through the Unit­
ed States, the work to be carried on
in co-operation with universities every­
where.
COAL EXPORTS DECREASE.
Resumption of the Outcry Against the
British Export Tax.
New York, Dec. 10.—The situation in
the British coal trade is causing a good
deal of apprehension on the part of
owners and merchants and there is a
resumption Tf the outcry against the
export tax which formed so prominent
a feature of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach's
last budget, says the London corre­
spondent of The Tribune. Coal exports
have decreased by 158,000 tons during
the first 10 months of the present year

Consideration of Senate by
Senator Frye.
Gives One Cent Per Gross Ton Per
Hundred Miles to All Vessels
Carrying Flag.
Additional Allowance Provided for the
Promotion Building of [New
Vessels in U. S.
Washington, Dec. 10.—Senator Frye
has introduced the new ship subsidy
bill. It differs in form from the sub­
sidy bill of the past two sessions and
is divided into four titles and fifteen
sections.
The sections under the title, "Ocean
Mail Steamship®," are devoted to
amendments to the ocean mail act of
1891. The postmaster general is re­
quired to consider the national de­
fense and the maritime interests of
the United States as well as postal
interests in providing for the transpor­
tation of American ocean mails.
The present limit of ocean mail con
tracts, 10 years, is increased to 15
years. The Frye bill provides seven
distinct classes, with a rate of $6 to 20
knot steamers, increasing from 8,000
to 10,000 the minimum size $3 for 16
knot steamers, provided the size is in­
creased from 5,000 tons, the present
minimum, toi8,000 tons. The proposed
maximum mail rates per gross ton per
100 nautical miles are Over 10,000
tons, 20 knots, 2.7 cents 19 knots,
2.5 cents. Over 5,000 tons, 18 knots.
2.3 cents 17 knots, 2.1 ceuits 16 knots,
1.9 cents 15 knots, J..7 cents. Over
2,000 ton®, 14 knots, 1.5 cents-
Rates for mail steamers to the West
Indie®, Central America and Mexico
cannot exceed 70 per cent of the max
imum rates.
The second title, "General Subsidy,'
contains the general subsidy for all
vessels, steam or sail, which are not
under mail contracts. This general
subsidy is uniform, 1 cent per gross
ton per 100 nautical miles for not ex
ceeding 16 entries in one year.
To promote the building of new
pcean vessels an additional allowance
of one-fourth of a cent per gross ton
is made for five years.
Any vessel to receive the general
subsidy must carry mails, if required,
and must train in seamanship or en
gineering one American youth for
eachi 1,000 tons1, the vessel to be at the
service of the government if required
for defense.
Any vessel to receive subsidy must
be Class A1 and at least one-fourtih
of the crew must be Americans.
The bill provides an annual bounty
of $2 a ton for deep sea fishing vessels
and of $1 a month for American citi­
zens when engaged in deep sea fish­
eries that a vessel shall receive only
one form of subsidy and that a vessel
which has received subsidy shall not
be sold to a foreigner except by con­
sent of the secretary of the treasury.
The bill does not provide American
registry for foreign ships owned by
Americans.
WHEAT GOING UPWARD.
Way Option Touches 83 3-4, a New
Crop Record.
Chicago, Dec. 10.—Over confident
shorts in the wheat market came to
grief just before the"close. Many of
the usual controlling conditions of the
market were bearish and this had in­
duced many traders to sell freely.
Prices in all grains broke jaggedly
the opening and the early indications
were that the anticipated slump was
at. band. But the "wise ones" had
counted without their host. Twenty
minutes before the close wheat had
been pressed down to 81% cents fcr
May options. Then with a roar that
could be heard well down into La
Salle street buying which told of an
oversold market began. Trade was
heavy all day, ijut now it began again
with the wildest scenes of disorder.
Brokers rushed disheveled into the pit,
buying, buying, buying and May
wheat sold up to a new crop record
price at 83% cents. The rise seemed
to be genuine, for it held here well
and, under the terrible profit-taking
pressure that had been going on all
day, May olosed very strong at 83%@
83% cents.
Corn was also' affected but not so
materially. May had broke quickly1 at
the opening and was down to 67%
cents. Wheat strength, however,
brought it up to 68% cents.

Kentucky Mountaineers Attempt to Re­
lease a Prisoner.
Corbin, Ky., Dec. 10.—Friends of
Barry Howard, the mountain feud
leader, made an attempt to rescue
him as he was being taken to Frank­
fort to answer an indictment .charging
him with complicity in the murder of
William Goebel, for Which he had been
arrested by Sheriff Broughton and his
deputy, who got the drop on Howard
and his bodyguard after luring them
into Pineville.
As soon as Howard was arrested Ms
friends, who had protected him for
nearly two years, swore he should nev­
er be taken to FYankfort A guard of
25 armed men was maintained over the
prisoner while here and 10 men ac­
companied Sheriff Broubhton and the
prisoner to Frankfort.
When the train reached Pineville
Sheriff Broughton and his posse board­
ed it with the prisoner and were given
one of the coaches, which was locked
at both ends. At the same time three
men, friends of Howard, boarded the
engine. They covered Engineer John
Laugan with pistols and commanded
him to back the train to Middlesboro,
the intention being to rescue Howard
where his friends are greatest and
where the mountains afford the quick­
est escape.
Only the resourcefulness of the en­
gineer saved the situation for the sher­
iff. Taking advantage of an opportu­
nity When his guarls were otherwise
engaged he opened the throttle and the
train escaped the crowd of rescuers.
KILLED BY BOLOMEN.
Fate of a Party of Montana Prospect,
ors in the Philippines.
White Sulphur Springs, Mon., Dec.
10,—The fate of George Hayes and a
party of three prospectors, who left
here to prospect in the Philippines in
1899, has been revealed in a letter just
received in the city. The party has
been missing since March, 1900, and
every effort to locate them has been
futile up to this time. Rev. J. C. Len
hart, formerly a minister in Hawaii, re­
siding at Manila, was induced by
friends of the missing men to take up
the search. Diligent inquiry on' his
part disclosed the fact that the party,
disregarding the warnings of the mili­
tary men not to venture beyond their
lines of defense, had gone into the
mountains of Central Luzon. Later the
bodies of the four men were found lit­
erally! chopped to pieces by bolomen,
The heads and arms were severed
from their bodies and the bodies were
otherwise horribly mutilated.
Hayes and James Brown were identi­
fied by papers found on their persons,

Boers Do Not Find It Difficult to Get
Through British System of
Blockhouses.
Must Be Closer Together, Which Will
Require More Time and Men
from the British.
Government Delays Announcing the
October Death List in South
African Camps.
New York, Dec. 10.—A Pretoria car
respondent of The. Times says:
There is much yet to be done in pro­
tecting the country by lines of block­
houses before the British can hope to
clear the Boers away from the East­
ern districts of the Transvaal. It is
found that blockhouses a mile or so
apart are useless to prevent the pass­
ing of Boers at night when they axe
determined to cross. Nothing dhort
of blockhouses six pr seven hundred
yards apart and connected by means
of formidable wire entanglements will
prove effective.
To thread the country in this way,
says the correspondent, requires time
and men, but in the opinion of the
military authorities it is the only
method of dealing with an enemy who
refuses to fight openly. The British
public must tiherefore be patient
North of the Pretoria railway' tine, the
dispatch goes on to say, the Boers arc
free from the British column. The
mountain ranges afford endless hiding
places for the enemy, supplies are
plentiful, and wheat which finis Its
way all over the country is carefully
concealed for future use. It is impossi­
ble to avoid this unless the Boers are
kept moving and to effect this many
more troops are required.
