ELLENSBT'RG. Wash.. Dec. 3.—j
Ellensburg was thrown wide open
today, when W. .1. Peed was elected
mayor over .1. 11. Morgan by a ma- '
jority of seven votes. The election
came as a surprise, as it was gener
ally conceded the old order of Sun-*
day closing would prevail. The elec

run 24 hours a day for 365 days.

HENRI' H. LOMBARD—I w*Kh to express my appreciation ol
Hie big majority which the boys rolled Op for me. In return lor tbe
honor bestowed I will do everything in my power to i any out the
polity outlined during the campaign. A square deal will be accord
ed to all alike: pavements will he placed as soon as possible; a
thorough system of retrenchment as far as finances are concerned
will he carried OU* and running expenses of the city curtailed to
bring Xorth Yakima bock on an even and a business basis."
The entire Business Men's Ticket
was elected Tuesday.
A squan' deal business administra
tion triumphed over the Armbruster
faction and the majorities are so
large it seems almost a shame to
make them public. Even In the
fourth ward, where Armbruster was
the strongest, and where it was
feared tne head of the ticket would
be so strong as to undermine the
chances of the candidate for council
man John J. Miller, on his own per
sonal m*>-:its, was carted into office
by a small majority.
.Never in the history of North Yak
ima has there been such a deter
mined desire on the part of the bet
ter element to down a candidate as
was displayed Tuesday when delib
erately the Lombard supporters went
to work to snow under Armbruster
so badly as to give him a hint that
his further service as a public effi
cial in North Yakima is not particu
larly desired.
The majorities, with the exception
of two wards, are so decided that
early in the evening all hope of Arm
bruster's election was gone. It has
been conceded all week that the west
side councilman had not the ghost
of a show, and attemps to secure bets
from the Armbruster supporters
proved a dismal failure. Plenty of
bluffs were put up but as promptly
called, and on nearly every occasion
Armbruster money crawled back in
the pocket much more rapidly than
it was produced.
The sad. sad story of the west side
councilman's defeat and retirement
