The new swird of State recently
cyxmpleted for his royal nibs, the King
of S:ani, is double-edged, spear-shapeil
and fifteen inches Kxng. Tow aid the
hilt it is inlaid xvith gold of varying
tints, wrought in different devices, the
figure of Buddha being prominent on
each side. The handle, which has no
cross-guard, is seven inches in length,
and consists of enameled work studded
with diamonds, while the sheath is one
entire piece of wrought gold, set with
precious stones.
Cracked earthenware should never
be used for domestic purposes. It is a
safe rule in good housekeeping to
break any fractured stoneware to
pieces and render them quite unfitted
for any employment as utensils. In a
paper read before the Academy of Sci
ences, Paris, M. E. Peyrusson demon
strated very clearly how the germs of
cholera, typhoid fever and similar dis
eases may be preserved and communi
cated by even the slightest crack or fis
sure, which may be caused by very
trifling accidents to crockery and
faience.
s>ir James P<*get. one of the most
eminent of British surgeons, recently
addressed the wurkingrnen's college,
London, on the subject of recrea
tion. He says that recreation does
not consist, as many persons
wrongly imagine, in idleness, but
rather in diversion, and in the em
ployment of different sets of mental
faculties from those which are used in
the ordinary business of life.
James Paget analyzed true recreation
as consisting to a greater or 'ess degree
of the elements of uncertainty, won
der and the exercise of unwonted or
unusual skilL
In his recently published book on
"Farm Fences," Professor Scott esti
mates that five dollars is invested in
fences for every acre of inclosed land
in Great Britain and Ireland, and that
the annual maintenance of fences costs
about seventy-five cents an acre. The
total capital thus invested in the United
Kingdom must be, at this rate, nearly
$250,000,000, and the annual outlay
about $32,000,000. Professor Scott be
lieves that a great deal of fencing
might be dispensed with to the posi
tive advantage of agriculture, and that
the general introduction of wire in
stead of wood would effect a great ad
ditional saving.
Standard of Education.
According to Buskin, an educated
man ought to know these things: hirst,
where he is—that is to say, what sort
of a world he has got into ; how large
it is, what kind of creatures live in it,
and how ; what it is marie of, and what
may be made of it. Secondly, where
he ingoing—that is to say, what chan
ces or reports there are of any other
world beside this ; what seems to be
the nature of that other world. Third
ly, what he had best do under the cir
cumstances —that is to say, what kind
of faculties he possesses; what are the
present state and wants of mankind ;
what is his place in society ; and what
are the readiest means in his power of
attaining happiness and diffusing it-
The marl who knows these things, and
who has his will so subdued in the
learning of them that he is ready to
do what he knows he ought, is an ed -
ucated man ; and the man who knows
them not is nrneducated, though he
would talk all the tongues of BabeL

It was a very larje cent, and it
shune as if lAakie had jvlisheil it.
"That's Worth two -ticks." said the
grocer-boy. "We don't often get such
a shiny one. What're you going to
have in your stocking?"
"Nothing. I gueNS." > tid Dakie; "I'm

"Oh," said the grocer-I)cy, wrapping
up the two sticks of candy; and Iakie
didn't see him pay f<-r one of them
out of his own pocket. "Tiiat'sit."
A lady-customer at the other end of
the counter was giving Mr. Daley a
good many orders, hut she had ears
for the conversation on between Dakie
and the grocer-lioy. and she smile.} at
Dakie as she went po>t him out of the
store-door.
Perhaps that would have leon the
end of it, if, on her way home in
carriage a little later, eht? had not
passed Dakie again with one arm full
of liis small parcels. Just at that
minute a lig dog liounfod up against
him, and down went Dakie onthedde
walk; and the paper <u sugar hurst
open, and the raisins were scattered
about, and more than half of the
crackers went into the gutter.
"Ob dear me!" said Dakie, as he
began manfully to repair as much of
the mischief as he could.
"No pudding now," thought the
lady; and in a minute more she was
being driven back to Mr. Daley's
store.
There the soap-box was pulled out
from under the counter, and into it
went all sorts of nice things; rai.-ins
and currants and figs and nuts and
candies, until it was quite full. Then
the cover was nailed on and Mr. Daly's
man was hurried away with it to
Dakie's home, wlieie it arrived almost
as soon as Dakie himself.
"Why, why, who sent it?" cried
Dakie.
"I don't know," said Mr. Daley's
man.
But Dakie knew the moment he
rend, in big letters on the cover, "For
the baby's Santa Clans."
"It was the lady!" cried be. Oli,
isn't she— beantiful!"
"Bu'ful!" echoed the baby.— Youth's

Since the days of the Stuarts the in
crease of wealth in Kngland has been
more rapid than the increase of popu
lation. In 1860 the wealth of England
and Wales was equal to £45 per head;
in 1872 it was £127, and last year,
£249. Public wealth had quadrupled
since the Waterloo epoch, and doubled
since the accession of Queen Victoria.
Bince 1840 wealth has increased four
times more rapidly than population.
