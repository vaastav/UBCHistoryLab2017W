THE INDIANA STATE SENTINEL, WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 3, 1879
WITH SUPPLEMENT.
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3.
The war department asks for $29 319,701
next year.
Thi Sunday Sentinel claim a circulation of
7U. Indianapolis Republican.
The claim is well foundnd.
xx reason given by the Journal for want
ing so macy negroes in Indiana is that farm
laborers are scarce. This is a nice time to
bring them into the State after all the crops
bare been gathered. Perhaps the persim
mon crop is cot all ia yet.
Electricity is now being advocated to
take the place of the gallows. It is claimed
that it would be an intt intaneous, cheap
ft d bnmane way of getticg rid of crim
inais. if lightning would ever strike twice
in the same place it might be utilized to
great advantage. However, there is no way
to make billing people a popular affair.
AsorHBEroinlnent Republican negro has
been assassuiated In KouUi Carolina, but, as
usual, poll lies had iiothlDg to do with it. Cin
cinnati Commercial.
This means, of coarse, that politics bad
something to do with it. The dispatch an
nouncing this recent murder said: "William
Nix was a .stalwart Ripublican. He was
killed by Barntf Jeffcourt, not for political
reasons, bat because be was a witness against
Jeffcourt, who ?cs accused of ha vice viclit

OBITUARY.
GENERA i EFFBRSON C. DAVIS.
.Chicago, III., Nov. 30, 1879.
To General John Love, Indianapolis, Ind.:
General Jeff. C. Davis died at 8-.3CO' pneumo
jila, at the Palmer House. Mrs., Davis will
leave here with the body at 8 to-morrow even
ing. P. H. HHER1DAN,
Lieutenant Geueral.
The above, with similar dispatches to other
parties, were received In the city last evening
abont 8 o'clock. As General Davis was in this
city a short time ago, in apparent good health
his many friends were much surprised and
pained at the sad intelligence.
General Davis was born la Clarke county,
Ind., March 2, 18.8. Ha entered the Mexican
war when but a boy, enlisting in Colonel
Lane's regiment. For. gallant conduct at
Buona Vist he was promote! to a second
lieutenantcy in the First United States artil
lery. In 1832, anl afterward in 1857, he was
engage! in settling Indian difficulties in the
Sooth. At the breaking oat of the rebellion
he formed one of General Aaderson'd gallant
command at Port Sutnpter, when the first gun
was fired. Previous to this he had charge of
the cargo of an African slaver,
"which had been, captured. Several writs
of habeas corpus were served against htm by
the excited people of Charleston, but he re
fused to surrender the slaves. The yellow
fever breaking out among then) settled the
question, and carried off so many of them that
Davis was allowed to send tb4 balanse to Li
beria. V . ; .
At tU9 siege of gamier, Davis was the only
lndianian in the garrison. He was on tbe ram
parts when, early ia the morning of April IS.
18U1, the fir&t shell exploded over the foit. He j
had command of a battery during the bom
bardment, which silenced a floating battery,
and alter the surrender he was promoted to a
captaincy, and came to Indianapolis as mus
tering officer for Indiana. Alter sev
eral months of severe, labor in organizing
and eqipplng regiments, he led the Twenty
second Indiana to the field, after having been
detained some time in camp at St. Louis. Be
was ordered to relieve General Grant of the
command of all forces between the Missouri
and Ot age rivers. At Mllford, Missouri, he
captured a superior force, and for gallant con
duct at this point he was promoted to a briga
dier generalship. At the battle of Pea Ridge
he commanded a division, and participated at
the Dattle of Corinth, Miss., after which he
was assigned to auty la the Army of the Ten
nessee. About this time In the career of General
Davis, or to be exaction the morning of Septem
ber ', lHoi, there nappened a very sad affair.
We refer to the killing of Gdueral Nel
son, at Louisville. lie had ordered
General Davis to Cincinnati, and Davis
approaching hiui for sume exp.anatlon regard
ing tbe order or matters connected with
It. was met by Neison wlta (it was
said) curses and other grossly insult
ing language. The meeting took place in
Louisville, in the office of the Louisville Hotel.
Tav1m. aston nded aud inoron'hlv aronsMl at
the reception on the part of Nelson, stepped
aside, borrowed a pistol from a friend, and
shot Nelson dead as he ascended the hotel
stairway to his room. He was arrested, but
never tried, and soon ordered on duty again.
General Davis was Justified generally by pub
lieopluion in tbe affair. He coininauded a
division in the battles around Marlreesboro,
and notably and magnificently at
Chlckamagua, in which terrible bat
tie it has been - claimed by his
friends that be ajoue withstood tbe re
peated and terriflo advances and on-laughts
of the Confederate army. This was one of the
most terrible battles of the war, and if anyone
had any douots of General Davis' a hi ltles to
handle a large body of mm successfully and
victoriously, such doubt were dispelled alter
the battle of Uuickamauga.
In the Atlantaeampaiga and In Sherman's
march through Georgia General Davis com
manded tbe Fourteenth army corps He was
braveited a major geueral at the end of tbe
war, and in July, l, made colonel of the
Twenry-thlrd infantry oi the regular army.
Alter tne war he was stationed on tbe Pacific
coast, eominaudlog lor some time tbe
trooDS in onr now pjssessiou of Alas
ka. After the murder of General Can by
by the Modoo ind.ans he took command of
the army and compelled the Indiana to
surrender. During th past summer General
lavu du oeeu vumiug uis irieuua iu i uuian
with bis wife, who wa adaughterof tbe iate
Dr. Atoon, a we i-anown citizen oi mis cry
for many years His wile survives him. We
believe in it he leaves no children. '
After the b unbardmeut of Sumpter some of
bis friends of ibis city decided to pteseut uim
with a sword as a testimonial to hU bravery
and gallantry Tblswasat the begiuniug of
tbe war, when tula sort of toing was aone
ostent&tiouslv. aud wuh some punpandcir
en instance. The general would have little or
noce einony. He insisted tbatltsb aid be
done verv iiuieuv and without any uubllclty.
and thus it waidu e by the lae Dick Ryaa,
Esq., who, wun a very small party, met, if we
mistake not, in tbe office . of a
livery stable - on . Illinois streak
Mr. nun mada a fw remarks, and tbe
general accepted, tbe gift wltu heartfelt thanks
ana gratitude, ueuerai isavw won i""
courteous gentleman unobtrusive almost to
diffidence, and as brave and courageous as a
lion. As onr .dispatches indicate, bis body
will arrive in the city on Tuesday morning,
and the arrangements for the funeral will be
made public as soon as known.

The Cincinnati Enquirer: "Senator Bay
ard may organize his personal boom on a non
sectional basis, bat he will find that the op
positi jD to him will be seciional in tbe most
exasperating way. His fight against the
sliver dollar will not be forgotton in the West."
As Kellogg was elected by a "rump" Legis
lature, and the evidence accumulating day by
day that his election was the result of rascal
ity and fraud, he should be ousted as soon as
the Senate gets down to serious work. The
demand is for a "boom" in the direction in

loss of one who for over 49 years was all that a

brought to his home that peace and bliss that

A friend of Chief Justice Chase attributes
his death to the fact that he had not practiced
law for 20 years when he became chief Justloe,
and found himself so deficient among tbe pro
found old Judges associated with him, that he
studied day and night to remedy bis defects
and bring himsslf up to the fit standard, and
under this mental strata he broke down.
The Boston Post: "Even the Republican
arithmetls man c in not make out a satisfac

States out of tbe Democratic ranks, where
they have always been, just to make his po

given to Commodore Garrison on the purchase
of the securities of the Missouri Pacific l all
road a few days ago. Is said to be the largest
check ever drawn by any private individual
In this country. "That amount," said Goif!d
to the commodore, when the little bit of paper
passed between tbem, "is only a portion of
the money I made in my operations in ,"
naming certain stock now apparently on
the down grade. .
. A romantic young couple, living In Lisbon,
N. H., went out lor a drive, and in returning
were carried by their runaway horse Into the
Am monoosuc river. It was so dark tuat they
dared not turn around. The horse swam
across with them, but tbe water In tbe deepest
part encircled their necks, though they stood
upon tbe buggy seat. The opposite bank being
too steep for the horse to cilm b, the eouple got
ashore over the shalts and rescued the horse
by cutting him loose. ,
At New Philadelphia, O., a huge dog, in at
tempting to scale a high fence into a yard,
misled his calculations and landed at the bot
tom of he well, 60 feet deep. The family
thought the water rather "iLey" next morn
ing, but could not account for it. About noon
the hired girl, upon looking iulo the well, dis
covered a pair of gleaming eyes staring at her
from the bottom. Help was obtained and the
dog drawn op. He In the well about 16
hours and kept alive by swimming all the
time. :
MR. Spurg eon, it appsars, "makes no bones
of takin f wnat material he wants from the
sermons of others. Dr. Aruaitage Is quoted as
saying that he heard Mx. Spuigeou preach a
beautiful sermon one day, aud at its close tbe
famous Englishman announced to his ugre
gation that half of the discourse he had just
preached he bad got from Jukes, an excellent
English divine, adding: "Next Sunday we
shall be Indebted to him for two-thirds of the
sermon whloh you will hear." And he fin
ished with a commendation of the book to his
people. ; ...
H. C. Long, of Delaware, who recently mar
ried for fun, has done the thlug again in a
serious way. In 1873, when he was only 18
years old, he. was walking la Phllalelphla
with Miss Lucy Robinson, a young inlssol 15,
when, he proposed that they should be mar
ried. She agreed, and in tea tnlautej the J jku
was carried into eSdat. He took her tJ the
house at which sbe was visiting, and they did
mot meet ag&la for a year or more. They sub
sequently bee tram wars that the Jooular mar
riage was binding, and, as bo h had formed
other attachments, a divorce was applied lor
and granted.
Onb of the ladles of the harem of his high

The Piccolo quotes the Corriere del Mattino,
confirming tne report: "it may be regar led as
true," it say, "f jr the QiaMtura haa disco v
end the nest of the doves at Foggta, but when
the discovery was made tney were alraady
married according to the civil la jr. The lady,
it Is said, is French, and the acquaintance
was made la a somewhat romantic
way.' The gentleman, a Big nor D IS U
was painting in tbe neighborhood of tbe
khedive's house, when from a distance he
caught sight of the lady and was couqueied.
Some suspicion having been awakentu, the
artist was prohibited from painting any more
at that sp t, and fall two months have passed
since tbe journals reported that an artist had
been driven away with some violence by a
boatload of the x-khedlve retainer. An
intercourse by signal, however, was renewed,
and after a good deal of telegraphing the lady
disappeared." ' .
- One of tbe most remarkable results of the
late election in Virginia was that in which an
old politician, who had been frequently elected
to the Legislature, was defeated by his former
slave. '
Leading Southern men who bave recently
arrived In Washington say that the Northern
Democrats most select the head and tall of the
presldental tic set, and the Southern States
will come np to the scratch with 138 electoral
votes. They only ask their Northern brethren
to carry New York and Indiana, and they will
do the rest.
Tax Indianapolis 8un (Greenback) says that
the negro has precisely the same right to come
to Indiana that the white man haa to go to
North Carolina, but the party that organized
the scheme for destroying the ballots of the
worklngmen or Indiana by driving tbe ne
groes into our State deserves to be sunk to the
lowest regions.
The Noblesvllle Independent says: Mr.
Hendricks, the favorite son or Hooslerdom
has been interviewed. He says he will sup
port the nominees of bis party, and that he
would regret that Indiana should go against
them. Governor Hendricks, agreeable totals
most worthy record, stands prepared to fight
for tbe right and do his duty under any and
all clrcu a. stances.
Ssxator Voorheks, In a recent interview,
in alluding to Mr. Hendricks, said: "I regard
him as one of the very ablest men in this
country. I have known him all my life and
under all circumstances. He Is a man of the
first order of ability and of the highest courage,
physically, morally and Intellectually. If
elected president his administration wonld be
able and pure. It would take rank with the
administrations of the earlier president;."
The New York World says that a number of
leading Republican statesmen and patriots
are on trial In Pennsylvania for bribery, cor
ruption, perjury, and a few more cardinal
vices of the same sort. So patent Is their in
nocence, and so eager are they to demonstrate
it, that tbey are fighting tooth and nail to get
off on technicalities, instead of going to trial
on tbe merits of the cases. The Indictments
should be quashed at once and the patriots
bailed over to a future term. Their help will
be Indispensable in the next presidential cam
paign for Grant, Cameron and civil service
reform. ,
Hos. J. W. Smithek. of Arkansas, being
asked whom the Arkansas Democrats desired
lor president, replied: "Anybody who can be
elected. Were they to consult their personal
preferences, tbey would designate Mr. Hen
dricks. But they would support Seymour or
Hancock with equal enthusiasm. Toe course
of Mr. Bayard on the Warner silver bill during
the extra session of Congi ess has rendered him
somewhat unpopular, but tbe great majority
of the people of Arkansas are Democrats, and
they will support the Democratic nominee, no
matter who he is." " Whom do the Repubii
c ins favor?" "Gran t.decidedly. Even the office-holders
are for Grant, though tbey say
little." . ,
A recent Washington special says one of
the most curious statements yet advanoed
why the Seymour boom should be encouraged
by Democrats and that Seymour should be the
Democratic nominee, was made by a New
York politician in (his city to-J'ny. Said be:
"The ticket must bs Seymour and Hendricks.
Seymour can sit In his home In Ullca and
without an effort on his part can carry New
York. What the Democracy need is the use
of bis name. If he will go at the head of the
ticket solely as ft figurehead, the ticket of Sey
mour and Hendricks can be elected. Hen
dricks can carry Indiana. Such a ticket
would keep the South from breaking up, be
cause with the solid vote of the South there Is
no doubt of it) electio L The objtrct.on is
urged that Seymour is too old. Well, he is not
too old to be vot-d for, , The plan will be, iu
my judgment, that Seymour will consent to
act as a figarehea l, and that, if he is elected,
he will resign the office, and Hendricks will
become tbe president. With such an under
standing as this Hendricks will ran second.
People may laugh at this proro-ltlou now,
but tbe Demscrucy have cither got to come to
it or accept Grant." The tame authority says
that Seymour and Hendricks are very warm
friends; that tbe former has always been a
watro admirer of Hendricks, and will go into
such a scheme to try and save the Democrat io
ticket, if bis friend Hendricks la the ben
eficiary. RESUME OF THE WKEK'S NEWS.

Grant's Only Chance a Sectional Issue.
f New York Sun.l
We do not bap pose that any close ob
server of General Grant's whole public career

of eight years ardent'y desires to be presi
dent lor four, eight, it, year? longer to

lUccive any but tbe careless or the wilfully
blind.
Of lata it bss been made clearly apparent
that General Grant's determined plan of cam
paign Includes the acquisition to his support
of some portion of the Southern States. All
his recent conduct indicates this, lie not
only exhibit! particular satisfaction at the
receipt ot any attentions from lormer seces
sionists, but he has more than once ex
pressed sentiments toward the South in
s r. king contrast with tbe r-cant speeches of
Conklirg, Sherman, and Blaine. He de
clares that it ia our duty to avoid ail bitter

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Concluded from First Page.
need not be stated here In detail. It is ex
pected that the settlement of this difficulty
will lead to suob arraugementsas wlu prevent
farther hostile contact botween the Indians
and the border settlements in Western Colo
rado. Ike other disturbance occurred at the
Mescalero Agency, in New Mexico, where Vic
toria, the head ot a small baud of marauaers,
alter committing maiy atrocities, being vig
orously chased by a military force, mule bis
way across the Mexican border, and is noWou
foreign soil. .
White thee occurrences, In which a com
paratively small number of Indians were en
gaged, are most deplorable, a van majority of
our Indian population nave lully justified tbe
expectations of those who believe tnat by
humane and peaceful influences tbe Indian
can be led to aoandon tne baollaof savage lite
and to develop a capacity for useful ana civi
lized occupations. What they have already
accomplished in the purxuit of agricultural
and mechanical work, tbe remarkaole succera
which baa attended tbe experiment or em
ploying a f leighters a class oi lndiuna hither
to couuled among the wildest and moht lu
tractable, and trie general and urgent desire
exproiwed by them for the education of tnetr
cnnaren, may be taken aa snfUcieut
proof that they will be found ca
pable of accomplishing - much more
if they continue to be wisely and fairly guided.
Tne "Indian pulley" sketched in tbe report of
the secretary of the interior, the object of
which is to make liberal provision for tiic edu
cation of Indian youth, to settle the In
dians upon rarm lots In severalty, to give them
title iu lee to their farms, luallttnubie for a
certain number of year, and. when their
wanta are thus provlued for, to dispose by sale
of tbe lauds on tnetr reservations not occupied
and used by them, a lund Io be inrmed out of
tne proceeds for tbe benefit of the Indians,
which will gradually relieve the Uovernment
ot the expenses uow provkled lor by annual
appropriations, must commend itseif as just
aud beneficial to tbe Indiana, and as aim cal
culated to remove those obstructions which
tue existence of large reservation presents to
tbe settlement and development of the coun
t y. 1 therefore earnestly recommend tbe
enactmn of a law enabllug the Government
to give Indians a title in fee, inalienable fori)
years, to the farm land aijued to thetu by
uiloiuient. 1 aUo reueat tbe recnramendailou
made iu my first annual message, that a law.
oe pasMeu auimiung inuiaus wno can give
satisfactory proof of having, by their own
Kbor, supported their families for a number of
years, and who are willing to detach them
selves from their tribal relatlons.to the benefit
ot the homestead act, and to grant tbem pat
ents containing the mine provision of ina
llenab Illy for a certain period.
The experiment ot sending a number or In
dian children, of buth sexes, to the Hampton
Normal and Agricultural Institute, ia Vir
ginia, to receive an elementary English edu
cation and practical instruction iu farming
and other bsetnl industries, has Jed to re
sults so promising, tbat it was tbougbt expe
dient to turn over the cavaliy barracks at
Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to tbe Interior de
partment for the establishment of an Indian
acbool on a larger vcale. This school has now
li8 puplis, selected from various tribes, and is
in full operation. Arrangements are also
made for tbe education of a number of Indian
boys aud girls belonging to tilbes on tne Pa
cific slope, in a siintlar manner, at Forest
tirove, in Oregon. These institutions will
commend themselve to the liberality of Con
gress and to the philanthropic munificence of
the American people.
Last apriug lnformatiod was received or the
organization of an extensive -movement in tue
Westeru states, tbe object' of which was the
occupation by ununlliorizcd person's of cer
tain lands in the Indian Territory ceded by
the Cherokees to the Uovertimeat lor the pur
pose of settlement by other Indian tribes.
On the 24th of April I Issued a proclamation
warning all persons against participation la
such an at'empt, aud, by thecu-operaltono! a
military force, the invasion was promptly
checked. It Is my purpose to ptotect the
rlgbts of tbe Indian iubaoitants ot that Terri
tory to the full extent of tbe executive power.
But It would be unwise to IgDure tne fact that
a territory so large and ko fertile, with a popu
lation so sparse and wltu so great a wealth of
unusea resources, win oe louna more expotea
to me repetition or such attempts as happened
this year, when tbe surrounding S ate are
more densely settled, and the westward move
ment of our population looks still nioie eager
ly lor fresh lands to ccupy. Under uch clr
oumstances the difficulty of maintaining the
Indian Territory in its present state wilt
greatly increase, and the Indian tribes Inhab
iting It would do well to lire Dare for such a
contingency. I, therefore, fully approve of
the advice given to tnem ny ine secretary oi
the interior on a recent occasion, to divide
atuobg themselves in severalty as 'large a
quantity of their lands as tiiey can cultivate,
to acquire individual title iu fee, Instead of
th( ir present tribal ownership in common,
aud to consider In what manner 111 balance
of their lands may be disposed ot by-tbe Gov
ernment for their benefit. By adopting such
a policy tbey would more ecniiity secure for
thetutelvea the value of their DOi ssions, and
at the same time promote llielr progress iu,
civilization unit prosperity, man uy oueavnr.
Ing lo perpetuate the pieMtit state of things in
the Territory.
The question whether a cbaogo id the. con
trol of tbe Indian service should .be made,
was in the forty-fifth Congress referred to-a
joint committee of both Bouses lor inquiry
and report. In my last annual message 1 ex
pressed the hope that the decision of that
question, then in prospect, "would arrest
lurlher agitation of this Reinject, such agitation
being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon
tbe service aa well as tne Indians themselves."
Since then, the committee having reporwd,
the question baa b eu decided in llie negative
by a vote In tbe House ot Kepre-eutatlvea
For the reasons here stated, and lu view of
tbe fact that lurlher uncertainty on Ibis
point will be calculated to obstruct otbtr
much-needed legislation, to weaken the dis
cipline it tne service ana to unsettle salutary
measures now la progress lor the government
and Improvement of tha Indiana, I respect
fully recommend that tbe decision arrived at
by Congreas at its last session oe permitted lo
atand. . . .

My reoom menus Lions id iurm -"
are renewed In favor of enlarging the lacl It lea
of the department of agriculture. Agriculture
is the k-ading interest and tne perro-oent In
dustry or our people. It la to the abundance
of agricultural production, as cornpaied with
our home consumption, and toe largely in
pr..uvi .! hwhiv nrofltabie market abroad
which we bave enjoyed la recent years, that
we are mainly ludebted for our present
prosperity as a people. We trust look
for its continued maln'enance to -he same
substantial resource. There Is no branch of
Industry io which labor, directed by scientific
knowledge, yields such Increased prwdue ion
in comparison with unskilled labor, and no
branch or ihe public service to whlcb the en
couragement of libeial appropilatlons can be
turns ar. nn, nrlateiv extended. Tbe omission
to render such aid is not a wise economy: but,
on the contrary, ondoubttd y results In losses
of immense sums annually that mlaht be
saved through well dlreced t-frorta -by the
(Inn.Fms.st ll nmmiUS lull Vital iDfSmit '

It la ratifying to learn from tne oareao oi
m.h .hi S.wrfr to Which educational
privileges throughout the United State have
been aavanced auring the year. No more
iunaamentaiesponsibllltyresfsnpon Congress
than tbat of deviling appropriate measurea of
financial aid to education, supplemental to
local action in the States ana Terrl
toiies, and in Ihe District of Columbia. The
wise lorethougbt of tbe fonaders of our Gov
ernment has not only furnished the oasis for
the support of ibecomrnon school systems of
the newer States, but laid the foundations for
tbe maintenance of their Universities and
Colleges of Agriculture and the mechanic arts.
Measures In accordance with this traditional
policy for the further tenefit of all these in
terests, and tbe extension of the rame advan
tages to every portion of the country, it ia
hoped, will receive your favorable consider
all ton.
To preserve and perpetuate tbe national lit- '
erature should be among the foremost cures of
the national Legislature. Tne library gathered
at tbe Capitol st til leuains unprovided with
any suitable accommodations lor its rapidly
increasing stores. Tbe magnitude and
importance ,f the collection. Increased aa
It is by the deposits made under tbe law
of copyright, by domestic and foreign ex
changes, and by tbe scientific library of the
Bmithsonian Institution, call for building ac
commodations which shall be at once ade
quate and fire-proof. The location of such a
public building, which should provide for tbe
pressing necessities of tbe present, and lor tne
vast increase of tbe nation's bonks in tbe fa
ta re. ia a matter which addresses llaeir to the
discretion or Congress. It is earnestly recom
mended as a measure wbicb shonld unite all
suffrages, and which should no longer be de
layed. The joint commission created bytheact'of
Congrats or August 2, 1876, for tbe purpose'of
supervising and directing tbe con. plet ion of
the Washington National monument, cf
which commission the president is a member,
has given careful attention to this subject,
and already tbe atreuglneulng of tuefoouda- '
tlon has so far prngreKsed as lo lnsuie the en
tire suocestot this part of the work A massive
layer ot masonry has been introduced below
the original Icnnoation. widening the bse,
increaKiug the slaoillty of the structure, and
rendering it possible to carry Ihe shaft to com
pletion. It is earnestly recommended that
such further appropriations be made for tbe
continued prosecution of the work as may be
necessary fur the completion of this national
monument at an early day.
Iu former messages, impressed with tbe Im
portance or tbe subject, I bave taken occasion .
to commend to Congress llin adopt on of a
generous policy toward the District of Colum
bia. The report or the cotbtulsslonersor tbe
District, here a 1th transmitted, contains sug
gestlons aud recommendations, to all or which
1 earnestly Invite your careful attention. I
ask your early and favorable consideration of
the views which they ex press as lo the urgent
need of legislation for ine reclamation of the
marshes of the Potomac and its eastern bnuch
within the limits or tbe city, and lor the re
pair of tbe streets of tbe capital, heretofore
laid with wooden blocks, and now by decay
rendered almost impassabie. and a source of
Imminent danger to Ihe health of its citizens.
The means at the disposal of the commission
ers are wholly inadequate for tbe accomplish
ment of thee important woraa, and suould be
supplemented by timely appropriations from
the Federal trea.nry.
The filling of the flat in front of the city
will add to tne adjacent lands aud parks now
owned by the United Stales a large and valu
able domain, sufficient, it is thougot, to reim
burse Its entire cost, and will also, as an Inci
dental result, secure the permanent improve
ment of tbe river for tbe purposes of naviga
tion. The constitution having Invested Congress
with supreme and exclusive Jurisdiction over
the District of Columbia, its citizens must of
necessity look to congress alone for all need
ful legislation affecting their Interests; and as
the territory of this District la- tbe common
property or tbe people f the Ceiled States, '
wh'-, equally wli h Its resident cltiaena, are in
terested in the prosperity or their capital, I
can not doubt that yon will be amply sus
tained by the general voice of the country in
any measures you may adopt for this purpose.
I also invite tbe favorable consideration at
Courjress to the wanta ef the public scnools of
this District, as exhibited In the report of tbe
commissioners. Wbile Ihe number of pupils
is rapidly Increasing, no adequate provision
exists for a corresponding Increase ot school
accommodation, and the commissioners are
without Ibe means to n.eet thla uryeut need.
A number of the buildings now used for school
purposes are rented,, and are. In Important
particulars, ui.suit-d for the purpose. The
caue or popular education in tbe District of
Columbia Is surely enlK.ed (o tbe sameeonsld
eratton at the hands or tbeXa-iooal Govern
ment aa In I be several Stales and Territories,
to which- munificent grants or the public
lands bave been made for the endowment of
schools and universities.
