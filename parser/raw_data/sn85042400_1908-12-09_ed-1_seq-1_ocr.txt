was seat to Congress. In addition
the Speaker announced the appoint
ant of Kiggins of Connectitcut on the

time during the present ' Congress
there was a call of committees of the
House but no measure was reported
by any of them. Miscellaneous work
of the Senate consisted in the main
of reference In executive session of
about 1500 recess appointments which

bassador pointed out difficulties with
which th South has 1ras had to con
tend with since the Civil War.
President Roosevelt and President

of government bonds for the con
struction of permanent public im
provements to conserve natural re
sources of nation. President-elect
Taft presided, at Joint conservation

d advanced ground of the Democratic

Regulating Corporations.
As regards the great corporations
engaged In interstate busines and
especially the railroads, I can only re
peat what I have already again and
again said In my messages to the
Congress. 1 believe that under the
interstate clause of the Constitution
the United States hat complete and
paramount right . to control all sgen
cles of Interstate commerce, and 1
believe that the National Government
alone can exercUe, this right with
wisdom and effectiveness so as both
to secure Justice from, and to do Jus
tice to the great corporations which
are the most important factors in
modern business. I believe that it
Is worse than folly to attempt to pro
hibit all combinations as is done by
the Sherman anti-trust law, because
such a law can be enforced only Im
perfectly and unequally, and its en
forcement works almost as much
hardship as good. I strongly advocate
that Instead of an unwise effort to
prohibit all combinations, there shall
be substituted a law which shall ex
pressly permit combinations which
are in the interest of the public, but
shall at the same time give to some
agency of the National Government
full power of control and supervision
over them. One of the chief features
of this control should be securing en
tire publicity In all matte? which the
public has a right to know and furth-

conviction that a great future Is
about to dawn upon the South, James
Bryce, British ambassador, received a
notable ovation from the delegates in
attendance on the Southern Commer

ACCIDENT
Virginia, the occupants being hurled
beneath the car and pinioned there.
When they were extricated they were
apparently unconscious and bleeding
freely from Scalp wounds. The chauf
feur sustained bruised head and legs.
The accident was caused by the meet
ing with a young woman driving a
teams of horses. In crashing into the
girl, the chauffeur swerved the car to
the right, the front wheels of the
machine struck some obstruction, and
the force of the impact causing the
car to turn somersault.

TO THE VOTING PEOPLE OF ASTORIA, GREETING:
la the nam of civic righteousness and duty you are appealed to this day, to cast your votes for the redemp
tion of the city of Astoria from a course of municipal debt-building that must, sooner or later (and perhaps
sooner than any of you realise) reduce Astoria to very questionable and threatening conditions as to public
credit and property values, , . , .
. Every taxpayer, every businessman, every interested voter, must take a hand in straightening out and re
ducing the extraordinary pass to which the city has been brought through the reckless expenditures of the
party now in power; and it must be done today..
As is the invariable case, in prolonged leases of public authority and prestige, the men who have served
you for the past 12 years and more, have become extravagant, indifferent, and wantonly blind to the peril they
have set up, and die hour for Tebuking and readjusting is at hand! Will you use your undisputed faculty and
franchise, this day, in your own defense and that of your city? .
It is yours, as you shall find your duty to be after the exposition that has been made of the actual conditions
'and published to you broadly and frequently, in these columns, and after honest thought, either to continue the
program of wastefulness and mal-adminlstration or set up new and amendatory policies and agencies.' You alone
can cure the ill that hovers over you, None but you hold the responsibility for all that shall ensue if you
neglect the lesson end the opportunity at hand.
All that is sought is a fair, square, simple, business administration, directed to the economizing of Astoria's
resources, readjusting her policies and plans, and sparing her the further encroachment of a debt-burden now
almost annlhuativsl - .';-.,". .v.
ALL WE ASK IS THAT THESE MEN BE GIVEN AN UNTRAMMELED CHANCE TO SHOW
WHAT THEY CAM DO IN THIS CASE, TO RESTORE THE BALANCES THAT HAVE BEEN SO
WIDELY AND VICIOUSLY DISTURBED; IF THEY DO NOT FULFIL THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF
YOUR MISSION. AND THEIRS. THEN WILL REPUBLICAN ASTORIA TAKE THE SHEEREST RE
BUKE YOU HAVE TO OFFER!!! . v

contractors shall be held liable for
all damage irrespective of the ques
tion of the distances from places
damaged. The city attorney replied
to this by stating in effect that it
didn't make any difference if damage
was done by a little blast SO feet
away or by a big blast 500 feet away.
Yet the need of some Ordinance cov
ering blasting was apparently so keen
ly felt by the members of the council
that it was finally passed "with only
two dissenting votes.
Upon its face the ordinance seems
to be of great merit. It is evidently
drawn with the greatest care.
The importance of the measure will
be indicated when it is stated that
some men believe that most of the
bad slides in the city have resulted
from blasting, and all seem to agree
that the heavy blasting has at least
been a potent factor in the formation
of slides.
Under the new ordinance contrac
tors will be held to, the strictest ac

WASHINGTON, Dec. a -The
President today sent to the Senate the
name of John C. Young, private sec
retary to Senator Jonathan Bourne,
as'Postmaster at Portland.
Senator Fulton has requested the
committee on postofrks to withhold
action on the nomination of John C.
Young as postmaster at Portland. He
says he intends giving the citizens c t
Portland a chance to be heard in the
matter of Young's confirmation. If
protests are made a lively fight over
this nomination will follow.
, Senator Bourne is a member of the
postofflce committee, which gives him
some advantage, but Senatorial cour-
ftesy probably will enable Fulton to
block the confirmation during the eh
tire session.

The trouble occurred at 4 o'clock in
the afternoon while the streets were
crowded twith persons. While the
battle was in progress the participants
traversed the entire block, final stage
of flight being enacted directly across
the entrance to the police station.
Holt went to investigate the case of
an alleged abduction which had reach
ed him. Near the street corner he
came upon Sharp, who, surrounded
by companions, was exhorting to a
crowd of street loafers. With Sharp
were A. J. Selzer, a woman and five
children, ranging in age from 14 to 3.
The officer's suspicion were aroused
by the manner in which the woman
attempted to secure money contribu
tions from the crowd and Holt de
cided that she and her male compan
ions were not the proper persons to
have the custody of the small chil
dren. Holt asked the woman whose
children they were, and she told him
to mind his own business. ,
