TRANSFER OF VALUABLE LANDS
The Creveling-Van Dyck Property
Changes Hands.
Syndicat of Northera Capitalists
Thought to Have Purchased the
Point Peter Property Belief Is Tkai
Great icvclo)ineiit of the Business
Will Soon Occur.
An important "transfer of real estate
negotiations for which have bee in
progress for some time, waa consum
mated a day or two ago, and tile deeds
were filed for record yesterday. The
property that changes hands is that
recentiy owned by the Creveling-Van
Dyck Company, situated at the con
fluence of the Cape Pear river with
the North East branch, -well know as
tho strip of land called Point Peter.
The deed of transfer is made from
the Creveling-VanDyck Company to
ihe. WilmingTOn Savings and Trust
Co.. which is named as trustee in the
sale.
The deed is quite a lengthy one and
it recites that the sale is made with the
entire consent of all the stockholders
of the comijoiiy and authority is given
the president, Mr. John M. Creveling,
to dispose of all the property to the
. hest advantage and on the befit terms,
All rights in the property, including
real and personal, all the buildings
and their furnishings, the steamer
"Hope", lighters,. fiats, water privileges,
iitc, go with the sale to the new own
ers. The price named in the deed is
$1009 and other valuable consideration,
and while it is not possible to stare
what the total amount was, it is known
that the consideration was a large one
and thoroughly satisfactory to inter
ested iarties.
Efforts to find out the identity of the
new owners were not successful last
night, but it is reported on good au
thority that the purchase was mado on
behalf of some northern capitalists,
who, it is expected, will enlarge the
plant and continue the operations1 on
n more, extended scale, The plant
manufactured exceaekw, and its equip
ment was very complete.
The property is advantageously
placed for such an enterprise and with
,tho increased facilities which it is
expected will soon be installed, this
enterprise will be regarded as one of
the most important in this section.
NOT NOW TO ENLARGE JAITi.
lcei.sion of County Coinmfssioi
Results of Proposed Recorder's
Court l'irst to ! Investigated.
The county commissioners met yes
terday afternoon to take action in re
gard to the proposals that have been
mibniitted fr the work of repair and
enlargement of cell space in the coom
Jty jaM, action having been postponed
From a session held tho previous day.
It will be recalled that the Leitner
tind Wilkins firm of architects of this
city had prepared plans by which much
wasted pace in the jail could be util
ized and more 'cell room provided with
out elarging"tho jail building. They
also have prepared plans fcr improved
sanitation, plumbing and heating.
The commissioners decided that in
View of the probable enactment by the
next legislature of a recorder's court
for Wilmingtou, which is expected to
result in the great reduction of the
number of prisoners that would be con
fined in the jail, that they would delay
action on the proposed extension of the
cell capacity for the present until the
results of that court are known.
Hence to this end, the following reso
lution was unanimously adopted.
"Resolved, that in view of the prob
able establishment of a recorder's court
and the resultant reduction of the num
ber of inmates of the jail, that for the
present the proposed cell work be post
poned until the results of the operation
of tho recorder's court is known, but
the commissioners proceed to ar
range for improved sanitation, plumb
ing, heating, painting and construction
repairs to the building.
CARNIVAL IN FULL BLAST.
Immense Crowds Throng the Carnival
(.rounds All the Shows are Said to
Jm Fine.
Immense crowds of merrymakers
thronged the carnival gorunds last
night and up to a late tour there were
large numbers patronizing all the tent
ed shows.
Very favorable comment was heard
on all sides as to the attractiveness of
the various shows, all of which are do
ing a tremendous business.
The Eagles have worked faithfully to
guarantee a week of enjoyment to their
friends and they feel gratified at the
auspicious start that has been made.
The shows were opened early yester
day afternoon and they gave contin
uous performances until a late hour
last night. The street on which the
carnival is situated were blocked with
a merry, good nature! crowd, each per
son seemingly vieing with the other in
having a good time.
All the shows are- said to be good
ones, and the company is praised for
being one of the best that has ever
exhibited in this. city.
A. sufficient number of police has
been, detailed to 'duty on the carnival
grounds andjperfect order is assured at

SPECIAL MESSAGE
President Roosevelt's Viw

That Island.
Praises its Beauty ami Fertility ami
Progress Made Under its ITcsent

Education Noteworthy Ilapitf Pro
greH Made in the Culture of Sugar
Cane and Tobacco Recommends
That Full American Citizenship
Should be Conferred Fpon the Porto
Hicaus.
Washington. Dec. 11. The presi
dent's message to congress giving the
result of hi3 recent observations in
Porto Rico and making recommenda-
tions concerning the government of
that island was delivered to the sen
ate today. It was read at length and
received careful attention. The mes
sage was as follows:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives: On November 21, 1 visited the is
land of Porto Rico, landing at Ponce,
crossing by the old Saniah read by
Cayey to San Juan, and returning next
morning over the new American road
from Arecibo to Ponce; the scenery
was wonderfully beautiful, especially
among the mountains of the interior,
which constitute a veritable tropic
Switzerland. I could not embark at
San Juan because the harbor has not
been dredged out and can not receive
an American battlesnip. I do not
think this fact creditable to us as a
nation, and I earnestly hope that im
mediate provision will e made for
dredging San Juan harbor.
I doubt whether our people as a
whole realize the beauty and fertility
ct Porto Rico, and the progress that
has been made under its admirable
government. We have jusi cause for
pride in the character of our repre
sentatives who have administered the
tropic islands which came under our
flag as a result of the war with Spain;
and of no one of them is this more
true than of Porto Rico. It would be
impossible to wish a more faithful, ti
more efficient and a more disinterest
ed public service than that now be
ing rendered in the island of Porto
Rico by those in control of the insular
government.
I estopt at a dozen torns all told, and
one of the notable features in every
town was the gathering of the school
children. The work that nas been done
in Porto Rico for education has been
noteworthy. The main emphasis, as
is eminently wise and proper, has
been put upon primary education; but
in addition to this there is a normal
school, an agricultural school, three
industrial and three high schools.
Every effort is being made to secure
not only the benefits of elementary
education to all the Porto Ricanii cf the
next generation, but also as lar as
means will permit to train them so S
that the industrial, agricultural and
commercial
can be

native Porto Ricans, were devoted to

regiment of troops must be appro

estly hope that this oody will be
kept permanent. There should cer
tainly be troops in the island, and it
is wise that these troops should be
themselves native Porto Ricans. It
would be from every standpoint a
mistake not to perpetuate this regi
ment. Tn traversinsr the island even the
tvc mrenn- ciirvw Ipavrs the be-
holder struck with the evident rapid j
growth in the culture both of the j
sugar cane and tobacco. The : fruit in- j
dustrjr ts also growns. Last j ear was
the most prosperous year that the is- '
land has ever known before or since
the American occupation. The total
of exports and imports of the island
was forty-five millions of dollars as
against eighteen millions in iyui. mib .

290,322 pounds of coffee of the value of j
$3,481,102. Unfortunately, what used j
to be-Porto Rico's prime crop coffee;
has1 not shared thia prosperity. It
has never recovered from the disaster ; Mr. W. L. DeRosset, Jr.. of Fayette

benefit of throwing open our market
to it has not compensated for the loss
inflicted by the closing 01 the markets
to it abroad. I call your attention to
the accompanying memorial oa this
subject, of the Board or Trade of San
Juan, and" I earnestly hope that some
measure will be taken for the benefit
of the excellent and high grade Porto
Rican coffee.
In addition to delegations from the
Board of Trade and Chamber of Com
merce' of San Juan, I also received
delegations from the Porto Rican Fed
eration of Labor, and from the Coffee !
Growers assciatkm.
There is a matter to which I wish
to call your special attention, and that
is the dasirabilitv of conferring full
American citizenship upon the people
of Porto Rico. I most earnestly hope !
that this will be done. I can not see i
how any hurra can possibly result
from it, and it seems to me a matter
of right and justice to the people of
Porto Rico. They are oyai, they ate
glad to be under our flag, they are J
making rapid progress along the path
of orderly liberty-. Surely we should
show our appreciation cf them, our
pride in what they have done, and our
pleasure in extending recognition for
what has thus been done, by granting j
them full American citizenship. I
Under the wise administration of !
the present governor and. council, j
marked progress has been made in j
the difficult matter of granting to the j
people of the island the largest meas-
lire of self-government that can witn .
safety be given at the present time. It j
would have been a very serious mis- t
take to have gone any raster than we
have already gene ia tnis direction.
The Porto Ricana have complete and
absoultp autonomy in all their muni
cipal governments, the only power J
over them possessed by the insular
government being that of removing
corruption or. of incompetence such as
ficials. This power has never been
exercised save on the clearest proof of
corruption or of incmp?r-ence- such as
to jeopardize thd interests of the peo
ple of the island; and under such cir
cumstances it has- been fearlessly used
to the immense benefit of the people.
It is not a power with which it would
be safe for the sake of the island it
self, to dispense at present. The low
er house is absolutely elective, while
the upper house Is appointive. This
scheme is working .wall; no injustice
of any kind results from it, and great
benefit to the inland, and it should
certainly not be changed at this time.
The machinery of the elections is ad
ministered entirely by the Porto Rican
people themselves, the governor and
council keeping only such supervision
as ia necessary in order to insure an
orderly election. Any protest as to
electoral frauds is settled in the
courts. Here again it would not be
safe to make any change in the prej
ent system. The election.) this year
were absolutely orderly, unaccoinpan
oed by any disturbance; and no prr-

agement of the elections, anno turee
contestaiare! threatened wnere the man
jorities were very small and error was
claimed; the contests, of course, to
be settled in the courts. In short, the
governor and council are cooperating
with all of the most, enlightened and
most patriotic of the people of Porto
Rico in educating the citizens of the
island in the principles of orderly lib
erty. They are providing a govern
ment, based upon each citizen's self
respect, and the mutual respect of all
citizens; that is, based upon a rigid
observance of the principles of justice
and honestly. It bas not been easy to
instil into the minds of people unac
customed to the exercise of freedom,
the two basic principles of our Ameri
can system; the principle that the ma
jority must rule, arid the principle
that the minority haa rights which
must not be disregared or trampled
upon. Yet 'real iprograss has been
made in having these principles ac
cepted as elementary, as the founda
tions of successful self-government.
All the insuiar gvernment should be
nlaced in one bureau, either in the de
partment of war or the department o

( Special to The Messenger.
Roeky Mount, N. C, December 11
The man who had not seen Rocky j
Mount in ten years, yes, even five j
years, might have had his doubts about :
her ability to take into her homos more
than 300 visitors for a week, and not
be crowded, but she has done it ami
(wild have done more. The North
Carolina conference of the Methodisr
church, south, comes as near filling up
any town as any religious body that j
migrates, and when a town can take
care of it she can be put down in the
right hand column.
Many of us were surprised and grati
fied to find so progressive and hustling
a place as this has proven to be. With
lights, water, sewers, fire department,
graded schools, she has a foundation on
which to build and js building the equal
of anything in eastern North Carolina.
On all sides there are going up business
houses that would do credit to a city,
and her homes are as pretty as 'tis
possible to have them, and, best of all,
they stood wide open to the conference j
and dealt out that old hospitality cf
which one hears so much in former j
i days. j
The session of the Western confer- j
ence at Mt. Airy in November was i
fortunate in having such a champica
of high table living as Mr. A. H.
Merritt, whom so many of this body
know and revere, but Rocky Mount
did not need any body more than she
haa to make a conference at horn and
want to stay longer.
ThQ new First Methodist church,
which was finished early in the year at
a cost of $21,000, is as near ideal as it
is possible to have such and every
thing in and about it is new, bright,
clean, and up-to-date. The fresco work
inside by that artist, Mr. Milch, sent
out by the Reuben Rink Painting and
Decorating Co.. is a job that is. to bo
modern, simply a dream. One can al
most see the dew on the Marechal" Niel
roses on the ceiling of the ladies parlor.
Rev. W. S. Rone, the pastor, Rev. R.
B Hunt, pastor of North and South at- yt
rjsK 'Z SMsf sil Canmea Gooos,
committees made ideal hosts. Tht roll
pearly every member present than any
session in years, all the more credit to
Rocky Mount,
To me there is something wide op?n
and attractive about a town whose
railroads "split it wide open in tho
center" as it does here, with wide
street on either side mul thf-Tirin. ml
. t, ( .
bns-,inesr, houses, nnd hntols f.-seinir 1hi?.i
wide avenue. One gets a good view in
passing and every body can see every
body else from his own wrorking place.
The many passing trains of tho At-
! lantic Coast Line make something
doing much of the time.
The conference as a whole, is gl;d
it came here, the people were deligbted
with their visitors generally, and they
parted with only love and good feeling
one for the other.
The next session of the conference
goes to New Bern and the gathering
I there next year will also be marked
with as hanDV homes no doubt as thc-:e
, Gf the progressive and enterprising,
j sunny town of Rocky Mount.
