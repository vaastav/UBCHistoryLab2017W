MEMBERS OF ASSOCIATED PRESS.
THE GOVERNMENT AS AN EDU
CATOR.
St. Louis Globe-Democrat: To an
extent not even remotely approached
by any other country the United
States Government discloses its oper
ations and its interests to its own
people and to the world. Within the
past few days the annual reports of
the secretary of the navy and of the
heads of other departments and the
chiefs of bureaus have been publish
ed. On Tuesday the president's mes
sage was presented to congress, and
on the day following congress will
get the annual report of the secre
tary of the treasury.
Here is a mass of literature which,
in volume and in minuteness of de
tail, far surpasses that presented by
any other government. Except the
message by Mr. Cleveland in 1887,
which dealt with one subject only,
the tariff, all the annual messages of
the past quarter of a century have
spread themselves over many col
umns ofr the newspapers, and have
touche«aJfti every topic in which gov
ernmf-ejit \s had any concern. Some
fta,evelt,s annual communi-
18
coQalned almost as many
as
a
j3 in the average book of
or\iW pages.
Every subject in which and consid
erable number of Americans have any
intelligent interest is discussed at
this time every year by the presi
dent and by the heads of the various
-executive departments and their sub
divisions. The chances for obtaining
a liberal education in the operations
and interests of this government as
it touches every other country, are
thus within reach of every American.
This information is .spread before the
whole world. He who runs may
read. These disclosures deal candid
as well as comprehensively with
the things that they concern them
selves with. They extenuate nothing
and they set naught down in malice.
JM)T A SENSATIONAL DOCUMENT.
The message of President Taft to
'congress is not sensational, not alar
mist, and deals sensibly and fairly
w'ith the public matters now before
-the people of this country. He de
votes a good share of it to the rela
tions of this nation with foreign
countries, and it is a matter for con
gratulation that, except for the Ni
caragua incident, our relations with
all powers are peaceful and amicable.
With reference to the sugar scandal,
Jt Is suggested that congress do not
by a too sudden entrance into the
field of investigation handicap the of
ficials of the department of justice
who are now probing the question.
The tariff is to be given a chance to
'speak for itself through a fair trial,
and it seems probable that public
opinion with reference to it may
change sensibly, when the effect of
the country so far as its rates were
concerned, might have the undesir-
able effect of reducing employment
and closing business concerns and
fcctosl^s. We are legislating now
for ait immense country, and we
most take Into consideration the
needa of all parts of it.
The tone of the president's message
is temperate, and he appreciates the
constltntionsl provision that the con
gress has the duty of legislation. It
is for the president to call to the at-
,„ .. dertake to secure specimens In dup
tfae bill become apparent. No tariffs
,.* .* *. tion of the stock being detained in
might exactly suit a great share of|
to its work, and to execute the laws
that are passed.
The forthcoming resignation of
Col. C. W. Mott, the immigration
agent of the Northern Pacific road,
removes another of the conspicuous
figures in the development of the
northwest. Fortunately, Col. Mott,
after a rest for a time, will resume
his activities in some other field, and
the benefit of nis efforts will not fee
lost to the cause of immigration. Col.
Mott is one of the old time boomers
for the section of the country along
the Northern Pacific road. With the
late Max Bass, formerly immigration
agent of the Great Northern, he has
been concerned with the settlement
of North Dakota through the immi
gration departments of the Great
Northern and Northern Pacific roads.
He has prepared and issued much
of the literature that has been circu
lated by the Northern Pacific road,
and his field has been a wide one,
extending from the terminals of the
road at Duluth and St. Paul clear to
the Pacific coast, and the mines, for
est and fruit lands of Washington
and Oregon. At the various immi
gration meetings and agricultural
gatherings, Col. Mott has always been
a ready and timely speaker. He was
at Bismarck four or six years ago,
when the state made its first appro
priation for the attracting of immi
gration to this section, and his coun
sel and advice were of value to the
legislators who were preparing the
bill. It is to be hoped that his re
tirement from the immigration field
is only temporary and that when he
returns to the work it will be in the
same northwest, to whose growth and
prosperity he has been so valuable
and effective a contributor.

Uncontrollable urination (especially
at night), smarting, offensive and
discolored water an 1 other bladder
misery ends.
The moment you suspect kidney or
urinary disorder, or feel any rheu
matism, begin taking this harmless
medicine, with the knowledge that
there is no other remedy, at any
price, made anywhere else in the
world, which will effect so thorough
and prompt a cure as a fifty-cent
treatment of Pape's Diuretic, which
any druggist can supply.
it is needless to feel miserable and
worried, because this unusual prepar
ation goes at once to the out of or
der kidneys and urinary system, dis
tributing its cleansing, healing and
strengthening influence directly upon
the organs and glands affected, and
completes the cure before vou real

Your physician, pharmacist, banker,
or any mercantile agency will tell you

Cincinnati, is a large and responsi
ble concern, thoroughly worthy of
your confidence.
Only curative results can come
from taking Pape's diurectic, and a

"I have worked seven years to grow
the best ear of corn in the world,"
said Mr. Palin. "Its parent stock
consisted of Reed's Yellow Dent and
Alexander Gold Standard. We plant
ed two rows of one and then two
rows of the other, cutting off the tas

first two years. This gave us the
seed from which the best ear of corn
In the world was grown."
