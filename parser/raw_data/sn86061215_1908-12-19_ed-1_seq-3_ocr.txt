A STRENUOUS FINISH.
It's a quiet day these times when
President Roosevelt does not figure in
some new sensation. There is no
slacking of the pace as the end of the
strenuous executive's administration
draws near. Just now the president is
sitting back after his latest appear
ance In the arena and is waiting for
the heads he has hit to bob up again.
There is a suspicion lurking, too,, that
the president will have a new club
ready, when the. heads get .within
10There
was• the president's reference'^
to the editors of the New York Sun
and Indianapolis News and his
scourging of Publisher Pulitzer of the
World when he was drawn into the
controversy. Pulitzer is back with a
spirited rejoinder and meanwhile the
senate is preparing to investigate
part .of the president's message rela
tive to congressional interference with
the work of the secret service, and to
investigate another part, of the mess
age referring to the Brownsville casa.
The publishers who have bumpe.l
into the big stick and the ant.io-Roose
velt members of the senate are declar
ing.that the president has violated ev
ery precedent in the game, and that
even the king of England would have
to quit the throne if he went to the
Roosevelt limit, but it is plain that
the Rooseveltian critics are trying to
keep out or range of the big stick
when they make their talks.
President Roosevelt has organized
an Ananian club and has stocked
w-ell witi. members. He has been at
tacked before, but usually he has had
the last word. Most people will wait
until they see just what the president
has concealed up his sleeve before
they venture the opinion that the pres
ident will come out second best in any
of his latest battles now pending. On
past performances he is easily the one
best fret" and-his backers will continue
to play him as the favorite until a head
is found that he can't crack.
Jt*.--. A RAILROAD MAN'S VIEWS.
Melville E. Ingalls. chairman of the
hoard of the Big Four railroad, is an
advocate of the profit sharing plan
between emloyers and employes as a
panacea for industrial troubles. Mr.
Ingalls is not. prepared to say just
"what plan would give the best re
sults, but one method he advocates
Is for the railroad companies
and large corporations to take the
cost of the property, then the amount
of wages paid, and, after the wages
are paid and the interest on the prop
erty is paid, to divide the balance
among the employes in proportion of
the earning power of each as told in
manifold. The employe becomes more
careful of his own account., strikes
are eliminated, while labor agitators
are bowled over by the advance in mg of
his mild plan of prac-:*!.:«
tical socialism.
Trade agreements. Mr. Ingalls ad
mits are an acknowledgment of the
popuiarity of.this, mild plan of pracjnavlgatio„(
rights and obligations of the workers,
but',, he eaya, capital owes its labor
mor(e than 'a mere bow. The profit
sharing plan, he believes, is a warm,
friendly outstretched hand and is
going..to supplant the trade agree
ment.. "Make .every man your
partner," he concludes, and then
there,is the perfect relation we should
have between employer and employe.
POPULARIZING PSYC O LO GY.
Thus far the study of psychology
has-been confined largely to the high
^.brows. Most of us have heard somo
'i ^hing about' it just as we have heard
Kof archaelogy and several oth
flogies. without being moved out of
jie "what's'the use" frame of mind.
[Ow, however, Professor Hugo Muen
jterberg, the Harvard psychologist,
JKas made the matter a little clearer.
He says, for instance, that applied
psychology could determine who would
play a good game of poker. The pro
fessor did not elucidate, as he evident
ly.did not feel the need of fessing up
the extent of his knowledge of the
ime. He rather implied, though, that
psychologist., sitting in a game,
ould know when innocently sizing up
jiis flush whether his opponent's con
fident expression indicated that he
had a full to beat or just a measly
I Btraight, or a punk set of threes.
If the professor just goes a little
further In his efforts to popularise
psychology, he will make it the popu
lar fireside study. If a little delving
into the pschyics would put Mary wise
to the fact that John is about to pop
the question, she would have time to
prepare herself for the proper look of
surprise, and she would know just

then give that hand painted dish to

FARM LOSS ENORMOUS.
Ihe farmers of the I'nited States lose eacli year in soil
washed from their land enough to pay the entire expenses of
the national government at Washington, declared Congress
man J. I. Atkins of Louisiana in an address before
the Congressional Red River Improvement association at Deu
ison, lexas. Mr. W atkius made a stroug plea for forest preser
vation and waterway improvement and advanced some start
ling figures regarding the rate at which the national resources
are being exhausted.
Iiom the soil which is washed from tlio land and the
caving of the river banks one billion tons of silt accumulate
in our river beds annually," he said. '"This soil is the most
tertile part of the land and it is worse than wasted. It is not
onh lost lot all practical purposes, but forms an impediment
ot navigation in making sand-bars, catching logs and filling up
the channel of the stream often causing it to go entirely dry.
""While millions of dollars' worth of levees have caved and
waslied into the livei, this does not constitute the main expense
ot this soil wash. It is usually the virgin soil which first
washes into the streams. This virgin soil usually produces
more abundantlv than commercial fertilizers. If commercial
fertilizers are worth .$20.00 per ton and we should estimate this
soil which is washed off of the land at the same value, we see
that there is lost twenty billion dollars every year. If the value
should be divided by twenty the loss would still I* one billion

passed, ft becomes necessary for each land owner to conserve
every possible way all the land which he owns.
One ot the great pioblems before the .American people
today is the 'Conservation of Our National Resources.'
In solving thes-.' problems the quesfioii of reservoirs at the head
waters ot our streams will play an important part. When
these reservoirs are constructed the ativam flow will be so regu
lated as to enable the marsh lauds to be the in or*' readily drain
ed. That these lands will eventually lie reclaimed there can be
110 doubt, as it is eviJmt that our population will increase to

I he water courses of this i-o mtu are capable of produc
mg energy sufficient to generate thirty, million horse, power of
electrical force. This force can distributed over the entire
area of this country. When our amber is exhausted for the
purposes of fuel and cur coal we mu-t look to our
streams to supply our motive power in the form of electricity
with which to propel our engin and furnish light and heat,
and while our forests are being renewed we must look to our
vanishing supply of iron to perform manv of those function*

The Illinois supreme court has up
held the legislative act which "indem
nifies the owners of property for dam
ages occasioned by mobs and riots,"
and this decision may prove costly to
the city of Springfield, the scene of
the race riots of several months ago.
Following the riots, damage suits ag
gregating $100,000 were filed against
the city by property owners who sus
tained loss through the work of the
mobs. Th° supreme court decision
will doubtless be made much of by
plaintiffs in these cases as going to
prove the city's liability.
Springfield's debauch is likely to
have a gloomy morning after. Prob
ably there were few property owners
in the riots that resulted in lynch
ings, arson and bloodshed, but if
damages are proved against the city
by the residents whose properties
were wrecked, all ihe property owners
will be taxed their share of the sum
necet-sary to make good the property
losses.-

editor of this paper needs bread with
his shoes on: he needs bread with his

from W. A. Sunday's
last prayer in Ottumwa.

The three hours spent by Evangel
ist W. A. Sunday last.
his final appearance here, was chamber of death—tlier
city,
entirely characteristic of the man and
his tireless energy. Arriving on Bur
lington No. 1 at 8:12 o'clock, he was
immediately driven to the tabernacle,
and as soon as ho reached the plat
form, began upon a brief but. vicious
attack upon the saloon business This
was followed by a powerful
and a sweeping prayer, after which
fifty-two- new converts came forward
and.gripped the hand of the evangel
ist. Heading the collection for the
American Home Finding association,
with $100, the evangelist urged nil
others to support, the institution in the
future more consistently. He left on
Burlington No. 2 at 11:20 o'clock, for
Chicago.

On Saloon Question.
Mr. Sunday then devoted sonic
fifteen or twenty minutes to another
heated denunciation of the saloons of
Ottumwa. His arguments writhed
with their usual force and vehemence
and he cited a number of statistics
and stories showing (ho evil and
crime originating from tue effects of
liquor. He thanked the men who has
signed the petition and urged all
others to put their name on the pa
per. When he had finished a number
of petitions were carried through the
audience and manv more names were
added to the already large list of
men wishing to drive the saloons from
the citv.
.John Hahn, tor years a saloon keep
er in the city, was then introduced by
Rev. R. J. LoeKe as one who, con
