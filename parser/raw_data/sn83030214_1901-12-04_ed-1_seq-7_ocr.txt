London. Dec 4. 1 a. m.-.Vo portion of the
lessTs Message is more cordially approved
/here than that referring to the question of
° n treatment of anarchists. It i? considered
- ■■iingiy gratifying that President Roosevelt
' ul( j nO i be jifrai.l to make proposals, which
'the surface are open to the criticism that
c ' are subversive of personal liberty in the
-alter of opinion. In this country there is a
onP undercurrent of feeling against laws
5 4ch permit and actually encourage the immi
•Jon ■>' foreign anarchists. London, espe
., i;v f ( els strongly on the point, and owing to
!i f vast number of undesirable aliens who have
ÜB.am lhelr abod^ in the Ea!?t End. the me "
nofr would gladly welcome any restrictive
» jbt^s Ir reference to the proposal that
-jskind should bind itself together to make
pjrehy. like piracy, a crime against the law
» nati'T.'- it is pointed out that the difficulty
« to define what anarchy consists of and to
obtain trustworthy evidence against those hold
j-r such a doctrine before they commit overt
.(•j which would render them amenable to or
'aerv criminal law.
To-day's newspapers refer to the important
- sw •- rnshli HI Roosevelt's first' Message to
-.ju^ress. some of them characterizing it as a
■aaatilEsbre document. Upon the whole, how
ever, it is regarded as essentially a conservative
Etatenient of policy, especially in reference to
f acrt matters as trusts and reciprocity. The
President's remarks on the latter question are
not deemed to be an adequate execution of the
views expressed in President McKlnley's last
speech at Buffalo, and the British hopes of the
decisive modification of the protectionist system
of the United Stites are consequently disap
pointed. It is noted with satisfaction that the
istinsian canal negotiations have been conduct
si as the friendliest manner, and it is left to the
Opposition newspapers to ask what concessions
has the British Empire secured in return for
the ajsiTfaS of England's claims. The language
cf the Mesage on the subject of the Monroe
Doctrine Is spoken of as uncompromising in its
directness. "The world is." says "The Stand
ard." "practically warned that the Western
Hemisphere is not to be made a field for terri
torial ambition or aggression from outside."
This." it is added, "was no doubt Monroe's
meaning, and it is now reasserted in the most
definite terms." No objection is raised to the
precise terms in which the doctrine is enun
ciated, but th«=y are evidently not rol
ishri. and it Is suggested that some of the
eu?r?y devoted to expanding and repeating the
famous doctrine might 1- spared, since there
is little desire on the part of any foreign power
to extend the area of militarism to the New
World.
The sinking of the torpedo boat destroyer

Close upon sixty claims of vices to be per
foraed at the coronation of King Edward have
been submitted fcr consideration to the Court of
CJairr.s, which m;ets in the Privy Council cham

claims is that of the Duke of Norfolk, as Lord
cf the Workshop, to present a pair of gloves
10 the sovereign, and to bold the sceptre with
the cross while the peers do homage. Besides
this special claim, the duk-=>, in the right of th-
Earldom of Arundel. claims the office of butler

TIIK XKW DEMOCRATIC MOSES WILL HAVE TROUBLES OF HIS OWN.
CROKER TO SHIFT BURDENS
WEARY OF TASK OF LEADERSHIP, HE
WILL TAKE A BEST.
TO GO ABROAD EARLY NEXT YEAR—CAR
ROLL LIKELY TO BE LEFT IN CHARGE—
WHAT THE BOSS SAYS OF SHEPARD
AND GOVERNORSHIP NOMINATION.
Richard Croker. after a month of reflection, yes
terday grade known bis ideas about the landslide
of November 5 which swept Tammany out of
power. He gave an extended Interview at the
Democratic dub, in the course of which he ex
plained Tammany's defeat, outlined Tammany's
future and dealt with his own personal plans gen
erally. While not announcing In so many words
that he woull retire from the leadership- of Tam
many Hall, he Indicated that at an early date
he would make an arrangement by which he would
share the c in - of leadership with others, if he did
not shift the responsibility to other shoulders en
tirely. The Tammany executive committee meets
next month to reorganize for the year, and at this
me ting Croker will make his ideas known. : "r,>k-T
dropped into a chair •■ the Democratic Club and
gazed quizzically at a Tribune reporter, who asked
him if he had finally determined to retire as leader
of •:. Tammany organization. Then he sal I slow
'■Well. I don't think I will do muoh more leading
m the future. I am getting old and worn out. I
cannot be a wheel horse for everybody any longer.
I admit that the leader of Tammany Hall should
stay in New-York all the year, and actively look
after the interests of the organization. I cannot
afford to remain here for even the greater part of
the year. My health la poor, and it is the rest
abroad that enables me to recuperate for what
work 1 am able to do here. if I remained in New-
York all the year 1 would be unable to do any
work at all. I knew i: was wrong for me to go
away, but I had to do it to save my life. I suffer
a great deal from catarrh and from my stomach,
and 1 need the rest and recreation badly. It Is
simply Impossible for me to remain here and work
any loeger. I have done more work since the
election than I did in the course of the campaign."
HOW POLITICIANS REGARD- IT.
The politicians generally took this to mean yes
terday that Croker had determined to step down
and out. It is well known that on election night
Croker wanted to resign and get out He was per
suaded by Senator Timothy I. Sullivan and others
to reconsider. Croker is a wealthy man. As
Tammany expresses it. be has "made his pile," and
has it salted away. He is tired of the strife and
turmoil, and wants to turn the organization over to
others ard have a. good time. Who his successor
will be no Tammany man dares say. There are two
factions in the organization. The most powerful
is the so-called gambling "combine." which dic
tated nominations on trie county ticket last cam
paign. The other is what is called the respectable
ri*-m«T.t. It is belie < that the gambling "com
bine" will dictate the naming of Mr. Croker's suc
cessor. That Croker will get out absolutely no
Tammany man believes. They say Croker is al
ways a "quitter" in the hour of trouble. He wants
to "play" for the nt-xt two years, and he can
afford to do so. When he thinks Tammany Ims a
chance to get back Into power they Bay i "roker
will -, ■ mur- srab control. jt!-=t as he wrested it
from John C Sbeehan In 1897. Croker's retire
ment they add. is Just a plan to lei Tammany
■weather its own hard season. Croker is a fair
we.-ther '.■■;■ nd, ami can be expected to hold out his
hand hungrily whenever Tammany is In power or
about to come into power. It is generally believed
that John K. Carroll will tv In charge of thi»
organization while Croker Is away. In fact, the
executive committee at the meeting to be held next
mont:: may go so far aa to name him formally as
leader; but all the time It will be know thai
<"r<iker is standing in the- background; with his
shadow blanketing the whole organization, and
ready to return and take control whenever I here Is
anything to be accomplish* d by it.
As to the State organization. Croker said: "I see
that the newspapers .:•■ saying that i want to
dominate the State organization, and that 1 am try-
Ing to dictate a. new national platform. That is
sheer rot 1 am in no physical shape to do any
kind of leading, but I Shall always have Tam
many's interest at heart and advise as best 1 can.
1 don't know who will succeed to the management
of the organization. That will develop later. All
1 know is that I shall go to Europe in January or
February, and remain there for some tsm>-."
Croker spoke of Devery. saying: "If the charges
which have been made against D. very are true, he
either ought to be In jail or hanged. But, mind you,
these charges have never been proved. The oppo
nents of Mr. I >every had every opportunity to
prove their charges; they bad the District Attor
ney's office: but they did not do so I believe
Devery to be an able and efficient Chief of Police.
I am not defending Devery or any one else; but I
like to See fair play."
DUE TO THE NEWSPAPERS.
Croker then said, among other things: "it Is
useless to inquire into the causes of our defeat
last month. One cause was sufficient— the apposi
tion of all the newspapers in New-York to Tam
many Hall. A? things were, the Republicans
could have put up a ticket of their own and won
out Their Democratic support amounted to little.
The Greater New-York Democracy could have
been dispensed with easily. it was simply im
possible to win with the.v'h"' 0 press of New-York
against us The charges against Tammany reached
all the people: our defence was heard by only a
few. That is the whole story."
Reverting to the State leadership question, I ro
ker said- "It Is silly to make a Sight on the lead
ership. " I don't care who poses as state leader
1 don't want the Job. and l don't see why anybody
should hanker after it. At this time, all Demo
crats should be engaged in uniting against the com
mon enemy and not in promoting selfish ambitions.
it is nonsense too/ to begin at this time to talk
about Democratic candidates for Governor next
'.ear Let the party get together tlrst.
'As to Tammany's future. Croket said: "Some
Mugwumps are talking about Tamrn lr.y going to
niece- Nonsense, Tammany will be stronger
than ever two years from now. a defeat once in
a while I* a good thing for any organization After
the "unionists have been In office a couple of years,
th* people will see that the Tammany admnistra-
Ll,-,'L 1 ,-,' not such a bad thing aft. all. We have
been downed before by reform movements, and we
always rose up stronger than ever after a few
*™" It will be the same story in 1903. Tarn;
many is close to the common people of New-York.
to referring to England, he added: .'I have been
annoyed for years by the newspaper talk about my
being an Englishman at heart. It Is all rot. I
am a New-Yorker, and an American all through.
f Tive in England a part of the year solely for the
iVkJ- of m health. I keep race horse* because I
fov.- them "and promote my health by looking after
them If f had not taken to banes and open air
life in England I would not be alive to-day.
Mr Croker was asked about the report that fid
v-*ird M Shepard was in a sense to become the legal
ndviVr -of Tammany: that be was to draft platforms
nnd advise its policy, and in ret.u-n be supported
i " the Croker-Murphy-McLaughlin-Mack corn
line for Governor next year and become the State
.ader Mr. Croker said: "There is nothing in that.
Fhepard^oes not want such a position. He is not
in politics. Mr. Shepard la an able man. He Is a
eood -nan and expresses his views like any one
ftae but * the odds against him in the last elect on
were too great. I know of no plan for his being

DEATH RESULTS FROM FOOTBALL
A DORSAL VERTEBRA OF A BOY. WHO WAS AT
THE- BOTTOM OF A PILE OF PLAYERS. BROKEN.
Charles L. Lawson. of No. 2.306 Seventh-aye.. .
took part in a game of football which was j
played on Sunday on a vacant lot in Harlem be- i
tween teams known as the Harlem Athletic As- |
sociation and the Juggernauts. In the second ,
half of the game young Lawson was buried
under a pile of players. When the scrimmage •
ended Lawson was unconscious. He had sus- |
tamed a fracture of the seventh dorsal verte- ;
bra, and was completely paralyzed. An ambu- .
lance wap summoned from the Harlem Hos
pital and the injured boy was taken there,
where he died at 2 o'clock yesterday morning.
The game was not stopped on account of the
accident, but was started with renewed zeal as
soon as the injured young man was carried off ,
the field. '
THR PASSING THRONG.
"For those who looked for other things." said
Colonel Calvin R. Nutt. of Frederick. Md.. at the
Waldorf-Astoria yesterday "the
PRAISE President's message must have
FOR THE been a bitter disappointment. Right
MESSAGE. nobly has Colonel Roosevelt re
deemed the promise which he made
to the American people before taking the oath of
office at Buffalo on that historic day in last Septem
ber. From the policy of his great predecessor he
has not deviated, but in formulating and carrying
out that policy he has struck the American note
in a manner wholly his own It is a message to
the people of the country that will stir them to
the uttermost depths of their beincs and in the
reading of which, their patriotism will of kindled
to active flames. From its beginning, in its beauti
ful tribute to the late President down to and In
cluding the signature at its end. the dominant ana
far reaching note is its Intense yet wise American
ism His recommendation that anarchists be ex
cluded from the country is as it should be. and that
and the allied recommendation that any man who
attempts to kill a President or any one in the line
of succession to that great office should be dealt
with in the federal courts by a punishment propor
tionate to the offence should be followed b> im
mediate legislation to that end. „„,„,.,,,.„
••Recognizing the first importance of commerce
and how necessary it is that the markets of tne
world should lie open to us. the President makes of
prosperity the watchword of his administration.
His treatment of the great business interests is
broad and statesmanlike, and his conservative
recommendations with regard to the trusts are such
os to be morally certain to bear an abundant har
vest in the way of legislation."
"The country, now suffering from the extraor
dinary course of that gigantic industrial. Copper,
will appr-cUte to the full tht-
DEATH KNELL wisdom that lies in the para-
OF BLIND graph: The first essential in
POOL CONCERNS, determining how to Ueal with
the great industrial combina
tions is knowledge of the facts— publicity.' That
comprehensive and far-reaching phrase ought to
ring the death knell in America for all blind pool
companies. That the government should have
supervision of big corporations is a seir-eviuent
fact as is also the recommendation that trie rau
roadfl should remain the public's servants. me
reiteration of the Republican policy of ;- ar r>' n^
American goods in American bottoms, of la> ing a
transpacific cable and of building a canal across
the isthmus, is strongly and characterist.eail>
m;ide That reciprocity is and must be the hand
maiden of protection, as the President so wonder
fully puts it. I thoroughly believe. This view of
the subject is a wise and faneetas one In so far
as reciprocity applies to the Western Hemisphere
this recommendation is second to none in impor
tance The recommendation that the Indian here
after be recognised as an individual is timely and
in^Taken'a!l in all. in, whole o- In part, it is a
broadly comprehensive and intensely patriotic doc
ument". It breathes of Am-.-ricanism in its every
line and yet at the same time holds that Ameri
canism by the strong i-ash of common sense.
There is nothing in it that leads one to utter the
prayer. "God of our fathers be with us yet. lest we
forget, lest we torget."
••Theodore Roosevelt ranks this night higher in
the minds of the people of the United States than
before he sent this message to them, which so
amply justifies his friends and so completely con
founds his enemies. To my mind his message and
course since he became President have gone a long
wav toward deciding who shall succeed him in the
White House in 1904. That man will probably be
Theodore Roosevelt, of X. w-York."
