Communicates
with Congress
Vigorously Maintains the
Treaty Bights of

Numerous Important Recommenda

Range of Subjects
Special to The Herald.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4—
President Roosevelt's message
was transmitted to congress to
day, its reading consuming near
ly three hours.
The president handled the dif
ferent subjects exhaustively, some
sections being received with pro
nounced hand clapping.
The California delegation did
not relish the references to the
public schools and Japanese con
troversy in San Francisco.
The president's message was as
follows :
THE MESSAGE
To (ho Senate and House of Represen
tatives:
As a nation wo still continue to enjoy
r literally unprecedented prosperity;
anrl it Is probable that only reckless
speculation and disregard of legitimate
bußlneup method* on the part of the
business wofid can materially mar this
prosperity.
No congress in our time has done
more good work of importance than ihe
present congress. There were several
matters left unfinished at your last ses
sion, however, which I most earnestly
hope you will complete before your ad
journment.
Corporation Campaign Contributions
I again recommend a law prohibiting
all corporations from contributing to
the campaign expenses of any parly.
Such a bill has already passed one house
of congress. Let the Individuals con
tribute as they desire; but let us pro
hibit in effective fashion all corpora
tions from making contributions for
any political purpose, directly or Indi
rectly.
Government's Right of .Appeal in
Criminal Cases
Another bill which has just passed
one house of the congress and which it
is urgently necessary should be enacted
Into law is that conferring upon the
government the right of appeal In
criminal cases on questions of law. This
right existn in many of the states; it
exists in the District of Columbia by
act of the congress. It Ib, of course,
not proposed that in any case a ver
, diet for the defendant on tho merits
should be set aside. Recently In one
district where the government had In
dicted certain persons for conspiracy
in connection with rebates, the court
sustained the defendant's demurrer;
while in another jurisdiction an indict
ment for conspiracy to obtain rebates
lias been sustained by the court, con
victions obtained under it and two de
fendants sentenced to imprisonment.
The two cases referred to may not be
in real conflict with each other, but it
is unfortunate that there should even
be an apparent conflict. At present
there is no way by which the govern
ment can cause such a conflict, when
it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to
n higher court; and the wheels of jus
tice are blocked without any real de
cision of the question. T cannot too
strongly urge the passage of the bill in
question. A failure to pass it will re
sult in seriously hampering the govern
ment in Its effort to obtain Justice, es
pecially against wealthy individuals or
corporations -who do wrong; and may
also prevent the government from ob
taining Justice for wage workers who
are not themselves able effectively to
contest a case where the judgment of
an Inferior court has been against them.
I hay« specifically In view a recent de
'•iHlon by a district Judge leaving rail
way employes without remedy for vio
lation of a certain go-called labor
statute. It seems an absurdity to per
mit a slngln district judge, against
what may be the Judgment of the im
mense majority of his colleagues on
the bench, to declare a law solemnly
enacted by the congress to be "un
constltutlonal," and then to deny to
ihe governmant the right to have the
supreme court definitely decide the
question.
, Bears on Trusts j

t fneiency of the law often depends not

Special to The Herald.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Dec. 6.—
Private dispatches in a round
about way say that much of the
town of Clifton, Ariz., has been
washed away in the floods.
Between fifty and sixty persons
are missing and it is feared all
have perished.
Cliftan has a population of
about 864 and is on a branch road
of the Arizona & New Mexico
railway.
The city stands on the banks
of the Rio San Francisco, which
is a branch of Salt river, which
has been swollen for several days.
The same rush that destroyed
Clifton also carried away three
bents or fifty feet of piling struc
ture in the Phoenix & Eastern
bridge at Tempe, erected as a
temporary span in place of the
steel structure carried away by
the last big flood.
Relief trains are being made up
here which will start as fast as
the road is cleared.
The operator at Solomonville
was spoken to on the wire a few
minutes before midnight tonight,
but he either closed his office or
the wire broke, for beyond con
firming the dread news no details
could be had.

scattering items.

cash on hand $1,935,142, half of
which is in San Francisco, the
balance in New York and Chi

ARTHUR C. HARPER
RESULT A SALUTARY LESSON TO THE MACHINE
"The non-partisans have won a great victory, and one that
will have a lasting and salutary effect upon the political affairs of
Los Angeles. Personally, I have nothing to regret. We made a
great fight against a combination of machines of the Republican
and Democratic parties. The Republican machine slaughtered
Lindley and by doing so it betrayed every member of the party
in Los Angeles. I was confident that it was the deliberate pur
pose of the machine to throw its strength to Harper in an effort
to defeat Lindley because he compelled Smith to retire from the
race, and to do the same with me for accepting the non-partisan
nomination. By combining with the Democratic machine the
Republican bosses were able to accomplish their double purpose,
but in their blind fury they have irreparably hurt their own cause
and discredited themselves in the eyes of all fair- minded men." —
Lee C. Gates.
"The fact that two Republican candidates were in the field
was too much for us. During the past few days there was a no
ticeable slump to Harper, due to the fear of the liberal element in
the Republican party that Gates would be elected. We will
swallow our medicine with the same good grace that we always
do when defeated in convention or at the polls and come up smil
ing for the next fight."— Walter Parker.
"Of course, I am highly pleased with the result of the elec
tion. All that I can say is that I will endeavor to give Los An
geles a clean, businesslike administration." — A. C. Harper.

At 6 a. m. sufficient returns
have been received to indicate the
election of A. C. Harper (Dem.)
mayor by 2500 plurality, with
Gates second and Lindley third.
Non-partisans elected all the re
mainder of the ticket with excep
tion of tax collector. The race for
this office is close between John
son (Rep.) and Welsh (Dem.).
The non-partisans elected the
following councilmen: Dromgold,
First ward; Wren, Third; Pease,
Fourth; Wallace, Fifth. In the
Second ward the contest is close
Detween Clampitt (Rep.) and Van
Degrift (Non-P.), with' the
chances in favor of Clampitt.
Younkin (Rep.) and Akey (Non-
P.) are making a close race in the
Sixth, with the chances in favor
Df Younkin. Houghton's defeat is
;ertain. Lyons (Rep.) defeated
Kearney (Dem.) and Betkouski
(Non.-P.) in the Seventh; Healy
won in the Eighth and Blanchard
in the Ninth.
At least two of the charter
amendments, the franchise exten
sion and permitting the carrying
of freight on street car lines at
night, have been defeated.
A. C. Harper, Democrat, ' has been
elected mayor of Los Angeles by a
plurality of about 2000.
With the possible exception of one
candidate, the non-partisans have
elected the remainder of the ticket.
At least five, and possibly seven, non
partisan candidates for the council
have been chosen.
With the exception of the head of the
ticket, the non-partisans came out of
the fray with flying colors, while the
Republican standard has been dragged
deep in the political mire.
Dr. Walter Lindley, the Republican
nomineo for mayor, was ruthlessly
slaughtered in the house of his sup
posed friends, and as a result he was
third in he race.
The plan of the Republican machine,
as outlined In The Herald at the time
Dr. Lindley shoved Councilman Smith
out of the race for the Republican
nomination, and after Leo Gates had
accepted the non-partisan nomination
"or mayor, to throw its strength to
Harper In event of his then assured
nomination, in order to defeat Lindley
'or ousting Smith and to defeai
for breaking away from the Republi
can organization, has been carried out
to the letter.
Both Lindley and Gates have been
defeated, but in order to carry out tM
plan the machine waa compelled to
sacrifice everything else.
The Republicans made every effort
to elect George Beebe city attorney.
but they failed, and Leslie Hewitt will
be the city attorney for the next three
years.
The only chance for the. Republicans
to elect a single candimate, except as
to councilmen, is Johnson for tax col
lector, and latest returns indicate that
Welsh, the Democratic nominee, hafl
won out by a narrow margin.
Hance, non-partisan and Democrat,
