Fisheries Boat Tows Craft to Erie,
Pa, Where Identifications Acs
Made Ship Is Believed to
Have Founded.
Erie, Pa. With her flag at halt
mast, the state iisherles boat. Com
modore Perry, Capt. Gerry Drlscoll
commanding, brought to this port the
frozen bodies of nine of the crew
of the Bessemer and Marquette ferry
No. 2, which left Conneaut, Ohio, Tues
day morning, carrying thirty-two men
and which has probably foundered In
the middle of Lake Erie.
For forty-eight hours Commodore
Perry has been searching the waters
of Eastern Lake Erie for traces of the
car ferry, but until a tiny ten-man
yawl was Bighted fifteen miles off this
port, the men on the little state fish
eries craft had almost given up hope
of being able to ever tell even a
portion of the story of the fate of the
big car ferry.
As the lookout on the Perry sighted
a tiny half-sunken yawl at about noon
orders were given to steam down up
on the object. The use of glasses dis
covered the boat to be loaded with
nine men.
Arrived To Late.
As the Perry came abreast of the
drifting and half water-logged yawl,
the men gathered at the Bide of the
fish boat saw that they arrived too
late. The nine occupants of the boat,
which was marked "Bessemer and
Marquette No. 4," were frozen stiff.
Taking the yawl In tow, the Perry
made all steam for this port.
Capt. Johnson of the life-saving sta
tion of this port, had already Bighted
the fish boat and tow and making out
the contents of the yawl, had notified
the Erie chief of police, from Presque
Peninsula, who In turn notified the
coroner. All police reserves were cal
led out and ambulances lined the
wharves as the Perry docked.
News of the finding of the bodies
had reached the city and thousands of
persons swarmed to the wharves. As
soon as the fish boat made fast a
force of men with tackle set to work
raising the bodies of the men to the
dock, where wagons were In wating.
The procession of dead passed through
the principal streets of the city, with'
hundreds of people following.
Conneaut, Ohio, where most of the
men lived, was notified by telephone
of the grewsome find, and a hundred
residents of that city arrived here
within two hours. They were taken
directly to the coroner's morgue,
where identifications were made.
Only One Had Overcoat.
The c of the car ferry was-the
only man to wear an overcoat. The
eight other men were dressed in over
alls and jumpers, indicating that' the
departure from the car ferry had been
hurried. In the bow end of the boat
was found complete clothing for one
man, and It is the belief that the
yawl orglnally contained ten men,
and that one becoming crazed, dis
carded his clothing and jumped Into
the Icy waters of Lake Erie.

RATEGQNTRDVERSY
CUMMINS INTRODUCES MEASURE
PRACTICALLY SUPPLANTING
INTERSTATE COMMERCE ACT.
ELK WILL ALSO SUBMIT BILL
Iowa Senator Advocates Uniform
Classification for Freight Ship
ments Plan for Stock
; Payment at Par.
Washington, D. C. A contro
versy over railroad legislation will be
precipitated In congress this winter,
which, In importance, promises to
surpass the legislative conflict over
railroad rates four years ago.
The first gun was fired by Senator
Cummins of Iowa when he produced
a bill proposing radical changes in
the interstate commerce act. In a
large sense the Cummins measure is
a substitute for the present interstate
commerce act.
It is expected that a measure pro
posing amendments to the law will be
Introduced early in January by Sen
ator Elkins, which will differ from the
Cummins bill In many important de
tails. Uniform Classes Provided.
In brief, the Cummins bill requires
the interstate commerce commission
to promulgate a uniform classification
of freight, and to prepare a plan or
the statement of freight rates which
shall hereafter be made In a uniform
way. The carriers are required to
adopt this classification.
The commission is authorized to
consider rates on Its own motion with
a view to determine their reason
ableness, and is empowered -to fix
maximum and minimum rates.
In any action instituted in court to
set asldo an order of the commission
respecting the rates, the courts are
prevented from inquiring Into the rea
sonableness or sufficiency of any rate
fixed by the commission.
The bill provides that changes in
rates shall not become effective until
they are approved by the commission.
It prohibits the acquisition of control
by any common carrier of any paral
lel competing line, br from acquiring
the capital stock or bonds of any oth
er carrier which Is a competitor.
By the terms of the bill a carrier is
prohibited from Issuing any capital
stock without payment In par, either
In money or In property and, in effect,
the commission shall have supervision
of the issues of stocks and bonds by
any carrier. Specific directions are
given for the disposition of the pro
ceeds of any sale of bonds.
After January 1, 1911, no carrier do
ing interstate business shall be per
mitted to engage in any other busi
ness than tbat of a common carrier.
Nicaraguan Lands In Jail.
Washington, D. C. Things have
gone from bad to worse with the Nic
araguan legation here. Another shock
was received when Senor J. F. Ser
gulera, one of the attaches of the
legation house, landed In the station
house for defaulting on a hack bill
of $4. He remained there all night
: Three Storm Victims,
Chicago, 111. Heavy snow, accom
panied by lower temperature, and
a 35-mile-an-hour wind, swept over
Chicago and the surrounding terri
tory, bringing death to three persons
In this city and seriously hampering
transportation on steam roads and
suburban lines. One man was found
dead from cold and exposure and two
men, blinded by snow, were un over
by trains. The snowfall In this city
was four inches, and reports from out
side points told of 15 inches, with
heavy drifts in railroad cuts.
Train Wreck Attempt Falls. .
Nashville, 111. An' unsuccessful at
tempt was made to wreck the Illi
nois Southern evening , train ,- be
tween McKinley, this county, and
Coulterville, by 'raising the track to
derail the train.
Indianapolis Has $110,00 Fire.
Indianapolis, Ind. A fire that
started In the building of the Con-,

threatened to destroy a block in the

S AGAIN TAKEN
CONGRESSIONAL
At the White House a conference
was held which has an important
bearing upon the legislative program
for the present session of the pres
ent congress. Vice-President Sher
man and Speaker Cannon were called
in by the president, and they sent
more than an hour in consultation. It
was learned that before he sent his
message to congress President Taft
sent a copy to Speaker Cannon and
told him that he would like to talk
over with him some of the features,
especially that In relation to amend
ments to the interstate commerce law.
The speaker responded, and Mr. Sher
man, who presides over the senate,
was also invited. The political sig
nificance of the conference Is given
as the president's desire to get the
factions of the party to agree upon
taking up some one piece of legisla
tion and act upon it harmoniously.
The amendments to the interstate
commerce act are regarded as one
Bubject upon which this can be
brought about, and it seems jjow that
that will be the important business
of the present session. It is believed
that both the "progressives" in the
senate and the "insurgents" in the
house will agree to that statement,
and will be willing to act harmoni
ously with the regulars of the Repub
lican party. .Even the Democrats, it
is believed, will be glad to take up
consideration of this matter.
A shocking story of the whiteslave
traffic, its widespread influence, its
degredation and its misery, is told
in a report submitted by the lmmlgra
atlon commission to congress. ' The
commission is composed of three rep
resentatives and three senators and
has had agents investigating the prob
lem In all parts of the country since
1907.
A drastic proposition to meet the
strike of the switchman on the rail
road lines entering St. Paul is made
in a bill, amending the Erdman act,
which will be Introduced by Repre
sentative Steenerson of Minnesota,
providing for receiverships of the
roads Involved, If necessary. The bill
gives United States courts full juris
diction. It also amends the Erdman
law so as to allow the courts to fix
the compensation of members of the
arbitration boards in cases of unusual
importance.
One of the striking features of the
the house proceedings was a speech
Iby Representative Kuestermann of
Wisconsin, denying the charge that
his interest in German shipping was
so great as to cause him to antagon
ize a bill for the relief of the Ameri
can merchant marine. Mr. Kuester
man was in jovial humor and his
speech was generally enjoyed.
A bill evidently designed to cover
cases of contempt of court similar to
that of President Gompers and his as
sociates of the American Federation
of Labor and greatly restricting the
power of the courts in such cases was
introduced in the house by Repre
sentative Thomas of Kentucky. .
Representative Alexander of Mis
souri Is Bponser for a bill Introduced
in the house which is intended to ex
tend the provisions of the federal
pension laws to include the enrolled
Missouri militia and. the several other
militia organizations of the state
which participated in the civil war. S.
similar bill to include the militia or
ganizations of all the states was also
introduced by Mr. Alexander.
: Stuuding cut strikingly was a reso
lution by Senator Raynor authoris
ing the president of the United States
to cause President Zelaya to be ap
prehended as a common criminal,
charged with the murdfer of two Am
ericans, engaged in revolutionary act
ivity in Nicaragua, contrary to the
code of all civilized nations, which
would have granted them a trial.
Representative Barthold of St.
Louis Introduced a bill in the house
having for Its purpose the relief of
the farmers living in Columbia bot
toms, affected by a government dam.
As a promise of activity in the In
terest of legislation, senators Intro
duced more than 350 bills and resolu
tions, covering a great variety of sub
jects, Friday. Many of these meas
ures failed of passage during the last
congress anil 90 oer cent of them will
l tcclvo fent consideration. .
Leaders of the organization in the
house have commencod to count noses
on ship subsidy, and if, when the'
count is completed, there seems to be
the slightest chance to ,,whlo such a
measure through, .a bill providing for
ship subsidy will b Intradural.
KEHTUGKY IIDIUP -CASE
DEFY POLICE
FATHER OF ALMA KELLNER SAYS
8HE WAS 8TOLEN WHILE
LOOKING AT TOYS. .
Mill IN BLACK SUSPECTED
Child Believed to Have Been Taken
for Heiress Various Clues Traced
by Police Fail to Disclose
Whereabout of Girl.
Louisville, Ky. Though story after
story has been investigated by the
Louisville police, the whereabouts of
8-year-old Alma Kellner, who disap
peared from her home Wednesday
morning, remains a mystery.
F. L. Kellner, father of Alma, said
that he ' believed his daughter was
looking at toys In the shop windows
on Walnut street, when, as he expres
sed It, "somebody nailed her." He said
the child made friends with strangers
In a quick, responsive way and that
after she had attended church, for
which purpose she left home, she was
wandering among the Christmas dis
plays, 'when she was kidnaped.
Meanwhile children resembling
Alma Kellner, have been sympatheti
cally reported to have been seen be
ing forced into covered carriages by
veiled women, roughly dressed, and
the like, observed walking up and
down street-car aisles, hurried Into
Tell City, Ind., where an allegedly dis
gruntled relative of the Kellners is
supposed to live; while another
story is that Alma was mistaken for
her 11-year-old aunt, Meta Kellner, an
heiress, whom Alma resembles.
The city has distributed 500 cir
culars offering an unspecified reward
for the return of the child and the en
tire police force of Louisville and
Southern Indiana towns are busy upon
the case. .
Frank Pahr, millionaire brewer, and
uncle of the missing child, said Fri
day that F. L. Kellner was not in a
position to pay a ransom for Alma,
and that, while F. L. Kellner Sr. had
been a rich man, the junior's share
would not amount to anything con
siderable. The family specifically
denied a rumor published that a
meeting of Mrs., Kellner and the-kidnapers
had been arranged.
One of those "mysterious women In
black," who usually figure in cases
of the Kellner kind, was discovered
zy reporters in the vicinity of the
home of Mrs. F. L. Kellner Sr., and
her actions excited suspicion. The
police who have searched in vain
every vault, empty house and alley in
a readlus of half a mile of the Kell
ner home, devcted their attentions to
watching this woman and to running
down the story of an aged Russslon
peddler, who said he had seen In
Southern Indiana a girl who might
have been Alma, traveling toward
Madison, Ind., and Cincinnati, with a
man In a wagon.

ARE IN DEEP WATER
TROUBLES OF THE REPUBLICANS
LOOM LARGE. " -
Ssntlment of ths Country Calls Loudly
for Gsnulns Reform Measures
Breach In Dominant Party :
Likely to Wlderu
It la to be expected that from the
very beginning of the congressional
session every proposal of real reform
every plan for restricting the privil
eges of organized capital, whether
they come from the president or from
some other source, will be displeas
ing to Aldrlch and Cannon and the
immediate allies of these two leaders,
for this group Is ever on guard to
prevent encroachments on the privil
eged interests. It remains to be seen,
therefore, whether the president will
remain aloof, as he did in the tariff
session, leaving the progressives to
follow the organization leadership or
make an independent stand for reform
measures, or whether he will take up
the representative functions of the
presidency which congress, as now
organized and controlled, has forced
upon the chief executive as a duty to
the whole people.
It has been made clear in the
retrospect that if President Taft had
taken an active part in the tariff pro
ceedings from the beginning of the
extra session he could have rallied a
tremendous force on the side of hon
est revision, the kind of revision he
preached as a candidate for the pres
idency, the kind of revision his party
promised. There is always a goodly
number In each house that follow the
lead of the president whenever that
lead Is definite. Many would have
supported the president as against
Aldrich or Cannon or both who, for
lack of leadership In the White House,
simply kept step with the organiza
tion leaders, being automatic states
men pure and simple. : Since the tariff
scandal was accomplished this class
of members, when all other defenses
have failed, have pointed to the fact
that the president signed the bill.
The sentiment of the country against
the new tariff law and against those
responsible for it has impressed the
breakers of pledges.
If the regular session bears no bet
ter fruit than did the extra session,
the breach in the Republican party
must become wider and deeper.
Action That Would Count.
"The meanest of the trusts," as one
newspaper aptly calls the sugar trust,
has been also one of the chief bene
ficiaries of high protection, one of the
greediest of all the clamorers for pub
lic favors, one of the most active and
malign forces in national affairs. The
men at the top in this business cannot
all have been officials of that com
pany; some of them must have had
high places in the service of the re
public. ' We are not particularly anx
ious to see congress name a commit
tee of investigation, though we do not
object to it. There is another course
of action that will be simpler and
twice as effective. -Let congress strike
out of the tariff law the differential on
refined sugar, and it will accomplish
more for decency at once than it
should expect to see accomplished by
a dozen committees of inquiry. That
differential was put there and has
been kept there by the Influence and
for the benefit of this Bame thieving
corporation which, not' content with
stealing according to law, Is now
proved to have been for years stealing
also against the law against the law
which is so largely of its own making.
Harper's Weekly (Ind.).
To Build Up Merchant Marine.
If we want steamers of our own to
connect our ports with foreign ports,
If we want to have our goods go out
to the world's markets under the
Stars and Stripes, if wo want a large
merchant marine as a reliance for
the navy in case of war, the easiest
way, and ship owners not in line for
a subsidy believe it to be the only
way, Is to open American registration
to every ship that is fitted to receive
It, no matter where it was construct
ed. This is fundamental, but it does
not necessarily imply that special
mall contracts should not be made at
such figures as would help to main
tain a specially desirable class of
steamers and upon specially advan
tageous routes for the uplift of Ameri
can foreign trade.
Condemned by Their Own Acts.
In his speech of acceptance Presi
dent Taft pointed out two important
points In which the Sherman act mis
chievously goes beyond the lines of
the common law, one of them being
that it may be interpreted to Include
labor unions In the forbidden combi
nations. ,
Naturally Democrats place no faith
In the sincerity of a party which,
while thundering against the trusts in
Its platforms and in an occasional law
of doubtful effectiveness, pushes to
the last extreme of radicalism tariff
legislation which fosters, more than
any other one policy, the formation of
monopolies and combinations against
the people.
Sherman Anti-Trust Law.
- The Sherman anti-trust .law does too
much and It does too little. Democrat
ic suspicion of its honesty was quickly
vindicated by the : passage by the
same congress, a few months later, of
the McKinley tariff, which surpassed
all previous legislation in fostering
monopoly and encouraging combina
tions in restraint of trade. What the
people thought of it all was expressed
In the overwhelming defeat of the
Republican party in the elections
which immediately followed the enact
ment of the two laws. .

TRICKERY IN LUMBER TARIFF
Instance Whtrt Wording f the Bill
Undoubtedly Was Intended
to Deceive. .
Apologists for the Aldrlch-Taft tar
iff as measure of revision downward:
point occasionally to the reduction of
the schedule oa squared timber from ,
one cent per cubic foot to one-halt
cent as an evidence that the poor
man's burden has been lightened.
This is another Instance where Mr
Aldrich's official compilation of sta
tistics claims reduction which i
disproved by facts. Admittedly, the
flgures have been reduced. ' Practical- ,
ly the actual tariff has been increased..
The trick is simple. '
Ths Dingley tariff provided for a.
tax on "timber, hewn, sided or
squared." To this phrase the Aid
rich tariff adds the words, "otherwise
than by sawing." Since timber is now
all squared by the saw Instead of br
hewing with an ax, which was for-
merly the method, the four words In
serted Into the new tariff have the ef
fect of taking squared timber out of ,
the one-half-cent-a-cublc-foot ss anot
putting it under boards.
This change in classification results
in practicaly doubling the Dingier
rate. . , .
Unearthing these concealed schemes
for raising the tariff under pre
tense of lowering it requires nt
wonderful skill. , Lack of intelligent
criticism by our national legislators
while the measure was under discus
sion in congress is little tribute to
the capacity of those opposed to the
protective doctrine. ...-.
The President's Position.
'- The president's unequivocal cham
pionship of the Aldrlch tariff bill, com
ing right on the heels of his champion
ship of Aldrich himself and of the- ;
Aldrlch central bank conspiracy, re
moves the last doubt. His position is
now clearly defined. Those who hoped
and believed that Mr. Taft .would put
himself at the head of the progressive
element of the Republican party and,
as a true and worthy heir of Roose
velt, take up with fearless determina
tion the fight against grab and graft
and greed, find themselves cruelly dis
appointed. More than that, if they are
Republicans,' they find their right to
claim a place in the great Republican
party seriously questioned by the lead
er of the party. ; For when Mr. Taft
asserts that the insurgents in con
gress, who voted against the Aldr'ch
tariff bill, "abandoned their party,"
and when he classes "low tariff Re
publicans" contemptuously with Dem
ocrats and "free traders," be leaves
place In his party for these "low tar
iff Republicans" only on sufferance, if
at all. Omaha World-Herald.
;"' Tariffs Must' Be Simplified.
Few men know anything whatever
about any business except that in
which they are engaged. The ordinary
taxpayer can know little or nothing:
of the effect of taxes even on himself
unless he is expert enough to know
what their effect will be on scores and.
hundreds of Industries of which he
knows nothing. And this is the way
taxes are levied in this free cduntry in
the twentieth century! The people do
not know and cannot know what Is
going on. Congress is no longer com
petent to make tariffs. We are at the
mercy of "experts," practically all of
whom are interested in taking care of
certain private industries. A commis
sion might help somewhat. But the
anly sensible thing Is to simplify our
tariffs, and to levy taxes for the sup
port of the government.
, Consistent Democracy.
- The effort to make it appear that
Democrats In 1890 or in- any other
year have opposed effective anti-trust
legislation is rendered absurd by that:
party's repeated declarations and by'
the consistent policy it has adhered
to. The position it took with respect'
to trusts and monopolies in the year
when the congress which passed the'
Sherman act was elected is stated in
the Democratic national platform of
1888, in the following words: "Judged
by Democratic principles, the interests I
of the people are betrayed when, by,
unnecessary taxation, trusts and com
binations are permitted and fostered,'
which, while unduly-enriching the few,
that combine, rob the body of our citi
sens by depriving them as purchasers'
of the benefits of natural competi
tion." Who Gets the Money 7
The American people have a right
to know what becomes of the billion
and a half dollars which is what the
tariff costs them'' In Increased prices,
'Me estimate being low that they pay
to employers of labor on the assur
ance that it will at least be ' shared '
with the employes. If we do not get
(and the investigation into affairs in
the Pressed Steel Car Company's
plant proves we do not get) an Ameri
can rate of wages or an American
standard of living we fall to get the
greatest boon which the protectionists
promise us. If it were not for the ar
gument based on. the advantage to la
bor the protective system could not
stand for a moment ' -
Senate Membership.
The New York Evening Post re
sently analyzed the senate. : It found
therein 27 corporation lawyers, 21
bankers and holders of bank stock,
11 manufacturers, 19 holders of rail
road stock, 26 holders of Industrial
stocks, six men interested in steam
ship lines, 17 Interested in mines and
nine interested In lumber. ,
A pretty fair showing for ft group
at politicians who have followed the
late James G. Blaine's advice to "cast
an anchor to windward." No one Im
pugns the financial integrity of these
senators. But were they fit to frame '
an honest tariff bill? y
The Republican party surely Is a
compact and resourceful organization.
But It can't well bear the double strain '
of a tpllt on the tariff and - the feud
that 1b brewing between the Taft and
Roosevelt forces. ,.-,',
