Reconvening of .Congress Immigration
Restriction Bill Culls for First Consider
ation In the Senate Appropriation Bills
. Two New Members to be Sworn iu In
the House General Pension Bill.
Washington, Pec. 6. It is not likely
anything will be done in either house
to-morrow except to exchange congrat
ulations or condolences, as the case
may be, over the results of the elec
tions, and listen to the president's mes
sage. When the last session closed the
house immigration bill had, and now
has, the right of way in the senate. It
is the unfinished business and will be
called up at the expiration of the
morning hour. Although known as the
house bill on the calendar, as reported
to the senate by Mr. Lodge, it is a ma
terially different measure, all of the
house provisions having been stricken
out except the enacting clause, and a
new bill substituted. This bill will be
called up on Tuesday by Senators
Lodge and Chandler, who desire to
bush it to a vote as quickly as possi
ble. As the bill came from the house it
provided not only for the exclusion of
immigrants who could not fill the edu
cational test, but went at some length
into the regulation of alien contract
labor. Mr. Lodge's substitute provides
for an' educational test and excludes all
persons over fourteen years of age, who
cannot read and write the language of
their native country or some other lan
guage, except that an aged person not
so able, who is a parent or grandpar
ent of an admissible emigrant may ac
company or be sent by such immigrant.
For the purpose of testing the ability
of the immigrant to read and write a
'citation of five lines" from the consti
tution of the United States is to be
used, printed in various languages of
the immigrants, is in good sized type
known as "double small pica." The
constitution thus cut into five line slips,
forms a lottery from which the immi
grant, having designated the language
in which he prefers the test to be made,
draws at random, reads and writes
down what Ire has read. Failure to
comply with this test means deporta
tion to the country whence the immi
grant came, at the expense of the
steamship company carrying him.
An effort will be made to secure new
dates for the consideration of special
orders that were not reached during
the Jast session. These measures now
coming under this head are senate bill
No. 1,012, to prevent the desecration of
the national flag; house bill to amend
the act to prevent the extermination of
fur bearing animals of Alaska; house
bill 878 to reduce the cases in which
the penalty of death may be inflicted,
and senate joint resolution proposing
an amendment to the constitution pro
viding for the election of senators by
popular vote.
An important local bill on -which
there has developed a biter fight is
the Detroit bridge bill for a bridge
across the Detroit river. It was post
poned ait the last session -until the first
Monday In December.
In addition to 'the appropriation bills
there are several measures that will
contend with each other for the right
of way. Prominent among these are
the bills to refund the Pacific railroad
debt; to admit the territories of New
Mexico and Arizona; authorizing the
secretary of the navy to enlist addi
tional men, now pending in the senate
on a motion to reconsider the vote by
which It "was passed; Mr. Davis' reso
lution relative to the assertion and en
forcement of the Monroe doctrine; a
bill to facilitate the construction of a
calble 'between this country and Ha
waii; providing for a uniform classifi
cation and grading of agricultural pro
ducts and one providing for the re
organization of the consular and diplo
matic service.
In the house of representatives there
will be the swearing in of two new
members to first engage the attention
of Speaker Reed and the house Messrs.
Boatner of Louisiana and Stokes of
South Carolina. These gentlemen enjoy
the very unusual distinction of hav
ing twice received certificates of elec
tion to one congress. At the last ses
sion their seats were declared vacant,
tout contestants -did not succeed in es
tablishing their right thereto and new
elections were ordered. Since congress
adjourned another vacancy has oc
curred that occasioned by the death
of ex-Speaker Crisp. His son, who was
his father's clerk, has been nominated
to fill the unexpired term, but the elec
tion will not be held until the 16th inst.
The death of the late speaker will prob
ably be announced by one of his for
mer colleagues and after the reading
of the president's message the house
will adjourn.
Mr. Blue, chairman of the cub-committee
of the committee on appropria
tions, will report the general pension
hill to the house and set a day for its
consideration. This -will doubtlessly be
early in the week. The rules provide
that all business on the calendar shall
retain its place throughout an entire
congress, so that adjournment from one
cession to another means no more than
adjournment from day to day.
The program of business for the first
week of the session will depend upon
the developments from day to day of
committee action and recommendation.
Before the week closes, however, the
legislative executive and judicial bill
will be reported and placed on the cal
endar and on Friday night there will be
the usual session for the consideration
of private pension bills.

VENEZUELA IS SATISFIED
With the Terms of Arbitration In the
Boundary Dispute.
Washington, Dec. 6. The probable
assent of Venezuela to the proposed
treaty of arbitration of the British
Guiana boundary dispute through the
good offices of the United States and
the practical conclusion of a general
arbitration convention between Great
Britain and the United States, It is
stated, will fbrm two of the most im
portant diplomatic announcements in
the president's message to congress.
What is understood to be In nearly es
sential particulars, a copy of the pre
liminary agreemnt entered into some
weeks ago between Secretary Olney
and Sir Julian Pauncefote on the Vene
zuelan matter was made public this
morning. ' .
The draft of the proposed treaty itself
which the Venezuelan minister, M.
Andrade, carried with him to Caracas
to lay before his government Is more
elaborate. It starts with a preamble
of considerable length and in that por
tion ' which refers to the fifty years'
occupation of territory embodies other
points .than those of mere occupancy
and political control mentioned in the
preliminary agreement, which will be
taken into consideration by the trib
unal. These are expressed in technical
terms which international lawyers will
understand, but which Would not be
readily comprehended by others.
Advices received from Caracas do not
bear out the impression that the Vene
zuelan cabinet is dissatisfied with the
treaty, or that Minister Andrade, who
will shortly return to the United States,
will bring with Mm the draft of a new
treaty as modified by the' Venezuelan
authorities. ' On the contrary there are
grounds for the "belief that President
Crespo and his consfcttuional advisors
have given their full adhesion to the
proposed . treaty.
Under these circumstances it will be
signed by MinisteA Andrade, represent
ing the South American republic, and
by Sir Julian Pauncefot, on the part of
Great Britain, after which the United
States will drop out of the matter well
satisfied to have been the medium of
bringing the two countries together and
of effecting a settlement of their long
dispute through the peaceful channel of
an International board' of arbitrators.
While it is entirely true that the rati
flcation of the treaty must still depend
upon the will of the Venezuelan con
gress, no doubt is felt that that body
will Indorse President Crespo's action.
In regard to a general treaty of ar
bitration between the United States and
Great Britain, it is stated that, the pres
ident message will show negotiations
are practically concluded and it will
be the president's pleasure in a few
weeks at the utmost trt lay the treaty
before the senate for 'its consideration.
It is substantially finished now, except
ting a few matters of detail that are
still the su'bject of correspondence, but
respecting which there will be little,
if any, addtional delay.

Fugitive Naval Apprentices Are Back at
the Newport Station.
Newport, R. I., Dec. 6. All of the ap
prentices who escaped from the naval
training station yesterday afternoon
had either been brought back or return
ed of their own free will by 11 o'clock
last night, and all are confined in the
brig, as are about a dozen others who
smashed windows to let oft" their sur
plus excitement. The whole affair was
apparently a boyish escapade to show
disapproval of the way things have
been managed Sn regard to liberty
granting. The fact that the boys after
getting free made no attempt to get
away from the city shows that they did
not intend to desert.
S1X-VAY BICYCLE RACE.
The Big Event Started at 13:06 This Morn
ing Large Number of Contestants.
New York, Dec. 7. The six-day bicy
cle race at Madison Square Garden was
started at 12:06 o'clock this morning in
the presence of a big crowd of specta
tors. Much interest is taken in the
event, owing to the international char
acter lent by the presence of the long
distance foreign riders, of whom Tom
Linton, the Welsh champion, and Char
ley Chappel, the English long distance
crack, are the stars. The foreigners all
look to be in fine condition and ex
pressed a good deal of confidence that
final honors will come their way. But
the American contingent were equally
hopeful of victory and Albert Sheck,
winner of the last six day race in the
Garden, and Charley Ashing carry the
hopes of the home contingent.
The Garden was handsomely decorat
ed, and from 8 o'clock last night until
midnight the band of the Sixty-ninth
regiment kept the waiting crowd in
good humor until the men were sent
off. The track, which is ten laps to the
mile, was fairly well banked, but the
surface looked rather slippery, while
the corners were scarcely high enough.
But as sprinting will not be a feature
of the race the starters were fairly well
satisfied, although Plummer, the for
eigner's manager, thought the banking
might have been better.
Just at midnight Starter A. A. Zim
merman got the riders under control
as follows: Albert Shock of New York,
Frank Wallace of Germany, Tom Lin
ton of Wales. William 'Lumsden of
Scotland, C. Chappie of England, Teddy
Hale of Ireland, Peter Golden and H.
H. Maddox of America, A. A. Hanson
of Denmark, George Cartwright of
England, Frederick Foster of Germany,
E. C Moore, George Vanemb, J. W.
Conkling and Ned Reading of America,
Ed Von Steege of Germany, Burns W.
Pierce of Canada, S. L. Cassidy, Tay
lor, J. Wilson of England, J. R. Gan
non, F. C. Smith, C. W. Ashinger and
W. A. Elkes of England. J. A. Glick f
America, H. Maddox of America.
Six minutes later the twenty-eight
men were started off. The first mile
was made in three minutes by Tom
Linton.

NIGGER IN THE WOOMLK
BEHIND THE II AMU lit a STRIKE US
ARE THE GERMAN SOCIALISTS.
Their Concern Not for the Laborers, but
for Their Party Entire Shipping Inter
est of Germany Will Suffer If the. Em
ployes Win Bitter Battle for Supremacy
Emperor Takes a Hand In the Struggle.
Berlin, Nov. 6. Passing from its In
itial phase as a mere industrial agita
tion In. pursuit of higher wages, the
strike of dock laborers at Hamburg
and elsewhere has become a matter of
political Importance. Behind the local
organizers of the Hamburg strike, as
it has now been revealed, are the execu
tive committee of the socialist party,
who are working not so much In the
Interests of the laborers as in the in
terests of the social democratic party.
The executive committee of the social
ist party are now established in head
quarters at Hamburg and they have
managed to get the trades unions
throughout Germany to supply funds
for the support of strikers at all the
Baltic ports.
What is called a "laborers' common
resistance fund" has been formed, to
which the socialist associations in every
great center are contributing. The ob
ject of this movement Is less to, con
quer the employers than to foster the
socialist propaganda. If the dock la
borers at Hamburg had been left to
themselves they would have speedily
settled their dispute with the masters,
who proffered to their old employes
concessions equal to what the strikers
originally demanded.
Since the socialist leaders have Inter
vened, however, the demands of the
strikers have increased, until now the
employers find themselves face to face
with the real issue, which is that the
entire shipping Industry of Germany
must obey the dictates of the politico
social organization or fight out a su
preme battle to the end.
The rejection by the employers of the
proposal to submit the dispute to a
board of arbitration was due to the
knowledge by the employers of the
fact that the men behind the strikers
would not eventually accepts the deci
sion of the arbitration tribunal, which
as proposed, conceded only one member
to represent the employers. It was not
the absence of adequate representation
on the tribunal that caused the em
ployers to reject the proposal, but it
was their conviction of the futility of
the whole program.
The movement is now seen to be a
combined attack upon German com
merce and German capital, In which
the government will soon be bound to
Interfere. The emperor sent an agent
to see personally Senator Hachman of
Hamburg, Herr Heinrlchsen, the presi
dent of the Hamburger Burgerschaft,
and Herr Noack, the president of the
Hamburg chamber of commerce, all of
whom advised the formation of an ar
bitration tribunal to which the dispute
between the employers and the strikers
should be submitted for settlement.
The kaiser himself strongly favored
the earliest possible settlement of the
difficulty until he was shown that the
socialist politicians were managing the
strike, when, it Is understood, his ma
jesty advised the home office to await
the developments, 'but not to interfere.
In the meantime General von Schlewitz,
commanding the troops at Hamburg,
has been Instructed to take full meas
ures to maintain order.
GESEKAL WEVLER'S CAMPAIGN.
No News From Him for Three Hays More
Troops Arrive.
Havana, Dec. 6. Three days have
now elapsed since any news was receiv
ed from Captain General Weyler. It is
not known in what part of the province
of Pinar del Rio he is or what he is do
ing towards carrying out the plan of
campaign on which the loyalists have
built nigh hopes, but which has thus
far resulted In no signal success. Heavy
rains have been prevailing lately, and
It Is probable that the condition of the
country has put a temoprary check on
the operations of the Spanish forces.
Officials here state that there is nothing
surprising in no dispatches being re
ceived from General Weyler, as he is a
man of action rather than of words and
is waiting to meet the rebels before he
devotes any time to the writing of dis
patches. General Melguiso reports that his
command surprised a rebel hospital in
the Valle Hills, province of Pinar del
Rio. Six lnsurgents7 whether wounded
or not is not stated, were killed and the
dwellings and all the camp parapher
nalia were destroyed. The first contin
gent of the new reinforcements, num
being 2,500 men, arrived to-day.
Fatal Accident at Providence.
Providence, R. I., Dec. 6. William
Brayton, aged fifty-four, was killed
shortly before 11 o'clock this morning
foy falling down a high bank and frac
turing his skull on a ree in Davis'
Park. The deceased had been fore
man in the Brastow Thread company
for the last twenty-nine years and was
well known in Valley Falls, where he
owned considerable property.
Drowned in the Connecticut.
Holyoke, Mass., Dec. 6. Anton Ma
joon. aged eighteen, was drowned in
the Connecticut river, this afternoon.
He was skating in company with a
large party and broke through the ice
and sank before aid could reach him.
His body was recovered.
England Advances Egvpt 500,OOO.
Cairo, Dec. 6. Great Britain has ad

has accepted the sum of 500,000 pounds
to be repaid into the treasury in pur
suance of the Judgment of the court of
appeals, which decided that the Cais

advance that or any other sum to meet
the expenses of. the Soudan, campaign.
A DAY OF REST AT CANTON.
Major McKlnley, After a Week's Hard
' Labor, Enjoys a Respite.
Canton, 6., Dec. 6. After a week of
the hardest work he has experienced
for two months, Major McKlnley en
joyed a day of thorough rest. The
weather was. fine. The major took a
drive with Colonel and Mrs. Myron T.
Herrlck in the morning and a walk In
the afternoon. There were no callers
of a political character. This evening
Major McKlnley was thoroughly rested
and in the best of spirits. There will
be a good many distinguished visitors
at Canton this week.
Michigan' politicians who passed
through Canton to-day are authority
for the statement that General Alger
will be opposed in his own state, and
that Mayor Plngree, ex-Senator Palm
er and others may make a formal pro
test against his appointment to a cab
inet position.
It is stated that Influences in Michi
gan that are unfriendly to General Al
ger will seek to have Senator Sher
mon, whose opposition to him is a mat
ter of history, oppose his confirmation
if his name be sent to the senate as a
cabinet officer.
MEN WILL NOT RE LAID OFF.
New Patrolmen Will be Retained on the
Force.
Eighteen patrolmen were recently
appointed by the police commissioners,
and an extra appropriation of $14,000
was asked of the hoard of finance with
which to pay the salaries of the new
officers. The board of finance finished
its consideration of the estimates on
Friday, and it has leaked out, despite
efforts to suppress the fact, that the
extra appropriation asked for the po
lice department would not be allowed.
It was said in police circles that this
actionmight cause the suspension of the
eighteen recent appointees. One of the
commissioners, speaking on the sub
ject last evening, said: "Not one of the
eighteen recently appointed men will
be laid off. We need the men and ask
ed for the appropriation. The recruits
are young and active men. They have
been carefully examined and they are
men who will, with experience, make
efficient officers.
"The board had an 'intimation that
something like what has been suggest
ed would be done, and we have talked
the matter over. There are two ways
by which we may retain the new men.
The first Is by removing the less effi
cient patrolmen from the different pre
cincts, selecting the best men for each
of the precincts and letting the worst
slide. This is the thing most likely to
happen. Anether way out of the di
lemma will be to lay off each man a
certain numher of days in the year. In
this way the burden of the cheese-paring
economy would fall on all the men.
"There is no disposition on the part
of the board to part with the newly
appointed officers, but the action of the
board of finance opens up a way for
the weeding out of poor material. This
may, not be done, however, for the de
partment needs about so many men in
case of emergency."
In reference to the reports current
that the board of finance had refused
the extra police and fire appropriations,
there was considerable indignation ex
pressed among those members who
would not violate the understanding
that nothing was to be made public
until the meeting.
Several members were seen last even
ing, but they would neither deny nor
affirm the report. They reiterated the
statement that nothing would be au
thentic until the official report was
made to-night at the aldermanie meet-
Powers to Confer on Turkish Question.
Berlin, Dec. 6. M. Nelidoff, Russian
ambassador to Turkey, who has been
in St. Petersburg for some time, will
leave the Russian capital on Monday
on his return to Constantinople. It is
reported that he has the authority of
the czar to propose a conference of the
powers upon the questions of the Tur
kish financial reforms and the opening
of the Dardanelles. The conference, it
Is understood, will not touch upon the
Egyptian question.
Stabbing Affair on Union Street.
Charles Roberts, colored, and Joseph
P. White, got into an altercation In the
"Bungalow" on Union street last even
ing. Roberts stabbed White in the
groin with a pocketknife he was using
when White entered the room. Roberts
said that he was sitting in the room
manicuring his nails. White entered
the room and said he was a "nigger."
The two men clinched, with serious re
sults to White. Both men were arrest
ed by Patrolman Coonan. White's
wound was attended by Police Surgeon
Louis J. Gaynor.

STRANGE TALE OF THE DEEP
WRECKED SAILOR FLOATS ON A
HATCH FOR S3 HOURS,
Subsisted on Cocoanuts and Oranges Float

Steamship by Crying Out for Help Sole
Survivor of the Crew of the Schooner
Frank M. Noyes. '
Savannah, Ga., Dec. 6. The steam
ship Strathcalrn, from Swansea, via
Delaware Breakwater, arrived yester
day having on board a shipwrecked
sailor picked up Friday in the Gulf
stream, off the coast of North Carolina.
The man was the onlysurvivor of the
Frank M. Noyes, a small schooner
bound from San Andreas Island for
Baltimore, with a cargo of fruit. She
had gone far to sea on account of the
severe storms which were raging along
the coast and was in the gulf stream.
Captain Cummings was ascending the
bridge about 3 o'clock in the afternoon
when he heard cries from the sea. On
close observation he sighted a man
clinging to a small object and desper
ately waving j for help. When within
fifty yards of the man, who was cling
ing to the hatch of "a vessel, Captain
Cummings ordered his men to lower a
boat. .
Before it could be let down Into the
sea the man left his frail preserver and
struck out for the ships. Reaching her
side he secured a rope that was thrown
him, placed it around his waist and the
sailors drew him on board. As soon
as he reached the steamer's deck he fell
unconscious. After a few hours sleep
he was able to tell the story of his ex
perience. He Is a Swede, eighteen years old,
namer Eric Stocklasse and was a sea
man on the schooner Frank Mv Noyes.
The schooner encountered the storm
last Tuesday and was swept for and
aft by the terrific seastnd high winds.
The crew and six was well nigh ex
hausted -in trying to keep the vessel
from going to pieces, when, on Wed
nesday morning at 10 o'clock she cap
sized, throwing everyone on board into
the sea. Stocklasse and a young man
about twenty-one years old, named Ar
thur Cross of Springfield, Mass., seized
one -of the hatches which floated off,
and clung to it. They saw Captain
Asqulni and the rest of the crew sink
Into the ocean. Fortunately the cast
away seamen were in the gulf, stream,
where the -water was comparatively
warm and they were enabled to stand
the exposure better than if they had
been nearer in-shore, or In the middle
of the ocean. They drifted northward
In the stream and occasionally caught
a floating orange or cocoanut, which
sustained life. .
Thursday night, after being In the
water for forty hours, Cross began to
Show signs of exhaustion and after
bidding his shipmate good-bye slipped
from the hatch and was not seen after
wards. Stocklasse clung to the hatch
with bull dog tenacity and was saved
after being fifty-three hours In the
water. 1 Stocklasse regained his
strength rapidly and yesterday was
able to be about the ship, where he still
is. t

Republican Editors Meet and Denounce
the Outrage.
Chattanooga, Tenn., Dec. 6. At a
meeting to-day of the State Republican
Editors' association ex-Representative
Evans, ex-United States Senator War
ner and Colonel H. B. Case, state de
partment commander of the G. A. R.,
delivered incendiary speeches, taking
as their theme alleged election frauds
in Tennessee in November last and the
pending gubernatorial contest. Evans
charged that scoundrels, who, if they
had their deserts, would be hung to tel
egraph poles, were appointed officers of
election.
Commander Case was loudly ap
plauded when he said: "We will get
our rights only at the point of our
guns."
The intemperate utterances have
aroused many bitter comments.

REPTltlANS OF THE PRESS.
The Trial Of German Editors Will Work
Grand Results.
Berlin, Dec 6. The 'best Journalists1
of Germany, those whose probity can
not be impeached, are hopeful that the
grandest result from the revelations of
the trial of the five editors, Baron von
Luetzow and Herren Ploetz, Foellmar,
Leckert and Berger, for libelling Bar
on Marschal von Rlebersteln, Prince
Alexander von Hohenlohe and Count
August von Eulenberg will be the ex
tinction of the gang of members of the
German press who are feeding upon
doubtful official information.
If larger latitude were allowed to
press criticism less corruption would
be practiced, the Independence of the
press would be greater and the posi
tion of earnest and self-respecting
journalists would be enhanced. While
the foreign office or any other of the
government departments continues to
influence- the newspapers, inciting
them to publish this, that or the other,
bribing newspaper men by giving them
information which is sometimes true
and often false, according to 'the in
terests of the department furnishing it,
there is little hope of reform of the ex
isting abuses.
. The leading public men who are get
ting their names smirched by the rev
elations of the present trial may be led:
to recognize the fact that their support
of the reptilians of the press endangers
themselves more than it hurts any
body else.
A protracted conference was held last
evening at the chancellery between the
imperial chancellor, Prince von Hohen
lohe, Baron Marschal von Rlebersteln;
minister of foreign affairs; Dr. Schoen
stedt, minister of justice, and Frlherr
von Derricke von der Host, minister of
the interior. The conference was held
at the "command of the kaiser for the
purpose of arranging a limit to the de
velopments of the trial of Baron von
Luetzow and his associate defendants,
as for reasons of state it is regarded by
the emperor as desirable that the revel
ations shall not b& pursued much, if
any further. '
It is whispered that Baron von
Tanussch, chief of the political police,
who will probably be accused of being
accessory to the forgeries and frauds
committed by Baron von Luetzow, had
backers of the highest influences in
connection with the part he took in the
scandalous acts, and it is rumored that
this fact furnishes one of the strongest
reasons for a desire to suppress fur
ther revelations. ,
COLONEL FELLOWS' CONDITION
Remains Unchanged Death May Come at
Any Moment.
New York, Dec. 7. At midnight Col-'
Onel John R. Fellows' condition re
mained unchanged. The physicians

land completed the preparation of tho
message to congress Saturday. He had!
a consultalon With' Secretary Olney in
the morning in relation to the treat- .
ment of foreign relations. This portion
of the message is always left open till
the last, inasmuch as the secretary ot
state is the only cabinet officer who has
not the right of making a report direct-,
ly to congress, and at the final moment
there may always be a change in our
relations with other governments which
may necessitate a change in the text o
the message.
The government printer will com- -plete
the printed copy of the message
intended for he press and individual
members of congress by to-morrow
morning. Thei two official copies in
tended for formal presentation to tha
senate and house will be in writing, ac
cording to unfailing custom. The copy
for the senate will be written by As
sistant Private Secretary Pruden, and
the one for the house by Executive
Clerk Young, both expert penmen. .
The prepartlon of these manuscript
copies is no light task, inasmuch as tha
present message is understood to maka
nearly eighteen thousand words.
