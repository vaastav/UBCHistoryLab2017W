HEAPS TEE LIVES OF FIVE MTV,
Washington, Dec. 7. The presi.
dent's message was sent to congress
today. It opens with a reference to
the late political contest, and the
consequences involved, and points
ont tbe "manly submission which
succeeded the heated clash of polit
ical opinions," as evidence of the
stability of our institutions. In
speaking of our foreign relations, the
president expresses regret at the an
lmDroved condition of affairs in
Turkey. He says the future safety
of the citizens of the United States
is not assured; that while the gov
ernment will do all possible to pro
tect its missionaries, the people of
this countrv should not demand
impossible things." An adequate
force for protection would be re
sented both by Turkey and the pow
ers.
Considerable spaoe is given to
Cuba. On this subject the president
savs in part: "It Spain has not yet
reestablished authority, neither have
the Insurgents, yet they have made
good the title to be regarded as an in
dependent state. The only civil gov
ernment maintained is that by Spain,
more or less imperfectly in the Isrge
towns and immediate suburbs. It is
reported indeed, on reliable authori
ty, that at the demand of the com
mander-in-chief tbe insurgent army
of the putative Cuban government,
has now given up all attempt to ex
ercise tbe functions leaving the
government, confessedly (what there
is the best reason for sup
posing has always been in fact) a
government merely on paper." The
demands for according belligerent
right to the insurgents in recogni
tion of their independence by tbe
purchase by the United States of
the island, or intervention by the
United States to end the strife, even
at the cost of war with Spain, are
all dismissed by the president. The
restraint and patient endurance by
the United States of the conditions
in Cuba are pointed out. Continu
ing, the president ssys: "It would
seem it Spain should offer Uuoa a
genuine autonomy a measure of
home rnle, which while preserving
the soverelgaty of Spain, would sat
isfy all the rational requirements of
her Spanish subjects there should
be no just reason why pacification
might not be effected on that bais
Such a result would appear to be in
the true interests of all concerned."
Ualtad Btatas May I tat far.
The president then savs he inti
mated to Spain some months ago
that if Cuba was granted home rule
the United States would endeavor to
rind a way, not objectionable to Spain,
of furinshing a guarantee to the insur
gents that such a promise of home
rule would be carried out. He says no
definite response was rece;vd, but
believes the proposition was not al
together unwelcome. Continuing
the president say: "It fhould be
added that it cannot be reasonably as
sumed that the hitherto txpeotant
attitude of the United States can be
indefinitely maintained While we
are anxious to accord all due re
elect to the sovereignty of Fpain. we
cinnot view the present conflict in

its possible results without consider

good citizenship.
Speaking of the adjustment of the
Pacific railroad obligation he recom
mends "in the matter of the Un'on
Pacific foreclosure such executive ac
tion as will subserve public interests
and save the government from loss."
The work of the agricultural de
partment is especially commended.
The country is congratulated on the
progress of civil service reform. An
amendment to the interstate com
merce act is recommended.
TatlBT Rafora.
Touching the present tariff he says
it must be conceded, that whatever
its shortcoming it opened the way to
freer and greater exchange of com
modities with other countries. He
believes if allowed a fair opportunity
it will in the near future produce
sufficient revenue to meet the gov
ernment expenditures. Meantime
any deficit which may occur need
can e no alarm, as the government
has a surplus of over $128,000,000
in addition to the gold reserve.
The president renews his former
recommendation for the retirement of
green backs by the isauance of long
term low interest bonds.

For the hrst time in the memory
of the oldest officials the secretary of
state made a regular report to the
president for transmission to con
gress. This report was laid before
congress as an appendix to the pres
identa message, it treats ol many
details of our relations with foreign
governments, either not touched on
in the message or more brief!
treated. Under the head of Spain,
Secretary Olney has much to say re
gardiog Cuba, and sets out in great
detail the history of the growth of
the rebellion, and the present evil
state of affairs on the island.
The secretary's estimate of the sit
nation is disclosed in the following
paragraph, made after the statement
of tbe destruction of the industrial
resources of Cuba: "This situation
cannot indefinitely continue without
growing still worse, and the time
may not be far distant when the
United States must seriously con
sider the question whether its rights
and interests, as well as interna.
tional duties, in view of its peculiar
relations to the island do not call for
some decided change in the policy
hitherto pursued."

men of South Africa are not human
creatures caught in tbe very act of de
veloping from lower forms, bot are the
result of degeneration from some higher
type, then the creature resulting from a
cross between the two might revert to
the higher type and be of higher social
feeling aud intellectual power than
either. We nave ourselves in only one
instance met an individual who was
crot-s between the r.ugli8h ana KaUtf
races, though we know that several such
exist in South Africa. This man was
certainly merely a composite of the two
races, without any tendency to rever
sion. Be was tbe son of an English gen
tleman; his mother was a Kaffir woman
who had not been draggled under the
feet of civilization.
The man was proud, determined, reso
lute. Self educated, be raised himself
to a post of high trust under tbe Eng
lish government. He combined the davit
and couraga of the Kaffir with the pride
and intelligence of. the Englishman.
He bad the fault, which is common to
both bis parent races, of being cruel
and indomitable when opposed, but of
tbe vices supposed to be inseparable
from half castism servility and insin
cerity be had not a trace. He was a
man and a gentleman. Bnt whether if
such crosses were common such men
would often arise is quite another ques
tion. Fortnightly Beview.
