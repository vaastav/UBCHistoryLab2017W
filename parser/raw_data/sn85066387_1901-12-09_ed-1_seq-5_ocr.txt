FALLS INTO WELL
AND IS DROWNED
Five-Year-Old Boy Meets
With a Fatal Ac
cident.
Loses His Life in the Pres
ence of Two of His
Brothera
While playing with several companions
In a. vegretable garden at- Sunnyside yes
terday afternoon Frank Deleantoni, aged
five years, who lived at Miguel and Joost
avenues, fell down a well and was
drowned. The unfortunate boy and his
two brothers left their home to visit the
sons of Antone Canapa, a vegetable gar
dener, at 247 liraugton avenue.
While playing in a field In the rear of
the house Frank fell in the well, which is
about thirty feet deep. The screams of
his companions attracted the attention of
Canapa and on hearing that the boy had
fallen Into the well he procured. a rope
and vainly endeavored to rescue him.
Failing to induce the child to catch hold
of the rope, Canapa lowered himself Into
the well, but too late to save the boy's
life.
When his lifeless body was brought to
the surface his mother seized it and re
fused to allow It to be taken from her.
"You can't take him from me," she
cried as she showered kisses on the cold,
damp face of her favorite offspring. "I
dare anybody to separate us."
After considerable parleying the grief
stricken parent was linally persuaded to
turn the body over to Canapa. Word was
at once sent to, the Coroner, and Deputy
Meehan was dispatched to take possession
of the body. When he reached the scene
he was firmly . told by the sorrowing
mother that under no circumstances
would she allow the remains of her child
to be taken to the _tor_ue.
"Touch it at your peril," tearfully ex
claimed the heart-broken woman, point-
Ing to the body of her child. "You will
have to. kill me before you can take my
darling from me."
Rather than add to her grief. Meehan
consented to allow the body to remain at
the house. An inquest will be held to-day.

SOFT, GLOSSY HAIB.
It Can Only Be Had Where There Is
No Dandruff.
Any man or woman who wants soft,
glossy hair must be. free of dandruff,
which causes falling hair. Since It has
become known that dandruff Is a germ
disease, the old hair preparations that
were mostly scalp irritants, have been
abandoned, and the public, barbers and
doctors included, have taken to using
Newbro's Herpicide, the only hair pre-
paration that kills the dandruff germ.
E. Dodd, Dickinson, N. D., says: "Herr
plclde not only cleanses the scalp from
dandruff and prevents the hair's falling
out, but promotes a new growth. Herpi-
cide keeps my hair very glossy."

FORECAST WORK
BENEFITS MANY
Weather Bureau Service
Making Substantial
Improvements.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.— The annual re
port of Professor Willis L. Moore, chief
of the United States Weather Bureau,
says that substantial improvements have
been made during the past year in the
weather bureau system of wireless'teleg
raphy. Such progress has been made by
the Government experimenters that, with
no interference by private systems, sta
tions can be successfully operated over at
least 150 miles of coast line, and are now
in operation along the Virginia and North
Carolina coasts,'- and aoon will be insti
tuted between the Farallon Islands and
the mainland and Tatoosh Island and the
mainland of the Pacific Coast.
The system of selective telegraphy he
regards as well demonstrated theoretical
ly, but had not been fully tested in prac
tice.
The report further says:
A eyEtem of merit and discipline has been
gradually developed ip the Weather Bureau,
which not only conforms to the letter of the
civil service law, but carries its spirit to a
logical conclusion. The system compels each
employe or official to work out his own official
salvation. It Is fair to all; it enables honest
and efficient persons to work themselves up
ward; It contributes to a high standard of
manly character and to efficiency In public
office, and it l»lds back those of mediocre ati
tainments or of slothful habits.
An important extension of the forecast
work of the bureau was made during the
year, whereby meteorological reports
from certain- points in the British Isles,
the continent of Europe and from the
Azores are transmitted to Washington,
and, with observations from Nassau, Ber
muda and Turks Island, are regularly
published on the weather maps, together
with forecasts of the wind and the state
of the weather for the first three days
out of steamera bound eastward.
In a number of instances when storms
of marked strength were passing east
ward off the American coast forecasts of
the weather which probably would be ex
perienced by steamers leaving European
ports westward bound were cabled to
England. Fog predictions are also issued.
Reports from steamers show that these
forecasts and other special warnings have
been verified.
The climate . and crop service of tho
Weather Bureau has been improved. Tho
cotton region service has been extended
into Oklahoma and the Indian Territory,
and arrangements have been made for be
ginning a similar work in California, to
be known as the fruit and wheat service.
NAVAL MILITIAMEN
PISCUSS FOSS BILL
Decide to Indorse the Measure, After
Suggesting Several Modi
fications.
NEW YORK, Dec. 8.— The Association
of Naval Militias throughout the United
States has just concluded here a series
of meetings at which discussions wefo
held on the bill introduced in Congress
by Congressman Foss of Illinois, which,
provides for the organization of a na
tional naval reserve. Connecticut, Mary
land, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jer
sey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and
California were represented, California
by Lieutenant Commander White. The
meetings were presided over by Captain
Miller of New York.
Lieutenant Commander Southerland
presented the views of the Navy Depart
ment with regard to the question, and
after some discussion the Foss bill wap
indorsed, with several modifications.
These modifications are on lines suggested
by President Roosevelt in his message.
Another subject considered was the
question of taking steps toward obtain
ing the abolishment of .tho rank of "navnl
cadet" in the navy and the substitution
in its place of the rank of mldshlpmani
but nothing definite was decided upon. ■

Federation Representa
tives Meet in Execu
tive Session.
SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 8.— Many dele
gates to the convention of the American
Federation of Labor, now in session in
this city, did not cease their activity de
spite the fact that this was Sunday. The
executive, council was in secret session
for several hours, but nothing was given
out for publication. , \
W. D. Mahon of Detroit, president of
the Amalgamated Association of Street
Railway Employes, waB in frequent con
ference with local labor leaders who are
directing the streetcar strike in this city.'
It is probable that Mahon and President
Mitchell of the mine workers will take
charge of the strike.
A delegation from the Allied Building
Trades of Philadelphia arrived here
during the day and held an interview
with Mahon on the street railway situa
tion in that city, where a strike is said to
be among the probabilities of the near fu
ture. The conferees desired a plan of con
ciliation by which nn attempt will be
made to bring together the Amalgamated
Association and the rival organization,
known as the Philadelphia Street Railway
Association.
The Metal Trades Federation held an
other meeting and discussed plans for
perfecting the organization. Nine of the
fifteen eligible metal trades unions in the
United States were represented.
. The American Federation of Labor con
vention will remain in session for th<j
next six days. Probably the most vital
question that will come before the con
vention is that of trade autonomy. The
brewery workmen and the mine workers*'
delegates probably will be the storm cen
ter on this question. Both of these trade
unions want Industrial autonomy, that is,
they advocate that all trades in one in
dustrial establishment should form one
organization for the better advancement
of the condition of all. They also, an
nounce that they will oppose trade auton
omy to the bitter end.
Nearly a dozen resolutions on the mat
ter of the exclusion of Chinese from tho
United States and island possessions are
In the hands of a special Committee. This
committee probably will report one reso
lution embodying all the- good points in
them. It will be also presented along with
one commending President Roosevelt for
advocating in his annual message the
continued exclusion of Chinese.
There has been no development in the
Gompers-Mitcbell Shaffer controversy,
which grew out of the strike. Diligent in
quiry failed to confirm the rumor that the
matter will be threshed out on the floor
of the convention. The principals of the
affair maintain an absolute silence.
At this time it seems reasonably certain
that all the present officers of the federa
tion will be re-elected.
Among the cities that have entered the
campaign for the next place of meeting
are Los Angeles and San Francisco. Port
land, Or., wants . the convention in 1905,
the year of its exposition. . ,•

SAYS MESSAGE
IS GREAT ONE
President Roosevelt's Ut
terances Are Highly
Commended.
Strong Sermon on Subject of
State Paper by Rev.
Dr. Coombe.
Patriotic services were held in the Rich
mond Congregational Church yesterday
morning. Rev. Philip Coombe, the pastor,
delivered a strong sermon on the subject,
"President Roosevelt's Message." After
referring to the significance of the con
vening of Congress, the pastor said:
I make no apology for taking this as a theme
for this morning's service, for this message
reads like a declaration of a Hebrew prophet
and lawyer and as if it were truly inspired.
The statement as to what should be done with
all known anarchists is like an expression of
divine law from Mount Sinai, spoken in the
name of Jehovah, and with the voice of God.
Elsewhere it ha3 the spirit of Moses and the
prophets or is like the sermon on the Mount.
It comes with authority divine and human and
With the authority vested in the author's own
excellence as a man, a leader, a Christian — as
one whose mind is in communion with the di
vine mind, who is spiritually instructed In the
deep things of God which have to do with this
nation's welfare. ,'
President Roosevelt has the right to tell us
about the things which ought to be done and
to eay they must be done. When he expresses
the demand for the development of high moral
character in private citizens and governmental
officials, in employers and employes he simply
points us in the direction in which, in his own
Strenuous life, he has led the way. In his ex
pression of the demand for the recognition of
moral excellence he only states what he himself
has always shown his readiness to honor.
In his demand for justice, justice toward the
enemies of government, and justice in the ad
ministration of the affairs of this nation, and
justice toward other nations and nationalities,
we would do well 'as a people to follow his
lead.
This nation Is not just toward other nations
when It relieves them of the proper duties
•which they owe to their own citizens. It is
binding -upon every nation, as It Is binding
upon every individual, to work put Its own
salvation with fear and trembling, God work
ing on that nation to will and to do his own
pleasure. Every nation, is under obligation to
give to its own children, to all who are born
under its flag, the blessings of life that we
enjoy. It is better for every nation to do this
than to thrust its burdens on other nations.
This nation will the better perform its own
duty to other nations as it maintains its own
national character and inspires other nations
to imitate its example. The Old Testament lifts
up its voice against the intermingling of pa
gans with a god-fearing people, and the New
Testament is equally explicit on the same ques
tion. The apostle to the pagans who was will
ing to go anywhere to uplift humanity de
clared on Mare Hill that God had "made of one
blood all nations of men to dwell on all the
face of the earth and hath determined the times
before appointed and the bounds of their hab
itation."
Let me ask you to read President Roosevelt's
message carefully, to pray for its originator and
to support him in hla position in every way
that you can as citizens of this great republic.
POLICEMAN REFUSES
TO MAKE AN ARREST
Timothy Muldowney Assaulted by a
Man in Saloon on Howard
Street.
Timothy Muldowney, 84 South Park, re
ported to the police yesterday that he had
been assaulted by a man in the Examiner
saloon, on Howard street, between Third
and Fourth streets, and that the man
later had threatened In the presence of a
policeman to shoot him. The policeman
refused to arrest Muldowney's assailant,
so Muldowney claimed. '
Muldowney's statement was that he
was in the saloon shortly after midnight
with a friend, and while having a drink
a woman came up to him and asked him
to "treat" her. He placed 10 cents on the
bar and jokingly remarked to the wom
an: "Why don't you wear a coat that nt3
you?" Just then a man stepped up to him
and struck him several times on the face
and head with his flsts. The barkeeper
interfered and the man attempted to
strike Muldowney's friend.
The man went- across the street to
Schmidt's saloon and Muldowney followed
him. The man put his hand in his hip
pocket and said: "If you move a step
farther I will kill you." There was an of
ficer present, but he refused to arrest the
man. Later Muldowney met Policeman
Mitchell and they searched different sa
loons for Muldowney's assailant but could
not find him. Mitchell ascertained, how
ever, that the man's name is Jack Gilles
ple.
Sergeant Mahoney was asked to make
an investigation as to the conduct of the
officer who refused to make the arrest,
and reported that no one attempted to
draw a revolver and that Muldowney was
looking for trouble and got it. The mat
ter will be further, investigated.

ENGINE CRUSHES
ELECTRIC CAR
Vehicle on the Sutro
Line in Collision
With a Train.
Passengers Are Scared, but
None Injured in the \
Accident
What might have proved a serious col
lision occurred at the corner of California
and Walnut streets at 3:30 o'clock yester
day afternoon. A locomotive attached to
a crowded train bound 'for Golden Gate
Park crashed into the rear end of a Sutro
electric car. and had it not been for the
slow motion of the . locomotive death
would, surely have resulted.
The accident appears to have been due
to the failure of the conductor of the
Sutro electric car to observe the rules re
specting the right of way at the crossing
named. It appears from all accounts that
the right of v/ay belongs to the locomotive
whenever cars of the electric line are ap
proaching the crossing. The locomotive,
in charge of Engineer A. Hawkins, and
the train, in charge of Conductors B. H.
Mason and F. Forner, pulled out of the
station at the regular time and ap
proached California street at a speed of
four mlle3 an hour. About the same time
car No. 29 of the Sutro line approached
from the east and crossed the switch
directly in tront of the oncoming locomo
tive.
Engineer Hawkins reversed his engine
when at a distance of twenty feet trom
the Sutro car, which had unaccountably
come to a stop directly on the crossing.
The collision could not be averted and in
the next instant the locomotive c^asheu
into the rear end of th.e car and smashed
the framework into fragments.
Both train and electric car were crowded
with passengers bound for the park and
Cliff House. The car, which was Injured
in the smashap, contained some fifty pas
sengers. The excitement attending the
collision was intense. Men shouted and
women screamed in terror. The car was
raised several feet from the ground, the
rear end resting upon the cow-catcher of
the locomotive. The -passengers made a
scramble for safety, but before they could
leave the car the locomotive had come to
a stop. The passengers on the train, be
lieving the collision had resulted in loss
of life, poured into the street with a view
to rendering such assistance as might be
required. Fortunately no one was injured.
The only result of the affair was the
frighenlng of all concerned and the in
fliction of some ?50 worth of damage to
the rolling stock of the Sutro Company.
Inquiry among the railway employes
last night developed a tendency to shift
the blame for the affair upon the con
ductor of the Sutro car. It was alleged
that if he had given the right of way to
the locomotive the collision would have
been averted. Even after having taken
the road in advance of the approaching
locomotive, it is claimed, he could have
prevented the wrecking: of his car by pro
ceeding on his way. Instead of doing so
he brought his car to a halt, thus inviting
disaster. The affair is under investiga
tion by the companies interested.
MEXICAN PRESS TAKES
UP PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
One Newspaper Says It Is Written in
an Arrogant and Vainglorious
Tone.
CITY OP MEXICO, Dec. 8.— La Patrie
(Liberal) warns the Mexicans that they
may not hope to look to Europe for help
against the North American aggression
so much talked of by the Clerical papers,
but adds: "We fear nothing from the
United States. That great republic
plants Itself on the Monroe doctrine and
that of peace in this hemisphere. The
United States offers as a pledge of Its sin
cerity the support they gave Mexico dur
ing her war with Napoleon III.
El Tiempo (Clerical) after waiting sev
eral days emits its opinion on President
Roosevelt's message, which it says is
Characterized by an arrogant and vain
glorious tone. Roosevelt is a politician
given to talk, whereas McKinley worked
more than he talked. McKinley was more
to be feared as a statesman and politician.
El Correo Espanola, an organ of the
resident Spanish colony, praises Roose
velt's message as being well written and
full of altruism and optimism.
