THE UNITED STATES BEHIND IN ITS INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL.
That the United States is behind Europe in general and Germany in par
ticular in the matter of its industrial schools is the opinion of a learned Ger
man scholar. Dr. Homan von Schurman, who has just returned to Berlin frfom
a visit to thi3 country. He has been studying the industrial schools and is
of the opinion that too much money is being spent in the aay school and not
of the opinion that too much oney is being spent in the day school and not
enough in the night school for the benefit of the junior apprentice.
"It is all very well," said Dr. Schurman, "to teach the small boy the ele
ments of manual training, but experience has shown that this primary teach
ing, given prior to the time when a boy decides upon his vocation, has very
little lasting effect.
"In six cases out of ten a boy will learn, we will say for example, some
thing in the woodworking line, and when he has spent two pr three years
and has a fair amount of practice, along with a great deal of theory, he will
go out and look for a position. He finds that it is possible for him to get into
the iron working business, where he has a friend who can get him a place,
but he does not know much about iron working.
"Now, it would have been much . better to turn that boy out of school
earlier, after he had finished his mental training, and let him get his position
in the iron shop. Then, if he could get the benefit of an apprentice's night
school, where he could take up the line of his chosen vocation, he could
make himself far more valuable to his employer, and he would have a
chance to rise easier and quicker from the bench to a more responsible
position. He would apply himself more closely at school because he would
be learning the theory of his schosen vocation, and he would appreciate that
he was getting along faster than the boys in his shop who were plodding along
content to slowly master what they could from their daily tasks." .
All of which is most excellent food for thought for those who are at the
head of our educational systems.
THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS GIVING.
IS BETTY GREEN HAPPY?
Item. A - plain old woman, wear
ing a dowdy black dress, with a slat
ternly appearing old hat tipped over a
shrewd eye and a cunning face.
That is a pen picture of Hetty Green,
owner of many millions, as she sits
at her private desk in the big bank she
owns in New York city.
Since the days of Russell Sage this
woman has mora ready cash to lend
than any other person in Gotham.
When taxes come in slowly and the
city authorities need money to meet
the heavy expenses they go to Hetty
Green for it and pay good Interest
for the short loan, you may be sure.
For. many years Hetty Green lived
in a cheap flat in Hoboken, Just across
the river from Manhattan, and paid
therefor a rental of $19 per month.
New York gasped when she gave tip
her flat and moved into the high priced
Plaza hotel. It did not last long,
though Hetty could have bought the
hotel and never missed the money.
She went back to Hoboken and tried
to rent the old flat, but it had been
leased. She is still looking for a flat
In that neighborhood.
You see, rents are cheaper and liv
Ine is cheaper in Hoboken. And the
grasping old woman pinches the nick
els closer than you or I.
She lives only to pile up extra dol
lars.
So far as known, Hetty Green never
gave away a dollar. It would be dif
flcult to make her believe in the beati
tude, "It is more blessed to give than
to receive."
Therefore it is almost superfluous to
Inquire whether, with all her dollars,
6he is happy.
Not necessarily. Dollars won by
commercial conquest may give to the
conqueror a certain species of satis
faction, but dollars cannot brin hap
piness. Happiness and dollars belong
to different worlds.
Wealth itself Is like salt water.
That is to say, the more you drink of
either the more you want.
And so this money mad little wo
man, at a time when she ought to be
dancing her grandchildren on her knee,
sits long hours in the bank. Besides
the bank which she controls, she has
many millions invested In real estate
and securities.
She denies herself the comforts de
manded by a twelve dollar a week
clerk and goes on squeezing out dol
lars.

Haa such a
Temper.
This is the season of the, year when Chri3tmas shopping is the cry, when
the Idea of present-giving occupifs the spare moments of those who are for
tunate enough to have loved ones fo give presents to. It isn't necessary to
call atention to the fact that it is not the value of the present given, but the
spirit in which it is given, that is the thing. It is this spirit, which, at its
best, must be properly felt before the idea of Christmas can be properly con
nected with the greatest religious festival in the world. There are altogether
to many sordid motives nowadays actuated in the giving of Christmas pres
ents. The spirit in which the little gift is given can make it transcendently
beautiful and valuable to the one who gives it and the one who receives it
The person who gives a present, expecting to get back what he paid for it,
or more, gets mighty little joy and satisfaction out of Christmas and the senti
ments that accompany it. Many people display selfish motives in their Christ
mas gifts and blacken the beauty of the day and all that it means. The little
gift with its accompanying sacrifice is dearer by far than the elaborate one
which costs the one who gives it nothing but money, whose loss he or she
will never feel. Make some one happy; don't try to make them satisfied
and if you cannot make some one you love happy, because of their selfishness,
make some poor person happy. . ..
A BIG FIGHT IS IMPENDING.
The wisdom of the members of the Gary bar in isolating themselves from
the Lake County Baf Association the other night may be questioned. When
the appeal is made to the Indiana state legislature in January for a superior
court at Gary, it will look extremely queer when the Lake County Bar Asso
ciation goes on record there as opposed to the project The spectacle of a
house divided within itself will be presented and how1 much Gary will get out
of it remains to be seen. It would have been much better to have compronr
ised and obtained something than to have left the meeting and obtained
nothing. The action of the Gary lawyers in withdrawing from the meeting
was both uncourteous and uncalled for. It is true that it was spectacular
and sensational; but it was highly impractical. That the Lake county law
yers, outside of Gary, are almost unanimous in saying. It is evident that the
fight to be, conducted from Lake county in the Indiana legislature this winter
at Indianapolis, will be a memorable one and one from which Gary will re
ceive an immense aount of valuable advertising, whether win or lose.
SOME GEOGRAPHICAL REFORM.
The extension of the civil service rules including a percentage of the
fourth class postmasterships Is being widely commented upon, but no con
vincing reason is given why the new order is applied to postmasters east of
the Mississippi and north of the Ohio, and not to similar postoffices outside
of these bounds. It has never been understood that the merit system de
pendede on geography. It will be difficult to persuade the south, for example,
that its exclusion is not due to recognition of the fact that to require applic
ants to pass examinations and to file satisfactory petitions from bonafide
patrons of the office, would in a majority of instances mean postmasters not

Nice Vlalt at Shntser's Shanty.
Our first visit of the season to Shatz-

fortunate enough to catch only those

Harry Peters of Lumber City arrived
and joined as in the camp. On Satur
day morning he and Mr. Shatzer tried
their luck at fishing, but no go. Mr.
Shatzer wore hia long rubber hip boots
constantly, so great is his fear of ser
pents. He also took with him to the
camp six pounds of brimstone and
huge chunk of limberger cheese. The
brimstone was for the purpose of driv
ing out gnats, spiders and mosquitoes,
as they are unusually plentiful this
year, no doubt owing to the excess of
moisture. At 7 o'clock on Friday even
ing, Shatzer made the stove red hot,
poked it full of wood, set it In an iron
kettle and into that be dumped the
brimstone, then closed all doors and
windows and got out. He said he was
going to raise h 11 and he did. He
also claimed that everything would run
that was in the shanty, and he was
right. A roll of good fresh butter run
