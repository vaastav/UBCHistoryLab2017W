THE PROPOSED CHARTER
AMENDMENTS.
The Sacramento Chamber of Com
merce has taken the initiative in the
movement for such changes in the City
Charter as experience has proved are
essential to good and economic govern
ment. This step is taken with entire
respect to the Board of Trustees, from
which must emanate the official sub
mission of any propositions of amend
ment. It is eminently proper that sug
gestions for amendment should come
from the people to the Trustees. The
latter then pass upon the same, or if
so minded refuse to consider them and
may<propose amendments of their own.
But such arbitrary proceeding on the
part of a municipal legislative body
as refusal to submit has but rarely
been known.
The Chamber of Commerce is a
broadly representative body, embrac-
ing mechanical, mercantile and general
business men, numbering now nearly
200. There is no other unofficial or
ganization so well fitted to inaugurate
such a movement. Since it is conceded
that there are serious and many annoy
ing defects in the charter it is simply
the part of wisdom to propose correc
tives, and we therefore anticipate no
difficulty in having such propositions as
are desired by the majority of the peo
ple passing the examination of the
Trustees, and by them being submitted
to vote. Indeed, it is the duty of that
body to give the people opportunity to
vote upon propositions petitioned for,
though some may not meet the views
'of individual members of the board.
As alternative propositions may be
submitted issue Is easily Joined on any
subject and the decision asked for from
the voters. Of these it requires the con
currence of three-fifths to adopt any
proposition. There is, therefore, no
danger -whatever of the people's rights
being Imperiled by the proceeding pro
vided by the Constitution. In this city
under the charter as it stands the ref
erendum is provided for, but the initia
tive is not given to the people. No
method Is provided for them to orig
inate any proposition whatever for sub
mission to the voters. The people, in
other words, have by the charter erect
ed a legislative body which, were it
wicked, conscionless and tyrannical,
can forever prevent any reformation of
the municipal organic law. Other cities
which were in that condition have late
ly changed to a system that permits the
people to take the initiative in reforma
tion of the laws. In the absence of such
legal provision here, nothing remains
to be done but by individual action, by
representative bodies of citizens, to set
on foot the necessary movement to me
morialize the legislative body.
We take it that when the Chamber
of Commerce is ready to begin the work
it has inaugurated it will proceed, as
was done before, in the open. The ses
sions of the committee in charge should
be field publicly and the people invited
to come before it and discuss every
proposition considered. It Is probable, in
deed, thatthe chamber will invite theco
operatlon and solicit the counsel of
organizations of a public or semi-civic
character, both industrial, business and
social, for we take it that the purpose
will be to interest the largest possible
body of public sentiment, and as many
individuals as possible, and all influ
ences having the welfare of the com
munity at heart, since there must be
enlisted affirmatively three-fifths of the
voting strength of the city to secure
any reformation of the organic act.
As we stated in these columns on
Wednesday, if there are changes ef
fected in the charter they should be
of a character and embracing spirit
that will render any further changes
unnecessary for decades of years. Char
ters, like constitutions, should be In
frequently- amended. They are funda
mental and should have that degrae
of permanency and unchangeableness
that will inspire confidence among the
people that there will not be frequent
upturning of the organic act, nor med
dlesome tampering with it. The Sacra
mento charter is now strongly guarded
in that respect; indeed, it is conceded
that it is too well fortified, since th?
people have deprived themselves of the
power to initiate amendment, but must
trust the initiative of any propositions
to a Board of Trustees, no one member
fit which represents all the voters of
the city. But that has been done, and
we have a situation in which it Is use
less to bemoan an error.
Fortunately there is every reason to
believe that a majority, if not all, of
the Trustees are themselves convinced
of the need for reform of the charter,
and that they will welcome an initia
tive such as is proposed as a wise and
convenient beginning of the considera
tion of a subject over which they have
in the end absolute and imperial con
trol.
Much nervousness has been experi
enced concerning the gallant soldier
General Young, who with but a handful
of troops has been pushing his way
up the west coast of Luzon and driv
ing the insurgents before him like
sheep. He has made some of the most
daring advances ever known in war,
has penetrated into sections of the
enemy's country, with but a few score
of troops, without sufficient supplies,
with inadequate trains and not such
provision for care of the sick and
wounded as could be desired. He was
thought to have been taking fearful
chances and doubtless did. He had not
been heard from for over a week, and
fears were entertained that he had
fallen into the hands of the enemy. The
dispatches now announce that he has
arrived safely at Vigan, and that ample
supplies will be forwarded to him by
water at once. He has gathered his
scattered forces and has now strength
sufficient to stand the enemy off if they
come out of the entrenched country and
attack him. Thus far he has met with
no defeat, but on the contrary with re
markable successes and has compelled
Aguinaldo to retreat with his remain
ing soldiery eastward toward Bangued
and the great central range of moun
tains which traverses the northern half
of the island from south to north.
Young has marched his little force now
nearly two hundred miles northward
over roads deemed impassable by
American troops, driving the enemy
back at every step, though in all cases
he has been outnumbered overwhelm
ingly. General Young is one of the
most gallant and determined cavalry
leaders in the army. He fought in the
war of the rebellion and won his spurs
splendidly. He will be remembered as
Lieutenant Colonel Young by a host
of friends in Sacramento, where he had
official residence for some two months
in 1894, at the time of the strike excite
ment.
THE JAMAICA TREATY.
Citrus fruit-growers of California are
alarmed over the treaty with Jamaica
which provides for 20 per cent, reduc
tion upon the present protective tariff
rate for citrus fruits. The several.
Chambers of Commerce of the State
are sending on petitions to the Senate
against the ratification of the treaty.
It was negotiated, it is understood, with
the idea that the citrus fruits of Ja
maica come into the Eastern market at
a season when they are not in compe
tition with California citrus production.
But the appeals to the Senate now
going on from California all set forth
the fact that our fruits and those of
Jamaica enter the Eastern market at
about the same time, and are in direct
competition. This is especially true of
Northern and Central California citrus
products, which are from four to six
weeks earlier than those of Southern
counties of the State. The question
therefore becomes one of first import
ance to citrus fruit interests of Cali
fornia. If the treaty is ratified the
Eastern marketing of our citrus pro
duction will be so handicapped as to im
peril the existence of the industry. The
appeals of the Chambers of Commerce
referred to are therefore timely, and
upon their reception will depend very
greatly the future of the citrus In
dustry. For if it is to continue to grow
at the present rate of progression, It
must be upon the expectancy wan-anted
by an Eastern market. That destroyed,
the Increase of the citrus fruit business
must cease, since the present orchard
growth yields far in excess of the de
mands of the home market, or any we
can hope to find in the Northwest.
Eight hundred bills have already been
introduced in Congress, but to this hour
it is not reported that so much as a
resolution has been offered in the line
of General Wheeler's suggestion, that
on the very day of assembling Con
gress ought to make expression that
it is the intention of the Government to
hold the Philippines and maintain our
authority there. Such declaration by
Congress, says General Wheeler, would
mean a great deal for the American sol
diers now battling in Luzon against the
odds of bad roads, insufficient cavalry,
insufficient food and an enemy that
skulks and ambushes, and refuses open
battle. It would mean the speedy de-
moralization of the Aguinaldo faction
which is held together only by the hope
and belief that the anti-expansion sen
timent is strong enough in the United
States to compel the Government to
abandon the Philippines, and that
therefore by continued resistance on the
part of the insurgents we may be
brought to abandonment of the archi
pelago. If Congress proposes to main
tain the position of the Administration
of President McKinley upon the Phil
ippine question, the sooner it so declares
the better. Such declaration will save
the lives of many American soldiers,
and put speedier end to the cost of the
war.

Stockton Record: The decision that
Lucy Hite was sufficiently the wife of
the wealthy miner to entitle her to di
vorce and alimony gives satisfaction to
most people. A man who will maintain
marital relations wfth a woman during
twenty years or more should •be man
enough to properly provide for her for
the rest of her life if he is able. That
Lucy is a squaw should make no dif
ference to the courts, since she was
good enough for Hite before he became
wealthy.
THE MESSAGE.
Fresno Republican: No more im
portant state paper has been presented
to the American people in this genera
tion than the President's message sent
to Congress Tuesday. As the official
chronicle of the most decisive year of
our later history and the forecast of
the new era which that year has be
gun, It Is a historical document of the
first rank, and is entitled to the care
ful consideration of every American
citizen. Even the parts which merely
recount the course of events familiar
to everyone are important, as bringing
these events together in one view and
correct relations, and especially as be
ing spoken with authority and absolute
knowledge. The confusion of conflict
ing accounts becomes order and sim
plicity in the President's lucid narra
tive, based as it is on sources of in
formation and discrimination such as
no other person could possibly have.
So, even the parts of the message
which are not interesting as news are
important as evidence.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
San Jose Herald: The President's
message, which we publish to-day, is,
as might have been expected, a strong
and able document. On the great
questions that are now interesting the
nation, it speaks in direct and impres
sive language. There Is no disposi
tion to dodge any issues. Some indeed
there are on which the Executive can
do nothing more than call the attention
of Congress to prevailing conditions
and urge action. Such a one is the
matter of trusts. The President real
izes the difficulty of the subject, owing
to the divided jurisdiction of Federal
and State authorities, but his sugges
tion for uniform State legislation in
connection with Congressional action is
practical and all that falls within his
province.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Stockton Independent: The annual
message of President McKinley is firm
in tone, broad in scope and humane in
temper. The President meets Congress,
and the American public with a spirit
of confidence that springs from a sin
cere conviction of right. The great
questions that are absorbing the at
tention of political parties and publi
cists are treated fearlessly, but with
excellent temper and judgment by Pres
ident McKinley and there is no evi
dence in the whole document that he
had evaded an issue or slighted a ques
tion of public interest. The conspicu
ous feature of all the public documents
emanating from President McKinley is
their deep earnestness and there is a
constant manifestation of this trait in
the annual message. It shows in al
most every paragraph a kindly inter
est in theiwelfare of all the people.
It was certainly expected that the
President would ask Congress to pass
some measure of currency reform and
his recommendation to fix the stand
ard so as to guarantee the parity and
value of each dollar of the money of
the people will meet the indorsement
of the Republican party and of the
country. That there are great differ
ences of opinion in both the parties as
to the best course to take in order to
reform and simplify the currency, pro
tect the treasury and maintain the
credit of the country is evidenced by
the fact that the Republicans of the
House and of the Senate have brought
in quite distinct bills. But it is prob
able that action will be very close to
the recommendations of the President.
THE PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE.
San Jose Mercury: President McKin
ley's message is worth a careful pe
rusal—if for no other reason, in ord a
to obtain a general world view of the
relations of the United States to other
nations. That there is nothing particu
larly new in the way of suggestions
will excite no surprise. The views of
Mr. McKinley upon almost all large
questions have come to be fairly well
understood by intelligent people, for the
President has taken pains to let it be
known that in recent foreign complica
tions he desired to be guided by the
opinion of the nation. And numerous
feelers have from time to time been
thrown out by members of the Presi
dent's official family to determine and
test public sentiment. The most pro
nounced views of the President, as ex
pressed in this long State paper, are
not calculated to excite great attention
beyond the fact that they are presented
in Mr. McKinley's message to Congress
and to the world. The policy of the
Administration as to Cuba, the Philip
pines Islands, to pensions, to the South
American Republics and the gold stand
ard, will be accepted by the Repub
lican party as a continuation and in
dorsement of political faith for which
the party has stood. All in all, the
message will be acceptable to the coun
try, and gives assurances of adherence
to those principles and practices under
which the marvelous prosperity of the
United States has been attained.
A DEMOCRATIC VIEW.
Stockton Mail: The President's mess
age, a long epitome of which is pub
lished on another page of the "Mail,"
is not a sensational document. In !t
the President was expected to take a
certain stand and make certain recom
mendations, and he has done as
pected. All of importance that he said
in the message had been well discount
ed. He recommended legislation es
tablishing the full gold standard, pre
cisely as outlined in the "'Mall" last
Thursday; he commends, without nam
ing it, the notorious Payne-Hanna sub
sidy bill; he announces the failure of
State legislation to control trusts and
recommends Federal action —a recom
mendation that is amusing in the cir
cumstances; he declares that the na
tion's promise to Cuba should be kept;
he makes some general reference* to
the undesirability of lynching; he sug
gests that Federal laws be framed for
the protection of aliens from mob vio
lence, with special reference to the kill
ing of those Italians at Tallulah, La.:
he points out the need of better laws
for Alaska, and suggests a similar sys
tem for the government of Porto Rico;
he notices a number of trifling incidents
and matters that seem out of place in
a President's message, unless it is to be
a sort of national diary*, and he says
nothing whatever about the dangerous
character of the treaty with Jamaica
that has been framed, and on the sub
ject of which energetic protests have
recently been sent to Washington from
California.
IMPORTANT DECISION.
Los Angeles Express: In the decision
of the United States Supreme Court in
the Addystone pipe litigation, it has
decided that restraint of merchandise
to be delivered across State lines is
restraint of interstate commerce. It is
obvious that this decision is one of im
mense importance in connection with
the question of the regulation of trusts
and combines. It is believed that it in
creases the powers of the General Gov
ernment over combinations.
AGAINST THE TRUSTS.
Santa Rosa Republican: The Supreme
Court of the United States has again
gone on record in favor of the people
and against an unlawful combination
of capital. Six companies composed the
cast iron pipe trust. They entered into
an agreement in 1894 under which
competition in business, so far as they
were concerned, was destroyed. By a
division of most of the territory of the
United States among themselves so
that each would have the business of
his district and an arrangement among
themselves as to the treatment of the
districts not allotted, they constituted
a very formidable trust. The particu
lars of the combine coming to the na
tional authorities, suit was instituted
by order of the Government of our
country. The United States District
Court decided against the Government,
but the case was carried to the Circuit
Court on appeal, and the decision of
the lower court was reversed. Then
the combine took the case to the Su
preme Court of the country. There
they met with signal defeat. The de
cision just handed down from that
body, the court of last resort in the
United States, is a complete victory
for the people, and an equally com
plete defeat for the combine. Our Su
preme Court is alike able and honest.
It has rendered many decisions in favor
of the people. In fact, it always ren
ders such decisions' when the laws of
the land can be so construed.
CHANGE OF LAW ASKED FOR.
Alameda Encinal: The Vacaville
"Reporter" calls attention to the evils
of frequent changes of Congressmen.
As it is now, it is thirteen months after
their election before they begin to serve,
and by the time that service begins
they are not only on the last year of
their term, but plans are beginning for
their displacement. This is poor en
couragement to try to do well, and in
asmuch as it takes at least a term to
gain efficiency in the service it will be
seen that the average one-term Con
gressman has little chance of making a
good record. —Pasadena Star.
True, every word. And in the case
of the Congressman from this district
there was actually a movement set on
foot for a successor before he had taken
his seat, and in face of the fact that all
the indications were that he would
prove an admirable official. Such con
duct verges upon political indecency.
The "Ants' Nest" of the West Indies
Midway between Cuba, Hayti and
Jamaica lie the extensive reefs and
shoals of the Formigas, which are sev
eral miles in extent and covered by a
small depth of water. These shoals
present a concentration of all the in
cidents to be found in West Indian
fringing shore reefs. Arborescent corals
and spreading millepores stretch on
walls and ledges, interspersed with
huge meandrinas and brainstones,
among which lodge a profusion of
Holothurias, starfishes, and a variety
of sponges. This great mass of reefs,
called from their clustering swarm the
Ants' Nest, or the Formigas, abound
with all sorts of fishes. As you ap
proach the great submarine plateau,
the odor of the slime and of the sperm
atic substances that find a resting place
in the crevices and shallow pools spread
through it is very remarkable — the
pleasant blandness of the sea breeze
suddenly changing to the nauseating
smell of a fish market. Those who
have waded on tropical shore reefs
know not only the strong scent given
out by the polyps that build there, but
feel how sensibly the hands are af
fected, and how the skin of the thighs
is susceptible of a stinging irritation
from the slightest contact with the
slime of corals. It has been found by
invariable experience that all the fishes
taken on the Formigas are pernicious;
that the barracudas especially are al
ways poisonous. Similar stretches of
shoals among the Bahamas produce
fishes deleterious as food.—J. M. Rog
ers, F. R. C. S., in Appletons' Popular
Science Monthly.
Company G's Bulldog.
Company Q of the Twentieth Kan
sas, enlisted at Coffeyville, is bringing
home a bulldog that was procured in
San Francisco before the regiment left
for Manila, It is related that on the
way over this bulldog repeatedly licked
the dog belonging to Captain Fred.
Buchan, and that the Captain appealed
to the master of the ship for protec
tion to his dog. The master proposed
to throw the bulldog overboard, but
every boy in Company G took the war
path and the master thought better of
his threat. The bulldog was on the
firing line with the regiment from first
to last, and the boys are able to re
late many amusing anecdotes of his
part in the Philippines conflict. W T hen
the company arrives in Kansas a draw
ing will be held to determine which one
of the boys is to keep $he dog as his
private property, and it is said that
the one who wins will regard It as a
very great honor. —Kansas City Jour
nal.
The President's Christmas.
Wagon-loads of gifts are received at
the White House at Christmas time.
They come from all parts of the coun
try, the majority of them from persons
unknown to the President and his
wife. These miscellaneous articles are
the private property of the recipients,
and the numerous parcels are placed
in one of the family rooms for exam
ination. They generally contain the
names of the donors, and to all these
notes of thanks are sent. On Christ
mas eve all the employes of the house—
the clerical staff, the ushers and the
domestic servants—are given through
the established munificence of the
President, a fine fat turkey. Fifty
fowls, selected from the best in the
market, are purchased for this event,
so that everybody about the famous
mansion has reason for rejoicing.—

Reasons Why the West Has Its
Own Characteristics.
Perhaps no saner explanation of the
genius of the West has been made than
that offered by Arthur L Street in
"Ainslee's Magazine," which reads:
"Merely spotted and stained with
habitation is the country across the
Missouri, and mdre particularly that
beyond the eastern line of Colorado.
Nearly one million two hundred thou
sand square miles—a third of the total
area of the union—with only four mill
ion population out of the grand Amer
ican census of seventy-seven millions.
Surely geology has done its work in the
Rockies and beyond. If there is breezi
ness that blows from scattered centers
to scattered centers, it is but logical.
If the politicians will assume tasks and
experiments, and presume occasionally
upon an abnormal capacity against the
world, as when a solid West votes for
silver, it is to be expected. The people
are used to long reaches and big move
ments and nervy undertakings. They
have- to be in order to get things done
at all. The closely knit power of the
East is supplanted in the West by an
expansive grasp and faith. It is a long
range adhesiveness, with the elements
of inspiration and mutual trust and
confidence in it. It is, chivalrous and
noble, because it is founded upon hon
est aspiration and broad fraternal sym
pathy. It takes victory with elation
and swallows defeat with determination
to have no more of it.
"Interesting as the land itself, even
interesting as the monstrous canyons
through which the Rio Grande Railway
j has constructed its marvels of engi
neering skill to afford pleasure to the
sightseer, are the marks which popula
tions have left upon the surface. Many
of them stand like the ruined cities of
ancient nations, less venerable only be
cause less ancient, but equally fruitful
in suggestions of history, equally preg
nant with memories that concern men.
Beginning with the border of British
Columbia and running continuously
southward to the Rio Grande, these
landmarks remain. Deserted forts and
trading stations they are in the far
north, where the Hudson Bay Company
made fortunes in furs long before
American agriculturists or miners
stepped out of their Eastern homes. De
caying haciendas and adobe villages
and towns that seem old even by name,
as Tucson, in Arizona, £re on the far
southern border. The huge cavities and
indentations which the placer hose
washed In the foothills of California re
semble abandoned acropoles, or some
times inspire one with the belief that
some giant prehistoric race has left
its work of reconstructing the earth's
surface unfinished. In latter years the
people have gone back over most of the
landmarks in Colorado and rehabltated
them; but about such places as Ko
komo, at the head of one of the so
called parks, where once the overland
and the gold-seeking trains crossed the
mountains, there is an ineffable atmos
phere of dreariness and desertion. The
toil to reach the point—even the toil
for the railroad—is so great that the
instincts of admiration assume propor
tions of amazement and wonder at the
pluck of the pioneers and their brazen
hardihood in venturing into such lofty
wildernesses in order that generations
to follow them might be richer and that
the destiny of the nation might be pur
sued.
"The mountains that lie eastward of
the Great Salt Lake, and through which
the Union Pacific twined its way, first
among the transcontinental railroads,
are marked in places unnumbered with
the signs of sturdy thrift and humble
religious obedience, where the Mormors
worked out their incomes in building
the railroad for which the leaders of
the church had taken the contracts of
construction.
"Some day the people of the West
will themselves hunt out and consecrate
to history these remnants md relicts
of the places in which once they hoped
to thrive, and from these points as be
ginnings the future historian will pro
ceed to analyze the character of the
sections of the nation in which they
lie."

in the British Museum, and cost over
3.000 guineas. One thousand guineas
was the price given by the late Alfred
Morrison of Carlton House Terrace for
an autograph letter written by Marie
Stuart to the Archbishop of Ouise. This
and two other letters (one to the Pope
and the other to the King of France)
were written by the unfortunate Queen
of Scots on the morning of her exe
cution. The letter to the French King
was destroyed during the days of the
Terror, while that to the Pope is still
preserved at the Vatican. The well
known bookseller, Bernard Quaritch,
gave £1,000 for an autograph of Co
lumbus, which was exhibited at the
World's Fair at Chicago. A Chicago
autograph dealer is said to have offered
to give $100,000, or over £20,000 for a
genuine autograph of Shakespeare if
brought to him within a year of mak
ing his offer. It was a safe bluff, for
since the tragic fate of Chatterton, no
forger has cared to tackle the quaint
scrawl of the Bard of Avon.—Collier's
Weekly.
The Girl's Own Room.
Every girl loves her own den. There
is an air of independence about it that
is charming. A girl with a den has a
place which is all her own, and where
she can shut herself in or invite her in
timate friends to help her enjoy it. All
of her artistic tendencies work out in
the decoration of this den. A girl I
know was recently given a small room
to do us she liked with, says a corre
spondent, and which' had been made
ugly by an old black marble mantel in
one corner. She took up the wornout
carpet and had the best parts of it
made into a woven rug, stained the floor
around the border, hung up fancy bead
portieres, arranged all of her pictures
on the walls in artistic confusion, made
up a dozen pillows for her couch In
one corner, and filled in other spacer
with writing table, tea table, lamp
stand and various other knicknacks.
But the mantel troubled her, until she
conceived the idea of covering the whole
thing up, and called in a carpenter. He
arranged a series of shelves, with a di
viding partition in the center of the
lower part and a long shelf over the top
of the mantel Itself and another a foot
below the top. On one side were shal
low spaces and on the other side deep
places in which she found it conveniint
to arrange her collection of old and
new fancy dishes and bric-a-brac. The
space over the mantel was papered
with a red velvet paper for a back
ground for odds and ends of pictures
and placques.
The fed velvet paper extended over
the lower part of the mantel, hack of
the shelves, and a Roman striped piece
of silk was draped across the top shelf
and hung in folds at either side. A
small tabourette held an Oriental jardi
niere filled with ferns on one side and
a palm finished the other end. No one
ever suspects this artistic corner was
once an ugly fireplace and an old man
tel.—Pittsburg Dispatch.
A Story About Villmessant.
The discovery by the Paris police of a
skeleton in the cellars of the hotel of
M. Vlllmessant, the founder of the "Fi
garo," brings back to my mind a story
told me by Aurelien Scholl. Villmes
sant was one of those men that car
ried an unfailing wit under the most
aerious of countenances. He had ap
plied to the Western Railway Com
pany for four press passes to Dieppe,
and arrived at the gate with his two
friends and leading his little son by
the hand. The official looked at the
child, and said, "But, m'sieu, he can
not be a Journalist!" Villmessant
scowled at him, and replied, "Do you
know whom you are addressing?" The
man tremblingly admitted that he did
not. "That young gentleman, sir, ..is
the distinguished Editor-in-Chief of the
'Enfants' Chronicle,' published weekly,
at the price of a penny, with a sub
stantial reduction if you take it for one
year." As he clipped the ticket that
official looked as though he had organ
ized a cyclone and got in front of it.—
