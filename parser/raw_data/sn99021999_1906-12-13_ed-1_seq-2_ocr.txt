such plant and that the company proposes
to continue to offer to the taxpayers of the
city of Omaha the opportunity of taking
Advantage of the modern paving propor
tion and It Is hoped that the legislature
this winter will see fit to amend the charter
so that bltulithlc pavement may be allowed
,to enter In free competition with other
'pavement upon Its merits.
Mr. Warren stated that they had con
tracts for over 1,000,000 yarda of paving for
next spring, with a prospect of the largest
buslnesa ever done by them. He la also
firmly of the opinion that Omaha offers an
unusually large . field for their kind of

The opposition to Messrs. Moody and

senate by a number of democratic senators,
was not' rtrotigly pressed ' at the session
today and no' roll call was asked. On the

ever, there were' a number of negative
votes on the minority side, estimated at
about fifteen.

"It is the present Intention to .have Mr.
Cortelyou take charge of the treasury
portfolio .March 4," said Senator Aldrlch,
who talked with the president today about
Mr. Cortelyou's nomination to be secretary
of the treasury, which was held up by the
senate finance committee because no date
was specified as to when the appointment
would become effective.
It haa been customary heretofore, the
senator said, to specifically indicate the
date upon which such appointments are
to take effect and its omission in the pres
ent cse apparently was an oversight. B-
far as ho was aware, the senator said.
there is no objection to Mr. Cortelyou's
confirmation, nor to others now pending.

Senator Aldrlch and the president the nom

AFTEIt TYPHOID "
The Iusattable Appetite Most Be Care
folly Watched.
An attack of tyi hold feyor usually leaves
one with an enormous appetite. The wasted
body cries out for food material to repair
the toss of body tissues.
If care is not used, the weakened diges
tive organs may be overwhelmed before
they have become strong.
There' Is no food that has the tlssue
bulldlng and energy-producing qualities
equal to Grape-Nuts.
This food is picdigested-the organs ara
relieved of the necessity of digestion If it
la concentrated-affording much nourish
ment with little bulk; contains ail the ei
sentlal food elements for repair and energy.
It Is therefore valuable under conditions of
health as well as cortvalesence.
A Calif, young lady learned the truth
about Grape-Nuts. She writes:
"About four years 'ago I had a severe
attack of typhoid fever. After recover
ing I had a wild- longing for food which
nothing seemed to satisfy.
"I tried the best of everything, but waa
always Weak and hungry. A change to a
milder climate did not mend matters food
did not agree with me.
"A friend persuaded me to try O rape
Nuts. To my great surprise I did "not ex
perience that hungry feeling between meals.
It waa a great relief and I kept on eating
it with great benefit.
"Orape-N'uts not only relieved that wild
craving for food, but made me atronger
In mind and body relieved the old head
aches, weakness, strengthened my nerves
so that I- waa easily able to do my work.
"I have never tired of Grape-Nuts as one
doea of most cereal foods. My friends were
so . surprised at my Improved condition
after eating Grape-Nuts regularly, that
many have benefited by my experience."

CIVIC FEDERATION MEETS
Conference at Ntw lark Pitcnuti Govern
ment bj Injunction an4 Child Labor.
OPENING ADDRESS BY AUGUST BELMONT
rrrsldent of Kinder of Katlaaal
Organisations to Appolat Com
mittee to Investigate Child
Labor Situation.
NEW TOnK, Dec. lZ-The National
Civic federation began Its fifth annual
meeting at the Park Avenue hotel today.
There were about 200 persons present, In
cluding a number of leading men In com
merce, Iarxr, the professions and other
walks of life.
The meeting was called to order by Au
gust Belmont, the president. In an address
Mr. Belmont viewed briefly the two topics
for discussion at the-first day'a session,
namely, -"Child Lalwir" and "Government, by
Injunction." The discussion of the two
questions, which folhrwed, waa participated
In by a number of men well qualified to
speak thereon.
The annual banquet of the association
was held nt the Park Avenue hotel tonight.
The meeting will be continued tomorrow.
Aan-ust Uelmoat Presides.
August Belmont, president of .the federa
tion, In his opening address urged the ap
pointment of a committee to investigate the
problems growing out of the accumulation
of great fortunes. This subject will be con
sidered tomorrow. "No subject will bring
greater good to this country if correctly
solved," said he, "or greater harm if, for
wise and Just taxation, punitive spoliation
and the destruction of our boundless spirit
of enterprise through hampering regulations
be substituted." '
"Government by Injunction" was char
acterised by Mr. Belmont aa "another burn
ing subject to be discussed." He said he
was not sure that President Roosevelt's
proposition for compulsory Investigation of
industrial disturbances in advisable. He
doubted the wisdom of such Interference,
but the greatest Justification for such
policy would be In the case of quasi public
corporations.
Mr. Be-lmont also called attention to that
portion of President Roosevelt's message
wherein the president denounced the effort
to prohibit all combination of capital.
Government by Injunction.
The federation then took up government
by Injunction. CarJ Spelling, general at
torney for the American Federation of La
bor, said that In labor disputes Judges have
sent foi . decrees which were special leg
islation and have paralysed and rendered
abortive all the efforts on the part of tho
labor side of that dispute. An injunction.
he said, should never be granted except to
protect property or property rights.
He declared that It was seldom that
strikers ever resort to actual violence, but
they frequently appoint committees to help
the police preserve order.'
The speaker said the Paree bill, which li
before the congress, embodies the proper
and legitimate demands of organized labor,
Walter Drew, commissioner of the Na
tlonal Iron Erectors association, In replying
to Mr. Spelling, replied that the latter's
argument was fallacious in that It went
to prove that Injunctions should not Insu-
in any case, while he Sought to prove that
they should Issue to protect nothing but
purely physical property and physical prop
erty rights. .
Mr. Drew said that "separated from any
question of defect in the law or Its ad
mln'stratlon, the demand that temporary
Injunctions should not Issue In labor con
troversies because a demand that the prac
tice . of our courts shall be changed to
I grant special immunity and privileges to
; one particular class openly and avowedly
engaged In warfure with another class.'
Child Labor Question.
Samuel tacCune Lindsay, secretary of the
national child labor committee, said
was Impossible to e- t,gcrate the real ex
tent or the real cvi. of child labor. H
believes that other forms of legal protec
lion than absolute prohibition are aeeded
for the greater part of the 2,000,000 chll
dren between the ages of 10 and IS, now
engaged In gainful occupations. Recent re
ports show that the number of children i
in
specially harmful occupations is lncrutfr'.ni
luster than the population.
Mr. Lindsay said the BeveridgelParsons
bill, recently Introduced in congress for
national child labor law, would cut the
heart out of the child labor evil at a single
blow.
Mr. Mitchell said In part) "We want now
to change the law so that there children
can play before ever they are obliged
go to work. Thousands of boys went
work when they were 8 years old; many
others between 10 and 12. 1 regret that th
operators, while trying to raise the stand
ard have seen fit to fight the educational
conditions."
John Gulden,1 president . of the Textll
Workers of Fall River, istated that when
some four years ago, he was commissioned
by the American Textile Workers of
America to study the conditions In South
Carolina, and he contemplated visiting a
certain mill, was warned from doing so
by the statement that the owner had
sworn to shoot the first northern man that
came down there- Interfering With his help.
Mr. GomperB, the last speaker, Said that
when he sent James Leonard of New Or
leans to one of the towns of Mississippi,
for the purpose of trying to make an In
vestigation of the conditions of the cotton
operatives there, Leonard was quietly In
formed that unless he left the state at
once he would be escorted to the state
line by the police.
"One of the representatives of the city
government, I believe the mayor," added
Mr. Gompers, "appointed a gentleman to
entertain Mr. Leonard on the train on his
way to beyond the border of the state."
A resolution was adopted providing that
the presidents, the NatlonnI Association of
Manufacturers, the American Federatl
of Labor, the General Federation o:
Women's Clubs, the National Educational
association, the National Economic asso
ciation, the "Nations! Conference of Chari
ties and Corrections and the National Child
Labor committee be Invited to name seven
members to act with a like committee of
the National Civic Federation aa a com
mission to make a thorough investigation
of the whole subject of child labor In the
United States.
Charles A: Moore, president of the New
York City Federation, presided at the ban
quet this evening.
Archbishop Ireland, In a speech said,
In
.1
part:
This Is an American Institution. If this
meeting that we have witnessed today had
taken place in any country of llurop
there would have been a riot before ht
n-.eetfna; closed, and when one man would
stand up and contradict another the other
would at -once have challenged hi mto a
duel. This Is one of the beautiful efTet.ts
of our American democracy. No one be

every point, and he Is willing to grant to
his neighbor h right of nylng his win

Other speakers Included Oscar Strauss
and Edwin Mark ham, who talked on "Child
