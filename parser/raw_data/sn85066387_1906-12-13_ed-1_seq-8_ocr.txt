OFFICIAL CORPSE AND PUBLIC SCANDAL
OXE observes with a certain amusement, tempered by unavail
ing resentment, that the wholesale merchants and shippers
of San Francisco have discovered the State Railroad Commis
sion. The'amusement is provoked by the useless activity of
the merchants, and the resentment by the long continued neglect of
duty by the commission. This astonishing official body takes itself
easily and discharges its single function of drawing salaries with
conscientious regularity. It is true that the State constitution de
votes a whole chapter to prescribing duties to be performed by the
commission, but all these are ignored by the Commissioners with a
generous indifference. If some foolhardy citizen prods the official
body into momentary activity the commission yawns collectively,
turns over and goes to sleep again until salary day.
A curious and doubtless impertinent inquirer once asked the
president of the commission, Mr. Orrin Henderson, why the body
had not undertaken its duty to revise freight rates in California,
and Mr. Henderson, who is an "honest blacksmith" between salary
occasions, laid down the law and the programme like this:
"The commission," said Mr. Henderson, with a happy smile,
"are not detectives. If any man will file a complaint with us it will
In view of the fate of complainants in the past, that. was not
encouraging. Mr. Henderson has been left free to pursue his honest
trade for four years. Mr. Adam Andrew was not disturbed in his
profitable devotion to soda water, and Mr. A. C. Irwin lived jn Marys
vine, which is an occupation by itself, and good value to the tax
payers of California for $4000 a year. Mr. Judson Brusie, the secre
tary, was left to pursue his literary labors in the construction of the
barnyard drama in, which a mooley cow takes the role of heroine
and cocks and hens and other domestic^animals perform feats of
Brusie's imagination. For which Mr. Brusie was paid $2400 a year
by the State.
All these men were, and are, creatures of William F. Herrin,
chief counsel for the Southern Pacific. The new gang that takes
office at the beginning of the year is of precisely the same stripe.
Theodore Summerland is the choice of Walter Parker* Herrin's chief,
lieutenant. Wilson of this city is one of Herriri's handy men.
Irwin is re-elected. The cost of the commission for salaries and
office expenses is, in round figures, $16,000 a year. That sum haY
been regularly drawn for twenty-five years, and there is not a'dol
lar's worth of service to show for it all.
The existence of the commission is a gross public scandal:
There is no State in the Union so much cursed b} r railroad exactions
and secret rebates as California. Commissioner Garfield's report
on the petroleum-carrying trade shows how complete is the system
of rebates granted to the Standard Oil trust between State and in
terstate points by the Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe. There is
no law against rebates on State business, but if the Commissioners
had done, their duty these criminal practices would v have been ex
posed in such a way as to compel legislation.
The prime object held in view by Mr. Herrin's Commissioners
has been to keep such things dark. They have operated as a screen,
and not a searchljght.- We have no expectation that things will be
different in the near future, and the abolition of the commission by
constitutional amendment seems desirable unless the merchants be
lieve they can put life under the ribs of a 'corpse. Their, complaints
should really be addressed' to Mr. Herrin. Just ask him to reform
himself. - .
OUR MUNICIPAL INCAPABLES
x^/^f OD send us men" fs*the cry of an Eastern writer. .The
I afflicted city of San Francisco might echo that prayer with
\JT sorrowful reason. Here we are, seven months after the
fire, and the miserable crew to whom the government of
the city is entrusted have no time for anything but to hunt their
holes to escape the punishment they so completely deserve. For six
\u25a0 months after the fire they were so busy with schemes of lar
ceny that they could give no time to the city's needs. In the
seventh month they are inventing plans to outrun the constable.
/ Look at the streets and their neglected condition, the ruined
public buildings untouched since the fire, a picture of desolation and
municipal incompetence. For one who loves San Francisco it is
melancholy and discouraging to see the city 'struggling to her feet,
but held in the clutches of a useless, crooked crew of incapables,
most of whom ought to be in jail.
For instance, it is estimated that San Francisco property holders
will pay an increase of $3,500,000 for insurance against fire for the
present year, as compared with rates prior to April. . That huge in
, crease of burden will continue as long as the protection against fire
'is inadequate. The need of an auxiliary water system for this pur
pose has been impressed time and again on the Supervisors arid 3 the
Mayor . by property owners, the underwriters and the Fire Depart
ment, but not the first step has yet been taken to supply the need!
What useful work can you expect from men who are busy trying
to keep out of jail? -- I"
IMPROVED MAIL SERVICE WANTED
BUSINESS men in San Francisco hope that the railroads will
quickly see their way clear 1 to resume the -eastbound fast r raail

was abandoned some time ago was : riot only a- great Vcop- 5

interest for bankers and merchants. The adjustment of modern
business is so accurate that the difference of a day'fnakes itself felt.
The railroads are understood to be willing to resume this service
as soon as postal conditions in San Francisco become more settled
so as to permit the collection of a larger quantity of mail in time for
the fast train. We are convinced that they could afford to resume
the service at once as a favor that would be appreciated by the
business community of San Francisco. Their other mail contracts
are exceedingly profitable, and it is just that they should take the
rough with the smooth where the object to be gained is important.
We believe that on proper representations to 'the railroad officials
they will see the propriety and expediency of compliance with the
wishes of the local business community.

State Press Discusses the
Japanese School Case
FOR the moment what the President
says concerning the question of the
right of Japanese; to all the privi-
leges In the public schools which
are enjoyed by the children of Amer
ican citizens Is of paramount Import
ance, but, the high stand he takes upon
that issue is but the continuation of-hia
views- upon" every- other public mat
ter. He says boldly, and no doubt
meant ; to say it vehemently, that the
treatment the people of San Francisco
are according 1 the Japanese In the mat
ter of -public school privileges "is the
sure mark of a,; low civilization, a low
morality.? He calls the act of the
School Board in shutting Japanese stu
dents out of public schools which white
children attend a "wicked absurdity."
More is | the pity that the President Is
not more expHcit It would be inter
esting, to know if he meant that the
moral standard of the public schools of
California Is alreadj too low to be low
ered further by having the low code of
morals of the Japanese twined about it.
Such a meaning may be given to his
words without violating a Just interpre
tation of them. — Berkeley Gazette.
It would take at least seventeen
Roosevelts, backed' by the army and
navy, to force the people of California
to consent to the President's Idea con
cerning ' the Japanese and our public
schools.^ — Napa Journal.
. •— ./ •\u25a0 \u25a0 .. .
The strenuous Roosevelt will have to
back down from the position he . has
taken, and he will. back down long be
fore sentiment In California will
change. All the President's talk about
the Japanese's rights under treaty is the
merest rot,- about on a par with the
demagogic roar . of professional agita
tors, that the Japanese are running out
white labor, when there is not enough
of that or similar form of labor in the
State by a hundred thousand. — Hol
lister. Advance.
The people -of California can afford
to treat President Roosevelt's amiable
weakness" for the Japanese as a matter
more to be pitied than condemned, be
cause he is talking about something
of which he knows nothing. But when
he contends In his blustering way that
the Japanese contention Is right and
should be sustained, even If it required
the armed force of the Federal Gov
ernment, he provokes the same spirit
of contempt that one displays to the
bluffer, and forfeits the respect of the
people of California, whom he threat
ens with armed Interference. • \u25a0 • *
The President is wrong and the best
thing he can do junder the circum
stances is to gracefully admit his error
and submit to being placed right by
the representatives of the people of
California, who have a decided advan
tage over Mr. Roosevelt in that they
have studied, the question involved at
close range. \ Calif ornians ape In close
touch wjth the Japanese immigrants,
and the contact has not served to raise
the little brown man in the public
estimation.- — Watsonville Register.
The President is quite Intemperate in
his argument and conclusions and more
than Intemperate In the language that
cannot be accepted) other than as
menace. • • • "We have not de
barred the -Japanese from our public
schools. Far.from'it, we have,- in rec
ognition :of * the age disparities and of
the'lnevitablei conflict 'between 'the' Oc
cidental ' and "the i Oriental nationali
ties, provided separate schools for these
aliens. • *. • Our estimable President
has certainly applied the "big stick"
this time to California, and he ha*
raised a hornet's nest about his ears
that he will not hear the last of in the
course of his future career. — Modesto
Herald.
. President Roosevelt cannot force the
people of the Pacific Coast to accept his
views In this matter any more than he
could force the people of Arliona to
accept statehood' with New Mexico.
They admire his character.' recognize
his honest worth, admit the nobility of
his motives arid honor his courageous
sense of public duty, but — and from. this
they will not budge — they know their
own. business better than the Presi
dent and appreciate the situation with
Its responsibilities, penalties and dan
gers far more keenly than he can. The
Japanese: will be protected in all their
personal and property rights, but they
will not" be admitted to citizenship nor
social equality. That's flat — Oakland
Tribune. ' • „>..-
•' Roosevelt maybe able to Induce Con.
gress Ijto pass a law providing for the
naturalization* 'of the Japanese, al
though that Is extremely- doubtful, but
all of the i forces at his command can
not make the people of this State ad
mit the Japanese to the same schools
that are attended , by .: white . children.

If President Roaevelt had exercised
one-tenth the diplomacy toward San
Francisco he manifested toward Japan,
the whole matter could have been com
promised in peace and dignity. We
cannot but feel that the violence of the
whole assault on San Francisco Is
wanton and uncalled for. But we are
also confident that the extreme Callfor
nlan view of the Oriental question can
not be applied to. the Japanese, with
the consent of the rest of the nation,
and that If we insist too strenuously on
it we may risk alienating sympathy
with our Chinese policy also. The whole
thing is a muddle of obstinacy on both
side* Would it had not occurred: —

Indeed be forced to the conviction that
the President has not exempted him
self from the general misinformation
prevailing In the East as to the basis
for our sentiment In this matter. Its
depths or its earnestness." The Presi
dent has deajt with this matter im
petuously; he has argued from wron#
premises, and he has reached wrong
conclusions. To. speak of California's
deliberate and conscientious attitude
In excluding the Japanese from her
public schools as a "wicked absurdity"
is inconsistent with the Judicial and
well-informed utterances that should
emanate from a President of the
United States, and to treat California
in general as though J^e were ani
mated by a merely stupid and reason
less race prejudice, to scold her as a
needless fomentor of racial discords
and to threaten her with force Is not
only a gross injustice but It represent*
one of the least admirable and the least
lovable aspects of the President* »
character. — Sacramento Union.
The message of President Roosevelt
to Congress contains many recommend
ations that will meet with the hearty
approval of the people of the United
States. His recommendations on the
Japanese problem, however, will meet
with strenuous opposition by tha
Western Congressmen and the people
of the entire Pacific Coast. The people
of California will never consent to the
naturalization of the Japanese, placln?
an alien race on an equality, politically,
with themselves. President Roosevelt
has entirely misjudged the Japanese
situation in California when he makes
such recommendations as are con
tained In his message. — Pomona Pro
gress.
The President will find few sympa
thizers in California with his position.
The mixing of brown and white races
In the schoolroom is alt well enough to
preach about by those out of reach of
Its effects, but It will never be accepted
as the correct thing to do by the p«o
ple of California. It Is easy enough for
President Roosevelt, on the Atlantic
coast, to K criticise the parents of San
Francisco for objecting to their children
sitting beside a Jap in- the schoolroom.
but we believe he. would take another
view of the case if his little "Teddy"
was placed in the position of the San
Francisco children. — Xapa Journal."
The entire manner in which the Pres
ident handles the subject Is Irritating.
He apparently places the ."wicked ab
surdity" of excluding Japanese young
men from schools attended by Ameri
can children in the same category with
those rare acts of violence toward
Orientals which he very properly de
nounces. And yet if the President un
derstood the situation In California h#
would know that the very parents who
most strongly object to their little boys
and girls being herded at scnool with
grown Japanese youths would ba the
first to demand punishment of any acts
of violence to Asiatics or other for
eigners. . • • • xot less irritating is
the plain threat which the President
makes when he declares that "all of
the force!', military and civil, of tha
United States which I may lawfully
employ will be so employed." This
language Is uncalled for. • • • It will
be . time . enough to talk about using
force when it is shown that the San
Francisco board has acted illegally
and purposes to continue so to act.
President Roosevelt would have dona
better to omit that part of his mes
sage. — San Diego Union.
President Roosevelt may soon dis
cover that the Japanese gun he is han
dling is loaded and that it Is a kicker.
While It is true that be Is a very big
man. he is not big enough to run tha
school system of California, and tha
sooner he makes this discovery the
quicker will he get his hands out of
trouble that Is largely of his own mak
ing". — Santa Rosa Republican.
Roosevelt has made a serious mis
take, but Congress will not follow in
bis error. If it is Roosevelfs idea to
placate the Japanese it la a case -of
misdirected good will. The Japanese
will take, all that can be coaxed or
cajoled, and to temportze with them la
to invite trouble.. A diplomacy marked
by firmness and American common
sense is what is needed in the present
instance.— Santa Barbara Press.
The question of excluding the Japa

laws : in accordance with it where tha
Federal . Government can in any way
interfere in this matter. • •... • That
we should make some provision for
the education ;of Japanese students.
young or old. of a proper and efficient
character, is unquestionable. • ' • • On
the other hand, there, is no doubt "that
grave reasons do exist why the Jap
anese pupils should- in numerous in
stances be excluded from close asso
ciation in the public schools with white
children. • • • But tha main thing . Is
that if some general rule is made ap
plicable to all _ pupils "^attending th
schools the Japanese Government will
have no cause for complaint.— Los An
