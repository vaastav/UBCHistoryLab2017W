I THE ISSUE MADE PLAIN.
Tharo has boou nothing more refresh
ing since the agitation on the absurdly
high prices enforced by certain com
bines in this city against tho consumers,
than tho letter of tho Jensen Cream
ery company to Governor Cutler. In
that letter the creamery company seems
to assume the onus and responsibility
of all the ovils complained of; from
tho alleged working over of second and
third rato butter from the East and
putting it out as fresh butter, hoiuo
made, etc., to the price of turkeys. In
thus stepping into the breach, the Jen
sou Creamery company assumes a role
that would indicate its close connection
with all of (he influences which have
made such an abnormal and oppressive
rise in the prices of the necessities
of life in this city.
This is recognized fully by Governor
Cutler, to whom tho Jensen Creamery
company addressed its letter. The
The "ivernor makes no limitation as
to the .csponsibility of the Jensen
Creamery company, any more than the
company itself assumes in writing to
him. Tho Governor places iho matter
of investigation on tho broad lines of
' 'charges made in newspapers as to
the existence and operation of a com
bination of dealors in food stuffs."
And the Governor replies to tho cream
ery company's suggestion of a com
mission to be appointed b himself,
to .investigate tho wholo subject,
that the better way would bo to have
the mattor referred directly to the Com
mercial club. This suggestion of the
Governor's seems to us to bo pertinent
and wise; and certainly if the Commer
cial club takes up the investigation,
no commission that the Governor might
bo able to appoint could do better.
At the same time, the Governor ad5
dresses an official letter. to. Mr, John
Peterson, State Food and. Dairy Com
missioner, to mako thorough investiga
tion as to tho allegation that the cream
eries arc bringing in inferior butfor'
from the East, working it over, and
putting it out here as "fresh butter
right from the creamery.5' Tho Governor
very properly says that auy one doing
this is guilty of "an act which is not
only1 fraudulent in itself, but which
strikes at tho purity and freshness of our
food supply and the health of tho peo
ple' and is therefore worthy of "noth
ing less than the fullest and severest
penalty." The Governor s injunction
to the State Food Commissioner to pro
ceed with diligence and energy in this
matter 3s certainly to be commended.
It appears from representations from
tho southern part of tho State that the
Jensen Creamery company is engaged
in the monopolistic enterprise of "buy
ing aud closing the creameries of the
State as fast as possible," in order to
create a monopoly which will enable
that company lo control the prices and
hold up the people for greater pay
ments than they should bo called upon
to mako for the butter, cream, etc.,
that they must neccssarib' use. The
Salina Call expressly states, on the rep
resentation of Mr. C. M. Hanson, man
ager of the local ercumcry, that tho
Jensen Creamery company is closing
out .local creameries, as stated, and
with the effect of boosting prices and
giving this Jensen company a monopo
listic control of product and prices. And
the Call very properly says: "It will
not be well for tho country to allow
the local creameries to bo closed and
stand idlo." The reason is plain, be
cause if those local crcamerios are
eloped and tho control of tho product
and price left in the hands of this ono
company a crushing and oppressive
monopoly will be established.
Wc commend unreservedly Governor
Cutler's position in this matter, aud
only wonder that tho Jensen Creamery
company had the gall to write him such
a letter as it did, assuming tho re
sponsibility for tho charges as made
with regard to the price of trukcys,
as well as the price and the deceptive
handling of butter. We trust tho Com
mercial club will take jurisdiction of
this matter at once, aud will mako the
investigation-proposed by the Governor,
cnforcug a thoroughness and compre
hensiveness that will bo convincing to
tho public and that will bo undeniable
by those who arc making and speaking
for the moupolistie. control, tho imposi
tion of inferior food stuffs, and tl 9
unwarranted boost in prices.
SLOT MACHINE GAMBLING.
And so the courts have finally como
to tho conclusion that slot machino
working is gambling. It is exceedingly
curious that any one could ever have
taken a different view of it. As a
matter of fact, tho operating of the
slot machine is a good deal more cloarly
to bo reckoned as gambling than is
tho playing of poker. In the matter
of poker-playing thorc is, 'leaving out
all crookedness, a certain amount of
judgment, skill, and science, In the
slot Machine, leaving out also the mat
ter of crookedness, thcro is uothing but
clear, blind chance. Even in the throw
ing of dico thoro may be some skill
and profitable deftnes;. But the theory
of the slot machine, eliminating ail
crookedness, is that it is simply and
wholly a matter of chance. And a
clear matter of chance, with anything
put up as a wager, a forfeit, or for
gain, is certainly gambling.
Wo congratulato the court on finally
arriving at this conclusion, ono which
tho general community had arrived at
long ago, and which the foolish dictum
of a city judge did nothing to shake.
Tho slot machines aro gambling de
vices beyond the least questiou. This
ia the position waich The Tribuno has
maintained all- tho time. Thore is'uot
tho least question about it, aud there
nover ought to have been any question
about it. Tho fluff erauco of their run
ning was a sufferance that at bottom
was illegal, aud should never have been
extended at al
BANK CLEARANCES AND GOLD.
The great increase of bank clearances
throughout the country week by week
as compared with the corresponding
week last year, has been commented
upon from time to time, and Tho Trib
une has always, in making mention of
this, taken into consideration tho fact
tbut last year was ono of nbnormal de
pression, aud that the comparisons, to
bo entirely fair aud instructive, should
lako info account tho figures of 190G
and 1905 as well.
Taking those into account for Salt
Lako City, for instance, wc find that
tho bank clearances for tho week end
ing November 2S, as reported in tho
Commercial and Financial Chronicle of
New York, a mounted to $R,10fl.052 as
compared with the clearances, amount
ing to .2,871,G66, for tho correspond
ing week in 1007; being an incrcaso of
llo.S per cent. But the bank clear
ances for the corresponding week in
1906 amounted to $G,"JOI,n02, aud for
tho corresponding week of 1905 they
amounted to $1,67S,S70. So that whilo
tho clearances for tho week ending
November 2S this year show an enor
mous increase, over thoso of tho like
week of the year before, they wore
smaller than for the corresponding
week in 1906, but very much groater
than those of the corresponding week
in 1905.
The clearances for tho whole coimlry
for the week ending November 2S,
190S, amounted to $2,09-1.377,072, as
compared with $1,853,727,163 for the
like week in 1907. But in that week
in 1906 tho total clearances wero $2,
823,011,035, and for tho like week in
1905 they amounted to $2,909,510,809.
So that Salt Lako City shows a much
more favorable comparison than the
country at large. Because in the coun
try at largo tho week shows a succes
sive decroaso over year from 1905 on
ward until the present 3'ear, which sim
ply shows an increase as compared with
1907, but this year docs not show ai
great as oither iu tho years 1906 or
1905. Tho showing proves conclusive
ly that tho unwholesome condition of
last year is fulhy accountable for the
increase this year elsewhere, but is not
fully accountable for that increase in
Salt Lake. As a matter of fact, Salt Lako
shows so much higher than in 1905 that
the conclusion is irresistible that the
gain this year is largeky to bo attrib
uted to a naturla gam hero which is
comparatively absolute.
Tho phenomenal absorption of gold
by the Bank of Franco, is ono of the
great, matters of discussion in fiuancial
circles the world over. The Bank of
France within the past twelve mouths
has increased its gold holmuns by
5139,000,000. During the same time it
has decreased its amount of loans,
while the addition to uole3 in circula
tion was only $2,000,000. Tho gold,
therefore, is being lipid for other pur
poses than as a basis for the issuo of
curroucj". It is suggested in some
quarters that the hoarding of gold by,
tho Bank of France is to secure that
country in case of war. Large gold
holdings would not only fortify Franco
-against any loss of money or material,
but would fill the war chests of tho
country; and in caso of trouble would l
not ouhy strcugtheu Franco in provid
ing whatever facilities might bo nood
cd for meeting attack, but would have
a tendency to weaken any adversary;
because of the dilliculty that adversary
would probably meet in obtaining gold.
In all of the recent sales of gold from
the Kami, the Bank of Franco has been
the exclusive buyer. It has taken all
thut gold for many months. A nossiblo
solution of tho great accumulations of
gold by Franco is made in tho sugges
tion that Franco may be propariug to
take the offered Russian loan, which is
estimated at 6300,000,000, and is ex
pected to bo issued about the middle of
the present mouth or early in the new
year.
Recently Germany has appeared in
the field us a competitor of France iu
the puichaso of gold. It has bid on
nearly all of the recent Rand gold ship
ments, buthas not succeeded in getting
nny of them. But Germany's imports
of gold in October amounted lo $11,- j
600,000, nearly all of which camo from !
Australia. Germany's net imports of
gold for ten months wore nearly
$6-1,000,000; being almost four times as
great as her imports of gold last year.
It appears, therefore, that Germany is
waking up to tho importance of taking
gold and not allowing Franco to take
it all.
It was supposed that (ho United !
Stales was in such condition, b3 reason
of its enormous balance- of trade, to
absolutoly prevent tho shipment of any I
gold from this country. Howovor, a
billion and a half dollars of gold was
exported from New York last week;
tho first, outflow of gold since last June
Tho Bank of France takes it, and the
mystory of it is why it is that France
wants so much gold and is reaching
out all over tho world to got it. And
tho especially curious featuro about it
all is that France does uot tooiu to
bo really buying the gold at al). It
olFcrs no inducement, no premium; it
appears to be a clear case of uuloading
securities and getting gold on tho sale.
It is supposed that there have been ne
gotiated in Europe the past twelve
months an enormous quantity of Ameri
can stocks, bonds, and other securities,
this by reason of the tremendous slump
a year ago., which destroyed tho Euro
pean confidence in the stability of
those securities. Tho tremendous bal
anco of trade in our favor, however,
has prevented the drawing upon us for
auy gold up to this time. And it is
not likely that there will be any very
serious drain of gold from the United
States; because pur large balance of i
excess imports keeps up well, ami thorc
is no international balance against u, i
but always iu our favor. If Franco
gets much gold from tho United States,
it looks decidedly as if sho would have
to pay for it in premiums, Iu the
meantime we aro producing gold our
selves at tho rate of about $100,000,000
a year, which is ample upon which to
base all of our current balances and to
furnish plenty of surplus reserves.
A SAMPLE TARIFF HEARING.
Ono great dilliculty iu tho llouse
Committee on "Ways and Means, which
has been investigating the tariff ques
tion by tho taking of evidence and
the hearing of statements, has been
tho dilliculty of getting at facts bear
ing on points under discussion. A con
spicuous instance of this was presented
to Iho committee on November 27th,
when Mr. Jesse F. Ortou, Secretary
of tho Tariff Reform Committee, Re
form Club of New York, made his
statement. The chairman opened the
dny with the question, "Is thcro any
ono present who desires to be heard on
the iron and steel schedule?" Mr.
Orton said, "E do."
The committee thcu proceeded lo ask
Mr. Ortou as to his position, and ascer
tained that he was ".not one of the
object ionablo protected manufacturers."
Ho was not representing any concern
that was engaged iu making 11101103', but
was thorc simply "as a producer who
is not protected by any tariff duties,
and, second, as a consumer of goods
paj'iug a portion of the taxes imposed
by protective duties, both thoso which
go to the Government and tho larger
amounts which go either to private in
terests or arc wasted by tho forcod
suits of unprofitable industries." Merely
as such ho appeared.
As Mr. Orton proceeded to read his
prepared statement, ho quoted, in re
ferring io stool manufacturers and the
Carnogie publication that "not a Ion
of steel is producod in the world at as
small an outlay for labor as in our
country." Mr. Hill, of tho committee,
asked, "Have you auy facts in your
paper to provo that statement?" Mr.
Orton replied, "No, sir." Mr.. Dal
zell protested that it. was useless to
read a paper that contained only a
mere academic discussion aud criticism
based on opinion, buL having no facts
to support it. However, tho chairman
directed Mr. Ortou to proceed with the
reading of his paper. At the close of
that reading Mr. Orton was asked
what he meant when he said that tho
only information that tho committee
seemed to have wa3 from interested
parties, and he was asked who others
would bo likely to appear. Mr. Ortou
roplied that "those who have given
information on tho foreign cost have
been chiefly those interested in manu
facturing in this country." Mr. Hill
of the committee then proceeded to
ask Mr. Ortou as to any facts in his
possession, and Mr. Ortou stated iu
reply that ho had no known facts, no
inside information, he was uot able to
state whether or uot the price of steel
was fixed in London or whether there
was a division by the steel manufac
turers of the earth's surface with (he
particular places to bo supplied by each
manufacturing concern; he had no in
formation about tho tin-plate business,
had no information about the export 6f
tin, bad no information about the in
ternational agreement fixing the price
of wire nails and the distribution of
the product; ho knew, nothing about
any international agreement in regard
to fixing the prico of steel in any form
or shape or method of distribution, and,
finally, admitLed squarely that all tho
information on which his criticism was
based is purely hearsay and his in
ferences drawn from published state
ments of the steel corporation.
Mr. Hill, proceeding further in his
inquiries, said:
I am earnestly socking for information,
not for criticism. I am not asking thcao
questions wiih any Idea of criticising
your paper. You stated that olir infor
mation came from interested source;. You
appear aa a disinterested party. 1 would
like io have the information for my own
persona! knowledge. If you say absolute
ly that you are unable to give us any
direct and practical facts In regard to
theav matters, of course it Is usolets to
ak further questions. If you havu any
such Information. J. for one, would he glad
to have it.
To this Mr. Orion replied I hat he
ha(L stated distinctly that the organiza
tion which he represents has no means
of making dctailod investigations on
any particular schedule. Mr. Hill . re
plied that in the three or four weeks
which the committee had for securing
detailed information it was uecessary
for the committoo to get the facts from
somebody rather lhau general criticism.
Mr. Orton rejoined, "Wc would have
been more than delighted to have beer,
able to furnish that information; but
I will state, as I staled iu 1113" paper,
that tho gathcriug of tho information
would cost thousands of dollars, whero
the committee has had only huudreds or
tens of dollars to spend."
And that is about the general out
come of such academic discussions and
criticisms as 'Mr. Orton offered to tho
committee, and is frequent' offered to
the public. It is ono thing io got up
a paper based on theoretical conditious
and suppositious relations. It is quilo
another matter to go before a com
mittee composed of men who aro keen,
unxious. and intelligent iuquircrs into
practical alfairs aud who want tho
facts governing in 3113- particular mat
ter that is brought up. Mr. Orion ap
peared before tho committoo with a
purely spoculativo discussion, aud was
not able to. givo tho least aid to ,lhe
committee in auy matter of fact or of
actual conditious of trade or manufac
ture. The committee was moro than
willing to hear au3'thing that Mr. Or
ton had to say; it allowed him to read
the wholo of - his speculative paper, and
to set forth, in as full detail as he
wished to do, his particular and per
sonal viows as to tho bearing of the I
tariff in general, and, broadly speaking,
to discuss the whole tariff questiou-
And yvt when the committoo tried to J
got something of importance out of Mr. '
Ortou, to get from him auy fact that
had any bearing upon practical condi-
tions, he was absolutely unablo to aid ,
the committfc in auy particular whaj- 1
ever. And yet Mr. Orton is doubtless
as forcible and as consiant a critic of
the tariff and of the Committee on "Ways
ami Moau&, as an;, other person iu the
count rj. But when he was brought be
fore that committee lie was absolutely
stunned on learning that what The
committee desired was fact and busi
ness, and not mere hearsay aud opinion.
THE PANAMA CANAL DEAL.
When tho President's recent letter
came nut which pilloried tho editors of
the Indianapolis Star and of the New ,
York Sun as liars because tho.-e editors
made' certain statements with vegard
to a secret deal connected with the pur
chase of tho French Panama Canal
company's effects at the Isthmus, Tho
Tribune commeutcd editorially thereon,
deploring the acrimony'. Our idea was
that it did not necessarily follow
that those' editors were lying iu charg
ing a secret deal. We held, as a
mattor of course, that the President
was right iu stating that there was no
secret understanding, so far aa this
Government was concerned; no secret
papers or memoranda of au3 kind; that
ovco'thiug was open and above-board
so far as tho official dealings wero con
cerned, and that the full auiouut of
the $40,000,000 agreed upon as payment
to the French interests was paid over
lo the French government as agent of
the stockholders in the French canal
cbmpan3. With that, the rcspousibilitj
of our Goverumeut for the money
wholly ceased.
At tho same time, we showed it to
bo quite possible that there might
be a secret understanding between the
French S3,ndicalc representing the canal
company which received the $10,000,
0U0, and which received the $10,000,000
from the French government, that cor
tain sums of 1110U03- would bo paid
to those who negotiated and forwarded
tho deal, ll has been stated heretofore
that Cromwell, who appeared as tho
chief negotiator, received a large foe
for his services; this fee being put
as large as a million dollars. It'seomed
to The Tribune, and seems uow, that
there is no reason for a.n3 vitupera
tion as between the President and thoso
editors, because both ma3' be right,
but looking at this mattor from dift'er-
cut points of view. Tho President
treats it as au official, and speaks au
thoritatively as to the official dealings
had with and through the United States
Government. Those editors spoke of a
secret deal that hnd nothing to do,
necessarily, with officialdom, and whero
thc3' undertook to connect it officially
thc3- were wrong.
Wo notice' that, there is u-disposition
in Congress to investigate this whole
matter, aiid the New York World has '
uow got into tho ring with a demand
for such investigation. This iuquio.
of course, will be a continuation of the
iuquir3r begun two years ago, in which
Cromwell, being pressed 03' Senator
Morgan, of the investigating com
mittee, refused to answer questions
that Morgan considered important and
necessary lo the inquiry. That re
fusal stopped the investigation. What
is now proposed is to lake that
investigation up aud push it to com
pletion. Wo beliovc that this ought
to be done. Thoro has alwn3s beeu
moro or less talk about underhand
dealings, secret negotiations, aud
Inrge sums paid lo persons connected
with tho deal. And now that tho
matter has taken tho form that it has.
being brought forward with special
prominence b President Roosevelt in
his heated denial and vituperation, wc
think that it is duo to all concerned
that the investigation should be made,
and should bo pushed with an energy
and probed with a thoroughness tbs t
would leave nothing to be desired.
