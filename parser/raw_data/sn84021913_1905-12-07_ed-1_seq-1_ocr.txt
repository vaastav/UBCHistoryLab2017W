of these today tho ledges are well? defined,
carrying veins of varying widths
and values-all indicating profitable
working by reasonable development.
These goucings, gopherings, shallow
shafts, inclines and tunnels will save
tho Kadium Mines company many thousands
of dollars and months of time in
their general scheme of development
jvork.
Tho Golden Wonder
To the eastward and closely adjacent
to the Emeline claim lies the Golden
Wonder on a ledge parallel with and
quite as well defined as the Emeline.
Here an entirely new working has been
commenced. A tunnel is being driven
on the ledge which will bo carried along
indefinitely for the purpose of exploiting
this most promising vein. A shaft
is being sunk to tap the tunnel at a
depth of about 100 feet. Although this
shaft is but 20 feet in depth a streak of
rich galena from four to eight inches
in width has been reached, with every
indication of widening nt greater depth.
People who are familiar with earlier
operations in that section are confident
that rich shipping ore will be taken
from this shaft in the next 40 feet of
depth and that the tunnel will devolon
i . k . ... .... . :.'i
T ricn orc m Muanuty within a short dis
tance, inc galena uiKen out ot the
shaft this week is so rich in silver that
it was not deemed necessary to obtain
assays the value is too apparent, even
to the novice.
There are several thousands of tons
of surface and outcrop ores, and on
the various dumps that would return
good values from proper treatment.
Rich Ores Found
In recent explorations of these properties
some interesting specimens of
rich ore have been found. Some of the
finest samples of vanadinite ever seen
in this district have been taken from
two of the openings. Horn silver
specimens have been found frequently
and the occurance of copper glance and
black oxides and rich sulphides is not
rare.
In the Globe district these surface
findings have been succeeded by rich
copper values at depth. This has been
the case on these same leads and in the
same formation in adjacent territory.
Tombstone mines are showing gratifying
signs of rich copper deposits
where formerly nothingbut silver-galena
ores were mined.
In Montana many mines which are
now heavy copper producers were originally
mined for silver and on no better
showing than the Radium group
presents today.
Mill and Townsite Plans
In addition to the mineral claims the
Radium company's property embraces
some of hc largest and best lime de
posits in the county, being those on
Pinal creek, about four miles north of
the city, near the place where the old
kiln was operated. Here is one of the
finest mill and smelter sites in this
vicinity, ample in area and easy of access.
Opposite this point on a fine
mesa, removed from all danger of
Hood, is an admirable site for a town,
which it is expected will be a necessary
part of the comprehensive plans of the
promoters. Abundant water is available
for all domestic and mill purposes
anil tho 'town of Radium is a possibility
of the not distant future.
A good road for temporary uses has
been constructed to that tunnel site
farthest to the eastward on the
claims. No more road building will be
nccessarv for some time and the cost
of maintaining the existing roads and
trails wnl lie unimportant.
The Natural Advantages
There are several springs on various '
portions ol tne property wnicn can ue I
developed to furnish water for all purposes.
That at the present camp
site is one of the largest and finest in
fliiQ vipinitv. The location of the hills
, j3 suci, that an easy grade can be found
i for ., nermanent wanon or tram road,
easily constructed and cheaply maintained.
If found desirable an aerial
road could be operated with the greatest
facility from the eastern extremity
of the properties to the smelter site.
As matters stand at the moment orc
enn be landed on the track in North
Globe for a hnulage of $2.00 per ton or
less. Freight rates to the El Paso
smelter arc very favorable and with
tho present and increasing values oi
silver and lead it will be possible to
make a good profit on ores which could
not have been handled except at a loss
only one or two years ago.
It is no stretch of the imagination to
predict that pay ore will bo shipped
in quantity from the Radium proper
ties from tho as a result of development
work now planned.
To Summarize
The practical advantages which attracted
the attention of the Radium
Company's promoters is as follows:
Great area of mineralized ground.
a
Proved value of the old claims.
Nearness to the city of Globe.
Good roads and easy grades.
Abundant water supply.
j Splendid mill and smelter sites.
An ideal townsite.

MESSAGE OF
THE PRESIDENT
Recommends Immediate Joint
Statehood for Arizona and
New Mexico
TERRITORY HAS NO RIGHTS
"Merely a Matter of Convenience and
There is No Obligation for the U.S.
Government to Treat Our Wishes as
Binding in tho Case"
To the everlasting disgrace of his
administration President Roosevelt in
his message to the fifty-ninth congress
has recommended that Arizona andNew
Mexico be joined in statehood and that
immediate action be taken looking to
their admission as one state. That
section of his message follows:
"I recommend that Indian Territory
and Oklahoma be admitted as one state
and that New Mexico and Arizona be
admitted as one state. There is no
obligation upon us to treat territorial
subdivisions, which aro matters of convenience
only, as binding us on the
question of admission to statehood.
Nothing has taken up more time in the
congress during the past few years
than the question as to the statehood
to be granted to the four territories
above mentioned, and after careful
consideration of all that has been developed
in the discussions of the question
I recommend that they be immediately
admitted as to states. There is
no justification for further delay; and
the advisability of making the four
territories into two states has been
clearly established.
"In some of the territories the legislative
assemblies issue licenses for
gambling The congress should forbid
this practice, the results of which
are harmful at a glance."
Blow of the Big Stick
President Roosevelt by thus ignoring
the wishes of the people whose interests
are vitally aitecteu ami listening to me

the perpetuation of the republican
I
nariv in power nas snowii a
political huckster instead of "the president
of all the people," his frequent
boast.
Let him henceforth be silent about
the "square deal" and other cheap
phrases which are merely ear-catchers
and utterly meaningless in practice.
mined upon according to the character
of the ores and the Plant located where
it will perform the most economic
service.
The evolution from this stage to the
erection of a smelter to be owned by
the company is only a matter of necessary
development work to block out an
ore supply sufficient to maintain its
continuous working.
These operations will employ a continually
increasing force of men and
the development of the tovnsitc would
bo a natural sequence.
The promoters and officers of the
Radium Mines company are perfectly i
satisfied that this program will be
netl out without serious delay.
Company Organization
For the purposes of this corporation
the capital stock has been fixed at 500.-000
shares, $10 par value and of this
80 per cent, or 400,000 shares have been
placed in the treasury an unusually
liberal provision.
The great number of claims and the
plans in view for their development justify
the capitalization in the opinion of
the directors, and the gradual sale of
treasury stock should produce the necessary
capital without incurring any
indebtedness or the necessity of reorganization
or increase of shares.
Should subsequent developments
prove that it is not necessary to dispose
of the entire amount of treasury
stock it may be cancelled and retired,
or issued as a stock dividend to shareholders
of record.
Ground Floor Offer
To raise tho sum of $5000, which is
deemed sufficient for the initial work
outlined above, 25,000 shares of the
treasury stock will be issued at twenty
cents (20 cts) per share.
Each subscriber to the original allotment
will bo given the right to subscribe
for a number of shares equal to
his original holding when the next
block is offered At the same price per
share.
It is confidently believed by the directors
that the judicious expenditure
of $5000 will demonstrate that the stock
is worth at least 50 cents per share.
But the original subscriber will have
the right to purchase at 20c if he so
desires.
The use of the second $5000 is expected
to establish a value of at least
$1 per share for the remaining 350,00(1
shares in the treasury, and the officers
I arc of the opinion that the gradual ap
preciation ot the stocK sviu enable tne
sale of treasury shares at prices that
will produce all the capital necessary
for tlie carrying out of the entire program
as explained in the above article.
The writer spent an entire day examining
the old and new workings and
viewing the property embraced by
these claims, and this description of
the same is based wholly upon the evidence
presented to him by the ground
itself.
At an informal meeting of tho directors
on Wednesday to discuss the plan
of campaign several blocks of shares
were subscribed for by outsiders, preset
by chance, in blocks of $100 and
t W each.

Took Laudanum In Error
'
Robert Brenard, a miner from Iowa,
swallowed an ounce of laudanum on j
Sunday last and retired for what might j
have been his last sleep if he had not j
been discovered in time. He says he i
bought the drug for a friend but must
have taken it before he entered the
room in the house where he was lodging
as no bottle could be found. He
removed his coat, vest and shoes, locked
his door and went to bed and had he
not advertised his condition by heavy
breathing might have crossed the divide.
Dr. Sturgeon was called and
managed to shape him up for the hospital
where he has been under the care
of Dr. Maisch ever since. He has practically
recovered.
Traffic Resumed
Passenger service has practically
been restored over the G. V.. G. & N.
and freight has begun to move again.
The congestion of mail and express
has been relieved and the egg and butter
shortage is over. Fifty-four cars
of merchandise for Globe were stalled
at Bowie on Tuesday, but all will
probably be brought in by Monday Ore
shipments will be resumed tomorrow.

from his son who was made a confidant
by the guilty parties.
A few days after the tragedy two
Mexicans appeared in Kelvin and obtained
work. They had boon employed
there previously about the mines and
one ot them had some knowledge of
machinery. Their names are known
and identification would be an easy
matter. The taller and older of the
two had had the ends of two fingers cut
off in some recent encounter and when
asked how he came to receive these
and other small wounds which were
visible to a close observer he told
young Hickey the circumstances of the
murder. Publication of other details
would not be judicious at this time, but
every effort will be made to find the
men who arc believed to have gone to
Minns' Prietas where one of them claimed
to have a family.
It is almost beyond belief that these
men could fabricate such a complete
and circumstanial story of the deeds of

guilty knowledge direct irom tne perpetrators

HOME PRIDE MAY WIN
LAW FAILS TO PROTECT
Interstate Commerce Law Overrides the
Territorial Statutes in the Hartmann
Case
John Hartmann won his case on appeal
from the Justice court to the District
court and the fine of $300 assessed
against him will not enrich the cof
fers of Gila county. It appears that
the Interstate commerce provisions
place the statutes of this territory in
the category of "restriction to trade
and commerce." So the outsider may
in and . ir l. t. 1..
come carry off the trade that
legitimately belongs to home merchants
who help pay the taxes and support
the town.
There should be some way to minimize
this evil and if pride and a sense
of equity and fairness does not accomplish
the purpose it would be small
wonder if the merchants retaliate when
opportunity arises. There is no law to
prevent a man from buying where he
can get the most for his money, but
there are other considerations.'
It would be an easy matter for local
merchants to ascertain who of their
credit customers send their cash out of
town to mail order houses. In hard
times the local merchant has to discriminate
closely in irrantincr credit
If at such ha lo with

into the condition of the county jail
certified that the prisoners are as well
cared for as possible under present conditions
and no sanitary improvement is
nossible until he new jail is completed.
The committee that inspected the
county hospital reported that it is kept
in neat condition and well administered
by the Matron, but is totally inadequate
for the requirements. They recommend
that the supervisors sell the
present site and build a more commodious
hospital on a desirable site. They
further recommend that the matron's
salary be raised to $100 per month.
The committee that visited Hill
street bridge report that its condition
is dangerous and recommend that it be
wholly rebuilt on a grade at least six
feet higher than that of the present
structure.

FORGING AHEAD FAST
Shlpments Doubled Since Deo I Has
a Deposit of Covellite Ore 20
Feet Wide
The Copper Hill mine is showing up
better with every week's work and
now has twelve stopes of sulphides ore
from which to make shipments. Since
December 1 regular deliveries to the
Old Dominion smelter have been increased
to 100 tons per day. double the
former output. In addition to this
from 1000 to 1200 tons per month of
silicious ores are sent to the Douglas
smelter, and shipments will be increased
as soon as more cars can be had.
Superintendent W. S. Sultan is directing
operations, ably assisted by Pat
Rose, mine foreman, and is preparing
to sink the Copper Hill shaft 200 feet
deeper, to a total of 800 feet. An auxiliary
hoist will be installed underground
to facilitate operations. One stope in
the Copper Hill workings shows 20 feet
in width of covellite ore of very high
grade.
The Blackhawk shaft: now down 260
feet, is to be sunk to a total depth of
600 feet or more, before a level is run.
A steam hoist will be put in at once
and power drills employed to hasten the
work of sinking. A pipe line for water
supply will be run from either the Copper
Hill or Gray mine, not yet determined,
either line being over a mile in
length. Mr. Amster, a large stockholder
and consulting engineer of the
Arizona Commercial Copper Company,
was greatly pleased with results

HAS FAITH IN GLOBE
HEAVY INVESTMENTS
L. Amster Increases His Interests in
Globe by Large Cash
Disbursements
During his recent short sojourn in
Globe N. L. Amster increased his interests
here by investing heavily in local
enterprises. He already owns much
valuable realty in and near Globe but
has made ventures in a new field this
time. He bought the interest of J. B.
Newman in the Globe Ice and Cold
Storage company for a starter. His
next move was to join with J. N. Porter
and S. F. Sullenbergcr in the purchase
of a one-half interest in the
Globe Electric Light & Power Co.,
from Cottee & James. Mr. Amster acquired
a quarter interest, Messrs.
Porter and Sullenbergcr secured one-fourth
and Cottee & James retain the
remaining half interest and will
manage the practical operations.
A gas plant will shortly be installed
by the new company which is in process
of organization. It is the purpose
of the corporation to furnish fuel and
illuminating gas at $2.00 per thousand
feet. The electric plant will be considerably
enlarged at once and heat, light
and power be furnished to the community
at rates that will develop the use
of both gas and electricity as rapidly as
the plant can be enlarged to meet the
demand.
Mr. Amster is willing to back his
faith in Globe to any reasonable extent
and to judge by these investments he
has unlimited confidence in the future
of the city.
