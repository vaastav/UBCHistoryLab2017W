EDITORIAL PABAGBIPHS.
Wi publish this week President
Grant's annual message in fnll and in
order to do so have not only been
obliged to defer any notice or comment
until our next Issue but also to
leave over a number of news articles
and communications that bad been pre
pared for this number.
The message U much longer than ever
before and treats npon bo- many new
subjects at length that with a majority
of our readers its publication will more
than compensate for the lack of our usual
i iT-"t miscellaneous ar
ticles, i ,
Among other items crowded ont has
been an account of the funeral obse
quies of Horace Greeley, who died on
Friday evening last; a sketch of the life
of this eminent journalist; our for
eign letters, and several interesting
home corresoondences all of which
' however wilt appear in our next issue.
President's Message.
" To the Senate and House of Representa
tive :
nut cojnrno3t o thb countrt.
In transmitting to you my fourth an
nual message it is witn tnanKiuinesa w
the Giver of all good that as a nation we
i have been blessed lor the past year wiui
neace at home and abroad and a general
- nrosneritv. vouchsafed to but few peo
ple, with ttie exception of the recent de
vastating are wnicil swept iroin me
earth with a breath as it were millions
of accumulated wealth in the city ot
Boston. There have been two over
shadowiuz calamities within the year to
' record. Ft is irratifvine to note here.
like their fellow citizens of the city of
' Chicazo. under similar circumstances a
year earlier, the citizens of Boston are
rallying under tneir misiortunes, auu
' the Drosoeet is that their energy and
perseverance will overcome all obstacles
and show the same prosperity soon that
they would have shown had no disaster
befallen them. Otherwise, we have
been free from pestilence, war and ca-
. lam i ties which otten overcome nations,
.and. as far as human judgement can
penetrate the future, no cause seems to
; exist to threaten our preseut peace.
THE ALABAMA CLAIMS ARBITRATION,
When Consress adlotirncd in June
. last a questiou had been raised by Great
Britian, and was then pending, which
: lor a time seriously imperilled the set
tlement by friendly arbitration of the
differences existing between this gov
ernment and tbat of ller Br it tan ic Maj-
esty by the Treaty of Washington, had
been referred to tue rriDunai oi atoi
tration which had met at Geneva, in
Switzerland . The arbitrators, howerer,
disposed of the question which had je
opardized the whole of the treaty and
threatened to involve the two nations in
most unhauDV relations toward each
other, in a manner entirely satislactory
to this government and in accordance
with the views and the policy which it
- bad maintained. The tribunal, which
had convened in Geneva in December,
- concluded its' laborious session on the
14th dav of September last, on which
- day, having availed itself of the.discre-
- tionary power given to it oy tne treaty
to award a sum in gross. It made its
decision, whereby it awarded the sum of
15,500.(XKJ in gold as tne inaemity to De
. paid by Great Britain to the United
- States, for the ratification of all the
. claims. , referred . in its consideration
This decision happily disposed of a long
Standing difference between the two
, governments, and in connection with
another award made by the German
Emperor under a reference to him by
" the same treaty, leaves these two gov
ernments without a shadow upon the
friendly relations which it is my sincere
'" hope may forever remain equally un-
cionaeu.
The report of the agent of the United
.''States' appointed to attend the Geneva
tribunal accompanied by the protocols
of the proceedings of the arbitrators, the
arguments ot the counsel ol Doth gov
ernments',' the award Of the tribunal
and the opinions given by the several
arbitrators, is transmitted herewith. I
have caused to bo communicated to the
heads of the three friendly powers who
complied with the joint request made to
them under the treaty, and thanks of
i this government for the appointment of
arbitrators made by them respectfully
and also my thanks to the eminent per
sons named by them, and iny apprecia-
. tion of thedignity, patience.impartiality
and great ability with which they dis
charged their orders and mgn lunctions
iter Majesty's government has communi
' cated to me its appreciation by Her Mai
esty of the ability indefatigable industry
displayed by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator
named on the part of this government
during the protracted Inquiries and dis
cussions ol the tribunal. I cordially
' unite with Her Majesty in this appre-
' ciation. it is due to the agent ot the
United States before the tribunal to re-
' cord my high appreciation of the marked
' ability. tin wearied patience and the pru
dence and discretion with which he has
conducted the very responsible and deli
cate duties committed to him, as it is also
due to the learned and eminent counsel
who attended the tribunal on the part of
this government, to express my sense of
the talents and - wisdom which they
brought to bear in the argument of re
sult so happilly reached. It will be the
providence of Congress to provide for the
distribution among those who may be
entitled to it of their respective shares
of the money to be paid.
Although the sum awarded is not pay
able until a year from its award, it is
deemed advisable that no time be lost in
making a proper examination of the
several cases in which indemnification
may be due. I consequently recommend
the creation of a board of commissioners
for the purpose. By the 34th article of
the treaty of Washington the respective
claims of the United States and Great
Britain in their construction of the
treaty of the 15th of June, 1S46, defining
theboundry line between their respec
tive territories were submitted to the
arbitration and award of His Majesty
the Emperor of Germany to decide
which of those claims is most in accord
ance with the true interpretation of the
treaty of 1846. His Majesty, the Ein-
porer of Germany, having been pleased
to undertake the arbitration, has the
earnest thanks of this government and of
the peopleof the United States for the
labor, pains and care which he has de
voted to the consideration of this long
pending difference. I have caused an
expression of my thanks to becommuni-
. cated to His Majesty. Mr. Bancroft,
the representative of this government
at Berlin, conducted the case and pre
pared the statement on the part of the
United States, with the ability that his
past services justified the public in ex
pecting at his bands. As a member of
the Cabinet at the date of the treaty
which has given rise to the discussion
between the two governments, as the
Minister to Great Britain when the con
construction now pronouueed un
founded was first advanced, and as the
agent and representative of the govern
ment to present the case and to receive
the award, he has been associated with
the question in all of its phases, and in
every stage has manifested a patriotic
zeal and earnestness in the maintenance
of the claim of the United States; he is
entitled to much credit for the success
which has attended the submission.
After a patient-investigation of the case
and of the statement of each party, His
Majesty, the Emperor, on the 21st day
of October last, signed his award in
writing, decreeing that the claim of the
government of the United States that the
boundary line between the territories of
her Britannic majesty and the United
States should be drawn through the
Haro channel, is most in accordance
with the true interpretation of the true
treaty concluded on the 15th of June,
1848, between the agents of her Britan
nic Majesty and the United States,
- : THK SAN JUAK QUESTION. .
Copies of the case presented on behalf
of each government, and of the state
ment in reply, of each' and a translation
of the award are transmitted herewith.
This award confirms the United States
in their claim to the important archipel
ago of islands lying between the conti
nentand Vancouver's Island, which for
twenty-six years, ever since the ratifica
tion of the treaty, Great Britain has
contested, and leaves ns for the first
time in the history or tne united states
a nation without a question of disputed
boundary between our territory ana tne
possessions of Great Britain on this con
tinent. It is my grateful duty to ac
knowledge the prompt, spontaneous ac
tion or ller .Majesty's government, w
giving effect to the award. In anticipa
tion of any request from this govern
ment, and before tne reception in me
United States of the award signed by
the Emperor, Her Majesty had given in
structions for the removal of her troop3
which had been stationed there, and for
the cessation of all exercise or claim of
jurisdiction, so as to leave the United
States in exclusive possession oi tne
lately disputed territory. I am grateful
to be able to aunounce that the orders
for the removal of the troops have been
executed, aud the military joint occupa
tion of San Juan has ceased. The islands
are now in the exclusive possession of
the United States, it how Decomes ne
cessary to complete the survey and de
termination' of that portion of the boun
dary line through the iiaro channel, on
which the commission wnicn aeterminea
the remaining part of the line were un
able to agree. I recommend the appoint
ment of a commission to act joinuy wun
oue which may be named by her Jtrajesty
for that purpose.
TBK ALASKA BOUNDARY.
Experience of the difficulties attend
ing the determination oi our admitted
line of boundary alter the occupation
or the territory and its settlement uy
those owing allegiance to the restrictive
governments points to the importance
of establishing by natural objects or
other monuments the actual line be
tween the territory acquired by purchase
from Kussia and the adjoining pos
sions of her Brittauic majesty, lhe re
gion is now so sparsely occupied that no
conflicting: interests of individuals or of
jurisdiction are likely to interfere to tne
delay or embarrassment oi tne actual lo
cation of the line. If deferred until pop
ulation shall enter and occupy the ter
territory, some trivial contest of neigh
bors may again array tne two govern
ments in antagonism. I therefore rec
ommend the appointment of a commis
sion to act Jointly with one that may be
appointed on tiie part of Great Britain to
determine the line between our territory
of Alaska and the co-terminous ot pos
sessions of Great Britain. In my last
annual message I recommended the leg
islation necessary on tne pan oi tue
United States to bring into operation the
articles of the treaty of Washington of
May. 1871, relating to the fisheries and
to other matters touching the relations
of the United states toward tne uritisn
North America possessions, to become
operative so soon as the proper legisla
tion should be had on the part ot ureat
Britain, and its possessions bad not then
been had, and during a session or Uoti
gressa question was raised which for
the time raised a doubt whether any
action by Congress in the direction in
dicated would become Important. This
question has since been disposed of, and
I have received notice that the Imperial
Parliament and, the legislature of the
provincial government have passed laws
to carry the provisions of the treaty on
the matters referred to into operation.
I therefore recommend your early adop
tion of the legislation in the same direc
tion necessary on tue part oi tuis gov
ernment. ...
The joint commission for determining
the boundary line between the United
States and the British possessions, be.
tweea the lake of the woods and the
Rocky Mountains has organ inzed and
entered upon its work. It is desirable
that the force be increased,,)!! order that
the completion of the survey and deter
mining of the line may be the sooner
attained. To this end I recommend that
a sufficient appropriation be made.
OUR RELATIONS WITH EUROPE.
With France, our earliest ally; Rus
sia, the constant and steady friend of
the United States; Germany, with whose
government and people we have so
many causes of friendship and so many
common sympathies, and the other pow
ers . of Europe, our relations are main
tained on the most friendly terms
since my last annual message. The ex
change has been made of the ratifica
tions of a treaty with the Austrian and
Hungarian empires, relating to natur
alization : also ot a treaty with tne Ger
man empire respecting' counsuls. aud
trade-marks: also of. a treaty with
Sweden and Norway relating to natur
alization, all of which treaties have Deen
duly proclaimed.
- THE VIENNA EXPOSITION.
Congress, at its last session, having
made an appropriation to defray the ex
pense of commissioners on the part of
United States to the International Statis
tical congress at St. Petersburg, the
persons appointed in that character pro
ceeded to tiieir destination, and atten
ded the sessions of the congress. Their
report shall in due season be laid out be
fore you. This congress meets at inter
vals of about three years, and has held
its sessions in several of the countries of
Europe. I submit to your consideration
the propriety of extending an invitation
to the Congress to hold its next meeting
in the United States. The centennial
celebration to be held in 1876 would af
ford an appropriate occasion for such
meeting. Preparations are making for
the international exposition to be held
during the next year in Vienna on :
scale of very great magnitude. The ten
dency of these expositions is in the direc
tion or advanced civilization and ot the
elevation of industry, of labor, and of
ttie increase or human happiness a3 well
of greater intercourse and good will be
tween nations. As this exposition is to
be the nrst which will have been held in
eastern Europe, it is believed that Amer
ican manufacturers and inventors will
be ready to avail themselves of the op
portunity for the presentation of their
productions, if encouraged bv proper aid
and protection. At the last session of
Congress authority was given for the
appointment of one or more agents to
represent this government at the expo
sition, rue authority thus grven has been
exercised, but in the absence of any ap
propriation, mere is danger that the im
portant benefits which the occasion of
fers will, in a large degree, be lost to the
citizens of the United States;. I com
mend the subject strongly to your con
sideration, and recommend that an ade
quate appropriation be made for tho pur
pose.
To further aid the American exhibi
tors at the Vienna exposition, I would
rcccommend. in addition to an apnro-
priation of money, that the secretary of
tne navy be authorized to fit up two naval
vessels to transport between our At
lantic cities and Triest, or the most con
venient port, to Vienna and back their
articles for exhibition.
THE POLICY WITH MEXICO.
Since your last session the President
of the Mexican Republic, distinguished
by his high character aud his services to
his country, lias died, (lis temporary
successor has now been elected - with
great unanimity by the people, a proof
of confidence on their part In his patri
otism and wisdom winch, it is believed,
will be confirmed by the results of his
administration. . It is particularly desir
able that nothing should be left undone
by the government of either republic to
strengthen their relations as neighbors
anu menus, it is much to oe regretted
that many lawless acts continue to dis
turb the quiet of the settlements on the
border between our territory and that of
Mexico, and that complaints of wrong to
American citizens in various parts of
the country are made. The revolutionary
condition in wnicn tne neigiiDoring re
public has so long been involved, has in
some degree contributed to this distur
bance. It is to be hoped that with a
more settled rule of order through the
republic which may be expected from
the present government, the acts of
which just complaint is made, will
cease.
The proceedings of the commission
under the convention with Mexico of
the 4th of July, 1808, on the subject of
claims, nave uniortunately been checked
by an obstacle for the removal of which
measures have been taken by tne two
governments wnicn, it is believed, will
prove successful. The commissioners
appointed pursuant to the ioint resolu
tions of Congress of the Oth of May last
to inquire into tne depredations on the
Texan frontier have diligently made in
vestigations in that quarter. Their re
port upon the subject will be communi
cated to you. Their researches were
necessarily incomplete, partly on ac
count of the limited appropriation made
by Congress. Mexico, on the part of
that government, has appointed a simi
lar commission to investigate these out
rages. It is not announced officially.
but the press of that country states that
the fullest Investigation is desired, aud
that the co-operation of all parties con
cerned is invited to secure that end. I
therefor ieemmeA tbat a special ap
propriation be made at the earliest day
practical to enauie tue wuiuiikuuucib uu
the part of the United States to return
to their labor witiiout delay.
THE DISTRESS OF CUBA THE OBVIOUS
cause. ' ;'.
It is with, regret that I have again to
announce a continuance of the disturbed
condition of the island of Cuba. So ad
vance toward the pacification of the dis
contented part or the population has
been made, while the insurrection has
gained no advantages aud exhibits no
more of the elements of power or of the
prospect of ultimate success than were
exhibited a year ago. Spain,on the other
hand, has not succeeded in its suppres
sion, and the parties stand apparently
in the same relative attitude which
they have occupied for a long time
past. 'Ill is contest has lasted no for
more than four years, vv ere it seen at
a distance from our .neighborhood we
might be indifferent to: its result,, al-
tuougn numanity could not oe unmoveu
by many of its incidents wherever they
might oceur.' It is, however, at our
door. - - --.,.-. ' .
I cannot doubt that the continued
maintenance - of slavery In Cuba is
among the strongest inducements to th
continuance of this - strife. A terrible
wrong is tne natural cause of a terrible
evil. . The abolition of slavery and the
introduction of other reforms in the ad
ministration of government in Cuba
could not lau to advance tue restoration
of peace and order. It is especially to
be hoped tbat the present liberal gov
ernment of Spain will voluntarily adopt
this view. The law of emancipation,
which was passed more than two years
since, has remained unexecuted in the
absence oT regulations for its enforce
ment, it was but a feeble step toward
emancipation but it was the recognition
of right and was hailed as such and ex
hibited in bpain in harmony with tue
sentiments of humanity and or ltiace,
and in sympathy with the other powers
or tne christian anu civilized worm
Within tho past few weeks the regula
tions for carrying out the laws of
emancipation nave been announced,
giving evidence of the sincerity of the
intention of the present government to
carry into effect the law ot'1870. I have
not tailed to urge the consideration or
the wisdom, the policy and the justice of
a more effective system for the abolition
of the great evil which oppressed a race
and continues a bloody and destructive
contest close to our border, as well as
expediency and justice of conceding re
forms of. which the propriety is Hot
questioned. Deeply impressed with the
conviction that the continuance or sla
very is one of the most active causes of
or the continuance or tne un nappy con
dition in Cuba. I regret to believe that
citizens of the United States, or those
claiming to be such, are large holders in
Cuba ot what is there claimed as prop
erty, but which is forbidden and de
nounced by the laws of the United
States. They are thus in defiance of the
spirit of our own laws contributing to
the continuance or this distressing and
sickening contest. In my last annnal
message, I referred to this subject, and
I again recommend such legislation as
f may be proper to denounce, and if not
prevent, at least to discouage American,
citizeus from holding or dealing in
slaves. It is gratifying to announce
that the ratification of the convention
concluded, , under the auspices of this
government between Spain on tho one
part, and the allied Republics of the Pa
cific on the other, providing fur an ar
mistice, have been exchanged, a copy of
the instrument is herewith submitted
It is hoped that this may be followed by
a permanent peace between the same
parties. - ; ; '
DIPLOMATIC POLICY WITH . CHINA AND
JAPAN."
The difference which at one time
threatened the maintenance of peace be
tween Brazil and the Argentine Repub
lic it is hoped are in the way of satisfac
tory adjustment. With the states as
with the republics of Central and South
America, we continue to maintain the
most lriendly relation, it is with re
gret, however, I announce that the gov
ernment or venzueia nas made noiur-
ther payments on account of the awards
under the convention . of the' 24th.' of
April, 1866. That republic Is under
stood to be now almost, ' if not quite
tranquilizer. it Is hoped, therefore,
that it will lose no time in providing for
the unpaid balances of its debt to the
United States, which having originated
in injuries to its citizens by Venzuelan
authorities and having been acknowl
edged, pursuant to a treaty in the roost
solemn form known among nations, it
would seem to deserve a preference over
debts of a different origin and contrac
ted in a different manner. This subject
is again recommended to th'e attention
of Congress for such action as may be
deemed proper.
Our treaty relations with Japan' re-;
main unchanged. An lmpossmg em
bassy from that interesting and progres
sive nation visited this country during
the year that is passing, but being un
provided with powers tor the signing of
a convention in this country, no conclu
sion in that direction- was reached. It
is hoped, however, that the interchange
of opinions which took place during
their stay in this country has led to a
mutual appreciation of the interests
there, which may be promoted when
the revision of the existing treaty shall
be undertaken, in this connection
renew my recommendation of one year
ago, that to give importance and to add
to the efficiency oi our diplomatic rela
tions with Japan and China, and to fur
ther aid in retaining the good opinion of
these people, and to secure to the United
States its share of the commerce des
tined to flow between these nations and
the balance of the commercial world, an
appropriation ' be made to support at
least four army youths in each of these
countries to serve as a part of the official
family of .our ministers. Our represen
tatives would not even then be placed
upon an equality with the representa
tives of Great Biitian or some other
powers. As now situated, onr represen
tatives in Japan and China have to de
pend for interpreters and translators
upon natives of those countries who
know our language imperfectly, or pro
cure tor the occasion the services of em
ployees in foreign business houses, or
the interpreters to other foreign min
isters. I renew the recommendations made
on a previous occasion of the transfer to
the department of the interior, to which
they seem more appropriately to belong,
oi an tne powers anu uunes in relation
to the territories with which the depart
ment of state is ciiarged by law or cus
tom.
RELIEF OF DISTRESSED CITIZENS ABROAD.
Congress, from the beginning of the
government, has wisely made provision
lor the relief ot distressed seameu In for
eign countries. No similar provision,
however, has hitherto been made for the
relief ot distressed citizens abroad other
than seamen. It is understood to be
customary with other governments to
authorize consuls to extend such relief
to their citizens or subjects in certain
cases. A similar authority and an ap
propriation to carry it into effect are
commended, in case of citizens of the
United States, destitute or sick under
such circumstances. It is well known
that such citizens resort to foreign coun
tries in great numbers, though most of
them are able to bear the expense met
dent to locomotion. There are some
who, through accident, or otherwise,be
come penniless, and have no friends at
home able to succor them.
Persons in this situation must either
perish or cast themselves upon the char
ity of foreigners or be returned at the
private charge of our own officers, who
usually, even with the most benevolent
dispositions have nothing to spare, were
such the purposes. Should the author
ity and appropriation be asked for, care
will be taken to carry the benificence of
Congress into effect that it shall be un
necessary or unworthily bestowed.

From the foregoing- statement at ap
pears that the net reduction of the prin
cipal of the debt, during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 2872, was $99,960,253 54.
The source of this reduction is as fol
lows : Net ordinary receipts during the
year,$3,469,229 94 ; net ordinary ex
penses. including interest on tne puonc
debt, $270,559,695 92; total, $94,134,534.
Add amount or receipts from premium

the year, accompanied with the same at
the commencement or the year, Sd.dj l,-

ment treats solely or tne principal ot
the public debt. By the monthly state
ment of the public debt, which adds to
gether the principal and interest due
and unpaid and interest accrued to date,
due, and deducts the cash in the treas
ury, as according on tue day ot publica
tion the reduction was $100,544,491 28.
The source of this reduction is as fol
lows: Reduction in principal account,
$99,960,013 54; reduction in unpaid in
terest account, $3,330,952 96 ; total, $103,-
290,9o6 5u; reduction in cash on hand,
$2,740,465 22 ; total, $100,544,491 28. On
the basis or the last table tne statements
show a reduction of the public debt from
the 1st of March, 1869, to the present
time as follows : Erom March 1, 1860, to
March 1, 1870, $87,134,780 84; from
March 1, 1870, to March 1, 1871, $117,
639,630 25; from March 1, 1871, to
March 1, 1872, S94.89o.34S 94 ; from
March 1, 1S72, to JNoveuiber l, 1872 eight
months, $b3.U47,237 84; . total: $363,606,
999 87.
With the great reduction of taxation
by the acts of Congress at its lost session,
the expenditure of the government in
collecting the revenue will be much re
duced for the next fiscal year. It is
very doubtful, however, whether any
reduction of so vexatious a burden upon
any people will be practicable for the
present. . At all events, as a measure of
Justice to the holders or the nation's cer
tificates ot indebtedness, l would rec
ommend that no more legislation be had
on this subject, unless it be to correct
errors of omission or commission in the
preseut laws, until sufficient time has
elapsed to prove that it can be done and
still leave sumuient revenue to meet the
current expenses of the government.
Pay the interest ou the public debt and
provide for the sinking fund established
by law. The preservation of our na
tional credit is of the .highest import

- WAR DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of War
shows the expenditures of the War De
partment for the fiscal ' year ending
June 30, 1S71, to oe ao,vyy,syi sa; and
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872,
to be $35,372,157 20, showing a reduction
in the last fiscal year of $427,834 72. The
estimates for military appropriation for
the next fiscal year, ending June 30,
1873, are $3,380.,137,878. The estimates
of the chief or engineers are submitted
separately for fortifications, river and
harbor Improvements and for public
buildings and ground, and the Washing
ton aqueduct. The affairs of the freed-
mens bureau have all been transferred
to the War Department, and the regula
tions have been put into execution for
the speedy payment of bounty, due col
ored soldiers properly coming under
that bureau.
All war accounts for money and prop
erty prior to 1871, have been examined
and transmitted to the treasury for final
settlement. During the fiscal year there
have been paid ror transportation on
railroads, $1,300,000, of which $S0,S57
was over the Pacific railroads. For
transportation by water, $62,637,352, and
by stage $48,975 84, and for the purchase
of transportation animals, wagons, hire
of teamsters, etc., $924,650 64, About
$370,000 have been collected from south
ern railroads during the year, leaviug'
about $4,000,000 still due. The quarter
master has examined and transmitted to
the accounting officers for settlement
$36,747,272 of claims by loyal citizens for
quartermasters' stores taken during the
war.
The subsisting supplies to the amount
ot $89,048 12 have been issued to the In
dians. The annual average of mean
strength of the army was 24,101 white,
and 2,494 . colored soldiers. The total
deaths for the year reported were 367
white and 54 colored.
The distribution of the medical and
surgical history of the war is yet to be
ordered by jongres3. There exists an
absolute necessity for a medical corps of
the full number established by act of
uougress of July 2th, 18WS, there being
now nity-mne vacancies, and the num
ber of successful candidates rarely ex
ceeds eight or ten in any one year.
The river and harbor improvements
have been carried on with energy and
economy. Though many are only par
tially completed, tne results have saved
to commerce many times the amount ex
pended, i he increase ot commerce with
greater depths of channels, greater se
curity in navigation and the saving of
time, adds millions to the wealth of the
country and increases the resources of
the government.
The bridge across the Mississippi river
at itock island has been completed, and
the proper site has been determined up
on lor the bridge at L.aurosse.
The able and exhaustive report made
uy the commission appointed to investi
gate the Sutro tunnel, has been trans
mitted to Congress.
SIGNAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT.
The observations and report of the
signal officer have been continued. Sta
tions have been maintained at each of
the principal lake, seaport and river cit
ies; ten additional stations have been
established in the United States and ar
rangements have been made for an ex
change of reports with Canada, and a
similar exchange ot observations is con
templated with the West India Islands
RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS.
The favorable attention of Cougressis
invited to the following recommenda
tions of the Secretary of War ; A dis
continuance ot the appointment ot extra
lieutenants to serve as adjutants and
quartermasters. . The adoption of a code
providing specific penalty for well de
nned offences so that tne inequality or
sentences adjudged by court martial
may be adjusted; the consolidation of
accounts under which expenditures are
made as a measure ot economy ; a reap
propriation of the money for the con
struction ot a depot at aan Antonio, the
title to the site being now perfected ; a
special act placing the cemetery at the
City of Mexico on the same basis as other
national cemeteries ; authority to pur
chase sites lor military posts lu Texas.
The appointment of commissary ser
geants from non-com missioned officers.
as a measure for securing the better care
and protection of supplies. An appro
priation oi tne catalogues to the ana
tomical section of the army medical mu
seum. A reappropriatiou of the amount
ror tne manulucture ot breech loading
arms should the selection be so delayed
oy tne ooard :ot ouiccrs as to leave the
former "appropriation unexpended at
the close of the fiscal year. The sale of
sucn arsenals east of the Mississippi as
cau be spared and the proceeds applied
to the establishment of one large arsenal
of construction and repair upon the At
lantic coast, aud the purchase of a suit
able site for a proving and experimental
ground for heavy ordnance; the abro
gation of laws which deprive inventors
in the United States service from deriv
ing any beuellt from their invention :
the repeal of the law prohibiting promo
tions in the stall' corps, a continuance of
the work upon the coast defences; the
repeal of the seventh section of the act
of Jnly 13, 1860, taking from engineers
and soldiers the per diem granted to
other troops; a limitation of time for
presentation of subsistence or supplies
under an act of July 4th, 1864, and a
modification in the mode of the selection
of cadets 'for the military- academy iu
order to enhance the usefulness of the
academv, which is impaired by reason
of the large amount of time necessarily
expended in giving new cadets a thor
ough knowledge of the more elementary
branches of learning which they should
acquire before entering the aaodeiny,
Also an appropriation for philosophical
apparatus and an increase in the num
qer and the pay of the iUlioiry Academy
band. ' .
The attention of Congress will be
called during the present session to vari
ous enterprises for the more certain and
cheaper transportation ot the constant
ly increasing surplus of the western and
southern products to the Atlantic sea
board.. The subject is one that will force
itself upon the legislative branch of tire
government sooner or later, and I sug
gest, therefore, that immediate steps be
taken to gain all available information
to insure equitable and just legislation
on a route to connect the Mississippi val-1
ley with the Atlantic at Charleston,
South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia,
by water, by the wayof the OM" and
Tennessee rivers and canals and slack-
water navigation to the Savanah and
Oomulgee rivers has been surveyed and
a report made by an accomplished engi
neer officer of the army. Second and
third new routes will be proposed for
the consideration of Congress, namely :
by an extension of the Kanawha and
James river canal to the Ohio, and by
anextension of the Cheaspeake and Ohio
canal. Iam not prepared .to recom
mend government aid to these or other
enterprises until it is clearly shown that
they are not only of national interest,
but that when completed they will oe oi
a value commensurate with their cost.
That production increases more rapidly
than the means of transportation in our
country, has been demonstrated by past
experience, that unprecedented growth
in population and products of the whole
country will require additional facilities
aud cheaper means for the more bulky
articles ot commerce to reach tide water,
and a market will be demanded in the
near future, is equally demonstrable. I
would thereiore suggest either a com
mittee or commission to be authorized to
consider this whole question and to re
port to Congress at some future day for
Its better guidance in legislating on the
important subject.
The railroads of the country have
been rapidly extended during the last
few years to meet the growing of pro
ducers and reflect much credit upon the
capitalists and managers engaged in this
construction. In addition to these, a
project to facilitate commerce by the
building of a ship canal around Niagara
Falls, ou the United States side, which
lias been agitated for many years, will
no doubt be called to your attention this
session. Looking to the great future of
the country, the increasing demands of
commerce, it might be well while on
this subject not only to have it exam
ined, and report upon the various prac
ticable routes for connecting the Missis
sippi with the tide water on the Atlan
tic, but the feasibility of an almost
laud-locked navigation from Maine to
Gulf of Mexice. Such a route along
our coast would be ot great value at all
times, and of inestimable value in case
of a foreign war. Nature has provided
the greater part of this route and the ob
stacles to be overcome are easily within
the skill of the engineeers, I have not
alluded to this subject with the view of
of having any further expenditures of
public money at this time than may be
necessary to procure and place all the
necessary information before Congress
in an authentic form, to enable it here
after, if deemed practicable and worthy,
to legislate ou the subject without .de-
lav.
The report of the Secretary of the
Navy herewith accompanying, explains
fully the condition of that branch of the
public service, its wants and delicencies,
expenses incurred during the past year
and appropriations for the same. 1 also
gives a complete history of the service;
of tlieJXavy for the past year - in addi
tion tc its regular services, it is evi
dent that unless steps are taken to pre
serve our Navy, that in a very few years
tho United States will be the weakest na
tion upon the ocean of all the great pow
ers. . With an energetic, progressive,
business people like ours, penetrating
and forming business relations with ev
ery part ot the known world, i a Navy
strong enough tocoin.nand the respect
of our flag abroad is uecessary for the
full protection of their rights. I recom
mend a careful consideration by Con
gress of the recommendations made by
the secretary ot tlie JS avy.
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The accompanying report of the Postmaster-General
furnishes a full and sat
isfactory exhibit of tlie operations of the
fost.onice .Department, during the year.
The ordinary revenue of the Depart
ment lor the fiscal year, ending June
30, 1872 amounted to $21,915,426.37, and
the expenditure :$26,65S,192.31. Com
pared with the previous fiscal year the
increase of revenue was $1,878,280.95,
or 937 per cent., and the increase of ex
penditures $2,268,088.23 or 920 per cent.
Adding to the ordinary revenue the an
nual appreciation of $700,000 for: free
matter, and the amounts paid to the sub
sidies on mail steamship lines from spec
ial appropriations, the detlcency paid
out ot the general Treasury was $3,317,
765.94, an excess of $3897,707.28 over the
deficiency for the year 1871. Other in
teresting statistical information relating
to our rapidly extending postal service
is furnished in this report, The total
length ot railroad mail routes on the
30th of June, 1872, was 57,911 miles.
6,577 additional miles of such service
having been put iuto operation during
tne year. .ignt new lines ot railway
post-orhces have been established, with
an aggregate length of 2,909 ciles. The
number of letters exchanged in the
mails with foreign countries was $24,
362,500, an increase of 4,066,502, or
twenty per cent, over the number in
1871, and the postage thereon amounts
to $127,125,725. The total weight of the
mails exchanged with European coun
tries exceeded 820 tons, . The cost of the
United States trar.s-Atlautlc mail steam
ship service, including the amounts paid
to the subsidized lines ol mail steamers,
was $1,027,020.67. The following are
the oiily steamships lines now receiving
subsides for mail service under special
acts of Congress: : The Pacific Mail
Steamship Company receive $500,000 per
anuum, lor carrying monthly mail be
tween San Francisco, Japan and China.
which will be increased to $1,000,000 per
annum for a semi-monthly mail, on and
after October 1, 1873. The United States
and Brazil Mail Steamship Company re
ceive $150,000 per annum for carrying
a monthly man between ew iork and
Kio de Jauerio, Brazil, and the ( 'alitor
nia, Oregon and Mexico Steamship Com
pany receive 75,000 per annum for carry
ing a monthly mail between ban 1 ran
cisco and Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands,
inaKing tne total amount ot mail steam
ship subsides at present $725,000 per an.
num. Our postal communications with
all parts of our civilized world have
been placed upon a most advantageous
footing by the Improved postal conven
tions, and the arrangements recently
concluded with the leading commercial
countries of Europe and America. The
gratilying statement is made that with
the conclusion of a satisfactory conven
tion witn d ranee, the details ot which
have been definitely agreed to by the
head of the French postal department.
subject to the approval or the Minister of
Fiuance,Uttle remains to be accomplished
by the treaty for the time to come, in re
spect to the reduction of rates for im
proved facilities for postal intercourse.
Your favorable consideration is respect-
iuuy invited to the recommendations
made by the Postmaster-General for an
increase of service from monthly to
semi-monthly trips ou the steamship
route to .Brazil; lor a subsidy inside ol
the establishment ot an Americau line
of mail steamers between San Francisco,
New Zealand and Australia; for the es
tablishment of post olfiecs,savlngs hanks
and for the increase of the salaries of
heads of bureaus.
I have heretofore recem mended the
abolition of the franking privilege, and
see no reason now for . changing my
views on that subject. It not having
been favorably regarded by Congress,
however, I now suggest a modification
that privilege to correct its glarlug and
costly abuses. I would recommend also
the appointment of it committee or com
mission to take into consideration the
best method, equitable to private cor
porations who have invested their time
and capital in the establishment of tele
graph lines of acquiring the title to nil
telegraph lines now in operation, and
of connecting this service with the post
al service ot the nation. It is not prob
able that this subject could receive the
proper consideration during the limits of
a short session of Congress, but it may
bu Initiated so that further action may
be fair to tho government aud to private
parties concerned. There are but three
lines of ocean steamers, namely: the Pa
cific mail steamship company, between
6an r ranciseo, China and japan, witn
provision made for semi-nionthly ser
vice after October 1st, 1873; the United
States abd Brazil line, monthly, and the
California, New Zealand and Australian
line,- monthly, plying ' between the
United States and foreign parts, and
owned and operated under onr flag. I
earnestly, recommend that such . liberal
contracts for carrying the mail be au
thorized with these lines as will insure
their continuance. If the expediency
of extending the aid of the government
to lines of steamers which hitherto have
not received it should be deemed worthy
of the consideration .of Congress. Po
litical aud commercial objects take it ad
visable to bestow such aid on a line un
der our .flag between, Panama and the
Western South American ports. By
this means much trade now diverted to
vther countries might be brought to n,
to the mutual advantage of this country
and those lying on that quarter of the
-continent 'of'-Amw lea.-r"The- .report - of
the Secretary of the Treasury will show
an alarming falling off in our carrying
trade for the last ten or twelve years,
and even tor the past year. 1 do not be
lieve that public treasury can be better
extended in the interest of the whole
people than in trying to recover this
trade. An expenditure of $5,000,000 per
annum for the next five years, if it
would restore to us our proportion of
the carrying trade of the world would
be profitably extended. The price of
labor in Jt-urope nas so much enhanced
within the last few years that that the
cost of building and operating ocean
steamers in the united states is not so
much greater, that I believe the time has
arrived for Congress to take this subject
into serious consideration.
The disbursements through the De
partment of Justice will be furnished
by the report of the Attorney General,
and though these have been somewhat
increased by the recent act of Congress
to enforce the rights of citizens of the
United States to vote . in the several
States of the Union, and to enforce the
provisions of the Fourteenth Amend
ment to the Constitution of the united
States and other amendments thereto, I
cannot question the necessity aud salu
tary enects ot these enactments. Reck
less and lawless men, I regret to say,
have associated themselves together in
some localities to deprive other cities of
the right guarranteed to them by the
Constitution of the United States, and to
that end have committed deeds of vio
lence,, but the prosecution and punih
mentor many of these persons have
tended greatly to the repression of such
disorders. I do not doubt that a great
majority of the people in all parts of the
country favor the full enjoyment by all
classes of persons of these rights, to
which they are entitled uader the Con
stitution and the laws, and I envoke the
aid and influence of all good citizens to
prevent organizations whose objects are
by unlawful means to interfere with
those rights. I look with confidence to
the time, not far distant, when the ob
vious advantages of good order and
peace will induce an abandonment of all
combinations prohibited by the acts re
ferred to, and when it will be unneces
ary to carry on . prosecutions or inflict
punishment' to protect citizens from
the lawless doings of such combinations.
Applications have been made to 'me to
pardou persons convicted of aviolation of
said acts upon the ground that clemency
in such cases would tend to tranquilize
the public mind, and to test the virtue of
that policy, lam disposed, as far as my
sense of justice will permit, to give to
these applications a favorable considera
tion ; but any action thereon is not to be
construed as indicating any change in
my deterinination'to enforce with vigor
such acts, so long as the conspiracies and
combinations therein named disturb the
peace of the country. It is much to be
regretted, aiid is' regretted by no one
more than myself; that a necessity has
ever existed to execute the enforcement
act. .No one cau desire more than I
tli.it the necessity , of applying it may
never agaiu be demanded.
DEPARTMENT OP THE INTERIOR.
! The Secretary of the Interior reports
Satisfactory improvement and ' progres
sion in each or the several bureaus un
der the control of the Interior Depart
ment:' They are' all in excellent condi
tion.- The work, which in some of them
for some years has been in arrears, has
been brought down to a recent date, and
in nu tne current Business has been
promptly dispatched. . " ,
-' ' .. '',, -V THK INDIANS.'.'
The policy which was adopted at the
beginning of the administration with re
gard to the management of the Indians
has been as successful as. its most ar
dent friends anticipated. Within so
short a time it lias reduced the expense
of their management, decreased their
forages on the white settlements, tended
to give the largest .opportunity to the
extension of the great railways through
the public domain, and the pushing of
settlements into more remote districts or
the country, and at the same time im
prove the condition of the Indians, The
policy will be maintained without any
change, excepting such as further ex
perience may show to be necessary to
render it more efficient. The subject of
converting tne so-caiied Indian Terri
tory, south ot Kansas, into a home for
the Indians, and erecting thereon a ter
ritorial form of government, is one of
great importance as a complement of the
existing Indian policy. , The question of
removal to tne territory has within the
past year been presented to many of the
trioes resident upon other and less desi
rable portions of the public domain, and
has generally been received . by them
with favor. As a preliminary step to
the organization of such a territory, it
win ue uecessary to comine tne Indians
now residents therein to farms of proper
size, which should be secured to them in
fee ; tne residue to be used for the set
tlement of other friendly Indians. . Ef
forts will be made in the immediate fu
ture to induce the removal of as manv
peaceably disposed Indians only to the
Indian territory as can be settled proo-
erly without disturbing the harmony of
I nose aireauy tnere. There is no other
location now available . where
people who are endeavoring to
acquire a knowledge of pastoral aud ag
ricultural pursuits cau oe as wen accom
modated as upon the unoccupied lauds
in the Indian Territory.
A territorial government should, how
ever, protect the Indians from the in
roads of whites lor a term of years, un
til they become sufficiently advanced in
the arts of civilization to guard their
own rights, and from the disposal of
lauus ncid uy them lor the same period.
SALE OF PUBLIC LANDS.
During the last fiscal year there were
disposed of out ot the public lands 11,
801,975 acres, a quantity greater by
1,092,210 acres tbati was disposed of the
previous year, ui mis amount 1,370,
320 acres were sold for cash. 389.460
acres located with military warrants,
4,671,332 acres taken for 'homesteads,
uuj,oi3 acres located witu college scrip,
3,554,887 acres granted to railroads,
465,347 acres granted to wagon roads.
714,255 acres given to States as swamp
lanu, anu o.iou acres located by Indian
scrip.
The cash receipts from all sources in
the land office amounted to $3,218,100.
During the same period 22,010,608 acres
of the public lands were surveyed,
which, added to the quantity before sur
veyed, amounts to 083,364,780 acres,
leaving 1,257,633,628 acres of the public
laud yet unsurveyed. The reports from
the subordinates ot the Land Office con
tain interesting information In regard to
their respective districts. They uni

PATENT.
During the year ending September,
30th, 1872, there were issued from the
patent ottlee 13,030' patents, 232 exten
sions, and 554' certificates -and registers
of trade marks. ' During the same time
19,587 applications for patents, includ-
ceived, and 3,100 caveats filed. The fees
received during the same period
amounted to $70,095,985. and the total
expenditures to $62,355,390, making the
net receipts over the expenditures
$7,750,050. Since 1830, two hundred
thousand applications for patents have
been filed, and about 134,000 patents
issued, tho officers being conducted un
der the same laws and general organiza
tion us were adopted at their original in
auguration, . when only from oue
hundred to five hundred applications
were made pur annum. The Commis
sioner shows that the office has out
grown the original plan, and that a new
organization has become necessary.
This subject was presented to Congress
in a special communication in b ebruary
last, which met my approval and the
approval of the Secretary ot the interior,
and the suggestions contained in said
communication were embraced in a bill
that was reported to the House by the
Committee on. Patents at the last ses
sion. 'The subject of the reorganization
of the Patent office, as contemplated by
the bill referred to, is one of such im
portance to the industrial inter
ests of the country that I commend it
to the attentiou of Congress. The com
missioner also treats the subject ot the
separation of the Patent office from the
Department of the Interior. This sub
ject ss also embraced in the bill hereto
fore referred to. The commissioner
complains of the want of room for the
model gallery and for the working force
and necessary2 files of the office. It is
impossible to transact the business of the
office properly without more room in
which to arrange files and drawings
that must be consulted hourly in the
transaction of business. The whole of
Patent office building will soon be
needed, if it is not already, lor tne ac
commodation of the business of the Pat
ent office.
PENSIONS.
The amount paid for pensions in the
last fiscal year was $30,169,310, an
amount larger by $3,708,434 than was
paid during tne preceedlug year. Of
this amount $2,313,409 was paid under
the act of Congress of February 17,
1871, to survivors of the war of 1812.
The annual increase of pensions by the
legislation of Congress -has more than
Kept even witn tne natural yearly losses
from the rolls. The act of Congress of
June 8, 1812, has added an estimated
amount of $7a0,000 per annum to the
rolls, without increasing the number of
pensioners. We cannot, therefore, look
for any substantial decrease in the ex
penditures of this department for some
time to come, or so long as Congress
continues to so change the rates of pen
sion. The whole number of soldiers en
listed in the war of the rebellion was
268,523. The total number of claims for
invalid pensions is 176,000, being but six
per cent, of the whole number of en
listed men. The total number of claims
on . hand at the beginning of the vear
was ai,o&a; tne number received during
the year was 26,574; the number dis
posed ot was 35,168, making a net gain
of 1,264. The number of claims now on
file is 79,085. On the 30 of June. 1872.
there were on the rolls the names of
94,50 invalid military pensioners, 113,51
widows, orphans and dependent rela
tives, making an aggregate of 209,023
army pensioners. At the same time
there were on the rolls the names of
1,449 navy pensioners, and 1,730 wid
ows, orphans and dependent relatives,
making the whole number of naval pen
sioners 3,179; There have been re
ceived since the passage of the act to
provide pensions tor the survivors of the
war of 1812, 36,551 applications prior to
J une 30, 1872. Of these there were al
lowed during the last fiscal year 20,126
cimms: 4.S4o were rejected during the
year, leaviug 11,580 claims pending at
mat date. .Tne numDer ot pensions or
all classes granted during the last fiscal
year was 23,838; during that period
there were dropped from the rolls for
various causes 9,104 names, leaving a
grand total of 232,229 pensioners on the
rolls on the 30 of June, 1872. It is
thought that the claims tor pensions on
account of the war of 1812 will be dis
posed of by the 1st of May 1873. It is
estimated that 930,430,000 will be re
quired lor the pension service during
tne next nscai year.
,.:,.'' THE CENSUS.
The ninth census is about completed.
Its completion is a subject'of congratula
tion, inasmuch as the use to be made of
the statistics therein contained depends
very greatly on tue promptitude or pub
lication. The Secretary of the Interior
recommends that a census be taken in
187o, which recommendation should re
ceive the ready attention of Congress,
The interval at present established be
tween, federal census is so long that the
information obtained at the decenial pe
riods as to tue material condition. wants.
and resources of the nation is of little
practical value after the expiration of
tne nrst nait or that period, it would
probably obviate the constitutional pro
vision regarding tne decennial census,
li a sensus taken in laio should be in
vested of all political character and no
reapportionment of Congressional rep
resentation oe maue miner it. such a
census, coming as it would in the last
year ot tne nrst century ot our national
existence, would furnish a noble monu
ment of the progress of the United
states during that century.
EDUCATION.
. The rapidly increasing interest in ed
ucation is a most encouraging feature in
the current history of the country, and
it is no oouot true tnat this is due in i
great measure to the effects of the Bu
reau of Education. That office is con
tinually receiving evidences which
abundantly prove Its efficiency, from
the various institutions of learning and
educators of all kinds throughout the
country. The report of the commis
sioner contains a vast amount or educa
tional details of great interest. The bill
now pending before Congress providing
for the appropriation of part of the pro
ceeds oi tne saies oi public lauds lor ed
ucational purposes, to aid the states in
the general education of their rising
generatiau is a measure of such great
importance to our real progress, aud is
so unanimously aproved bv the leading
friends of education, that I commend it
tne favorable attention of Congress.
TERRITORIAL AFFAIRS.
Affairs in the territories are generally
satisfactory. The energy and business
capacity or the pioneers who are settling
up the vast domains not yet incorporated
iuto states, are keeping pace in internal
improvements aud civil government
with the older communities. In but
one of them, Utah, is the condition of
anairs unsatisfactory. .Except so far as
tne quiet or tue citizen may be disturbed
bp real or imaginary danger of Indian
hostilities, it has seemed to be the policy
of the Legislature of Utah to evade all
responsibility to the government of the
United States, and even to hold a posi
tion in hostility to it. 1 recommend a
careful revision of the preseut laws of
tne Territory by congress, and the en
actment ot such a law. as the one pro
posed in Congress at its last session, for
instance, or something similar to it, as
will secure peace, the equality of all cit
izens before the law, and the ultimate
extinguishment of polygamy.

tie to the most casual visitor. The na
tion, being a large owner of property iu
this city, should bear with the 'citizens
of the district a just share of the expense
of these improvements. I recommend,
therefore, an appropriation to reimburse
the citizens from the work done by them
along and in front of public crouiuls
during the past year, and liberal appro
priations iu orcier tnat improvement and
embellishment of the public buildings
and grounds may keep pace with the
improvements made by territorial au
thor ities.
. AGRICULTURE.
The report of the Commisioner of Ag-
jiculture gives a very full aud Interest
ing account of the several divisions of
that department the horticultural, ag
ricultural, statistical, entomological and
chemical and the benefits conferred by
each upon the agricultural interests of
the country. The whole report is a com
plete history in detail of the workings
of that department in all its branches,
showing the manner in which the farm
er, merchant and miner is informed,
and the extent to which he Is aided in
his pursuits. The commissioner makes
one recommendation that measures be
taken by Congress to protect and induce
tho plan ting of lorests, and suggests
that no part of the public lands should
be disposed of without the condition that
one-tenth of it be reserved In timber,
where it exists, and where it does not
exist, inducements should bo offered for
planting It.
CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION.
In accordance with the terms of the
act of Congress, approved March 3, 1872,
providing for the celebration of the one
hundredth anniversary of American in
dependence, a commission has been or
ganized .consisting ot two members from
each of the States aud territories. The
commission lias held two sessions and
has made satisfactory progress in the or
ganization and in the initiatory steps
necessary lor carrying ont the provis
ions of the act, and for executing the
provisions also of the act of June 1,
1871, creating a Centennial Board of
Finance. A prelimitnary report of pro
gress has been received from the Presi
dent of the commission, and is herewith
transmitted, it will be the duty ot the
commission at your coming session to
transmit a report ot the progress made.
and to lay beeore you the details relat
ing to the exhibitions ot American and
foreign arts, products and manufactures
which by the terms of the act is to be
held under tho auspices of the govern
ment of the United States, in the city of
Philadelphia, in the year 1876. This
celebration will be looked forward to by
American citizens with great interest as
marking a century of great progress
and prosperity than is recorded in the
history ot any other nation, and proving
a further good purpose in bringing to
gether on our sou people of all the com
mercial nations of the earth in a matter
calculated to secure international good
teeiing.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
An earnest desire has been felt to cor
rect the abuses which have grown up in
the civil service of the country, through
the defective method of making appoint
ments to office, which has been regarded
too much as the reward of political ser
vices. Under authority ot Congress,
rules have been established to regulate
the terms of office and the mode of ap
pointments. It cannot be expected that
any system or rule can be entirely ef
fective and prove a perfect remedy tor
the existing evils until they have been
thoroughly tested by actual practice,
and amended according to the require
ments of the service. During my term
of office it shall be my best endeavor to
so apply the rules as to secure the great
est possible reform in the civil service of
the government, but it will require the
direct attention of Congress to render
the enforcement of the system binding
upon ray successors, and I hope that the
experience of the past year, together
with appropriate legislation by con
gress, may reach a satisfactory solution
of the question, and secure to the public
service, for all time, a practical method
of obtaining faithful and efficient officers
and employees U. . tiKAJNT.
