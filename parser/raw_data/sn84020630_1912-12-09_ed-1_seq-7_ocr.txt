BOB WHITE PLENTY.
Eiht and ten coveys of Ihe Mob
While quails have been seen between
here and Artesia this season. Six
y urs fifio, there was not a liob White
in New .Mexico. .1. V. McMurray, who
owns the .McMurray farm eight miles
east on t ho river, conceived the idea
thai this special breed of quail would
ii row here, after they became used
to the country, and accordingly set
out lift ecu dozen. That they have
propoKutcd can be judged from the
number now here.
Immediately alter

.Mr. Saunders says that if tin- p"o
plo do not kill these covers, in a few
years there will be plenty of good
Hob White hunting.
.Mr. Saunders says thai at first it
was thought they could not propo
xate here owing to litem nesting in
alfalfa and the hay was oil three
cud five times a year, not allowing
Ihe eggs to hatch as the eggs were
destroyed. The birds, however, have
overcome that and are now nesting in
he dry fields near alfalfa fields.--Kos- i

A NECESSARY ORGANIZATION.
Several weeks ago we called atten
tion to the necessity of organization
of ihe farmers for Ihe disposal of
their products. With or without, the
southern outlet the farmers of this
section will never be able to get the
xahje of their crops without, proper
organization. A large organization is
letter than a small one, in that the
more cars of fruit they can handle
the hotter facilities they will have to
keep in touch with the market, and
the better prices they can obtain for
the grower.
Au organization of the entire San j
Juan basin to handle not only fruits, j
but vegetables and produce of all t
kinds with a competent man at its !
head will do more towards the pros-j
perity of this sectioji than any other!
happening, excepting the southern
outlet. Such an organization would
insure a uniform pack, the ability to
reaiy artistic publication should
do a great deal of good in calling at
tention to Xew .Mexico and to Dona
Ana county in particular.
The Xew .Mexican cordially congra
tulates Editor LaPoint on the publi
cation of so choice and progressive an
edii ion.
WATER FLOWING FROM WELL.
At a depth of 1,740 feet water was
struck in the experiment well being
drilled at the .Maxwell farm. The
contract for the well was for 1,750
feet. The water was found within ten
feel of the limit of the contract. The
water is flowing out of the top of the
well in a good size stream, and is
j growing stronger. The water lias a
j pleasant taste, slightly mineral, with
ja temperature of 5S degrees.

BIG DEAL IN CATTLE.
Colonel Ike T. I'ryor, former pivsi- t
Idcnt. of the l tittle Raisers' association
j of Texas, and one of the most promi
nent cattle nieii of ihe west, has pur
j chased from Airs. Jack llardesty and
j Mrs. James llolsteiu ihe land and cat-
tie of the XAX ranch. The ranch is
one of the largest in Urant county
i and stretches for thirty miles along t
the .Mimbres river. The deal includes!
' some lo.iioo liead of cattle and the old t
llolsteiu ranch with its irrigated fields!
and orchards. The purchase price was ;
not made public, but it must he a
large one, as the property is very val-j
liable. Part of the land was located ;
many years ago by the late Sim llol-i
stein, and other portions have been
acquired by purchase and lease.
Colonel Pryor announces that he ;
will immediately proceed to stock the'1
ranch to its full capacity, which he
considers to he about iXOilu head.

I board in administering; the 'tuberculin j
test to all cows in Xew .Mexico, from
which milk or milk products are used
;as human food. This test has been
! contemplated for some time but de- I
' finite arrangements were not made.
! until within the last few days. .'
; similar test to this was made about;
three years ago. However, at that.!
-time Roswell was en. ploying a city!
veterinarian, so the state and federal i
; officers did not make -any tests in and'
around Roswell. This time nil cows'
in Roswell as well as the surrounding !
towns will be included in the test.1
; This test will be administered en-1
tirely free of charge to the cattle j
owners. The federal government will

' Washington. Dec. !. President ' is to
I alt is now dmng a stunt similar to
that performed by the unjust steward.
I I will be recalled that that gentle
man, linding that his job was to an
end, called in his master's creditors
and released Ibeir bills on the basis of
fifty cents on the dollar and even
less. They were told, if they owed one
hundred bushels to sit down quickly
and write fifty. The motive, as ex
plained, was in order that the cred
itors might become friends of the un
just steward and when he was finally
cast out might take him into their
houses.
Daily Ihe records are clogged with!
aecounlB of pos tmasters reappointed I
for new four year terms, diplomats '
promoted to higher and better jobs,
and federal judges nominated for life
term places in sp.ite .of the protests of 1
constituents who are familiar with
their special privilege records. Sloan j
in Arizona and Howard in Washing-'
ton are examples, !
Hut the senate is not very keen for'
, this unjust steward program. There
are some democratic creditors just
outside the door and they don't want
i the estate entirely dissipated before
they have a chance to present their
ibills.
Victor .M unlock pulled through with
a handsome majority. He admits,
however, that in the storm and stress
of the campaign there were moments
when be was not very sanguine. His
opponent was an old-fashioned Abe
Lincoln oiatoi. This man, as Miudock
tells the story, had a peroration -on ;
love that made Vie wilt every tinae
he. heard it. One day Murdock met ;
one of his farmer constituents and the:
latter asked: "How about it, Vic?'' j
"Oh, I'm certain to be elected," re-;
plied MurOuck.
The farmer chewed a straw und
looked at hiiri.
"You're certain, but I suppose you're!
like me; you'd give a cow to be sure."
In Washington there is a little
coterie of correspondents who ex
change news and who are known as
the "carbon copy boys." One nigliJ
recently one of them was hammering I
away at his typewriter when a mem-,
her of the association came in and .
fired in the usual question: I
'What're you writing?"
'Letter to my wife," replied the cor-;
respondent. !
Put in a carbon for me," said the j
other.
President Taft is preparing a con-'
publications, entitled, "What
become of the Republican
Party?" It is understood that the
'symposium will be additionally en
' riched by contributions from Gover
nor lladley and Senators l'enrose,
iCuggenhoim and Crane,
i liven from the investor's point of
view the Xew lingland railway mo
nopoly has its interest. .Most of the
stock of the Xew York, Xew Haven
j and Hartford is owned by Massachu
setts people. There is a law which ex
empts local corporate securities from
I taxation and practically prescribe;
: them as investments for estates held
in trust. There are Hil.unu Massachu
setts stockholders interested in Ine
; Xew Haven property. When they
i bought the stock it was worth about
i l'".". It is now worth about 1:!:!, and '
the eight per cent on par which comes
in dividends is not being earned hut
. is being appropriated out of capital.
j This is one result of the reckless use '
I of money in buying out threatened
! competition and suppressing rivals,
'file properties have not. been well
administered and instead of increased !
efficiency, tliere is a growing accident
rate and well-based complaint of poor
service. Xow; it is up to the state of
Massachusetts to use its final reserve1
power, which is state ownership. I
After the election, William Kent ad
dressed a letter to his constituents in
which he thanks them for leaving
him free from party labels, "free to
associate and to work with members
of any and all parties that are going
the way of human advancement. " He
announces his purpose lo support
Wood row Wilson in anything under
taken by the new president in the line
' of "social and economic justice at
home and peace and goodwill
abroad." J ! says:
"I was glad when be was nominat
ed, believing lie was the best. man his
party could select. 1 agreed with al
most all his clearly expressed views.
My respect, for him has increased by
leason of Ihe dignity and fairness he
has shown throughout, bis campaign.
I believe he will sincerely strive for
those things that are progressive and
unselfish men believe to be needful-
that, his work will be given to estab
lish real democracy on the ruins of
privilege and pbilocrucy."
The house has passed a resolution
authorizing the appointment at a sal
ary of $; i per month of a messenger
to the committee on the disposition of
useless papers. This does not in
clude President Taft's messages.
