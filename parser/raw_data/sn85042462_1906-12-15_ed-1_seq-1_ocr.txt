City Attorney Recommends Passage of
Ordinance, in Order to Expedite
Friendly Suit and Judi
cial Decision
For three hours yesterday afternoon
the Los Angeles city council heard
arguments on the proposition of the
Harrlman trolley Interests In Lor An
geles to Instal $5,000,000 worth of im
provements and to build subways and
extensions preparatory to shortening
the time to the, beach cities.
City Attorney' Mulhews, through his
assistant, Mr. Hewitt, reported con
cerning the franchises and privileges
asked for, giving it as his i pinion that
though the railroad company owned
all the hill property at California street
lt could not get a perpetual franchise
for a tunnel there. He did not concede
the company's point that the city char
ter did nut cover ■■•an underground
privilege there, maintaining that the
21-year2 1-year law applied there as well as at
I other points.
".The. company maintains that It can
On as it likes with Its own property,
but just \ as;, freely concedes that
franchises are required on Flower street
and , Vermont avenue for surface
crossings t and \ for ■ tunnel privileges
where, they run under city streets,
, ;. especial^ If near enough to the surface
■ to affect' mains, pipes and conduits.
/ Most of the session yesterday was
taken up with arguments by Judge
. John D. Pope for the : ,os Angeles
. Pacific and Interurban railways, At-
■ ■ torney Hewitt for the city and Coun
;•;;;•; cilman Hougrhton, Messrs. Blair and
Holmes, representing property owners,
also added their oratory. L

-. the contest the entry of property,
owners "n Hill street,* Sunset boule
vard and in adjoining territory. . '
; -They are aligned with the street car
company, in asking for the tunnels, as
they say they will not only greatly en
hance-; their property but give an out
let and Inlet for the northwestern sec
tions of Los Angeles. '
lnI In response to questions as to the
most expeditious j way. to have the
points at issue judiciouslly determined
Mr. Hewitt suggested to the council
that a friendly suit could follow en
actment of the ordinances prayed for.
Another way would be for the rail
road company to begin work on the'
tunnels regarless of permit, at which
the city could bring an injunction.
This litigation might, however, drag
through years.
The result of the afternoon session,
was to instruct the- city attorney to
prepare the necessary ordinances and
submit them to the council Monday
afternoon.
CITES DECISIONS
FAVORING GRANTS
FOR SUBWAYS
In framing their opinions for the
guidance of the city council Attorneys
W. B. Mathews and Leslie Hewitt had
under consideration a digest of opin
ions furnished by the able legal staff:
of the Harriman trolley interests, head
ed by Judge John R, Pope.
These represent expert delving into
law reports sustaining the company's
contention that ownership of land
(not streets) nests exclusively with
property owners, regardless of any sur
face rights of cities, on this basis of
reasoning the city would have no con
trol even of streets except for a depth
sufficrent to carry water* sewer, gas
and cl»>etrlc pipes anil conduits and
the surface proper.
Here are the authorities cited:
•The excavation by the plaintiffs of
the area under the sidewalk was not
unlawful. They own to the center of
the street, KUbjeet to the right of way
of the public over the surface. For
any interference with this right of way
the plaintiffs would have been respon
sible. Hut so long as they did no in
jury to the street they were at liberty
to use the space under It, as they might
any other part of their property." —
McCarthy vh Syracuse, 49 N. V., 194,
l!l!l.
(In Ibis case plaintiffs were allowed
to recover for damages done by water
to goods In their cellar under the side
walk, the water having gotten into the,
oellax from a defective sewer.)
"Upon the location of a highway the
publ|o acquire an easement not unlaw
fully to be interrupted by the owner
of the land, but the soil and freehold
remain in the owner for every purpose
of use and protit consistent with such
easement; he may maintain ejectment
tor It and he may sink a water-course
below the surface, covering it bo that
the highway remains safe and con
valient for passage." — Perley vs
Chandler, 6 Mass. 453: Am. Dec, 159.
"Where a road Is laid out over the
land of a private person the public
acquire no more than the right of way,
with the powers and privileges incident
to such right. The former owner re
tains the fee on the road and may
maintain trespass, ejectment or waste
ln relation to it."— Jackson vs Hatha
way, 15 J. R., 447; 8 Am. Dec, 263.
"It must be remembered throughout
this whole consideration, however, that
the railway company condemns and
takes only the easement of the use of
the surface of the ground; Code Civ.
l'l-oc. out); and does not take the own
er's estate in the minerals, or the right
to work the ground for the minerals if
he can do' so by not Interfering with
the railway's estate In the easement."

DOUBTS
RUSSIA
Japan Insists on the
"Open Door"
Mistrusts C/ar's Good
Intentions
Diplomatic Relations Between Coun.
tries Strained by Publication
of a Dispatch from
Nagasaki
By Associated Press.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 14.— The re
lations of the Russian and Japanese
diplomats, who are. negotiating a treaty
of commerce, have been seriously
strained by the publication of a dis
patch obviously Inspired from Naga
saki, reflecting upon the good faith of
Russia regarding the "open door." and
Insinuating that aho la evading the
stipulations of the Portsmouth treaty
in the matter of getting her troops out
of Manchuria.
This Janaese statement is character
ized here as a tissue of Inexactitudes
designed to Influence public opinion
while Japnn is taking advantage of
Russia's weakness to obtain profit
never contemplated by the treaty of
Portsmouth.
Particular apprehension Is felt here
over the effect that the Japanese in
sinuations with regard to the "open
door" may have upon American sentl
mpnt.
As nn evidence of Russia's sincere
adherence to that principle, it is ex
plained thnt she is even contemplating
'Micuiiig international navigation to the
Amur and Sungarl rivers.
The navigation of these rivers was
reserve^ by the treaty of Aigun of 1858
to Russia and China jointly, but Russia
Insists that Japan can under no In
struction of the Portsmouth treaty de
mand this as a right.
Japan bases her pretensions to the
'navigation of the rivers on the ground
that the treaty was abrogated by the
treaty of Portsmouth and the Chlno-
Japanese treaty of 1905, by which all
agreements Infringing upon the sov
ereignty of China were nullified and
Manchuria opened to International
I trade.
Russia contends that joint navigation
of these rivers does not infringe upon
the sovereignty of China nor prevent
the entrance of foreign goods Into
Manchuria.

TO SEND MESSAGE
ON THE JAPANESE
Roosevelt Will Spring Sensation When
He Transmits Metcalfs Report,
Is Statement — Will Urge
Centralization
By Associated Press.
CHICAGO, Dec. 14.— A dispatch to the
Chicago Record-Herald from Washing
ton says a special message on the Jap
anese question and the California
school problem supplementary to the
discussion of theße same subjects by
President Roosevelt in his regular mes
sage will be sent to congress from the
White House next Tuesday.
It is said authoritatively that this
special message will be more vigorous
in tone than the former communication
and will not be so calculated as to cool
the Irritation of Callfornlans previously
aroused.
The special message, moreover, aside
from its local application, will be one
of the most important communications
in the entire list of those sent to con
gress by the present executive.
Will Be a Climax
It will bring to a direct issue the
centralization schemes of government,
which is likely to form the climax of
endeavor on the part of the Roosevelt
administration.
The administration is about to take
advanced ground regarding the doc
trine of federal supremacy over state
sovereignty. The Japanese question
raised in connection with the public
schools of California has supplied the
opportunity to give forcible expression
to the mighty scheme of centraliza
tion that is to be perfected if possible.
It is not possible at this writing to
forecast In detail what, the president
will say In hie second message on the
Japanese question.
Will Send Metcaff's Report
Accompanying- his message which it
is understood will be a full explanation
of the administration's projected pol-|
Wcy as to the supremacy of federal over '
state power, will be the report of the
special Investigation of the San Fran
cisco school question made by Secre
tary of Commerce and Labor Metcalf.
Regardless of the nature of this re
port the president will adhere vigor
ously to the position taken by him in
his regular message, which was writ
ten before he left Washington to visit
the canal zone and before he had any
thing at all from Secretary Metcalf.
Report Will Show Sensation
But as to the Metcalf report it has
been learned that its author found
much to condemn in the matter of the
treatment of the Japunese outside of
the school question.
His report, in fact, will furnish a
new sensation.
It will show, it is understood, labor
union tyranny over Japanese which af
fects the rights held to be their by
treaty even in more pronounced man
ner than anything connected with the
school Imbroglio.
Matters of this nature embraced In
Secretary Metcalfs report will furnish
the key for many arguments to be ad
vanced by the president in his mes
sage.

William P. L,awlor today overruled the
technical objection Imposed by Super
visor Fred P. Nicholas and Peter M.
Duffy to the Indictment found against

It was pronounced by the judge that

objection • was made that Wise had
served on a trial jury within a year and

Immediately after the judge an
nounced his decision, which was given
orally. Attorney Murphy rose in be
half of his clients and asked that an
