It may be that a President stands in
Cleveland's shoes. He was honored last
week in New York City by the Manhat
tan Club, and made a sensible speech on
the occasion. The next day he spent
couple of hours with Samuel J. Tilden
at Uraniercy Park. The Governor-elect
of New York, is a man of plain, com
inon serine, and favors nothing like
slap-trap.

The Tariff Commission, though strong
for reduction, find the existing tariff so
full of abominations, that they recom
mend 20 per cent reduction, and in some
rases more.
This is a confession worthy of consid
eration and remembering. Here are
tariff men admitting the iniquity that
has been oppressing the people, and
that the Democratic party has been de
nouncing as a swindle for long years,
The President says:
There has been substantial accord
the doctrine that only such taxes ought
to be levied as are necessary for a wise
and economical administration of the
Government.
He also declares: that all internal taxes
save those that relate to distilled spirits
can be prudently abrogated, and that
alter tnis large reductions irom tne cus
toms revenue are entirely leasiDier
All this is just what Democrats have
been claiming. President Arthur evi
dently believes In "a tariff for revenue
only.

The favored capitalists will try and in
timidate Congress, so as to hold on to
their bounties. Already comes a des
patch from St. Louis, setting forth that
the largest tobacco factory in that city
has been closed, and that 4,000 people
are likely to, be thrown ont of employ
ment, "owing to the agitation in Con-
"gress of questions connected with the
"tobacco tax." If Congress la going to
reduce, the less delay the better. The
Republican party la now reduced to the
necessity of undoing its own work; and
it knows not where to begin, though ad
mitting the necessity.
The Supreme Court of the United
States has just decided the long con
troversy and litigation about the well
known Arlington estate, opposite Wash
ington, awarding the estate to the heirs
of General Robert B. Lee's wife. Of
cour they do not propose to occupy it,
as it is used as a Government cemetery
and a sad place it is and for other
public purposes, but will relinquish
their rights on a Just compensation for
the property. The Supreme Court bases
its decision on the constitutional pro
visions that no person shall be deprived
of life, liberty or property without dne
process of law, nor private property,
taken for public use. without just com
pensation. A minority of the Justices dissented.
Including Chief Jnstlee Walt and Jus
tices Gray, Bradley nd Woods.
REDUCING TAXES,
Seems to be agreed upon all round, but
we observe great diversity of opinion
among Congressmen. Some would have
a curtailment of receipts brought about
exclusively by a lowering of tariff du
ties; Mr. Folger, in his Treasury
report, wonld cut down the in
ternal revenue to some extent, yet
wonld make changes in the tariff the
principal source of shrinkage; while the
President recommends that all internal
taxes, save those imposed upon distilled
spirits, be abolished, and, at the same
time (not perceiving, apparently, the
Incompatibility of his suggestions,) that
the tariff be so revt-ted as to enlarge the
free list, and to sensibly reduce the du
ties on other articles. Whatever is
done, the curtailment should be suffi
cient This thing of a large surplus of
revenue is all wrong, oppressing the
people and endangering business.
According to Secretary Folger, the to-,
tal revenue of the Federal Government
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1883,
will be 1415,000,000. The total ex pendi
tures, including the provision for the
sinking fund, and .the payments on ac
count of the pension swindle, will be
in round numbers f 339,412,000. This
should give at the end of the curren
fiscal year a surplus of 75,578,000.
This session of Congress must provide
for the fiscal year beginning July 1,
1883, and if no curtailment of taxes
should be made, a similar surplus would
come the next fiscal year. The trouble
is, that an over-abund inee of money In
the Treasury leads to all manner of jobs
and corruption. We hope to see thor
ough reform. Cut down the revenues;
cnrtall expenses; compel economy in all
directions. This government was not
formed to benefit a few persons and rob
the masses of the people; but to "estab
lish justice and secure the blessings of
liberty." This means equal opportuni
ties and equal taxation.
If the present Congress could manage
to exhibit an unhesitating devotion
solely to the best interests of the country.
together with a marvellous capacity for
the swift transaction of business, it
might wind up its career with a per
fect boom. The stars would then be
propitious. Repository.
"If I" It Is difficult to learn old dogs

litical leaders to abandon old ways and
adopt new and better modes. Men ac

instead of the public good, are not likely
to bout face and become unselfish in
their political action.
No doubt, such sham 'statesmen as
Secor Robeson, Chandler, Keifer, Page,
Jay Hubbell, and the rest, have had a
terrible lesson from the people; and
they would like to allay the storm. In
this view they are ready to adopt sur
reptitious ways, and resort to craft
rather than adopt honest, straight for
ward action. Such moderate reductions
of taxation as they dare not resist, they
will try to adji.'st so as to serve the inter
ests of the large manufacturers whose
pecuniary contributions have heretofore
been useful to the Republican party,
and so as to leave undiminished the
huge army of office holders by whose
assessments campaign funds are creat

publican party will not favor any great
salutary reform such as is recommended
in the President's message. The leaders
think they would utterly ruin the party,

connty for Jonathan Wallace, and also
the two votes returned for J. H. Wallace,
as for Jonathan H. Wallace, leaving Mo
Kinley a majority of one in the district,
thus awarding him the certificate of
election. It is stated that the Board is
still in doubt as to its alleged judicial
functions, but nave so far resolved this
doubt as to count the votes having the
initial letter or tne christian nam's of
the several candidates. In this, possibly,
the Board has slightly exceeded the
scope of its ministerial duties, so far, at
least, as to taxe cognizance, to a limited
extent, or wnat judge rnurman desig
nates as the presumptive evidence in
the case, not going so far, however, as
to connt votes which manifestly would
require substantiating evidence to make
the intent of the voter clear. But as yet

as its first decision. Repository, 9th.

rather than one. And, truly, when the
Board opened the door and was governed
in their action by the plain Jntent of

could stop where they did. The votes
for "Major Wallace" and for "Maj. Wal
lace" were plainly intended for- Jona

TAXATION AND WHO OPPOSE ITS
REDUCTION.
The vote In the Committee on Ways
and Means last week is an answer to
the suppositions of the Republican press
and Washington specials, that the Dem
ocrats will impede the reduction of
taxation at this session. The vote in
Committee, on reporting a bill repeal
ing every form of the tax on tobacco,
one of the most oppressive and unequal
of the Internal taxes, stood six to five,
four Democrats and two Republicans
voting for repeal, and four Republicans
and one Democrat against. Mr. Morri
son of Illinois, was the only Democrat
against repeal, and he is an advanced
revenue reformer, and Insists on modi
fying the tariff, making "substantial
reductions," as Arthur and Foiger rec
ommend, before cutting down internal
taxation. Messrs. Randall and Carlisle
the leading Democratic candidates for
the Speakership, both supported the re
pealing bill.
If .this vote'in Committee is indica
tive of the sentiment in Congress, the
Republican majority twi 11 not reduce
taxation much thfs session. The trouble
Is they would thus, dismiss a couple of
thousands of useless officials, and that
they don't want, nor do the officeholders
want it. President Arthur says if all
the internal. taxes but that on whisky
are cutoff, two and a half millions can
be saved on the expenses of the revenue
bureau, and 1,500 or 2,000 useless offl
cials be retired from office. Gen. Garfield
some years ago, in discussing the reduc
tion of public expenditures, said it con id
only be done effectively by a party in
opposition to that having possession of
the executive departments of the Gov
ernment. All this, therefore, will
probably be left for the Democratic pru
ning knife, as intimated by Genera
Garfield.
