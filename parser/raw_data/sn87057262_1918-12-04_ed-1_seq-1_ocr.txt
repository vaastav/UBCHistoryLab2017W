President Wilson, heading the
"American commission to, negotiate

As the ship proceeded toward the
pay, the president remained on the
bridge, waving his hat and handker

Uproar of farewell. The noise of
histles and sirens became deafen

The effect of the general under
nourishment Is clearly seen in the
villages. I did not see a corpulent
person, and most of the people ap-
peared sallow. The streets of the
villages are filled with children be
tween the ages of two and four
years, born during the war. Nearly
all have an unhealthy appearance.
The most noticeable feature of the
appearance of the people is their
apathy and lack of interest, which
is prcVbably due to discouragement
and lack of nourishment. The Ameri
can soldiers have shown no lack of
"pep" and "ginger" in their move
ments about the villages, in striking
contrast to the action of the towns
folk. In Treves and Saarburg the
streets are almost wholly without
traffic.
In two days there I saw only two
automobiles. One was owned by the
burgomaster. The other had Iron
tires and was driven by a
officer. There are few horse-drawn
vehicles, most of the cartage being
done by hand-drawn carts.
Nearly all the children I saw wore

The windows of some of the cloth

four suits of shoddy material, the
prices of which are equivalent to
from fifty to seventy dollars. As a
rule, the people are very poorly clad,

signs of privation, the rich men go

lars and wearing fine shoes.
