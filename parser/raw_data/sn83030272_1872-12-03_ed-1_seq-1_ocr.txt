Aldermen's resolutions were pretetited OJT Grn.
Juhn Cochrane and Alexander Wilder. The
resolutions Vete then read, and, pending their
adoption, Mr, Plncktiey addressed the board as
follows:
1 hive lesrned whatever I know abont humanity from
Horace (treelry, lie ass s trleud of the downtrodden
sad oppressed. He loved the people who were sgalntt
him, lie fully exemplified the Saviour's teachlog tu "love
your enemtre." During the laat few months e have
psssrd through an exciting political campaign, culml'
natiug In the reflection of Gen. Grant. While I labored
earnestly ror the defeat or Horace (Ireeley, because 1
belleveif him belter off aa a louroalltl, I nrtcrtheleet
feel Ihe losa of tbe great ana good msn. He left the
world In a betler condition than a hen he came to II. He
has tsncbt men not to fight each other, but to love esch
other When dimculllea aroae be did not advocate force
of srmt. but love, pesce, snd fraternity. We have met
here aevcral times during the past year to offer condo
Isnce for eminent ststeamen and phllosopherai but this
aflecta us more deeply than all others. Ills death re
uilndausthal our turn will aoon come. We must all
rsaa through that dark portal whence no wanderer re
nrna. Let ui eo love that w ben we come to dls we will
hsre our end lu pesce.
Mr. Conner then addressed the body:
As one who Is sbnut setting out on s polltlcsl esrter.
ss one ot the youngest members of this body, tt csnnot
be eipected of me to einrese words adequate to the oc
casion. The death otthli dlatlngnlahed man leavea s
greet void In our Commonweslth, in our country, In the
world. We hsve not yet recovered from the suiprlss
vhlch the sunooncemel ot bis destb csuaed. His career
baa mtny worthy leaaona lor our yonng men, Werecsll
the tlmewbeu Horace Qreeley came to tbla city
without a friend snd with but a few dollars. Dm he
wsi determined to make a name snd reptitsllon. How
sdinlrsbly he succeeded we sll know. He hu elf rated
the human race to a blxber plane by bis grest snd
grand Ideaa. One of fala loftiest Idess was to see tbe
Constitution carried out to tbe very letter, tbst sll men
ars born free snd ecus). He fought with pen snd
tongue for these principles, snd lived to see them In
corporated In onr Constitution, The millions or tbe
downtrodden will ever bear la remembrsnce whst hs
has done for tbem. Tbe Ideas which neaea disseminated
bsve often been opposed, but they finally carried the
world, bo with many or the principles wi.lch hsve not
yet been accepted, tbey will soon be heralded sa the
f lad tidings, and nations will rise and call Mm bleitod.
We regret that he sccepted the nomination for the
Presidency. 1 vlolentlv opposed him ss a polltlcsl

President Otis T. Hall next addressed the as
semblage. He said:
I csnnot let the present opportunity pais without of.
ferlcgmy humble tribute lo that great man, Horace
(Ireeley X cannot add to whst haa been ao ably aald,
but 1 esteem the deceased as a worthy and noble man.

The resolutions were then unanimously adopt

Major's communication and the telcgrr.phlc
despatch from Secretary ltoheson weie then
read, ai.d tbe board adjourned,
Tbe Tribune Draped la .Mourning,
The ofSce of the Trtlnmt yesterday waa
sombre and mournful. In addition to tbo Sag
which waved above the building at half mast,
the lower portion of the aide facing the Court
House was draped In heavy crape, whose long
folds nearly reached the ground. The doors of
the publication office were closed, but through
the windows almllar symbols of mournlugnere
visible. The two windows over the front door,
opening Into tbe room where the founder of the
Tribune passed perhaps the busiest and
most useful portion of his life, were closed and
tbe blinds drawn down. At the top and down
the sides hung deep folds of crape which
drooped somo distance below the bottom of the
windows.
Throughout the day a multitude more or less
dense was collected in front of the offlco: some
eagerly devoured the contents of Ihe IrQiunr
posted on tho bulletin board ; others endeavored
to look Into the publication office, and a great
number, standing out in the street, gazed sadly at
the two windows drawd lu mourning. News
buys, taking advantage of the occasion, were
endeavoring tn sell colored pictures of the de
parted Journalist, but a single glance at the
atrocloua caricatures presented was sufficient
to deter any purchaser.
Un all hands the deepest regret was expressed
at the melancholy event which bad deprived
the nation of one of Its greatest citizens, and
thrown the city Into mourning. Those who had
never spoken of the dead patriot except to revile
him. now remembered only his many virtues,
and glancing up at those two darkened windows
with their sombre surroundings, forgot all po
litical differences, and warn ly Joined in the
euloglums which were showered upon the
memory of Horace Greeley.
THE THIIlU.NB'a COMPOArTOHS.
A meeting of the past and present employees
of the Xt tc l'orfc Iriounr, Including members of
the composing room, press room, and mailing
department, waa held In the composing room
yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, to take action
on the death of Horace Greeley. Mr. Washing
ton A. Dodge was chosen to preside, and Mr. A.
Vanderwerker was appointed Secretary. Mr. W.
W. Pasko offered the following, which were
adopted unanimously:

Another Unpublished Letter from Mr, Gree

Ill a letter to tho Hon. Musoti W. Tniipriu.
dated Nov. 8, one of the very last that Mr. Gree
ley wrote, he expresses great gratitude to Mr.
Tappan forgoing Into tbe recent contest In hts
behalf with such zeal ; and ssjs In bis gravely
Jocular mannor:
" I havo been so bitterly assailed that I hardly
know whether I waa running for the Presidency
or for the Penitentiary."
Mr. Greeley thus speaks of the death of his
wife:
"In the darkest hour my long-suffering wife
left : not too soon as ahu had suffered too deeply
and lung. I laid her In the grave with hard, dry
eyes. Well, 1 am used up. I have slept little
for weeks, and my eyea are hard to close, while
they soon open again."
Certain allusions made In the letter, as stated
to us by Mr. Tappan, we are not at liberty at
present to specify ; but hope that he will And It
consistent with propriety ultimately to publish
the whole letter, the content of which are
specially Interesting on account of their convey

A reporter visited Greenwood Cemetery
yesterday morning to ascertain the particulars
J,u,,tt,.'e "hereabouts and condition of the spot
which Is destined lo be the final resting place of
the lamented Journalist, Horace Greeley,
" founder of the Sew Vork Tribune."
The family lot of Horace Greeley Is No. JHt,
and situated on Locust Hill. It rests on the
crown of the hill, and Is one of the most com
mamllng sites In the cemetery. There Is no
stone or monument erected to mark the spot,
nothing hut a few stakes driven In tbe earth to
indicate Its boundaries. An underground vault
ha been built, and the earth haa to be removed
from the slabs to effect an entrance. Within the
'of'al of the tomb now repose his wife and
children.

devoid ot Interest. There was arespoctable show
of lookers on ln the galleries, and th Third

the lobbies snd coat rooms. The attendance of
members and Benntors was not as large a was
expected. Mr. Sumner created a little excite
ment In the Senate by offering a resolution to
strike from the army registry and regimental
colors all references to the battles of the late

grca Senator made a brief and pointed speech,

and tho resolution of condolence and respect
offered by .sir, Dawes an well m tho. fitting re

drluy. The reading of the President's message
sttrncted but little attention, and, indeed, the

THII1UTE TO HOllACE QnEELEY,
Mr. Dawes (Rep., Mass.) rose and said ; Mr.

of this Government that has recently transpired,
I deem It proper to offer tbe following resolu

ttvea, In view or Ihe recent death ot Horace (ireeley,
ror whom at Ibe 1st election more thsn three million
votes were csit for President, that a record be made
en the Journals ot Congress or sppreclstlon for the
eminent services snd peraonal purity snd worth ot the
decessed, snd of lbs ssd Impression created by his

Mr. Cox (Dem,, N. Y.) rose and said : Mr.
Spenker, I desire to sdd a word tn the resolu
tion of condolence and sympathy offered by my
friend from Massachusetts, 1 havo tbo honor to
reside In the city of New York, once represented
by Mr. Greeley In the American Congress. This
House haa heard with profound aoirowof tho
tragical death of one of Ita most Illustrious citi
zens, Horace Greeley. HI demise creates a
void Impossible to Oil In American Journalism,
society and life. Ills remarkable services wero
Illustrated by practical charities, enlarged be
nevolunce, earnest thought, and Independent
expression. In the various qualities of mind
and character he la an example of and Incentive
to that sturdy self-rclinnco and unresting enter

Iherefore It Isemlnontlyjust, generous and wlso

Mr. Jlrooks (Dem.. N. Y.) said ho hoped that

be no partisan aolltlca. but in which (he nhple
country should be represented as a unit, It was

Mn. ni.AiMB asks ron Art ntYCSTioATioic,
Mr. lllalne, having 'ailed Mr. Cox to the chair
as Speaker jrro (cm., took tho floor and said t
Mn.SPi:tKEn: I rise to a question of tho high
est privilege ono that eoneorns the Integrltr of
members of this House, and the honor of the
House Itself. During tho late Presidential cam
paign there was a wide-spread Accusation to tho
effect that members of Congress had been
bribed by presents of stock in tho Credit Mo
hlller to perform certain legislative acts for tho
benefit of the I'nlon 1'aclflr! Railroad Company.
Tho persons thus charged with crime are, or
hnd been. In high public station. Ono of them
Is tho Vtce-Piosldent of tho United States;
another the Vlco-Prosldent elect: still another
tho Secretary nf the Treasury. Three Senators
of the Prilled States nro Included Messrs. Uay
nrd, Kowler, and Patterson. In this House the
accusation touches a former honored member
from Massachusetts, now In his grave- Mr.
Thomas A. Kllot: tt Includes tho Chairman of
ays nnd Means. Mr. Dawes ; tho Chairman or
Auurojirlatlons, Mr. Garfield; tho Chairman of
the Connrliltco on Civil Service Heron,!, Mr.
Kclloy; the ChatnraH of tho House Naval Com
mlttoe, Mr. Scnficld; I'm Chairman of the Ju
diciary, Mr, Rlngham ; nn enilnent member of
the Committee of Ways and Means, Mr. Itrooks;
and an ex. member from tho State of Pennsyl
nls, Mr. Ittiycr; snd It Includes tho Speaker of
the House, who now occupies the floor. All nf
these gentlemen are nlleged tn have received
present of stock In the Credit Mobllor from the
hands Vf Oakea Amos, a representative from
Massachusetts presents of stock wbi.cn were In
tlin asture of bribe. This grave accusation In
cludes men of both political parties, and men
holding, n.s I nave already said, eminent publlo
stations.
THE CHAltGE or imniKitr
of members Is one of the gravest that any legis
lative body Is ever called upon to consider, and
one that demands prompt, thorough, and impar
tial Investigation. I have taken tbe floor, there
fore, for the purpose of moving that a seleot
committee be appointed tn Investigate theso
chargea nnd tn ascertain whether they be true
or false. I'nwllllng.uf course, to appoint a com
mittee to Investigate a chargo In which my own
name Is Included, I have called you to the chair
to perform that duty, I have seloctvd you be
cause you are a political opponent hold In high
honor nnth In the House and In tho country;
and when on Saturday last I advised you that I
should ask this sen Ico from you, I placed upon
you but ono restriction In tho seloctlnn of tho
committee, and that via that It should not con
tain n majority of my iKilltlcal friends, and this
request Is cordially concurred In by all tho mem
bers of this House who are accused with whom
I hate been able to confer. Without further
detaining the House, I submit tho following
resolution, and, unless some gentleman desires
to sieak, 1 will call the previous question ;
H'Arreni. Aeeuistlons hsie been msdelnthe public

DOESN'T WANT AX INVTSTIOATIOIt.
Mr. Archer (I)em Md.) hoped that the resolu
tion would not be adopted. The question had
been already tried bv a higher tribunal than the
House. The American people had passed upon
It. He thought It much better for the House to
go on with the regular business nf tho country.
Mr. Randall (Detn,, P.i.) hoped that the resolu
tion would be adopted with unanimity, and be
trusted that lu the language ot tho Speaker, the
Investigation would be full, thorough, and
searching. Iss than that should not meet tho
expectations and requirements of the American
people. There had been a dark cloud of scandal
raised over the House, nnd It was due to those
members who had never been Involved In such
proceedings that their character should be
raised above suspicion. It wa also right that
public condemnation should fall on the heads of
those. If there were any such, who were Impli
cated In voting for hills In which they wero di
rectly or Indirectly Interested.
Mr. Dawes (Rep.. Mass.) agreed with Mr. Ran
dall, and honed that the resolution w mid be
adopted without a dissenting voice Without
expressing any opinion as to the result of such
sn Investlgstlon, It was due to the House, as well
ue to the members Implicated, that there should
be no shrinking at this time from a thorough,
exhausting, fair, and Impartial Investlgstlon.
ln times past he had borne his full share of urg
ing on the House the propriety of taking cogni
zance of charges of this kind, when made by
responsible authority. He did not Intend now
tn shrink from any such Investigation, and he
trusted thst the House generally would feel In
the same way, and that tho Investigation would
be pursued In such a manner that the result
would command, a he had no doubt It would
receive, the approval of the American people,
Mr- Holman (Dem., Ind.l expressed the hope
that the resolution would be adopted unani
mously. THE INVISTirUTINO COMMITTEE.
The resolution was adopted with a few nega
tive votes on the Democratic side, and Mr. Cox.
as Speaker iru fern., appointed a tho select
committee Messrs. Poland, Hanks, Reck, Nib-U"-l.
and Mcfrary.
Mr. Sargent oiep., Cal.), from the Committee
ot nays and Means, reported l'ie Indian Appro

tor Tuesday, thu 10th Inst. He stated that the

being $Uc2,6VI less tban iu the same bill of last

Tho Speaker presented the resignation nf Mr.
Mercur of Pennsylvania, who has been elected
Judge of the Supreme Court of that State.

When Meyers reached the place nil the barley,

and ah' old him she did not know that her hus
band had sold the farm, and further that a roan
called a few days ago with a bill of sale for the

to hsve the deed annulled on an action of fraud,
but dreading a lawsuit he contented 'himself
with taking possession of what was left of his
property.

Mr. Sharp, who was not sharp In this transac

Four months after ho had taken possession of
his new premises tho two last mortgagees ap
peared. Home time previous to the exchange
action waa pending for foreclosure. The Court
had ordered the foreclosure. When Sharp dis
covered how he had been duped, he brought an
action In tho Supreme Court of Ilrooklyn on
Mny 25, against Dorothea Router, and notice
was tiled, No, 8a7, to set asldo nnd void a deod
made by Sham and his wife to Dorothea Ren
ter, dated April in, 1ST3. and compel reconvey
ance, a It had been obtained by fraud.
CLt.lVAN COCKTY LET IN.
In Cochccton Mrs. Rosalia Troppke and her
husband kept a hotel where the justice's court
and political meeting were held. Mrs. Treppko
owned the building with the surrounding land,
nnd the personal chattels, In all worth about
Is.tiU. Sho wanted to move with her family,
and was willing to exchango her real
estate for some nearer to New York.
Sometime In June Mr. Treppko arrived in this
cltrtoseoa frtond who keeps a restaurant In
William street, and to consult about tho advisa
bility of the change, and If possible, a he was
well acquainted here, to havo him act as his
agent when he found some property suitable for
hi purpose, Mr. Treppko had great confidence
In thla man. The friend told Reuter about Mr.
Treppko.
A meeting wa brought about botween Renter
and Treppke, at which the former proposed to
exchange a liquor store In North William street,
with other considerations, lor the Treppke prop
erty In Sullivan county. Trenpke would not
consent tn that, so It was agreed to meet again.
Last month Reuter wont to Cochecton, to con
sult Treppke about exchanging for property In
Suffolk county. He represented to Treppke that
he was the owner In fee simple of a farm In that
county, and that It wa free and unincumbered,
except a mortgage for $-100, and was worth about
$5,000. He via willing to exchange the property,
and assume all mortgages on tho Treppke proper
ty. He said that he had searched the title to his
farm, and found It free and clear. He concealed
from Treppke the fact that an action had been
pending for some months In the Supreme Court
to set aside this very conveyance from Sharp to
Router's wife, a hating been obt.tlnod through
fraud, and that he had received a notice of action
In May last, which had been filed, and that a
large Hen was on the aforesaid property. He
offered $2,500 for tho farm, and wa Hilling to
assume all the mortgages. Ho assured Treppke
that It wa all right, nntl ho could save him all
expenses for searching tbe title, a ho had a
complete abstract at home. Treppke' friend
though t It wa a good bargain. Treppke. having
Implicit confidence In his friend, concluded that
it was a reasonable nnd satisfactory offer, so tho
bargain was closed at Musch's saloon.
THE DISCOVkHY Or THU FIISLD.
H- titer drew the papers, and was assisted by a
certain lnwyer. Treppke wanted to see tho ab
stract, but he was pacified by thtf subterfuges of
Renter and his lawyer, who promised that he
would have It tho next day. Deeds were exe
cuted and exchanged. Tieppke came tn New
ork with his household goods last month. Ho
fore moving tn Isllp, he sent his son Charles a
day ahead of him to take possession of the
farm. The following day, Treppke with his fam
ily followed his son, and met film at Hrentwood,
crylng.J Ho asked blm why he was weeping.
The son said that he had been cheated. Ho told
his father that the neighbors had told him that
Router never owned the farm, and that he w.-u a
rascal and a swindler.
Treppke did not believe that It was possible.
Father and eon went to Isllp, and learned
that It wa too true. They returned to this
city almost heart-broken. Reuter took posses
sion of the late Treppke property. Treppke sent
his family to the Isllp farm to stay until th case
In the Supreme Court Is adjudicated.
HEUTElt AKD HIS ritlklin.
Reuter found a friend In Andrew Muscli, a
saloon keeper at 310 Sixth avenue. Mii-cli loaned
Renter $30i) before the latter had obtained the
fraudulent title. Reuterthen mortgaged theStil
llvsti county property to Musch for $4,000, dated
Oct. 21, under the false pretence of securing
a debt ot $4,000, This fraudulent mortgage was
recorded In the Sullivan County Clerk'a oltli e in
liber of mortgages 39, and upon this fraudulent
mortgage Musch Is tr lug to foreclose.
Treppke consulted Messrs, Kiimnan it Yea
man, attorneys, at 'Mi llroartway. Mr. Kurzinnn
took tbe first train for Muiitlcello, tbo county
sest of Sullivan, and found Reuter' mort
gage to Musch already recorded, and, as
on of the counsel for ptnlntlff, made
affidavit before Friend W. Johnson, the
County Clerk, concerning tho fraud ulont
possession by Renter of tho Troppke property.
Mr. Kumnan also obtained a description of the
premises, and took every legal precautionary
measure, so there should be no failure. When
he had returned to New York he took Mrs.
Treppke's affidavit, and with other legal docu
ments sent Mr, Henry Morgenthau, his chief
clerk, to Albany to get an Injunction against
Reutor and Musch. On Saturday Mr. Morgen
thau went before Judgo Lamed and obtained
tho Injunction. The defendant was ordered to
sppear on tho 2th of this month to show cause
why It should not bo msdo permanent.
W hen Musch was served with the Injunction
5? bfim.e alarmed, and aald that If he only got
his $300 back he would be satisfied. Hu feared
that he had got himself Into trouble.
Sharp obtained Judgment last TuesJay against
Reuter. Patrick P. Smyth, a laborer, uf the
Fourth Ward, said to he almost penniless, gave
a conveyance ot tho Isllp property to Treppke.
SMITH'S BTOnY Or TUB SWINDLE.
Smyth made an affidavit that ho had been era
Ployed bv Renter as a farm hand alnco Juno,
tin tho 15th of Juno Reuter conveyed to him
tho farm In Suffolk county, tor which ho paid
nothing. On Oct. 18 Renter requested him
to execute a conveyance of this farm to Rosalia
1 reppke, which he did. This was In considera
tlon of an exchange. When ho made out tho
conveyance It was lu blank aa lo the grnntee'g
name. He requested Smyth to allow him (Heu
ter) to nil It up with Smyth' namo, and it tho
same time prepared a deed from' Smyth to
,JXL. ecllned to enter Into ouch an arrange
VBnl', f,h.ereupon Reuter himself tilled the
this deed with his name, and then took
possession of the farm. Reuter promised Smyth
Jui!r?.r '.,U """"le, but he has not a etful
i.L.i V,,"t.,'rVml0' Smyth also swears that ho
heard Renter boast that hu would "get Treppke
well stuck In that farm." He also depose flint

repeated Interviews with Router about this Job.

WAfliiixaTo.v, Deo. 2. The most Impor
tant and really the only exciting part of tho pro- Si
ceedlngs In tho House to-day was the resoluUo 'i
offered by Speakor lllalne to Investigate th
Credit Moblller chargoj of bribery preferred,
against himself and other prominent member. I
Thero Is good reason to bellove that Mr.
lllalne acted in this Instance without con
sultation with some of tho gentlemea
whoso tisrocs ore connected with his own
In this scandal, for on yostcrday Mr,
Dawes stated that there was nothing In lh
charges worthy tho nttcntlon of the Houis.
Thero Is also equal good reason for statltiff that
Mr. Cox, who was constiltod by Mr. Jtlalne four
days slnoo, did not confer with his BoniocratU
brethren In regard to who should be selected
from that aide of the House to form a part of
tho commlttoe. There mar havo been no collu- J
slon botween the Speakor nnd tho witty gontls-
msn from Now York, but thero Is no doubl
about the dissatisfaction which his course In th
nibttcr has crcatod among Uto Democrats.
Tho committee Is regarded as bolng very favor
ably composed for whitewashing purpoo. Mr. ri
Poland of Vermont'lrs nHhiby-patOby sort of a J
man, and Mr. McCreary nf Inwa Is directly In
terested In more than ono railroad Job. Mossrs. t
Ranks, Nlblack, snd Reck are good men, but th
two lattor are already overworked tho latter
on tho Ways and Means, and the former on th
Appropriation Committee- whllo Hanks will
bo fully occupied as Chairman of th
Commltteo on Foreign Affairs with th '
legislation growing out of the Washington
treaty. Mr. Reck stated very positively this
afternoon that he would decline to serve, and '
Mr. Nlblack Indicated the same Intention. The
motion of Hen Hutler tn extend the scope of In
quiry beyond the Credit Moblller transactions '
of Oakes Ames to any other persons or corpora- i
Hons caused a llttlo sensation. It Is stated on laO
good authority that llenjainln Is gunning for Iffa"
more than ono Individual, and that llu little un
easiness ha been created by this unexpected ;
movement on bis part.
Tho foolish remark made by Archer of Mary
land, about this question of bribery having Peon
settled by a higher tribunal than Congress, was
promptly rebuked by Messrs. Randall and Hol
man, who plainly Intimated that the gentleman
from Maryland did nut speak the sentiments of
their sldo of the House. Archer, Il will be re
membered, was one of the special committee to
Investigate the charges against Secretary Robe
son last session, and sold nut to tho Ad-
ministration, after having assured Gov
ernor Rlalr, the Chairman, that he agreed
In every particular with his report. It
Is said that Archer owes his election to th
Forty-third Congress to Republican votea.whlch V
wore secured for lilni by Itnboson'a Influence. 1
However this may be. the Democrats are Justly I
Incensed at his foolish conduct, and aay tt oaa I 1
only be accounted for on two hypothesoa! , 1
thoughtlessness, or a premeditated intention to 1
desert hi colom. I should not be surprised If '
the last Is the true solution, and have no doubt '
that, before tho close ot tbe present session.
Archer will be found supporting all of the
many schomeH Robeson and the Navy Ring are
known to have on the carpet.
Tbe Credit Moblller Corruptloa,
Vovn the Albany Argue.
Dtitinc the Rent nnd turmoil ot the Pres
idential election, the scandalous development
brought to light by the litigation between th '
Hon. Oakos Ames and Col. It. S. McComb failed
to receive due attention, many person probably
regarding them as little mure than a campaign
Invention. Rut the evidence Is conclusive that
Ames did either bribo tho Congressmen Im
plicated or that he slandored them In bis letters
to McComb, and In either case his conduot
merits punishment. The Springfield lleyulAican
ha shown a strong disposition to defend Mr.
Dawes and some of the other Implicated Con
gressmen, but now maintains that investigation
Is necessary. It tells us that It Is given out on
pretty high authority, and pretty generally be
lieved, that, when Congress comes together, .r
one of the first things done will be to order aa '
Investigation Into the Credit Moblller mystery. '
The motion. It Is said, will come from the He- '
publican side of the House probably from some
of the distinguished gentlemen whose names '
figure In Mr. Oakes Ames' list. If this Inquiry
Is Intended to be a sham-n new edition uf the 't
whitewashing hocus-pocus with which tho af'
fairs of the New York ''Uetom Home, French. ,
arms, r.u -dr. Robeson's llttlo tram-action with I
the Secnre have made the public so familiar, our
ndvlce to honorable members would bo to let It
alune. If, on the other hnnd, it Is sincerely ,
wished to get at the truth, the country may pre- '
pare Itself for some surprising nnd not very
ngreenble additions to Its stock of knowlodge ;
nnd Mr. Oakes Ames may prepare himself for a
resolution uf expulsion. An honest commltteo
and an honest Homo can have but one language
for this gentleman" get out I"

Washington-, Dec. 2. Tliu uull for tho
Senate Republican caucus was Issued to-night
to Stmators only who havo continually support
ed thu Administration and tho party, a well a
all Its nominations. Messrs. Sumner, Trumbull,
Fenton, Schurx, Tipton, Rice, and West were
not favored with a copy of this suggestive call,
and are of course not expected to put In an ap
pearance. The Administration worshippers ar ,
consequently lu raptures and are gloating over 1
the supposed chagrin of the neglected Liberal !T
Senators. I have, hon ever, tho highest author
ity for saying that neither of the Liberal Bona. '
tors ever contemplated attending the caucus.
They long since manifested their contempt ot 1
this piece of party machinery, and will feel cot i
the slightest concern at this studied attempt to
make tho public believe they are read out of th f
party they many mouths since formally and
publicly renounced.
The Chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee
wil lie given to lMuiunds, i-lcr Tiumbull, vtho
will lie reinnved. Senator Ccnkllng Is very r5
much dUgusttd nt this, a.i he felt certain that
his eminent services would bo recognized by th .
bestowal of this honor on himself, Wlndoin I
to succeed Fenton as Chairman of the Commit
tee on Contingent Kxiienses, while Pr.itt will
succeed Kdmunds as Chairman of the ('umnill
tec on Pensions. Tipton, who Is second In this
committee will be turned off. Schurx also will
be left off the Cmuiulttco on Foreign Relations.
Iiogan, It In said, will be made temporary Chair- I
man of Mines and Mining, i
Hie Administration men are Indignant at what
they term tbo trick ot Mr. Ranks In offering his
resignation a a member ot the House Commlt
teo on Foreign Relations during tho morning
hour. They say their men were not expecting It
so early, and, taken bv surprise, had no time to
concert any action. They say that It It was tgu
be done over again, Mr. Ranks would not gV
mora than three Administration votes. There
Is no diitibt that war to tbe knife Is meant by
tho Administration party, and I would not bo
surprised If Hanks I ultimately forced off th
