Interesting Details for Policy Holders
in Struggle of Big Financiers to
Control Company's Millions.
New York, Dec. 12. Thomas F.
Ryan today appeared before the In
surance investigating committee and
told what E. H. Haniman did and
threatened to do when he demanded
that Mr. Ryan concede him a share
In the control of the Equitable Life
Assurance society last June. Mr. Ryan
assured the committee that he had
meant no disrespect by his former re
fusal to disclose their conversations,
and said that he had determined to
answer the questions to which he had
refused replies on Friday laHt because
District Attorney Jerome said he ought
to do so.
Mr. Ryan's version of what Mr.
Harriman demanded and what he
threatened to do upon the refusal of
his demands was in substance as fol
lows: That Harriman demanded one-half
of the 503 shares of the stock of the
Equitable Life Assurance society
which Mr. Ilyan had pui-chnned from
James II. Hyde and which Rave Mr.
Ryan control of the property.
That Harriman threatened, unless
he was conceded this shurc In the con
trol of the society, to exert his politi
cal and all other Influences a sal list
Mr. Ilyan and his project.
That Harriman declared there prob
ably would be legislative action and
that in that event his Influence would
be Important.
That Harriman demanded the right
to name two of the five tnmtees to
vote the controlling stock In the elec
tion of directors of the society. ......
In reply to repeated questions by
Charles E. Hughes, counsel of the
committee, Mr. Ryan stated that Mr.
, Harriman did not threaten that there
should be legislative notion unless, he
was given a share in the Equitable
control, but said there probably would
be such action. Neither did. Mr. Harri
man threaten any action by an officer
of the government.
It was a strenuous Interview. Mr.
Ryan said, uml was held In the pres
ence of Ellhu Root, "then Mr. Ryan'f
counsel, now secretary of state, and
Paul D. Cravath, also Mr, Ryan's
counsel.
Mr. Ryan told the committee that
he drew the Inference from, it that
Ms. Harriman did not want anybody
to control the Equitable society un
less he had a share In it. Mr. Ryan
also stated that he paid no attention
to Mr. Harrlman's statement that his
Influence would be Important In the
event of legislative action and in
formed him tint he wanted no part
ners in the enterprise. Mr. Harriman
did not- get the coveted shares in the
stock.
Mr. Ryan declared that this Inter
view took Dlace within a few days
after he got control of the Hyde
stock.

filiform Naturalization.
Washington. Dec. 12. President
Roosevelt has transmitted to the
house the report of the commission
on naturalization appointed March 1.
1906, by executive order. The report
comprises a volume of considerable
size containing court records and the
draft of a hill for uniform naturaliza
tion methods.
The features of the commission's
bill, ns outlined in the president's
menage, contemplates dispensing; with
the applicants' preliminary deolaratlon
Of Intention to become citizens and
confine the jurisdiction to confer nat
uralization to the federal courts and,
' 'e'talr sph. to those state courts
having civil jurisdiction. The com
mission recommends that a bureau be
established In the department of com
merce and labor, the idea of this pro
vision being- that the government
should ha control and supervision of
naturalization in one of Its executive
branches Just as Is done with matters
of navigation and Immigration. The
f ill also provides that no certificate of
naturalization shall be granted after
the expiration of ninety days from the
time of the filing of the petition.

Japan Used Sword Point on
Korean Emperor.
RULER OF HERMIT KINGDOM
APPEALS TQ ROOSEVELT
Declares Japan Made Him a Prisoner
and Signed Famous Agreement
in His Behalf.
Washington, Dec. 12. Homer B.
Hulbert, the special messenger vf rom the
emperor of Korea is in receipt of a ca
blegram from Korea in which the em
peror declares that the agreement be
tween Korea and Japan is null and
void because it was obtained by force.
He also declares that he will never
sign this agreement in its present form
and that the disturbances which at
tended the "outrage" of November 1"
are likely to occur again.
Concerning the cablegram from the
emperor of Korea, Mr. Hulburt said:
"This Is the first genuine word that
has been received from Korea giving
the real attitude of that government
toward- the treacherous act of the Jap
anese. For several week the emper
or was practically In confinement and
the Japanese gave out the false state
ment that an amicable adjustment
had been made. This Is now proven to
be untrue. The agreement was made
under duress and at the point of the
sword, but the emperor has at last
succeeded in piercing the cordon of
Japan and getting information Into
the outer world. As long as my mis
sion to America is no longer a secret
I may add that the emperor, anticipat
ing some such act of bad faith on the
part of Japan, tried through me, to
forestall it by lodging an appeal with
President Roosevelt. The object of my
coming was surmised and the coup in
Seoul was hastened, so that it occurred
on the very day of my arrival in
Washington. The emperor felt certain
that If President Roosevelt could be
made aware of his sentiments, the
American government would hesitate
und ask a few questions before accept
ing Japan's statements alone. The au
thorities In Washington were almost
Immediately notified that this petition
were here, but no arrangements were
made for Its reception until after Ja
pan's statement was accepted and act
ed upon. The object of this cable
gram is to disavow any acquiescence
in the so-called agreement and Inci
dentally to call attention to that clause
of the treaty between America and
Korea in which the United Statps " a.
nltely promises to use its good offices
In case Korea Is oppressed or wronged.
The United States was In full treaty
relations with Korea up to the time
when upon the representations of Jap
an alone and apparently without con
sulting Korea, this government took
the lead In cutting off direct diplo
matic relations with Korea.

tricts giving Frothingham a plurality
because of factional differences.

FEAR THEY ARE NOT YET
' READY TO FIGHT THE CZAR
St. Petersburg, Dec. 12. Caution
having prevailed over the fury arous
ed by the arrest of the strike leaders,
the workmen's council has rejected
the proposition to order a general
strike at present as untimely. The
council realized the weakness and un
preparedness of the workmen for a
general conflict and had been Inform
ed that the railroad men hud already
decided against the strike. .The senti
meift of the workmen's delegates
which was extremely depressed, has
been somewhat raised by the receipt
of a dispatch from Moscow claiming
that revolutionary propaganda ha.s
finally taken hold among the Cos
sacks, the last hope of the reaction.
The third squadron of the First regi
ment of Cossacks Is reported to have
held a meeting and to have drawn up
service demands claiming that the
men are fed like dogs and shabbily
clothed. This is the first sign of dis
affection among the Cossacks. Many
of the striking operators have lost
heart owing to the news from Moscow
that the leaders, when arrested, were
Indulging In expensive supper at
popular Moscow restaurants In com
pany with women strikers and spend

expensive cigars and liquors.
The Party Lines in Kusslit.
While It Is impossible In the
present confusion to clearly out
line the various political forces
which are struggling for the
mastery In Itussia, the foreign student
of Kusslan affairs can with profit bear
In mind the general party divisions as
at present constituted. Perhaps the
first In nil in the órder of Importance
Is the party of reaction among the
nobles who believe In the old regime
and among the great mass of peosant
ry who still believe that all good flows
from the "Little Father," and the
church which continues to "Intelllgen
cla." "black masses," the term by
which Ignorant peasantry who com
pline 80 per cent of the Russian peo
ple, can at any time turn the scale. In
skilful hands they, therefore, will al
ways constitute an immense force In
favor of a counter revolution. There
aro two parties under which the peas
antry might eventually be enlisted and
which nriy be said to make up the ex
treme right, consisting of those who
will never forgive the emperor for
the abrogation of autocratic power
They talk of disposing of Nicholas
and electing a new emperor. Prlnct:
Dolgourkl of Moscow, one of the de
scendants of the luniks Is their
avowed candidate. The church party
under the name of the "Holy alliance
for national self-protection." ha
been organized and these parties
might eventually unite for military
dictatorship against the revolutionary
forces. Immedkitely to the left of
thl pnr'y of reaction might be placed
the moderate conservatives who sup
port Wltte In the Introduction of the
new regime. Their filatform call for
the realization of the reform prom
ised, for the Integrity of the empire
and for a strong central government.
More radical still Is the group ef par
ties between the supporter of WltU
and tha social democrat. It f (re
most demand Is for a constitutional
ssembly elected by universal, direct
and ecret ballot. Huh. Novostl and

of the commission, Including the pur
chasing agent and assistant purchas
ing agent, were before the commit
tee and were subjected to pointed In
cluirles as to the manner of making
expenditures.
Mr. Taft and Mr. Shonts urged that
the appropriation be increased to
Jlfi.MHi.ooo. the amount named In the
bill, before It was amended in the
house. They admitted, however, that
$11.000,000 would be sufficient to err
ry on the work until April. In vien l
the fact that congress will have pleni;,
of opportunity to legislate by that
time It was determined not to restore
the. $r..rnn.0(0 cut out by the house. .
''I'M'-h Agent's" ut les.
The examination of Bishop, who
had I en referred to In the house de
bates as a "press agent" for the com
mission, was of a personal nature, In
that he was asked to define hi duties.
It was fhowii that In addition to act
ing as secretary he is a sort of dip
lomatic agent charged with meeting
any possible contingency that may
arise. In I lie absence of Mr. Shont
and W. Leon Peppermnn, the assistant
chief of administration, Mr. Bishop
says he assumes their duties in Wash
ington, even to the extent of signing
checks, nnd that he deals directly
with the fecretary of war in relation
to canal matters. He said he was the
historian for the commission and as
sembled data of all kind that might
be of use for any purpose. He ad
mitted that to some extent this Infor
mation was used for the public press.
In his capacity of literary secretary,
Mr. ltixhop explained that he waa not
expected to create public sentiment,
but to keep It normal. In explanation
he said that there had been a deter
mined effort on the part of the oppo
sition to direct public feeling against
the canal, and that before he entered
the employ of the government his ser
vices had been sought by those Inter
ests at a more liberal compensation
than he Is now receiving. When ask
ed to name the opposition Interest,
Mr. Bishop specified the Nicaragua,
the Tchuantepee and the Darlen ca
nals and ventured the surmise that
the transcontinental railroad also
were concerned In the opposition. In
renly to question as to the activity of
the railroads he said that he had no
positive Information that they were
opposing the canal eifterplse.
ItallroiulH Need "PVcs Agent."
Mr. Shonts defended the action of
the commission In employing a liter-
rv secretary, saying that practically
every railroad or corporation of any
character found the service of such
an agent of "Inestimable vnluc." '
The appropriation committee took
up the question of the making of the
reports by officials of the canal com
mission, and that regarding the pro
visions of a bill adopted by the sen
ate committee on Inter-oceanlc canals
In the last congress, wa agreed
upon. These provision were placed
In the house hill a amendments and
enter into details as to the manner of
requiring report to be made to con
gress. If the finance committee report
promptly the Teller bill In relation to
bonds, It Is possible that In the Inter-o-t
of saving time thi may be return
ed to the hill ns a new section and
the othr amendment decided upoo
by the appropriation committee
dropped temporarily, to be dealt
with later by the Isthmian canal
corn-mission. The effect of thl would
be to place the appropriation commit
tee on record against general legis
lation and give the hond feature of
the houso bill the endorsement of the
committee, and at the same tima
avoid a new bond bill In the house.
The bill will be reported to the sen
ate early tomorrow.
