EMERGENCY ACT
State Auditor Wants to Know
Whether Constitution Covers
All Sessions
EFFECTS REFERENDUM ACT
Means Difference Between 7,000
Signatures and 30,000 to
Petitions
State Auditor Kositzky today mado
application to Attorney Oeneral La ti­
ger for an opinion as to whether
House Bill 00, passed at the special
session, and which seeks to give imme­
diate effect to all acts of this extraor­
dinary assembly accomplishes its pur­
pose, or whether Section 07 of the con
situation applies to special as well as
regular sessions.
Section 07, submitted by the Non­
partisan league and approved at tho
last regular election provides that:
"No act of ilie legislative assembly
.shall take eeffct until July tirst after
the close of the session, unless the leg­
islature by a vote of two-thirds of tho
members present and voting, in eac.i
house, shall declare it an emergency
measure, which declaration shall pe
set forth in the act PROVIDED, how­
ever, that, no act granting a franchise
or special privilege, or act creating
any vested rights or interest other
than in the state, shall be declared auj
emergency measure. An emergency
measure shall take effect and Ho in
force from and after its passage and
approval by tlio governor."
None of the administration lulls in­
troduced during the recent special
session .secured the required two-thirds
vote In the house. Toward the close
of the session the committee on delay­
ed bills in a divided report, which w."s
held to be contrary to the rules of th
house, recommended for introduction
House Bill 00, declaring all acts of this
session to be emergency measures ef­
fective within ten days. House Bill
10 also fell short of the required tw-
MFIL
the referendum campaign which ha
been launched against: House Bill 00,
and which will be extended to other
measures passed at this session. The
constitution as amended by the league
a year ngo provides that 7.000 voters
at," large may by referendum petition
suspend the operation of any measure
enacted by tho legislature, except an
emergency measure. If a referendum
petition is tiled against an emergency
measure, such measure shall be a law
until voted upon by the electors. Any
such measure shall be submitted to tin
electors at a special election, if so or­
dered by the governor, on if the refer­
endum petition filed against it shall
be signed by .')0,000 electors at larg."
such special election shall be called by
the governor and shall be held not less
than 100 nor mofe than 130 days afLer
the adjournment of the session of tlr.*
legislature.. Referendum petitions
must be tiled with the secretary of
state not more than J)0 days'after ad­
journment of the session at which the
measure to bo referred was enacted.
If it. can be established under the
constitution that Section 07, defining
emergency measures, does not apply to
all sessions, but only to regular assem­
blies of the legislature, .and tliat in
special session the leigslature may by
a bare majority vote declare all of its
acts emergencies, effective immediate­
ly than it will be necessary to obtain
l'io.000 signatures to petitions to refer
any* acts of this special session, and
these acts will remain in operation un­
til repealed by popular vote. If, on
the other hand, it is held that House
Bill GO is in conflict with the constitu­
tion. only 7,000 signatures would b?
required for referendum petitions,
whose filing would automatically sus­
pend the operation of these acts until
they can be voted upon.
As recently amended, the constitu­
tion requires a four-fifths decision of
the superme court to declare a legisla­
tive act unconstitutional. Four of the
live members of the North Dakota su­
preme court bench were elected by the
league, vu*

CONTROL SHOWN
Kansas City, Mo., Dec: 16.
—That the Nonpartisan
league negotiated with- the
I. W. W. in 1917 when the lat­
ter is alleged to have sought
control of food and fuel pro
duction in Kansas and Ok­
lahoma was contended bv the
government today in the trial
of the ?2 alleged members of
the I. W. W. in federal dis­
trict court in Kansas City,
Kan. The government intro-'
duced letters to support its
contention, which were read
to the jury. The letter indi­
cated, the government con­
tended, that the Nonpartisan
league desired to have an
understanding with the ag­
ricultural workers' branch of
the I. W. W. for hiring farm
labor. This meant, the letter
read to the jury said, that
only those who had "union
cards up to date" could work
in the grain fields.

PLANS FOR BIG
MISSOURI SPAN
ARE COMPLETED
Everything in Re.idiness For
Starting Work on Big Bridge
Early in Spring
LARGE
FUND
AVAILABLE
Plans and specifications for the
million dollar wagon bridge which is
to span the Missouri, prepared by C.
A. P. Turner of Minneapolis, wlio
was engaged for 1'h.is work by Bur­
leigh and Morton counties, with the
approval of the state highway com­
mission are now in the hands of tho
com minion, and it., was .stated' today
that' work on the big structure should
begin jWiih early spring. The contriutt
-.vill call for tho completion of the
span and all approaches within two
years.
The bridge will lie the greatest en­
gineering work undertaken in Xorth
Dakota since the .Northern Pacific
railway bridge at this point was com­
plete !. The nature of the Missouri
.iver channel, the shifting banks and'
the necessity of going down '0 feet or
more below the river bed to lind a
solid base for piers all combine to
make the task a difficult one.
Under the terms of two acts of the
special session, Cioth of which the
governor has signed and filed with the
.secretary of state. $180,Old, the first
.nstallment of state aid for the Mis­
souri and -Red river bridges, the latter
to be located at Pembina, will be
available after January 1, and there
will be two oilier annual payments
of the same amount to make up the
state's share. Federal aid in the sum
of $500,000 already is available, and
Burleigh and' Morton county will each
raise $&0,COO in three annual install­
ments of $30,000 each, probably under
Sec. 194,j of the 1913 session laws
which authorizes a levy for general
highway purposes of 1-4 to four mills,
in addition to all other levies.
The wagon bridge will be located
not less than 2,010 feet nor more than
4,1COO feet below the Northern Pacific
railway bridge. Three sites have 'been
selected by soundings as suitable. On
the
NM!andan
side the bridge will be
approached by a long concrete cause­
way, so constructed as to'withstand
the high waters of the Missouri
and Heart, which, in the spring floods
the bottoms for a distance of several
miles. The approach from the Bis­
marck side will toe much simplier. as
the bluffs extend to the river's edge.
It is the plan of the state ftighway
commission to connect the twin cities
of the Missouri with a splendid con­
crete driveway which will be flanked
by sidewalks and lighted for the en
tiro distance, connecting tho main
streets of ilie two towns and making
them inreality one long thoroughfare
with the bridge as its connecting link.
*Tho Missouri bridge here will he
the only wagon bridge scanning this
stream between Sidux Falls, S. D„ and
Great' Falls, Mont. It will close the
only gap in the, national parks high­
way (between Chicago and Seattle, and
will eliminate a ferry tax of 50 cents
per car and 10 cents per person which
is levied annually upon thousands of
tourists and local patrons of the Ked
trail. The 'bridge is expected to do
much to stimulate motor transporta­
tion and to thus become an important
factor in the development of the Slope
country with its rapidly growing dai­
rying and manufacturing interests.

LAST EDITION
NONPARTY SOLON
FAILS TO BRING
AUDITOR TO BAR
Highest Tribunal in State Under*
stood to Have Been
Unanimous
CHARGED BASE
The North Dakota supreme
court this morning declined to
grant, on application of W. A.
Anderson, secretary of the state
industrial commission, an order
directing State Auditor Kositzky
to show cause why he should not
be directed by writ of mandamus
to pay Senator J. I. Cahill of drant
county, $114.00, which the senator
alleges to be due him for legis­
lative services during the special
session. Cahill is one of a num­
ber of league legislators who
have not yet received their
mileage and per diem allotment
for the special session for the
reason, the state auditor has eon
tended, that the appropriation
made for this purpose has been
exhausted. The supreme court
order denying the writ does not
go into the merits of the case. It
is understood, however, that the
court was unanimous in declin­
ing to assume jurisdiction.
Declaring that state Auditor Kosit­
zky was actuated by ulterior and im­
proper motives in withholding from
Senator J. I. Cahill of Leith a warranr
for $1M due him in per diem and mile­
age for his services during the recent
special session, W. A. Anderson, secre­
tary of the industrial commission, (Mon
|day applied to the supreme court for -i
writ of mandamus compelling the
state auditor to deliver to Mr. Cahill
his warrant.
Senator Cahill in his affidavit set
forth that he wa^ a duly qualified sen­
ator, that he served as a member o?
the somite- during the ^cerit
session in good faith, that there"ar*
funds available for the payment of his
mileage and jier diem, and that tho
laws require that such payment be
made out of the general funds of the
state.
HOW IT ALL ,STARTED.
The drama in which Tuesday's su
preme court order denying Senator J.
I. Cahill an alternative writ of man
I damas directing State Auditor Kosit
I zky to show cjyise why he should not
pay the Grant county solon mileage
and per diem aggregating $114 for
his services during the special session
formed an interesting chapter,
opened during the closing hours of
the session last Thursday, when the
senate unsuccessfully endeavored, 'by
force, to bring State Auditor Kositzky
before the bar of the upper house
sought without satisfaction to exact
an apology from the state auditor
forcibly evicted' F. E. Packard as as­
sistant attorney general and was
forced to readmit his in his private
capacity as counsel for the state aud­
itor, and, to use the words of some
of the more conservative members of
that .body "conducted itsel* generally
as a kangaroo court, rather than as
a dignified, deliberative body."
The trouble opened' early in the
afternoon when the state auditor de­
clined to set an hour at which the
senators' warrants would be ready for
them. The senate/adopted a resolu­
tion demanding that. Kositzky appear
before that house and explain his
reasons for not having the warrants
ready. Senator A. A. Liederoach. of
Dunn, between whom and the sta:e
auditor there has 'been more or less
bad blood for some time, was com- y
missioned to serve notice on the audi­
tor. In the process of "service" both
Kositzky and Liederbaclc went to the
floor, where they rolled' in a catch
as-catch-can exhibition until sepa
rated by the sergeant-at-arms and
memlbers of the lower house.
When Kositzky finally appeared he
explained that the warrants were not
ready because the payroll had not
been certified to him until a half hour
before the trouble began, and for the
further reason that there was 6nly
$5,000 in the legislative appropriation
fund, while the cost of the special
session was $30,WO. The following
morning Kositzky began signing war­
rants for his "friends," among whom .•••.
he evidently did not include Cahill,
one of the senate's floor leaders, and
the latter made application lor an al­
ternate writ of mandamus through
tho secretary of the industrial coin-1
mission, W. A. Anderson, formerly
with the Minneaoplis park board. -i
It is understood that a majority of
the league legislators are still waiting
for their mileage and per diem w^r
rants. Some have gone home, a ma*
jority of them, in fact, but a few are
still here.
