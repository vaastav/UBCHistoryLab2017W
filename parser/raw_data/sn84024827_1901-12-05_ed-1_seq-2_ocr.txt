Iq iu Issue of Monday Uat the Phoe
nix Republican publishes, under flar
ing bead lines, a special telegram from
Washington which opens with the
following paragraph;
"The ,fight for the remoral of Gov
ernor Murphy is confined to hi per
sonal enemies In Arizona. There is no
echo of It in Washington. No charges
have been Sled, and it is the' intention
of the administration to have him
serve out his term.
"Governor Murphy's commission is
dated to expire December 14, 1902. This
commission Is held to be an original ap
-. pointment and has nothing to do, with
previous commission, s or the term of
offioes of the men' who held them."
The Republican accompanies the tel
egram, with .comments, in which, the
Phoenix correspondent of the Los An
geles Times Is severely scored. The'
Times correspondent- is. well known to
be Major MoCUctocV,.who .endeavored
to win honor and fame during our late
unpleasantness with Spain almost en
tirely by ti'.e wearing of his uniform
denoting' his rank as a captain in the
Rough .Rider regiment, and by news
paper correspondence from Cuba,
through which channel he fought all
thebattles which occurred there. Mc
Clintock is now in Washington, and is
there, presumably, with a view of In
fluencing President Roosevelt in his
Arizona appointments. Be is said to
-stand' well with the president, and it
would reasonably appear that Gov
ernor Murphy most feel secure Jn his
position or he would not permit his
personal organ to jump on McCUntock
at' this1 particular juncture. The Re
publican names as the autlor of the
dispatch in question J. D. Whejpley,
one of the most prominent and reliable
of ttie 'newspaper correspondents at the"
national capital. If Governor Murphy
is not really confident of retaining.his
offlce he is certainly now making a
right royal bluff. However, these
squabbles are all between good Re
publicans,jsnd if they succeed in cut
ting each other's throats politically it
will be no affair of the Democrats.
TO ISf
ElfCTRICITY.
It is highly probable that in the
course of the next few years electricity
will take the place of steam in supply
in'g power for much of th'e machinery
ab the mines in the Lake SuDerior
copper district. It is claimed that th'e
work of many smaller engines about
the mines could be. done by electricity
at a much lessened cost. The princi
pal saving would be fuel. At many of
the mines in this district experiments
are under way upon the results of which
much will depend as regards future
changes.
The Calumet & Hecla company took
the lead in investigating the advant
ages of electricity as a motive power.
Their electricians have been experi
menting for several years, and as a
result it is understood that numerous
changes will bemade shortly. It is
proposed to operate the machinery In
the addition to the Hecla mill by elec
tricity. Each head will have an Indi
vidual motor of 25 horsepower. A new
power house is being built a short dls
ance southwest of the mill. It will
contain two 100 kilowat generators, to
be driven by two ISOO-horsepower. en
gines. The use of electrical pumps in
the Calumet & Hecla mine has' been
moat successful. At the present time
they are used exclusively in the South
Hecla brtinch. At the Calumet branch
steam pumps are used with electriaal
pumps as auxiliaries.
-Thk cattle outlook is splendid. So
far as the market and the demand are
concerned it Is difficult to see where
more inducements could be offered to
' the'bretder than at present. There is
a shortage In the supply, while the pop
ulation baa increased and greatYireign
markets have been opened op. This
demand will be steady for year to
come, and with the visible supply of
cattle 10,000,000 less than it was ten
years ago, the future has many years
to roll by before the supply can poaal
' bly exceed the demand. Youns; man,
get yon a bunch of cows and lire with
them. In the language of a corn belt
t rather., in giving advice ttTnls son:
- "Get a cow; bang to her tall for twen
ty year and yoa can buy as all out."

The Copper .Quean tax injunction
suit will come up before j4udge Davis
on -Thursday afternoon. We 'have ,al
ready expressed our disapproval of tne
action of the Board of Supervisors.
The Copper Queen company Is not
credited with more than or.e tenth of
the total mineral production of tl.e
territory, and, yet, it Is called upon to
pay as much as all the other mine put
together. This would appear on its
face to beMscrimluation against cor
poration which certainly .deserves bet
ter treatment. We believe'tbe gross
vslu of the Copper Queen production
last year at' its furnacas was approxi
mately W.OOO.WO. The assessment
on Its property Is 3,833,M. We con
ceive that no merchant would consent
to 'pay taxes'en bis total sse; y et'sucb
a method or valuation would even be
more reasorable than that1 adopted in
the case of1 the Copper Queen, for a
stock of merchandise can be replaced,
but the value of a mining claim, if it is
worked, is absolutely and permanent
ly reduced by'every ourid of ore ex
tracted. .The" arbitrary value put on
the claims of the Copper Queen com
pany expresses l.this difference very
forcibly and demonstrates the i in possi
bility of assessing property on ' such
evnVscentrvalue,'r from- merely public
rumor. . We nave examined the assess
ment roll and.Und that claims, which
we know were long ago worktd out,
are taxed on their "reputation rather
than their value. We refer to these
anomalies merely as a proof of the dif
ficulties which inevitably attend this
method of assessing values for taxable
properties and the Injustice, and,
therefore, litigation -which is certain
to ensue.
In the present instance the people of
the brant? are deeply concerned, inas
much as the county returns have been
made to the territorial board of equal
ization on this enormously high valua
tion, which the Copper Queen certain
ly cannot be expected to admit. The
territorial levy belng.mado on this ex
travagant valuation will leavathe coun
ts treasury empty and involve among
otberhardships; the closing of the
public 'schools long oiTCtli? school
year-:actually expires. ,-The Copper
Queen company has never defaulted) in
its payments "to the public On the
other hand 'itrb'as 'been noted for its
liberality; and; therefore, we are cer
tain that it will be willing, to relieve
the county of the embarrassment in
which ithasbeen iuvolved by the dis
criminating and arbitrary: action of
the: Board of Supervisors. If .any way
can be' suggested cf Its doing so, with
out weakening. Its legal position or ad
mitting liabilities, whlth is it certainly
justlfiedrin submitting to the court for
adjudication before paying them.
The Phoenix. Gazette states on the
authority" of its Washington corre
spondent that at a abinet"meetlng
held last Sunday the.Arlzonu appoint
ments were considered and virtually
determined upon.
