Message to Congress Deals With
the Tru8t Question The Inter,
lew by Republican State Chair
man of Ohio.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 5, 1911. I
(Special to The Caucasian.)
With the opening of Congress on
Monday the reat battle of 1912 has
begun. Nearly every Congressman
and Senataor were in their seats, and
Desldes an unusually large number
gamerea eariy in tne lobbies and on
the floor of both Houses, not only to
exchange greetings but to make earn
est inquiries of each other. The
Congressman or Senator from the
far west was seeking out thase from
the east and north and inquiring
about the political outlook in this
State and that, and vice versa.
The question which the eastern
Republicans mostly put to the wes
tern Republicans was, Did the Presi
dent strengthen himself in the west
on his recent trip? The general
concensus ,of the replies was that
he did. Some declared that he
strengthened himself very much.
Even some who are not enthusias
tically supporting the President ad
mitted that he commanded the at-
tention of the people, that they lis-
tened intently to what he said, and
that they were ready to approve his
administration if he and his Tariff
Board should make good during this
session of Congress on the 'question
of revision along the line of his
speeches.
A Mixed and Interesting Situation.
One sitting in the galleries could
realize that there were not only two
great parties facing each other for
the control of this great Govern
ment, but that both of these parties
are so badly divided as to almost
amount to four parties. Every one
realized that the situation was un
usually mixed and uncertain, and
besides that the verdict of the people
at the polls next year will be, really
determined by what Congress does
or does not do in the next few
months.
Among the members there was
the greatest diersity of. sentiment as
to how long the session would run
nd fta tn what, would be done. Mr.
underwood, the Democratic leader,
said Congress would stay, in session
until next fall, long after both the
national conventions had been held.
There were others who thought that
Congress would get down to DusIness
early and pass some measure
strengthening the Sherman anti-trust
haw as requested by the President,
and also pass or refuse to pass the
legislation revising the tariff accord
ine to the facts which the Tariff
- ard furnisn president.
There was great interest shown by
the general public also as to the
meeting of Congress. More than an
hour before the assembling' of Con
gres every seat in the galleries was
taken, and those anxious to get seats
were pacneo ten 10 mieen leet ueep
in the galleries outside.
President Taft's Message.
President Taft's message to Con
gress Tuesday was devoted entirely
to the Sherman anti-trust act and
to the trust question in general, but

messages dealing on other subjects
will be sent to Congress before the
adjournment for the holidays.
Republican State Chairman Brown
of Ohio.
The recent Interview given by Re
publican State Chairman Brown, of
Ohio, in which he said that the ma
jority of the Republicans of Ohio
were against the renomination of
President Taft, was for a day or vwo
the subject of much discussion, not
only at the Capitol but also in all
the hotel lobbies.
It Is understood, however, that
Chairman Brown was expressing dif
ferent opinions when he was trying
to get some patronage for some of
his friends in Ohio not long ago, and
the fact that the President could
not see his way to appoint some of
the men. recommended and urged byJ
Air. crown is me wnoie cause oi nis
recent hostile Interview.
Leading Republicans from Ohio,
who have been here for the last few
days, say that the President will get
a solid delegation from his State,
and that the interview of State
Chairman Brown will only make the
rank and file of the Republicans of
Ohio more active and earnest in their
support of the President and his pol
icies. Congressman Littleton's Speech.
On the opening day of the session
of the House, Congressman Martin
W. Littleton, of New York, arose to
a question of personal privilege,
reading extracts from some newspa
pers containing anonymous attacks
upon him, charging that he was a
friend of the Steel Trust and was
trying to prevent further investiga
tion by the Congressional Committee.
Mr. Littleton not only denounced
these attacks as false and cowardly,
but he went further and declared
that some members of the Investigat
ing committee had either been fooled
or induced to take the position which
they had in opposition to the course
he had urged in order to bear the
stock market, and that certain bear
operators on the stock exchange in
New York had been reaping great
profits thereby. This amounts to an
attack upon the Democratic members
of the investigating committee who
disagree with Mr. Littleton, and will
force them to retort.
A number of the Democratic lead
ers exhausted every effort to try to
keep Mr. Littleton from making this
speech and to try to patch up har
mony in the committee, but their ef
forts failed and the breach is now
wide and looks as if it will grow
wider and extend to a further breach
in the ranks of the party. Indeed, it
Is clear that there is already a much
greater division in the ranks of the
Democratic party at the opening of
Congress than there is in the ranks
of the Republican party.
It Was Time to Pray.
A preacher, at the close of one of
his sermons, said: "Let all In the

woman and child, with one exception,

The preacher seated them and
said: "Now, every man not paying
his debts stand up." The exception,
a care-worn, hungry looking individ
ual, clothed in his last summer suit,
slowly assumed a perpendicular po
sition. - "How is It. my friend," asked the
minister. "You, are the only man
not to meet his obligations?"
"I run a. newspaper," he answered
meekly, "and the brethren here who

At Los Angeles, California, Fri

confessed that he blew up the Lot
Angeles Times Building and bis
brother confessed that he was re
sponsible for the destruction of the!
Llewellyn Iron Works, thus brin-tin!
to an end one of the most noted cases !
in the history of this country.
In October, 1910, the Times Build
ing in Los Angeles was blown up by
dynamite and twenty-one persons
were killed. The Times is owned by
General Harrison G. Otis, who em
ployed his labor to suit himself and
refused to listen to the demands of
the union printers, and it was due to

uieweiiyn iron worxs were oiown up
for a similar cause. The case had !
been in court for more than a omnth j
but the jury box had not been filled
when the two brothers confessed.
The following report of the case
was out from Los Angeles Friday
night:
"James B. McNamara pleaded
guilty to murder in the first degree
in Judge Walter Bordwell's court
here to-day. His brother, John J.
McNamara, Secretary of the Interna
tional Association of Bridge and
Structural Iron Workers, entered a
plea of having dynamited the Llew
ellyn Iron Works in Los Angeles on
cgfinaa Day-19 it)
"James B. McNamara's confession
clears up absolutely the tragedy of
the explosion and fire which at 1:07
o'closk on the morning of October
1, 1910, wrecked the plant of The
Los Angeles Time at First and
Broadway and caused the death of
twenty-one persons. For nineteen of
these deaths, the McNamara brothers
were indicted and J. B. McNamara
was on trial superfically for the mur
der of Charles J. Haggerty, a machin
ist whose body was found nearer than
that of any other to the spot where
the dynamite was supposed to have
been placed.
"Both men's sentences were set for
December 5th, when it is supposed
District Attorney John D. Freder
icks will ask for life imprisonment
for James B. McNamara, the confess
ed murderer, and probably fourteen
years for his brother. The men's
lives are considered saved. The great
contention that The Los Angeles
Times was not dynamited is dead be
yond resurrection or argument.
To-night as the two brothers sat
together in the county jail refusing
to see anyone or make any state
ment an interest second only to the
occurrence itself, hung about the
question with reference to James B.
McNamara 'Why did he confess?'
To this opposing counsel gave the
same answer.
" 'He confessed because he was
guilty and that's all there is to it,'
declared District Attorney Freder
icks. " 'He was counselled to confess
because that was the best thing to
do, in the opinion of counsel,' said
Attorney Clarence S. Darrow, chief
of counsel. 'I will say now that there
was no other reason or motive in it.
I've studied this case for months. It
presented a stone wall.'
"Darrow also denied that external
looking squarely in the face, the
charges that the recent arrest of Bart
H. Franklin, an investigator employ
ed by the defense and two others with
him, might have precipitated a situa
tion untenable save by confession of
the prisoner. 'Negotiation have been
on for weeks, asserted Darrow, and
this was corroborated by District At
torney Fredericks. "We expected at
one time that Jim would confess last
Monday but he did not,' said Dar
row. McManigal Tells Gruesome Tale.
"Ortle E. McManigal, the confess
ed dynamiter whose admissions are
said to have been a big factor in the
McNamaras pleading guilty, will go
practically free if the plans of the
State in his behalf do not go wrong.
"District Attorney Fredericks told
Malcolm McLean (a Burns detective)
that he would do the best he could
for McManigal.

pleas of the McNamaras, said he was

hid the stuff and marked the spot so
that I could not possibly fall to find
It when I wanted It.
"I had been told by J. B. how
to get the Llewellyn Iron Works. It
took me a few days though to find
the Baker Iron Works.
"Then I looked about for the

setting up a new press there at the

the whole twelve quarts of 'dope at

scribe and denounce methods of com
petition that are unfair."
To supervise corporations char
tered under federal law, Preildsftt
Taft proposed the creation of as ex
ecutive bureau, or commission, trf h
powers akin to tboss of the inter
state Commerce Commission.
Speaking of the much discussed
' dissolution of the tobacco trust, tbe
a 1 President declared that ta hi opin
ion "not In the history of American
law has a dec res more effective for
such a purpose been entered by a
court."
Portions of hi message of Janu
ary, 1910, proposing Federal incor
poration were referred to in this mes
sage. "I renew," continued the Presi
dent, "the recommendations of the
enactment of a general law providing
for the voluntary formation of corpo
rations to engage In trade and com
merce among the States aad with
forenlon nations. It Is even more
manifest now than it was then that
though denounclatlon of conspira
cies is restraint should not, aad does
not, mean the denial of organisations
large enough to be entrusted with
our interstate or foreign trade. It
has been made more clear now than
it was then that a purely negative
statute like the anti-trust law may
well be supplemented by specific pro
visions for the building up and regu
lation of legitimate national and for
eign commerce."
The supplement legislation the
President desires Is explained in a
paragraph. "The attempt aad pur
pose to suppress a competitor by un
derselling him at a price so unprofit
able as to drle him out of business,
or the making of exclusive contracts
with customers under which they are
required to give up associations with
other manufacturers and numerous
kindred methods for stifling competi
tion and effecting monopoly, should
be described with sufficient accuracy
In a criminal statute on the one hand
to enable tha Government to shorten
its task by prosecuting single misde
meanors Instead of an entire con
spiracy, and, on the other hand, to
serve the purpose of pointing out
more in detail to the business com
munity what must be avoided."
Mr. Taft did not attempt to set
forth the details the Federal incor
poration act be recommended bat
suggested that combinations of capi
tal allowed to become Federal corpo-.
ration should be subject to rigid
rules as to organizations and pro
cedure. Including effective publicity,
and to the "closest supervision" as
to stock and bond issues by the pro
posed executive burea or commission

ment. Federal incorporation, the
President declared, would not exempt
any concern or its officers from pros

empowered, the President said, to In
voke the aid of tbe Bnreau of Cor
poration in determining the suitable
reorganization of corporations dis
solved Jby decrees. This work, he
pointed out, might be entrusted to
the proposed supervisory commission
which "should be an executive tribu
nal, of the dignity and power of the
comptroller of the currency or the in
terstate commerce commission."
Again referring to the Sherman
law, the President says:
"The an ti-trust act Is tbe expres
sion of the effort of a freedom lov
ing people to preserve equality of op
portunity. . -' ;

Supreme Court must continue to be
