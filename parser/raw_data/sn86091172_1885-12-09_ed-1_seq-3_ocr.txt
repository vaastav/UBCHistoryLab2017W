The medical directorship or guperii.
tendency of the Territorial Insane
Asylum at Black foot. That official
will have control of all expenses at the
institution, aud be the disciplinarian
of the same. He muat, of course, be
a physician of good standing. His
salary rests entirely with the Board,
but will probably not be less than
13U00 a year and board and lodging
for himself and family—or a billet
equal to *6000 per year. He will
probably not be elected until next
February or March, as the Asylum
will not be ready until then, but it is
such a good "plum" that a majority of
the physicians in this Territory would
doubtless wish to secure it. They
will therefore feel grateful to the
Times for mentioning the matter at
this early date.
AN OLD COASTER MARRIED.
He
Meets HU Fate in Omaha, an*
Mettles There for Life,
Dr. J. M. Rice recently got married
in Omaha, Nebraska, the bride-elect
being Mrs. Anna borel, a prominent
dealer in hair goods and millinery of
that city.
Dr. Rice is well and favorably
known in Idaho and Oregon, as he
has probably done more to colonize
those adjoining commonwealths than
nineteen-twentieths of their citizens.
Prior to 1880 he operated in Oregon,
and successfully "floated" the Port
land city Homestead, containing over
1000 lots, in 1881 he came to Idaho,
and a year or so later agreed to go
East fer the purpose of advertising
Idaho and starting hitherward a farm
ing colony. Being a man of infinite
resource, he required but little help
besides a few letters of recommenda
tion, anJ in 1883 brought out several
car-loads of settlers, over half of whom
are here to this day, arid delighted
with their change of base.
I)r. Rice has finally got tired of
roaming on the frontier, and conclud
ed to settle in Omaha, where he will
engage in the real estate business. As
he knows no such word as "tail," he
will doubtless succeed there, and will
not be likely to coine to Wood River
again, unless it be to look after some
of his mining and other interests here.
Idaho has therefore lost in him one of
her best citizens. This will not, how
ever, deter Ins many friends here from
wishing himself and bride life-long
happiness and prosperity.
The Wiswell Mill.
The Wiswill mill being erected at
the Donovan group was to have been
started up today for a trial run. To
morrow it will doubtless begin crush
ing steadily. Now, if the gold is in
the rock, the gold belt is "made."
Telpherage.
The telpherage system of Ayrton
and Terry, the English electricians,
has for its object the conveyance of
any kind of goods divisible into par
cels of two hundredweight at a speed
of four or five miles an hour. The
motive power is electricity, which
drives the carrying buckets along a
cable suspended on posts. A telpher
line has just been established at
Glyude, in Sussex, and the system has
proven a sqccess from n scientific
point of view, the commercial value
of such a meant of carrying light
freight remaining to bo determined.
A colossal plant specimen exists in
the garden of Mr. J. B. Torry.at Sun
ningdale, England. It ia a vine or
tree of Wiataiia which covert a wall
ni ne feet high for a distance of 340
feet.
A list of the plants of Japan has

CLETILAND'S MESSAGE.
IT IS A VERY PLAIN AND UNAS*
NUX1NU DOCUMENT.
He Takes Decided Ground Afalmst
the Continued Coinage of Silver, feat
la " Solid " ea the Mormon Question
—Death of a Two-Hundred Million
aire.
Sped a 1 to the Wood IIttbb Trait.)
Omaha, December 9,1883.
The President's message waa sent
to Congress yesterday, but too late for
your use.
Inasmuch as you are most inter
csted in the silver question, 1 send you
the President's views on this subject
first. His Excellency takes positive
grounds against the continued coin
age of silver, and emphatically recom
mends the repeal of the Bland law.
In order to defend and strengthen
his position, the President states that
up to the present time, notwithstand
ing the most strenuous effuits of the
hi-metallists, only about *50,000,000
of silver coin is in circulation, of the
*215,000,000 coined—leaving *165,
000,000 atill in tho United States
Treasury or in the hands of the
Government officials, necessitating
enormous expense in constructing and
maintaining strong and large vaults
for its secure keeping and prolonged
deposit. Against the latter amount
of silver coin there are only about
*93,000,000 of outstanding silver cer
tificates.
Every month about *2,000,000 of
coin
the gold coin in the United States
Treasury and sub-treasuries hss to be
paid out in exchange for two million
silver dollars, according to law, which
are regularly added to the idle mass
of silver already accumulated. If tliii
ia continued long enough it will result
in substituting silver for all
the gold that the Government owns.
It will not do to rely upon the customs
receipts of the government to make
good this decline of gold because the
silver shut coined can easily be made
a leyal-tender for all debts and dues.
Public and private hoarding of gold
has already begun, and when the time
comes when gold shall disappear from
circulation then there will he a marked
and plainly apparent difference be
tween the real value of silver and
gold dollars and the two coins will
part company. Gold will still
remain the standard of value and,
necessarily, our dealings with for
eign countries will compel us to pro
cure it, no matter at what premium
over silver; the banks which will have
received gold for deposits from their
customers will pay them in deprecia
ted silver bought with such gold—
thus realizing a handsome profit, the
laboring men and women, who are
most defenseless of all, will find that
the dollar received in wages fer their
haul toil has sadly shrunk in pur
chasing power.
Mr. Cleveland quotes Daniel Web
ster at some length to sustain his
views, aud claims thr.t if the coinage
of silver be continued we may reason
ably expect gold and its equivalent to
abandon the field of circulation to
silver alone. This must, of course,
produce a severe contraction of our
circulating medium, instead of adding
to it.
He refers to the proceedings at the
recent monetary conference of the
powers of the Latin Union and draws
the conclusion therefrom that if the
vital parts of the silver coinage act re
main in operation unrep ealrd in this
country, we will find ourselves with
out a single powerful ally or friend
j

with silver in the illogical and losing
. .
contest we nave OU hand.
Especial efforts l«ve been made by
r J
the Secretaries of the Treasury, to
. . c •!
force an amount of silver coin into
circulstion; but the amounts thus put
1
out have soon returned in payment of
1 « -
duties. This proves that the people, do
not -lesire to keep it on hand,and that
continued efforts in this direction
would only result in total failure.
It being evident that the present
stock of silver dollars is ample to sup
ply all the legitimate needs of the
people and being satisfied that they
can be readily obtained in the usual
business ways by those who need
them, while the demand for silver for
use in the arts is increasing, the
President recommends the suspension
of the coinage of silver dollars au
thorized by the law passed in Febru
ary, 1878.
Omaha, December 9, 3 p. m.
The President's message is consid
ered a very tame and commonplace
document. I therefore refrain from
putting you to heavy expense of a
synopsis of it.
In his recommendations on the
Mormon question, he approves of the
repressive work already done in Utah
and Idaho, and states that he will
gladly approve further legislative ac
tion for expunging this foul blot upon
our fair fame.
William II. Vanderbilt died in
New York City, at 2:30 o'clock yes
terday afternoou, of a stroke of par
alysis—the result of appoplezy. His
death having been anticipated for
some time, it will have very little ef
fect on the stock market.
Coming to Contract for Ore.
Vice President Wright, of the Phil
adelphia Mining and Smelting Com
pany, will leave Philadelphia to-mor
row for Hailey, to make ore contracts
for next year's deliver)'. If he suc
ceeds in making satisfactory arrange
ments the company's furnaoes will run
in full blast; otherwise not. Inas
much as the ore output is steadily in
creasing and the company's treatment
of sellers has been very liberal, this
year, Mr. Wright will probably have
no difficulty iu renewing liia con
tracts.
