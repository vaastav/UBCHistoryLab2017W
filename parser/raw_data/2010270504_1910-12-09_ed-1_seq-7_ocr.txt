Referring to tho negotiation of now

eays:

"In tho caso of sovoral countries In
stances of apparent unduo discrimina

found to exist. Thoso discriminations

"Tho policy of broader and closor

"It Is gratifying," says tho president,
"that tho reduction In tho postal

any curtailment of postal facilities.
On tho contrary, tho Borvlco has been

Second-Class Mall.
"In my last annual mossngo I In
vitod tho attention of congress to tho
Inadequacy of the postal rato lmposod
upon second-class mall matter In so
far as that Includoa magaxlnoa, and
showed by figures prepared by experts
of tho postofneo department thnt tho
government was rcndorlng n service
to tho magazines, costing many mil
lions in excess of tho compensation
paid. An answer was attempted to
this by tho representatives of tho
magazines, nnd n reply was filed to
thla answer by tho pootofrico depart
ment. Tho utter inadequacy of tho
answer, considered in its light of tho
repiy or the rortofflcc fentrtsunt. 1
think must must arpcal to any fair
minded person. Whothor tho nnswer
was all that could bo said In behalf of
mo magazines Is another question. I
agree that tho question is ono or fact;
but I insist thnt If tho fact is as the
experto of tho postofllco dopartmont
show, that wo nro furnishing to tho
owners of magazines a service worth
millions moro thnn they pay for It,
thon Justlco requires thnt tho rato
should bo Increased. ,Tho Increnso In
tho receipts of tho dopartmont result

to increasing tho usofulnoss of tho do

class postago to ono cent. It haB boon
said by tho postmaster gonoral that a

SInco that tlmo there havo boon with
