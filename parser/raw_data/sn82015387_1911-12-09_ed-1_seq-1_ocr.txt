MEETWITH'
R AILROAD MEN
Citizens of Covington and
Officials of N. O. G. N.
Meet in Covington and Talk
Over Matter of Service.
Better Time Will be Given
If Stops are Cut Down.
Road Willing to Do What It
Can to Improve Service.
In response to a request of the
Executive Committee of the Coving
ton Commercial Club, officials of the
New Orleans Great Northern Rail
road Company met the Committee
and a number of the citizens of Cov
ingtozi, Monday afternoon, at the of
fices of the company in the depot.
Notification that the officials would
be in Covington at that time came
too latp to have at the meeting all
those that it was intended should be
there, as it was cbnsidered that
Abita Springs and other towns on
the road were equally interested in
the matter of securing a better
schedule and in the general discus
. ion of railroad service. There
Were present, however. H. R. How
Ard, general manager; John L.
Davis, superintendent of transpor
tation; .M. J. McMahon, general pas
menger agent; G. H. Gussing, sup
el~ntendent of motive power; Mayor
G. M.. .Marrero, H. J. Smith, Dr. R.

.: ·· egudray and W. G. Davis, :' J. San
ders, D. H. Mison and W. H. Kent,
' Mr. Jb' L. Davis speaking for
the railroad company, entered into
quite lengthy details in explanation
of the causes of the present defec
tive sbrvice. His plea was that this
branch of 'the road was not now pay
tug the company; that the road was
paying 5 per cent on $8,000,000 of
bonds and $14,000 per month to the
Northeastern for the use of their
tracks to Slidell, and that in fact the
road might be better off if that ser
vice were discontinued. He stated
that it was ,to. .the ,terest of 'the
Soompany :teapy portion
Shive. repair work done
t they wer6 somewhat crip
en' this account; but that they
expected soon to have two new foco
motives,. which would greatly ease
'. t the situation and would enable them
to keep ;up the schedule time. The
chair ear,, he said, had been taken
off for repairs and would be placed
back if we desired it. He further
stated that if we compell the com
pany to meet all our requirements
and that in consequence the road
was' forced into the hands of a re
ceiver, ,it would then be run under
the control of the receiver, free from
the interferencce df the Railroad
Commission, and that we would only
get, such service as the profits de
manded.
Mr. Davis seemed to be fair and
S honest in discussing the situation
and left the impression that the road
was willing to do what it could to
better conditions.
Manager Howard statde that he
thought five minutes or more might
be cut off the schedule by eliminat
inag some of the lost time at North
Slidell, and if, as suggested' by Mr.
McMahon; the stop at Claiborne and
Osone Park could be cut out ten min
ades more could be taken from the
schedule.
* Mr. Davis also spoke of the fact
that their agreement with the
Northeastern called for time of not
less than one hour and ten minutes
between New Orleans and Slidell;
hence all improvement in the sched
ule must be made between Slidell
and Covington, and as there were
,eleven stops, inclusive, the actual
running time was about as good as
could be expected. It was the stops
that lengthened it.
The general feeling is that if the
railroad will do what it can for Cov
lagton the people will gladly do what
they can to make it a paying prop
osition.

PRESIDENT ON
SHERMAN ACT
His Third Annual Message
Confined to It Only.
Defends Act as Interpreted
by the Supreme Court.
Declares It Effective in Dis
solutiou of Trusts.
Refers to Message of 1910
on Federal Incorporation.
Washington, Dec. 5.--President
Taft's third annual message to Con
gress, devoted exclusively to the
Sherman anti-trust act and the trust
question in general, was read in
Congress to-day.
The president defended the Sher
man act as interpreted by the Su
preme Court of the United States,
Indicated plainly his opposition to
the repeal or amendment of this
statute,, but suggested that Congress
pass a Federal incorporation law and
supplemental legislation that "would
describe and denounce methods of
competition that are unfair."
To supervise corporations charter
ed under the Federal law, President
Taft proposed the creation of an ex
ecutive bureau, or commission, with
powers akin tothose of the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
Speaking of the much-discussed
dissolution of the tobacco trust, the
president declared that, in his opin
ion, "not in the history of American
law has a decree more effective for
such a purpose been entered by a
court."
Portions of his message of Janu
ary, 1910, proposing Federal incpr
poration, were referred to in this
message.
STATUTE IS NEGATIVE.
"I renew," continued the presi
dent, "the recommendations of the
enactment of a general law provid
ing for, the voluntary formation of
corporations to engage in trade and
commerce among the states and for
eign nations. It is even more mani
fest now than it was then that the
denunciation of conspiracies -Ia re
straint of trade should not an4 does
not mean the denial of orgniza
tions large enough to be int ,sed
with, our interstate ore.
It hai be en
than, ifwags:
c provisions for the buildig ºp
and regulation of legitimate nation
al and foreign commerce."
The supplemental legislation the
presidenf desires is explained in a
paragraph: "The attempt and pur
pose to suppres a competitor by un
derselling him at a price so unprofit
able as to drive him out of business,
or the making of exclusive contracts
with customers under which they
are required to give up associations
with other manufacturers and num
erous kindred methods for stifling
competition and effecting monopoly
should be described with sufficient
accuracy in a criminal statute on the
one hand to enable the government
to shorten its task by prosecuting
single misdemeanors, instead of an
entire conspiracy; and, on the other
hand, to serve the purpose of point
ing out more in detail to the busi
ness, community what must be
avoided."
MORE ABOUT THE PRIZES FOR
BIBLE STUDY.
The object of the International
Press Bible Question Club is to pro
mote through the press, thought and
investigation on the teaching of
Scripture in connection with the In
ternational Sunday School Lessons.
To this end some very valuable
prizes are offered on very simple
terms. There are to be given to the
Farmer's readers in connection with
the other papers that join the I. P. B.
Q. C. during the current three
months fifty prizes, viz: Five solid
gold medals, five sterling silver
medals, five teachers' Bibles, worth
$5.50 each, thirty-five copies of "The
Heart of Christianity," price $1.50
each. This book is said to be the
best thing written, in this century,
on its vital subject. The gold and
silver medals are beautifully engrav
ed with an emblematic desikn and
the name of the winner will be en
graved on the reverse side. It will
be no small honor to be a gold or
silver medalist in this gerat inter
national organization. Any person
who takes up this simple course of
study stands a .good chance of re
ceiving that honor.
The simple questions are: 1.
That commencing February 18, 1912
the International Sunday School Les
sons must be read and "The Sug
gestive Questions" for fifty-two con
secutive weeks, and a coupon should
be cut from this paper each week
and signed, certifying to the reading.
2. Must answer in writing any five
of the questions that are indicated
to be so answered, getting help from
any source, if that is necessary. 3.
Within one week of the' close of the
contest must deliver to this office
all the coupons which have been cut
out, together with the five written
answers. The prizes will then be
awarded to those who hand in the
greatest number of coupons. If two
or more send in an equal number of
Eoupons, the tie, or ties, will be brok
en by an examination of the written
eawers, and the prizes will be
awarded to 'those who get the high
est number of marks from an im
Dartial examination of the answers.
