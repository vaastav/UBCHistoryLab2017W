President Grants' aeventh annual mei
gaga was transmitted to Congress yester
day. Its scope and spirit are here pre
sented in a synopsis which we trust will
be sufficiently clear and comprehensive
to meet ths desire of onr readers:
THE INTR0DCCT10K
Is devoted to a comparison between the
present condition of the country and the
colonies one hundred years ago. We
were then a people ef 3,000,000, now of
over 49,000,000. Then onr indastries
were confined to the filiate of the soil;
now manufactures absorb much of the
labor of the country. . Our liberties are
unimpaired; bondsmen are free. We
have the respect of all civilized nations.
Thirteen States have increased to thirty
eight, and many territories. The in
ventions, achievements and material
changes in our system of industry are
set forth.
vii.ue of roruLia edccitiox.
In this republic, where one man is as
good as another before the law, it is of
the greatest importance that all should
be possessed of education and intelli
gence enough to cast a vote with a right
understanding of its meaning. Educa'
tion is the only safeguard against the
tyranny of demagogues and priestcraft.
The education of the masses becomes of
the first necessity for the promotion of
oar institutions. All other forms of gov
ernment approach oars only in propor
tion to the general diffusion of educa'
tion and independence of thought and
action. .The President, therefore, n-
commends a constitutional amendment
to be submitted to all the legislatures,
making it the duty of the States to es
tablish and forever maintain free public
schools, wherein shall be taught the rudi
mentary branches irrespective of sex,
color, birth-place or religion, forbidding
in said schools the teaching of religions,
Atheistic or Pagan, and prohibiting the
granting of any school funds Or school
taxes or any part thereof by legislation
municipal or otherwise, (or the benefit
of any other object of any nature or
kind whatever.
TAXING CBCRCH PRUFERTT.
In this connection the President calls
attention to the vast amount of church
property which has accumulated and
which, if it remaio so, will lead to great
trouble before the end of the nineteenth
century. In 1859 the untaxed church
property amounted to $83,000,000; in
1660 it bad doubled; in 1875 it is about
$200,000,000,' and by 1900 it will, utless
checked, reach the sum of 300,000.000
Such a vast sum receiving the protection
of the government without bearing its
proportion of the expenses and burdem
of the same will not be regarded ac
quiescently by the tax payers. In a
country where real estate enhances so
rapidly there is scarcely a limit to the
wealth that may be acquired by corpora
tions, religious or otherwise, if allowed
to retain property without taxation.
The contemplation of bo vast a property
as here allowed without taxation may
lead to sequestration without constitu
tional authority and through blood. The
taxation ol all property equally, whether
church or corporation, is suggested, ex
empting only the last resting place of
the dead, and, possibly, with proper re
strictions, church edifices.
OCR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Our relations with most of the foreign
powers continue on a satisfactory aad
friendly footing. Increased inteicourse,
extension of commerce and the cultiva'
tion of mutual interests' have improved
our relations with a large majority of the
powers of the world, rendering practica
ble the peaceful solution of question
which from time to time arise, leaving
few wbicb demand extended or particu
lar notice. Portugal has adopted an act
for the abation of servitude in the Por
tuguese colonies. The President is of
opinion that by suitable-legislation Amer
lean citinens abroad should be prohib
ited from holding slaves. Chili has
made reparation for the seizure of one
of our whaleships two years ago; and the
arbitration of a claim ajiinst the Repub
lic of Columbia has been decided in onr
favor.
SPAIN AND CDBA.
Spain has promptly paid $90,000 in
coin to the United States te be distrib
uted among the families or persons who
became sufferers by the Virginias affair.
The amoent has been ordered distribu
ted. As to Cuba no evidence has been
furniahed of un approaching end of the
ruinous conflicts which have been raging
there with utter disregard of the laws
of oivilized warfare, and of the just de
mends of humanity for the last seven
years. The scene of ruin and deiola
tien wrought is drawn, and the disastrous
effects on the trade and commerce of
the United States set forth; also the fact
that many of our'citiiens have acquired
property on the Island which has become
greatly depreciated in value, as well as
rendered insecure. Other nations are
likewise afflicted, though not ie the same
degree. The States thus suffering will
soon be compelled to consider what the
interests of the people and their duties
toward themselves demand. Great
reluctance is expressed to interfere
in the affairs of a friendly power.
Thns far all the resorts of Spain have
proved abortive, and there is no improve
ment in the situation. Neither party
on the island has gained any advantage,
but the sacrifice of life and property con
tinues. The insurgents, while holding
their ground, have not risen to the dig
nity of a new power or established a
State with all its machinery of govern
ment, to establish internal policies and
enforce laws or send a flig forth to
other powers. The definition of a State
and its constituent elements are given
at length. The Cubans do Hot come up to
the President's standard, and, therefore,
cannot be recognized even as belliger
ents, although it is admitted to be doubt
ful whether Spain, with all her power,
can ever subdue them. A recognition
under such circumstances would be in
consistent with facts, and would compel
the power that gave it to support by
force the government to which it had
really given only claim of existence.
The conflict in Cuba, according to the
view of the President, does not reach
the dignity of war; therefore the Cubans
cannot be recognized as belligerents,
much Hess as independent. Tbe contest
is older, but not greater. Tbe various
questions and complications that
might Arise after recognition are
set forth at considerable lengtn in
lawyer-like style. Recognition being
conclusively inadmissible, in the view
of the President, it remains to consider
what coursa shall be adopted, should the
conflict not soon be brought to an end
by the acts of the parties themselves,
and should the evils which result there
from, afflicting all nations and particu
larly the United States, continue. Tbe
contending parties appear to have within
themselves no depository of common
confidence to suggest wisdom when pas
sion and excitement have their sway.
The good office .of the United States
were tendered as mediator in the early
days of the conflict, but they were at the
time declined by Spain, with the declara
tion, nevertheless, that at a future time
they would be necessary. No intimation
has been received that in tbe opinion of
Spain that time has been reached, and
yet the strife continues with its dread
horrors, and all it injuries to the inter
est of the United States and of otlsjpr ha
tiops. Either mediation or intervention
seems to be tbe only alternative which
must sooner or later be invoked for the
termination of the strife. One or tbe
other may be required at an early day,
and unless some settlement is arrived at
soon, the President promises Congress a
special message on tbe subject.
THE MEXICAN QUESTION.
Depredations by armed bands from
Mexico on the people of Texas near the
frontier continue; though the main ob
ject of incursions is robbery, they fre
quently result iu the murder of unarmed
and peaceably-disposed persons, and in
some instances even the United States
postoffices and mail communications
have been attacked. Renewed remon
strances upon this sutject have teen
addressed to the Mexican government,
but without much apparent effect; tbe
military force of this government dis
posable for service in that quarter is in
adequate to effectuality guard the line
even a those points where the incur
sions are usually made. An experiment
of an armed vessel on the Rio Grande
for that purpose is on trial, and it is
hoped that, if not thwarted by the shal
lowness of the river and other natural
obstacles, it may materially contribute
to the proteetion of the herdmen of
Texas. The proceedings of the joint
commission under the convention be
tween tbe United States and Mexico of
4th of July, 18C8, on the subject of
claims will (eoon be brought to a close.
Tbe result of those proceedings will then
be communicated to Congrem. '
NEW TREATIES
Have been made with Belgium and the
Ottoman Empire.
THE ALABAMA CLAIMS.
The progress of the adjustment of the
Alabama claims before the Court of
Claims is stated. It is of interest mainly
to claimants.
ALIENS.
The creation of a special court is re'
commended for the consideration and
determination of claims of aliens against
tbe government of the United 8tates
OCEAN CABLES.
Recommendations are made for the
protection of the public against the ex
tortion of ocean telegraph lines and for
regulating charges..
NATURALIZATION.
Considerable space is dtvo'ed to the
subject of fraudulent naturalization. No
restrictions are proposed, but it is shown
that under the simplicity of our forms of
laws fraudulent papers are often obtain
ed, to the injury of ell honest citizen;
whether native on naturalized. On many
occasions it' has been brought to the
knowledge of the government that cer.
tificates of naturalization are held, and
protection or inteference claimed by par
ties who admit that not only tbey were not
within tbe United States at the time of
tbe pretended naturalization, but that
they have never resided in the United
States. In some cases certificates have
been a matter of purchase. Some effect
ual measure is urged to vacate fraudu
lent records and for punishing the guilty
parties.
EXPATRIATION.
Congress has declared the right of ex
patriation to be a national and inherent
right of all people, but while many other
nations havelaws providing what form
alities shall be necessary to work a
change of allegiance, the United States
has enacted no provisions of law, and
has iu no respect marked out how and
when expatriation may be accomplished
by its citizens. It is but justice to bona
fide citizens that no doubt should exist
on such questions, and that Congress
should determine by the enactment of a
law how expatriation will be accom
plished and a change of citizenship be
established. Attention is called to the
necessity of regulating the status of
American women who marry foreigners
abroad and of the children of American
parents who reside abroad.
NATIONAL FINANCES.
The report -of the Secretary of the
Treasury shows the receipts from cus
toms for the fiscal year, ending June 30,
1874, to have been $163,103,833 09, and
for the fiscal year, endiug June 30, 1875,
to havobeen $157,167,722 35, a decrease
for the last fiscal year of $5,936,111 34;
receipts from internal revenue for the
year ending June 30, 1874, were f 103,
409,784 90, and for the year ending June
30, 1875, were $110,007,493 58; increase,
$759,770,868. The President urges
Congress to insure the consumma
tion of the specie resumption act
pMsed by the last . Congress, . and
thinks it would be a great blessing of
brought about Booner than January 1,
1879, and makes suggestions looking to
that end. As one measure he urges the
restoration of the duty on tea and coffee,
which he says would increase the reve
nues from imports $18,000,000 without
increasing the price of those articles to
consumers.
THE ARU7 AND NAVY,
Several suggestions are made with
reference to army regulations, but none
of significance.
The condition of the navy is a subject
of satisfaction. The expenses incurred
in the maintenance of an effective naval
force iu all its branches are necessarily
large, but such a force is necessary to
our positions, relations and character,
and affects seriously the weight of our
principles and policy throughout the
whole sphere of naval responsibility.
Our navy armed with the destructive
weapons of modern warfare, manned by
our seamen, and in charge of our in
structed officers, will present a force
powerful for tbe home purposes of a re
sponsible, though powerful nation. No
explanation is offered of the great activ
ity at tbe various navy yards.
Ol'R INDIAN POLICY.
The method for the treatment of the
Indians adopted at the beginning of tbe
President's first term has been steadily
pursued, and with satisfactory and en
couraging results. It has been product
ive of evident improvement in the con
dition of that race, and will be continued,
with such modifications as further expe
rience may indicate to be necessary.
POLYGAMY.
That polygamy Bhould exist in a free,
enlightened and Christian csuntry, with
out the power to punish so fiagrapt a
crime against decency and morality,
seems preposterous. True, there is no
law to sustain this unnatural vice, bnt
what is needed is a law to punish it as a
crime, and at the same time to fix the
status of the innocent children, the off
spring of thiasystem, and of the possibly
innocent plural wives. But as an insti
tution of polygamy it should be banished"
from the land.
MISCELLANEOUS.
Attention is called to the reports of
the Postmaster General, Black Hill af
fairs, the Patent Office, Land Office,
Pension Office, Centennial Bureau of
Agriculture and territorial affairs in tbe
general terms which have characterized
former messages. The President makes
five leading recommendations: First
establish common schools in every State;
second that no sectarian tenets shall
be taught therein, and make illiteracy
after 1890 a bar to voting; third declare
Church and State forever separate;
fourth return to a specie basis.
After this exhaustive resume, we re
serve comments for another day.
A ('prion Freak of Mature,
A curious freak of nature is found at
Willough Lake, in the northern part of
Vermont, where Mounts I'iegah and
Hor rise 2500 feet from the water and
4000 feet above the sea, and are less
than a mile apart, while the lake below
is of unknown depth, and is supposed to
rest at the bottom of the lea. A few
years ago an immense rock, weighing
over 300 tons, was sfarted from its bed
at the top of Mount Piigah, and fell
down the almost perpendicular face of
the mountain into tbe lake, tearing
away the carriage road and everything
that opposed it, shaking the whole re
gion round and being beard ten and fif
teen miles. Tbe lake is an immense
spring, as hardly a brook flows into it,
but a river flows out large enough to
carry extensive mills. A winding foot
path conducts to tbe summit of Mount
Pisgah, which is abruptly cut off on the
side nearest the lake, forming a perpen
dicular precipice nearly 3000 feet high,
below which lies water of such singular
transparency that one can sie more than
100 feet below the surface.
The temptation to leap from such a
hight is almost irresistible, and no one
his yet visited the place of strong
enough nerve to stand erect and look
over tbe brink, but visitors crawl up on
hands and kuees to satisfy their curiosity.
The view from this bight is grand, lo
the east can be seen tbe White Moun
tains and the Connecticut river, winding
down eighty miles of its course; to the
north and tbe northwest are Mooadock,
Gfty miles away, and the entire length
of Lake Memphremagog, and to the west
is seen tbe western range ol toe ureen
Mountains. Ihe scenery is unsurpassed
in New England, and ths drive over the
carriageway which skirts the lake and
connects Orleans and Caledonia coun
ties is the most picturesque of any in
me state.

a revenue adequate to tbe support of
that service. Ordered printed.
Morton submitted a joint resolution 'to
ameod the Constitution of the United
States so 'as to elect the President and
Vice President by a direct vote of tbe
people, and to abolish the electoral col
lege. Ordered printed and referred to
the Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions when appointed.
The Senate then adjourned till to
morrow. There was an adjourned meeting of
the caucus of Republican Senators this
morning to receive the report of the
caucus committee appointed to revise
the standing committees of the Sedate.
The committees submitted their recom
mendation as to Republican member
ship, and said the Democratic caucus
had not yet compjeted their list of places
