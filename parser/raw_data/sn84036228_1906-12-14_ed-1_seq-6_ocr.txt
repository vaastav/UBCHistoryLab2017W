FEATURES OF THE MESSAGE.
President Roosevelt's recent me.
sage to congress is considered his
greatest effort in that direction. The
president is always interesting, ag
gressive and fearless, whether in
breaking new ground or in harrowing
the old. He has given congress and
the people something to think about
in bis new recommendations, especial
ly those relating to an inheritance tax
and a tax on incomes. Undoubtedly
the latter are with the president in
believing that the time lias come to
curb tlu> tendency toward the accum
ulation of vast fortunes from which
the public derives no benefit, and in
the doing of which they have in some
instances been forced contributors.
Congress may act slowly in these rec
ommendations and they may encount
er strong opposition, but this should
only strengthen the need of such leg
islation. which will eventually be had.
In the matter of injunctions the
president has considerable to say, but
lie treats tile subject in a fair and
broad spirit. In his last message lie
suggested the enactment of a law in
connection with the issuance of in
junctions and in this message says
attention lias been sharply drawn to
tlie matter by the demand that the
right of applying injunctions in labor
cases should be wholly abolished. The
president doubts whether such a law
would stand the test of the courts and
he does not favor it. He clearly states
his views in the following, which we
believe will be indorsed by a large
majority of the American people:
"in this matter of injunctions there
is lodged in the hands of the judiciary
a necessary power which is neverthe
less subject to the possibility of grave
abuse. It is a power that should be
exercised with extrente car« and
should be subject to tile jealous scru
tiny of all men, and condemnation
should be meted out as much to the
judge who fails to use it boldly when
necessary as to the judge who uses it
wantonly or oppressively."
The president says a judge should
welcome just criticisms of his decis
ion, for if it lie not allowed the peo
ple will turn to and tend to accept as
justifiable tile intemperate and im
proper criticisms uttered by unworthy
agitators, ".lust and temperate criti
cism. when necessary, is a safeguard
against the acceptance by the people
as a whole of that intemperate antag
onism towards tin juuiciuia which
must be combatted by every right
thinking man, and which, if it became
widespread among the people at large,
would constitute a dire menace to the
republic."
The president lias little time for the
agitator, demagogue and preacher of
discontent, and in his forceful style
makes it clear that he had William
Randolph Hearst in mind in the fol
lowing:
"In dealing with both labor and cat)
ital. with the questions affecting both
corporations and trades unions, there
is one matter more important to re
member than aught else, and that is
th« infinite harm done by preachers
of mere discontent. These are the
men who seek to excite a violent cla.-s
hatred against ail men of wealth. They
seek to turn wise and proper move
ments for the better control of cor
porations and for doing away with (lie
abuses connected with wealth into a
campaign of hysterical excitement and
falsehood in which the aim is to in
flame to madness the brutal passions
of mankind. The sinister demagogues
and foolish visionaries who are always
eager to undertake such a campaign ot
destruction sometimes seek to assu
ciate themselves with those working
for a genuine reform in governmental
and social methods and sometimes
masquerade as such reformers. In
reality they are the worst enemies of
the cause they profess to advocate
just as the purveyors of sensational
slander in newspaper or magazine ate
tile worst enemies of all men who ar?
engage*! in an honest effort to better
what is bad in our social and gov. rn
meutal conditions."
WILL BE A GREAT DEMAND.
The coming year is to be one of un
usual activity in railroad building in
Montana and Fergus county is likely
to tie the focal point or center of the
greatest expenditure of money.
The Chicago. Milwaukee & St. Paul
Is building its Pacific coast extension
across the state, the Great Northern
is constructing its branch between
Great Fails and Billings, while the
Northern Pacific has considerable
work under way. All of which means
that there will tie an unusual deman '
for labor—both men and teams— dur
ing the year.
All of tlie foodstuff for both man and
beast should be grown in Montana
and so far as it applies locally, in Fer
I gus county. Farmers and ranchmen
should give this matter due consider*
tion when planning their crops for the
coining season. There will be a great
demand for hay and oats as well as
vegetables and it will mean good
money in the pockets of our home
producers if they can meet it. Every
effort should be made to avoid the
necessity for shipping in such sup
plies from the east. Raise them
here and keep the money at home.
The state as a whole is to be greatly
benefit ted. during this construction
period Not only in railroad building
alone but in government irrigation en
terprises and in development work in
the mining districts throughout the
state is there going to be a great de
mand for labor and supplies, and the
year is full of promise for not only a
marked increase in population but a'
more abundant prosperity in all indus
tries titan lias mark
drawing to a close.

CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.
We are now m the midst of the
Christinas shopping season and the
advertisements of tile local merchants
annul in the Argus would indicate
:tio they w.-re better supplied this
season to meet the demands of their
patrons than ever before. As "the
early bind catches the first worm" so
will the early shopper have the pick
of articles suitable for Christmas
gifts. In being on hand early and
"avoiding tlie rush" shoppers can not
only make their purchases with com
fort to themselves, but can avoid tax
ing tile clerical force with unneces
sary labor.
Large as a dealer's stock may lie
lie is sure to run short of most desir
able and salable goods in his line.
It requires the expenditure of con
siderable capital to secure a variety
in all lines, hence the early buyers
have the advantage in making selec
tions before (he stocks are reduced
Dun't wait until tile last day before
making your purchases and
blame the local merchants for not
having anything you want.
With true Montana loyalty patriot
ism and pride, patronize local mer
chants. Spend your money at home
in order that it may again find its
way into circulation through local
channels, sohle
back into your own hands.
Look over the liages of the Argus
and read tlie holiday inducements
held out by our advertisers.
They offer great bargains in tilings

Senator Bailey's defense that the
money in* got from President Pierce,
of the Waters-Pierce Oil company
was in tlie nature of a loan, sounds a
little fishy, to say the least.
Postage stamps of the issue of 1907,
put on sale at 6,000 presidential post
offices, will bear on their face tha
uame of the state and city in which
the postoffice is situated. The chief
reason for this innovation is said at
the postoffice department to be the
belief that it will help to do away
with the big postoffice robberies and
make it much easier to trace crimi
nals. Another reason for the change
; is t° enable the postoffice department
to determine the amount of business]
done by the different postoffices and
prevent padding through stamps sold
at some offices to residents who do
business in adjoining cities.
Congress evidently has but little use
for "simplified spelling" and in that
respect is in accord with the majority
sentiment of the country. The house
committee having in charge the legis
lative, executive and judicial appropri

port the following: ''Hereafter in
printing documents authorized by law
or ordered by congress or either branch
thereof, the government printing of
fice shall follow the rules of the or
thography established by Webster or
oilier generally accepted dictionaries
of the English language."
