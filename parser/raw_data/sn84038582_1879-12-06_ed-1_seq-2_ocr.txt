PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow citizens of the Senate and House
of lieprcivntatirc: The members of the
forty-bixth congress have assembled in
the fust regular session, under circum
stances culling for mutual congratulation
and grateful acknowledgment to the Giv
er of a! lliood for the largo and unusual
measure of national prosperity which we
now enjoy. The most interesting events
which have occurred in our public affairs
Biuce my last annual message to congress
are connected with the linanci il opera
tions of the government directly affecting
the business interests of the country. I
congratulate congress upon the success
ful execution of tne
KKSU.MITION
act. At the time iixed and in the man
ner contemplated by law, Hie notes ot the
United Mates began to be redeemed in
com. Since the lirst of January last
they have been promptly redeemed on
lrottuntiiiimi. :ind in all business traiisiu!-
tions, public and private, in all parts
the country, they are received and paid
out as the equivalent of coin. The de
mand upon the treasury for gold and sil
ver in exchange for United States notes
has been comparatively small, and the
voluntary deposit of com ami bullion in
exchange for notes has been very large.
The excess of the precious metals depos
ited or exchanged for United States notes
over the amount of United States notes
redeemed is about 1(),(hk;,(Mio. Tlie re
sumption of specie payment has been fol
lowed bv a very great revival of business.
"With a currency equivalent in value to
the monev of the commercial world, we
are enabled to enter upon an equal com
petition with other nations in trade ami
production. The increasing foreign de
mand for our agricultural products has
caused a large balance of trade in our fa
vor, which has been paid in gold, from
the 1st of July last to Nov. to the
amount of about S"U,(tl)0,Oofl. Since the
resumption of specie payments there has
been a marked and gratifying improve
ment of the public credit. The bonds of
the government bearing only 4 percent,
interest have been Bold at or above par,
8utlicient in amount to pay off all of the
national debt which was redeemable un
der present laws. The amount of inter
est saved annually by the process of re
funding the delit since .March 1, 1S77, is
f 14,l2'.i7.177. The bonds sold were largely
in small sums, and the nuinberwf our cit
izens now holding the public securities is
much greater than ever before. The
amount of the national debt which ma
tures in less than two years is S7!U,11,
700, of which isino.iMKVXiO hear interest at
the rate of 5 per cent., and the balance is
in bonds bearing 0 per cent, interest. It
is believed that this part of the public
debt can be refunded by the issue of 4
per cent, bonds, and Iy the reduction of
interest which will thus be effected about
?!1,ooo,Oim) can lie annually saved to
the treasury. To secure this important
reduction of interest to bo paid by the
United States further legislation is re
quired, which, it is hoped, will be provid
ed by Congress during its present session.
TIIK COIN AUK
of gold bv the mints of the United States
during the liscal year was $lo,(lsii,!ili'. The
coinage of silver dollars since the passage
of the a t tor that purpose, up to Nov. 1,
1sV.i. was l.-.(Hi(),K."il.of which ?12,7(i()..'il I
have been issued troni the treasury and
aie now in circulation, and SoLViuoiOOiiro
still in possession of the government.
The pendency of the proposition for
unity of action hetween the United States
and the principal commercial nations of
Europe to effect a permanent system for
the equality of gold and silver in the rec
ognized money of the world leads me to
recommend that congress refrain from
new legislation on the general subject.
The great revival of trade, internal and
foreign, will supply during the coming
year its own instructions, which mav well
be awaited before attempting further ex
perimental measures with the coinage. I
would, however, strongly urge upon con
gress the importance of ..uthorizing the
secretary of the treasury to suspend the
coinage of .silver dollars upon the present
legal ratio. The market value of the sil
ver dollar being uniformly and largely
less than the market value of the gold
dollar, it is obviously impracticable to
maintain them at par with each other if
both are coined without limit. If the
cheaper coin is forced into circulation it
will, if coined without limit, soon become
the sole standard of value, and thus de
feat the desired object, w hich isa currency
of both gold and silver, which shall be of
equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with
the universally recognized money of the
world. Tne retirement from circulation
of I nited Males notes with the capacity
of legal tender in private contract is a
step to he taken in our progress toward a
sale and staMo currency, which should be
accepted as the policy and the duty of
the government and the interest and se
curity of tde people of it. Ii m my linn
conviction that the issue of legal tender
paper money based wholly upon the au
thority and credit of the government, ex
cept in extreme emergency, is without
warrant in the constitution and a viola
tion ot sound linancial principles. The
issue of United States notes during the
late civil war. with the capacity of legal
tender between private individuals, was
not authorized except as a means of res
cuing the coiintiy from imminent peril.
Ihe circulation of these notes as paper
money tor any protracted period of lime
atu-r the accomplishment of this purpose
was not contemplated by the framers of
the law under which they were issued.
1 hey anticipate! the redemption ami
withdrawal of th-se notes at the ear
liest practicable period consistent with
the aUai!.me(jt ,,f the object tor which
they were provided. The policy of the
L nited Mates, sieadily adhered 'to from
ttie adaption of the constitution, has been
to avoid the creation of a national debt,
and when, from necessity in time or war,
debts have been created they have been
paid off on the return of jace as rapidly
as possible. U ,th this view and for this
purpose it .Hn-coiniuHided that the exist
ing laws for the accumulation of a sink
ing fund suthcient to extinguish the pub
lic debt within a limited period he main
tained. If any change of the objects or
rates ot taxation is deemed necessarv bv
congress it is suggested that experience

I he columned deliberate violation l,y
a large number of the prominent and in
fluential citizens of the territory of Utah
of thelawHot the United Slates for the
prosecution and punishment i f iV.Uga
iny merits the attention of every d7i.-?rt-nient
of the government. ThbUerr lory
has a population Millicient to entitle it to
admission as a state. This imuoruiit
change will not, however, tV?ni K?iS
by the country while the diiSnS'uV Utah
in very considerate numbers uphold 1
practice which is condemn T'cr mt
by the laws of all civilized commi.Ea
throughout the world. The C SS
Bnppression of the offense was enacted
with unanimity by Conres, mow thin
seventeen years ago, but has remained
antil recently, a dead letter In the terrl
torjr of Ulah. because of the peculiar dif
ficulties attending its enforcement. The
opinion widely prevailed among the citi-
rena of Utah that the law was in contra
vention with the constitutional pruaran
tee of religious freedom. This objection
Is now removed. The supreme court of
the United States has decided the law to
be within the legislative power of con
gress, binding as u rule ot action for all
who reside within the territories. There
is no longer any reason for delay or hesi
tation in its enforcement. It should be
lirmlv and effectively executed. If not
suilic'ietilly stringent in its provisions, it
should lie amended, and in aid or the
purpose in view I recommend that more
comprehensive and more searching meth
ods for preventing as well as punishing
this crime bo provided, if necessary to
secure obedience to the law, the enjoy
ments and exercise oi the rights of citi
zenship in the territories ot the United
States may be withheld or withdrawn
from those who oppose the enforcement
of the law on this subject.
'line iM.ia TioNS
of the past year, though occupied only
with state olliccs, have not failed to elicit
in the political discussions which attend
ed them all over the country new and de
cisive evidence of the deep interest which
the great body of citizens take in the pro
gress of the country towards a more gen
eral and complete establishment, at
whatever cost, of universal security and
freedom in the exercise of the elective
franchise. While many top:cs of politi
cal concern demand great attention irom
our people, both in the sphere of nation
al and state authority, 1 liud no reason
to qualify the opinion I expressed in my
last annual message, that no temporary
or administrative interests of govern
ment, however urgent or weighty, will
ever displace the zeal of our people in de
fense of the primary rights of citizenship
and that the power of public opinion will
override all political prejudices and all
sectional and state attachments. In de
manding that all over wide territory
the name and character of citizen of the
United Stales shall mean one and the
same thing and carry with them unchal
lenged security and respect. 1 earnestly
appeal to the intelligence and patriotism
of all good citizens of every part of the
country, however much they may be di
vided in opinions on other political sub
jects, to unite in compelling obedience
to existing laws, aimed at the protection
of the right of suffrage. I respectfully
urge upon congress to supply any delects
in these laws which experience has
shown and which it is within its power
to remedy. I again invoke the coopera
tion of the executive and legislative au
thorities of the states in this great pur
pose. I am fully convinced that if the
public mind can be sel at rest on this par
amount question of popular rights, no
serious obstacle will thwart or delay the
complete pacilication of the country or
retard the general diffusion of prosperity-
In a former message I invited the at
tention ot congress to the reformation of
TIIK CIVII. SKKV1CH
of the government, and expressed the in
tention o! transmitting to congress as
early as practicable a report upon this
subject by the chairman of the civil ser
vice commission. In view of the fac
that, during a considerable period, the
government of (Jreat linUin has been
dealing with administrative problems
and abuses, in various particulars analo
gous to those presented in this country,
and that in recent years the measures
adopted were understood to have been
effective mid in every respect highly sat
isfactory. 1 thought it desirable to have
fuller information upon the subject, and
accordingly requested the chairman
of the civil service commission to
make a thorough investigation for this
purpose. 1 lie result, lias neeii an eiauo
rate and comprehensive report. The re
port sets forth the history of the Partisan
spoil-svsteui in (ireat ltritain and id' the
rise and fall of the parliamentary patron
age and of oilicial interference with the
freedom of elections. It shows that af
ter long trials of various kinds of exami
nations, those which are competitive and
open on equal terms to all, and which are.
carried on under the superintendence of
a single commission, have with great ad
vantage been established as conditions
of admission to almost every oilicial
place in the subordinate administration
of that country and of Ib itish India. The
completion ot the report, owing to the
extent of the labor involved in its prepa
ration, ami the omission of congress to
make any provision either for the con
pensation or the expenses of the com
mission, has been postponed until the
present lime. It is herew ith transmitted
to congress. While the reform measures
of another government are of no author
ity to us, they are entitled to influence to
Hie extent to which their intrinsic wis
dom and their adaptations to our consti
tutions and social life mav commend
them to tuir consideration. The views 1
have heretofore expressed concerning
the defects and abuses in our civil ad
ministration remain unchanged, except
In so far as an enlarged experience has
deepened my sense of the duty lioth of
ollicers and of the people themselves to
cooperate for their removal. The grave
evils and perils of a partisan spoil system
of appointment to office and of the ollice
tenure are now generally recognized. In
the icsolutions of the great pai ties, in re
ports of departments, in the debates and
proceedings of congress, the messages of
executives, the gravity of the evils has
been pointed out and the need of their
reform has been admitted. To command
the necessary support, every measure of
reform must be based on common right
and justice, and must be compatible w ith
the healthy existence of great parties,
which are inevitable and essenti 1 in a
free state. When the people have ap
proved a policy at a national election
congress' confidence in the ollicers they
have selected and the advisers who, in
accordance with our political institutions,
should be consulted as to the policies
w hich it is their duty to carry into effect,
is unquestionable. It is eminently prop
er that they should explain it before the
people, as well as illustrate its spirit in
the performance of their duties. It hard
ly need be pointed out that very different
considerations apply to the greater num
ber ot those who lill the subordinate
places in the civil service. Their respon
sibility is to their superiors in oilicial po
sition. It is their duty to oliey the legal
instructions of those upon whom that
authority is devolved, and theirpublic ser
vice consists in the dischargeof their func
tions irrespective of pailisan politics.
Their duty is the same, whatever party
is in power, and whatever policy pre
vails. As a consequence, it follows that
their tenure of ollice should not depend
on the prevalence of any policy or the su
premacy of any party, but should be de
termined by their capacity to serve the
l;ople most usefully quite irrespective of
partisan interests.
The same considerations that should
govern the tenure should also prevail in
the apK)inlment, discipline ami removal
of these subordinates. The authority of
appointment and removal is not a perqui
site which may be used to aid a friend or
reward a partisan, but is a trust to be ex
ercised in the public interest under all the
sanctions which attend the obligations to
apply the public funds only for public
purposes. Every citizen lias an equal
right to the honor and prolit of entering
the public service of Ins country. The
only just ground of discrimination Is the
measure of character and capacity he has
to make that service most useful to the
people, except in cases where, upon just
and recognized principles, as upon the
theory of pensions, ollices and promotions
are bestowed as rewards for past services.
Their bestowal upon any theory which
disregards personal merit is an act of in
justice to the citizen as well as a breach
of that trust subject to which the appoint
ing power is held. In the light of these
principles it becomes of great importance
to provide just and adequate means, es
pecially for every department and large
administrative ollice where personal dis
crimination on the part of its bead is not
practicable for ascertaining those (jii.ili
lications to which appointments and re
movals should have reference. To fail
to provide such means is not only to d-ny
the opportunity of ascertaining facts up
on which the most righti s claims toof-
lice depend, but of necessity to discour
age all worthy asiiiiMuts 0y handing over
appointments ami removals to mere intln
ence and favoritism. If it is the right of
the worthiest claimant to gam the ap
pointment, and the interest of the people
to bestow it upon biin.it would seem clear
that a wise and just method of ascertain
ing personal litiicss for ollice must needs
be an important and permanent function
of every just and wise government. It
has long since become impossible . in the
great oriices, for those having the duty of
nomination ami appoint nl to person
ally examine into the individual qualifi
cations of more than a small proportion
of those seeking ollice, and with the en
largement of the civil service that pro
portion must continue to become less. In
the earlier years of the government the
subordinate ollices were so few in num
ber that it was quite easy for those mak
ing appointments and promotions to per
sonally ascertain the merits of the candi
dates. Party managers and methods had
not then become powen ui agems w co
ercion hostile to the free ami just exer
cise of the appointing power.
A large and responsible part ol the
duty of restoring the civil service to the
desired purity and clliciencv rests upon
the president; and it has been my pur
pose to do what is in my power to ad
vance such prudent and gradual incis
ures of reform as will most surely and
rapidly bring about that radical change
of system essential to make our adminis
trative methods satisfactory to a free and
intelligent people by a proper exercise of
authority. It is in the power of the ex
ecutive to do much to promote such a
reform, but it cannot be too clearly tin
derstood that nothing adequate can be
accomplished without co-operation on
the part of congress and considerate an I
intelligent support among the people.
Reforms which challenge the generally
accepted theories of parties ami demand
changes in the methods of departments
are not the work of a day. Their perma
nent foundation must be laid ill sound
principles and in an experience which
demonstrates their wisdom and exposes
the errors of their adversaries. Lvery
worthy olliccr desires to make bis oilicial
action an honor to bis country. Hut ti e
people themselves, far more than the.r
ollicers in public station, are interested
in ii pure, economical, and vigorous a:
ministration. Hy laws enacted in lsi!
and Hh, ami now in substance incorpo
rated in the revised statutes, the practice
of arbitrary appointments to the sevenl
subordinate grades in the great depart
ments was condemned, and examinatioi s
as to capacity, to be conducted by the
departmental boards of examiners, were
provided for and made conditions of ad
mission to the public service. Then?
statutes are a decision by congress that
examinations of some sort as to attain
ments and capacity are essential to the
well-being of the public service. Tht
important questions since the enactment
of these laws have been as to the charac
ter of these examinations, ami whether
oilicial lavor and partisan inilucnee or
common right and merit were to control
the access to the examinations. In prac
tice these examinations have not always
been open to worthy persons generally
who might wish to be examined. Oilicial
favoritism and partisan inllueiice. as a
rule, appear to have designated those
who alone were permitted to go before
the examining boards, subjecting even
the examiners to a pressure from the
friends of the candidates very dillicult to
resist. As a consequence, the standard
of admission fell below that which the
public interest demanded. It was almost
inevitable, that a system which provided
for various separate hoards of examiners,
with no common supervision or uniform
method of procedure, should result in
confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate
tests of capacity highly detrimental to
the public interest. A further and more
radical change w.is obviously required.
In the annual message of December,
1S70, my predecessor declared that 'there
is no duty which so much embarrasses
the executive and heads of departments
as that of appointments, nor is there any
such arduous and thankless labor imposed
on senators and representatives as that
of tiuding places for constituents. The
present system does not secure the best
men, and'often not even lit men, lor the
public places. The elevation and purti
cationof the civil service of the iovern
inent will be hailed with approval by the
whole people id' the United States."
Congress accordingly passed the act ap
proved March .'!. 171. "To regulate the
civil service of the United states, and
promote the elliciency thereof," giving
the necessary authority to the executive
to institute a civil service reform. Act
ing under this statute, which was inter
preted, as intended, to .secure a system of
just and practical examinations under
uniform supervision, a number of emi
nently competent persons were selected
for the purpose, who entered with zeal
upon the discharge of their duties, pre
pared, with an intelligent appreciation of
the requirements of the service, the reg
ulations contemplated, and took charge
of the examinations, and who, in their
capacity as a board, have been known as
TIIK CI VI1.-MCUV ll'IC COMMISSION.
Congress for two years appropriated the
money needed for the compensation and
for the expense of carrying on the work
of the commission. It appears from the
report of thecominission, siibmitte ! to
the president in April, Is7 1, that examin
ations had been held iii various sections
of the country, and ttiatau appropriation
of $J"i,ooo would be required to meet the
annual expenses, including salaries, in
volved in discharging the duties of the
commission. The report was transmitted
to congress by special message of April
is, 1S7I, with the following favorable
comment upon the labors of the commis
sion : "If sustained by congress, I have
no doubt the rules can. after the experi
ence gained, lie so improved and enforced
as to still more materially benclit the
public service, and relieve the executive,
members of congress, and the heads of
departments from iniluences prejudicial
to good administration. The rules, as
they have hitherto been enforced, have
resulted beneficially, as is shown by the
opinions of the meinliers ot the cabinet
and their subordinates in the depart
ments, and in that opinion I concur.''
And In the annual message of December
of the same year similar views are ex
pressed and an appropriation for contin
uing the work of the commission again
advised. The appropriation was not
made, and, as a consequence, the active
i. 41.1a n.irtmltiulnn wuq autitifinilftfl.

leaving the commission still in existence
without the means, therefore, of causing
(publications to he tested in any system
atic manner, of securing for the public
service the advantages of competition
upon any extensive plan. I recommend
ed in my annual niessagcjof December.
1H77, the making of an appropriation lor
the resumption of the work of the coin
mission. In the meantime, however,
competitive examinations, under many
embarrassments, have been conducted
within limited spheres m the executive
departments in Washington, and in a
number.of the custom houses and the
postollices of the principal cities ol the
country, with a view to further test, then
effects, and in every instance they have
been found to be as salutary as they have
heen staled to have been under t he ad
ministration of m v predecessor. I think
the economv, puriiv and elliciency of the
public service would be greatly promoted
bv their systematic ini roduct ion. wher
ever practicable, throughout the entire
civil service of the g ivel llllient, together
with ample provision for their general
supervision, in order to secure consist
ency and uniform justice.
Reports from the secretary of the inte
rior, from the postmaster general, from
the postmaster in the city of New York,
where such examinations have been for
some time on trial, and also from the
collector of the port, the naval olliccr
and the surveyor ol that city, and from
the post in islet s and collect' i s in several
of the large cities. show that the compet
itive system, where applied, has in va
rious ways contributed to improve tne
public service. The reports show that
the resu.ls have been salutary in a marked
degree, and that the general application
of similar rules cannot fail to be id' de
cided be fie lit to the s-rvice. The reports
of the government ollicers in the city of
New Yoik especially bear decided testi
mony to the utility of
OI'HX ( OMl'iniTIV K KXA Ml NATIONS
in their respective ollices, showing that
these examinations, and the excellent
qualifications of those admitted to the
service through them, have had a marked
incidental effect upon the persons previ
ously in the service, ami particularly on
those aspiring to promotion. There lias
been on the part of these latter an in
creased interest in the work, and desire
to extend acquaintance with it beyond a
particular desk, and thus the morale of
the entire force has been raised. The ex
aminations have been attended by many
citizens, who have had an opportunity to
thoroughly investigate the scope and
character of the tests, and the method of
determining the results, and these visit
ors have, witlio.it exception, approved
the modes employed, and several of them
have publicly attested their favorable
opinion upou such consideration.
1 deem it my duty to renew the recom
mendation contained in my annual mes
sage of December, 1S77, requesting con
gress to make the necessary appropria
tion for the resumption of the work of
the civil-service commission. Kconoiny
will be promoted by authorizing a moder
ate compensation to persons in the public
i.BrL'i'M u'lm mav tiei'form extra labor
upon or under the commission as the ex
ecutive may direct. 1 am convinced that
if a just ami definite lest of merit is en
forced for admission to the public ser
vice and in making promotions, such
abuses as removal without good cause
and partisan and oilicial interference
with the proper exercise of the appoint
ing power will in a large measure disap
pear. There are other administrative
abuses to which i he attention of congress
should be asked in thisconnectiou. Mere
partisan appointments an I the constant
peril of removal without cause very nat
urally lead to an absorbing and mischiev
ous political activity on the part of those
thus appointed, which not only interferes
with the discharge of oilicial duty, but is
incompatible with the freedom of elec
tions, not without warrant in the view of
several of my predecessors in the piesi
deiitial ollice directly in accordance with
the law of 1S7I, already cited. I endeav
ored, bv regulation made on the li-d of
.June, 1S77, to put some reasonable limits
to such abuses. It may not be easy, and
it may never, perhaps, be necessary, to
deline with precision the proper limit of
political action on the part of federal
ollicers. lint while their right to hold
and freely express their opinions cannot
be questioned, it is very plain that they
should neither be allowed to devote to
other subjects the time needed for the
proper discharge of their oilicial duties,
nor to use the authority of their ollice to
enforce their own opinions, or to coerce
tne political action of those who hold dif
ferent opinions. Reasons of justice and
public policy quite analogous to those
which forbid' the use of oilicial power for
the oppression wf the private citizen im
pose pipon the government, the duty of
protecting its otlice.isand agents from ar
bitrary exactions. In whatever aspect
considered ti c practice of making levies
for paity pui poses upon the salaries of
ollicers ishighlv demoralizing to the pub
lic sei vice and discreditable to the eouu
trv. Though an olliccr should be as free
as" any other citizen to give bis own mon
ey in'aid of his opinions orhisparty.be
should also be as tree as any other citi
zen to refuse to make such gills. If sal
aries arc but a fair compensation for the
time and labor of the ollicers. it is a gross
injustice to levy a tax upon them. If
they are made excessive in order that
they may bear the tax, the excess is an
indirect' robberv of the public funds. I
recommend, therefore, such a revision
and extension of the present statutes as
shall secure to those in every grade ot
oilicial life or public employment the pro
tection with which a great and enlight
ened nation shall regard those who are
faithful in its service.
KOKKKJN RELATIONS.
Our relations wLh foreign countries
have continued peaceful. With (ireat
Dritain, there are still unsettled questions,
growing out of the local laws of the mar
itime provinces, and the action of pro
vincial authorities, deemed to be in der
ogation of rights secured by treaty to
American llsherineii. The United States
minister to London has been instructed
to present a demand for f lOo.nai.ty, in
view of the damages received by Ameri
can citizens at Fortune Hay, on the nth
dav of January, LS7S. The subject has
been taken into consideration by the
Uritish government, and an early reply
is anticipated. Upon the completion of
the necessary preliminary examination,
the subject of our participation in the
provincial fisheries, as regulated by trea
ty, will at once be brought to the atten
tion of the Hritisli government, with a
view to an early and permanent settle
ment of the whole question, which was
onlv temporarily adjusted by the treaty
of Washington. F.fforts have been made
to obtain the removal of restrictions
found injurious to the exportation of cat
tle to the United Kingdom. Some cor
respondence has also occurred with re
gard to the rescue and saving of life and
property upon the lakes, which has result
ed m important modifications of the pre
vious regulations of the Dominion gov
ernment on the subject in the interest of
humanity and commerce. In accordance
with the joint resolution of the last ses
sion of congress, commissioners were ap
pointed to represent the United States at
the two international exhibitions in Aus
tralia, one of which is now in progress
ilnu amusements.
