NAPOLEON, 0., - - DEC. 7, 1882.
Thk Prohibitionists of .Ohio announce
their determination to make a strong
fight in the Legislature this winter, and
will accept nothing less than the submis
sion of an amendment for absolute pro
hibition of manufacture and sale.
The Ohio State Orange will hold a ses
sion in Mansfield, December 13, 13 and
14, and a most interesting meeting is an
ticipated. The Grange will be addressed
by various members of the State Board
of Agriculture, and from 800 to 1000
patrons of husbandry are expocted to be
in attendance.
Dorset, the big star-route thief, has

Hon. J". T. Updegkaff, Republican
Congressman-elect from the Seventeenth
Ohio district, died at his residence near
Steubenville on the 30th. He was treated
for Bnght's disease and the true ailment
was discovered by a post mortem to be
stone in the bladder.
The Republican party has arrogated to
itself all the learning and intelligence in
the land, and one of the curious things
of the recent election was the election of
the Democratic candidate for State Su
perintendent of Publio Instruction in
Illinois, where the republican party has
40,000 majority.
Governor-Elect Pattison, of Penn
sylvania, married very early a daughter
of Edwin A. Smith, of Philadelphia. His
wife is said to be a beautiful and accom
plished lady of winning manners, who
will preside over the Executive mansion
gracefully. Two children, a little boy
and girl, constitute the family.
The Toledo Blade is simply mistaken
when it states that D. B. Ainger was at
one time editor of the Democratic
Northwest. Ainger publishing a Dem
ocratic paper, and doing the party good,
is a little too too. While the Telegram
waggs its head in derision over the bloody
heads of Ainger, Parker and Henry, the
Blade is inclined to take them up tender
ly and caress them with soothing words.
We give the President's message to our
readers in supplement this week. The
message is about an average, and outside
of a rehash of the department reports
amounts to be little else. The President
reiterates some of his recommendations
and suggestions made a year ago, to
which a Republican Congress turned a
deaf ear, which no doubt has been one of
the chief causes of its overthrow by an
outraged people.
A Man was carrying a coon he bad
cought, when he met three little boys in
the road. All of them said excitedly,
"Mister give me that coon, give me that
coon,, give me that coon, mister." "Well,
boys, I'll tell you what I will do. If you
will tell me the party you belong to, and
why, I'll give it to the boy who gives the
best reason for his faith." "I'm a Repub
lican, because that party saved the
Union," said one. "I'm a Gieenbacker,
because that party is in favor of plenty of
money." When the time for the third
boy came, he said, "I'm a Democrat,
'cause I want the coon." New Orleans
Times. Last boy was right. The Demo
crats are going to have the coon, and you
can rely on it. Boston Post. They
caught the coon in twenty-three States.
Senator H. E. O'Haqan, of Erie, is
.dangerously ill with Brlght's disease of
the kidneys. His recovery is not proba
ble. Of late years this peculiar disease
has attacked men who are temperate in
the use of every thing but tobacco. Sena
tor O'Hagan never drank intoxicating
liquors, but he wa a great smoker.

Arthur has appointed Clayton Mc
Mitchael, editor of the Philadelphia Korth
American, as United States Marshal fur

thieves would prefer to fight their case
through the press rather than the courts.
They should be made to face a stern

Governor Cleveland, governor-elect
of New York, like Gov. Patti.-on, of
Pennsylvania, wants no display made at
his inauguration, burely, once in a
while sensible men do get to be Gover
nors of great States.
The Signal was most painfully silent
last week in regard to the removal of
friend Ainger as Postmaster of Washing
ton. Bro. Fouke should at least give his
approval or disapproval. He no doubt
will say something this week.
We direct attention to the Prospectus
for Harper & Brothers four publications
the Monthly, Weekly, Bazar and Young
People. Each stand at the head of all
similar publications, and all four have
become a household necessity which it
seems difficult to do without.
Congressmen-elect McAdoo, Fiedler
and Ferrell, of New Jersey, are young
men, their combined ages being less than
ninetv years. The three are Democrats,
they were members of tbe last New Jer
sey Legislature; they boarded at the
same house in Trenton, and they voted
together on all important measures.
There are 2,542 poetotBce in Ohio.

The new code, as far as it relates to
the observance of Sunday, was strictly
enforced by the police in New York City
last Sunday. All servile labor, except in
works of necessity or charity, will be
stopped. The running of railroads and
ferryboats and the delivery, of newspa
pers will not be interfered with, but driv
ing in the parka, and the keeping open of
saloons and stores, shows, etc., will have
to be suspended.
Very general regret is expressed by
the press of Ohio and Michigan over the
removal of Mr. D. B. Ainger as Postmas
ter at Washington, reflecting the popular
confidence in his personal and official in
tegrity, and the belief that he has been
the victim of circumstances in an un
wholesome atmosphere where the inno
cent too often suffer at the expense of
those who are the guilty parties. Sunday

"The Republican party is clearly in
danger of destruction," is the cry of
alarm from the Cincinnati Commercial.
Well, for the good of the country we
hope it is not only in danger, but that it
is doomed to distinction. The Commer
cial further says: "The Republicans
having been in power are held responsi
ble for the profligate expenditures of the
Government. The estimates submitted
by the heads of Departments for expen
ses in the coming year, are simply awful."
The Commercial is one of the leading Re
publican papers of the State.
No sooner is a Republican removed
from office, than he takes a boom for a
higher position. Ainger had scarcely
lft his warm nest in Washington, when
a Michigan paper proposed him as U. S.
Senator! Arthur, you know, was kicked
out of the revenue service in Hew York
by John Sherman as incompetent and
untrustworthy, and was immediately
nominated for Vice-President on the Re
publican ticket, and Guiteau's bullet
made him President. It's a queer way
these Republicans have.
Democratic papers arc gloating over tbe pros
pects of tuming every Republican out of the next
Congress who was elected by a small majority. The
fact that they have the power, overshadows all ques
tion of right in their eyes. Fan Wert Bulletin. .
That all originates in an addled brain.
No Democratic paper is gloating over any
such a thing, and the Bulletin cannot
point to an instance of the' kind., The
Republicans have made a precedent of
such things, but the Democrats will be
guided by the right and no Republican
honestly elected will be ousted from bis
seat. -
A cotemporary draws tbe attention of
its readers to the practice of persons stand
ing in the aisles or doors of a church
after the close of the services, talking
and shaking hands, thus preventing other
persons from getting out. The practice
is a very bad one indeed too much in
dulged in by our our own church going
people. People in leaving a church
should do so in a becoming manner, and
not block up the passage ways to the
great inconvenience, not to say annoy
ance, of others. If inquiry as to each
other's family is desirable let it be done
upon the outside; and if a lady wishes to
view the new bonnet' or cloak worn by
another let her go on the -outside, where
her view will not be obstructed, I

The stupidity of the Telegram, from
which the abore is clipped, is proverbial,
but we had supposed, violently perhaps.
that it k ifta hat constituted taxes, and
that tariff dutn-s were the most onerous
of any of ih- federal assessments. We
were mistaken and apologiZ" totheking
of rabbits. The Northwest demands a re
duction of taxes, to the full extent the
public service will permit, but we want
this reduction made "where it will do the
most good." If the publishers do not
wish to pay taxes on whisky and tobacco
lot them cease drinking and smoking,
Those who wear clothing, use sugar and
molasses, farm and work, cannot get
along without the use of materials now
excessively and unequally taxed to en
able the kid-gloved gentry to procure
their luxuries free nf duty. The dirt
throwu by the Telegram seems to mostly
blind itself.
Democrats who think everything from
now until 1884 will be plain sailing, are
laboring under a serious mistake, truth
fully says the Springfield Transcript,
Never before was there greater necessity
for caution, and a lack of it will prove
fatal. Democrats must not flatter them
selves that the causes which hare sent
the Republicans to the rear will operate
less thoroughly in their case. A neglect
of the interest of the people, and of the
rights of those by whose grace they have
received their power, will defeat them
and do it so thoroughly that there will be
no need of "eight to seven" commissions
to decide the result. On the other hand,
there is no doubt that the game is in our
hands, ana if our representatives in Con
gress do their whole duty, our rooster
will crow over the defunct remains of
the buzzard for many years to come, and
the opposition will once more go in
search of a name under which to rally
their scattered forces.
A terrible accident happened in Cin
cinnati at the Coliseum Theater on
Thanksgiving day. Frank Frayne and
his company were pepforraing their play
of "Si Slocum," a border drama, in which
Frayne gives exhibitions of his rifle shoot
ing. The piece proceeded smoothly until
tbe fourth act, in which he undertook to
shoot an apple from the head of Miss
Von Behren, who took the part of "Lucy
Slocum." This was successfully accom
plished in the ordinary way, the marks
man facing the young woman. Then he
undertook the more difficult feat of
shooting the apple with his back towards
Miss Von Behren. This is a feat that
Franye has successfully performed for
many years, holding the rifle over his
shoulder, and taking aim by means of a
small mirror, fastened to the stock of his
gun. He used a Stevens rifle, 23 calibre.
The catch cnap of the rifle was imperfect
and slipped just as the hammer fell, the
bullet striking Miss Von Behren in tbe
head. She sank to the floor and died
within fifteen minutes. ' Frayne was
almost frantic with grief, and it was re
ported that he was to have been married
to the young lady in a few das. He
gave himself up to the authorities. There
is a law of Ohio which makes it an of
fense punishable with fine and imprison
ment for any one to point a gun or pistol
at another, whether the weapon be loaded
or unloaded. Frayne has been acquitted
of any intentional injury.
The Sixteenth district is in a Congress
ional turmoil again, occasioned by tbe
death of Congressman Updegraff, which
necessitates a new election. The Colum
bus Dispatch, speaking upon the subject
says that "gentlemen who are conver
sant with political feeling in the district,
say that the people are decidedly averse
to going into another political fight at
this time, and would prefer that the
election be put off as long as possible. An
impression prevails in the minds of some
that no election need be held until the
regular October election next year, as
the next (the 48th) Congress does not as
semble until the first Monday in Decem
ber, 1883, and that would give the mem
ber-elect ample time to be in at the
meeting ot Congress. This, however,
does not take into account the election of
a person to fill the unexpired term of
Mr. Updegraff in the present Congress,
The term ends on the 4th of March next,
and the time being comparatively short,
it was deemed hardly necessary to fill it.
The Secretary of State, however, holds
that, no matter what the feeling of the
people may be as to an election at this
time, there being a vacancy, the spirit if
not the letter of the law requires that
they be given an opportunity to fill it at
the earliest possible date. Therefore, an
election must be held to fill the unex
pired term and also the full term. These
may perhaps be held at one and the same
time, and the same man may be voted
for, for both terms; these are quotations
to be determined on a closer examination
of the law; but the two vacancies must
be filled as early as possible.
The Revised Statutes of Ohio make it
the duty of the Governor, upon satisfac
tory evidence of a vacancy in the office
of Congressman, to issue a writ for a
special election to fill the vacancy, on a
day to be named in the writ, but no time
is specified within which the Governor
shall do this. The Sheriff of each county
is required to issue his proclamation
within ten days of any special election
and within fifteen days of a general elec
tion. The district is about 8,000 Repub
lican, although Mr. Updegraff had only
900 majority last fall. Let the Demo
crats nominate a good man and he may
be elected.

Sunday morning.
of Canterbury died
The Labor Congress met at Cleveland
last week, and the platform of principles
adopted'was the same as last year, minus
the tariff plank, and the addition of a
paragraph favoring the enactment of a
law making employers liable for acci
dent to their workmen:
The platform insists on the passage of
federal and State laws for the incorpora
tion of labor organizations, and favors
compulsory education of children, calls
for laws forbidding the employment of
children under fourteen years, demands
uniform apprentice laws, calls for the
enforcement of the national eight hour
law, denounces convict labor, asks that
the order or truck system of payment be
prohibited by law, favors making wages
first lien upon property, demands the re
peal of so-called conspiracy laws, asks for
a national Dureau or. labor statistics, cans
for the prevention of importation of
foreign labors under contract, and rec
ommends trades' organizations to secure
prompt representation in all law-making
bodies.
The Indianapolis Sentinel says:
"It is quite possible too much is ex
pected of the Forty-eighth Congress by
the people. Tbe Lower House will be
largely Democratic. It can map out a
policy. It can give unmistakable evi
dence that the Democratic party is in
favor of substantial reforms, and that
the people have made no mistake by be
stowing upon the Democratic party the
largest possible measure of confidence.
But it must be remembered that the
Democratic party, because it is in the
majority in tho House of Repaesenta
tives. is not, therefore, able to nass such
laws as the country imperatively de
mands.
