Scraps and .facts.
? Mrs. Iva Berry, an insane woman,
caused a stampede in a coach of a
'Frisco railroad train, near the town
Glrard, Kansas, last Friday by firing
a number of pistol shots at random,
After she had cleared the coach ol
passengers and officials, she barricaded
herself in the coach, and resisted
the efforts of the police of the
town to arrest her, until noon Wednesday.
when she was partially overcome
by the fumes of ammonia, from
a bundle of rags saturated with the
ammonia pushed into the coach
through a window. Mrs. Berry was
almost starved, and uterly exhausted
when taken out, and she was removed
to a hospital. She is the widow ol
Capt. Alga Berry, of the United States
army, who committed suicide a few
week ago at Vancouver Barracks,
Washington.
? Senator Tillman on Wednesday,
introduced two resolutions which ar?
intended to bring out the facts as
to whether any of the national banks
of the country have made campaign
contributions in recent years. The
first of the resolutions directs the secretary
of the treasury to report to
the senate whether any of the reports
of the examiners of national
banks made since 1893 have been
destroyed and whether such reports
as are on file show that contributions
have been made by the banks to campaign
committees. The other resolution
directs the sen&te committee on
privileges and elections to inquire Into
the same subject. Mr. Tillman asked
for present consideration of the first
resolution but under objection from
Senators Gallinger and Lodge it went
over until tomorrow. The other resolution
was referred to the cotiim! te?
on privileges and elections.
? Thomas P. Wickes, a prominent
attorney and former assistant corporation
counsel for New York city, was
found guilty of blackmail last Wednesday,
and remanded for sentence
next week. The case of Wickes is
one of the most peculiar in the criminal
annals of the city, and the man
himself has come to be known as
the "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde" of
the legal profession. While occupying
a prominent place among his fellows
in the legal profession and enjoying
a high reputation, it has been learned
that under the name of "Lewis Jarvis,"
which he assumed for the purpose,
Wickes wrote hundreds of letters
to persons who were interested
in cases with which he was connected.
To Dr. Edward Weston of
Newark, N. J., several of these "Lewis
Jarvls" letters were written advising
Dr. Weston to settle a certain litlga
tton against himself by paying several
thousand dollars. Wlckes was arrested
when he went to the postofflce
for letters addressed to "Lewis Jarvis."
*
? Unanimous consent was given last
Wednesday in the house for consideration
of a bill appropriating $16,500,000
for the Panama canal. Mr.
Williams claims that there should
have been an Itemized account of the
expenditures. Mr. Hepburn made a
general speech on the canal and the
progress of the work. Answering
questions as to canal salaries, Mr.
Hepburn said that he could make
the general statement that there were
twenty-six salaries over $5,000, six
between $4,000 and $5,000, flfty-flve
between $3,000 and $4,000 and 136
between $2,000 and $3,000. These include
engineers of high skill. Mr.
Fitzgerald, of New York, said that
he had been informed that $10,000
' a year was being paid to a press
agent, but Mr., Hepburn said that he
knew nothing of that report. Mr.
Williams decdared that the canal is a
nonpartisan undertaking and said
that no one could claim credit for
it. He intends to offer an amendment
to reduce the sum of $16,500,000
to the amount actually necessary
to carry on the work to January 1
next. Mr. Williams said that he
would object to the issuance of bonds
as long as there was $40,000,000 on
deposit in the national banks without
interest.
? Washington. December 6: Representative
John Sharp Williams of Mis
sissippi, iti till euuri IU iiiaiiiiam an
opposition Democracy as well as an
administration Democracy has laid
out a general plan of campaign. Mr.
Williams galloped straight into the
tariff question by introducing a bill
for the establishment of a minimum
tariff, amounting to 80 per cent, of
the present schedules, which shall constitute
the maximum tariff. The minimum
schedules will be applied to all
countries which grant the advantage
of their minimum tariff to the United
States. The maximum tariff will apply
to those which do not. Mr. Williams
selected 20 per cent, as the
extent of reduction as a concession
to Republican opinion. He had heard
Senator Dolliver declare that the
Dingley schedules had purposely been
made 20 per cent, too high, so as
to allow a reduction of one-fifth for
thej>lay of reciprocal trade relations.
This bill is a virtual invitation to
the Republican revisionists to join
hands with the Democrats, as in a
house resolution today introduced by
Mr. Williams asking the president to
reconvene the joint high commission
for the purpose of obtaining freer
trade relations with the United States
and Canada.
? The twenty-four national banks
of South Carolina, according to a
Washington dispatch, make as good
a showing as those from any state in
the country under the last call oi
the comptroller of the currency, sent
out November 10. These banks show
total resources at the time of the
report of $21,900,786, as against $19.681,890
at the same time one year
ago. The total loans and discounts
of the banks was $11,248,066, while
at the same time one year ago the
twenty-three banks then in existence,
one having been organized in the last
year, had loans and discounts
amounting to $10,404,249. The total
capital stock of the banks is now
$2,933,000, against $2,938,000 a year
ago. The surplus funds of the banks
have increased in a year from $754,996
to $796,204 at this time and the undivided
profits are now $917 384 against
$484,769 one year ago. The twenty

as the figures show from deposits.
The individual deposits at this time
aggregate $11,663,485 as against $9,541,316
one year ago. This is ovei
$2,000,000, In one year.
? Fall River, Mass.. Dec. 5: The
local cotton manufacturers express
themselves as greatly dissatisfied with
the government's system of issuing
cotton reports and some of them are
asking that action be taken by the
manufacturers of New England looking
toward its abolishment. It was
pointed out here today that one ol
the largest firms of cotton brokers in
the country, with headquarters al
Philadelphia, has been asking its customers
to sign petitions to the government,
looking toward the same
end. One of the mill officials said
today: "The immediate effect of the
report in this manufacturing centre
has been to reduce the wage margin
6 per cent., to stifle the demand fot
cloth and to upset the calculations ol
mill men who have been trying to
buy cotton from southern planters al
some fixed price. Telegrams received
froun the south today show that planters
are relying on the accuracy ol
the government report to such an extent
that they will not offer theii
Sroduct below the speculative figures
xed on the New York exchange and
tn most instances, they say that they
do not care to accept orders at th?
top prices, for the present at least."
|t is understood that the manufacturers
object to the publication of incomplete
reports based upon estimates.

of the country have sent Presidenl
Roosevelt a petition protesting
against the free distribution of seeds
by members of congress. The signers
present a number of arguments tc
show the injustice of the present
practice, and one of the most forcible
is that it is a grievous "restraint
of trade." a class legislation seriously
affecting an old established
branch of commerce. The subscribers
to the petition say that "it Is
not fair for congress to single out
one line of business, as it has dont
for years, and continue, on a constantly
developing scale, to interfert
with all the seed merchants of tht
United States, discouraging their bus
Iness by the free distribution of Jus
what they have for sale." The mer
chants further say that 40,000,000 dis
tlnct packages of seed are distribute!
every year, and that the practice' i
1 without precedent. The petition say
^ that the United States should abolisl
' the practice as unfair, as a clas

a branch of commerce, unbecomini
a great government. The origina
intention of the act authorizing fre

people of South Carolina??Columbii
State.
Lest our contemporary may have for
1 gotten, it should be reminded that the
"manifest sentimeat" of the people o
i South Carolina has been more or les
severely Jolted on the biennial session
question.
The supreme court on yesterday is
| sued an order directing that J. S
Farnum, the recalcitrant Charlestoi
dispenser, produce the papers tha
were demanded of him by the dis
pensary investigating committee. A
to whether these papers can now bi
produced is more or less doubtful. I
is possible that some of the more Ira
portant of them have been destroyed
But If the dispensary Investlgatlnf
committee Is able to get the paper
as they were originally, their publica
tion will be interesting. The papers
according to the decree of the cour
must be forthcoming by December 11
It Is a matter of sincere regret t<
note that in his forthcoming report t<
the general assembly Superintenden
of Education Martin will make anothe:
unfriendly recommendation as to tin
Citadel Academy. He wants to con
solldate the institution with the Soutl
Carolina college which, of course, wil
mean the passing of the Citadel with
out materially improving the college
The Citadel not only has a record tha
reflects honor upon the state; but i
is doing as good work now as it haj
ever done, if not a little better and i
cannot be abolished without seriou:
hurt.
While the president's message indl
cates quite a come down on the rail
road rate question, there is no occasioi
for especial surprise. The country wa
very well prepared for it. Mr. Roose
velt has all along shown a remarkabl
aptness in the discovery of abuses an<
has not been slow, with flourish o
trumpets, to point out needed reforms
but the general result has been th
same in all cases. He would raise i
big* hullabaloo give out the impressioi
that he would straighten things out a
the risk of his neck, and then accep
the situation as a matter of course, onl;
to break out in a new place later or
He has succeeded in raising the expec
tations of the people pretty high mor
than once; but now they are gettini
used to it. His present views on the rat<
question as set iortn in nis messag
leave room for the surmise that th
J party leaders may have gotten hln
i around all right; but it is a question a

It is quite probable that the preslden

BLOWN UP BY DYNAMITE.
Brown Johnson, colored, is dead, and
Alec Stewart, also colored, is prostrated
from shock as the result of an unexpected
explosion of dynamite near Clover
yesterday morning.
The men were In the employ of the
Catawba Power company and were at
work on the pole line from the power
house to Clover, their particular business
being the digging of post holes.
Owing to the nature of the country
In the vicinity of Clover, much of the
surface being overlaid with granite,
post holes can be sunk only by means
of blasting and the negroes were using
dynamite.
When the pole line crowd went to
work yesterday morning, they found
the dynamite hard from cold as it had
been during several mornings previous
and following the usual custom, under
such circumstances, they built a lire
to thaw It out.
Assisted by Stewart, who was near
by, Johnson sat on a box of dynamite,
containing 25 pounds or more and was
employing himself priming the cartridges
with caps and fuses. One of the
cartridges that had been placed too
near the Are, blazed up, and thinking
to extinguish the flame, Johnson took
it in his hand and rubbed the blazing
end on the ground. This ends t^s story
so far as the recollection of the two
participants are concerned.
'.There was a terrific explosion that
shook the earth in the immediate vicinity
and Jarred the houses for miles
around. Both Johnson and Stewart
were hurled from twenty to thirty feet
from the fire, and when other members
of the pole line gang arrived on
the spot both were apparently dead.
Johnson's legs were broken and he
was bleeding from the nose and mouth.
Stewart was also bleeding and was
bruised and ' burned about the head.
Both -were removed to Clover and made
as comfortable as possible. Johnson's
legs were amputated at dnce, and he
died during the afternoon. Stewart recovered
consciousness after a time and
Is now getting along very nicely. He
is apparently out of danger.
Both Johnson and Stewart were from
Chester.. Johnson's body was taken
down on the train last night, and Stewart
will be sent to his home as soon
as me uociors cuumuer ins muuvu
advisable provided he desires to go.

ENFORCEMENT OF PROHIBITION.
Pursuant to Instructions from the
state committee of the Law and Order
League, Mr. Sam M. Grist, secretary of
the organization In York county, has
been writing to the mayors of the various
Incorporated towns of the county
that maintain police forces to find out
their sentiments as to the enforcement
of the dispensary law and get Information
as to what they are doing along
that line.
Up to this time letters have been
mailed to the mayors of Rock Hill,
Yorkvllle, Clover and Fort Mill, and
these letters among: other things ask E
the following questions: Y
Is It your policy to deal with violators d
of the dispensary law as you do with ?
violators of the other laws of your city? u
Have you Instructed your police force
to give especial attention to the en- a
forcement of the dispensary law and
if so, Is the force In your opinion, fully
discharging Its duty? al
Do you consider the constituted offl- ol
cers of the law in York county, includ- a,
Ing the sheriff and his deputy, the magistrates
and their constables, the mayors
of the various towns and their po- ?
lice forces, competent to enforce the t<
dispensary law as well as others, with- w
out outside assistance? .
Mayor W. T. Beamguard of Clover ^
wnito aa iuiiuws.
Mr. Sam M. Grist,
Sec. of Law and Order League. ?
. Dear Sir: Replying to yours of the t?
29th, I beg to say that as mayor of b
the town of Clover, S. C? I am under
oath to fairly and Impartially enforce p
all the laws of said town. This oath I w
hold sacred. We have an ordinance b
against the sale of all Intoxicating bev- lf
erages and of all substitutes therefor.
In view of this ordinance I think it un- n
necessary to answer your first ques- q
tlon. The police have been fully instructed
with regard to the enforcement
of this ordinance and I consider P
them competent and efficient. I think l,
the regularly constituted officers of G
the county are able to enforce the dispensary
law, and I have enough faith 8
In them to believe that they will do ii
their duty. I see no necessity for the ^
levying of an extra half mill tax; but
at the Rame time I will remark that the
United States army could not enforce I'
the dispensary law unless it was back- a
ed by the sentiment of the people. j
W. T. Beamguakd.
Mayor John T. Roddey of Rock Hill,
writes as follows:
Mr. Sam M. Grist,
Yorkville, S. C. P
Dear Sir: I am in receipt of your b
favor of the 29th of November. There p
are two laws which I am determined, to
the best of my ability, to carry out in 11
Rock Hill, and I shall use every effort ?
and all my energy to see that they are 0
carried out.
The first and most important of all
things necessary to the welfare of the n
state in having carried out, is the law p
relative to the carrying of concealed ^
weapons, and the next Is the full enforcement
of the dispensary law. ?
I consider our police force here as be- ti
lng exceptionally strong in carrying out t]
their duties. In fact they are very
alert, and law breakers are becoming
? J 3 -J ikL n
more ana more convinceu ui wits I
shall like for you to mention to a
your Law and Order League that we j,
should get together more and more and
come down stronger and stronger on 8
concealed weapons. While it Is not n
looked upon by our people with as p;
much Importance as It might be the
neople of the outside world consider
that the lives of our citizens are not a
ironerlv protected. p
You may rest assured that the dls- 0
^tsary Ipw will be looked Into In Rock
Hill as already evidence can be seen 1
of the shrinkage of the amount of liquor
sold unlawfully.
As regards my considering the constituted
officers of the law In York ?
county competent. I am of the convlc- t
Mon that It Is only a matter of the en- ^
thuslasm and the real feelings of the
peonle. as to whether or not they really 11
wish the l&ws carried out. (
Yours very truly, t
John T. Roddey, Mayor. r

evelopment proper. The total cost of
he present work is estimated at beivcen
$1,600,000 and $2,000,000. Peraps
two years will be required to comlete
it. Then 40,000-horse power will

'hs U. 8. Court Houss Question.
The following in the Columbia State
f this morning, gives the United
Itates court house situation as seen by
he State's Washington correspondent:
'he South Carolina delegation in the
louse of representatives held a cau:us
this morning and agreed upon a
>111 for a new Federal district. Repesentatlve
Johnston was delegated to
Iraft and Introduce a bill for the
western Federal district, with Federal
ourt houses af Greenville, Greenwood,
Spartanburg and Rock Hill. This Is
iractlcally the same bill that passed the
louse last yeax aft^j* the amendment
tutting in Greenwood. Senator Latiner
has Introduced in the senate the
ame bill that passed the senate, puting
the Federal court house at Cheser.
If both bills pass a conference will
tave to be held and the situation will
ie the same as last spring, when the
louse would not yield Rock Hill and
he senate would not^leld Chester,
'he South Carolina delegation all were
billing: to put in both places, but Sen,tor
Nelson, chairman of the senate
ommlttee, would not consent to that
.nd said that rather than have any
:hlld's play the whole business would
lave to be killed, and It was killed.
The seven representatives in the cauus
today were harmonious and unanlnous.
Mr. Flnley says they were that
vay last year and that the South Carolina
papers exaggerated the dlsagreenents
and dissensions among them,
lenator Latimer when seen tonight said
hat since he had come up here this
ime he has had over 20 letters from
epresentative men of Chester requestng
that Chester be put In the bill for
l court house. Asked If he had had
iny letters from Rock Hill, he said:
Not one." Asked if he had any preerence
for Chester, he replied: "Yes,
?r I would not have put Chester in the
>111, but of course, if Mr. Flnley preers
Rock Hill I shall not raise any
ibjectlons. It will be up to him to de:ide
between Chester and Rock Hill."
? At Macon, Ga., last Wednesday, a
ury acquitted Mrs. Maggie Young of
laving fraudulently Impersonated Mrs.
ifary Hlnson In taking out a policy for
6,000 In the New York Life. It seems
hat about the time the transaction
k'aa on, a Mrs. Mary Jane Goss, who
^as an Inmate of a charitable lnstituion
died. She was an aunt of Mrs.
foung, and was taken to Mrs. Young's
louse a few days before her death,
ifter her death It developed that her
Ife was Insured for $6,000 and the
noney would go to Mrs. Young. It
ras whispered that as a matter of
act Mrs. Young had Impersonated
Irs. Goss at the examination, and had
iaid the original premium herself,
'he New York Life man, who had Just
ssued a policy on Mrs. Hlnson began
o Investigate and became satisfied
hat as Mrs. Hlnson could not possibly
iave passed an examination, Mrs.
roung was operating In her case. He
vent to Mrs. Young, accused her and
endered back the $100 premium that
iad been paid. Mrs. Young denied
hat she had had anything to do with
he matter and refused to take the
noney. At the prosecution, both the
gent and examining physician swore
hat Mrs. Young was the woman who
iad passed the examination. The Jury,
owever, refused to find a verdict to
hat effect. It Is thought that the verlct
of the Jury may have been influnced
by the bad odor of the New
rork Life. Both the agent and the
ihyslclan having sworn that the $100
elonged to Mrs. Young and she havng
sworn to the contrary, the ownerhip
of the money continues a puzzle.
? Bennettsvllle special of December
to Columbia State: The smallpox
pidemic is creating some anxiety,
lot to say alarm In some sections of
he county, and vaccination Is almost
inlversal. A few days ago Mr. James
IcDanlel died from the effects of
mallpox. A few days earlier a negro
iy name of Moses Long also succumbd
to the loathsome disease. Several
ases now prevail In that neighborlood;
there has been no quarantine
r compulsory vaccination. Mr. Mc)anlel
was a prominent farmer, ownr
of a public mill and ginnery and
ontracted the disease by ginning
ome cotton on which a negro had
een sleeping who had the disease,
without the knowledge of Mr. McDanel.
His head and body swelled ablormally
and friends and neighbors
f course could not Jeopardize the
Ives of their families, as well as their
wn, by rushing into the dreaded dlsase.

with the party did not return as It Is
his intention to seek his fortune in the

of the party and will return In a
short time. .
Mr. William Cooper of Williamsburg

The local lodge of the Fraternal
Union of America held its annual banquet
at McElwee's restaurant Wednesday
evening. A large number sat
down to an excellent supper and the
evening was ope of unmarred pleas- .
ure. This order Is quite strong here.
Oakland Lodge No. 45 K. of P. celebrated
her fourteenth anniversary
Thursday evening In a very pleasant
manner. About seventy of the Lodge's
regulars, Irregulars and "oyster nlght??"
ottondprf the convocation In the
Castle Hall where the Esquire rank
was very thoroughly exemplified upon ,
a timid young page striving to surmount
the difficulties between himself
ind the golden.spurs. After the work
the members .repaired to McElwee's
cafe' and there sat down to a most
bountiful and delightful menu of
oysters cocktails, turkey and cranberry
sauce, chicken salad, celery and
olives, coffee, whipped cream and bananas.
Mr. John Wood acted as toastmaster,
and when cigars had been
lighted he read telegrams from
Messrs. Samuel McFadden and Thos.
F. McDow, of the Chester and Torkville
bars respectively, stating their
inability to attend. Mr. McFadden
had "the grip" and strange to say
this fact instead of admitting him kept
him away. The banqueters were fortunate
In havthg with them, however,
Past Grand Chancellor, W. M. Lories
of North Carolina, who responded to
the call and gave out some good Pythian
doctrine. Mr. J. B. Johnson also
spoke. The Rev. Walter B. Duncan
of this city was called upon to make
the closing speech which he did by
handing out a regular banquet of
fresh and witty jokes leaving, as was
predicted by the toast master a good
taste In the mouth. He told a good
one on Judge Prince and a friend of
his, who, while making a canvass
for senator and representative respectively,
were called upon by their
rdous host for the night to Join
In the family, devotions and repeat
a passage of scripture. The future
judge on the spur of the moment
said: "Jesus wept" while the candidate
for legislative honors corroborated
the statement with a hearty and
fervent: "He- shore did." The Pythian
Lodge here Is made up of the
flower of the city and Is in a flourishing
condition. Mr. Herbert L.
Dlehl Is the present chancellor commander.
At the next meeting officers
will be elected for the coming year.
Looks For More War.?A dispatch,
to the Chicago Chronicle from Los Angeles
says that at a public reception in *
his honor Wednesday night, Lieut Gen.
and Chief of Staff Adna R. Chaffee, of
the United States army, predicted
that the United States will again go to
war.
This prediction was maae in emu.
Chaffee's address regarding the work
of the army. He
said: "Gentlemen, war will come
again. There are plenty of men In this
room, who will see our country at war
again. Not on our own soil, perhaps.
You must remember that we have now
become one of the nations of the earth.
We have great interests to defend.
"When that war comes we must be
intelligently prepared for it Modern
war is not what war used to be. No
one is now fitted to command troops
who is not a scientific and well trained . man.
Modem war must be scientifically
treated to save human life.
"The Japanese are military people,
but we are not We do not get on
with military preparation as they do,
but we should be ready for a conflict."
Tillman Thought So.?When he
learned of the decision of the United
States supreme court to the effect that
the South Carolina dispensary is subject
to taxation the same as an individual.
Senator B. R. Tillman is quoted
as saying:
"Why, of course, they had to decide
that way, else the whole system of internal
revenue from Dan to Beer-sheba
would be knocked into a cocked bat.
All South Carolina or any other state
would have to do would be to start up
its own distilleries and not pay a cent
of revenue taxes. But in making this
decision the supreme court reverses a
half a dozen or more of Its former
decisions. When Mackey first proposed
this thing to me some years ago
and asked me to recommend the suit
to Gov. McSweeney. I would not do it
until I had looked carefully into the
decisions of the supreme court, but I
did this and found that In every case,
from John Marshall down to the present.
the decisions were in accord with
Mackey's ideas that the state, not being
a person, was not subject to internal
revenue laws. But I told Mackey
at the time that the supreme court
would wriggle out of it somehow. They
would not allow the whole revenue
business to be knocked up. Yet I
wrote the letter to McSweeney, recommending
it. It could do no harm to
try it and throw it up to them to decide."
? The state of South Carolina against
F. P. Mllburn and others, architects of
the state house, which occupied ten
days of the time of the Richland court
fell through on Wednesday with a mistrial.
The state house commission was
suing Mllburn for damages caused by
Kio all^iraH failure to rive the atata
what It had paid for. The newspapers
have it that eight of the Jurors wanted
to make Mllburn pay $65,000 damages;
one wanted to make him pay $50,000,
and three others thought he should not
be made to pay anything. There is a
lot of feeling Involved in the case
and it has already cost Richland county
a great deal of money.
