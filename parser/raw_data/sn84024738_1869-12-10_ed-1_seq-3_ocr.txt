WASHINGTON NEWS.
Coi respondent of the Richmond Dispatch.
Washington, December S, I860,
t'ho measure of Senator Stewart, of JS>
a, for general amnesty, and the bill
offered to-aaj by Senator Ferry for a repeal
th, tost-oath, were both talked over ves
tcrday in caucus, and it was found that tHose
attendence were about equally divided
regard to the more just turn which
qewa'vt and Ferry arc disposed to take. It
to be seen, however, that there are
Kadicftls opposo " letting up " on the South
ireAUse they fear it will lose the States to
Republican party.
Tnunbuir* proposition that members of
t oncress be not allowed, except in certain
...... to sohct appointments to office, or to
Commend persons for official appoint
meats, will not go through. This particu
lar prerogative of members of Congress is
' ? to be dispensed with, and Senator
Trumbull will not lind a responsive echo to
I . .elf-denying principles.
The various propositions concerning the
,? ho of Georgia are to be carefully cou
riered by their respective originators and
. : -, rged into one bill, which will soon be
? > .fled from the Judicary Committee.
fberc is considerable discussion among
Republican senators in regard to the effect
jhe adoption of the fifteenth amendment
w ill have in the construction of the four
teenth. recently adopted. The fourteenth,
it will be recollected, gives the States the
: lit to resulate suffrage, but provides that
It any portion of the population is excluded
from the right of suffrage that that class
.ball be deducted from the number entitled
to representation. In other words, the
number of members in Congress to which
s Mate shall be entitled shall be based upon
tht number of the class entitled to vote by
the laws of the State. The fifteenth amend
ment confers the right of franchise upon
ail races and colors regardless of State laws;
.!. 1 in this respect is in direct opposition to
the fourteenth amendment, already adopt
The qustion is, Can a portion of the
t institution be repealed by tlie adoption of
:;n amendment ? Some very able men think
net. At any rate, it seems to be conceded
th it the fifteenth amendment, if it can re
: 7/. repeals the whole fourteenth amend
ment, and with it the disability clause,
which has rendered rt so onerous and ob
jectionable. Timox.
[Not so. It repeals only so much as is
inconsistent with itself.]
The Supreme Court and Legal-Tenders.
A \\ :i>hiBgton correspondent of the New
York Journal of Commerce now again states
:h it. notwithstanding positive assurances to
! he contrary, reiterated time and again,there
are the best grounds for belief that the Sib
prime Court of the United states has de
c! .ed the legal-tender act unconstitutional.
He adds: " Men of prominence who in
clined to this belief previously, have, since
the reading of the President's message, been
convinced.*' "What does that return to
-pecie payments mean?" asks one. "Sim
ple that t he legal-tender act is unconstitu
tional, and the Supreme Court has forced
the recommendation," was the answer.
'? Let them decide as we know they will
decide, and where will we be ? " These re
marks occurred among the congressional
linanciers of the Republican persuasion, and
have ca-t a gloom over those who have pet
theories to advance. These theories are nu
merous, and it i< added that a careful can
v. in both Houses shows that the upper
mo.-t theme now is the finances.
Uniformity in Electing Members of
Congress.? The Washington correspondent
of the New York Herald, in his dispatches
on Tuesday, says :
?? The Committee of Elections have agreed
upon a bill which provides that the day for
holding elections for members of Congress
-hail be uniform throughout all the States.
As it will require some change in the laws
oi several of the States to conform to this
ai t, the bill provides that it shall not take
effect until the first Tuesday in November,
l>72. The bill has two objects?first, to in
sure a full representation of all the States at
the organization of each new Congress on
the 4th of March; and second, to prevent
persons from one State going into another
to colonize. It is thought that having the
oiurres-ional elections going on in all the
Mate- on the same day, every district will
tind enough to do at home without going to
help their neighbors.''
A hill embodying the recommendations of
N-civtary Bout well for the appointment of
a chief comptroller and commissioner of
customs revenue is being prepared, and
w ill shortly be presented to Congress for its
? on-ideration. A bill- providing for the re
crguuizaf ion of the Internal Revenue Bu
reau is also being prepared for the same
purpose.
There have been twenty-five counterfeit
coupons of the ten-forty boiicis of March 1st,
1mA, paid in at the Treasury Department.
A plate of this denomination was stolen,
and a careful examination of the coupons
paid shows that the numbers were not oulv
duplicates, but triplicates and quadrupli
cates. .Since the discovery was made, the
greatest care has been exercised by the
Treasury officials, and the fraud checked.
It is clever in the President, and flatter
ing to the people, to open his budget on
foreign affairs with the vivid and original
observation that " the United States is the
freest of all nations.'' Hence, we sympa
thise with all people " struggling for liberty
and self-government." The circumstance
that several shier and sovereign southern
state- struggled awhile for self-government
and liberty to wallop their own niggers is!
not referred to in the message in this con
nection.? Cincinnati Commercial (Republi

There is reason for believing that Con
gress will no* change the tax on whiskey
r. >r the manner for collecting the same.
The commissioner of internal revenue re
commended in his report a fair trial of the
present law, and so far it. gives perfect satis
faction to the distiller.-, and the only parties
interested in modifying the law are specula
tors in spirits or "those who wish to evade
payment of the tax.

Affairs in Virginia?Report of Gene
ral C'anby.?General Canby's report for
Virginia embodies statements relative to the
recent elections, asks the additional appro
priation for reconstruction purposes of I
^65,000, and has the following of general in
terest :
One of the most important duties de
volving on the district commander, after 1
assumed tiie command on April 20, 1809,
was that of making appointments to fill the
vacancies in the civil offices created by the
operation of the joint resolution of Con'gres
of February 19, J 809. The total number of j
civil officers in the State affected by that reso
lution was ti,061, and of this number only
SSTi were found in office Who could qualify
under the law of July 2,1S62, leaving o,176
appointments to l>e made. To the 1st of
October, instant, 3,070 appointments have
been made, and of these 708 have declined,
resigned, been removed, or have failed to
qualify, leaving 2,362 now iu office and 2,8-14
vacancies.
From the first it was found very difficult
to find suitable persons who were willing
to accept offices the duties of which inter
fered with their ordinary business, or occa
sioned a good deal of trouble, and yielded
110 compensation. Another embarrassment
resulted from the social and political pres
sure that was brought to bear upon nearly
all native Virginians who were suggested
or recommended for an office that involved
the necessity of taking the oath of office
prescribed by the law of July 2, 1862. At
this time, however, it is believed that every
county has a sufficient number of qualified
magistrates to organize and hold its regular
courts, and, with fe.vv exceptions, county
organization is so far completed as to be in
working condition.

Their duty in the McFarland case was
very simple?viz., to ascertain if the allega

The Recorder concluded : " If there has
been bigamy committed, aided, or abetted,

Debate before the Reconstruction
Committee of the Delegates from the
Different Organizations and from
the Virginia legislature?^Commit
tee Adjonmed to Meet To-Morrow?
Virginia will Probably be Admit
ted on Monday or Tuesday.
Special telegram to the Dispatch.
Washington, Docember 9,18G9.
At 10 o'clock this morning the House
Committee on Reconstruction assembled in
their rooms at the capitol. There was a
full attendance of the committee. General
Butler (chairman) announced that several
committees were waiting to state their
?views and present" memorials in reference
to the admission of Virginia.
A motion to admit them all was agreed to.
The committee representing the Legisla
ture, headed by Mr. Speaker Turner, and
accompanied by Governor Walker; the
committee representing the Radical wing of
the Republican Convention, headed by
Congressman Porter, and accompanied by
Messrs. Humphreys, Maddox, Ward well.
Morrissey, of Richmond, and several co
lored men ; and the committee representing
the Conservative or bolting portion of the
late Republican Convention, headed by
Congressmen Piatt and Ayers, and accom
panied by Mr-V. A. Witcher, J. Bland (co
lored, a member of the State Senate,) Hine,
and others, were the thrpe committees ad
mitted.
Mr. Porter presented an address of the
Radical wing of the late Convention, in
which were embraced a series of resolutions
passed by that wing and a memorial pray
ing that Virginia be not admitted until an
other election shall he held and the test
oath taken by members of tlie Legislature
and other ofiicers elected, etc.
Speaker Turner presented the memorial
of the Legislature, which was given in de
tail in these dispatches of yesterday. Mr.
Hine, chairman' of the bolters' or minori
ty's committee, presented a resolution on
behalf of the members of the convention
whom he represented. The resol utions, or
memorial, ask for the early admission ;ot
the State, and that members of the Legisla
ture only be required to take the oath ot
office as'prescribed by the reconstruction
laws. They left the reconstruction of these
laws to Congress, and did not advocate the
iron-clad oath.
Mr. Porter was the first to speak, and he
made a vehement and earnest speech ; pro
tested against the admission of the State at
this time; insisted upon the iron-clad oath
being administered ; was opposed to the
total amnesty idea, and insisted that the
wing of the Republican party which he
represented was the only true and loyal
party in the State ; and that the school sys
tem and jury clause of the Constitution
would not be carried out in good faith. He
cited an instance which lately occurred in
one of the counties where the sheriil had
summoned a mixed jury and the Stale
judge refused to swear them in on the
ground that colored juries were incompati
ble with the laws of the State.
Mr. Butler here interrupted the speaker,
and, turning to Governor Walker, asked ii
such was the case. Governor V\ alker an
swered that he did -not know, hut thought
perhaps it might be so, as the State was not
aow being governed uuder the new Consti
tution, but under the old laws, and said
that is just what we are waiting for, Gene
ral ; to have you approve and accept our
Constitution.
Mr. Porter continued his remarks at some
length, being earuest to the end that the
State should not be admitted unless there
was another election or the reassembling
of the Legislature, nud all required to sub
scribe to the iron-clad oath, and those who
could not do so should stand aside, and the
next highest on the legislative tickets be
admitted to the Legislature, etc.
Speaker Turner then made a few re
marks, stating that he was no politician nor
member of any party or wine; but he pre
sented the memorial of the Legislature in
good faith, aud was sure that every provi
sion of her Constitution would be strictly
carried out.
Mr. John B. Crenshaw, member of the
Legislature from Richmond city and Hen
rico, then made a brief and eloquent speech,
ne had been a Union man from the begin
ning of the late war, and had been a Re
publican since the Old-Line Whig party
disbanded. He knew that he spoke the
earnest sentiment of the legislative body of
which he was a member, and for whom he
now spoke as one of a committee for ^bom
he pledged that the new Constitution in all
its provisions would be faithfully carried
out.
Governor Walker, on behalf of the peo
ple and as their chosen Chief Executive,
assured the committee that the Constitution
should be carried out to the very letter.
He claimed to be a much older Republi
can than many of the Reconstruction Com
mittee. He stated that it was he who gave
to Senator Stewart, of Nevada, the original
draft and idea of the fifteenth amendment
bill. The fourteenth and fifteenth amend
ments had been adopted; and one of the
best State constitutions in the country had
been adopted almost unanimously by the
voters of his State. All the reconstruction
laws had been complied with. Fair elec
tions had been held, and the action of the
State approved by the President. For his
own part, he had not a doubt but that the
committee would do Virginia justice, and
report a bill for her admission at the earliest
practicable moment.
3tr. Wardwen,ifarmerly one of General
Butler's stuff officers, and now superintend- J
ent of the State penitentiary, protested
against the admi'Mon ot the State* and co
incided with the views of Congressman
Porter. Messrs. Humphreys and Maddox,
of the Convention committee, also pro
tested against the admission of the State.
Congressmen Piatt and Ayers, and Mr.
Hine, or the bolters'' wing of the late Con
vention, spoke in favor of the early admis
sion of the State.
On motion of Mr. Apson, of Michigan,
Mr. Bland (colored State Senator) was in
vited to give Ills views. Bland is abont
twenty-eight years of age, and quite black.
His eloquent speech before the committee not
only surprised them but his colleagues. He
staled in detail his reasons for bolting from
the late Republican Convention in Rich
mond. He desired it to be distinctly under
stood that he was a Republican, had always
been, and would continue to be, while that
party was the friend of his race. He thanked
the Republican party for the freedom
they had given his race, and the equal
rights which had been accorded them. He
was the warm advocate of the present
State Constitution, and was proud that he
was an humble instrument in framing it,
and of its final adoption by the people of his
native State. He was satisfied nineteen
twentieths of the people of all colors and
localities in Virginia were daily praying for
the speedy admission of the State. It was
but a few designing men who, to carry out
some personal schemes, were opposed to
the admission of the State as at present or
ganized. He was opposed to the test-oath,
or iron-clad oath, as it is called.
General Butler: "Why are you opposed
to the test-oath ?"
Bland: "Because I do not consider it
fair or consistent. The people of Massa
chusetts or Pennsylvania can take the test
oath, for they were all in the North during
the war, while men of Virginia were nearly
! all with the South, and to insist upon their
taking the test-oath is simply to ostracise
nearly nine-tenths of the white men of the
State*, the larger number of whom were
now good Union men.'
Ho was sure he spoke the sentiments of a
large majority of the colored men of A ir
ginia when he expressed the earnest hope
and p'raycr that Virginia be at once admit
ted into the union of States.
A general conversation ensued between
the members of the Reconstruction Com
mittee.
General Butler then announced that the
committee would meet Saturday morning
and receive the committee again. It was
agreed to allow Beckley (colored), from
Alexandria, to reply to Bland's speech on
Saturday, but the committee ordered that
all others who would have anything to say
must present it in writing.
The committee then adjourned. The
Porter faction is sure the test-oath will be
required, and that the State will not now
hp admitted. They have Wardwell with
them, and he is represented as a warm per
sonal friend of General Butler, and as
having much influence with him.
Porter insists that his speech to-day set
tled the matter, and he will carry his point.
Butler wants the State admitted, and I
think the weight of his influence will speed
ily bring about the result. The Legislative
Committee arc confident. They have pre
sented a memorial and pledge, as previously
approved l>v General Butler, and feel sure
he will remain true to his assurances given
to thera a few days since.
It was observed to-day that Representa
tive Farnsworth, of Illinois, was one of the
most desirous in the committee to have the
bill for the admission <>f the State presented
at once. lion. Fernando V ood expressed
the opinion that he did not believe a single
member of the committee would vote (in
committee) against a bill of admission du
ring the session of the committee. General
Butler has given no opinion -pro or con., but
was exceedingly courteous to all parties. In
an interview with Gen. Butler he stated that
there was now no doubt about the 9peed\
admission of the State of Virginia. He said
we onlv require a guarantee that the school
system and the jury clause embraced in the
Constitution be strictly carried out. He
said, emphatically, we don't care a fig
about test-oaths; wc only want the guaran
tee ; and then there is no doubt about the
State being at once admitted. When re
minded that* the pledge guaranteeing the
faithful carrying out of the provisions ol
the new Constitution had been given to the
Reconstruction Committee to-dav, he said
? Yes, I know ; that is all right, and I don't
think there will be any more trouble about
it. We will be sure, though, to provide
that there be no more Georgia tricks
plaved." He then spoke in complimentary
terms of Bland, the young colored man who
addressed the committee to-day, and re
marked, "I hear that he was formerly
identified with the Democratic party, but,"
laughing, "that is no great matter."
It is the general opinion here to-night
that the admission of the State of "V irginia
will be accomplished next Monday or Tues
day. Wallace.
The Admission of Virginia?Speeches
before the Reconstruction Commit
tee by Governor Walker, Speaker
Turner, Porter, Piatt, and others.
Special telegram to the Dispatch.
Washington, December 9, 1869.
My telegram of yesterday incorrectly in
cluded Speaker Turner among those re
lieved of disabilities. F. B. Stovall, Paul
Adams, and H. A. C'arrington, are the only
persons from Halifax and Charlotte in
cluded in the bill.
The scene before the Reconstruction Com
mittee was disorderly and undignified in
the extreme. Each of the three committees
from Virginia presented written addresses,
and more thap a dozen stump-speeches
were made.
The Wickham, Porter, and General As
sembly Committees were all before the Re
construction Committee at the same time.
Hine, of the Wickham Committee, spoke
first, and though he desired the admission
of Virginia, yet he wanted the " iron-clad"
applied.
Porter followed in a foul-mouthed tirade
against the State and her people, and said
his life and every Union man's life in Vir
ginia were unsafe, lie swore that he had
been guarded by negro Republicans with
muskets iu their bunds wherever he spoke
in the recent canvass; had frequently had
pistols drawn on him; that Bocock incited
the negroes to it; made a huge handle of
Judge WeisigeFs exclusion of negroes from
the jury-box; called Stoneman and Scho
field disloyal; and wound up by frantically
asking that Virginia be not admitted at all.
Ward well'8 tirade was even worse than
Porters. In the name of himself, Mrs.
Wardwell, the little Wardwells, and all the
inmates of the penitentiary,?who, he
thanked God, he had taught to mix politics
with their prayers?he demanded that the
iron-clad should be applied to the members
of the Virginia Legislature, and especially
to the superintendent of the penitentiary
who would soon succeed him.
Speaker Turner then presented the ad
dress of his committee in appropriate
terms, and Friend Crenshaw followed him
in remarks that must have been convincing.
Governor Walker, after some further re
marks from Iiine and Porter of the same
sort, manfully and ably vindicated Virgi
nia's people and her, claims to immediate
admissioii.
Piatt, of Petersburg, advocated the lm?
mediate admission of tho State, and wanted
do iron-clad. Porter pitched into Piatt,
and was in turn pitched into by Bland (ne
gro), when the hour of 12 having arrived,
Porter begged that the committee would
hear him farther. The committee fixed 10
A. M. Saturday for further discussion, when
Colonel W. W. Wood, at the request of
