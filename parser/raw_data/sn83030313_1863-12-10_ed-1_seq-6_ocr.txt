THK BITUATIOM.
The Army of the I'otomac is perfectly quiet. '
No demonstrations hare been made since the 6th (
instant, when a rcronnoissancc was made to Madi- 1
oon Court House which resulted in establishing
the fact that no rebel force exists in that quarter. 1
Rome anxiety is felt in the army as to who is to be
the successor of General Meade, it being believed, |
apparently, that he is not to continue in command, i
although we have no official information of his
removal. It aeema to bo generally accepted
that General Pleasanton u to direct whatever
movements may take place during the
nriatoa. Borne reports are also prevalent In the
army that it is about to he broken op, and that a
portion of it waa about to be aent to some other 1
part of the country for a winter campaign. The
story that General Thomas Francis Meagher was
captured- by the rebels during the recent movement
of the Army of the Potomac is entirely false. Ho
waa on a visit to the remnant of his old Irish
Brigade when the advance upon the enemy was
ordered, and, as might be expected from his
previous career, which has been remarkable for
undaunted courage and pluck^e went with them
into the front of danger; bat he was not taken prisoner.
He returned with them across the Rapidan,
and is now the gnest of General Corcoran at
Fairfax Court House. Hii reception by his old
comrades and brother generals throughout the
entire army U said to have been most cordial and
enthusiastic.
We have received, and would publish to-day if
(Ue demud on oar space permitted it, the special
report of oar correspondent with the Second
arm/ corps, commanded by General Warren. The
account gives another view of the cause of General
Meade's failure to defeat the enemy at Mine
run, and, in order that General Warren and all the
other generals engaged shall have fair play, we
wi(l publish the statement at the first opportunity;
but tlio importance of the President's Message
and the accompanying documents, which we give
in our columns, precludes the possibility of publishing
it to-day.
The rebels have been doing bold things in our
waters. The war has been carried "into Africa."
The steamer Chesapeake, of the Cromwell line,
hound from this city.to Portland, on her regular
trip, with a large cargo, valued at llgft.OOO, was
taken possession of on Monday morning, about one
o'clock, by a-party of rebels numbering about sixteen,
who were apparently unarmed and inoffensive
passengers. The captain was put in irons,
the second engineer shoe dead, and thrown overboard,
and some others of the officers wounded.
This extraordinary proceeding took place abont
twenty-one milea northeast of Cape Cod. The
raptured officer* and crew, together with the passengers,
were landed by the daring pirate* at
Partridge I aland, and the ateamer then ntartcd off
to aea When lent neen ahe was lying
alongside another res*ol, apparently taking in
coal, and it was thought that ahe would then
make for Wilmington, N. C., and endearor
to ran the blockade Quite n fleet of
Union re-tec la, both from Portland and
from thia harbor, are going off in pursuit of the
Chesapeake. The new gnnbont Agawan was to
liare left Portland at aix o'clock last evening, and
the etcaucra Vlckahiirg, Bebago and Grand Gulf
will start from the Brooklyn Nary Yard to-day.
No doubt it will be a very exciting chase, pro*
sided these resects get sight of the captured
pirate craft.
The latent date* from Charleston are to the 7th
tnat., by way of Richmond. The Are between the
enemy's batteries and oar own was going on slowly.
No casualties are reported.
CONOSItl.
The annual Message of the President and tha
accompanying documents were commnnlcated to
Congress yesterday. Tha President says we remain
at peace with all foreign Powers. The effort*
of disloyal citiicns to inrolre us in foreign
wars bare been unavailing. Ha recommends the
auhject of an international telegraph serosa tho
Atlantic; also a telegraph between Washington
and the national forts along tbe Atlantic seaboard
and Golf of Mexico. The operations of tha Treasury
hare been a<icce*?ful. Of those ?ho were
aiares at the beginning of the rebellion fully
lOOflOO are in the Upfted States military
service, and aboat one half btar arms. Tfie
orlaia which threatened to divide the IrleDd* of

in reduced limit*. He thinks it proper to issue
it proclamation and an oath. He believes nothing
is attempted beyond the limits of the constitution.
l'ardons arc promised in case the oath is
voluntarily taken, but none are coerced to take it.
It is also proposed that if in uny of the Slates
named a State government shall be, in the mode
prescribed, set up, such government shall be recognized
and guaranteed by the United States, and
that under it the Staie shall, on the constitutional
conditions, be protected against invasion and domestic
violence. The suggestion in the proclamation
as to maintaining the political framework of
the States 011 what is culled reconstruction is
made in the hope that it may do good, without
danger or harm. It will save labor and m oid great
confusion.
We have received the reports of the Secretaries
of War, the Navy and Interior, and abstracts of
the reports of the Postmaster General, the Chief
of Ordnance, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs
and the Commissioner of the Land Office. The
Army, Navy, Post Office, Interior anil Ordnance
reports are published in to-day's paper. We give
to-day important tables showing the condition of
the government finances and the estimates of
next year's expenditures, and to-morrow we shall
lay before our readers the report of the Secre
rary 01 mc Treasury complete.
The Senate transacted no business of geveral
interest yesterday. The joint resolution of thanks
to General Grant was received from the Honse,
a ordered to lie on the table, Senators not
wishing to impair their dignity by hurrying its
passage.
In the House the resolution offered by Mr. Co*,
ooking to an cxchunge of prisoners of war, with
an amendment sustaining the administration in
the etlorts it has already made to that end, was
:i d.iptcd. A resolution to visit the Ilusnian Admiral
on Saturday was also adopted.
MISCELLANEOUS NEWS.
The steamer Roanoke, from Havana, arrived at
this port last evening. The news she brings,
though not immediately important, is not without
interest. Another civil waT?no uncommon thing
in Mexico?has been installed between the States
of Campeaehy and Yucatan, and- the struggle, is
being waged with great ferocity and determination.
There is nothing of eonHequence from Matamoros.
The Ipcal Havana news does not present
many important features.
An extensive condagration, involving the loss
of abont $300,(^0 in property, occutred yesterday,
on the North river, and the reader is referred to
another column for particulars.

Justice), who has resigned before his term of
office expired.
The trial of William Butnty, in the Oyer and
Terminer, for the murder of William William* the
colored man, was continued yesterday. The defence
is an alibi, some of the witnesses testifying
that the man whom they aaw throw the stone on
deceased's prostrate body was not the prisoner.
The case will be summed up to-day by ex^udge
Stewart and District Attorney A. Oakey Hall.
Surrogate Tucker yesterday settled the accounts

The President's Nrsssgt-Ills Plan of
Restoration.
The President's Message is before our readers.
Considering the numerous details it embodies
in reference to our foreign and domestic
affairs, and the importance of the various subjects
discussed and recommendations presented,
the document has at least fbo merit of
remarkable brevity. Ilia expositions, too. of
the operations and events of tbe past year
within tbe several departments of the government,
and his propositions in the way of additional
measures of legislation, are calculated,
with an exception or two, to leave a favorable
impression upon the public mind.
We have not the space to-day to enter into a
detailed review of tbe national ways and means
and measures of economy and expediency sttg
crOMtoil hv (lift llMflftfffi' hut in viiw rtf th?
year's expenditure* of eight hundred and
ninety-Are millions of dollars, and the appalling
mountain of public debt which we are
thus building tip. there is one proposition
submitted which, it is to be hoped, will secure
the early and earnest attention of the two
houses. We refer to that brief sentence of the
Message in which is suggested "the propriety
of raising by appropriate legislation a revenue
from the mineral lands of the United Slates."
The gold and silror of these mineral lands?If
half that we bear of them be true?from the
Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, and
from the British possessions down to our Mexl
can boundary, may, with the return of peace,
be made to contribute twenty or thirty mil
lions a year to the treasury for twenty or
thirty years to come. But. myff Iff*, in
new of the publlj 4tbt fcnd the heavy taxations
before us, the subject of a revenue from
three inexhaustible gold and silver lands of
the government may well command the immediate
action of Congress.
With flii- approval of the President's season
able, just and proper recommendation upon
k. 11 KHALI), THURSDAY,"
tbe money question, wc proceed to bis views
upon the uegro question, and bin plan tor the
reclamation of the rebellious States. He adheres
te bis emancipation proclamation. He
says that it lias worked well for the national
cause, Aud lie is thus satisfied that the procla
illation and the laws conneoted with Hwill continue
to work well. He holds that to "abandon
them now would be not only to relinquish a
iover of power, but would also bo a cruel and
astouisbing breach of laith;" aud bo promises
that "while I remain in my present positiou,
1 shall not attempt to retract or modify the
emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return
to slavery any person who is free by the terms
of that proclamation, or by any of Uio acts of
Congross."
Then comes his new proclamation, embracing
an amnosty to the people of the rebellious
States, its conditions and limitations, and tbe
terms upou which said States may return to
their allegiance to tbe Union. He excludes
from the benefits ?of his amnesty all persons
who are or shall have been civil or diplomatic
officers or agents of the* so-called Confederate
States, all their soldiers above the rank of
colonel,' all their naval officers above tbe rank
oi lieutenant, ana mi ttiose who-bave resigned
commUnions in the army or navy of the United
States to ester the rebel service, and all those
coneerned in treating colored persons in tbe
government services taken as prisoners, otherwise
than as prisoners of war, Ac. The favored
classes offered (lie benefits of a foil pardon
and the restoration of their political rights
under the government, and their property (excepting
their slaves), arc required, as tho condition
precedent, to take an oatb of allegiance
involving the recognition of the binding force
of the emancipation proclamation and all the
kindred acts of Congress on the swbjeot, ' so far
and so long as not repealed, modified or held
void by Congress or by decision of tbeSupreme
Court."
Next in order, when a number of the- persona
wiio shall have taikca this oath in any rebellious
State, equal to one-tenth of tbe popular
vote in such State in- the Presidential election
of I860, "shall re-establish a State government,
republicnh in form, and in no wise contravening
said oath," such State, so reorganized,
shall be readmitted to the benefits and protection
of the Union. In otjier words, the favored!
classes of the- people of each of the rebellious
States embraced in the President's amnesty
arc required, first, to endorse the emancipation
proclamation, and, secondly, to.organize a State
government, declaring slavery abolished, before
they can be restored to the Union. In theScriptural
account of Sodom and Gomorrah it
is staffed that the Lord promised to Abraham
Ho spare those wicked cities if ereo ten
righteous men could be found thereto; but
they could not be found, and we know the
ffemlt We dare say that oar Father Abraham's
"one-tenth" proposition was suggested by this
proposition of the original Father Abraham of
ten righteous men in Sodom, and we fear that
the result will be the same?that the righteous
men required to save the rebellious States from
a destructive storm of fire and brimstone will
nof be iound.
But President Lincoln wishes it to be understood
that in offering this plan of restoration it
does not follow that it is irrevocable, or may
not be set aside for some better plan. Indeed,
he suggests that the rebellious States may return
through tbe door of Congress, but that
Congress alone can determine when and how
that' door is to be opened. We conclude that
Mr. Lincoln's plan will be a failure, and it is
quite possible that it has been submitted more
with a view to open the question of an amnesty
and a restoration, or more to conciliate tbe
radicals, than from any hope of the acceptance
of these overtures by tbe States ooncerncd, or
any one of them not under tbe absolute control
of our armies.
We are now adrift at sea beyond our ancient
landmarks, and upon what shore we may reach
the anchorage of peace it would be vain to conjecture.
We can only hope that freru the very
agitation which the restoration plan of the
Message win create we may reacn some satisfactory
"halfway house of rest."
General Grant and tiik Politicians ?The
World newspaper?which has been jumping
about from one faction to another, trying to
become the organ of each, but remaining only
a short time with either; which now seems to
be controlled by a clique of Wall street politicians,
composed of Barlow, Barnard and
Anderson?published yesterday the following
statement, dlade by Senator Wilson in his
speech before the American Anti-Slavery Society
in Philadelphia:?
t Iiavo never boon an onli alsvcrv m*n, but I try to
Judge justly of what I sen I mine up my mind when
this war opened that the North and .south could only live
together In peace. a* one nattue by being a free nation.
Slavery, which constituted the corner stone of the so
railed confederacy, Is knocked out, and It will take mora
men In future to hold the black race as alavoa than to put
down the rebellion. Much as ! deairo peace, I am oppoeed
to It until this question of slavery is forever nettled
Senator Wilson said in his speech that the
Sbove language was used by General Grant In
a letter. We do not believe a word of it, but,
on the contrary, look upon this statement as an
unmitigated falsehood and fabrication, to injure
General Grant with the conservative men
of the country.
Senator Wilson is a very efficient business
man in the Senate, gentlemanly and affable in
bis manner, and would make an excellent Secretary
of War in the place of the present incapable
Secretary, Mr Stanton. Yet. with all
of theee virtue*, there is no reliance whatever
to bo placed upon bit word. Ho baa no
moral conception of truth lie will, a* wo
have heretofore shown, make a statement
on the floor of the Senate, and deny it ???toto
on the stump on the very next day. We shall
want some other endorsement besides that of
Senator Wilson before we pnt any faith in the
assertion, especially when we take into consideration
tba fact that General Grant never bad
anything to do with politicians, as will be seen
by the following anecdote:?
During the siege of Vi kaburg sever*! politicians
called upon General Grant one day to
talk about political matters. General Grant
listened to tbem for a few moments and then
interrupted them, sayingThere is no use of
talking about politics to nu> I know nothing
about that subject, and, furthermore, 1 don't
know of any person among my acquaintances
who does, bit there is one snbjeot with which
I am perfectly acquainted Talk of that, and I
your man,"
' Wbijt is (hat, General*" asked the politicians
in surprise
"Tannirtg leather," replied General Grant.
General Grant's father was a wealthy tanaer
out West, and before the rebellion the General
himself assisted in conducting the business^
Dense the reply.

The Tartar Mm"'
The fuct mentioned in our Nfsslttngton
desp liche&'bf Monday in regard to the Huseiau
Is-galiou has excited a good deal of surprise and
in irtiiicnl.on 11 our New Vork community ,
Tlio idea oi Our lining hem toadying and
feting the naval oliiiers of a Power whose di* i
ploinatic agents liave boon all along undis- '
guisedly favorable to the rebels in humiliating
in the extreme; and it is the more wounding
to our aejf-reapect from tho ooascioupuesa that
the objecta of all this adulation were rvo more
socially than they were politically entitled to
it. In the whole of the Russian dominions ?
and that is saying a great deal?It would be
iklficult to find a more awkward or uncultivated
set of boors.
Judging from tho class of men that he saudb
among us, tho Emperor Alexander does not
hold American institutions and manners in
very high esteem. Tho selection- of his repre- ;
sentatives hero is made on the broadest democratic
principle, speaking in the European sense.
At tbo European oourts his legation* are composed
of men of high breeding and of the most
winning and courteous manners. Ia London,
Paris umd Vienna none of the foreign diplomatic
agents are more cordially weloomed in
aristocratic circles or are more popular out |
side. They take rank with the highest, are
gracious to their inferiors and ate princely in {
their exuendihirn while in ennernl arnnire
moots their superiors aro not to be found, fans
sian diplomacy is well aware how essential are
all these qualifications to the success of its
policy at the European courts. That it should
doom them unnecessary in our caso is a proof
that it regards us, in good breeding and cultivation,
as but very little superior to its owe Moudjicks.
_ i
If we Tooff back at the men who have been
selected to represent the Guar a>t our republican
court for the last quarter of a century we will
sec bow just is this appreciation of Russian
notions in our regard. Tbero has not been a
minister among' them who has occupied either
a first class political or social' position in his
own pountry. Men of small fortunes, small
diplomatic experience and inferior tone, they
havo failed to leave behind them'those favorable
impressions which in European'circles are
usually made by Russian diplomats It required
some extraordinary combination of oii>
cumstances like that presented by the analogy
^ostensible more than real) between the political
situations of the two countries to arouse
anything like a feeling of cordial friendship
towards a government which treated' us as a
PAmmiiftiiv inforirvr in P11HIwafmn anil rnfinA.
ment to its European compeers.
Wben Americans allow tbeir feelings to get
tbe better of tbeii judgments they generally
carry matters to eairempa. Tbe numberless '
bitter lessens wo-base-received from tiw+ngrati
tad* of tbe foreigners on> wbooa we nave 1
lavished our- hospitality has not cured us of 1
this tendency. Tbe receptioa given to the 1
officers of tbe Russian squadron (Wiring their
late visit to our port shows that we areas ready
as ever to rush into- these extravagant demonstrations
ef regard towards strangers for whonf
we really care nothing. And cwi bono* To bo
told that the diplomatic representatives of these
very men have been all along openly avowing
tbeir sympathy with those who are struggling
to destroy our institutions
If, socially, we bod benefited anytbiag by intercourse
with these people, tbe regret inspired
by our folly might bare been deprived of tbe
sting of humiliation. But we have not even
tbe consciousness of this to console us. We i
bare received in our houses and admitted to
the intimacy of our families a &t of uncouth
creatures, who, under other circumstances,
could never have obtained entrance there.
Were we as ignorant of social refinements and
convenances as Russian policy assumes us to
be, tbe contrast presented to tbeso men by tbe
English, French and Italian officers who partake
of our boepitalities would soon open our
eyes to their real characters and position. |
While these latter are men of high Jone and i
varied accomplishments, and in general belong i
to the first families in their respective conn- 1
tries, the former have either tbe manners of 1
rustics or the frisky smartness of tailors
We se& that tbe government officials in Washington
are makiug even still greater fools of
themselves than we did in dining and feting these
semi-barbarians. This is unpardonable^ for
they cannot plead ignorance as to the conduct
of the Russian Legation in our regard Similarity
of tastes and habits is, however, apt to
begqt sympathy The ignorance and vulgarity
of tbe olle class of men acCord well with the
vulgarity and pretensions of tbe other
Tub Countkt Rapidi.t Running Into BaktuitisM?If
we trust accounts published in the
radical abolition prints about the treatment of
our prisoners by the rebels, it is apparent that
the war has reached a point of malignity aod
atrocity only equalled by the religious wars
which devastated Europe in past centuries.
Tbe wars of Mahomet were bloody and terrible,
and wero conducted with all the blindness and
' fury of fanatical zeal. The wars of the Reformation
were as ferocious ami more intolerant;
for then civilization was beginning to develop
itself, and thousands were tortured and killed
for the difference of opinion on religious dogmas.
It was hoped that this terrible sentiment
of malignity bad been banished from the human
mind as the world became more and more
enlightened and civilised; but it seems that it
baa not The war about slavery has revived it.
and it is now assuming all its ancient aspects
of horror. The war originated with abolition
ists, who held that alt slaveholders should be
killed; and radicals in the South retaliated by
banging sundry abolfcionbrta Small factions
in both sections fanned the flame of civil dis
cord until it has reached its present tremendous
proportions and ferooious concomitants The
system of slavery may not be the best for
the purposes intended?tba agricultural development
of tbo .South?and some other might
be substituted with advantage in some com
munities. But it is a matter that belongs to
those States and communities alone The North
has nothing to do with it, tnuch less to raise a
bloody hand either to destroy or propagate it
The radical abolition prints of the North aver
that the rebel chiefs litre determined to murder
tbfe officers and enslave or kill the privates in
our colored regiments Onr chiefs retort by
stopping the exchange of prisoners, end hnn
dreds of our poor fellows languish and die of
starvation and disease In tbe loathsome priw,Q

[lornoll, the Street Coniniissioner, denies, and
B'o Relieve truly, that he is reipousiblo for
,he obstructioes in Fifth avenue*/ near the onranco
to the Park The blame eAtacbiug to
thoni, it appears, rests entirely will* the Croton
3om-mi?sioner? Who are these Commissioners
? Will any one tell us their names
ind where they are to be foumt? It is
important, 10 UH-co Know wuo are uie aarnanans
who keep the thoroughfare* of a city of a millien
of inhabitants choked up by their clumsy
attempts at pip?laying and road repairing.
There is not a mini I town in Europe that would
tolerate such a<abate of things fqf a single day.
Pipes can be laid'and roads repaired 'without,
the carriageway being entirely blooked up.
Ate we Calmucs> Choctaw Indians or Feejee
Islanders, that out convenience and comfort
should 4)0 thus disregarded? We hope that
some generous person will giwe us a clue V?the
identity and whereabouts jat those Croton CommisBiooers.*
