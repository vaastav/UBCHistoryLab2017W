JINGO IN THE MYY l
Naval Officials Are Talking War
With Chili
THEY ARE SPOILING FOR A EIGHT
udce of Crimes Fosters Inqurlns Into The
Baltimore Case About Completed BefDRces
in the American Legation
Special TIE HERALD Examiner DIspatch1
NEW YORK Dec 16A Herald Washington
special says The nan department is in a
warlike mood The principal naval authorities
have for some time given out the impression
that they were spoiling for a light Perhaps i
was largely wit them a case of the wish being
father to the thought But at all events they
are talking war lomssimo just now From
talk in the deoartmcut today it aupears that
intimations hate been received from good
authorities in and about Chi that the Chilians
are delaying their response to our demand for
informaton concerning the Valparaiso incident
for the purpose ol gaining time in which to
prepare for war with this country and that
they will continue their dilatory policy so as
to malt incise preparations as complete as
possible The inIerence is that i Chill can per
suade tee United States to wait a few weeks
longer or until the most formiable new war
vessel of the Chilian fleet the Captain Pratt is
complete and equiped she will be better pre
pared for hostile demonstration The situation
thus outlined was discussed with eagerness at
the navy department this afternoon and the
opinion was freely advanced that President
Harrison would in all likchooil take measures
to checkmate Chili in this matter by sending a
special message to Congress within the
next two weeks reciting the fact that an ex
planntion and repraation had been demanded of
Chili without avail and uroclaJmiug the ntces
sill of informing Chi that this country will
resort to extreme measures if the desired re
sponse is further delayed beyond a reasonable
and specified time The wisdom of this course
it is argued would be apparent because i
would take the Chilians snort handed and
would prevent them from getting possession of
the Captain Pratt This vessel is now building
in Trance and cannot be finished in less than
two mouths or more It in the meanwhile
President Harrison and Congress should cause
a declaration of war by tue United States
against Chili it would prevent France from de
lit enns tho Captain Pratt to hill and would
save New York and other Atlantic cities from
the danger of bombardment by that vessel In
case of war between the two countries the ad
vantages of this move would be manifest The
nUT people say that this action is what may
reasonab y be expected from the President
and they point to the passages in his recent
message to Congress as indicating it They
also profess to hate receted intimations that
the Chilians hate been lately communicating
with the French builders wfth view

LOUISIANA POLITICS
Two Conventions Assemble in
Baton Rouge
Trouble Over the Lottery Question Demands
of the Adams MenThe Farmers
Refuse to Bndco an Inch
BATON ROUGE La Dec 16The Demo
cratic convention was announced to meet here
today but when the time came two oistinct
bodies assembled this being the result of the
fight over the lottery question Last night the
McEnery men held a caucus as did also the
Adams people and appointed conference com
mittees On behalf of the Adams men the
committee demanded that all frivolous contests
be dismissed all dissensions as to the dismissal
of the lottery amendments and to white primaries
pr
mares be abandoned that the convention
place in the platform an anti lottery plank and
that proper assurances be given lor the faithful
carrying out 01 us provisions The McEnery I
committee replied its caucus was composed of
both pro and antilottery men who had come
alike to submit tho question to white
primaries Tney would not abandon their
position i they did it would mean
to the world they were simply ofllce seekers
Todaywhen the state
committee met Chair
man Lanier was not present and the commit
tee deposed him electing Governor Wickcliflo
chairman The committee then proceeded to
perfect arrangements for a nominating conven
tion and the ant lottery men with Lamer at
their head held a similar meeting An effort
made to heal the breach failed and at noon two
conventions each claiming to represent the
D mocrc of the state assembled Nothing
beyond routine organization was accomplished
by cither body except the appoint
ment of a committee by the McEnery
people to confer with the opposition
opposion
The anti McEneryites had inteional trouble
of their own a number of its members desir
inK to abrogate the Lafayette agreement and
bring about a new ticket in which the larmers
were to hate part but hot the leadership
Tho farmers refused to budge an inch insisting
upon the terms of the agreement and T S
Adams for governor I is thought the con
vention will carry out the agreement as a re
fusal would result in another division and a
straight out farmers ticket

YOUNG MRS BLAINE
Testimony in the Divorce Case
Being Taken in New York
The lady Has Lost Much of Her Beauty
James Jr Will Ficht the Case Tho
Trial to Be in Deadwood S D
NEW YORK Dec 16Tho yellow hair of
Mrs James G Blame jr is as sunny as ever
and the eyes are as blue but pain and suffering
have marred the beautiful face For two
weeks the daughterinlaw of the secretary of
state has been in New York She came hero to
be present at the taking of testimony in the dl
torce suit which she has brought against her
husband Mrs Blaine went to Sioux Falls S
D last April taking up horrosidence there for
the express purpose of securing a divorce from
young Mr Elaine The laws of Dakota require
A RESIDENCE OP THREE HONTHS
in order to bring suit for divorce Mrs Blaine
came to Now York very quietly every effort
was taken to keep the fact quiet Her pres
ence here was necessary because it was de
in the case taken in this city before a referee
mutually agreed upon Ibm referee selected
was Daniel Lord jr The taking of testimony
began last Saturday in Mr Lords office in the
Equitable building No 120 Broadway There
for the first time in many months the husband
and wife met lace to face Yet they made
no sign Mr Blames attorneys are
Goodrich Deady Goodrich marino
lawyers Mrs Blames attorneys are
Hoadley Wouterbach Johnson The few
who saw the
fashionably dressed young man
enter the building with Mr Goodrich recog
nized him and no ono knew the young woman
with F M Johnson because
MRS BLAINE WAS VEILED
And every afternoon at 2 oclock since than
they have entered the building The taking of
testimony not yet completed it may continue
until after Christmas The trial will take
place in Deadwood South Dakota In February
There appeared in the newspapers today a
telegraph dispatch from Deadwood announcing
that the circuit court had granted her IWO tem
porary alimony and 300 for counsel fees Mrs
Blaine applied for tlOOOU temporary alimony
and tAO for counsel fees In his reply to this
young Mr Blaine said it was impossible for
him to pay that much money as his Income
was only icO a week Mr Johnson said today
that when Mrs Blaine secured a divorce and
he had no doubt that it w > uld bo given her It
would lift crnnii in Vmr Vnrl cr 1n KVor a rrnM
suit is for absolute divorce on the ground of
DESERTION AND NOVStTPPORT
Had Mr Blaine made no answer and a divorce
had been secured by default then it would not
be recognized by the laws of this state But
the fact that the husband did make an answer
will make the divorce when granted perfectly
legaB In connection with the granting of ali
mony and counsel fees Mr Johnson said that
Blaine would have to pay the tS 0 or he would
not bo able to go on with the contest If he
does not pay that amount within thirty days
as directed by the court ho will be adjudged in
contempt of court Then Mrs Blaine can go on
and secure tier divorce and her husband cannot
make the slightest opposition Young Mr
Blaine is making every effort to prevent a de
cree from being granted There Is no doubt
that he will pay tho SSOO as directed by the
court
VVHEN THE CASE COMES TO TRIAL
it will probably be one of the most remarkable
that has ever taken place in the country Mrs
Blame is thoroughly convinced that her bus
band will bring every means at his command to
bear in order to prevent her from getting her
freedom
