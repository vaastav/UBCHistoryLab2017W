The following subjects have been sug
gested for the Legislature to act upon:
To prohibit the "putting of a Mansard
roof on a man with a red head.
To abolish "sparking" Sunday nights.
To make young ladies put their flames
out at ten r. n.
To appoint inspectors of heated Imagina
tion. To furnish the leading hose companies
with "Hamlet's advice to the players."
To incorporate female Insurance Uompi

sumed by a hopeless passion.
Among the other Btrcets to,be. improved,
it is proposed to extend'Milk, as if milk was
not "extended" enough in Boston now.
That solitary reporter who referred to
th firo as "The Great Holocaust," proba

There was so much force required to
pky on the fire that there was but little left
last week to play upon words.
Nervous excitement his reached such a
point in Boston, owing to recent tires, that
a ci'y official, who stated at a meeting that
he was In a blaze of enthusiasm, was im
mediately put out by a member of the fire
department present.
Street after street succumbed to the fire;
neither Milk nor Water would stop it.
"A burning shame" Mansard roofs.
The Boston nepers appeared in Arab cos

A successful borer for petroleum Is said

A somewhat ludicrous scene occurred in
one of the dry goods stores in Troy, New
York, on Saturday evening. Three ladies
entered the store for the purpose of exam
ining some ready-made suits. In the de
partment devoted to this class of goods
several "dummies" are used, upon which
different styles of goods arc displayed. 0n9
of the ladies walked up to one of the "dum
mies" and commenced to feel of the dress
which covered it. Supposing it was placed
there as a sample, she handled it pretty
thoroughly, and then called the attention of
her companions to it. Oce of the others
also felt of the stuff, and then remarked :
"Whv, that's a homely strips." The third
lady followed by saying: "It won't pay for
making up " Whereupon the "dummy"
turned her head and smiled, to the utter
astonishment and mortification of the la
dles in question, who discovered that
instead of a "dummy" samp'e, they had been
criticising the dress of a real live woman.
Explanations and apologies followed In pro
fusion. No tvoxdeb the artists love St. Peters
burg. If they shudder at the cold and
grumble at the climate generally; if it is far
from the brightness of their beloved Taris,
from cultivated Berlin, or art-loving Vien
na, yet it has mairy consolations. Among
these barbarous people music has its tradi
tional charms to soothe the sivage. Empe
rors, under its softening influence, give dia
monds. Grand Dukes lead the claquers,
and Prime Ministers send courteous ex
cuses that age and increasing infirmities
prevent their testifying their pleasure
in person, but will the prima donna be con
descending enoujh to come in her cirrlat;e
and receive thanks? It lessens our wonder
a little when we hear that Christina Nils
son, who is now singing in St. Petersburg,
was the recipient of such honors. She
sang in Hamlet, and the Grand Duke Con
stantino led the applause; the Prime Minis
ter sent for her, and congratulated her, and
the people went wild, and frightened the
prima donna's horses.
Ose of those eccentric characters, who,
brought into prominence by a startling
crime, occupy tbe public attention by pecu
liarities tLat are striking, and psychological
ly puzzling, is at present in the penitentiary
at Sing Sing. Every now and then we
hear of her as Mrs. Henrietta Robinson,
the "veiled murderess." Eighteen
years ago she was tried and convic-'ed at
Troy, New York, of murder by the admi
nistration of poison. At her trial she kept
her face veiled beyond recognition; and
when compelled to remove her veil, still
managed, with carious and almost insine
persistence, to screen her naturally hand
some features in somi other way from the
gaze of the court. She Is not Insane, how
ever, according to medical testimony. She
has turned her cell into a conservatory, and
seeks to obtain from her flowers the long
lost bloom of youth. No one can obtain a
clue to her origin, and she is, among the
prisoners, an object of rcspict mingled with
a certain awe.
A French paper gives a detailed ac
count of the manufacture of false eyes in
Paris, from which the curious fact appears
that ths average sda pers week of eyes in
tended ffor the human head, amount to
four hundred. Oue of tho leading dealers
in this article carries on business In a sa
loon of great magnificence; his servant has
but one eye, and the effect of any cf the
eyes wanted by customers is conveniently
tried In this servant's head, so that the cus
tomer cn judge very readily as to the ap
pearance it will produce in his own head.
The charge is about ten dollars per eye.

A Connrmatlon ot the Bible Story
from Cbaldalo Sonrccs.
We have received from tho accomplished
discoverer, Mr. George Smith, of the Brit
ish Museum, the subjoined most interest
ing account of the record of the delugf,
which, as we announced a day or two ago
he has lately deciphered from the Assyrian
monuments:
"The cuneiform inscription which I have
recently found and translated gives a long
and full account of the deluge. T contains
the version or tradition of this event, which
existed in the early Chaldean period at tho
City of Erech(one of tho cities of Nimrod),
now represented by the ruins of Warka. In
this newly dtrcovered inscription the ac
count of tbo delude Is put as a uarrat veln-'
to the mouth of Xi-uthrus or Noab. Ho re
lates tho wickedness of tho world, tho
command to build the ark, its building,
the filling of it, the deluge, the resting of
the ark on a mountain, tbo sending out of
the birds, and other matters. Tho narra
tive has a closer resemblauce to the account
transmitted by the Gieeks from Berosus
the Chaldean historian, than to the Biblical
history, but it does not differ materially
from either. The principal differences aio
as to the duration of the deluge, tho name
of tho mountain on which the ark rested,
the sending out of the birds, etc. The
cuneiform account is much larger and
fuller than that of Berosus, and has several
detaih omitted both by the Bible and the
Chaiik-au historian. ThU inscription opens
up manv questions of which we Knew noth
ing previously, and it is connected with a
rumb r of other details of Chaldean his
tory ilch will be both interesting and mi
liaria! : . This is the first time any inscrip
tion been found with an account of an
event mentioned In Genesis." London

The House resumed the consideration of
the soldiers' bounty land bill of yesterday.
Mr. Dunnell of Minnesota, opposed the
bill, being unable ho said to conceive of a
b:ll more mischievous in its tendencies
and effects. Did Congress propose to satisfy
the claims of soldiers for an equalization of
bounties by giving them bounty laud war
rants which would not sell in tho market
for twenty dollars? The bill would benefit
only those who never smelt gunpowder in
defense of the country.
Mr. Townsend of Pennsylvania, opposed
the bill, and said tho soldiers of Pennsyl
vania were opposed to it, and the Grand
Army of the Kc-public at its session at
Easton, in Fobruary, 1872, had expressed
in resolutions iis disapprobation of the
provisions and principles embraced in the
bill.
Mr. Hawley also opposed the bill and
showed how unfairly and injudiciously the
bounty land system bad worked as applied
to the soldiers of the Mexican war. Mr.
Hawley calculated thit thoso soldiers got
36 millions from tbe sale cf their land war
rants, and that the actual tettlers had paid
a hundred and fifty millions foi it, the dif
ference going into the pockets of land spec
ulators. Th3 pandlng measure would
work iufinLely more unfairly than that one,
because now any one could settle on lands
under the homestead and pre-emption law.
Under this bill two million persons would"
be entitled to land scrip. If only one-tenth
of them applied in tbe year, that would
throw on the nuiket 32 million acres, and
the scrip would ordy hold good for a year.
The effect would bo that the soldier who
spent at. least ten dollars In getting his war
rant could not sell it in tho market for five
dollars. The measure would, therefore,-,
prove to be practically a fraud on the Bol
der, He held most rigidly to the policy of
preserving tho public lands for afcial sel
lers. Pennsylvania Polities Tbe Grand
Army of CormptloB.
The bill was defended by Messrs. Don
nan and Speer, when Pennsylvania politics
were brought into discussion, Speer assert
ing, relative to the resolutions of the Grand
Army of the Republic, presented by Mr.
Townsend, of Pennsylvania, and, signed by
Governor elec; Hartranft, that the organi
zation did not represent the honest soldiers
of the country, but the political soldiers and
officers, who were controlled by railroad
corporations and monopolies. He (Speer)
has been repeatedly called a liar by the Re
publican press for stating that Hartranft
signed these resolutions which do not rep
resent the soldiers of Pennsylvania. He
asked his colleague to furnish the resolu
tions of a soldiers' convention, or the letter
of a single soldier of Pennsylvania who car
ried tbe musket, in opposition to this bill.
They are the political soldiers put forward
by the politicians to win Congress for them.
Mr. Townsend replied that the conven
tion was composed of delegates chosen by
soldiers, some of whom were private sol
diers who carried the musket and knap
sack during the war.
Mr. Speer again asserted that the Grand
Army of the Republic was a semi-political
organization, run in the interest of politi
cians and of railroad corporations.
Mr. Townsend replied that it was a semi
political organization because composed of
men who were soldiers. The soldiers of
tho war were Republicans, while those of
tho rebellion were Democrats.
Excitement on the Democrat side, Mr.
Randall saying, That's not so.
Mr. Speer denounced Mr. Townsend's
statement as false in fact and disgraceful to
a representative from Pennsylvania.!
Mr. Townsend in conclusion asserted
that the rebellion was gotten up by the
Democratic party of tho South, assisted by
the moral influence of their coadjutors the
Democratic party of the North, and that
nine-tenths of the soldiers of the war were
Republicans.
After some further debate of a conversa
tional nature the bill went over at the ex
piration of the morning hour till to-morrow.
Indian Appropriation BIU Passed.
The French spoliation was postponed,

possib lity of civilizing the Indians, took

Tito Indians Fortified in a Cave. '
San Francisco, Dec. 11. The Madoc
Indians have retreated to Wright's Cave on
the Southwest side of Tule lake, Oregon,
with their children and squaws, and laid
in a good supply of provisions. The cave
is situated on a high table land and covers
about three acres under ground. The
entrance is narrow and easily guarded.
It is calculated that fifty Madoc warriors
and a number of Pitt river and Piutes are
with them fortified there. Fourteen set
tlers have been killed in the war so far.
Henry Miller was tortured to death. About
40 Madocs have been killed. Four hun
dred troops are in the field at the present
time, besides volunteers.
A party of scouts left Camp Falrchild on
Sunday but has not been heard from since.
Tbe fears are they have been killed or
captured by the savages. A decisive battle
is expected at Wright's Cave, provided the
Indians hold their position long enough.

A Shoddy Building of Aristocratic
Pretensions.
i
New Yobk, Dec. 11. Tbe fire at tie
Fifth Avonne Hotel last night broke opt
shortly after 1 o'clock, on the second flojr
of the hotel. The staircase upon which tqe
fire started was one at the back of tbe house
leading from the laundry In thebasemeitt
to the servants' rooms on the attic floofc
The flames ran rapidly up the stairway. It
wa3 a3 a chimney, there being no openlniS
from it but at the top and bottom. It ate
up the ttaircasa and charred its surround
ings. Reaching the open tpace Into which
nyms of the servants opened, it burst into
its fullest strength. The fhmes in their
progress did little or no damage until tfi?y
reached the corridor at the top, the draught
driving through the narrow passags-way,
carrying tho flames quicker and making
them more destructive a3 they went on.
They spread ever the entire extent of tbo
west wing. The wood work of the rooms
where the servants slept, immediately
caught tho flames, and soon the entire wing
was a mass of lurid flames. The flames
spread so rapidly the servants asleep in tbe
rooms at tho top of tho staircase, were over
taken, and before" assistance could reach
them were completely shut off from the
main building.
The firemen who had meantime arrived
were too late for assistance, as by this timo
tho apartments of the poor creatures wero
enveloped in flames. Snortly after one,
when it was found that numbers of persons
were missing, a police officer and a chief of
tho fire department effected an entrance by
means of an iron ladder to a room where
the people were supposed to be. Thy
there found the charred and burned bodies
of thirteen persons. Bedding and furni
ture were strewn about the room con
fused with the human remains The bodies
lay at different places from which the poor
people had tried to find means of egres.
Some had endeavored to escape through the
windows. Others in the endeavor to find
air hid fallen at the head of the staircase
The bodies of two women were half con
cealed under a bed in sn outer room where
they evidently tried to shelter tbemsslves
from the blinding, suffocating smoke and
scathing flame. When the firemen and
police got into the wing, the floors of this
room were sound, but the roof timbers
wero burned and had fallen upon the floor
iu a confused msss upon the bodies. The
water thrown from the hose was several
inches deep upon tbo floor, and was filtering
through to the ground. The heavy beams
of tho roof had fallen upon the burned
bodies, scalding limts and mutilating the
remains horribly. The bodies were speedily
removed to Bellevuo from whence to-day
they will be sent to tbe Morgue. Owing to
tbe confusion and excitement the r.atne of
tbe victims could not ba ascertained.
Up to 20 minutes past 2 o'clock twenty
two dead bodies had been recovered, sixj
teen in ore room and six in another, whlrh
is probably all. Tho alarm was first civen
by one of tho female servants, who shrieked
"Fire!" through the hall-ways, awakening
the guests, of whom there were about fi
hundred in tbe hotel. Many of the guests
went to the office and inquired as to-lhe
excitement, but were informed by the
clerks that it wa3 only a little tire in tbe
laundry. This attempt to keep the lire
quiet so as tc avoid a panif, helped to bring
about tho terrible result. When the gastti
became cognizant of their danger, tc?uf s
of confusion ensued people moving about
iu apparent distraction and bsggige filldd
the hall-way. The Bmoke was suffocating
and water drenched the floors.
It was nearly twelve o'clock before any
one gave tho al rm, and a passing police
man then learning of the fire inside, caused
th2 fire engines to come to the spot. The
fire by this time had made considerable
headway. Ladies were in a wild state of
excitement. The carpets were all covered
with water. A poor servant girl was found
on the third flocr writhing in agonies of
pain, her body frightfully burned. The
shrieks of the servants in the uppjr stories
were heart-rending as the firemen were
making their way to rescue them. Lsrgo
crowds had in the mean time gither.jd on
the streets. The excitement on the out
side kept up till abont two o'clock, when
the fire was about extinguished.
The Herald editorially cays it is stated
that gross carelessness was apparent iu tin
condition of the warming apparatus, and
that there was too much anxiety to keep
the firo secret and too little effort made to
save the unfortunate girte. The whole sub
ject will no doubt be thoroughly iuvestiga
ted. Tbe losses are estimated at from a
hundred and thirty to onehundrcdand fifty
thousand. Thtsre are various statements as
to the origin of the fire. One says it was
caused by the bursting of a steam pip In
the laundry. Some seventy or eighty ser
vants altogether were awakened from the
top floor and tbe .burned down stairs.
Their clothing was utterly ruined. A fire
man named Deany was seriously injured
by falling through a crevice to the pave
ment. The hotel furniture was worth
about four hundred thousand; fully one
fourth of this was utterly ruined. Tho
bouse is owned by A. R. Eno, but leased to
Darling, Griswold & Co.
Ju3t before the alarm a guest was assign
ed to a room which on reaching ho dis
covered to bo on fire. Returning to the
clerk he was informed there was no other
room vacant. Tho fire was not known at
this time in the office. Among tho most
prominent gassts were Gen. Burnside, Gen.
Horace Porter, G. M. Pullman of Chicago.
Soveral of the lady guests were accommo
dated In neighboring hotels and houses.
Miss Neilsontho actress was among the
lady guests. The building was so slightly
constructed that the water went through
the floors as a sieve.
At the Slorsne The Story or a Itescned
Glr;.
Large crowds of rich and poor gathered
at the Morgue this morning to ascertain tbe
names of the persons taken
there from the Fifth Avenue fire. Eleven
bodies are already at the Mogr.e. Only two
sofar are recogizablojtho others being turned
almost to a crisp. These two are Mary
McCabe and Mary Fagan, both servants.
Mary Heanoy, one of tho servants, is at
Bellevne; shs states that when tho alarm of
fire was given she knocked at nearly all the
doers of the other servants. She then tried
to get down stairs, but the smoke and
flames dtove her back, when with Mary
Turuey and Bridget Curtis she broke optn
a skylight and got on the roof, remaining
there tfll the firemen rescued them. She
will recover. Tho bodies at the Mrogue
have the appearance of having suffered
great agonies.
A Confused Account.
There is a great confusion at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel to-day; one of the proprie

hotel that only eleven persons were burned,
and these were all female servants.

spite of an injunction issued by a compe

to declare the results of the late election by
proclaiming the election of candidates for

were really defeated by many thousand
votes; and whereas the truly elected
members of the General Assembly, being
excluded from the Capitol by an armed
force placed at the disposal of the conspira

A Radical Manifesto.
A manifesto signed by Gambetta, Cie

bers of the extreme and moderate Left, is
published to-day. It demands a pacific and
legal dissolution of the National Assembly
as tbe only means of averting fresh dangers
to the country, as tha divisions in the As
sembly renders tbe government powerless.
The address expresses strong disapproval of
tne pressure now being exerted to bring
about disorder, which it has been hitherto
proved can only result in advantage to tbe
enemies of France. The new elections
will constitute a compact majority in the
Assembly, securing majorities therein to the
administration of Thiers aid for the estab
lishment of republican institutions. Tbe
right of petition to the Assembly is claimed
to be inviolable, for an attack upon it would
be an attack upon the principle of univer
sal suffrage.

YER3AILE3, Dec 11 In the National
Assembly to-day, M. Gasconde expressed
the hope that the Assembly would not dis
solve before it has insured the complete
liberation of French territory.
The Deputies of Right submitted a prop
osition assigning Saturday nex; for the dis
cussion of the petitions for a dissolution of
the Assembly.
M. Gambetta thereupon ascended tbe
tribune, and speaking with great fire and
decision, supported the proposal. He col
cluded by saying to the Right on behalf of
the Loft: Our impatience for tha discussion
equals yours.
Tha assembly adopted the motiou and
hxed the debate for Saturday amid pro
found agitation. The members of the Let:
have since expressed regret at that precipi
tation, as it is improbable that the Left cen
tre will suppoit tlie movement for a d S3a
lution which can, it is now believed, scar
cely obtained two hundred and fifty votes.

Tbo Past and tbe Present.
In the Memphis Appeal, December 10,
the editor gives this experience in traveling
between that city and Nashville:
"How strange it was in the olden time
of coach traveling to stop In the middle of
tha night to change horses. We rattled
through the dark, gloomy and deserted
street, through the open square of the mar
ket place, with its town clock dimly lighted,
looking like a swollen full moon shining
through a November fog, and pulled up at
the eld inn, where an oil lamp just made
visible tbu red sign over the square wooden
porch. Two sleepy hostlers unharnissed
the tired, recking hories,' and with a few
sleepy words between them and the coach
man as they put In tho fresh team, off wa
drove up tha long street, between the fu
'neral row of solemu, somber, unlit dwel
lings, and between scores and scores of hor
izontal humanities. Yes, on we rolled,
past hundreds upon hundreds of uncon
scions men and women, all lying tier above
tier, stretched out in the beds like corpses
buried In tho s!de3 of some vast catacomb.
Off and on wo sred, plunging soon into
tbo night of the country, where darkness
is saved from being oppressive simply by
tbe sene of space. An hour or two hence
and thwt recumbent multitnde, those thous
ands lying flat on both sidea of our drive,
will have sprung up. and thrown aside their
shroud-like cloibin., and their death-like
rest, and will be bU :ding erect, with their
feet on the grown', their heads towards
the sky, they willt ve gone forth to their
work and to their labor until the evening.

chambermaid. , This gentleman presented
