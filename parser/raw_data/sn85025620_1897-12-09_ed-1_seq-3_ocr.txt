SOME IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS
Need of Currency Legislation Point­
ed Out Spain Should Have
Chance—Unreal I Should lie An­
nexed—Oilier (llleMtiOUM.
"Washington, Dec. 6. Following Is the
text of President McKinley's message to
congress:
To the Senate and House of Representa­
tives: It gives me pleasure to extend greet­
ing to the Fifty-fifth congress assembled
at the seat of government, with many of
•whom,senators and representative, 1 have
been associated in the legislatuve service.
Their meeting occurs under felicitous con­
ditions, justifying sincere congratulation
and calling for our grateful acknowledg­
ment to a beneficent Providence which has
BO signally blessed and prospered us us a
nation. Peace and good will with all the
nations of the earth continue unbroken.
The extra session of this congrcss which
closed during July last enacted important
legislation, and while its full effect has not
yet been realized, what it has already ac­
complished assures us of its timeliness and
wisdom. To test its permanent value fur­
ther time will be required, and the people,
satisfied with its operation and results thus
far, are in no mind towlthhold from it a
fair trial.

Congress Should Not Hesitate to En­
ter Upon Revision.
Tariff legislation having been settled by
the extra session of congress, the question
next pressing lor consideration is that of
the currency. The work of putting our
finances upon a sound basis, difficult as it
may seem, will appear easier when we re­
call the financial operations of the govern­
ment since lStMi. On the 30th day of June
of that year we had outstanding demand
liabilities in the sum of $728,868,447.41. On
the 1st of January, 1871), these liabilities had
been reduced to $443,889,495.88. Of our in­
terest-bearing obligations, the figures are
even more striking. On July 1, 18ti6, the
principal of the interest-bearing debt of
the government was $2,332,331,208. On the
first day of July, 1893, this sum had been
reduced to $585,037,loo, or an aggregate re­
duction of $1,747,294,108. The interest-beur
ing debt of the United States on the first
day of December, 1897, was $847,365,620. The
government money now outstanding (De­
cember 1) consists of $346,681,016 of United
States notes, $107,793,280 of treasury notes
issued by authority of the law of 1890, $384,
963,503 of silver certificates, and $61,280,761
of standard silver dollars.
With the great resources of the govern­
ment, and with the honorable example of
the past before us, we ought not to hesl-
tate
to enter upon a currency revision
which will make our demand obligations
less onerous to the government, and relieve
our financial laws from ambiguity and
doubt.
No Urnuiid for Distrust.
Tho brief review of what was accom­
plished from the close of the war to 1893
makes unreasonable and groundless any
distrust either of our financial ability or
soundness, while the situation from 1893
to 1897 must admonish congress of the im­
mediate necessity of so legislating as to
make the return of the conditions then
prevailing impossible. There are many
plans proposed as a remedy for the evil.
Before we can lind the true remedy we
must appreciate the real evil. It is not
that our currency of every kind is not good,
for every dollar of it is good good because
the government's pledge is out to keep It
so, and that pledge will not be broken.
However, the guaranty of our purpose to
keep the pledge will be best shown by
advancing toward its fulfillment.
Civil of the I'reseut System.
The evil of the present system is found In
the great cost to the government of main­
taining the parity of our different forms of
money—that is, keeping all of them at par
with gold. We surely cannot be longer
heedless of the burden this imposes upon
the people, even under fairly prosperous
conditions, while the past four years Ijave
demonstrated that it is not only mi ex­
pensive charge upon the govt rn.iii i. but
a dangerous menace to the national credit.
Alnst Provide Aguinst lSond Issues.
It Is manifest that we must devise some
plan to protect the government against
bond Issues for repeated redemptions. We
must either curtail the ,ortunity for
speculation, made easy li. i.ie multiplied
redemptions of our demand .iligations, or
increase the gold reserve for their redemp­
tion. We have $900,000,000 of currency
which the government by solemn enact­
ment has undertaken to keep at par with
gold. Nobody is obliged to redeem in gold
but the government. The banks are not
required to redeem in gold. The govern­
ment Is obliged to keep equal with gold all
Its outstanding currency and coin obliga­
tions, while its receipts are not required
to be paid in gold. They are paid in every
kind of money but gold, and the only means
by which the government can with cer­
tainty get gold is by borrowing. It can get
It In no other way when it most needs it
The government without anv fixed gold
revenue is pledged to maintain gold re­
demption, which it has steadily and faith­
fully done, and which under the authori­
ty now given it will continue to do.
The law which requires the government
after having redeemed its United States
notes to pay them out again as current
funds demands a constant replenishment
or the gold reserve. This is especially so
in times of business panic, and when the
revenues are insufficient to meet the ex­
penses of the government. At such times
the government has no other way to sup­
ply Its deficit and maintain redemption but
through the increase of Its bonded debt, as
during the administration of rny predeces­
sor, When $262,315,400 of
4'/2
per cent, bonds
were issued and sold, and the proceeds used
to Pay the expenses of the government in
excess of the revenues and sustain the
gold reserve. While it is true that the
greater part of the proceeds of these bonds
•was used to supply deficient revenues, a
considerable portion was required to main­
tain the gold reserve. "mm
With our revenues equal to otir expenses
there would be no deficit requiring the is­
suance of bonds. But If the gold reserve
falls below $100,000,000 how will it be re
*'e"'shed eXcept by selling more bonds?
Is theie any other way practicable under
law? The serious question then is:
Shall we continue the policy that has been
pursued in the past—that is,, when the gold
reserve reaches the point of danger ifsue
more bonds and supply the needed gold or
shall we provide other means to prevent
these recurring drains upon the gold re­
serve? If no further legislation is had and
the policy of selling bonds is to be contin­
ued, then congress should give the secre­
tary of the treasury authority to sell bonds
at long or short periods, bearing a less rate
or interest than is now authorized by law.
An Obvious Duty.
I earnestly recommend as soon as the
receipts of the government are quite suf­
ficient to pay all the expenses of the gov­
ernment that when any of the United
States notes are presented for redemption
ai?d
are
adeemed in gold such notes
shall be kept and set apart and only naid
out in exchange for gold. This is an ob­
vious duty. If the holder of the United
States note prefers the gold and gets it
from the government he should not receive
back from the government a United States
note without paying gold in exchange for
It. The reason for this is made all the
more apparent when the government issues
an Interest-bearing debt to provide gold
for the redemption of United States notes—
a nonlnterest-bearlng debt. Surely it
should not pay them out again except on
demand and for gold. If they are put out
in any other way they may return again to
be followed by another bond issue to re­
deem them—another interest-bearing debt
to redeem a noninterest-bearing debt.
Indorses Secretary Game's 1'lun.
The secretary of the treasury has out­
lined a plan in great detail for the purpose
of removing the threatened recurrence of
a depleted gold reserve and saving us from
future embarrassment on that account. To
this plan 1 invite your careful considera­
tion. I concur with the secretary of the
treasury in his recommendation that na­
tional banks be allowed to Issue notes to
the face value of the bonds which they
have deposited for circulation, and that the
tax on circulating notes secured by deposit
of such bonds be reduced to one-naif orone
per..cent, per annum. 1 also join him in
recommending that authority be given for
the establishment of national banks with
a minimum capital of $20,000. This will
enable the smaller villages and agricultural
regions of the country to be supplied with
currency to meet their needs. 1 recommend
that the Issue of national bank notes be re­
stricted to the denomination of ten dollars
and upwards.- if the suggestions 1 have
herein made shall have the approval of
congress, then would recommend that na­
tional banks be required to redeem their
notes In gold.
THE! CUBAN UlIjSTIO.\.
Tho Time \ot Ripe for Intervention
on Our Part.
The most important problem with which
this government is now called upon to deal
pertaining to its foreign relations concerns
its duty toward Spain and the Cuban Insur­
rection. Problems and conditions more or
iM&Mr
less in common with those now existing
have confronted this government at vari­
ous times in the past. The story of Cuba
for many years has been one of unrest,
discontent an effort toward a
growing
larger
ger enjoyment of liberty and self-con­
trol of organized resistance to the mother
country of depression after distress and
warfare and of ineffectual settlement to be
followed by renewed revolt. For no endur­
ing period since the enfranchisement of the
continental possessions of Spain In the
western continent has the condition of
Cuba or the policy of Spain toward Cuba
not caused concern to the United States.
The prospect from time to time that the
weakness of Spain's hold upon the island
and the political vicissitudes and embar­
rassments of the home eovernment might
lead to the transfer of Cuba to a continen­
tal power called forth, between 1823 and
1860, various emphatic declarations of the
policy of the United States to permit no dis­
turbance of Cuba's connection with Spain
unless In the direction of independence or
acquisition by us through purchase: nor
has there been any change or this declared
policy since upon the part of the govern­
ment.
The Present Insurrection.
The present insurrection broke out in
February, 1895. It Is not my purpose at this
time to recall its remarkable Increase, or
to characterize its tenacious resistance
against the enormous forces massed
against it by Spain. The revolt and the
efforts to subdue It carried destruction to
every quarter of the island, developing
wide proportions and defying .the efforts
of Spain for its suppression. The civilized
code of war has been disregarded, no less
so by the Spaniards than by the Cubans.
The existing conditions cannot but fill
this government and the American people
with the gravest apprehension. There is
no desire on the part of our people to
profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We
have only the desire to see the Cubans
prosperous and contented, enjoying that
measure of self control which is the in­
alienable right of man, protected in their
right to reap the benefit of the exhaustless
treasures or their country.
The offer made by my predecessor in
April, 1896, tendering the friendly offices
of this government failed. Any mediation
on our part was not accepted. In brief, the
answer read: "There is no effectual way
to pacify Cuba unless it begins with the
actual submission of the rebels to the
mother coufitry." Then only could Lpain
act in the premised direction of her own
motion and after her own plans.
Xot Civilised Warfare.
The cruel policy of concentration was
Initiated February 16, 1896. The productive
districts controlled by the Spanish armies
were depopulated. The agricultural inhab­
itants were he'rded in and about the gar­
rison towns, their lands laid waste and
their dwellings destroyed. This policy the
late cabinet of Spain justified as a neces­
sary measure of war and as a means of cut­
ting off suplies from the insurgents. It has
utterly failed as a war measure. It was
not civilized warfare. It was extermina­
tion.
Protests Entered.
Against this abuse of the rights of war
I have felt constrained on repeated occa­
sions to enter the firm and earnest pro­
test of this government. There was much
of public condemnation of the treatment of
American citizens by alleged illegal arrests
and long imprisonment awaiting trial or
pending protracted Judicial proceedings. I
felt It my first duty to make instant de­
mand for the release or speedy trial of all
American citizens under arrest. Before the
change of the Spanish cabinet In October
last 22 prisoners, citizens of the United
States, had been given their freedom. For
the relief of our own citizens suffering be­
cause of the conflict the aid of congress was
sought In a special message, and under
the appropriation of April 4, 1897, effective
aid has been given to American citizens in
Cuba, many of them at their own request
having been returned to the United States.
Minister Woodford's Instructions.
The instructions given to our new min­
ister to Spain before his departure for his
post directed him to Impress upon that gov­
ernment the sincere wish of the United
States to lend its aid toward the ending
of the war in Cuba by reaching a peace­
ful and lasting result, just and honorable
•alike to Spain and to the Cuban people.
Those instructions recited the character
and duration of the contest, the widespread
losses it entails, the burdens and restraints
it imposes upon us, with constant dis­
turbance of national interests and the In­
jury resulting from an Indefinite contin­
uance of this state of things. It was stated
that at this juncture our government was
constrained to seriously Inquire if the time
was not ripe when Spain of her own voli­
tion, moved by her own Interests and every
sentiment of humanity, should put a stop
to this destructive war and make pro­
posals of settlement honorable to herself
and iust to her Cuban colony. It was urged
that its a neighboring nation, with large in­
terests in Cuba, we could be required to
wait only a reasonable time for the mother
country to establish its authority and re­
store order within the borders of the Island:
that we could not contemplate an indefi­
nite period for the accomplishment of uns
result.
No Humiliation SuKKested.
No solution was proposed to which the
slightest idea of humiliation to Spain
could attach, and Indeed precise proposals
were withheld to avoid embarrassment to
that government. All that was asked
or expected was that some safe way might
be speedily provided and permanent peace
restored. It so chanced that the consider­
ation of this offer, addressed to the same
Spanish administration which had declined
the tenders of my predecessor, and which
for more than two years had poured men
and treasure into Cuba In the fruitless ef­
fort to suprpess the revolt fell to others.
Between the departure of Gen. Wood­
ford, the new envoy, and his arrival In
Spain, the statesman who had shaped the
policy of his country fell by the hand of an
assassin, and although the cabinet of the
late premier still held office and received
from our envoy the proposals he bore, that
cabinet gave place within a few days there­
after to a new administration under the
leadership of Sagasta.
Spain Promises Much.
The reply to our note was received on the
23d day of October. It Is in the direction of
a better understanding. It appreciates the
friendly purposes of this government. It
admits that our country is deeply affected
by the war in Cuba, and that its desires
for peace are. just. It declares that the
present Spanish government Is bound by
every consideration to a change of policy

*LS
end.Spain
has decided to put into
effect the political reforms heretofore ad­
vocated by the present premier without
halting for any consideration in the path
which in its judgment leads to peace. The
military operations it is said will continue
but will be humane and conducted with all
regard for private rights, being accom­
panied by political action leading to the
autonomy of Cuba while guarding Spanish
sovereignty. This, It Is claimed, will result
in investing Cuba with a distinct person­
ality: the island to be governed by an ex­
ecutive and by a local council or chamber
reserving to Spain the control of the for­
eign relations, the army and navy and the
judicial administration. To accomplish
this the present government proposes to
modify existing legislation by decree, leav­
ing the Spanish cortes, with the aid of
Cuban senators and deputies, to solve the
economic problem and properly distribute
the existing debt. In the absence of a
declaration of the measure that this gov­
ernment proposes to take in carrying out
its proffer of good offices it suggests that
Spain be left free to conduct military
operations and grant political reforms
while the United States, for its part, shall
enforce its neutral obligations and cut off
the assistance which it is asserted the In­
surgents receive from this country. The
supposition of an indefinite prolongation of
the war is denied. It is asserted that the
western provinces are already well-nigh re­
claimed: that the planting of cane and to
Daceo therein has been resumed, and that
by force of arms and new and ample re­
forms very early and complete pacification
Is hoped for.
Have Mot Failed in Our Duty.
The Immediate amelioration of existing
conditions under the new administration
of Cuban affairs Is predicted, and therewith
all the disturbance an/3 all occasion for
any change of attitude on the part of the
United States. Discussion of the question
of the international duties and responsibil­
ities of the United States, as Spain under­
stands them, is presented, with an appar­
ent disposition to charge us with failure In
this regard. This charge is without any
basis in fact. It could not have been made
if Spain had been cognizant of the con­
stant efforts this government has made, at
the cost of millions and by the employment
of the administrative machinery of the na­
tion. That it has successfully prevented
the departure of a single military expe­
dition or armed vessel from our shores in
violation of our laws would seem to be a
sufficient answer. But of this aspect of
the Spantsh note it is not necessary to
speak further now. Firm in the conviction
of a wholly performed obligation, due re­
sponse to this charge has been made in dip­
lomatic course.
The Untried Measures.
Of the untried measures there remain
onlv: Recognition of the insurgency as
beli'gerents recognition of the independ­
ence of Cuba, -neutral intervention to end
the war by imposing a rational compromise
between the contestants, and intervention
in favor of one or the other party. speak
•not of forcible annexation, for that can­
not be thought of. That by our code of
.morality would be criminal aggression.
Recognition of Insurgents.
Recognition of the belligerency of the
Cuban insurgents has often been can­
vassed as a possible if not inevitable step
both In regard to the previous ten years'
struggle, and during the present war. {am
not unmindful that the two houses of con-
$rejjp in the spring
«f
1896 expressed the
oplnion by concurrent resolution that a
condition of public war existed, requiring
or justifying the recognition of the state of
belligerency in Cuba, and during the ex­
tra session the senate voted a joint resolu­
tion of like import, which, however, was
not brought to a vote in the house of repre­
sentatives. In the presence of these sig­
nificant expressions of the sentiment of the
legislative branch) it behooves the execu­
tive to soberly consider the conditions un­
der which so important a measure must
needs rest for justification. It is to be
seriously considered whether the Cuban
insurrection possesses beyond dispute the
0- statehood, which alone de­
mand the recognition of belligerency In it?

sential qualifications of sovereignty by the

President Grant in his
b1,? me,ssage
of December 7, 1S75,
?,1® ,y relevant to the present situa­
tion In Cuba and it may be wholesome now
that time a ruinous
E uu. ,ur
stiven
years wasted the
neighboring island. During'all those years
an utter disregard of the laws of civilized
warfare and of the just demands of hu­
manity, which called forth expressions of
condemnation from the nations of Chris­
tendom continued unabated. Desolation
and rum pervaded that productive region,
enormously affecting the commerce of all
commercial nations, but that of the United
States more than any other by reason of
proximity and larger trade and intercourse.
At that juncture Grant uttered these
words, which now as then sum up the ele­
ments of the problem: "A recognition of
the independence of Cuba being, in my
opinion, impracticable and indefensible, the
question which next presents Itself is
that of the recognition of belligerent rights
in the parties to the contest. In a former
message to congress I had occasion to con­
sider this question, and reached the con­
clusion that the conflict in Cuba, dreadful
and devastating as were its incidents, did
not rise to the fearful dignity of war
"It is possible that the acts of foreign
powers, and even acts of Spain herself, of
this very nature might be pointed to in de­
fense of such recognition. But now, as in
its past history, the United States should
carefully avoid the false lights which might
lead It into the mazes of doubtful law and
of questionable propriety and adhere rig­
idly and sternly to the rule which has been
its guide of doing only that which is
right and honest and of good report. The
question of according or of withholding
rights of belligerency must be judged in
every case, in view of the particular at­
tending facts. Unless justified by necessity
it is always and justly regarded as an un­
friendly act and a gratuitous demonstra­
tion of moral support to the rebellion. It
is necessary, and it is required, when the
interests and rights of another government
or of Its people are so far affected by a
pending civil conflict as to require a
definition of its relations to the parties
thereto. But this conflict must be one
which Is recognized In the sense of in­
ternational law as war.
Recognition Not Justified.
"Belligerence, too, is a fact. The mere
existence of contending armed bodies and
their occasional conflicts do not constitute
war in the sense referred to. Applying to
the existing condition of affairs in Cuba
the tests recognized by publicists and writ­
ers on international law, and which have
been observed by nations of dignity, hon­
esty and power, when free from sensitive or
selfish and unworthy motives, I fail to
find in the Insurrection the existence of
such a substantial political organization,
real, palpable ana manifest to tne
world, having the forms and capable of
the ordinary functions of government
toward its own people and to other states,
with courts for the administration of jus­
tice, with a local habitation, possessing
such organization of force, such material,
such occupation of territory as to take the
contest out of the category of a mere re­
bellious insurrection or occasional skir­
mishes, and place it on the terrible foot­
ing of war, to which a recognition of bel­
ligerency would aim to elevate It.
The contest, moreover, la solely on
land: the Insurrection has not possessed
itself of a single seaport whence it may
send forth Its flag, nor has it any means of
communication with foreign powers ex­
cept through the military lines of its ad­
versaries. No apprehension of any of
those sudden and difficult complications
which war upon the ocean is apt to pre­
cipitate upon the vessels, both commercial
and national, and upon consular officers of
other powers, calls for the definition of
their relations to the parties to the contest.
Considered as a question of expediency, I
regard the accordance of belligerent rights
still to be as unwise and premature, as re­
gard It to be, at present, indefensible as a
measure of right.
"Such recognition entails upon the coun­
try according the rights which flow from it
difficult and complicated duties, and re­
quires the exaction from the contending
parties of the strict observance of their
rights and obligations. It confers the right
of search upon the high seas by vessels of
both parties it would subjcct the carrying
of arms and munitions of war, which now
may be transported freely and without in­
terruption, in vessels of the United States
to detention and to possible seizure It
would give rise to countless vexatious ques­
tions, would release the parent government
from responsibility for acts done by the In­
surgents, and would invest Spain with the
right to exercise the supervision recognized
by our treaty of 1795 over our commerce on
the seas, a very large part of which, In its
traffic between the Atlantic and the gulf
states and between all of them and the
states on the Pacific, passes through the
waters which wash the shores of Cuba.
The exercise of this supervision could
scarce fail to lead, if not to abuses, cer­
tainly to collisions perilous to the peaceful
relations of the two states. There can be
little doubt as to what result such super­
vision would before long draw this nation.
It would be unworthy of the United States
to inaugurate the possibilities of such re­
sult, by measures of questionable right or
expediency, or by any Indirection."
What Recognition Would Mean.
Turning to the practical aspects of a rec­
ognition of belligerency and reviewing its
Inconveniences and positive dangers, still
further pertinent considerations appear.
In the code of nations there is no such thing
as a naked recognition of belligerency un­
accompanied by the assumption of interna­
tional neutrality. Such recognition will
not confer upon either party to a domestic
conflict a status not heretofore actually
possessed or effect the relation of either
party to other states. The act of recogni­
tion usually takes the form of a solemn
proclamation of neutrality which recites
the de facto condition of belligerency as
its motive. It announces a domestic law
of neutrality In declaring state. It assumes
the international obligations of a neutral
In the presence of a public state of war. It
warns all citizens and others within the
jurisllction of the proclaimant that they
violate those righteous obligations at their
own peril and cannot expect to be shielded
from the consequences. The right of visit
and search on the seas and seizure of ves­
sels and cargoes and contraband of war
and good prize under admiralty law must
under international law be admitted as a
legitimate consequence of a proclamation
of belligerency. While according the equal
belligerent rights defined by public law to
each party in our ports disfavors would be
Imposed on both, which while nominally
equal would weigh heavily in behalf of
Spain herself. Possessing a navy and con­
trolling the ports of Cuba her maritime
rights could be asserted not only for the
military Investment of the island but up to
the margin of our own territorial waters,
and a condition of things would exist for
which the Cubans within their own domain
could not hope to create a parallel while
its creation through aid or sympathy from
within our domain would be even more im­
possible than now, with the additional ob­
ligations of international neutrality we
would perforce assume.
Regarded, at Present, as Untvlse.
The enforcement of this enlarged and on­
erous code of neutrality would only be
influential within our own jurisdiction by
land and sea, and applicable by our own
instrumentalities. It could impart to the
United States no Jurisdiction between
Spain and the insurgents. It would give the
United States no right of Intervention to
enforce the conduct of the strife within
the paramount authority of .Spain accord­
ing to the international code of war. For
these reasons I regard the recognition of
the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents
as now unwise, and therefore inadmissable.
Should that step hereafter be deemed wise
as a measure of right and duty, the execu­
tive will take it.
Intervention.
Intervention upon humanitarian grounds
has been frequently suggested, and has not
failed to receive my most anxious and
earnest consideration. But should such a
step be now taken, when it is apparent
that a hopeful change has supervened in
the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new
government has taken office in the mother
country. It is pledged in advance to the
declaration that all the efforts of the world
cannot suffice to maintain peace in Cuba
by the bayonet: that vague promises of re­
form after subjugation afford no solution
of the insular problem: that with a sub­
stitution of commanders must come a
change of the past system of warfare for
one in harmony- with a new policy which
shall no longer aim to drive the Cubans to
the "horrible alternative of taking to tho
thicket or succumbing in misery that re­
forms must be instituted. In accordance
with the needs and circumstances of the
time, and that these reforms, while de­
signed to give full autonomy to the colony
and to create a virtual entity and self-con­
trolled administration., shall yet conserve
and affirm the sovereignty of Spain by
just distribution of powers and burdens
upon a basis of tuutuhi interest, untainted
by methods of selfish expediency.
zsi&L&z
Lies In Honorable Paths.
The first acts of the new government He
In these honorable paths. The policy of
cruel rapine and extermination that so
long shocked the universal sentiment of
humanity has been reversed. Under the
new military commander abroad clemency
is proffered. Measures have already been
set on foot to relieve the horrors of starva­
tion. The power of the Spanish armies, it
is asserted, is to be used not to spread ruin
and desolation, but to protect the resump­
tion of peaceful agricultural pursuits and
productive industries. That past methods
are futile to force a peace by subjugation is
freely admitted, and that ruin without con­
ciliation must Inevitably fail to win for
Spain the fidelity of a contented depend
ency. Decrees in application of the fore
shadowed reforms have already been pro­
mulgated.
Should Give Spain a Chance.
That the government of Sagasta has en
tered upon a course from which recession
with honor is impossible can hardly be
questioned that In the few weeks It has
existed it has made earnest of the sincerity
of its professions Is undeniable. I shall not
Impugn its sincerity, nor should impatience
be suffered to embarrass it in the task it
has undertaken. It is honestly due Spain
and to our friendly relations with Spain
that she should be given a reasonable
chance to realize her expectations, and to
prove the asserted efficacy of the new or­
der of things to which she stands irre­
vocably committed. She has recalled the
commander whose brutal orders inflamed
the American, mind and shocked the civ­
ilized world. She has modified the horrible
order of concentration, and has undertaken
to care for the helpless and permit those
who desire to resume the cultivation of
their fields to do so, and assures them of
the protection of the Spanish government
in their lawful occupations. She has lust
released the "Competitor" prisoners here­
tofore sentenced to death, and who have
been the subject of repeated diplomatic
correspondence during both this and the
preceding administration.
Will Xot Hesitate to Act.
Not a single American citizen is now in
arrest or confinement in Cuba of whom
this government has any knowledge. The
r.ear future 'will demonstrate whether
the indispensable condition of a righteous
peace, just alike to the Cubans and to
Spain, as well as equitable to all our In­
terests so intimately involved in the wel­
fare of Cuba, is likely to be attained.
If not, the exigency of further and other
aclion by the United States will remain
to be taken. When that time comes that
action will be determined in the line of
indisputable right and duty. It will be
faced without misgiving or hesitancy in the
light of the obligation this government
owes to itself, to the people who have con­
fided to it the protection of their interests
and honor and to humanity. Sure of the
right, keeping free from all offense our­
selves, actuated only by upright and patri­
otic considerations, moVed neither by pas­
sion nor selfishness, the government will
continue its watchful care over the rights
and property of American citizens and will
abate none of its efforts to bring about by
peaceful agencies a peace which shall be
honorable and enduring. If it shall here­
after appear to be a duty imposed by our
obligations to ourselves, to civilization and
humanity to intervene with force, it shall
be without fault on our part and only be­
cause the necessity for such action will be
so clear as to command the support and
approval of the civilized world.
ANNEXATION OF HAWAII.
Dignity and Honor Require Continu­
ation of the Treaty.
By a special message dated the 16th day
of .lune last, I laid before the senate a
treaty signed that day by the plenipo
taries of the United States and of the re­
public of Hawaii having for its purpose the
Incorporation of the Hawaiian islands as
an integral part of the United States and
under Its sovereignty. The senate having
removed the injunction of secrecy, although
the treaty is still pending before that body,
the subject may be properly referred to In
this message because the necessary action
of the congress is required to determine by
legislation many details of the eventual
union should the fact of annexation be ac­
complished, as I believe it shoud be.
While consistently disavowing from a
very early period any aggressive policy of
absorption In regard to the Hawaiian
group, along series of declarations through
three-quarters of a century has proclaimed
the vital interest of the United States in the
independent life of the islands and their
intimate commercial dependence upon this
countrv. At the same lime it has been re­
peatedly asserted that In no event could the
entity of Hawaiian statehood cease by the
passage of the Islands under the domina­
tion or Influence of another power than the
United States. Under these circumstances
the logic of events required that annexa­
tion, heretofore offered but declined, should
in the ripeness of time come about as the
natural result of the strengthening ties
that bind us to those islands, and be real­
ized by the free will of the Hawiian state.
That treaty was unanimously ratified
without amendment by the senate and pres­
ident of the republic oc Hawaii on the 10th
of September last, ana only awaits the fa­
vorable action of the American senate to
effect the complete ebsorption of the
islands Into the domain of the United States.
What the conditions of such a union shall
be, the political relation thereof to the
United States, the character of the local
administration, the quality and degree of
the elective franchise of the inhabitants,
the extension of the federal laws to the
territory or the enactment of special laws
to fit the peculiar condition thereof, the reg­
ulation if need be of the labor system
therein, are all matters which the treaty
has wisely relegated to tho congress.
Should He Conilrincd.
If the treaty is confirmed, as every con­
sideration of dignity and honor requires,
the wisdom of congress will see to it that,
avoiding abrupt assimilation of elements
perhaps hardly y^t fitted to share in the
highest franchises of citizenship, and hav­
ing due regard to the geographical condi­
tions, the most just provisions for self-rule
in local matters with the largest political
liberties as an integral part of our nation,
will be accorded to the Hawaiians. No
less is due to a people who, after nearly
five years of demonstrated capacity to ful­
fill the obligations of self-governing state­
hood, come of their own free will to merge
their destinies in our body politic.
CEXTRAL AMERICAN REPU1JL1CS.
Our Diplomatic Relations with Them
-XirarnKiian Canal.
As to the representation of this govern­
ment to Nicaragua, Salvador and Costa
Rica, I have concluded that Mr. William L.
Merrick, confirmed as minister of the
United States to the states of Nicaragua,
Salvador and Costa Rica shall proceed to
San Jose, Costa Rica, and there temporarily
establish the headquarters of the United
States to those three states. I took this
action for what I regarded as the para­
mount interests of this country. It was
developed upon an investigation by the
secretary of state that the government
of Nicaragua, while not unwilling to re­
ceive Mr. Merrick in his diplomatic quality,
was unable to do so because of the com­
pact concluded June 20, 1895, whereby that
republic and those of Salvador and Hon­
duras, forming what is known as the
greater republic of Central America, had
surrendered to the representative diet there
their right to reveive and send diplomatic
agents. The diet was not willing to ac­
cept him because he was not accredited to
that body. I could not accredit him to
that body because the appropriation law
of congress did not permit It. Mr. Baker,
the present minister at Managua, has been
directed to present his letters of recall.
The Xleuraicuun Canal.
A subject of large importance to our
country and Increasing appreciation on the
part of the people is the completion of the
great highway of trade between the At­
lantic and Pacific known as the Nica
raguan canal. Its utility and value to
American commerce is universally admit­
ted. The commission appointed under
date of July 24 last "to continue the surveys
and examinations authorized by the act
approved.March 2, 1895," in regard to "the
proper route, feasibility and cost of con­
struction of the Nicaragua canal, with a
view of making complete plans for the en­
tire work of construction of such canal,"
is now employed in the undertaking. In the
future I shall take occasion to transmit to
congress the report of this commission,
making at the same time such further sug­
gestions as may then seem advisable.
MONETARY COMMISSION.
Unable to Secure Satisfactory Re­
sults from Its Labors.
Under the provisions of the act of con­
gress approved March 3, 1897, for the pro­
motion of an international agreement re­
specting bimetallism, 1 appointed on the
l-)th day of April, 1897, Hon. lidward O.
Wolcott, of Colorado Hon. Adlai B.
Stevenson, of Illinois, and Hon. Charles J.
Paine, of Massachusetts, as special en­
voys to represent the United States. Thev
have been diligent In their efforts to se­
cure the cooperation of European countries
in the international settlement of the ques­
tion, but up to this time have not been
able to secure an agreement contemplated
by their mission. The gratifying action
will be laid before congress. Our special
envoys have not ttaade their final report, as
further negotlatons between the repre­
sentatives of this government and the gov­
ernments of other countries are pending
and In contemplation. They believe that
doubts which have been raised In certain
quarters respecting the position of main­
taining the stability of tne parity between
the metals and kindred questions may yet
be solved by further negotiations.
RECIPROCITY.
Steps Taken to Improve Trade Kelatlons
With Other Countries.
In order to execute as early as possible
the provisions of the third and fourth sec­
tions of the revenue act approved July
24, 1897, I appointed Hon. John A. Kas
son, of Iowa, a special commissioner pleni­
potentiary to undertake the requisite nego­
tiations with foreign countries desiring to
avail themselves of these provisions. The
negotiations are now proceeding with sev­
eral governments, both European and
American. It is believed that by a careful
exercise of the powers conferred by that
act some grievances of our own and of
other countries in our mutual trade rela­
tions may be either removed or largely
alleviated, and that the volume of our com­
mercial exchanges may be enlarged, with
advantage to both contracting parties.
THE SEAM.
Progreaa of Negotiation Looking to Their
Better Protection.
The efforts which had been made during
the two previous years by my predecessor
to secure better protection to the fur seals
in the Northern Pacific ocean and Behring
sea, were renewed at an early date by
this administration and have been pursued
with earnestness. Upon my invitation the
governments of Japan and Russia sent
delegates to Washington and an inter­
national conference was held during the
months of October and November last,
wherein it was unanimously agreed that
under the existing regulations this species
of useful animals was threatened with ex­
tinction and that an international agree­
ment of all the interested powers was
necessary for their adequate protection.
The government of Great Britain did not
see proper to be represented at this con­
ference, but subsequently sent to Washing­
ton, as delegates, the expert commission­
ers of Great Britain and Canada who had
during the past two years visited the
Pribylof islands, and who met in confer­
ence similar commissioners on the part of
the United States. The result of this con­
ference was an agreement on important
facts connected with the condition of 'the
seal herd, heretofore in dispute, which
should place beyond controversy the duty
of the governments concerned to adopt
measures without delay for the preserva­
tion and restoration of the herd. Negoti­
ations to this end are now in progress the
result of which I hope to be able to report
to congress at an early day.
INTERNATIONAL. ARBITRATION.
The Subject Deman}s''Due Considera­
tion by Congress.
International arbitration cannot be omit­
ted from the list of subjects claiming our
consideration. Events have only served to
strengthen the general views on this ques­
tion expressed in my inaugural address.
The best sentiment of the civilized world
is moving toward the settlement of dif­
ferences between nations without resort­
ing to the horrors of war. Treaties em­
bodying these humane principles on broad
lines without in any way imperiling our
interests or our honor shall have my con­
stant encouragement.
OCR NAVY.
Present Condition Well Adapted to
Our Necessities.
The present immediately effectiveness of
the navy consists of four battle ships of the
first class, two of the second and 48 other
vessels, ranging from armored cruisers to
torpedo boats. There are under construc­
tion five battle ships of the first class, 16
torpedo boats and one submarine boat. No
provision has yet been made for the armor
of three of the five battle ships, as it has
been impossible to obtain it at the price
fixed by congress. It is of great importance
that congress provide this armor, as until
then the ships are of no fighting value.
The present naval force, especially in view
of its increase by the ships now under con­
struction, while not as large as that of a
few other powers, is a formidable force
its vessels are the very best of each type
and with the increase that should be made
to it from time to time in the future, and
careful attention to keeping It in a high
state of efficiency and repair, it is well
adapted to the necessities of the country.
The great increase of the navy which has
taken place in recent years was justified by
the requirements for national defense and
has received public-approbation. The time
has now arrived, however, when this in­
crease, to which the country is committed
should, for a time, take the form of in­
creased facilities commensurate with the
increase of our naval vessels. It Is an un­
fortunate fact that there is only one dock
on the Pacific coast capable of docking our
largest ships, and only one on the Atlantic
coast, and that the latter has for the last
six or seven months been under repair and
therefore incapable of use. Immediate
steps should be taken to provide three or
four docks of this capacity on the Atlantic
coast at least one on the Pacific coast and
a floating dock on the gulf. This is fhe
recommendation of a very competent
board, appointed to Investigate the sub­
ject. There should also be ample provision
made for powder and projectiles, and other
munitions of war and for an increased
number of officers and enlisted men. Some
auditions are also necessary to our navy
yards for the repair and care of our larger
number of vessels. As there are now on
the stocks five battleships of the largest
class, which can not be completed for a
year or two, I concur with the recommen­
dation of the secretary of the navy for an
appropriation authorizing the construction
of one battleship for the Pacific coast,
where at present there is only one in com­
mission and one under construction, while
on the Atlantic coast there are three in
commission and four under construction
and also that several torpedo boats be
authorized in connection with our gen­
eral system of coast defense.
of.
our great sister republic of France In join­
ing this country in the attempt to bring
about an agreement among the principal
commercial nations of Europe wliereby a
lixed and relative value between gold and
silver shall be secured, furnished assur­
ance that we are not alone among the
larger nations of the world in realizing
the international character of the prob­
lem and in the desire of reaching some
wise and practical solution of it.
The British government has published a
resume of the steps taken Jointly by the
French ambassador in London and the
special envoys of the United States, with
whom our ambassador at London active­
ly cooperated in the presentation of this
subject to her majesty's government
Thto
ALASKA.
Material Changes In Territorial Lawn
Are Necessary.
The territory of Alaska requires the
prompt and early attention of congress.
The conditions now existing demand mate­
rial changes in the laws relating to the
territory. The great influx of population
during the past summer and fall and the
prospect of a still larger immigration in
the spring will not permit us to longer
neglect the extension of civil authority
within the territory or postpone the es­
tablishment of a more thorough govern­
ment. A general system of public sur­
veys has not been extended to Alaska and
all entries thus far made in that district are
upon special surveys. The act of congress
extending to Alaska the mining laws of
the United States contained the reserva­
tion that it should not be construed to put in
force the general land laws of the country.
By act approved March 3, 1891, authority
was given for entry of lands for town
site purposes and also for the purchase of
not exceeding 160 acres then or thereafter
occupied for purposes of trade and manu­
facture. The purpose of congress as thus
far expressed has been that only such
rights should apply to that territory as
should be specllicallly named.
As it Is to the interest of the govern­
ment to encourage the settlement of the
country and Its duty to follow up its citi­
zens with the benefit of legal machinery,
I earnestly urge upon congress the estab­
lishment of a system of government with
such flexibility as will-enable it to adjust
itself to the future areas of greatest pop­
ulation.
Relief Is Needed.
The startling though possibly exagger­
ated reports from the Yukon river coun­
try of the probable shortage of food for
the large number of people who are win­
tering there without the means of leaving
the country are confirmed in such measure
as to justify bringing the. matter to the
attention of congress. Access to that
country in winter can be had only by the
passes from Dyea and vicinity, which is
a most difficult and perhaps an impossible
task. However, should these reports of the
suffering of our fellow-citizens be further
verified, every effort at any cost should be
made to carry them relief.
THE INDIANS.
Needs of White Residents In the Ter­
ritory Must Be Considered.
For a number of years past it has been
apparent that the conditions under which
the five civilized tribes were established
in the Indian territory under treaty pro­
visions with the United States, with the
right of self-government and the ex­
clusion of all white persons from within
their borders, have undergone so complete
a change as to render the continuance of
the system thus inaugurated practically
impossible. The total number of the five
civilized tribes„as shown by the last census,
is 45,494, and this number has not material­
ly increased, while the white population is
estimated at from 200,000 to 250,000, which,
by permission of the Indian government,
has settled in the territory. The present
area of the Indian territory contains 25,
694,564 acres, much of which is very fer­
tile land. The United States citizens re­
siding in the territory, most of whom have
gone there by invitation or with the con­
sent of the tribal authorities, have made
permanent homes for themselves. Numer­
ous towns have been built in which from
GOO to 5,000 white people now reside. Valu­
able residences and business houses .have
been erected In many of them. Large busi­
ness enterprises are carried on In
which vast Sums of money are em­
ployed, and yet these people, who
nave Invested their capital In the develop­
ment of the productive resources of the
country, are without title to the land they
occupy and have no voice whatever in the
government either of the nations or tribes.
Thousands of their children who were born
in the territory are of school age, but the
doors of the schools of the nation's are shut
against them and-what education they get
Is by private contribution. No provision
for the protection of the life or prlwerty,
of these white citizens is made by the
tribal governments and courts.
An Indian Aristocracy.
The secretary of the Interior reports that
leading Indians have absorbed great tracts
of land to the exclusion of the common peo­
ple and government by an Indian aristoc­
racy has been practically established, to
the detriment of the people. It has been
found Impossible for the United States to
keep Its citizens out of the territory and
the executory conditions contained In
treaties with these nations have for the
most part become impossible of Execution.
Nor has it been possible for the tribal gov­
ernments to secure to each individual
Indian his full enjoyment in common with
other Indians of the common property of
the nations. Friends of the Indians have
long believed that the best interests of the
Indians of the five civilized tribes would
be found in American citizenship, with all
the rights and privileges which belong to
that condition.
The Dawes Commission.
By section 16 of the act of March 3, 1893,
the president was authorized to appoint
three commissioners to enter into negotia­
tions with the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chicka­
saw, Muskogee (or Creek) and Seminole na­
tions, commonly known as the Five Civ­
ilized Tribes in the Indian territory. Brief­
ly, the purposes of the negotiations were
to be: The extinguishment of tribal titles
to any lands within that territory now
held by any and all such nations or
tribes, either by cession of the same or
some part thereof to the United States or
by allotment and division of the same in
severalty among the Indians of such na­
tions or tribes respectively as may be en­
titled to the same, or by such other method
as may be agreed upon between the sev­
eral nations and tribes aforesaid, or each
of them with the I'nited States, with a
view to such an adjustment upon the basis
of justice and equity as may, with the con­
sent of the said nations of Indians, so far
as may be necessary, be requisite and suit­
able to enable the ultimate creation of
a state or states of the union, which snail
embrace the lands within said Indian tei-
The commission met much opposition
from the beginning. The Indians were
very slow to act, and those in control mani­
fested a decided disinclination to meet
with favor the propositions submitted to
them. A little more than three
years
after
this organization the commission effected
an agreement with the Choctaw nation
alone. The Chlckasaws, however, refused
to agree to its terms, and as they have
a common interest with the Choctaws in
the lands of said nations, the agreement
with the latter nation could have no.ef­
fect without the consent of the former.
On April 23, 1S97. the commission effected
an agreement with both tribes—the Choc­
taws and Chlckasaws. This agreement,
it is understood, has been ratified by the
constituted authorities of the respective
tribes or nations parties thereto, and only
requires ratification by congress to make
it binding. On the 27th of September, 1S97.
an agreement was effected with the Creek
nation, but It is understood that the na­
tional council of said nation has refused
to ratify the same. Negotiations are yet
to be had with the Cherokees, the most
populous of the Five Civilized tribes, and
with the Seminoles, the smallest In point
of numbers and territory.
I concur with the secretary of tne Interior
that there can be no cure for the evils en­
gendered by the perversion of these gr^at
trusts excepting by their resumption by
the government which created them.
THE PACIFIC RAILWAYS.
Should Government Become a Bidder
for Ihe KniiHiiH Pacific
The Union Pacific railway, main line,
was sold under the decree of the United
States court for the district of Nebraska
on the 1st and 2d of November of this year.
The amount due the government consisted
of the principal of the subsidy bonds, $27,
236,512, and the accrued interest thereon,
$31,211,711.75, making the total indebtedness
$58,448,223.75. The bid at the sale covered
the first mortgage lien and the entire mort­
gage claim of the government, principal
and interest.
The sale of the subsidized portion of the
Kansas Pacific line, upon which the gov­
ernment holds a second mortgage "Leo,
has been postponed at the instance of the
government to December 16, 1897. The debt
of this division of the Union Pacific railway
to the government on November 1, 1897.
was the principal of the subsidy bonds,
$6,303,000, and the unpaid and accrued in­
terest thereon, SS.'EG,690.33, making a total
of $12,929,690.33. The sale of this road-was
originally advertised for November 4, but
for the purpose of securing the utmost
public notice Of the event it was postponed
until December 16 and a second adver­
tisement of the sale was made. By the
decree of the court the upset price on the
sale of the Kansas Pacific will yield to
the government the sum of $2,500,000 over
all prior liens, costs and charges. If- no
other or better bid is made this sum is
all that the government will receive on Its
claim of nearly $13,000,000. The government
has no information as to whether there
will be other bidders or a better bid than
the minimum amount herein stated. The
question presented therefore is whether
the government shall under the authority
given it by the act of March 3,1887, purchase
or redeem the road in the event that a
bid is not made by private parties covering
the entire government claim.
To qualify the government to bid at the
sales will require a deposit of $900,000, as
follows: In the government cause $500,000,
and in each of the first mortgage causes
$200,000, and in the latter the deposit must
be in cash. Payment at the sale is as
follows: Upon the acceptance of the bid,
a sum which with the amount already
deposited shall equal 15 per cent, of the
bid: the balance in installments of 25 per
cent., 30 40 and 50 days after the confirma­
tion of the sale. The lien on the Kansas
Pacific prior to that of the government
on the 30th of July. 1897, principal and Inter­
est amounted to $7,281,048.11. The govern­
ment, therefore, should it become the high­
est bidder, will have to pay the amount of
the first mortgage lien. I believe that under
the act of 1887 it has the authority to do
this, and in absence of any action by con-,
gress, I shall direct the secretary of the
treasury to make the necessary deposit as
required by the court's decree to qualify
as a bidder and to bid at the sale a sum
which will at least equal the principal of
the debt due the government but suggest,
In order to remove all controversy, that an
amendment of the law be Immediately
passed explicitly giving such powers and
appropriating in general terms whatever
sum Is sufficient therefor.
In so important a matter as the gov­
ernment becoming the possible owner of
railroad property which it perforce must
conduct and operate, I feel constrained to
lay before congress those facts for Its
consideration and action before the con­
summation of the sale. It is clear to my
mind that the government should not per­
mit the property to b&Rold at a price which
will yield less than one-half of the prin­
cipal of its debt, and less than one-fifth of
its entire debt, principal and interest.
But whether the government, rather than
accept less than its claim, should become a
bidder, and tnereby the owner of the prop­
erty, I submit to the congress for action.
CIVIL SERVICE.
Distinct Advance Made In Operation
of the Law.
The Important branch of our government'
known as the civil service, the practical
improvement of which has long been a sub­
ject of earnest discussion, has of late years
received increased legislative and execu­
tive approval. During the past few
months the service has been placed upon
a still firmer basis of business methods
and personal merit. While the right of our
veteran soldiers to reinstatement in tie
serving cases has been asserted, dismissals
for merely political reasons have been
carefully guarded against, the examina­
tions for admittance to the service en­
larged and at the same time rendered less
technical and more practical and a dis­
tinct advance has been made by giving a
hearing before dismissal upon, all cases
where incompetency is charged or demand
made for the removal of officials in any of
the departments. This order has been made
to give to the accused his right to be heard,
but without in any way impairing the
power of removal, which should always be
exercised in cases of inefficiency and in­
competency, and which is one of the vital
safeguards of the civil service reform sys­
tem, preventing stagnation and deadwood
and keeping every employe keenly alive
to the fact that the security of his tenure
depends not on favor, but on his own test­
ed and carefully watched record of service.
GOVGRNMGNT EXPKXSES.
Appropriations Must Be Kept Within
the Receipts.
I am forced by the length of this message
to omit many important references to
affairs of the government with which con­
gress will have to deal at the present ses­
sion. They are fully discussed in the de­
partmental reports, to all of which I invite
your earnest attention. The estimates of
the expenses of the government by the
several departments will, I am sure, have
your careful scrutiny. While the con­
gress may not find it an easy task to reduce
the expenses of the government, it should
not encourage their Increase. These ex­
penses will, in my judgment, admit of a
decrease in many branches of the govern­
ment without injury to the public service.
It Is a commanding duty to keep the ap­
propriations within the receipts of the gov­
ernment and thus avoid a
deficit.
WILLIAM M'KINLEY.
Executive Mansion, December 6, 1897.
HOW PUBLIC MEN LIVE.
Hotel Managers Look Upon Them
as Legitimate Prey.
Very Few Statesmen Succeed In Liv­
ing Within Their Congressional
Incomes—Some Notable
exceptions.
[Special Washington Letter.]
It costs money to live in this city, and
nobody knows it better than senators
and members of the bouse of represent­
atives.
It may be new to you, but it is an old
etory here, that Statesmen are legit­
imate objects of predation, and our
hetelkeepers and boarding house land­
ladies make as much money out of
them as they possibly can during the
congressional sessions.
For example, in the leading hotels,
for room, and board which could be ob­
tained for an ordinary everyday citi
cen and his wife for $100 per month,
SENATOR NELSON.
(One of the F'ew Men Who Do Not Care for
Swelldom.)
they make a senator or a representative
for himself and wife pay anywhere
from $300 to $500 per month. They be­
lieve that senators and representatives
are rich men anyway, and that each of
them ought at least spend his salary of
$400 per month while he remains here
in his official capacity.
Strange as it may appear, the states
men appear to coincide *ith the hos­
telry robbers. They kDow very well
that it is not fair to be taxed so much
for the mere privilege of existing in
Washington, but they find that all peo­
ple engaged in the business charge ap­
proximately the same price, and hence
theyt submit like lambs led to the
slaughter.
During the two weeks preceding the
opening of congressional session the
legislators begin to arrive at the capi­
tal, and it is creditable to these states­
men that a majority of them are ac­
companied by their "wives and children,
although it is exceedingly expensive to
maintain families here
The men in public life who come
•without their wives, as a general thing,
do not last long. They fall into evil
ways, get into the habit of handling
cards and cut glass, and thereby lose
sleep, while at the same time they lose
their self-respect and soon cease to be
on speaking terms with themselves.
But that is another story. We want just
now to talk about their living expenses.
Very few men in public life save any
money out of their official salaries. As
a general thing senators and repre­
sentatives spend more money than they
receive from the government. Not only
is the cost of boarding exorbitant, but
the disposition to "put on airs," particu­
larly among the ladies, costs many hun­
dreds of dollars.
Senator Knute Nelson, of Minnesota,
is one of the few men who do not care
for expensive appearances There are
few men like him. Be wants official so­
ciety to take him for what be is, with­
out any tinsel veneering. When he was
a member of the house of representa­
tives be was frugal and careful. For
several years he lived here alone in a
quiet boarding hcuse and left bis fain­
tly in the Minnesota home. Thereby he
saved a little of his salary, but finally
left congress of bis own volition be­
cause he could not afford to remain in
public life. Now that he is in the sen­
ate he is living just as quietly and un­
pretentiously.
Senator Allison, of Iowa, lived for
several years in the hotels of Wash­
ington, but that was 35 years ago. For
many years he has occupied the resi­
dence of his late mother-in-law, Mrs.
Grimes, and has lived there prudently
and with comparative frugality.
Senator Cockrell, of Missouri, lives
as modestly in Washington as he does in
his Missouri home, and bis family is
likewise unpretentious. By careful
economy Senator Cockrell has managed
to buy a bouse on street, more than
two miles frony the capitol building
and, although be is well advanced in
years, be frequently walks from bis
house to the capitol to save street cat
fare. Ijut there are few men who are
so economical and saving. However,
that is the only way for a public man
to live within bis means.
Senator Brice, of Ohio, paid $25,000 a
year for the rent of a magnificent resi­
dence, but Brice is a millionaire and
can afford to spend money that way if
he wants to do so. Moreover, inasmuch
as Brice began life as a barefooted or­
phan and made all of his money out of
his own brains, liberal-minded people
do not begrudge bim bis princely lux­
ury. While he was in the senate he
gave away more than double his salary
in charities.
Senator Banna has been paying at
tb^rate of nearly $1,000 a' month for
apartments in a prominent hotel ever
since he came to live here as a states­
man, but he also is a very rich man. and
his senatorial salary of $5,000 a year is
a mere bagatelle to him. We poor peo­
ple. however, who are obliged to work
in our various capacities to keep the
wolf from the door cannot help looking
•with envious eyes on the men who can
make money enough to spend money in
that grand manner.
Senator Turpie, of Indiana, the man
who succeeded Benjamin Harrison in
the senate, has always been a very un­
pretentious man in the social world,
and hence his living has not been very
expensive. But, if it had been, he
could hav£ met all bills, for he makes a
great deal of money as a lawyer. Al­
though he has not made any effort at
display as an expensive liver. Senator
Turpie has been a prominent figure in
the senate, and has spoken learnedly
and eloquently, upon all important
topics. As a matter of fact, it makes
very little difference whether a man
dines on. canvasback dnck or on ham
and eggn provided be ia an earnest, sin­
cere man, who does the best be can
with tfie gifts showered upon him by
all-wise Providnece.
When President McKinley was a mem­
ber of congress he had apartments in a
hotel here, but because of his promi­
nence in affairs .he was given compara­
tively cheap rates. You see, in this,
city, the hotel men would rather take
a man like McKinley or Tom Reed to
board for almost nothing than let him
go to some other hotel, because such
men draw others to them like
a magnet.
Lots of men with money, who can pay
any sort of a price for hotel accommo­
dations, will go to a hotel where Reed,
McKinley and similar men stop, and
hence the hotel proprietors make spe­
cial rates for distinguished guests.
Senator Mason, of Illinois—bright,
brainy,
rotund and jolly "Billy Mason"
as his friends still term him—has
brought his family with him, and will
keep house. During his several terms
as a member of the house of representa­
tives Senator Mason lived here with his
family. He is a home-loving man, and
home-loving
men are generally coun­
try-loving, patriotic men.
Senator Spooner, of Wisconsin, has
taken a residnece here, and will have
his family with him. When he w?as in
the senate before he lived in a pretty
little palatial place on Capitol hill, very
near the big marble building in which
all national legislation is framed and
fashioned. He is a successful lawyer
and business man, and will never hear
the wolf at the door hence he can af­
ford to live in ease, comfort and luxur3r.
Senator McMillan, of Michigan, is a
millionaire, and he owns a splendid
residence in the northwest section of
the city, where our richest people live.
Although he has been a business man
all of his life and has made a fortune
out of his own head and hands be is a
polished gentleman, a wise legislator
and a genial, companionable gentle­
man. His residence here is often
thrown open to the public, because the
receptions given are on a generous scale,
and Senator McMillan believes that a
public man belongs to the public.
Senator Burrows, of Michigan, has
rented a modest little house on Massa­
chusetts avenue, where he will reside
with his wife during the session of
congress. Senator Burrows was a mem­
ber of the house of representatives for
20 years, and yet when he was elected
to the senate be was a poor man. He is
now unable to make any social displays,
but plods along the pathway of states­
manship with decorum and dignity.
Senator Gear, of Iowa, has been in
public life for 40 years or more, and he
is a poor man to-day. He does not live
in a hotel, but has small apartments in
a comfortable house, where he lives in
unpretentious quietude with his de­
voted wife. They have been traveling
life's pathway together for nearly half
a century, and they are inseparable
companions. Mrs. Gear rides to the
capitol every day with ber husband, and
she says that she is prouder every day of
"Old John Henry" and more fond of
him..
Senator Thurston, of Nebraska, lives
at the Arlington hotel. He has only
been a member of the senate for two
years, and has already become dissat­
isfied with the position. He announces
that he will not be a candidate to suc­
ceed himself, because he cannot afford
to spend his time in legislating He ia

and Luxury.)
successful men in his profession. But
as a member of the senate be cannot
consistently represent corporations,
and hence be has lost his law practice.
He cannot live on his salary as a sen­
ator, and therefore is losing money all
the time.
Chairman Dingley, of the committee
on ways and means Senator Frye, of
Maine Congressman Dolliver, of Iowa
Congressman Boutelle, of Maine Con­
gressman Hilborn, of California Con­
gressman Johnson, of North Dakota,
and Congressman Perkins, of Iowa,
form a very interesting and happy fam­
ily at a modest little hotel, and there the
wives of the chummy statesmen have
also become chummy, and they hold de­
lightful public receptions during the
congressional sessions. But public re
ceptions do not begin here until after
the president holds his New Year's re­
ception, which is the grandest affair of
the year and the opening of the social
season. SMITH D. FRY.
Ample Provocation.
"1 understand you pounded the man
in the next flat?"
"Pound him! Well, 1 should think
1 did. I nearly killed the scoundrel."
"What was the trouble?"
"He insulted me—actually insulted
me with deliberation and'malice afore­
thought and it was no trifling insult,
either."
"What did he say?"
"He asked me if 1 was the man who
played the cornet every night."
"Why didn't you kill him?"—Chicago

Asked the Boy Too Hack.
A boy who had been up for an
examination in Scripture had ut­
terly failed, and the relations be­
tween him and the examiner had
become somewhat strained. The
latter asked him if there were any
text in the whole Bible he could quote.
He jpondered and then repeated: "And
Judas went out and hanged himself."
"Is there any other verse you know in
the Bible?" the examiner asked.
"Yes. 'Go thou and do likewise.'
There was a solemn pause and the pro
c-eedings terminated.—Catholic Stand­
ard and Times.
Bis Request.
The Court—You were riding 20 milea
as hour, sir.
The Scorcher—I admit it, and would
you please add to your report that I
have ridden as high as 50 milea an hour?
