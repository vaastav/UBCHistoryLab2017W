A Prophecy of the Pacific Coast.
Twenty years hence nearly all the
breadstuff's lor export from the I'nitcd
States will be produced in the country
west of the Kocky Mountains. The
exception will be the surplus production
of corn in the Mississippi Valley. Ohio
h:is ceased to be a great wheat-producing
Stale. This crop is yearly dimin
ishing in Illinois; in Minnesota, the
production this year was only about as
much as in California, where we had
one of the dryest seasons ever known.
The agriculture of all the vast region
west of the Kocky Mountains is still in
ils infancy. Some of the great territo
ries are not yet producing breadstuff's
enough for home consumption. That
was true of Oregon a few years ago.
Now there is i large fleet of wheat-laden
ships sailing from her principal port
every year. I 'tali Territory, with the
exception of a little spot about Salt Lake,
made no show of agricultural products.
Now the best potatoes found west of the
Mississippi Kiver are found ia I'tah, and
sent over to California in large quanti
ties for consumption. Fruit-cul'.ure has
been pushed beyond the Sierra. The
great apple-orchards will be far up the
mountains on either slope. The culture
of the grape and 'the wine interest will
probably be west of the Sierrsv, although
it is just possible that we have not yet
found the best soils for the production
of wine grapes. Hie maximum of
lumler production has already been
reached in the States east of the Mis
sissippi. The eastern timber belt has
been explored, and most of the lands
reduced to private possession. The
timber belt of the Pacific coast, north of
Oregon, covers an area clear up to the
north limit of Alaska, or as far as the
climate will permit. No impression has
been made upon the forests of Alaska,
and the timber resources of Washing
ton Territory will last a long time.

There must have been thirty couples

African origin. The leader sang the
song while the rest joined the monot

around within a circle that was dancing
to the tune of

Christinas in Norway.
! The great festival of the year in Nor
j way, as among all Germanic nations, is
i Christmas. Whether it owes all its
I sanctity to its association with the birth
j of the Saviour is, however, an open
i question ; for many customs still kept
! alive in the remoter valleys seem to
I point beyond the beginning of theChris-
tian era, to the time when the Norse
! men ate horse-flesh in honor of Odin
and Thor and Frey. The festival is as
yet strongly tinctured with reminis
cences of the old pagan Yule. Tracing
the character of Christ and his apostles
as they appear in many popular march
rn and legends, the conclusion lies near
that the people have, consciously or not,
transferred much that was dear to them
in the old gods to the new deity, and
thus, by a sort of compromise between
the old faith and the new, have pro
duced a divine type which is, at all
events, sufficiently national to appeal
strongly to their Norse hearts. The
preparations for the Yule-tide, in the
way of provisioning the house, would,
to American eyes, look perfectly enor
mous. Baking and brewing and butch
ering keep the whole household busy
during the la.st three" weeks preceding
the festival. And the fact that the pro
cess is repeated year after year probably
proves that it is necessary. Every man,
woman or child who comes within a
stone's throw of the house during the
holidays (which last until a week after
New-year) must be invited in and urg
ed to eat without regard for comfort.
Even the birds are to have their share
of the Christmas joy. As soon as the
church-bells have 44 rung in the feast"
at 5 o'clock in the afternoon of Christ
mas Eve, the father of the house takes
his richest sheaf of oats or barley and
attaches it to the end of a pole, which
is nailed to the gable of the barns or
the store-houses. The mother and the
children stand by, enjoying the sigiit of
the happy birds fluttering around the
sheaf, while the father will perhaps
quote the passage about God's care even
for the sparrow, wherefore it is right
that the sparrow too should rejoice on
the day when Christ was born. Among
the many evening visitors who are sure
to drop in to taste the Christmas orew,
some are apt to be disguised by gro
tesque masks, and otherwise fantasti- j
cally accoutercd. Thee are called
Yule-bucks, possibly because the most
common mask may have been that of a I
"oat or some other norned creature.

A CHRISTMAS PLrH-riDDIXG.
By the common consent of Christen
dom, good eheer is a part of the great
religious festival which is now npon us,
and high among all Christmas roastings
and bakings, Christmas pics, cakes, aud
confectionery, iu grand pre-eminence,
like the lordly chief of an illustrious
tribe, stands the Christmas plum-pudding.
To compound, ore pare, and cook
plum-pudding is a piece of culinary and
confectionery art which can not be done
by a novice, lo uo mis worn properly
requires experience, sum, ana taste.
Mr first remark i-s that the materials
of this dish must all be of the very best.
Mediocre poetry, it is admitted, is no
poetry at all. To partake of a plum
pudding is a fruition of the prayer,
44 Give and preserve to us the kindly
fruits of the earth, that in due time we
may enjoy them," and to attempt to
compose one of ingredients of an in
ferior quality, instead of worshiping
the bounty of Providence, is so far to
bring it into contempt. Cheap and
poor materials here are equally offensive
to piety, good taste, and the laws of di
gestion. We now proceed with the work iu
hand as a practical operation :
Stone 1 pountl of bloom raisins; wash
and clean 1 pound of currants; mince
fine 1 pound of best beef suet; mix with
this in a large pan 1 pound of stale
bread-crumbs and 4 pound of flour;
beat together, in another pan, C eggs,
and mix with these about pint of
milk : pour this over the suet and the
flour; stir and beat the whole well to
gether; now add the currants and
raisins, seasoned with 1 ounce of cin
namon, 4 ounce of ginger, a
gr.ited nutmeg, a teaspoonful of salt,
and 4 pound of sugar. (The above
may be made still richer by introducing
more sugar and eggs.) Chop up line 6
ounces of candied citron, 1 pound of
almonds, and 2 ounces of preserved
lemon-peel ; pour in a glass of best Cal
ifornia brandy.
Plum-pudding is boiled either in a
cloth or in an ornamental mold tied up
in a cloth. In cither way it requires
time. Rome was not built in a day,
and a high piece of art like a plum-pudding
requires at least 6 hours to boil.
It is important to keep in mind that a
plum-pudding is in some respects like a
duck it likes to swim, and to do this it
requires plenty of room It should be
boiled, therefore, in a large pot; ar.d
this should contain pleuty of water. A
small pot and shallow water are its ab
horrence. The proof of this will appear
in the eating of it. The boiling also
should not be spasmodic now rapidly
and now slowly the boiling should be
brisk, and this briskness should be kept
up equably to the end.
To the novice and uninitiated it would
appear to be a very simple" and easy
thing to take the pudding out of
the bag without breaking it. This is
not so. This part of the process re
quires as much dainty manipulation as
to land a salmon-trout, when you have
caught him on your hook. To take the
pudding out of the bag, and yet to pre
serve its form wholly uninjured, you
must first immerse the whole in a bag of
cold water. The office of the cold water
is to chill and solidity the surface, so
that it may part smoothly from its cloth
covering. Place it in a basin of the
same size as the pudding, so that it will
just receive and hold it. Untie the cl Jin
ami lay bare the pudding to the edge of
the basin. Place upon it (upside down)
the dish in which it is to be served.
Invert dish, pudding, bag and all, so
that the pudding may rest, right side
up, on the dish. Lift off the basin, re
move the cloth, and there is your plum-
pudding in all entirety and plumptitude,
"whole as the marble," and as appetiz
ing and beautiful as so much manna
from heaven.
Plum-pnddingmay be baked as well
as boiled. This is a good device when
you are short of time ; for while it re
quires G hours to boil the pudding, it
may be baked in 2 hours. When bakeTl
it must be done in a mold. Before
pouring the ingrediants of the pudding
into the mold let the inside of the mold
be well buttered.
Whether you bake your pudding or
boil it, the following is an axpedient
which will greatly improve its excel
lence: Prepare and mix joit materi
als 24 hours before you begin to cook,
and let them stand for this length of
time untouched. - In this way each will
permeate all the others more fully, and
secure more of their perfect blending of
all the various juices and flavors which
it is the object of the entire process to
bring about.
I may add here, that time is the es
sence of all good cookery, and those
ladies and gentlemen make a great mis
take who, in their orders, hurry to
cook. Whether boiling, baking, or
roasting, lapse of time is of the essence
of the chemistry of the operation, and
patience is part of the price of excel
lence. Proceed we now to compound a nec
tar for this ambrosia the sauce :
Put into a small saucepan two ounces
of the best quality of butter; to this add
a large tablespoonful of flour; mix these
well together while they are cold with a
spoon a spoon made of wooL Pour
in half a pint of cold water, and add a
little salt. Place these over a tire and
stir until they have nearly (not quite)
reached the boiling point. Now add a
glass of best California or Catawba
brandy, some fine sugar (don't spoil it
with coarse sugar), a little cinnamon,
and the grated peel of half a lemon
Make the sauce hot, and sprinkle a dash
of cinnamon on the top.
Now pour over it a small quantity of
best California or Catawba brandy ; set
this last on tire on the dish, and then
serve iu a blaze of glory. James W.
Parkinson, in the Philadelfjh a Press.
A curious case as to the rights of the
finder of lost property, whose owner is
unknown, is reported from Rhode
Island. The plaintiff bought an old
safe and offered to sell it to the defend
ant, lhe defendant would not buy it,
but agreed to take it and sell it if he
cculd, using it himself in the meantime.
While it was thus in his possession, he
found a roll of bank bills inside the
lining. No one knew to whom they be
longed. The defendant therefore con
cluded to keep them. The plaintiff, np
on learning of the discovery of the
t . ii.i .
money, demanded ine return oi ine saie
iu.st as it was when delivered. The de-
1 fendant returned it, but without the
bank bills; whereupon the plaintiff sued
for their value as money found, lhe
Supreme Court held that the finder was
entitled to retain the property as against
the party who put the safe into his hands
for sale ; and the authorities generally
maintain the right of the finder, in this
class of cases, as against all persons ex
cept the real owner.

hot that, at one time, it looked as though
the scamp would be hang to the nearest

k Youvg Man From Keokuk Takes
Smoke.
It was on a Burlington and Cedar
Rapids train. The tall passenger, when
he got on, was in that happy frame of
mind that docsnt care whether Con
gress is in session or not. He held on
to the railing very carefully as he climb
ed into the smoking-car, and appeared
to be a little annoj etl at being the object
of general attention. He ceased to
smile and assumed an expression of
profound thought and dignity.and back
ing into a seat with great deliberation,
sat down in a man's Tap. He got up in
some confusion, and when he shot into
the adjoining scat, he straightened him
self np and assured himself that it was
unoccupied by carefully feeling all over
the cushion with his hands. He then
made an elaborate apology to the wrong
man for silting down in his lap, and cast
a stern, but withal an unsteady glance
up and down the car, to reproach or.
repress the smiles that were going
round.
For he was not the kind of a man to
be laughed at. He was well dressed and
had a certain air of dignity about him
that, under ordinary circumstances,
would command respect. He sat still
for a few moments and then took off his
hat and hung it up a few inches outside
the rack, and was apparently amazed
to see it reach the seat before ho did.
Presently the entrance of the train boy
bearing a box of the soothing Indian
weed, reminded him of something, and
he dived into his vest pocket and brought
forth half a dozen matches, and theu he
dived into an inside coat pocket for the
other materials necessary to a comforta
ble smoke.
He had great difficulty at the very
outset, biting off the end of his cigar.
He was a little undecided, to begin with,
which end to bite off. He turned it over
and over in his lingers and looked at
this end and that, but finally came to a
decision and acted upon it promptly. It
was a little tough, but he chewed
away at it manfully anil persistently and
got It off at last. Then he spit the end
tieixely against the window, and when it
just struck against tho clear glass in
stead of going clear through, he looked
foolish, and rubbed it off with bis hand
kerchief. His smoking did not progress very
rapidly. He couldn't make the old
thing work. It wouldn't light we'd. It
didn't seem to draw, and his agonized
grimaces, as he jnillod and sucked at it,
were enough to make a snake laugh.
But nobody in the car dared laugh very
loud, for every time the tall passenger
heard a titter, he would pause, and
holding the smoking material in one
hand the burning match in the oilier,
and glare around the car in the mos
forbidding manner, until the titter''
ceased, or the match burned his f"';
He soon burned up all the match
had, and then, casting hisees'J
for some one of whom to borrow a iU
he spied the train-boy, smoking Z
volcano, and beckoned him up.
44 Giuuue a light, young man, if yo
please," he said
44 Light?" demanded the astonished
monopolist, 44 light? What ye want a
light for?"
44 For my e-c-cigar," replied tke tall
passenger, with great gravity.
Smothered laughter went up all
around the ear, and the train-boy, drop
ping into a seat in his hysterical excite
ment, threw up his hands, and fairly
shouted,
44 Cigar? Oh, bloody Nero, that is a
banana you're a tryin' to smoke!"
The tall passenger bent a glance of
calm contempt upon the shouting boy
and the writhing passengers that filled
thecarwithan oppressive silence, and
then, in tones of conscious and superior
wisdom he said,
44 An' don't I know that, young man?
Of c-c-course it is. I n-never s-s-smoke
any other kind. It's a genuine han'
made imported banana, an' doa' you
forgiz it."
Then the passengers threw their hats
fiercely on the floor, and climbed up on
the backs of the seats and in one wild
maddening howl of laughter, lilted tho
roof clear off the car. Burlinyton

k Xew Core for Diphtheria.
Dr. E. N. Chapman of Brooklyn pro
fesses to have found an antidote for
diphtheria in alcohol and quinia, by
which the percentage of deaths is re
duced to less than 1 in 50. Alcohol, lie
claims, neutralizes the diphtheritic
poison, sets free the nerves of animal
life, subdues the fever and inflammation,
destroys the pabulum that sust tins the
membrane, cuts short the disease, con
quers the sequela1, and shields other .
members of the family from aa attack.
Like any other antidof, it must be giv
en promptly at the outset, or otherwise
