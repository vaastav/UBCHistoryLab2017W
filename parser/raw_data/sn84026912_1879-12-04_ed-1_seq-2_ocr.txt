President's Message.
Tho annual message of President Hoyes
found ?ts way surreptitiously to tho press
boforo tho meeting of Congress. Tho
message is long, and without striking
foatures. Thc President refers briefly to
tho successful execution of tho resumption
act, the coinage of gold and silver, tho
withdrawal of grce nba oks from cit cul at ion,
restoring tho tax on sugar aud coffee, tho
suppression of polygamy, a pica for freo
und untrammelled elections for mom bets of
Congross and President, tho advuntuges of
civil service reform, tho impoitanco of
appropriations for judicial expenses, eulogiz
ing tho facilities of tho dcpnitincrt of agri
culture, tho completion of tho Washington
monument and minor topics usual iu such
state papers.
The Markets.
Tho Charleston Netti and Courier says that
a fair amount of business was dono last week
in tho leading lines of consumption and trade is
generally on a healthy and sound basis. Thc
Iransaolions wcro mostly in tho chief articles of
food and olothiug, with some inquiry for goods
suited lo tho holiday season, which latter will,
no doubt, soon bo in activo demand. Tho mar
ket has exhibited but little change for thc food
staples, and prices for thom rulo about thc same
as previously. The business in tho chief South
ern products bas bceu active and values exhibited
a fair amount of firmness, willi some fluctua
tions, wliile th ero is a good prospect of prices
being sustained throughout thc season. Tho
receipts of cotton at all tho ports in the United
States up to November 28 was 2,098,072 bales.
Samo timo last year 1,091,512; ?arno time in
1877, 1,470,231. Tho crop of Ibis year has
certainly been hurried to market.
Tho Keoweo Courier.
Although tho KKOWEK COURIER was started in
May, 1849-just thirty years ago-thc lust Issuo
of that paper announced tho beginning of tho
fifteenth volume. Tho KKOWKG COURIER since
Colonel Thompson went into ellice in 1853 has
been ono of tho ablest aud most conservative
papers in tho State, und wc always feel (L<at ive
aro not far wrong when wc havo tho endorse
ment of such a jost ami discriminating paper as
tho K-OWKB Count EU. Tho peoplo of Oconce
should support their County paper most liberally,
and tho merchants of Walhalla, SeucoaCity and
Westminster should not neglect to do themselves
and tho paper good by advertising in it. Tho
present proprietors aro not wholly unknown to
our people. Colonol Thompson and Mr. Smith
were onco printers at Abbeville, und Colonel
Keith has a reputation for valuable services to
the State. The KKOWKECOURIER should always
live aud prosper.-Abbeville Press and Banner.

Tho Lunatic Asylum,
Of Columbia, under tho fostering caro of thc
Stalo, should bo visited by all our peoplo who

last Legislature, has added and is still making
many improvements to this noblo institution;
A largo wooden building, neat and comfortable,
has been creatod during tho year within the
walls on tho malo side, containing about eighty
rooms with appurtenances. To this building tho
colored females, who formerly occupied a portion
of tho building now occupied by tho whito
fomalo patients, have been curried. Another
largo building is in course of orcction for tho
colored pooplo and will bc oomplotcd no doubt
during tho next year. Tho wants and necessary
comforts of tho colored inmates aro amply pro

as it relates to our looal interests or tho pub

ticos wero given of tho following bills:
Senator Crittenden gavo notico that on to

an amendment to tho Constitution relating to

benefits of n homestead exemption equally tc
all classes of citizens.
Senator Livingston-A bill to amend an

Senator Ktuslor-A bill to altor and amend

Mr. Taft, ltadioal Senator from Chnrloston,
introduced tho following resolution in refor
once to convicts hired by tho Stato to work or
quasi public roads:
Whereas it appears that a fearful mortality
has prevailed during tho past season amongst
tho convicts lensed from the penitentiary, ant
Whereas it id alleged that such mortality
has resulted in a great measure from tho in
sufficient and unwholesome food, impropei
clothing, ill ventilated lodging and crue
treatment inflicted on its victims; and
Whereas it is futthor alleged that no in
quest lins been taken of any ono of tho mun]
causal or violent deaths which hnvo tukoi
placo amongst them; and
Wheroaa it is tho duty ol tho General As
sombly to provide for tho redress of griov
anees and for tho prevention of thoir continu
anco and repetition, particularly in tho casi
of thoso who, being restrained of their libert
by law, aro unable themselves to apply to th
authorities of the law for relief and proteo
tion; therefore, bo it
Jicsolved by tho Sonata, tho House of Kop
resontatives concurring, That a committd
of three on thc part of tho Soneto and -
on tho part of tho House of Representative

tho circumstances attending tho deaths wilie
Lnivo taken place amongst thc convicts lease
from tho penitentiary during tho proser

Directors of thc penitentiary he, and thc
hereby aie, requested not to biro ont any coi

Thero appears to bo some cause of con
plaint as to thc treatment of convicts on tl
Greenwood and Augusta Railroad, and if s
this should bo investigated and Oorrooted, b
wc think thc plan of hiring them out shou
not for that reason bo abandoned They a
fed and clothed by thc Stato at 0 heavy e;
r uso to tho tax payers, and wherever tl
expense can bo saved it should bo dono. T
resolutions look moto of a political cast tin
anything else.
In thc Senate a bill to provide for the hoi
ing a convention for the purpose of rcvisi
thc State Constitution was made tho speci
ordor for December 1st at I P, M.
lu tho House a joint resolution was pass
by a largo majority fixing tho 23d of Deeei

school claims in a number of counties, arno
thom Oconco County. Wo understand tin
aro several thousand dallar., duo the teaolu

this should in somo way be provided fur.
Several bills havo also been introduced

On Friday, in tho Sonata, tho rosolul
from tho IIouso to adjourn sine die was 1

Among tho bills introduced was ono
Mr. Livingston to appoint a committee
examino into tho condition of tho Stnto C
stitution and roport amendments. This i
oxact nccordnnco with our viows, and
o' /ried out, will savo tho Stnto much liti

A bill to inforco tho uso of a uniform se
of text books in tho free schools was panso
a tliird reading. We approve to some oxtont
tho purposes of tho aot, but if those book*
aro to bo oolcotod by a State Board, composed
of four or iivo impraotloables, thea we want
no such law. Tho frequent chango of teit

Mr. Crittenden, Democrat, introduced tho
following concurrent resolution, which, with
tho resolutions of Tuft, woro made tho epe

In tho House, several bills have been intro

and other papers required by law to bo re

On Friday, among thc reports of commit'
toes, tho House Judiciary Committco reported
unfavorably on tho proposed chango in thc
law of bastardy, as follows:
On tho presentment of tho grand jury ol
Richland County in relation to bastardy, thc;
top'irt that tho subject has ofton been consid
ered by tho Legislature and the law is sub
stnntiully what it has been foi years. Thii
is u wrong which springs more from weak In
diligence than from criminal intent. It ii
thought not to bo good policy to mako tut
many offenses punishnbls with linc and im
prisonment. The law now contains provis
ions to relieve, thee ninty from tho support o
bastards. Thc committco n*k to be dis
oh urged from thc further consideration of tin
subject. A gleed to.
We are glad to noto this, for the bastard;
is in its operation a premium (or prostitution
It was intended to save tho county lin rmi es
for thc support of bastards, but it never dil
and under tho homestead law. never can eflec
this. It often leads to perjury in oidor t
wrest money from a poison nblo to pay, nm
tho money is never used for ibo benefit of th
offspring, but rather to bedeck a dissolut
woman to lead others astray. Instead c
making tho law ol bastardy moro stringoill
it ought lo bo repealed or be made a ci iminc
o (fu n co ns to both father and mother, punish
able by fine and imprisonment, none of wine
fine should go to tito mother.
On tho bill to prevent and punish the car
rying of concealed weapons, thc same com
inittee reported as follows:
Unfavorably on bill to prevent tho narry
ing of concealed or deadly weapon*; mi th
presentments of tho grand jurie? ol' Loxin?:
ton und Richland Counties, rel ? ting lo th
usc of deadly weapons, and ask to bo dis
charged. Agreed to. On this bill and (hes
presentments the ootnmitteo report that it i
a very bad practico lo carry deadly weapons
but it is ono whioh cnn bo better corrected b
public sentiment than by positive enactment'
It is il i Hie H lt to pass any law to correct it tin
would not too much abridge tho liberty of iii
citizen. They concur in thc opinion ox
pressed by tho Governor that additional law
are not necessary, but rathor a stronger er
forcement of those already in oxitoonec. An
inasmuch as no specific plan is suggosto
whereby to remedy tho evil, they mk to I
discharged.
As yet hut little has been accomplished, i
tho first week is spent in cutting out an
preparing business. We will try to keep on
rendors posted, as well as wc can, from tl;
reports of our exchanges.
On Saturday a large number of bills tiri
joint resolutions, relating to local mutter

A spoolal dispatoh to the Ne wa and Courier
on thia '.subjoot of dato No vombor 29th and
80tb says:
Coi,UM nr A, Novombor 29.--Tho discussion
of tho watter of tho election of a Chief Juss
tico in tho House to-day brought the subject
more prominently into notice than evor, and
tho ooutoat is beginning to beoome warm.
! Little or no doubt TB entertained of Molver's
ol oct ion, but as to what is to oome next,
everybody is apparently nt sea. It is ovon
intimated that Chief Justico Willard eau
establish tho claim that ho was elected for a
term of six years, and so check all action. In
tho event of the election and elevation of
Judge Mcivor, there will undoubtedly bo u
bard tight over tho succession. Qovernnr
Simpson's friends claim that bis chances aro
tho best and probubly this is true, just now,
tho opposition hoing divided among no less
than six or eight gentlomon. When tho
weaker ones drop away, howevor, and conc?n*
tration takes place, it is impossible to toll
what proportion will bo attracted to tho re
spective survivors.
CotUMniA, November 30.-Tho oxoitomont
on the eubjeot of the Chief Justiceship is
increasing, and tho air is thick with rumors.
Chief Justice Willard oin i rn s that his oleotion
?although in terms for tho unoipired torin of
udgo MONOS) entitles him to bold office for a
full term of six yenrs, and it is said that be
is determined to maintain that position. In
tho even u that a successor shall bo eleotod by
tho Legislature Judge Willard will louve it tn
that judgo-elect to obtain the office of Chiof
Justico by quo warranto. Tho qoostion at
issuo would bo determined by tho Supremo
Court. Judgo Willard being nn intorosted
pnrty could not sit at tho hearing, and Asso*
oiato Justico Mcivor is a candidato for Ohio!
Justico und most likely would bo tho claim
ant. Tho judges to (111 tho Court to hear tho
oiiso would bo appointed by tho Governor, but
tho Governor is a candidato for tho Supremo
Hench tn (111 tho vacancy to bo caused by
Judge Mclver's promotion.

Tho following article, from tho Atlanta,
Constitution, is tho most interesting of tho
many which have appeared in that journal on
tho Clcmont Attachment and kindred sub
j eels:
A few days ago a gentleman entered thc
Constitution office and introduced himself ax
Mr. Fred Gutes, of New Ihoria, La. Mr.
Gutes stated that ho lind rend tho article on
tho Clcmont attachment mill, copied from the
Constitution into somo Western papers, and
that ho bud visited Georgia for tho purpose
of investigating tho little mill. Ho stated
that if ho was pleased ho would in vost nt
once in tho mills. Ho went on to explain
that bo now had in operation at New Iberia
a cotton seed oil mill, that cost $25 000, and
said that if ho could got a fow Clement at
tachments ut work in front of his oil mill bc
would thon bo able to hundi? tho cotton from
tho Held ul) the way through to yarri and oil.
Mr Gatos talked so intelligently on tho sub0
ject, mid seemed such ii fair and capable man,
that wo asked hi ai to call by ut tho Constitu

On yesterday Mr. Gales returned from
Westminster. Ho had spent a day or two nt
tho mill and bad studied it from ovcry stand
point. Ho bud gone over tho books, thu mill
mid thc correspondence. Hu had examined
for himself and had questioned others, und
when ho entered our office said ho hud made
all the investigation that be cared to make,

"Aro the seed as good for fertilizers nftf

''Thoro is n groat wasto, then, in not ex

"Certainly. Tlioro ls a waste of $12 a too.
I got $12 worth of oil out of ovory too of
cotton seed, and tlion leave tho sood quite as
vnluablo for feed und-fertilizers as (hoy wore
boforo tho oil was expressed. With ovory
ton of seed tborcforo thrown on tho land
before they aro put through tho oil mill wo
throw away $12."
"Doos the process of extracting the oil
pay?"
"It has paid mc about 60 por cent. That
is, I mean, that I buy a ton ot cotton seed at
$8. I got out of that ton of socd $12 worth
of oil. It pays mc n olear profit of $5 a ton,
for ovory ton of seed I work. It is acknow
ledged by all who know anything of tho busi?
ness, that tho oil peed mill business is tho
most lucrativo manufacturing business in tho
South. It has grown very rapidly whore it
has over bcon started. In New Orleans,
for instance, ?hero le $^,000,OOO invostcd in
oil seed mills, and tifo cotnp'vnios controlling
them report tho most satisfactory results.
All over Louisiana tho farmers send their
seed to tbeso mills and get $10 a ton for it,
thoy paying froight, so that it nots tho far
mer about $8 a ton."
"ls tho demand for tho oil and the seed
cakes steady?"
"?Steady and growing. Tho oil cnn be
sold in infinito quantity und tho seed oakes
aro exported or sold nt homo just as rapidly
as they can bo mado. I soil all I have to tho
{armors right around mo."
"Why is it that oil sood mills arc not more
frequent throughout tho South?"
"Just because our pooplo uro not progres
sive and enterprising. Many of them donut
havo the money, and those that have it nro
afraid to trust it in any now investment.
They will not even trust their own sense,
Why, when 1 quit tho law and wont to build
a $25,000 oil mill in tho country I was the
laughing stock of tho parish. Sumo of
my neighbors thought I could do nothing
with it, but^ I went about quietly,
because I know it would pay. I hud only
about $8,000 in cash, but 1 went into it with
u $25.000 machine. I havo now paid out and
havo ti surplus with which to begin with tho
Clement nttnehment. I run my oil seed mill
night and day. Sicco it has demonstrated
itself, I could got enough capital from my
neighbors to put up a half dozen cotton seed
oil mills. When I go buck homo thoy will
laugh ut mc just tho sumo about tho Clement
mills, but when I get tho thing to work I
will show thom thnt I know what I am
about."
' In running your machines, how many
men will you employ?"
"I employ now sixtoon pooplo in my Oil
mills, that is two sets of bunds. In my Clo*
ment, attachment I will need say twonty moro.
1 should say in tho two processes about thir
ty-live bands."
. How many does it take to grow tho cotton
thai you would use?"
"I will uso 400 bales a year. It would
take about fifty bunds to raise that much "
.' Then it would givo employment to nearly
dimble tho number of people now engaged in
growing tho cotton, to run it through Clement
attachments and oil sood mills?"
"Yes, sir; if all tho cotton was spun into
yarns and nil tho seed ground into oil und
mild<> into C ikes, it WOUld givo employment
to twice as many people as aro now oiuployed
in crowing tho crop.
M What viilne do you add to tho seed?"
"I double its value. I mean by that every
ion thal goes through my mil! brings moro
than double thu m .nev that is yielded by u
tun mn ground np. There urn 1,000 pounds
?if i-ecd colt-II to every hule nf lint, or one lou
to every r-wo bair-'. Tho crop is 5,000,000
bales, which would givo us 2,600,000 tons of
cotton ?oed The oil mills get $10 out of
every ton of ibis that is ground up, w Idell
$10 is wasted in overy other ton. If tho
whole 2.60O OOO tons were gained wo should
have added tu our cotton seed n value of
$'22.500,000. By running through ibo de
nicul mill we double tho vah?o of tho lint
colton. Ca . ci op of 5 000.OOO bales is worth ut
$50 a halo $200 000 000. By spinning it
through tho Clement mills wc would add ll
value of $250,000 000."
"These splendid result? would be achieved
then if every neighborhood would bo fur
nished us yours would be?"
"Yes. And if lhe.-e chances existed in
New England thoy would not lio open ono
y?-nr. The thrifty Yunkees would not sec
this wuste in their staple crop po on moro
than a singlo season. Tho South, though,
muy consent to submit to it indefinitely. As
fur a- I um concerned, I do not claim lo bc
moved by any pal ri-il iu consideration?, I
wen' into thc oil t-ced mill boca il se I knew it
Would pay I nm going into the Clement
mills for ibo same reason und for that reason
only. 1 never took ymir word for what I
read. I knew 1 could learn moro in an hour
than I could read in a woek."
And this is precisely what tho Constitution
advises every man to do. It hus always
asked that no man luke its views ns conclu
sivo, but ?hat every mun should see for him
self.
Til K CURRENT OF INVESTIGATION.
There is not a day that pussos but what
Home ono calls at tho Constitution olhco to
I give, his views us to tho little mill All
j ol asses of mon call, but they have only one
I report to make. Wo havo novcr yet mot n
j single person who hus examined ibo mill
I that hus bad anything hui a favorable report
1 to moko. Wo havo lo died o iroe-tly for such
' a report thal we might publish. Wo po.
Headed a doze n poi111 cine n to go with us and
examino tho mill; their views hnvo been
given.
! A short time ago Mr. Appleyard, certainly
! competent authority, haying boco a spinner
j for many year", anil a veteran in maunhielu

he gave, alter his visit, to -:r. Israel Putnam,

Air, Putnam Informaos.
N.-xt week Colonel J. W. Robertson, thc
Pre-idonl ol tho Roswell m a mi fa 11 ii ing
0 .mpany. is going up tn Westminster lorn
OIOKO examination of tito mill, with a view of
investing largely. We shall pim his views
upon his return. In tho meantime if any
visitor sees anything thal he deems unfavora
ble in tho mill, we ?hall bo pleu-ed lo havo
his opinion nod will publish it conspicuously.
Wc want to pivo tho ?bolo truth.
TIIK I'ROORBsS ?P TIIK "BOaM."
In tbi meantime tho interest in the attach
ment i? spreading. Tho pooplo of Amenons
uro moving in the direction of a stock ciunpa
1 ny Mr ll. P. Almond is arran iring to put
np a double mill ut C.inver* Wu know rd'
two that will bo put up near Marietta and
tho interost is universal over this and adjoin?
ing Stntos.
There muy bo somn tronido, as snpgested
by Mr Oute?, that Mr. Siribling will not bo
uhlo to furnish I lioso mill.-, us rapidly as (hov
uro needed next sumiller. Wo know nothing
of his arra II gonion ts beyond ibo fuot ?hut he
roccives a percentage on all Miles (hut ho
: makes. What this porccntago is, wboro bo
I hiiB hia machinery mado, or how rapidly bo
??w*|-Mfe.M?j?i?n>iiM?L>iw'iilwA\ii?i'itwui?iii ? Hmimmmgmm^m
can Iiavo it mndo, wo <?o not know. ,Wo
heard ?rom him that ho was trying to maka
arrangements with a Macon firm to ninoufao'
turo thcso ratlU. Whethor ho succeeded or
not wo oannot say. Ho is quito an on orge tip'
man, and doubtless knows what ho is about.
Thero ore two or throo partios in Atlanta
who wish to go ioto tho business with him,
and some of (hom aro now corresponding
with him. Ifsuitablo arrangements can be
perfected, a mill with a framo or so of opta
dlos will bo put up in a storo in tho oity of
Atlanta, and tho mill bo run dally, so that
visitors ui.-.y soo procisoly what it does with*,
out going to Wostmiubtor. lt is great
raistako that tho litt o mill is loontod on a
branch away out of eight of tho railroad.
Still tho pooplo ooo timm to find it out. Thora
aro visites ovory day and usually in pretty
good squads. Wo should fool satlsflod with '
our work if wo seo Qfty of these mills nt work
lu Goorala in timo for tho noxt crop. And,
in tho meantime, wo should Uko to seo an
oil ?cod mill put np in Atlanta. Thero is'
ono in Selma and ono in Montgomery, but
nono in Georgia. Why should not wo have
ono hore?
A MACHINIST'S .OPINION.
Mr. J. It. Howoll, who is known throughout
tho StntO UK a practical and experienced
machinist, paid a visit to tho Westminster
mill, and says: "I think it ls u grunter inven
tion than wc ?hall bo willing to admit, X
examined it carefully and found it simple and
more edici?n', than I had expected. It is,"
bound to elle et a great work fur tho South.
If it did nothing, else but save tho clipping
and chopping of tho Qbro it would bo a great
machino. 1 endorso it in tho strongest man?
nor, and I shall prOpaio a full statomont ?
concerning it at my earliest leisure." The
statement of Mr. Howell will be important,
as ho is ono of tho best mill and machinery
men in tho country.
In addition to this interview, tho Conslitu*
tion says that Mr. Gatos glvos us sumo inn
strnotivo figuros on tho working of ootton
seed through oil mills. Ho shows that tho -
grinding of tho soed doublos ihn vnluo of
every ton that is ground, and that it dotrnots
nothing (Vom tho value out of thom. A pret
tier formula oannot bo found than that by
which cotton seod arc worked. Tho oil is ;
expressed from tho seed-tho su bataneo of tho
seed is prossod into seod euko and sold-tho
hulls aio used for fool ami tho nslios from tho
bulls is sold for fertilizing purposes. There
is absolutely nothing wasted. It looks ino
erodible that u prosperous und intelligent
pooplo will allow year alter year tho oil in
thu cotton seed to go to waste, especially
when of the $1*2 worth taken from a ton fully
$5 is clear profit to the man who taken it. lt
is a safo and lucrativo businoss, and $8,000,?
O0U aro invested ih it in tho city of Now
Orleans ulonu. Outsido of that oity tbero aro '
four oilier mills. Io tho Statu of Georgia I
thero ia not ono. Wo havo monoy enough to '
build tiloso mills-cntorpriuo enough-but
somehow ur other tho old spirit of non?pro? '
gi ess hangs about our pooplo, and biadoi'o .
them from their own enrichment.
It is tho curso of tho South that she cul
tiva ICM loosely, produces irregularly aud
wastes half that she produces. In tho ono
item of cotton, if sho would only spiu it.
with these Clement milli and g ..iud the seed'
with oil mills she would double tho value of
thc Hut, double thu value of tho
seed, und give employment to noirly
double thc number ot people uow
employed in planting aud raising tho
crop. if our people would only en
courage thesv,' two industries-if our capi
talists would ouiy g<> into such investments
-if our hw mers would only club together
and ott blish them in thu neighborhoods
if our mechanics would form o? operativo
oomp'itiies, ?nd build them - wo should soon
regain the enormous WCullh wo lost with
our aluvca and tho South would becoino
richer than her most sanguino son can hopo
for. All general movements aro made up
of special efforts.
At a recent meeting of tho farmers of
Cross Anchor, Spartnnburg County, hold on
tho 15th instant, tho foUuwiiig resolution was
adopted:
Jicaolocd, That promiscuous hiring ont of
Penitentiary convicts is detrimental to the
peuce and good order of society, and that if
tho Sta'o desires a revenue from such a
source they should be put lo work on rail
roads and other public improvements whore
they eau bo properly guarded and tho
?ludo people benefited thereby.

A stont backbone is as essential lo physical
health as to political consistency. For weak
ness of thc buck and disorders of tho livor and)
kidneys, t li o Ionio and moderate dietolio notion
of the liittors is tho one thing needful. Ro
moinbor that tho stomach is tho mainstay of
every oilier organ, and that by invigorating
thc digestion by this preparation, the spinal\
