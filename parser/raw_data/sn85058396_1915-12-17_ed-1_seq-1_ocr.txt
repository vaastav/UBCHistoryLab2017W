tal. The SerbianH report that the suf
ferings of their people during the re
.treat of the army before the invaders
were indescribable.
Italians at Avlona.
Paris, Dec. 17, 4.: 55 a. m. The Milan
correspondent of the Journal says it
ia estimated there are 40,000 Italian
troops at Avlona, Albania. While the
.Avlona position is hardly favorable
for an offensive movement, he says,
the expedition may be regarded as the
starting point of operations on a large
ecalo.
Many Prisoners Taken.
Marseilles, France, Dec. 17, 4:55

Further Credit for France.
Paris, Dec. 16, 6 p. m. (Delayed)
In the course of his demand in the
chamber of deputies that the chamber
grant three months' credit on the
M budget account, Alexandre E.
Ribot, French minister of finance,
stated that the subscription to the
recent French national loan from Lon
don alone was 600.000.000 francs. At
another point in his speech M. Ribot
stated that while the war expenditure
at the beginning of tho conflict waa
1,500,000,000 francs per month, it was
not 2,100,000,000 francs.
Serbs Capture 40 000 Men.
More than 40,000 men captured by
the Serbians have reached Marseilles
on their way to a concentration camp,
a despatch from the French seaport
states.
Further particulars regarding the
Italian force sent to Albania state thai
the number of men already landed at
Avlona is 40.000.
The Cettlnje war office admits a
further retreat by the Montenegrin
troops in the Sanjak region wjhere they
have beeu resisting the -Austrian ad
vance. While no figures are available aB to
the total amount subscribed to tho
French war loan, it is declared by Fi
nance Minister Ribot that the number
of subscribers was without precedent.
The subscriptions from London alone,
he stated, amounted to $120,000,000.
Review of War Situation.
London, Dec. 17, 12:40 p. m. With
affairs in Greece assuming a quieter
character there has been a partial de
flection of interest In European cap
itals to the Italian plans regarding Al
bania. The general belief seems to be that
tho operations in this new theatre of
war will be on a grand scale. The
Italians, in strength, are already safe
ly ashore at Avlona as well as at cer
tain new points of strntegic import
ance. For years Avlona has been regard
ed by Italy and Austria alike as the
key to the Adriatic and it is a maxim
In south central Europe that who
ever commands Avlona commands
the Adriatic. Avlona has been for sev
'eral months occupied by a light force
of Italians for police purposes.
Italians Covet Good Harbors.
The anxiety with which Italians re
gard the Albanian coast Is due to the
fact that there are good harbors in
contrast to the total absence of good
harbors along the Italian shore. Should
any of these harbors fill in hostile
hands the Italian fleet would be great
ly handicapped. Italy is expected to
contribute greatly to the reorganiza
tion of the Serbian army which is
now concentrating' in Albania, where
its ranks are being reformed and sup
plies landed by the allies during the
past fortnight distributed.
Stubborn fighting has been In prog
ress between the Serbians and Bulgar
ians along the Drin in Albania.

ABYSSINIA WILL
AID THE ALLIES
French Government Urged to
Seek Immediately the Co
operation of Abyssinian
Troops.
Paris, Dec. 17, 11 a. m. Dldj Jeas
su, tho emperor of AbysBlnla, is so
favorably disposed toward the entente
allies that he not only resisted ef
forts of German agents to induce him
to abrogate treaties with Great Brit
ain, Italy and France last year, but
offered 200.000 soldiers to be used by
tho allies as their military necessi
ties demanded, according to Pierre
Alype, a member of the colonial com
mittee of the chamber of deputies.
M. Alype made this assertion In
connection with the resolution now
before the foreign affairs and colonial
committees of tho chamber, offered
by Gratlen Canace, a colored deputy
-ai------aflBHBMaiMHDaHas5aaaHncssiHHai
from Guadaloupe, that the French
government, in accord with the allies
of France, seek immediately the
means of securing the co-operation of
Abyssinian troops under the guaran
tee of the independence of that coun
try. With regard to this proposition it
is reecalld that the late King Menellk
concluded a treaty of alliance with
France in 1907.
French Road Available for Troops.
M. Alype pointed out that the
French railroad connecting the
French port of Jubitll with Addis
Abeda, in Abyssinia, would make pos
sible the rapid transportation of troops
to the coast, where within four days
they could reach Suez, or in five days
Bassora in Mesopotamia.
The Abyssinian troops, he also not.
ed are already well armed, having
from 800,00 to 1,000,000 modern ri
fles, all manufactured since 1911.
partly in Germany, but for the most
part by Belgium.
Tho co-operation of tho Japanese
fleet is suggested for tho transporta
tion of Abyssinian troops to Egypt or
Mesopotamia.

GLOBE ATTACKS
MRS. AS0UI1
Wife of British Premier Files
Libel Suit Against English
Newspaper.
CALLED ADISGRACE
Most Opprobrious Terms
Used and Accusations of Dis-
Loyalty and Association
With German Prisoners.
London. Dec. 17. 1216 p. m. Mrs.
Herbert S. Asquith, wife of tho prem
ier, appeared as a plaintiff in chan
cery court today, demanding an order
to restrain the Globe from the publi
cation of all alleged libels.
Mrs. Asquith's attorney said.
"For a whole -fortnight before the
issue of this writ Mrs. Asquith has
been deliberately pursued in tho de
fendant's newspaper with accusations
of diBloyalty and of association with
German prisoners at Donnlngton hall.
She has,' been described as a traitor
and a disgrace to her sex and attacked
in most opprobrious terms. These at
tacks were systematically and malov
ontly maintained and were only sus
pended aftor the writ had been is
sued." The attorney opposed tho Globe's
request for a postponement, urging
the court not to deprive the plaintiff
of this opportunity to clear herself
publicly.
Persecution Long Continued.
"The persecution of Mrs. Asquith
has been going on nearly a whole
year," he said. "It began last spring
In another newspaper which, tho de
fendant doubtless would say, was a
lower class than the. Globe. That
paper had to apologize publicly and at
Mrs. Asquith's request, pay 100 pounds
to the Red Cross fund.
"The same people who dlsemlnatcd
these libels through the Globe sent
sheaves of anonymous letters to the
plaintiff and imputations against her
were made in social circles The mat
ter has now come to a head In a form
where the defendants can be brought
to account and made to give their rea
sons for the accusations."
Gross Libels Charged.
Mrs. Asquith's counsel pointed out
that tho statements in question were
not made against his client by name,
but against "the wife of a cabinet
minister." There was sufficient evi
dence, he contended, to show that
Mrs. Asquith was the person referred
to. Moreover, he said, a confession
had been obtained from one of the
parties "to those gross libels which
are calculated to shake confidence in
the administration."
The defendant having undertaken to
refrain from publishing anything af
fecting the case, tho court allowed
tho matter to- stand over until Tues
day '
Before the case was adjourned the
plaintiff's attorney said Mrs. Asquith
had made a denial under oath of the
statements concerning her.

OFFICIAL ANCONA
NOTE RECEIVED
Gravity of Situation Remains
Unchanged Secretary
Lansing Studying Note
Carefully.
NEXT STEP UNDECIDED
Reply May Be Sent Austria
Setting Forth Reasons Why
U. S. Cannot Accept Un
satisfactory Reply.
Washington, Dec. 17. Secretary
LanslnRannounced that the Austrian
reply did not accede to any of the
American demands.
Washington, Dec. 17. The official
text of Austri to the American uoto
on the Ancona, proposing r urthcr
communications on the subject, and
specific allegations upon which the
American charges aro based, is virtu
ally identical with the unofficial text
cabled to the United States yesterday
from London.
Slight changes caused by differ
ences in transition exist, but the
meaning in Its general sense, is tho
same.
Next Note to Be Firmer.
Tho next note, it is believed, will
be more Insistent in its demands than
the first It will not, however, preclude
further dlpl6matic correspondence
between the two governments should
Austria-Hungary persist in the course
she apparently has determined to pur
sue. The United States was repre
sented as desiring to afford Austria
Hungary every opportunity to continue
diplomatic relations with this coun
try. The moaning of the Austrian reply,
Mr. Lansing said, which appeared to
be somewhat vague in the unofficial
version, was clear fn the translation
of the original teiL The vagueness,
he secretary thought, has been due
.undoubtedly to tho translation of the
'unofficial versions. This version, he
thought It equally plain, had been
written by some one who had perused
the note.
It was perfectly clear in the note,
the secretary added, that none of the
American demands were acceded' to.
Further than tills Mr.. Lansing
would, not discuss the reply.
Washington, Dec. 17. Austria's re
ply to Secretary Lansing's note on
the Ancona, recolved during the
night, was laid today before President
Wilson and the cabinet and discussed
for more than an hour.
The gravity of tho situation caused
by Austria's rejoinder to tho Ameri
can demands, which Is considered
evasive, unsatisfactory and unac
ceptable, remained unchanged.
Next Step Not Decided.
The next step will not ho decided
upon until some minor points not
clear in the official text are checked
up. The apparent discrepancies are
not Important and may be due to
transmission or translation from the
stato department code.
Secretary Lansing said aftor the
cabinet meeting that ho did not know
when the official lext of tho note,
would be given out for publication,
and that it certainly would not be
made public until ho had had an op
portunity to study it carefully.
Diplomatic Relatione In Danger.
Diplomatic relations, although in
danger of being broken off. are not
likely to be dlscontined, at least bo
fore there has been another exchange
of notes with Vlennn, and so the
crisis may be said not be in its final
stage Another note setting forth
why the United States can not ac
cept Austria's reply will go forward
before the situation takes on a more
settled aspect.
Meanwhile there aro some hints of
Informal negotiations which might
smooth out tho troubled situation.
Tho froquont calls of Baron Zweidi
nek, the Austrian charge, at the state
department, gives some color to dis
cussion along that line and those
who expect that, in the end the dif
ferences will bo adjusted, count on
the Influence of Berlin to counsel
Vienna to avoid a break. How much
ground there is for such an expecta
tion Is not disclosed by those who
entertain It.
Reply to Be Outlined.
So far as was apparent today the
situation has not affected President
Wilson's plans for going on his hon
eymoon journey after his wedding to
morrow night.
Before the president leaves, how
ever, he will agree with Secretary
Lansing on the outline of a reply to
Austria's note, and if thore shoilld be
any further change In the situation
3Ir. LaiiBlng will go to confer with
the president at tho place where he
will spend his honeymoon. That place,
however, has so far been kept a se
cret. 0
I Paris, Dec. 17, 5.05 a. m. "We
shall be very much astonished if the
American government does not reply
to the Austrian note by simply In
structing Ambassador Penfield to ask
for his passports and by handing pass
ports 'to the Austrian charge at Wash
ington, says tne Figaro.
"Austria's answer is a barely dis
guised refusal. The only satisfaction
Austria gives tho United States Is
that she does not keep tho United
States wanting for it. President Wil
son's longanimity has its limits and
the dismissal of the Austrian charge
at Washington and the recall of Am
bassador Penfield will show this is
not a question of a fit of energy but
a carefully thought out resolution."
Berlin Comments on Note.
Berlin, Dec. 17, via London, 11:10
p. m. Captain ,1. Persius, naval ex
pert of the Tag'oblatt, makes the fol
lowing comment today on the Austri
an note:
"Washington plainly forgot when it
sent its note that its caso rested on
statements of excited passengers as
against sworn statements of Austrian
naval officers. Tho American note
shows little diplomatic aptness."
Questions Manners of U. S.
The Cologne Gazette says:
"America may now choose. If it
desires intercourse as a well-mannered
state with another large and
well-mannered state, It must bring It
self to accede to the standpoint of
the Vienna note."
"As an alternative It will have to
learn that Austria-Hungary does not
let Itself be handled as a Central
American state which one can bluff
into timorous subordination with rude,
big words," the Gazette adds. "Then
the conflict will be at hand and no
body but the Washington government
will have deliberately desired it."
