FJtEBBTTERIANS DINE AXJ TALK.
Cood ilorles as Well as lerlons Topic Pre
seated at the Preobrterlan Colon's Dinner.
"Any one laboring under tho impression that a
Presbyterian banquet is a gathering of severely
clad iwrsons with Wostmlnster catechisms up
their slcovoi, who moroe1y scat themselves to
gether and with expressions of deep gloom In
Bert a frugal meal Into Dtcrn faces, pre
paratory to listening to u scrloi of dldactto re
marks bearing tuoro or less diroctly upon Hie
total dcpratlty of man and similar plenslng
thrmes, should havo been present at tho nn
ntial dinner of Iho Presbyterian Union, hold at
tho Hotol Savoy last night. Tho average politi
cal or commercial banquot was a funereal per
fonnnnco compared to it. There wasn't a
long epeocli nor a dry speeoh during the even
inp, nnd whllo there was onough said of serious
import to give the banqueters food for thought,
the greater Dart of the time was taken up in
telling stories, which woro none the less en
joyable for having a certain ecclesiastical
flavor. It was a mixed dinner, the wives nnd
daughters and other womon folk of tho Presby.
tcrlnns making up fully halt of the number
irescnt,and the room buzzed like a lingo boo
itvo up to tho ttmo when tho It v. Howard
Dutllold aroso to welcomo tho guests in his
capacity of presiding ofllccr, vice President
John J. MeCook, who was unnblo to be present.
Dr. Dulllcld'a remarks were general rather
than religious in nature, and when be had got
tho nudlunco waked up by several good stories
bo Introduced lllshop Henry C. Potter, who
had been lured from Ids Kplscopal meditations
to take part In tbe revel of Presbyterlanlsm.
Illahon Potter said that he had always consid
ered himself afllltatcd with the Prosbytrrlan
Church through his grandfather Ellphalet
Nntt, who was an eminent Presbyterian divine.
Thon he stalled In telling stories, nnd cited, as
an lnctanco of changes in the Church, the case
of ono John ltoblnson, an historical church
man, to whom, "In view of his approved or
thodoxy," wcro allowed 120 gallons of beer and
ton gallons of wine a month. Turning to morn
Borlons tonics, he spoke of tho growing neces
sity of church iinltv.
Tho situation which confrontB tho churches
that stand for truth and frcodom of thought Is
sdch as must Inevitably bring thoso churches
into a closer bond," he said. . "Such of us as
are living lu tho great cltlos feel this necessity
when we see the growth of the tremendous
social problems. Those whose interests are In
other fields find in the necessity of spreading
Christianity In tho old, far Eastern world which
Is just waking, the need of concerted work.
Tho hope of tho world is in a united Christian
ity." The next speaker was the Her. Samuel Mc
Comb of the ltutgera Riveraido Presbyterian
Church, au Oxford man nnd an Irishman. Ho
had some excellent storlos to tell, and then
made his special olea for bottor churches in tho
slums. The way to get at tho poorer classes,
ho said, is not by small mission chapels, but by
churches as beautiful as those for the rich con
gregations. ltobert C. Ogden, former President of the
Philadelphia Social Union, was Introduced as
coming, llko tho man In tho Bible, with an
eplstlo from Philadelphia. Instead he brought
with him Sir John Denham's amusing but de
cidedly uncomplimentary poem on tho Presby
terlanlsm of two centuries ago, and read selec
tions from It to tho grunt amusement of his
audtenco. Dr. George F. Pentecost of Youkers
follow cd with some stories as amusing ns those
which had gono before; and whan he changed
to sorlous matters it was to prophecy that there
would soon be another great revival which
would be characterized by an extraordinary
consecration of wealth.
"It will be," said ho, "the bringing of the vast
wealth accumulated and still being accumu
lated, under tho power of God. Then God will
have justified Himself In creating gold and sti
ver and bringing it to be tho currency of the
world by making it a great force in church work.
Christian baneflconco will be the watchword of
tho now revival."
Dr. John Hal), the last speaker, made a brief
address of congratulation and farewell.

The notorious "fears or Merchantvllle, f. J,,
Accused of Attompted Abdncllaa.
PniLADELpniA, Pa., Dec. 13. Francis Lingo,
tbo notorious negro of Merchantvlllo, X. J.,
who was twlco arrested nnd onco tried for
murder in Camden county lu cases where the
victims were women, was to-day held In $18,000
ball for trial In the United States court, and
$2,000 ball or trial in the Stato court, on.
charges growing out of his attempt to entice
Miss Catherine V. Berry of this city to Pesau
ken, N. J.
Miss Herry, whose home is at Athens, Go.,
has. been boarding In this city. Sho recently
advertised for employment as a governess. She
received an answer from Merchantvllle, evi
dently written by an illiterate person, and
signed Mrs. Mabel Coouer. No person of that
name Is known to tho Postmaster of Merchant
vllle. Lingo called for and received the let
ters addressed to her, presenting an order In
writing slgnod by tho bypotbetlcal Mrs.
Cooper. Ho also called upon Miss Herry In
this city and appointed Inst Thursday for her
to visit Mrs. Cooper at Pesauken. Inquiries by
Miss Herry'a brother led to an Investigation by
tbo police nnd tbe arrest of Lingo.
Recollecting the two atrocious murders In
which he figured as a suspect, the people of
Merchantvllle woro In a humor "to lynch hlin,
nnd he was removed to the jail at Camden.
Ho was fully identified to-day nnd held for trial
on fifteen separate chargea of using the United
States malls for unlawful purposes, tbe ball be
ing 1,000 on each charge, and he was subse
quently arrested by the State authorities and
held for trial lu Camden county in til, 000 ball
each on the charges of atteniDtod abduction and
forgery. A lawyer representing the residents
of Merchantvllle appeared at the hearing and
will assist In tho prosecution of Lingo.
The negro was tried In 18110 for the murder of
Mrs. Annie Miller, whose body was found in
tho woods near Morchauivllle, where she had
been assaulted. The evl ence was circumstan
tial, and be was acquitted. In 181)1 the body
of Annlo Leo Concv was found in tbo same
neighborhood undor similar circumstances.
Lingo was nrrosted for the crime, but suspicion
was dlvored to tbo girl's uncle, who was tried
and acquitted.

Supervisor tu UltacuUle a to tbe Appartloa
meal of Interest Charges.
The Queens county Board of Supervisors Is
having trouble In apportioning tbe first year's
interest charges on $1,108,000 of road Improve
ment bonds, Issued since It becamo certain that
a portion of the county was to become a part of
the Greater New York. Tho trouble arises ore
tho opposition of Long Island City to assuming
any of the Indebtedness and tho unwillingness
of tbe taxpayers of the towns of Oyster Bay,
North Hempstead, and tho portion of the town
of Hempstead not taken Into tbo borough
of Queons, to consent to the plan pro
posed by the Supervisors for apportioning the
debt. Tlio Improvements have been confined to
Queens county outside of Long Island City and
mainly to tho towns of Newtown, Flushing,
Jamaica, and that portion of thu town of Hemp
stead witbin the boundary of the borough.
The Supervisors must place in this year's tax
budgct.thesuniof tJloT.O'.'O to meet the first
oar's Intorost on the bonds. Tbe board held a
meeting in I,ong Island City yesterday to dis
pose of the matter, but final action was (inferred
until this morning nt 11 o'clock.
Townsuud rtcudder, counsel to the board, ad
vised that it had the puwer to apportion the in
terest debt according to the benefits accruing
to tho sovorul towns from tbo Improvements,
proildlng the niiDortlonmcnt was predicated
upon justice mid falrnoss. Ills brother, T, Hal
stead Scuddor. ropresonting tho taxpayers of
that portion of tho county remaining outside
the borough of Queens, told the Supervisors
that tho apportionment should be made udou
the basis of the assessed valuation f the prop
erty, as provided In the charter, and contended
tbut to apportion tho Interest upon the basis of
tlio amount of principal expended In tlio sev
eral towns would prejudice the officials of the
Greater New York in apoortlonlng tlin principal.

An Kipsrlmeat U Be Mad by III ioelaty rr
the iprormat or the l'ndlllH or tbe
ror CmmlMlar Cruger a Assatalt an
Central Park The Mw Public I.thrari.
The Uptown Committee reported .to tho
Park Board yesterday in favor of allowing tho
Society for tbo Improvement of the Condition
of tho Poor to use 321 acres of uncultivated
land In Pelham Bay Park for vacant-lot farm
ing during tho year 1808. Superintendent
Kcljard, who has charge of that branch of the
eocloty's work, urged the board to adopt tho
report. Ho said that ono of the largest labor
unions In tho city wished to let some of it old.
members experiment with vacant-lot farming
on the land, with a viow.ln the event of succoss,
of buying a large farm somewhere In the neigh
borhood on which a colony of its veteran mem
bers could bo established.
Commissioner Mitchell, who Is a lawyer, ex
pressed doubts as to the power of the board to
grant the request, but President MoMlllan
assured htm that It could be done.
"Most of the land nsked'for is now barren,"
continued the President, "and It will afford a
fine object lesson to school chlldron and other
visitors to see tho productive elements growing
there."
Commissioner Mitchell then rnisod the
question of the practicability of tbe soheme.
''It will cost the peorjle who cultivate this land
GO cents a day each to got to and from thotr
farms, nnd I don't see where the profit will
come in," ho said.
"The Bocloty will take caro of that, replied
Mr. Keljard. The report was adopted.
The request mado by the West Knd Associa
tion, of which Cyrus Clark is the President,
that the elevated road should be allowed to
cruet a stairway at the southern end of the
downtown station nt Slxtr-Blxtli street and
Columbus avenue, led Commissioner Cruger
to make some remarks about "tbo assaults
which are constantly being made on Central
Park by peoplo who prefer convenience to
beauty and established landscape footures."
"I nni opposed to this application," he said,
"because there Is already one stairway leading
to the downtown station at sixty-sixth street.
I don't believe In blocking the Bldowalk there
to save a few people tho trouble of walking
200 feet. This application la right in lino with
the numerous requests to make additional
entrances into Central Park. It Is getting ko
that evorybody wants nn entrance right oppo
site his residence and tho Park would be abso
lutely destroyed if we paid any attention to
the clamor. We might just as well cut all the
streets through the Park from Eighth avenue
to Fifth avenue and have done with it."
Unfortunately, Col. Cruger stopped before he
explained how no hod boon led to listen to
tho "clamor" of certain horso ownors nnd livery
stable keepers who succeeded In Inducing htm
and Commissioners MoMlllan and Kly recently
to authorize the despoilment of tho Park at
Eighth avenuo and Fiftv-nlntU street. The
application of tho West End Association was
laid over, as was the petition of tho Upper East
Side Association for an entrance to the Park
at Seventy-sixth street and Fifth avenue.
Upon the recommendation of Carrere &
Hastings, tho architects for tho new Public. Li
brary, the following engineers were appointed:
For tho structural work and foundations,
Theodore Cooper of 35 Broadway; for tho heat
ing, ventilating, and machinery. Alfred It.
Wolff of 134 Fulton street; for electrical in
stallation, Patterson Brothers of 130 Liberty
street. Carrero & Hastings certified Jthat tho
appointments had been approved by the Board
of Trustees of tbo Library.
Tho application of tho Dry Dock, East Broad
way, and Avenue D surface road tor a permit
-to change Its motive power from horses to eloc
triclty was formally denied by the unanimous
Tots of the board.

Nashville, Tenn.. Dec. 13. When President
Gompers called tho seventeenth annual conven
tion of the American Federation of Labor to or

tatives there were present more than 100 dele
gates and many visitors.
President Gompers Introduced William Aim!
son. former President of tbo International
Typographical Union, who. In a brief address,
extended a cordial welcome to the delegates. In
his response Gompers said:
"I desire to say that while some progress in
legislation In tho Interest of organized labor has
been made in Tennessee, thero is a very great
wrong unremedied, and tho mon who sleep be
neath thu earth, who were shot down while trying
te eradicate convict labor from Its unrighteous
competition with free labor, testify to this exist
ing evil, ino oiooa or mesa men cauo out iu
workers everywhere to unite with their brothers
In Tennessee in their efforts to see that Justice
is yet done."
The convention being ready for business, tho
Committee on Credentials presented its re
port, which was received. Two fraternal
delegates, Havelock Wilson of London,
of the seamen's organization and mem
ber of tho British Parliament from Mid
dlcsboro, and Edward Harford of London
of the railway employee's organization, were
introduced to the convention. Another visitor
was Mr. Cardozo of France, who is bore for tho
purpose of obtaining statistics relative to in
dustries of the United States. Theodore Perry
of Nashville was appointed Assistant Secretary,
nfter which tho annual report of President Com
peas was read. Prolonged applauso followed
the conclusion of the report, and the convention
adjourned for dinner. . ,
Upon reassembling, the resorts of the Secre
tary, Treasurer, and Auditing Committee were
read and committees were appointed. Tbo Sec
retary's report showed that tbo Increaso of
membership in the past year was ai,'.!80. Char
ters were Issued to 217 national, State, central,
local, nnd Federal labor unions.
Over 000 applications for unions have been
forwarded by organizers to tho dlfforent aflil
lated national unions. More organizers were
engaged in tbe work than ever before In tbe
history of tbo federation. Tho Treasurer's re-
fort showed that the receipts were larger than
boso of last year, but the expenses were
greater, yet thoro remains a balance of several
tnousand dollars on hand.
After the adjournment of the afternoon ses
sion the different committees met for organiza
tion and the preparation of roportx. The real
work of the convention will begin to-morrow.

Chicago, Doc. 13. William Coughlln of the

'lluthhouso" John Coughlln, was shot and
probably mortally wounded last evening by
Frank Daslowakl, whom he was trying to ar
rest. Boxlowskl was mortally wounded by
Officer John Wayer tn tho desperate strugglo
which followed his unexpected capture. The
affair may be the bcglnulng of tbo end of tho so
called "Pittsburg" gang. Tho commander of
the Illnman street station has declared sharp
war on the thugs who constltuto the gang, and
hereafter his men will giro no quarter.
Coughlln and Wnyer wont to tho house of
Joseph I'loava, an ex-conrlct, on Eighteenth
place, to arrest Bazlowskl for a murderous as
sault on Frank Wlesnuskl, also a member of
tho "Pittsburg" gnng. Ae tho officers entered
tho room Butlowskt Jumpod to his feet and
began firing. Coughlln fell at the first shot.
Wayer camo to his roscuo nnd n bat Jo with a
crowd of thugs ensued. John Nlemau of tho
gang emptlod his revolver at closo range in an
effort to kill tho officers, but Wayer Anally
foiled him with his club. Wayer, closely pressed
by Bazlowskl, shot the thug in the abdomen.
Tho wounded men were takou to tho county
hospital and Nieuian was arrested.

ItldentCof ' the west Jsldo have concluded
that In selfdetenue lies their onlv chance of
securing Immunity from tho attacks of high
waymen. An organization to be known as the
"Citizens' Auxiliary Police." Is lu process of
formation. The Intention of its promoters is
to employ private watchmen to guard district
of tbe city in a bettor way than Is possible
with tho loresent; limited number of policemen.
ThrJ volunteer protoctlvo movement. It Is
plannrd, will Include branches In overy ward.
The chief end will bo the maintenance of a
private police force, but the members of tho
auxiliary will be privileged in tbo first In
stance to defend themselves when attacked,
and to go armed and ready for.' tho highway
men. Tho agitators believe that between their
methods of killing and patrolling tbey will rid
their sldo of tho city of robbers and murderer.
The motto of tbo association will be, "Shoot to
kill when you meet, n hold-up man."
When Mayor Harrison was told of tho
schemo he was not pleased. IIo,acknowledged
that tho Pollco Department was short of men.
but said that it tbe ritlzoiis wanted to help tu
the crusade against hold-up men they would
better ootrlbute to u fund which would make
it possible for the city to Increaso the number nf
ItH patrolmen.

Both men were nrrosted by order of Capt.

Several hundred more electrical appliance
makers went on strlko yesterday at the
Western Electric Company's shops, 47
Betbuno street. The strikers rccolved their
wages and police guarded the place all dav, but
thcro was no trouble.
Tbe girls had not gone on strlko yesterday,
but the men strikers say they will quit work
to-day. They gavo a faint "beer ns nn encour
agomeut to tho girls when they left the factory.
Superintendent Nichols said that It was not
true that thu strikers wcro discharged. They
would have a chance to conio back.
"This Is a stuinpedo rather than a strike,"
he said, "and I don't think the trouble will last
long. Some of the leaders got it Into their
hesids that the new piece work system would
pull down their oarnlnss, and scared the others.
This is not so. They can earn at least as
much under tho new system as they were
earning before."
Mr. Nichols said that tliure was little pros
pect of tbe strike being carried to the con
cern's branch establishment in Chicago.
DURRAXT TO RE RESEXTEXCED.

San Francisco, Dec, HI. Judge Bahrs to-day
ordered Warden Hale of San Qucutln prison to
bring Theodore Durrnnt before him on Wednes
day for resentence. It Is understood that he
will name Friday, Jan. 7, as the day of execu
tion, Durrant's attorneys took exception to the
order. They lire said to be contemplating
a sensational movo to-morrow, which Is
nothing less than tochargo some person, sun-
SDSori to be tbo Rev. Ueorge J. Gibson, paMorof
rannuel Church, with ttie luuiderof -Minnie
Williams. If they havo any evldonco to justify
the arrest thoy will use this to Hecuro another
stay In Durrant's execution on tho ground that
the trial may hrlng-out facts showing who was
really tbo murderer of Blanche Lamont.
Chief Icos, who made n most careful study of
both murders, says thero Is not a singlo clue
connecting the clergyman with either crime.
This comes with all the mora forco from Lees, ns
he started in with u strong prejudice against
Mr. Olbson because of his efforts to suppress
the facts and exclude reporters from gaining
Information about tho crimes.

THOMAS RRAX GETS A NB1T TRTAL.
lapreme Court Decide That the AdraU.l.n or
HI. .ttlrard roiirea.l.n TV, an Err.r.
Wasiunoton, Dec. 13. Thomas Ilram, con
victed of tho murder of tho Captain, the Cap
tain's wife, and the mate of tho Imrkcntlno
Herbert Fuller, on a voyage from Ilotton to a
South American port, will havo another chance
for his llfo. Ho was arrested at Boa by member
of tho crew, together with onothor sailor of the
name of Drown, nnd hold at Halifax foroxain
lnatlou by tho fnltod States Cousul. Pond
ing that examination Ilram had a conversation
with a detective. In which he made a statement
which, whllo denying tho commission of the
crime, by implication contained a confession.
This confession, although objected to by the de
fendant's (omifel, was admitted by tho Judge
at the trial court in Huston, nud Its admission
was ono of the errors alleged ns grounds for
anneal.
Speaking for the Court, Justice White said
that It was Iho ono Important error and suffi
ciently grave to warrant a reversal of the ver
dict and Judmnent and tho irranilntror anew
trial, which w.n done. Tho reasoning of the
Court was that tho confession was not n vol
untnrv ono In tho meaning of tho law nnd
should not havo gone to tho Jury. Justice
Droner dissented In a vigorous opinion for tbe
ronton that thero was no objection to tlio testi
mony In itself. The retlnoment of reasoning
reached bv tho Court, he said, while It might
show marvollous pychologlcal research and
ability, had but. little bearing on tbo practical
elements of the caso. Mr. Justlco brown con
curred In the dissent.
Hoston. Dec. 11. Tho now of tho decision
was communlcnlcd to Ilram by his counsel. Cot
ter&Frcmh, this afternoon. Ho exhibited no
great surprlso at tho decision, but plainly
nhowcd relief from tho groat strain bo has been
undrr. Tho only Htatoment ho mado was!
" I nin glad they have given mo a new trial,
but you know I havo felt all along that It would
bo this way. I thought tho Judges would see
that I wainn Innocent man nnd would not let
an innocent man be hangod."
The Herbert Kullor sailed from Ilostonon July
2. 18IKI. bound for a South American port. On
the night of July la C'npr. N'aah and his wife
and Second Mate Illomberg were killed, each
having soveral wounds In tho head, apparently
given with a sharp Instrument like an ax. The
murders occurred whllo Ilram was on watch,
wltlu a sailor of the name of Brown
at the wheel. Tho ship then put about and was
sailed to Halifax. En routo the sailors llrst. ar
rested llrown nnd thon Ilrnm for the murders
nnd carried them in irons to Halifax, whero
Dram was arrestod on llrowu's statement that
he saw Ilrnm kill Cunt. Nash. Whllo In llalifnx
Ilram win taken to tho ofllejj of a dotecttve. who
said to him:
"I hnve bad Drown In this offlce, and be made
a statement that bo saw you do tbe murder."
"He could not havo seeu me." Bald Ilram.
"Where was hel"
"Ho says he wns at tho wheel."
"Woll." said Ilram, "he could not see me
from there.'
After examination before the United States
Consul, Dram was sent to Ilostou, indicted,
convicted and sentenced to death.
