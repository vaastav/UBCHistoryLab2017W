THE MESSAGE IX UKIF.F.
To those who have not the time or
inc lination to read all the president 's
message to congress, the following
brief statement of its contents may be
of interest:
The president recommends for the
. second time a law prohibiting all cor
porations from contributing to funds
for campaign purposes.
He would confer on the government
the right of appeal in criminal cases
on questions of law. He deplores the
custom of setting aside the judgment
on inferior points or mere technic
alities of the law, in instances where
not the slightest doubt exists of the
justice of the decision.
The president declares that the in
junction can not be abolished under
the law and that in his opinion its re
striction would be unwise. When the
instrument is put to its proper use,
he says, opposition to it will cease.
Labor agitators work untold harm
The president recommends legislation
looking toward a general eight-hour
workday, but deplores class prejudice
between labor and capital. He recom
mends the passage of laws regulating
the hours of employment of railway
employes; in regard to the liability of
employes; for the investigation of dis
putes between labor and capital.
The president believes the coal
lands, like forest lands, should be
generally withdrawn and future^ dis
position guarded with great care.
In regard to corporations Mr.
Roosevelt advocates further federal
control over interstate commerce. He
says combination is inevitable and
that under proper control it is not
harmful.
A graduated income and inheritance
tax is advocated, the president declar
ing that if necessary the constitution
should be revised to permit the pass
age of such laws.
The common schools should develop
more skilled workers. Courses in
mechanics and business should more
generally supersede the merely orna
mental branches. Foreign trade
would be greatly increased.by prepa
ration in school of special agents or
of labor skilled in the preparation of
commodities for export.
The welfare of the farmer is the wel
fare of the entire nation and govern
ment should spare no effort to for
ward the Interests of the industry.
Currency reform is necessary, but
the president ventures to set forth no
recommendation beyond urging con
gress to give the matter immediate at
tention.
The Cuban occupation is reviewed
and the statement made that it will
cease as soon as stable government
is established in the Island.
The Central American war and its
conclusion through arbitration is
pointed out as a happy iustauce of
tiie power of the United States to pre
serve the peace of the occident.
The president has bent all his ef
forts toward a second Hague confer
ence. He dwells upon the duty of na
tions toward each other and the bless
ings of peace.
He asks no increase in the navy,
but that it may be kept at its present
efficiency by the substitution of mod
ern for antedated vessels. More men
are needed for coast defenses and a
system should be devised whereby a
per cent, of young blood may be in
jected into the high rank of both the
army and the navy. National shoot
ing galleries, whereby every citizen
may learn to handle a gun, are essen
tial as tiic standing army is small.
The army maneuvers should be on a
larger scale.
Uniform divorce legislation is a
topic congress should not fail to con
sider.
The brief statement is made that ir
rigation and forest preservation are
of vital import. Ship subsidy is brief
ly considered.
The need of revision of the laws
upon the fur and seal trade is ex
plained and the negotiations with
Great Britain and Japan touched
upon.
A reduction in tariff on products
from the Philippines is recommended.
The attitude toward Japanese im
migrants is deplored aud Japan's
progress is reviewed. In the opiniou
of the president the friendship of the
Japanese is of the highest importance.
He characterizes the action of the
people of San Francisco in shutting
out the Japanese from their schools
as a "wicked absurdity" and declares
that where possible the government
will deal summarily with the question.
The president asks the power of con
gress to enforce the rights of aliens and
recommends a statute providing for
the naturalization of Japanese immi
grants.
One of the curiosities of South Af
rica is the "gneezeland" tree. No one
can cut it with a saw without sneez
ing, as the fine dust is very irritating.
Even planing the wood will sometimes
cause sneezing. No insect or worm
will touch it. It is very bitter to the
taste, and when placed in water it
sinks.
TIIE PEOPLE AND THE RAILROAD*.
Coming wiithin a few days after the
complaints made by James J. Hill and
E. H. Harriman that the railroads
are not getting fair play, that they
are being branded as "outlaws," and
that the attacks upon them will have
the effect of causing investors to boy
cott railroad securities, the report of
the interstate commerce commission
showing net earnings of the roads in
the United States for the year ending
June 30 last to be $78",597,877, pos
sesses more than ordinary interest
With the railroads of the country
able to pay dividends amounting to
$229,4(X),59S last year, and very close
ly approximate amounts in 1905 and
1904, equivalent to over 5 per cent, on
dividend paying stock, and with
continued era of business prosperity,
admitted by both Mr. Hill and Mr.
Harriman to be practically assured,
capital is not going to be driven away
unless it be by the management of tbe
roads.
Both Mr. Hill and Mr. Harriman,
rivals as they are for control of the
railroad situation in the middle and
western states, agree in asserting that
more capital will be needed to meet
the growing demands for transporta
tion facilities. They agree likewise in
complaining of the agitation for con
trol of railroad rates. But they hold
radically opposite views as to what is
needed for the relief of the existing
congestion in traffic. Mr. Hill says
more trackage is required. Mr. Harri
man says the trackage is sufficient,
but more rolling stock is needed. Mr.
Harriman is more nearly correct,
though it is probable that no one
cause is responsible for the conges*
tion.
Mr. Hill uses figures given in the
reports of the interstate commerce
commission showing that in the paet
decade railway mileage has increased
20 per cent., number of cars 45 per
cent, and number of engines 32 per
cent. He omits reference, however, to
the vastly greater burden put upon
the engines by the much larger cars
that are now being built and the
heavier trains they are obliged to
haul. Mr. Hill is an advocate of a
policy of large freight cars with maxi
mum loads. Moving at a low rate of
speed the cost of transportation per
ton is reduced to a minimum.
Other railroad managers also seek
economy in this direction, with the
natural result that trackage becomes
congested. If the loads were lighter
there might be a fractional increase
of expense, but trains could be moved
more expeditiously, congestion would
be avoided, a greater amount of busi
ness could be handled, and a normal
increase in trackage would be ade
quate.
It is not to be supposed that Mr.
Hill does not thoroughly appreciate
this. For the purpose of supporting
his complaint that the railroads are
not getting justice he advances fal
lacious and misleading arguments.
The railroads have not been injured
by the new rate legislation and are
not likely to be. The people do not
demand a general reduction of rates
to an unprofitable basis. But gov
ernment control to prevent discrimi
nation and arbitrary manipulation of
rates is absolutely essential. If the
railroads will strictly comply with
the law, giving justice as well as ask
ing for it, making such reductions in
rates as the conditions justify, popu
lar sentiment will uo longer be ex*
asperated, and the imaginary threat
ening of capital will vanish.—Spokes
m an-lie view.
INHERITANCE TAX.
That portion of the president's mes
sage which refers to the desirability
of an income ami inheritance tax,
promises to become an interesting
subject for discussion among states
men, lawyers aud citizens generally.
The "square deal" nature of the prop
osition will appeal to the American
people, although the difficulty of en
acting such legislation is appre
ciated by the president and others who
have made careful study of the mat
ter.
Commissioner Garfield was recently
interviewed relative to an inheritance
aud income tax. lie said he had given
the matter particular attention aud
his views on the inheritance tax are
"If we had a scheme of taxation that
justly and fairly taxed property dur
tug the life of the owner thereof there
would be no reason or excuse for an
inheritance tax. But no plan has been
developed iu our country that reaches
the property of men of more than am
ple means. The great burden falls on
the mau of moderate means—the mau
whose property cannot be hidden.
"The only time the property of
rich man comes into evidence is when
he dies. It is then we see that it has
not borne its fair share of taxation.
"1 thiuk the inheritance tax," he
continued, "should be graded with a
rapidly increasing scale iu proportion
to the value of the property. I have
never worked out an exact plan, but
the Knglish system offers a pretty
good basis, both for a graded income
tax and for a graded inheritance tax.
"Still, British inheritance taxes are
exceedingly heavy. I have not recent
ly looked up English statutes,- but I
understand that three deaths in a year
would seriously impair the corpus of
the state. That of course is too much.
"Now, in Ohio, the state with which
I am particul&rly-familiar, the scheme
of taxation has resulted in increasing
the burden on land—and that neces
sarily means the farmers.
"When 1 examined the returns some
years ago, there had been no appre
ciable increase for twenty-five years
in personal property assessment
think it was $500,000,000 in 1873, and
about the same in 1898. Of course,
this was perfectly absurd, for we know
that the value of personal property
increased many fold in that period
Commissioner Garfield was asked
how this kind of property could ba
reached for taxation purposes at its
proper value.
"The only possible way to do it un
der our system of laws," he respond
ed, "would be by an inheritance tax
when the property comes in sight
through the death of its owner.
"Whatever it may be in the other
states I do not know, but in Ohio the
current rate of taxation in (Cleveland
is about three per cent, of the earning
power of the personal property if it
were returned by the owner at its full
value.
"But personal property is not re
turned. People simply will not do it.
The only way that kind of Iproperty
can be reached or made to bear ulti*
mately its fair share of taxation is
when it comes into sight through
death."
He does not believe there will be
any conflict between state laws and a
national law. If a national law had
been in force when the late Marshall
Field died, Mr. Garfield said that a
large proportion of the estate would
have gone to tbe national government.
Mr. Garfield also believes in an in
come tax, graded up, and on a millon
dollar income tbe state should take not
more than 35 or less than 15 per cent.
He does not believe that such a tax
will prevent the accumulation ofilarge
fortunes, but it would enable the state
to share, as it should be, in them.
What Mr. Garfield says about inheri
tance and income taxes is of interest
at this time when it is confidently be
lieved that the national government
contemplates the enactment of such a
law.
Area of the I'nited States.
The United States geological sur
vey has just issued bulletin 302, by
Henry Gannett, which represents the
result of conference and co-operation
of the land office, census bureau, and
geological survey in an effort to
agree on what constitutes "the area
of the United States." The absence
of a standard of measurement for de
termining the area led to a dis
crepancy between the tables of the
census bureau made in 1887 and those
of the general land office prepared in
1S99. The result of the co-operation
of the departments is that the area of
the United States proper, which is
given as 3,026,789 square miles, has
been increased over the census figures
by 1,188 square miles. The bulletin
gives the area of xVlaska as 590,884:
the Philippines, 115,026: Hawaii, 6,
449: Porto Rico, 3,435; Guam, 210;
Samoa, 77, and the Panama canal
strip, 474 squure miles.
All the detached territory is subject
to change as the limits become more
correctly defined.
New Plants For I armer*
San Francisco , Dec. 4.—N. E.
Hansen, explorer for the department of
agriculture at Washington, arrived
on the steamer China from a tour of
the world in search of rare specimens
of plauts and trees that would be of
economic value to the farmers of the
I'nited States. He was eminently suc
cessful in his mission, but declined to
enter into details regarding his dis
coveries. Hansen left Washington in
July last, going direct to England
and thence to Lapland, Norway,
Sweden, Finland aud across Russia
and Siberia to Vladivostok, and from
there to Japan and China.
To Adjust Water Rights
Milton , Wash., Dec. 4. —In the
supreme court here today Judge Bean

discussed irrigation suits. There are
over 400 litigants involved in the case,
nearly all of whom are in attendance
to give evidence. The case involves
every land owner along the Little
Walla Walla and Tumalum rivers,
aud is the most Important and far
reaching irrigation case in the history
of this state. The hearing of the cases
will last about 20 days.
Congressmen Want More Pay.

Millions For Mineral Lands.
Toronto , Dec. 5. —The government
has received au offer of $15,000,000
from a number of United States finan
ciers for about teu square miles of
land in the Cobalt region. Ulis offer

THEY W ANT APPROPRIATIONS.
Legislature W ill Be Asked To Provide For
Educational Institutions.
H elena , Dec. 4.—The state board
of education completed a two days
session this afternoon, and as a re
suit of the meeting, recommendations
for appropriations for the mainten
ance of the state educational institu
tions were adopted. While the state
bond question was discussed inform
ally, no action was taken.
The committees to which had been
referred the reports of the state insti
tutions made their reports. It was
recommended that the legislature be
asked for an appropriation of $8,000
for a boiler house at the school of
mines, and that the appropriation for
the maintenance of the institution be
$30,400 for each of the years 1907 and
1908.
The appropriation to be asked for
the agricultural college Is $25,800 a
year, and In addition, $7,500 for the
experiment station, $2,500 for dry land
farming experiments, $5,000 for live
stock, and $7,000 for repairs and ex
tensions.
The state normal school appropria
tion to be asked for is $29,800 for
maintenance each year. The leglsla
ture will also be asked to make provi
sion for completing the building, in
accordance with the plans already
adopted, and to pay the liabilities al
ready incurred.
The school for the deaf and blind
will ask for a maintenance appropria
tion of $33,000 for 1907-08, and in ad
dition, $4,500 to finish and furnish a
building under construction, $7,500
for an industrial building, $8,000 for
a hospital, and $10,000 to purchase a
farm.
The committee on the University of
Montana recommended that the legis
lature be asked to makelan appropria
tion of $57,555 for each of the years
1907-08, for the maintenance of tbe in
stitution. It was also recommended
that the legislature be asked to enact
a law providing that all graduates of
the university who have taken a year's
work in the department of psychology
and method, and who get a regular
diploma from the university, be au
thorized to teach in the common
schools of the state without taking a
teachers' examination, and that, after
teaching three years, they be given a
life diploma by the state board.
Miners Must Stand Trial.
Washington , Dec. 3. — The su
preme court today refused to order the
release of Moyer, Haywood and Petti
bone, officials of the Western Federa
tion of Miners, who are held in cus
tody in Idaho on a charge of com
plicity in the murder of ex-Governor
Steunenberg. The action was based
on an application for a writ of habeas
corpus, and has been pending for sev
eral months. The attorneys for the
applicants contended that the Idaho
authorities had kidnapped the accused
men from the state of Colorado, and
that their imprisonment was, there
fore, illegal. The trial of the murder
cases has been postponed pending the
decision of the supreme court in the
habeas corpus cases.
Justice Harlan announced the de
cision of the court. He stated that the
decision of the federal court in quash
ing the appeal from the Idaho state
court was affirmed by the supreme
court. Tbe guilt or innocence of the
accused men was not considered, the
only point involved being the legality
of the imprisonment. The court held
the motive of the governor of Idaho
in issuing extradition papers and tbe
governor of Colorado in honoring
them was immaterial.
llauserWlns Mining Suit.
Washington , Dec. 4. — The su
preme court of the United States has
dismissed the case of Granville Stuart
versus Samuel T. Hauser and others,
all of Montana, involving the owner
ship of the Peacock, White Monument
aud Helena mining claims of the
Seven Devils mining district in Idaho,
estimated to be worth $1,000,000. The
controversy is of many years' stand
ing, and grew out of the intimate per
sonal relationship between Stuart and
Hauser.
They were partnership owners in the
mines at a time when Hauser was
president of a now insolvent bank in
Helena. Stuart was indebted to the
bank and made a deed of his interest
to Hauser, and, while he claimed that
the transaction was intended merely
to secure his indebtedness to the bank,
the deed was shown to be without such
condition.
Hauser, in turn, conveyed the prop
erty to another party. Stuart's suit
was instituted to compel the pur
chasers from Hauser to return the
property to be held as in trust for
Stuart. The court's decisiou was
favorable to Hauser.
Want To See Standard Books
Findlay , Ohio, Dec. 4.—In a mo
tion tiled today iu the circuit court by
the »täte of Ohio, in its suit against
the Buckeye Pipe Liue company, the
court is asked to order the production
of all the books and vouchers of the
Standard Oil company. The names
of the directors in tbe Standard and
its subsidiary companies are aleo
asked for.
As further source of information in
its prosecution, the state asks for an
accounting of all the oil transported
by the Standard Oil in the last three
years, to whom shipped and the name9
of the individuals or corporations
who paid the charges. Suit was re
cently filed by the state against the
Buckeye company, a subsidiary of the
Standard Oil, charging violations of
the Valentine anti-trust law.
Nevada's Mineral Wealth
W ashington , Dec. 4.—Eleven mil
lion dollars in new gold will be pro
duced by Nevada duriDg the present
year, and in 1907, $20,000,000 worth of
gold will be mined in that state. This
prediction is made by Director of the
Mint Roberts, who is just back from a
tour of inspection of the western min
ing camps. Gold mining is booming
in Nevada, he says, and feverish ac
tivity prevails throughout the entire
region. Railroads are being con
structed to promote the development
of the mines, and every available foot
of ground in the vicinity of the valu
able mipes is being staked off. The
great fields of gold have made numer
ous millionaires, and incidentally
have brought into existence a plethora
of wildcat companies. One of the
latest methods decided upon to adver
tise the great gold country Is to run a
train to the smelting works at Salt
Lake City laden with $1,000,000 worth
of gold ore. Director Roberts says
that "it is asserted by men competent
to judge that a copper region has been
discovered in Nevada that will rival
the Butte district in Montana."
An Arizona Freshet.
Bisbee , Ariz., Dec. 4. —One.of the
worst floods in the history of Clifton
came down the San Francisco river
and Chase creek last night. Tbe prin
cipal business section of the town was
almost completely ruined. From seven
to twenty persons is the reported loss
of life. Only one name is obtainable,
however, at this time. Mrs. Jos. T.
Home, with her husband and children,
was caught In a falling building and
killed. The other members of the
family had narrow escapes.
One of the saloons which was washed
away carried several men into the tor
rent and they are believed to have
drowned. A woman and a child were
lost in a small restaurant which was
dashed to pieces in the flood. A num
ber of small frame buildings in which
people were known to be living were
destroyed and it is expected that a
number of families have perished.
The Coronado railway, from Clifton
to Longfellow, is destroyed. It will be
several weeks before business can be
resumed over the road. The financial
loss cannot be estimated.
