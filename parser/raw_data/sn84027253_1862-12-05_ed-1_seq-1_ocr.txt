The telegraph informs us that the loyal
citizens of Memphis are moving in the mat
ter of electing a member of Congress from
the 10th District of Tennessee. A like move
ment is on foot in New Orleans, and in North
Carolina two or three members are to be
elected.
The Courier, of Saturday morning, de
nounces these movements in advance, simply
because, it says, the members elected will be
Abolitionists. If there was a probability of
secessionists or secession-sympathizers being
elected instead of good Union men, the Cou
rier would pronounce it all right and proger.
So would Jeff. Davis.
Our readers will see bv a resolution
acted upon by the Board of Supervisors, yes

imputation of great malfeasance in office.—
Journal.
The Journal, with its usual courtesy, pro
nounces a public decree of guilty and only
wants the opportunity to hang the culprit.
Now permit us to say, for brother Mahin's
benefit, that we shall coine out ahead in this
matter. We understand the object, and have
no fears of the result. We know very well
•who we have to deal with, and we are always
prepared for such individuals. Courier.
The JOURNAL pronounced no decree what
ever, and your own quotation from our col
umns shows the statement to be false. It is
no new thing, however, for a person guilty of
crime to put on an air of defiance and injured
innocence. No body will be convinced by
that kind of bravado.
THAT SPEECH. The Courier editor, not
withstanding he thinks it "looks bad for a
man to call on his neighbors to vindicate his
character,"-has been to the trouble of writing
to Luse, Lane & Co., of Davenport, and pro
curing a denial from them that they ever
received pay from him or the county for
printing one of his speeches. He flourishes
this denial as a triumphant vindication of
Kmself from a charge which he says we made
Against him, and says he will hereafter treat
what we may say on the subject with the ut
most silence. He shows great anxiety to have
the matter drop here. But our inquiry, made
in behalf of the tax-payers of Muscatine
county, is still unanswered. We asked "how
ikuch did the county of Muscatine pay for the
|rinting of Judge Thayer's speech Will he
sow deny that such a speech was ever deliver
ed or ever printed If not, let us have all
the facts in the case. We aim to be truthful
Mid deal justly even to our enemies, and if
the Judge can clear up this matter honorably
to himself we promise to give him the benefit
of his vindication through our columns. We
give you still further time, Judge.
John Van Buren and Fernando Wood

We are told by responsible travelers that the
very patriotic host of that institution
pushes his trash upon every stranger whom
he can possibly induce to take it, generally
answering objections by remarking that "they
are as good as Government shinplasters!
This underhand stab at the currency of our
Government, at a time when all loyal men
should unite in an effort to sustain its credit,
should be resented by a withdrawal of patron
age from that concern.

A Vial Wrath.
A Confederate surgeon, who had been at
tending rebel patients in the hospital at Bol
ivar, being desirous of joining his command
in Price's army a few days ago, got permission
to go through our lines. He had a very fine
medicine chest filled with stores recruited at
the Federal hospital, which he wished to take
with him. Our officers objected to this prop
osition. The matter was finally referred to
Gen. McPheraon, and an examination of the
Chest was ordered On taking out the drugs
and medicines, a small secret apartment was
discovered in the box, which was found to
contain a pint bottle. The bottle was brought
forth, and the contents were discovered to be
anything but spiritual. They consisted of
editorial articles cut from the columns of the
Chicago Timet, the most violent efforts of
that delectable sheet for the past two or three
months. Strung together they made a succes
sion of powerful phjllippics against the Gov
ernment, which would certainly give no little
iiid and comfort to the South, as the senti
ment of the leading Democratic paper of the
Northwest. The vial of wrath was sent to
Governor Yates, and may cause some trouble
at the Timet office before long.—Corinth i

py*A statement is going the round* of the
papers to the effect that the wheat crop of
Iowa for 1862 amounts to "twenty millions of
bushels, being 1,750,000 bushels more than
the crop of 1861." We suppose the statement
originated with Gen. Wilson, the worthy
Secretary of the Agricultural College, who is
generally pretty good at guessing. We think
he is wide of the mark this time. We don't
claim that Cedar county is the State, nor that
the crop is poor all over the State because it
ia so hen, but from all that we can learn
from other parts of the
State we do not believe
the wheat crop of the State is as large as it was
last year. If wheat buyers are governed, in
their prices, at all by the amount of grain
raised in the country, such statements must
be injurious to the farmer. We should like
to know what part orparts of the State have
been blessed with an unusually large crop of
whaat this ywr. We know that a large por

OUR ARMY CORRESPONDENCE.
'm
CAMP OP THE 18TH IOWA INFANTRY,
SPRINGFIELD, MO., NOV. 17, '62.
DEAR JOURNAL :—After an absence of six
weeks' duration we are again encamped at
Springfield, having arrived here on the 14th
inst. During these few weeks we have
accomplished a great deal, and have seen some
hard service. We have scoured the country
of Southwestern Missouri and Northern Ark
ansas, have traveled a distance of over five
hundred miles, and have succeeded in routing
the rebels and driving them far beyond the
Boston Mountains of Arkansas.
Although, as was anticipated when our
army moved South, no general engagement
has taken place between our forces and those
of the enemy, it was not owing to a lack of
energy in our men, but simply to the fact that
"catching comes before hangingand as the
enemy never stood their ground, of coursc no
hard battle occurred. The Southern troops
may fight well, but it is the opinion of the
boys of the 18th that they run a great deal
better.
Six weeks ago, Missouri was threatened by
an invading army. The rebel forces, in three
divisions, under as many different Generals,
were advancing across her southern border
from Arkansas, and insanely boasted of being
able to take possession of all the principal
points in Missouri, and even to penetrate to
St. Louis. But, to-day, they are scattered to
the four winds, and the majority of them will
probably return to their homes, "wiser if not
better menso that, instead of wintering in
St. Louis, they will probably spend the winter
peacefully around their own firesides.
When I wrote you last, our army was en
camped at Pea Ridge, waiting for something
to "turn up." We left that camp on the 20th
of October, traveling in a southwestern direc
tion to Huntsville, Osage Springs and Fay
etteville, marching sometimes all day and all
night without resting—in one instance going
forty-seven miles in twenty-four hours. The
boys all stood the march like old veterans,
notwithstanding we traversed one of the
roughest and rockiest roads to be found in
Arkansas.
After remaining at Fayetteville one day, our
army started on the march northward. Pre
vious to this, we had been expecting to push
on southward to Fort Smith, on the Arkansas
river, and probably to Little Rock, both of
which places are strongly garrisoned by
secesh troops but, owing to the scarcity of
subsistence for the men and teams, the ap
proaching inclement weather and the great
want of proper clothing among the men,
many of them being entirely barefooted, this
retrograde movement had to be accomplished.
On the road back, we saw numerous evidences
of the destructibility of a passing army—the
fences destroyed for miles and miles, houses
desolated and sometimes burned, broken-down
vehicles, dead horses and mules, and all the
dreary concomitants of war met the eye all
along the route. We made the journey back
in two weeks, stopping several days on the
road.
During this, our first campaign, the 18th,
as already intimated, saw some rather rough
times—about as hard as generally can fall to
the lot of a soldier—aad we are probably en
titled to the appellation of having seen
We have discovered, also, that in
order to become a "bold soldier-boy" one has
a great many privations to undergo. Having
spent several weeks in roving %mong the hills
of Arkansas, we now go under the name and
title of the "Arkansas Travelers"—especially
the skirmishers and their commander.
I forgot before to state that our regiment
was highly complimented by Gen. Totten, at
Fayetteville, who remarked that "they are of
the right stripe, and will prove themselves
heroes when the time comes."
One division of our army is now encamped
in the neighborhood of Pea Ridge. The
remainder of this command is at present
about twenty miles South of Springfield. As
soon as equipped they will probably move
South, when our whole force is expected to
make another advance into Arkansas. Wheth
er our regiment is included in this move I am
not at present informed. We are now at
Springfield for the purpose of drawing our
winter clothing, which we expect to receive in
a few days. The health of our regiment,
which has been very poor, is now rapidly im
proving, and ere long, under the genial influ
ences of a few weeks rest, the'ranks will be
full and the sick-list a blank.
Company E still enjoys good health, and
has suffered less from sickness than any
other. In fact, it is acknowledged by all to
be the "Bully Company" of the regiment, and
under the command of our gallant Captain
(Steph. Estle) we always expect to maintain
that title.
Major Campbell, than whom a truer, braver
and more patriotic man never "trod the tented
field," has been appointed to a position on
Gen. Totten's staff, as Judge Advocate and
Provost Marshal of the 2d Division, Army of
the Frontier.
The weather for the past few weeks has
been very pleasant—similar to September in
Iowa. The only troops now stationed at this
place, with the exception of our regiment, are
about 1,200 Missouri State troops and one
battalion of the 3d Iowa cavalry. Besides
these, there are however about 1,400 sick
confined in the different hospitals here, every
available building in the city being now used
as a hospital. These sick soldiers belong to
the different regiments of this command.

November 9th, 1862.
Dear Journal
—The great battle that long
ere this was expected down here in this wood
en country, remains yet among the things to
come, and really seems further off than when
we first set foot on the sacred [cursed] soil of
Arkansas. There appears to be no immediate
prospect of work of any kind. We are mov
ing about the country, stopping only long
enough in one place to eat out every thing
eatable, either for man or mule, using the rails
for fuel to cook our food with.
How these people are to lire this winter, is
a question that puzzles them not a little and
well it may puzzle them, for we spare them
not. The fact is, we cannot spare them, for
we are on half rations onroelves—breeds
tuffs
being particularly in demand. Armies most
live—and Federal armies wiS five—while
thSte is any thing to live on so, when a
party goes out foraging, every thing eatable,
such as apples, pork, chickens, honey, and
more particularly flour and meal, are seized
and help to fill out a load of hay or oats for
the mules, and the whole load goes under the
general name of forage. All the mills in the
country arc occupied, and arc constantly run
ning, converting secesh grain into Federal
grub. So you can readily see that some body
here must suffer.
Being, as I said, no prospect of a fight, and
being on half rations of bread, Col. Weer has
ordered us on double rations of drill. Our
time-table stands thus: Revielle at six o'clock
breakfast call, half-past six surgeon's call
seven company officers' drill, half-past seven
police gur«rd mounting, eight grand guard
mounting, half-past eight non-commissioned
officers' drill, nine squad drill, ten compa
ny drill, eleven dinner call, half-past twelve
battalion drill, two dress parade, five retreat
and roll call, half-past five tattoo and roll
call, nine taps, half-past nine. No time
being mentioned for supper, one would sup
pose the Colonel sends us to bed supperless
after such a day's work as all that but he
don't not if we know it.
The Journal of Oct. 17th was received last
night. I see you had 3400 Kansas troops re
treating before 700 secesh, and leaving the
field of Newtonia to their possession. This
is a slight mistake of either yours or mine.—
The enemy's force at Newtonia was 7,000 in
stead of 700 and with Col. Cloud or Col.
Weer in command, we would have went into
town, and through it, on that first day's fight
without waiting for Gen. Brown, or any other
Prisoners that fell into our hands say
and we knew it before. As it was, that
evening, when Brown came up, we were equal
in force and could have routed them as easy
as it was done three days later. It was this
same force that Col. Cloud afterwards met at
Maysville, and with less than half their num
bers completely routed them. Indian scouts
that followed their retreat say they never
halted until they reached Fort. Davis, on the
other side of the Arkansas River, opposite
Fort Gibson. The battery captured by Cloud
in that engagement is now manned by men
from the bully old 2nd Kansas, and forms a
part of the 3rd brigade, under Cloud. The
Indiana guns were not among those captured.
Another new Kansas regiment, the 13th,
has joined us recently. The 12th, and the
First Zouavet (African), are on guard duty
in Kahsas. Yours as ever,
E. H. G.
CAIRO, Nov. 27,1862.
MR. EDITOR :—Our journey to this place
was a pleasant one. We could not have
chosen a better time to leave our quarters at
Camp Strong, as we have not had a drop of
rain since.
We are comfortably situated at this place,
with the prospect of remaining here for a
time. Our boys have "seen the elephant" in
the way of doing guard duty, since our ar
rival. We don't guard ourselves, as we did
at Camp Strong, but we guard everything
else. I think if our old friends, the Gray
Beards, desire to do guard duty, they had
better come here. Company A, Capt. Keeler,
is detailed to guard Mound City, seven miles
above, on the Ohio river. Your readers will
remember there is a General Hospital at that
place, in which there are several hundred
sick and wounded. Company A captured one
man, supposed to be a spy, and brought him
to Gen. Tuttle, Provost Marshal at this place.
Company B, Capt. John, has been detailed
to guard the Secesh prisoners which have
been held at this point. They were sent
down the river to-day, and company has
gone into quarters here with the regiment.—
Last night, after the prisoners left, the old
barracks in which they had been quartered
took fire and burned to the ground. Some
thirty or more sick or wounded prisoners,
who were unable to go with the party, were
in the buildings at the time, but ware carried
out by the guards and saved from an awful
death. Many of them were in a sad plight,
indeed, having but little to cover their naked-
Many of the prisoners were of the
"last ditch" kind, while others were ready to
exclaim "It is enough
There have been in the neighborhood of
,800 of the rebels sent from here to Mem
phis or Vicksburg, to be exchanged, since we
came here, besides loads of them which have
not stopped here on their way down. Union
troops, by the thousands, are pass'ng down
daily, for the field.
In talking with the rebels, as they were
marching to and from the boats, I found sev
eral incidents worthy of notice. One of the
guards belonging to company B, while escort
inga party to the boat, was accosted by a
rebel in the ranks who recognized him as an
old neighbor and friend. The rebel had been
Captain in the Southern army, and was cap
tured in Kentucky. The two had a friendly
chat, and parted hoping they might meet
under more favorable circumstances.
Another man, a Unionist, met his brother
among the prisoners. Another of the prison
ers, who had been commissioned in the bogus
government, has in the army of the true
blue" an uncle and two cousins. I noticed a
good-natured "Pat" in the ranks of rebeldom,
who accosted a son of the Emerald Isle, with
"Och! now, and don't you wish ye were go
ing to Y icksburg with us Be jabers,"
said Pat, who had been in the hands of the
rebels until he had well nigh starved—"be
jabers, I've eated ye'r cob-meal too long
alreadyand pointing to a gunboat which
lay in fall view on the river, he added, "I'll
come down to see you on that bull-frog!"
I saw Capt. John and Lieut. Stewart
1
speding bunders," previous to the embarka
tion for Dixie. This operation is done by re
quiring each one of the prisoners to open
whatever package he may have in order to
see whether it contains arms or anything else
belonging to the Government.
The prisoners generally agree that Iowa
soldiers are the hardest to whip in the field,
and are at the same time the most gentle
manly in their conduct towards them as pris
oners.
The boys all look with anxiety for news
from home, and among the number is
INVISIBLE or THE 85TH.
CAMP 25TH IOWA INFANTRY,
NSAJ HELEKA, ASK., NOV. 22,1862
ED. JOWUL Sir: Thinking that seme
of your readers would be pleased to hear from
the 25th, I thought I would inform them of
our whereabouts.
Most of the troops stationed at this point
are from Iowa, and more are arriving daily.
It appears that all Iowa troops are sent to
this place and those from Illinois to Memphis.
We are in Col. Yandever's brigade. It is
composed in part of the 4th Iowa Cavalry,
9th and 25th Infantry and the Dubuque Bat
tery. The 24th Iowa is encamped on the
river, 3 miles from us. Their parade ground
is part of Gen. Pillow's plantation, the build
ings upon which have been mostly converted
into soldiers' quarters. I visited their camp
yesterday, for which I was well paid, as
found the Eichelberger House No. 2 there in
full blast, under the management of my old
friends, Eichelberger and McGrcer. Eichel
berger, as you are well aware, knows how
to keep hotel."
We are having plenty of rain and mud
though the weather is very pleasant and
equally as warm as September in Iowa.
An expedition of about 10,000 troops went
down the river from this point last week, and
about the same number from Memphis.
Their destination is supposed to be up White
River. The troops from this place were com
posed of detachments from all the regiments
here. There are four companies from this
regiment in the number—companies D, E and
G, of Burlington, and company F, of Colum
bus City. We are looking anxiously to hear
of their doing good execution. I have no
hesitancy in saying that by the opening of
navigation next spring, boats may run from
New Orleans to St. Paul with safety, as it ap
pears to be the determination of the military
authorities to have the Mississippi free from
all encumbrances at as early a day as possible,
You may look for a big report" from this
section of the country soon.
Six hundred horses stampeded from the
Government stables in the suburbs of Louis
ville one day last week. In breaking over
the fence twenty-two were killed and the re
mainder escaped.
The Government has completed, or in pro
cess of construction, fifty-one iron-clad mon
sters. They carry two hundred and fifty
eight guns. They vary from three hundred
to five thousand tons burden, the average
being about one thousand tons.
According to the reports in the Adjutant
General's office, the number o! soldiers on the
sick list at the present time amounts to
nearly cne-sixth of the entire army in the
service of the United States—namely, one
hundred and six thousand men.
The increase in the pric of paper falls very
heavily on publishers, especially of news
papers. A journal the size of the New York
dailes, which has a circulation of 50,000 cop
ies a day, loses not less than $150,000 a year
by the recent rise alone, and papers of smaller
circulation and size lose in proportion.
It is officially shown that on James river
34,000 men were absent from McClellan's
army on leave, and 4,000 without leave. This
reflects seriously on the discipline of that
army. An effort is now being made to stop
the desertions by enforcing the penalty and
by stopping the straggling which leads to
desertion.
The Eagle printing establishment at Pough
keepsie, N. Y., was destroyed by fire on the
22d inst. The building and contents were
entirely consumed. Piatt & Schram's loss in
the Eagle office was about $12,000 Insured
for $5,500. G. M. Van Kleeck, owner of the
building and a store underneath, $15,000
partially insured. Mrs. A. S. Underwood's
millinery store. $5,000 insured, $2,000.
The war seems to stimulate rather than
retard railroad improvements. There are no
less than four railroads in progress in Penn
sylvania, forming connections with New
York and Philadelphia, and the West. The
struggle between the two cities is quite ani
mated, to see which shall command the
Western trade.
Mr. Ten Brack, the Ameiican sportsman
in England, was recently swindled out of
$500 by betting that reindeer was spelled
"reindeer," instead of "raindeer," the bet
to be decided by the club's copy of Johnson's
Dictionary. Johnson is the only lexico
grapher who has this bad spell, and Mr. Ten
Brack's antagonist knew the fact when he
made the bet, for which he is to be turned
out of the club.
A train on the Algiers Railroad, near New
Orleans, was destroyed on the afternwn of
the 7th, a quarter of a mile distant from the
Lafourche* station, by the explosion of the
ammunition in a car behind the tender of
the locomotive. About twenty officers and
privates were wounded, and the limbs of
8ome*six or seven persons, supposed to have
been in the ammunition car about the time
of the explosion, were scattered in all direc
tions. According to the Delta eleven per
sons were killed by the accident and seven
teen wounded.
Before the war broke oat, 5,000,000 per
sons were supported in England by cotton
30,000,000 spindles employed in the produc
tion of the yarn, and the capital absorbed ex
ceeded $750,000,000. Four-fifths of the cot
ton consumed in England—800,000,000
pounds—were American.
It is stated that a large number of poor
women in Boston and vicinity are hired to
make woolen shirts for soldiers at the pitia-

frish auctioneer, was the following:" The

Memphis, to-night, to take initiatory measures
to an election of a member of Congress, from
the tenth Tennessee District. The people
seem to be thoroughly aroused with regard to
the matter. Gen. Sherman has given assur
ance that he will render any assistance in
his power. Gov. Johnson is expected to ap
point the day for holding the election.
Incendiaries are trying to burn the city of
Memphis. On Sunday night there were 10
different fires, and on Monday night there
were 14—most of them doing but little dam
age, showing that there is a concerted move
ment to destroy the city. Great alarm exists
in consequence.
The Grand Jury of Hancock county recom
mends to the Legislature to establish a card
ing manufactory at Milledgeville, so that wo
men throughout the State may furnish home
made clothing, and thus come in competition,
with enormous profits of factories.
It further recommends that the production
of cotton be curtailed, and the production of
other necessaries be enlarged. It cries out
against the spirit of gain and speculation that
is ruining the Southern cause and crushing
the poor.
The Grand Jury of Oglethorpe makes the
same presentment.
The great destitution of Southern soldiers
is acknowledged by both of these bodies.
On Tuesday morning about 250 rebel cav
alry took Henderson Station, on the Mobile
& Ohio Railroad, burned the station house,
water tank and 70 bales of cotton, took one
company of Union soldiers prisoners, and
killed one of their number, who refused to
surrender. They also took cotton buyers,
who had considerable sums of money. An
effort is being made to chastise them.
CAIRO, NOV. 28.
Gen. Hurlbut took command of the Mem

several fires occurred. Classical Academy,
among other buildings, was burned.
The people about Grenada are much alarm
ed from a report which has reached them that
General Sherman was coming down to clean
them out.
It has been reported in Mobile that Sher
man was coming South, and that announce
ment has created lively interest there.
The Memphis Bulletin says no more rein
forcements are coming to Pemberton, but that
they are concentrating at Columbia, where it
is said they have extensive ordnance works
and and other Government property of great
value. It is not believed that they will make
a stand at Tallahatchie.
The Richmond Whig says Randolph re

The official vote at the late'election in Ar
kansas foots up: Flanagan, 13,139 Rector,

The Grenada Appeal argues in favor of
South Carolina's proposition to give notice to
the enemy that any Yankee soldiers taken
1
within the limits of the Southern States after
the 1st of January, shall be held as abetting
the crime of the proclamation and hung.
NEW YORK, Nov. 28.
The political prisoners at Fort Lafayette,
including Pierre Soule, have been released.
Claflin, Mellen & Co. have given their cred'
itors notice that they will pay all demands in
full with interest.
The Falmouth correspondent of the Phila
delphia Inquirer, under date of the 27th,
says: "The presumption is that in a very few
days we will have a battle in this vicinity that
will eclipse all others of this war in regard to
ferocity and fierceness. There is not the
slightest doubt but the enemy is in great
force on the other side of the river—equal if
not superior to our own in point of numbers.
I have reason to believe that Gen. Lee is in
command of the whole rebel Potomac army,
exceeding without doubt 125,000 men. Their
camp fires can be seen extending at least ten
miles along the river, and from observation
five miles back into the country.
"The enemy, as usual, has pickets out in
almost impregnable positions and has been
for a few days past working like beavers,
throwing up fortifications. Morning, noon
and night they are at it with spade and pick,
the dirt flying, until the walls or rifle-pits are
completed. Their present position is on the
brow of a range of high hills, some distance
back from the river, with a heavy wood in
their rear. It is my opinion that back of
this range of hills, wnere their present works
are erected, there is another range which
they will occupy if driven back."
NASHVILLE, NOV. 28.
Col. Kirk, of Sill's division, with two com
panies of Indiana cavalry and an infantry
regiment, attacked the rebel cavalry outposts
near Lavergne, yesterday, killing and wound
ing several and capturing three. We had

The rebels had several pieces of artillery.—
The rebel Gen. Meeter is said to be wounded
We chased them several miles.

Gen. Reynolds has been placed in com
mand of the first army corps.
Major Wm. Painter, Aid-de-camp to Gen.
Halleck, has been detailed as Quartermaster

t-Jf" Gen. Rosencranz indulges occasionally
in a witticism. The Nashville Dispatch says
that a lady recently called upon him for the
purpose of procuring a pass, which was de
clined very politely. Tears came to the lady's
eyes as she remarked that her uncle was very
ill, and might not recover. "Very sorry, in
deed, madam," replied the General "my
uncle has been indisposed for some time. As
soon as Uncle Sam recovers a little you shall
have a pass to go where you please."
THB REBEL ARMY.—A correspondent of
the New York Herald says that parties in
Richmond, who should know, estimate the
strength of the rebel army at four hundred
thousand, and say it can be maintained at
that point during the winter. Others say it
is an over-estimate, though he tells where
they are located. The new conscription act
will add three hundred thousand to their force
ard the common talk at Richmond is that
they will commence active operations ia the
spring with 650,0C0 troops.

THINK OF IT.—Out of debt, every sixpence
you get ahead is your own you may look at it

THE FECUNDITY or WEEDS.—It is calcula
ted that a single pig weed, if left undisturbed,
will ripen more than 10,000 seeds, each c&pa
ble of producing a successor. The seeds of
the dock sometimes number over 13,030 on a
plant, and toad flax leaves provision for more
than 45,000 plants the following year. Bur
dock will multiply 21,000 fold, and the com

Scarcely a weed comes to maturity without
scattering from 1,000 or more seeds, to injure
crops and annoy the cultivator.

NEW YORK, Nov. 29.
A letter from Suffolk, Va., 26th, says:
Yesterday Col. Dodge, with two battalions
of his mounted riflemen and one howitzer,
had a spirited but brief engagement with the
enemy at Zenni, on the Blackwater. Having
no orders to cross, he could not pursue his
advantages, and afer driving the enemy back
from the river, he returned to his post. The
only serious causualty on our side was the
severely wounding of private Jones, of the
battery. The enemy's lire was very heavy,
and their force in the woods on the opposite
side of the river and behind their entrench
ments strong, but they had no artillery at
first and our grape and canister troubled
them. They evidently lost several men, for
they fought under cover and had a dense
forest in their rear.
After they had left and our forces were four
or five miles on our way back, we could hear
the fire of a battery, which they had brought
down from Iver, where they have a heavy
force stationed.
It was rumored that Beauregard has pro

A Washington dispatch says that Secretary
Seward looks upon the proposed mediation
of the French Government as an act of friend

what they may do afterwards, and that to
prevent a continuance of the war, or exercise
the least pressure on either party, directly or
indirectly, is in no manner expressed or hint

The army at Lagrange moved yesterday
morning. The troops are in high spirits and
in almost universal good health. They start

possible. One tent is all that is allowed to
twenty men, and one of each company's
wagons to each regiment. The rest of the
baggage will be forwarded by train. The
railroad along the line of march will be or
ganized as they move. The rebels, as they

ponds and creeks. They burn bridges and
Culverts.

HEADQUARTERS or THE ARMY,
November 30,1862.
Considerable excitement was occasioned by
the circulation of a report here that a proposi

istice of 30 days, and that Lee was already in
Washington arranging the terms of the agree*
msnt. No reliance is put in this rumor.
The rebels are working with re-doubled
vigor on their fortifications, and their cavalry
of late have been very active, and have cap
tured a number of our pickets along the fords
of the river—besides two companies of the 3d
Pennsylvania Cavalry, at Harwood Church.
Longstreet commands the right and Hill
the left of the rebel force confronting us.
Deserters coming within our lines report
that a large body of their forces has been de

must be taken with great caution, however.
Onr cavalry have captured a number of
rebels along the river below this place.
