FOR CONTEMPT
jList Includes 84 International
' Officers, District Presidents
and Others Restrained From
Furthering Coal Strike.
Indianapolis, Ind.. Dec. 3.—Ninety
Seven members of the United Mine
Workers of America were cited for con
tempt of court today charged with
Violating the anti-strike injunction.
' Among the defendants are the 84
Jyrter -ational officials, district president
and executive committeemen re
strained by Judge A. B. Anderson from
furthering the strike by any means.
The charges were filed by Dan W.
Simms, special assistant district at
torney in charge of enforcing the in
junction and L. Ert Slack, district at
torney.
The 84 original defendants are cited
tipon the grounds that their action and
talk have encouraged the jpinors to
remain on strike in violation of the
express terms of the Injunction and
that they have made no move calcu
lated to induce the miners to return to
Work.
Officers of Local 2011, Clinton, In
diana, are cited on the charge that
they paid strike benefits. I^ocal No. 39,
Clinton, is charged with having paid
a benefit of 8800 to its members by
withdrawing that sum from the bank
and giving It to the men In five-dollar
hills. Local No. 2011. Is charged with
having paid its members benefits by
checks, attempting to camouflage the
payments as a refund of an over-charge
for dues.
Judge Anderson is to fix bond late
this afternoon for each of the de
fendants.
Deputy marshals who serve the
capiases will carry blank bond forms
and be prepared to accept bond from
each man as soon as he i* arrested.
Judge Anderson set the date when
the defendants are to appear for hear
ing at 10 o'clock next Tuesday morn
ing.
Proceedings io remove defendants
who are outside of Indiana to this
jurisdiction will be began at once. Mr.
Simms declared. He also announced
that proceedings to cite other mem
bers of the Union for contempt will bo
started as fast as the department of
justice brings in the Information and
tlie necessary papers can be made out.
Should Judge Anderson hold the de
fendants guilty of eontemnt his power
Is so broad that he could send them
to Jail for the rest of their lives.
"It will be the purpose of the gov
ernment to continue these prosecutions
as fast as information can be prepared
and file against officials of every local
or district union, who arc working by
concerted action to keep alive the
strike order." Simms declared.

'ITS THE Ilf K
TWIT EVER NO HELP
ME" SIE DECIMES:
Mrs. Anderton Tried Many
Medicines but Got No Relief
Till She Took Tanlac.
"I liave taken a çood many different
medicines, but Tanlac is the only one
that ever did me any good." said Mrs.
Elizabeth Anderson, who lives at 534
Hyde street, San Francisco, Cal., to a
Tanlac representative a few driys ago.
"For five year» I suffered with ner
vous indigestion." continued Mrs. An
derson, "and had a very poor appetite,
and what little I did martage to force)
down would sour on my stomach and
gas would form and press up against
my heart so that it would palpitate
dreadfully, and I could hardly breathe.
My nerves were in very bad^ condition
and I would lie awake at night for
hours at a time, as 1 Just couldn't go
to sleep.
"Finally I got some Tanlac and be
gan taking it, as I hud read so much in
the papers about the good it was do
ing others. To my surprise I began
to improve after the first few doses,
and now since I have taken five bot
tles of this medicine I am like a differ
ent woman. I am not bothered with
indigestion any more, my appetite is
good and 1 can eat anything T want
and everything I eat agrees with me
perfectly. I do not suffer with palpi
tation or shortness of breath and my
nerves are in good condition and 1
sleep simply fine and get up in the
morning feeling rested and refreshed.
Tanlac is a wonderful medicine and I
tell aH my friends about it every time
1 get an opportunity."
Tanlac is sold in Boise by the Joy
Drug Stores.—Adv.

With advice to use all possible

ment of not more than five years, or

Ordinance Posted in Halls to
Specify Usage Forbidden on
Floor—Welfare Director Is
Clear in Definition.
Card« are being placed In Boise
dance halls, by direction of the city
welfare director*, on which are printed
the words of Sec. ft, Ordinance 1109:
"Dancers shall dance with one arm ex
tended or hanging loose, and all close
dancing is hereby prohibited."
This is the gist of the regulation the
authorities are determined to enforce
on dance floor«, and managers of
dance« are being held responsible for
violations, as well as offending dancer«.
The wording of the section, accord
ing to general comment, is peculiar,
and given strict Interpretation might
ban the waltz, fox trot and one-step
altogether, a« well as subject the city
government of Boise to the mercy of
newspaper paragraphes in other
cities. But Miss Elizabeth Bray, city
welfare director, has a sane and definite
idea of what "close dancing" means,
and how it will he interpreted.
"We consider a couple dancing close
ly." she elucidated this morning,
"when the man s nose is in the puff
over the girl's ear, or when not so much
as a sliver of daylight is 1») be seen
between their cheeks."
And when such dancing is seen, «he
does not hesitate to "call down" the
offenders.
"But I am glad to say." she added,
"that the only dancers who have given
us any trouble in this regard are not
Boise young people, hut out-of-town
visitors."

CLASS OFFICERS MEET.
The regular meeting of the student
council and class presidents was held
Tuesday morning. The members dis
cussed movements to benefit and im
prove the school, and the greater need
of vocational guidance. The idea of
regular student council pins was also
brought up. It was moved and sec
onded that a committee of three with
Henrietta Simons chairman, take
charge of the sale of Red Cross stamps
in the school.
SIGN PAINTING CLASS.
Up to now. there has not been a sign
painting class in the high school for
two or three years. Thi« fall a class
was started. Because of crowded con
ditions in the mechanical drawing de
partment there is no special class for
sign painting. Nothing is charged for
the painting of the signs as the class
does not wish to run in opposition to
any sign painting establishment in the
city.
OVATION FOR YOUNG.
Oliver O. Young, former principal of
the high school, was given an enthu
siastic reception when he spoke at the
high school Tuesday afternoon. After
the commotion and cheers which
greeted his appearance had subsided,
Mr. Young spoke on loyalty, especially
loyalty toward one's school.
"Don't let anyone tell you that going
to school is a preparation foi life," he
said, "Going to school is life."
Mr. Young spoke of the industrial
unrest on the Pacific coast, and re
ferred to the Centralia murders as
showing how much more unsettled con
ditions are there than they are here.
The assembly closed with the sing
ing of the school songs, old and new,
and of "America."

FINANCIAL REVIEW
New York, Dec. 3.—The New York
Evening Sun financial review today
aaid :
Today's stock market was consistent
ly strong but th» character and source
of the buying was a matter for conjec
ture. Trading was of very modest pro
portions as offerings were limited. Uni
der these conditions a little push crel
ated considerable momentum and it
was too easy to develop an exaggerated
idea of the buying power.
Perhaps the most telling market fac
tor was the secretary of the treasury's
elaboration of what the president
touched on in his message to congress
respecting tax revision and foreign
financing. Mr. Glass' recommendations
in his annual report called for lower
excess profits levies and if necessary
higher normal taxes. He made it clear,
however, that nothing could be done
along that line until it was estab
lished that government expenditures
were not exceeding present rates. He
was explicit concerning the financing of
Europe's needs.
Both business men and bankers feel
the handicap of the absence of a posi
tive position in our foreign relations
with no immediate prospect of such a
position except the possibility of the
senate declaring by resolution that the
state of war has come to an end. This
is strikingly illustrate in the foreign
exchange market which again broke
badly with sterling below $3.89 and
new lows made in francs and lire alike,
a movement probably accelerated by
Secretary Glass, opposition to govern
ment action to establish the exchange.
