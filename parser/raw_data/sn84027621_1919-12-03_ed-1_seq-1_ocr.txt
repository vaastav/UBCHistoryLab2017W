Sign Protocol to Treaty
of Peace T
(Associated Press)
Paris, Dec. ?. The peace confer
ence has been notified that Germany!
has decided not to sign the protocol
presented to her by the allies as a
condition for putting the peace treaty
into effect.
OUR SENATE DID IT
This attitude is taken as' confirming
reports of a sharp revolution of sen
timent in Germany in the last fort
night. Observers on German develop
ments have expressed to members of
the peace conference the view that
there has been a compelte transfor
mation of the situation in Germany
and that it is due to the failure of the
United States Senate to ratify the
peace treaty. Thus far, it is stated,
no indications have reached Paris as
to any disposition on the part of the
Germans to modify their attitude on
the insistency of the allies for indem
nity for sinking the German fleet at
Scapa Flow, which has been one cause
of German dissatisfaction.
HAD BETTER STAYED AT HOME
The American peace delegation,
with most of its personnel, will sail
for home next week. The date has
not been fixed. The question "of
whether one delegate shall remain to
continue participation in the work of
the supreme council, it is stated, rests
with the state department at Wash
ington. It is understood here that if
none of the delegates remain, Ambas
sador Wallace will be empowered to
participate in peace conference work.
A PROTEST
The supreme council today address
ed a note to Germany protesting
against an increase in German arma
ment, contrary to the peace treaty
terms.

LESS MEAT IF BACK
AND KIDNEYS HURT
Taka a glass of Salts to flash. Kidntys
if Bladder bothers youDrink
lots of water.
Eating meat regularly eventually pro
duces kidney trouble in some form or
other, says a well-known authority, be
cause the uric acid in meat excites the
-kidneys, they become overworked; get
sluggish; clog up and cause all sorts of
distress, particularly backache and mis
ery in the kidney region; rheumatic twin
ges, severe headaches, acid stomach, con
stipation, torpid liver, sleeplessness,
bladder and urinary irritation.
The moment your back hurts or kid
neys erent acting right, or if bladder
bothers you, get about four ounces of
Jad Salts from any good pharmacy;
take a tablespoonful in a glass of water
before breakfast for a few days and your
kidneys will then act .fine. This famous
alts is made from the acid of grapes
and lemon juice, combined with lithia,
and has been used for generations to
flush clogged kidneys and stimulate them
to normal activity; also to neutralize the
acids in the urine so it no longer irri
tates, thus ending bladder disorders.
Jad Salts cannot injure anyone;
makes a delightful effervescent lithia
waier drink which millions of men and
women take now and then to keep the
kidneys and urinary organs clean, thus
avoiding serious kidney disease.

STATE BOARD TRYING
TO ERADICATE HOOKWORM
Jacksonville, Dec. 3. Co-operation
of the Florida school teachers, espec
ially those in the rural districts, is
proving a helpful instrument to the
State Board of Health in its campaign
to stamp out hookworm among chil
dren. The disease is widely prevalent
in all sections of the state.
While hookworm is easily curable,
if allowed to run on it tends to un
dermine the general health of the
child, saps energy and makes its vic
tims liable to other diseases. Symp
toms are easily distinguishable an
emia, pasty skin, indolence, inertia,
flabby muscles, an enlarged abdomen,
digestive disturbances, loss of appe
tite, and n advances cases a rapid
heart and a murmur. It is contracted
by going barefooted, or playing in in
fected soil.
The treatment is simple, requiring
but one day and can be administered
at home. Dr. Ralph N. Greene, state
health officer, is urging parents and
school teachers to assist the state
board with it's fight against hook
worm by watching children closely for
symptoms and procuring treatment
for the child upon the first indication
that it is affected.

Commissioners and Leading Bond Ad
vocates are Already Consider
ing Another Campaign
There were many fluctuations of
opinion on the bond issue election
Tuesday. At suppertime the bond
advocates in Ocala were almost sure
of victory. Ocala had gone two to
one -for bonds and other precincts
sent in reports that put that side
about 250 to the good ''with only
fourteen precincts to hear from," the
bend boys joyfully said.
The old men shook their heads.
They knew what those fourteen pre
cincts could do in "an election. And
they did it. climbing steadily until
bed time, when with only one to hear
from bonds were twenty-five votes
behind.
We have not learned the vote by
precincts. Ocala voted for bonds by
299 to 148. Mcintosh so far is the
banner bond precinct, casting sixty
seven for to one against.
The county commissioners report
this morning that bonds were beaten
by about fifty votes in a total of about
1600 the closest contest we can re
member in this county.
In consequence of this unexpected
ly large bond vote, and the certainty
that many would have voted for bonds
under a somewhat different plan, the
commissioners are considering calling
another election, as the $280,000
worth of help from the federal and
state governments is too much for a
countxto refuse.

Rotarians Will Move Into New Quar
ters at Their Meeting
Friday, the 5th
The Ocala Rotary Club, through
the kindness of the Masons, has ar
ranged to hold all of its luncheons
and meetings fiom now on in the din
ing room of the new Masonic home.
The first luncheon in the new place
vill be on Friday of this week, from
1 to 2 o'clock. The meeting will be
devoted to a presentation and discus
sion of business methods and stand
ards of practice. The recommenda
tions of the international committee
oil business methods will be present
ed. As an aftermath of the world war
a new standard of living has been es
tablished and a new standard of
prices has been established. To meet
these new conditions a revised stand
ard in business must, of necessity, be
brought about. , During the war, for
example, many business houses, un
able to obtain first class materials,
were compelled to use inferior ma
terials in the manufacture of goods.
As a result some concerns will be
tempted to continue the use of in
ferior materials, so long as they can
get away with it.
The war has brought about new re
lationships between employer and
employee. These problems Interna
tional . Rotary is doing all that it can
to help solve.
Every Rotarian in the city should
be at the luncheon Friday. "Big eats"
are promised.
