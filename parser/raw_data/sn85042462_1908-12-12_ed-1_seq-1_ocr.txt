While Tip' Herald Is raisins its fun
for Christmas the Associated Charities
through President H. W. Frank has
made its annual appeal for contribu

It is the appeal that is made in all
large cities for a class of persons who
through various exigencies find them
selves in need of help in midwinter.
In its circulars the solcety says:
P Another Appeal
"Day after day wo hear itthe story
we are going to tell you—you who are
working steadily, year in and year out,
straining brain and brawn In an effort
to hold back a similar fate from your
own dear loved ones.
"Hundreds of men and women are
driven to us from one cause or an
other— lack of employment, sickness,
death circumstances over which some
times they have no control. Men, old
and enfeebled in mind and body, come
like children asking to be cared for
men, young, asking for work; women,
widows, the only support of a little
family, looking to us for food, clothing
and rent; and then, the pity of It, these
mere remnants of humanity, driven
here by the great while scourfe, plead
ing with us for help in the fight
against the fate that has overtaken
them.
"All his is our work, the work of
the Associated Charities. Their neces
sities are our necessities; they must
be recognised.
"The helping hand we must extend. •
Peace and Good Will Time
"The part we wish especially to draw
to jour attention is this: Christinas is
here -thai time of year when peace
and good will to man fill the hearts of
all, the season when childish hearts
swell with expectation, when mothers
smile and dream of the pleasures ii
Store for loved ones; or. on the other
hand, weep anil are sad when thinking
only of tin- disappointments in store
for their little ones. It is for these
less fortunate ones that we send forth
the call for assistance, that assistance
that we may be enabled to brighten
their homes and make glad their
hearts. Will you Join us?
" 'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto
one of the least of these, ye have done
It unto me.'

excites considerable discussion lasting
tthe house of representatives todaj
he legislative, executive and Judi
appropriation bill, which usuall
Ites considerable discussion lastin
for several days, was passed with little
debate and practically In the shape it
came from the committee.
An unusual feature was that no
member asked for time to indulge in
general talk.
The facility with which the bill of
165 pages was put through was th
subject of much comment on the floor,
and the members of the appropriations
committee felicitated themselves on the
outcome. The bill carries an approprii
atlon of $31,665,320.
The house immediately after conven
ing unanimously and without debate
adopted a resolution providing for the
appointment of a committee of five to
consider the reference to the secret ser
vice In the president's message, and to
suggest what action if any should be
taken In the matter.

a "movement to pay political debts

hypocrisy about the whole business,"
he added.
Keefe Is Defended
Mr. Mann of Illinois defended Mr.
Keefe, and asserted that whatever may
have been the reasons for his appoint
ment, "he was well qualified and would
perform his duties with fidelity."
Except In three or four instances,
when' increases In salaries were de
nied, the bill underwent no changes
and It was passed by a viva voce vote.
A bill Introduced by Representative
Hawley of Oregon authorizes the sec
retary of the interior to place on the
pension roll, tinder the same terms
granted by law to officers and soldiers
of other Indian wars, the names of
officers and soldiers of the Bannock

Washington in 1878 and 1879.
On account of the "unsettled finan

two years just passed," Representative
Humphreys of Washington introduced
today a resolution extending for five
years from June 1, 1910, the time during
which the Alaska Short Line Railway
and Navigation company may have to

RAPIDLY INCREASING
NKW YORK. Dec. 11.—Speaking be
fore a gathering of alumni of Dickinson
college last night —calle M. Shaw, for
mer secretary of the treasury, appealed
to the college men to save the country
from .Socialism.
'Mr. Shaw said in part: "I am alarmed
at the trend toward Socialism In this
country today. If there is any power in
this country to stem If, it ought to be
the trained minds of college men. Four
out of Aye commencement day orations
are purely Socialistic. 1 have met many
of the teachers of sociology In our schools
and universities. With few i exceptions
these teachers are Socialists, as you can
find by a few ; moments' conversation
with them, and the few exceptions are-'
Anarchists."

ST. LOUIS, Dec. 11.— F. Yoakum,
chairman of the executive commit
tee of the Rock Island-Frisco
lines, tonight* sent to the Associated
Press the following statemtnt relative
to the Inland waterways movement:
"If the newspaper reports from
Washington are correct, I am disap
pointed at the action of the commercial
bodies of St. Louis and Chicago In their
work for government appropriation for
the improvement of our inland water
ways.
"I presume they hesitate to ask for
larger sums on account of the past
policy of the government In dealing
with this question of national Impor
tance.
"What can we expect to accomplish
in our country's growth with the Insig
nificant sum of $7,500,000, to be followed
by the inadequate sum of $50,000,000 an
nually, to be dribbled out over the next
ten years? '
"Any plan that does not contemplate
work on a large scale means in the
future what we have had in the past
no substantial Improvement.
"I regret to observe that some of our
leading men in public life are Indorsing
the policy of the government Improve
ment of our waterways on the theory
that it would be an Instrument of reg
ulation, for such views are narrow and
inconsistent with the facts."'
"It Is not a problem of rate regula
tion, but of traffic facilities. •
"If the government undertakes the ;
work it will require from ten to fifteen;
years to gain the benefit which we
should have.
"In the meantime, the country will
continue to grow, and unless the farm
ers and manufacturers served by the'
railroads can have their traffic prompt- %
Iy handled at Inland ports, the loss
will fall upon the farmer, the manufac
turer and the merchant alike.
"If the government wishes to make a, *
practical success of the deep water- ~
ways, let It use enough money to pro-'
duce results."
