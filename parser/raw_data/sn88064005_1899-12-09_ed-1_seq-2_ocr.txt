Mark Hanna has not been heard
from since the election. Evidently
he lina taken those Cuyahoga 'county
returns very much to heart.
The I. & V. and Southern Pacific
will have tickets on sale December
20, 21 and 22d to all points at one
fare for the round trip, good for re
turn 30 days from date.
The burning of Crowley College
last Friday iht is a severe blow to
that town, as the institution was well
patronized and helped in promoting
the advantages of the place.
The cane farmers who are selling to
outside refineries have finished deliv
ering and are now enjoying the fruits
,of their labor. Although the crop
was short this year the season has
been unusually fine.
Mr. Bailey, of Texas, has declared
that Mr. Bankhead is his choice for
minority leader of the House of Rep
resentatives. Mr. Bailey has been
there himself and ought to know the
kind of man needed to tackle the
rampant majority.
Senator Daniel has been advanced
o4 Presidential proportions through
the efforts of an energetic and able
Richmond journal. The party might
go farther and fare worse, but indi
cations now point to the renomina
tion and the election of Mr. Bryan.
After wobbling on the cunency
question for years, it is at last an
nounced that McKinley has sufficient
ly stiffened his dorsal vertebrae to
urge that some step be taken toward
enacting a gold standard. It would
be well for\the majority to hurry up,
as he may change his mind.
No less a competent legal authority
than a former Republican Senator of
the United States, Hon. George F.
BlE unds, of Vermont, declares that
Re.sentative-elect ' Roberts sla d
be protected in his constitutioa~1
rights, and if elected prorly, b
m~orn in as a member of the House.
Former Senator Call of Florida de
clares that his defeat was brought
about by the money of the Standard
Oil Company. Trusts in Florida, he
says, are fourishing finely. Why not
name Mark Hansa as a committee of
one to become acquainted with this
latest form of Republican monopoly
fostering.
Ml c Lean is prominently
Swntione k[r. Bryan's running
nma. anit year. Mr. McLean's ex
perience in the recent Ohio campaign
has probably furnished him ow0t4nome
large siaod ideas relative to the prae
tical aid. d politics, and he would
make a competent colleague for the
silver advocate.
Elihu Root for Vice-President
seems to be the choice of the New
York State publican boss, Tom
Platt. Mr. ot, however, should
be very wary. It would be well for
him to keep in mind the fate that
overtook Morton in 1896. Tom is a
very sleek trickster. Woodruff is a
man after his own heart and would
have the nominatiod-if the wily Tom
dared to urge him for the place.
The President's essage.
President McKinley sent his annual
message to Congress whieh was read
Tuesday in both Houses. After
making a brief reference to the death
of the Vice President, congratulates
the Congress on the prosperous con
dition of the country and the excel
lent status of government funds and
the retirement of bonds; calls atten
tion to the growing scarcity of money
and urges increased issue through
national banks; urges redemption of
greenbacks in gold and their retire
ment; encouragement of merchant
marine, presumaily by subsidy; calls
attention to the trust evil, and hopes
for relief through uniform State laws,
supplemented by Federal enactments;
says foreign relations are satisfactory;
calls attention to the importance of
an isthmian canal, and invites the at
tention of Congress anew to the pro
ject; recommends commission to,
study Chinese trade; urges securing
of more space at the Paris Exposi
tion; devotes special mention to cor
dial relations with Germany; relates
progress of negotiation of disputes
with Canada; has "avoided alliances
not of direct concern" in South Afri
ca; discusses at length the Tallulah
lynchings, and says the contingency
has arisen for giving Federal courts
jurisdiction in such cases; recom
menis laying of cable to Manila; re
cites the partition of the Samoan I.
lands. Concerning Cuba, the Prei
dent is eloquent but vague, saying
pledges of self-government must
kept, but not mentioning indepen
ence, but, on the contrary, asserti'v
"the destinies of Cuba are * *
£rrevocal4 linked with our own, 1t
how and how far is for the future
determine;" the American mini
has been instructed to press for
early settlement of claims against
Turkey; the maintenance of the fu
reau of American Republics for ten
mere years is regarded with gratiflBs
tion, and the Pan-American Exposi
tion, he hopes, will tend more firmly
to cement the friendship of nations on
this continent; congratulates tij
country on the outcome of The H
conference and the volunteers on
prompt enlistment and services a tBe
late wat; felicitates the navy tthe
fact that it has maintain e gal
lantry that characterized i brilli at

Congressman Crumpacker's seir
bill to cia down the vote'f the'Soath
in the electoral college because large
numbers of negroes are denied the
right of suffrage in certain States is
causing considerable comment. In
noticing the matter the New ,Orleans
Telegram very appropriately remarks:
"One of the New England States has
a property qualification for suffrage,
but there has never been any suggesr
tion of depriving , of rongressional
representation an the sout. The
theory is that non .- o s holders la
that State have a right to .eps
o in i Congress, even if they have
no voice '/. le ion. his t eory
is moreaP to oo

while not capab - 1

makers, State and national."
Before Aguinaldo rebelled against

It the clamor of the Republieans
against the yating of Roberts were
based upon the sincere conviction
that he was an improper representa
tive, 'it is safe to assume that the
great body of thinking Democrats
the country over would join heartily
in th4 movement to deprive him of
the ri.t to participate in the deliber

'h4htrusts are an issue that the Re

Mr. IBiran's marvelous work in
Nebraska caused that State to remain
in t P, .erocratic column. Now that
the a. ipt der is about to visit the
East] $here is a small sized panic
among members of the G. O. P., and

4tr royly inclined President has
b e so sensitive relative to his do
ings that any *riticism on the part of
a dloor government clerk brings down
pe Administration wrath to the point
f dismissal. Noble E. Dawson, a
blerk in the War Department, has
been removed for criticising the
President. Evidently free speech is
restrioted not only in Russia and in
China, but in the United States as
well.
That is an unseemly controversy
