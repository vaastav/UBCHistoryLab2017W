a re-organization ol the Militia of tho
country upon a uniform basis, go that the
militia can bo made effective for active ser
vice at any moment, is urged upou the at
tention ol Congress. A change is recommend
ed in tho relations of regulars and volunteers
in the service, to promote unity of action and
encourage merit ; and that seniority of com
mission carry the right to command, in all
cases. Consolidating tho regular and volun
teer force during tho war, would give power
aDd efficiency to tho army. A change in
some particulars, to promote enlistment into
the regular army 13 recommended.
It is possiblo that tho Secretary of War
keeps in mind tho ferocious howls against
him, which filled tho land when he made
arrangements to have regiments from tho
East transported by tho way of Harrisburgh ,
Pa., instead'of by tho moro direct route from
New York through Philadelphia ; for ho
tells the country that, by that measure, he
knockeil in tho head a virtual combination
of tho lUilroad corporations, to extort an
exorbitant price from tho Government for
the transportation of troops. The direct
lines charged $C per man ; that route
took them for 4 per man. The result was
a reduction of thirty-three and a third per cent.
in tho fare for tho transportation of soldiers
by all the roads in tho loyal States.
" Extraordinary labor, onercy and talent havo
been required of the various bureaus of tais de
partment to provide for the wants of our iiniueuso
army. While errors may havo been occasionally
committed by subordinates, and while extravagant
prices have undoubtedly in some cases, controlled
by basto and tno pressure 01 rapid event?, been
paid for supplies, it is with great gratification that
C refer to the economical administration of affairs
displayed in the various branches of the service.
Uur forces not only Baa to 00 armea, cioincu ana
fod.tut bad to be suddenly provi .ed with means of
transportation to an extent ncreioxoro unparallel
ed. While I believo that thcro is no army in tho
world better providod for in every respect than
our regulars and volunteers, I candidly think that
no force so large and so well cquippod, was over
put into tho field in so short a spaco of lime at so
small an expense
Wbilo it is my intention to preserve tho strictest
economy and accountability, I think the last dollar
should be expended and the list man should be
armed to bring this unholy rebellion to a speedy
and permanent close.
"Tho geographical position of tho metropolis
of tho natior., menaced by tho rebels, and required
to be defendod by thousands of our troops, iuduccs
mo to suggest for consideration tho propriety and
expediency of a reconstruction of the boundaries
of the States of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.
Wisdom and truo statesmanship would dio ate
that tho coat of th National Government, fur all
time to coma, 6hould be placed beyond rcasonablo
danger of seiiuro by enemies within, as well as
from capture by foos from without. By agree
ment between tho States named, such as was effect
ed, for similar purposes, by Michigan and ohio,
and by Missouri and Iowa, thoir boundaries could
be eo changed as to render tho capital more re
mote than at present from tho influence of Stato
governments which havo arrayed themselves in
rcocllion."
The chango proposed by the Secretary,
would set tho peninsula between tho Chesa
peake und the Atlantic, now belonging
partly to Maryland, partly to Virginia, over
to Delaware ; the part of Virginia cast of
the Blue ridge over to Maryland ; and the
two northern counties ol Maryland (Alle
ghany and Washington) between the upper
waters of Potomac River and Pennsylvania,
over to Virgiuia-Maryland so enlarged also
to consent so to modify her State constitution
as to limit tho basis of her representation to
her white population.
The Report concludes as follows :
"Tt is alreadv a crave aucstion what shall bo
dnoe with these laves who aro abandoned by their
owners on tho advance of our troops into southern
territory, as at Beaufort district in fcoutn wro
lin. Tho numbar left within our control at that
point is very considerable, and similar cases will
probably occur. What shall be dono with them ?
Can wo afford to send them forward to their mas.
ters, to be by them armed against us, or used in
producing supplies to maintain tho rebellion ?
Theii labor may be useful to us; withheld from
tho enemy it lessens his military resources, and
withholding them has no tendency to Induco tho
horrors cf insurrection, even in tho rebel commu
nities. They constitute a military resource, and
boing such, that they should not bo turned over
to the enemy is too plain to discuss. Why de

The disposition to bo made of the slaves of rebels
after the close of tho war can bo safely left to the
patriotism and wisdom of Congress. Tho rcpre-

curo to tho loyal slaveholders every right to

A momentary 6tir has been made over the
lact that after Secretary Cumcron's Report
had been put in print and copies sent to
sundry newspapers, previous to the delivery
of the President's message, at tho instance
of the President those copies were recalled,
and about a dozen of tho last paragraphs
condensed into one. The N. "X . Tribune's
copy was not recalled at least not till tho
original report was in print, on the outside
of that paper. On the insido the new par
agraph was given, and a statement made of
how tho original came to appear. Iho i n
bunc indicates plainly enough its opinion
that the change was much for tho worse, and
its Washington correspondent gave a sensa
tion accouut of-a fierce contention between
thoFrcsident end the Secretary of War, on
tho subject of the change The account has
a most apocryphal look, and wc presume
will prove to havo as little truth in it as
many other reports from " reliable sources"
in Washington to tho . Y. papers. As for
any difference worth making a stir about,
the two reports, we arc not able to sco it.
The original portion, as given in the Tribune,
had a gooi deal of "spread caglo" in it, and
was mostly mado up of arguments to show
that the Government had as good a right to
confiscate the blaves of rebels us any thing
thing else which they call property, and to
use the slaves, if necessary, as soldiers agaiust
the rebels. Thus :
"If it thai I be found that tho mea who havo been
held by tho rcbols as slaves are capablo of bear
ing arms and performing efficient military service,
it is the right, and may become the duty, of tho
Government to arm and equip them, and employ
their services azainst the rebsls, under proper
military regulation, discipline, and command."
The authorized juragraph omits all
the ' rpr&id ci;;!!'' and most of the argu
mentation; but it ..vs nothing whicli can
corjlcl in the least with the joeition of the
lew lines quoted above. It bays plainly that
the slaves left within the control of our
army constitute a "military resource" (of
course to be used as military reasons shall
show best, in any particular case,) and that
they are not to bo returned to tluir masters
"to bo armed against us or used in intro
ducing supplies to maintain the rebellion."
and that is enough to say. The suppressed
paragraphs would doubtless be mora escit-
fng to many readers than the ono which
stands ; but the substantial difference if a
practice had to bo founded on them, by any
commanding officer, is not worth 6peak'ingof.

SECRETAItV WELLES' RETORT.
The Report ol the Secretary of the Navy
18 an ajile and luimrmss Him ,lnmn-f--
taken in connection with the important na
val operations on the Southern coast, which
have so much gratified tho country, i an
overwhelming rebuke to thoss who a few
months ago 60 ferociously assailed its au
thor ao an imbecile do-nothing, who must
be pushed out of offieo before any thing of
value could be effected. How tho great dogs
did howl ! And how tho littlo barkers did
yelp in concert all over tho land ' And how
whist they have all been lately ' The proof
is overwhelming that Mr. Welles has been a
laborious, capablo and far seeing man in his
particular department who saw what was
to be done, and sot himself to do it with un
common energy and system,
Starting in his report from tho exhibit
which he made of the condition and wants of
tho Department in his report of July 4tb,
ho first states the three great things whicli
were to be done .
'1. Tho closiDjr of all tho insurgent ports along
a coast line of nearly three thousand miles, in the
form and under the exacting regulations of an in
ternational blockade, including the naval occupa
tion and defence of the Potomao river, frrm its
moutu to tho federal capital, as the boundary lino
botween Maryland and Virginia, and also tho
main commercial avenue to the principal baso of
our military operations.
2. Iho organization of combined naval and
military expeditions to opcrato against various
points ol tho southern coast, rendering efficient
naval co-operation with the position and move
ments of such expeditions when landed, and in
cluding also all needful naval aid to tho army
in cuttine off intercommunication vitu tlie rebels
and in its operations on the Mississippi and its
tributaries; and
3. Tho active pursuits of tho piratical cruisers
which might escape tho vigilance of the blockad
ing force and put to sea lrom tne rebel ports.
Theso were duties which tne navy was called
upon at tho samo time to prepare for and per
ioral, and tccy constituted a tripio taste more ar
duous, it is believed, in Eome respects, than has
before been demanded from the inaritimo of any
government."
To efiect these objects, tho vessels scattered
under tho former administration to remote
parts, had to to recalled as fast as they could
be, others laid up had to bo mado ready for
service, new ones had to bo built, and a
largo number purchased from the commercial
marine, and fitted for warlike purposes.
Tho report alludes to tho subject of blockading
ports by sinking vessels, and states that the "stone
expedition" basgono to Charleston and Savannah.
"This, if effectually done, will prove the most
economical and gratifying method of interdicting
commerce" Xho number of vessels seized by our
naval squadrons, mostly in attempting to run tho
blockado, has been ono hundred and fifty-three.
The greater part have boon condemned after adju
dication. Tho events connocted with the coast
ex editions to Iiattcras Inlet and Port Royal aro
recounted. Tho reason why tho formor was not
followed up by securing a position on tho main
land, arose from tho inadequacy of tho military
force accompanying it
On tho subject of privateering tho report eays it
will be expected that "men who had violated law
and moral obligation to gratify inordinate ambi
tion," would betako themselves to piracy. As to
the escape of tho Sumter, " by somo fatality Ehe
was permitted to pas3 the Brooklyn, and after a
brief and feeble cha;e by tho latter, permitted to
pass on her voyage." Although " a piratical ro
ver," ht regrets that she has been received and
tupplicd against the remonstrances of our consuls,
by public autuoritiej in many loreign ports.
Itcferring to tbo capturo ot Mason ard slidell,
tho Sccrotary eays. "Tbo prompt and decisive
action of Capt. Wilkes on this occasion merited and
received tho cmphatio approval of the department,
and if a too generous forbcaranco was exhibited by
him in not capturing tho vessel which had theso
rebel emissaries on board, it may, in view of tho
circumstances, and his patriotic motives bo excus
ed; but it must by no nrans be permitted t3 consti
tute a precedent hereafter for the treatment of any
case of similar nfracthi of ntu'ral obligations by
foreign Vfssris rngiyd in commerce or the carrying
trade.
On the 1th of March last, all tho government
vessels available! for servico against tho rebels,
were enly four in number, carrying twenty-five
guns. Our navy now consists of 2C1 vessels of all
sizes, carrying 'J,557 guns, and having an aggre
gate tonnago of 218,010 tons. Tho number of
seamen now employed is 22,000. Of 130 vessels
purchased, wo find that 79 aro propelled by steam;
all tho 52 constructed or nearly finished are steam
vessels. Tho difficulty encountered in the pur
chasing of vessels must bavo been great, on ac
count of tho largo number thrust upon tho depart
ment. The Secretary explains tho plan resorted
to for tho purpose of securing the most serviceable
ships at tho most economical prices. Tho results,
we think, speak for themselves in tho late expedi
tion at Port Royal, and the fact that not a com
plaint of corruption has been publicly made
against tho agent now employed la this important
duty. In tho navy yard, though eleven thousand
mechanic have been steadily employed, tho gov
ernment has been obliged to resort to private
yards, so urgent waB tbe call for vessels of war
A passing allusion is mado to tho mail-clad
vessels now building; and'vo aro assurol that
wisdom has been shown in dealing with tho great
difficulty of combining weight of armor with
lightness of draught, if this has not been entirely
overcome.
g"Ihe efficiency of tho navy may unquestionably
bo largely Increased by croating moro grades , and
I would recommend that tho permanent organiza
tion of (he lino officers be as follows:
11 a g officer to command squadrons.
Commodore, "1 ...
Captain, I To command single
Commandor, I ships.
Lieutenant commander, J
Lieutenant,
Master,
Paescd midshipman,
Midshipman,
Cadet,
Tho lieutenant commanders, a grade UEed dur
ing the revolution, may bo employed as first lieu
tenants, and in tho command cf tho smaller class
of naval vessels.
Tho present rato of pay may bo ro apportioned
amomr tho different srades that in tho aggregate
thcro shall bo no increase. Lot no officer bo ad
vanced to any crado above that of passed midship
man. except upon nomination of of tho President
and confirmation by tbo Senate, alter a board ot
officers shall have pronounced him morally, physi
cally and professionally competent to porform all
his duties, both ashore and afloat."
On tho subject of "fugitives," tho Secre
tary speaks to tho point. His orders havo
been jusrtlnd proper :
In tho coastwise and blockading duties of tho
navy it has been not unfrequent that fugitives
from insurrectionary places havo sought our
ships for refuge and protection, and our naval
commanders have applied to me for instruction as
to tho proper disposition which should bo mado of
sucn relugccs. luy answer uaa ucca mat, n m
snrpents. they sh uld bo handed over to tho cus
tody of tbo gevcrnment; but if, on tbo contrary,
they wero freo from any voluntary participation
in tho rebellion and souzht tho ohelter and pro
tection of our flag, then they should bo cared for
and employed in somo usoful manner, and might
bo enlisted to servo on our public vessels or in our
Navy l'ards, receiving wages for our labor.
such employment could not be furnished ti all by the
navv. thev might be referred to (he army, and if no
employment could be fottnd for them in the public ser
vice, they snouia ot auovea to prozeca jreciy anu
rraceablv wdhoul restraint to seek a livelihood in any
loyal portion of the country. This I havo consid
ered to be me wuoio requireu uuij, m iub iicuii
ses, of our naval officers."
REPORT OF SECRETARY SMITH.
The Report of the Secretary of tho Inte
rior, Hon. Caleb B. Smith, reviews the ope
rations ot tne lanu ornce. xno war nas
naturally put an almost cntno stop to sales
of tho public lands for the present.
The net incomo for the last year will
hardly reach $200,000. The Secretary ob
jects to the issue of bounty land Trarrantfl to
volunteers now in the serviceas it would ab
sorb over 100,000.000 acres of land to fill the
warrants. An immense deprecation of their
value would follow. Speculators would
absorb them and tho government revenue
from that source be comnletelv destroyed. The
secretary recommends that a tax should oe
levied upon those who engage in working
tne valuable mineral lands of California and
New Mexico, for tho privilege of doing so.
j-No other government ever neglected such a
source of revenue, and as the lands belong to
tho whole people, it is obviously just that
those who reap tho advantage ot mining
them should pay for tho privilege.
Our Indian affairs aro in a very unsettled
and unsatisfactory condition, owing to tho
rebellion, somo ot the tribes having been co
erced into it, viz : portions of tho Oherokoes,
Chickasaws and ChoctawB. It is believed
soon as the United States re-establish their
authority in tho territories occupied by
them. Tho payment of their annuities has
Dcen suspended, but tho "secretary recom
mends that tho usual appropriations be
made, according to treaty stipulations, that
tho means may exist to pay them if it should
be deemed expedient hereafter. The tribes
upon the Pacific slopo of the Rocky Moun
tains havo manifested a turbulent spirit, but
havo committed no acts of violence. In New
Mexico the Indians havo caused much'troublo
in consequence of the withdrawal of tho
Federal troops and tho instigation of rebel
emisssaries from Texas.
The practice of licensing traders to traffic
with the Indians has been productive of mis
chievous results, and tbo S cretary recom
mends that the whole system bo broken up
and tho Indians hereafter paid in goods and
agricultural implements purchased by Gov
ernment at the lowest prices. In uo way
can tho Indians bo protected from outrageous
impositions except by destroying tho present
system.
luc l'at2nt ornce business nas laiien oil
greatly. A deficit of abovo $80,000 has
occurred within the past nine months of tho
year, and a large reduction of clerical force
has been made to meet tlio reduction ol tho
business.
The Pension list has diminished during
the year 575. Thoro wero yet on the rolls
on the 30th of June, 10,709, requiring for
their payment $1)5 ,i i '1 Ub. ihey included
03 Revolutionary soldiers.
Tho becretajv gives 6trong reasons why a
Bureau of Agriculture and statistics should
be established.
The suppression of tho African slavo trad
was intrusted to tho Department of the In
terior, and ttio secretary recommends that
fast war steamers bo substituted lor sailing
vessels as cruisers on tho coast of Africa, as
being much more efficient. The mcst vigor
ous measures will continue to bo employed
to prevent slavers lrom being htted out at
our porti.
The outrages which havo been committed
with impunity for a long time in Washing
ton against persons of color guiltless ol any
crime, are notorious. Under old Maryland
laws in furce in the District of Columbia,
or on other pretences, such persons, some
times free, and cometimes fugitives from
rebel niasterfl,havc been seized by country con
stables, or polica officers, and put into prison
and tlicro kept in great suffering, for dishon
est purposes. The subject has been brought
before Congress, and stringent measures to
lo away with thi3 abuse arc likely to be
adopted speedily. Secretary Seward has ad
dressed a noto to Gen. McCicllan, informing
him that the insurrectionary conduct of
masters is a full and sufficient answer to all
further claim to service or labor from those
who have escaped from them, and that their
arrests as fugitives from labor or servico
should bo immediately followed by the mili
tary arrest of the parties making tho seiz
ure. Copies of this communication will bo
sent, he says, to the Mayor of the City of
Washington, and to the Marshal of the Dis
trict ot Columbia, that any collision bctwec
tho military and civil nuihority may bo
avoided.
The U. S. Prisoseks in Charleston Jail.
Tho letter from our New York correspondent,
in to-day '8 Pree Press, gives some painful
intelligence concerning tho treatment now
given to the U. S. soldiers who aro prisoners of
war in Charleston. Private letters from Capt.
John T. Drew of the Vt. 2d, who is ono of
that unfortunate number, fully confirm tho
statements. Tho prisoners aro treated as
felons, are shut in filthy cells in the City
Jail, aro half starved; sick and well aliko
must sleep on tho hard floor without cover
ing, and with their shoes for their only pil
low, while outragaous insults aro daily and
hourly added to physical injury and suffer
ing. Wo trust that an exchange cf prison
ers will soon end this state of things. It is
stated that General McClellan has strongly
urged a general exchango, and Congress will,
f necessary, probably add its request, to tho
samo purpose, liut at any rate, ana until
an exchange is effected, the rebel chieftains
should be notified that Mason, Slidcll,
Faulkner, Barron, and tho officers and pri
vates captured at Hattcras, Bhall receive tho
same treatment that is meted out to our own
gallant soldiers ; und tho notico should bo
carried out to tho letter.
We subjoin a portion of a letter from
Cant. Drew, which with somo other com
munications to his friends, reached us
through a sailor of tho ship Gienada, which
was captured by the rebels and carried into
Charleston. Her crew were confined for ten
days in tho jail with the U. S. prisoners, and
then released. Ono of the number reached
Now York on Monday, bringing with him
the letters, or scraps of manuscript rather,
alluded to, whicli were concealed in an old
pipo and about his person, and thus evaded
tho search of the jailors. The Captain dates
from " Head quarters, advanco of tho U. S.
Army, Charleston Jail," and claims the
credit for himself and fellow piisoners, of
having fully executed tho "On to Rich
mond" movement, with additions not down
in tho programm c. Ho says ;
V'o wore treated vory well until tho Hatteras
expedition. Then wo were deprived of ovory
thing but just enough to keep body and soul to
gether. Everything that could goad and vex us
was practiced. 'Wo wero mado to stand and an
swer tc oar names twico a day, and wero ordered
round at tho point of tho bayonet. Even Gen.
Winder, who had been very kind to us, became
tyranical. Somo of us, who could not patiently
endure every insult, were picked out as " insolent
and inEubordinato," and sent South. Wo were
assured that if any chance occurred we should bo
very decently hung,"
Whllo in Castle Pinckney we were courteously
treated; tho guards being native born Carolinians
were generally gentlemanly. But on the com
mencement of tho trial cf the privateersmen, we
were sent iojail, and shoved into the dirtiest cells;
and here we aro with no furniture, living on
bread an J water, and a little meat, and only half
rations at that. Many of iu aro siek, and .we
are all ragged. If any privateersmen are hung
'they will hardly be able to keep the mob from us,
but we shall giye them a slight brush at least.
The prisoners will remember these things. AH
I ask is to get back to my company and get a
chance at these fellows.
I have had the fever; but am now very well.
Imaynovirgetout of this alive, but lean say
that I have tried to do my duty, and have noth
ing to regret but my inability to fight, those fel
lows at Manassas.
My regards to all my friends.

Correspondence of tho Free Press.
LETTER FROM NEW YORK.
Xtw Yonic, Dec 2, 1S61.
Messrs. Editors of the Free Press :
I have this morning had a talk with a man di
rect from Charleston, S. C, and havo thas been
put in possession of somo interesting information
concerning affairs in Scccssia. There aro. in tho
common, jail at Charleston 33 officers and 133 pri
vates, taken at tho battlo of Bull Run; treated
iike convict?, except that they aro not ironed.
They get three cakes of pilot bread and a little
piece of maggoty bacon, with a small allonacce of
coffee, (this is about half rations,) are ragged
to tho last degree, slocp on the bare earth, and
aro reviled and abused continually. Vet they
keep up good heart, and bear their captivity liko
men. A number of sailors tho crew of the ship
Grenada, which was captured somo time previous,
being sent on North, generously gave them all
the clothing and bedding they could possibly
spare. It was but little, but made a few of them
moro comfortable. Capt. Drew had been in poer
health, but fared no better than tho rest. I send
you a littlo note from him. There arc three other
Vermont ers, whose names my informant did not
remember.
The prisoners aro jealously guarded, no inter
course being illowed with the inhabitants, and
nothing has reached them from their friends, ex
cept that Capt, Gordon of tho Regulars, onco got
a package. Letters, clothing, money, all is pro
bably sciioJ by tho rebels. Tho only amusement
tho prisoners havo is to walk to and fro in the
prison grvunds. Thoy wero removed from Castle
Pincknoy to thejjail about firo wcoks. since. In
the Castlo they wero treated moro decently, but
wero compelled to pay heavy " prices foi every
thiog.thcy bought. Sinco tho taking of Iiattcras
they arc villainously treated. Every person en
tering or leaving tho jail is searched, to mako
suro that nothing is smuggled in or out for tho
'Yankees."
Thcro aro not many troops about Charleston,
and so great was the fright after the taking of
Beaufort, that ono thousand men could easily
havo takon possession of tho city gMany houses
are shul their occupants having fled, and many
havo packed up ready to leavo at an hour's warn
ing. Of many things thero is great lack; the
medicino chest of tho Grenada was eagerly seized;
the watcrpipes and eavo troughs havo been torn
from tho houses (o supply lead for bullets. The
cargo of tho Grenada, sugar and molassts, sold
for $75,000; it might perhaps havo been worth
$50,000 in Now York. Tho Gonadal was cap
tured by tho privateer Sal lie, no resistance being
offerod, and taken into an inlot thirty or forty
miles below Charleston. The Sallie ran on tho
bar going in, and was injured so much that sho
will not go to sea again.
There is intercourse still with tho North. Tho
New York papers aro received in Charleston, and
extracts from tho Herald aproar daily in their
papers. Cel.Corccran is supplied with papers how,
was not stated. Thcro aro many Irish among tho
rebel troops thcro who feel much sympathy for
him.
Money, specie is exceedingly scarco, and
shinplastcra of cwry kind and nominal valuo,
exceedingly abundant. Postago stamps of tho
rebel manufacture, circulato freely as chango.and
five-cent and ten-cent shinplastcra aro manufac
tured by cutting thoso of larCcr denominations in
pUccst
In and around Richmond thoro aro moro troops.
That city seemi better off in almost every respect,
than any other that my informant passod through.
Every man wears a uniform of somo kind; tho
"crackers" or country whites, who form a largo
part of the aimy, usually havo nothing but a cap,
the rest of their dress being homespun, and a
knapsack and dirty blanket strapped on their
backs. Thcro ii said to be a "ram" at Richmond,
all ready to go down tho river. Tbo Merrimac
and tho Gonnantown aro reported to bo nearly
ready for sea at Norfolk.
In regard to the capturo of Mason and blidoll,
tho general opinion was that England would sure
ly demand their release, and tho newspapers pub
lished long articles.showing the illegality of their
seizure, by all tho principles of National law.
Tho independence of the Southern Confederey is
considered sure.
The womon in Charleston, my informant said,
were more bitter against the North than the men.
Indeed, most of the insults to which the priso
ners wero subjected, camo from women, taunting
them with their poverty and nakednoas, which no
soul in Charleston lifted one finger to alleviate
It mado my cheeks burn and my hands clench to
hear how our bravo men, helpless prisoners, eome
of them sick, and somo not recovered of -their
wounds, aro treated. May the day of their de
livcranco soon come !
Tho privateer Sallie had captured another ves
sol, the Betsey Ames, and brought her into
Charleston, where she will be fitted out as a pir
ate. The Sallie passed in and out of the harbor
about as she pleased, running one time so close to
a Federal vessel as to hear tho cry of her sentries
on board. A fo hours after she came in for the
last time, five Federal vessels made their appear
ance, directly in herftrack. Whilo the Grenada was
lying below Charleston, in the creek, such of the
crew as were left on board, fared well, exchanging
sugar and molasses, for potatoes, fowls and fresh
meat,butaftrreaching the city, they were put into
jail and fared no better than the rc3t. Tho bom'
bardment of Beaufort was distinctly heard by
them; they reported that shortly after, Tatnall'g
fleet came up tbo creek in desperate haste, rfai
i
ing to take them, or any other vessel, in tow, bo
ing "on Government business, and in a great hur
ry" in other wonb, in a great scare I That
Sherman could havo taken Charleston by pushing
on, after the capturo of Port Royal, seems to be
clear from this information. How long ho could
have hold it, is another question.
Yours, Bex.

Smuggling to the Rerels. The contriv
ances for smuggling articles into tho rebel
districts are numberless. A coasting steam
er plying between Baltimore and Patuxent
river was stopped lat week by tho
government officers on board, and passengers,
male and female, told that a scrutiny was to
bo made for contraband goods. The news
excited no little uneasiness among some on
board ; but remonstrances were useless. The
females were searched by somo patriotic
women charged with the duty, and one,
named Milburn, was found to have a well
made quilted petticoat, wadded or filled with
skeins of Bilk, which wcighid not less than
35 pounds, was supposed to be worth $200.
Of courso the garment was cut open and tho
silk abstracted. Sho was placed in custody.
Her brother, a lad, was also searched, and he
wore a verj singularly made jacket. It was
lined and stuffed throughout with neatly
done-up packages, all filled with a choico
rticle of quinine, about 3 pounds in all. It
usually sells for about $3 per ounce. A lot
of contraband goods was found in tho state
rooms, and concealed in various parts of the
boat, and in the bedding were discovered
about 60 letters, some- of which were for
parties living in Virginia, and others for
parties in Maryland. There was also found a
large box containing thousands of needles,
and lota of soldiers' work-bags, filled with
needles, pins, pin-cushions, silk, cotton, and
military buttons.
The Feeling in Congress. Col. Forney
writes to tho Philadelphia Press, as follows :
"A singlo day's observation and intercourse
among the members of Congress has led to the con
elusion that with two or three insignificant excep
tions, the Senators and Representatives agree m utter
detestation of the whole rebellion, and in the ui
compromisitg spirit of putting it down at whatever cot.
Among thoso most urgent and resoluto in taking
theso positions are democrats. Thcro is, indeed,
a good deal of difference as to the means or mannor
of giving effect to this polioy. Some are for a
declaration of emancipation of tho slaves of the
insurgents; others fcr the confiscation of slavo
property; and another class aro for levying a tax
upon tho slaveholders, so that they may by such
process feel tho heaviest burdens of tho war. But
on all sides, as mil on the part of Thaddeus Stevens
in the House as Lyman Trumbull m the Senate,
as well among the ultra- Republicans as among th'.
ultra Democrats, there is an open expression that lie
property of the loyal slaveholders shall be protected or
paid for. A good deal of unnecessary clamor ha3

New Orleans. A letter from New Or
leans, of recent date.tp tho N. Yj JStrald,a
after describing tho joylul stato, of - publiojr
feeling in that city over the fall of Sumter
says : .
'This state of thingc continued till the.
blockado of tho mouth of tbe Mississippi,
about the middle of Juno. Then you coald'
sco long faces; for then wc were eeiz d. byr
tho throat ; but when the trade, from up the

sure past endurance. Notwithstanding the
inhabiranta bore np cheerfully, for relief was
surely at hand, that everybody knew .and no
one dared dispute the fact. In tho month
of October. England and France would in
terfere to raise the blockade. I wish! could
impress on you tho absolute certainty - with
which they regarded this. It was unsafe to
hazard a doubt about it. They would ad
mit no question on the subject. The coup

People began to open their eyes. 'Whose
turn next V was asked. Tho week went byj
October vraa gone, and no French and Eng

in New Orleans ceasel to be "fired." Much
dr..j nrevailed, and the news ot the
capture of Port fiuya. r , .fca
sternation. Exhausted, poverty-stricken,
trembling lest the next blow should tail on
them, it is difficult to describe their absolute
ly wretched condition. I do not believe it U
possible for the people in New Orleans to
hold out three months longer. Tha city is
shrouded m funeral gloom. The river looks
like what it is a great waste of water ; the
levee empty and deserted ; no business after
thret) tho hour for drill. By half past 7
o'clock the streets are silent. Northern men
who wero the loudest for secession, and who
control everything in business, look each
other in the face, ready to exclaim, "What
fools we have been ' Meanwhile the presL
sure grows worse and worse. The following
are the retail prices for certain articles of
necessary consumption . Tea S3 per lb. ;
coffee, $1 burnt nee is now suhstituted m

AN IRON-PIiATED STEAMER FOR
THE GOVERNMENT.
A Philadelphia firm is now at work upon a
new iron-plated steamer for tho Government.
Tho Ledger says :
" The plates aro 15 foet long. 2SJ and 30j
inches wide, and four inches tmuk. A
2 ton hammer is required in their
manufacture. Some doubt has been expressed
as to the ability of any iron works in these
parts to turn out such plates ; bur we under
stand that there is no difficulty about lcAfter
being received at tho foundry, tha plates are
planed, tho edges and ends being made
straight and smooth, and grooved like a
flooring-board. Tho groove is one inch wide
by half an inch deep. Screws are to be used
in fastening the plates to the planking of tho
ship. They are to bo put in from tha inside
of the vessel, and are not to go through the
plates. Tho vessel is to be covered with the
plates 4 feet under water, and 3 feet above
