WHY DON'T YOU BE GEORGE?
TUESDAY'S A RDM OK KITE contained an article
headed "Here Is the Chance For You to Aid
Others," which we trust was read and digested
by many persons who have means to spare ior those
who are less fortunate. In that article the urgent
needs of Ardmore's poor were set forth. It should
not he forgotten, while we are raising funds for Ked
Cross work overseas, that right here at home there
is suffering which pleads for mitigation. Kind words
will help some, but old King Dollar will help more.
The llenevoleiit Association now is engaged in rais
ing a winter fund for the benefit of the sick and needy.
John F. Kasky is city chairman, ami bis telephone
"number is 251. He can give you all the additional
information you may require. If you have not read
the article in Tuesday's paper you should read it
now and act accordingly.
Ardmore has an angel of mercy, a mother to the
little poor and a big sister to the woman who is sick
.mil needy, .'-'lie is Mrs. Julius Kahn. Many of you
know her and know something of her work for the
home-town unfot tunates ; but none of you can know
all of what she h.n done and is doing and wants to
do if she can have the funds with which to do it. The
r.inevolent Association co-operates with Mrs. Kahn
in her labors of mercy. It is for you to co-operate
with th' J'.enevob.iu Awuiat urn and help Mrs. Kahn
and other good women help llio-e ubo need help.
This appeal k made nol only to ciliens of Ard
nioie, but also l.i the many well-to-do people of Cur
ler county, to whom this city U I be local melropolis.

AN EDITOR 13 A WORKINGMAN TOO.
THE AKDM OREITF. has received the follow
ing interesting letter;
Ardmore, Due. 8.
Editor Daily Ardmorcitc:
Your editorial in your Sunday paper on "Lit
tle Willie's Renunciation" smells more than the
dirty streets of Ardmore that you are inviting him
to clean. Arc you trying to bring a dirty brute
like William to the level of an honest working
man? The street cleaning department is just as
honorable as printing a newspaper, and I think it
is more beneficial and serviceable. Why not Invite
him to sling mud in your office? I think the brute
would make good at that,
Now, please don't mention manual labor and
William any more than you can help, as we be
lieve that manual labor stands as high and will
stand as good inspection as any profession you
might follow. This is from some workingmen of
Ardmore. Print this if you want to.
Yours truly,
CHARLES JOHNSON'.
P. S. This is not the first time that we have
noticed your disrespect for a workinginati, but
when you bring him down to the level with Wil
, liam it's time to take notice.
The Ardmorcite is pained because Mr. Johnson
takes offense at the playful' editorial wherein we in
vited the ex-crown prince, who had said he would be
willing to do manual labor, to come to Ardmore and
pick up the paper littering certain streets. As we.
pointed out, "scraps of paper" are strictly in the
Ilobenzollern family line. Of course we had no ser
ious intention of putting "Little Willie" in competi
tion with honest American workingmen, nor of insin
uating that he is in their class in any sense whatever.
And, as for this paper showing disrespect for woik
ingmen, we are willing to wager the price of a Ked
Cross membership that the man who wrote the Little
Willie" editorial has done as many kinds of manual
labor as Mr. Charles Johnson ever has done, no mat
ter what his lines of work may be or may have been
heretofore. The man who wrote that editorial has
done everything that is to be done on a farm; he ha;
driven a team of Missouri mules attached to a road -
scraper; he has shoveled gravel from a we I creek bed
and dumped it upon the highways and smoothed it
off; he has dug ditches, done carpentering, washed
di.hes, set type and various other things which mav
be termed manual labor, and he has been a member
of a trade's union in good standing.
The Ardmorcite has high respect for workingmen
of all kinds who do their work well. Mr. Johnson
should take a day or so off and learn how to appre
ciate a joke.
We learn that Australian commercial and financial
interests are making plans to connect Australia with
London and other parts of the l!iiii-li empire by com
mercial airplanes. Wonder bow oldlitue England
would feel to know that the descendants of the con
victs she deported' to the farr-off island continent were
flying back to the motherland?
o
This is the day you should turn in that dollar lor
Christmas Red Cross membership. The membership
,vill last a whole year much longer than the dollar.

The breweries are to be turned into vast plants
for drying fruit and vegetable;; but the late of the
prctel factories still hangs in the balance.

President Wilson in the eyes of the
people whom he lias served so well
apparently reached its climax on
the eve of his departure for the
Peace Conference, and then col
lapsed like a deflated balloon.
With a unanimity of purpose lhat

tinually ever since the first definite
signs of German defeat came in the
opening of overtures for an arm

lomatic step he took to dissolve
the kaiser's government and bring
about abject Herman surrender.
Victory assured, they unmasked at
tack ujioii the conditions which the
president had formulated and the
world had enthusiastically accepted
for the making of a peace. Embedd
ed by the people's passive tolerance
of tl'tis abuse of I heir leader, they
proceeded to work themselves up
into a fine frenzy over the presi

came j'rnm Tulsa, brother. On the
third day I grew desperate about
bedtime and took a swig from the
faucet.
X C,
Ami I failed to drop dead. So far
as I know 1 am alive yet. And full

' -XG-
Thcn 1 asked somebody about it
how it happened that I still was
living and breathing and show ing no
symptoms of ptomaine poisoning or
cnizootic, or saline strangulation, or
anything'.
; And somebody asked me which
one I had escaped from.
x r,
"Which which?" f asked, which i
Missouriese for "which what." if
you'd like to have it translated.

"Which insane asylum?" asked
somebodv.
X C,
"I never saw any asylum that was
insane." I replied.
x r,
"Well, then," asked somebody,
"which avlum for the insane?"
X .
"Oh!" T aspirated; and then I be
gan sMy to suspect that somebody
thought rne crazy. It dawned grad
ually upon me that somebody
couidn'l understand why I had ex
pected to drop dead, or at least to
develop symptoms of approaching
dissolution or of progressive coma,
immediately after drinking water
from the citv supplv.
' X (i
little story in explanation. Last
winter a well-dressed young man
came into my office in Tulsa with
a wild, unearthly look in his eyes.
In his hand he held an empty tum
bler. "What what's the ma matter
with this wa water?" he gurgled.
"What water?"
"The water I've just drank from
the faucet," he managed to say.
1 jumped up and phoned for the
best doctor 1 knew. "Come at once
poison case emergency!" I
shouted.
-N'G-The
voting man had fainted. From
fright.' It was indeed inconsiderate
of "me to alarm him so, but did I
not do it for his sake?
X C.
I was excited. Never before had
I or anvbody else ever heard of
anvbodv'who drank Tulsa city
water! ' "It ain't done!" The thing
is unthinkable. It is utterly beyond
the bounds of the ultimately impos
sible. N G
No. thev don't have water in Tul
sa citv water, I mean for drink
ing purposes. It is not even cook
ing water. It is used, at certain
seasons, for bathtub application, but
is rubbed oft" instantly as a matter
of precaution.
NO
When I discovered that Ardmore
city water no matter what the ed
itor mav think- of it actually is used
for DRINKING and docs not kill,
and after I had gone three days on
the road to absolute bone-dryness.
I recalled an incident in the life of
an actor-friend of mine (in the days
when there WERE actors and not
movie freaks), lie was stranded in
Seattle and had to get down to San
Francisco to connect with a profes
sional job. He had just enough
monev to pav his passage on a .ship.
'X ti
lt was the first time he ever had
been aboard a ship, and he was un
familiar with the customs. For three
days he lay in his berth. Xo, he
wasn't seasick he was hungry, and
he didn't propose to waste his phys
ical energy and make himself still
hungrier; he would rest up, and
maybe he could manage to survive
until he struck Frisco and a friend
to stake him to a square meal.
x r,
Toward the cud of the third day
the kindly steward came to his
stateroom. "Still seasick?" he asked.
"Not on your life!" peevishly and
feebly replied my actor-friend.
"Well, then." said the steward, "why
don't you come to dinner? You
haven't eaten a meal since you came
aboard, and I was getting worried
about vou."
X G
My friend was so hungry that he
determined to go into the dining
saloon and eat everything in sight
and take the consequences prob
ably get thrown overboard or put
in irons because he couldn't pay for
the meal.
X G
He went and ate. Tt was a dandy
fine dinner, too. - When everything
was devoured to the ultimate
crumb and the final bone was
picked, my friend sneaked back to
li is stateroom, fearful lest he should
be nabbed and pavment demanded.
X G
An hour later the ship steamed,
into the Golden Gate and the guilty
wretch sneaked ashore, lie told the
first friend he met all about his sad
experience.
X G
"Why. you chump," said his
friend, "didn't you know that when
you paid your passage on that ship
you paid at the same time for all
your meals on the voyage and that
boat sure does set the table right-o,
bov!"
X G
He thought the ship was run on
the European plan !
N G
And I felt somewhat like my actor
friend, after thirsting for three days
in Ardmore because I naturally sup
posed coming from Tulsa that the-
city water was not intended lor
drinking purposes.
X G
And so, no matter what the editor
may say against Ardmore's water,
I'm for it.
X G
Have a drink with me!
