WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 8, 1876.
The President's Message.
We publlth this morning the President's
meswge, which was communicated to Con-;
grew yesterday. It is the centennial mes
sage, and opens with a brief account of the
wonderful advancement of the nation in the
hundred years since its political independ
ence?in population, wealth, power, com
merce, and arts of all sorts. Beginning with
the fall of Atux, or w original slo," the
President declares that since that time " no
nation baa ever been free from threatened
danger to its prosperity and happiness,"
and, sagely recognizing the feet, declares
that we shonld watch vigilantly to
avoid the evils of the continued
consequences of Adam's great sin as far as
He? in our power. However, in this part of
the great centennial paper he omits to do
whrt might have been appropriate? show
the wonderful advances of the nation in cor j
ruptlon and vice as. well as in power and art.
He might have given a philosophic touch at
the manner in which we are bringing upon
us the dangers to .our '? prosperity and
peace" after the manner of ohr : original 1
progenitor, who was also the original sinner.
The President jumps from this branch of
the subject te the matter of education, open
ing with the remark that in a republic like
ours, where u one man is as good as another ^
*' before the law," all should be educated.
Igorant men, he says, cannot oppose tyran
ny, 44 whether directed by demagogues or
priestcraft ; and general education is the
best protection to our institutions."
He proposes that the Constitution shell
be amended so as to pledge every State to u
system of public education adequate to tbc
education of all children iu the rudimentary
branches irrespective ot sex, color, birth
place, or religion. He further proposes th.it
tin.* teaching of religiou?, atheistic, or pagan
tenets shall be prohibited, and that no part
of the school-fund shall be appropriated to
the aid of any religious sects or denomina.
tion?.
The President, in this connection, calls at
teniion to the accumulation of vast amounts
of untaxed church property, aggregating at
tbif? time, he conjectures, 1,000,000,000 of
dollurs in value. Suggesting that tax-payers
will complain that so much property is un
tixed while their burthens are so heavy, he
recommend* that taxes be imposed upon all
property, whether church or corporation,
cxcp'.iug only grave-yards and church
buildings
[What a row would have been raised forty
years ago had a President of the United
States made these recommendations touch,
ing education and church property 1 These
mutters were then thought to be peculiar
concerns of the States. That was the idea
of the Fathers of the Republic ; and General
Grant could not have offered us a mare
striking proof of the great advances made
in central usurpation in the course of a hun-^
drcd years after our forefathers had secured
our national independence. The political
change that is thus illustrated ought to haVe
taken a longer time; but we are a fast na
tion /]
The President congratulates the country
that we are at peace with the world. That
being the state of our foreign relations,
whiie at home "one man is as good as an
other, ,r we ought to be both happy and jolly.
Spain has paid eighty thousand dollars in
demnity to the passengers, crew, aq#l all
Americans of the steamer Virginius. . The
r greement stipulated that the sum should be
ptid in four instalments, but the President
gives credit to Spain for her promptness in
p tying it all at once.
With regard to the Cuban insurgents the
ne*sage shows how long and fruitless the
content on both sides has been, and tells
v. bat the insurgents must dp to entitle them
se'ves to recognition? viz., establish a gov
ti nment. This seems to be in the nature of
a biBt to the insurgents ; for later in themes.
s:?se the idea is conveyed that under this
hint tbey may conform to the indispensable
conditions of their recognition, in which
eveot the President may have occasion to
m ike a further communication to Congress.
The part of the docunieut ob this subject is
the work of a lawyer? probably Mr. Fish.
The President says, however, that if Spain
does not put down the insurrection, or so
arrarge matters as to put a stop to the dam
age done the interests of our citizens, Gen
eral Gkant will during the present session
recommend measures of some sort. And
this seems to be in the nature of a hint to
Spain. So that If she would avoid trouble
she must hurry up her war measures against
the insurgents.
Congress is informed that there is a
stoumer on the Rio Grande to stop the smug
gling from the Mexican ?' free zone."
Several paragraphs of minor interest show
close attention to business.
The French cable was permitted to land
in the United States with the understand
ing that the privileges granted the company
should be reciprocated by Franco with re
gard to any cable from the United States.
But the message states that the French cable
has fallen into the hands of the company
controlling the British cable, and thus we
have lost the benefit of the competition which
had been established by the French lice.
The consolidation made the monopoly more
powerful and increased the difficulties of
building competing lines. A direct cable
from the United States to Great Britain has
since been built, and the result was a reduc
tion of charges upon messages. But that
cable was broken, and for a time suspended.
When repaired, however, it adhered to the
charges upon the British cable, which had
been increased during the suspension of the
direct line.
The President hopes that otter lines will
be established for the public good, and sug
gests some very practical regulations for all
cables that may connect this country with
foreign States. '
The message contains some recommenda*
tions for amendments of the naturalization
laws for the purpose of preventing fraudu
lent expedients for avoiding service to
foreign governments by persons who also
intend to escape the duties of citizenship to
this country.
The President makes some seasonable
recommendations with regard to the protec
tion of American women who may marry
foreigners, and for defining more fully the
status of children bum of American parents
in foreign lands.
The President urges Congress tor complete
the legislation for a resumption of spccle
paymenfca on the 1st day of January, 1879,
remarking that it would be a great blessing'
if resumption could be consummated at an
earlier day. The President strangely admits
that "unlimited inflation " f? would proba
I *' My bring about specie- payments more
I "speedily than any legislation looking to
" the redemption of^gaj?tenders in coip.^
" But," says the P^sident, ? it would be at
the expense of honor." And how ? He gays'
ssa ? | ? v7~
" ?ne legal-Ucdci*; wouid baye ?o value to
< yon d settling preiCDt It ifeiUtles, or, pro
?? pcYly spt a1< I ngf rcpudifiUn g them." Wby
should, they be any tnoro valuable than irall
the currency, for which the credit and entire
wealth of tbe land are pledged ? We should
thick the most direct road to the redemption
of the national honor would be to resume
spccic-paymenta. But the president U for
(hat honor which does most tor the money,
deafer* nt this time. He is not for that
policy which will help the people out
awl hasten resumption, as be con
fers, No, we must whittle away the
national vigor for enriching the goid-gamb
lers and money-sharks. We never advocated
" unlimited loAtHon," and do not intend to;
do ax But repeal the laws compelling re.
sumption, and M probably " resumption will
be hastened, ^
The President proposes that legai-tenders
bfcaM not bo receivable for debts contracted
after January 1, 1877. . Hethtnks this would
cause a healthy rcSclion and increase the de
site to make "currency' what it purports to
be;" > * *
In connection with this measure It Is pro
post d that the Secretary of the Treasury
shall be authorised to redeem not exceeding
?2 ,000,000 per month in legal-tender?, issu
ing in their, stead a longfbond bearing 3.65
per cent, per annum, of denominations from
$50 >ofl,060. The President also proposes
that the Secretiairy 7 fjttf accumulate gold by
i screwing rayenne and curtailing expenses ;
and bo recommends both, suggesting as oner
means of increasing revenue tbe restoration
of tbe duties on tea and coffee, which would
probably > bring in $18,000,000.
Tbe President suggests several expedients
as calculated to advance bis views about in
creasing revenue and diminishing expendi
ture.
On tbe subject of tbe army the message is
very brief. It commends especially the re
commendation of General Sherman for a sys
tem of annuities to the families of deceased
officers.
With regard to the navy the message
represents its condition to be satisfac- 1
tory. The iron-elad fleet for defence at home |
will be equal to any force that can reidily be j
brought against it. Some forty cruisers are
ia tLe Atlantic, and could be ready for duty
as fast as men could t>e eRltsted tor them.
Ooe third are new, and all can be readily
made effective- making a flset of more than
fii'ty war-sbipa, -of which fifteen are iron
clads, now on tbe Atlantic coast. The Presi
dent advises tbe immediate completion of
tbe five double-turretted monitors now under
repair, as they are important for harbor de
fence.
The Tost-Office Department is briefly
treated in the same business manner that
prevails throughout the message ia its state
ments and suggestions concerning tbe de
partments. The President regards tbe post
office correctly. No branch of the service,
lie says, interests tbe people more. He urges
the facilitation of communication through
the mails and cheap transportation as of the
highest importance. He seems to be entirely
in accord with Postmaster-General Jewell.
Tbo Indian rights in the Black Hills have
been protected thus far j and Congress is
asked to take measures to relieve tbe Govern
ment of embarrassment with regard to the
Black Hills and Indian affairs generally.
The exhibit of the Patent Ofifce i3 gratify
ing to tbe country. i ?
On the subjects of pensions, the explora
tions in Colorado and Utah, and the Indian
policy, tbe parapraphs in the message are
brief and interesting.
The Centennial exhibition is commended
to farther appropriation by Congress.
The Departments of Agriculture and of
Lducition are noticed. Polygamy and the
Chinese scandal arc censured with virtuous
indignation. ?
The regulations of the sale of public lands
require amendment.
This ends the ordinary discussions of the
annual message. But President Grant, in
consideration of this message being his last
"belorc my (bis) successor is chosen," re
peats what he calls the questions which he '|
deems of vital importance? viz., education
no sectarian tenets should be taught at com
mon jcbooli? make education compulsory?
Church and State forever separate? church
property to be taxed? put an end to polyga
my and importing women for illegitimate
purposes.
Tbe centennial year tbe President thinks
fitting for such reforms, and finally he re
news his urgent request for laws to return
to a sound currency.
Thus ends the message? a document of
great length and business character. Its
conclusion seems to put an extinguisher
upon the " third-term" absurdity.
Biennial Sessions.
. ,\
The Whig of yesterday says :
"As for -biennial sessions qf the Legisla
ture, they are humbugs. When limited to
one session in two years, that one session
would run on, by hocus pocus , until it would
occupy a9 much time and cost as much money
as annual session?. Besides, in looking out for
work to do, a great deal of harmful work
would be done. The Legislature is the
representative of the people, and the people
should, through their representatives, be in
session every year."
Our views toa"t." It must be a poor,
unprosperous, unenterprising State that
does not need some sort of legislation
every year.
The Inscription for Jackson's Statue.?
Extract from a private letter just received
by Governor Kemper from Hon. A. J. B.
Beresford-Hope in regard to the Jackson
statue and pedestal :
"Let me now particularly congratulate
you on tbe inscription. It is admirable in
taste and composition; just showing the
right thing, and neither too much nor too
little. The 'patriot* was very cleverly
brought in, and also the 'Stonewall.' I
trust you have noticed the stone wall in the
statue."
We are obliged to Dr. Chablbs S. Mills,
collector of this port, for a copy of the report
of the Secretary of the Treasury, interesting
extracts from Which we publish in another
column. Tbe report was sent to Dr. Mills
for the Richmond pres?, and was given out
to tbem upon the receipt of a telegram:
stating that it bad been communicated to
Congress. _
The West got ail the leading positions In
Saturday's caucus. This requires an east*
em nominee for tbe presidency, don't it Mr.
Tilden ?? Washington Star. .5
Jast the contrary. It means that the
South and. the West have formed an un
limited partnership, and that whilst that
partnership exists' the section (New Eng
land) which has so long monopolized all the
offices need expect no favors.
The JOhjpatok has it lex non soriptoe, and

The Speakers Wp?Tbe {*?mbi era.
Tbf> money-gamblers attach tfctmselvw to
every issue. They are not unlilre-apirtyiu j
this State that take a hold oa whatever may '
help It on. Like the leeches of a muddy,
clay-colored, sluggish stream, they adze
upon the legs of every gay and spirited
horse that crosses -it and claim all tbe'eredit
for his speed and bottom; The organ* of
the "bards "claim Kerb, that be is aow
elected, as their man and ?aa, baying been
elected by their influence. Therefore the
election of Kerr la set down as a. '" ^all
street" triumph.
For ourselves, we are pleased with Kerb,
though we would have voted for Randall if
We had had a vote. We did not . prefer
either on "lEe ri ns octaTqu estlon, Randall
was, we suppose, a little moreen the "bardr
money " tack than was Kerb. But as to
tjiat matter, we never thought of the " hard
money" aspects of their view?. Randall
had rendered brilliant service to the Union
aod to the South by his g&lhnt and loyal
devotion to the Constitution and the equality ,
of the States al the last session? when Kebr
was not in Congress at all. It was not that
We admired Kebr leas, but Randall's ser
?vjce9 were so recent, so brave, and so bril
liant, that we felt that our first grateful emo
tions were'dpe to hjm, while his fine record
and bis skill in parliamentary .tactics were
quite equal to those of Mr. Kerb.
! But Wall-Street gamblers obtrude them
selves aDd claim an advantage in the election
of Kerb, The selfish and sordid are al ways,
vulgar. Tbe contest between Kerr and
Randall was a generous one. Itwasr carried
on in the Democratic pjrty, and it ended as
generous rivalries amongst brothers should
always* end?in psace and concord. Wall
street likes not tbese conclusions, and
essays to arouse animosity by chuckling over
an imaginary victory, accusing tbe de
fealed of extraordinary schemes lor victory,
aod asserts that tbe country is saved by their
defeat.
Randall and bis friends will not be de
ceived by ibis firebrand adroitly thrown into
tbe Democratic ranks. They are sure that
the means employed by themselves were not
uufair? they know that if any party bad the
benefit of "powerful means" it was not
their party, opposed as it avowedly was by
the *' money rower." Tbe Democrats know
that the intimuiion that tbe public interests
are better protected, and corruption more
completely cbeckcd, by tbe election of Kerr
than they would have been by the eieclioa of
Randall is untrue, and doe3 not proceed
from the frieud9 of Kerr. They deny any
superior fealty to the Constitution and tbe
Union amongst Kerr and his followers over
that which governs their own sentiments
and conduct. * It i9 the Integrity of the party,
and not Kerb, that will protect the Consti
tution and the people from tbe corruptions
tbat have invaded all departments of the
Government under Radical rule.
We are disgusted with the gambling
pirlisanry; it is both vulgar and greedy.
We suspect tbat the attempt to force
it into the issues of the day is designed
to break up and defeat the Demo
cratic party. And for what? The De
mocratic party is as wise and as loyal upon
the financial question as tbe Republican
party can be. Indeed, the Democratic loy
alty to tbe national credit is above suspicion;
while as much cannot be said of tbe party
which appears to be falling under the influ
ence of the hypocritical gambling frater
nity that ia trying to impair tbe credit of
the national currency and force the country
prematurely into resumption, and thus bring
unprecedented pecuniary disasters upon U9.
Tbey are traitors to the nation inasmuch as
they endeavor to ruin the credit of the na
tional circulation, which of right should be
as good as tbat of the national bonds. Tbey
clearly propose to Involve the nation and
tbe people in embarrassments out of which
tbe money-holder may amass wealth.
'The Democratic party and the great body
of tbe people do not seek to " inflate " the
currency. The epithets of " rag-money "
and such are only blackguardism. The
people want nothing unreasonal '3. They
would avoid shrinkage by such a measure as
would equalize gold and greenbacks by
their gradual approach to one another.
They would that resumption may come
without a ruinous shrinkage of values and
without a shock. They would leave
resumption to come reasonably, of its own
accord, satisfied that it will come early and
last long in tbat way ; perhaps sooner and
with more certainty of endurance in that
way than by fixing resumption by law.
Tbe trick of the gamblers to produce dis
contentment among the Democrats is a con
temptible one, and will fail altogether. Their
real objects were developed in Pennsylvania,
Ohio, and New York. The country should
understand their game too well to be again
deceived. . There is a good deal of this stra
tegy about. It is tbe only hope of effete pol
iticians, as it is of the gamblers. Confuse
the practical, progressive, energetic, and
young public men, and their organizations
'for benefiting the country, putting a check
upon corruption, and throwing overboard
the old hacks and corrupt schemers who have
lived upon tbe public for several decades, an d
the Government will be continued in the
hands of unscrupulous and greedy men, who
have begun to think that they haye a pre
scriptive right to the offices and honors of
the country, and who have not one practical
idea concerning the best measures to promote
the harmony and prosperity of the land. Let
the energetic and practical men? those who
have good sense and hope? those who would
rise, but see no way to rise but through the
rise of tbe country itself? stand firmly to
gether, utterly defiant of tbe tricks and con
trivances to separate them. Let the true
and sensible stand up for tbe country, and
they will triumph by defeating the men and
their followers who are conspiring to obtain
their own greedy objects and to live upon
the country by promoting discord and dis
aster.

In submitting ray seventh annual message
to Congress in this centennial year of our
national existence as a free and Independent
people it affords me great pleasure to recur
to the advancement that has been made from
the time of tb'i Colonies ? one hundre&years
ago. We Wf.re then a people numbering
only three mUlions. Now we number more
than fortv millions. Then industries were
confined 'almost exclusively to the tillage of
the soil. Now manufactories 'absorb muob
of the labor of the country. Our liberties
remain unimpaired. The bondsmen have
been freed from slavery. We have become
possessed of the re?pcct,if not the friendship, i
of all civll'zJd nations.
OUR PROGRESS A3 A NATION.
Our progress has been great in all the arts.
In science, agriculture, commerce, naviga
tion, mining, mechanics, law, medicine, etc.,
and in general education, the progress is
likewise encouraging. Our thirteen States
bave become thirty-eight, including Colo
rado, which h?s taken the initiatory steps to
become a State, and eight Territories, in
cluding the Indian Territory and excluding
Colorado, making a territory extending from
the Atlantic to the Pacific. On the south
we bave extended to the Gulf of Mexico,
and in the west from the Mississippi to the
Pacific. One hundred years ago the cotton
gin, the steamship, the railroad, the tele
graph, the reaping-, sewing-, and modem
printing-machines, and numerous other in
ventions of scarcely less value to our business
and happiness, were entirely unknown. In
17T6 manufactories scarcely existed even in
name in all this vast territory. In
1870 more than two millions of persons
were employed in manufactories, producing
more than ?2,100,000,000 of products in
amount annually? nearly equal to our na
tional debt. Fnom nearly the whole of the
population of 1776 being engaged in the oc
cupation of agriculture, in 1870 sj nume
rous and diversified bad become the occupa
tion of our people that less than six millions
out of more than forty millions were so en
gaged. The extraordinary effect produced
in our country by a resort to diversified oc
cupation has built a market for the products
of fertile lands distant from the seaboard and
the markets of the worid.
The American system of locating various
and extensive manufactories next to the
plough and the pasture, flDd adding connect
ing railroads and steamboat?, has produced
in our distant interior country a result
noticeable by the intelligent, portions of all
commercial nations. The ingenuity and skill
of American mechanics have been demon
strated at home and abroad in a manner most
fluttering to their pride. But for tbe(Xtra
dinary genius and ability of cur mechanics
the achievements of our agriculturists, manu
facturers, and transporters throughout the
country would have been laiposiible of at
tainment.
The progress of the miner h ?s also been
great. Of coal our production was small;
now many millions of tons are mined annu
ally. So with iron, which formed scarcely
an appreciable part of our products half a
century ago. We now produce more than the
world consumed at the beginning of our na
tional existence. Lead, zinc, and' copper,
from being articles of import, we may expect
to be large exporters of in the near future.
The development or gold- and silver-mines
in the United States and territories has not
only been remarkable, but has harl a large,
intluence upon the buslucss of all commcrcial
nations.
Our merchants in tbc last hundred
years have had a success and have
established a renutaticn for enterprise, sa
gacity, progress, and integrity unsurpassed
by people of older nationalities. This "good
name" is not confined to their homes, but
goes out upon every sea and into every port
where commerce enter*. With equal pride
we C3n point to our- progress in "all of the
learned professions.
As we are now about to enter upon our
second centennial, comcoencijii pur man
hood as a nation, it is well To look back
upon the past and study what will be best
to preserve and advance our future great
ness. From the fall of Adam for his trans:
gression to the present day no nation has
ever been free from threatened danger to its
prosperity and happiness. We should look
to the dangers threatening us, and remedy
them so far as lies in our power. We are a
republic, whereof one man is a3 good as
another before the law. Under such a form
of government it is of the greatest import
ance that all should be possessed of educa
tion and intelligence enough to cast a vote
with a right understanding of its meaning.
A large association of ignorant men cannot
for any considerable period oppose
successful resistance to tyranny and
oppression from the educated few, but
will inevitably sink into acquiescence
to the will of intelligence., whether- di
rected by the demagogue or by priestcraft ;
hence the education of the masses becomes
of the first necessity for the preservation of
our institution?. They are worth preserving,
because they bave secured the greatest good
to the greatest portion of th&population of
any form of government yet devised. All
other forms of government approach it just
in proportion to the general 'diffusion of edu
cation and independence of thought and ac
tion^ As the primary step, therefore, to
our advancement in all that has marked our
progress in the past century I suggest for your
earnest consideration, and most earnestly
recommend it, that a constitutional amend*
ment be submitted to the Legislatures of
tie several States for ratification making it
the duty j>( each of the several States to
establish' and forever maintain free public
schooUr'adcquate to tbe education of all the
children in tbe rudimentary branches within
their respective Iimitsffrrespective of sex,
$ertor, bfrtb-place, or religion ; forbidding
tbe teaching in said schools of religious
atheistic or pagan tenets, and prohibiting
tbe gra nting-oHmy sebooHunds-or-scbooh
taxes or any part thereof either by legisla
tive, municipal, or other authority for the
benefit or In aid directly or indirectly of auyi
religious sect or denomination, or in aid or
for the benefit of any other object of any
nature or kind whatever.
(iffl:FAVOT OF TAXIXO CHURCH PBOPBIT.' ^
j In connection with this Important ques
tion 1 would also call your attention to tbe
importance of correcting an evil that If per
mitted to continue will probably lead: to
great trouble in our land before tbe close of
the .nineteenth century. It is the accumula
tion of vast amounts or untaxed church pro
perty, In 1860,1 believe, the church pro
perty if the United States which paid no
tax, municipal or State, amounted to about
183,000.000. , _rIo HHfi
doubled. In
ri9Qo.;) 'By..;ieoof .wi.tj19.ut,. ?
safe to say this property wlfl reach
a sum exceeding $3,00(^000, 000. So vast
e . tum receiviog a!f. .
its proportion of the"bordeiM
of the same, will not be looked upon aequl
escently by those who have to pay the taxes.
In a growing country, where real estate en*
hances so rapidly with time, as in tbe United
States, there W scarcely a limit to the" wealth
that may be acquired by corporations, reli
gious or otherwise, if allowed to retain real
estate witbont taxation. Tbe contemplation
of so vast a property as here alluded to with
out taxation may lead to sequestration with*
out constitutional authority and through
blood. . * ,?
I would suggest the taxation of ail pre
perty equally, whether church or corpora
tion, exempting only the last resting-place of
the dead, and, possibly, with proper restric
tions, church edifices.
? | l'l* ; OtTB P0EBIGN RELATIONS.
Our relations witl) most of the foreign
Powers continue on a satisfactory and friendly
footing.
Increased intercourse* tbe extension of
commerce, and the cultivation of mutual in
terests bive steadily improved oor relations
with the large majority of the Powers of the
-World, rendering practicable the peaceful di
lution of questions which from tbne to time
necessarily arise, leaving few wblcb demand
extended or particular; notice. \ "?^ , ,,
The correspondence' of the Department of
State, with our diplomatic representatives
abroad is transmitted herewith.
j I am happy to announce the passage of
an act by the General Cortes of Portugal,
proclaimed; since tbe adjournment of Con
gress, for the abolition of servitude in the
Portuguese colonies. It is. to } be hoped !
that such legislation may be another step
toward . the great consummation to be
reached, when no man . shall be permitted,
directly or indirectly, under any guise,
excuse, or form of Uw, to hold his fellow
man in bondage. I am of opinion also that
it is tbe duty of the United States, as con
tributing toward that end, and required by the
spirit of the age in which we live, to provide '
by suitable legislation that no citizen of the
United States shall hold slaves as property in
any other country, or be interested therein.

SPAIN AND CCBA.
In March last an arrangement was
made through Mr. Cusbing, our Min
ister in Madrid, with the Spanish Gov
ernment for the payment by tbe latter
to the United States of the sum of eighty
?thousand dollars in coin for the purpose of
the relief of tbe families of the persons of
the ship's company and certain passengers of
tbo " Virginiue." This sum was to have
been paid in three instalments of two months
<a^h. It is due to the Spanish Government
ttat I should state that tbe payments were
folly and spontaneously. anticipated by that
Government, and tbat tbe whole amount
was paid witbin a few days more than two
months from the date of agreement, a copy
of which is herewith transmitted. In pur
fuiccc of the terms of tbe adjustment 1 have
directed the distribution of the amount
umopg tbe parties entitled thereto, including
tbe>bip's company and such of tbe passen
gers as were American citizens. Paymen s
are nude accordingly on tbe application of
tbe parties entitled~tbereto. . ,r; , . j
Tbe post year has furnished no evidence
of an approacbicg termination of the ruin
ous conflict which has been waging f jr seven
years in tbe neighboring island of Cuba.
The same disregard of the laws of civil'zed
warfare and of tbe just demands of humanity
which have heretofore called forth expres
sion* of condemnation from tbe nations of
Christendom have continued to bheken the
sad scene. Desolation, ruin, and pillage are
pervading the rich fields of one of the most
fertile and productive regions of tbe earth;
and tbe incendiary's torch, firing plantations
and valuable factories and buildings, is the
agent marking the alternate advance or re
treat of contecding parties.
The protracted continuance of this strife
seriously affects the interests of all commer
cial nation?, but those of the Uaited States
more than others, by reason of close prox
imity, its larger trade and intercourse with
Cuba, and the frequent and intimate per
sonal and social relations which have grown
up between its citizens and those of the
island. Moreover, the property of our citi
zens in Cuba is large, and is rendered inse
cure &,na depreciates in value and in capacity
of production by tbe continuance of the strife
and the unnaiural mode of the conduct. The
same strife differing only in degree with re
spect to the interests and people of other na
tions, and the absence of any reasonable
assurance of a near termination of the con
flict, must of necessity soon compel the States
tbus suffering to consider what tbe interests
of their own people and their duty to
ward themselves may demand.
I have hoped tbat Spain would be enabled
to establish peace in ber colony, to afford se
curity to the property and the interests of
our citizens, and allow legitimate scope to
trade and commerce an# the natural produc
tions of tbe island. Because of this hope,
and from an extreme reluctance to interfere
in tbe most remote manner in the affairs of
another and a friendly nation, especially of
one whose sympathy and friendship in the
struggling infancy of our own existence
must ever be remembered with gratitude, I
have patiently and anxiously waited the
progress of events.
Our own civil conflict is too recent for
us not to consider tbe difficulties wblcb
surround a Government distracted by a
dynasty rebellion at home at tbe same time
that it has to cope with a separate insurrec
tion in a distant colony ; but whatever causes
may have produced the situation which so
grievously affects our Interest, it exists with'
all its attendant evils, operating directly
upon this country and its people. Thus far
all tbe efforts of Spain have proved abortive,
and time has marked no improvement in the
situation. The armed bands of either aide now
occupy nearly tbe same ground as In the
past, with the difference, from time to time, of
more lives sacrificed; more property de
stroyed, and wider extents of fertile and pro
ductive fields and more and'' more of valua
ble property constantly and Wantonly sacri
ficed to the incendiary's torch. When con
tests of this nature, where a considerable
body of people have attempted to free them
selves of the control of tbe superior govern
ment, have reached such a point in occupa
tion of territory, in power, and in general
organization as to constitute in fact a body
. politic, having a government in substance as
.well as in name, possessed of tbe elements
of stability and equipped with tbe machinery
of administration of internal poiiey and for
- the execution of its laws, prepared and able
to administer justice at home as weli as in its
dealings with other powers, it is within the
province of those other powers to recognize
its existence as a sew and independent na-<
tion. In sueh cases other nations simply
deal with an actually existing condition of
things, and recognize as one of tbe powers
of*>, tbe earth' tbat body politic which,
possessing < tbe necessary elements, has in
Act become a new power? in a word, tbe
creatiou of anew State is a fact. To estab
lish tbe eondition of things essential to the
recognition of this fact there must be a peo
ple occupying a known territory, united
under, some inown and defined form of
government acknowledged by those subject
thereto, to which, tbe. functions of govern
ment are determined by the usual methods,
competent to. mete out justice to citizens
and strangers, to afford 'remedies for
front its acquisition of tbe rights of sover
f#FZl i 'power should exist complete In
itsoiganlzation, ready lo take and able to
2tl? JS.^6 among the sations of the
eartb, -While conscious that the insurrec
tion in Cuba baa shown a strength and en
durance which make It at least doubtful
whether it Is io the power of Spain to subdue
jt, It seems unquestionable that no such civil
organization exists which may be recognized
as ao Independent government capable of
performing its International obligations and
entitled to be treated as one of the powers
of the earth. A recognition under ?ucb dr?
dumstances would be, inconsistent with the
facts, and would compel the power
igranting it soon to support by force the
?Government to' wbfch' 16 ' had really given
its only claim of existence.; In: my Judg
ment the United States should adhere
td the policy and principles which have
heretofore been itB sure and, safe guides |
in litre contests beween revolted colonies and
their mother eouutrv, and acting only upon 1
the clearest evidence, should avoid sny ?bs-'j

,, i # BKtU6K&ENT B1GHTH* '
i ! The recognition "of^tbe Independente of
Cuba being, in myopirilon/lmpracticableand
indefensible, the 'question w'hfeh next pre
sent# itseif is that of the recognition of bel
ligerent rights lo the parties to the contest.
In a former message to- Congress I bad
occasion to consfdeF tblS question, and
reached the conclusion that the conflict
in Cuba, dreadful and devastating as
were - its Incidents;- did ! not rise
to* the fearful dignity of war.
Kegnrdfng It now, after this lapse of time, I
am unable to see that any notable sueces9, or
any marked or real advance On the part of
the insurgents, has eventually changecF the
character of the contest. It has acquired
greater age but not greate* or more formida
ble proportions. It is^ossible th'at the acts
of foreign powers, and even acts of Spain
herself, of this very nature, might be pointed
to in defence of such recognition; but now,
as - in its past history, the United States
should carefully avoid the false lights
which tnigbfc lead it Into the mazes of
doubtful law and of questionable propriety,
anct adhere rigidly and sternly to the rule
wblcb has been its guide, doing only that
which is right, and honest, and of good'
report. The qaestion of according or t)f
withholding rights of belligerency must be
pledeed in every case ib view of the particu
lar attending facts. Unless justified by
necessity, it is always and justly
regarded as an unfriendly act and
a gratuitous demonstration of moral
support to the rebellion. It is necessary
aud it is required when the interests and
rights of arfotber government, or of.its peo
ple, are so far affected by a pending civil con
flict as to require a definition of its relations to 1
the parties tbereto. But this compact must j
be one which will be recognized in the sense
of internation^ law as war. Belligerence,
too, is a fact. The mere existence of con
tending armed bodies and their occasional I
conflicts do not constitute war in the sense
referred to. Applying to the existing condi
tion of aftairsin Cuba the tests recognized by
publicists and writers on international law,
and which have been observed by nations of
dignity, honesty, and power, when free from
sensitive or selfish and unwertby motives.
I fail to find in the insurrection the existence
of such a substantial political organization,
real, palpable, and manifest to the world,
having the forms and capable of the ordinary
functions of government toward its own
people and other Slates, with courts for
the administration of justice, with a local
habitation possessing such organization of
force, such material, such occupation of
territory, as to take the contest out of the
category of a mere rebellious insurrection
or occasional skirmishes and place it on the
terrible footing of war, to which a recognition
of belligerency would aim to elevate it. The
contest, moreover, is solely on land. The
insurrection has not possessed itself of a single
seaport whence it may send forth Its flag,
nor has it any means oT communication with
foreign powers except through the military
line of its adversaries. No appre
hension of any of those sudden
and difficult complications wbicb a war
upon tbe oceao is 'apt to precipitate upon
the vessels, both commercial and national,
aod upon the consular officers of other
powers, call for the definition of their rela
tions to the parties to the contest, considered
as a question of expediency. I regard tbe
accordance of belligerent rights still to be as
unwi.se and premature as I regard it to beat
present indefensible as a measure of right.
Such recognition entails upon the country,
according the rights which flow from
it, difficult and complicated duties,
abd requires tbe exaction from the contend
ing parties of the strict observance Of their
rights and obligations. It confers the right
of search upon tbe high seas by vessels of
both parties. It would subject the carrying
of arms and munitions of war, which now'
may be transported freely and without in
terruption in tbe vessels of the United States,
to detention and to possible seizure. It
would give rise to countless vexatious ques
tions, would release the parent Government
from responsibility for acts done by the in
surgents, and would invest Spain with tbe
right to exercise the supervision, recognized
by our treaty of 1795, over our commerce on
the high seas, a very large part of which, in
its traffic between the Atlantic and the Gulf
States, and between all of them and theGulf
States, and between all of them and the
States on the Pacific, passes through the
waters which wash the shores of Cuba. Tbe
exercise of this supervision could scarcely
fail to lead, if not to abuses, certainly to col
lisions perilous to the peaceful relations of
tbe two States. There can be little doubt
to what result such supervision would be
fore long draw this nation. It would be un
worthy of tbe United States to Inaugurate
the possibilities of such result by measures
of questionable right of expediency, or by
any indiscretion. Apart from any question of
theoretical right; I am satisfied that while
the accordance of belligerent rights to the in
surgents in Cuba might give them a hope,
and an inducement to protract the struggle,
it would be but a delusive hope, and would
not remove the evils which this Government
and people are experiencing, but would
draw the United States into complications
which it has waited long and already suf
fered much to avoid ? tbe ?e<s>gnitiou of in
dependence or of belligerency being thus, io
my judgment, equally inadmissible.
; It remains to consider wbait course shall
be adopted should the conflict not soon be
brought to an end by acts of tbe parties
themselves ; and should the evils which
result therefrom, affecting all nations, and par
ticularly the United States, continue, in such
event, I am of opinion that other nations will
be compelled to assume the responsibility
which devolves upon them, and to consider
the only remaining measures possible? me
diation and fntervenlion. Owing, perhaps,
to the large expans<fof water separating the
island from the peninsular, tbe want of har
mony and of personal sympathy between
the inhabitants of the colony and those sent
thitherto rule them, and want of adaptation
of the ancient colonial systems of Europe to
the present time; and the ideas which the
events of the past century have de
veloped, the contending parties appear
to have within themselves no deposi
tory* of common confidence to suggest
wi9dom when passion ' and excitement
have their sway and to assume the part of
peace-maker in this view. In the earlier
days of the contest the good offices of the
United States as a mediator were tendered
in good faith, without anv selfish purpose, in
tbe Interest of humanity and in sincere
friendship for both parties; bat they were
declined by Spain with the declaration,
nevertheless, that at a future time they would
her acceptable. No intimation has been re
ceived chat in the opinion of Spain that time
has been reached: and the strife continues
with ail its dread horrors asd ad! Its injuries
to the interests of tbe United State*
and of other nations; Each party seem
quite capable of working great Injury and
damage to the other as w<m as to all t&o rss
fettons and interests dependent on the exist
ence ot peace in the Island, but t boy' seem
incapable of reaching^By adjustment, and
both have thua fair failed of achieving any
success whereby one party shall possess and
control the island to tl*e exclusion -of the
Other. Under these circumstances the egenoy
of others, either by mediation or by later*
ventfofl, seems to be the only alternative,
which rotbt sooner or later be tefeied fJ
tbe tetflifDstloo *t the strife jafc the soma
time, while thus impressed, aid while
I da not at this Mcae recommend tbo
adoption of say messure of Interven- *
tion, I shall be ready at all timet** and
as the equal friend of both parties, to
respond to a suggestion that the good
offices of the United States will be accept
able to aid in bringing about a peace honor,
able to both. It is doe to Spots, to for as
tbe Government 1s concerned, that tbe
agency of a tbird power, to wbteb I have ?
adverted, shall be adopted only as a last ex
gidicnt. Had it been tb* desire of tbe
nitcd States to interfere ia ' tbe e f&irs of
Cuba repealed opportunities for so dotmr
have been presented within the last few
years ; bat we r bave remained passive, and.
have performed our whole duty and all la
ternaUotal obligations to Spain with friend
ship, faircess, and fidelity, and with a spirit
of patience and forbearance which negatives
eycry possible suggestion of a desire to in*
terfere or to add to the difficulties with
wb|cb she b? been surrounded. The Go
vernment of ,Spaia bas recently submitted to
our Minuter at Madrid certain proposals
which it.U hoped may be' found to be the
basis, IC not, tbeactual iubmha'on, of terma
to meet tbe requirements of Be particular
griefs of which, ibis Government bas felt
itself, entitled to complain.- These pro
posals have not yet reached me in
tbeir full text. On their arrival they
will be taken Into carefui examination, and
may, I hope, lead to a satisfactory adjust- -
ment of tbe questions to which they refer,
uud remove the possibility of future occur
rences suchas have given rise to our just
compiaints. It is understood, also, that re
newed, efforts are being made to introduce
reforms la the internal administration of the
island. Persuaded, however, that a, proper
regard for the interest* of the United States
! and of its citizens entitles it to relief from the
strain to wbich-it bas been subjected by the
difficulties of the questions and the wrong and
losses which arise from the. contests in Cuba,
and that the interests of humanity itself de
maud the cessation of the strife before tbe
whole island shall be bid waste and larger
sacrifice of life be made, I shall feel it my
duty, should my hopes of a satisfactory ad
justment, and ofthe early restoration of peace,
and tbe removal of future causes o{ com
plaint be unhappily disappointed, to ifiake a
further communication to Congress at gome
period not far remote, and during tbe present
session, recommending what may then seem
to me to be necessary.
THE u FREE ZONE."
The Free Zone, so called, several yea re since
established by the Mexican Government in
certain of tbe States of that republic adja*
cent to our frontier, remains in full operation.
It bas always been materially injurious to
honest traffic, for it operates as an incentive
to traders in Mexico to supply without cus
toms-charges tbe wants of inhabitants ou
this side of the line, and prevents tbe same
wants -from being supplied by merchants of
the United State?, thereby to a considerable
extent defrauding our revenue and checking
honest commercial enterprise. Depredations
by armed bands from Mexico on the people
of Texas near the frontier continue. Though
tbe main object of these incursions is rob
bery, they frequently result in the murder
of unarmed and peaceably-di3posed persons,
and In some Instances even the United States
post-offices 'and mail communications bave
been attacked. Renewed remonstrances
upon this subject bave been addressed
to the Mexican Government but with
out much apparent effect. The military
force of this Government disposable
for service in that quarter is anlte inadequate
to effectually guard the line even at those
points where tbe incursions are usually made.
An experiment of an armed vessel on tbe Rio
Grande for that purpose is on trial, and it is
hoped that if not thwarted by tbe shallow
ness of tbe river and other natural obstacles
it may materially contribute to the protec
tiorfof the herdsmen of Texas.
MEXICAN CLAIMS.
The proceedings of tbe joint commission
under tbe convention between the United
States and Mexico of tbe 4th of July, 1868,
on the subject of claims, will soon be brought
to a close. Tbe result of those proceedings
will then be communicated to Congress.
THE CLAIMS AGAINST VENEZUELA.
I am happy to announce that tbe Govern
ment of Venezuela has upon further con
sideration practically ubandoned itB objec
tion to paying tbe United States that share of
its revenue which some years since it allotted
towards the extinguishment of the claims of
foreigners generally. In thus reconsidering
its determination that Government baishown
a just sense of self-respect which cannot
fail to reflect credit upon it in the eyes of all
disinterested persons elsewhere. It ia to be
regretted; however, that its payments on ac
count of claims of citizens of the United
States are fttill so meagre in amount, and that
tbe stipulations of tbe treaty in regard totbo
sums to be paid and tbe periods when these
payments were to take place should bave
been 60 signally disregarded.
TREATIES, AC.
Since my last annual message tbe exebanga
bas been made of tbe ratification of a treaty
of commerce and navigation with Belgium,
and of conventions with the Mexican Re
public for tbe further extension of the j)iut?
commission jespecting claims, with the Ha
waiian Islands for commercial reciprocity,
and with the Ottoman. Empire for extrodi- r
tion; all of which have been duly proclaimed.
I ?? ?'?' THE ALABAMA CLAIMS.
The Court of Commissioners of Alabama
Claims bave prosecuted Its important duties
very assiduously and very satisfactorily. It
convened and was oiganized on the 22d day
or July, 1874 ; and by tbe terms of the act
under which it was Created was to exist for
one year from that date. The act provided,
however, that should it be found Impractica
ble to complete tbe work of the court before
tbe expiration of the year the President
might by proclamation extend the time of
its duration to a period not more than six
months beyond the expiration of the one
year. Having received satisfactory evidence
that it would be impracticable to complete
tbe work within tbe time originally fixed, I
Issued a proclamation, a copy of which is
presented herewith, extending tbe time of
duration of the court for a period of six
months from and after tbe 22d day of July
last. A report made through the clerk of
the court, communicated herewith, shows
tbe condition of tbe calendar on the 1st of
November last, and tbe largo amount of work
which has been accomplished. Thirteen
hundred and eighty-two claims bave been pre
sented, of which six hundred and eighty-two
had been disposed of at tbe date of tbe re
port. I am luformed that one hundred and
seventy cases were decided during the month
of November, and arguments are being made
and decisions given in tbe remaining cases
with all the dispatch consistent with the
proper consideration of tbe questions sub
mitted. Many of these claims are in be ba?
of mariners, or' deferred on the eyideuce or
mariners, whose absence has delayed the
taking or the return of tbe necessary evi
dence. It is represented to me that it will
be impracticable for the court to fisatiy dis
pose of all the cases before it within the
present Hmit of Its durations Justice to the
parties claimant, who have been at large ex
pense in preparing their claims an A obtain
