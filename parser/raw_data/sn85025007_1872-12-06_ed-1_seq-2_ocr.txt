FKI-'lAY. DECEMBER'/, 1S72.
Iu the Senate, yesterday, Mr. Morrill deliver
ed an address in favorlof the bill]for the support
of agricultural colleges, but its further consid
eration was postponed for a week. The
Secretary of War was requested t* furnish
the Seuate with a list of retired army officers.
The Senate refused to take up Mr. Rice's res
olution calling on the President far iu for in a

into Arkansas.
In the House of'Representatives, a memorial
of certain citizens of Baltimore. a-king indemni
ty fur depredations committed by the public
and private armed vessels of France during the
years 1793 and ISOl. was referred to the com
mittee on foreign affairs. The biii providing
for the construction of ten vessels "f war >v:i>
discussed and after the adoption uf in amend
mAnt reducing the number to >ix. three to be
built in public yards and three in private yard.-,
was passed.
The French National Assembly yesteru-.v
afternoon elected :he members of the Commit
tee of Thirty proposed byMioisterPufaure. The
eomiiiittee, as formed con si.-is of nineteen
deputies from the Right, representing y> 1
votes, and eleven deputies from the Left, re
presenting 333 votes. What course the Gov
ernment will take under the eireum.-tauee
seems to be unknown. A special correspondent
of the New York World says that the vote on
the formation of the committee excited the
iiviiest apprehensions in Pari.-, where Sghtiuir
was expected. 'Great excitement, he say-,
prevailed at Chiselhurst: that Marshal MeM.v
hon controls the army, but will act only in obe
dience to the Assembly, not Thiers. He add
that German reoceupation is certain if nchting
occurs. Correspondence has recently ] assed
between Bismarek and Napoieon. G< rci&n
reoccupation will result in the re-?"-tab:i>hn-en:
of the Empire. *
The Washington correspondent ot the Balti
more Sun says that "Senator Rice does no:
hesitate to announce his position. He says
that he new sees no middle-ground, and will
hereafter act unreservedly with the democratic
party. I: is thought that wiil h!so be the posi
tion of Mr. Tipton. Of Messrs. Sumner and
Sehurz, although they wiil doubtless continue
their opposition to ail measures of the majority
which do not meet their approval, it caunot be
expected, in the nature of things, that they will
consent to be classed as members of the demo
cratic party. The same may be said of Messrs.
Trumbull ani Fenton. but as to Mr. Hamilton,
of Texas, it is believed that he will V? by tfco
side of Mr. Rice."
The enforcement of the act of the Legislative
Assembly establishing social equality in ics
taurants. ice cream saloons, barber shops, bath
ing saloon?, Occ., in the District of Columbia,
has been attended with more legal difficulties
than were at first anticipated. Judgment in
all the cases of information under the act has
been rendered in the Police Court, but in all
such cases appeals have been entered and the
informations will have to pass at first the re
view of the Criminal Courr. and thon of other
courts of aj peal.
In relation to the habits of the late Mr.
Greeley, as an editor, one who kn?.w him weil.
says:?"In his little room just above the count
ing-room of the Tribute, he sat all day and pre
pared his cor>y for the printer. He gen
erally very patient, but seldom cordial. He
listened to the business on hand, and then made
his response, and wi:h:-u: ado turned straight
to hi- de-k, oblivion* of the intruder. and con
tinued his work. To a majority of the Tribune
people he was a perfect stranger,rar-!y appear
ing in the editorial department."
A disj ateh from Washington, to the Peters
burg Index says"The friends of the James
River and Kanawha Canal are actively engaged
in pushing their pr-ject, and considering the
best methods of proceeding in Congress. The
present idea is to follow out the plan suggested
in the President's message and to urge the
passage of a bill providing for a commission of
experts to examine and report on the best route
for a water line communication between the
Mississippi Valley and the Atlantic Seaboard."
The Boston Advertiser (administration) dep
recates the "on to St. Domingo" policy which
some of its contemporaries advocate. It takes
the Philadelphia North American to ta-k "for
desiring not only the acquisition of St. Do
mingo, but also that of Cuba, the Danish West
Indies, the Navigator's Islands in the Pacific,
British Columbia, some islands near Terra del
Fuego and a slice from Mexico." This is cer
tainly going far to sweep the platter.
Just as some of the newspapers gut fully
under way in discussing the question as to how
the electoral vote in the States, giving majori
ties for Greeley, should be cast, the vote
icu cast. S i the argument hal to be suspend

Mr. Dana, of the New York San. give? a
detailed account of the illness and death of the
lute Mr. Horace Greeley, which is painful to
read. When the mind of the deceased gave
way, it was enough to say so?and no more.
What happened afterwards, in the incoherent
remarks indaeed by a fevered brain and un
strung nerves, it was unnecessary to bruit to
the world. We presume that Mr. Greeley's
removal to Pleasantville. where he was placed
under the best medical treatment, was the be.-t
thing his friends and family cuuli do, under
the circumstances ot the case. Such an asy
lum promised the most for the rest ora1 ion of
his health and his recovery.
Tin' gentlemen composing the Board of I n
derwriters of Baltimore h:ive called a special
meeting for t i-day. at the rooms of the l> >:ir?i

among insurance offices in regard to the rate
which shall be charged in future on merchan
di.-e and other commodities, and on occupa

iitt.N Steamships tn America.?The cm
piedou of two iron steam-hips at Wilmington,
Delaware,, whose launching wu.? noted in the

elicit- considerable comment from different
journals. The Now York :tfhippine List say-:
?"It seems that we have in reality started on an
era of the successful instruction of iron steam
ers in the United States. These vessels are in
all respects equal to those turned out from the
Clyde, and prove that our naval architects and
mechanics nn UR-et any com petit: >n. The rsj
qui-ite compound engine- connot yet be put up

pany's ships were broui-ht fr.m Glasgow. but
with a prospect <"?f profit once assured, some of
our capitalists wili n-.,t long abstain from com
mencing their manufacture on American ? -ii.
Comj etent persons express the opinion that,
the shipbuilders on the Delaware wili shortly
equal, and eventually surpass the ex ?ehence
attained in maritime architecture on the C'y-le.
It is also believed that the time is not f'"r di.
tant when we shall divide with '.Treat Britain
the iron shipbuilding of the w al l, and u.ti

of the numb-r'if claims reported are wholly
disallowed, either tor di-loyalty <>r for failure to
prove sympathy and adherence to the I'm ion

with the Commission it is evident that but lit
tle regard is paid to the exclusion by Codcp.s
of all but the claims of Union citizen? of the
South whose property was used by the Union
army, consequently it is left for the Cummis

fifteen thousand claims yet to decide and re

to be as great aud probably greater as the law

Tiie Pcblic PiiiiT Question.?I suppose
that every member, and the public too. consid
er this as the most knotty sut.jeet with which
the legislature will have to grapple. Without
an inkling on which to base an opinion, there
seems to be an almost consentaneous conclusion
that the Court of Appeals will decide against
the legislation of last se-sion. and that the State
is bound to receive past due coupons in payment
of taxes. I need not comment upon the condi
tion in which -uch a decision will place the
State. There would have to be raised before
and previous to the expenditure or a dollar for
any and everything else, the sum of
?y0o.430.'NJ, yearly, payment of interest on the
ilo,090,5W of bonds issued under the funding
bill. I say this would have to be paid first,
because those owinc taxes will rirst discharge
their indebtedness to the State with th-.se cou
pons before paving ^ver a dollar iu currenov ?

El!t<>r H'f.W Point Star :?
Dear i*IR.?io one of the recent issues of
your paper you say : "We entertain the be
lief that Braxton and Wise were both defeated
by the antagonisms engendered between friends
naturally and unavoidably growing out ot the
active canvass f r the nominations." I deem it
I r-pvr to state, that the result in the Congres
?i iv.il eleeti n in the i*4r?t District should not
: t e attributed to :!:?:? action or non-action of my
I personal and political triers is. Governor Mont
: a^ue and Judge Critcher, or their friends.
Many of my warmest supporters in the iate
I coort -t. were the earnest advo.-ates of both of
j the above named gentlemen before the comi
? nating Convention, and Judge Critcher and
I (.i "'V. .VUnraeue made speeches in different
I parts ol the District in my behalf during the
canvass.
I I think my d- f at may be fairiy charccd to
the inditTercnce i"_*it by the Conservative voters
in the success ot our Presidential nominee.
Respectfully. Yours.
