V, hen prov Idlug that tho I't estdent should
"from tlmo to tltno glvo to tho Congress In
formation of the stato of tho Union, and
recommend to their consideration such
measures ns ho shall Judge, necessary and
expedient," tho fathers of tho republic rec
ognized no necessity for fixing n limit to
tho length of any communication that a
President might sec fit to mako to tho na
tional loglslatlvo body, but left that ques
tion to bo determined by tho Judgment of
the cxccutlvo as to tho requirements of tho
occasion and tho patlcncu of Congress aud
tho people.
President Cleveland, In Ills first annual
message, has dwelt at unusual length on mi
exceptionally largo number of topics, mak
ing a document which, wcro It ns great In
all respects as It Is In superficial area, would
promptly tako up a position nudgoluto
history near tho head of tho column of great
stato papers. This cxcesslvo length Is a
mistake, for its docs not add to clearness or
force, but rather tends to Impair both of
these essential qualities. Not ono reader In
a hundred will tax his tlmo for a perusal of
such n vast cxpanso of cold tjpe.
It Is truo tint a quarter of a century has
elapsed slnco President Cleveland's last
Democratic predecessor sent his last annnal
mctsogo to Congress; but It Is not probablo
that President Cleveland felt that thcro
existed any necessity to mako up for lost
time. It Is true, also, that President Cleve
land may bo tho last of Democratic Presi
dents, )ct this thought can 'scarcely havo
influenced his mind as, day after day, ho
tirelessly tolled at his desk, adding column
after column to tho redundant amplltudu
of tho structure. Hut it matters not what
caused tho redundancy. "What Is writ Is
writ." Thomcssago is out In all its pro
digious proportions, aud it is but just to
say that it is a candid, comprehensive state
ment of tho President's views. Although
not remarkable for ati) special elegance of
diction, It answers every purposo qulto as
well as If It had been refined and polished
to the last degree of tho ornate.
lly Implication, at least, tho I'rcsldcnt
gives timely notice to Congress tint ho
shall not interfere, except In so far as re
quired by tho fundamental law, with tho
duties devolved on the lcglslatlvo de
partment of tho government. In thosamo
manner ho diplomatically Intimates to tho
lawmakers that ho will not expect undue
meddlesomeness on their part with tho
duties of tho executive. In a system
under which tho executive is a co ordinate
branch of tho legislature, and ono branch of
the legislature Is inado a part of tho execu
tive mechanism, tho temptations to mutual
encroachments aro great, und tho difficulty
of fixing clear lines of demarkatlou is al
most Insurmountable.
Still It Is eminently deslrnblo that thcro
should be no friction occasioned b) either
department encroaching on tho domain
of tho other. It was remarked by ono of
tho Democratic fathers President Andrew
Jackson, If wo remember correctly, and
repeated b) a Republican President that
the party holding cxccutlvopo'verls always
the rarty of concentration, and tho party
out of power lsalwa)s opposing such ag
grandizement or exaggeration of tho execu
tlvcolllce. If President Clovclaudw 111, dur
ing his term of office, see that the boundaries
arc carefully observed, ho will do ono Im
portant part of his duty. But wo confess
to tho Iniposslbllty of thinking of whero
tho lino Is or ought to bo without being re
minded of tho "spot near tho pickerel's pec
toral fins whero tho thorax leaves oil and
the venter begins."
Tho country rejoices with the President
that our relations w ith all foreign powers
"continue to bef rleudl) ." The President's
remarks on this subject constitute the most
Instructive and valuablo part of tho mes
sage. Tho march of Improvement has
brought all civilized nations Into far moro
Intlmato association than they wero but a
few ) cars age. Submarine telegraphic com
munication had not been successfully es
tablished when Mr. Cleveland's last Demo
ctatle predecessor retired. 'Within tho past
twenty years tho nations of Europe and
America have practically moved up to
within handshaking dlstauco of each other.
This has caused many changes In social aud
commercial Intercourse, Incicaslug the ia
blllty to International misunderstandings
and adding to their Injurious effects.
Thcro w Hi bo 6barp dissent from tho Pres
ident's views on commercial treaties and on
tho subject of Intcroceanlc communication,
but thcro can bo but ono opinion as to tho
propriety of his conclusion In tho Kclley
matter. Whcu Austria based her objection
to Mr. Kclley ou religious grounds, or raco
prejudice, sho compelled every truo Ameri
can to takctho side of tho rejected ml ulster.
Thcro Is no occasion for any haste in filling
the vacant mission.
Passing many subjects of which tho mes
sago treats Instructively, and of which tho
Nationai IIei uui ic vn will haveoccaslon to
speak hereafter, wo come to tho question of
finance, or to that branch of it which relates
to tho means of gathering revenues. It is
the opinion of tho President that tho na
tional Ineomo is too laigc. Tho facts
ecaiccly Justlf) this conclusion. Kv en when
the estimates as to expenditures aro trimmed
down to economical limits they will bo
found not far below tho estimated receipts.
It not a penny Is cut oil thcro will bo but
slight, If an), means left for reduction of
tho public debt. If wo aro to fortify our
harbors aud rivers, It wo nro to go ou
building naval vessels, as tho President ad
vises, If we aro to carry forward tho great
Internal Improvements already begun, wo
cannot reduce taxes, Scores of new public
buildings aro needed and thero aro many
pressing occasions for economical and
necessary expenditure of funds In excess of
present receipts.
Tho President professes to bo n protec
tionist; but his proposition as to revenuo
reform Is that of a free trader. IIo calls
for icductiou, and says: "Tho 1 eduction
should be mado In tho revenue derived from
n tax upon tho Imported necessaries of lifo.
Wo thus directly lessen tho cost of living
In every family of tho land, aud rclcaso to
thcpcoploln over) humhlo homo n larger
measttto of tho rowards of fitigal Industry."
Theso "necessaries of life," as the President
well knows, aro tho commodities In tho
production of which millions of ourpeoplo
aro engaged. Let thcmcomoln free, or at
a greatly reduced rato of Imposts and our
factories will bo Idle, our worklngmen and
women sulTcrlug for bicad. This Is the
benefaction tint tho President sttggosts as
the "reward of frugal Industr)." Wo nio

"Tho supprcsslo vcrl as w ell as tho sugges
tlo falsi, with which It Is often contrasted, Is
deemed fraud on tho part of ono bound to
dlscloso tho truth." So sojs tho law dic
tionary, and, Judged by that definition, tho
report of Commissioner Sparks, of tho gen
eral land office, Is a moro glaring "fraud"
than any It professes to have. discovered.
Takofor cxamplo tho statcmcntlnrcgard to

that for ono huudercd miles he could not
find the traco of a road. Upwards of 110,
000 acres wcro patented to tho company In
lbS.1, after this report had been made."
Commissioner Sparks knew when ho
"touched tho pen" to that statement that
time enough elapsed between tho dates re
ferred to In tho first and second sentences
of that paragraph for tho wholo matter to
bolaldbcforo two succccsslvo Congresses,
and that it was only after their refusal to

Attention is called to an Interview In
another column with Chief Engineer N. 11
Clark, U.S. N., adversely criticising "ex
Fresldcnt" Tlldcn's plan of sea coast de
fense, and recommending tho plan adv 0
cattd by Admiral Amtncn. Iloth theso
distinguished nav al officers h.iv 0 had four
years practical experience In sea coast war
fare, defensive and offensive, nnd their
view s aro certainly entitled to consideration.
They favor tho construction of a limited
number of land fortifications at certain
points along our coast, but depend mainly
upon naval forco as set forth.
"Ex-Prealdent" Tlldcn unquestionably
know s moro about railroad wrecking than
sea coast defense. Nevertheless tho Na
tio vl RnruiLiCAN Is Inclined to npprovo
tho suggestion In his "messago" to Con
gress that wo can content ourselves with
adding but sparingly to our navy so long ns
our efforts aro experimental.
It Is far better to wait and sco how the
Itoach cruisers turn out, lly that time w 0
shall havooxpcrlcncoto culdo us, aud can
add, not sparingly, as ex-President Tllden
recommends, but abundantly, to our naval
force. It seems now qulto likely that tho
Roach cruisers will bo duplicated. Tho
opinion gains ground that no better war

Our relations with Austria Hungary form nn

Sir. Kclley. Tho demands of Austria, tho Pres

Tho President U opposed to tho treaty nego
tiated with Nicaragua, for tho construction
by tho United Hates of a ship canal through
Mcaraguan territory: reason, to escape entan
gling alliances. Tho President prefers tho
Tchuantcpcc route, and regards tho ship-railway
project as deserving consideration. Ho
favors an Intcroceanlc transit across the Amor
lean Isthmus, for tho common uso of mankind,
aud approves and quotes tho followlugdcclara
ration of Casswbllo Secretary of Stato In 1838,
"What the United States want In Central
America, next to tho happiness of Its people,
Is tho security and neutrality of tho Inter
oceanlo routes which lead through It."
Tho interests and Influcnco oi tho threo
trunk lino railway s across tho continent are

words:
Tho construction of threo transcontinental

that cv cry effort has been mado by this govern

tho representatives of China In their Investi

TlMMtN'S MESSAGE DISCUSSED.
Ills Scheme for Const Defense Criti
cised by nn Export
A copy of a letter from Hon. Samuel J.
Tildcn to Hon, J. 0. Carllslo, speaker of tho
House of Representatives, on the subject of
coast defenso was shown to Chief Engineer
N, 1). Clark, U. 8. N., an expert on tho
subject, by a reporter for tho National
Kei'uhlican last night. Ho appeared
familiar with tho brevet messago to Con-
?rcss, and freely discussed It upon a tcnta
Ivo remark,
"You will obscrvo by tho letter," ho said,
"that ho proposes to depend almost en
tirely on land forts as means of defense;
now ovcry professional man knows that
such a method is entirely inadequate to
accompusu 1110 ouicci sougue 1110 proicc
tcctlon of tho seaboard cities from a naval
foe and as to our valuable coostwlso com
merce, It could bo entirely destroyed, even
if our cntlro coast was completely lined
with tbo most formidable fortifications,
armed with the most powerful puns.
With simply land fortifications, n com
parative weak maritime foo could do for our
coastwlso commcrco what tho Alabama and
her consorts did for our foreign commerce,
even though wo expended a thousand mil
lion dollars ou sen coast forts. Besides It
would bo unbecoming tho dignity of n great
nation llko ours to depend ou tho mcro
passive defenso which laud batteries alTord;
our defenso should bo active, wo should
meet tho enemy on Iho sea, with an equal
or superior force, and enpturo or destroy
him beyond rongo ot tho homes of our
people.
"Our cxpcricnco during tho civil war
proved thero was no fort equal In rcslstanco
to tho sand fort. It was easy to construct,
and when damaged could bo repaired with
facility; but guns, ships, and engines can
not bo improvised, as thoy rcqulro a consid
erable cxpcndlturo ot tlmo, besides much
cxpcricnco In construction."
"What would you suggest in tho prem
ises t"
"Instead of expending a considerable
sum of money in tho construction of sea
coast forts, it would, without doubt, bo far
moro advantageous to tho country to con
struct tho ndmlrablo sea-coast canal first
proposed by Admiral Ammcn, U. B. N.,
connecting all tho sounds, bays, and Inlets
which project inward from tho soa, In an
almost unbroken series, from tho mouth of
tho Rio (Irando in Texas to Eastport, Mo ,
and up tho Mississippi river to tho great
lakes If necessary.
"Such a water lino of Internal communi
cation would glvo complete protection to
our coastwlso and lake commcrco In lime of
wnrwould greatly lessen tho cost of Insur
ance in tlmo ot pcaco, and would cuablo us
to conccntrato our fleet, consisting ot
cruisers up to 8,600 tons displacement, de
flcctlvo rams, and torpedo boats, at any
point threatened by an enemy; so that ft
would bo a very bold commander who
would venturo to appcarwithiuourwaters,
knowing ho would havo to contend with
such a system of defense."
"Would this bo better than a cordon of
Iron cladsJ"
"The mosslvo weight nnd strength ot tho
ordinary armor-clad aro simply elements of
weakness when such vessels havo to con
tend with swift and handy dcllcctlvo rams
and torpedo-boats, and Mr. Tlldcn Is per
fectly right when ho doubts tho expediency
of constructing such ponderous vessels for
our navy, but light cruising vessels can bo
constructed, having heavy guns mounted
on dcllcctlvo shields, which can contend
successfully with heavy nrmor-clads."
"Do you discountenance forts entirely I"
"Without doubt tho entrances of all Im
portant harbors should bo defended by two
or more forts, but bey ond that land bat
teries scrv 0 no efficient purpose In addi
tion to tho forts guarding tho entrances to
harbors thero should bo a naval forco equal
or superior 10 mat iikcij 10 uo urougut
against us, theso consisting of light cruisers
and rams, armored on tho dcllcctlvo prin
ciple, whllo a number of swift torpedo
boats would bo stationed in tho harbors,
ready to conccntrato 011 telegraphic notlco
nt any point along tho canal whero an
enemy may appear.
"Another point worthy of consideration
is tho tolls that might bo collected on cer
tain portions of tho canal; they would go
far toward paying tho interest on tho money
invostcd. For instaucc, tho portion of tho
canal connecting Chesapeake and Dolawaro
bays would command nil tho tonuago from
Baltimore and tho north, as well as to Eu
ropean ports. Tho present is a most pro
pitious tlmo for constructing tho different
classes of small vessels which our navy re
quires, as both vv ages aud material uavo
not been low cr for V cars.
"It Is a mlstako to supposo that Iron or
steel vessels deteriorate moro rapidly than
land fortification; they both becomo obso
lete In stylo at about an even rato; tho
British Iron-clad Warrior was constructed in
1S5S, and her hull Is reported at tho present
tlmo to bo in as good condition as when sho
was first launched, having had no other re
pairs than scraping and painting."

the New York Herald. Each was accom

poorly dressed; tho other was richly attired.
Tbo conductor collected tbo faro from tho
poor woman first. Sho handed him a lu

"How old Is tho boy" ho asked.
"Flvo years."
"Ho looks a llttlo older," said the con

he Isn't."
Ho turned to tho rich woman who gave

"Tho boy's ago, lady t" ho Inquired.
"Flvo years."
"Ho must bo older."
"No, ho is not," angrily.
"Why, mother," exclaimed tho chtld,
"you know I was 0 my last birthday."
Tho rich woman Hushed, bit nor lips,
Sicked another 5-cent pleco from her well

Tho success of tho experiments mado re
cently on tbo Ninth avenue elevated rail
road for running locomotives by electricity
led a reporter for tho New York Mall and
Express to make Inquiries yestcrtlay ot tho
electric company making tho experiments
as to how far electricity has superseded
steam and tho outlook for tbo Immcdlato
futuro on tho subject. Sold tho manager of
the company 1
"Several companies havo lately been or
ganized, all of which havo turned their at
tention to tho practical substitution ot elec
tricity for steam In various ways. It Is
found that wherever steam Is used to obtain
2.1-horso power or less, electricity Is moro
economical, Tho advantages aro 1 nsmallcr
spaco occupied, much loss nolso nnd no
heat, and the fact that tho power can bo
turned on or stopped at will. Thcro Is no
boiler required and no fire, ns tho power is
supplied to the motor by wires from a cen
tral station, on tho samo prlnclplo that gas
or steam heat Is supplied."
" W hero aro theso companies located?"
"There is ono In Massachusetts which has
already in operation a power-plant running
a CO-horse-powcr generator. It is distribut
ing power to sovcutccu different customers,
among which nro thoso using printing
presses, sewing machines, lathes, A.c. This
company has Just ordered a second gener
ator, and their distribution will bo largely
extended, the demand for electric power In
the neighborhood being very great. In this
city thcro Is a subcompany which has a
plant of from CO toOO-horso power, which
will bo started in a few days. It will sup
ply from 2 to 3-horso power up to 20. Tho
demand for this Is already greater than
expected, and thcro has been delay In get
ting permission to ploco tho wires under
? round. In Spruco street thcro Is an dec
rlc plant which has for somo tlmo been
succcssiuiiy running two ircigui ciovaiors,
each lifting about a ton. Thcro aro also
motors In placo to run two largo printing
presses in Iicckman street, which aro ex
pected to be started within n week. Thoy
aro of eighteen and twenty horso power. It
is proposed to rapidly oxtend tho distribu
tion of this power, It being estimated that
at least 5,000-horso power will bo required
below Caual street."
"How far can this electric power bo sent
from n central point?"
"Overall area of two nnd two and a half
miles without a practical loss ot over 113 to
40 per cent. In other words, thcro can bo
recovered GO per cent, at tho point of do
llvcry of tho Initial power, and thcro Is, of
course, no shafting or belting ot auy de
scription. Why, you can't carry steam
power 1,000 feet without friction so great
as to bo unprofitable."
"Repairs on tbo motors amount to llttlo
or nothing. At our works wo havo been
running a carpenter shop bynn electric
motor of D-horso power for three years.
It has run a saw that has cut thousands of
feet ot heavy timber and it has not becu
taken out for repairs but onco and this was
for something very slight not costing $3
ond not taking up ono hour's time. As to
expense, n man is not required to bo in
constant attendance, for nil that is to bo
dono is to keep tho motor clean and turn on
or off tlio power as it Is wanted. As to tho
original expenso ot tho motor It Is not moro
than that of an engine, besides tho saving of
fuel, ilc, makes Iho running CO per cent,
less. Thcro Is an electric motor running
tlio elevator of tbo Oarncr cotton mills at
Ncvvburg, which never yot has had to bo
repaired, and which hoists up all tho bales
of cotton used." ,
" hero elso aro thoy in uso ?"
"Resides thoso used to run tho electric
street railway in Baltimore, which has al
ready been described in tno Man and ex
press, thcro Is ono In Nova Scotia, used In
n gold mine, whero tho motor Is a mile
from tho mine. Tho power Is applied tho
samo as steam tor lifting cages, runnlug
tho pump, Ac. Wo havo Just received on
order for a CO-horso power plant from Colo
rado, also to lio used In mining a largo
silver mine. Hero tho power will bo trans
mitted threo miles, and will savo tho cost
of tho plant In fuel alono In ono year."
"What is tho greatest weight you havo
known electric pow cr to lift?"
'Ono and a half tons, forty feet a minute.
Tho greatest weight hauled on a trace is
slxty-flvo tons, which was dono on tho
Ninth avenuo elevated road, on a grade ot
ninety feet to tho mile. This Is tho great
est weight ever hauled by electricity In tho
worm, untier tuts system 1110 motors aro

tbo rural pastor, tho reverend deacon, tho
country doctor, tho vlllago dressmaker, and
tho various well-known unprofessional
t)pcs. Tho lovo of gossip Is exemplified
by tho sewing society. Tho plot is simple,
tho Interest turning on tho self-denial of aa
old maid, who burns her father's will,
thereby diverting tho property from hersclC
to her married brother. Sho marries tho
clergyman at last, and hcrsccrct is revealed
at tho wedding by tbo dressmaker, who was
nlono aware of It, and who, though a born
gossip, held it sacred for y cars. Tho talo la
cleverly told. Tho local color Is warm and
true, and tho delineation ot character! clear
and happy.

square, Cambridge Mass., has had tho
most notew ortby ealo ever known for a
book of Its class nearly GO.OOO copies al
readythis, too, although numerous com
petitors and imitators wcro put In tho
market after it becamo apparent that
Moses King's collection had met with so
much success. This collection of "Stu
dents' Songs" was edited by William II.
Hills, of tho Harvard class ot 1880 (now
an editor of tho Boston Globoj, and pub
lished by Moses King, of tho Harvard class
of 1881, tho names of both appearing on
tho title pago of tho genuine collection
only. Its success is duo chiefly to tho
freshness of its sixty copyrighted songs,
comprising thoso Jolly and melodious tunes
and peculiar phrases which, within tho
past ten years, bavo arisen aud become
generally popular among tbo students ot
all American colleges. Tho low price,
too 60 cents and tho attractlvo appear
ance, also, havo had their Influcnco lu
making "Students' 8ongs" tho most suc
cessful book of Its class ever published in
this country.
Dr. Verdi, of Washington, gained a wldo
reputation In 1805 by his skillful cure or
Secretary Seward, who was nearly mur

women and babies havo had peculiar suc
cess; somo years ago "Maternity," and this
year "Tho Infant Philosopher; Stray Lcavcs
from n Baby's Journal." This latter a
"cuto" little booklet In parchment paper

as It is (80 cents), gives moro laughter than
a Jest book, and moro good senso for moth
ers than many a weighty treatise.

traits of tho father of Lis country, and will

valuo of a composlto Is duo to Its method or
manufacture by photography. In this coso
ono of the composites Is derived from sovcu
separate portraits ot Washington, nnd two
of them from flvo each. In this way It is
thought that the composite should contain,
