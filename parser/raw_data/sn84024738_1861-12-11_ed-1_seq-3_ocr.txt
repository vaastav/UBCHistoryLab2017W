My Dear Friend—Man we are, back iv jail
again, afier being < n exhibition for four
months, to show the strength and power of
tbe rebel rag under winch we (1 had almost
said live, but that would b? a tuiogv) stay, in
order to r_ vi. c the drooping spirit* of its ad
mirers.
As yoa are aware, we wt--. c here befoie ; but
it is something r* w tor men to be imprisoned
twice for the Bams offence. However, they
aaay we are now permanently located ior the
winter.
Weareaarronnded by nil the vile features
peculiar to prison life. There ar* under the
same ro: f with us persons .guilty of the most
revolting crimes that ever disgraced human j
nattare —murderers, thieves, mail robbers,
even ths abandoned wretches of easy Times |
nnd so powerful is ttie secession feeling in
this stronghold, of a rebellion th.._ these vile
criminals i.*iet:t lo despise your correspon

Y'-iu know 'hut I wa_ : iways of the opin

tion of onr people; but I now see under What
a delation I la_____d. When I think of our J
condition, and the man}* petty tyrannies we i
bavebeen _üb_°ct_d to, i wender how they
reconcile it with their boasted chivalry. I
wish I had paper to give yon tl full account
of all th it has occurred to us since the battle
of Haaaßsa*. btlt thiij is the last sheet iv my
jHssessicn.
You no doubt received the letter I sent you
from the tob .ceo f ictorv at Richmond, and 1
bops that thi—which 1 send by an aader

activity ot a life of this sort,to a mau brought
up to active business, is sufficient punish

which arc heaped upon na. We have lost

McClellan line at last got aflimpseof his
first born. On Wednesday morning last, the
4'.h mat , he left Washington for tbe first time
since he a>-Biimed command of _______ ther*>, to
go to Baltimore to meet hia wit« and child.—
The Washington telegraphic correspondent
of the New York Herald, cf the Uh instant,
says:
At 11 o'clock this morning an engine and
el-gaat car .-ittaclied, 1. f i the Washington de
pot lor Haltimore. 'iwo persons occnpiofl
the car, one a lady aud the other a gen He
man. The latter was about five feet six, stout

moustache aud imperial, lie wa<> dressed in
a plain black suit. The lady Wea the wif.- of
oneot General Mct.'lellan's staff. Thespeeial
train, as It pa***_ ihe principal militarr sta

who were loitering about. They gazed at the
occupants of the car, supposing them to be
somedislinguished strangers from abroad.
llie train arrived at Kaltimore, where the
parties were to meet friend., from the We3t.—
An explosion ol a locomotive on the Western
r.ad, causing the instant de.th of the engi

kept ihe B_raa_era la Baltutort several
hours. A portion of the lime waa occcupied

had no time te spare, proceetled to ilie Eutaw

Thi* strange gentleman in black wasr.o less
a personage than Oe.rge 11. McClellan, Gen

THE REPORTED I)!_*«iiIEE.IIKMT 15 THE C___UB__T—
A> All'llMPl TO eauuTH IT OVEB.
From the following we should infer that
Bennett s correspondent has been instructed
to Invent some pretext by which to make it
appear that the reported diili.ulty between
old Abe and his Cabinet had no foundation in
fact. The eitort, however, is fruitless, for tho
facts of a disagreement between them, com
luunicated by more than one Washington
correspondent, too plainly indicate that the
rupture is of a serions character and may yet
eventuate iv a complete dissolution of the
whole concern. "We give below what the
_7..!.._. telegraphic correspondent say?, under
date of Washington, December 4 :
Tl'.ere is a class of people in this city who
employ their time in in venting falsehoods and
circulating them, and when any of these re
ports reach the newspapers the inventors
thereof chnc'tle In their sleeves and boast
that they have sold somebody. Yesterday i
and last night the class of persona alluded to
started the absurd report that there had been
a row iv Hie Cabinet, and v. it the quarrel
was chiefly between Sew'trd and Came
ron; that the former announced hi_ in
teution to resign if Cameron, report waa
not changed, and mat Cameron swore
he Y.oui__ lestgn if it waa; and, Anally,
that it was agreed that it should be partially
altered; that Cameron submitted gracefally,
a;ul harmony was restored This whole sta te
meiit was an invention of a iellow who hud
heeu snubbi d by Gen. Cameron, because iho
latter had refused to comply wiiii the for
mer's demand., for contrails. The falsifier
was sent for by a Government olticer and
properly reprimanded. That the Meaaaga
aud reports were examined i.nii properly d:s
--i caseed, and is thepraetioa (a such nana, is
true some were perhaps modified; but that
j the .est of good feeling prevailed between
the President and diiieretit members of
the Cabinet, and that such feeling exist-, now,
is a positive and well known fact.
WHAT THE SEW TOKK HBBALD 9AV_ OP OLD AKT-'S
■____**,
From the following editorial remarks of
I the New York Herald, of the oth inst., we
should not be surprised if Bennett'a animos
ity towuids the abolitionists of the North did
not yet induce him to hoist the banner of
t-eaee, as the most effectual method by which
to bread, down that party :
Tiie President's Message, oa ihe slavery
question, will reassnre the country, and give

There is no disguising the fa<*t that the feel

removal of Gen. Fremont, is general ami in

cruelty toward that odl.er. His disgrace and.

that he was to be removed: that obstacles
have been put lv his way to cause him to
stumble; the Investlgatldas were ordered In
relation to his acts without giving him a
1 chance to explain, and that everything was

Arago, making captives of Gen. Se jtt, Areh

appears mightily to tickl*> the philosopher-of
the Tribune, and they chnckle heartily at the
idea of getting some of their old enemies out of
the way, and safely stored between foor stone
walls, in some remote corner of Ilixie's land.
They don't care about Scott much, but
Weed's prospective incarceration fills them
with the kind of s itisfaction their frie»d
.Satan experienced when he had successfully
emancipated from ee!es f ial allegiance the In
habitants of the Garden of Lieu. They grin
a little, too. at the chance of evil happening
to the venerable Aulihishop, Whom they bate
on account of his supposed affiliation With
Secretary »,f State Seward. Now onr opin
ion i. Ihat Government ought to lose no time
in dispatching steamers in search of the
Nashville, and not rest until that ves
sel is tafely docked in smie Northern |
harbor, and incapible of such acts of piraoy i
as the Tribune pants after. Let no room bi* '.
