business on the Northern Pacific is
unusually good, the cbal traffic es.
pecially so. He said that the railroad
is carrying an enormous amount of
coal from the Carbon county mines
and he does not anticipate that even
a cold spell will cause a coal famine
in the state, though it might force
the company to increase the amount
of coal transported from the mines.
'He said that it was the intention to
push work on the new union depot and
the company hoped to use it soon, but
said that there was a large amount
of. work yet to be done on the struct
ure and the tracks incident thereto.

self as well :pleased with conditions
throughout the northwest and said he
believed conditions were improving
everywhere.
The entire party were shown the

WINE ROOM LAW

SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS CON
VICTION OF WILLIAM CONWAY.
MUST: SEiRV SENTENCE
Decision of District Court in Appeal
of WIlliam Conway From Conviction
in Di9trIot C`o1bt f"' 'Vi0 oiting 'wWine
(Special to The Gazette.)
'HELENA, Mont., Dec. 17.-The ;su
preme court today handed down a de
cision affirming the conviction in Yel
lowstone county of William Conway
on the charge of "permitting' a female
in a place where liquors are sold." He
must therefore serve the 60 day jail
sentence. This is the first conviction
under what is known as the wine
room law.
William Conway was tried and con
victed of running a road house in the
Stockade east of Billings about one
mile, more than eighten months ago.
The building has since been burned
down. Deputies from the sheriff's of
fice went to the Stockade and procur
ed the evidence upon which the com
plaint was based.
Judge Fox sentenced Conway to the
county jail for sixty days, but the
case was appealed and an appeal
bond was given. The grounds for ap
peal were the insufficiency of the
evidence and the alleged unconstitu
tionality of the law.. The decision of
the supreme court therefore is taken
to uphold the constitutionality of the
anti wine room law passed at the
last session of the legislation, and
under which there have been several
convictions in this county.

POSTAL SAVINGS BANK

Not Believe Establlsmq~nt a'the

WIASTNiGTON, Ded. 17.-Senator
Burkett today addressed the senate in
favor of postal savings banks. Refer
ring to the many plans that have been
suggested for the rejuvenation cf the
present banking system, Mr. Burkett
said that all of them would fail ,com
pletely to meet the situation because
they eliminated from consideration the
great class of depositors that the pos-i
tal banks are intended to, provide. The
fears of the bankers that the postal
savings 'bank institutions would make
an unwelcome competitor were notbe
lieved to be well founded, said SeSlia
for Burkett.
