THE C, II. & D. SUES M'KEEN
Judge Gresham Is Asked to Restrain
Him from Selling Vandalia Stock,
Ind a Temporary Injunction Is Granted
History of the Peal Ives Goes to Terre
Haute to Consult with McKeen.
There was a great deal of mysterious consul
tation and bustling about in tho immediate
yicinuyei use unuea ciates court-rooms yes
terday mornine. Mr. C. W. Fairbanks appeared
to have something important on his mind, and
subsequent developments showed that bis
appearance was not deceptive. He and Ramsey
Is Maxwell filed a suit on behalf of the Cin
einoati, Hamilton & Dayton Railway Company
against W. R. McKeen, of Terre Haute, asking
o injunction against the sale of certain stock.
Judges Oteaham and Wood got together, and
after hearing the "bill granted a temporary
Injunction. Marshall Hawkins left at noon for
Terre Haute to serve the papers. The complaint
meanwhile was withdrawn from file until 3
'clock in the afternoon, when Hawkins tele
graphed that he had serrice.
The bill charges that prior to June 4, 1887,
Henry S. Ives, who was at the time Tice-presi
lent of the CL, H. & D.f received authority
from the directors of that company to purchase,
as trustee for that company, 20,000 shares of the
stock of the Terre Haute & Indianapolis, a cor
poration which has less than 40,000 shares in its
japital stock, of the par value of $50 each, and
k pay therefor not to exceed $100 pec share;
that McKeen, having full knowledze of the
icope of Ives's authority, and of the action of
ihe CL, H. & D. directors, sold to'lves, as trustee
!or the C,E & D., 11,160 shares of T. H. & I.
. ttock at $100 per share, amounting to $1,116,000,
ind Ives paid to the defendant on account of
ihe purchase $S89,500, leaving a balance due of
220,500. Ives also purchased at the same time
Irom the T. H. & L Railroad Company, throueh.
UcKeen as president, 8,810 shares of the T. H.
Sb I. stock which stock belonged to the T. H.,
& I., and stood in the name of President Mc
Keen as trustee at $02.50 per share, amounting
to So52.o00. and paid therefor on behalf of the
plaintiff $552,500. As a part of this transaction,
and in consideration of the sale by President
pIcKaen of the 8.840 shares of stock. Ives,
unknown to the plaintiff, agreed to pay to Mc
Keen, individually, 75 per cent, of the amount
f the stock so sold bv bim as president the
sum of $331.500 and further to purchase from
McKeen. individually, 4,446 shares at the par
value or $oU each; of the stock of the Terre
. Haute & Logansport Railroad Company at 50
per cent., $111,150, which last mentioned stock
Was of little or no value. To cover the sum of
$331,500; $111,150 and $226,500, the last amount
Ixtin? the halanea ranllv dan on thm nnrrhnom nf
the 11,160 shares of Terre Haute & Indianapolis
stock. Ives executed his note as trustee to the
rder of McKeen, dated Jan. 4, 1837, payable
at the option of Ives on or before six months, for
. the sum of $669,150. with 6 per cent, interest.
,, end delivered to McKeen, as collateral security
for the note, 11,160 shares of stock of the Terre
' T 7 - . - p. r j : i : j . t Ate -i m
jauic a, luumiiBpons auu u , iiu auarsa ni
Terre Haute & Logan sport stock, with authori
ty to McKeen to sell the stock after default in
Ihe payment of the note, without notice.
Tha nlainliff . Vi ni.a that tli Afani4anf Ir n n
that Ives had no authority to purchase the Terre
Haute & Logaosport stock for or on account of
the C, H. & D., nor to pledge the 11.160 shares
f the stock of the T. H. & I., or any part there
of, on account of the purchase of the stock of
the T. H. & L. The defendant now has the 11,-
lou snares or tne I . a. es JL stock in bis posses
IL
eion, and claims to hold the same as collateral
security for the note of $669,150.
The bill further charges that lyes pretended
to the plaintiff that all of the T. H. & I. stock
heretofore mentioned 11,160 shares and 8,840
hares had been purchased by Ives at $100 per
snare, and tne plaintiff, nas so believed until re
cently. The real indebtedness, the plaintiff
avers, is $I6.o00, with a month's interest at
6 per cent., which sum the plaintiff is will
ing 10 pay. ana nas onerea to pay
upon tne return or tne 11,150 snares or T. JtL &
:L stock. . Ihe defendant refuses to accept, how
ever, or to deliver to the plaintiff the stock, and
tnreatens to immediately sell the stock to some
third person who may not have notice of the
rights of the plaintiff, upon pretense that the
nalanee due the defendant is $669,la0. On this
.-. statement of fact the bill asks a temporary re-
. straining order to prevent Mr. McKeen from dis
posing of the 11.160 shares of the T. II. & L
stock, and further prays that, upon final hear
ing, the defendant be required either to accept
from the plaintiff $226,500, with interest, in full
nd final payment, and to cancel the note
against plaintiff and to deliver up the 11,160
lhares of stock, or that the defendant be re
quired to eaneel the note and return to the
plaintiff the sum of $889,a00, with interest
After considering the bill, and consulting with
Judge Woods, Judge Grisham granted an order
restraining the defendant from in any way dis
posing of the 11,160 shares of T.. H. & L stock,
and set the case for farther hearing on Dec. 22,
last.
, .. On the same train that bore Marshal Hawkins
to Terre Hante, by a strange coincidence, Mr.
Henry S. Ives was a passenger. He was travel
ing in the unassuming style of a man who has
10 pay nis iare, instead or a special car and a
guard, as he was wont to when he figured as the
xsapoleon of finance. He had a ticket for Kan
sas City, and stated that he was bound for that
point.
The complaint, as presented, charges only nn-
auioonzea action on me pari ot ives as vice-
president, with Knowledge of the same on the
part of McKeen. It orieinally charged fraud,
sverriug that Ives and McKeen .had made an
agreement to divide the sum of $351,000 tho 75
per cent of the purchase money of the 8,840
shares charged to have been paid to McKeen
but this allegation was stricken out before the
ill was filed.
Day before yesterday several of the C,H. &
u. officials called on 31 r. McKeen, at Terre
Haute, and tried to make some arrangement
with bim in regard to the matter. He is report
ed as saying, in an interview, that nothing was
laid to him by them in regard to paying the
aotes; that, in fact, he did not understand what
ihe gentlemen came for. He said that Ives Pad
forfeited the money paid, amounting to more
than $600,000, as well as the hypothecated stock.
Ihe visitors, Messrs. Dexter. Hoffer and Max
well, left for Cincinnati at midnight.
Ives In Consultation with Sir. McKeen.
Jpecial to the Indiananoiis Journal.
Terre Haute, Ind., Dee. 8. United States
Marshal Hawkins served notice -. on President
ilcKeen, of the Terre Haute & Indianapolis
ompany, this afternoon, of the granting of the
.empor&ry restraining order issued by Judge
jrresham, at Indianapolis, against disposal of
be stock of that company held by him as se
mrity on the note for $669,500 given by Ives,
ind which went by default in New York
resterday. The complaint alleges that Mr.
TW 1 . .
icieen may sen tne stocc to some
third party. It ean be said on the highest
inthority that the purpose is to Keep the stock
sere, and that the Vandalia road is not likely to
)ass out of the McKeen control. It is the inten
tion to operate the road, and there is no prob-
binty of its passing into the bands of a third
parry, mr. jucteen nas no oesire to dispose of
bis interest, which is cow even larger than it
ever was. The note given by Ives was siened
' Henry S. Ives, Trustee." In the trade
there was no legal connection of the Cincin
nati, Hamilton & Dayton company, the
note not having been given by Ives as trustee
for that company. Ives never claimed that he
acted as such, and now says he did not It
takes two to make a trade, and the C. H. & D.
lid not appear as one of the two. Whatever
resolution may have been adopted by the CL. II.
fc D. board of directors, it is held, did not ope
rate to make a trade on its own account, as Mr.
McKeen did not deal with the board of directors.
The same train that brought the United States
Marshal bere. also brought Henry. S.
Ives. He tried to make his . trip a
leeret one, but an Indianapolis evening
paper announced that he had passed-through
.here, and the trainmen knew him, so that
hen he alichtod from the train the word went
rora mouth to mouthy until this evenine all the
Wwn is talking about his presence here. He is
registered at the hotel as ""Henry Seymour, of
New York." He is accompanied bv a gentleman
who is registered as ''William 'Carson. New
Yort." Mr. Ires came bere to see Mr. McKeen,
ind is in consultation with him to-night, but at

A Big Reduction of Kates.
Chicago, Dec, 8. The general managers of
be lines between Chicago and the Missouri river
set to-day. and formally adopted the report of the
general freight agents arranging for a reduction
of freight rates in Illinois, Iowa and Missouri, and
of through rates from Chicago to the Missouri
river. The reductions are on all classes of
freight, and will average fully 25 per eent. below
the present tariffs in force. It was agreed that
the new rates should go into effect Jan. 1, if the
Wabash could be persuaded to postpone action
until that date; if not, then on Dec. 20. The
reductions mean a loss ot $10,000,000 per annum
in net revenues.
Salt Against the Pennsylvania.
Pittsburg, Dec 8. Papers are being pre
pared for a suit against the Pennsylvania rail
road for $114,000, by Holdship & Irwin, "oil re
finers, of this city. The firm alleges that the
Pennrylvania railroad has unjustly discrimi
nated against them in rates, and that seven
simila claims have been settled quietly within
thn last six months for amounts aggregating over
$100,000. Suit will be entered in accordance
with an act of 1883, which allows a claim for
three times the amount of loss sustained. Hold
ship & Irwin's information shows that in 1885
and 1886 certain shippers of oil were granted a
rebate of 10 cents per barrel by the Pennsyl
vania railroad. They will ask for three times
what the rebate would amount to $114,000,
with interest since 1885.
Forcible Resistance to Railroad Building.
Cawllac, Mich., Dec 8. The Toledo, Ann
Arbor & Cadillac railroad, in course of construc
tion, has met with much opposition from farm
ers whose land it crosses in this vicinity. Last
night a farmer named Chapin built a shanty on
the grade of the road, and when the iron gang
reached the place this afternoon they found
Chapin, his two sons, and four others occupying
the shanty, all armed, and threatening to shoot
unless the gang desisted in their work. They
did not heed the warning, and two of their num
ber were shot, one in the hand and the other in
the bewels. The farmers were arrested.
Sensational Report Denied.
Chicago, Dec. 8. The officials of the Illinois
Central road deny the report, published to-day,
that a gigantic railroad deal was about to be
consummated here, whereby the Illinois Central
would secure control of the Mobile & Ohio road.
The only foundation for the report is said to be
the fact that J. C Clarke, ex-president of the
Illinois Central, was requested by the debenture
bondholders of the Mobile & Ohio to inspect the
property and finances of the company for them.
This Mr. Clark did. making a eareful investiea
tion, and then writing an elaborate report as to
the state of affairs.

Eight months ago, about the time that the

Suggestions of President Furnas for Increas
ing the Horticultural Society's Uesfulness.
The session of the Indiana Horticultural So
ciety, yesterday morning, was opened with
paper from Dr. Allan Furnas, of Danville, the
newly-elected president, on the problem of in
creasing the usefulness of the society. He gave
his opinion that the first duty Of every member
of the society was to become thoroughly
interested in the work himself, and then
to do all he can to interest others.
It was not enough to attend annual meet
ings, mere should be work between time,
and an ad interim committee should be ap
pointed to investigate and agitate. State farm -
era institutes should be held, as in other
States, and if the Agricnltural Society will not
look after the matter the Horticultural Society
could afford to make a movement in that direc
tion. 1 bere should be some means adopted to
promote a generous rivalry between the coun
ties in their horticultural work, such as a pre
sentation of a banner to the most deserving,
and also a summer meeting of the society for
the inspection of summer fruits and the best
modes of cultivating them. More attention
should be given to ornamental gardening, and.
in tbts connection especially, ladies should be
given a greater share in the work of the society.
a general discussion followed, in which it was
strongly urged by several members that more
effort should be made to induce ladies to attend
the meetings and take interest in the work of
the society. The fact that no lady had a place
on tne programme of the present meeting was
referred to and criticised. . It was urged that
members should bring their wives to the meet
ings, as several lad ies had come to the doors and
turned back because they saw no other ladies
present .
Resolutions were introduced and adopted pro
viding that a certificate of merit be awarded to
the originator of new horticultural products:
that a banner be presented to the county bring
ing the largest number of members to the next
meeting; that a special summer meeting be
arranged for, and that the next annual meeting
oe neia at lnoianapoiis. Ihe following resolu
tion concerning the State Library was adopted:
Whereas, Agriculture is the most important in
dustry of the State, of Indiana, and the material in
terest of the great majority of the people would be
much enhanced by having access to the standard
works on the various subjects connected therewith.

designed to furnish the people access to the best and

priation of only $IUU tor the purchase and binding

have not been purchased, agricultural serials have
not been subscribed for, and many books already ia
the library have been permitted to fall to pieces;
Resolved, That it is the duty of the Legislature to
make more liberal provision for the purchase and
binding of books for the future, and especially ought
tne Legislature to make an appropriation at its nest
session sumcient to remedy the worst exisiting de
fects of the library; and,
Kesolred, That with increasing- appropri&lions it
would be advisable to provide a purchasing board to
supervise the expenditures of this nature: and that n.

Legislature, of the Governor, State Superintendent of
Public Instruction and Librarian ex officio, with one
member to be appointed by the Supreme Court, and

Kesolved, farther, that a delegate from this so

Sylvester Johnson was appointed delegate in
accordance with this provision. A committee
composed of Messrs. Furnas, Johnson, Troop,

the various parts of the State in the interest of
the society during the coming year.
IT PLEASES-FREE-TRADERS.
Significant Comments on the Tariff Reform
Message of President Cleveland.
The President's message was being variously
commented upon yesterday by a party of
gentlemen, when Major John B. Glover, consul
to Havre under the last Republican administra
tion, said: "I was abroad during all of the
last campaign, and in no instance did I find an
Englishman or Frenchman who did not espouse
Cleveland's election. Many of them were with
ns on all other questions except that concerning
the tariff. No Democrats in this country could
have been more earnest in their support of
Cleveland. He was looked upon as the leader
f free trade under the euise of tariff reform.
They regarded that as one great step in the
direction of a policy that would redound
to the benefit of England and France. Going
from London to Liverpool, I was in a compart
ment with a wealthy and influential iron master
who - had traveled extensively in the United
States. He said no iron country can be de
veloped under free trade and come into com
petition with ' England. AVe can supply you
with manufactured articles,' he remarked, 'and
take in turn your grain: but if I was an
American I would bo on the side of protection.'
Yhen it was announced that Cleveland was
elected, the English and French were as Jubilant
almost as his adherents on this side.
''There is nothing new in the messace. Its
arguments for tariff reform are preciselv those
used by the free-trade Democrats since the
time Henry Clay was the great apostle of
protection. They tell the farmer, as they did
then, you can under tariff reform sell vour
wheat in Liverpool, buy your plows there and
pay freight both for what you sell and what
you buy. .
une uemocrats hero accept the messaee
without any desire to question its argu
ments as denning the position of their party
next year. One of them, of some prominence,
was so elated on his first readme:, as to sav:
"It is just the thing the partv needs. Since
Jackson's time we have not had an issue, but
the message means that we are to be placed
squarely on a platform of reduction in revenue.
I disclaim, though, that it points to free trade."
Another said: "I am a free-trader theoretic
ally, but I do not favor it as a political issue
just now. Reduction in revenue is sufficient for
the time being. After a while the opportunitv
will no doubt come when we can take squarely a
position in support of free trade. Protection is
popular because it is what every new country
needs. The present generation will see no
lessening of strength hi' that doctrine, but
I believe the people aro ready to aect-pt tariff
reform. It gives us something to fight for.
although it may not go as far as the extreme
freetraders desire." Altogether the message
is looked " upon as good enough Democratic
doctrine until the party thinks it can uncover
its ulterior purposes.
No Doubt of It.

The New Assessment of Property Reduces the

At the meeting of the Council Monday even
ing there came np the - periodical discussion on
the habit of passing minor propositions involv
ing expenditures without referring them to ap
propriate committees. Councilman Thai in an,
in objecting to this mode of procedure, said
that anything, no matter how small, contem
plating the use of the city's money should just
at this time be carefully considered, as the
municipal finances were not in the best possible
shape, and that there was great danger of a defi
cit at the end of the year. Very much of this kind
of talk was indulged in about this time last
winter, and yet the city came out $23,000 ahead.
During the last year there has been no increase
in the bonded indebtedness, and cannot be, for
that is now np to the statutory limit. But this
class of indebtedness created in flush times en
forced upon the city the payment of a high rate
of interest, averaging 7 per cent. It amounts
to $1,400,000, exclusive of the $500,000 in Belt
railroad bonds, and the yearly interest reaches
nearly $100,000. Some time ago it was thought
that the debt could be refunded before
maturity at 4 per cent., but the
Eastern holders of the bonds would not consent
to it They said they would hold out for the 6
and 7.3 ner cent, until the bonds matured, the
first series of which (the I. & V. and Junction
railroad bonds), for $110,000, at 6 per cent, is
due Jan. 1, 1889. Until that date the city can
do nothing towards refunding. In 1873 the
spirit of street and other publio improvements
was abroad, and caused the creation of a bonded
indebtedness of $600,000 at 7.3 percent, which
is the next series to reach maturity, Julyl,
1893. After this come the bonds for the pur
chase of the Sellers farm, at a like rate of interest.
They are due Jan. 1, 1894, and six months later
$300,000 at 7.3 per cent matures. In the year
followine $200,000 more will fall due at the
same rate of interest But in the mean time,
Jan. l. 1S94, the Garfield Park bonds, $109,000,
will have to be paid. Ihe Belt railroad, to per
cent bonds, do not mature until July 1, 1897.
There are several smaller issnes of long-time
bonds, on which high interest is being paid. All
- this indebtedness, except the Belt railroad
bonds, was created previous to Jnly 1, 1875. In
addition to this, the city is carrying a $100,000
temporary loan at 4 per cent., which was made
two years" arro, and has been continued from
time to time as it matured.
During the past year there has been no in
crease in expenses, but on the other hand two
items of importance have been dropped from
the list of expenditures the Tomlinson Hall
and market-house improvements. They have
been paid for and the revenues they drew on
have been applied to current purposes. Yet the
Council finance committee says that the reduc
tion in property valuation has offset this by de
priving the city treasury of $40,000 per year.
If the interest on the bonded indebtedness could
be reduced, the committee thinks everything
would be satisfactory for carrying the city
through without fear of deficit or imposing any
restrictive economy in making one important
department suffer at the expense of another. In
his way it is claimed that tne street improve
ment and repair funds have been made to bear
a sacrifice in order to keep up departments that
might have shared the burden of retrenchment.
In 1875 the street improvements and repairs cost
$lo5,000, but they have been gradually cut down
until the expenditures this year for these our-
poses will not amount to much more than
$30,000.
In his forthcoming message the Mayor will re
view very thoroughly the city's financial condi
tion, which, he says, could be materially im
proved if a vehicle tax was available. He will
make no recommendations but let the facts go
to the people for their own consideration and
judgment Ti'ith a taxable valuation which has
been decreased from 501,000.000, when the En
glish tax law was passed, to $47,000,000, it is the
opinion of some of the city's financiers that the
limit of taxation should be increased. Another
suggestion is that a hieh liquor license should be
created by the next Legislature, which would
give the city an additional yearly revenue of at
least $50,000 from that source.
T17E GAS TRUST'S CONTRACTS.
A Renter Would Not Sijrn Because Ilis Land
lord Refused to Pipe Mis House.
Canvassers for tho gas trji st's contracts with
consumers occasionally meet with persons who
decline to commit themselves
to the agreement
because they are renters. But
the canvassers
do not seem to regard this as objectionable, as
they assure the man they want for a consumer
that the landlords will pipe the houses "But
mine," said a renter yesterday to a canvasser,
"has told me he would do no such thing." He
did not sign the contract on that account. If
other landlords follow this policy there is
reason to believe that a few thousand families
will not be the beneficiaries from natural gas
for some time to come. Yet the trust people
say their contracts now number two thousand.
and that they meet with but little opposition in
getting persons to sign. Another feature of
this canvass was suggested by a conversation
that took place between a canvasser and a citi
zen yesterday. "Signing this contract." said
the former, "will not prevent you from taking
gas from the first company that is able to sup-
ply it" .
"That is wnat i intend to ao," replied the citi
zen, "but if I sign this contract I will have to
take it from the consumers' company when it is
ready. I ma v not want to chancre."
" ovl will change, though," retorted the can
vasser, "for you are in favor of the trust." The
citizen admitted that he was. but he declined to
sign. It is possible that those who have made
contracts with this company will have gas much
earlier than Sept 1, as the directors say their
position in that respect has been greatly im
proved. It is understood that the character of
the negotiations with the Broad Ripple company
is that it will supply gas to the trust's consum
ers, whom it can reach at once with its pipes
alter coming into tne city, lius will be done
on condition that if the flow proves what is
expected the trust will purchase hereafter the
Broad Kipple plant outright
Watching tlie Chicago Anarchists.
Chicago, Dec 8. Police captain Lewis, in
whose district most of the Anarchists live, said
in an interview to-day that he had private infor
mation to tne effect that the revolutionists are
highly incensed at the authorities for their in
terference with the proposed benefit to the fam
ilies of those who were executed. The police,
however, have a complete list of all the places
where they meet, and are watching these points
of rendezvous very closely. They have given
up the idea of mass-meetings, and when any
thing important demands their action they ad
journ to the residence of some one of their num
ber. Iheir real meetings are held only this way.

ural, quiet sleep by relieving the child from
pain, and the little cherub awakes as "bright as
a button." It. is very pleasant to taste. It
soothes the child, softens the gums, allays all
pain, relieves wind, regulates the bowels, and is
the best known remedy for diarrhoea, whether
arisine from teething or other causes. Twenty

WHY THEY Ml
The absolute purity of the Royal Baking Powder is a
fact not questioned by anyone; but the questions are fre
quently asked: Why do not other manufacturers, also, put
np pure baking powders, free from lime, alum, and other adul
terants? Is it a fact that the Royal is the only pure baking
powder made ?
There are three classes of these articles : Cream of tartar
baking powders, made from cream of tartar and bi-carbonate
of 'soda; phosphate baking powders, in which phosphatio acid
is used as a substitute for cream of tartar; and alum baking
powders, mado from burnt alum and soda.
Burnt alum baking powders are of the cheapest class.
They cost less than four cents a pound, are concededly poi
sonous, and because of their well-known inferiority are never
sold under their true colors. Baking powders sold with a
prize or gift are of this class.
The phosphate baking powders contain from 8 to 12 per
cent, of lime, which is an ingredient of the phosphate used in
them as a substitute for cream of tartar. It is impossible to
eradicate the lime from this class of powders. This baking
powder is next to the alum baking powders in cost.
The cream of tartar baking powders, to which class the
Royal belongs, to be pure must be made from absolutely pure
cream of tartar. , Tho Royal Baking Powder is made from
cream of tartar specially refined and prepared for its use by
patent processes by which the tartrate of lime is totally
eliminated. There is no other process by which cream of
tartar can be freed -from lime made 100 per cent, pure
in quantities practical for commercial purposes. Other
baking powder makers, hot being able to obtain these chem
ically puro goods (which are used exclusively in the Royal)
are dependent upon the cream of tartar of the market, refined
by the old-fashioned methods, for their supply, and by those
methods it is impossible to eliminate the lime and other im
purities. :
These are the reasons why the Royal is absolutely pure,
while all other baking powders contain either lime or alum.
The vital importance of absolute purity in the articles
we eat as promotive of perfect health is daily more generally
being considered. How large a share in producing impure
and unwholesome food the lime and alum baking powders
have had in the past, is becoming fully recognized.
The absolute purity of the Royal Baking Powder not
only renders it more perfectly wholesome, but its freedom from
all extraneous substances makes it of higher strength and
effectiveness as a leavening agent, and therefore more economi
cal for use. It is accordingly . certified by the U. S. Govern
ment Chemists as the most wholesome, effective, and perfect
baking powder made.
