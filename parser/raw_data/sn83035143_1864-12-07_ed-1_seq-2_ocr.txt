A Navy Yard at Cleveland.
Tbe bill 'introduced by Honv B.
Spauldlng into Congress, to establish
Navy yard for the lakes in this city, is one
of the most vital importance. There can
be no 'doubt whatever in the mind of any
man bat that out relations with England
are growing more and more delicate, and
that tha safety of our lake commerce and
th 9 large cities on their borders, demand
the establishment of a Havy Yard at some
point on the' lakes. Cleveland furnishes
the conditions necessary better than any
other city on the lakes. . Its coal, iron and
lumber interests, and the fact of its being
the lake depot of the great state of Ohio,
should commend tbe project of Mr. Spald
ing. .."We trust Ohio Congressmen, wili
give this measure their cordial support.
New York in a Ferment.
Tha enormous corruptions attending the
city government of Ksw York have crea
ted much alarm among the better class of
citizens of all parties, and they are casting
about in the almost vain hope of finding
some mode of escape from their trouble.
Wilktt Spirit of Vie Timet takes the bull
by the horns and calls upon the Legist
lure of Vee State to abolish the Municipal
Government of the City, and place its en
tire control in the hands of a Commission,
which .should - have complete- authority
over all departments and details of the
City Government. The proposition is vig-
oroasly attacked by tbe Pott and Commer
curfoach advocating that the- city is com
petent to govern itself. It certainly looks
very doubtful to outsiders". .' "
The Presidents Message.
Our paee this morning does not admit
f jm"extendsd comment. The Message is
au admirable summary of the most impor
tank features of our public affairs. The
recommendation made are vital to the
welfare of the country.' The President
gives no uncertain sound on the subjects of
Peace and Slavery. The President can
not go -back on the subject, of , slavery.
The message is the dawning of a new era
in our aftVns. 'The w7 is to goon and
Pesoe to be won. Our Financial relations
are in a prosperous condition, ' and confl
dence is felt in our resources.

INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH.
The proposed Overland Telegraph be

vorable circumstances by an association of
American cttizenn witn tne cordial good

most of the South American States of their
high appreciation of the enterprise, and
their readiness to co-operate in construct
ing lines tributary to that world-encircling
communication. ,
I learn with much satisfaction that the
noble design of a telegraphic communica

and Great Britain has been renewed with
a full expectation of its early accomplish

EGYPT.
Our very popular and estimable repre

unpleasant altercation which arose between
tbe temporary incumbent oi the omce and
tbe government of the Jfacna, resulted in
a suspension or intercourse, Tne evil was
promptly corrected on the arrival of the
successor in the consulate, and our rela

The rebellion which has so lone been

that provision- be made effectually

their criminal occupation in our country.
It is possible that if it were a new and

with the light they now enjoy tbey wouia
not concede the privileges of a naval bel

States, destitute as they are, and always

FBOTECTIOX 07 OUB CASADtAX B0BDKR.
In view of the insecurity of life in the
region adjacent to the Canadian border, by
the assaults and depredations committed
by inimical and desperate persons who are
harbored there, it has been th-ught proper
to give notice that, after the expiration of
six months, (the period conditionally stip
ulated in the existing arrangements wilh
Great Britain), the United States must
hold themselves at liberty to increase their
naval armament upon tha lakes, if they
shall find that proceeding necessary.
The condition of the border will neces
sarily come into consideration in connec
tion with the question of continuing .or
modifying the rights of transit from Can
ada through Ihe United States, as well as
tbe regulations of imports which were
temporarily established by the Beciprocity
Treaty of the 5ih of June, 184. I desire,
however, to be understood, while making
this statement, that, the Colonial authori
ties are not deemed to be intentionally un
just or unfriendly . toward the United
States, bnt on the coatrary, there is every
reason to expect that, with the approval
of the Imperial Government, they will
take the necessary measures to prevent
new incursions across tne border.
FOREIGN IMMIGRATION.
The act passed at the last session for the
encouragement of immigration has, as far
as was possible, been put into operation. It
seems to need an amendment which will
enable the officers of the government to
prevent the practice of frauds against the
immigrants while on their way and on
their arrival in the ports, so as to secure to
them here a Iree choice of avocation and
places of settlement. A liberal disposition
fest3 oy"most of the European States,
and ought to be reciprocated on our part
by giving the immigrants effective nation
al protection. I regard our immigrants as
one of the principal replenishing streams
whieh are appointed by Providence to re
pair the ravages of our Internal war and
its waste of national strength and wealth.
All that is necessary is to secure the flow ol
that stream in its present fullness, and to
that end the government must in every '
way make it manifest that it neither wish
es nor designs to impose involuntary mili
tary service upon those who come from
other lands to cast their lot in our coun-
...... v..
OUR FINANCES.
The financial affairs of the Government
have been successfully administered dur-
the past year. The legislation of the last
session of Congress has beneficially affect
ed tne revenue, annougn suutcient ttme
has not yet elapsed to experience the full
effect of several of the provisions of tbe
Acts of Congress imposing increased tax- j
ation. The receipts during the year from
all sources, upon the basis of warrants sign
ed Dy tne secretary or tne '.Treasury, in
cluding the loans and the balance in the
Treasury on the first day of July, eighteen
hundred and sixty-three, were $1,394,796 - j

upon the same basis, were $1,298,056,101.- i

as before stated. - For tha actual receipts
and disbursements for the first quarter and
the estimated receipts and disbursements
for the three remaining quarters of the cur
rent nscai year ana the general operations
of the Treasury in detail, I refer you to
the report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
I concur with him in the opinion that
tne proportion oi the monies required to
meet tbe expenses consequent upon tbe war
derived rrom taxation, should be still fur
ther increased, and I earnestly invite your
attention to this subject, to the end that
there may be such additional Legislation
as shall be required to meet the just ex
pectations oi tne secretary.
POPULAR LOANS.
The public debt on the first day of July
last, as appears by the books of the Treas
ury, amounted to one billion, seven hun
dred and forty thousand mixtions, six hun
dred and ninety thousand, four hundred
and eighty-nine , dollars and forty-nine
cents. Probably should the war continue
for another year, that amount may be in
creased, by not far from: five hundred mil
lions. Held as it is for the most part by
our own people, jt has become a substantial
branch of national, though private prop
erty. For obvious reasons, the more near
ly this property can be distributed among
all the people the better; to favor such
general distribution, greater inducements
to become owners, might perhaps, with
good effect and without injury, be present
ed to persona of limited means. With
this view I suggest whether it might not
be both expedient and competent for Con
gress to provide, that a limited amount of
some future issue of public securities might
be held by any bona fide purchase, exempt
from taxation and from seizure for debt,
under such restrictions and limitations as
mizht be necessary to guard against the
abuse 01 to important a privilege. iiia
would enable prudent persons to set aside
a small annuity against a posiM4ay-of
want. m
i Privileges like these would render tne
possession or such securities w mo
amount limited, most aesirauio ij ponviij
of small means, who might be able-to av
enough for the purpose. Ti -?aaiAQW

NATIONAL BANKS.
The National Banking system is prov
iatt to be acceptable to capitalists and to
the people. On the 15'.h of November
five hundred and eighty-four- National
Banks had beea organized, a considerable
number of which were conversions Irom
State Banks. Changes from the State sys
tem to the National system, are rapidly
taking place, and it is hoped, that vary
soon, there win do in tne L nitea otate,
no bank of raue not unauthorized by Con
gress, and no bank note circulation not
secured by the Government. - That the
Government and the people will denye
feneral benefit from this change in tbe
anking system, can scarcely be question

THE INDIAN SYSTEM.
, It was recommended in my last Annual
Message, that our Indian Eystem bo re
medied. Congress, at its last session,
acting upon the recommendation, did pro
vide fcrre-organiaing the system in Cali
fornia, and it. is believed that under the
present organisation tha management of
the Indians there will be attendod with
reasonable success. 'Much yet remains to
be done to provide for the proper govern
ment: of the Indians in other parts of the
country, to render it secure for the advanc
ing eeltier, and to provide for the welfare
of tbe Indian. The secretary reiterates
his Recommendations, and to them tho at-

" THE WAR AVTI.jjj-"-"-'' ---'-AJ.-i-..
Tha war has continued since the last an
nual message. All the important lines and
positions then occupied by our forces have
lein maintained, and our armies have
steadily advanced, thus liberating tho ne
groes left in the rear, so that Missouri.
h-Mituoley, tb 00000, ftuu parts of other
States, have again produced reasonably
iair crops.
The most remarkable feature In tbe mil
itary operations of the year is General
Sherman s attempted march of threo hun
dred miles directly through the enemv'i
region. It tends to show a great increase
01 our relative Btrengtn that our lienem-in-Chief

much in the right direction, that 12,000

THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY BY CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENT.
At the last session of Congress, a pro
posed amendment of the Constitution",
soonsning slavery throughout tbe United
Mates, passed the Senate, but failed, for
lack of the requisite two-thirds vote, in the
House of Representatives. Although the
Jjresent it tie same" Congress, and nearly
ue same members, without questioning the
wuhiuxil uc VMnuuuu 01 tnoee woo sut-vl
id opposition, I .venture to recommend the
Mconsideratiou and passage ot the mea
sure at the present session. Of course, the
abstract question is not changed, but an
Intervening eleolioa shows almost certainly

m " wwkiwo win lojjh .fie in Hi-
a question of time at to when the proposed
amendment will go to the States for their
aeuon-and as it ia to so go, at all events,
may we tot. agree that the sooner the bet-
tar ! It. is not claimed that the election
has imposed a duty on members to change

THE LESSON OF THE RECENT ELECTIONS.
The most reliable indication rf
or public purpose in this country, is de
rived through our popular elections. -
judging by tbe recent canvass and its
result, the purpose of the oeonla within
the loyaT States to maintain the Integrity
or-ine -xmioa was never more nrm nor
more nearly unanimous than now. - The
extraordinary calmness and good order
with which the millions ef voters met anrl
mino-lfl at the polls gave strong asanv-r.nwi
of tfiif, - Hot only all those who supported
the Union ticket, so-called, but a great ma
jority of the opposing party also, may be
iairiy ciaimeu w entertain ana to be actu
ated by the same purpose. It is an un
answerable argument (9 this effect that
no oandidate for any office whatever, high
or low, has ventured to seek votes on the
avowal that he was jbr giving up the
Union. - -' l " i
There has been much imisunsriogiof rucw
tives and much boated entroversy-ato
the proper means and the best mode of ad
vancing the union cause, but in tha dis
tinct issue of Union or No Union the poli
ticians have shown their instinctive know
ledge that there is no diversity amoag the
people. . In awarding tha peopisr ita lair
opportunity of showing one to another
and to tha world this firmness ana unani
mity of purpose the election "hasbeea 'of
vast value to the iNavumal -easie. y xne

valuable to be known, the- fact that we dot

To this arain should be added the number
of all soldiers in the field from Massachu
setts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware,
Indiana, Illinois and California, who by
the law of those States could not tote
away from their homes, and which number
cannot be less than 90,000. Nor yet Is this
all. The number in organized Territories
is a trifle more now than what it was four
years ago, while thousands of white and
black, join us at the nationalarmsand press
back the insurgent lines. So much is shown
aflirraatively and nezntively, by the elect
tion. It is not material to enquire how the
increase has been produced or to show that
it would have been greater but for the
war. which is probably true.
Tbe important fact remains demonstrat
ed, that we have more men now than we
had when the war began. That -we are
not exhausted nor in process of exhaustion.
That we are gaining strength, and may, if
need be. maintain the contest indefinitely..
This as to men. Material and resources are
now more complete and abundant than
over. Tho nwiot.i oqnnrooa than are un-
hansted. a"d as we belieye, inexhaustabl.

to ma that no attempt at negotiation with
the insurgents loader could result in any
good. He would accept of nothing short
of the severance of the Union. His declar
ations to that effect are explicit and oft re
pealed. He does not attempt to deceive
m. ue anjras us no excuse to ; deceive
ourselves. We cannot voluntarily yield
u. netwoen mm ana us tne issue - is dis
tinct, simple and inflexible. . It is an issue
which can be tried only by war. and. de
cided only by victory. Ii we yield we are
beaten. If the Southern people fail him
he is beaten: either ways it would be the
victory and defeat following, war.. What
is true, however, of him who heads tha
insurgent cause, is not necessarily true of
those who - follow. 'Although 'he cannot
accept the Uunion, thay can ; some of them.
we know, already . desire peace and-: re
union. The number of such may increase.
HOW PEACE CAN BE OBTAINED.
They can at any moment have peace, sim
ply by laying down their arms and submit
ting to tbe national authority under the
constitution. Alter so mucn, tne Uovern
ment could not, if it would, maintain war
against tnem. The loyal people would
not sustain or allow it. If questions should
remain, we would adiust them bv tha
peacoful moans of legislation, conference,
courts and voters, operating only in
constitutional and lawful channel, soma
certain ana otner possible questions, and
won u be beyona toe r.xecutive power to ad
just. Forinstance,theadmIssionof members
into Congresi, or whatever might-require
the appropriation of money. : Too Execu
tive power itself would be greatly dlmia-
lsbsd by the cessation or actual war. Par
dons and and remissions of forfeitures.
however, would still be within executive
control. In what spirit and temper this
control would be exercised can be fairly
ju lgea oi by tne past, a year ago. gen
eral pardon and amnesty upon designated
terms were offered to all except certain
designated classes, and it was at the same
time made known that tha axaentad class
es were still within the contemplation, of
ojivciai neuiuuuy.
J'uring the year many availed them
selves of the general provision- and many
more would only that tha signs of bad laitk
in some led to such precautionary
as rendered the practical process less easy
and certain, during the same time also,
special pardons have bean granted to indi
viduals oi excaptea Classes, ami to vomn-
tarj' application i las been . denied.
Thus, practicajly, the door has been, for a
full year opi nt to all except such as were
not In condition to make free choice: that
is, such as were fft'efetody or under con
straint. It is still opea-to all, but the time
mvy come, probably will come, when pub
lic uuty tuau aemana tnat it De dosed.
and that, in lieu, more vigorous measures
than heretofore shall be adopted.

NO STEP BACKWARD ON THE QUESTION OF
SLAVERY.
tn presenting the abandonment of armed
resistance to the National '-authority
on the part of tha insurgents as tha only
indispensable condition to ending tha war
on tho part of tbe Goveanment. I retract
nothing heretofore said as to slavery. I
repoat the declaration made a year ago,
and that while I remain in my pretest po
sition I shall not attempt to retractor
modify the emancipation proclamation.
nor snau i return to slavery any person
who is free by the terms of that proclama
tion or by any of the acts of Congress.
Ai tne people snoum, py whatever mod
or means, make it an executive duty to
re-enslave such persons, another and not I
must ue tueir instrument to penorm.it.
In stating a single condition of peace, I
mean simply to say that the war will cease
on the part of the Government, whenever
it shall have ceased on the part of those
who began it. ' ' '. '
