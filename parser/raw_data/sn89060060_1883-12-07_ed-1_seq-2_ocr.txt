PORT TOBACCO:
Friday Morniner, December 7 1883.
The Democrats in Congress have skill-,
fully steered clear of ihe Scylla which
threatened the good old ship in the candi
dacy of Mr. Randall.
It will be a source of regret and cha
grin to the Mary'and Democracy to learn
that not one of its alleged representative
on the floor of the House voted for Mr-
Carlisle for Speaker, the four of them who
were present recording their votes for Ran
dall and high tariff.

O' Donnell the slayer of Carey the in
former, has been found guilty of murder
by an English jury and sentenced to be
hung on the 19th of the present month. 1
He was defiant when the verdict was an
nounce and loudly denounced the British
government as he was being led back to
prison.
One of the most absorbing matters that
will come before the Legislature during
the approaching session will be the elec-1
tion of a United States Senator to succeed
the Hob. James B. Groome. This office
belongs to the Eastern Shore, and that sec- j
tion is furnishing numerous applicants for
the position. Queen Anne's county has
three gentlemen in the field, viz : Judge
John M. Robinson, Cemptroller Thomas J
Keating'and John B. Brown, Esq. The
other candidates are Hon. James B.Groome.
of Cecil, present incumbent; Hon. Philip
F. Thomas, of Talbot, and Hon E K. Wil- 1
son, of Worcester, making six in all. The
1 >wer counties of tne peninsula are said to
be united upon Mr. Wilson, while Cecil
and one vote from Kent will be for Groome-
On last Sunday evening, shortly before
8 o’clock, some vandal or vandals, not
having the fear of the Lord before their
eyes, wickedly cut off the tails of the two
lions cut in sandstone which ornament the
entrances"to the Calvert street bridge in
Raltimoie city. The good people of that
city, and especially the mayor who former
y selected the ornaments in quest ion,were
Very much enraged when they saw the two
bob-tailed lions standing in grim silence
on Monday morning. It has been sugges
ted by some that the daring deed was the
work of some misguided son of Erin, who
fancied that in amputating the caudal ap
pendages of those sandstone lions he was
casting an insult upon the mythical “Brit
ish lion,” while others ridicule the idea as
absurd. Mayor Latrobe has offered a re
ward for the offender or offenders. :.nd the
probability seems to be that the bod-tail
ed lions will be amply avenged.
Butler and Bldne, w-hilora antagonists,
are at it again. Blaine’s high tariff pro
clivities have evolved from his conscious
ness a novel plan to keep up the tariff a
way beyond what is needed for the sup
port of the government. His idea is to
continue the tax on whiskey and tobacco
but to have the proceeds returned to the
different S ates lor use in paying their
own expenses. This would have the effect
of diminishing the treasury revAue, and
*rgh tariff ~n imports, and that
is what Blaine is driving at. Butler’s ans- :
wer is characteristic:
“1 know of no warrant in the Constitution
for taxing a man who produces a hlade of to
bacco any more than a man who produces a
blade of grass, nor for a tax on a bushel of corn
made into whiskey any more than a bushel of
corn made in meal. There is a difference in
sentiment about whiskey and tobacco, but no
differenca in constitutional lax, sofaras 1 know.
A man has as much constitutional right to
make whiskey free of taxation as he has to make
bread or to make tobacco free of taxation, or to
make cotton cloth free of taxation. I have al
ways looked upon the lax upon whiskey and
tobacco as a great injustic to the States that
produce those articles; not that they may not
ultimately get the taxes back after their produce
Ss sold, but for the effect upon the producer.
We tax Virginia upon her great products, from
w hich alone she can realize money, up to the
collection point, leaving her nothing to tax
upon her State industry, and then we complain
of her because she doesn’t pay her own debts.
Well, Mr. Blaine proposes to keep that tax on,
and pay other people’s debts with it. In my
judgment, if anything would justify rebellion,
that would.”
The Forty-Eight Congress which met
on Monday lasf, organized by selecting
Hon. John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, to the
speaker’s, chair and will proceed to trans
act the business of a session which, from
the number of pressing issues to be brought
before it, is likely to be of unusual inter
est. The Senate consists of 38 republi
cans, 36 democrats, and two readjusters
who will vote with the republicans. The
House, of which the membership was in
creased by the last apportionment from
293 to 325, will stand : Democrats, 194, re
publicans, 118; readjusters, 5; indepen
dents, 4; grecnbackers, 2; vacancies, 2. —
The number of votes constituting a major
ity of the Hou e is 103, but the democrat
ic majority over all is 63. The distribu
tion of the democratic strength, which is
greatest in the West and South, is in ac
cord with the fact brought out by the cen
sus of 1880 that the centre of population
and power to the Union is west of the
Alleghanies and is moving to the South
west. The preponderating influence, for
merly wielded by the Eastern, Middle and
South Atlantic States, belongs now to the
Mississippi valley, and the control of the
democratic party—the shaping of its pol
policy and the naming of its presidential
candidates —follows the centre of popu
lation. Of the 194 democratic memb.rs
of the 48th Congress the Eastern States
send but 6, the M iddle States 37, the South
Atlantic States, including in that group
Maryland and Virginia 31; the Gulf States,
29: the Central, Western and Northwest
ern States, 75; the Pacific States, 7. Ex
cluding Florida from the number of Gulf
States, it will be found that of the 194
votes cast by democrats in the Congress
which met last Monday, at least 104 are
cast by representatives of the Central,
Western, Northwestern and Gulf States,
all of which lie for the most part west of
the Alleghany mountains, and if the 7
votes of the Pacific States be added the
total is increased to 111. It is not sur
prising, therefore, that the sceptre has de
parted from “the orighinal thirteen” States,
be the party in power democratic or re
publican. Nor is the transference of pow
er to the new States of the great West al
together to be regretted by the patriot who
would wish to see the policy of the gov
ernment dominated by the large and broad
considerations inevitably brought to the
front when the area from which the party
majority is taken is of wide extent and
fairly homogeneous in character. The
composition of the present House would
seem, therefore, to indicate that national
problems are to be treated during the ses
sion in a practical and national spirit.—

Slight Misstatement
We do not intend at all to reitera’e that
the Maryland Independent is the organ of
i that unique political association called
■ the republican or “inpublican” party of
i Charles county, because the Maryland In
dependent, after severely chiding us lor
our previous intimation to that effect, has
j virtuous’y pro claimed for itsell that is ‘is
not ’he organ of any man, corporation or
political party, nor the apologist for any
body's misdeeds.” We have pretty relia
ble information that the Maryland Inde
pendent is the property of four of the chief
stock-holders, directors and office-holders
of the aforesaid political association or
corporation, and this, we believe, our vir
tuous and independent neighbor does not
deny. We readily sec. however, now that
our neighbor has enlightened us. that we
; were entirely wrong in assuming that these
office holders had purchased the Maryland
Independent for the purpose of making it
their organ or the apologist for their own
or anybody else's misdeeds Of course uot.
They only had a disinterested wish to en
ter the lucrative and delightful field of
journalism, and a philanthropic desire to
establish a paper which would be at all
times ready to expose official corruption
and pecu’ation; a journal that would be
always rea ly to probe to the very bottom
| of official irregularities and lay bare the
pecula'ions, if any should happen, of the
inpublican party of Charles county.
Had it not been for this information
thus derived, we fear we should have in
dulged in ano’her of our “wild charges"
with regard to our neighbor’s report of the
j trial of the county commissioners, which
appeared in its last issue. We might, in
our impetuosity, have so fir forgot’en our
selves when we read our neighbor's state
ment that -'the evidence showed (hat the state
j ments published in the county papers in 1882
and 1883 t cere of the same scope and particu
larity as all previous statements except that in
1870, when Capt. Page had charge of the
roads''ns to have suggesed that it was
the “apologist for somebody's misdeeds’’
and thus have subjected ourselves to a
“suit for libel and slander.” But. f -rtu
nately for ns, we did not go so far.
We would like, however, meekly to say
that the evidence in the case did not prove
any such facts, or even tend to do so; and
! could not possibly have proved them, for
they are not facts. The only evidence
tending to es’ablish a precedent for the
I action of the commissioners was withre
| gard to the road fund alone, and was intro
iduced by Mr. Mitchell of counsel for de
fense, who offered the levy book of 1866 to
'show that the sum of $6,000 for roads had
then been levied in a lea nee. He did not
fol'ow it up by exhibiting the statement
of 1867 and showing that the money was
not then accounted for, and. therefore, the
evidence was totally irrevalont and had no
probative force whatever. The prosecu
tion offered, however, to exhibit the state
men’s of 1868 anil 1870. and show thereby
that the sums previously levied for roads
had been accounted for in detail, but the
court said it was unnecessary.
We regret that, owing to the fact ilia’
a number of the files o< this piper have
been taken out of the office by a previous
management and not yet returned, that we
j are' unab’e to trace the prac’ices of the
! boards of commissioners relative to their
annual statemen's from 1860, when the law
first went into force, up to 1872. when the
negroes and their managers assumed con
trol of the county affairs. The only two
statements of that period we have been
able thus far to get our hands on are those ,
of 1868 and 1870. B-dh of those statement*
are in compliance with the law
No objection lias ever been raised to the
exercise of the power of levying money in
advance, by estimate, for some contempla
ted work, because that power is expressly
; conferred by law; but that is a power
which ought not to be exercised except
when abso'ute y necessary, and then, of s
course, the expenditure of the money must
be afterwards accounted lor
In former limes nearly all the expenses
of the county were first incurred and after
wards a levy was made to the use of the
parties to whom the county was indebted
to be paid to them by the collectors.—
Then the publication of this levy was obvi
ously a substantial compliance with the
law requiring a detailed statement of the
county expenses. It was, of course, not
necessary, as the Mary'and Independent
contends, to make a subsequent statement
showing that these sums so levied had ac
tually been paid over, it being presumable
that, if they were not, the creditors would
be heard from The road fund in those
days was about the only sura levied in ad
| vance by estimate, and this, as far as we
can sec from the two statemcn s we have
referred to, was subsequently accounted
for. The pay of jurors was always levied
to the use of the individual jurors in the
collectors books, and accounted for in de
tail, until within the last two years, when
the new regime began to put negroes on
the juries, and, in order to provide for
them, made the per diem of jurors payable
in cash. For this purpose the salary of
the clerk of the county commissioners is
raised from $250 to SBOO a year, the coun
ty has been saddled wi h a debt of $5,000,
i and the sum of $3,000 is annually levied
, in advance and no account given of it.—
; The payments for “insane paupers” were
| also itemized in former statements, and the
amount paid to each hospital shown ; but
i in 1882 and 1883 tbe commissioners have
r levied the sum o r $2,000 in round numbers
for insane paupers while it seems that on
r ly $1,250 was paid for that purpose.
From this it will appear that our neigh
i bor is not entirely accurate when it says
1 that “the evidence showed that the state
ments published in the county papers in
• 1882 and 1883 were of the same scope and
particularly as all previous s atcments,ex
! cept that in 1870;” and that, abhough it
“ihe apologist for anybody’s mis
deeds,” its statements in this regard must
be taken cum gram salo.
The high tariff for marriage licenses in
our State continues to drive economical
lovers to Washington where the license is
placed at less than a hundred cents. Six
of such licenses were issued to Maryland
ers on Saturday. Even with such a tariff,
however, our matrimonial market is “fair
| ly brisk.”
Mrs. Eliza Villarcb, 333 Chase street, Balti
more, Md., says: "1 used Brown’s Iron Bit
ters for malarial fever and it did me much
good.”
The President's Message.
The annual message of President Arthur
was read in both houses ol Congress on
Tuesday. Without revealing any effort to
be brilliant or statesman ike, the message
is practical and business-like throughout
and expresses in clear language the views
of the Executive upon the various ques
tions of public concern of present interest i
to Congress or needing legislation during
the present session. The President reviews
our foreign relations, which he reports to
be amicable and peaceful. After referring
to some commercial matters of minor im
portance, ihe President refers to the ques
tion of revenue reform. He does not ad
vise any further material reduction of the
revenues at present. Congress is remind
ed that a tarifl' bill has been recently pass
ed, the results of which are not yet suffi
ciently apparent to warrant a further mod
ification of the tariff or internal revenue
laws. He states, however, that the legis
lation referred to has cut down the income
of the government some fifiv or sixty mil
lions of dollars —a sta'ement at variance
with that made by the Secretary of the
Treasury, who puts the net reduction at
but $30,000,000. The surplus of revenue
over expenditure, which the President es
timates a' $60,000,000, it is recommended |
should be spent in rehabilitating our navy |
and providing coast defenses. The sug
of the Secretary of the Treasury as I
to the proper method ot perpetuating the i
national bank system is approved. Itisj
accordingly recommend d that the ’ax ol
I per cent, on the ctrcula ion of the nation
al banks be repealed, and that the amount
of the circulation allowed on bonds depos
ited for security be increased to 90 per
cent, on tbe market value ot such bonds
The effect of this would be to make it pro
fitable to the banks to base their circula
tion on tour per cents, which are not re
deemable til! 1907. With respect to the
disposition to be made of trade dollars 'be
President and Secretary of the Treasury.
, while not favoring exactly the same plan
are in substantb 1 agreement. The former
recommends that the trade dollar be ac
cepted by the treasury and die mints us
bullion at a small percentage above tbe
cunent market price of silver ol like fine
ness. The Secretary suggests simply that
the standard silver dollar be exchanged,
■ dollar for doTtr, for the trade dollar, the
latter to be regarded as so much bullion
bought under the act of 1878 Approval
is given also the Secretary of the Treasures
plan for the consolid ilion of certain cus
toms districts, and it is added tha' by tbe
reduction ol internal revenue districts, re
cent y perfect’d, their number has l*een
reduced from 126 to 83 Dwelling on the
unprotected condition of our extended
seacoast, the number of Urge and weal hy
cities with which it is dotted, the age and
weakness of our works of defense, their
inferior armament and imperfect torpedo
equipment, the President urges the recon
struction *f out navy and the building of
| p’ant for the manufacture of heavy ord
nance. and points to the overt! >wing con
dition of the treasury as a fact that ren
ders the present the proper time for the
inception of so patriotic a work
Attention is cal ed to the growth f tire
numlrer of postolfice* from 4*5.231 in fss->
47.863 in 1883. The recommend ition i
made, adversely to the views of the Post
master General, that the rate <•( p*s age
on drop letters, which at present is two
cents where the carrier sys ent is establish
ed and one cent elsewhere, le made uni
form by reducing it everywhere to one
,cenf. Reference is made to the long moot
ed proposition that the government should
assume the same control over the telegraph
that it has always exercised over he mail,
but the President is unable to accord his
approval to the project Toe suggestion
is made, however, that the government
should be authorized t • exercise some >rt
of supervision over interstate telegraphic
j communication. Congress is invited to
consider the important question whether
Federal aid may no’ with propriety l>e ex
tended to public primary education in
parts ol the country where the percentage
of {’literacy is high. The fai urc of the
anti-po'ygamy legislation of March, 18.82,
is ci'ed, and the strong recommendation is
made that Congress repeal the act upon
which the existing government of Utah
depends, assume control ol the Territory,
and cstab ish in authority a commi sion
wi'h powers filing it to ileal effectively
with the Mormon prob'em. The ques'ion
lof regu’ating interstate commerce is pre
■ seated for consideration. The right of
1 railway corporations to reasonable profits
s i is conceded, but Congress should protect
! the peop'e from injustice. The effects of
■ 1 the civil-rights act in the sh >rt time dur
; j ing which it has been in operation are pro
-1 j nounced beneficial The act passed by the
I Senate at the lust session regulating the
■ ! presidential succession is recommended to
■ j the favorable consideration of the present
i i Congeess It is asked that the Executive l>c
i; empowered to veto particular items of an
appropriation bill without impairing the
t : validity of other items which meet his ap
1J proval. In concluding, the President re-
I I commends the passge of a new civil rights
■ bill guaranteeing to the colored citizen the
, I rights secured to him by the fourteenth
1 1 amendment.
, The Democratic party of the country
may well congratulate i sell upon the hap
py manner in which its representatives in
Congress have steered clear of tbe dangers
which beset them in the selection of a
Speaker of the present House of Represen
tatives. The election of the Hon John G
Carlisle, a true and undisguised exponent
of the great economic principles of the
1 , pary, to the responsible and influential
position of Speaker will meet with warm
approval from all true Democrats. It is
| especially gratifying just at this time,when
the whole country is looking to the Dcm
i ocratic party as the agency to reform the
abuses which have accumulated in the
Federal government in the past quarter of
! a cen'ury, and reinstate the government
upon proper principles of political econo
my, to see that party so unequivocally set-
I ting its condemnation upon the non-com
mittal, lack-of-principle, nll-for-expedien
cy policy wheih has in late years excited
i the ridicule of its opponents and the dis
j of i s most sincere adherents, and planting
! itself so firmly upon the great economic
principles which give vigor and vitality
to its political doctrines.
The attention of the country had been
concentrated upon the selection of Speak
er of the present House by t lie Democratic*
majority, as clearly foreshadowing the at
titude it would assume upon those prin
cip'es of revenue reform which have in re
cent years fmnd recognition only in its
1 pla'if ml i nous “pi it forms.” The selection
| of Mr. Randall would have unmistakably
and irrevocably commifed the party to the
same do nothing policy tUkit has charac- i
■ terizeil its action in ihe recent past Con- •
| stress, t The selcc ion of Mr. Carlisle by
| the overwhelming majorby he received,
for Mr Cox’s vote may be accredited to'
the tariff reform sentiment, p'aces the par.
ty c'early and unequivocally before the
country as the open and earnest exponent
ot the great principles of tariff reform, and
w 11 do much to revive and increase pub
lic confidence in its capacity to govern the
country.
The Democratic party stands today as
i political organization upon thehiglnst
plain of political integrity and statesman
ship and cannot fail to command the ap
proval of the country. Ity the passage of
the civil-service-retorm bill i i the last
Congress, just upon the eve of its prospec
live advent to power, it effectually placed
beneath its feet the impu'ation of being a
party of spoils, and now that it has so gal
lantly taken its stand upon its former broad
| and time-honored platform as the friend
of the people and foe of monopolies, the
i true gr ndeur oi its principles will over
shadow all sectional animosities and ill
| feeling, and if it make, ns i promises to
I make, a consistent record in the present
I Congress upon its tariff reform principles
the battle of will already have been
j fought and won

THE SUX.
NEW YORK, 1884
About sixty million copies of The Sun have
gone out of our establishment during the past
, ; twelve months.
If you were to paste end to end all the col
umns of all The Sun printed and sold last vear
i \on would get a continuous strip of interesting
' inform 11ion. common sense wisdom, sound
doctrine, and sine wit long enough to reach
from Printing House square to the top of
Mount Copernicus in the moon, then back to
1 Printing House square, and then three-quarters
of the wav ba* k to the moon again.
But The Sun is \v.itten for the inhabitants
of tlie earth; this same strip of intelligence
would girdle the globe twenty seven or twenty
eight times.
If every buyer of a copy of The Sun during
the past year lias spent only one hour over it,
and if irs wife oi bis grandfather his spent
another hour, this newspaper in 1883 has af
forded the human race thirteen tliousmd years
of steady reading, nieht and day.
It is only by little calculations like that vou
cm form any idea ot the circulation of the most
popular of American newspapers, or of its in
Huenee on the opinions and actions of Anieri
can men and women.
The Sun is, and will continue to be, a news
paper whbh lellsthe tnilh without fear of con
sequences, which gets at the facts no matter
how much the process costs, which presents the
news of all the world without waste of words
and in the most readable sh .pe, which is work
ing w ith all its heart for the cause of honest
government, and which th >refore believes that
the Republican party must go, and must go in
this coining year of our Lord, 1884.
If you know The Sun you like it already,
and you will reid it with accustomed diligence
and profit during what is sure to be the most
interesting year in its history. If you do not
vet k ow The Sun, it is high time to get into
the sunshine.
