An educated and a cultivated man.
who has -pout bis life among men and

An honest, experienced, able man of

liio.i as tho.x are and not as the dan

seem to the lltnrtlnsr lenses of Idea

A man who knows finance, railroads

not from "bookish thetriek.'
A man who knows men better than

ripened by experience and whose tint
lias taken an exquisite sensibility; keen,
it seeker of results and not of prettlness
of speech : who follows the facts, and
not the nlry visions of n sublimated

Tho Hrltlsh Naval Victory In the
.South Atlantic.
The destruction of Admiral yon
SrrE'H squadron, which sank the Ilrlt
lsb cruisers Good IIoio and Monmouth
In the Pacific n month ago, was so elab
orately planned by the Hrltlsh Ailml
rally with Its great resources in fast
and powerful cruisers that It Is sur
prising the result was not announced
sooner. The German Admiral had .0
tnke his chance of lighting an Anglo
Japanese squadron In the Pacific or a
Hrltlsh squadron In the Atlantic with
the probability that whatever his de
cision was the two cruisers. Schara
liofst and Gnelsenau, which constituted
his first line of b.iltle. would bo 'u
ferior lu gun range to the enemy Ap
p'ireiilly of the belief tli.it he had more
10 fear from the gun calibre and s e,r
of .lnp.i ies,. warships, which might he
appiv o il. i III force, lie elected to py
i-oiiclii-i ins with ilie Hrltlsh In the Al
iunde, no doubt hoping that be won d
li:'e Hie goo! luck to duplicate his !o
lory over Sir Ciiiiihiuriii.il Ciiaikk n't,

It will probably appear presently that
Sir I'm in Kit k SrniiiiL. the llntlsh Ad
iiilr.il. In liiklir.' his ships to Ihe Falk
land Islands, which are some foo miles
to the east of southern Patagonia, out
witted the Germans, who may have eon.
eluded from their wireless inlelllgenco
that the coast was clear. The Hrltlsh
Admiral seems to have been well
scried i It could have been by no meie
(bailee thnt lie learned the German il,t
could be Intercepted. His squadron
must have contained several ships wlt'i
mam b.ittcr,tM superior to those of the
Scharnhorst anil Onelsennn, for we know
that the gunnery of the Germans In the
battle off Corouel wnu excellent. In
the South Atlantic fight they must have
been outranged, nnd thp result of tho
encounter, after the bitter lesson the
Ilrltlsb Admiralty had learned, could
not be In doubt.
A glance at the table of losses In the
war by both the German and ItrltKli
navies will show that, with the excep
tion of the Audacious, not n single Hue
of battle ship on either side lias been
lost or put out of action, If Germany
cured to put the fate of her navy to th,i
touch lu the North Sea by n fleet en
gagement she would be as strong In
dreadnoughts and battle cruisers as
when the war began. At the same time,
It must he considered that the fight li
the South Atlantic has cost her two of
her most powerful second class cruis
ers, a typo of vessel In which she was
weak, and that her sea power In Amer
ican and Asiatic waters has almost
ceased to eilst.
A Commission for Kveryllilng,
Secretary I.ank of the Interior Pe
partment wants to have Alaska and ill
Its business affairs taken In charge by
ii Government commission of Presiden
tial appointees. Why not?
President Wilson observed In bis an
nual message the other day thnt "the
people of the t'nlted States do not wish
to curtail the activities of tills Govern
ment: they wish, rather, to enlarge
them." The possibilities of enlarge
ment through governmental commissions
are nil but Intlnlte.
Conspicuously we have already the
Interstate Commerce Commission of
long standing; the new hanking com
mission called the 1-Yiloral Iiesorvo
Hoard; the new Federal Trade Com
mission and the pseudo-commissions
which are running th postal saving
banks, the Government express enter
prise known as the parcel post service,
and tho Government marine Insurance
venture. At tho moment there Is only
specifically In prospect a Government
shipping board to regulate the ocean
freights of the world through a Gov-
eminent merchant fleet; so there seems
to be room for Secretary I.a.nk's Idea
about Territorial administration.
Why have any more self-government
for anything or anybody? Put every
thing and everybody In commission, no
matter how government by commission
works ns Illustrated In the plight of th!
railroads.
There Is No Kxotise for a Rear
Knd Collision.
There is no excuse for a rear end
collision like the smash-up which
killed two men n ml Injured two score
more ou the west side elevated railroad
Wednesday evening. It may be ex
plained, Its causes may be exactly s
tabllshed. the Individual or Individuals
re.sHinsIbk' may be disclosed ; but a rear
end colllslou Is beyond the possibility
of excuse.
More alarming than the presence In
the railroad's service of wooden cars
Is the revelation o Its line's non-equlp.

following trains from running Into

are practicable. They are. in use In

road and the public authorities charged
with Its supervision for neglect and
corn-lets them of Indifference.

Alroiiilv tho ilftminnlfittnti of nil who !in
Intimately or remotely ablated with i
the conduct of the road has made satis-1
factory progress, lint the principal
thing to bear In mind Is that there Is
no excuse for a rear end collision.
Complementing Senator llltcli
coi'U's .Scheme,
If Senator Hitchcock's plan to pro
hibit the sale of arms and ammunition
by Americans to belligerents for us.
against nations with which the United
States Is at peace Is designed to moid a
temporary emergency. It Is unnecessary,
for the F.xecutlve iJepartment already
has ample jwwer to deal with nil such
transactions.
If It is based on a sound conception
of the duties of neutrals, it Is Inconi
plete. for If the sale of such munitions ,
.s wioiig. I " 1'uini'isi.im, ..e ...e.uo,
cannot be right.
'Ilierefore, this measure should I
abandoned, or else it should be amended
by the addition of a prohibition agalus
the purchase by the United States, dur
ing the existence of a war In which It
engages, of arms and ammunition from
the dealers In a neutral State.
The United States cannot apply one
rule to other notions and conduct Its j
own affairs necordliig to another.
This Nation's Inadequate mid
I'nilcrcqiiippcil .riii.
Secretary Gaukison's report leaves
no room for doubt. If any existed be-
fore, that the United Stales army.
however eflUMent tlie rank and file ui.iy
be. Is Inadequate In organized strength
for national defence. That has been
the contention of those conccrni'il for
tho secinlty of the country who h.ivo
bei'ii ca'.lr'd alarmlstM by i'oniil.icciit
paclflclsis. When It coiiicm to Held and
siege nitlllory and nrtlllery iiiiiiuiuil
lloii, whl( b win modern buttles, the
secieini'.v of War says that wc lmvo
iio hlng like a siiiili'lent supply for 1111
I'liiergcucy, .Hid be inids;
"This has been urgently presented In
all of the leeent If ports of the head of ,
this Depattiueut and tho Chiefs of Staff,
and Congress has. fiotn time to tlmo re
cently, Incieined the npptoprlatlons for
these purpores."
That Ii to say, Congress has drib
bled out approprlitlous, refusing to
take the recoiiiniiiidiillons of the Wir
Hepiirtiiient and the army chiefs with
the gravity duo thtiii, ITcparcducs.s
to Congress has meant ilemnnd.s for
minify which would have 10 be d.
erted from the construction of public
buildings nnd from other Improve
ments that were regarded ns of more
ImiHirtauce than tho nrmy and navy.
Accordingly requisitions have been cut
to tbu minimum. Next to the supreme
value of artillery the war In Kurope
has taught the lesson that no cam
paign can be carried on with nny hope
of success without tho services of a
large force of competent aviators. Sec
retary Gariuson displays more tact than
energy of expression when he says that
"the present Congress made a good start
toward putting aviation on n substan
tial ImsIs." The fact Is that while there
has been ample time to equip the nrtnj
with machines and skilful aviators the
new Intelligence branch of the service
is far from what It ought to be. Con
gress should have made nn appropria
tion at least four times as large as was
doled out for the purpose. The truth Is
Congress has never taken military nvla
tlon seriously.
In recommending that the army be
Increased by l,(no oltleers and Sfl.OtX)
men the Secretary draws attention to
tlie Imperative need of having a much
larger force to guard tho Panama Canal,
and ho points out that after the con
templated Increase of 1.770 men Is made
there would remain In the United
States, exclusive of garrisons In outly
ing possessions, only 12.(110 coast ar
tillery troops and 1M.00O Infantry, cav
airy mid field artillery, "the latter being
not much more than twice the sire of
the poltc force of the city of New
York" Under the circumstances a pro
iwsal to add 2...000 men to the regular
army may err on the side of moderation.
Unless, ns Mr. GnRiso advises, the
regular nrmy can. through a better
scheme of enlistment, be ued hs it
school for nn adequate reserve force. It
would be well to double I he Increase of
men he usks for.
Ail Old
I.l.'tr Heports the Presi
dent's Address.
Once more that famous old Impostor
the Congressional llccortl gladdens a
nation expensively educated to seek in
Its columns what did not happen lu
House nnd Senate. Its habit of useless
repetition persist, and It provides for
Its readers In number 2 of volume M
two versions of President Wilson's ad
dress. Accuracy has never li.tiiipensl
ihe Imagination of Its editors, nor does
it now. On page 111, In the proceedings
of the Senate, the student larns that:
"Tlie addrets of the Preu'dent of the
United States this day delivered to both
houses of Conpres Is an follows t
"Annual Address of the President to
the Congress.
"Gentlemen of the Congress, th es

be the rlosing session of the Sixty-third

Those who prefer a different form of
.salutation may turn ! page 2i5, where,
in the House proceedings, they will
learn that the President s.ild:
"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vlce-I'rrsldent and
gentlemen of the CoiiKress "
How were the President's remarks
.'ibout our merchant marine phrased,
and how received? The Senate account
on page 111 presents:
"To speak plainly, we have grossly
erred In the nny In which we have stun'ed I
and hindered the development of our mer-

snips, we n.io not got mem.

"To speak plainly, we have grosly

The Dispensary Abuse,
Uroin time to time tin-re arises a wall
from the medical rank and tile over Ihe
loss of rowuue legitimately due the

treatment at the dispensaries of our

Illness among the deserv lug poor. With

many who arc well utile to employ pri

Women lune been known to divest
llniiiselvp.s of Jewelry before entering

lune been resnried to for the purpose
of obtaining free inivllcnl advice by
persons who lacked self respect, S

Hon Involved expense, ami the (llllUiil

the small revenue derived from ftllliiir

N'o wonder thnt the status of this
dispensary alms,. s dlsti'eslng, as II.
liMi'iited by the report of Dr. .Tonrptl
II, rAitue.it, chairman of a committee
nppotntod by the American .Medical
Association to Investigate liospllnl and
dispensary abuse. It was discovered
that one-half of tho physicians of
Philadelphia recehe for office consulta
tions only r,0 cents, nnd another fourth
lift cents, on account of reckless free
prescribing at the dlspctisnrles.
The fault lies mainly with the ills
pensary managers, who appear not to
have at heart the interest of the med
ical profession. The doctor has al
ways been Imposed upon, and he does
not In this emergency even rise to ns
sort his rights by refusing to attend
these carelessly conducted dispensaries.
It were well that the lay trustees of
these institutions Investigate the abuses
that exist in most of them.
The Testimony of a Popular Mind
Hendcr.
The public is far from being- "tired
of hearing from" Mr. Hoosuvelt, ns he
Is represented as writing to an Oregon
Progressive. When ho declares, If he
did declare, that "the public Is tired of
hearing of reforms, of hearing from
reformers," 1 1m t perception of public
opinion which ho once possessed In a
degree nmoiintlng to genius or clair
voyance seems awake ngalu.
With a generous ardor, and some
times to their own material barm, tli
people have accepled the doctrine of the
Immanent wickedness of government
mid business. They have been eager !o
change and reform and amellorale. The
Federal and State stntn'e books sag
with the enacted enthusiasms. N"i
doubt much good has been done and
some evil, but the passjon for reform
cannot be at fever beat always. There
has been a period of moral fervor. Are
Americans satiated with It: have they
got all of It they can stand for the
present? After all. one must make a
living; and reflection and quiet are
natural nfter so much ferment and
turmoil.
The elections seemed to indicate It.
Mr. Wilson Is becoming a standpatter
In his way. Mr. I!nost:iri.T. If he Is
quoted correctly, adds the testimony r.f
a consummate popular mind reader.
Unoiigh Is a good as a feast.
If the Administration Insists on put
ting on embargo upon American muni
tions of war Intended for tho belliger
ent nntlons of Uurope, the least It can
do for our own citizens Is to est ibll.sh a I
blockade of cur ports auninst the Kuro- j

So many exceptions and restrictions

Clrrioninn's View on Moral Standards
In Harwich and Washington.
To the KniTon o The Sun Sir? Your
flrst editorial nrUUn of December 9 on
"President Wilson on Mexico" Is thought'
ful but hnsty. There, I much which re
sembles the Harwich Incident, with ono
exception. That is history, hence It is
closed ; sealed. Tlie Mexican situation Is
a living Issue,
Good will has given a mortal wound to
the Mexican revolution. Can't you In
your Intellectual conceit glvo the wounded
tlmo to die. a natural death, or would you
do ns some armies do. bayonet the
wounded to savo hospital treatment and
prisoners keep?
How can President Wilson, who sees
the moral side of an Issue, txplaln to a
commercialized material peopl engrossed
In the self-interest of a limited, restricted
view tho spiritual truth of which he Is
awnrai namely, that "the universe Is a
slow effect"?
Was It ltuskln who said : "Who tie
feated Napoleon at Waterloo? It was
God! The soldiers were mere pawns on
the chessboard."
The artillery of good will has opened
fire upon the disorder In Mexico; the
exercise of loving patience has been sorely
tried, but still holds on. All tho revolu
tionists have not been made fully ac
quainted with the rsil farts, as they can
not be communicated with at once. The
"moral" means of communication are Ilk"
the telegraph, , telephone and railroad
facilities, a little out of repair.
President VIIon knows the two his
torical Incidents, the Harwich affair: also
Wellington's victory And because he
Minus lie 'nr. calmly wait for the truth
to bo demonstrated. After the exploslcns
of bombs like this eilltorl.il article have
done their worst the President and Secre
tary of State will hay, "1 told you so."
I nm stimulated dally by your thought
ful editorial articles, I should like to
know the man who can dallv give out so
murh wisdom. This Is the time the
clergyman has one on the editor. Kindly

during the course of my twenty-five years
reading of Thu St'N nono has given mo
keener delight than the one from Mr
Itecln-ill Halle Donnall of Newark. Ills
description of the woes h suffers when
attending theatres tits thousands of men,
and wvmen too.
I know thousands Join me in the wish
that Mr I,.nnall would start a crusade
nmnri; our theatrical manacers to pre-
cut women with ungodly and unsightly
m.rf'iriM from attending p'a houses, It
ok v.irs and 'irs to br.ng to a sue
irful isnie the r.itnpitgn against w- men
wearing h.iis In the theatre, but the flirht
was won deplt th" prot, stations of the
women Let Mr. Donnall bgln his on
i lament. Hundreds of men Will Join In the.
light. I know.
Regarding the other nulsmees. the col
lege boy and his lndy love who chatter
dining the performance like a flock of
crows, thre Is but one way to net rid
of this abomination. Lt those disturbed
report the annoyance to the box tiler,
make a demand for the return of their
ticket monev or a.k the management to
return tlie tle'e: money to tho annoyers.
Personal remonslnipc-s to these clatter
ers, whose small t ilk e uld be postponed
until after the perform ince or between
the acts, iloea not seem to obtain relief;
and o:h r measures mut be taken.
Is there one manager who would dare
to publish Mr. nonnall's lett r in his pro
gramme, so that thoe attending his the
atro nilcht garner a cv r:" The pub
lishers of su -Ii I'-ogr I'n-ie s in New Yotk
city migiit help to do aw ly with or at
least mltig.it,) these chronic annoyances
by publishing an editorial on theatre
m liner.. It Is strange Indeed that such
a thing should lie asked for In these our
times, but It Is in cPsI very b idly.

KORNGOLD'S MUSIC
BY PHILHARMONIC
Symphony by Vienna's Jtoy
Composer Hcnrri for First
Time Here.
W0KK DISPLAYS TALENT
The concert of tho Philharmonic So
ciety at Carnegie Hall last evening was
divided between two composers, lSrlch
Korngolil of Vienna and lllrhard Wag
ner of Uayreuth. The latter was repre
sented by several numbers which have
been familiar to the world for some years
and which are expected to bn so for many
more. They wers the "Tannhaeusor"
overture, "WaJdweben" from "Siegfried,
vorsplel to "Die Molsterslnger," "Good
Friday Spell" from "I'atslfal" and "111-
enil" overture. Mr. Korngold was rep
resented by his "Slafonletta," opus D,
playtd for the llrst time hero.
Th world "do move. Mr. Korngold
Is 17 yeats old. Ills ".Slnfonletta" Irmted
forty minutes or mote, und It required
a full modern orchestra with evon contra-
fagot and tuba, two harps, celesta, pi
ano and two large bells. Mozart's sym
phonies were much shorter and did not
teuulru nearly so much apparatus. liven.

The "Slnfonletta" is really u symphony
In extent and character. It has tlir
usual four motemcntH-nn allegro nt the ,
beginning, another nt the end, a scherzo,
as thu second and a slow movement as
tho thltd. The work I" overladen with
thematic materials to such an extent that
only In the scherzo Is u clear and logical

rably written and has genulno musical
beauty.
In the slow movement alo tner is
much to nroues hope for tho boy's future.
Tho symphony as a whole thowa more
youthfulticss of spirit than the earlier
woiks heard here;, works which seemod
to have been written by an old man, and
in unhaoov one at that. The very (lis-
Jolntedness, redundancy and erratic de
ve.opincnts In this work speak of the
prodigality and wilfulness of outh.
