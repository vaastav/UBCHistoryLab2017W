Farmington is to have a bank; E. E.
Kirtpatrick, proprietor.
Hog-stealing is epidemic in Ripley
county Just now. Well, it's a bad
time of the year to be out of meat.
The Cash-Book claims to have
"more than double the circulation of
the noiBy and reckless Democrat."
The Piedmont Leader favors J. T.
Ake, for Register of Lands at Ironton
Mr. Ake is peculiarly fitted for the of
fice. Reynolds Outlook.
W. A. Munger is now one of the ed
itors of the Reynolds Outlook, Bro,
Khriver havin? taken him in. The
editors have our best wishes.
The old Cooper house, about one
mile southeast of Frederlcktown, was
'destroyed by fire last Friday week. It
was occupied by Mr. Jos. Stevenson.
The contents were nearly all saved.
' Since John Sherman has been elect
ed president of the Senate, the Jeffer
son IJtmocrat thinks all good people
ought to heartily pray for life and good
health to Grover Cleveland. Amen!
; J. Logan Nations has been raising
Cain again. The other day he tried to
" force a young lady to elope with him
Why the nation don't the good peo

;' ; The Poplar Bluff Citizen says: 'C
as good an article of butter and cheese
be made in this county as is made in
' other localities?" The asking of the
. question Is a slap at the Butler county
. butter-makers.
Dr. L. W. PUleywas one of the pas
sengers , aboard the "Sunny South,'
which was burned at New Madrid last
Saturday week. He, as well as all
others on the boat,' escaped, but at
the baggage went up in the fire.
Work on the Farmiogton courthouse
progresses slowly. The foundation was
finished last week only, and this is
mighty poor weather for brickwork
The contractors, by the terms of the
bond, were to have had the building
under roof in two weeks.
Centre ville had a fire last Thursday
airs, saran eny's resilience ana con
tents were burned, the neighbors be
ing unable to save anything. The
alarm was given about two o'clock in
the morning, and the family were ab
sent. There was some insurance.
. Potosi is putting on airs and feeling
- big because Gen. Hazen has made her
'a signal-service station. The cold
" wave flag went up fir the first time
- last week, floating from the pole over
Postmaster Teasdale's quarters. By
j the way, we desire right now and here
to congratulate Mr. T. upon his get
ting safely and securely "in."
The ' society ladies of De Soto are
"after" the fashion editor of the Watch-
. man. He has been reporting some of
: the toilets worn by the prominent ladies
at a late swell wedding. He gave it
to 'em strong about two and a half
columns. We read those columns with
admiration and envy, and in our ignor
ance sigted for that editor's knowledge
of lacet., and surahs, and biases, and
things. With somewhat of gleeful vin
dictiveness, we therefore reproduce the
winding-up of abetter from a wrathfu
dame to his rivals pap-.
These exasperatm.Ihhvminduce us to
hope the next time cards affe Bent to the
r Watchman, that the fashion editor will have
the measles or be too busy to attend; and
advise him in future to confine his flights of
fancy to the congratulations, where he seems
to be at home, if not truthful. Patience is a
virtue most ladies possess, but it won't bear
much strain when a fashion editor, who
don't know full-draped fronts from full
draped backs, makes of his descriptions such
hopeless muddles and calls a floral canopy
an umbrella.
The Cape Girardeau News wil
' change to an all-at-home next week.
There are now four papers in the South
east who have dropped "patents" with
in the past three months. This virtu
- ous spurt of home production will
probablv-Iast through six months, and
then weexpect to see the adventurous
spirits return, lank in pocket, short in
circulation, but rich inexperience. The
faot is a "patent" used,but not abused,
is a necessity these days. On our sub
. acription list are many subscribers who
take no other paper than the Regis
ter. Do vou suppose tbey would be
as well satisfied if the paper were all
at home? Brethren, let us reason to-
- trether: take the last week's edition of
the Registeb, tor Instance. In add
tion to eight columns of home reading,
and twenty columns of advertising,
we, through our patent aide, gave our
readers twenty-six columns of good,
wholesome, interesting matter. Of
. these, six columns contained compiled
news from all over the world, the ed
iting of which would keep the ordina
ry country editor busy three days in
the week; six columns contained varied
reading wit and humor, scientifio mis
cellany, household recipes, etc.; the
President's message took six more: to
the details of the funeral of the late
Vice-Presideut were given three col
umns; and the remainder of the space
was taken up by a aerial story, politi
cal matter, agricultural reading, etc.
With the opening of Congress or the
1 assembling of the Legislature com
mence boiled down reports of their pro
ceedings. Not a bill or resolution in
troduced into either body, but that the
reader of this paper has the faot set be
fore him. au our all-at-home breth-,
ren do so much for their subscribers?
We think not. The abuse of "patents"
lies in neglecting the home part of the
paper, and depending on the excellence
of the "inside" to carry it through.
Do your duty to your side of your pa
per, dear brother, aud you may safely
set down the subscriber who objects to
the 'tother side as well, as as defi
cient in judgment. , t
Ex-Governor B. Gratz Brown died
at his residence at Kirkwood, shortly
after 7 o'clock last Sunday . morning.
He first complained of Illness on Thurs
day, and his demise was hastened by
imprudently leaving.his bed while suf
fering from pneumonia. The eminent
jurist, was born at Lexington, Ky.,
May 28, 1826. He inherited his powers
of mind, by natural succession, his
grandfather being at one time presi
dent pro tern, of the senate, and his
father winning fame as a jurist. Young
Gratz took his classical course at Tran
sylvania university, Lexington, and
stepped from there to Yale college in
1845, where he graduated in 1847. On
his return to Lexington he was admit
ed to the bar. Iu 1849 he moved to
St. Louis. In 1852 he was elected to
the legislature as a freesoiler, and two
years later became editor of the Mis
souri Democrat. During the heated
discussion of slavery questions prior to
the rebellion, he was again elected to
the legislature, and warmly advocated
freedom for the negro. In a duel with
Thomas C. Reynolds, growing out of
the election excitement, Mr. Brown
was wounded in the knee. Mr. Brown
was instrumental in raising the first
three months regiment in the state,
and went to the front as a colonel. He
was shortly advanced to the rank of
general, and did good service in South
western Missouri. In 1863-4 the legis
lature sent him to the senate, but. ow
ing to ill health, he wa9 compelled to
resign. In 1870 by a coalition of dem
ocrats and republicans he was elected
governor of Missouri by a majoritg of
41,917 votes. He was afterwards nom
inated tor vice-president of the United
States on the ticket with Horace
Greeley. Of recent years the ex-gov
ernor devoted himself to his law prac
tice, but died a comparatively poor
man. The funeral took place from his
late residence on Tuesday, and was
largely attended. May he rest
peace! ,
