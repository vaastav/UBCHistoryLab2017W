TI1E LAST CHAMOIS,
The second Bctsion of the Forty'Seventh
Congress assembled in Washington on loft
Monday. Tho Democrats Dave a luejority
in both branches of the present Congress,
but after the fourth of March next tho Re
publicans will have a plurality in the low;r
House, the Independents and Grccnlmrkers
holding the balance of power, with tin?
probability that on all political questions
they will atlllinte with the Republicans. If
the Senate should bc Republican, that party
will have control of tho Federal government
for thc next two yeara. It is not probable
that any measures of a partisan character
will bc drought before thc present Congress,
ami it is more than likely that thc present
session will be eminently practical and de
voted to thc consideration of mensures pro
motive of the general interests of the whole
country. Tho tariff and revenue laws ncad
revision, and now when tho country und
Congress rest from nil iioliticnl excitement
is thc time for statesmen of both parties to
give to the country a just and equal tarin",
ono which shall protect thc industries of
thc country alike without unjust discrimi
nation *in favor of any industry < .-against
nny class of consumers, and one which ut
Die same time shall rnlsc thc largest amount
of revenue, mid thereby enable Congress to
reform and reduce th? Internal Revenue
taxation. If the Democratic party in this
tho last session of its supremacy in both
branches ol Congress shall secure to thc
country a sound currency, ignoring repudi
ation and arcenbackism, adopt a tariff for
revenue, and at the same Mme have regard
to a just protection uf iL^. industrial inter
I ,?s of the country, and so reform the Inter
nal Revenue taxes that they shall not oper
ate unjustly against the industries of limited
portions of the country, it will receive the
commendation of all sections and parties.
PKESII?ENT*8 MESSAGE.
Piosident Hayes on Inst Monday com
municated to both Houses of Congress
bis last annual message. It ls quito
lengthy, and if lt wero not for thc roconi
iHerniation of a nev crusade against tho
South which ItcontniiiB, would strike tho
publie ns containing suggestions emi
nently wiso and national. Tho President
assumes that "continued opposition to
tho full nnd freo onjoymont of tho rights
of citizenship, conferred upon tho colored
people by tho recent amendments to the
Constitution, still prevails in suvoral of
tho lato alaveholdlng States," and asks
C??grf?? to pass lirai sud well considered
measures to enforce tho Fifteenth Amend
ment, which means that [[tho Federal
Government shall control all Federal
elections in tho Southern States. Thc
President further recommends tho House
of Rcpreacntotlves and the Senate to BCO
to it that every caso of tho violation of
tho letter or spirit of thc Flftcontb Amend
ment is thoroughly investigated, and
that no bencllt from such violation shall
neerim to any porson or party, which
means that tho next Congress shall cx
cludo .snell members nf Congress und
Senators as tho Republicans may deem
expedient. Tho President further asks
Congress for sulliciont appropriations to
irosecuto unsparingly all who havo boon
engaged in depriving citizens of tho
rights guaranteed to them by tho Consti
tution. Whatever may be tho merits cf
tho rcmaiudor of the Message, this por
tion of it is n dark .spot which mais tho
whole, and identities tho President witli
tho H'alwarth elem-, ut of his parly, and
that instead of necking at tho closo of his
administration to heal all sectional feel
ings, it is his desire to kindle afresh tiio
fires of sectional hate and animosity.
Wo aro sutlalled that avery reader of tho
INTELLIGENCER will bo gratified to learn
of tho great iucreaso in tho shipping
business of our "City by thoSoa," which
is shown by thc following comparativo
statement, taken from tho Ara/ a id Cou
rier: "Tho total valus of tho exports from
thia port for tho first thrco months of tho
business yenr commencing Boptoinbor 1,
1880, is $7,700,035 against 10,720,313 for tho
?anio period last year, an Increase of
$1,083,322 in tinco months. Tho value of
tho imports for tho samo period were
$11,171.20 for 18S0 and $11,787.83 fur 1S70,
nn increaic of $2,383.43. paring tho threo
months just closed there were 23 foreign
steamships entered nt tho custom housi
with an aggregate tonnage of 34,127 tons,
against 10 vessels with an oggregtito ton
nage or 20,701 tons during tho snmo
period last year." Every South Caro
linian should feel a deep interest iii

prosperity. Whon abo gets that long
covctud direct connection with tho great
Northwest by tho completion of tho Dluo
Ridge Railrood, sho will becomo without

The" bill amending the Act prohibiting Du

contest on its second reading to-day. Semi
tor Ferry moved to amsnd by totally pro
limiting the sale. Benator Wylie though
that wouM operate against those who die
not make enough to pack a bale, and kep
landowners from taxing seed cotton fo
isat. It was too sweeping a remedy.
Senator Perry thought the present lav
wa? nullified by thieves selling In day Ugh
what they had stolen at nigh?,
Senator Fishburno moved tho indefinit,
postponement of the prohibitory amend
mont. It operated against tho poore

sale of corn or'othtr agricultural products
No "aw which was too harsh could be en
forced.
Senator Perry then withdrew his amend

Senator Miller then opposed (he bill ti
toto, as a great hardship on thc 'r ui.;.- o
Beaufort County, at least, where cotton wa
raised in small lots.
Senator Wylie said that restrictions fo
moral reasons were already placed on th
talc of other commodities, and if this pro
hibition diminished larceny it would he i
boon to tho people.
Senator Miller's motion to strike out th
prohibitory clause was defeated.

WASHINGTON, November 30.
Comparatively low mom hers of Con
gress ute their thanksgiving turkey
In Washington, but now that festival is
over, they aro dropping into town in dai
ly increasing numbers. Tlit-ro is a
marked lack of excitement about polities,
and the gcner.il feeling seems to bo thut
wo aro going to have a comparatively
quiet winter. Tho Republicans aro, of
course, on ti roly sat ls tied with tho situa
tion, and do not seem disposed to attempt
anything out of tho ordinary line. The
Democrats in turu aro somewhat sub
dued by the result of tho election, and
such of them ns have put in an appear
ance favor u strictly business session.
Tho first Monday in December this yenr
will not como until tho 0th of tho month,
and that will leave only seventy-six
working doys before tho llb of March.
Tho holiduy'recess will roduco tho nuin
bor to about sixty, and this will not suf
fice for much work outside tho regular
appropriation bills. (Jon; Walker will"
ii*vo tho census figures ready, so that
tho reapportionment of Cone r JSS might bo
mudo if it wcro desired, but tho Republi
cans can bo trusted to light it off. Thoro
is scarcely any chance to secure a parti
cle of partisan advantage out of this busi
ness, but tho Republicans profess to lear
that Hie Dem?crata would not do tho job
fairly. Tho r ally important subject to
como before Congress this winter is
Tin: QUESTION nv IIKFI'NIHNU.
Sovoral hundred millions of builds fall
duo next summer, and provision must
bo made for thom beforo thut timo-if not
during the winter, by nu extra session
in the spring. It is only u quostiun of
tho rute of interest, however. A year
ago Secretary Sherman opposed any
thing less than four per cent., hut every
body now sees that u 31 por cent, bout!
would bo snapped up readily, and a good
ninny people think a 3 per cent, boud
could bo Heated. Neither party has any
thing to gain by deferring uction on this
subject, and thero in evory reason to ho
licvothal asatisfuetnry bill will DO passed,
Thero may bo sonio trouble about the
appropriation that will be asked for k>
jmy
TUB DEPUTY MARSHALS
employed in various parts of tho country
at tho "recent election, but even if tho
money should ho refused, it would not
constitute a sufficient reason for an extra
session. Everybody knows thnt tho
noxt Congress will allow tho bills, and
tho marshals could wait n lew months for
their pay without any nulfering. The
iniliumcu of nil tho Democratic officials
of tho House will bo thrown against an
extra session, inasmuch as that would
involvo their immcdinto displacement by
Republicans, whereas otherwise they
would continuo to hold their places nutt
draw their pay until Dccombor, 1881. On
tho other hand some of tho Republican
aspirants for their positions will urge
AS EXTltA SKSSIOU
so that they may get their names on tho
payroll nt onco. Still no party would
think of forcing an oxtrn session for such
a put pose, und thoro ls now nn excellent
prospect that tho country may have a
long ros? from Congress arter the Sonate
lias conUruictt President Garfield's ap
pointments next March.
THE PRESIDENT Kt.ECT
got off to Ohio yesterday, uftoi nearly a
week in tho capital, and "does not o*n*wt
io return until a lew days before his*in
auguration. Ho hail n very busy time of
it while ho waa herc, what with crowds
ot callers ami breakfasts anti dinner4 out
almost every day. Tho President gavo a
big dinner in his honor Saturday even
in::, and on tho morning of that day Levi
P. Morton, tho rich Now York banker,
entertained him nt an olegant breakfast.
Suuutor Edmunds, Rob Ingersoll and
Gen. Schonck wero among others who
had tho Garfields as their guests. A
great many people had conversations
willi tho President-elect, but ho kept his
own counsel very well. Tho only thing
clear about his Cabinet is that ho has
decided nothing us yet, and will wait till
after tho senatorial ?lections hoforo be
makes out tho list. Ono result of Gar
field's visit ls a riso of
SHBnMAN STOCK
in the Ohio ?Gnat ?rial market. Thero is
no doubt whatovor that tho secretary of
tho trcai my is very anxious to resumo
hi? old placa in tho Capitol, and it Is
equal";, evident thnt his trannfer would
relievo Garfield of a gravo difficulty. If
Sherman wera not elected senator, he
could not welt refuse to oiler him a
chanco to remain in the Cabinet, and
whatever tho secretary's real feelings
toward him may bo, there must bo moro
or less constraint always tn thoir rela
tions to each other. . Besides If Garfield
wore to koop Sherman it would bo hard
for him not to retain other m em bora of
tho pre- it Cabinet. It will theroforo bo
much moro sntisfactoiy all around to
elect Sherman ns Thurman's successor,
and tho only serious opposition will
I como from Govomor Fostor, of Ohio,
> who ons natl his hoart sot upon tho placo,
j But Foster can be prov Idea for other
I wiso, ?nd lt is apparent thnt hs cannot
count upon Garfield's alistante in his
attompt to capture tho senator-ship. Tho
President elect wilt hold aloof from tbe
fight himself, but lils next friends-men
like OnncrroRsmon Townsend, of Cleve
land, and Butterworth, of Cincinnati
havo gono actively to work in Sherman'
interest.
