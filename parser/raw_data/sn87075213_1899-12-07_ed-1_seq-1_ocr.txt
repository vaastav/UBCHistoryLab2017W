TO INVESTIGATE
Mr. Taylor's Resolution to Ap

A SUB-RESOLUTION WAS REJECTED.

Wabuikciton?, Dec 7. Tuesday after
noon, after an Interesting debato of
three, the house, by a vote of 002
to SO, adopted the? resolution offer
ed by Mr. Taylor, of Ohio, Monday,
for tho appointment of a special com
mittee to investigate tho chargeB
against Urlgham H. Roberta, tho Mor
mon representative-elect from .Utah.
Previously the house had rejected a sub
resolution offered by Mr. Richardson,
tho leader of tho minority, to allow
Mr. Roberts to bo sworn in and to send
tho whole case to the judiciary com
mittee. This substitute resolution,
however, by no means commanded tho
full democratic strength. Only 57
members voted for it. Ol tho30
who voted to adopt the -Taylor
resolution, all were domocrats but
two, Mr. Loud, a California republic
an, and Mr. Nowiands, a silverito
from Nevada.
Ily the terms of tho resolution Mr.
Roberts is not only excluded from all
participation in tho proceedings of
the houso until the committee reports
and the house passes upon his caso
but he is denied a scat in the hall.
Whether this will bo interpreted to
deny him admission within tho cham
ber pending the disposition of his case
is yet to bo decided.
One of the most remarkable feat
Tires of tho debate was tho fact that
Mr. Roberts' presentation of his own
side of the case, which lasted almost
an hour, became so absorbing that he
won the sympathy of many of thoso in
the galleries, and was several times
showered with applause. It was evi
dent that ho realized .that the house
was overwhelmingly against him, and
ait times ho spoko fiercely and de
fiantly. Mr. Taylor conducted the case upon
liis side. Mr. Richardson championed
liis resolution.
Spealter Henderson appointed tho
following members in tho Roberts
case under the resolution:
Republicans, Taylor, Ohio, chairman;
Landis, Indiana: Morris, Minnesota;
Freer,. West Virglula; JMttlofield,
Maine; Mcl'herson, Iowa. Denipcrats,
Dc Arraond, Missouri; Lanham, Texas,

called a meeting or the committee
for 11 o'clock Thursday morning. Mr.
Taylor says this initial meeting will
be to determine upon a general lino
of action. He could not say how Boon
the committee would be able to re
port. While the chairman would not
speak for the committee, he said ho
had no doubt that Mr. Roberts would
be allowed to be present, with coun
sel if he desired, and would be af
forded the usual facilities to havo his
side presented. There uro a num
ber of witnesses in Washington nnd
some In 6tah, but It is probable that
the committee will not leavo AVash
ington. Mr. Taylor said he had some
doubt as to whether the hearing, par
ticularly such parts as involved fam
ily matters, should be open to the
public.

Mnysvillc, Ky., Dec. 7. Negro mur
derer Dick Coleman arrived nt 10:30
Wednesday morning under u special
guard of deputies sworn in by the
sheriff, Including' Detective Fitzger
ald, Constable Dawson, Chief of I'o
lice Donovan, ull of the police force
and two deputy sheriffs. When they
arrived at the court house they were
met by n mob of fully 1,000 people,
headed by James Lnshbrook, the hus
band of the murdered woman, and
went immediately up Second street
through the central portion of tho
city to the hill, followed by fully.fivu
tnousand of tho citizens of this city
nnd county. Tills is tho first time
anything of this kind ever hnppcned
iu this city, and the excitement Is in
tense. All was done thnt was posslblo
by tho sheriff and his guard to pre
ent a lynching, but in the face of
such a mob of people, Irrespective of
color, It was useless to attempt to do
anything save deliver him up, which
was done. They grabbed him una
threw a rope over his head, nnd took
him up above the ctly and strung him
up. The poor wretch could be heard
above the cries of the mob, pleading
for his life, but the mob only heard
tho Cries of Mr. Lasbrook.
About 250 were nt the C. & 0. train
Tuesday nlghfexpeetlng him, but as
he failed to come theynlted for him
Wednesday morning. There is no tell
ing what would lime been done had
they succeeded in getting him in jail,
as there would have undoubtedly
been several killed in the attempt to
storm the jail doors.
Tho mob carried Coleman to n small
hollow near the railroad tracks,
where they bound him tightly to a
young sapling, Then' they heaped a
huge pile of brush woodand timber
nround him and fired tho stack", while
his eyes rolled horribly. Some one iut
out his eyes, nnd in a moment his
head rolled around and he was be
lieved to be dead.
Coleman said 15 minutes before he
was but afire that he had nothing to
say. His death was slow, and, writh
ing in terrible agony, he was hooted
and glared at by the people standing
on the edge of the pit. Many women
wera present. He died at lOiTiO n. in.
The scene was nn nwful one, and
around the funeral pyro were 10,000
maddened people, headed by the hus
band of the dead woman. A dozen
torches were applied simultaneously,
and huge tongues of fire swept up
and around the agonied wretch.
Coleiniin'H Crime.
Coleman's crime was u most revolt
ing one. Ho enticed Mrs. Mary Lnsh
brook into a shed on tho pretense of
looking nt some work, and knocked
her senseless with n club. He then
asaulted her. She showed signs of re
turning consciousness, nnd he ran to
j his room, got n razor and cut her
throat. Again she revived, and ho
ended her misery with n blow from
an ux. Ho jumped on a horse, and
riding to n field calmly told his vic
tim's husband that some one had
killed her.
He was arrested later, nnd beforo
Lashbrook suspected that he was the
murderer, lie was put on a trnin nnd
taken to the Coington jail. Ho made
a complete confession of the fiendish
crime to -a reporter on his ar
rival. Ho is only 20 years old, and has
a pleasant face. Mrs. Lashbrook was
beautiful, and a society favorite in
Maysvlllo.
Gov. Bradley has only five days of
his administration remaining, but ho
will make nn effort to have the Mnys
vllle mob vigorously prosecuted. Ho
j will offer a reward for their oppre-
uension.

FllANKroitT, Ky., Dec 7. The stato
board of election commissioners, sit
ting as a canvassing board, finished its
w ork at 4 o'clock Tuesday afternoon.
Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock the
members of the board sat in tho
state senate chrimbcr as a contesting
board tq hear arguments in 11 con
tested cases.
The first great Dght came up on
tho auestion of whether or not the
board h.is the right"to go behind tho
certified returns filed with tho secre
tary of stato by tho different counties.
Upon tho issuo of the argument on
this point will rest tho name of the
next governor of Kentucky. On the
faco of tho returns now on filo with
the secretary of stale, Mr. Taylor has
a plurality of 2,833, hts total being
103,714, against 101,331 for Goebel.
If there Is to be no going behind the
returns tho board will have no option
but to issuo tho certificate of election
to him. If tho board decides it has
tho power to go behind the returns
there is no telling who will receive the
certificate. It will depend entirely
upon tho results of tho contest to le
decided before the board, and the mat
ter will without doubt bo carried for
final settlement to the stale legisla
ture, which meets next month.
Secretary of Slate Finley stopped
all controversy about the returns be
ing taken from his office by the elec
tion board, by coining with llieiu to
the senate chamber and remaining in
personal charge of them. '
There were rumors to the effect
that the state board would seek
to have vlsitorn searched for the pur
pose of disarming lllo'se' foiina to
hnvo weapons. Mace Williams, chief
of the capitol police, declared nobody
would be searched ou the capitol
grounds. Mountain men have been
advised to resist searching except on
an order from court, produced by the
searcher.
Gen. Taj lor remained at home. lie
is threatened with nervous prostra
tion. In deciding the course of argument
It was arranged that the democratic
attorney should have the close. The
republicans agreed to open, and D.
W. t'ttrlcigh for their side brought up
the question that the board had no
right to go behind the ictuins of the
canvassing board. ITu claimed that
no state In the union permitted cueh
action, saying that the matter had
been decided in all the courts of the
I'nitcd States from the supreme court
of (he nation down. ,
,'1'he words "examining" and "com
parison" in Section 10 of the election
law furnish the basis for the argu
ment. Democratic counsel claim that
examining the returns admits of go
Ing behind the face of the lctiirns.
Republican counsel claim tiiat the ex
amination allowed is simply to see
Hint the county returns tuo correct
ly icportcd. Democratic counsel are
lighting to keep Taylor from getting
the certificate on the face of the re
turns. The chances were slim for a decis
ion of any kind before Thursday. The
day" was taken up In arguments by
the six lawyers, each one of whom
spoko at length.
