WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. Two more
farm credit plans were added today to
the dozen or more already before con
gress. A bill amending the farm loan act to
provide additional credits was intro
duced by Senator Norbeck, (Republic
an. South Dakota), and Representative
Strong, (Republican, Kansas), while
another introduced ty senator nor
beck and Representative A. P. Nelson,
fReDublican. Wisconsin), would autn
orlze the war finance corporation to
' make loans to foreign purchasers of
American agricultural products.
Both of the bills are endorsed by the
'American Farm Bureau federation and
go beyond the administration propos
als in the recently introduced Lenroot
Anderson bill. Whether the differ
ences may bo harmonized easily has
Hot yet been developed, but certain
provisions of the new Norbeck-Strong
measure are contained in other bills in
troduced by Senator Capper, (Repub
lican, Kansas), chairman of the sen
ate farm bloc, and others of the farm
group in congress.
Increase Loans
tncreaee from $10,000 to $25,000 of
the maximum loan which could be
made to individual farmers by co-op
erative farm land barks is one of the
principal features of the Norbeck-1
Strong bill. Senator Norbeck said!
that this change would "give local co
aperative associations a better chance
to compete with the Joint stock land
banks."
Such loans aleo under the new bill
would be available for security on ma
chinery and other debts of borrowers
and not limited, as under the present
law, to land and buildings.
"The bill which I have introduced,
eald Senator Norbeck of this feature,
makes it possible for a farmer who
owes money on farm machinery for
instance, to place a mortgage on his
land with the federal farm loan asso
ciations and pay off the debt on the
farm machinery. He may also bor
' row money to educate his family."
