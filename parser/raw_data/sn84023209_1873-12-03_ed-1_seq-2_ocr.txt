MONTPEL1ER, VT. ,
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1873
Meeting of congress.
The forty-third Congress bean work Mon
day, and it will bavcenough of it to do. It
would be a rich blessing to the country if
t ic national assembly would realize that it
can best accomplish its mission by spending
a full half of its time in tflbrts not to pass
Jaws.
No session has of late years been looked
forward t with so ci'ish interest by the
country a the one just bezun. Measures
of great importance must come before it;
those that need the wisest statesmanship.
The panic of the la.-t fall, and the failure of
inanyreit business firms h ive led lncn to
look lor sj'jh a treatment of tiuirieial ques
tions as shall in some way give relief, The
men who assemble in Washington this week,
do not spend their time there in creating
wealth; while thurj fiey are not produ
cers in the orJinary s:use of the term.
They must be more than human if they can
" give roliel otherwise than any one who
lias money at his om.naul cin do. A rich
man may give as he chooses ; CoDgress is
limited ia its ways of giving.
The making ot greenbacks is not the crea
tion of wea'th ; their is.uj ii not always the
iuodiuirie nrp ipil by a fiek business season.
They stimulate for the time but the reaction
Cjmes surely. Tnere is only one way out ol
financial tr.juMes work aud the use of mon
ey earned in a careful way. Those woo owe
and have property mus; pay their debts;
those who haven't money must earn if.
That is all that will bring us out ot panics
and financial depressions. Tnis lookiag to
Congress for some great and unknown boon
is nonsense. They may help by the passage
of laws that may fund our debt at a less race
of interest; by cutting down appropriations
and by spending just as little of the revenue
as possible. There may be such a state of
the money market that a little temporary
relief may be had by the enlarging or con
tracting of the circulating promises to pay
of this government that pass for money.
There may be something done by the rear
rangement of the banking system of the
country. But all these things are mere help-.
There are ways, of course, in which Con
gress may enact the role of the almsgive; .
Employ men tof poor men in public works
may keep the wolf from the djor of some o!
them. Charity is not the (orte of nations,
however ; it degenerates into favoritism and
the best way is to accustom the country to
the notion that grown men are to consider
themselves weaned and njt to run to the N v
tion as to a mother when they want help or
sustenance. So we expect little permanent
good will come of any of the ruaay pin iotas
which will be offered for curing our many
troubles.
The happy settlement of our trouble wit i
Spain will relieve Congress from the neces
sity of voting away millions that wou'J
have tj be paid at s aaa time. It will alsj,
we hope, save the c juatry from a deluge of
spread-eagle oratory that is supposed by un
initiated constituents to have bejn delivere!
to other than empty benches on an " oil'
day," and circulated in pamphlet form to
the burdening o( the mails an! the disgiss
of decent minds. The departure of t'i :
franking privilege would hard'y ovcrour
the desire of thosj who want our eagle t.
spread over Cuba to keep up their sealing
of "slosh" thrjuga the mails.
Congress will a!s have a great opportu
nity of avoiding the diingof much injury to
the country by killing the var:ous w'.id
schemes of Kanawha canals and Col or.id
irrigations and of a-sumptjn of the de 'its
of about everybody that owes anything. 1 i
a rigii scrutiny of every bid that vet s
money can Congress best help the financial
difficulties that b set us.
There is the avoidance of Credit Mobilier
morality and lying to be seen to, and there is
tb.3 repeal of the salary grab bill. Mr. Hale
will give gentlemen a chance to walk right
up and put themselves on record.
Many of the leading men in each great
party look to this session as one that shalt
in great measure map out the political charts
for the next two or three years. The Re
publicans look to retrieve their somewhat
shattered reputation as a pirty, and the
Democrats have about conclude! to try an l
get a reputation themselves. We wish them
all success. We rej lieei to sje the resolu
tions of the New York Democratic State
Convention when they were too virtuous be
fore election to have a man who even took
back pay, on their State committee. It
would be amusing if it was n't sad to look
fti the companion picture after the election
the Democratic Congressional caucus. There
Fernando Wood, salary grabber, received
the nomination foe speaker, and Ilolmau
who ventured a word agaiust salary grabbing
was denounced by Eldredge as a low dema
gogue. The difference between the New
York convention and the Congressional cau
cus was that the members of the former did
not share in the profits of the salary bill.
The members of the caucus di share in the n
and mean to keep doing so.
We hope there are honest Democrats enough
in Congress to give substantial help to those
of the Republican members who will neither
steal themselves nor allow others to steal,
under whatsoever specious pretence the
money is to be seized. The majority of the
Democrats in Congress shewed their true
colors in their course at their caucus
Charles A. liluredge of V lseonsin was a fit
spokesman for them. He is a disgrace to his
native State of Vermont and to the State's
prison district of Wisconsin which he rep-
California Senatorship. Senator Cas-
serly of California has sent in to Gov. Boctb
his resignation as U. S. Senator from that
State. Casserly by this action has doubtless
sought to embarrass the Governor who is
himself a prominent candidate for the place,
and naturally expects to be elected when the
Legislature shall meet. The political combi
nations of the Golden State aro thus placed
in a peculiar position. Governor Booth will
be under the necessity of appointing a Sena
tor to fill the unexpired term ; but as Gov.
Booth is an acknowledged candidate for the
office, at the next election, he will be forced
to appoint some one, who, if he is a man of
capacity, can hardly fail to be his rival for
the next term. It will be a great temptation
to appoint an inferior man, but Governor
Booth is an honest man, and will, we are
convinced, do his duty in this respeot, even
if it should be at the cost of raising up a
powerful opponent.
President's Message. We give entire in
this paper President Grant's message sub
mitted to Congress yesterday. It came so
late and takes so much space that we defer
any comments. It contains an account of
tl e p.aeeiul solution of the Virginias question.
Presidents Message.
INTRODUCTORY.
To the Senate and House of Representatives :
The year that has passed since the submis
sion of my last message to Congress has.
especially during the latter part ot it, been
an eventful one to the country. In t'.e
midst of great national prosperity a finan
cial crisis has occured that has brough t low
fortunes of gigautic proportions. Politica
partizanship has almost ceased to exist, es
pecially in the agricultural regions, and
finally the capture upon the high seas of a
vessel bearing our flag has for a time threit
ened the most serious consequences, and has
agitated the public mind from one end of the
country to the other, but this happily now
is in the course of satisfactory adjustment
honorable to both nations concerned. The
relations of the United States however, with
most of the other powers continue to be
friendly and cordial With France, Germany,
Russia. Italy and the minor European pow
ers, with Brazil and most of the South
American Republics, and with Japan noth
ing h38 occurred during the year to demand
special notice. The correspondence between
the Department of State and various diplo
matic representatives in or from those coun
tries is transmitted herewith.
THE VIENNA EXPOSITION.
In executing the will of Congress, as ex
pressed in its joint resolution of the 14th of
February lasr, and in accordance with the
provisions of the resolution, a number of
practical citizens, of scientific men, and ot
honorary commissioners were authorized to
attend the e xposition at Vienna as commiss
ioners on the part of the United States. It
is believed that we have obtained the object
which Congress had iu view when it passed
the joint resolution, in order to enable the
people of the United States to participate in
the advantages of the International Expo
sition of the products of agriculture, manu
factures and tbe fine arts to be held at Vi
enna. I take pleasure in adding that the
American exhibitors have received a gratify
ing number of diplomas and of medals.
During the exposition a conference was held
at Vienna, for the purpose of consultation
on the systems prevailing in different coun
tries for the perfection of inventions.
I authorized a representative from the
Patent Offi:c to be present at Vienna at the
time when this conference was to take
place, in order to aid as far as he might in
securing any possible additional protection
to American inventors in Europe, ihe re
port of this agent will be laid before Con
gress. RELATIONS WITH CHINA.
It is my pleasant duty to announce to
Congress that the Emperor of China on at
taining his majority received the diplomatic
representatives of the Western powers in
person. An account of these ceremonies,
and of the interesting discussions which
preceded them, will bo found in the docu
ments transmitted herewith. The accom
panying1 papers show that some advance,
although slight, has been madi during the
ast year towards the suppression of the
infamous Chinese Coolie trade. I recom
mend Congress to inquire whether aditiona)
legislation be not nieeded on this subject.
THE GENEVA AWARD.
The money awarded to the United States
by the tribunal ot Arbitration at Geneva,
was paid by Her Majesty's Government a
few days in advance of the time when it
would have become payable according to the
terms of the treaty. '
Incompliance with the provisions of the
act of March 3, 1873, it was at once paid
into the treasury and used to redeem so far
as it might the public debt of the United
States, and the amount redeemed was invest
ed in a five per cent. Registered Bond of
the United States for filteen millions five
hundred thousand dollars, which is now held
by the Secretary of State subjec: to the
future disposition of Congress.
I renew my recommendation made at the
opening of the last session of Congress, that
a commission be created for the purpose of
auditing and determining tbe amounts o!
the several direct losses growing out of the
destruction of vessels and their cargoes by
the Alabama, tbe Florida, or the Shenandoah
wltar iMvin Melbourne, for whtob. tho suff
erers have received no equivalent or compen
sation, and of ascertaining the names of the
persons entitled to receive compensation for
the same, making the computation upon the
basis indicated by the Tribunal of Arbitra
tion at Geneva, and that the payment of
such losses be authorized to an extent not to
1 exceed the awards ot the Tribunal at Geneva.
THE BRITISH BOUNDARY.
By an act approved on the 14th day of
February last, Congress made provisions for
completeing jointly, with an officer or com
missioner to be named by Her British Majes
ty, the determination of so much of the
houndary line between the territory cf the
United St:tes and the possessions of Great
Brittain as was left uncompleted by the com
missioners appointed under the acts of Con
gress ot August 11, ISob. Under the pro
visions of this act the Northwest water boun
dary of tbe United States has been deter
mined and marked in accordance with the
award of ihe Emperor of Germany.
A protocol and a copy of the map upon
which the line was thus marked are contained
in the papers submitted herewith.
I also transmit a copy of the report of the
Commissioners for marking the northern
boundary between the United States and the
British possessions west of the Lake of the
Woods, of the operations of the Commission
during the past season. Surveys have beea
made to a point 497 miles west of the Like
of the Woods, leaving about 350 miles to be
surveyed, the field work of which can be
completed during the next season. The mix
ed Commission organized under the provis
ions of the Treaty of Washington for settling
and determining the claims ot citizens oi
either power against the other, arising from
acts committed against their persons or pro
perty during the period between April 13,
1861, and April 9, 1865, made its final award
on the 25th day of September last.
It was awarded that the Government of
the United States should pay to the Govern
ment of her Brittanic Majesty within twelve
months from tbe date of the award the sum
of $1,929,819 in gold. The Commission
disallowed or dismissed all other claims of
British subjects agaiDSt the United States.
The amount of tbe claims presented by the
British subjects, but disallowed or dismissed,
is understood to be about $93,000,000. It al
so disallowed all the claims of citizens of the
United States against Great Britain which
were referred to it.
I recommend the early passage of an act
appropriating the amount necessary to pay
this award against tho United Spates. 1
have caused to be communicated to the Gov
ernment of the King of Italy thanks of this
Government for the eminent services render
ed by Count Corti as the third Commission
er on this Commission, with dignity, learn

requiring great labor, constant patience, to

WAR CLAIMS .
I recommend legislation to create a special
court to consist of three judges who shall be
empowered to hear and deteimine all claims
of aliens upon the United States arisin ' from
acts committed against theit persons or pro
perly uurmg me insurrection.

MT,.l . 11 J 1 r. n .J . .
ii aeuiugwu wm cuuuueu to claims oi xSntisn
subjects, arising during the period named in
the Treaty ; but it is also understood that
there are other British cliims of a similar
nature, arising after the 9th of April, 1865,
md it is known that other claims of a like
natnre are advanced by citizens or subjects
of other powers. It is desirable to have these
claims also examined and disposed of.
THE ATHIXKSE WAR.
Official information is being received here
from the Dutch Government of a state of war
between the King of the Netherlands and the
Sultan of Acheen. The officers of the United
States who were near the seat of the war
were instructed to observe an impartial neu
trality ; it is believed that they have done
so.
THE MEXICAN COMMISSION.
The joint commission under the conven
tion with Mexico of 1868 has again been
legally prolonged, and has resumed its busi
ness, which it is hoped may be brought to an
early conclusion.
THX MEXICAN CLAIMS COMMISSION.
The distinguished representative cf Her
lirittanie Majesty at Wasningtoa nas Juuuij
consented, with tho approval of his govern
ment, to assume tbe arduous and responsi
ble duties of umpire in this Commission,
and to lend the weight of his character and
name to such decisions as may not receive
the acquiescence of both the arbitrators ap
pointed by the respective Governments.
The commissioners appointed pursuant to
the authority ot Congress to examine into
the nature and extent of the forays of tres
passes from that country upon herds of Texas,
have made a report, which will be submitted
for your consideration. The Venezuelan
Government has been apprised of the sense
of Congress in regard to the award of the
Joint Commission under the convention of
the 25tb of April, 1806, as expressed in the
act of the 25th of February last. It is ap
prehended that that Government does not
realize the character of its obligati ins under
that convention. As there ss reason to be
lieve, however, that this hesitancy in recog
nizing them springs in part at least from real
diffisulty in discharging them in connection
with its obligations to other Governments,
the expediency of further forbearance on our
part is believed to be worthy of your consid
eration. The Ottoman Government and that of
Egypt have latterly shown a disposition to
relieve foreign consuls of the judicial powers
which heretofore they have exercised in the
Turkish dominions by organiLing, other tri
bunals. As Congress however, has by law
provided for tho discharge of judicial func
tions by consuls of the United States in that
quarter, under tbe treaty of 1830, I have not
felt ready formally to accept the proposed
change without the assent ot Congress, whose
decision upon tbe subject at as early a pe
riod ts may be convenient, is earnestly re
quested. PROTECTORATE FOR ST. DOMISG0.
1 transmit herewith for the consideration
and determination of Congress, an applica
tion of the Republic of Santo Domingo.to this
Government to exercise a protectorate over
that Republic.
NEW TREATIES.
Since the adjournment ol Congress the fol
lowing treaties with foreign powers have been
proclaimed: A Naturalization Convention
with Denmark; a Convention with Mexico
for renewing the Claims Commission ; a Con
vention of Friendship, Commerce and Lxtradi
tion with the Orange Free State, and a Na
turalization Convention with Equador.
A recommendation was made in my rues
tage of December, 1870, that Congress
authorize the Postmaster General to issue
all commissions to officials appointed through
his Department. ?
AMERICANS ABROAD.
1 invite the earnest attention of Congress
to the existing laws of the United States re
specting expatriation and the election ot na
tionality by individuals. Many citizens of
tbe U. S. reside permanently abroad with
their families under the provisions of the act
approved Feb. 10, 1855. The children of
such persons are to be deemed and taken to
be citizens of the United States, but the
rights of citizenship are not to descend to
persons whose fathers never resided in the
United States. It thus happens that persons
who have never resided within the United
States have been enabled to put forward a
pretension to the protection of the United
States against the claim of military service
of the Government under whose protection
they were born and have been reared ; in
some cases naturalized citizens of the United
States have returned to the land of their birth
with intent to remain there, and their child
ren, the issue of a marriage contracted there
after their return and who have never been
in tne cnitea states, nave laid claim to our
protection when the lapse of many years has
imposed upon them the duty ot military ser
vice to the only Government which had ever
known them personally. Until tho year
1808 it was left embarrassed by conflicting
opinions of eourts and of jourists to deter
mine now tar the doctrine ol perpetual alle
giance, derived from our former colonial re
lations with Great Britain, was applicable to
American citizens. Congress then wisely
swept these doubts away by enacting that
any declaration, instruction, opiniou, order
or decision ot any officer of this Government
which denies, restricts, impairs or questions
the l ight of expatriation is inconsistent with
me lunuamental principles ot this govern
ment ; but Congress did not indicate in that
etttute, nor has it since done so, what sets
are to be deemed to work expitriation. For
my own guidance in determining sucti ques
tions, requirel under the provisions ot the
Constitution obtained the opinfon, in writ
ing, of the principal officer in each of the
executive departments upon certain questions
relating to tins subj-.-ct.
The result satistiedme tbat further legisla
tion has become necessary. I therefore com
mend the subject to the careful consideration
oi congress, and I transmit herewith copies
of the several opinions of tbe principal offi ;ers
of the executive departments, together with
other correspondence and pertinent infor
mation on the same subject.
The United States, who led the way in the
overthrow ol the feudal doctrine of pcrpetua
allegiance, are among the last to indicate
how their own citizens may elect another
nationality. The papers submitted herewith
indicate what is necessary to place us on
par with other nations in liberality of legisla
tion on tnis international question.
We have already in our treaties assented
to the principles which would need to be em
bodied in the laws intended to accomplish
such results. v e have agreed that citizens
of the United States may ceasa to be citizens
and may voluntarily render allegiance to
otber powers. We have agreed that resi
dence in a foreign land without intent to re
turn shall of itself work expatriation. We
have agreed in some instances on the length
of time necessary for such intent. I invite
Cungress now to make out and define when
and how expatriation car,b3 accomplished ; to
regulate by law the condition of American
women marrying foreigners ; to fix the status
of children born in a foreign country, of
American parents, residing mare or less per
manently abroad; and to make rules.for de
termining such other kindred points as may
seem best to Congress.
CONGRATULATIONS FOR SPANISH REPUBLIC.
In compliance with the request of Con
gress, 1 transmitted to the American Minis
ter at Madrid, with instructions to present
it to the Spanish Government, the joint res
olution approved on the 31 of March last,
tendering to the people of Spain, in the
name and on the behalf of the American
people, the congratulations of Congress up
on the effort to consolidate in Spain the prin
ciples of universal liberty in a republicau
form of Government. The existence of this
new Republic was inaugurated by striking
the fetters from the slaves at Port Rico.
This beoificent measure was followed by the
release of several thousand persons illegally
held as slaves in Cuba. Next the Captain
General of that colony was deprivel of tba
power to set aside the order of his superiors
at Madrid which bad pertained to tbe office
since 1825. The sequestered estate of Ameri
can citizens which had been the cause of
long and frequent correspondence were or
dreed to bo restored to their owners. All
these liberal steps were taken in the face of
violent opposition directed by tbe reaction
ary slaveholders of Havana who are vainly
striving to stay the march of ideas which
has terminated slavery in Cnristendom, Cuba
only excepted. Unhappily however, this
baneful influence has thus tar succeeded in
defeating the efforts of all liberal minded
men in Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba and
in preventing the promised ref irm in that
island. The struggle for political suprem
acy continues; the pro-slavery and aristro
craticpar;y in Cuba is gradually arraying it
self in more and more open hostility and de
fiance Of the Home Government while it still
maintains a political connection with the
Republic in the Peninsula, and although
usurping and defying the authority of tbe
Home Government where ever such us-
urption and defiance tends in the direction
of oppression or of the maintenance of
abuses, it is still a power in Madrid and reo
ognized by tho Government. Thus, an ele
ment more dangerous to continued colonial
relations between Cuba and Spain, than that
wLioh inspired the insurrection at 1 an
element opposed to granting any relief from
misrule and abuse, with no aspirations after
freedom, commanding no sympathies in gen
erous breasts asking to rivetitill stronzerltbe
suackhs of Itvery and opprestio i, has seized
many ot tbe emblems ot power in Uuba, and
under professions of loyalty to the mother
country, is exhausting the resources of ths
island and is doing acts which are at variance !
with those- ot justice, ot lioermiiy aud ot
right, which give nobility of character to a
Republic.
la tne interests of humanity, ot civiliza
tion and ot progress, it is to be hoped that
this evil influence may be soon averted.
THE VIRQINIU3 AFFAIR.
The steamer Virsinius was on tbe 26th day
of September, 1870, duly registered at New
lork as a part ot the commercial marine of
the United States, On the 4th of October,
180, having received the certificate of her
register in tbe usual legal form, she sailed
from the port of New York and hus not since
been in the territorial jurisdiction of the
United States.
On tbe 31st day of October last, while
sailing mnder tho flag of the United States
on the high seas, she was forcibly seized by
the Spanish gunboat Tornado, and was car
ried into tbe port of Santiago de Cuba, where
many ot her passengers and crew were inhu
manly, and so far at least as relates to those
who were citizens of the United States were
without due process of law, put to death.
It is a well established principle asserted
by the United States from the beginning of
their national independence, recognized by
Great Britain and other maritime powers.
and stated by the Senate in a resolution
passed unanimously on the 10th of June,
1308, that American vessels on the high seas.
in times of peace, bearing the American flag,
remain under the jurisdiction of the country
to which they belong, and therefore any vis
Station, molestation or detention of such ves
sel by force or by the exhibition of force on
the part of a foreign power is in derogation
of the sovereignty of the United States, In
accordance with this principle the restora
tion oi the V lrginius, and the surrender ot
the survivors of her passengers and crew.
and a due reparation to our fiig, and the
punishment of tbe authorities who had been
guilty of these illegal acts of violence were
demanded.
SPAIN COMPLIES WITH OUR DEMANDS.
The Spanish Government has recognized
the justice of the demands, and has arranged
for the immediate delivery of the vessel, and
for the surrender of the survivors of the
passengers and crew, and for a salute to the
flag, and for proceedings looking to the pun
ishment of those who may be proved to have
been guilty of illegal acts of violence to
ward citizens of the United States, and also
toward indemnifying those who may be
shown to be entitled to indemnity. A cojy
of a protocjl of a conference between the
Secretary of State and the Spanish Minister,
in which the terms of this arrangement were
agreed to, is transmitted herewith.
The correspondence on this subject with
the Legation of the United States liy cypher
and by cable needs the verification of the
actual text of the correspondence. It has
seemed t me to be due to the importance ot
the case not to submit this correspondence
until the actual text can be received by mail.
It is expected shortly, and will b3 submitted
when received.
In taking leave of this subject for the
present, I wish to renew the expression of
my conviction, that the existence ot African
slavery in Cuba is a principal cause of the
lamentable condition of t:ie island. I do
not doubt that Congress shares with me the
hope that it will soon disippear, and that
peace and prosperity may follow its abjli
lition. The embargoing of American e-tates
in Cuba, the cruelty tj American citizens de
tected in no act of hostility to the Spanish
Government, the murdering of prisoners
taken with arms in their hands, and finally
the capture upon the high seis of a vessel
sailing under the United States flag, and
bearing a United States registry, has culmi
nated in an outburst of indignation that has
seemed for a time to threat.-n war.
NAVAL PREPARATION'S
Pending negotiations between the UniteJ
States and the G jvernment oi Spain, on the
subject of the capture, I have authoriz;d the
Secretary of the Xavy to put our n ivy oo a
war footing, to the extent, ht least, of the
entire annual apppropriati m for that branch
of the service, trusting to Congress, and the
opinion of the American people to ju?ti(y
my action.
constitutional amendments.
Assuming from the action of the last Con
gress in appointing a Committee on Privil
eges and Elections to prepare and report t
tins Con. rers a constitutional amend nent to
provide a better method ,,f electing the
Pse-i lent and Vice President of the United
States, and also irom tne necessity ot such
amendment that there will b; su'xuitte 1 to
the State Legislature for ratification such
an improvement in our Cons:itution, I sug
gest two others lor your consideration :
First, to authorize the Executive to ap
prove of so much of any measure passing the
two Houses of Congress, as his judguient
may dictate, without approving r lie whole,
the disapprove! portion or portions to h,
subjected to the same rules as now, to wit :
to be relerred biek to the house in which the
measure or measures originated, an! il
pass d by a two-thirds vote of both H his -s,
then to become a law, without the appr val
of the President. I wouftudi to tois a
provision that there should be no legislation
by congress during the last tweuty-tour
hours of its sitting, except upon vetoes, in
order to give the Executive an opportunity
to examine and approve or disipprove the
bills understanding.
Second to provide by amend nent tint
when an extra session of Congress is conven
ed by executive proclamation, legislation
during the continuance ol such extra session
shall be eonhaed to such subjects as the Ex
ecutive may bring before it from tine to
time in writing. Tne advantages to be
gained 1y these two amendments are obvious
One session in,each year is provide! for hy
the Constitution, in which there are no re
strictions as to the subjects of legislation by
congress.
It more are rep! red it is aiiv iys in the
power of Congress dating their term ot office
to provide for sessi ,.;s at any time. The
first of these amendments would protect the
public against the many abuses aud wiste of
public moneys, which creep into the appro
priation bills, and other iiupirtant measures
passing during the expiring hours of Con
gress, to which otharwise due consideration
cannot be given.
TREASURY" DEPARTMENT.
The leceipts of the government from all
sources tor the last fiscal year were $333,
738,204, and expenditures on all accounts',
$290,345,243 thus showing in excess ot
receipts over expenditures of $13,392 950
But
t is not probable that this favorable ex
hiint will be shown for the present fiscal
year. Indeed it is very doubtful, whether,
except with great economy on the part oi
Congress in making appropriations and the
same economy in administering the various
departments of government, the revenue will
not fall short ot meeting actual expenses, in
cluding the interest on the public debt. 1
commend to Congress such economy, and
point out two sources where, it seems to me
it might commence, to wit: in the appropri
ations for public buildings in the many cities
where work has not been commenced, in the
appropriations for river and harbor improve
ments in those localities where the improve
ments are of but little benefit to general com
merce, and for fortifications. There is a still
more fruitful source of expenditure, which
I will point out later in tins message. I re
fer to the method of manufacturing claims
fr losses incurred in suppressing "the late
rebellion. I would not , be understood
here as opposing the erection of good sub
stantial and even ornamental buildings by
the Government wherever such buildings are
needed.
In iaet I approve of the Government own
ing its own buildings in all sections of the

aad for ihe Cabinet, thus setting an example
. ,. . L . 1. ' I i
ou ii.e oiutes, nuicii may inuuee them to
erect buildings lor their Senators, but I
would have this work conducted at a time
when the revenues ot the couutry wouli have
abundantly justify it,
The revenues have materially fallen off for
the first five months of tbe present fiscal year
from what they were expected to produce,
owing to the general panic now prevailing
which commenced about the middle of Sep
tember last. The full effect of this disas.er,
if it should not prove ' a blessing in dis'
guise " is yet to be demonstrated. In either
event it is your duty to heed the lesson and
provide by wise and well considered legisla
tion, as far as it lies in your power, a uin t'
its rec jrrence, and to take aivaota'e of all'
benefit that may nave accrued. '
SPECIE PAYMENTS.
My own judgment is that however much
individuals may have suffered! one long step
has been taken toward specie payments;
that we can never have permanent prosperi
ty until a specie basis is reached, and that a
specie basis cannot be reached and maintain
ed until our exports, exclusive of gold, pay
for our imports, interest due abroad and
other specie obligations, or so nearly so as
to leave an appreciable accumulation of the
precious metals in the country from the pro
ducts of our own mines.
The development of the mines of precious
metals during the past year, and the pros
pective development of them for years to
come, are gratifying in their results. Could
one-half ot the gold extracted from the mines
be retained at home our advance toward
specie payments would De rapid, lo in
crease our exports, sufficient "currency is re
quired to keep all tbe industries of the coun
try employed; without this national j-as well
as individual bankruptcy must ensue. Un
due inflation on the other hand, while it
might give temporary relief, would only lead
to inflttion of prices, the impossibility of
competing in our markets for tbe products
of home skill and labor, and repeated renew
als of present experiences. Elasticity of our
circulating medium therefore, and just
enough of it to transact the legitimate busi
ness of the country and to keep all industries
employed is what is most to be desired. Tbe
exact medium is specie, the recognized me
dium of exchange the world over, that ob
tained we shall have a currency of an exact
degree of elasticity.
If there be too much of it for the legiti
mate purposes of trade and commerce it will
flow out of the country, if too little the re
verse wnl result, lo hold what we nave
and to appreciate our currency to that stand
ard is a problem deserving of the most se
rious consideration of Congress.
The experience of the present panic has
proven that the cuirency of the country,
based as it is upon the credit of the country,
is the best that has ever been devised. Us
ually in times of such trials, currency has
become worthless, or so much depreciated in
value as to iutlate the values of all the neces
saries of life, as compared with the currency.
Every one holding it has been anxious to
dispose of it on any terms. Now we witness
the reverse. Hollers of currency hoard it as
they did gold in former experiences of a like
nature.
It is patent to the most casual observer
that muen more currency or money is re
quired to transact the legitimate trade ot the
country during the fall and winter months
when the vast crops aie being removed than
during the balance of the year.
With our present system the amount in
the country remains the same throughout
the entire year, resulting in an accumulation
of all the surjdus capital of the country in a
lew centres, when not employed in the mov
ing of the crops, tempted thereby by offer of
interest on call loans. Interest being paid,
this surplus capital must earn this interest
pai i, with a profit.
Being subject to call, it cannot be loaned,
only in part at best, to the merchant or man
utacturer for a fixed term ; hence, uo matter
how much currency there might be in the
country it would be absorbed, prices keep
ing pace with the volume and panics, striu
geney and disasters would ever be recurring
wiili the autumn.
Elesticity in our monetary system is the
object to be obtaiued first, and next to that as
lar as as possible, a prevention ot the use of
other people's money in stock and other
species of speculation.
INTEREST ON DEPOSITS.
To prevent the latter it seems to me that
one great step wouid be taken by prohibit
ing the national banks from piying interest
on deposits, by requiring them t) hold tbeir
reserves in their own vaults, and by forcing
t.'iem into resumption, thonh it would be
n only legal tender notes. For this purpose
i duuiu suggest me esiai'iisnmem oi clearing-houses.
For your consideration to secure the for
mer many plans have been suggested, most
it not all ot which look to me more like ni
dation on the one baud, or compelling the
Government on the other to jay interet
without corresponding benefits upon the
surplus funds ot llie country during tt.e sea
sons when otherwise unemployed.
I submit for jour cjiieuJivaiion whether
this difficulty might not be overcome by au
thorizing the Secretary of the Trea-ury to
issue at any time to the national banks ol
issue any amount of tlnir notes below a
tix.d percentage of their issue, say 40
percent., upon the bauks depositing with
the Treasurer o! the United States an
amount of Government Bonds fqial ta the
auiouut ol notes dciuindod, the banks to for
feit to the Government, siy 4 per cent, ol
the interest accruing on the bonds so pledg
ed, during toe time they remain with the
l'reis.irir as security Jor the increased eir
eulatioii, the bonds sj pledged to be redeema
ble ty tne baniis at their pleasure, either in
the whole or in pirt by returning their own
bil.s ,or c mediation to an amount equal to
the lace of the bonds withdrawn.
1 would further suggest tor your conside
ration the propriety ot authorizing national
bauks to douioisu their standing issue at
pleasure by returning lor caneell ttion their
own bil s and withdrawing so many United
States bonds its are pledged lor t ie bills re
turned. Iu view of the great actual contraction
that has taken place in tne currency, and
the comparative eojiraetion cjutinuaity g
ingon.uue to tho increase ot population,
the increase of m tnufaetures and ail the in
dustries, 1 do not believe thit there is too
much ot it now for tho dullest period of the
year.
Indeed, if clearing houses shoeld be ts
tabiished, t lus lorcing redemption, it is a
question lor your cjutideraiion whether
oanitiug should not be made Irce, retaining
all the safeguards now orginiz.-d to secure
bifl holders.
Iu any modification of the present laws
regula ing National Banks as a lurtber step
towards preparing ior the resumption of
specie payments 1 invite your attention to a
consideration oi the propriety of txieting
iroua them the retention as a part ot then
reserve either tho whole or a part of the
gold interest accruing upon the bonds pledg
ed as security for their issue. I have not
redected enough on the bearing this might
have in proJucing a scarcity o'c coin with
which to pay duties on imports, to give it
my positive reeoiumendatiou, but your at
tention is invited to the subject.
CDRREXCV CONTRACTION.
During the last four years tho
has hejn contracted directlj' by
currency
iue wun-
drawal ot the three per eent. certificates,
compound interest notes and 7-30 bonds out
standing on the 4th of Maron, 18G9, all of
which took the place of leal tenders in the
bank reserves to tho extent ol sixty-three
million dollars. During the same perioi
there has bejn a much larger comparative
contraction of the currency.
Tne population of tbe country has largely
increase i ; more than twenty-five thousand
miles ot railroad have beets built, requiring
the active use of capital to operate them ;
millions ot aeres of land have been opened
to cultivation, requiring capital to move the
products; manufactures have multiplied be
yond all precedent in the sa ne period o
time, requiring capital, weekly, for the pay
ment o! wages and for the purchase of ma
terial, and probably the largest of all com
parative contraction arises from the organ
izing ot iree i.xoor id tne South. Wow every
laborer thus receives his wages, and lor want
ul savings banks the greater prt of such
wages is carried in the pocket or hoarded
until required Ior use.
Tuei-e suggestions aro thrown out for your
consideration witnout any recommendation
that they shall be adopted literally, but
hoping that the Dest method will be arrived
at to secure such an elasticitv of tbe cur
rency as will keep employed all tbe indus
tries of the country and prevent such an
inflation as will pus off indefinitely tbe re
sumption of specie payments, an object so
devoutly to be wished lor by all, and by none
more earnestly than the class of people must
directly interestei those who earn their
bread by tho sweat of their brow. The de
cisions ot Congress on tins subject will have
tbe hearty support ot the r,ieeut've.
THE SHIPBUILDING INTERESTS.
In previous mess iges I have called atten
tion to the decline in American shipbuilding,
and recommended such legislation as would
secure to us our proportion ot the caryiDg
trade, stimulated oy niga races and aa abun-
dance of freight. The progress for tbe last
year inshipbuilding has been very satisfac
tory. There has been an increase of about three
per cent, in the amount transported in Ameri
can vessels over tbe amount of last year.
With the reduced cost of material which
has taken place, it may reasonably bo hoped
ihit this progress will be maintained and
e en increased.
However, as we pay about eighty million
dollars per annum to. foreign vessels for tbe
transportation of our surplus products to a
market, thus increasing the balance of trade
against us to this amount, tlw subject is one
worthy of your serious consideration.
INTERNAL TRANSPORTATION.
Cheap transportation " is a subject that
has attracted the attention of both producers
and consnmers for tbe past lew years, and
lixs Aonirihntpii'to. if it has not been tbe
direct cause ol. the recent panic and strin
geocy. As Congress at its last session ap
pointed a special committee to investigate
this whole subject during vacation and report
at this session I have nothing to recotnm ni
until their report is read. Ihere is one
work, however, of a national character in
which the greater portion of the East and
West, theJNorthand the South, are equally
interested, to which I ffill invite your atten
tion. The State of New York has a canal connect
ing Lake Erie with the tide water on the
Hudson river, and the State of Illinois has a
similar work connecting Lake Michigan with
navigable waters on the Illinois river, thus
making a water communication inlaud be
ween the East and the West and South.
These great artificial water courses are the
properry of the States thiough which they
pass, and pay toll to those States. Would it
not be wise statesmanship to pledge these
States that if they will open these canals for
the passage ol large vessels the General Gov
ernment will look after aud keep in naviga
ble condition the great public highways with
which they connect, to wit, tbe overslaugh
on the Hudson, the St. Clair flats and the
Illinois and Mississippi Rivers.
This wouid be a national work, one ol
irreat value to the producers ot the West and
Sjuth, in giving them cheap transportation
for their piodue s to the seaboard and a mar
ket ; and te consumers in the Eist, in giving
them cheaper loo J, particularly those arti
cles of tool vwm h do not find a foreign mar
ket, and the prices of which, therefore, are
not regulated ly foreign demands.
The advantages of such a work are to J ob
vious for argument. I submit tl,e subject
to you, therefore, without further comment.
TMADE WITH SOUTU AMERICA.
In attempting to regain our lost commerce
and carrying trade I have heretofore called
your attention to the States south of the
United States, offering a field where much
might be aicomplisbed to further this ob
ject. 1 suggest that a small appropriation be
made, accompanied with authority, for the
Navy to tit out a naval vessel to ascend the
Auuzjn river to the mouth ol the Medcira,
thence to explore that river and its tributa
ries luto Bolivia, aud to report to Congrees
at its ntst Befcsion or as soon as practicable
the accessibility of ti e country by water, its
resources and the population so reached.
Such an exploration will cost but little; it
can do no harm, and may result in establish
ing a trade oi value to both nations
In lurther connection with the Treasury
Department I would recommend a revision
una cod.tieation of the tariff laws and the
opening ot more mints for coining money,
with authority to cjio for such nations as
imy apply.

ii...i,..n.. huv taken ulace between the Indi
ans and whiles during the past year, and probably
will continue to do so uutil each race appreciates
th. ti... mhr has riuhta which must be respected.
The policy has been to collect the Indians as rap
idly as possib'e on reservations, and as lar as prao
licable within what is known as the Indian Terri
tory, and to teach them the art of civilization and
selt'-suppoit. When found off their reservations
and endangering the peace and safety of the whi es

PENSIONS.
There was pail daring the last lise.il year for
pensions including the expenses of disburse ent,
i ls.ac; 62, being an amount less by sJ.'siOoa ys
than was ex ieii-b d for ihe sin; purpose. L n pi e
ceding year. Although the st.iteme.i t of expendi
tiue would in lica'e a material reduction in amount
compared with the pieceding year, it is believed
thai the changes m the pen-iuu laws at the last ses
sion of Congress wnl ausorb that amount the cur
rent vear
At 'the close of the last fiscal year there were on
the pension rolls !M,S'H invalid military pensioners
and lli.css widows, orphans and dependent widows
t deceased soldiers, m iking a total of Ilia-class

tne l ist llscal year oftil2. nunng tho last year
the names of hi 405 pensioners were ad led lo the
ioIIs, and M 223 names were dropped therefrom for
various causes.
The system adopted for the-detection of frauds
agaiu-t the Gov inment in me matter of pensions
has been productive ol satistactory results, t.ul
legislation is i.eeee I to provide, if possible, against
the perpetration ol such trauds 111 lulurc.
EuicartoNAL,
Thp evidently increasinir interest in the cause of
education, is a most encouraging feature in the gen
era 1 111 ogress and prosperity .!' the country , and
the U urea a of t.ducatiou is earuest in us efforts to
give proper direction to the new appliances, and the
tue educators of the country in their great work.
THiJ CENSl'S.
increased iacuities w men are oetug uuerco. 1.0 am
The ninth c?nsus has been completed and the re
port thereof published ami distributed anil the work
ing force of the r.tireau disbanded. Tne secretary
of the Interior reuewshis recommendations for a
census to be taken in ls7o, to which subject the at
tention of Congress is invited.
The original suggestion iu that behalf has met
with the general upproval of the country and even
if it te not deemed advisiblc al present to provide
for a regular quinquennial census a census taken
in lS7o. the report of which could be completed and
published beiore the looth anniversary of our inde
pendence w iuld be especially interesting and valu
able as snowing tne progress 01 me country during
the first century ot our national existence.
It is believed, however, that a regular census
every five years w -uld be ol substantial benefit to
the country, inasinncli as our growth hitherto has
been so rapid that the results of the decennial cen
sus are necessarily unreliable as a basis of esti
mates for ihe laiter years ol a decenuial period.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
The District of Colutnbit, under the very enicien
management of the Governor of the rioard of rublic
Vora of this District the city of Washinon is rapidly
assumine the appe ranee of a capital of which the nation
may well be proad, tr.rm being a mo-t .tnsightly place
three years ago, disagreeable to pas through in summer
in consequence ot the dust arising Irom unpaved streets
and 1 in, -st impassable in the winter from the mud it is
now one ot the most sightly cities in the country aud
can boast of being the best paved.
The work has been done systematically, the plan of
grades, location ul sewers, at r and gas mains being
determined upon before the work was commenced, thus
securing permanency when completed I question
whether so much h .s ever been accomplished beiore in
any mericai city for he same expenditure.
The Government having large reservations in the city
and the Nation st large having an interest in their
capital, I reeommend a liberal policy toward the Dis
trict of olumbia and that the Government should bear
its just share of ihe expense of ttiese improvements.
Every citizen visiting the capital feels a pride in its grow
ing beau y and tbat he, tiro, is part owner in the in vest
ments made here.
I would suggest to Congress the propriety of n--!Tnntine
the establishment in the District of an l- u ai .n of
learning or University of the highest class Irv th- dona
tion of land. There is no place better an led for such
an institution thin! the Xa ional apitol There is no
otber place in which every citizen is so directly inter
ested. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
In three successive messages to Congress I have
called attention to tbe subject of Civil service Reform
ctiun has been taken so f r as to authorize the appoint
ment of a board to devise rules go erning methods of
m king appointments and promotions ; bat there never
has been any etion making lhee rules binding or even
entitled to obwrv nee where persons desire the app.in:
mentof a friend or the removal of an official who m iy
be disagree ble to them
To have any rules effective they roust have the ac
quiescence of Congress a well as of the Executive. 1
ecnmmend. therefore, the sunject to your attention,
and suggest that a special committee of 1 oneress miirhi
confer with the Civil Service Board during tbe present
aessinn foi tbe purpose of devising such rules as can be
tnaintataed, and which will secure the services of honest
nd captble officials, and which will also protect them
in a degree of independence while in office. Proper
rules will protect Coogrem us well as the Elecuote
from much needle's persecution, and will prove of 'great
value to the public at large.
ADSI66IOX Of COLORADO.
I recommend for your favorable cunsideratioB ibe
passage of aa enabling act for the admittance of Colo
rado ss a State in the Cmon. It prastwi .11 the ele
ments of a prosperous State, agricultural and mineral,
and 1 believe bas a population to justify such admiwiua.
4 SYSTIM OI IRR:GATIoV.
In connection with that I would also recommend be
encouragement of a canal, lor purposes of irrigation, fn.m
the Eastern slope of th Hoc It y Mountains to tne Hisxur
river. As a rule 1 am opposea 10 a i.irtner donatio ot
public lands for internal imp ovemetits owned and con
trolled by private corporation, but in Uu instance I
would mike an except! in between lire Missouri river
and tne Kocky Mountains
There is an arid belt ol public land from three hun
dred ;io fit e hundred miles in w idth perfectly elea
for the occupation of mm for wi n of audi -icnt raiu to
isscure tbe growth of any pr.rJirts in irrigating. A
eanal would make productive a belt s wi le as the
supply of water could be m ide to spread over across u,is
entire country and would secure a cordon of settleaienti
connecting the present p p-il tion of the m miiiumh nd
ruiuirin rriitiii1 wun 111m Lri mo oi.kir .-itties. All me
I nd reclaimed would be clear gain if altera -te ivertiiias
are retainel by the Government. I would suggest that
the retained sections be tn own ojeu 1 1 entry under tbe
homestead laws, or sold to actual settlers at a very low
price.
1 renew mv previous rec unmenuation to congress for
general amnesty. The number engxgei in Hie late re
bellion yet laboring under disabi ities m ver. small but
enough to keep up a constant irrilali m. Nn p issilil
danger can accrue to the G jvernment by restoring litem
to eligibility to bold office.
CIVIL EIGHTS.
I suggest for your consideration the enactment ot a
law to better secure the civil rights which fieedniu
should secure but bas nut etTix-tually secured to the en.
franchined slave.
