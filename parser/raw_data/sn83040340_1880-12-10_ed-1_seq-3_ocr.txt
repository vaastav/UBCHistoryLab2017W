THE MESSAGE.
President Hayes's Annual
Message to Congress.
To Ike Senate and House of Iteprttentatitet:
I congratulate you on tho continued and
increasing prosperity of oar country. By tho
favor of Divine Providence wo liavo been
blessed, during the past year, with health,
with abundant harvests, with profitable em
ployment for all our people, and with con
tentment at home, and with peace and friend
ship with other Nations.
The occurrence of the twenty-fourth elec
tion of Chief Magistrate has afforded another
opportunity to tho people of tho United
States to exhibit to tho world a significant ex
ample of the peaceful and safe transmission
of 'tho power and authority of government
from the public servants whose terms of ofllco
are about to expire, to their newly-chosen
successors. This examplo can not fail to im
press profoundly, thoughtful people of other
countries with the advantages which Kcpub
lican institutions afford. The immediate,
general and cheerful acquiescence of all good
citizens in the result 01 the election, gives
gratifying assurance to our country, and to
its friends throughout the world, that a Gov
ernment bated on the free consent of an in-
telligcnt and patriotic people possesses ele
ments of strength, stability and permanency
not found in any other form of government.
Continued opposition to the full and tree en
joyment of the rights of citizenship, conferred
upon the colored pcopleby the recent amend
ments to tho Constitution, still prevails in
several of the late slavcholding States. It
has, perhaps, not been manifested in the re
cent election to any large extent in acts of vi
olence or intimidation. It has, however, by
frndulent practices in connection with tho
ballots, with the regulations us to the places
and manner of voting, and with counting, re
turning and canvassing tho votes cast, in suc
cessfully defeating the exercise of the right
preservative of all rights, tho right of suf
frage, which tho Constitution expressly con
fers upon our enfranchised citizens.
THE EQUAL-KIGHTS AMENDMENTS.
Itis the desire of the good people of tho whole
country that sectionalism us a factor in our
politics should disappear. They prefer that
no section of tho country should be
united in solid opposition to any other
section. Tho disposition to refuse a
prompt. and hearty obedience to
the equal-rights amendments to thcConstitu
tionis nil mat now stands in the way of a
completo obliteration of sectional lines in our
political contests. As long as cither of these
amendments is flagrantly violated or disre
garded, it is safe to assume that tho people
who t. aced them in the Constitution, sis em
bodying the legitimate results of the war for
the Union, and who believe them to be wise
and necessary, will continue to act together,
and to insist that they shall be obeyed. The
paramount question still is as to the enjoy
ment of the right, by every American citizen
who has the requisite qualifications, to freely
cast his vote and to have it honestly counted.
"With this question rightly settled, the country
will be relieved of the contentions of the past ;
bygones will indeed be bygones; and political
and party issues with respect to economy and
efficiency of admin istration, internal improve
ments, the tariff, domestic taxation, educa
tion, finance, and other important subjects,
will then receive their full share of attention ;
"but resistance to and nullification of the re
sults of the war will unite together in resolute
purpose for their support all who maintain
the authority of the Government and the per
petuity of the Union, and who adequately
appreciate the value of the victory achieved.
This determination proceeds from no hostile
'" sentiment or feeling to any part of the people
of our country, or to any of their interests.
The inviolability of the amendments rests
upon the fundamental-principle of our Gov
ernment. They are the solemn expression of
the will of the people of the United States.
The sentiment that the constitutional rights
of all our citizens must be maintained does not
grow weaker. It will continue to control the
Government of the country. Happily, the
history of the late election shows that in
many parts of the country where opposition
to the Fifteenth Amendment has heretofore
prevailed. It is diminishing, and is likely to
cease altogether, if firm and well-considered
action is taken by Congress. I trust the House
of Representatives and Senate, which have
the right to judge of the elections, returns,
and qualifications of their own members, will
see to it that every ease of violation of the
letter or spirit of the Fifteenth Amendment is
thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit
from such violation shall accrue to any per
son or party. It will be the dutj of the Exec
utive, with sufficient appropriations for the
Earpose, to prosecute unsparingly all who
ave been engaged in depriving citizens of
the rights guaranteed to them by the Consti
tution. Itis not, however, to be forgotten that the
best and surest guarantee of the primary rights
of citizenship is to be found in that capacity
for self -protection which can belong only to a
peopie whose right to universal suffrage is
supported by universal education. The means
at the command of the local and State author
ities are, in many cases, wholly inadequate to
furnish free instruction to all who need it.
This is especially true where, before cmunci-
Jmtion, the education of the people was neg
ected or prevented, in the interests of slav
ery. Firmly convinced that the subject of
popular educationdeserves the earnest atten
tion of the people of the whole country, with
a view to wise and comprehensive action by
the Government of the United States, I re
spectfullv recommend that Congress, by suit
able legislation and with proper safeguards,
4 supplement the local educational funds in the
several States where the grave duties and re
sponsibilities of citizenship havebeen devolv
ed on uneducated people, by devoting to the
purpose grants of the public lands, and, it
necessary, bv appropriations from the Trea
sury of the United States. Whatever Govern
ment can fairly do to promote free popular
education ought to be done. Wherever gen
eral education is found, peace virtue, and
social order prevail, and civil and religious
liberty are secure.
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
In my former annual messages, I have
asked the attention of Congress to tho urgent
necessity of a reformation of the civil-service
system of the Government. My views con
cerning the dangers of patronage, or ap
pointments for personal or partisan consid
erations, have been strengthened by my ob
servation and experience in the Executive
office, and I believe these dangers threaten
the stability of the Government. Abuses so
serious in their nature cannot bo permanent
ly tolerated. They tend to become more
alarming with the enlargement of adminis
trative service, as the growth of the country
in population increases the number of officers
ana placemen employed.
Tho reasons are imperative for the adoption
of fixed rules for the regulation of appoint
ments, promotions and removals, establish
ing a uniform method, having exclusively in
view, in every instance, tho attainment of the
"best qualifications for tho position in ques
tion. Such a method alone is consistent with
the equal rights of all citizens, and the most
economical and efficient administration of
the public business.
Competitive examinations, in aid of impar
tial appointments and promotions, have been
conducted for somo years past in several of
the Executive Departments, and by my direc
tion this system has been adopted in the Custom-houses
and Post-offices of the lurger cit
ies of the country. In the city of Now York
over two thousand positions in tho civil serv
ice have been subject, in their appointments
and tenure of place, to the operation of pub
lished rulea for this purpose, daring the
past two years. Tho results of theso practical
trials have been very satisfactory, and have
confirmed my opinion in favor of this system
of selection. All are subjected to tho same
tests, and tho result is free from prejudice by
personal favor or partisan influence. It se
cure for tho position applied for, the best
qualifications attainable among the competing
applicants. It is an effectual protection from
the pressure of importunity whir It, under any
other course pursued, largely exacts the time
and attention of appointing officers, to their
great detriment in the discharge of other offi
cial duties, preventing tho abuse of the serv
ice for the mere furtherance of private or
party purposes, and leaving the employee of
the Government, freed from the obligations
imposed by patronage, to depend solely upon
merit for retention and advancement, and
with this constant Incentive to exertion ilpd
improvement.
These invaluable results havo been attained
in a high degree in tho offices where the rules
for appointments by competitive examination
have been applied.
A method which so approved itself by ex
perimental tests at points where such tests
may be fairly considered conclusive, should
bo extended to all subordinate positions un
der the Government. I believe that a strong
and growing public sentiment demands im
mediate measures for securing and enforcing
tho highest possible efficiency in the civil
service, and Its protection from recognized
abuses, and that tho experience referred to
has demonstrated the feasibility of such
measures.
The examinations In the Custom-houses
and Post-offices have been held under many
embarrassments and without provision for
compensation for the extra labor performed
by the officers who have conducted them, and
whose commendable interest in the improve
ment of the public service has induced this
devotion of time and labor without pecuniary
reward. A continuance of these labors gra
tuitously ought not to be expected, and with
out an appropriation by Congress for compen
sation, itis not practicable to extend the sys
tem of examinations generally throughout the
civil service. It is also highly important that
11 such examinations should be conducted
upon a uniform system and under general su
pervision. Section 1753 of tho Revised Stat
utes authorizes the President to prescribe the
regulations for admission to the civil service
of the United States, and for this purpose to
employ suitable persons to conduct the requi
site inquiries with reference to "the fitness of
each candidate, in respect to age, health,
character, knowledge, and ability, for the
branch of service into which ho seeks to en
ter; but the law is practically inoperative
for want of the requisito appropriation.
I therefore recommend an appropriation
of $-25,000 per annum to meet the
expenses of a commission, to be appointed by
the President in accordance with the terms
of this section, whose duty it shall be to de
vise a just, uniform and efficient system of
competititive examinations, and to super
vise the application of the same throughout
the entire civil service of the Government. I
am persuaded that the facilities which such a
commission will afford for testing the fitness
of those who apply for office will not only be
as welcome a relief to members of Comrress
us it will be to the President and heads of
Departments, but that it will also greatly
tend to remove the causes of embarrassment
which now inevitably and constantly attend
the conflicting claims of patronage between
tho Legislative and Executive Departments.
The most effectual check upon the pernicious
competition of influence and official favorit
ism, in the bestowal of office, will be the sub
stitution of au open competition of merit be
tween the applicants, in which every one can
make his own record with the assurance that
his success will depend upon this alone.
I also recommend such legislation us, while
leuvimr everv officer as free as any other citi
zen to express his political opinions and to
use his means for their advancement, shall
also enable him to feel as safe as any private
citizen in refusing all demands upon his sal
ary for political purposes. A law which
should thus guarantee true liberty and justice
to all who are engaged in the public service,
and likewise contain stringent provisions
against the use of official authority to coerce
the political action of private citizens or of
official subordinates, is greatly to be desired.
The most serious obstacle, however, to an
improvement of the civil service, and es
pecially to a reform in the method of appoint
ment and removal, has been found to be the
practice, under what is known as the spoils
system, by which the appointing power has
been so largely encroached upon by mem
bers of Congress. The first step in the re
form of the civil service must be a complete
divorce between Congress and the Executive
in the matter of appointments. The corrupt
ing doctrine that " to the victors belong the
spoils," is inseparable from Congressional
patronage as the established rule and prac
tice of parties in power. It comes to be un
ders od bv applicants for office, and by the
people generally, that Representatives and
Senators are entitled to disburse the patron
age of their respective districts and States.
It is not necessary to recite at length the evils
resulting from this invasion of the Executive
functions. The true principles of govern
ment on the subject of appointments to office,
as stated in the National Conventions
of the leading parties of the
country, have again and again been
approvedbytheAmericanpeople.andcavenot
been called in question in any quarter. These
authentic expressions of public opinion upon
this oil-important subject, are tho statement
of principles that belong to the constitutional
structure of the Government.
" Under the Constitution, the President and
Heads of Departments are to make nomina
tions for office. The Senate is to advise and
consent to appointments, and the House ol
Representatives is to accuse and prosecute
faithless officers. The best interest of the pub
lic service demands that these distinctions be
respected; that Senators and Representatives,
who may be judges and accusers, should not
dictate appointments to office." To this end
tho co-operation of the Legislative Depart
ment of the Government is required, alike by
the necessities of the case and by public opin
ion. Members of Congress will not be relieved
from the demands made upon them with ref
erence to appointments to office until, by leg
islative enactment the pernicious practice Is
condemned and forbidden.
It is therefore recommended that an act be
passed defining the relations of members of
Congress with respect to appointment to of
fice by tho President: and 1 also recommend
that the provisions of Section 1767, and of the
sections following, of the Revised Statutes,
comprising the Teuurc-of office act, of Mtirch
2, 1SC7, be repealed.
Believing that to reform the system and
methods ot the civil service in our country is
one of the highest and moat imperative duties
of statesmanship, and that it can be perma
nently done onlv by the co-operation of the
Legislative and Executive Departments of the
Government,! again commend the hole sub
ject to your considerate attention.
POLYGAMr.
It is the recognized duty and purpose of the
people of the United States to suppress polyg
auiy where it now exists in our Territories and
to prevent its extension. Faithful and zealous
efforts have been made by the United States
authorities InUtnh to enforce the laws against
it. Experience has shown that the legislation
upon this subject, to be effective, requires ex
tensive modification and amendment. The
longer action is delayed the more difficult It
will be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt
and decided measures are necessary. The
Mormon sectarian organization which upholds
polygamy has the whole power of making and
executing the local legislation of the lerri
tory. By its control of the grand and petit
juiies, it possesses large influence over the
administration of justice. Exeicising, as the
heads of this sect do, tho local political
power of the Territory, they are able to make
effective their hostility to the laws of
Congress on the subject of polygamy, and,
in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polyga
my will not be abolished if the enforcement
of the law .depends on, those who practice and
uphold the crime. It can only be suppressed
by taking away the political power of the
ect which encourages and sustains it. The
nower of Comrress to enact suitable laws to
.protect the Territories is ample. It is not a
case oi nau-way measures. aiiu pouuetu
power of the Mormon sect is increasing; it
controls now one of our wealthiest and most
populous Territories. It is extending steadily
into other Territories. Wherever it goes it
establishes polygamy and sectarian political
power. Tho sanctity of marriage and the
family relation are the corner-stone of our
American society and civilization. Religious
liberty and the separation of Church and
State are among the elementary ideas of free
institutions. To re-establish the interests una
principles which polygamy and Mormonism
havo imperiled, and to fully re open to intel
ligent and virtuous immigrants of all creeds
that pait of our domain which has been, in a
gi eat degiec, closed to general immigration
uy intolerant and immoral institutions, it is
recommended that the government of the
Territory of Utah be reorganized.
I recommend that Congress provide for tho
government of Utah by a Governor and
Judges, or Commissioners, appointed by tho
Pro ident and continued by the Senate a
government analogous to the provisional
government established for the Territory
northwest of the Ohio, by tho ordinance of
177. If, however, it is deemed best to con
tinue the existing form of local government,
I recommend that tho right to vote, hold of
fice and sit ou juries in the Territory of Utun
bo confined to those who neither practice nor
uphold polygamy. If thorough measures are
adopted, it is believed that within u few years
the evils which now afflict Utah will be eradi
cated, and that tills Territory will in good
time become one of the most prosperous and
attractive of the new States of tho union.
OOK rOKEIGS RELATIONS.
Our relations with all foreign countries have
been those of undisturbed peace, and have
presented no occasion for concern as to their
continued maintenance.
My anticipation of an early reply from tho
British Government to the demand of indem
nity to our fishermen for the Injuries suffered
bv that industry at Fortune Buy, in January,
1878, which I expressed in my lost annual
message, was disappointed. This answer was
lcceived only in the latter part of April In the
present year, and, when received, exhibited
a failure of accord between the two Govern
ments, as to tho measure of the inshore-fishing
privilege secured to our
fishermen by the Treaty of Washington, of
so serious a character that I made it the
subject of a communication to Congress, in
which I recommended the adoption of the
measures which seemed to me proper to be
taken by this Government in maintenance of
the rights accorded to our fishermen under
the treaty, and toward securing an indemnity
for the injury these interests huve suffered. A
bill to carry out these recommendations was
under consideration by the House of Repre
sentatives at the time of the adjournment of
Congress in June last.
Within a few weeks I havcrcceived a com
munication from ner Majesty's Government,
renewing the consideration of the subject,
both of tho indemnities for the injuries at
Fortune Bay, and of the interpretation of the
treaty in which the previous correspondence
had shown the two Governments to be at va
riance. Upon both these topics the disposi
tion toward a friendly agreement is manifest
ed by a recognition of our right to an indem
nity for the. transaction at Fortune Bay, leav
ing the measure of such indemnity to further
conference, and by an assent to the view of
this Government, presented in the previous
correspondence, that the regulation of con
flicting interests of tho shore fishery of the
Provincial sea-coasts, and the vessel fishery
of our fishermen, should be made the subject
of conference and concurrent arrangement
between the two Governments.
I sincerelv hope that the basis maybe found
for a speedy adjustment of tho very serious
diveigenceof views in the interpretation of
tho fishery clauses of the Treaty of Washing
ton which, as the correspondence between
the two Governments stood nt the close of the
last session of Congress, seemed to be irre
concilable. In the important exhibition of arts and in
dustries, which was held last year at Sidney,
New South Wales, as well as "in that now in
Srogress at Melbourne, theUnited States have
een efficiently and honorably represented.
The exhibitors from this country at the for
mer place received a large number of awards
in somo of the most considerable departments,
and the participation of the United States was
recognized by a special mark of distinction.
In the exhibition at Melbourne, the share
taken by our country is no less notable, and
an equal degree of Success is confidently ex
pected. The state of peace and tranquillity now en
joyed by all the nations of the continent of
Europe has its favorable influence upon our
diplomatic and commercial relations with
them. We have concluded and ratified a con
vention with the French Republic for the set
tlement of claims of the citizens of either
country against the other. Under this conven
tion a commission, presided over by a distin
guished publicist, appointed in pur
suance of tho request of both
nations, by His Majesty the Emperor
of Brazil, has been organized and has begun
its sessions in this city. A congress to consid
er means for the protection of industrial
property has recentlybeen in session in Paris,
to which I have appointed the Ministers ot
the United Suites In France and in Belgium as
delegates. The International Commission
upon Weights and Measures also continues its
work in Paris. I invite your attention to the
necessity of an appropriation to be made in
time to enable this Government to comply
with its obligations under the Metrical Con
vention. Our friendly relations with the German Em
pire continue without interruption. At the
recent International Exhibition of Fish and
Fisheries at Berlin, the participation of the
United Mates, notwithstanding the haste with
which the commission was forced to make its
preparations, was extremely successful and
meritorious, winning for private exhibitors
numerous awards of a high clas. and for the
country at large the principal prize of honor
offered by his Majesty the Emperor. The re
sults of this great success can not but be ad
vantageous to this important and growing
industry. There have been some questions
raised between the two Governments as to
the proper effect and interpretation of our
treaties of naturalization, but recent dis
patches from our Minister at Berlin show that
iavorable progress is making toward an un
derstanding, in accordance with the views of
this Government, which makes anl admits no
distinction whatever between the rights of a
native and a naturalized citizen of the United
States. In practice, the complaints of mo
lestation suffered by naturalized citizens
abroad have never been fewer than at pre-enr.
There is nothing of importance to note in
our unbroken friendly relations with the Gov
ernments of Austria-Hungary, Russia, Portu
gal, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Tur
key and Greece.
During the last summer several vessels be
longing to the merchant marine of this coun
try, sailing in neutral waters of the West lu
dlcs, were fired at, boarded, and searched by
an armed cruiser of the Spanish Government.
The circumstances, as reported, involve not
only a private injury to the persons concerned,
but also seemed too little observant of the
friendly relations existing for a century be
tween this country and Spain. The wrong
was brought to the attention of the Spanish
Government in a serious protest and remon
strance, and the matter is undergoing investi
gation by the royalauthorities, with a view to
such explanation or reparation as may be
culled for by the facts.
The commission sitting in this city for the
adjudication of claims of our citizens against
the Government of Spain, is, I hope, ap
proaching the termination of its labors.
The claims against the United States under
the Florida Treaty with Spain were submitted
to Congress for its action at the late session,
and I again invite your attention to this long
standing question, with a view to a final dis
position of the matter.
At the invitation of the Spanish Govern
ment, a conference has recently been held at
the city of Madrid to consider the subject of
protection by foreign Powers of native Moors
in the Empire of Morocco. The Minister of
the United States, in Spain, was directed to
take part In the deliberations of this confer
ence, the result of which is a convention
signed on behalf of all the Powers represent
ed. The instrument will be laid before the
Senate for its consideration. The Govern
ment of the United States has also lost no op
portunity to urge upon that of the Emperor
of Morocco tho necessity in accordance with
the humane and enlightened spirit of the
nge, of putting an end to the persecutions,
which have been so prevalent in that country,
of persons of a faith other than the Moslem,
and especially of the Hebrew residents of
Morocco.
The consular treaty concluded with Bel
gium has not yet been officially promulgated,
owing to the alteration of a word in tho text
by the Senate of the United States, which oc
casioned a delay, during which the time al
lowed for ratification expired. The Senate
will be asked to extend tho period for ratifi
cation. Tne attempt to negotiate a treaty of extra
dition with Denmark failed on account of the
objection of the Danish Government to the
usual clause providing that each nation
should pay the expense of the arrest of the
persons whoc extradition it asks.
Tho provision made by Congress, at its last
session, for the expense of the commission
which had been appointed to enter upon
negotiations with the Imperial Government
of Chiun, on subjects of great interest to tho
relations of the two countries, enabled the
commissioner to proceed at once upon their
mission, ine imperial uovernment was pre
pared to give prompt and respectful attention
to tho matters brought under negotiation,
and the conference proceeded with such
rapidity and success that, on the 17th of No
vember last, two treaties were signed at
Pekln, one relating to the Introduction of
Chinese into this country and one relating to
commerce. Mr. Trescot, one of the commis
sioners, is now on his way home bringing the
treaties, and Itis expected that they will be
received in season to be laid before the Sen
ate early in January.
Our Minuter in Japan has negotiated a con
vention for the reciprocal relief of ship
wiceked seamen. I tako occasion to urge
once more upon Congress the propriety of
making provision for the erection of
suitable fire-proof bnildfngs at the Japanese
capital for the use of the American legation
and the Court-house and Jail connected with
it. The Japanese Government, with great
generosity and courtesy, has offered for this
purpose an eligible piece of land.
In mv lat annual message I invited the at
tention of Congress to the subject of the in
demnity funds received some years ago from
China and Japan. I renew the recommenda
tion then made, that whatever portion of
these funds are due to American citizens
should be promptly paid, ana the residue re
turned to the nations, respectively, to which
they Justly and equitably belong.
Tho extradition treaty with the kingdom of
tho Netherlands, which has been for some
time in course of ncotlation, ba, during the
past year, been com l.ided and duly ratified.
Relations of friendship and amity have been
established between the Government of the
United States and that of Koumanla. We
have sent a diplomatic representative to Bu
charest, and have received at this capital the
special envoy, who has been charged bv his
Royal Highness, Prince Charles, to announce
the independent sovereignty of Roumania.
We hope for a speedy developmept of com
mercial relations between the two countries.
otn: SISTER RE rtflSLICS.
In mylast annual message I expressed ahope
that the prevalence of quiet on the border be
tween this country andMcxico would soon be
come so assured as to justify the modification
of the orders, then in force, to our military
commanders, in regard to crossing the fron
tier, without encouraging such disturbances
as would endanger the peace of the two coun
tries. Events moved in accordance with these
expectations, and the orders were accotding
ly withdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of our
own citizens and the Mexican Government.
Subsequently the peace of the border was
again disturbed by a savage foray, under the
command of Chief Victorio, but. by the com
bined and harmonious action of the military
forces ol both countries, his band has been
broken up and substatinlly destroyed.
There is reason to believe that the obstacles
which have so long prevented rapid and con
venient communication between theUnited
States and 3Iexico by railway, are on the
point of disappearing, and that several im
portant enterprises of this character will soon
be set on foot which can not fait to contribute
largely to the prosperity of the two countries.
New" envoys from Guatemala, Colombia,
Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua have re
cently arrived at this capital, whose distinc
tion itnd enlightenment afford the best guar
antee of the continuance of friendly relations
between ourselves and these sister Republics.
The relations between this Government and
that of the United States of Colombia have
engaged public attention during the post
vear, mainly by reason of the project of an
Interoceanic canal across the Isthmus of Pan
ama, to be built by private capital under a
concession from the Colombian Government
for that purpose. The treaty obligations sub
sisting between the United States And Colom
bia, by which we guarantee the neutrality of
the transit and the sovereignty and property
of Colombia in the Isthmus, make it necessa
ry that the conditions under which so stu
pendous a change in the region embraced in
this guarantee should be effected transform
ing, us it would, this Isthmus, from a barrier
oetween tue Atlantic ami I'aeinc uceans, into
a gateway and thoroughfare between them,
for the navies and the merchant-ships of the
world should receive the approval of this
Government, as being compatible with the
discbarge of these obligations on our part,
and consisu-nt with our interests as the prin
cipal commercial power of the Western Hem
isphere. The views which I expressed in a
special message to Congress in March last, in
relation to this project, I deem it my duty to
press upon your attention. Subsequent con
sideration has but confirmed the opinion
that it is the right and duty of the United
States to assert and maintain such supervis
ion and authority over any interoceanic canal
across the Isthmus that connects North and
South America as wiU protect our national
interest."
The war between the Republic of Chili on
the one hand, and the allied Republics of
Peru and Bolivia on the other, still continues.
This Government has not felt called upon to
iuterfere in a contest that is within the bel
ligerent rights of the parties as inde
pendent States. We have, however, always
held ourselves in readiness to aid in accom
modating their difference, and have at differ
ent times reminded both belligerents of our
willingness to render such service.
Our good offices, in this direction, were re
cently accepted by all the belligerents, and it
was honed they would prove efficacious; but
I regret to announce that the measures, which
tho Ministers of the United States at Santiago
and Lima were authorized to take, with the
view to bring about a peace, were not success
ful. In the course of the war some questions
have arisen affecting neutral rights; in all of
these the Minlstew of the United States have,
under their Instructions, acted with prompt
ness and energy in protection of American in,
terests. The relations of theUnited States with the
Empire of Brazil continue to be most cordial,
and their commercial intercourse steadily in
ci cases, to their mutual advantage.
The internal disorders with which the Ar
gentine Republic has for some time past been
afflicted, and which have more or
less influenced its external trade, are under
stood to have been brought to a close. This
happv result may be expected to re
dound to the benefit of the foreign commerce
of that Republic as well as to the development
of its vast interior resources.
In Samoa, the Government of King Melie
toa, under the support and recognition of the
consular representatives of the United states,
Great Britain and German, seems to have
given peace and tranquillity to the Islands.
While it does not appear desirable to adopt as
a whole the scheme of tripartite local govern
ment, which has been proposed, the common
interests of the three great treaty Powers re
quired harmony in their relations to the
native frame of government, and this may be
best secured by a simple diplomatic agree
ment between them. It would be well if the
consular jurisdiction of our representative at
Apia were increased in extent and importance
so as to guard American interests in the sur

Khedive of Egypt to the City of New York,
has safely arrived in this country, and will
soon be erected in that metropolis. A com

Government, at the earnest solicitation of the
Khedive, has acceded to the provisions adopt

FOREIGN TRADE AND COMMERCE,
ho efforts of the Department of State to en
large the trade and commerce of the United
States, through the active agency of consular J
ojiicers :iuu iiiruuuii nc uisciuhuhvh ui in
formation obtained from them, havebeen un
rvkiAist. The interest in thesw efforts, as de
veloped in ourconunervial vommuuitiu. and 1
the vuLie of the iuf unuathm secured by thU
mean, to the trade and smifactares ef the
country, were recognized by Congress at Its
last session, and pforfcrioa was made for
the more frequent publication of consular
and other reports by the Department of
State. The first issue of thispabWcatkm has
now been prepared, and subsequent issues
may regularly be expected. The importance
ami interest attached to the reports of con
sular officers, are witnessed by the general de
mand for them by all elassesof merchants and
manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade.
It is believed that the system of such publi
cations la deserving of the approval of Con
gress, and that the secessary appropriations
for Its continuance and enlargement will eora
mend ltelf to your consideration.
The prosperous energies of our domestie
industries, and their immense production of
the subjects of foreign commerce, invite, sad
even requite, an active development of the
wishes and interests of our people in that di
rection. Especially important is it that our
commercial relatione with the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts of South America, with the
West Indies and the Gnlf of Mexico should be
direct, and not through the circuit of Eu
ropean systems, and should be carried! oa in
our own bottoms. The full appreciation of
the opportunities which our front on the Pa
cific ocean gives to commerce with Japan,
China and the East Indies, with Australia,
and the Island groups which lie along these
routes of navigation, should inspire
eqnal efforts to appropriate to our
own shipping, and to administer by our
own capital, a due proportion of tbis
trade. Whatever modifications of our regu
lations of trade and navigation may be neces
sary or useful to meet and direct these im
pulses to the enlargement of our exchanges
and of ourcarrylngtradc I am sure the wisdom
of Congress will be ready to snpply. Oneinitial
measure, however, seems to me so clearly
useful and efficient that 1 venture to press ft
upon your earnest attention. It seems to be
very evident that the provision of regular
steam postal communication, by aid from Gov
ernment, has been the forerunner of the com
mercial predominance of Great Britain on all
these coasts and seas, a greater share in
whose trade is now the desire and the intent
of onr people. It is also manifest that the
effort? of other European nations to contend
with Great Britain for a share of this com
merce have been successful in proportion
with their adoption of regular steam postal
communication with the markets whose trade
they sought. Mexico and the States of Sonth
America are anxious to receive such postal
communications with this country, and to aid
in their development. Similar co-operation
may be looked for. In due time, irom the
Eastern nations and from Australia. It is dif
ficult to see. howthe lead in thismovementcan
be expected from private Interests. In respect
of foreign commerce, quite as much as in inter
nal trade, postal communication seems neces
sarily a' matter of common and public ad
ministration, and thus pertaining to Govern
ment. I respectfully recommend to your
prompt attention such just and efficient
measures as may conduce to the development
of onr foreign commercial exchanges and the
building np of onr carrying trade.
In this connection I desire also to sugsest
the very great service which might be ex
pected In enlarging and facilitating our com
merce on the Pacific Ocean, were a trans- .
marine cable laid from San Francisco to the
Sandwich Islands, and thence to Japan at the
North and Australia at the South. The great
influence of such means of communication on
these routes of navigation, in developing and
securing the due share of our Pacific Coast in
the commerce of the world, needs no illustra
tion or enforcement. It may be that such an
enterprise, useful and in the end profitable as
it would prove to private investment, may
need to be accelerated by prudent legislation
by Congress in its aid, and I submit the mat
ter to your careful consideration.
An additional, and not unimportant, al
though secondary, reason for fostering and
enlarging the Navy- may be found in the un
questionable service to the expansion of onr
commerce, which would be rendered by the
frequent circulation of naval ships in the
seas and ports of all quarters of the globe.

equipment, to be of the greatest efficiency
in case of maritime war. misht be made
constant and active agents in time of peace
in the advancement and protection of our for
eign trade.and in the nurture and discipline of
young seamen, who would, narurally.in some
numbers, mix with and improve the crews of
our merchant-ships. Our merchants at home
and abroad recognize the value to foreign
commerce of an active movement of onr na
val vessels, and the intelligence and patriotic
zeal of our naval officers in promoting every
interest of their countrymen, is a just subject
of national pride.'
OC NATIONAL FINANCES.
The condition of the financial affairs of the
Government, as shown by the report of the
Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisf actory.
It is believed that the present financial situ
ation of the United States, whether consider
ed with respect to trade, currency, credit,
growing wealth, or the extent and variety of
our resources, is more favorable than that of
any other country of our time, and has never
been surpassed by that of any country at any
period of its history- All our industries are
thriving; the rate of interest is low; new rail
roads are being constructed; a vast immigra
tion is increasing our population, capital, and
labor; new enterprises in great number are in
progress; and onr commercial relations with
other countries are improving.
