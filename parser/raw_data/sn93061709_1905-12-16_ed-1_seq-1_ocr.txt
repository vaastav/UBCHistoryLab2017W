FAVORS JOINT STATEHOOD
President Roosevelt Says Agita
tion Has Been Going Long
Enough Time to Act.
"I recommend that Indian Torriton
and Oklahoma be admitted as one state,
anil that New Mexico and Arizona be ad
mitted as one state. There is no obliga
tion upon us to treat territorial suhdivi
sions, which are matters of convonienci
only, as binding us on the question of ad
mission to statehood, nothing has taken up
more time in Congress during the past few
years than the question as to to the state
hood to be granted to the lour territories
above mentioned, and after careful con
sideration of all that has brim developed
in the discussions ol the question, I re
commend that they be immediately ad
mitted as two states. There is no justifi
cation for further delay; and the advisi-
bility of making the four territories int.)
two states has been clearly established.
"In some of the territories the legisla
tive assemblies issue licenses for gambling.
Congress should by law forbid this piac
lice, the harmlul results ol which are oh
vious at a glance." - Kn tract from the
President's message.
J J Ifagerman, of Koswell, being asked
the question, ''How do you fuel about the
appointment of your son an governor?"
gave, the Record the following statement:
"I am grate! id. ol course; 1 belii.vu hu will
perform the duties ol the oilier: acceptably
to the people I lis handn are free lie has
no enemies to punish nor pets to reward
TUCUriCARI, NHW MEXICO,
CHARLES BALLARD, THE ROUGH RIDER.
THE ROVGH RIDER WHO
IS NOT OUT FOR OFFICE
The Carlsbad Sun interview!; ('has. Mallard as follows, regarding the marshal
ship of the territory: "There is not enough in it to justify neglecting or selling my
ranch, upon which, with ordinary success, I can do better financially, being at home
among friends, instead of roaming over a country that 1 have seen before many limes
over." Asked about the shei ill's olliee, he said: "I am not out for ollice, and do
not want ollice." "Hut suppose, Mr. Mallard, the people should ask you to go to the
council again?" "1 hope that some other man may be chosen, as I have had plenty of
council and am not wishing for the ollice."
Mr. Mallard is one among a large number of Rough Riders who is not a politician
and who has no desire for ollice of any kind. lie is probably the only I )emocrat in
history whoever refused an ollice. Notwithstanding all these objections, he is one of
the most hiuhly esteemed citizens of New Mexico in both parlies, and a gentleman of
the old school, lie is a personal friend of the President, who has oflered to favor him
at various limes, but he prefers his ranch and home circle to all the offices in the gift
of the people. The President and many of his friends wanted him to be II. S. Marshal
for New Mexico, but with due regard toall of them, he prefers to ranch. There is
only one Charlie Mallard in all the Southwest, but it were better for us if we had more
of them.
The President demands economy i n
public expenditures, the abolishment of
useless ollices and the introduction ol bus
iness methods into the various departments
of government. Just what New Mexico is
promised under the new governor a n d
joint statehood. I lalf the ollices of New
Mexico and Arizona will be abolished un
der jointure, and in the meantime Mr.
liagerman will introduce economy and
business methods into the territorial gov
ernment. Koswell Kecord.
I ''red Walther, the merchant, farmer
and stockman of Puerto, was in town Mon
day. Mr. Walther has decided that tli-ue
is more! in raising thouroiigh-bred stock
than for the scrubs, and it takes 110 more
pasture or feed than for the ungraded ani
mals, hence, he is now in the hog business
lor all ii is worth. He received here Mon
day a thorough-bred Poland China sow
from the K. L. Howard farm at Piano,
Texas, and will introduce that slock on
his larni at Puerto. He is one among
many men now in yuay County who be

SATURDAY. DllC. 16, 1905.
We have a number of immigrants from
Arkansas this week who brought lumber
along with them to build houses on home
steads they contemplate taking. They had
evidently been informed that we have a
prairie country out here. Notwitnstand
ing the fact that we have broad prairies,
we also have large areas of line lumber
which is not only consumed extensively at
home but much of it is being exported to
outside districts. So when you write back
home to the folks some of whom, no doubt,
will soon be getting ready to come to the
land of sunshine, health and plenty, tell
them we can build their houses out here
and save them the expense of freighting
across two or three stales.
Patented homesteads and all sorts of
acreage properties are now in demand in
(Juay County. People are coining here
from all parts of the country and taking
lands (or the purpose of building homes.
They are not paupers, either, but a high
average of citizenship who are looking for
a good climate and valunblo agricultural
lands in a prosperous community.

FAVORABLE TO
JOINT STATEHOOD
The four territories seeking admission
into the sisterhood of states have a staunch
and true friend in Representative Hamil
ton of Michigan, chairman of the house
committee on territories. He is the earn
est champion, at least, of those who favor
the erection of two states out of the four
territories.
Mr. Hamilton has re-introduced his
statehood bill in substantially the snme
form it was before the last congress. It
provides for two states, one created out of
Arizona and New Mexico, and known as
Arizona, and one created out of Oklahoma
and Indian Territory, to be known as Okla
homa. It contains no provision respect
ing the regulation of the liquor trallic, that
having been an amendment which the sen
ate added to the last statehood bill.
WHERE TAFT DOESN'T SHINE
Secretary Taft says that all the presents
Alice Roosevelt received when she left
China wouldn't bring $150 at an auction
sale. Secretary Taft may be a great Sec
retary of war, but lie evidently is not cut
out for a newspaper correspondent. Ro

C10 to any town, take up the local paper,
read and see who does the advertising in its
columns, and then make a canvass of the
town and ask the people who are the lead
ing merchants of the place and the best
place to trade and see if they don't tell you
that the ones you see represented in the
local papers are leaders, and why? Look
at the records of all our merchant princes,
and you will find that they were very heavy
users of printer's ink and spent thousands
of dollars yearly for advertising. Hig

The Santa Fe Railway Co. is spending
$10,000,000011 the Santa Fe Cut-ofT, from
