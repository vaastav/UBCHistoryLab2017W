memory which fosters patriotic senti
ment and keeps alive a tender regard
for those who nobly died. And yet
: there remains with us today in full
strength, as an incident of that tre
mendous struggle, a feature of its
, financial necessities, not only unsuited
to our present circumstances, but man
ifestly a disturbing menace to business
security and an ever present agent of
monetary distress.
"I am more convinced than ever that
we can have no assured financial peace
and safety until the Government cur
rency obligations upon which gold may
be demanded from the Treasury are
j withdrawn from circulation and can
celed. This might be done, as has been
j heretofore recommended, by their ex
change for long term bonds bearing a
llow rate of interest or by their redemp-
Evenif n tPheCUniStedf s'tatesofes
; known as greenbacks were thus retired
it is probable that the Treasury notes
issued in payment of silver purchases
under the act of July 14, 1890, now paid
in gold when demanded, would not cre
ate such disturbance as they might
from time to time when received in the
Treasury by redemption in gold or
otherwise, be gradually and prudently
replaced by silver coin."
"In default of this, however, it would
be a step in the right direction if cur
rency obligations redeemable in gold,
whenever so redeemed, should be can
celed instead of being reissued. This
operation would be a slow remedy, but
it would improve present conditions.
National banks should redeem their
notes. They should be allowed to is
sue circulated to the par value of bonds
deposited as security of their redemp
tion and the tax on their circulation
should be reduced to one-fourth of 1
per cent. It is no much a contraction
of our currency that should be avoided
as such unequal distribution.
"This might be obviated and any fear
of harmful contraction at the same
time removed by allowing the organi
zation of smaller banks and in less
populous communities than are now
permitted, and authorizing banks to
establish branches in small communi
ties under proper restriction. The en
tire case may be presented by the
statement that the day of sensible and
sound financial method will not dawn
upon us until our Government aban
dons the banking business and the
accumulation of funds and confines its
monetary operations to the receipt of ;
the money contributed by the people ,
for its support and to the expenditure
of such money for the people's benefit.
TRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES.
"Though Congress has attempted to
deal with this matter by legislation,
the larws passed for that purpose thus
far have proved ineffective, not because
of any lack of disposition or attempt to
enforce them, but simply because the
laws themselves as interpreted by the
courts do not reach the difficulty. If
the insufficiencies of existing laws can
be remedied by further legislation it
should be done. It should be recog
nized, however, that all financial leg
islation on this subject may fall short I
of its purpose because of inherent ob-
stancles, and also because of the com
plex character of our Government sys
tem, which, while making the Federal
authority supreme within its sphere,
has carefully limited that sphere by
bounds which cannot be transgressed.
The decision of our highest court on
the precise question renders it quite
doubtful whether the evils of trusts
and monopolies can be adequately
treated through Federal action, unless!
they seek directly and purposely to ,
include in their objects transportation
or intercourse between States or be
tween the United States and foreign
countries."

TEXT OF TREATY.
Document Which Closes Venezuela's
Troubles.
LONDON, Dec. 5. The following is
the text of the final draft of the Qui
ana-v enezula boundary treaty, nego
tiated on behalf of Venezuela by Sec
retary Olney and Lord Salisbury, Em
bassador Bayard and Sir Julian Paun
cefote. the British Embassador at
Washington, acting as intermediaries,
which is now before the Venezuelan
Council of State for consideration and
approval:
First An arbitral tribunal shall be
immediately appointed to determine
the boundary line between the colony
of British Guiana and the Republic of
Venezuela.
Second The tribunal shall consist
of two members nominated by the
judges of the Supreme Court of the
United States and two members nomi
nated by the judges of the British
High Court of Justice, and a fifth se
lected by the four persons so nominat
ed; or, in the event of their failure to
agree within three months from the
time of their nomination, the fifth to
be selected by the King of Sweden.
The person so selected shall be the
president of the tribunal. The persons
nominated by the judges of the Su-
Pff Court . of the United States and
lu ingu lour ui jum , i-
said courts.
Third The tribunal shall investi-
gate and ascertain the extent of the
territories belonging to or that might
lawfully be claimed by the United
Netherlands, or by the Kingdom of
Spain, respectively, at the time of the
acquisition by Great Britain of the
colony of British Guiana, and shall
determine the boundary line between
the colony of British Guiana and the
Republic of Venezuela.
Fourth In deciding the matter sub
mitted the arbitrators shall ascertain
all the facts which they deem neces
sary to a decision of the controversy,
and shall be governed by the follow
ing rules, which are agreed upon .by
the high contracting parties as the
rules to be taken as applicable to the
case, and by such principles of inter
national law not inconsistent there
with as the arbitrators shall deter
mine to be applicable to the case.
The rules are as follows:
First Adverse holding or prescrip
tion during a period of fifty years
shall make a good title. The arbitra-
tors may deem exclusive political con-
trol of the district as well as actual
settlement thereof sufficient to consti
tute an adverse holding or to make a
title by prescription.
Second The arbitrators may recog
nize and give effect to rights and
claims resting upon any other ground
whatever, valid according to existing
international law, and on any principle
of international law which the arbi
trators may deem to be applicable to
the case and are not in contravention
of the foregoing rules.
Third In determining the boundary
line, if the territory of one party be
found by the tribunal to have been in
occupation of the subjects or citizens
of the other party, such effect shall be
given to such occupation as reason,
justice, the principles of international
law and the equities of the case shall,
in the opinion of the tribunal, require.
SEN ATE CONSIDERS CUBA.
Three Rills for Iteeoirnltlon Offered In
One Day.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 9. The
session of the Senate today was at
tended by several interesting and im
portant incidents.
The independence of Cuba was the
subject of three joint resolutions, in
troduced by Cameron (R.) of Pennsyl-
a"ia'
Mills (D.) of Texas and Call
(D.) of Florida.
The first acknowledges
the inde-
pendence of the island and directs the

ItepuhllcHUS of the Vhv an. I Mchds
Committee to Confer.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. A confer- j
ence of the Republican members of the j
Ways and Means Committee will be
held tomorrow night, probably at the
rooms of Dingley, the chairman, to de
cide what action shall be taken with
reference to the preparation of a tariff
bill. The consideration of this ques
tion also involves the necessity of an
extra session. If it is decided to pre
pare a finished tariff measure it is ex
pected that arrangements will be made
for a series of hearings to the repre
sentatives of the manufacturing inter
ests, which will extend over a period
of a month or more. It is believed
that if the work of preparing a tariff
bill be delayed until the latter part of
January, sufficient time will remain
before the 4th of March to perfect the
measure. Appearances would indicate
that Republican members generally fa
vor an extra session.
coopkr at Canton.
Minister Pays Ills Respects to the
President-Elect.
CANTON, Ohio, Dec. 9. Cabinet
booms resounded throughout the day
at Canton. The claims of Henry C.
Payne were urged with a good deal of
force. General Powell Clayton, who is
thought to be a cabinet possibility, had
a private conference with the President-elect
and Colonel Harrison Gray
Otis of Los Angeles, Cal., and talked
about a cabinet position for a repre
sentative of the Pacific Slope States.
The visit of Henry E. Cooper, Ha
waiian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and
his secretary, Benjamin Lodge Marx,
to Major McKinley, naturally caused
a good deal of comment.
Minister Cooper called on Major Mc
Kinley this afternoon and was invited
to a private conference. Mr. Cooper
said that there was no treaty of an
nexation in process of negotiation at
Washington. Major McKinley did not
indicate to the Minister what his views
concerning the relations of the Ha
waiian Islands to this country were.
The interview was a short one, but it
was long enough to raise a cloud of
rumor and gossip.
SPANISn CAIUXET MEETING.
President Cleveland's Messaore Matter
of Grave Discussion.
MADRID, SPAIN, Dec. 9. The Her-
alde says: The Cabinet held a meet
ing today for the purpose of consid
ering President Cleveland's message to
Congress. Ex-Premier Sagasta de
clared that the message is of so much
importance that he will await the re
ceipt of the full text of the document
before discussing it.
All of the Spanish newspapers de
clare that the message provokes Eu
rope, not Spain alone. The general
Opinion here is that the references to
Cuba and Spain contained in President
Cleveland's message to Congress show
that it is the intention of the United
States to conform more and more to
the Monroe Doctrine each time a case
arises to which that principle is ap
plicable.
The Cabinet, after debating the text
of the message today will form a defin
ite judgment, which it is believed will
result in a modifications of the rela
tions of Spain with the United States.
SAYS I,ITTI,K OF SAMOA.
Secretary Olney Touches Llehtly In
Annual Report.
In regard to the Samoan question
Mr .Olney makes no recommendation,
and gives no intimation of any recent
action having been taken. He simply
says, in his annual report as Secretary
of State:
"The situation in Samoa la practical
ly the same as stated in the last an
nual message of the President, and in
his special communication to the Sen
ate of May, 1894. A possibility of
more effective harmony in the irregu
lar administration may be suggested
by the resignation of the president of
the municipal council and the agree
ment of the three powers upon his
successor, another German subject.
"The Chief Justice of Samoa has also
resigned, and aa ho la an American
citizen, the proposal of hla successor
will naturally fall to the United States,
which necessarily continues to exer
cise all stipulated rights and duties
under the tripartite general act during
the continuance of that compact, how
ever irksome and unnatural these du
ties and rights may prove to be."
