SENATE PASSES
THE CANAL BILL
SPENDS THE WHOLE DAY IN
DEBATING IT
Only Amendment Is On« Requiring
That Congress Be Furnished With
Estimates of All Salaries Except
Those of Laborers
IJ> Agnoplated Press.
WASHINGTON,- Deo.- IC— The senate
toduy passed the Pananiii oiinnl emer
gency! uppropriat lon bill, but tho result
was not uttulned until after the de
bate on .the bill had boon continued
the greater part of the day to the ex
clusion of practically nil uthnr Imsl
nessi Set speeches were mado by. Mr.
Ijncon in advocacy of his amendment
requiring estimates for the mud I com
mission salaries; by Mr. Allison, who
devoted, himself largely 'to the details
of tho bill; by Mr, Ctilberson, who
irltlclsed the employment of Mr. "Bish
op as a "press ugent;" by Mr. Stone,
who criticised the purchuHe of Amer
ican ships to carry Panama supplies
In face of the announced determination
to go abroad for vessels under the con
ditions then existing, and by Mr. New
lands, who expressed the opinion that
the construction of the canal xhould
have been entrusted to the geological
Burvey.
A substitute for Mr. Itncon's amend
ment, offered by Mr. Hale, was ac
cepted. It specifically requires that
'congress shall be supplied with regu
lar estimates of all salaries except
those paid to laborers, pkllled and un
skilled. Otherwise, the bill was passed
as reported from the committee.
During the session Mr. Hale made
the authorized announcement that Mr
13ishop's duty as "press agent" would
be discontinued.
Want* Estimate of Salaries
• When the canal bill was taken tip by
the senate today, Mr. flacon took the
floor in support of his amendment re
quiring quarterly estimates of the
salaries and other expenses of the ca
nal commission.
He said that under the present sys
tem congress was deprived of the op
portunity for proper scrutiny of the
salaries paid to the commission's em
ployes. Although there was really
stronger ground for such estimates In
the case of the canal employes than in
the regular departments of the gov
ernment, he said such a course would
go far toward preventing the extrava
grance practiced on the commission.
He commented on tho fact that Mr.
Shonts' salary was more than twice
ps much as that paid to the chief jus
tice of the supremo court of the United
Slates, and said it was not the policy
of the government to emulate the high
salaries paid by private corporations.
■Even the auditor of the commission
gets $10,000, while tho man who passes
■upon his work receives only $4000, and
the executive head of the department,
the secretary of war, only $8000.
"In my humble judgment," he said,
"the man does not live whose per
sonal services are worth $150,000."
He said. In reply to Mr. Spooner, that
ho thought that the $30,000 paid the
chief engineer of the commission too
great.
; , "I would not pay any of them more

Mr. Allison replied to Mr. naeon

nrlon, Mr. Alllnon uttld:
"t do not think the rnnnl run be con*
utructed upon the bftoln HUffsonted by

renpecta the higher plHcew."
It whk contpnded by Mr. Telirr «hflt
what whb neerlod In the construction
of th« ctinnl was v man of executive
ability.
Mr. Allison ngroed that n ViuslneKß
man wns needed In the construction of
therannl. nnd paid ho brllevrd that
wild what the preHldeiit had In mind
when he employed Mr. Hhontp.
Mr. Stone recalled thp policy nn
nounced by the rnnal nuthorltle* last
rprlng with rpferenco to tho purchase
of foreign ships to be used In the canal
work when they could be secured more
cxpedltlously nnd more cheaply tfian
American vessels. The policy htta, hP
snld, met with his Instant approval but
he was -sorry to say that while It hnd
been "Inaugurated with much thunder
ing, It had gone out with a fizzle."
He said the policy of going abroad
for ships had been based on the theory
that there were no available ships to
be had In the United States nnd he de
clareU that there had bepn no change
In the conditiotm between May when
the policy was adopted, and July, when
the two ships were bought from the
Ward line at the price of $1,300,000. This
purchase, Mr. Btone contended, had
been made at the price given when two
vessels of equal caoaelty could have
been bought in England for $750,000.
Mr. flalllngpr said that the English
ships belonged to a concern thnt had
failed and were a bargain counter af
fair and they were disposed of to other
parties before the proffer nt tho price
given could be investigated.
Mr. Newlands spoke of the general
merits of the rannl enterprise, px
presslng the opinion that the canal
work should have been entrusted to
the geological survey, ns the irrigation
reclamation work hud 'been.
Mr. Culberson withdrew his amend
ment nnd the bill was passed without
division.
At 4:36 p. m. the senate went Into
executive session nnd Jit 4:53 adjourned.
HOUSE DISCUSSES INSURANCE
Indications That Debate on Subject
Will Be Prolonged
By Associated Press.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.— Tho house
indulged Itself again totlny to the ex
tent of four hours of what was many
times termed an academic discussion
of federal control of Insurance. It was
the fourth day of the debate and In
terCßt of members had appreciably di
minished. Democratic contention for
state rights predominated in the ora
tory. The Republicans who spoke con
fined themselves more to the committee
reference which should be made on the
subject of Insurance in the president's
message. Many views were expressed.
None of them, however, supported the
pending proposition to send the subject
to the ways and means committee.
Tho holiday recess was fixed from
LOS ANGELES HERALD: SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 17, 1905.
next Thursday to Janunry 4. For thp.
purpose of bringing out Information
showing the existence of n civil pen
sion list, the house naked the president
for the number of civil employes of the
government who hnd reached the age
of 70 years.
More than 105 members have applied
for recognition on the mihject of In
surance nnd th»re Is no disposition to
limit the debate.
Representative Norrls of Nebraska
cpened the debate. He saw objection
for referring the matter to nny but the
Judiciary committee, because In his
opinion a constitutional amendment
might bo. necessary before anything
could be done to regulate Insurance.
It wns pointed out by Mr. Stanley of
Kentucky that, thero wna great danger
to thfi liberties of the people In the
constant encroachment of federal courts
on matters properly belonging to state
courts. To give federal courts author
ity over an Insurance contract, which
he said whh the simplest contract,
would be to set thn precedent to glvp
the same Jurisdiction lo nil contracts,
which would be the death knell of
freedom and the right of trial by Jury.
Mr. Hulllvnn of Massachusetts paid
his rpspects to President Roosevelt by
stating that he did not believe him In
fallible either In his law, his state
policy or In ills recollection of conver
sations with distinguished visitors.
Arguing- ngalnst federal control of In
surance, Mr. Hulllvan maintained there
was ample slate mithorlty to regulate
legal abuses, and ho continued:
"Neither state nor national legisla
tures can legislate honesty Into a board
o? directors of high Ilnnnee sitting in
Now York nny more than they can
legislate thirst out of the citizens of
lowa, Kansas or Maine."

By Associated Press.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 1 6.— Secretary

from Major General Wood commending

tainments, know little of nrmy methods

they have always paid for their educa

penditure of men and money with ItH
resulting embarrassment in tho way
of inefficient troops and a large penr
slon list."

LABOR UNIONS SCORED

Harvard's Head Points Out That Our

By AMoclnterl Presd.
MOHTON, Dec. 16.— 1n nn nudrrsa
before thp Boonomlo club of Iloston last
night. Prrsldpnt Charles W. 131 lot of
Harvard, upraklng on "Immigration,"
said:
"It Is tlm labor unions who teach tho

That U the source nf all the agitation

have got into the Rood trades wnnt to

trades. Mr. Golnpers the othPf dny

country In that dlngulsp. 1 wnnt to
protest against that lino of argument,
thnt wo should try to keep out new
arrivnls bp.rfl.iinn our earnings will be
reduced. That Is not the real danger.
Have wages fallen in tho last fifty
years or risen? Yet Immigrants have
been coming by the millions. Our
laboring class— lf I niny use such a
term — hold a very unmannerly opinion
nbout tho newcomers. They havo not
confidence enough in their own supe
riority resulting from their own ad
vantages.
"I am no kind of a restrlctlonlst to
anybody, 'either In education, religion
or immigration. Wo tire all of us pret
ty content with the results of the Im
migration of the last eight generations.
It has been the source of our civiliza
tion and of our ldealp. Thero Is a good
deal of raco and religious prejudice
In the matter. Men wny: 'Can We di
gest this mass of Roman Catholics?'
Well, we have digested many million!;
of them, and they have turned out hu
mane, excellent citizens. What race
havo we digested with more difficulty
than the Irish? Yet In President
Roosevelt there nro two strains of
blood, one Dutch and the other Irish.
