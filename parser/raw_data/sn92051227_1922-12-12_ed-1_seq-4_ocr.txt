" Judge Burt J. Humphreys, of the

wudge Humphreys, shocked at the

J ndge Shocked .
Ton are a very young- boy, so
oung- that It shocks me to think
at a boy or your age could corn-
it crimes so brutal In their nature.
ou nave had every opportunity to
Ive a decent life, yet you have always

"whom a month in Jail is as good as
lifetime, while there are others who
ever should have their liberty-, and
I think ym -are one of those.
Niarge, and people in Jamaica were
rtectually afraid to remain alone in
I their homes, fearing that you might
j 'enter and do them bodily harm. I
iiam afraid you will never change,

Efforts were made to prove that
the boy was Insane, for his depre
dations were marked not only by
tehrewd criminal talent, but by acts
jof fiendish cruelty. The law decided
he was sane, but criminal.
Danjrroua Type.
Asked to comment on the KTuger
ase, Justice Franklin C. Hoyt, who
as studied many similinr cases while
residing over the Children's Court
eclared that this particular type of
because, being high-grade detectives,
Ilthey often escape interception which
IMa sure to apprehend those of lesser
'intelligence.
"It is easy enough to take care of
idiots and imbeciles -such cases solve
themselves usually," Justice Hoyt
began.
i "The higher grade defectives are
. not "recognized at first glance, and
ct they are always the ones liable
ito commit the most serious crimes
t the slightest suggestion.
"The insane can be recognized and
dealt with as the idiots and imbeciles
can.
"It Is these borderland oases that
are the most dangerous.
"We need smaller homes and smal
i ler schools in which to study these
more difficult types, the higher grade
: defectives.'
Tn answer to the expected sym
pathy so generally called forth by
The spectacle of a boy in prison. Jus
tice Hoyt makes answer:
Monaco Community.
"The rommunity is not safe with
such a boy at large.
"Until some change is effected in
Jus moral balance it is likewise un
safe to return him to the community.
"This type, which we meet occa
sionally, is the moral imbecile, sane
end abnormally intelligent rather
Than defiaiem mentally. But he has
no sense of moral values or any Inhi
bitions to restrafn him.
"With many cases we know Im
mediately that We are dealing with
defectives. With insanity it is dif
ferent, too: that is, conuparatively
easy to establish. The insane can be
ared for, and the subnormal can be
trained.
"Long sentences are necessary In
some of the 'custodian cases.' On

For instance, there wps the mem

who will carry t.o the gallows the re
membrance of having won in his last
competition with his fellow men.
And the Joyous chorus of
"M-a-a-a-a-s!" that greeted the 73

population "comes out" In the yard
and enjoys a track meet. The meet
tn;s year was most successful.
Ordinarily condemned men do not
compete. A negro won the baseball
tnrow, setting a new record. The
man doomed to die threw off his
letnargy. He was given permission
by Warden James Johnston to try. He
did not equal the new record. The
negro threw again. It fell short. The
condemned man ha,l won. He was
happy. Perhaps the negro, who has
out a tew years to serve, did not try.
Perhaps it was his way of making
happy his unfortunate co-prisoner.
"I always win!" was the sprightly
remark of John Ross, recent gland
patient, who ran like a youth of 22
instead of one of more than three

Atlanta, Ga., Dec. 12 "Don't argue
with the judge it's costly business."
This bit of priceless advics was voic

by an apology in court to Judge John
Humphries saved himself from a term
of twenty days in jail or a fine of
$200.
The alleged infraction in the case
of court rules came in the ease of
Elmer Oliver, former president of the
Oliver Rim Corrnpany, who was being
tried on a charge of embezzlement of
more than $100,009 of the company's
funds.
The verbal tilt between the attorney
who represented Oliver and the Court:
followed a ruling made by Judge
Humphries in permitting certain evi
dence involving a $1,500 transaction
Oliver was said to have made while
president of the rim company.
"They are trying to hatch up this
item, which never before has been
included in the charges," Attorney
Helman told the Court:
He attempted to read records con
cerning previous testimony, but was
interrupted by the judge.
"Tou needn't read that," the judge
said. "I am familiar with what ha
been testified."
"Then do jou propose to charge Mr.
Oliver with this item?'.'
"No; I'm not charging hirn with
anything," the judge replied.
"This charge ia " began Hey-
was the judge's warning.
"All right, certainly," replied tha
attorney.
"Mr. Sheriff, collect $100 from Mr.
Heyman, or keep him in jail ten

prised that a lawyer of your standing
should insist upon maintaining a dis

be paid, or you must accent the al

"I am also surprised at jour atti

"I a mgoing to give you another

Humphries said.
"I won't ipay it," announced th
lawyer. "I ll go to jail first!"

Court and asked that the sentence be
