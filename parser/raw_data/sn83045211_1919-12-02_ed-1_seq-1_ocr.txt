Forty-live hundred tons of refined

steamship City of Fairbury, at Vino
street wharf, for export to St. Xazalrc,
France.
During October 20,000 tons of sugar
were exported from Philadelphia, nnd
tliia was 'followed by 10,000 tonsduring
November.
Including the amount now being
loaded at Vine street, there will have
been JM.fiOO tons exported from this
port alone during the last nine weeks.
An explanation given at the pier is
that thi,s vast amount of sugar, being
sent overseas whilo Philadelphia if
severely rationed, generally to n half
pound a family each week, is owned by
Kngland; that England bought it in
tho raw, and hod it refined here.
Tho statement also was made at the
pier that the cargo came from the Ponn;

president of the refining company. The

OFFICE OPEN BOOK
WILSON'S REPLY TO
Director Says Councilman's At
tack on City Damage Suits Ad
vertises His Law Firm
FIGURES INACCURATE,
McADAMS DECLARES
Look as Though They Were
Compiled for Campaign Pur
poses, He Asserts
"Our office is an open book. Wo will
take all the cases we cau get."
This was the substance of Director
of Public Safety Wilson's reply to n
statement made yesterday by Select
Councilman Harry .T. Trainer regard
ing the large number of claims the law
firm of Director Wilson nnd Francis
McAdams has been obtainiug ngainst
the city, nrising over accidents due to
bad streets,
Mr. Wilson was found todny in the
privute office of Mr. McAdams, in the
Penn Square Building, wncn au effort
was mude to obtain n statement from
the latter. Mr. Wilson wheeled around
suddenly, before Mr. Mac-Adams had an
opportunity to reply, and said
"He has the same thing to say that
I have. Our office is an open book.
Wo will represent all the cases we ecu
get. We have done it in the past and
will do it in the future. Wc go before
a jury and take our chances, the same
as does any other lawyer.
Good Advertising,. He Sajs
"I don't care what Trainer says or
does not say. I hope he keeps it up. It
is good advertising for this office.
"In the last eight years before I be
came director we had nronortiouatelv
more cases listed for trial than in the
four years I have been director. No,
I won't say we did more' business ; wc
TvtuFmore "cases listed for1 trial, ""v "
s4
p.
"in tue last four years I have repre
scnted only one case in court. That
was last month, nnd it was n case
against a pnvnte party. It might work
two ways if I appeared In court- There
might be some one on the jury who had
a grievance against me. Or some juror
might have a relative in the depart
ment. "But let Trainer go ahead. That
statement was typical of Iilih."
Director Wilson's attentiou was then
drawn to the reference by Mr. Trniner
to the Occident records, of the Elec
trical Bureau, and he was reminded of
the inference that the Wilson-McAdums
law firm used these records to get busi
ness. He replied..:
"The F.lectricnl Bureau records are
open to every one even to Trainer. I
have never looked at the records. 1
hope this brings in more business."
Trainer's Figures Wrong
At that point Mr. McAdams bwuug
into tho conversation by saying :
"Trniner is wrong in his figures, I
am sure. But the exact amount of the
business I can't tell offhand without
going over our books. I don't know
Trainer, except to day a word to him.
It looks as it some one dug up that
information for campaign purposes and
then didn't use it.
"Perhaps it was turned over to Mur
doch Kendrick, but he had too much
sense to use it. Then, very likely,
it was turned over to Trainer,
"1 would, judge that from one-fourth
to one-half of the damage cases we try
are turned over to us by other lawyers.
That is because tho attorneys who get
them are not trial lawyers."
Puis It Up to II. C. of L.
Mr. McAdams said the high prices
prevailing for everything influenced the
verdicts returned against the city iu
dnmage cases.
"The verdicts are larger now than
before the war," he said, "because
jurle's have a revised sense of allies.
Some workmen make from $."000 to
$4000 a j ear, W'1Pn on, 's injured
juries feel thnt a verdict of scwral
thousand dollars is not, sufficient recom
pense for him."
Thero is a touch of the political in
the Wilson-McAdams office. Near the
door of Mr. McAdnins's private office is
a smnll photograph of Senator Vnre.
a three-quarter length photo, depicting
the senator at the wheel of a vessel.
It was taken ou a recent trip to Hog
Island.
Thomas .7. Meagher, another lawyer
named by Trniner in his statistics of
cases- against the city, said today :
"There is nothing 1 can say about
Trainer. I have been in business for
twenty years nnd intend to stny in it."
lie closed the interview sharply and
hurried to Common. Pleas Court No. 2
where he had a casa on the day's calen

that the tonnage during December will be equall) as large, The Increased
demand for anthracite iu,tho West is attributed to the strike in the soft coal

I.eililor
Washington, Dec. 2. Piesident Wil
son keeps Iiis best icw.s for tlie lust
iu his message to Congress today. The
industrial situation is the big problem
before the country, and the President
treats it in the final paragraphs of his
message, which bear more marks of
his editing or perhups writing thun any
other section.
, The rest of the document is oldently
of cabinet origin, members of tlie cnbi
I net having in response to invitation sub
mitted memoranda which have been iu-
flip eist of what the President lias
, . flrot, , n.ILtrinl VI At ion" ieo "
tallied in the following pnragraph:
i lie right ot individuals to strike
is inviolate and ought not to be inter
fered with by any process of govern
ment, but there is a predominant right,
and that Is the right of the govern
ment to protect all of its people and
i to assert its power and majesty against
, the challenge of any class.
I "The government, when it asserts
that right, seeks not to antagonize a
. class, but simply to defend the right
of the whole people ns against the ir
reparable harm and injury that 'might
be done by tlie attempt by any cluss to
usurp a power thnt only government
itself has n right to exercise as a pro
tection to nil."
Must Protect Whole People
Those words seem to squint in two
directions Organized labor has the.
right to strike and collective bargain
ing should be recognized. Hut again
in tills case Mr. Wilson fails to make
clear whether It is collective bargain
ing ns the labor unions understand it
and demand it, through existing unions
or collective bargaining through shop
committees to which tlie most con
servative employers offer no objection.
The President in the paragraph
quoted justifies the course tnken by his
administration in the coal strike.
There must be no interference with
the individual right to strike, but the
E?
owcr of the government to defend the
terests o? the whole people against ut
tark by uuy clasrf is asserted with great
fitinhasls.
