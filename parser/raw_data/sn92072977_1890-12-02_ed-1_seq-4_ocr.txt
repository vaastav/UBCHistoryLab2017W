Birmingham, Alabama, Dec. 1st. In
Shelby county, on Wednesday, John
Daniels, a negro, was arrested for a
criminal assault upon a white woman,
and placed in jail at Columbiana.
Thursday night a mob surrounded the

ley with the mob his deputy went into
jail and made Daniel put on a dress and
bDnnet, and then ordered the negro to
walk out through the mob. The sheriff
explained to the mob that the woman
was the cook at the jail going home. The
deputy followed Daniels close enough to
prevent his escape, and in this way they
passed through the mob and the prison

Washington, D. C, Dec. 1. Senate.
There was an unusually large attend
ance of Senators present at the opening
of to-day's session. The seats on both
sides of the chamber were nearly all
occupied, and the galleries were filled
with spectators. The most conspicuous
object in the chamber was a large bed
of roses surmounted by a dome-like
pedestal, on which strutted in the flush
and pride of victory, a rooster, emblem
atic of the Democratic success in the re
cent elections . This decorated the desk
of Mr. Voorhees.
Immediately after the Chaplain's
prayer the credentials of the two hena-tors-elect
frcm the new State of Wyom-
- 1 1 IT- nn rA
mg were presenieu uy mi. uuai,
when they were read, the two Senators,
Messrs. Carey and Warren, were escort
ed to the vice-President's desk ank took
A drawinar bv lot to decide their re
spective terms took place, the shorter
term closing March, 1893, falling to Mr.
Warrej, ami the loager one, closing
March, 1S95, to Mr. Carey.
A recess was then taken until
1:30 to await the coming of the
President's Message.
After the recess a report was made
house on Monday at 3 o'clock. Yester
day at that hour a goodly number of
people had assembled at the court house
to see what was to come off.
Mr. Jno. W. Thompson had just been
inducted into the office of the Clerk of
the Superior Court and was busily en
gaged in receiving the office, with vari
ous instructions, from his predecessor.
But a crowd riled into his office and
presently Mr. N. B. Broughton called
Mr. Thompson to "stand up." That
gentleman arose and Mr. Broughton
said:
Mr. Thompson, I am called on to
perform a very pleasant duty for myself
and some of vour friends. You have
had two severe frights recently. One was
when you wanted the nomination for
Superior court clerk ana learea you
would not get it. Then you had a pretty
bad fright because you were afraid you
would n t get elected: for you were run
ning against a man who was accustomed
to win tremendous victories. JNow, we
intend to fix you so you can have some
show in case you have any more frights.
Here is a handsome cane which 1 am
requested to present to you by your
friend, Prof. McK. Goodwin, who was
your competitor for the Democratic
nomination. This cane was cut from the
battlefield of Waterloo in 1889, by Prof.

ially in its relation to the Federal elec
tion bill. The caucus was in session for
nearly two hours. There was a large
attendance and no dissent from the
proposition to carry out the programme
agreed upon before the adjournment of
the first session to take up the Foderal
election bill at the beginning of this ses
sion and press it to a vote.
The Committee on Order of Business
was directed to prepare an order of busi
ness, the first measure to be considered
to be the Federal election bill.
The committee appointed at the last
session to co-operate with the Republi-
. can members of the Committee on Rules
in the preparation of a rule to provide
for calling the previous question, was
instructed to report some modification
of existing ruhs with this object in
view, and it was agreed that if the Dem
ocrats use obstructive tactics against the
Federal election bill, a propostion to
change the rules will be brought in im
mediately. The caucus was harmonious through
out. The action of the caucus does not de
termine the question of passing the
Federal election bill. There weie not
enough Republican Senators present to
guarantee absolutely that the change of
rules will be made.
preceded the time for the assembling of
the second session of the 51st Congress.
There was a good attendance on both
sides of the hall aud much good natured
badinage about the recent election Hew
across the centre aisle. On the desk of
the Speaker was a pyramid of flowers,
and there were other floral pieces on the
desks of Representatives Kerr, of Penn
sylvania, Holman, Harmer, Flick, Wil
son, of West Virginia, Atkinson, of
West Virginia, Vaux and Flower.
One minute before noon the Speaker
entered the hall and ascended the steps
to the Speaker's chair. The tap of his
gavel brought the House to order as the
hands of the clock marked noon.
Chaplain Milburu delivered a brief
prayer, and then the clerk began to call
the roll by States. The roll-call dis
closed the presence of 227 members, and
the clerk was directed to inform the
Senate that a quorum of the House had
appeared and that that body was ready
to proceed to business.
On motion of Mr. Cannon, of Illinois,
a resolution was adopted for the ap
pointment of a committee to join a
similar committea on the part of the
Senate to wait on the President.
Mr. Rogers, of Kaa3as, rising to a
question of the highest privilege, asked
that the oath of office be administered
himself in the able discharge of his
duties."
Mr. Thompson was completely taken
by surprise and showed it in his fea
tures and deportment. It was really
some moments before he could "get his
bearings," so to speak. He looked at
the cane in a dazed sort of way for a lit
tle while, then be earnestly remarked
his appreciation, which he said he could
not express as he felt it. He referred
to the campaign, and eaid that during
its progress the most kindly relations
had obtaiued between himself and Mr.
Upchurch, and all he hoped for was to
make as able and efficient and popular
officer as Mr. Cnas. D. Upchurch had
made. He felt special appreciation for
the very graceful action on the part of
Prof. Goodwin.
After the incident some one suggested
that hereafter Mr. Thompson should be
known as "Jno. Wellington Thompson

bought a ticket to New York, have been

after going North and interviewing In

that they were not to be found, and the

said has wired back for more money to
continue the chase. Yesterday your

He goes next to Henderson on the in

that, under the advice of the ministers
of the other churches there, the Young
Men's Christian Association declined to
extend an invitation to him, though he
is an enthusiastic member of the body
and has contributed largely to it. Our
