OFFICIAL PAPER OF MCLEAN CO
AND CITY OF WASHBURN.
FRIDAY, DEC. II, 1908.
J. J. Hill says no country will
ever prosper unless it is based
upon agriculture as its chief in
dustry and that in thirty years
he thinks, the population of this
country will be 200,000,000 and
that the present methods of agri
culture will be inadequate.
The United States troope will
soon leave Cuba. Tt will be
gradual and will take from -1 anu
ary 1 to some time in April.
The following are the estimates
of appropriations sent to congress
by the secretary of the treasury:
Indian affairs in North Dakota,
$142,i57o Bismarck $30,000:
Devils Lake $75,000 Minot $50,
000 rivers and harbors, Red river,
$7,5000.
A new postoffice ruling puts an
end to the publishing of names of
prize winners at a card party.
Let lis hope this will not also put
an end to beautiful prizes being
given.
The counties giving Taft the
largest vote at the recent election
were Ward first Cass next, Mc
Lean third, Williams fourth, Mor
ton fifth and Bottineau sixth.
The greatly increased vote in Mc
Lean, Williams, Morton, and
Bottineau counties indicates that
the empire is moving westward.
Some of the other valley counties
cast larger total votes, having more
for Bryan than some of the west
ern counties named.

We have a few such tronbles as
the Mandan Pioneer from which
we quote the following There
are just a few who have permitted
their subscriptions to lag behind.
Don't do it. You will die one of
these fine days and your family
will want a column obituary pub
lished free, and then your daught
er is soon to be married and you
will expect your home paper to
give her an Alice Roosevelt write
up, and all free. It always pays
to be prompt in paying your sub
scription to your local paper.
There are now over 300 graded
schools in this state with over
1500 teachers.
According to the pure food law,
storage eggs must be sold as such
or the dealer misrepresenting
them is liable to a fine of $500. or
six months imprisonment, or both.
This week the Leader has the
greatest number and largest ad
vertisements ever published in
any one issue of the paper. The
citizens of Washburn are beginn
ing to realize that it takes printers
ink to sell goods.
Let us stand right by Santa

there are no end of candidates for

placed in the Leader to the effect
that the price of the paper would
be changed from $1. to $1.50 a
year. We had a large circulation
and knew that it would make some
difference in that. Some persons
cannot realize that since the price
of paper has continued to advance,
a raise must be made in the sub
scription rate to make the news
paper pay. The price of print
paper will probably never be low
er than it is now, and the pro
spects are that it will go higher,
We have found that altho a few
have dropped off it is better to
have a smaller list at one dollar
and a half than a big list at one.
It is noticed that all papers are
raising their subscription price to
$1.50 and some to $2. a year.

in Washburn yesterday and had
some interesting things to tell
about the wreck on the N. the
night before. He had $200. in his
clothes at the time and when he
was clear of the wreck, he was also
clear of the money. He returned
to Bismarck the same day to put
in a claim against the company.

Here is a simple home-made
mixture as given by an eminent
authority on Kidney diseases, who
make the statement that it will
relieve almost any case of Kidney
trouble if taken before the stage of
Bright's disease. He states that
such symptoms as lame back, pain
in the side, frequent desire to
urinate especially at night pain
ful and discolored tirination, are
readily overcome. Here is the
recipe. Try it:
Fluid Extract Dandelion, one
half ounce Compound1^jKargon
one ounce Compound Syrup
Sarsaparilla, three ounces. Take
a teaspoonful after each meal and
at bedtime.
A well-known druggist here in
town is authority that these in
gredients are all harmless and
easily mixed at home by shaking
well in a bottle. This mixture has
a peculiar healing and soothing
effect upon the entire Kidney and
Urinary structure, and often over
comes the worst forms of Rheu
matism in just a little while. This
mixture is said to remove all blood
disorders and cure Rheumatism
by forcing the Kidneys to filter
and strain from the blood and
system all uric acid and foul,
decomposed waste matter, which
cause the afflictions.1 Try it if you
aren't well. Save the prescription.
The Batt^shlp to Win.
Recently this country launched "the
largest battleship in the world." Not
long ago England did the same thipg,
eclipsing Japan, which before that
held first place. There is still room
on tlie occan for the fleets of com
merce in spite., of these monsters, for
the added largeness ife often only a
few feet more of length or width or a
couple of thousand tons Increase to
displacement
We will have to wait for a well
fonght naval battle or perhaps a series
of battles before knowing which Is the
most efficient battleship In the world,
and in all probability that one will not
be the largest. Naval guns and. gun
nery are improving as fast as battle
ships are waxing In size.
