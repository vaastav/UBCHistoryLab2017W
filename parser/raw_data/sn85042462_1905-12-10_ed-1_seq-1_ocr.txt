EXCLUSION ACT WILL STAND
Members of Congress Say There Will
Be No Modification
By Associated Press.
CHICAGO, Dec. O.— A dispatch to the
Tribune from Washington says: Con
gress will not enact any legislation
modifying the Chinese exclusion uct.
As a result tho boycott of American
goods will bo reimposed shortly and
there will be a greater development of
the anti-foreign feeling throughout
China..-. :;■■. :
The prediction ys to tho attitude of
congress waa nuide yesterday by lead
ers of both house and senate.
Tho policy of the Chinese people Is
based entirely upon this attitude. In
edicts issued by the Chinese emperor
tho peoplo were urged to refrain from
boycotting American goods pending
action by congress.
The viceroys of various provinces
piocldlmed President Roosevelt had
given assurances that congress would
pass remedlary measures and that the
Chinese should contluo to purchase all
goods as heretofore until the purposes
of the legislative branch of the Ameri
can government developed.
It is understood the Chinese legation
lure has been making Inquiries an to
the prospect of action by congress, and
is satisfied there Is no chance what
ever of the enactment of a satisfactory
legislation.
A deadlock has occurred in the treaty
negotiations between Minister Rock
hlll and Na Tung of the Chinese for
eign office as a result of the refusal
of the former to nllow the admission of
: Chinese laborers into r the! American
I possessions in the Pacific.
■ ■:• In exchange for -this privilege Nn.
'Tung was willing to define the classes
of Chinese which should he granted
entrance Into -the United States, thus
authorizing the government to exclude
everyone who failed to como directly
within those classes. With congress
unyielding and treaty negotiations Im
[posslble of. successful conduct, the
president is confronted by tho proba
bility, of a serious blow to American
commerce in the Orient. During the
last year increase of export was chief
ly to China, Japan and four other
countries, amounting In the case of
the first named empire to $41,000,000.
<>C this sum $23,500,000 wrts in cotton
cloth. $10,000,000 In copper and J3,G00,000
in mineral oils.

MENACE OF CHILD LABOR

by Professor Adler
13V Associated I'resa. ,
WASHINGTON. Dec 9.— At yester
day's pension of tho national child la
bor- committee, Felix Adler of New
York city, chairman o( tha national
committee, ppoko on "Tho Menaco of
Child Labor."
Dr.. Adler said that while the Amer
ican conscience revolts against women
In certain parts of Kurope performing
hard labor In the Held*, there are In
tills country between one million and
two million child laborers. The evil,
he contended, was not only widespread,
but steadily increasing. There were,
ins stuted, about 10,000 children work
ing about the mines, about 7000 In
the glass industry and the number of'
child laborerß in the southern textile
mills hat* increased within a few years
from 24.000 to about 60,000. He Bald
there was reason to believe that In
other parts of tho country similar con
ditions exist. The cause of the evil he
declared to he "the American disease"
— the sat.ie disease the fearful symp
toms of which lately have been ex
posed In the investigation of the In-
Hurance cominlnßlon In New York —
t lie separation between business and
morals and the unscrupulous disregard
of rights when material success is ut
stake.
He declared, however, that the con
science of the people was everywhere
awakening und there were elgnu of
:i great moral upheaval and that the
children. should be the first .to obtain
the benefit.' ■■••■-»

premier in audience at Buckingham
palace Sunday evening in order to give
his formal approval of the ministry.
Arthur J. Balfour, addressing his
constituents at Manchester this after
noon, declined to discuss the platform
of tho Unionists or of the Liberals In
the coming election. Ho defended the
action of the Unionist government in
Its retention of office on the ground
that It was essential to wait until the
Anglo-Japanese treaty was finally con
cluded and other essential features of
tho government program carried out.
This had been done with the exception
of the redistribution bill, an outline of
which had been given to parliament,
but divisions within tho Unionist party
led tho government to tho conclusion
that it would be impossible at present
to carry a measure which demanded
absolute unity. ■ .r.-i .•.';■■
Tho late premier mado a strong plea
for unity during the elections. Mr.
Balfour predicted tho failure of the
Liberals to carry out their program,
which ho understood was the upsetting
of many things accomplished by tho
Unionists, but he hoped they would
stick to their resolution to follow the
lines of foreign policy of the. Unionist
government. ••> ■• - — •-

who had blundered in sending a letter
dictated by the grand Inquisitor.
Several dispatches were received In
a "fake" wireless telegram apparatus.
These were read, greatly to the amuse

Recovery of Two Points In Russian

Special to The Herald.
LONDON, Dec. o.— News from nus
sla, scanty ns It is, indicates that the
final crisis In her destinies la not yet
reached, but she remains In a chaos oC
blind, conflicting elements, out oC
which most tragic developments m&jr
issue any moment.
Past experience has shown that it la
impossible to draw any safe conclu

let up in one or other of tho various
strikes. Interest for the moment
centers greatly In Wltte. By many it
Is thought that, deserted by the mod
erates and feared by both extremes,
he is a spent force and his resignation
may come at any moment, leaving th a

and revolutionists face to face.
But tho St. Petersburg correspondent

"Wltte's position with the emperor Is
not weakened and ho will not volun
tarily resign." ' ,
He odds that, although it was from
court resources tho report circulated
that Ignatieff had dislodged htm, there
are the best grounds for stating that
the German emperor Is volunteerlns
counsel to the czar, and the kalaer la
a strong supporter of Wltte.
The recovery of two points In Rus
sian rentea on Thursday is regarded as
a belief in the high international fin

short trial to the western party dlstlnc- ■

left, center, etc., mean nothing at all.
