A DEMORALIZED STATESMAN.
Elbkwhibk we publish an interview
had by a reporter of the New York
Tribune with Hon. J. I. C. Atkins,
Representative in Congress from tLe
8th district of Tennessee, some of
the statements of which will attract
attention. Mr. . Atkins may be re
garded as
(he leading DeniocM-at in.
OoDgress from Tennessee. He served
during the last Congress as chair
man of the committee on appropna
- . - i a .,f !
lion, ma uiusii imiiuiLtiuL ci
n
House committees, save one that of
ways and means, ileis a geuueman ;
of acknowledged ability, and has al- j
ways stood high in his party. . He is j
a gentleman of education, having
graduated from the university
of Tennessee. He has had large in
fluence in public afi'airp, and what he
says is entitled to much more weight
than what is said by the average
politician. . ,
This being true, his utterances on
the State debt question will be re
ceived with astonishment. He is in
favor of repealing the law passed at
the last session of the Legislature
for the settlement of the State debt,
and why ? Is it because he believed
the law is wrong ? It cannot be
that, for he says he ha9 hitherto
stood for maintaining the faith and.
credit of the State and paying every
dollar she owes. He virtually
acknowledges the validity of
jthe debt, for. he says he
is willing to pay 50 per cent, of
the principle and 4 per cent, interest.
If it is an illegal debt, certainly he
would not favor paying any part of
it. U we believed the debt to be il
legal we would vote against paying
$ dollar of it
But what reason does ho give?
Hear it all ye people, who have look
ed upon Congressman Atkins as a
great man and a statesman. Why,
he says, the readjuters having suc
ceeded in Virginia the State credit
Pemocrats in Tennesse are " sadly
demoralized " and therefore he is in
clined to support the 50-4 proposi
tion, a proposition which
was voted down by the people
only a short time ago by an over
whelmyig majority, He says the
Republicans of Tennessee will op
pose any such a proposition, and a
great many State credit Democrats
will vote with them, and appears to
think the Democrats will bd beaten
as usual. Well, we must think
Congressman Atk'ns is himself fear
fully demoralized. ; When a man who
aspires to the rank of statesmanship i
gives so flirney a reason for changing j
his views onlso impertant a question,
., , , . , r
jt argues a state of demoralization t
4 !
trnly pitiable. Because the readjust-1
ers succeeded in Virginia, he will j
turn readjnster himself. Because j
his rmrtr i dmnri7a on a r.- i
A
tion which its leaders have been say
ing for more than ten years tbat they
were gcing to settle, and have not
settled et, he consents to Le de
moralized himself. And as, accord
ing to his view, his party is on the
run like a drove of frightened Texas
attle, he will ran with the others,
notwithstanding he admits that they
nre "doomed" to land in political per
dition. THE PRESS OX THE MESSAGE.

frank and dirtct than is customary

The message of yesterday is a well
written, business-like document,

belong to General Arthur liim&elf.

j strongest on foreign relations and fi-
nance : but it is not weak anywhere,
J and it will be generally accepted by

Everybody will admit the Presi
J dent's message to bo a buhincss-like

'
Arthur's mensage is by no jucitns

country, or even of a parly, bjit only
the personal opinions of the author
of the message, which are to be taken,
as the savin; ip, for what they are
j worth. New Y'ork World.
I The style of the meesage, it may
be edded, is exceedingly unpreten
tious and utterly devoid of rhetorical
flourishes or mere writing for effect.
It is not probable that it will take
rank with the effusions of a higher
order of statesmanship, but it will be
recognized as the production of at
least a tolerably clear-headed and
eonmionssense matter of fact man of
business. Commercial Bulletin'.
President Arthur's- first annual
message will stand with the best of
n'nety-one which have been made by
his predocessors. Presidential mes
sages have lately come to be mere
summaries of department reports.
President Arthur's iu not, and he has
thrown about the entire instrument
a dignified consciousness of his posi
tion ag the head of a great nation,
which is commendable as it is rare
in these annual State papers. Right
or wrong in his recommendations he
is nowhere commonplace j and in
dealing with the foreign relations of
the Government, a topic on which
his predecessors have been too often
either barren or blundering, Pres
ident Arthur is at once suggestive
and felicitous. Philadelphia Press.
(Rep.)
Whatever may have been the past
opinions of men as to the capacity,
the fitness, the partisanship of Lr.
Arthur, it must be allowed that a
man who can thus, coming from what
is regarded as the extremest wing of
his party, catch the spirit of the
times, adapt himself practically to
the prevailing sentiment of "the
country, seize upon and present its
I leaclmg themes and the points up-
; permost in the public mind, has in
the act given indications of possess
ing tbat practical statesmanship
j which is now so much needed.
! When this is the case, considering it
as an established truth that the
CQuniry is more interested in what
it receives than in the ciue.tion from
whom it may receive it, carping, and
narrow partisan criticism would be
ou' PJace- - ;
Thorough d'scusnon is an essen-
i , . . a , . ,
tial element to f ecunng the best pol-
icVf aU(i part- differences and criti-
cism must and ehoull continue,
AYhen this country ceases to have its
MSt lines OI progress WOTKea 0HP
through party it will cease to have
free discussion and caase to be free.
We do not agree with all Mr. Arthur
says, nor as to . what we accept do we
agree in detail in all things -, but his
suggestions are so entirely to the
practical business sense of the coun
try that partisan criticism is dis
armed and his suggestions must be
tried calmly upon their merits.
Nashville American. -
Presidedent Arthur's first message
is on the whole a very creditable
paper. The number of topics it has
become the custom to mention in a
President's mesEage is so large that
it would be unjust to complain of
the length of the document. Presi
dent Arthur has contrived to say
something of .value on a, great many
of them, and to dismiss others with
out expressing an opinion, but also
without great - waste of words.
With . regard to most subjects he
summarizes the reports of the differ
ent secretaries. " He recommentfs an
increase of the army and the build
ing of a navy. 'He . sets forth the
savings made in the postal service
UMid urges a vigorous prosecution of
those chargeable with the Star rcrate
frauds. He ' approves v the Indian
policy which has been advocated in
President's messages and', depart
ment rcpoils- lor several years, and
recommends the legislation necessary
to give it general effect. But the
most interesting parts of the message
aro unquestionably those vhieh refer
to our foreign relations, to our finan- :
ciai policy, and to tbe civil service.
Upon the subject of civil service
refcr-m the President has evidently
bestowed much consideration. He j
recognizes the existence of great
evils in the ww prevailing system,
and tho necessity of a reform. Ho
points out iu tue clear and forcible
language of his letter of acceptance
to what objects that reform should
be diree'ed. "Original appointments
should be based upon ascertained
fitness; the tenure of ofiice should
bo stable ; positions of responsibil
ity should, so far .as practicable, be
tilled by the promotion of worthy
and efficient officers." As to the
method by which "fitness" is to be
ascertained, President Arthur admits
that the system of competitive exam
inations as carried on in Great Brit
ain has produced very Fatisfactory
re&ults ; but he adds that it is cou
pled there with certain features, such
as life tenure, a limitation of the
maximum age at which an applicant
cau enter the service, and a system
of pensions, which would not be re
ceived with favor in this country.
Admitting this for argument's sake,
then the fact would ttill remain a
fuct which is also recognized by the
President that competitive exami
nations have been carried on with
excellent results also in this country,
as in the New York custom house
and other places, without being
coupled with such features, and the
President gives no reason why they
should not be continued end extends
ed over a large rpart of the service
in the Bhape already tested. The
problem is' to put a "system of ap
pointment bast d upon ascertained
merit in. the place of a system of
appointment by favor. While the
President acknowledges the necessi
ty of this, and expresses at the same
time some doubt as to competitive
examinations,, he does not suggest
any other method which he considers
more practicable. But he promises
j his concurrence and faithful support
' if Congress should pass a law estab
j lishing competitive tests, which, un
I der the ciicum stances, is all that
; could have been expected. The
i President's r.tterances on the civil
service are not only valuable for the
j suggestions they contain, but as a
j sure sign that this subject has taken
! too firm a hold upon tli6 attention of
I the American people to be dismissed
with mere unmeaning phrases.
! On the whole it may be said that
j President Arthur's message deserves,
i and if we may judge from the ex
i preesions of opinion we have seen
has had, a respectful and even hearty
I reception from tbe American people.
