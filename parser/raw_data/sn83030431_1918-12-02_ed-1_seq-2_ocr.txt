points and nn explanation of or
npology for fslllita to consider the
Senate In making tip the peace mis
sdon It Is admitted that the present
trained relations between the Prcsl
dent and Congress may be relieved to
umi extent.
However, unless ths council of the
older and calmer (Senators and nepre
tenUMvea finally prevail before Presi
dent Wilson leaves the House of Rep
resentatives to-morrow he. way be
called on to explain tnen and there
stoma of, tho questions In the minds
or congress.
Plan to Quia President.
"Republicans have been busy for the
past two or threo days looking up
precedents and parliamentary law to
cover the situation whon tho Presi
dent Is before Congress. Many of
them are of the opinion that under
tho procedure which guides Congress
tho President Is presumably there to
be Interrogated. They believe that If
tho Speaker recognizes a member of
the House while the President Is there
any queries not distinctly out of order
may be put to the Presldenfthrorfgh
the Speaker. If It Is done, which ap
pears highly doubtful on account of
the circumstances, the president can
not well avoid .some sort of answer.
The procedure which will bo fol
lowed. If It Is finally, determined to
question tho President on his mission
abroad, would be governed by the
standing rules of the House. Inthe
view of parliamentarians, any member
of the Hons could interrupt the
President at any point In his speech
by merely arising and. say.tnr "Jlf,
Speaker," , ,, .
Han- the Ut Would Com 0-,
' If a Senator made the Interruption
he would c-'dress himself to Vice
President MarCiiall, who will preside
with Speaker Clark.
if the Vice-President or the Speaker
recognised the Senator or Representa
tive It would Insure the queries being
made even If the President declined to
answer them.
It Is believed that in thevent of the
attempt to question the President It
will be done by a member of the
House, as the Senators will be In the
House chamber as guests of the lower
body. Should a Representative wish
to make the attempt the procedure
would be as follows:
"Mr. Speaker,"
Speaker Clark "For what purpose
does the gentleman rise?"
"T6 ask If the President of tho
United States will yield to permit an
Interrogation." ,
The Speaker would then state
whether he would recognlws the Rep
resentative for that purpose. The
questlQjjr would then be repented to tho
President himself by the Speaker and
the President could then yield or not
as he saw fit.
Reports that1 the Seriate might de
cline to ko Into Joint session wero
current to-night, but this radical
course wait generally regarded as not
likely to materialize.
Qnratlnn far the President.
It is said the President has heard j
of the questions ' which Republican '
Representatives hail, prepared to pro
pound to him and might refer to them
In his address. Theser questions fol
low: First Why has the 'President found
It necessary to take pver the. cables
after the armistice waa signed?
.Second What dots the President
mean, by freedom of the seas?
Third What does tho Ej'esldf.nt
mean by the removal of eco'nomfc' pair'-1
rlers as stated In the third oTnis fourv
teen points?
FourthIs the President going to J
commit the nation to a policy of free
trade In view of tho last elections?
Fifth Whether the President realty
believes that he reiiresents the feeling
of the American people in view of the
repudiation of his leadership and
whether ho still pretends to pose as
the soul of American leadership?
Up to a late hour It luul been Im
possible to ascertain definitely whether
any or all of the questions would be
asked. It was said that Republican
leaders. Including William Howard,
Taft and others, were counselling
strongly against U.
Aside from tho International aspect
of the President's address to Congress
to-morrow leaders of the Democratic
Prty In both houses are looking to tho
President to outline at least come sort
of prpgramme for tho session to be In
augurated to-morrow.
Consrrii Without Programme.
Except for the business of trying to
pass the revenue bill and the regular
supply IiIIIh Congress has no pro
gramme of its own. TSienB IcuiWs lock
to the President to make some sort of
retrenchment suggovtions, although
Congress is to begin action to-mgrrow
toward cutting off the war appropria
tions which hatt not already been used
up and cancelling war contract au
thorization. In addition to tno prograir.mo for
the ae&ston which the President may
desire, Congress expect the President
to lay before it its conception of how
tha business or the Government is to
he run with the Chlof Kxecutlve out
of the country and out of reach. Con
firns U keenly Interested in. hojy the
President proposes to express his ap
proval or disapproval of logUldtlon.
The President ts preparing an Im
portant message to Congress, an the
subject, and It U likely that It will be
a part of his address to-morrow, it it
Is not the message will be delivered
early in the session, probably before
the President's return from France.

By the Aitodalii Prut,
Cofr-viiao!, Nov. 30. Further rev
elations showing that former Kmperor
William of Germany Is seeking to es
cape responsibility for bringing on
the war are contained In an article by
Dr. Gcorg Wegener appearing In the
Cologrra OaxeUe recounting a conver
sation which the writer had with the
Emperor Just before he fled. The Em
peror attempted to shift the blame
for the world conflict to the shoulders
of Dr. Theobald von Bethmann-Holl-weg,
former Imperial Chancellor, and
Gottlieb von Jsgow, former Minister
of Foreign Affairs.
"Against my will they sent mo to
Norway," William is quoted as hav
ing safd. "I did not wish to under
take the voyage because the gravity
of the situation after tho murder of
Archduke Francis Ferdinand waj.
clear at first sight. But the Chancel
lor said to me:
" 'Your Majesty must take this voy
age In order to maintain peace. If
your Majesty -remains here It 'un
doubtedly means war and the world
will lay to your chargo responsibility
for this war.'

"Welf. I then undertook the voyage
During all thts time I received" no
reports from my Government con
cerning current events. StrhHly
speaKlng, I learned only from Nor
wegian newspapers of what waa oc
curring In tha world, and In this way I
learned of the Russian mobilization
measures.
"But when I heard that the British
fleet had put to sea I returned of my
own accord. They had nearly caught
me. On my orders German ships re
turned at once to the security of Nor
wegian harbors, Later It would not
have been possible for them to do so."
The Emperor then mentlntd declara
tions of Gen. W A. Boukhomlinoff,
nusslan Minister of War, during the
investigations which occurred after
ward, which he later altered to the
statement that he had not ordered real
mobilisation, but only readiness for
mobilization. The Emperor, however,
Insisted on the correctness of the first
declaration, according to which the
Czar had been caused by the Kaiser to
recall his order for mobl'atlon.

to make preparations for war. From

for these movements, and thus they

The big transport, which was one

Everything uboard the ship Is prac

anys: .
"The situation Is becoming acute,

Tut lUouu, Dec. 1. According to a!
Dutchman who has Just arrived In j
Holland. Hamburg is entirely in the
hands of plundering Bolshevik soldiers '
and sailors. He said he gave a good
dinner and 200 marks each to three '
memlfers of the Soviet in order to ob
tain a passport. At the frontier the of-'!
flclala refused to recognize the pass-1
port, necessitating bribes of several '
hundred marks more.
Every policeman in Hamburg, he ,
said, is accompanied by a Bolshevik
guard armed with i evolvent und a ,
knife. He says the people expect their ,
tyranny will cease when the soldiers '
from the front return nml ihnt f, r.-.,.. '
ular democratic government then will
bo established. Meanwhile, he says,
the .Red Guard bullies are extorting
frightful taxes from the people.
Returning German soldiers are still

burned the red flatr nuhllrfv in c-J
rep fighting occurred and tho Soviet !
Anally waa, Imprisoned. The supreme .
army command apparently proposes to
remove the military headquarters from i
Cassel to Berlin, ignoring tho Berlin 1
uovernment 'a orders. The Potsdam
Soviet has resolved to use the rooms in
tho ra&lle as a. remedy for want of
dwellings.
Tho Independent Socialist party in
Berlin has refused to Join the majority
Socialists In a refusal to oervpt the
Bavarian ultimatum demanding the
resignation of Dr. Solf and others. The
split between the libert group and the '
Haase group therefore is decisive.
Tho VcMtlcho lleitung learns that '
Hamburg sailors entered Herr Ballln's i
office November 8 and demanded the
surrender of the building for the pur
poses of tho revolution. Herr Hallln
who previously had been affected with
heart trouble, also had Just reed the '
armlstltc conditions, and had u stroke
of paralysis, from whloh ho died. News ,
of the Kaiser' abdication arrived an
hour before Hallln expired.
The last time Ballin tried to ac-,

GERMAN ELECTION
DATE IS PROTESTED
Called Too Early to Adopt
Socialist Policy.
By the, Aloclnttd Frttt,
Biruk, Dec. 1 In tha opinion of
the Majority Socialists and tho bour
geois, according to Via Frclhclt, tho
date, February 16. fixed by the Council
of People's Commissioners for holding
an election to tha Constituent Assem
bly, Is too early. It Is maintained that
more time is needed to put into effect
a pure Socialistic policy.
The Independent Socialists have
stated the threatened separation of the
Rhine Province and Bavaria makes
It imperative that an early election
be held.
Tho bourgeois and Socialistic press
agreo tho Soldiers' and Workmen's
Congress, which meets December 16,
will accept tho election date. Dele
gates to the Congress will be chosen
In haphazard fashion. The Berlin Ex
ecutive Committee of te Soldiers' and
Workmen's Council, which called the
Corvpress, Is said In some quarters to
have little real authority outsldo Ber
lin. Anybody at any nlace calling ltlf
a Soldiers' and Workmen's Council
will be nblo to send delegates. The
control of credentials will be difficult,
and tills has led to fears In certain
tactions that the Congress will be
packed. -
Even optimists are discouraged by
the apathetic attitude of the bourgeois
and the untiring nctivity of the
Spartacus Group, or Radicals.
Dr. Hnrtmann to-day handed to Dr.
W. 8. Solf; the aerman Foreign Sec
retary, credentials to tho peace con
ference as representative of the German-Austrian
republic.

Volk '.rMuna, declaring conflicts with
the Soldiers' and Workmen's Councils
will bo avoided. He requested at the

from Interfering with the army com
manders. No offence will be taken to the dlt

ON HOSPITAL SHIP
Northern Pacific Docks "With
Herons After Stormy
Passage Across.
GALES CAUSED DELAYS
Men Will Bo Transferred to
Various Stations in City
To-day.
The first American hospital ship to
reach New York from the war sonc
rodo. Into the harbor last night with
her superstructure covered with ice
and the 1,100 wounded men aboard her
still suffering as a result of some of
the worst weather encountered In
many months In tho shipping lanes
of the north Atlantic.
Sho was the Northern- Pacific, and
her officers, admitting that the big
ship had pounded headlong Into three
separate storms, volunteered tho In
formation that there wasn't a man
aboard who had been able to obtain a
full night's sleep from' tho moment
3ho drew out of sight of land several
days ngo. The crossing, they said, was
'.he slowest the Northern Pacltlo ever
had made, bocauso the ship's crew,
from csptatn down to the deck
squads, were doing everything they
could to make things as easy as pos
sible and as comfortable for the
wounded men she waa bringing back
home.
The transport was expected to reach
here at 7 o'clock yesterday morning,
but with full steam ahead she ran
straight Into another hard gate twenty-five
miles off the entrance to the
harbor and again was delayed. The
first storm was encountered when the
transport had Just left Liverpool but
it did not last long, and the ship's of
flcers hoped that the wounded men
would not get another taste of such
treacherous weather.
Only a short time afterward, how
ever, another gale, broke, and. the big
ship tossed and pounded In the heavy
seas. Only hulf of tho wounded men
wero so far recovered that they were
able to be out of bed, and many of
these still could move about only with
tho aid of crutcjies. The others ap
proximately -E0O of them had 11 hard
time of It. unable to sleep, and not a
few of tlv?m so seasick that the sur
geons had a hard time to give them
the. attention they required.
As soon asthe Northern Pacific
reached the harbor she was hurried o
Pier 8, at Hoboken, and made fast.
The men who were able to bo out of
bed were on deck as the ship came up
the hay, and they let out a whoop of
Joy as they tossed caps and crutches
and everything else thiowable, when
the Htatue of Liberty dropped Into
sight. No boisterous welcome awaited
tin wounded heroes at the pier, how
ever, for the crowd that stood and
shivered all day waiting for the
Northern Pacific to arrive Imd
dwindled bv the time the pier was
reached, and the soldiers went to bed
to await transfer to hospitals this
morning.
The only unwounded men aboul the
ship beside the crew, surgeons and
nursea were 400 sailors picked up at
the laat minute before sailing. The
men with the wound stripes .said the
surgeons and nures performed a won
derful Job in ministering to them dur
ing the storms. They said they were
coiufortablo ull the way over as a re
sult of the surgeons' and nurses' devo
tion to duty, but the doctors admitted
the men in tho cots had had a tad
time of It. Many of the injured had
loat legs, others are minus arms, and
still more are so severely wounded that
It will be several months before they
aic able to get about.
Arrangements have been made to
have the men taken In Red Cross am
bulances, beginning at S o'clock this
morning, to debarkation hospitals In
various pnrts of the city. Tho sur
geons fcaid they expected a'.l would bo
off the ship by noon at the latest.
