THE WEEKLY TRIBUNE,

Tba fonKU nrnura is the oldest paper in
(forth Dakota and the aim is mads to make it a
parfbut encyclopedia of Dakota affaire. Itsoiran
'irt'™ is large,both in the territory and the States.
The DiHiT TBiBim*, like the weekly edition,
the fall associated press dispatches, is

president's message is not of a
striking or sensational character. There
is nothing in it that is liable to be copied
in the illustrated novels, nor does he in
any way foist a bomb into the business
camps of the country. The message is a
plain, oommon sense document which
bears upon it the impress »f a time hon­
ored otistorn, as muoh as the offspring of
an urgent necessity. On all questions
the president is pretty sound, and his re­
marks on the subject of coast defense,
pensions, the Indians, the department of
agriculture, the labor question, and sub­
sidized railroads, are such as might be
expected from a man of good executive
ability and discretion- His sweeping
recommendation that the timber culture
and pre-emption laws be repealed is the
most objectionable feature of the mes­
sage, and the only redeeming point in
this respect is the confidence of the peo­
ple that congress will not act upon the
recommendation. Aside from this one
blow at the northwest—and those ac­
quainted with the need of encouragement
to draw tHe common people from the
over crowded and exhausted east to the
broad and generous plains of the north­
west will agree that it is a blow at th%
progress of the oountry—aside from this
unnecessary recommendation, the mes­
sage is sound and conventionally "safe."
A FORTUNE awaits the man who shall
invent a means of heating railroad cars
without the use of stoves. The greatest
loss of life and property in railway acci­
dents is caused by fire. Eleotrioity has
already taken the place of lamps on some
of the roads, and it only remains for the
heat question to be settled, when travel­
ing will be about as safe as remaining at
home. Without going into details, the
TRIBUNE is of the opinion that a car im­
mediately in the rear of the engine might
be fitted with a boiler, the coaohes fitted
with steam fixtures, and the train heated
comfortably and safely by steam. It
might be a little more expensive than the
present system of stoves, but when the
item of loss of life and property caused
by the present system is considered, it is
doubtful if the difference in cost would
be great.
THE Cooperstown Courier, which re­
flects the sentiments of Member-elect
Adams, says the argument used by those
in favor of cutting down the exemptions,
that the oredit of the farmers will be im­
paired, is just the reason why nothing
should be done with the present law.
The farmers' credit is what ruins him.
If he had none, his land and his hay
rake Would remain unincumbered and
his family would wear good clothes and
be happy.
THE legislature and the constitutional
convention of the new "state", meet on the
same day at Huron, but "Speaker" Eddy
of the legislature says that body will take
no aotion until the other determines
whether it is advisable for South Dakota
to assume the funotioDs of statehood.
A YANKTON correspondent admits that
the United States court is likely to be
removed, and intimates that home influ­
ences will be responsible if thin event
takes place—fellows who were antago­
nistic to the members of the legislature
recently elected.
AOOOBDING to the Enterprise, Pat
Walsh has been unanimously endorsed
for the postmastership at Henry, Ood
dington county. The name ought to be
sufficient guarantee of the candidate's
civil service loyalty and he'll probably be
appointed. ______________
PRESIDENT CLEVELAND, in his mes­
sages, letters, and, in fact, all official doc­
uments, is the most verbose president the
oountry ever had. His last message to
congress contained over 16,000 words,
and his first one contained 22,000.
THE Canton Advocate is another South
Dakota paper that will, before a year
passes, be agin" the new exeoutive of Da­
kota—if one is appointed. The TRIBUNE
will tell the Advocate how it knows thin
some time.
THE Fargo electric light plant is for
sale at auction and the Republican urges
the city to bid it in and run the business
hereafter.
AN ACCIDENT on the Northern Paoific
id BO rare that when one does happen it
causes muoh comment All day yester­
day the wreck on the Minnesota division
was the subject of conversation, and in
the absenoe of reliable particulars, the
wildest oonjecturee were indulged in.
The hope was cherished that the earlier
reports regarding the death of Mail Mes­
senger Tennis were untrue, but the an
rival of the train in the afternoon con­
firmed the report. Mr. Tennis was one
of the most popular and faithful moil
messengers, and brought the first mail
oar to Bismarck.
OFFICIAL returns from all the counties
in the territory have been received, and
the table in another column is the first
correot statement of the "vote for delegate
yet published. The total vote of the ter­
ritory was 104,811, of which Mr. Gifford
received 66,932 and Mr. Day 37,879, a
majority for the republican nominee of
29,053. In North Dakota Mr. Gifford re­
ceived 23,538 votes and Mr., Day 15,508.
In South Dakota Mr. Gifford received
43,394 votes and Mr. Day 22,871. In
other words, Mr. Gifford received 60 per
oent. of the total vote in North Dakota
and 66 per oent. of the total vote in South
Dakota. Beckoning five inhabitants to
each voter, the usual ratio, the territory
has a population of 524,055. It is abso­
lutely safe to reckon on half a million
disfranchised souls in the territory. Da­
kota oasts more votes than the following
states and territories: Arizona, Col­
orado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Mon­
tana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, Utah, Washington and Wyo­
ming.
COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION DUN
LAP has had the thoughtfulness to send
out the following circular to his eastern
correspondents. It. would be well for
business men generally to call the atten­
tion of their eastern correspondents to
this matter. Something valuable—notifi­
cation of notes maturing, drafts, and
things of that sort—may have been on
the illfated car:
BISMARCK, Dec. 4, 1886:
To CORRESPONDENTS AND OTHERS: The
eastern mail, including all mail sent via St
Paul, due to reach Bismarck on Wednesday,
December 1st, was destroyed by fire, result­
ing from a railway accident on the morning
of that day.
Correspondents and other parties who
may have written to this office under the
dates of November 28th to 30th, or as early
as the 26th, if situated east of Chicago, or
west of Omaha, excepting only cases where
replies have been received, are respectfully
requested to duplicate their letters, at as
early a date as possible. By so doing they
will confer a very great favor.
"Very respectfully, LAUREN DUNLAP.
NOTE.—Newspaper exchanges will place
the office under many obligations by calling
attention to the above.
MR. FRANK GREENE, of Mandan,
wanted an opinion from Land Commis­
sioner Sparks. He wanted to know if a
poor settler, who had had hard luck and
lost his crop, would not be allowed to
leave his claim a short time during the
winter—to earn something for the sup­
port of himself and family—without run­
ning a risk of being hunted down by
Sparks and have his land forfeited. In
reply Mr. Sparks says as little as it is
possible to say without expressing an
opinion of some kind. Mr. Greene is re­
ferred to former decisions and rulings of
the land office, which may or may not
answer the point in question.
HERE is an opinion from the Mandan
Pioneer:
The enemies of Judge Francis will for­
give Mr. Sparks much of his foolish non­
sense if the land commissioner is success­
ful in snuffing out Judge Francis.
And here is one from the Mitchell Re­
publican:
Judge Francis, of Bismarck, is said to be
in danger of losing his head for his recent
decision, virtually reversing one of Sparks'
rulings. The judge can well afford to die
in a cause like this. The people of Dakota
will be only too glad to honor him with any
gift in their bestowal.
Now THAT so much is being said re­
garding needed railroad legislation, why
not include the sleeping car tariff? The
fare between Bismarck and St. Paul and
between all points on the Northern Paci­
fic is far in excess of any ether road and
ought to be reduced to a figure that would
permit a man of moderate means to enjoy
the luxury now only indulged in by the
wealthy or reckless.
HON. ABE BOYNTON was in Mitchell
Thursday and to the Republican said that
Governor Pierce was doing well and could
be trusted in tl^e management of affairs
this winter. He did not look for his suc­
cessor to be appointed until spring. Mr.
Boynton will be in Bismarck during the
legislature.
THE Fargo Sunday Argus' new head
and the "double-jointed" type used in
advertising are having the desired effect
—bringing out comments from the terri­
torial press. If there is anything that
pleases Major Edwards, it is comments,
good, bad or indifferent.
MUCH space is given the president's
message this morning. The message, as
delivered, contains over 16,000 words, and
Was sent out to all associated press pa­
pers. Of course tne message has been
necessarily abbreviated for publication
in the TRIBUNE.
MAJ. EASTERLY has been notified by
the department that his jurisdiction as
special land inspector has been extended
to cover all Dakota—all other inspectors
withdrawn. The major is a whole regi­
ment? in himself, and can cover the terri­
tory completely.
THE responsibility for the recent dis­
aster on the Northern Paoiflo seems to
be settled upon Train,' Dispatcher Cole,
of Brainerd, an old servant of the road,
having twenty years' experience in teleg­
raphy. And yet this man would not, in
-tentionally, have harmed a hair of any
person's head. It is said that 180 train
orders were sent out from Brainerd. on
the day of the wreck, and half as many
are sent every day. Is it a wonder that
in twenty years a mistake would be
made? Dispatcher Cole is entitled to
sympathy rather than censure. Two
preoious lives have been 'snuffed out, not
through criminal intent of man, but by
permission of Him in whose charge is
the destiny of all mankind.
THE returns-of the recent election in
Montana have been canvassed and the
result declared. There were 32,262 votes
oast, of whioh Mr. Toole received 17,990
and Mr. Sanders 14,272, a democratic ma­
jority of 3,718. It is olaimed by the Hel­
ena Independent that this vote repre­
sents a population of over 160,000 and a
strong sentiment in favor of statehood.
Joint admission |with Dakota is urged.
This is the sentiment expressed by Dele­
gate Toole in Washington a few days ago,
and it is likely that (this scheme will be
pushed for all there is in it This is all
right, looking from a Montana demo­
cratic standpoint, }but here in Dakota
there is a wide 'difference of .opinion as
to the best way to enter the Union—
whether it shall be as two states or as
one grand whole. The most satisfactory
measure for Dakota would be the grant­
ing by congress of an enabling act and
the right to determine by ballot whether
statehood for one or two Dakotas is de­
sired. The question could then be dis­
cussed pro and oon free from any other
issue, and a result obtained under such
conditions would not only be binding
but satisfactory. There are strong ob­
jections to an arbitrary settlement of the
question by congress. People differ on
the division issue, but if'the people them­
selves have an opportunity to settle the
matter, true loyalty to American institu­
tions and American customs guarantees a
graoeful submission of the minority to
the will of the majority.
THE ^Jamestown Capital, the leading
democratic daily of the territory, has this
to say about the governorship:
Now that there is not unfounded general
understanding that Governor Pierce is soon
to retire from the office of chief executive
of this territory, the subject of the guber­
natorial succession is alive and prominent
one before the people. Governor Pierce
has fulfilled the position with honor to
himself and a faithful regard for the best
interests of the territory. His only antag­
onism in the discharge of duty has come
from the combination of politicians in the
republican party, who sought only their
own personal interests regardless of those of
the whole people of the territory. The
democrats have almost universally recog­
nized the governor's honesty and fairness
in the discharge of the duties of his office
and have given him the eredit that was due
him. The coterie of South Dakota repub­
licans have alone disparaged him and
vented their vindicative spleen upon liim
because they could not use him in further­
ing their capital removal and other
schemes. Now that the question of his suc­
cessor is uppermost in the minds of the
people it is pleasing to note the unanimity
with which popular sentiment, and es­
pecially that of the democratic party
of the territory, centers on Hon.
M. H. Day for the position. The
recent magnificent canvass he made and
which was made for him for delegate to
congress, marks him a special object
BISMARCK W£JEKLV TRIBUNE: FRIDAY. DEC. 10. 1886
for
the distinguished position of chief execu­
tive of the territory. The Capital assumes
to say that the appointment of Mr. Day to
the office of governor would give better
satisfaction to the democratic party and
the whole people of the territory than the
appointment of any other man that could
be named, and when a successor to Gov.
Pierce shall be appointed, we hope Mr.
Dav will be the man. No man is better
known to the whole people, and none
knows the condition ana diversified inter­
ests of the whole territory better than he.
THE Fargo Republican is getting to be
so large and so good a paper that one is
almost tempted to believe that at least
one territorial paper is prospering.
Either this, or the energy and enterprise
of the Jordans are increasing every day.
THE Minneapolis Journal says that
Gov. Mellette's call for a special session
of the legislature is just as formidable a
looking document in print as Gov.
Pierce's Thanksgiving proclamation, but
it won't lead to so muoh satisfaction.
THE total vote in Washington territory
was 47,227, not half as many as Dakota
polled, yet enough to entitle the territory
to statehood. Dakota is not the only
"child of tjie government" denied mater­
nal care.
THE Duluth News continues to keep
right up with the prospenty of Duluth,
and sometimes it looks as though it was
ahead of the times. Colonel Lounsberry
is devoting his best energies to the enter­
prise.
THE Brookings PresB suggests the
name of Hon. G. A. Matthews for the
presidency of the council. It says he is
a man of unusual executive ability and
would be just the man for the place.
THE Sioux Falls Argus, in speaking of
the governorship and the probability of
a change, says that "rumors are like
white wings in the beautiful little song—
hey never grow weary."
IF DELL COY continues to be as ener­
getic as he was in the make-up of the
last issue of the Pierre Signal, that paper
will soon have an enviable reputation for
genuine humor.-
LIEUTENANT GBEELY pronounces as
foolhardy the scheme of Colonel Gilder
to make the north pole. He has been
there—near there—himself and knows
whereof he speaks.
LAST summer the Boston Herald em­
ployed Mr. J. B. Harrison as a special
correspondent to visit all the leading In­
dian, reservations in the United States
and study the ohar&cter and oondition of
the Indians. Mr. Harrison has just re­
turned to Boston, after a journey of over
six months' duration, and it is now an­
nounced that in addition to numerous
letters published, in the Herald, he will
shortly publish.his observations in book
form for free distribution to those who
feel interested enough in the matter to
send to him for a copy. In a circular,
Mr. Harrison says: "My exploration of
the great Sioux reservation was muoh
more thorough than had ever before been
accomplished. Throughout my entire
journey I received the greatest courtesy,
kindness and assistance from the oom
manders of forts and military posts and
officers of the army in the Indian ooun­
try, from all Indian agents and employes
of the government on the reservations,
and from civil officers, missionaries,
teaohers journalists, business men and
leading citizens everywhere, and was
highly fortunate in opportunities for ob­
servation and investigation, and in all
the conditions and oourse of circum­
stances affecting my work."
The following Washington dispatch,
dated the 8th, appears in the Chicago
News:
When Gov. Pierce, of Dakota, was in
Washington three weeks ago he tendered
his resignation to the president, but at the
request of the latter, withdrew it The
president wanted him to remain],in office
till the end of his term, which is two years
hence, and Pierce consented to give the
matter more reflection. But he has finally
decided tnat it is better for the president,
as well as for himself, to retire from the
office, and returns his resignation with the
request that it be accepted and his suc­
cessor appointed before the meeting of
the Dakota legislature in January. The
impression is that Louis K. Church, who
was a member of the New York legislature
while Cleveland was governor, and won the
latter's esteem by the ability and energy
he showed, will be appointed the successor
of Gov. Pierce in a few days. Church is
now a judge of the supreme court
of Dakota. As had been stated, M. H. Day,
the Dakota member of the national demo­
cratic committee, is making a vigorous
fight for the place. T£e president is being
buried under a shower of letters and tele­
grams in his behalf, and influential demo­
crats from other sections of the country
are working for him. Even Judge Church
himself has written a letter to the presi­
dent recommending Day, but nevertheless
it is probable that Church will be ap­
pointed. Pierce's letter of resignation is
as follows:
WILLABD'S HOTEL, WASHINGTON. D. C.,
Nov. 16, 1886.—MR. PRESIDENT I hereby
tender my resignation as governor of the
territory of Dakota. Offices of this charac­
ter were made an exception to the rules
governing removals from office laid down
by you at the opening of your administra­
tion, but you have kindly abstained from
interference with me, and have never by
act or word indicated that my continuance
in office was not entirely acceptable. 1
tender my resignation now because the
pressure for the place subjects you
to constant annoyance, and because
I fear my own usefulness is im­
paired by the constant agitation of the
question of change. Throughout my im
cumbeney of the office I have met with
nothing but personal kindness and official
courtesy at your hands and those of your
advisers. The most cordial support has
been afforded me, and my relations in this
respect have been most pleasant and agree­
able. This treatment of one whose politi­
cal affiliations are not those of the dominant
party shows a spirit of tolerance which
lends dignity to your high office and de­
mands this frank acknowledgement from
me. With the assurance, Mr. President, of
my deep odligations for your courtesy, and
with a sincere wish for your personal wel­
fare, I remain with great respect your
obedient servant, GILBERT A. PIERCE.
PROF. BLAKE, who publishes a monthly
called "The Future," down at Richland,
Kansas, has made some pretty accurate
weather predictions during the past year.
He says it is simply impossible for him
to make a mistake that he desires every­
body to watch his predictions closely,
and if he makes a mistake' he will give
up the business. For December he says:
The first part of December will be stormy
and only moderately cold. As the month
advances it will grow warmer and wetter,
with an excess of rain from the Ohio val­
ley to the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. In
the far north the. precipitation the last of
November and the first part of December
will be in the form of snow, but by about
tbe 10th of December it will be warm
enough to melt nearly all the snow to the
British line, and towards the middle of the
month all the precipitation in the United
States, except in tne Rocky mountains,
will be rain instead of snow, diminishing
in quantity from the Ohio valley to the
north and west, where there will not be as
milch as is needed for wells, though in
most of the country there will be more
rain during the first half of December than
during the whole month of November.
IT IS NOW said that President Cleve­
land has an Indian policy of his own, at
least he so informed a Dakota gentleman
who was urging the passage of the
Dawes bill cutting down the great Sioux
reservation. The president's idea of
dealing with the Indian is not calculated
to encourage the friends of the Dawes
bill, and it will hardly pass in its pres­
ent form. The president favors the giv­
ing of land in severalty to the Indians
and restoring the balance of the reserva­
tions to the public domain. This would
do away with the tribal relations and
eventually work out a practical solution
of t^e vexatious Indian question.
THE North Dakota Farmer, published
at Jamestown, is now one year old. It
has beoome deservedly popular. It is
published monthly, and is the best
farm journal for Dakota people. The
Farmer and the Bismarck WEEKLY
TRIBUNE, whioh gives all the looal, terri
torial, and telegraphio news, will be sent
one year to any address for 82.50.
JOHN HOBAET, of the Egan district, is
being quite generally endorsed in South
Dakota for the speakership of the house.
Mr. Hobart was a member of the lower
house in the last legislature, and years
ago represented a large. constituency in
the Minnesota state legislature. He was
also elected a member of the South Da­
kota "state" senate. In the legislature
two years ago he was a.carefulyet deter­
mined man and never went ahead until
he was sure he was right. His opinions
were sound and always respected.
AFTER all' it seems that a great moun­
tain has been made out of a little mole
hill by the press
ot
the territory in the
attorney general controversy. Unfor­
tunate as it may have appeared at first to
all parties concerned, the whole affair ia
now so thoroughly understood that it
seems ridiculous that the press Bhould
have been worked up to suoh a high
degree in the matter. It transpires th^|
Mr. Engle meta prejudiced reporter whb
made him say what he never thought of
saying—regarding the governor and the
president and himself—and then someone,
for a joke, telegraphed from Bismarck
that Secretary McCormack was liable to
bounce Engle for it, when McCormack
didn't know anything about it—oouldn't
bounce him if he wanted to—and then the
reporter pretended to interview Engle
again, and made him say bad things about
McCormack. Now these gentlemen have
struck some truthful reporters at St Paul
and Bismarck—five hundred miles apart
—and both say they never said so—about
each other—each has always had a good
opinion of the other, and there is no
trouble whatever between them. The
TRIBUNE is glad to learn that peace reigns
—always has—except in the minds of
over-zealous newspaper reporter who
want to see a row all the time.
SOME newspapers are pleased to speak
of the "fighting chance" the demoorats
have of carrying North Dakota in case of
division, and a few advocates of division
are using this as an argument to win
democratic affeotion. for the oause in
Washington. The recent vote demon­
strates but little difference between the
two sections—North or South Dakota.
The republican majority in the North is
over ten per cent and in the South six­
teen per cent.
THE Farg-o Republican speaks about
"ohiokens coining home to roost," all in
the same paragraph and referring to the
Argus. Now the TRIBUNE has known
Major Edwards a long time and to be
honest with the Republican, the TRIBUNE
does not believe the Argus cares whether
the old chickens ever come home to roost
or not. Can't get even with the major
that way.
AND now comes the report in the St.
Paul Globe that Marshal Maratta could
not find a house in Sioux Falls to suit
him so he will not take up his residence
there as reported. The TRIBUNE fails to
see what difference it makes, anyhow,
where the Marshal lives. He attends to
his business all right and that is all that
is required of him by the government.
IF EDITOR BOBGEN, of the new demo­
cratic daily inpllandan, will send over a
copy, the TRIBUNE will be pleased to
make such criticism on the venture as
the occasion seems to demand.
AND now it is said that Abe Boynton
is booked for Register Rea's place in the
Bismarok land offioe. Rea has not yet
.resigned, however.
THE Aberdeen News strongly approves
of a modification of tbe exemption laws
by the legislature this winter.
EVERY DAY the Sioux Falls Press
makes the startling announcement that
the sun rises and sets.
THE TRIBUNE'S regular Washington
special furnishes an interesting^batoh of
items for this issue.
"LET the territories come in, beginning
with Dakota," says the Cleveland (Ohio)
Leader.
THE REVIEW TABLE.
The managers of the Overland Month­
ly announce that the leading article in
the December issue will be by Prof. E. W.
Hilgard, and upon one of' the most im­
portant of California's future industries.
The Overland Monthly, 415 Montgomery
street, San Francisco.
"The Toboggan" is the name of anew
book upon winter sports, just published
by Messrs. A. G. Scalding & Bros., New
Tork and Chicago. It is a bright and
entertaining volume, prettily illustrated,
upon the popular Canadian sports of to­
bogganing and snow shoeing, and is well
worth the price asked (25 cents) to all
lovers of outdoor winter pastimes.
W. S. Lilly, one of the foremost philo­
sophical thinkers and writers of England,
has prepared for the December number
of the Forum an article whioh is likely
to command wide attention, on "The
Present Outlook of Christianity." He
holds that the belief of Christendom
stands absolutely intact and unassailable
from the point of view of soienoe.
To the December number of Lippin
oott's Monthly Magazine, Mrs. Frances
Hodgson Burnett contributes the com­
plete novel, Miss Defarge," a study of
life in the household of a dissolute,
spendthrift English lord, whioh affords
ample scope for both pathos and humor.
E. P. Roe, the most popular of American
novelists, contributes a story in his char­
acteristic vein, entitled "A Ghost on
Christmas Eve." Another autobiograph­
ical sketch of unique interest is that in
whioh Charlotte Adams tells "How I
Became an Artist's Modal." Junius
XLuiri Browne, in Newspaperism'
Reviewed," makes a very clever, enter
taining, and good'tempered answer to
Conde Fallen's article on "Newspaper­
ism," in the November number. Frank
G. Carpenter discusses the -"Presidents'
as Gastronomers," and gives a good deal
of curious information gathered from
authentic sources. "ABatohelor's Blun­
der," by W. E. Norris, is concluded in
this number, and in the future the publi­
cation of serial stories will be entirely
discontinued, a complete novel being fur­
nished with every number.
There is a revival in business in Low­
ell, Mass., the leading manufacturing
oity in the United StateB, where two
years ago the mills had jjnany machines
idle, now it is difficult |to get enough
good help. Nor is this boom in business
confined to the manufacturing interests.
The New Moon Magazine, started five
years ago without a subscriber, in­
creased its subscription list to suoh an
extent that the New Moon Publishing
company has just erected another large
four-story brick building to accommo­
date its increasing business.
Charles Scribner's Sons have issued a
prospectus of Scribner's MagasiiiA, giT.
ing a general idea of the *imn and soope
of the new literary venture. The first
number will appear on December 15th,
bearing the date of January, and suc­
ceeding numbers will be published on
the 1st of each month. Scribner's, it is
promised, will be, in the widest sense, a
magazine of general literature, its pur­
pose being to bring together not only
good reading, but literature of perma­
nent value. Each number will be illus­
trated, and the artistic work will be spir­
ited and original.
The Magazine of American history
oloses its sixteenth volume with an ex­
ceptionally bright and readable Decem­
ber number. The vigor and grace with
whioh this periodical moves forward in
its well regulated and prosperous course,
inspiring fresh love of country with every
monthly issue, is a source of special pride
to the American people. The frontis­
piece this month is an admirable portrait
of Major-General Halleck, made ex­
pressly for this magazine from the paint­
ing in possession of General George W.
Cullum it accompanies a paper of sur­
passing interest to all olasses of readers,
entitled, "Misunderstandings Halleck
and Grant," by General James B. Fry.
"The Swamp Aiigel," the name given to
the gun which in 1863 was used in firing
on Charleston, is the title to a notable
paper, by William S. Stryker, adjutant
general of New Jersey, illustrated with

For many years the December issues
of Harper's Magazfhe have been distin­
guished by an unusual wealth of choice
reading and pictures, with a special em­
phasis upon Christmas subjects. Rich
as have been the previous numbers, the
one about to be published stands easily
at the head of all the goodly company
that for nearly forty years have enter­
tained and enlightened innumerable
readers. It is a royal banquet of re­
freshing variety, with sturdy staples, rare
novelties, and delicious dainties worthy
of the generous holiday saint. Every­
thing is oomplete in itself, the serials be­
ing omitted from this number. Beside
the strongest attraction of -'The Boyhood
of Christ," by the author of "Ben-Hur,"
the Howells farce, "The Mouse Trap,"
Gibson's delightful "Wood Notes," and
the bounteous departments of confidential
discourse, of literary judgment and of
overflowing humor, presided over by the
geniuses of G. W. Curtis, W. D. How­
ells and C. D. Warner, we are regaled
with six short stories (four of them beau­
tifully illustrated) and five illustrated
poems. Of the abundant outs, twenty
five occupy full pages, and four are
printed separately on plate paper. Not­
withstanding the unparalled richness of
this number, we are assured by the pub­
lishers that it is only a Christmas form
of the exalted standard that will be uni­
formly maintained throughout the year
and the magnificent prospectus detailing
the coming treasures gives a splendid
promise to the volume begun by Hiia
number.
In the fifth volume of the History of
California Hubert Howe Bancroft relates
as fine a little piece of strategy as was
ever used by an unlucky commander to
extrioate himself from a trap into which
he had fallen unawares. When in June,
1846, the Bear Flag men were in posses
sion of Sonoma the Mexican general,
Castro, sent an expedition against them
from San Pablo, under Torre. Torre
landed at San Quentin, _and proceeded
thence over San Rafael toward Petaluma,
where he was suddenly attacked by
Lieut. Ford, with .the Bears. Torre's
force was defeated, and fled, and the vic­
tors returned to Sonoma. On the next
day, June 25th, Fremont, with 130
started in pursuit of Torre, whb was sup­
posed to have retreated to San Rafael, to
be joined there by other divisions of Cas­
tro's army. No traces of any foe were
found at San Rafael. Torre and hi« men
seemed to have altogether disappeared.
On the 28th, however, an Indian was
captured with a letter from Torre dis­
closing his plan to attack Sonoma on the
following night, and Fremont, having in­
tercepted letters from Castro also relat­
ing to the same project, hurried back to
Sonoma, where he arrived on the 29th
before sunrise. He discovered no en­
emy, and concluding that he had been
led off on a false scent, started back in
haste. But on the same morning Torre,
who had written his letter purposely to
have it fall into Fremont's hands, ar­
rived with his eighty men at Sanoelito,
where he at once embarked on a lighter,
and while his pursuers were sjeeding to
San Rafael, the little band of fugatives
drifted slowly over to San Pablo, forget­
ting, perhaps, the shame of their flight
in the elation over the successfully exe­
cuted ruse of their leader.
