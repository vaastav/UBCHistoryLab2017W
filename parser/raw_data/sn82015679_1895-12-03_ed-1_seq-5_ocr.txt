.WASHINGTON. .J tec. 2. The Iiepubllcan
Senators were in caucus for half an hour
after the Senate aOjourrifd to-day, but ad
Jound until Wednesday without taking
any action Jn the reorganization of the
Senate, Mr. Sherman was elected chairman
of tiio caucus arid Mr." Dubois secretary.
The discussion was Informal an J centered
arocrtt the question whether the Repub
lican Senator, having a plurality but not
a majority of the Senate, should attempt
a reorganization with Republican officers
and Republican chairmen of committees.
It was evident that the prevailing sentl
merl favored Republican organization and
scxjoj strong Fpeeches were, made, notably
by Mr. Davis, of Minnesota, an.t Aldrich,
of Rl:c!e Island, urging that there should
be no combination or compromise with any
element outside the Republican ranks. Thia
appeared to voice the general view of the
Senators and no opposition speeches were
made. The question arose, however, as to
whether the test of strenztn should be
made on securing the committees or on
the choice of a President pro tern. In
order to present this issue Mr. Hoar moved
the appointment of a committee on com
mittees to take charge . of a move
to secure committee reorganization on Re
publican lines. Mr. Hale offered an amend
ment for a test on the choice of President
pro tern. In the Informal discussion fol
lowing: Mr. Frye's name was mentioned
as the probable candidate for President pro
temi Some Senators raised the point, how
ever, that the President pro tern, could
not be elected while the presiding officer
was present and acting under the Senate
rules. It was finally decided that no vote
should be taken at present and Messrs.
Hoar and Hale withdrew their motions.
The understanding rvas that a definite line
of action would be agreed on at the meeting-
Wednesday, followirg the session of
that day. The principal reason for the
. withdrawal of the resolution for the ap
pointment of a caucus committee by the
chair was the discovery of the fact that
there was a large clement In the . caucus
opposed to the selection of the commit
tee by appointment. It is now understood
that when the resolution is renewed it
will be antagonized by a substitute pro
viding for the election of the committee
by the caucus. "
Senator Faulkner, of West Virginia, said
to-day concerning the organization of the
Senate: "We cannot turn the Senate over
to the Republicans until they have the
votes. Even with the two Senators from
Utah they will net have a majority unless
Jones, of Nevada, votes with them, which
is expected. Until that time we will have
to continue In control."
The silver conference called for to-day
was a disappointment to Its projectors.
The only Senators who attended wee
Allen. Kyle. Peffer and Stewart; Tillman.
Democrat, and Pritchard.: Mantle and
Teller, Republicans. The last-named gen
tlemen were only there a few momenta
and took no part in the proceedings. The
small attendance showed those present
that nothing could be done at this meeting.
Senator Peffer was of the opinion that
party ties were too strong to hope to or
ganize a sliver party in the Senate, while
Senator Allen said he hoped something
might come from this preliminary meet

' PRIVATE SECRETARIES.
Indlnnlftn Who Attend to Ihc Affnlr
of Iloosler CongreiMuen.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. Following is a
lfst of gentlemen who have been appointed
private secretaries to the members of the
Indiana delegation in the order of the
districts so far as appointed: Mr. Hemen
way has temporarily appointed Mr. F. E.
Holloway, of Evansville. but will appoint
another secretary after the Christmas holi
days. Mr. Hardy has appointed his son.
Mr. Tracewell has named Mr. Edgar J.
Wright, of Corydon. Mr. Watson has a
young law student from his Rushville office
named George McOuire. Mr. Overstreet
has not yet appointed a secretary. Mr.
Johnson has named Mr. Thomas Morton.
Mr. Henry some time ago selected Mr.
Charles Lane, a well-known newspaper man
of Indianapolis. Mr. Faris has not yet
made an appointment. Mr. Hanley has ap
pointed Mr. Henry Braden, of Williams
port. Mr. Hatch has secured Mr. Henry
Strohm. a Kentland editor. Mr. Eeighty
has not yet made an appointment. Mr.
Rovse-has appointed hi wife his private
secretary, a practice first Introduced by
Jerry Simpson In the last House. Mr.
Steele bad not made an appointment, pend
ing the announcement of the committees.
Representative Hanley Is very anxious to
secure the appointment of a reading clerk
ship for Mr. Robert Hatcher, but as the
salary of the office Is $3,600 there is some
doubt If, In drawing lots for the patronago
which will be apportioned to the delega
tions, so great a prize will fall to his share.
It ha been suggested to Mr. Hanley that
he would A-astly increase Mr. Hatcher's1
chances if he could find two other members
of the delegation who will agree to waive
all further claims to House patronage if
Mr. Hatcher is appointed, practically ac
cepting the one $3,600 appointment as the
patronage due three districts of the State.
Mr. Hanley has not yet found the two
other members who will enter this combina
tion with him.
API'BAI FOR MILLERS.
Wnnt Legislation That Will llrondcn

WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. The .members of
the Pennsylvania delegation In Congress
have receive! a circular from the Penn
sylvania Millers' State Association, the out
come of a resolution adopted at the annual
meeting of the association held in Phila
delphia last September, to make an appeal
for legislation that will broaden markets
for American flour. The letter says the
flour mills of this country have ample ca
pacity to gTind Into flour even bushel of
wheat produced here, and that the sta
tistics of our exports for the last fiscal
year show that the equivalent of nearly
twenty million barrels of flour went out
of this country In the sha; of whole
grain, to be ground In foreign mills, and
rncst of the products sold in competitive
markets- against American flour. It la
pointed out that th milling industrv of this
country is the greatest in the United States
in point of capital Invested and value of
proluc;. The letter continues:

Argument of Ariuen' Counsel.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. Counsel for
Major George Armes, whose sensational ar
rest several months ago for insubordination
by order of Major General Schoflold. then
acting Secretary, of War, was followed by
hta rlidliarffA hi- Turtctt 'RmrlleV. With 3
scathing denunciation of the arrest, filtd
their brief to-day in reply to the govern
ment appeal to the Court of Appeals. They
ask the discharge of Armes from further
liability, first, because no power whatever
existed to make the arrest.- and. second,
because he was not Informed of the nature
of the accusation against him. Counsel say
there has been no process of law In eny
sense, and no legal commitment, and be
lieving, therefore, that the arrest was un
just, a violation of the law and Fubvsrslve
of . the liberty of the citizen, request that
the judgment of the lower court be af
firmed. Military law. counsel argue, is su
preme In military affairs, but It must pro
vide for due process, not arbitrary Impris
onment. The case was argued in the Ap
pellate Court to-day. Counsel for iorh sides
reviewed their contentions. Some time
probobly will elapse before the c.tze is de
cided. Foot nntl fHouth Disease In Ilrnzll.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. The consul-general
of the United States In Brazil has re
ported to the State Department that foot
ani mouth disease Is quite prevalent In the
State of Sao Paulo. A recent communica
tion to the Biological Society of France
reports the existence of the disease In the
State of Mlnas Geraes. The wide range cov
ered and the difficulty of applying any ef
fective means of extirpating it among the
cattle ranches of southern Brazil, render
the likelihood of its spread through Uruguay
and Paraguay to the Argentine Republic ex
tremely probable. Recent experimental
shipments from Australia made a stop at
Montevideo, a1 course which might, in .the
future, cause the condemnation of their car
goes on arrival in British ports, but the
greatest Importance of the information lies
In its probable effect upon the shipment
of live cattle-from Argentina, which has
so recently developed into a pronounced
competitor in this line of trade with the
United States.
ConsrcM May Retaliate1.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 2. It Is apprehended
here that the withdrawal by tie Canadian
authorities of the ii?ht exercised ny Amer
ican fishermen for seven years past, of buy
ing bait and supplies in Canadian wait is,
may lead to reprisals -at the hands of Con
gress, for it has been contended all along
that the privilege enjoyed by Canadian iail-roads-of
carrrying roods In bond thtcugh
the United States va? more tr.an a suffi
cient offset to the favors extenlod io Amer
ican fishermen by Canada. Tie action of
the Canadian government just taken has
not yet been officially repot tod to the State
Department, but it is regarded here as an
indication of Canada's purpose to emphasize
the necessity Tor tne reno.val oC ti.-c na
tions looking to a new fisheries treaty.
Supreme Court Decision. -
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.-In the case of
Stephen M. Folsom who, as president of the
National Bank of New Mexico, had been

opinion of the Supreme Court to-day, holding
that the federal courts did not possess the
right to review the judgement of the ter
ritorial courts in such case.

CONGRESS IS READY.
(Concluded from First l'aer.)
is seldom disturbed even at the opening of
Congressman! to-day,' with crowded galle
ries and a general air of expectancy, there
was the same -evenanl unruffled proced
ure which characterized the Senate. All
of the galleries, public and private, ex
cept that reserved, for the diplomatic corps,
were filled to overflowing by 11 o'clock, and
the outer corridors were crowded with those
unable to gain admission. The Senators
began to gather early in the day, exchang
ing greetings and renewing acquaintances.
Mr. Jones, of Arkanras, and Mr. Teller, of
Colorado, were among the . first arrrlvals.
They were soon joined by the venerable
Senator Hoar and his Massachusetts col
league, Mr. Lodge. Mr.i Peffer and Mr.
Allen showed special attention to the ac
quisitions to tho Populist Senatorial ranks.
There was a special interest In the many
new races. -Mr. - Martin, or Virginia, was
introduced to his associates by Mr. Daniel.
Mr. Sherman crossed - the chamber and
greeted his Ohio associate, Mr. Brice, who
was in a group with Messrs. Gorman,
Cockrell and Harris.
The floral offerings were unusually
abundant, many of the desks being liter
ally buried beneath their weight of roses
and chrysanthemums. The desk of Mr.
Shoup, of Idaho, hell fruit as well as flow
ers. The two New Jersey Senators, Mr.
Smith on the right and Mr. Sewell on the
left, were entrenched behind normous
banks of American Beauty roses, rising six
reet from the floor. Other Senators remem
bered with baskets- and bunches of flowers
were Allison. EakerCnllom, Faulkner, Gal
llnger. Ha nsbrough. .Harris. Jones of Ar
kansas, Lodge, MeELride. Mantle, Martin,
Mitchell of Oregon, Proctor, Quay and
Roach.
Exactly at 12 o'clock the Vice President
ascended to the presiding officer's chair,
and, rapping once, called the Senate to or
der. With impressive tones the blind chap
lain In the Senate invoked divine blessing
on the chamber; referring eloquently to the
affliction in the- fanifly -of 'ex-Senator Wil
son, of Iowa, and to the absence of Isaac
Basett, the veteran doorkeeber, who
is now dangerously ill. The first
business transacted was the swear
ing in of new Senators and of those
re-elected. They proceeded to the clerk's
desk In groups of three and four, accom
panied by their State colleagues, and, with
uplifted right hands, took the oath as it
was read by the Vico prudent.
The usual formal resolutions were quickly
adoptel. That of Mr. Cockrell provided for
the Senate sessions beginning at 12 o'clock,
noon, daily; that or "Mr. Sherman notified
the House that a quorum of the Senate
was present and ready to proceed with bus
iness; that of Mr., -Vilas provided for a
committee of two Senators and two Repre
sentatives to wait on the President and
notify him that Congress waited any com
munication the executive branch desired to
present. The presiding officer designated
Messrs. Vilas and Allison for the committee
to wait on the President. At 12:30 a re
cess of an hour was taken. At 1:30. when
the Senate reconvened. Mr. Pruden, of the
White House staff, was In tho chamber
with word that the, President's message
would not berBubmitted to-dav, and at 130

leasi. Exactly 163 new faces, appeared In a
total of 3G5 members. Some of the oldest
and most tried leaders among the Demo
crats were swept oqt by the tide which
rolled up a Republican, majority of 140 in
the Fifty-fourth House1. ' Of ninety-four. dts
tricts north of Mason's and Dixon's line,
which were represented, by Democrats In
the last Congress, but- thirteen returned
Democrats to the new House. The Demo
cratic victory of, 1S90, which turned a Re
publican majority rrrthe; Fifty-first Con
gress into a Democratic 'majority of 150
was not so complete s the Republican tri
umph wh.'ch last year changed a Demo
cratic majority of ninety-five into a Re
publican majority of 140.. In' the new House
the Republicans control thirty-one of. the
forty-four State delegations, which Insures
them the next presidency should the elec
tion be thrown into" the House, They have
twenty solid delegations, .while the Demo
crats have but four., in the once "solid
South" tho Kentucky, and Tennessee dele
gatlons are almost! -evenly divided. In
North Carolina and Missouri, the Repub
licans control. The West Virginia delega
tion is solidly Republican. Texas and Vir
ginia each has a Republican and South
Carolina and Alabama send Populists. The
number of Populists in- the House is re
duced from twelve to' six;
Among those whose ' long service and
striking personalities make their absence in
the newly assembled House most noticeable
are such grizzled veterans as Judge Hol
man, of Indiana, the "father of the House,"
and "watch dog cf the treasury," who
began his congressional service in 1S39; Gen.
Dan Sickels. of New York, the "hero of
Gettysburg," who achieved distinction as u
soldier, diplomate and statesman; "Silver
Dick" Bland, of Missouri, and William M.
Springer, of Illinois, hoth of whom served
twenty-two years In J.he House, and General
Hooker, cf Mississippi, and General Hatch,
of Missouri, who were both Confederate
veterans, who first came into congressional
life In 1S75. Others thf-re were whose term
of service was shorter; but whose talents
and ability made them exceptionally prom
inent. like William Jj. Wilson, who framert
the tariff bill In the last Congre??, or W.
Bourke Cockran. of 'New York, whose ora
tory often kindled the House. Then there
were such men as William J. Bryan, Tom
Johnson. John Dewitt Warner, of New
York, and Champ Clark, of Missouri:
Thomas Dun English, of New Jersey, who
wrote the song "Don't You Remember Sweet
Alice, Ben Bolt?" around which lu Maur
ier's story hovers so persistently; "Buck"
Kllgorc, of Texas. -who is now a federal
judge; Daniel Eockwood. of Buffalo, Presl
diu Cleveland's old law partner; Michael
liarter. of Ohio; Sibley, of Pennsylvania,
whose ardent advocacy of the cause of free
silver has given him prominence as a possible-
silver iindidate for . the presidency;
General Tracj-, of Albany, a close friend
of the administration on the floor of the
Houe; Joseph Outhwaite, of Ohio, now a
member of the government ordnance board;
Eenjamin A. Enloe. of Tennessee: Gearv,
of California, the author of the latest Chi
nese exclusion act; McGann, of Chicago;
Lafe. Pence, of Colorado; Dr. Everett, ot
Massachusetts; Asher Caruth. of Ken
tucky, one of the wits of the House, and
W. C. P. . Brcckenridgc. of the same Stat,
and Jerry Simpson, the leading Populist o
the House. Tnese and many others ate
gene, but there aru new men of as striking
ability, as interesting history or peculiari
ties to take their places. Among them are
Gen. James A. Walker, the Republican from
Virginia, a Confedrate soldier of renown,
who assumed command of-rkonewall Jack
son's brigade after the latter was shot at
Chancellorsville.
. The presence of new blood is quite as no
ticeable In the usually slow-changing Sen
ate as in the House. Among . th most
notable of the absentees are Butler of South
Carolina. Ransom of North Carolina, Coke
of Ttxas, Dolph of Oregop, Mahderon of
Nebraska and McPherson of New Jersey,
each of whom had served more than one
term. Of the thirty Senators whose terms
expired on the 4th of March last only thir
teen were re-elected. The new men are
Augustus O. Bacon, of Gorgia, who succeeds
Patrick Walsh; Iiclen Baker, of Kansas.

Messrs. Tillman, Walthall and Warren.
Mr. Carter has. become nationally known as
chairman of the Republican committee.
Mr. Thurston has never been prominent
as an office holder, but he has been a con
spicuous figure in national Republican con
ventions and will not beln his legislative
career as ti novice. Senator Elkins was a
member of President Harrison's Cabinet,
and his addition will swell the list of ex
Cabinet officers in the Senate to seven.
Messrs. Ilurrows, Clark. Mantle. Pritchard

close of the last session. Tnese five added

MANASSAS, Va.. Dec. 2. Pursuant to a
decree of the Circuit Court of Prince Wil
liam county, over 550 acres of the York
shire tract belonging to the McLean es
tate and lying on both sides of Bull run
and adjoining Blackburn's ford, were sold
at public auction to-day. The greater por
tion was sold at an average, of something
less than $6 per acre, while some went at
$4 and J2.50 per acre. This land embraced
a large portion of the historic Bull Run
battlefield. One of the purchasers is the
son of Major Wilmer McLean, who re
sided upon the property at the beginning
of the war, and in whose house at Appo
mattox the terms of surrender between Lee
and Grant were drawn and thus it was
said by Major McLean that the war began
and ended on him.
