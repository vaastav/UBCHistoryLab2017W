Waslilncton Notes.
A'a-hloto.v, I). C, Dee. 10. Tlin sub
cominittce of tho house committee on ap
propriations, having in clitrfje the tubject
of pension appropriations, have agreed upon
a bill appropriating $00,000,000 of the
amount iifKcil by iho ctiiriini-tioner of pen
iiou fur the noxt fiscal year. Tho bill will
be submitted to th" house to-morrow. It is
short and contains 110 new legislation.
The Swaini court martial to-day resumed
the cross-examination of IUlemun. The
witnetf said that he soncd in the navy from
ISflG to 1871, nnd in the revenue liinrine er
vice from 1871 to 18S0; was mate in the
r.avj ; resigned from the revenue marine
ten ice; was not dismissed.
Oueilio:i. Vrc you not charged in the
trcasuty department with presenting fraudu
lent claims for traveling expenses between
New York and AVashington, and dropped
from the roll- by feci clary Vforrill for that?
Answer. 1 was suspended from service
for a while, but there was no fal-o nccotiiiL
lie stated the basi- for tho charge was the
fart that hu had charged in his account a
ticket between New York and Washington
ued two days before the formal order for his
journey had been made by the tieaiurer.
Witness believed that in.tnv otlier otlieers in
tho erice had been placed in a similar pos
ition and had been reinstated in tho sen ice.
Thir closed the cxaiiiiiialion. Kateman and
two oilier witnesses wcro examined without
anv important ntiU, and the court 111:11 tial
adjourned.
The senate confirmed JSurton Ilal.cr, of
Michigan, Indian agent at Kort I'eck, lon
tatin. General lorehcad, of the Xcw (Jrleaiis
exposition and Senators Jimarnnd Hamp
ton called upon the pioidcnt to-day and re
ijitesled him in iow ofliis inability to be
present at tho ooening of tlie exposition to
consent to open the espoition by electrici
ty. Tho plan i to clear one of the "Western
Cniun wires and attach one end to the mo
Uo power maeliinerv in tho exposition
building and the other end to be connected
with tho white hou-e, and at a lived moment
everything will be in leadlncv- at New Or
leans. The president surrounded by his
cabinet, members of o digress, judges, and
smcnimi'iit ollicial and foreign reprcenUi
tives will pre tho button in the executive
malison and simultaniously et tho vast
machinery of tho exposition in motion. The
president agreed to take this proposition un
der consideration. The members of tho
house have been formally invited to attend
theopening of tho oxpo-ition in a bodv.
Tho confirmation of ilcCulloch to be
secretary was taken up in executive session
and Senator lliddlebergcr inade a continued
speech at sumo length opposing the confirm
ation. He again culled tor the reading of
tome of iIcCul!ocy' annual report-, where
upon the senulo adjourned, first, hoivci er,
postponing tiny further consideration ol
Secretary .McCulloch'snomin ition until next
Tuesday
The national association of health board'
met hero to-day in accordance, with a call
which set forth" the danger to tlu3 country
from cholera nnd the importance of adopt
ing the nco-vsrv precuitions. J'rasius
llrooks, of New Vork, called the convention
ty order and delivered an addrc- in which
he summarized the fact known about chol
era, il character and method-, its p.-opiga-lion
and spread. Delegates were ptccnt
from ('auada and tho following s.ates:
Louisiana, Indiana, Illinois, Georgia, Con
necticut, Kentucky, .Michigan, Act Vii
ginia, Wisconsin, Texas tissouri, I'cnnsyl
vania, Ohio, 2'orth Carolina, Notili York.
New .lersoy, New llampshiie. Maryland,
.MaBsiiclmsctts, i?outh Carolina, Tciinpiee
and Jlinnesola. Standing committees were
appointed. A liumber of papers were re
ported and rcfernd to the appropriate com
mittees. Tho Nicaraugian eanaltreaty nnd Spanish
reciprocity treaties were sent bv the pie-t-dcut
to the senate to-day. Treaties with
Hawaii and San Domingo have been signed,
and terms withGautnniala and S.in S.-ihador
have substauii.illy been agixi'd upon, and
good progress has" been made upon that of
the Tinted States and Columbia. 'J'he niii
tication of these treaties will probably lead
to thu negotiation of treaties with other
American powers ami colonic. Indeed, a
movement is already noted in the Hnlish
West Indies to secure a reciprocity ttsitv
with tho Tinted Slate. With the inception
of the Nicaraugian treaty, which relates to
the iutcr-occanic cinal, all are commercial
treaties, and though differing considerably in
detail they are all modeled upon the reci
procity treaty with Mexico. Tho injunction
of secrecv has formally been removed from
the Sp.nfsh treatv, the text having already
1 bi-eu published, and it U not unlikely the
pre 'ixieni win oe lonoweii 111 ivpeci im mo

At a meeting of the house committee on
coinage, weights ana measures io-aay, Jir.
I Jiuekner gave his reasons for introducing a
j bill to stop the coinage of silver.
Uhairman jiiana was auseni, ueing ueuun
tA t lmino in "Missouri br the. dangerous
illness of his daughter. " I
3Ir. Buckner said: "The introduction of
the bill was not a matter of sudden impulse.
I talked with friends during the first session
of congress about tho propriety of intro
ducing iL They said something ought to be
done. The present administration, if not
hostile, is careless about the silver. There
seems to be no hope of its doing anything.
The new administration may take si more
earnest interest. It is evident the time has
come when this government ought to act
decisively, a'ld tho question to decide is,
whether wc are to "have bi-metalism or
inono-metalism. Foreign countries
have taken up tho question.
Holland has a large portion of the silver,
and it has gone into the market for gold.
Italy requires her banks to keep two-thirds
they receive in gold. We are interested in
silver as a product. "We are still more in-tere-ted
in having bi-mclalisui, whichvvas
established by our forefathers. This bill is
in the interest of bi-metalism. I believe
that four-fifths of the pcoplo of tho United
States want bi-metalism, and the only differ
ence between us is as to the means to bring
it about. There are only a few
who nre mono-metahsts. Hy tho
time this bill might pass wo will have
$200,000,000 in silver under the terms of the
Bland bill, coining 2,000,000 n month. One
object of the Bland bill was to keep up the
market value of silver. In Kngland a strong
party of able men said bi-niLtalism must be
established among all commercial nations or
bad results will follow. "We ought to regard
the opinions of men with us on this ques
tion. You have the economic phenomenon
of the fall and decline of all commodities,
without exception. Some say this is created
by over pi olfaction in our protective
country, but it exists in free trade countries
also. 1'rices aro declining because of tho
new demand for gold and the diminished
production and the increased use of this
metal and manufactures, and I have but
little doubt that this reliance on gold as a
measure of values i 0110 of I110 potent
causes of the decline in the vaiuc of Amci
can commodities, and will continue to bo
so long as gold is the sole standard of valuo
of the great commercial counties of the
world "We will have to go to mono-nietaj-Isiii
in silver or gold, unless something is
done to bring Kurope to realize the danger
of reiving on that metal. If KngUind does
nothing we mav have to relyon free-coinage
and have silver mono-mctalism. Men in
terested in the silver mines demand that wc
have free coinage. It is between that and
the coinage of gold alone. I believe it is
bitter to jiave tree coinage.
"What will be the effect of the passage of
your bill? asked n member of the com
mittee. It's immediate effect will cause some de
cline in the relative price of Eilvcr. This
will bo only temporary. If we can succeed
in urging the nations of Kurope to join
with us in Using both metals in Imde, and in
Kngland, with its silver using colonies, it
may produce sucli an embarassment as will
induce her to increase her coinage ol silver,
and other Kuropean nations will follow her
example.
Kepri'scntalive l'otter was also present,
and coincided with tho ideas advanced by
.Mr. Buckner. Mr. l'otter said ho was strong
ly in favor of bi-metalism.
The committeo will meet Monday to con
sider the bill.
Forty-Eighth Conftross.
SKNATK.
The chair laid before the senate an invita
tion to that body from the commissioner of
the New Orleans exposition to participate in
the opening of the exposition on tho ICth
iu-t. The communication was laid on the
table, that being the usual formal disposition
of such documents.
Mr. Vest on behalf of the committee on
commerce requested that the committee bo
discharged from a consideration of tho inter-oceanic
ship railway bill. Mr. Vest
stated that hu had received a letter from
Captain Kails saying that certain changes
had been made in the concession from Mex
ico, which made it necessary to withdraw the
bill. The committeo was accordingly dis
charged from a consideration of the bill,
which was ordered to be withdrawn from tho
files in the senate.
Tile senate passed a bill nutlmrizinc the
Commercial National bank, of Chicago, to
merea-e its capital stock to $2,000,000.
.Mr. McMillan introduced a bill increasing
tho appropriation for the erection of a public
building at Minneapolis to SoOO.000.
The senate then took up tho Oregon Cen
tral land forfeiture bill.
Mr. Ve-t. addressed the senate, in opposi
tion to the admission of Dakota. There was
nothing partisan, he said, in 111 opposi
tion. He did not pretend to be free Irom
partisanship. He was devoted to tho princi
ples of tho Democratic party, but lie was
liere to discuss the question entirely on its
merits. Very few territories, however, had
been admitted to the union without party
struggle and debate. Territories thcmsolvc.
had alvvavs felt tho influence of the party
domiiiatit'iu the nation. When national ad
ministration was Democratic tho territories
were Democratic. "When ltepublican, terri
tories were ltepublican. Addressing himself
to the merits of the question, Mr. Vest said
the constitution had placed no limitation on
tlio power of congress to admit new states.
The action of congress as to tho admission of
states in the pa-t was no criterion for the
pro-cut. The men who framed our
constitution had never dreamed of any
period short of centurio would sec the
A111ericr.11 wilderness penetrated by civ
ilization. There was no need to-day
for tho admission of new states in order to
strengthen tho union and thero was no need
to rush this territory into tho condition of a
state. The population was not enough to
entitle it to a representative in congressand
it would to n certain extent bo disfranchizing
the states already in tho union to givo tho
prc-ent population of Dakota two repre
sentatives in the I'nited States senate as well
as representatives in the lower houe of con
gress. The demand i said to have been
made since 1S70 for admission of the terri
tory. They had been the demands of ambi
tious politicians. Men who were ready to
cut each other's throats politically and
physically had been urging these demands.
Gen. Grant had been credited, Mr. Vest
said, with the statement while president, that
Dakota gave him more trouble than all the
other territories put together; that tho
trouble there was that thero were two streets
in Yankton, and when one street did any
thing or got tin thing done the other
street rebelled, and it would requira
almost all the civil and military
power of the United Suites to keep the peace
lietwi-en the faclion-. Mr. Vc-t sent to tho
de-k and the secretary read a number of pe-
titions
itions opposing the admission of the terri
orv. nnd nscribinfr tho desire for the admis-
tory.

Blalne-Conkling Trouble.
New Yokk, Dec, 10. A "Washington.
special relates an interview with Mr. Blaine,
by a gentleman who holds a high position at
the capital, a staunch ltepublican and a
warm admirer of the defeated candidate.
Mr. Blaine confessed frankly, that his defeat
was Mr. Conkling's victory, and gave the
following narrative: "The coolness" Mr.
Blaine said, "between Conkling and myself,
is of longstanding, dating back to the timo
we both were in tho houseof representatives.
He has opposed iny political advancement
ever since that time. Of course 1 retaliated
but more in a defensive way than oth
wise, until Mr. Conkling assumed an
antagonistic attitude toward tho late
President Garfield, when I took the offensive
and opposed 3Ir. Conkling's return to the
senate after he had resigned his scat therein.
It is a mistake to say that Mr. Garfield op
posed Mr. Conkling's return. He was en
tirely careless concerning the matter. Ho
said he cared nothing for annoyance that
gentleman might attempt against the admin
istration. The fact is that Mr. Garfield in
tended that his administration should be
such as to merit tho approval of tho coun
try, and he did not believe that Conkling or
any other ono man could successfully op
pose il; but 1 could not bring myself to look
upon it in that light, and 1 brought
to bear what opposition I
could to Mr. Conkling's; return to
tho senate. As he had opposed my political
advancement I had a perfect right to retal
iate in kind. lie was defeated, .and thus
matters stood until the approach of the na
tional convention, when I was put in the
field for tho nomination by my friends. I
had doubts as to the propriety of my taking
the position with so powerful an opponent
at large, but I was assured that Mr. Conk
ling had turned his back on politic, and
that he would take no part in tho canvass for
cither the nomination or tho election. In
addition to this I was visited by committees
and wiittcn to from all sections of the
country urging me to consent to the tuo of
mv name before the convention. I finally
yielded and still the assurances came. Mean
while I liau laKcn ino pains to icani me icei
ings of Mr. Conkling.
"At first," continued Mr. Blaine, "he was
quite reticent, simply saying that ho wai at
present devoted to his profession and was
out of politics. Later on he expressed utter
indifference as to the nomination, with the
exception of saying that he hoped the con
vention would nominate a man.
This was interpreted as meaning that he
would rather see me nominated than Presi
dent Arthur. I confess that my native van
ity was touched by this explanation and I
felt some relief. The convention met and 1
was nominated. The campaign opened.
The October result in Ohio elated us all.
Still I had misgivings concerning New York.
I went to Ohio and the west it i- true, but
those who thought or still think I under-estimated
the importance of New York are
much mistaken. I was extremely de
sirous of visiting New York state
and so informed the national com
mittee. Just then the iiniinouticcinent
was made that Mr. Conkling would speak
I was in Indiana when this announcement
was made and you will recollect it was said
I was broken down, was sick, or was becom
ing unmanageable. Thc-e reports were not
exactly true! but I will confess that the re
port concerning Mr. Conkling broke me up
considerably. The fir-t report concerning
him did not state on which side he would
speak, but I felt assured it would not be in
behalf of mv election. 1 was bound east
ward, but I halted to learn definitely what
were Mr. Conkling's intention?. I was in
formed that ho was willing to enter into a
compact with me, tho Mib.-taneo of which
was that I should stay out of New York
state. If 1 would agree to that he said he
would make no speeches, but if 1 went on
tho stump in that state he would follow
me and do all he could to defeat
me. Ho said there was vet
an unsettled nuestion between himself
and me as to who was held in the highest
osteem bv the Ucpublican party of tho state
of New Vork. He was willing, he said, lo
submit the question io the people now with
out argument, but if I wanted to argue it he
would willingly meet me. I was willing to
argue the question, but agteed to abide tho
decision of mv friends. After consulL-ition,
it was decided to do nothing which would
brine a new issue into tho campaign, and
one which could not be dignified into any
thing of greater magnitude than a personal
family quarrel. This contented Mr. Conk
ling and ho remained out of politics govern
ed" by the necessity which compelled
him "to devote himself to hi pro
fession. The question went to the ltepub
licans of New Vork state, as .Ml. Conkling
wanted it to go, and he won the victory, and
now I must frankly say." said Mr. lilaine,
with animation, "Mr. t'onkling has had his
revenge. I don't sav 1 kept him out of the
senate, but I certainly did nil I could do to
prevent his return and he has prevented my
election to the presidency. I am gV.d I did
not go into New York. "With .Mr. Conkling
following me and with such n fire in the rear
as ho was capable of delivering, the result I
think could not have been otherwise tnan it
has and wo have both been spared the cor
templation of what wo would have -aid.
I am content my election was not to
be. L'ndcr the circumstances I came very
near carrying cw iorK stale, nut i might
ut as well have lot by 100,000. I feel sat-
lsueu umi an tis uoiii- ma. twiuu uv uun.-,
onlv-Mr. Conklin- could have iven lbe
slstn tn mn and he would noL 1'erhar.s 1
could have secured his return to the senate,
Imt I wnul.l not? but hu 1ms beaten me three
time to mv once beatimr him. Honrevented
, . .-
my nomination in 1S70 and lSfO, and defeat-
cd my election in 1S8J."
Mr. Blaine evinced no particle of feeling
during the entire relation. His demeanor
was even more tnan usually iranw. ana inauer
of fact.

Sherman-Davis Matter.
St. Louis, Mo., Dec 10. Gen. Sherman
this evening in answer to a question by a I
press reporter as to whether he intended I
to reply to tne iei:er o: .iciierson .lmvis ,
recent!? published in this city, said he
might do so at some future time, but he
should consult his own convenience. Mr. j
Davis had not addressed him but the St.
Louis ltepublican, tfod that if he made any
reply it could only be through tho war de- j
partment. He further said he did not sup- .
pose any reporter was ai tuo r ranK uiair i
post the night ho spoke, as the grand army j
is an onrauiai;un uniy jur svtiai unci-
chance or nersor.al memories, still he ad
mitted that the renorts n iblishcd contained
much truth but not a!!. Is ha most of his
Louisiana pnjiers, hcaiel, to make good his
assertion:; that the civil war was forced on
the peopled Loutshna bv conspirators in
Washington, and that during the progress
of the rebellion Mr. Davis changed his
views of doctrine of secession
and tin-eaten- i
cd to use force in case any stato of confeder
acy should attempt what" was then known
as'separato state action." The general has
already sent, to Washington some letters and
papers bearing on tbe case, but as to publi
cation, ho stated that the authoritick thero
must be consulted.
Chicago Chips.
Chicago, Dee. 10. The opportunity to

25 per month.
Tho conference prison officials from all
parts of the United States which began yes
terday resumed to-day, and took up for dis
cussion the organizations of prisons and re
formatories. President Cusidy, of Phila
delphia, held that no official' should be em
ployed who were ever 35 vcars of r-ge.
Mechanics seldom found their way into
prisons and hence they made the best pic on
ollicial. Mr. lUocsvay, of J-'lmim. N. V.,
found that 40 percent of tho prisoners have
behaved well, 10 per cent wce incorrigible
and jf) per cent needed manipulation. Por

Special Dispatch to the Dally Eagle.
A shooting affray took place at this Post
(Ft. Keno) on Satunlay evening, the 6th,
which resulted" in tho hilling of Alcr. "Wat
kins, n wood chopper, by Peter Kane, a bar
tender for the post traders. "Watktu.s was
intoxicated, and after Kane closed the baron
Saturday evening he f Watkins) attempted
to shoot Kane, because ho refused to sell
him more beer. "Watkins btiroted in the
door and made threats that his purpose was i
to kill Kane, whereupon Kane shot him as
he entered the room. He fell to the ground,
saying "Kane you have shot me." The ball
entered the left lung and he lingered till o
o'clock this (Monday) morning, when life
became extinct. AVatkins is a' well known
character in the west and it is gencally con
ceiled that he was a desperate one. Kane
save himself up and is now in the guard
house. Tho opinion of all is that the killing
of Watkins was justifiable and that Kano did
it out of scif-defencc.
On Sunday morning John Lannahan was
found dond in his bed, supposed to have died
of heart disease, Lannahan was the quar
termasters' corral boss, having been in the
employ of the povernment at this post for a
number of years. He was fti years of age
and served as forage master in the Mexican
war. lie is also said to have been an inti
mate friend of Gen. Hancock, having served
under him.
The report in Saturdnv'sKvoi-E in regard
to the settlers coming into Oklahoma is

KOBERTS VS. THE CITY.
The above case was on deck before Justice
Hobbs yesterday. The witnesses had all
been examined and tbe field was cleared
for tho play of the legal artillery. When
the reporter visited the scene of hostilities
Brigadier General O. II. Bently was en
trenched behind a huge breastwork of law
books pouring volley after volley of red
hot legal shot into the court, who stood
it bravely, while "W. K. Stanley and J. M.
Halderston sat well back in their camp
chairs with their hands joined over their
heads watching the effect of the bombard
mint on Port Hobbs. The reporter stood
by for a while watching the precision with
which the volleys were given, and then
made n successful retreat. loiter on ho
mst one of thu participants who informed
him that they would probably continue the
storming until tho storm is over, when
they can move on some other position. It
is :t pity to see so quiet a man as Justice
Hobbs setting himself up at short range, as
a target for such heavy guns, at fifty cents
a day.

of entertainments. Masquerade ball-, char
