WATERTOWN. WIS.
PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE
Washington, D. C., Dec. 3. —Following
is President’s Cleveland’s message which
was read to both houses of Congress to
day:
To the Congress of the United States:
The assemblage within the nation’s legislative
halls of those charged with the duty of making
laws for the benefit of a generous and free peo
ple, impressively suggests the exacting obliga
tion aud inexorable responsibility involved in
their task. At the threshold of such labor now
to be undertaken by the congress of the United
States and in the discharge of an executive duty
enjoined by the constitution. I submit this com
munication containing a Irief statement of the
condition of our national affairs aud recommend
ing such legislation as seems to me necessary
and expedient.
Otir Forcigm Relation*.
The history of our recent dealings with other
nations and onr peaceful relations with them at
this time, additionally demonstrate the advantage
of consistently adhering to a firm but just for
eign policy, fi-ee from envious or ambitious na
tional schemes and characterized by entire hoa
esty and sincerity.
During the past year, pursuant to a law of con
gress. commissioners were appointed to the Ant
werp industrial exposition. Though the partici
pation of American exhibitors fell far shot* of
completely illustrating our national ingenuity
and industrial achievements, yet it was qu te
creditable in view of the brief time allowed tor
preparation.
I have endeavored to impress upon the Bel
gian government the needlessness and positive
harrafulness of its restrictions upon the importa
tion of certain of our food products, and have
strongly urged that the rigid supervision and
Inspection under our laws are amply sufficient
to prevent the exportation from this country of
diseased cattle and unwholesome meat.
The termination of the civil war In Brazil
has been followed by the general prevalence
of peace and order. It appearing at an early
etage of the insurrection that its course would
call for unusual watchfulness on the part of
this government, our naval force in the harbor
of Rio de Janeiro was strengthened. This pre
caution, I am satisfied, tended to restrict the
Issue to a simple trial of strength between the
Brazilian government and the insurgents and to
avert complications which at times seemed
Imminent. Our firm attitude of neutrality was
maintained to the end. The insurgents received
no encouragement of eventual asylum from our
commanders and such opposition as they en
countered was for the protection of our com
merce and was fully justified by public law.
A serious tension of relations having arisen
at the close of the war between Brazil and
Portugal, by reason of the escape of the in
targent admiral. Da Gama, and his followers
the friendly offices of our representatives to
those countries were exerted for the protection
of f he subjects of either within the territory
of the other.
Although the government of Brazil was duly
notified that the commercial arrangement ex
isting between the United States and that coun
try based on the third section of the tariff act
of 1890, was abrogated on Aug. 28, 1894, by
the taking effect of the tariff law now in force,
that government subsequently notified us of its
Intention to terminate such arrangement on the
Ist day of January, 1895, in the exercise of the
right reserved in the agreement between the
two countries. I invite attention to the corre
spondence between the secretary of state and
the Brazilian minister on this subject.
The commision organized under the conven
tion which we had entered into with Chili for
the settlement of outstanding claims of each
government against the other, adjourned at the
end of the period stipulated for its continu
ance, leaving undetermined a number of AuicH
can cases which had been duly presented. These
claims are not barred, and negotiations are in
progress for their submission to a tribunal.
The 17th of March last the new treaty with
China, in further regulation, was signed at
Washington. On Aug. 13 it received the sanction
of the senate. Ratification on the part of China
and formal exchange are awaited to give effect
to this mutually beneficial convention.
China nml Japan.
A gratifying recognition of the uniform im
partiality of this country towards all foreign
states was manifested by the coincident re
quests of the Chinese and Japanese governments
that the agents of the United States, should
within proper limits, afford protection to the
subjects of each during the suspension of diplo
matic relations due to a state of war. This
delicate office was accepted, and a misapprehen
sion which gave rise to the belief that in afford-
Ing this kindly unofficial protection our agents
would exercise the same authority which the
withdrawn agents of the belligerents had exer
cised, was promptly corrected. Although the
war between China and Japan endangers no
policy of the United States, it deserves onr
gravest consideration, by reason of its disturb
ance of our growing commercial interests in the
two countries and the Increased dangers which
may result tc our citizens domiciled or sojourn
ing in the interior of China. Acring under a
stipulation in our treaty with Corea ( the first
concluded with a Western power) I felt con
strained at the beginning of the controversy to
tender our good offices to induce an amicable
arrangement of the initial difficulty growing out
of the Japanese demands for administrative re
forms in Corea; hut the unhappy precipitation
of actual hostilities defeated this kindly pur
pose.
Deploring the destructive war between the
two most powerful of the Eastern nations and
anxious that our commercial interests in those
countries may be preserved and that the safety
of our citizens there shall not be jeopardized, I
would not hesitate to heed any intimation that
our friendly aid for the honorable termination
of hostilities would be acceptable to both bel
ligerents.
A convention has been finally concluded for the
settlement by arbitration of the prolonged dis
pute with Ecuador, growing out of the proceed
ings against Emille Santos, a naturalized citizen
f the United States.
Our relations with the republic of France con
tinue to be such as should exist between nations
so long bound together by friendly sympathy
and similarity in their form of government. The
recent cruel assassination of the president of
this sister republic called forth such universal
expressions of sorrow aud condolence from our
people aud government as to leave no doubt of
the depth and sincerity of our attachment. The
resolutions passed by the senate and house of
representatives on the occasion, have been com
municated to the widow of President Carnot.
Differences With Germany.
Acting on the reported discovery of Texas fe
ver in cargoes of American cattle, the German
prohibition again .t importations of live stock
and fresh meats ficm this country has been re
vived. It is hoped that Germany will soon be
come convinced that the prohibition is as need
less as it is harmful to mutual interests.
The German government has protested against
that provision of the customs tariff act which
Imposes a discriminating duty of one-tenth of 1
cent a pound on sugars coming from countries
paying an export bounty thereon, claiming that
the exaction of such a duty is in contravention
of Articles V and IX of the treaty of 1828 with
Prussia. In the interests of the commerce of
both countries and to avoid even the accusation
of treaty violation, I recommend the repeal of so
much of the statute as imposes that duty, aud I
Invite attention to the accompanying report of
the secretary of state containing a discussion
of the questions raised by the German protests.
Reliring- Sea Award.
Eariy in the present year an agreement was
reached with Great Britain concerning in
structions to be given to the naval commanders
of the two governments in Behring sea and the
contiguous North Pacific ocean for their guid
ance in the execution of the award of the Paris
tribunal of arbitration and the enforcement
of the regulations therein prescribed for the
protection of seal life in the waters mentioned.
An understanding has also been reached for
the payment by the United States of $425,000
in full satisfaction of all claims which may
be made by Great Britain for damages growing
out of the controversy as to fur seals in Behring
sea, or the seizure of British vessels engaged
In taking seals in these waters. The award
and findings of th<; Paris tribunal to a great
extent determined he facts and principles upon
which these claims should bo adjusted, and they
have been submitted by hath governments to a
thorough examination upon the principles ns
well ns the faets which they Involved. I am
convinced that a settlement upon the terms
mentioned would be an equitable and advan
tageous one and I recommend that provision
be made for the prompt payment of the stated
sum.
Thus far, only France and Portugal have
slgnitled their willingness to adhere to the
regulations established under the award of the
Paris Tribunal of Arbitration.
Preliminary surveys of the Alaskan boundary
and a preparatory examination of the question
of protection of food fish in the contiguous
waters of ’he United States and the Dominion
of Canada are in progress. The boundary of
British Guinea still remains in dispute be
tween Great Britain and Venezuela. Believing
that its early settlement, on some just basis
alike honorable to both parties, is in the line
of our established policy to remove from this
hemisphere all causes of difference with powers
beyond the sea, 1 shall renew the efforts here
tofore made to bring about a restoration of
diplomatic relations between the disputants and
Induce a reference to arbitration, a resort which
Great Britain so conspicuously favors in
principle and respects in practice, and which is
earnestly sought by her weaker adversary.
Recognition of Hlwalian Republic.
Since communicating the voluminous corre
spondence In regard to Hawaii, and the action
taken by the senate and house of representa
tives on certain questions submitted to the
judgment and wider discretion of congress, the
organization of a government in place of the
provisional arrangement which followed the
deposition of the queen has been announced
with evidence of its effective operation. The
recognition usual in such cases has been ac
corded the new government.
Under our preset t treaties of extradition with
Italy, miscarriages of justice have occurred,
owing to the refusal of that government to
surrender its own subjects. Thus far, our
efforts to negotiate an amended convention ob
viating this difficulty have been unavailing.
The New Japan Treaty.
Apart from the war. in which the Island em
pire is engaged, Japan attracts increasing at
tention in this country by her evident desire
to cultivate more liberal intercourse with us
and to seek our kindly aid in furtherance of her
laudable desire for complete autonomy in her
domestic affairs and full equality in the family
of nations. The Japanese empire of to-day is no
longer .the Japan of the past, and our relations
with thi* progressive nation should not be less
broad and liberal than those with other powers.
Good trill fostered by many Interests in com
mon has marked our relations with our nearest
Southern neighbors. Peace being restored along
her northern frontier, Mexico has asked the
punishment of the late disturbers of her tran
quility. There ought to be anew treaty of
commerce and navigation with that country to
take the place of the one which terminated thir
teen years ago. The friendliness of the inter
course between the two countries is attested by
the fact that during this long period the com
merce of each has steadily increased under the
rule of mutual consideration, being neither
stimulated by conventional arrangements nor
retarded by jealousies or selfish distrust. An
indemnity tendered by Mexico, as a gracious
act, for the murder in 1887 of Peon Baldwin,
an American citizen, by a band of marauders
in Durango, has been accepted, and is being
paid in installments. The problem of the stor
age and use of the waters of the Itoi Grande
for irrigation should be solved by concurrent
action of the two interested countries. Rising
in the Colorado heights, the stream flows Inter
mittently, yielding little water during the dry
months to the irrigating channels already con
structed along Its course. This scarcity is often
severely felt in the regions where the river
forms a common boundary. Moreover, the fre
quent changes in its course through level sands
often raise embarrassing questions of terri
torial jurisdiction.
The Disturbances in Blnefields.
Prominent among the questions of the year was
the Blnefields incidents, in what is known as
the Mosquito Indian strip, bordering on the At
lantic ocean, and within the jurisdiction of
Nicaragua. By the treaty of 1860 between Great
Britain and Nicaragua, the former government
expressly recognized the sovereignty of the latter
over the strip, and a limited form of self-gov
ernment was guaranteed to the Mosquito' In
dians, to he exercised according to their cus
toms, for themselves and other dwellers within
its limits. The so-called native government,
which grew to be largely made up of aliens,
for many years disputed the sovereignty of
Nicaragua over the strip, and claimed the right
to maintain therein a practically independent
municipal government. Karly in the past year,
efforts of Nicaragua to maintain sovereignty
over the Mosquito territory led to serious dis
turbances, culminating in the suppression of the
native government and the attempted substitu
tion of an impracticable composite administra
tion in which Nicaraguan aud alien residents
were to participate. Failure was followed by
an insurrection, which, for a time, subverted
Nicaraguan rule, expelling her officers and restor
ing the old organization. This, in turn, gave
place to the existing local government estab
lished and upheld by Nicaragua. Although the
alien interests arrayed against Nicaragua in
these transactions have been largely American,
and the commerce of that region for some time
has been and still is chiefly controlled by our
citizens, we cannot, for that reason challenge
the rightful sovereignty of Nicaragua over this
important part of her domain.
For some months on and during part of the 1
time two of our naval ships have been stationed
at Blueflelds, for the protection of all legitimate
interests of our citizens. In September last, the
government at Managua expelled from Its terri
tory twelve or more foreigners, including two
Americans, for alleged participation in the se
ditious or revolutionary movements against the
republic at Blnefields already mentioned; but
through the earnest remonstrance of this gov
ernment, the two Americans have been permit
ted to return to the peaceful management of
their business. Our naval commanders at the
scene of these disturbances, by their constant
exhibition of firmness and good judgment, con
tributed largely to the prevention of more serious
consequences and to the restoration of quiet and
order.
I regret that in the midst of these occurrences,
there happened a most grave and irritating fail
tire of Nicaraguan Justice. An American citizen
named Wilson, residing at Rama, in the Mos
quito territory, was murdered by one Arguello,
the acting governor of the town. After some
delay the murderer was arrested, but so inse
curely confined or guarded that he escaped, aud
notwithstanding our repeated demands, it is
claimed that his recapture has been impossible
by reason of his flight beyond Nicaraguan juris
diction.
The Nicaraguan authorities having given notice
of the forfeiture of their concession to the canal
company on grounds purely technical and not
embraced in the contract, have receded from
that position.
Peru, I regret to say, shows symptoms of do
mestic disturdance due probably to the slowness
of her recuperation from the distresses of the
war of 1881. Weakened In resources, her dif
ficulties in facing international obligations invite
our kindly sympathy and Justify our forbearance
in pressing our long pending claims. I have felt
constrained to testify this sympathy in connec
tion with certain demands urgently preferred by
other powers.
Relations With Russia.
The recent death of the czar of Russia called
forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and
sympathy on the part of our government with
his bereaved family and the Russian people.
Asa further demonstration of respect and
friendship, our minister at St. Petersburg was
directed to represent our government at the
fun ral ceremonies.
The sealing interests of Russia in Behring sea
are second only to our own. A modus vivendi
has thex-efore been concluded with the imperial
government restrictive of poaching on the Rus
sian rookeries and of sealing in waters which
were not comprehended in the protected area de
fined in the Paris award.
Occasion has been found to urge upon the Rus
sian government equality of treatment for our
great life insurance companies whose operations
have been extended throughout Europe. Admit
ting as we do foreign corporations to transact
business in the United States, we naturally ex
pect no less tolerance for our own in the ample
fields of competition abroad.
But few oases of interference with naturalized
citizens returning to Russia have been reported
during the current year. One Kizeminski was
arrested last summer in a Polish province on a
reported charge of unpermitted renunciation of
Russian allegiance, but it transpired that the
proceedings originated in alleged malfeasance
committed by Kizeminski while an imperial of
ficial a numebr of years ago. Efforts for his
release, which promised to be successful, were
in progress when his death was reported.
Gen Ezeta’s Extradition.
The government of Salvador, having been over
thrown by an abrupt popular outbreak, certain of
Its military and civil officers, while hotly pursued
by infuriated insurgents, sought refuge on board
the United States warship Bennington, then ly
ing in a Salvadorean port. Although the prac
tice of asylum Is not favored by this govern
ment, yet in view of the imminent peril which
threatened the fugitives, and solely from con
sideration of humanity, they were afforded
shelter by our naval commander, and, when
afterwards demanded under our treaty of ex
tradition with Salvador for trial on charges of
murder, arson and robbery, I directed that such
as had not voluntarily left the ship be con
veyed to one of our nearest ports, where a
hearing could be had before a judicial officer
in compliance with the terms of the treaty.
On their arrival at San Francisco such a pro
ceeding was promptly instituted before the
United States district judge, who held that the
acts constituting the alleged offenses were po
litical. and discharged all the accused except
one, Cienfuegos, who was held for an attempt
to murder. Thereupon 1 was constrained to
direct his release for the reason that an attempt
to murder was not one of the crimes charged
against him, and upon which his surrender to
the Salvadorean authorities had been demanded.
Vexatious Differcuoes With Spain.
Unreasonable aud unjust fines imposed by
Spain ou the vessels aud commerce of the United
States have demanded from time to time during
the last twenty years earnest remonstrance on
the part of our government. In the immediate
past, exorbitant penalties have been imposed
upon our vessels and goods by customs authori
ties of Cuba and Porto Rico for clerical errors
of the must trivial character in the manifests
or bills of lading. In some cases fines amounting
to thousands of dollars have been levied upon
cargoes of the carrying vessels when the goods
in question were entitled to free entry. Fines
have been exacted even when the error had been
detected and the Spanish authorities notified
before the arrival of the pdfids in port. This
conduct is In strange contrast with tlie consid
erate and liberal treatment extended the Spanish
vessels and cargoes In our ports in like cases.
No satisfactory settlement of these vexatious
questions has yet been reached.
The Mora case, referred ti in my last annual
message, remains unsettled. From the diplomatic
correspondence on this subject which has been
laid before the senate, it will be seen that this
government has offered to conclude a convention
with Spain for disposal by arbitration of out
standing claims between tlie two countries, ex
cept the Mora claim, which, having been long
ago adjusted, now only awaits payment as stipu
lated. and, of course, it could not he included
in tlie proposed convention. It was hoped that
this offer would remove parliamentary obstacles
encountered by the Spanish government in pro
viding payment of the Morn indemnity. I regret
to say that no definite reply to this offer lias
yet been made and all efforts to secure payment
of this settled claim have been unavailing.
Protection of American Citizens.
In my last annual message I adverted to the
claim on the part of Turkey of the right to
expel, as persons undesirable and dangerous.
Armenians nature.ized in the United States and
returning to Turkish jurisdiction. Numerous
questions in this relation have arisen. While
this government acquiesces in the asserted right
of expulsion it will not consent that Armenians
may be imprisoned or otherwise punished for no
other reason than having acquired without im
perial consent American citizenship. Three of
the assailants of Miss Melton, an American
teacher in Mosul, have been convicted by the
Ottoman courts, and I am advised that, an ap
peal against the acquittal of the remaining five
has been taken by the Turkish prosecuting officer.
A convention has been concluded with Vene
zuela for the arbitration of a long disputed
claim growing out of the seizure of certain
vessels, the property of citizens of the United
States. Although signed, the treaty of extra
dition with Venezula is not yet in force, owing
to the Insistence of that government that, when
surrendered, its citizens shall in no case be
liable to capital punishment.
The rules for the prevention of collisions at
sea. which were framed by the maritime con
ference held in this city in 18S9, having been
currently incorporated in tlie statutes of the
United States and Great Britain, have been an
nounced to take effect March 1, 1895, and invi
tations been extended to all maritime
nations to adhere to them. Favorable responses
have thus far been received from Austria,
France, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
Failure of Samoan Policy.
In my last annual message, I referred briefly
to the unsatisfactory state of affairs in Samoa
under the operation of the Berlin treaty as
signally illustrating the policy of entangling al
liances with foreign powers, and on May 9,
1894, in response to a resolution of the senate,
I sent a special message and documents to
that body on the same subject, which empha
sized my previously expressed opinions. Later
occurrences, the correspondence in regard to
which will be laid before congress further
demonstrate that the government which was
devised by the three powers ami forced upon
the Samoans against their inveterate hostility
can bo maintained only by the continued pres
ence of foreign military force at no sm.all sacri
fice of life and treasure. The suppression of the
Mataafa insurrection by the powers and the
subsequent banishment of the leader and eleven
other chiefs, as recited in my last message,
did not bring lasting peace to the islands.
Formidable uprisings continued, and finally a re
bellion broke in the capital island, Upolu,
headed in Aana, the western district, by the
younger Tamasese, and In Atua, the eastern
district, by other leaders. The insurgents
ravaged the country and fought the government
troops up to the very doors of Apia. The king
again appealed to the powers for help, and the
combined British and German naval force re
duced the Atuans to apparent subjection, not,
however, without considerable loss to the
natives. A few days later. Tamasese and his
adherents, fearing the ships and the marines
professed submission.
Reports received from our agents at Apia do
not justify the belief that the peace thus
brought about will be of long duration. It is
their conviction that the natives are hostile
to the present government; that such of them
as profess loyalty to It do so from fear of the
powers, and that it would speedily go to pieces
if the warships were withdrawn. In report 2., to
his government on the unsatisfactory situation
since the suppression of the late revolt by for
eign armed forces, the German consul at Apia
stated: “That peace will be lasting is hardly
to be presumed. The lesson given by tiring on
Atua was not sufficiently sharp and incisive to
have a lasting impression on the forgetful Sa
moan temperament. In fact, conditions are ex
isting which show that jieace will not last, and
is not seriously Intended. Malietoa, the king,
and his chiefs, are convinced that the departure
of the warships will be a signal for a renewal
of the war. The circumstance that the representa
tiv i of the villages of all tlie districts which
we ■ opposed to the government have already
withdrawn to Atua to hold meetings, and that
both Atua and Anna have forbidden Inhabitants
of those districts which fought on the side of
the government to return to their villages, ami
have already partly burned down the latter,
indicates that a real conciliation of the parties
is still far off.” And in a note of the 10th nit.,
enelosing a copy of that report for tlie informa
tion of this government, the German ambassa
dor said: “The contents of the report awakened
in the imperial government the apprehnsion that
under existing circumstances the peace
concluded with the retie Is will afford no assur
ance of the lasting restoration of tranquility In
the islands.”
The present government has utterly failed to
correct, if it has not aggravated, the very evils
it was intended to prevent. It has not stimu
lated our commerce with the islands. Our par
ticipation in its establishment against the wishes
of the natives was in plain defiance of the
conservative tea*chings and warnings of tlie wise
and patriotic men who laid the foundations of
oor free institutions, and I invite an expression
of the judgment of congress on the propriety of
steps being taken by this government looking
to the withdrawal from its engagements with
the other powers on some reasonable terms
not prejudicial to any of our existing rights.
Statement of the Finances.
The secretary of the treasury reports that the

of $5,285,000, and seventy-nine, with a capital
of $10,475,000, went into voluntary liquidation.
Twenty-one banks, with a capital of $2,770,000
were placed in the hands of receivers. The <
total number of national banks in existence on
the 31st day of October last was 3,756. being
forty less than on the 31st day of October,
1893. The capital stock paid in was $672,671,-
365, being $9,678,491 less than at the same
time in the previous year, and tlx* surplus
fund and undivided profits, loss expenses, taxes
paid, amounted to $334,121,082.10. which was
$16,089,780 less than on Oct. 31. 1533. The
circulation was decreased $1,741,503. The ob
ligations of the banks to each other were in
creased $117,268,334, and the individual de
posits were $277,294,480 less than at the cor
responding date in the previous year. Loans
and discounts were $161,206,923 more than at
the same time the previous year, and chocks
and Giber cash items were $90,349,963 more.
The total resources of the hanks at the date
mentioned amounted to $3,173,922,055 as against
$3,109,563,284.36 in 1893.
United! States Military Forces.
From the report of tlie secretary of war, it
appears that the strength of the army on Sept.
30. 1894. was 2,135 officers and 25,765 enlisted
men. Although tills is apparently a very slight
decrease compared with the previous year, the
actual effective force has been increased to the
equivalent of nearly two regiments through tlie
reorganization of the system of recruiting and
the consequent release to regimental duty of the
large force of men hitherto serving at the re
cruiting depots. The abolition of these depots,
it is predicted, will furthermore effect an annual
reduction approximating $250,000 in tlie direct
expenditures, besides promoting generally the
health, morals and discipline of tlie troops.
The execution of tlie policy of concentrating
the army at Important centers of population and
transportation, foreshadowed in the last annual
report of the secretary, lias resulted in the
abandonment of fifteen of tlie smaller posts,
which was effected under a plan which assembles
organizations of tlie same regiments hitherto
widely separated. This renders onr small forces
more readily effective for any service which they
may he called upon to perform, increases the
extent of the territory under protection without
diminishing the security heretofore afforded to
any locality, improves Jthe discipline, training
and esprit de corps of the army, besides con
siderably decreasing the cost of its maintenance.
Though the forces of the Department of the
East have been somewhat increased, more than
three-fourths of the army is still stationed west
of the Mississippi. This carefully matured pol
icy, which secures tlie host and greatest service
In the interests of the general welfare from
the small force comprising our regular army,
should not be thoughtlessly embarrassed by the
creation of new and unnecessary posts through
acts of congress to gratify the ambitions or in
terests of localities.
While the maximum legal strength of the
army is 25,060 men, the effective strength
through various causes is but little over 20,000
men. Tlie purpose of congress does not, there
fore. seem to lie fully attained by the existing
condition. While no considerable Increase in the
army is, in my judgment, demanded by recent
events, the policy of sea coast fortification, in
the prosecution of which we have been steadily
engaged for some years, lias so far developed as
to suggest that the effective strength of the
army he now made at least equal to the legal
strength. Measures taken by the department
during the year as indicated have already con
siderably augmented the effective force, and the
secretary of war presents a plan which I recom
mend to the consideration of congress, to attain
the desired end. Economies effected in the de
partment in other lines of its work will offset
to a great extent the expenditure Involved in
the proposition submitted. Among other things
this contemplates the adoption of the three bat
talion formation of regiments, which for several
years has been indorsed by the secretary of war
and the generals commanding the army. Com
pact in itself, it provides a skeleton organization
ready to be filled out in the event of war, which
is peculiarly adapted to onr strength and re
quirements; and the fact that every other na
tion. with a single exception, has adopted this
formation to meet the conditions of modern war
fare, should alone secure for the recommendation
an early consideration.
The A. R. U. Strike.
It is hardly necessary to recall the fact that
in obedience to tlie commands of the constitu
tion and laws and for the puriKise of protecting
the property of the United States, aiding the
process of federal courts and removing lawless
obstructions to the performance by the govern
ment of its legitimate functions, it became
necessary in various localities during the year
to employ a considerable portion of the regular
troops. The duty was discharged promptly,
courageously and with marked discretion by the
officers and men. and the most gratifying proof
was thus afforded that the army deserves that
complete confidence lu Its efficiency and disci
pline which the country has at all times mani
fested. Tlie year has been free from disturb
ances by Indians and tlie chances of further dep
redations on their part are constantly becoming
more remote and improbable.
The total expenditures for the war depart
ment for the year ended June 30, 1894,
amounted to $56,039,009.34. Of this sum $2,-
000.664.99 was for salaries and contingent ex
jienscs; $23,665,156.16 for the support of the
military establishment; $5,001,682.23 for mis
cellaneous objects, and $25,371,555.96 for public
works. This latter sum Includes $19,494,037.49
ftftr river and harbor improvements and $3,947,-
863.56 for fortifications and other works of de
fense. The appropriations for the current year
aggregate $52,429,112.78, and the estimates sub
mitted by the secretary of war for the next
fiscal year call for appropriations amounting to
$52,318,629.55.
The skill and industry of our ordnance officers
and inventors have, it is iielieved. overcome the
mechanical obstacles which have heretofore de
layed the armament of our coasts, and this
great national undertaking, upon which we have
entere-d, may now proceed as rapidly as con
gress shall determine. With a supply of finished
guns of large caliber already on hand, to which
additions should now rapidly follow, the wisdom
of providing carriages and emplacements for
their mount can not be too strongly urged.
The total enrollment of the militia of the sev
eral states is 117.533 officers and enlisted men.
an increase of 5.343 ever the number reported
at the close of the previous year.
The reports by regular army officers show a
marked increase in interest and efficiency among
the state organizations, and I strongly recom
mend a continuance of tlie policy of affording
very practical encouragement possible to tills
important auxilliary of our military establish
ment.
The condition of the Apache Indians, hold as
prisoners by the government for eight years at
a cost of $500,000 has been changed during the
year from captivity to one which gives them an
opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for
self-support and, at least, partial civilization.
Legislation enacted at the late session of con
gress gave the War department authority to
transfer the survivors, numbering 346. from
Mount Vernon barracks, in Alabama, to any
suitable reservation. Tlie department selected
as their future home the military lands near Fort
Sill, Indian Territory, where, under military
surveillance, the former prisoners have been es
tablished in agriculture under conditions favora
ble to their advancement.
In recognition of the long and distinguished
military services and faithful discharge of delicate
and responsible civil duties by Maj.-Gen. John M.
Schofield, now the general commanding the army,
it is suggested to congress that the temporary
revival of the grade of lieutenant-general in his
liehalf, would he a Just and gracious act and
would permit his retirement, now near at band,
with rank befitting his merits.
Progress Slade by Supreme Court,
Tlie reiiort of the attorney general notes the
gratifying progress made by the Supreme court
in overcoming the arrears of its business and in
reaching a condition in which it will be able
to dispose of cases as they arise without any
unreasonable delay. Tins result is, of course,
very largely due to the successful working of
the plan inaugurating Circuit Courts of Appeals,
lu respect to these tribunals, the suggestion is
made in quarters entitled to the highest con
sideration, that an additional circuit judge for
each circuit would greatly strengthen these
courts and the confidence reposed in their ad
judications, and that such an addition would not
create a gxeater force of judges than the increas
ing business of such courts requires. I commend
the suggestion to the careful consideration of
congress.
Other important topics are adverted to In
the report accompanied by recommendations,
many of which have lieen treated at large in
previous messages, aud at this time, therefore,
need only be named. I refer to the abolition of
the /ee system as a measure of compensation
to federal officers; the enlargement of tlie
powers of United .States commissioners, at
least in the territories; the allowance of writs
of error in criminal oases on behalf of the
United States, and the establishment of de
grees in the crime of murder.
A topic dealt with by the attorney-general
of much importance is the condition of the
administration of justice in the Indian territory.
Tlie permanent solution of what is called the
Indian problem Is probably not to be expected
at once, but meanwhile such ameliorations of
present conditions as the existing system will
admit of, ought not to be neglected. I am sat
isfied there should be a federal court established
for the territory with sufficient judges, and that,
this court should sit within the territory and
have the same jurisdiction as to territorial af
fairs as is now vested in the federal courts
sitting in Arkansas and Texas.
Reorganization of the Union Pacific.
Another subject of pressing moment referred
to by the attorney-general Is the reorganization
of the Union Pacific Railway company on a
basis equitable as regards all private Interests,
and as favorable to Hie government as existing
conditions will permit. The operation of a rail
road by a court through a receiver is an anoma
lous state of things which should be terminated
on all grounds, public and private, at the earli
est possible moment. Besides, not to enact the
needed enabling legislation at the present ses
sion postpones the whole matter until the as
semblage of anew congress, and Inevitably in
creases all the complications of the situation
and could not hut be regarded as a signal failure
to solve a problem which has practically been
before the present congress ever since its or
ganization.
Eight years ago, In my annual message, I
urged upon the congress as strongly as I could
the location and construction of two prisons
for the confinement of United States prisoners.
A similar recommendation has been made from
tome to time since, and a few years ago a law
was passed providing for the selection of
sites for three such institutions. No appropria
tion has, however, been made to carry the act
into effect and the old and discreditable con
dition still exists. It is not ray purpose at this
time to refloat the consideration which makes
an impregnable case in favor of the ownership
and management by the government of the
penal institutions in which federal prisoners
nre confined. I simply desire to again urge my
former recommendations on the subject and to
particularly call the attention of the congress
to that part of tlie report of the secretary of
war in which he stated that the military prison
at Fort Leavenworth, Kas.. cun be turned over
to the government ns a prison for federal con
victs without the least difficulty, and with
an actual saving of money from every point of
view.
Pending a more complete reform, I hope that
by the adoption of the suggestion of the secre
tary of war, this easy step may be taken in tic
direction of the proper care of its convicts by
the government of the United States.
Tlie Postolllce Department.
The report of the postmaster-general presents
a compreh ns*-,e statement of the operations of
the Postoffice department for the last fiscal
year. The receipts of the department during
the year amounted to .$75,080,479.04, and the
expenditures to $84,324,414.15. The transac
tions of the postal service indicate with baro
metric certainty the fluctuations in the busi
ness of the country. Inasmuch, therefore, as
business complications continued to exist
throughout the last year to an unforeseen ex
tent. it is surprising that the deficiency of
revenue to meet the expenditures of the Post
office department, which was estimated in ad
vance at about .$8,000,000, should be exceeded
by nearly $1,250,000. The ascertained rev
enues of the last year, which were the basis of
calculation for tlie current year, being, less than
estimated, the deficiency for the current year
will be correspondingly greater, though the
postmaster-general stales that the latest indi
cations are so favorable that he confidently
predicts an increase of at least 8 per cent, in
the revenues of the current year over those of
the last year. The expenditures increase
steadily and necessarily with the growth and
needs of the country, so that the deficiency is
greater or less in any year depending upon the
volume of receipts. The postmaster-general
states that this deficiency is unnecessary, and
might be obviated at once if the law regulating
rates upon mail matter of the second-class
was modelled. The rate received for the trans
mission of this second-class matter is 1 cent
a pound, while the cost of such transmission
to the government is eight times that amount.
In the general terms of the law this rate covers
newspapers and periodicals. The extensions of
the meaning of these terms from time to time
have admitted to the privileges Intended for
legitimate newspapers and periodicals a sur
prising range of publications and created abuses
the cost of which amount in the aggregate to
the total deficiency of the Postoffice department.
Pretended newspapers are started by business
houses for the mere purpose of advertising
goods, complying with the law in form only
and discontinuing the publications as soon as
the period of advertising is over. “Sample
copies’’ of pretended newspapers are issued in
great numbers for a like purpose onlv. The
result is a great loss of revenue to the govern
ment, besides its humiliating use as an agency
to aid in carrying out the scheme of a busi
ness house to advertise its goods by means of
a trick upon both both its rival houses and the
regular and legitimate newspapers. Paper
covered literature, consisting mainly of trashy
novels, to the extent of many thousands of
tons is sent through the mails at 1 cent a
l>ound. while the publishers of standard works
are required to pay eight times that amount in
sending their publications. Another abuse con
sists In the free carriage through the mails of
hundreds of tons of seed and grain uselessly
distributed through the department of agri
culture. The postmaster-general predicts that if
the law he so amended as to eradicate these
abuses not only will the Postoffice department
show no deficiency, hut he believes that in the
near future all legitimate newspapers and
periodical magazines might be properly trans
mitted through the mails to their subscribers
free of cost. I invite your prompt consideration
of this subject, and fully indorse the view-s of
the postmaster-general.
The total number of postoffices in the United
States on the 30th day of June, 1594, was 69,-
805. an increase of 1.403 over the preceding
year. Of these 3.428 were presidential, an in
crease in that class of sixty-eight over the pre
ceding year. Six hundred and ten cities and
towns are provided with free delivery. Ninety
three other cities and towns entitled to the serv
ice under the law have not been accorded it on
account of insufficient funds. The expense of
free delivery for the current fiscal year* will he
more than 512.300.000, and under existing leg
islation. this item of expenditure is subject to
constant increase. The estimated cost of rural
fret; delivery generally is so very large that it
ought not to he consndered in the present con
dition of affairs.
During the year 830 additional domestic money
order offices wore established. The total nnmhe’r
of these offices at the close of the year was
19,264. There were 14,304.041 money orders is
sued during the year, being an increase over
the preceding year of 904,306. The value of
these orders amounted to $138,798,579.49, an
increase of $11,217,145.84. There were also
issued during the year postal notes amounting
to $12,649,094.55.
During the year 128 international money order
offices were added to those already established,
making a total of 2,625 such offices in operation
June 30, 1894. The number of international
money orders issued during the year was 917,-
823, a decrease of 138,176, and their valne was
$13,792,455.31, a decrease in amount of $2,549,-
382.55. The number of orders paid was 361.-
180. an increase over the preceding year of
60,263, and their value was $6,568,493.78, an
increase of $1,285,118.08. From the foregoing
statements it appears that the total issue of
money and postal notes for the year
amounted
The number of letters and packets mailed
during the year for special delivery was 3.436,-
990. The special delivery stamps used on these
letters and packages amounted to $343,637.
The messengers’ fees paid for their delivery
amounted to $261,209.70, leaving a balance in
favor of the government of $82,487.30.
The report shows most gratifying results in
the way of economies worked out without af
fecting the efficiency of the postal service. These
consist in the abrogation of steamship subsidy
contracts, reletting of mail transporting con
tracts, and in the cost and amount of supplies
used in the sendee, amounting in all to $16.-
61i),047.42. This report also contains a valuable
contribution to the history of the Universal
Postal union, an arrangement which amounts
practically to the establishment of one postal
system for the entire civilized world. Sepcial at
tention is directed to this subject at this time. In
view of the fact that the next congress of the
union will meet in Washington in 1897, and it is
hoped that timely action will he taken in the
direction of perfecting preparations for that
event.
In the postmaster-general's suggestion made
in a previous report that the department organ
ization be increased to the extent of creating a
direct district supervision of all postal affaire, I
fully concur.
There are now connected with the postoffice
establishment 32,661 employees who are in the
classified service. This includes many who have
been classified upon the suggestion of the post
master-general. He states that another year's
experience at the head of the department serves
only to strengthen the conviction as to the ex
cellent working of the Civil Service law in this
branch of the public service.
Gratifying Progress Made by Navy.
Attention is called to the report of the secre
tary of the navy, which shows very gratifying
progress in the constn ction of ships for our
new navy. All the vessels now building, in
cluding the three torpedo boats authorized at
the last session of congress, and exceeding the
first class battleship lowa, will probably be
completed during the coming fiscal year.
The estimates for the increase of the navy for
the year ending June 30, 1896, are large, hut
they include practically the entire sum necessary
to complete aud equip all the new’ ships not now
in commission, so that unless new ships are
authorized, the appropriations for the navy serv
ice for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897,
should fall below the estimates for the coming
year by at least $12,000,000. The secretary jire
sents with much earnestness a plea for the
authorization of three additional battleships and
ten or twelve torpedo boats. While the un
annored vessels heretofore authorized, Including
those now nearing completion, will constitute a
fleet which it is believed is sufficient for ordin
ary cruising purposes in time of peace, we have
now completed and in process of construction
but four first-class battleships and hut few’ tor
pedo boats. If we are to have a navy for war
like operations, offensive and defensive, we cer
tainly ought to increase both the number of
battleships and torpedo boats.
The manufacture of armor requires expensive
plants and the aggregation of many skilled work
men. All the armor necessary to complete the
vessels now building will be delivered before
the Ist of June next. If no new contracts are
given out, contractors must disband their work
men and their plants must lie Idle. Battleships
authorized at this time would not be w 7 ell under
way until late in the coming fiscal year, and
at least three years and a half from the date of
the contract would be required for their comple
tion. The secretary states that no more than
15 per cent, of the cost of such ships need be in
cluded in the appropriations for the coming year.
Recommends More Warships.
I recommend that provision be made for the
construction of additional battleships and tor
pedo boats. The secretary recommends the man
ufacture not only of a reserve supply of ord
nance and ordnance material for ships of the
navy, but also a supply for the auxiliary fleet.
Guns and their appurtenances should be pro
vided aud kept on hand for both these purposes.
We have not to-day a single gun that could be
put on the ships Paris or New York of the
International Navigation company, or any other
ship of our reserve navy. The manufacture of
guns at the Washington navy yard Is proceed
ing satisfactorily, and none of our new ships will
be required to wait for their guns or ordnance
equipment.
An important order has been Issued bv the
secretary of the navy coordinating the duties
of the several bureaus concerned in the con
struction of ships. This order, It is believed,
will secure to a greater extent than has here
tofore been possible the harmonious action of
these several bureaus, and make the attain
ment of the best results more certain.
During the past fiscal year there has been an
unusual and pressing demand in many quar
ters of the world for the presence of vessels to
guard American interests. In January last, dur
ing the Brazilian insurrection, a large fleet was
concentrated in the harbor of Ilio de Janeiro.
The vigorous action of Hear Admiral Benham
in protecting the personal and commercial
rights of our citizens during the disturbed con
ditions afforded results which will, it is believed
have a far-reaching and wholesome influence
whenever in like circumstances it may become
necessary for our naval commanders to Inter
fere on behalf of our people in foreign ports.
The war now in progress between China and
Japan lias rendered it necessary or expedient to
dispatch eight vessels to those waters. Both the
secretary of the navy and the secretary of the
treasury recommend the transfer of the work
of the coast survey proper to the Navy depart
ment. I heartily concur in this recommendation.
Excluding Alaska and a very small area be
sides, all the work of mapping and charting
our coast has been completed. The hydrographic
work, which must be done over and over again
by reason of the shifting and varying depths of
water consequent upon the action of streams and
tides, has heretofore been done under the direc
tion of naval officers, in subordination to the
superintendent of the coast sivrey. There seems
to be no good reason why the Navy department
should not have entire charge hereafter of such
work, and especially as the bv, lroKrai)h j c office
of the Navy department is now, and has been
for many years, engaged in making efficient
maps entirely similar to those prepared by the
coast survey
I feel it my imperative duty to call attention
to the recommendation of tlie secretary In regard
to the personnel of the line of the navy. The
stagnation of promotion in this, the vital branch
of the service, is so groat as to seriously impair
its efficiency. I consider it of the utmost im
portance that the young and middle-aged officers
should before the eve of retirement, be permitted
to reach a grade entitling them to active and
Important duty.
The system adopted a few years ago regulating
the employment of labor at the Navy yards Is
rigidly upheld and has fully demonstrated its
usefulness and* expediency. It is within the do
main of civil service reform, inasmuch as work
men are employed through a Board of Labor se
lected at each navy yard, and are given work
without reference to politics and in the order
of their application, preference, however, being
given to army and navy veterans and those
having former navy yard experience. Amend
ments suggested by experience have Iteon made
to the rules regulating the system. Through its
operation, the work at our navy yards has been
vastly Improved in efficiency and the opportunity
to work has been bonestlv and fairly awarded
to willing and competent applicants, it is hoped
that if this system continues to be strictly ad
hered to, there will soon lie as a natural conse
quence such an equalization of party benefit as
will remove all temptation to relax or abandon it.
Public band Undisposed Of.
The report of the secretary of the interior ex
hibits the situation of the numerous and inter
esting branches of the public service connected
with his department. I commend this report
and the valuable recommendations of the secre
tary to the careful attention of congress. The
public land disposed of during the year amounted
to 10,406,100.77 acres, including 28,876.05 of
Indian lands. It is estimated that the public
domain still remaining amounts to a little more
than 600,000,000 acres, excluding, however, about
360,000,000 acres in Alaska, as well as military
reservations and railroad and other selections of
lands yet unadjudicated. The total cash re
ceipts from sale of lands amounted to $2,674,-
285.79. Including 91,981.03 received from sale
of Indian lands. Thirty-five thousand patents
were issued for agricultural lands and 100 pat
ents were Issued to Indians on allotments of
their holdings in the lands alloted be
ing inalienable by the Indian allotees for a pe
riod of twenty-five years after patent. There
were certified and patented on account of railroad
and wagon road grants during the year 865,-
556.45 acres of land, and at the close of the
year 29,000.000 acres were embraced in the lists
of selections made by railroad and wagon road
companies and awaited settlement. The selec
tions of swamp lands and that taken as indem
nity therefor since the passage of the act pro
viding for the same in 1849 amount to nearly
or quite 80.500,000 acres, of which 59.000.000
have been patented to states. About 138,000
acres were patented during the last year.
Nearly 820,000 acres of school and education
grants Were approved during the year, and at its
close 1.250,363.81 acres remained unadjusted.
It appeals that the appropriation for the cur
rent year on account of special service for the
protection of the public lands and the timber
thereon is much less than those for previous
years and inadequate for an efficient performance
of the work. A larger sum of money than has
been appropriated during a number of years past
on this account has been returned to the govern
ment as a result of the labors of those employed
in the particular service mentioned, and I hope
it will not be crippled by insufficient appropria
tion. I fully endorse the recommendation of the
secretary that adequate protection lie provided
for our forest reserves and that a comprehensive
forestry system he inaugurated.
Such keepers and superintendents as are
necessary to protect the forests already reserved
should lie provided. I am of the opinion that
: there should be an abandonment of the policy
sanctioned by present laws under which the
government, for a very small consideration, is
rapidly losing title to immense tracts of land
covered with timber which should be properly
reserved as permanent sources of timber supply.
The suggestion that a change he made in the
manner of securing surveys of the public lands
is especially worthy of consideration. I am
satisfied that these surveys should lie made by
a corps of competent surveyors under the im
mediate control and direction of the commis
sioner of the General Land office.
An exceedingly important recommendation of
the secretary relates f o the manner in which
contests and litigated oases, growing out of ef
forts to obtain government land, are determined.
The entire testimony upon which those contro
versies depend in all their stages is taken be
fore the local registers and receivers, ard yet
these officers have no power to subpoena wit
nesses or to enforce their attendance to testify.
These cases, numbering 3,000 or 4,000 annually,
are sent by the local officers to the commissioner
of the General Land office for his action. The
exigencies of his other duties oblige him to act
uj>on the decisions of the registers and re
ceivers without an opportunity of thorough
personal examination. Nearly 2,000 of these
cases are appealed annually from the commis
sioner to the secretary of the interior. Burdened
with other important administrative duties, his
determination of these appeals must be almost
perfunctory and based upon an examination of
others, though this determination of the secre
tary operates as a final adjudication upon rights
| of very great importance. I concur in the
i opinion that the commissioner of the General
| Land office should be relieved from the duty of
; deciding litigated land cases; that a nou-parti
san court should be created to pass on such
cases, and that the decisions of this court
should be final, at least so far as the decisions
of the department are now finat. The proposed
court might be given authority to certify ques
tions of law, in matters of especial importance,
to the Supreme court of the United States or
the Court of the District of Colum
bia for decision. The creation of such a tri
bunal would expedite the disposal of cases and
insure decisions of a more satisfactory charac
ter. The registers and receivers who originally
hear and de- ide the disputes should be vested
with authority to compel witnesses to attend
and testify before them.
Though the condition of the Indians shows a
steady and healthy progress, their situation is
not satisfactory at all points. Some of them,
to whom allotments of land have heen made,
are found to be unable or disinclined to follow
agricultural pursuits, or otherwise beneficially
manage their land. This, is especially true of
the Cheyennes and Arapahoes, who, as it ap
pears by reports of their agents, have in many
instances never been located upon their allot
ments, and in some cases do not even know
where their allotments are. Their condition has
deteriorated. They are not self-supporting, and
they live in camps and spend their time in
idleness. I have always believed that allot
ments of reservation lands to Indians in sever
alty should be made sparingly, or at least
slowly and with the utmost caution. In these
days when white agriculturalists and stock
raisers of experience and intellignece find their
lot a hard one, we ought not to expect In
dians. unless far advanced in civilization and
habits of industry, to support themselves on the
small tracts of land usually alloted to them. If
the self-supporting scheme by allotment fails,
the wretched pauperism of the allotees which
results is w r orse than their original condition
of regulated dependence. It is evident that the
evil consequences of 111-advised allotment are
intensified in cases where the first step cannot
be retraced on account of the purchase by the
government of reservation lands remaining after
allotments are made and the disposition of such
remaining lands to settlers or purchasers from
the government.
I am convinced that the proper solution of the
Indian problem and the success of every step
' taken in that direction depend to a very large
extent upon the intelligence and honesty of the
reservation agents and the interest they have in
their work. An agent fitted for his place can
do much toward preparing the Indians under his
charge for citizenship and allotment of their
lands, and his advice as to any matter concern
ing their welfare will not mislead. An unfit
agent will make no effort to advance the Indiana
on his reservation toward civilization or prep
aration for allotment of lands in severalty, and
his opinion as to their condition in this and
other regards is heedless and valueless. The in
dications are that the detail of army officers as
Indian agents will result in improved manage
ment on the reservations. Whenever allotments
are made and any Indian on the reservation has
previously settled upon a lot and cultivated it,
or shown a disposition to improve it in any way,
such lot should certainly be slotted to him and
this should be made plainly obligatory by stat
ute. In the light of experience, and considering
the uncertainty of the Indian situation and its
exigencies in the future, I am not only disimsed
to be very cautious In making allotments, but
I Incline to agree with the secretary of the In
terior in the opinion that when allotments are
made the balance of reservation laud remaining
after allotment, instead of being bought by the
government from the Indians and opened for
settlement with such scandals and unfair prac
tices as seem unavoidable, should remain for a
time at least as common land, or be sold by the
government on behalf of the Indians in an orderly
way and at fixed prices to be determined by its
location and desirability, and that the proceeds,
less expenses, should be held in trust for the
benefit of the Indian proprietors.
The intelligent Indian school management of
the past year has been followed by the most
gratifying results. Efforts have been made to
advance the work In a practical manner. Five
institutes of Indian teachers have been held
during the year and have proved very benefi
cial through the views exchanged and methods
discussed particularly applicable to Indian edu
cation. Efforts are being made, in the direction
of a gradual reduction of the’ number of In
dian contract schools, so that in a compara
tively short time they may give way altogether
to government schools, and it is hoped that the
change may be so gradual as to be perfected
without too great expense to the government
or undue disregard of investments made hy
those who have establishments and are main
taining sueh contract schools.
