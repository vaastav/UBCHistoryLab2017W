-1 met a bally Englishman
Upon th Bystreet today;
He hac( his cane and monocle,
'And walked with English sway.
He said: "I'm feeling fine, by jove,
I think this town is clevah';
I've traveled quite a bit around,
But, really, chap, i nevah
Felt so happy and contented
As"when here I roam?
Your right, ol' boy, it is the fog'
That makes me feel at ' ome."
P. S. While Chicago is giving Lon
don a run for its .money in the one
fog line, Pittsburghstill stands by it
self in another "fog" line. It's smoke
in Pittsburgh.
