K. Will Mean Much To City A»
f} The Center Of Fancy Po
tate Raising Industry
&
^RT.^ v, r$f lK 'i ^p
It is hard, at first, to grasp the sig
nificance of such a factory, but, after
one studies it a moment, one realizes
.lust what it will' mean. It will do
away with all waste in the potato-rais
ing industry, for it will give the farm
er a market for culls, small potatoes
and frozen potatoes. All potatoes can
be sold, regardless of shape or size.
Freezing does not injure the starch in
the potatoes, so the farmer will not
have to suffer that loss. It will mean,
therefore, a ready market for wha:
heretofore has been unmarketable.
Then. too. it will standardize the
potatoes which are shipped to other
centers for table use. It will mean
Grand Forks is peculiarly well sit
uated for such an industry. It is in the
very heart of the potato-raising dis
trict of the northwest, and it has ad
mirable facilities for shipping the
crop.
Potato-Starch .Factory to
be Built in Grand Forks
Start Work in the Spring
Will Give Farmer Market
For Potatoes Of All Sizes
And Shapes, Whether
Frozen Or Not.
Grand Forks will become one of the
•greatest potato markets In the United
States when plans now under way toy
the Commercial club are brought to
fruition. The city not only will he a
-reat potato market, but it will be the
.ocation of a potato-atarch factory
necond to none in the country.
?he club already has secured plans
and specifications for a starch factory
and foil a gigantic warehouse. Work
on the construction of the factory will
start as soon as the weather permits.
It will be ready for work as soon as
the 1922 potato crop is harvested.
This section of the country will
raise an unlimited amount of potatoes
next year, it is pointed out. In many
localities this year, the potato crop "'l'".1®
Toy Makers Will
Work This Even&ng
Good Progress Made
Men who are building toys for the
Santa Claus Girls to distribute at
Christmas-time, have been notified of
a change of meeting, and they will
assemble this evening in the manual
training rooms, instead of Friday,
which is the regular time.
The toy-makers will begin work at
7 o'clock, tonight. The work is pro
gressing satisfactorily under the lead
ership of M. F. Pitman and A. E.
Howell, the manual training instruc
tors, and some remarkably fine toyB
are being turned out.
There are a number of men work
ing vith the toy-makers this year,
who had not assisted before, and they
have done much effective work.
Amont? these are a number of carpen
ters, whose skill is shown in some
finely built toys that have been practi
cally completed.
An im^rtant item in the toy-build
ing project is the contribution of all
paint and varnish used in the work,
by the F. P. Roat Paint Shop. E. J-.
Mahn, Mr. Roat's sign painter, is di
recting the painting, and he is being
assisted by W. G. Le Doux of the
same firm. I

especial qualities. It will make this a
fancy-potato raising center.
It also will provide adequate ware
house facilities for storing the potato
crop.
There is a constantly increasing de
mand for potato starch. It is used to
a very large extent in the textile in
dustry as a size for yarn, as a finish
for woven goods and as a vehicle for
applying colors to fabrics. It is of es
pecial value in print works. It has
many other uses, too, such as in the
manufacture of glue.

are planning an increased acreage

that the price of potatoes would be
much smaller next year, but with a
starch factory here, the market would
be unlimited.

HIRED MAN GETS
BOSSY EMPLOYER
LEAVES HIS FARM
Mat Sailor is minus a winter's jot
and bed and board as a result of a too
promiscuous use of his native execu
tive ability.
He hired out to Wm. Grecian, who
lives four miles south of Grand Forks,
about two weeks ago, agreeing to
help with the chores in return for his
board and a place to sleep. It seems
ho did riot approve of the way Mr.
Grecian operated his farm, and took
it upon himself to educate his em
ployer in the matter, so the charge
says. Mr. Grecian resented and warm
words are said to have followed with
the result,, it is charged, that the hired
man drove his employer off the place
at the point of a pitch fork. He held
the farm in possession for two days,
while his employer sought refuge in
the city.
Th's morning Sheriff C. C. Stewart
drove out to the place and brought
Sailor to the city, where he was ar
raignied before Judge Phil McLough
lin. The defendant was given a sus
pended aentence".
