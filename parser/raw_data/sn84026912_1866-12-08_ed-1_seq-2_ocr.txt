I transmit herewith a communication from
tim lion. Win. II. Soward, covering thc con
stitutional amendment proposed to tho scvo
r.il States of tho Utiioti hy tho Congress of
tho fruited Si .i.s. 1 listory furnishes few ex

to cone "lo moro to the will of their conquer

o ri.iiou wo ha vu made, however so fur from
touching tho magnuniity or generosity of tho
victors, has sharpened their malice and intcn
billed their revengo.
In tho surrender Of our last organized army
of the Into Cotifiiriowtg Covornment, Ceno
rals Johnson ami Sherman, each representing
the Military power and authority of his res
pective Covernuiont, agreed upon certain terms
of capitulation. While exacting iii some res
pects, those terms were in thc main such as a
liberal and generous victor would conc?d? to
a fallen foo. TllCy were accepted in good
faith by tho Southern people, and every or
gaui/.od body of soldiers in opposition to the
laws of tho United States were in a few days
dispersed. Soarcolj had tho fact of tho cap
itulation boon made public, however, before
it was announced that tho terms wore repudi
ated by th ; Executive authority of tho Uni
ted States, mid tl proclamation was issued, of
fering amnesty, with numerous excepted class
c's, to Iho?O who lind participated in the war
These class.'s also acquicscou, und eon form iii',

generally, mad J application for pardon. Thor

was also acquiesced in with remarkable pa
Hence, Provisional Governors wor? then ap

jointly with tho military commanders, nm

and was intimately interwoven with the \vhb1

assembled, wo were required to ratify thc cot
stitutional amendment abolishing slavery i
thc United State-!, and were made, in part, ii
stnunonts to accomplish that result in Kci

refused to do soot' their own volition. ^
obeyed. In addition to this, all the citizoi
of South Carolina, with scarcely an exceptio
took th i amnesty oath ; which required the
to sustain and support all the proclamatioi
and laws made during tho war, and partie
lally those relating lo the abolition of slaver
These oaths have been observed by tho gre

Cimet upon tho result, being loss than one-ai

whereas their relativo number here isas for

In short, Congress bas rofusod to exorcise
Constitutional fonctions, and decide either iq
tho election, tho return or tho quat I lieut im
those soloctcd by tho States and people to roj

Oregon or California in Congress tho power to

or Ooorght. Who is most likely to exercise
this power judiciously-the citizens of thc State
wherein thc r?gulation is to be made, or non

this amendment incorporated in tho Constitu

tial qualities which constitute such n form of
Government ? Nay. more ; does not its adop

I United Slates shall exorcise no powers, unless
expressly delegated by tho Constitution?
Tho third section, if its spirit wore curried
out, would not only disorganize tho Slate l?ov
ero mont, in all ?if its departments, but would
render it nearly i tn po ASI ble for the people of
South Candi IIA, nt least, to reorganize a Clov
oriitnent until Congress, by a two thirds veto in
the cuso of oacb individual poison, removes the
disability. And this Cor tho rep sou that alien
secession was determined upon by the Conven
tion of thc Statu. S nilli Carolina may bo h oly
said to have been un unit in sustaining tho doc
trino, and in oarnostly and zealously prosecu
ting ibo war. When, therefore, every citizen
who, at any timo prior lo secession had taken
the oath " to support thc Constitution of this
State, aad nf thu Untied States" and who sub
sequently aided and abetted ibo war, ts exclu
ded from every official position, Stale as welles
Poderut, Ibo magnitude of thc disability ia un
veiled, livery officer in tho past of the Stute,
civil and military, was required, before entering
upon the discharge ol' tho duties of his ollieo, lo
subscribe to such a> oath, from the Senator in
Congress to the lieutenant in thu bent compa
nies. Who Iben can bc made Judges, Congress
men, Legislators. District Officers and Magis
trates? lt is to be observed, therefore thetas
to this State, the adoption ol' the amendment
will necessarily result to per ju rv on the part of
those who at tem pl to lill such olliecs, or tn anar
chy, if they are not lilied. Congress, violating
another established principle ol' the Constitu
tion, confers upon itself thc right of the pardon
ing power, when tho Constitution vests it in the
President. How long would it occupy the at
tention of that body to roinovo Ibo disabilities
imposed, fora sullicient number of. our citizens
to lill the respectivo olimos tn South Cand?na
alone? Is anarchy to pervade society unit 1 th
suits the intcrost, tho prejudices, thu passion or
tho caprice of Congress to proclaim such nets
of grace and mercy ?
There aro oilier objections of n graver charrie
tor which might bo urged; and among these it
may bc mentioned, (hut if the amendment is
adopted, we not only have no guarantee that
our representatives would bo admitted lo Con
gress, but they ure unmistakable indications
that they would still be included. It is unneces
sary, however, to dwell upon a subject which
bas boen so far decided by ibo public opinion
of tho people of tho State, that I am justified
in saying, that if theebnstitittionnl amendment
is to bo adopted, let it bo. d nie by ibo irresponsi
ble power nf numbers, and let us preserve our
own self-respect, and Ibo respect of our posteri
ty, by refusing to bethe mean instruments of
our own shume.
I tender to yon, gentlemen, my cordial co-op
eration in discharging tho grave duties and re

Ovar Courier: Tholegislativoseason found
us wending our way to tito Muu-manized cap
itol of the good old Palmetto Stato. On the
way, wo had tho pleasure of traveling with
tho vory intelligent and promising gentlemen
who composo tho delegation from Picketts
Messrs. EASKKY, NOKTON, Iv KITH and Bt>\V
KN. On thc ground, wc found our admirable
Senator, Col. GltlSllAM, who had prooedod his
colleagues a few (lays, to enable him to inves
tigate, asa committeeman, tho many charges
made against thc Railroads of thc Stato. Wo
regret to have to say, that, although thcro can
bc no doubt of thc truth of many of these
charges, yet, they are so imperfectly substan
tiated, as to render thc investigation, practi
cally, n failure. Ami more is the pity !
Tho c irs wore crowded on their downward
trip Monday. .Judges, Senators, members ol
House, and law Stud.'nts, with a "sprinkling'
of candid it os for legislativo favor. The lasl
trimed gentlemen wore very alfiblo, and keen
ly alive lo their respectivo interests.
We are comfortably lodged ?it NlCK-KltsON*:

The General Assembly convened on Mon
day at 7 o'clock, P. M. A quorum was pres

that a committee bo appointed to wait on Iii

that body was org mixed and ready to rceciv
any communication he might, have to malo
Messrs. GltlSllAM and Wi (?SON woroappoin
cd. Gen. E.\.sr.t'Y performed a like duty i
the House, lind was made chairman of th
Committee.
On Tuesday, the Committees appointed I
wait on thc Governor, reported that he wool
communicate by"message to thc Logislatui
forthwith. Thc message is lengthy, very ida
orate, and, taken as a whole, isa document i
the very highest ability. Jt cannot, fail to a
tract an unusual share of attention beyond tl
limits of the State.
On Wednesday, Col. G it ISM AM, in thc Sc
atc, by resolution, moved to refer thc Messaj
to the appropriate committees: and it was
ordered. Mr. AlKBN, of Fairfield. p?
formed a like service for the House of Hopi
sontntives.
Tho House took up a bill introduced 1
Mr. lillSSBfiL, of Anderson, to give thc el?
lion of Commissioner in Equity to the peopl
Tho bill was laid on thc table by a large ni
jority.
Roth Houses adjourned to meet on Frida
in deference to Prosidcnt JOHNSON'S "thanl
giving day." Humiliation and prayer seem
better suited to our present condition. Sti
wc favored thc adjournment, in respect to t
" powers that be."
In the House, Friday, the resolutions
feted by Mr. WAIU.KY, of Darlington, in r
crence to JBFPBKSON DAVIS, wore taken i
Mr. WAIUIRY, in a very excited and imp
sinned manner, advocated the adoption of 1
resolutions.
(ien. EASI.KY offered a substitute, whi
omboi'-icd more correctly tho views of t
House, and made an eloquent and effect;
speech in its behalf. After some parliaim
ta ry mamcuvreing, both tho resolutions a
substitute were referred to thc Committee
Federal Relations.
The Senate was engaged in consider!ti:
bill.to repeal thc usury laws. An effon
.being made to accomplish this purpose, w
a prospect of success. A usury law is ncc
sury io protect and cherish the farming inf
cst ; but, as wc have little or no money in
.State, all parties appear willing to give
project a fair trial, and demonstrate, if po
hie, whether or not such a law will ind
capital to seek investment in tho State.
It is dillt ult to divine what thc Legislat
can accomplish, in tho present uncertain

Several important questions are to bc dc
mined by this tribunal. Tho first is, whet
