Washington, Dec. 7. President Clove
land's nnnual message, delivered to con
gress Monday, la as follows:
To the Congress of the United States:
As representatives of the people In tho
legislative branch of their government you
have assembled at a time when tho
strength and excellence of our free Insti
tutions and the fitness of our citizens to
enjoy popular rule have been again made
manifest. A political contest Involving
momentous consequences, fraught with fe
verish" apprehension and creating aggres
siveness so Intense as to approach bitter
nets nnd passion, has beeu waged through
out our lundand determined by the decree
of freo and Independent suffrage without
disturbance of our tranquillity or the least
sign of weakness In our national struc
ture. In obedience to n constitutional require
ment, I herein submit to the congress cer
tain Information concerning national af
fairs with the suggestion of such legisla
tion as in ray Judgment is necessary nnd
expedient To secure brevity and avoid
tlresomo narration, I shall omit many de
tails concerning matters within federal
control which, though by no means unim
portant, are more profitably discussed In
departmental reports. I shall also further
curtail this communication by omitting a
Minute recital of many minor Incidents
connected with our foreign relations
which have heretofore found n place In
executive messages, but are now contain
d in a report of the secretary of state,
which la herewith submitted.
nideou and Utoody.
At tho outset of a reference to the more
Important matters affecting our relations
with foreign powers, It would afford me
satisfaction If I could assure the congress
that the disturbed condition In Asiatic
Turkey had, during tho past year, as
sumed a less hideous and bloody aspect,
and that either as a consequence of the
awakening of the Turkish government to
the demands of humane civilization, or as
the result of decisive action on the part of
the great nations having the right by
trenty to Interfere for the protection of
thoso exposed to the rage of mad bigotry
and cruel fanaticism, the shocking fea
tures of the situation had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcomlag n soft
ened disposition or -protective Interven
tion, we have been afflicted by continued
and not unfrequent reports of the wanton
destructlonof homes and the bloody butch
cry of men, women and children, made
martyrs to their profession of Christian
faith. While none of our citizens In Tur
key have thus far been killed or wounded,
though often In the midst of dreadful
ceneB of danger, their safety in tho fu
ture is by no means assured. Our govern
ment at home and our minister atConstan
tlnoplo have loft nothing undone to pro
tect our missionaries In Ottoman territo
ry, who constitute nearly all the Individ
uals residing there who have a right to
claim our protection on tho score of Amer
ican citizenship.
Our efforts In this direction will not bo
relaxed; but th best feeling and sympa
thy that have been aroused among our
people ought not to so far blind their rea
son and judgment as to lead them to de
mand 'Impossible things. Tho outbreaks of
blind fury which lead to murder and pil
lage in Turkey occur suddenly and with
out notlco, and an attempt on our part to
force such a hostllo presenco thero as
might bo effective for proventlon or pro
tection would not only be resisted by tho
Ottoman government, but would be re-
Jarded as an Interruption of their plans
r tho great nations who assert their ex
lefuslvo right to Intervene in their own
tfme and method for the security of Ufo
and property In Turkey.
Filiate and Destruction.
Several naval vessels are stationed In
tho Mediterranean as a mcasuro of cau
tion and to furnish all posstblo relief and
refuge In case of emergency. Wo havo
made claims agalnBt the Turkish govern
ent for tho plllago and destruction of
missionary property at Harpoot and Ma
rash during uprisings nt those places.
Thus far tho validity of these demands
has not been admitted, though our minis
ter, prior to such outrages and In antlcl-,
patlon of danger, demanded protection for
the persons and property of our mission
ary citizens In the localities mentioned,
nnd notwithstanding that strong ovldenoo
exists of actual complicity of Turkish sol
diers In the work of destruction and rob
bory, the facts, as they now appear, do
not permit us to doubt tho Justlco of theso
claims, and nothing will be omitted to
bring about their prompt settlement,
A number of Armenian refugees having
Srtlved at our ports, an order has lately
sea obtained from tho Turkish govern
ment permitting tho wives and children
of such rcfugoos to Join them here. It Is
hoped that hereafter no obstacle wijl bo,
InUriosed vto prevent tho escape of all!
those Vfho seek to avoid tho perils which
threaten them In Turkish dominions.

f do not believe thnf the present somber
prospect In Turkey will be long permitted
to offend the sight of Christendom. It so
mars the humane and enlightened civiliza
tion thut belongs to the closo of tho nine
teenth century that It seems hardly possi
ble that the earnest demand of good poo
p'e throughout tho Christian world for Its
corrective treatment will remain unan
swered. Th Cuban Innnrrectlnn.
The Insurrection In Cuba still continues
with all Its perplexities. It Is difficult to
perceive that any progress has thus far
been mado toward the pacification of the
island, or that the situation of affairs as
depicted In my last annual message has in
the least Improved. If Spain still holds
I avnna and the seaports nnd all the con
siderable towns, the insurgents still roam
at will over at least two-thirds of tho In
land country.
If the determination of Spain to put
down the Iniurroctlon seems but to
strengthen with the lapse of time, as Is
evinced by her unhesitating devotion of
largely Increased malltary and naval
forces to the task, there Is much reason
to believe that the Insurgents havo gained
in point of numbers, and character, nnd
resources, and are none the less Inflexible
in their rcsolvo not to succumb without
practically securing the great objects for
which they took up nrms.
If Spain has not yet re-established her
authority, neither have the Insurgents yet
mado good their title to be regarded as un
independent state. As the contest goes
on the pretense thnt civil government ex
ists on tho Inland, except so far as Spain
Is about to maintain it, has been practi
cal!' abandoned. Spain does keep on foot
such n government, more or less imper
fectly, In the large towns and their Imme
diate suburbs. Hut, that exception being
made, the entire country Is cither given
over to anarchy or is subject to tho mili
tary occupation of one or the other party.
It Is reported, indeed, on reliable au
thority that, at the demand of the commander-in-chief
of tho Insurgent army,
the putative Cuban government has now
given up all attempt to exercise Its func
tions, leaving that government confessed
ly (what there is the beat reason for sup
posing It always to have been In fact) a
government merely on paper.
No Pitched Matties.
Were tho Spanish armies nble to meet
their antagonists in tho open, or lu pitch
id buttle, prompt nnd decisive results
might be looked for, and the Immenge su
periority of the Spanish forces In numbers,
discipline und equipment could hardly full
to tell greatly to their advantage.
But they aro called upon to fucc a foe
which can choose und does choose Its own
ground, that from the nature of the coun
try Is visible or Invisible at pleasure, and
that fights only from ambuscade und when
all the advantages of position und num
bers arc on its Bide.
In a country where nil that Is indispen
sable to life in the way of food, clothing
and shelter Is so easily obtainable, espe
cially by tliObC born and bred on the soil,
It Is obvious that there Is hardly n limit
to the time during which hostilities of
this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile,
as In all cases of protracted civil strife,
the passions of the combatants grow more
und more Inflamed and excesses on both
sides be to in o moro frequent and deplora
ble. They ore also participated In by bands
of marauders who, now in tho nnme of
one party nnd now In tho name of tne otn
er, as may be the occasion, harry tho coun
try at will nnd plunder its wretched In
habitants for their own advantage. Such
a condition of things would Inevitably
entail immense destruction of property,
even If It were the policy of both partita
to prevent It as fur as practicable.
Wholesale Annihilation.
But fhlle such seemed the original pol
icy of the government, It has now appar
ently ubuudoued It und la uctlng upon the
same theory us the Insurgents, uumoly,
thut the exigencies of the coutest requlro
the wholesale unnlhllatlou of property,
that It may not provo of use and advan
tage to the enemy.
Itls to the sameend that.ln pursuanceof
general orders, Spanish garrisons uie now
being wlthdiuwn from plantations und
the rural population required to concen
trate Itself in the towns. The sure lesult
would beem to be thut tho Industrial val
ue of the Island Is fast diminishing and
that unless there Is a speedy and radical
change lu existing conditions It will soon
dlsaunear altogether. That value consists
very largely, of course, In Its capacity to
produce sugar, u capacity already much
reduced by the Interruptions to tillage
which have taken place during tne last
two vears.
It Is reliably asserted that should theso
interruptions continue during tho current
year, and practically extend, as Is now
threatened, to the entire sugar-producing
territory of the Island, so much time nnd
so much money will be required to restore
tho land to its normal productiveness that
it Is extremely doubtful If capital can be
Induced to oven make tho attempt,
The spectacle of tho utter ruin tit an ad
joining country, by nature one of tho most
fertile and charming on tho globe, would
engage tho serious attention of the gov
ernment and people of the Unltod States
In any clrcunistunccs. In point of fact,
they havo a concern with It which Is by
no means of a wholly sentimental or phil
anthropic character. It lies so near to us
as to bo hardly separated from our terri
tory. Our actual pecuniary Interest In It Is
second only to that of the people ana gov
ernment of Spain. It Is reasonably estl
inntod that at least from $30,000,000 to
$30,000,000 of American capital aro In
vested In plantations and In railroads,
mining and other business enterprises on
tho island. The volume of trade between
tho United States und Cuba, which in 1880
amounted to about $01,000,000, roso in 1BIM
to about ?10B,000,000, nnd In 1804, tho year
beforo the present insurrection utoko out,
it amounted to nearly $1)0,000,000,
Vexations and Costly.
nesldes this largo pecuniary stnko In the
fortunes of Cuba, tho United States finds
Itself Inextrlcubly involved in tuo present
coutest In other wnya both vexatious and
costly. Many Cubans reside In this coun
try nnd Indirectly promote tho insurrec
tion through tho press, by public meetings,
bv tho nnrchase and shipment of arms, by
tho raising of funds and by other means
which the nature of our Institutions and
the tenor of our Iuwb do not permit to be
made subjects of nrlmlnal prosecutions.
Some of them, though Cubans at heart
ni In all the r feelings and Interests.
hnve taken ont papers as naturalized citi
zens of tho united States, a proceeding
resorted to with a view to possible pro
tection by this government, and not un
naturally regarded with much Indignation
y ibc country u mcir wiikj". ,
g& 1uid loppo.rtea' by th WidesprtTiU
sympathy the people of this country nr
ways nnd Instinctively feel for every
struggle for the better nnd freer govern
ment, nnd which, In the case of tho more
ndventurous nnd restless elements of our
population, lends In only too ninny In
stances to nctlve nnd personal participa
tion In the contest.
The result Is thnt this government Is
constantly cnlled upon to protect Ameri
can citizens, to claim damages for Inju
ries to persons nnd property, now estimat
ed nt many millions of dollars, nnd to n"sk
explanations and apologies for the nets of
Spanish officials whoso zeal for the sup
pression of the rebellion sometimes blinds
them to the Imrauultles beVonglng to the
unoffending citizens of a friendly power.
It follows from the same causes that the
United States Is compelled to actively po
lice a lone lino of seaconst ngnlnst unlaw
ful expeditions, the escape of which the
utmost vigilance will not nlwnys sufHce
to prevent.
Ponltive Intervention.
These Inevitable entanglements of the
United Stntcs with the rebellion In Cuba,
the large American property Interests af
fected, and considerations of philanthropy
and hunmnlty In general, hnve led to a
vehement demand In various qunrters for
some sort of positive Intervention on the
part of the United States.
It was at first proposed thnt belligerent
rights should be nccorded to the Insur
gents n proposition no longer urged be
cause an untimely and Impractical opera
tion clearly perilous nnd Injurious to our
own Interests. It has since been and Is
now sometimes contended that tho Inde
pendence of the Insurgents should he rec
ognized. But Imperfect nnd restricted ns the
Spanish government of the Island may be,
no other exists there, unless tho will of
the military officer In temporary command
of a particular district can be dignified as
n species of government. It Is now also
s-tggested that the United States should
buy the lland a suggestion possibly wor
thy of consideration If there woro any
evidence of a dwlre or willingness on the
part of Spain to entertain such a proposal.
It Is urged, finally, thut, nil other meth
ods falling, tho existing Internecine strife
In Cuba should be terminated by onr In
tervention, even at the cost of war be
tween the United States and Spnln a wur
which Its advocates eonlldently prophesy
could he neither large In Its proportions
nor doubtful In Its Issue. The correctness
of this forecast need be neither nlllrmcd
nor denied. The United States bus, nev
ertheless, a character to maintain as n na
tlon, which plainly dictates thut right nnd
not might should be the rule of Its con
duct. Further, though, the United States Is
not n nation to which peace Is a necessi
ty. It Is In truth the most pacific of pow
ers and desires nothing so much as to live
In amity with all the world. Its own am
ple and diversified domains satisfy nil pos
sible longings for territory, preclude nil
dreams of conquest, and prevent nny cast
ing of covetous eyes upon neighboring re
gions, however attractive.
Our Conduct Toward Spain.
Thnt our conduct towards Spain nnd her
dominions has constituted no exception to
this national disposition Is made manifest
by the course of our government, not only
thus far during the present Insurrection,
but during the ten years that followed the
rising at Yarn In 1808.
No other great power. It mny safely be
said, under circumstances of similar per
plexity, would huvo manifested the same
restraint nnd the same patient endurance.
It may also be said that this persistent
attitude of the United States toward
Spain In connection with Cuba unques
tionably evinces no slight respect nnd re
gard for Spain on the part of tho Amer
ican people.
They In truth do not forget her connec
tion with tho discovery of tho western
hemisphere, nor do they underestimate
the great qualities of the Spanish people,
nor fall to fully recognize their splendid
patriotism and their chivalrous devotion
to tho national honor. They view with
wonder nnd admiration the cheerful reso
lution with which vnst bodies of men nre
sent across thousands of miles of ocean,
and nn enormous debt accumulated, that
the costly possession of the Gem of the
Antilles may still hold Its place In the
Spanish crown.
And yet neither the government nor the
people of tho United States have shut
their eyes to the course of events In Cu
ba, nor have failed to realize the existence
of conceded grievances which hnve led to
the present revolt from the nuthorlty of
Spain grievances recognized by the queen
regent and by the cortes, voiced by the
most patriotic and enlightened of Spanish
stutesmon without oven regard to party,
nnd demonstrated by reforms proposed by
the executive nnd approved by tho legis
lative brunch of tho Spanish government.
It Is In the ussumed temper nnd disposi
tion of the Spanish government to remedy
theso grievances, fortified by Influential
public opinion In Spain, that this govern
ment hns hoped to discover the most
promising and effective means of compos
ing the present strife with honor nnd ad
vantage to Spain, and with the achieve
ment of all reasonable objects of tho In
surrection. Oennlna Autonomy.
It would seem that If Spain should offer
to Cuba genuine autonomy, home rulo
which, while preserving the sovereignty
of Spain, would satisfy all rational re
quirements of her Spanish subjects, thero
Bhould be no just reason why the pacifica
tion of tho Island might not bo effected on
that basis. Such a result would appear to
be In the truo Intorest of all concerned.
It would at unco stop the conflict which is
now consuming the resources of the Inland
nnd making it worthless for whichever
purty may ultimately prevail. It would
keep Intact the possessions of Spain with
out touching her honor, which will bo con
sulted rather thnn Impugned by the ade
quato redress of admitted grievances.
It would put the prosperity of tho Island
and the fortunes of Its Inhabitants within
their own control without sovorlng tho
natural and ancient tics which bind them
to the mother country, and would yet en
able them to test their capacity for self
government under the most favorable con
ditions. It has been objected on the ono
sldo that Spain should not promise auton
omy until hor Insurgent subjects lay down
their arms; on the other side, that prom
ised autonomy, however liberal, Is Insuffi
cient, because without assurance of the
promise being fulfilled.
But tho reasonableness of a requirement
by Spain of unconditional surrender on
tho part of the Insurgent Cubuns beforo
their autonomy Is conceded Is not alto
gether apparent. It Ignores important
features of the situation the stability two
years' duration has given to tho insurrec
tion, tho feasibility of Its Indefinite pro
longatlon In tho naturo of things, and, ag
ibowft b)r post experience, tfae utter and
Imminent nun or tne island unless the
present strife Is speedily composed; above
all, the rank nbuses which nil parties In
Spain, nil branches of her government and
nil her lending public men concede to ex
ist nnd profess it desire to remove.
During such circumstances to withhold
the proffer of needed reforms until the
pnrtles demanding them put themselves nt
Its mercy by throwing down their nrms
hns the nppenrnnoc of neglecting the
gravest of perils nnd Inviting suspicion us
to the sincerity of nny professed willing
ness to grnnt reforms. The objection on
behnlf of tho lnsurgets that promised
reforms can not be relied upon must of
course be considered, though we have no
right to assume nnd no reason for nssum
tug thnt anything Spain undertakes to do
for tho relief of Cuba will not be done ac
cording to both the spirit nnd the letter
of tho undertaking.
Proposition to Spain.
Nevertheless, nil renllzlng thnt suspi
cions nnd precautions on the part of the
weaker of two comhntnnts nre always
tinturnl and not nlwnys Justifiable being
sincerely desirous In the Interest of both
as well ns on Its own account thut the
Cuban problem should be solved with the
leaht possible delay It wns Intimated by
this government to the government of
Spnln some months ago, If a satisfactory
measure of home rule were tendered the
Cubnn Insurgents and would be accepted
by them upon n guaranty of Its execution,
the United States would endeavor to find
a way not objectionable to Spain of fur
nishing such guaranty.
While no definite response to this Inti
mation hns yet been received from the
Spanish government, It Is believed to be
not altogether unwelcome, while, ns al
ready sugcested, no reason Is perceived
why It should not be approved by the In
surgents. Neither party can fall to see
the Importance of early action, and both
must realize thnt to prolong the present
stnte of things for even n short period
will ndd enormously to tho time nnd labor
nnd expenditure necessnry to bring about
the Industrial recuperution of the Island.
It Is, therefore, fervently hoped on nil
grounds that enrnest efforts for healing
the brench between Spain and the Insur
gents, upon the lines nbovp Indicated,
may be nt once Inaugurated and pushed to
an Immedlntc nnd successful Issue. The
friendly offices of the United States, either
In tho manner above outlined or In nny
other wny consistent with our constitu
tion nnd our laws, will always be at the
dlsposnl of either party.
Whntever circumstances mny nrle our
policy nnd our Interests would constrain
us to object Jo the ncqulsltlnn of the Isl
and or nn Interference with Its control by
any other power.
" Our Fat.ence Slay IJe Kxhanstr-I.
It should be added that It cannot be rea
sonably assumed thnt the hitherto expect
ant attitude of the United States will ba
Indefinitely maintained. While wo are an
xious 1o accord all due reEaect to K UOv
relemty of Spain, we cannot view the
pending conflict In nil Its featuros, and
properly apprehend our Inevitably close
relations to it. nnd its possible results,
without considering that by the course
of events we may be drawn Into such an
unusual and unprecedented condition as
will fix a limit to our patient waiting for
Spain to end tho contest, either alone and
In her own way, or with our friendly co
operation. When the Inability of Spain to deal suc
cessfully with tho Insurrection has be
come manifest and It Is demonstrated that
her sovereignty Is extinct In Cuba for all
purposes of Its rightful existence, and
when a hopeless struggle for Its re-estub-llshment
has degenerated Into a fctrlfe
which means nothing more than the use
less sacrifice of human life and the utter
destruction of the very subject-matter of
the conflict, a situation will be presented
In which our obligations to the sovereignty
of Spnln will be superseded by higher ob
ligations which we can hardly hctltate to
rccognlzo nnd discharge.
Duty of United Stntci.
Deferring the cholco of wnys nnd meth
ods until the time for action arrives, we
should make them depend upon the pre
cise conditions then existing; and they
should not be determined upon without
giving careful heed to every consideration
Involving out- honor and Interest, or the
International duty we owo to Spain. Until
we face the contingencies suggested, or
the situation Is by other Incidents Impel a
tlvely changed, we should continue In the
lino of conduct heretofore pursued, thus
In all circumstances exhibiting our obedi
ence to tho requirements of public law
nnd our regard for the duty enjoined upon
us by the position wo occupy In the fam
ily of nations.
A contemplation of emorgencles that
may arise should plainly lead us to
avoid their creation, either through a
careless dlregard of present duty or even
an unduo stimulation and lll-tlmed ex
pression of feeling. But I have deemed It
not amiss to remind the congress that n
time may nrrlve when a correct policy and
care for our Interests, as well as a regard
for the interests of other nations nnd their
citizens, Joined by considerations of hu
manity nnd a deslro to see a rich and fer
tile country, Intimately related to us, sav
ed from complete devastation, will con
strain our government to such actions.
The Venezuelan Question.
The Venezuelan boundary question has
ceased to bo a matter of difference be
tween Groat Britain and, tho United
States, their respective governments hav
ing agreed upon tho substantial provisions
of a treaty between Great Britain and
Venezuela, submitting the whole contro
versy to arbitration. Tho provisions of
the treaty aro so eminently Just and fair
that tho assent of Venezuela thereto may
confidently be anticipated.
Negotiations for a treaty of general
arbitration for all differences between
Great Britain and the United States are
advanced and promise to reach a success
ful consummation at an early date. The
schemo of examining applicants for cer
tain consulnr positions to test their comp
etency and fitness, adopted undor nn exe
cutive order Issued on the 20th day of Sep

June 30, 1896, amounted to $71,168,463.52. of
which $33,878,490 was In gold coins and $12,-
309.978.52 In standard silver dollars, sub
sidiary coins and minor coins.
The number of national banks organized
from tho time the law authorizing their
notion was passed up to October 31, 1S96,
was 5031 and 3679 were at the date last men
tioned in active operation, having author
ized capital stock of $630,014,595, held by
2S8.902 shareholders, and circulating notes
amounting to $211,412,620.
Tho total outstanding circulating notes
of all national banks, on the 31st day of
October, 1S96, nmmnted to $234,558,807, In
cluding redeemed, but fully secured notes
of binks insolvent, and In process of liqui
dation. Tho Increase In national bank circulation
during the year ending on thut day was
$21,099,429. On October 6, 1896, when tho
condition of national banks was Inst re
ported, the total resources of the 3679
active Institutions wns $3,263,6S3,313.83.
which Included S1.S93.20S 839 31 In loans and
discounts, and $362,165,733.85 In money of
all kinds on hand. Of their liabilities, $1.-
697.891.053 was due to individual deposi
tories nnd $209,944,019 consisted of outstand

The Immigration.
The number of immigrants arriving in
the United States during tho fiscal year
was S43.267, of whom 340.46S were permitted
to land and 2790 woro debarred on various
grounds prescribed by law and returned
to the countries whence they came, at tho
expense of the steamship companies by
which they were brought in. The Increase
In Immigration over the preceding year
amounted to 84.731.
Thero arrived from Japan during the
year only 11,100 Immigrants, and It Is tho
opinion of the Immigration authorities
that the apprehension heretofore existing
to somo extent of a large Immigration
from Japxw to the United States is with
out any substantial foundation.
Organized aillUln.
Tho organized mllltla numbers 112,879
mon. The appropriation for it support bv
the sevoral states approximates $2,800,000
annually, and $400,000 is contributed by
tho general government. Investigation
shows theso troops to be usually well
drilled and Inspired with much military
Interest, but In many Instances they nro
so deficient In proper arms and equipment
thnt a sudden call to active duty would
find them inadequately prepared for field
service. I therefore recommend that
prompt measures bo taken to remedy this
condition, and that every encouragement
be given to this deservln t body of unpaid
and voluntary citizen sol llors, upon whose
assistance we must Imgoly rely in time
of trouble.
It Is gratifying to note tho satisfactory
results that have followed the inaugura
tion of the new system provided for by
the act of May 28, 1S9G. under which cer
tain federal ofilclnls are compensated by
Salaries Instead of Fee).
The new plan was put In operation on tho
first day of July, 1S96, and already the
great economy It enforces, Its prevention
of nbuses and Its tendency to a better en
forcement of tho lawB aro strikingly ap
parent. Onr Foitofflco Department
Is In good condition, nnd tho exhibit mado
of its operations during tho fiscal year
ended June 30, 1896, If allowance Is mado
for Imperfections in tho laws applicable
to It, Is very satisfactory. The total re
ceipts during tho year were $S2.499,208.40.
Tho total expenditures were $90,626,296.81.
exclusive of $1,539,89S.27. which was earn
ed by the Pacific railroad for transporta
tion and credited on their debt to the gov
ernment. Thero was an Increase of re
ceipts over tho previous year of $o,51G,0j0.
21, or 7.1 per cent., and an increaso of
expenditures of $3,836,121.02, or 4.42 per
"ent.
Tho deficit wns $1,679,950.19 less than that
of tho preceding yenr. The chief expendi
tures of tho postal service aro retaliated
by law and aro not In tho control of tho
postmaster general.
Tho transmission nt the rate of 1 cent a
pound of serial libraries, ndvertlslng
sheets, 'houso organs," (perlodlcul ad
vertising some particular "Your' or 'in
stitution), sample copies and the like,
ought certnlnly to bo discontinued. A
glance nt tho revenues received for the
work done last year will show more plain
ly than any other statement the gross
nbuso of the postal service and the grow
InK waste of Us earnings. Tho freo mat
