ANOTHER RAID ON THE RE5EHVB.
Though the contract mentioned stayed for
a time the tide of sold withdrawal, Its
tfOod results could not be permanent. Re
cent withdrawals have reduced the reserve
from I07n,O. on the flift day of July..
1S35. to $7333.&S5. .How lone it will remain
large enough to render i:s increase unnec
essary Is only matter of conjecture, though
quite ! Large withdrawals fqr h!??nen: In
the Immediate future aie predicted In well
Informed quarters. About 31S.000.000 has ixen
withdrawn during the motuh of November.
The foreign statements of events and condi
tion develop the fact that after increasing
our intereii-bearln; bonded indebtedness
more than HCL'.UU.Ujj, to save our gold re

having now in such reserve 373.303.9.M. as

amount of goul drawn from the treasury
appears to be vry iarjfe, as gathered from
the facta and flute herein presented. It

On ths 2Sth of January, l&G, it was re

been retired by exchanges for silver at the

Ia other word?, the government has paid
in gold mote than i;ln-ientns of its L'nked

paid In gold about one-half cf Its notes
given for silver purchases, without ex
tinguishing by such payment one dollar of
these not. Then, adJed to all this, we are
remlndtd that to carry 6n this astounding
financial scheme th- government has In
curred a bonded Indebtedness of $3G.r00.0uo,
In establishing a gold reserve, nnd of J1G3.

annual interest charge on such bonded In
debtedness is more than $11.00O,0iX; that a
continuance in our rrcent course may. re
sult la further bond luos, and that we
have suffered, or are threatened with, ail
this for the sake of supplying gold for for
eign shipment or facilitating its hoarding
at home. Thus & sHuaiion Is exhibited
which certainly oucfht to arret attention
and provoke immediate legislative rvlief.
RECOMMHN'D.ITIOXS.
Retirement of I'nltetl States Treasury
Not en IrRfd by the President.
I am convinced that the only thorough
. and practical remedy for our troubles is
found In ths retirement an I cancelation of
our United States notes, commonly called
greenbacks, and. the outstanding treasury
notes Issued by the government In payment
of silver purchases under the act of 1SS0.
X believe this could be quite readily accom
plished by ths exchange of these notes. for
United States bonds of small as well'' as
Urge denominations, bearing a low rate, of
Interest. They should be long-term bonds,
thus Increasing their desirability as Invest
ments, and because their payment could
be well postponed to a period far removed
from present financial burdens and per
plexities, and with Increased prosperity and
resources they would be more easily met.
To further insure the cancellation or these
notes, and also provide a way by wh.ch
gold may be ad Jed to our currency In lieu
of them, a feature In the plan shou!4 be
an authority given to the Secretary of the
Treasury to dispose of the bonis abroad for
good. If necessary, to complete the contem
plated redemption and cancellation, permit
ting him to use the proceeds of such bonus
to take up. and cancel any of the notes
thst may be in the treasury or that may
Ik? received by the government on any ac
count. " - - v.
The lnerise of our bonded debt Involved
ln this plan would; be amply compensated
by, renewed activity and enterprise in all
business circles, the restored confidence at
borne, the reinstated faith in our monetary
strength abroad, and the stimulation of
every Interest and industry that wouid fol

ligation now. afflicting us. In any event,
the bends propofod would stand fcr an ex
tinguishment of a troublesome lnlebteJ
nesa, while In the path we now follow there
lurks the. menace of unending bonJs. wi:h
our indebtedness still undischarged and ag
gravate! In very feature. Th? obligations
nocessary to fund this Indebtedness would
not fiual In amount those from whl?h we
have been relieved since 1841, by anticipa
tion and payment beyond tho requirements
of the sinking fund out of our surplus rev
enues. TUe curroncy withdrawn by the retire
ment of Unite! States notes and treasury
notes, amounting to probably less than
t.ttu.ew. . might be supplied by such gold
as would be u?ed on their retirement, or by
an increase in the circulation of our na
tional banks. Though the aggregate cap
ital of those now In existence amounts to
more than JCGt.O0o.0W, their outstanding cir
culation, based on bond security, amounts
to only about jmooo.OOO. They are author
ized to Issue notes amounting to 90 per
cent, of the bonds deposited to secure their
clrcu:at:on; but In no event beyond the
amount of their capital stock, and they are
obliged to pay 1 per cent, tax on the circu
lation they issue.
NATIONAL, BANK CIRCULATION.
I think they ought to be allowed to Issue
circulation equal to Uie par value of the
bonds they deposit to secure It, and that
the tax on their circulation should be re
duced to one-fourtn of 1 per cent., which
would undoubtedly meet all tne expenses the
government Incurs on their account. In ad
dition, they should be allowed to substitute,
or deposit. In lieu of the bonds now required,
as security for their circulation, those
which would be Issued for the purpose of
retiring the-United States notes and treas
ury notes. : The banks already existing, i:
they desired to avail themselves of the pro
visions of law thus modiiled, could issue
circulation In addition to that already out
standing amounting to I7S.ouo,(M). whl.h
would nearly or quite equal the currency
proposed to be canceled. At any rate, 1
should confidently expect to see the ex
isting national banks, or others to be or
ganized, avail themselves of the proposed
encouragements ,o is ue circulation and sup
ply all currency need. It has always
seemed to me that the provisions of law re
garding the capital " of national banks,
wnlch operate as a limitation to their loca
tion, fails to make proper compensation for
the suppression of State banks, which came
near to the people in all sections of the
country, and readily furnished thtm with
banking accommodations and facilities. In
convenience or embarrassment arising from
these restrictions of the location of na
tional banks might well be remedied by bet
ter adapting the present system to the cre
ation of banks In smaller communities, or
by permitting banks of large capital to es
tablish branches In such localities as would
serve the &eotle. so reirulatM and re
strained as to secure their safe and con-'
servative control and management.
But there might not be the necessity for
such an addition to the currency by new
Issues of bank circulation as at first glance
Is Indicated. If we snould be relieved from
maintaining a gold reserve under conditions
that constitute it, the barometer of sol
vency, and If our treasury should no longer
be the foolish purveyor of gold for nations
abroad, or for speculation and hoarding by
our citizens at home, I should expect to
see gold resume its natural and normal
functions In the business affairs of the
country, and cease to-be an object at
tracting the timid watch of our people and
exciting their sensitive imaginations. I do
not overlook the fact that the cancellation
of the treasury notes issued under the sil
ver purchasing act of 1K0 would leave the
treasury In the actual ownership of suffi
cient silver, including seigniorage, to coin
nearly 178.0CO.CC in standard dollars. It is
worthy of consideration, whether this m ght
not from time to time be converted into dol
lars or fractional coin, and slowly put into
circulation, as in the juugment of the Sec
retary of the Treasury the necessities of
the country should require.
Whatever is attempted should be entered
upon, fully appreciating the fact that by
careless and easy descent we have reached
a dangerous depth, and that our effort wiri
not be accomplished without laborious toil
and struggle.. We shall be wise if we real
ize that we are financially ill, and that our
restoration to health may require heroic
treatment and unpleasant remedies.
THE IMPORTANT QUESTION.
In the present stage of our difficulty it
13 not ecsy to understand that the amount
of our revenue receipts does not directly
affect it. The, Important question Is not
the quantity cf money received in revenue
payments, but the kind of money we main
tain, and our ability to continue In a sound
financial condition. We are considering the
government holding of gold as related to
tho soundness of our money, and as af
fecting ouf national credit and monetary
strengths If our gold reserve had never
been impaired; if no bonds had been Issued
to replenish It: if there had been no fear
,nd timidity concerning our ability to
continue gold payment; If any part of
our revenues were now paid In gold, and
if wo could look to our gold receipts as
a means of maintaining a safe reserve,
the amount of our revenues would be an
Influential factor in the problem. Rut, un
fortunately, all the circumstances that
might lend weicht to this consideration
are entirely lacking. In our present pre
dicament no geld is received by the gov
ernment In payment of revenue charges,
nor-would there be If the revenues were
increased. The receipt? of the treasury.
hen not In silver certificates, consist of
United States notes and treasury notes
issued for silver purchases.
These forms or money are only useful
to the government in paying Its current
ordinary expenses, and Its quantity In
government possession does not In the
least contribute toward giving us that
kind Of a Eafe financial standing or con
dition which 13 built on gold alone. If
It I said that these notes, If held by the
government, can be used to obtain gold
'or enr reserve, the answer Js easy. The
ecpl draw gold from the treasury on
demand upon United States notes and
treasury notes, but the proposition that
the treasury enn on demand draw gold
'rom the people upon them, wciid be
regarded in these days with wonder and
amusement: nnd. even If this could bo
'lone, there Is nothing to prevent those
thus parting with their jsold from regain
'"g It tho next dav or the next hour by
the presentation of the notes they received
In exchange for it.
The Secretary of the Treasury might use
such notes taken from a surolus revenue
to V.uy roM in the market. Of course he
could nn do this' without paying a pre
mium. Private holders of gold, unlike the
government, have no par'ty to maintain,
and would not be restrained from mak
Irg the- best 'bargain possible1 when they
'nrrtisbed sold to the treasury. But the
moment th Secretary of the Treasury
boue-Ht g1 1 on any terms above par he
would establish a general and universal
-rpmlum unon it, thus breaking down the
rarity between gold and silver which the
government Is pledged to maintain, and
TMrl"ir the way to new and serious com
Ir. the meantime the premium would not
ren;a?r stationary, and the absurd spec
tacle mteht be presented of a de-!er ski
ing gold to the government, and, with United
States notes cr treasury notes in h!s hand
Immediately clamoring for its return, and
a resale at a hiather premium. It may be
claimed that a !arge revenue and reduced
roceirts m'eht favorably uffect the situa
tion under discussion by affording an oppor
tunity of retaining those note in the treas
ury when received, and thus preventing
their presentation for gold. -Such retention,
to be useful, ought to be at least measure
ably permanent, end this is precisely what
is prohibited, so far a the United Rt-jf5
nott-s are concerned. The law of 1&T8. for
bidding their future retirement, in so many
words provides that these notes, when re
ceived into tho treasury and belonging to
the United States, shall be "paid out again
and kept in circulation." ,
COULJ3 NOT FAY OUT SILVER ALONE.
It will, moreover, be readily seen that
the government could not refuse to pay out
United' States notes and treasury notes ir
current transactions, when demanded, and
insist on paying out silver alone, and still
maintain the parity between that metal and
the curency representing gold. Besides the
accumulation in the treasury of currency
of any kind exacted from the people through
taxation is Justly regarded as an evil, and it
cannot proceed far without a vigorous pro
test against an unjustifiable retention ot
money from the business of the country,
and a denunciation of a scheme of taxation
which proves Itself to be unjust when U
takes from the earnings and income of th
citizen money so much in. excess of th
needs of government support that larg
sums can be gathered and kept in the treas
ury. Such a condition has- heretofore. In
times of surplus revenue, led the govern
ment to restore currency to the people by
the purchase of. its unmatured bonds at a
large premium and by a large increase of
Its deposits In national banks, and we easi
ly remember that the abuse of treasury ac
cumulation has furnished a most persuasive
argument In favor of legislation radically
reducing our tariff taxation.
Perhaps it is suppostd taat the sufficient
revenue" receipts would in a sentimental
way improve the situation by Inspiring con
fidence in our solvency, and allaying the
fear of pecuniary exhaustion. And yet all
.through our struggles to maintain our iro'd
reserve there never has been any apprehen
sion as to our ready ability to pay our way
with such money as we had. and the ques
tion of our currency has not entered into
the estimate of our solvency. Of course.
the general Mate of our funds, exclusive of
goU. was entirely immaterial to the foreign
creditor anl investor. His debt could only
be palJ in gold, and his only concern was
our ability to keep on hand that knd of
money.
On July 1, 1S0C, more than a year and a
half before the first bonis were issued to re
plenish the gold reserve, there was a net
balance la the treasury, exclusive or sucn
reserve, of less than J13.000.fXj0. but the
col 3 reserve amounted to more than $114.-
000, (ft), which was the quieting feature of
the situation. It was when the siock or
gold began rapidly to fall that fright super
vened and our securities held abroad were
returned for sale, and debts owed abroad
were pressed for payment. In the mean
time, tvtens've shipm nis of gold anl other
unfavorable Indications caused restlessness
and fright among our people at home.
Thereupon the genen.l state of our funds,
exclusive of gold, became also Immaterial
to them, and they, .oo, drew gold from
the treasury for hoarding against all con
tingencies. This is plainly shown by the
large increase In the proportion of gold
withdrawn, which was retained by our
own people as time and threatening Inci
dents progressed. During the fiscal year
enllng June 20. 1S34, nearly SS5.000.000 In gold
was withdrawn from the treasury, and
about J77.UjO,000 was sent abroad, while dur
ing the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, over
n;,0l,CM) was drawn out, of which only
6.000.000 was shipped, leaving a large bal
ance of such withdrawals to be accounted
for by domestic hoarding.
Inasmuch as the withdrawal of oar gold
has resulted largely from fright, there is
nothing apparent that will prevent its con
tinuance or recurrence, with its natural con
sequences, .except such a change in our
financial methods as will reassure the
frightened and make the desire for gold less
Intense. It is not clear how an increase of
revenue, unless it be in gold, can satisfy
those whose only anxiety is to gain gold
from the government's store. It cannot,
therefore, be eafe to rely on increased rev
enues as a cure for our present troubles.
WHY THE BOND9 WERE ISSUED.
It is possible that the suggestion of in
creased revenue as a remedy for the diffi
culties we are considering may have orig
inated In an intimation of a distinct al
legation, that the bonds which have been
issued, ostensibly to replenish our gold re
serve, were really issued to supply Insuffi
cient revenue. Nothing can be further from
the truth. Bonds were Issued to obtain
gold for the maintenance of our national
credit. As has been shown, the gold thu
obtained has been drawn against the treas
ury upon United States notes and trcasur
notes. This operation would have been
promptly prevented if possible. Hut thest
notes, having thus been passed to the treas
ury, they became the money of the govern
ment, like any other ordinary government
funds, ami there was no.h.ng to do but to
use them in paying government expenses
when needed.
At no time when bonds have been issued
has there been any consideration of the
question of paying the expenses of govern
ment with their proceeds. There was no
necessity to consider that question. At tht
time of each bond Issue we had a safe sur
plus In the treasury for ordinary operation
exclusive of the gold In our reserve. In
eDruary. isw, when the first issue of bonds
was made, such surplus amounted to over
18,000.000: in November, when the seconri
Issue was made, it amounted to more than
lu.uou.ow, and In February, im, when bonds
for the third time were issued, such surplus
amounted to more than J100.000.000. It now
amounts to 193.072,420.30. Beside . all this,
the Secretary of the Treasury had no au
thorlty whatever to issue bonds to increase
ine ord.nary revenues or to pay current ex
penses.
I cannot but think there has been some
conrusion or ideas regarding the effects ol
the issue Of bonds an.i.th results nf thf
withdrawal of gold. It was the latter pro
cess and not the former, by substitutlnf

TIIK SILVRR at ESTIO.V.
Kvll Thnt Would Foll,w the Adop
tion or liiltmlted Free Colnnur.
...me i ndve enueavored to make a rlaln
statement of the disordered condition of our
currency and the present dangers facing
our prosperity, and to suggest a way which
leads to a safer financial system. I have
coi'tantly'had in mind the fact that nianv
of my countrymen, whose sincerity I d0
not doubt. Insist that the cure for the ill
now threatening us may be found in tht
single and simple remedy of the free coin
age of silver. They contend that our mints
shall be at once thrown open to the free,
unlimited and Independent coinage of both
gold and silver dollars, of full legal-tender
quality, regardless of the action of any
other government, and in full view of the
fact that the ratio between ' the metals
which they suggest calla for one hundred
cents worth of gold in the gold dollar at
the present standard, and only 50 cents In
intrinsic worth of silver i.i the silver.dollar.
Were there Infinitely stronger reasons ad
duced for hoping that such action would
secure for us a bimetallic currency, moving
on lines of parity, an experiment fo novtl
and hazardous us that proposed might well
stagger tho-e who believe that stability is
an imperative condition of sound' money.
No government, no human contrivance or
act of legislation has ever been able to hold
the-two metals together in free coinage at'
a ratio appreciably different from that
which is established in the markets of the
kvorl I. Those who believe that our Inde
pendent free coinage of silver at an arti
ficial ratio with nold of 10 to 1 would iv
store the parity between the metals and.
consequently, between the coins, oppose an
unsupported and Improbable theory to the
general belief and practice of other na
tions and to the teaching of the wisest
statesmen and economists of the world,
both In the past and present, and what is
far mere concusIve, they run counter to
our own actual experience.
Twice in our earlier history our law
makers, in attempting to establish a bi
metallic currency, undertook free coinage
upon a' ratio which accidentally varied
from the actual relative values of the two
metals not more than Z per cent. In both
cases, notwithstanding greater difficulties
and coat of transportation than now exist,
coins whose Intrinsic worth were under
valued Jn the ratio, gradually and surely
disappeared from our circulation. and
went, to other countries, where their real
value was better recognized. Acts of Con
gress were imminent to create equality
where natural causes decreed even a slight
inequality.
Twice in our recent history we have sig
nally failed to raise by legislation the value
of silver. Under an act of Congress passed
In U7 the government- was required for
more than twelve years to expend an
i.uaiiy a: least $24.(kX.00 in the purchase
of silver bullion for coinage.
The act of July 14. 1S90. in a still bolder
effort. Increased the amount of sliver the
government was compelled to purchase
and forced it to become the buyer annual
ly of 51,000,000 ounces or practically the en
tire product of the mines. Under both
laws silver rapidly and steadily declined
in value. The prophecy and the expressed
hope f.nd expectation of those in the Con
gre5s, who led In the passage of the last
mentioned act, that It would re-establish
and maintain the former parity between
the two metals are still fresh in our mem-
ry RESULTS OF FREE COINAGE.
In the light of these experiences, which
accord with the experiences of other na
tions, there is certainly no secure ground
for the belief that an act of Congress
could now bridge an inequality of CO per
cent, between gold and silver at our pres
ent ratio, nor is there the least possibility
that our country, which has less than one
seventh of the sliver money In the world,
could by. its action alone raise not only
our own but all sliver to its lost ratio
with gold. Our attempts to accomllsh this
by the tree coinage of silver at a ratio
differing widely from actual relative values
would be the signal for the complete de
parture of gold from our calculation, the
immediate and Urge contraction of our
circulating medium and a shrlnkase in tho
n-al value and monetary efficiency of till
other forms of currency, as they settled
to the level of silver monometallism.
Every one who receives a nxtd salary.
and every worker for wages, would find the
dollar in his hand ruth.cssly scaled down
to the point of bitter disappointment, ir
not to pinching privation. A cnange in our
standard to buyer monometallism would
also bring on a collapse of the entire sys
tem or credit, wnicn, wnen Dasea on a stan
dard whian Is recognized and adopted by
the world of business, is many tlme3 more
potent and useful than tne. tuitire volume of
currency, and is saieiy capau.e oi aimosi
Indefinite expansion to meet tne growtn oi
trade and enterprise.
In a self-invited struggle through dark
ness and uncertainty, our humiliation
would be increased by the consciousness
that we had parted company with all the
enlightened and progressive nations of the
woru. and were dtsptraieiy ana nopeiessiy
striving to meet the stress of modern com
merce and competition with a deuased and
unsuitable currency, and in association
with the few weak and laggard nations
which have silver alone as tnelr standard
of value. ,
Ail history warns us against rash ex
periments which threaten violent changes
in our monetary standard and the degrada
tion of our currency. The past is full of les
sons teaching not only, tne economic dan
gers, but the national immorality that fol
lows in the train of such experiments. I
will not believe that the American people
can be persuaded, after sober deliberation,
to Jeopardize their nation's prestige and
proud sanding by , encouraging financial
nostrums, nor., that theyk wllj, yield to the
false allurements of cheap money, when
they realize that it must result In tne weak
ening of that financial Integrity and recti
tude which thus far in our "history has been
so devotedly cherished as one of the traits
of true Americanism . v -

point. Our present standard of value is
the standard of the civilized world, and
permits the only bltalllsm cow possible, or
at least within the- Independent reach of
any single nation however powerful that
nation may be. While the value of goid
as a etaiiuard is fixed by almost universal
commercial and business use, It does not
despise silver .nor seek its banishment.
Wherever this standard is maintained
there is issued In free and unquestioned
circulation a volume of silver currency
sometimes equaling and sometimes even
exceeding it in amount, both maintained
at a parity, notwithstanding a deprecia
tion or fluctuation in the intrinsic value of
silver.
'lhere is a vast difference between a
standard of value and a currency for mon
etary use. The standard must necessarily
be fixed and certain. The currency may De
In d.verse forms, and of various kinds. No
silver-standard country, has a gold currency
in circulation, but. an enlightened and wise
system of finance secures , the benefits of
both gold and s.iver as currency and circu
lating medium by keeping . the standard
stable and all other currency at par with it."
.Such a system and such a standard also
give free scope for the use and expansion
of safe and conservative credit, so Hulls
jensable to broad and growing commercial
transactions,, and so .well substituted for
the actual, use of money.?
If a fixed and stable t standard is main
talned, such as the magnitude and safety
cf our commercial - transactions and bus

igcncy of confident credit, an astonishing
capacity of multiplying itsalf In flnaclal

MINING STOCK CRAZli
A NOm OF WARNING WHICH INVCS-
TORS MAY DO WELL TO HEED.
Drltlsh Syndicate Snltl to Re noomlna-
Worthless Stock and Selling; to
t Credulous Cnnttnlists.
Pittsburg Dispatch.
The expose in the Dispatch of a syste
matic attempt to boom "blind pool" mining
stock all over the country, through news
papers and unscrupulous promoters, has al
ready found verification. A special telegram
from Cripple Creek lays the chief sin on
the shoulders of a British syndicate.
"Beware of stock lnt gold-mining com
panies . that is selling for a few cents a
share." These were the words of James At
well, cashier of the Tittsburg postottlce.
Mr.' Atwell .is interested in mining prop
erty in the Cripple Creek district, and vis
ited that region and made a careful exami
nation of the goli field. Mr. Atwell said,
further:
"Cripple Creek is undoubtedly the most
wonderful gold camp In the United States.
Some of the ore Is of a low grade, but the
cost of labor and of smelting has been so
reduced in recent years that ore yielding
$13 a ton will pay for the mining. The suc
cess of some of the mines, and the general
circulation ot the fact that Cripple Creek
is full of gold, have given, the sharpers their
opportunity. Recently many wild-cat com
panies have been organized, which have
bought or leased property In the Cripple
Creek region, but outside the gold belt and
not worth a continental. These companies
have a big capital stock, on paper only,.
and they are floating their shares In East
ern cities for the purpose of catching puck
ers.. These shares are not listed on the Colo
rado Springs Mining Exchange, and they
are quoted -at only a few cents on the dol
lar. Such stock is of no account. The par
value of mining flock is U a share, and the
stock of mines which are really valuable
is quoted at a high figure, some of it being
worth $2 and more a share. Considerable
of this worthless stock is being pushed in
Europe, especially in England, where there
seems to be an idea that great fortunes
are to be made in anything that Is called
gola-mining property."
HEADQUARTERS IN THE WEST.
No mining companies merely for the pur
pose of milking the market have been or
ganized in Pittsburg. These companies have
their headquarters in Colorado, either in
'Denver, Colorado Springs or Cripple Creek.
Agents of some of them have been operat
Ing in this community, and a considerable
quantity of wildcat stock has recently
been sold in Allegheny City at 1 cent a
share. Reputable brokers deny that they
are meddling with such stock, but the
men who are handling them seem to be
lieve that the people of the Northslde are
more gullible than the people of Pittsburg.
They have been working especially among
th Germans and have a particular pre
dllection for widows who have money to
Invest. Any person who buys mining stock
at less than 10 cents a share is' almost
certain to lose every cent invested, and
even at a few cents above that figure any
return is extremely doubtful.
The agents of these stocks carry with
them circulars from Colorado stock. broK
ers which are highly rose-colored, and oc
caslonally they flash a copy of a news
paper which has been booming cripple
Creek. This orten nnngs down tne- game.
Colorado brokers in mining stocks send
their circulars every week to the banks in
this city. These circulars usually go Into
the waste basket, but some of them were
fished out yesterday and given to me. They
show some queer figures. Colorado Springs
Is the central point where most of the. deal
ins in Crirnle Creek stock Is done. and. these
circulars usually come- from Cripple Creek.
brokers. The Colorado Springs Mining btock
Association - has an. exchange, where the
trading is done. Twenty-three mining com
panles, including the moft of those which
own really srood property, have their stock
listed on this exchange. - Even some' of this
listed stock ia quoted at a ridiculously lo-w
figure. .
, BUTTEN HAVE PAID DIVIDENDS.
There are but ten of the horde of gold
mining companies at Cripple Creek which
have paid dividends, and they are Gold and
Globe, Mt. Rosa, Pharmacist, Portland,
Union. Elkton, Enterprise, Moose, Nugget,
and Victor. Elkton and Mt. Rosa have not
paid anything since last winter. Pharmacist
has not paid a dividend since Jan. 15, 1893.
Its stock sells for 13 to 16 cents on the do!,
lar. Portland stock is quoted at more than
tl, but it is the only one of even the divi
dend-paying mines whose stock is abovt,
par. There is not much of its stock on th
market. It has paid half a million dollars in'
dividends, its last payment being 2. cents,
a share Nov. 15.
Most of the mining stocks are not listed
on the Colorado Springs Exchange. Some
of tho unlisted stocks are worth something,
b-it most of them are simply rainbows.
They have high-sounding names, but low
sounding quotations. There is, for in
stance, the "Wheel of Fortune." Its al
leged capitalization is $1,250,jo0. Nov. 15 its
itock was quoted in Colorado Springs at
91 mUls on the dollar, and one week later
It Lad crept up the extra half mill to the
even penny. Then there is the Goldstone,
worth a million, less than 2 cents a share;
the Golden Ear?le, 3 cents; the Golden Age,
4 cents; the Eureka, v2 cent; the Golden
Dale, H cent; the Magna Charter, 3 cents;
the Jack Pot, 9i ctMUs; the Silver State, 2
cents; the Star of the West, 2 cents, and so
on. Are these names not attractive? -
Within the last three or four weeks a
horde of companies have been organized at
Cripple Creek merely for rpeculative pur
poses. Many of these concerns ar simply
schemes to bleed the people of the East and
of England. A gentleman who has inter
ests in the gold field said yesterday; . ..
LONDONER IS EASY GAME.
"I learned only a few days ago that' cer
tain mining shares are selling In London for
5 sterling, or $25. You can buy that, very
stock In Cripple Creek, where the poverty
of the property is known, for 1 cent a
share. That shows how the English people
are being bled."
There are Indications that some smart
Englishmen are going Into the bleeding
business on their own account. A' special
telegram received yesterday from Cripple
Creek says: "It Is now known that a rich
British syndicate is gathering up cheap
and worthless claims, and stocking each
for from $1.0oo,0Oj to $o.000.U00. Their scheme
is to list them on every exchange list, rep
utable if they can, disreputable if they
must, and then making 'wash sales , among
themselves. In this way they succeed In
giving the stock a fictitious value, when
they unload on the suckers, the latter
learning too late that he holds a lot of
worthless paper on claims clear on the out
side of the paying streaks. Within the
past six weeks innumerable suspicious com
panies have been springing up. so fast that
no track can be kept of them. Many of
these have sold their alleged claims to for
eigners, believed to represent the big
bunko syndicate and its many agents. It is
believed they intend to milk both countries
completely ere the Cripple Creeek craze dies
away. None of the good companies, with
really valuable properties, have ever been
asked to name a price by these intending
swindlers."
Reputable mining stock brokers, whose
aeents have been over the Crippie Creek
field, recommend the stock of only twenty
two companies as safe for Investment and
yet there are several -undred companies
organized and having stock on the market.
One firm says, in its circular, "Re careful
of the wild-cat companies that are on the
outside of the belt."
Here is one of the attractive advertise
ments of a Colorado mining company;
"The best profits in mining are from
leases. The investment is small, being
merely a working capital, not a large pur
chase fund, and at the same time' all the
product goes to the lessees except a small
royalty to the owners. This company offers
an opening for investment on strictly safe
business principles. At 5 cents a share Its
stock Is a good investment." - .
A hint of how the residents of Eastern
cities are being worked is given in the last
issue of The Mining Industry and Review,
published In Denver, which says: -
"For ways that are dark and tricks that
beat the crowd, commend U3 to the Bos
ton promoter. There is nothing he Is not
up to, unless It be an uor.est deal. The last
manifestation was in the Boston and Crip
ple Creek, . a company which owns an un
productive prospect on Tenderfoot hill.. As
mlnnr rViomo It 1 fl 'TiAce'hl.i m.4nn.
S The Boston fellows got an option on a block
I of stock, misrepresented the property and
sold stock SO per cent. . above par.
The Yankees steal them blind." - l'
Elsewhere the Review says: "A simple
ton rtadeth a prospectus and saith unto
his soul, Tx, Is It not a good gule unto
fortttner letter on. when he has ivtn mad-
a bankrupt h? klcketh and curseth and will
not be conlforted."
