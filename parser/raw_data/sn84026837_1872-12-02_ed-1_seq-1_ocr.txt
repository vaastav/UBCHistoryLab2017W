We do not need the late statement of Mara
that on his behalf the whole

enabled him long since to bring to justic

who are not denounced? The professional
confidence reposed in him only bound him not
to use it against his clients. But they could

once convicted for their sham in the matter,
ami also pardoned. Their could lie no action
against them possible. Their pardon is g Miernl
ly thought to have been a mode of bribing them
to "silence." They screened the "Ring,"
and the "King" screened them. They

least M ira did till now, when lie wants
another pardon. Dougherty, it was thought
intended to make some revelations, hut these
were smothered in his blood.
But what lias silenced the District At

In tiie late trial of Mara, Mr. Mann had the
chance to bring this whole matter Is'fore the
public. But he sat vigilant as a watch tlog,
not to detect, hut to shield tiie litige con

sassination of its oItlccr, and other foul crimes
lay hid. He could not smell them out; he

I'nited States, who held the singular position
of private counsel for the assassin, was tiim
