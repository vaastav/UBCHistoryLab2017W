THE UTAH A SURTHEK5.
We see it stated that the work of grading
the road bed of the Utah & Northern railway
has been advanced to Eagle Rock Bridge, and
that track laying is in progress at the rate of
one mile a day. This not only looks like
business, but is business. There is excellent
authority for saying that sufficient iron will
be manufactured this winter to extend the
track next year a distance of 200 miles north
of Snake River Crossing. That will bring
the iron horse a fair distance inside of Mon
tana's limits. Mr. Jay Gould and associates
are apparently the only ones in good earnest
engaged in hastening railroad construction to
our doors. The Northern Pacific people have
given us plenty of promises, but precious lit
tle of performance. Jay Gould has done
very little talking, but a "heap" of solid
work. We desire to see this Uath &
Northern road completed to the geographical
pivot and business center of Montana. Our
people, we believe are generally disposed to
favor and encourage this undertaking, and
to beckon the good work forward by such
means as lay in their power. A liberal period
of exemption from taxation as an induce
ment for early railroad connection with the
transcontinental lines will, w r e think, be
voted by the Legislature. Should Jay Gould
and associates require something more, the
Herald on its own responsibility will under
take to add a guarantee of 30,000 tons of
freight and 10,000 passengers the first year
the narrow-gauge strikes Helena. We be
lieve this estimate of patronage is small—
much less, in fact, than what the first full
year's business will give the railroad. Jay
Gould has now to do wdth railroads that pay
dividends. He has in the Utah & North
ern a road which, when completed to
the heart of Montana, will pay him better
in proportion than the Union Pacific.
The tide of emigration setting toward Mon
tana; the grand mineral developments we are
making ; the enormous mercantile and other
tonnage—estimated the present year at 44,
000,000 pounds—which must be brought to
us, and the thousands of tons to be carried
away—these matters we presume, have re
ceived full investigation and consideration.
The railroad authorities are making no mis
take in hurrying forward the narrow-gauge
to Montana. It should penetrate our south
ern border in 1879.

A dispatch announces the death 3 esterday
t Butte of Dr. Auson Ford, at the age of 72
ears' Mr. Ford was one of our old pio
eers, having come to the Territory in 1863
nd settled at Nevada, in Alder Gulch, where
e engaged in the mercantile business. In
865 or 1866 he removed to Butte, where, we
elieve, he has since continuously resided,
nd where for many years he has been a jus
ice of the peace and postmaster, holding the
itter office at the time of his death. He was
man of cheerful disposition and of intelli
;ence, and the newspapers of the Territory
iaye frequently been indebted to him for cor
espondence of value. He won hosts of
riends, took a lively interest in public af
airs, during much of his life was an antive
)emocratic partisan, but in recent years his
»arty ties were considerably relaxed. We
lelieve he was a native of the State of New
fork.

The railroad kings are all gathering in
Washington to lay plans and marshal their
forces for the approaching campaign in Con

dent of the Northern Pacific, Brown of the
Texas Pacific, and Huntington, of the Central
Pacific.
The White Pine News, established at
Hamilton, Nevada in 1870, has stopped pub
lication. The reason of its suspension was
caused by the going down of Hamilton, and
the inability of its publisher to print the pa
per any longer without sustaining a loss.
The report of the Surgeon General shows
that the number of deaths from yellow fever

THE EHIKESE IN CALIFORNIA.
The constitutional convention, now in ses
sion, has before it two amendments which
seem likely to be adopted—prohibiting the
immigration of Chinese and all other persons
ineligible to become citizens of the United
States, and authorizing the Legislature to give
effect to this prohibition by appropriate legis
lation. The Legislature has already attempt
ed the same thing, and the trial and appeal to
the United States Supreme Court found its
laws declared unconstitutional. We do not
know how it can be thought that a constitu
tional convention has any higher power than
a Legislature to interfere with the national
constitution and treaties made pursuant there
to. Secretary Evarts has just emerged from
a diplomatic conflict with Lord Salisbury,
wherein he successfully maintained that rights
acquired under treaty were not at the mercy
of other than the highest sovereign authori
ties that framed the treaty, to be set aside or
abridged. Having just won a victory on this
point, it cannot be expected that our Secre
tary of State would attempt to maintain the
opposite principle before the Chinese Am
bassador.
If we have been foolish enough to enter
into a treaty with China on the same terms
as with the most favored and enlightened na
tions, we must stand to it till the treaty can
be peacefully and honorably set aside or
modified. It would injure us more than
China to violate our solemn obligations. When
the treaty was signed there had been no ob
jection to Chinese immigration. It was con
sidered rather desirable, as furnishkig that
cheap kind of labor which would enable the
settlers of California to develop its resources
so much earlier. The objections to the Celes
tial emigrant have been a subsequent discov
ery. We find that we have made a danger
ous concession for one that is worthless to us.
The mutual right to settle and trade in the
country of the other gives us little or nothing,
for our people do not want to go to China to
live, while on the other hand it is a great in
ducement to the over-crowded and half
starved millions of China to get away to a
land where they can get all that they want to
eat without working hard for it.
We have seen it recently stated on good
authority that China is not by any means as
populous as generally supposed ; that instead
of having four or five hundred millions, the
population does not exceed a hundred or one
hundred and twenty millions. So there is not
the danger of such an avalanche of barbar
ians as fear has some times pictured. Again,
the lower classes, whose filthy habits and im
moral practices have filled our people with
such disgust, are peculiarly superstitious and
by this tie bound to their native country and
not disposed to leave it but for a time and
with a sure determination to return. China
men of the better classes have little tempta
tion to leave home, but judging by a few
specimens that have graduated at our highest
colleges, there would be no objection to their
coming on the part of any one. Yung Wing,
the second person in authority in the Chinese
Embassy, is a graduate of Yale College, a
man of high character and ability, judged by
our own best standards. He has lived in this
country most of the time for twenty-five
years, and has traveled over all paits of it.
He gives it as his opinion that tea can be
grown as successfully in this country as in
China, but says we fail for want of experi
ence and cheap labor.
We are far from favoring the introduction
of more Chinese until we have found how to
employ and regulate them to better advan
tage than heretofore, but we are not by any
means convinced that their presence in the
country is such an evil as to justify us in vio
lating treaties or practicing wanton cruelty.
We certainly have power by police regula
tions and laws applicable to all to prevent
some of the most objectionable of these prac
tices. We apprehend no great difficulty in
procuring a modification of the treaty that
will restrict immigration within certain de
fined limits. The government with which we
would treat is not anxious to have its sub
jects depart, nor are they particularly desi
rous to have our citizens take up their abode
in China. We ought not to be so hasty and
unreasonable in our dealings as to alienate the
entire people against us, for their friendship,
favor and trade are full of promise to our
commerce and manufactories, and to no part
of the country are these promises so available
as to the Pacific coast
STOCK GAMBLING.
To what extent the stock gambling
mania sometimes rages in Nevada is illustrat
ed by the story of a widow lady living at
Virginia City, who had $3,500. She took
it to a prominent stock broker and asked his
opinion as to the best investment for the
money. She was told to buy Sierra Nevada,
then selling at $200, and Mexican at $90, and
did so. During the decline which follow
ed immediately thereafter she was called
upon for more money, but was unable to re
spond. She had, however, some rare dia
monds, which she had saved from a high
estate maintained by her husband and herself
in an early day of prosperity on the Comstock,
and these she gave in keeping to the broker
and felt easy. During the late crash she was
again called on for more margins, and being
still unable to comply with the request, was
sold out. She has lost her $3,500 and her
diamonds, which are now worn by the bro
ker's wife. There is no romance in the fore
going, but rather an instructive reality, and
but one of the many such now existing on
the Comstock.
BALLOT-BOX STUFFING IN SOUTH
CAROLINA.
The difficulty of enforcing the laws of the
United States in South Carolina was amply
illustrated during the recent canvass and
election in that State. Organized bodies of
men, mostly armed with repeating rifles,
broke up Republican meetings and bullied
unarmed and defenseless citizens invested
with the right to meet and discuss political
questions and vote for the candidates of
their choice. When these high-handed pro
ceedings were not sufficient for success, the
chivalric "Red Shirts," with the election of
ficers at their back, cheated the Republicans
of their franchise by the most abominable
tricks of ballot-box stuffing, by which an
honest 20,000 Republican majority is con
verted into 80,000 Democratic majority.
Richland county result, as it is made to ap
pear, is a fair sample of the enormous frauds
perpetrated throughout the State. It is a
strong Republican county, and yet returned a
majority of 2,800 for Hampton and the en
tire list of Democratic candidates. This was
accomplished, as in ottier counties, by ballot
box stuffing, and the plan adopted to count
a moity only of the Republican ballots. A
citizen of Columbia, S. C., in a letter to a
gentleman in this city, recounts some of the
enormities perpetrated against free and hon
est suffrage in the name and at the hands of
Hampton and the Democratic regime. The
writer sends a copy of the ticket used in de
luging the ballot-boxes with fraud and in
making of the election a farce. This sample
ticket is printed in agate and diamond type
on strips of blue tissue paper one and one
half inches wide by two and one-half inches
in length—a hundred of which would not
make the bulk or weight of one ordinary
ballot. A facsimile is here reproduced as
nearly as the smallest sizes of our type will
print it :

"The 'little joker' that did the business !"
is the shameless boast heard in South Caro
lina since the election, or the flagrant nullifi
cation act dignified by that name. While
popular government may thus be degraded,
and the voice of electors overborne, it is easy
to see who most will suffer by the nefarious
processes by which such crimes are made
possible. It is the South and the Democratic
party who "sowing the wind will reap the
whirlwind." As a distinguished Cabinet of
ficer has said: "If the machinery of public
justice is so corrupted by local preju
dices that it cannot punish such offenses,
then the only remedy is in combin
ing the political power of all those who will
not tolerate the new form of rebellion against
national authority. In this way a remedy
will be found or made, and its application
will be hastened in propqjtion as the true
state of affairs comes to be understood. The
disgraceful incidents of the late canvass at
various points in that section will but give
additional strength to the feeling that all the
rights of all citizens guaranteed by the Con
stitution must be secured.
S8ome of the hardships to which the Terri
tories are subjected iu executing processes of
the United States Courts are occasionally
noticed by Eastern conteporaries. The Globe
Democrat of a recent date remarks ; "Con
gress should turn its massive intellect loose
on Territorial matters. The course of Jus
tice is greatly hampered in the Territories by
the foolish parsimony which only allows the
same charge per mile for officers in serving
processes, and witnesses and jurors in attend
ing Court, that is allowed in the States. In
Montana, for instance, it costs twelve cents
per mile to travel by stage or other public
conveyance, yet the law allows no more for
mileage than in New York, where the cost is
less than two cents per mile. A case occurred
recently in that Territory in which a witness
for the prosecution in an important murder
trial in the United States Court was at an ex
pense of $403 for attendance upon the trial
The Government paid him $93 for his time
and travel. This is a shame, and a remedy
can not be found too soon."
The usual responses to the bull-dozing and
ballot box staffing reports from South Caro
lina are made by the Democratic journals.
They are all denouucéd as "Radical lies," as
the "old bloody- 8 hirt stuff told over again."
All right, gentlemen. Go on defending this
sort of thing as you defended the ciphers.
The heavier the load you carry the further in
the rear will you be found at the end of the
next race. If you think the people will be
satisfied when you account for 80,000 Demo
cratic majority in a State which has a clean
Republican majority of 20,000 by shouting
"Bloody-shirt," go ahead with the perfor
mance. No Republican is going to interfere
when the Democratic party deliberately sets
to work to cut its own throat
Prof. J. W. Powell has for several years
past been engaged in* public surveys in the
Territories. His operations were first begun
as a private enterprise simply for scientific
results. As the subject grew in interest it re
ceived notice and aid from the General Gov
ernment. It has been fostered and extended
untii it may now be said to surpass all other
efforts and expenditures in the promise of
useful results. The information thus gath
ered and presented in detail to the world will
after awhile convince Congress that it is ne
cessary to adopt a very different and a some
what diversified survey of the remaining pub
lic domain.
The subject of irrigation receives especial
attention in Powell's surveys and reports.
Utah has been the particular field of study,
but the information and results are just as
applicable to Montana. His suggestions ex
tend to the use of the larger streams and to
the construction of reservoirs to store the sur
plus that at certain seasons now run to waste.
There is only one point which we think de
serves more consideration than he has given
it—and that is, the practicability of artesian
wells. The very slight test yet made proves
nothing. It may be cheaper and better to
sink these wells than to construct dams,
canals, etc., with the liability of destruction
that will always attend such works.
Considering the vast importance of this
subject to the arid region which comprises
almost all that remains of the public lands, it
is time that government was investigating it
with a zeal proportioned to its importance. A
thousand artesian wells sunk at different
points over the Territories at various eleva
tions would not be an unreasonable outlay to
test so important question.
The most admirable features of Prof. Pow
ell's work is its promise of practical results.
Bills have been prepared to present to Con
gress making the surveys and the terms for
disposing of the lands conform to reason and
convenience. 1 he lands are first classified
into three divisions—timber, pasture, and
irrigable land—and for each a different sys
tem of survey and terms of disposition are
provided. It is already too late to derive full
advantage of a more reasonable system, for
the water rights have been so generally ap
propriated, except in case of the large rivers,
that they cannot be made to serve as great
use as they might have been made to do.
The longer the delay the greater will be the
difficulty of applying an improved system and
the less will be the resulting benefits. We
really hope Congress will give this subject its
attention, and we look to the Senators and
Representatives of the Western and Pacific
Coast States to take the lead in the matter.
The success that is attending the attempts
to reclaim the great Sahara desert ought to
stimulate and shame us into effacing, as we
may, all trace and recollection of what was
once known as the Great American Desert.
We are glad to see that the Eastern press have
become interested in these surveys of Prof.
Powell and are spreading some correct infor
mation among the people. It is not hopeless
to expect that Congressmen • will soon learn
the facts and realize the necessity for action.
We do not wish Congress to act without full
information, but we have a right to ask them'
to inform themselves and their constituents
fully upon a subject of such vast magnitude
and importance.
If the States vote iu 1880 as they did this
fall, the Republicans will regain control of
the Unites States in 1881, by retiring the
Democratic Senators Eaton, of Connecticut,
Randolph, of New Jersey, Kernan, of New
York, Thurman, of Ohio, and Wallace of
Pennsylvania. There is every reason now
to believe that both Houses of the Forty
seventh Congress will be controlled by the
Republican party. Upon that Congress will
devolve the duty of making a new apportion
ment of the Congressional Districts in accor
dance with the census taken in 1880. The
unquestionable decline in the population of
many of the Southern States and the rapid
growth of the West will shift the center of
gravity of population farther toward the
Northwest, and by lessening the number of
Representatives from the South and increas
ing the number from the North, will give the
Republican North a still greater preponder
ance of votes in the Electoral Colleges of
1884 and 1888. The mischievous greed of
power of the solid South will be checked long
before that time.
The late investigation and exposure of
poisonous adulteration in sugar set some Cin
cinnati chemists analyzing samples of sugar
brought to that city from New York. The
result was somewhat startling, every sample
examined being found to contain glucose, a
cheap material made from corn, and muriate
of tin, or tin dissolved in muriatic acid. The
glucose was used for giving body and increas
ing the weight, and the tin poison to improve
the color. Besides these are used sulphuric
acid and bisulphate of lime. By the refiners'
process, large cargoes of the raw, dirty arti
cle would in a comparatively short time be
transferred into a choice, palatable looking
article for family use. When it is remem
bered that two of these adulterating ingre
dients are active poisons, and another an in
organic substance as innutritious as land
plaster, which, in fact, it is, consumers of
the toothsome product will be somewhat
startled, and will anxiously inquire the ad
dress of the manufacturer from their grocer.
The Republican plurality in New Jersey

COURT REFORMS.
The Aiissovlian delivers itself on this pro
lific theme in the current number, and in vtew
of the early assembling of our Legislature it is
very appropriate to make it a matter of very
general consideration. $0 one who gives the
subject a careful general survey will hesitate
to agree with our contemporary that Montana
justice is an expensive and rather inferior
article. Apologists will only claim for it that
it is improving ; that it costs less, and is much
more effectively and evenly administered than
formerly. So long as this is the case we can
labor more courageously for further improve
ment.
The Mis8oulian thinks the trouble is with
the lawyers, who waste so much time, all to
mislead courts and befog the juries. If thi 9
is the trouble, how is it to be remedied ? Shall
we cut the throats of every lawyer in the
Territory and place an embargo upon any
more entering ? Shall we make it a penal
offense to practice law, or merely prescribe
the cases in which they may act, and limit
the subjects and time for talk ? But really,
are not these things already under restraint,
and if there is abuse does not the fault lie
with others as much as with the lawyers ?
There is no law but one of supposed interest
that requires litigants to employ attorneys.
We are very sure that lawyers do not work
for pleasure or glory entirely, nor as ^ rule
do they hunt up clients and urge them into
suits. The courts are always open to liti
gants to conduct their own cases if they
choose, and w T e fancy that people generally
•would exclaim against the injustice of cutting
them off from the right of resorting to an at
torne} r for help.
Again, the time that appears to some to be
wasted in argument before courts and juries
is always under control of the Judges, and
we fancy that they are the ones best able to
judge and say whether a lawyer is wasting
time unnecessarily, and that as & general fact
they will bear us out in the assertion that as
a rule the time thus employed is the best em
ployed. The best and ablest Judges that
ever adorned the bench have always acknowl
edged their dependence upon the arguments of
counsel, full and exhaustive arguments on
the extremes of both sides. Private reflection
oyer the case by court or jury do not supply
the place. Good and sound judgments come
only after full knowledge. We are very cer
tain that no judge nor any juror fit for the
place would wish the arguments of attorneys
omitted. We do not say that there are not
attorneys who talk to hear themselves and
make their clients think they are earning
their money, while they are merely wasting
time, but they are rare exceptions, we be
lieve. Juries, both grand and petit, are awk
ward, clumsey institutions, expensive and
fallible, but many are thankful that they were
guaranteed by the constitution and forgive
their mistakes. In sparsely settled countries
it is hard to get juries together. A great
share of crimes in such countries go unpun
ished on account of the trouble and expense.
Grand juries ignore a large share of crime
for no other reason. It is much easier to find
fault than provide a substitute. Vigilance
Committees may be suggested, but sober,
second thought cannot endorse the sugges
tion. It is cheap and speedy, and sometimes
just, but can at best only answer for extreme
cases and often makes terrible mistakes.
Some people think it a great hardship that
they are not allowed to testify upon the
ground of reason, hearsay, or suspicion, but
no one would care to be tried bim 9 elf on such
evidence.
There is one point in which the jury sys
tem has gone astray, and that is in excluding
from the box those who have heard or read
anything about the case. Every one ought
to have the right to be tried by an impartial
jury, but it is enough to know that a man has
not formed such an opinion but that he can
give full and proper weight to all legal evi
dence and render a verdict accordingly. This
much we heartily approve, and we believe
the courts of this Territory have always ad
hered to this more rational construction of the
rule, and hence there is no occasion for Leg
islative action in the premises.
The matter of symplifyng the laws has al
ways been a great hobby of reform. It is
easy to talk about, but as a fact not one in a
thousand could tell where to begin or end in
the matter, or would not leave things worse
complicated in the end than when he began.
The increased action and multiplicity of
human industries and relations have caused
the seeming complexity and extension of
laws.
Law is the perfection of reason. Its ad
ministration must necessarily partake of the
infirmities of finite mind. Like all human in
stitutions in its practical workings there will
be defects and fault-finding. But it remains
the greatest of human inventions. To its
present perfection it is indebted to all the
foremost nations of the past and present time,
and the most illustrious names in history owe
much of their renown to labors to make the
law what it now is.
Since the law is the heir of so many ages
we can not entertain the mean opinion of it
which it is so cheap and popular to express.
Law will always cost something. It is worth
everything and it is not the part of goo
citizenship to belittle its value or loosen its
force as the conservator of order. Meanwhile
suggestions of specific changes are always to
be re 9 pectfullyconsidered^^^
