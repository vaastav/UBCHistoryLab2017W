An increase of $3,000,000 in the pub

well for an economical reform adinn-i-i

The republican majority In the sen
ate have resolved that Mr. Cleveland
cannot palm of! that political chest
nut known ns the "offensive parti
san" on them Del. News.
The Cleveland leader, (detn.) says:
"The most ludicrous failure In the
president's message, is the revamping
of an old republiean stump speech
against Inflation and attempting to
palm it off as democratic statesman
thlp." According to Oov. Ireland, of Texas,
the area of land under cultivation in
the Unite V States has Increased in fif
teen years 97 per cent., and yet our
manufactures have increased so rapidly
that only about 8 per cent, of our total
agricultural products are obliged to
heck a foreign market.
Gen Sherman turned suddenly up
on an interview In St. Louis the other
day and exclaimed : "Now, look here ;
there's been enough written and said
about 1en. Grant to give him a prop
er place in history. You might as
well question the greatness of Wash
ington. iou fellows have done harm
enough with your gossip already."
The Otsego Herald says: "Our long
legged rival up the street is like the
the proverbial boy who had nothing to
My. We knocked him out in one
round with our bilious attack." It
must have been severe wh?n it effect
ed a person away up the street. You
must certaiuly feel better now. If you
are subject to these attacks it is a won
der you have not been abated by the
Board of Health.
The partisanship of the Ohio su
preme court, awarding the certificates
to the democratic senators from Ham
ilton county, will give the democrats
a majority in the upper branch. The
republicans, however, still maintain a
majority on joint ballot, which insures
another lease to the official life of that
iinselftVh patriot and typical Ohio man,
Senator John Sherman. Det. News.
In his message the president re
marks: "The fathers ot our families
are the best citizens of the republic;
wife and children are the resources of
patriotism, and conjugal and and pa
rental affection beget devotion to our
country." This is decidedly re'reth-t-ff
. ..... io come from an old
bachelor whose efforts in the direction
of becoming one of "the best citizens"
have been to some extent clouded
with suspicion. Det. Journal.
Ilolert Gibbons of the Michigan
Farmer, who has been around the
state for some time, reports times
among farmers better than they were
nt the same period of last year.
"Many farmers are holding their
wheat until next spring, at which
time they expect better prices. The
wheat this year is of excellent quality,
and the farmers holding.it are in a
financial condition to warrant their
doing so.
General Meade Post, G. A. II., of
Philadelphia, has passed resolutions
strangly condemning President Cleve
land for the removal of Postmaster
Huidekoper. 'The resolutions state
that the president has broken hi
promises made to the Grand Army of
the Republic not to remove old sol
diers from 'office. This Philadelphia
Post is simply wasting time and words.
Republican old soldiers are removed
wherever and whenever a democrat
wants the place. Republican old
soldiers may now retire into obscurity,
no matter what was their patriotism
or service or suffering. Greenville In
dependent. Gen. Rosecrans has an article in fhe
December North American Review, en
titled. "The Mistakes of Grant," in
which he makes an attuck on the Old
Commander for statements in th
article by the latter on "The Battle of
Chattanooga," in the November (Jen
ttiry. But whatever Rosecrans may
Fay, he cannot change the facts of
history. Grant defeated Bragg, raised
the confederate siege of Chattanooga,
and lifted from the country an intoler
able weight of anxiety, and all of this

It Is strange to hear Roserrann' at

A lare poitiou of our paper U tak
en up with the Pro&idei:t' Mesge. It
U lung enough for every purpose, and
treats of the different subjects from
everything elae but a democratlo
stand-point. If the government Is
conducted in accordance with the
same, we shall not complain, but as
the President's actions heretofore have
not been in accord with his message,
and as his message is not in harmony
with the principles of his party, we
expect to see but little good accom

- Reports concerning the winter wheat
so fur received are as follows: Illinois
has a lessened acreage, but the pros
pects are regarded as the best for sever
al years. Michigan has sown the usual
breadth, and in the main has a thrifty
crop. Indiana reports a large acreage
and generally excellent condition, al
though the fly has done some damage.
Kansas has a great acreage in wheat.
and pronounces the chance better than
ot the sume time last year. In Nebras
ka, with about the same acreage, the
plant looks well, but does not gain in
favor. From the limited area in Ohio
the crop is reported in better condition
than usual. Toledo Blade.
The Otsego Independent says : 'While
thirty ur forty-prliillti,niete were jm
rading the streets of Detroit last week,
people on the sidewalks threw stones
and ancient eggs at them, and we'll
bet a cent thofe persons who threw
the stones and ancient eggs were all re
publicans ' That's right, never over
size your pile when betting. Republi
cans are not in the habit. of engaging
in this kind of work, and it smacks
pretty strongly of a habit the democra
cy had in days gone by when it requir
ed considerable courage to differ with
them, as rotten eggs and stones were
their most convincing arguments.
It might have been republicans as the
assailants stood on the sidewalk. If
it had been those of like proclivities as
the editor of the Independent, they
would have taken their favorite posi
tion in the gutter.
For nearly two months the Detroit
Tribune has been under Its present
management, we have merely noticed
the change in our columns. Why?
Because an acquaintance with the
Messrs. Nimmocks from their boyhood
led us to believe, what has proved to
be a fact, that the Tribune in their
hands would be its own best advertis
er. As the Post under Mr. Stlckney
was a wondrous improvement over its
former management, so now the Tri
bune has taken a monstrous stride to
the front. Republican to the last line,
fearless and jut throughout, fresh
news in nvery paragraph, and typo
graphlcally almost perfect. It is the de
sideratum long wished for by the par
ty whose principles it upholds, and we
be like the present, unparalleled In the
history of Michigan journalism.
The Detroit Journal says: "The Lan
sing Republican enjoys the proud dis
tinction of being the only newrP"
In MW(r inat referred to the lute
Vice President Hendricks as a copper
head." He was a copperhead and one
of the worst type on account of the in
fluence he exerted. If he had lived up
to his principles and went into the con
federate army, he would have been en
titled to more credit, as it would have
shown that he had courage to uphold
his convictions. If It had not been foi
such as him the war would have been
over months sooner and many lives
and much treasure would have been
saved to the country, for it is well
known thnt it required nearly as many
men to protect our homes from "but
ternuts" and "copperheads" as we had
in the field fighting the enemy. The
grave covers many faults in our esti
mation, but treason and cowardice are
excepted.
The supreme court of Ohio has done
jnst what it was expected to do. It
has decided that the confessedly, forg
ed returns made to the board of can
vassers In Cincinnati must be corrected
by that board, overruling the decision
of the circuit, court, which held that
returns carrying the evidence of forg
ery on their face should be thrown
out. The effect of this decision is to
give certificates of the election to the
democratic delegation from Cincinna
ti In the legislature, and reduces the
republican majority in that body In
joint ballot to the narrowest margin.
So gross an outrage upon en honest
ballot has never before been sanction
ed in this country by any court of last
resort. And it wos only made possible
by holding upon the bench; in defense
of law, one judge, Atherton, who was
defeated in t lie last election by a ma
jority of i'3,000. Had the laws been
obeyed, the returns In his case would
have been canvassed, or could have
been, days ago, and u certificate issued
to his successor, he being appointed on
ly to fill a vacancy, which vacancy will
cense to exist as soon as it pleases the
democratic manipulators who have
the whole swindle in charge to canvass
the returns and declare the result. It
hn not pleased them to do so yet, for.
manifest reasons, and Athet-tou 1
meantime making way for his party as
rapidly as his declining sun will allow
It te one of the most impudent and out
rageous proceedings that haj ever dis
graced Ohio jurisprudence, and that is
saying a good deal.
We withhold further comment until
we can see the decision promulgated
under such circumstances and with
such disgraceful surroundings. Det.
Tiibiim.
From 11 dir ctlons toiuo Imlicutious
of htalthy activity and a satisfactory
improvement in all brunches of general
tra-ie. The movement of merchandise
U reported of fair volume and increased
confidence among dealers. The sharp
changH to winter will probably largely
increase the volume of sales in season
able goods. The aggregate salts of
dry goods are reported to exceed in a
slight degree those of 18SL The in
creased thinness in the rates of interest
show that the amount of idle capital
Is considerably reduced, it having
been drawn off into the channel of
trade. The railroads show largely In
creased earnings. Lumber interests
keep well up with the general Improve
ment, and the outlook is hopeful and
promising. D. V. Tribune.
Today the republican partv simply
insists that every citizen of every state
shall have the right to cast his ballot
according to the dictates of his own
judgment and his own Interests with
out fear, compulsion, restraint or mo
lestation, and shall have that ballot
correctly counted. That is and always
has been an article of republican faith,
and today is one of the unfulfilled
pledges of the partv-unfultillfd because
of tho hostility of the bourbon J of the
solid south toward it. Because the
republican party thus insists, the old
abominal lie of sectionalism is again
raised and howled and reiterated
through the land to the bewilderment
and deception of many good citizens.

This "is the most unkindest cut ot
all." President Cleveland must have
failed to consult the Evening News
concerning his message, or worso than
that, failed to embody therein the
ideas of Scripts. The message does
not suit the theory of the News and
poor Cleveland is thoroughly pommel
ed in every issue, and among other vile
epithets applied, is even called a "re
publican." Hear him ye bourbons,
and weep with him as he says: "But
how does Cleveland stand en this sub
ject. (Free trade). We quoted all he
had to say yesterday. There is no see
sawing in his phrases from protection
to free trade. He opens with protec
tion, continues in it and closes with it.
He expressly confines reduction of tax
ation to revenue which the govern
ment receives, but interposes his veto
in advance against any reduction of
revenue which the favored monopo
lists receive. He says not a word
about cheapening ruw material by
putting on the free list those which
produce no revenue. He is willing
that the income of the government
shall be cutoff, but he.lnsfsts that the
protected manufacturer shall cut hi
pound of llesh out of the popular
body. Thus
a careful examination of tlie message
tal questions of the day, which excite
popular attention and which formed
the issues of the last campaign, has an
tagonized his own party, and now
stands shoulder to shoulder '! Lc
republicans."
Scripp's complaint Is almost equal to
Nasby's In his tirade against education
at the X road, when he said "they
thought a little education would help
them and one of their number was
taught to read , but as soon as he
learned that the d d fool went and
voted the republican ticket."
In the memoirs of Adm Black, just
published by his sons in Edinbnrg, is
Mated an Incident which occurred in
Adam's youth, and illustrates the se
vere sort of orthodoxy that then pre
vailed among the Kvangelicals of Scot
land: "On one sacrament Sabbath
morning, the wife of the Rev. John
Colquhoun, of Leith, being desirous
to have him nicely rigged out for the
occasion, had his coat well brushed,
his shirt white as snow, hi bands ban?
ing handsomely on hi? breast; when
she surveyed her gudvman she was so
delighted with hi comely appearance,
that she suddenly took him round the
neck and kissed him. The Rev. John,
however, was so offended by this car
nal proceeding that he debarred her
from the sacrament that day." .
