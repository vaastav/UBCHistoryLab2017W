THE MASSACRES IN CHINA.
The mnssiieru of Iiic French' nnd liussi.in
residents of Tien Tsin, under circiunstano s of
great barbarity, were suppwsi d by siunc lo have
been premeditated, am', lo indicutc a purpose
among the populate tu exleiminatu foreigners

complicity by the local authorities whb .lie

obligations. Unfortunately, the news of Ih'e

would appear that the popular mind became

and, further, should skch an extreme iiieasure

of any laws whereby) the vessels of the Do

THE DEPARTMENTS.
The condition of Ihe archives nl thu Depart
ment of State culls for Ihe early nellon Of Con
gress. The building now rented by Unit de
partment is a hail stuic-tnrc, at au inconvenient
distance from the Executive Mansion and from
the other departments. It is ill-adapted to the
purpose for which it ia nsed, has not capacity
to accommodate the archives, nnd ii not tiro
proof. Its r'tiiotc situation, Its slender con
struction, nnd tlio absence of a supply of waler
in tbu neighborhood, leaves but little hopo oi
salely for either the building or Its contents in
case of Hie accident of n fire. Its destruction
would involve the loss of the rolls containing
tho origin acts nnd resol.nions of Comrrcss. of
the historic; records of the revolution nnd of
the confederation, of the whole scries of dipli -malic
.v consular archives since tho adoption of
the Constitution, nnd of the many other valua
ble records nnd papers, led with the depart
ment w hen it was Ihu priucipnl depository of
the government archives. I recommend nn
appropriation for tho construction of u build
ing for the department of Slate.
I recommend lo your reconsideration the
propriety of transferring to the Department of
Die Interior, to which they seem more appro
priately to belong, all powers and duties iu re
lation to tho Territories with which Iho De
partment of State is now charged by law or
usage, and from the Interior IVpiirtment to
tliu War Department thu Pension Hureait so
far us it regulates the payment of soldiers'
pensions. I would further recommend that
Ihe payment of naval pensions be Iransfei'red
lo one of tlio Bureaus of the Ji'avy Department.

REVENUE REFORM.
The tax collected firom the people his ljcen
reduced more than eighty million dollars-per
annum. By sleiiltticss in our present course
there is no reason, why, In a few short years,
the natinnat tax garden r may not disappear
from the door of llie citizen almost entirely.
With the revenue stamp dispensed by post

may lie raised nfler u few year of pcicu and
consequent reduction of indebtedness to lullill

THE NAVY.
The expenses uf tho Navy' Cor Ihe whole of

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
I rcspcctlully call your nltcntroti to one
abusu long standing, which I would like to see
renu died by Congress. Il Is it reform in thu
civil service of (he Country. I would have it
go beyond the mere fixing of the tenure of
office of clerks and employees wlio do not re
quire "Iho advice nnd consent of tho Senate"
to make their appointments complete. I would
have it govern not the tenure but tho manner
of making nil appointments.. Thero is no
duty w hich so much embarrasses tho Execu
tive ami bends of Departments as Hint of up-'
poinlments, nor is there any such nrduims and
thankless labor itnr used on Senators and
lieptcseutalivcs as Unit of finding places for
constituents. The present system does not so
cure llie best men and often not even tit men
for public place. The. elevation and ptl
rlllcaii in of tho civil service of the government
win no niiiieu with approval liy tlie whole
people of the United States.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
The reform iu tltu tnunagaiucdit of Indian
affairs has received Ihe special nt ten-lion of Hie
administration from its inauguruiion to the
present el ,y. The experiment of making it a
mission.' ry work was tried with a tvx ugenclcs
given lo the denomination of Friends, and has
been found to work most advuntugeously. All
agencies and superinleivli'iicies not so disposed
were given lo officers of the. army. The act
of Congress regulating the iiruty renders army
officers inelligible for eivil positions. Indian
agencies being ciyil offices, I determined lo
giyc all the agencies to such religious, denom
inations as had heretofore established mission
nries among the Indians, and perhaps lo some
other denominations, who would undertake
tlio work, au tho snme terms ; that is, as n
ttvlssionary work. The societies selected aro
allowed lo name their ow n agents, subject lo
the approval of the Executive', and are expect
ed to watch over Iheni nnd aid them as mis
sionaries to civilizeandchrislianize the Indian,
and to Iruin him In the art of peace. The gov
ernment w atches over the olllcial ncls of these
agents, and requires of them as strict an ac
countability ns if they wero appointed In anv
olhcr manner. I entertain the confident hopo
that tho policy now pursued will, in s few
years, bring nil liidhins upon reservations,
where Ikcy will live in houses, have school
houses and churches, w ill be pursuing peace

PUBLIC DOMAIN.
During the last fiscal year, 800,54 t,U0Oiacrcs of
public land were disposed of. Of this 8(l!l,tW 1,0(1
acres wero taken under homestead law, and
s:ir,U5l,5HI acres sold for cash. The remainder
was located with military warrant, collego or
Indian script, or applied in s ilisfaclion of.
grants to railroads or other public uscs.
Tne 'entries under the homestead law during
the last ve.ur covered OiiljS.-t,,. ncres more Hum
those during the picceding year. Surveys huvo
been pushed lo tho full extent Uie iiicnnsap
plicitble to the purpose. The quantity of hwA.
In market will amply supply the present de
mand. Tlio claim of tUu settlers uuder the
homestead or pre-emption laws, is not, howev
er, limited to lands subject to sale - at, private
entry. Any unappropriated sin v.eyed public
bind may, to a limited extent bo ncquucel un
der llie tormci: laws, if the parly en tided to en
ter them will comply wilh the requirements
they prescribe in regard to tUu residence and
Cultivation. The actual settler's preference of
right ol purchase is oten broader nud extends,
to Iho lands which were unsurvvyed at the
lime of his settlement. His rigid was formerly
conlied within much narrower limit.-,, and. lit
one period of our history was conferred only
by special statutes. TUey wero enuclcd from
time to liiuu to legalize w hat was then regard
ed us nn unauthorised intrusion upon the na
tional domain. . Thu opinion, that the pufeik
lands 'should be regarded chiefly us a source of
revenue, is no longer maintained. Tho rapid
settlement and successf ul cultivation of them
ia now justly considered of more Importance
Uv our well being than is the fund, which Ihe
sale of Iheni w ould produce. The remarkable
grow th and prosperity of our new: ruics and
territories attest the wisdom of tho legislation
wliicn Invites Ihu tiller of the soil to s cure a
permanent homo ou terms within Ihe reach of
all. The pionee r who incurs Iho clangers and
privations of u frontier life, and thus aids in
laying the foundation of new commonwealths
renders a signal service to the country, and is
entitled to its speciuffavor and protection.-
The laws secure Ihut object anil largely pru
mote Ihe general welfare. They should,, there
fore, be cherished us a p, riuiinenl tvnluruof our
laud system.' Uooil UlUIi requires u to give
full effect to existing grants. The time honored
and beneficent policy of selling apart certain
sections of public laud lor educational purpos
es, in the new states, iIocil.l be continued. -When
ample provision shall have been made
tcr these objects, I submit ns a question, worthy
of serious consideration, whether the residue
of the public lands should not be wholly dis
posed of under the provisions of Ihu homestead
ami pre-emption laws. In Addition to Owe
swamp and overflowed lands granted lu the
states in which I hey uru situated, iho lands ta
ken under tlio Agricultural and College acts,
and for internal improvement purposes tinder
tho net of September, '41, and the acts supple
mental thereto, there had been cunveyed up U
the close of tho lust fiscal year, by patent or
other equivalent evklenuo u title to slates nnd
corporations a,78!l,0L'5,7t8,100 ac'a for railways,
canals nnd wagon roads. It is etliuiated that
an additional quantity of 1 7-1,7 W.lL'a ncres is
slid duo under grants for .like purposes. The
policy of thus aiding tho slates in building
works of internal Improvement was. inaugurat
ed njre than forty yeurs ngo In Ihe grants to
Indiana and Illinois, to aid Ihose states lu o
pening canals to connect thu waters of thu Wa
bash wilh those of Ijike trie, aud tho waters
of the Illinois with those of Lake Mlenkfan. It
was followed with some modifications' in the
grant to Illinois, of alternate sections of public
hunts wiUiiu eerluin limit of Iho Illinois. Cen
tral Hailway. Fourtcvivla,tea and sundry cos
' porations liavo received similar subsidies in
connection wilh railways completed or iu pro
cess. Aa the reserved sections are rated at
double minimum value, tho snlu of them at lli
enhanced price, has thus in many instances in
demnified the treasury for -the granted hinds.
The construction ot some of those thorough
fare ha uncloubMdly given a vigorous Impe
tus to the developmyut of our resourceg.'und
tho settlement of UiO piuru .'distant portion of
tlic country. ' It may, however, well be insist
ed that much of our legislation lit. this regard,
has 1een charauteriiVcl by iudi'riniiwitj and
profuse liberality. Tlm U- S. .should mat loan
l heir credit to ail of any iiti Iprit quilrruvkcu
by sin tea or -corporations, nor grant lands in
any instance, unless tho projected work is of
acknowledged national iiupqrtuuce . I nm
