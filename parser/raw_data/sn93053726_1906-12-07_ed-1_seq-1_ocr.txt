POLICE DOUBT THE STORY
Dayton, 0., Dee 7. "Yes, I did It
I am the murderer of Dona Gil
man."
Coolly and without the slightest
sign of emotion or remorse, ' David
Curtis made the above confession to
County Detective McBrlde, Coroner
luine, Detective Coleman of the Pin-
kerton agency, and Prosecuting At
torney Nevin, in the office pf the lat
ter tnis morning.
The confession was made without
the sweating process and was com
plete in every detail, satisf vine the
officers that there can be no doubt
but that the perpetrator of the most
fiendish crime in the history of Mont-
gomery county has been placed with
in the grasp of justice. .'
The statement of Curtis as given
to the authorities this morning, was
as follows: ,-
"On the evening of November 20
I ate supper In the Cadillac restau
rant on Fifth street, linear Brown.
Just as I came out I saw Dona Gil
man waiting for her car, and I board
ed the west bound Fifth street car.
At National and Groveland avenues
I alighted. Shortly after the car had
started up the hill, and as she took
the west side of the street, I followed
uj5 the hill on the east side. I then
committed the assault." ,
Curtis Is 27 years old and has
earned a precarious living selling
newspapers, etc. He is regarded as
half-witted and at times labored un
der delusions that he was a great de
tective. Many believe his story - Is
partly the result of his own 'disor
dered imagination and that he really
had no connection with the crime.

TARIFF MEASURE IS LOST
Members of Congress Awakening to the
Fact That the President Wants
No Change.
INHERITANCE AND INCOME
Washington, D. C, December 7.
Members of congress bave just a wid
ened tb the fact that the president's
message plainly proposes that ' the
subjects of an inheritance tax and In
come tax, both of which, if enacted In
to law, would produce large reven
ues, be considered wben the question
comes up as to revising . the tariff.
and that the president leaves high In
the air the matter of tariff revision
In his discussion of the Inheritance
and Income tax ideas the president
says these should be considered when
the revenues of the government are
up for revision.
Therefore, when will the tariff be
revised and when will the inheritance
and income tax questions come be
fore congress In such an earnest way
as to presage a genuine attempt to
do something?
Evidently tne president left tne
whole thing to crystallze; to get the
opinions of tbe people so that he
would know when to proceed witu
his characteristic vigor. According to
the president s views there will be no
Inheritance and income tax laws
until the tariff is formally revised.
One could not well be taken up with
out the other.
. Logically, this Is a correct attitude,
republicans assert although the lend
ers of the party differ as to the de
tails. It is admitted that if Income
and Inheritance tax laws are put up
on the books they will produce a
large revenue to the government,
which is already burdened with mon
ey, the estimates for the surplus fur
this fiscal year running as high as
$50,000,OUO. The government has so
much money on hand that it has mil
lions of dollars on deposit with na
tional banks and will be able at the
close of the year to pay off $11(1,000,
000 of maturing 4 per cent bonds. Ev
en then It will bave 'on deposit near
ly $100,000,000 with national banks
that could be drawn upon in case of
need.
With so much money on band it
would not be business policy to In
crease the revenues to a large extent.
When the rich men are plucked for
some portion of their wealth as a con
tribution to taxes some other source
of taxation can be reduced. Will the
policy of the president be to advocate
a lowering of excessive duties on ar
ticles of Import, especially whero this
lowering 'would result In less duties
to the government? Tariff experts
claim that when customs duties are
lowered the result Is a large Increase
in exports and more revenue for the
government but the president proba
bly has In mind schedules of the tar
iff on which the duties could be
abolished altogether and goodi ad
mitted free. ,
At any rate the passage of laws re
quiring wealth to pay a goodly pro
portion of taxation means that tlio
government must get rid of some of
Its revenues. How to do It will be
the problem for the party In power.
Massachusetts republicans, some or
those from Indiana and the western
states are demanding an extra ses
sion for tariff revision. With this
would come Inheritance ami income
laws, In all probability. If there Is no
extra session the tariff question
would go to the next regular session.
which would fall on the eve or tne
presidents! election of MOS. No re
publican leader would stand for this
not even the president.
In the light of this the conclusion
la reached that the tariff will have to
be revised In extra session next
spring snd summer or the revision
will have to go over until the con
gress following the election of a pres
ident. What does the president real
ly want? Is be adrlotly movinj to
make the three questions tariff re
vision Inheritance tax Income tax
the Issues for 1!)08 whether he Is or
Is not a candidate to succeed him
self? 8creral hundred congression
al leaders believe that Is bis plan.
