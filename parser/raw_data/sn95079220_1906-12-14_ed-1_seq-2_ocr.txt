lt (? estimated tliat every square mile
of the ocean has a population of
120,000,000 fish. And yet "they say"
that our food fishes are pradually be
toming cxtinct. This may be true in
eertain locnlities, where man'a advent
has made it obnoxious to some timid
species, but the time will never come
when the earth will be peopled suffici
ently to cause an appreciable decrease
faa lishe.-s. Nature now has to destroy
or prevent the birth of myriads in order
to keep the supply to the lirait she has
provided sustenance for, and man's in
roada are "not as a drop in thebucket"
to the whole.?Virginia Citizen.
And the alert Norfolk Ltuumark
asUs "How about oysterB?" The
Btatement will not hoid good witb
respect to the bivalve, we con
fcas, chiefly for the reason that
tbe oyster is eedentary in the ex
treme. Where he makea bis bed
be muat lie until man, or some
other animal, disturbs him. When
discoTered, he Ins no show for his
life. Not even the infant ones are
Becure from some raarauders' hands,
nor are the shells on wh'ch he loves
to ir.ake his bed. For this reason,
aod others, he must be protected by
law. Fish have a chance to get away,
especially the little ones, as a rule.
Auother great difference is that the
boundlesa ocean is an incubator,
tield and stalking ground for tishes.
Some neyer becomecommon to man's
vision. The edible oyster's habitat
is exceedingly restricttd. Exccpt in
a few olaces, like rare portions of the
Chesapvake Bay eectioo, the oyster
exists oi'ly in shallow water. It may
bs a mrpriae to many to learn that
o:i our ocean side tbe oyster is not
found at ? depth of ten feet and
seldoni at half that. The Bpawn
ebb8 and llows with the tide, and
seaei. are propagated chiefly
above tbe lov Udftl mark. The best
bedij ibere are tho^e that ebb dry,
a"d ; stock is gathered
with the Oogen or small rakea.

uatural growth oyster, as Virginians
l.ave 1. araed by dear experience, if
not rigidlj protected by law.

Until the State adopts some method

FISH AND OYSTER NOTES.
State Board orr""*heries meet yester
day and today rolk.
This is a aeaaon .?f the year when
we have an epidemic of "shanghai"
cases. The crop this year is about the
average. The "harrowing stories,"
of suffering, may in some cases be true,
but we fear that often they are the in
vention of some enterprising reporter's
brain.-The Oysterman.
The scarcity of labor in Maryland
and other packing houses is caused
principally by the demands of the
4 'dredgers'' in the Chesapeake Bay. The
captains have hired every availabie
colored man, as they are unable to get
white crews. The tramp element has
not turned up this season. A number
of idle boats are in the different ports,
all fitted up and licensed but no crews.
Stock will soon be aa scarce as before
the dredging commensed.
Governor Warfield, reports a talk
with Commander T. C. B. Howard, of
tho State fishery force of Maryland,
regarding the oyster situation. Cap?
tain Howard told him that never before
has he seen nor heard of so many seed
oysters and small bivalves as are scat
tered about various sections of Chesa?
peake Bay this season. In view of
this, he said next year there should be
a great abundance of oysters. Captain
Howard says the Potomac river bottoms
are thick with seed oysters. While the
tongers are having only a moderately
good season. Owing to enforcement of
the cull law large oysters are being
caught in scattered quantities.
N. N. MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.
ln Scssion at Heathsville?A Great
Succc s?Banquet in Evening.
Tliursday, December 6, 1900, m arly
all Of the nhyskians of the Northtrn
Neck met in the third semi-annual
aaaaaOl since organizting, at Heaths?
ville. With quite a full attendance the
Association met in thecourthouse, where
the regular order of business was taken
up. Prof. J. Mason Hundley, of the
University of Maryland, Baltimore, was
present and gave a very instruotive
and bcneficial address on a subject that
is so often overlooked by physicians,
impressing upon them the importance
of early recognition of, and operation
for, certain cancerous conditions which
would result in a complete eure of the
disease, while If neglected would shortly
prove fatal. A vote of thankswas ten
dered him for his address and he was
elected honorary member of the As?
sociation.
A very instructive and up-to-date
paper was read by Dr. Cockrell and ad
dresses of great importance made by
Drs. Eubank and Fisher on subjects
assigned them by the Association.
Other members of the Association dis
cussed these subjects and reported cases
of great interest. These papers and
addresses accomplished one of the ob
jects of Uie Association.
The Constitution says, "the objects of
this Association shall be the promotion
of the science and art of medicine and
the cultivation of social intercourse
among the members of the profession."
While it might appear that the phy?
sicians alone are reaping the benefitsof
the objects of this Association the
patients are indirectly doing so, becausc
through these addresses the physician
becomes more capable of treating dis
eases more effectually which might
occur among his patients.
While the Northern Neck Medical
Association is only one and a half years
old it has grown numerically almost to
its greatest possibility, having now on
roll twenty-six out of thirty active phy?
sicians in thelower Northern Neck. It
has begun to actract attention from
without the Northern Neck as was
shown by the presence of Prof. Hundley,
and has gotten down to an effectual
working basis, andby the united efforts
of each member it is hopedand believed
that the Northern Neck Medical Asso?
ciation will soon be one of the leading
local associations in the State. The
members of the Association are as
follows:
J. W. Tankard, president; H. W.
Harding, vice-president; F. W. Lewis,
2nd vice-president; M. M. Walker, 3rd
vice-president; R. O. Lyell, secretary;
W. N. Chinn, treasurer; A. C. Fisher,
librarian; R. E. Booker, A. N. Brent,

S. E. Weymouth.
In the evening a banquet was given
the Assoeiation by the Northumberland
members at Nelms Hotel where all the
delicaeies that the season could afford
were served in style.
Dr. R. E. Booker was Toast-Master.
An address of welcome was made by
Dr. J. W. Tankard. The following
toasts were responded to by the follow?
ing gentlemen:
"Relation of The Public and the
Physician,"HughSmith; "The Country
Doctor," A. C. Fisher; "The Relation
of the Trained Nurse to the Physician,''
J. H. Hare.
The next session will be held at the
Hague the fourth Thursday in May, 1907.
