%gS There appears to be no doubt that
Miss{ Cleveland wrote that part of the
president's message regarding the Mor
mons. People who have been hunting I
np her writings find a striking similarity
in style, and there, is nothing the presi
dent ever wrote that resembles it in the
least degree. If it is .true that she con
tributed this portion, it is the first time
in history'that a woman ever famished
a portion of the president's message.
The administration, has decided that
the Clerks oannot be paid their salaries
until the last of the month, instead of
the day before Christmas, as formerly,
the reason alleged being that if any of
the clerks should happen to die, or any
other- contingency arise under whioh
they should not be entitled to their
salaries the disbursing clerks would be I
held (responsible, and would have to
restore this money to the treasury. As I
a great many of the clerks live from I
baud to month this deoision will make a
va-y blue Christmas in many homes.

Toe Futnams have just published' a
valuable contribution to what may be
called the personal history of the war
by Congressman Eelley, who gives an
aoooant of his relations with Lincoln
and Stanton and throws much light
upon the events of X861 and 1862, when
he was one of the most intimate and
mot trusted advisers of the president
and sedretary of war. Without viola-,,
ting oonfldenoe Mr. Kelley speaks, hel
says, in defense of bis silent friend to
vindicate the trnthof history and
in justice to the illastrions dead.
The book is oalled oat by
the publication of General McClellan
and biB friends, who, as all who have
kept paoe with the publication of war
reminiscences know, have endeavored to
charge Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Stanton
with the responsibility of the failure of
the early attempt to put down the re
bellion. It is a little book of ninety
pages, written in Mr. Kelley's style,
direct, forcible and oonoise and is in
terlarded with personal reminiscences,
narratives of interviews with Mr. Lin
coln and Mr. Stanton at the time when
th9 horizon was very dark. X'
Representative Weaver, of Iowa, will

same. The secretary is required to
make annual reports showing the
general oondition of labor throughout

laborers are suffering, and whether such
are the result directly or indirectly of
legislation, or from the lack of it, and
giving a statement of all labor strikes,
riots,- disturbances Betting forth
dearly the exact claims of both parties

SENATE.)
Washington, Use. 15—The ohsir laid
before the senate a letter from the secre
tary of war with the report of the chiel
of ordinance, showing the tests of iron
and steel during the last fiscal year aleo
a letter from the secretary, transmitting,
iu compliance with a recent resolution
of the senate, the report of Capt. Bixbee,
United States engineer, on sea oost for
tifioations in Europe.
Mr. Edmunds, from the committee on
judiciary, reported favorably on the bill
to relieve Gon. Alexander, of Georgia, of
political disabilities. He asked an im
mediate consideration of the bill.
Mr. Edmunds introduced a bill grant
ing a pension to Mre. Julia Grant, and
another bill granting her the franking
privilege. Mr. Edmunds says the bills
are precisely in form as those
adopted in similar cases heretofore.
Ths bill was then read three times and
The senate took up the Hoar bill to
provide for a presidential succession,
and Mr. Hoar addressed the senate on it.
.On the conclusion of Mr. Hoar's re'
markB on the presidential succession

Poor Old Mexico.
St. Louis, Deo. 15—A speoial from
Monterey, Mexico, to the Globe-Demo
I crat, says everything was quiet in that
city yesterday to all outward appear
anoes, but there is an undercurrent of
public displeasure whioh bodes no good
to the military government, that may
break out any minute. The oool treat
ment extended to Manuel Rodriguez at
the bands of Military Qovernor General
Reyes, causes dissatisfaction and bitter
ness among the whole independent
party. All outlets to the oity are closely
watched by military spies, as not only
Sepulveds, but his officers are out on
parole.
Another dispatch from New Laredo
says the absence of Major Gregory,
strong ana active Gonzales partisan,
from the eleotion, was greatly wondered
at and oommented on. It turned out
to-day that he was put in. the soldiers'
guard house all day by order of the fed
eral commander and this morning was
ordered to the city of Mexico. The un
ceremonious manner in whioh the pres
ent administration moves troublesome
personages from a position in whioh
they may use negative influence, is con
siderable oommented on.
A Terrible Hallway Accident.
Atlanta, Ga., Deo. 15—One of the most
terrible railroad aooidents ever known in

MILITIA CONVENTION.
The fourth annual convention of the
National Guard Association of the
United States met this afternoon. The
association consists of five delegates
from the militia of each of the states
and eighteen were represented at the
meeting. President General W. Win
gate, of New York, oalled the meeting to
order. He said in his opening address
that the object of the association had
been thwarted in part by objections that
it was their intention to deprive the
states of their authority over the mil
itia then on the other hand, that
it was their desire to make money out of
the treasury of the general government
but the greatest obstacle they had to
encounter was the apathy among the
people, the militia and in congress in
regard to the entire question, whiqh tLe
association hod at heart. He thought
now the situation was more favorable
and that the bills before congress would
receive favorable consideration. Gen.
Taylor was elected reoordmg secretary
in place of General Alexander, of Des
At Mr. Morrison's suggestion the read
ing of the report itBelf was dispensed
with and a general 4ebate opened by
him with a short explanation of the pro
posed revision. There was nothing new,
he said, in hiB proposition. He merely
grouped euoh of the? propositions as had
been submitted to the house from time to-day: Horatio N. Cronkite, Clinton,
Moines, Iowa, who was nnable to attend.
Col. Chas. E. Bridge, of New York, was
eleoted corresponding secretary.

The Silver Problem.
Washington, Dec. 12—livery day in
creases the belief that the fight over the
silver question is going to be a very hot
one. Just what steps the silver people
will take in answer to the president's
statement of views, they have not deci
ded. They are seriously discussing the
queHtion, however, and contemplate is
uuiug some sort ot a manifesto iu re
sponse. The president's utteranoe on
the silver question pleases people ol
great cities, especially those of the east,
but seems to be fur from pleasing to the
masses, especially iu the west and south
Tho representatives from districts out
side the larger cities are generally
tound, especially in the west und
south, to favor the silver dollar.
Some of the most conservative of them
would be willing to consent to temporary
suspension ot coinage, but there will be
a very strong part that will object even to
this. The only hope seems to be in a
compromise measure, but whether oDy
compromise can be agreed upon is ser
iously doubted. One plan that has been
suggested is to make silver, either in
coiu or bullion, or both, a basis for no
cional bank ourrenoy, substituting it for
the government bonds as they are taken
up, It is doubtful, however, if this plan
would prove at all satisfactory to the
banking interests, for it is understood
that the chief value of the present sys-1
tem lies in the foot that the bankers get I
interest on their bonds deposited to
secure circulation itself. The fight over I 99x©$i.OXC.
