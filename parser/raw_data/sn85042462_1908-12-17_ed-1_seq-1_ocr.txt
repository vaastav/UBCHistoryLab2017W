GEORGE FREETH
DEATH OF ANNIS
TOLD IN DETAIL
EYEWITNESS DESCRIBES THE
SLAYING BY HAINS
Sensation 's Caused by Discovery of
Fact That Boatman Who Saw
Tragedy Has Strangely
Disappeared
FLUSHING, L. 1., Dec. IB.—The story
of the. slaying of William B. Annls as
he sat In his catboat and was riddled
with bullets was made today part of
the record in the Jrial of Thornto^i J.
Mains, a magazine writer, charged with
Doing a principal with his brother, Cap
tain* Peter C. Hains, Jr., in the murder
of Annis last summer.
Tracing the movements of the prin
cipals at the Bayslde Yacht club trag
edy with the aW of miniature iron
figures and models of the float and the
catboat, Page D. Andrews, a Yacht
club member, showed under examina
tion how the army captain, standing on
the float's edge, held aloft the obscur
ing boom and sail of Annis' boat arfd
shot the; publisher as he sat at the
tiller.
There was surprise when it was
learned thai John Tonning, a Swedish
boatman, who saw (he tragedy, could
tiol be located.
District Attorney Darrin said he
thought Tonning Was«l» Sweden, but
that nctthlng had been heard, from him
since last September.
Important Witness
"He was an Important witness for
us." said Lawyer Mclntyre, "for
through him we would liave shown that
he struck Capt.*Hains after the shoot
ing with a boat hook or oar and that
(o protect Ills brother, Thornton Hains
dr. w his n volver."
The cross-examination of Andrews
consumed the major portion of the af
ternoon and Lawyer Mclntyre sought
to develop that Thornton Halnes ljad
said after the shooting that he had tried
to dissuade ('apt. Hatfles from his act,
and that lie would hold him until the
officers came.
Special Prosecutor White declared
evidence would be brought out to show
that Thornton Hains had full knowl
edge of his brother's Intention In kill
Annls and virtually led the way to the
yacht olub and directed the search for
the publisher.
Mr. Whito declared Thornton Hains
pointed liis revolver at Mrs. Annis and
prevented her from going to the aid of
her wounded husband.

[Special to The Herald. 1
VENICE), Dec. IC—This city was the;
scene today of a series of extraor
dinarily heroic rescues effected by
('apt. George Freeth, in charge of the
United States volunteer lifesavlng crew,
assisted by the crew itself, eleven men
in all being rescued.
The sudden appearance of a heavy
northwester caught a number of fisher
men in small boats unAwfrres and sent
them scurrying for the shore, too late,
however, to make a safe landing.
The power house siren summoned the
United States volunteer llfesaving crew
to the scene, and Capt. George Freeth
made a spectacular dive from the
wharf. Swimming to the first of the
boa is, which was In imminent, danger
of being dashed upon the rocks of I he
breakwater, he successfully piloted the
craft, which contained two Japanese
fishermen, around the pier to a safe
landing.
The work of thlß intrepid lifesaver
was marvelous, and too much cannot
be said in praise of the manner in
which he went into the water time and
again to rescue the endangered fisher
men.
Scarcely had a safe landing been ef
fected by the first boat when another
boat containing two Russians, Nick
Agelzoff and William DesoMW.was
driven rapidly toward the Center street
pier and swamped.
Freeth immediately plunged into the
breakers from the Windward break
water and attempted to swim to the
aid of the imperiled men, a distance of
a tfUarter of a' mile. When he had cov
ered about half of the distance he was
overtaken i>y a third boat containing
two more Japanese fishermen. He suc
ceeded iri getting on board, and, by a
trick known only to himself, piloted the
craft through the surf at railroad spec 1
and made a safe landing on the beach.
Meanwhile the current had carried
thh two Italians within reach of ropes
held by the llfesaverf on the Center
sireet pier and they were pulled to
safety, one being .somewhat injured by
coming in contact. With wreckage.
Freeth was taken to his quarters and
members of the ornv had begun to rub
him down after his -strenuous work in
the water when the siren tisjaiw gave

Criticisms
[Special to The Herald. 1
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. 16.—
Through the efforts of Senator
Aldrich, who has been decidedly
aeiivo In resenting the president's re
cent utterances regarding congress, the
senate today decided to investigate the
portion of the annual message of the
president which criticises the action of
congress In prohibiting the detail of se
cret service men to duty in other de
partments.
The resolution directing the Inquiry
has been In contemplation ever since
the message was received Tuesday of
last week, but there had been some
difficulty in arriving at the terms In
which ii should be couched and In
agreeing upon the proper person in
troducing it.
It was decided at last Senator Aid
rich should stand sponsor for the meas
ure, and today, after Senator Lodge had
completed his speech on the Browns
ville affair, the Khode Island senator
took the floor and presented a resolu
tion authorizing the inquiry.
Senator Culberson, the; caucus leader
of the Democrats. Immediately sent up
a substitute which was somewhat more
specific.
Measures Referred
Both measures were referred prompt
ly to the committee on contingent ex

tion with the recommendation that it
pass. '
Senator Culberson made prompt ob
jection and it looked for a time as If
the consideration of the subject would
be postponed until tomorrow.
Finally the Democrats made it known
that they would Interpose no objection
to the Immediate consideration of the
Aldrich resolution If the portion of the
Culberson substitute directing the com
mittee on appropriations' to advise the
senate specifically as to the course of
action i# should take with reference
to the message could be incorporated
in it. . . , '
The resolution was again referred to

dent Smashed by Mobs—Rule of
Bellicose Ruler Appears
at an End
[Special to The HeraM.]
CARACAS, Dec. 15 (via Willemstadt,
Dec. 16). —The people have arisen
against Castro. An infuriated mob,
unhindered by the police, swept
through the city, wrecking the prop
erty of his henchmen and his closest
friends.
Tile peoplfe rounded up all the stat
ues and pictures of President Castro
from the clubs and other semi-public
buildings and burned them on the
Boulevard de Plaza.
President Castro's rule in Venezuela
probably is ended.
Further dangerous demonstrations
are anticipated. No official act de
posing Castro from the presidency of
Venezuela has yet. been taken, but
such a step is expected any moment.
An enormous crowd of the inhabi
tants of the capital, swelled by people
trom the outlying country, gathered in
the streets soon after daybreak.
The people began marching up and
down the main thoroughfare and it
was easy to see that the ill temper
would result *In violence. The poU(M
stood by and made no attempt what
ever t.i restrain the mob. The first
building to he attacked and looted was
that of the lottery monopoly.
Offices Are Pillaged
Tho offices of the state c nterprlM
that has enriched itself at tho expense
of the people were ranjacked and pil
laged.
Furniture was broken and thrown
Into the streets and oiteg of lottery
tickets were destroyed.
The crowd then moved to Ihe print
ing; office <>! Gl Constitucionai, the or
gan of President Castro, of which
Qumerslado Rlvas is editor, and pil
laged it eomplcti !y.
A steam laundry belonging' to Senor
Rivas was wrecked
The crowd then turned Its attention
to several drug stores belonging to Se
nor Thielen, a son-in-law of Gen. Tello
Mendoza, and turned them Inside out.
Gen. Mendoza was at one time minister
of finance and public credit under
Castro*
He also was (he president's private
secretary tor several years and has
been regarded aa cue or his staunches!
supporters. He is universally hated by
the enemies of Castro and his unpopu
larity and his close connection with the
president accounted for til*" auger of
the populace against the property of
his son-in-law.
Statues Are Demolished
Tile Statues and pictures of ['resident
Castro were made Into a huge bon
ftre on tlie Boulevard de Plaza. The
crowd cheered as tho flames completed
the destruction of these effigies of the
dictator.
Numerous inscriptions setting forth
the virtues of Castro and extolling his
powers next attracted the mob and ev
ery Inscription bearing Castro's name
was hacked out and erased.
Borne of these legends were carved .in
the public buildings of the city.
It was after 1 o'clock by the time the
crowd had gotten thus far 1n its depre
dations. It. lacks leadership and paused
In default of other fields for its de
structive energies.
!i wan then that a detachment of
troops was called out for duty on the
city streets, and Acting President Go
mez Issued a manifesto prohibiting
further manifestations.
These measures had the desired ef
fect, for flic mob quieted down and
then dispersed.
The attack yesterday on the offices
nf i:i Constitutional when the crowd
was embed hy a. detachment Of sol
diers who tired into the demonstrators
resulted in Beveral fatalities.
A, criminal action hoi been begun
against Editor Rive* and other em
ployes of the paper, in which thej
charged with responsibility for these
deaths.
It la declared Rlvas and his men fired
flrsl on the people, making use of re

The funeral of Mariano Rojas, oho of
the men killed in the righting of yes
terday, has been fixed for tomorrow.
A vast crowd will turn out and further
disorders and rioting are expected.
In spite of Holland's warlike demon
stration on the coast there have been
no demonstrations against The Nether
lands. They have nil been directed
against President Castro and Acting
President Gomez.
CASTRO MAINTAINS CALM

of Venezuela maintains his composure
In the face of alarming reports pub

COUP FOR COUNT
Sensational Turns Enliven Trial Ir..
volving Prince and Princes*
de Sagan and Others
at Paris
[By Associated Press.l
IRAKIS, Dec. 16.—The last day of the
hearing of the suit brought by
Count Boni de Castellane ag
his Cornier wife, the Princess De .Sagan,
formerly Ann:, (lould, in which ho peti
tions the court to award the custody of
his three children to his mother, the
Marquise De Castellane, brought out
the fact that the count had withdrawn
his demand that the court allow him a
yearly income of $60,000 for keeping the
children.
M. Bonnett, speaking of the count,
read a letter from his client filled with
Indignant protests that he should have
been charged with instituting the pro
ceedings to obtain money and in which
the count abandoned his claim for the
allowance.
!ie. insisted that his only object in
wanting the children was his solicitude
[or their moral and physical welfare.
It is evident that the count has
recognized that his claim for the large
allowance has injured his case in tfie
eyes of the court and the estimation of
the public, and his tardy renunciation
is considered a clever move to enlist
interest in his favor. Nevertheless the
public is greatly astonished that tho
count should go to such an extreme.
Many Charges Made
The proceedings were filled with alle
gations from both sides. The public
prosecutor will present his conclusions
next week and the court will then ren
der Its decision. It will either dismiss
the count's plea or grant him the cus
tody of the children, or if doubt exists,
will order the taking of testimony.
The Princess de Sagan continues to
be sanguine of favorable decision. : .
After unking the court to tako note
of the modification of the petition of
his client M. Bonnet launched into «a j
vigorous denunciation of his ', adver- 7
saries today. .^j
He charged that on many points th«
defendants did not dare to meet i the
allegations of the count, citing particu-;
larly the allegation that the Princess
de^Bagan was ready to leave her pre-;
ent husband. .■; .
"They did not dare . challenge this
statement," the lawyer said, "because,
they know that the proposed separation
has been'formally communicated to Do*
Castellane's attorneys." ? '
Continuing,, M. Bonnet said that all.
the offers of settlement made by tbu'
Princess de Bagan were conditionej
upon the count's renunciation of the
children, but the count; refused to sell
either himself or fiis. children.
Threatened Disinheritance
The princess had told : Judge PittH
that if the children (were taken from
ner she would* disinherit, them,;■ thus ,
proving that In her > eyes everything
was a question of money."
Keferring to the,: obargea that Da
Castellane had dissipated his wife's for
tune, M. Bonnet Insisted the countess,
was just as much responsible, aa her I
husband for the "royal extravagance" .;•
such as the MalakofC palace, the Cha- I
teau Marals and the Charity, Bazaar, >
which alone cost $300,0*0.
The lawyer particularly res.
iteorge Qould's share In the defense,
s.ijing that now the question of money
had been eliminated Mr. Oould u.is
playing the mysterious role of Craw
ford in the Humbert affair. As a mat
ter of fact Mr. Gould always had op-
I>osed the marriage of his sister to the
Prince <le Bagan, and he only finally
consented 6a condition that there would
bt a separation of property.
"Does Mr. Gould fear that his sister
will get another divorce and make ■
more unfortunate marriage?" asked Bt,
Bonnet. "No; 1 can reassure him; tho
princess can find nobody worse than
De Bagan."
The lawyer then asked the court to
: the taking of testimony on points
« hlcta the defense had declined to meet.
Appeals for Children
In conclusion he appealed to the court
to withdraw the three children from
the custody of their mother, who had
married a man renounced hy one of
the greatest families of France, and
who "had spent a month in prison,"
and place them in the care of the moth
er of the count, whose only purpose
was to direct her grandchildren in tho
right path.
Speaking for the princess, M, Clem
enceau characterised De Castellane'a
change «t attitude on the money ques-
tion as a "gallery play" Induced by his
tardy appreciation (if the unprecedented
charaeterof his demand for an allow
ance of $60,000 a year and tile severity
with which the public hart condemned
and ridiculed him. Touching the count's
statement that ho renounced this claim
"with pleasure" the lawyer announced:
"If the count took such pleasure in
renouncing this demand, why did ho
over formulate It."
M. Clemenoeau Justified tii<> Inter
vention of George Gould in his lister's
Interest and waid ho could not under
stand why Mr. Gould was the object
of such violent attacks.
He denounced Castellane'a conduct
miring the period of his marriage. The
count, he said, should have boon lrre
proachable in order to avoid the Insin
uation that he had married Mlhs Gould
t'nr her money.
The lawyer then reminded the ci
that the real battle was between i«.i
men, Count de Castellane and Prince
Helle de Sagan, who hated each other.
M. Clemenceau concluded that the
Princess de Sagan had not forfeited
any of the confidence reposed In her
when the court gave her the custody
of her three children and he asked the
court to maintain his client in hix
rights.
