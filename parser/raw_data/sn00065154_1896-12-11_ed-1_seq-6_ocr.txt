CORN FEEDING AND HOG CHOI.KKA.
Exclusive Feeding: of Cora nmi Its
Effect* on the
Corn is very largely a carbonaceous
food. It eontafns some nitrogen and
E very small portion of phosphate, or
bone-inaking material, but not enough
to supply tiie proper amount of bone
grow Mi for a healthy animal. Even in
"the Eastern States, farmers who have
fed corn to fatten hogs found that
while fat increased, there was no pro
portionate increase in the bones of the
leg. In fact, there is usually no
growth in the bone, and a fattening
hog very soon becomes almost too
weak to stand up to eat. Many times
we have seen these over-fattened hogs
almost blinded with the fat closing I
over their eyes, and so weak in the leg
that the animals would crawl to the
nearest ear of corn, and partly rise on
its fore legs while it ate the corn from
it. Such hogs would not eat much, I
an! n not killed soon would die. It is
ni «'er such conditions in the West that
fattening hogs have long been pre-
par-d to be easy victims to hog chol
era. or any other disease that may fol
low unnatural living.
It is ,-ea 1
ly a serious business for the
localities where the hog cholera has
obtained the mastery of the hog grow
er. Where the infection has once be
gun it is liable to remain for many
years. Xo skill in feeding will certain
ly ftive the hogs exposed to this infec
tion, though it will lessen the danger.
The only way where hog cholera lias
once been prevalent is to thoroughly
vvas'i with a dilution of corrosive sub
jimate. 1.0(H) to 1, all buildings, such
•as pig pens, where sick hogs have been
kept. After this has been done, the
hog yard should be changed to some
part of the farm where hogs have nev
er been kept. In this way tlie disease
may be stamped out. But in some
places there is need of prompt action.
In the southeast* ra portion of Dakota
hog cholera, up to the present time,
has killed fully 3 per cent of the hogs.
In two counties the loss is as much as
J0,000 head, and the farmers will be
compelled to buy hogs from some dis
tance to get those that will be healthy,
and restock their farms. It is likeiy
that many will wait a year or two. so
as to disinfect their farms, before
again attempting to grow and fatten
hogs.
PnnigatinK Lam)i:.
"While we have never tried the plan
of fumigating lambs for lung worms,
we believe It Is worthy of trial. If it
Is properly done, we can see no reason
why it should not exterminate the
pest, which is so prevalent in wet sea
sons like the past one has been. A
correspondent of an Eastern contem
porary recommends the following as
worthy of trial:
"Where the lambs, show signs of dis
ease at weaning time it is the practice
of many here to give them a strong
dose of sulphur smoke. To do this, it
is necessary to coniine the lambs in a
tight place where they can be made to
inhale the fumes. We, this year, used
a garner which had a door at the open
ing, and, as it held twenty-live lambs,
it did not take long to fumigate the en
tire flock.
"After the lambs were driven into
the garner, one man carried a bucket
with a few hot coals, on which a small
handful of sulphur had been thrown,
the door was closed and. as the air
became blue, the lambs would begin
to cough, showing that they were till
ing their lungs with the smoke. The
operator should stay in the room, so
thi't he may know when the lambs
have enough. For a few minutes you
may experience no inconvenience, but
soon the tears will begin to start and a
ir.rnf* will come in your throat that
impedes breathing-then you may
know that the lambs have about ail
thev can stand. However, the smoke
will generally be stronger at five or
!oet from the floor than at the level
»f the lambs' nostril- and the lambs
may be left in one or two minutes
after the man has been obliged to
come out.
"It appears to me this is the com
mon-sense way of getting worms off
the lungs, rather than to put tempera
ture in the stomach to vaporize
through the lungs and trachea.
"I have frequently seen this remedy
used with favorable results, and
should like Mr. Wing to give it a trial
when again overtaken by a wet sea
son."
Hog Cholera In a New Aspect.
An exchange reports the death of
two children from a disease said to
resemble hog cholera. The cholera
was in the herd on the farm and the
•explanation of the alleged fact that it
W.!S e-
Host.
There is a great prevail e of hog
cholera in some parts of the West this
year. It is, we b.-dk ve. the natural re
sult of the enormous com crop Inst
year and this, which has led to the
«xeli:sivc feeding with corn, which
used to be eonunau, and which so
Weakened the eonstitutions of hogs
that they easily became subject to dis
ease. This does not mean that the
disease is not contagious, and when
well established it will destroy hogs
that have been fed properly-rationed
food. Without doubt, there are germs
of disease, 1 hat will attack any hog.and
wherever any susceptible point can be
reached, will cause the animal to sick
en and die. Tin* oint is that with
corn-fed hogs this susceptibility to at
tacks of the dreaded disease is greatly
increased.
:m
ro
facilitated I
ward the
-1 «-hl]dr--n
that the family dog ran ireeiy among
the pigs and afterwards played wish
the children. There are a good many
diseases communicable from animals
to man, such, for example, as tubercu
losis, ant lira x. glanders and others, but
this is the tirst time that even the sus
picion has arisen of the similar dan
ger from hog cholera Wo iv-ard it as
highly improbable that the disease was
thus eommuni. a ted. The hog cholera
lias prevailed throughout the swine
belt to a greater or less extent for a
good many years and lias frequently
been very virulent. I.h i or no pains
has ever been taken to prevent the
spre.id of the disease to the human
family, if such spread be possible.
The owners of diseased animals have
handled them freely, have buried and
burned their carcasses, have visited'
the quarters during the attack, and in
every possible way have been exp sed
to the contagion. Nevertheless, no
eases have been heretofore suspected
as occurring from the contact, and it
is highly improbable that this is the
true explanation of the two deaths
now reported. It is much more likelv
that the disease was due to some
other cause, still we would not allow
the children to play with a dog that
daunts diseased quarters, for it is al
ways beter to be safe than sorry.
Crimson Clover for Hones,
The division of botany of the Tinted
States department of agriculture lias
investigated the cause of death in
horses that have been allowed to feed
on overripe crimson clover (trifolium

oeen banned up by the agricultural
press of many of the Northern slates.
lie calyx of this clover is densely be
set with crimson hairs, which, at ma

served when the clover is eaten be
fore the seed has matured. The fatal
effects have mainly occurred when the
plants were allowed to ripen and tin
stiaw and refuse, after threshing, had
been fed to horses. From all of which
we conclude that crimson clover is an
excellent crop to plow under, or to al
low to mature and be used to reduce
the surplus horse stock of the country.
Con* and Hog Feeding'
A feeding experiment was conducted
by the Illinois Experiment station, the
results of which are worthy of careful
attention. It was conducted in finish
ing off and fattening hogs. The exper
iments were made in nine different
months of the year and show excel
lent. work. The average of the sixteen
lots showed II 1-2 ]Mnnds of live
weight made from tifty-six bushels of
corn. With corn worth cents per
bushel, this would make pork cost a
trifle over 3 cents per pound.
The poorest results were obtained
from work done in January, which
showed 193 pounds from one bushel' of
corn fed to pigs weighing ins pounds
each. The next poorest results were
obtained in June. July and August,
and showed 8/J.s pounds iter bushel of
corn fed to pigs weighing 2US pounds
each. The third poorest result was in
July, and showed 'pounds per
bushel fed to pigs of 223 pounds
weight. The best work was done in
December, and showed 1(5.81 pounds
from one bushel of corn.

Corn meal and ground oats, mixed

If you have ensilage, feed it to all

Cholera, like the poor, is always
with us somewhere, and always will
be until we feed less corn and breed
from more mature stock.
It is the opinion of many that keep
ing hay before horses continually is
not only wasteful, but injurious to
horses that are big eaters
A good practice is to keep first-class
brood sows—those that use large lit

years old, or even later.
An exchange says: Runaway horses
are unknown in Russia. No one drives
them there without having a thin cord
with a running noose around the neck
of the animal. When the horse bolts
the cord is pulled, and the horse stops
as soon as it feels the prensure ou its
windpipe.

prayers committees will be appointed
to notify the president that, the senate
and house an* organized and ready to
receive communications and proceed
with business. If precedents are fol
lowed there will be an adjournment
soon after the receipt of the message.
The first week of the session is not
expected to be productive of important
results in a legislative way. There
are many senators who think that but
little or nothing should fe done be
yond the passage of the appropriation
bills at this session, and as these meas
ures necessarily originate in the house
there will be a disposition to postioue
the session of activity until some of
these bills can be received from the
other end of the capitol. The proba
bilities are that the daily sessions at
the beginning will be coinparnively
brief and that the senate will content
itself with four days' work a week.
The calendar presents a wide range
of material for consideration in case
the senate shows a disposition to bury
itself. In this is inelud the immigra
tion bill, which is the "unfinished busi
ness," the Pacific railroad refunding
bill, the statehood bills and the Dingiev
tariff and bond bills, as well as the
Cuban and Hawaiian questions.
Senators Ledge and Ch-indler have
announced their determination to press
ihe immigration bill to a vote as speed
ily as they can. It will be the iirst
regular business to be taken up and
cannot be displace.] except by a vote
or unanimous eonsvnt. They hone to
ge the bill through before' the holi
days. It is also possible th:• i.e- presi
dent's message may suggi -abjects
for speeches, and there are iin»e who
predict, thai the Cuban question will
receive vigorous attention from the be
ginning of the session.
It is generally agreed that the Re
publicans will hold a a icus de
.ermine rpm a line of policy, especially
with reference to the tariff, and until
after the exchange of views which
this conference will permit, no step is
likely to be taken which will commit
the party to auv position mi any ques
tion of political significance.
