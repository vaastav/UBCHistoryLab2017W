York.
It is not a desirable conditiofi of
politics where one State stands as
the i-o oft rolling power in a Presiden
tial election. Vet'for twenty years
vote of Now York has been
14 rn*Slc'1 for *nd fought for by both
t '^'reat parties, with the knowledge
tiiut her electoral choice would in all
probability control the National
'-?overnment for at at least fonr
years. It needs no argument to
prove that such a.combination of
circumstances is not conducive to
? the absolute purity of our elections.
All men are human, and politicians
are especially so, and it is not to be
wondered that in a doubtful contest,
whose result might bring weal or
woe to them, these gentlemen would
be urged on to efforts not always
either commendable or legitimate.
Sew York will probably never
again occupy so important a posi
tion in the presidential elections of
this country. In a few years more,
almost certainly before the next
quadrennia1 struggle begins, there
will be four or five new Western
States carved out of our Territories
and that will bring twenty votes to
the electorial college. This number
a>l?led to the increased representa
tion which the next census must
give to the growing Western States,
will serve to disturb the power
which New York has heretofore
enjoyed, in deciding Presidential
elections. She will no longer be
the pivotal State, for the centre of
political power will have moved
larther West, and the fight for the
political supremacy in this country
instead of being decided by the peo
ple who dwell within a radius of a
fe w miles from New York City Hall
will be settled in other and newer
fields of contest.
The immediate duty of Democrats
is to strengthen the hands of our
representatives in the present Con
gress, so that they may live up to
the highest stardard of "Democratic
faith and yielding nothing that
might be used to Democratic disad
vantage in the comparison between
Cleveland s and Harrison's adminis
trations. It will always be borne
in mind by our Congressmen that
the result of the election of 1892
w.U chiefly depend upon the his
tory of the Democratic era that will
not be interrupted until March 4,
lhaft. Let us do well our part until
the end of our commission from the
American people, and leave nothing
for our opponents to trade upon ex
cept their own acts of performance
or ommission when responsibility
rests upon them. It matters not
however wisely the Republican Ad
ministration may be managed, Dem
ocratic principles are right, and will
prevail with the people. Let us bo
ready to tako advantage of such
mistakes as our opponents may
make. But let us rely upon the
strength of our own cause to win
the favorable verdict of tho country
at the next Presidential election.
"He mocks the people who pro
poses that the government shall
protcct the rich, and that they in
tarn will care for the laboring poor.
Any intermediary between the peo
ple and their government, or the
least delegation of the care and pro
tection the government owes to the
humblest citizen in the land, makes
tiie boast of free institutions a glit
tering delusion, and the pretended
boon of American citizenship a
shameless imposition."?President
Cleveland a Message.
President Cleveland sounds 110 re
treat on the tariff issue, and in his
message sent to Congress, he reiter
ates with even greater force and
clearness his views on this great
question. Tariff Reform is bound
ti? win, even though its brave lead
er was struck down at the opening
of the battle by the monopolists
whose interest it is to blind the peo
ple to the true state of affairs.
Don't be too exultant Bro. White
of the Parkerbburg Journal. Wo
are not going to kick up a "rump
us" in our own party. But our
party leaders need a little scolding
once in a while, and we are honest
enough to give it to tbem. It be
comes necessary sometimes to speak
oat in meeting.
From the returns received at the
office of Secretary of State, Cleve
land carried West Virginia by about
1,600 majority. The Democratic
State ticket with the exception of
Governor, received about 1,200.
Goff bought enough to elect himself,
but there was a failure iu the deliv
ery of all the contract called for.
Things most not be so next time.
Texas, the banner Democratic
State, comes up smiling with a ma
jority. for Clevelrnd of 103,362.
This ? a gaiii of more than. 31,000
over 1884.
The People'* Cmme.
Mr. Cleveland struck the key
note of the tariff question, when he
said; "It is tho peoples cause."
It is the cause of the people, and
it's the people's party which will
maintain it. It is the custom of our
people to glory too much in the
growth and'splendor of this country
while shutting their eyes to the
shadows that lie hid behind the
splendor. They see too much of
that which is pleasing to the pride,
and too little of that which should
appeal to their sympathy. While
looking on the gorgeous palaces of
the rich, they forget the myriad
hovels of the poor.
It is not to make war on wealth
or to retard prosperity that the
Democratic party seeks to change
the tariff laws. It is only to pro
duce a more general distribution of
"both, by dispensing that justice
which is the chief element of our
Government impartially among all
its citizens. It is to open the way
to prosperity to all, and not debar
any from an equal chance to win
whatever may be fairly won, that
the Democratic party is in the
field. It is going to win, notwith
standing this last defeat.?Ex.
Democrats can afford to bo cheer
ful under their defeat. We have
a four years' record to feel proud of.
It has been four years of good,
honest, clean government. There
have been no stealings and no
scandals. The Republican party,
in twenty-five years, spent more
than a hundred millions of dollars
in constructing a navy, and when
it went ont of power there was not
a single modern war ship and only
one dispatch boat?the Dolphin.
The Democratic party in four
years, with an expenditure ot less
than twenty-five millions of dollars,
has begun the construction of a
magnificent navy. There are a
number of war ships nearing com
pletion, that will rank as first class
naval equipments. What bccame
of the hundred million of dollars
expended during Republican ad
ministrations? Robson, Secretary
of the Navy, went in poor and came
out a millionaire. A great many
other prominent Republicans went
in poor and came out prosperous.
The indications are that those gen
tlemen salted tho American navy
down for their own private use.
And yet Republican newspapers
talk about fraud in the Democratic
party. Avaunt!
If the Hon. Charles Edgar Hogg
should ever get it in hid head to be
a candidate for a State or district
office be will be called upon to ex
plain why it was that Judge Jack
son ran 150 votes behind the Dem
ocratic ticket in Mason county.?
Wayne Neics.
It is such dyspeptics as you, Mr.
Mansfield, to whom the charge of
the defeat of Judge Jackson, may
be laid. Mr. Hogg has nothing to
apologize for, nor is ho called upon
to explain, as you demand. If
Judge Jackson ran 150 votes behind
his ticket in this county, will you
please explain how it was that he
ran about the same number of votes
behind the ticket in your own
county of Wayne? Mr. Hogg
will bo tho Democratic nom
inee in 1892, and will bo elected,
whether you support him or not.
There is a disposition to try and
prevail upon the Governor to with
hold the certificate of election from
Hon. Chas. B. Smith, Congressman
elect, from the Fourth District.?
We don't belicro Gov. Wilson' can
be inveigled into doing anything of
the kind. Capt. Smith was fairly
elected. On the re-count of the
votes demanded by his opponent, it
was shown that Capt. Smith had a
clear majority of 13 in the District,
This ought to bo enough to end the
wrangle. We would like to have
seen a Democrat represent thie Dis
trict, but are not going to join in
the cry of "fraud" to help keep
? Capt. Smith out of bis scat in Con
gress to which he was fairly and
[ honestly elected, simply because he
is a Republican.
Bro. Thompson, that was a manly
, apology ot yours in the last Adver
tiser. We are in the habit of bring
ing brother editors up to the rack,
when they slur a Mason county cit
izen. We are exceedingly touchy
on this point. Wo are glad to learn
that you intended no reflection up
on 31 r. Hogg.
According to promises made,
wages should now advance and ev
erybody be happy with plenty of
employment. And as a starter in
this direction twelve thousand em
ployes of the Beading railroad have
had their thne and pay reduced
twenty per cent, and six thousand
miners above Pittsburg havo been
discharged. This is the first fruits
of tho great victory that was to
bring abundant employment to ev
eryone at increased wages.
Leading Republicans are yelling
for tariff reduction. Republican
manufacturers are shutting down.
The surplus is there, Moriarity, and
the taxed workingmen who voted I
j
the war tax ticket already begin to i
foel what fools they were.
"Do Yon Want Wart"
The wild jibenaincsay of the
North und mouthpiece of the Re
publican Natioriiil Committee, Col.
Eliot F. Shepheardj of the New
York Mail and Express, thus ed
itorialized the Republican policy to
bo pursued toward the South if the
South dosen't instantly get down on
its knees. Bead it:
"The Democrats arc trying to
steal the Federal House of Repre
sentatives. No one denies it. To
day the news comes that they have
robbed West Virginia of a duly
elected Republican Congressman.
They will try to rob Louisiana.
They have cheated a North Caro
linia Republican out of his seat in a
district which is notoriously Repub
lican by 8,000 majority. They have
given certificates to moro than half
a score of Democrats whom the peo
ple have defeated.
"The country is in danger, and
we are speaking soberly, with self
restraint, but in terriblo earnest,
when we sound the note of warning.
The Democrats shall not bo permit
ted to consummate this crime. This
country is not the home of thieves
and thugs and plunderers. It is
not to be controlled by traitors. It
is not to have its suffrage and its
freedom destroj-ed by violenco.
The'Democratic party will not be
permitted to steal the government
any more than they were permitted
to break it up by force of arms.
Crimes against the ballot box will
be put down by the same military
power that crashed the life out of
the rebellion.
The next war will not bo begun
by the South. It will come from
the North. The clash of resoundi ng
arms that will next be heard will
come from the weapons of hundreds
of thousands of loyal Northern men
who will not permit the stealing of
their birthright. The laws of the
United States shall not be made by
political thieves. The men who
hold the seats of the people's repre
sentatives shall be duly chosen.
Let the Democratic party look to it
that they save the country from a
war that will surely follow their
theft of the House of Representa
tives.
"The South had best take warn
ing. Its outrages upon the while
and negro voter have been tolerated
too long; but they cannot, and will
not, bo permitted to chango the
political complexiod of the popular
branch of Congress. Let tho Dem
ocrats keep their foul hands off the
most sacred institutions of the na
tion. We have had enough of them.
We have driven them out of power
They shall not gain by crime what
they have lost by the ballot-box.
If they go on in their thievish ef
forts they will soon hear tho ap
proaching march of the northern
army that will make war upon the
men who undertake to set aside the
poople's verdict by crime.
"To tho Democrats; Do tho Dem ?
ocrats realize what kind of war this
will mean? Do they understand
that it will be waged in every city
and hamlet in tho land? That its
life-destroying and property-de
stroying powers will hstro no equul
in the world's history of war?
"Does the South want any
more lead and steell Has it not
had enough of armies tramping it's
crops into the dust and suspending
its industries with fearful effect? If
it does not want war with all its
attendant horrors, let it cease its
efforts to steal the House of Represen
tatives, for if the Democrats do not
stop now, at once, in their criminal
conspiracy, there will be war begun
and carried on with all tho ardor
and energy of the North."
How do you like that Democrats
and Southern people? This Shep
herd is tho mouthpioce of tho Re
publican managers who bought the
late election, despite the 90,000 of a
popular majority you gave for
Grover Cleveland. He is a son-in
law of Millionaire Public-be-damn
ed Vanderbilt. He varies his father
in-law's phrase a little, and speaks
of the majority of the people, as
"thieves and thugs and plunderers,"
and says he has "had enough of
thg>r~t-?ud that if they don't get
off tho face of the earth, or at least
stop voting against his party, he
will wage "in every city and ham
lot of the land" a "life-destroying,
property destroying war," which
will be "begun and carried on with
alf the ardor and energy of the
North." By the way, whut would
become of this millionaire, in the
event of his "life-destroying, prop
erty-destroying" war.
There is little doubt that Quay
and Shopherd and the rest of them
would send an army South and dis
franchise every Democratic State if
it were in their power so to do, and
make this a millionaires' govern
ment entirely and at~once.
The hope of the South is, first, in
romaining solid, and, second, in
President Harrison, who, having
been a soldier and fought against
the South, probably will exhibit
some sense of bravery, honesty and
magnanimity in dealing with the
South.
In the meantime the South will
remain solid and cast the lies and
slanders of these cowardly carpet
knights aud corruptioniats back in
their teeth.?Register.
Every farmer, every laborer, ev
ery person interested in the welfare
of the people of this country should

A Chicago anarchist just convict
ed has been sentenced to- twelve

this is a merciful sentences There

severe for those people.
j So far us the elections any
thing, it may be said that the coun
try wants high tartff, h|gh taxes
and high wages. The two- first
they will get, but the last they will
do without. A high tariff always
means low wages.
i Italy has a high, almost prohib
itory, tariff, and tho Italian laborers
are theseris of the earth. Germany
has a high protective tariff and Ger
man laborers receive less than half
the wages paid in free trade- En

The .Republicans elected seven
circuit judges, and the Democrats
seven, at the late election in this
State. This was a close election all
around. Democrats must not per
mit the election to be so close again.
There are from 6000, to 10,000 dem

A Registration La* Seeded.
The Into election has proven one
thing to the satisfaction of ail who

ty along the line of the Norfolk &
Western Railroad, nor observe the
similar importation of hordes of il
legal voters from. Ohio and Pennsyl
vania into the border counties of
this State, without deep indignation,
and the conviction that the protec
tion afforded by our present laws is
wholly insufficient to preserve our
elections inviolate. It is the judg
ment of the people of a large major
ity of the States that a registration
law is.a wise conseryer of the pur
ity of tho ballot-box. Our present
election laws in West Virginia leave
most ample room for evasions and
violations, and it is au imperative
necessity that other safe guards be
provided if we expect to ha%*e fair
elections heroin the future. Tho
clause in our Constitution which
virtually prohibits a registration
law was induced by tho hideous
memory of the test-oath registration
law under which our people suffer
ed several years after the war. Ol
course no such thing is now con
templated; we have in view only a
plain and useful measure, designed
for the prime purpose of preventing
those villainies which have been
perpetrated within _ our borders,
during the late election.
The Democrats have a majority
iu the Legislature, and having been
tho victims of these frauds, it is an
obligation they owe their party, as
welf as a public duty to propose to
tho people a Constitutional amend
ment which will admit of the enact
ment of a well-considered registra
tion law. The Republicau legisla
tors on tho other hand, unless aid
ers and abettors iu these rascalities,
should bo willing and anxious for
fairness in our State elections, and
to that end should support tho
measure.

The annexation of Canada soenis
to be the all absorbing topic with
the metropolitan newspapers just at
pres(fut. Wo have a big country
now and with the addition of Canada
would have a much bigger one. Our
maps would all have to, bo revised
and would present a very different
appearance than they do at present.
This would put our school book
publishers to a great deal of expense.
If Canada should bo annexed, such
of us who are fortunate enough to
be bank cashiers would have no
haven of refuge in case we saw an
opportunity to indulge in a little
privato speculation with other peo
ple's' mono}*, and more than this, the
annexation proposition originated
in the camp of our political enemies.
Past experience has taught us to
look with suspicion on anything
emenating from a Republican source,
and we hardly feel- like whooping j
ourselves hoarse in favor of the
proposition until we find out what
object tho Republicans had in mak
ing it. This country is getting
along fairly well at present, in our
opinion, but not so well as it would
if it had a larger "solid south." By
way of a compromise with tho "an
nexation fellers' how would it do
to tako off a slice from Mexico, if
we must have anything? We need
more Democratic congressmen cs
pocially if the Republicans succeed
in vesting their favorite territorial
applicants with statehood, and we
had much rather tako chances on
Mexico than Canada. Let us go
slow in this annexation business.?
