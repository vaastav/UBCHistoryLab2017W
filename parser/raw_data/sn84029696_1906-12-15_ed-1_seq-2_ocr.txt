What Becomes of the Dimes?
In some parts of the country trouble
Is reported on account of the scarcity
of dimes. What becomes of the
dimes? An official In Washington sue
gests that because the country Is pros
perous people keep dimes in their
pockets to hear them jingle. This po
sition is not tenable, because any other
coin would jingle just as well, and If
people are so prosperous, as to find
pleasure in jingling coins in their nock
eta they would be likely to use larger
ones for the purpose. The penny-in-the
slot machines are held responsible
for a scarcity of pennies. Street car
lines and automatic telephones sccu
mulate nickel five-cent pieces, but
there is no particular use for dimes
that would cause thorn to be concen
trated in the hands of a few corpora
tions. It Is not likely that they are
hoarded in children's savings banks'
to the extent that pennies and nickels
are, because it does not take many
dimes to make a dollar, and dollars
aro deposited in. banks where they
draw Interest and then the coins are
released to go back into circulation
Estimating the coinage of dimes since
the publication of the last reporof
the director of the mint as averairine
the same as in the last few years re
ported, there have been coined from
1792 to the present day. says the Chi
cago Tribune, about 520.000.000 dlmps
Moro than half of these, however, have
been coined in the last 20 years, and
the older ones have largely disap-
pearedfrom circulation. In the year
13UJ t&e different mints of the United
States received nearly 8.000.000 dimes
which were retired as uncurrent, a
number almost exactly equal to one
third the coinage for the year. It is
probable that there are not in circula
tion more than three dimes for each
inhabitant of the United States. The
slight relation which the total coinage,
or even the amount outstanding, bears
to the amount in circulation is shown
by the fact that there are still out
standing about S00.000 half cents, 28,
000,000 two-cent pieces, and 20.000,000
nickel three-cent pieces which no one
ever sees, and which may have been
lost or melted long ago, but are still
on the treasury books as outstanding.
In view of the statistics the seareitv
of dimes need not be wondered at.
Tho only extraordinary thing Is that
anyone should complain. There is
nothins a dime will buy that cannot
be paid for in other coins with almost
equal convenience. Any kind of mon
ey is good if there is plenty alto
gether. "The obstacle to salvage at great
depths Is pressure," says the Marine
Review. "Little is attempted beyond
a depth of 50 feet, by reason of it.
With his new diving suit M. do Pluvy,

however, made considerably more

Of ordinary diving. No air is received
from the outside. . The dress consists
of ap armor of sheet metal from one-
fifth to ono-third of an inch thick, with
joints and coupling points of pressed
leather and rubber, and a helmet with
two cylindrical regenerating chambers
attached. The air circulating through
the helmet has Its oxygen continually
renewed by chemicals in these cham
bers, regulating valves keeping the
dejths. Mounting and descending are
effected by a cable carried on a drum
driven by an electric motor, and this
cable also carries the current needed
for the respiratory apparatus. The
diver communicates with the surface
by telephone, while wires run from
the armor to electric lights that show
the working of the difteernt parts of
this complicated 'dress.' "

prefer that congress should submit
to the savcral states a proposed
amendment to the? constitution for
Is? election of senators by direct
vote of the people, so that the states
ndgnt pass upon it as a single ques

BIG STORM AT FRISCO
FIERCEST IN YE .RS SWEEPS
OVER STRICKEN CITY.
SCORES OF PEOPLE ARE INJURED
Velocity of Wind Reaches Sixty
Miles Per Hour Walls Were Lev
eled . Shipping Affected Street
Car System Destroyed.
San Francisco, Dec. 11. The
fiercest storm that this city has ex
perienced in many years swept over
San Francisco today, causing the
death of one man, injuring a score
of others, and doing damage estimat
ed at half a million dollars.
Sections of ruined walls were lev
eled, temporary structures blown
down, schools and houses unroofea,
cellars and basements flooded, street
car service interrupted for several
hours and all activity on the water
front suspended. Forcaster McAdie
of the weather bureau tonight said
that it was the severest storm ex
perienced in this part of the coun
try for fourteen years-
At 11:20 o'clock the wind reached
a velocity of 52 miles an hour, while
off the heads it was blowing- GO miles
an hour, and 2.0 inches of rain f .VI
during the day. The storm abated in
the afternoon, but rain still continues
to fall.
Aside from the dead and injured,
and the pecuniary loss sustained by
many, the worst sufferers were the
inmates of the refugee camps, where
misery and wretchedness reigaeJ.
Tents were carried away, flimsy,
temporary eaijuis wero blown down,
while many of those that withstood
the wind leaked badly.
At Harbor View, where 1,200 refu
gees are housed in tents and tempo
rary houses, hundreds were driven
out by the storm, drenched to the
skin. Houses were thrown open to
them, and especially women and
children taken in and made comfort
able. All street car traffic was suspended
early In the forenoon by masses of
brick and steel which had fallen into
the streets, carrying poles and wires
with them, and the dangpr from the
tottering walls swaying in the hi
wind. By 5 o'clock this evening the
service, although somewhat crippled
and irregular, had been restored on
all the lines in the city.
The British ship, Palgrave, is stii
ashore, but is reported to be but lit
tle damaged. The tugs are standing
by her and it is believed that she
will be pulled olf at high tide tomor
row.
On the bay of the story was terrif-
fic. Tho ferry boats, proceedin
witn extraordinary caution, were
tossed about until scores of passeng
ers were sick. The lower deck
were awash most of the time and
occasionally the crest of a wave leap
ed on to the hurricane decks.
What threatened to result in
serious panic occurred on the 'Kay
route boat San Francisco, when an
unusually large wave struck the ves
sel carrying her to leeward. Women
screamed and fainted, men rushed for
the life boats and only the advice
and command of the cool headed pre
vented injury and perhaps loss
life among the other passengers
of
Double anchor chains did not pre
vent some of the larger vessels in
the harbor from slipping their moor
ing. The Chinese war junk Whand
Ho, which lay south of the K. ferry
ships last night, dragged her anchors
until she rested in the channel imme
diately In front of the ferries, increas
ing the difficulties of navigation. The
British ship Palgrave slipped her
moorings shortly after 8 o'clock and
drifted onto the rocky shore of Al
catraz island, where for a time
it
seemed that she would be beaten to
pieces. Two tugs went to her as
sistance and towed her into deep wa
ter.
Supply, Okla., Dec. 11. Word has
been received from Paruna, Okla., of
one of the most cruel murders in the
history of Woodward county. The
murdered man, named Smith, and his
wife; had a quarrel Sunday afternoon
about going to the endeavor meeting
that evening, the woman finally go
ing against the husband's protests
When Mrs. Smith was returning with
one of the neighbors she was met by
Mr. Smith, who warned her not to
return to his home. The next morn
ing people passing the house saw
pool of blood in front of the door and
oegan an investigation, a trail was
discovered leading to where the body-
was discovered with the lariat rope
around the neck. The theory is that
Smith was called to the door, struck
down, the rope fastened around his
neck and tied to a saddle horn. There
were tracks of three horses leading
across the plowed ground. A most
sensational arrest has been made in
the imprisonment of Harold White, a
well-to-do farmer, the alleged leader
of the gang. that killsd Smith. Coun
ty officers claim that White's affec
tions for Mrs. Smith was responsible
for the tragedy. Several other farm
ers charged with being accomplices
are also under arrest. Their names
cannot be learned.

BIRD TRAVELS WITH GIRAFFE
Red Billed Weaver Constant1 Compan
ion of Animal Skyscraper.
The red-billed weaver bird ia a con
stant companion of the giraffe, perch
ing itself upon the withers and flying
along when Its host takes to flight,
and immediately alighting again on
its back at the first opportunity. The
only means of defense or offense by
the giraffe is by means-of-its hoofs,
and the blows it can deliver by kick
ing are of tremendous power. The
old males during the breeding season
fight in this manner a good deal, and
the female employs the same means
in defending her young against car-,
nivorous animals.
Giraffes are very swift of foot, and
it requires a very fleet horse to run
them down. Experienced hunters,
however, charge them at full speed,
and by this means are often able to
run into them, and if the giraffes are
fat they will soon become "blown..
When running the tail is twisted in
a corkscrew fashion over the back and
the hind legs at each step are thrown
on the outside of the forelegs, giving
a very grotesque straddling appear
ance. The giraffe is mute, but he has
a very keen sense of hearing and of
pmell. '

Scheme Worked Out Badly.
Congressman Sulzer' represents a
densely populated district on the East
side of New York city. It occurred to
him some months .ago that though
there are no gardens In his district
some of his constituents might grow
plants in boxes placed on v window
sills or fire escapes, so he sent an as
sortment of seed to the inmate of a
model tenement house owned by one
of his friends. The latter met him
a few days ago and said: "See here.
Sulzer, I want you to cut out that seed
business. It's the limit!" "Why,
what's the matter?' asked the aston
ished Sulzer, and he explained why he
had sent the seeds. "Oh, you meant
well, all right," returned the friend,

Unearthing the Briber.
During a recent campaign In Eng-
land a certain woman called on a laT
borer's wife and asked if her husband
would vote for Lord Blank. "No, he
won't," was the reply. "But, remem
ber the blankets and coals you got
from the clergyman." "Never mind
them. He's been promised a new pair
of trousers if he votes for Mr. Dash."
Suspecting that this was a case of
bribery that must be outdone, the
woman canvasser offered a sovereign
if the woman would tell her who had
promised the trousers. The money
paid' over, the woman smiled. "I
promised them," she said, "and
buy them out of your sovereign."

Missed Chance for Fame.
The astronomer, Lalande, narrowly
escaped being made famous by & dis
covery. He accidentally struck Nep
tune with his glass on May 8, 1785,
but supposed it was a star. He put It
down in his notebook as a star and
recorded its exact situation. Two
days later he struck it once more and
made a retord of it. But when he
looked over his notes he found he had
it down as being in two different
places, and as a star cannot move in
48 hours he supposed he had made
a mistake in one of his notes. If he
had used his mind a little less me
chanically he easily might have been
a Columbus.
NO MEDICINE.
But Change cf Food Gave Final Relief.
Most diseases start In the aliment
ary canal stomach and bowels.
A great deal of our stomach and
bowel troubles come from eatintr too
much starchy and greasy food.
The stomach does not digest any of
the starchy food we eat white bread,
pastry, potatoes, oats, etc. theso
things are digested in the small tntea
tines, and if we eat too much, as most
of us do, the organs that should di.
gest this kind of food are overcome
by excess of work, so that fermenta
tion, indigestion, and a long" train
of alls result.
Too much fat also is hard to digest.
and this is changed into acids, sour
stomach, belching gas. and a blca.tr
heavy feeling.
Ia these conditions a change from
indigestible foods to Grape-Nuts wili
worlr wonders in not only relieving
the distress but in building up a
strong digestion, clear brain, and
steady nerves. A Wash, woman
writes:
'About five years ago I suffered with
bad stomach dyspepsia, indigestion

two weeks I began to feel better: ann "
