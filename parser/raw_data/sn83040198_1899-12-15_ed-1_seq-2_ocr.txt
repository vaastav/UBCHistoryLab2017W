TOPICS OF THE DAY.
Ratio of Births and Death.
It is computed that the death rate of
the world is 67 and the birth rate 70 a
minute. This seeming light percent
age of gain is sufficient to give a net
increase in population each year of 1,
200,000.
Consumption of Flesh Food.
" The consumption of flesh food per in
habitant in the United States is 120
pounds; in Great Britain, 105 pounds;
In France, 74 pounds; in Germany, 69
pounds; in Spain, 49 pounds; in Russia,
48 pounds, and in Italy, 23 pounds.
Edison's New Invention.
Thomas A. Edison, Jr., has invented
a long-distance telephone that he says
will enable him to talk to people in
Europe as easily as he can to those in
another part of New York. He uses a
transmitter 1,000 times as sensitive as
those to be found in ordinary telephone
instruments.
Removal of the Maine Wreck.
There is friction now between the
higher officials of the army and navy
as to which branch of the service shall
be charged with the removal from Ha
vana harbor of the wreck of the Maine.
There are yet in the hulk, according
to Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, more bodies than
have been buried in the cemetery at
Havana, and it is to recover these that
the removal of the debris is desired.
Rapid Progress of Women.
The remarkable increase in the num
ber of young women enrolled in the
graduate course of Yale is the striking
feature of the graduate department
catalogue. It is only six years since
the faculty threw the graduate courses
open to young women at Yale, yet to
day, out of a total attendance of 290
students in the department, more than
half are graduates of women's colleges.
Whisky and Tobacco Pay a Bis Tax.
Spirits made by far the largest con
tribution to the internal revenue taxes
the past year, as usual, and tobacco
came next, as usual, also. Spirits and
fermented liquors paid taxes of no less
than $168,000,000, and tobacco paid $52,
000,000. Together these two items ac
count for nearly two-thirds of the
whole internal revenue receipts for the
year covered by the commissioner's re
port.
Enthusiastic Regarding Alaska.
John Garland Price, who will repre
sent Alaska in congress, is a lawyer of
Skaguay. He was born in Iowa 29 years
ago, and is an enthusiast on the subject
of Alaska. He believes that a territory
should be made of southeastern Alaska.
He desires to secure from congress ap
propriations for adequate court ar
rangements, and to arrange so that a
' greater percentage of the taxes col
lected in -the territory shall be ex
pended in building up the country.
New York's Map of Itself.
New York city is preparing for the
Paris exposition an immense map of
itself measuring 26 by 23 feet, on a scale
of 600 feet to the inch, showing every
6treet, park, waterway, public square,
monument and prominent building.

To Investigate Cancers.'
The Middlesex hospital in London is
about to open an elaborate addition
for the exclusive treatment of cancers.
Special bacteriological, microscopical
and chemical laboratories have been
fitted up, and a competent staff has
been engaged to investigate by means
of scientific methods the origin and de
velopment of cancer and to trace it
minutely through its various stages.
endeavoring by every means to find
not only a cure, but a prevention of
the spread of the disease.
Advocates Compulsory Education.
Miss Estelle Reel, general superin
tendent of Indian schools, in her an
nual report makes a strong plea for
compulsory education and advocates
strictly industrial training for Indian
children. She says the industrial
branch of the work should be forced
to the front and that literary instruc
tion be narrowed to the simple, practi
cal elements. ' The educational outlook
for the Indians is painted as very en
co ur aging and better buildings and
more facilities for industrial training
have been provided this year.
Religion In the Family.
When the decline of religion is men
tioned, it is supposed by the actively
, or passively non-religious to refer to a
condition in the protestant churches.
But it appears that it is not evangeli-
' cal protestantism alone that is believed
- to be suffering in some sense a decline.
Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch, of Chicago, in a
. recent discourse spoke of the gradual
' disappearance of home devotion and
domestic religious practice and in
struction, and of the "failings and fail
ures of modern religion.". "The
trouble knows no sectarian lines," said
Dr. Hirsch.
V ON THE MESSAGE. -
Comment of Democratic Journals on
the President's Paper to
Congress.
It ought to be plain to every reader
of the message that the people cannot
cne for anything .but increase upon
increase of expenditure in aid of all
sorts of projects, chiefly private, so
long as the party of which Mr. McKin-
ley is the chosen head remains in pow
er. Chicago Chronicle.
It is a soothing document, with no
irritating touch upon any sore subject
of political controversy precisely
what might have been expected from
President McKinley the year before
the presidential election. The irrita
tion will come when congress shall un
dertake the necessary task of forcing
the hand of the executive. Philadel
phia Record.
In the 40,000 words, more or less,
which the president unloaded yester
day upon a helpless congress, there is
not one clear-cut, inspiring thought.
The message has some good points and
some bad, like any average report of a
bureau clerk. The president's views on
the Philippines are as vague as his ideas
about Cuba. His wisdom consists in
passing responsibility along. N". Y.
Journal.
As to the trusts, the president is suffi
ciently frank and direct. That "what
ever power congress possesses over this
most important subject should be
promptly ascertained and asserted.
The Post suggests that as a beginning
congress might deal with a few of the
worst culprits in an effectual manner
by making a reduction in the altitude
of the tariff schedules, under the shel
ter of which they are operating.
Washington Post (Ind.).
With the exception of half a dozen
sentences there is nothing in it that
conveys any new information or any
new views of the president's policy. It
has all been announced or foreshad
owed. It puts nothing in a very strik
ing way. It is filled with platitudes and
ambiguous phrases, with high-sound
ing declarations that mean liothing.
Indianapolis Sentinel.
The president has some pretty bold
words to say about the trusts. Let us
hope they are sincere and not. merely
a sop thrown to the powerful anti
trust sentiment among the people. How
much of sincerity there is in Mr. Mc
Kinley's utterances will be shown by
the attitude toward the trusts of the
administration leaders in congress.
Wheeling Register.
The president alludes to the Filip
inos as rebels, thus intimating that they
have been citizens of the United States.
A man cannot well be a rebel or traitor
to a government to which he has never
owed or acknowledged allegiance. The
president apparently considers alle
giance a purcnasaDie commodity,
worth about two dollars per head.
Grand Rapids Democrat.
Several things that the people would
like to have known, as they are the
government, with the president as
their executive representative, are not
hinted at. There is nothing as to the
rumored alliances that are agitating
the world, nothing about the plans for
keeping the Chine&e door open, nothing
by the way of related facts that was
not before known. Detroit Free Press.
"When he says that all of the amend
ments to the rules promulgated by him
last May had "for their main object a
more efficient and satisfactory adminis
tration of the system of appointments
established by the civil service law,"
he makes a statement widely at vari
ance with the facts. The whole world
knows that he surrendered to the spoils
men on that occasion. Buffalo Cour-
r.
In two words the president's pro
gramme is extravagance and empire.
He perfunctorily reminds congress of
its "responsibilities;" so would we. It
is to congress that we must now turn
for defense against executive usurpa
tion. The president's message is in the
main a long record of change of na
tional policy, wrought" so far on his
own initiative. N. Y. Evening Post.
And what is his recommendation as
to trusts? Simply and solely that con
gress shall give the subject "studied
deliberation" "resulting in wise and ju
dicious action. It is a lame and im
potent conclusion. It would be gross
flattery to call it a statement of policy
or of principle. It is in effect a con
fession of mental vacuity as to a mat
ter of political discussion. X. Y. Times.
In his treatment of the broad ques
tion of a Philippine policy the presi
dent slides easily from unctuous ex
pressions of benevoluence to blows
with the iron heel. The Filipinos are
"insurgents," "rebels," and they must
be crushed.. Mr. McKinley does not
see that these brown men are fighting
for the same right for which our fa
thers of the American republic fought
a century and a quarter ago. Boston
Post.
The message is not a frank, unequiv
ocal declaration for imperialism, but a
verbose and labored effort to conceal
the real purpose to drag the American
republic away from its early ideals,
and, with the glamour of expansion and
high-sounding phrases about the -ob
ligations thrust upon us by destiny, to
blind a liberty-loving people to the
real character of the policy which it
is proposed to enforce. Louisville Dis
patch.
Mr. McKinley practically says to
congress: "The Philippines are an
nexed you can govern them when I
take my military hand off the desola
tion I have made and called peace.1
The president's message is simply a no
tification to this effect. N. Y. World.
President McKinle'y message to con
gress is proof that imperialism has
come to stay as long as the republican
party remains in power; our newly ac
quired territories are to be held under
military government, their peoples not
being- permitted to take part in the
governments by which they are con
trolled; St. Louis. Seoublic
THE MORALITY PARTY.
Tricks and Schemes of the Repub
lican Method of Finan
ciering. It has come to light that the God and
morality party is not in perfect accord
with itself on a question of high finan
cial morality. There is agreement upon
the general proposition that there can
be no real financial morality without the
gold standard, but after that there is
divergence; The nature of the differ
ence can best be understood from a
statement of facts.
In accordance with the general prin
ciple that the honor of the nation, its
credit and its financial well being de
mand that all obligations of the. United
States shall be paid in gold unless other
wise expressly stipulated in the con
tract, and that all possible doubt upon
that point shall be removed, the house
caucus committee has framed a bill de
claring plainly that gold is the sole
standard of valu in this country and
that all bonds and other pecuniary obli
gations, except as above stated, are pay
able in gold.
All that looks very direct and straight
forward. Upon, the general principle
laid down there should be no objection
to it. But we hear that the thrifty re
publicans of the senate do object very
strenuously. They say that- if they
should concur in the passage of a house
bill containing a radical gold standard
provision "they would destroy one of
the best means of refunding the debt
at lower rates." Therefore they "pro
pose to apply the gold standard to fu
ture issues and provide at once for new
gold bonds at a low interest rate which
could readily be exchanged for the pres
ent high-rate, short-time coin bonds."
So the house will virtually pass the rad
ical gold standard bill, but the senate
will .prudently modify it in such wise
that the holder of existing bonds will
think it prudent to exchange them for
new ones expressly payable in gold.
That is to say, it is very immoral and
dishonorable to pretend that existing
bonds maybe paid in silver, and in order
to establish the national credit and re
move all suspicion of a disposition to re
pudiate the just obligations of the na
tion it is necessary to pass a bill declar-
ng that all the bonds are payable in
gold. At the same time it-is entirely
moral so to frame the bill as to make
holders of those bonds think they are
liable to be paid in silver, and therefore
that the best thing they can do is to ex
change them for new ones which are ex
pressly payable in gold.
In other words, the republican posi
tion is that the existing bonds were in
tended to be payable in gold, and that
this is so certain that it- is grossly im
moral so much as to suggest that they
an be paid in silver without dishonor;
f et it is entirely moral to scare holders
into surrendering them in exchange for
others bearing a lower rate of interest
but expressly payable in gold by play
ing on their fears that the old ones will
be paid in silver.
It would seem that in taking this posi
tion the republicans give away their
ase as a matter of morals altogether
and take their stand on the lower level
of policy. If existing bonds are unques
tionably payable in gold it is. morally
wrong to pretend that they are not in
order to frighten holders into giving
them up for less than bonds so payable
are worth, and if they are not so payable
til the republican outcry against those
who have proposed to pay them in silver
has been mere hypocrisy. If the senate
scheme is to be adopted it will be in or
der for the republicans to descend from
their highmoral horse. Chicago Chron
icle.
POINTED PARAGRAPHS.
Judging from what Senator Ban
na said in the Ohio campaign the repub
lican party intends to deal very tender
ly with trusts in the campaign, next
year. The democratic party can do no
wiser thing than to take its stand
against trusts. It can afford to rest
its chances of winning the election on
that one issue. Savannah News.

icised, Secretary Gage accepts the full
responsibility. Toledo Commercial.
"Eanna must go!" is the watch
word. It was uttered in whispers at
first, but now it is shouted through
megaphones. But Mr. Hanna has a deaf
ear for such voices and President Mc
Kinley keeps his mouth shut and looks
wise. It is not forgotten that the pres
ident acted like a rock for Alger up to a
certain time and then turned him down
because the pressure to dismiss him "for
the irood of the party" became too
strong. Cleveland Plain Dealer.
If hostile politicians in Hanna's
party attempt too persistently to drive
him from the helm McKinley's sense of
obligation may be appealed to by the
man who, more than anyone else
brousrht him out as a candidate for
president and secured his nomination
and election. An appeal on this ground
made to the president cannot go un
heeded without laying "the chosen in
strument of destiny and duty" open to
a charge of unrequited affection and
base ingratitude. St. Louis Bepublic.
It will be remarkable, now that
the people have given the republican
leaders a free hand in congress, if they
shall not proceed to hang themselves,

BOND MANIPULATION.
How the Administration Shape
Thlnsra to Help Oat Specs
lators.
For the first time in ten years the gov
ernment is about to reduce its bonded
debt. That is gratifying, of course, but
the circumstances under which the
operation is to be performed do not
speak very forcibly for the intelligence
of our financial policy, however elo
quently they may tell of the astuteness
of the individuals who profit by it.
The secretary of the treasury has of
fered to buy bonds to the amount of
$25,000,000 to ease the money market.
He proposes to pay 112 s for four, per
cents, of 1907, or 111 for five per cents, of
1904. That would release from $27,750,
000 to $28,187,500, if the bondholders
should avail themselves of the offer to
its fullest extent.
Looking at the matter-merely with
reference, to the present point of time,
the secretary's proposition is advan
tageous to the government. The money
is lying idle in the treasury, and by
using it in this way we shall save about
$1,000,000 a year in interest.
But how does that money happen to
be in the treasury. It is there because
this administration and its predecessors
issued bonds for it. The f our per cents.
for which Secretary Gage is now offer
ing 112 were originally issued at par.
That is to say, the government proposes
to pay back $1,128,750 for every $1,000,-
000 it received, after having already paid
$S80,000 in interest.
On some of the other loans the show
ing is even worse. Four years ago Pres
ident Cleveland sold $62,315,400 of foui
per cents, of 1925 to the Morgan-Bel
mont syndicate at a fraction over 104.
If the government should try to buy
back any of those bonds to-day it would
have to pay 130 y2. It is not enough, for
the government to buy or sell bonds
whenever it suits the convenience of Mr.
Morgan and the'interests he represents
it must also buy dear and sell cheap.
Suppose instead of this clumsy bond
arrangement we had a postal savings
bank with $1,000,000,000 of deposits.
Then, if the government had more
money on hand than.it needed, and
wanted to get some of it into circula
tion, all it would have to do would be to
reduce the rate of interest. As the in
terest went down the deposits would
flow out. When the process had gone on,
long enough it could be checked by sim
ply fixing the rate of interest at the
point at which deposits equaled with
drawals.
Or suppose we had the interconvert
ible bond system. There would be no
premiums then and no losses to the gov
ernment on purchases and sales of
bonds. When money became so scarce
that it was worth more than the two
per cent, paid by the government the
holders of bonds would simply take
them to the treasury and receive notes
at par. When they had no further use
for the notes 'they would take" them to
the treasury and get bonds. Thus the
money market would always be easy,
and the government would never be
forced to chaffer for its own securities,
The $1,046,048,850 of bonds we had
outstanding when Secretary Gage made
his offer cost us $40,347,876.80 a year in
interest. Under the other arrangement
the annual interest charge would be
less than $21,000,000 at the outside, and
might run down to nothing, if the de
mand for currency were sufficient.
What does the democratic party think
of currency reform as one of the issues
of next year's campaign? N. Y. Jour

FRIGHTENED REPUBLICANS.
Results of the Lnte Elections Creat
ine Much Uneasiness In
Their Ranks.
Evidently the republicans, no matter
how much they may whistle to keep
their courage up, are pretty thoroughly
frightened over the results of the re
cent elections.
Realizing 'the fact that Bryan, has
gained ground rapidly and that even
McKinley's home state is in danger, the
republicans are now talking about an
early convention.
Recalling the history of the last pres
idential election and the amount of
time, money and printing it took to
stem the tide of Bryan's eloquence, the
republican national committee is said
to be unanimously in favor of calling
the national convention together early
in June.
Another "campaign of education'
must be fought, the trusts must be got
in line and "milked" to the last drop in
the way of contributions to the corrup
tion fund and documents "explaining'
the policy of imperialism must be pre
pared, and it takes time to do all this.
Of course, a long campaign will dis
tiirb business, but the republicans will
have all the business they can take care
of in an endeavor to make the people
believe that there are no trusts in this
country, and that trusts are a good
thing, anyhow.
Time will also be required to demon
strate that the declaration of independ
ence is an antiquated document not
worth regarding by advanced thinkers
and ardent imperialists such as make
up the firm of Hanna, McKinley & Co.
Therefore an early meeting of the
national republican convention is to be
called by the frightened members of
the McKinley cabal. Chicago Demo
