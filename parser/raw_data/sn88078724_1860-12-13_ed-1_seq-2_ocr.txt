Y . New Summary.
Wumbsdat, Deo. 5th. Tie newt to-day
are or dep interest. The indication! are
deoi-tedly for the worst. The oommittee
o( thirir-three who aie to consider the
slavery question has not jet bee o appoint-
d. It is thought, and much to ba hoped
that the Speaker wilt mike bia selections
Irons conservative men, men of serve,
roeo who Late at heart the intareit of the
whole conntrv and who are eaual to the
times. That they will reecue the Repub
Vu from the dangers that imperil it ia
hardly to be hoped. They many gain
time. Thy may arrest the thunderbolt
for a little while, but the storm-cloud is
in the havens above us, heavily charged
with the element of destruction. It is
growing restless sad impatient for its
work. God may arrest it tut man cannot.
' The Republican memoi rs are cool and
seem anxious to save the Uuion at any
cost and at all haiards, but the we ruber
from' the Cotton States are opposed tu
compromise, and are laboring to hasten
on the erisii.
, -la the Senate, to-day, an exciiing de
bate took place. Hale, of New Uamp'
hire, moved to reoonsider the vote to print
the President s Message. In making a
epeeob be severely oensured the President
for not having taken stronger grounds a
gainst secession. This speech gave the
Southern hot heads the opportunity de.
'sired, and Brown, Iveraon.aod Wigfall, iu
rapid succession followed bim with ali the
bitterness, all the uliraism, all the fully
for which these worthies are distinguished
Ivorson, of Ga., wus quiet at firs', but
haughty and defiant i i the end. He ao
cepted the Presidents declaration that se
cession is revolution. "The States un
derstand they do it at. the peril of coime
quences." He did not believe it would
lead to war, but if it does the Souih is pre
pared to motive its enemies with Moody
bsnds hotpiuble graves. He hoped
there would be no war, ibal we would live
in piace.
, The South would regard the North a-
mong the most favored of nations, and so
treat with her, but to remalo in the Union
she would not. No power on earth oould
prevent her withdrawal, "The repeal oj
11 the perianal liberty bill of the North
would be vain. "True, they are obnox
ious but we oare nothing for their practi
cal operation. But we know their exist
enoe shows the feeling of the people.
They indionte two distinct civilisations.
The hatred of the North for the South i
deep as hell, and I Ull my brethren on the
other aide of the floor no lovu is lost be
tween us. Two hostile nutions occupy
this floor. We are ensmie. They did
not come soross this floor to extend us or
dinary civilities, yesterday, nor did we go
to then. We are hostile. The State 1
represent accepts the issue of war or sub
mission." We will not submit. I tell the g-ntlo
men South Carolina will not go alor.e.
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Oeor
tf'a, will all be out by January ICtV, nev
er to return; and ic less than twelve montl s
after our Government will be in operation,
Arkansas and Louisiana will follow. Oi.e
thing only prevents Tes-.-tlnt is dor
Governor, and if he dosN not yield to over
whelming publio sontituent some 'IVxnn
Bru'.us will reach his heart, and rid the
world of ft vile and hoary -bended Uaitor."
Mr. hereon discarded all shams, saying
that the election of Lincoln was no cause
for secession; but the South would not be
govorned by the North, and inleoilod to go
out whilo she l ad strength, not lo wait
until she wus too weak."
Such talk as this, of course, had its bad
effects, besides increasing the exoiiemtnt.
It indicates dearly what the Cotion Stales
meant to do It showed that the election
of Lincoln was a more pretext for se.-es-
aion. That tb Cotton Status wanted a
dissolution of the Union: cause or no cause,
and that they would except no compro
mise. ' Salisbury, of Delaware, dosed the de
bate with s olear, strong, sud oloqueot ap
peal for the Uuion.
' Tbobsdat Dee. 6, The Honso wn the

In reply to this and with a view to in
duee Mr. Hawkins 'o withdraw his ob
j'otior.s John Cochrane, of New York,
made a thrilling and eloquent speech
He said:
Mr. JNO. COCHRANE, of N. Y.
said that he had heard, with a great deal
of regret, his friend ask to be exoused from
serving on the committee. It has been
well said here to-day, in the chaplMn s
prayer, mat the grey shadow ot the dark
mu g of dissolution lies been - extended
ovei our house and country; and so deep
is the gloom that we can soaro-ly discern
one gleam ot light toenail us to trans
sol the ordinary business ol legislation
Meu s minds have devoted for weeks past
to the great and absorbing topic ot con
troversy. which enlist a 1 tliouuhts and
demands of every individual his best ex.
ertiona and his purest emotions nd w.s
doui. It is of importance to '.his issuo
that the Republio should command the
efforts and exertions of all i s ciiifceos. I
Mieve now, in the midst of this crisis,
with the perils impending over the oouu-
try, that tbere is no reason why this Houn;
representing the patriotism end wisdom
of the country, should excuse the gent'e-
man Irom Honda. I believe that from
all parts of this Siale where the people are
looking with solioitute on passing even's,
with anxious eyes, if the voice of hU
constituents could be heard it would be
in tones beseeching and appealing lo
their representative lo stand forward in
this isiue, sud etnd tho brunt of iheoon
tioversy. Ha did not believe with the
genileman it was important t. tlie welfare
of the country that there should bo a un
animous r. pi.rt on tlw subj-ct referred to
the committee; However, God grant that
it may be (applause in the galleries, ao
oouipanied by cries of "order" on the
floor.) God grant tha' it may bo stamp
ed with the unanimity which patriotism
demand. If the oountry is not lo be
saved; if patriotism is not sufficient to
command this glorious result, it is due
that the paople of the United Slates should
know it; it is due to the bunigliled regions
of the country that lbs iao s should b
impressed on their minds, and ignorance
no lunger be pleaded a ao exouso for the
aisle whii-h h-ive brought us to this far-
fnl precipice. If we are not to have a
unaaimous report, to save the country
from the pangs andngony of secession, let
us know what demands am made by one
seoiion of the country from the other,
and let us fuel what is tha puliation of
the country, and lot us answer the exaroi-
artory inquixition that comes from every
imrtei "Watchmen, what ot the niirht "
clearly and conclusively ,whether storms
and madness rule the hour, whether there
is a harbinger ol peace, or whether there
is one gleam of morning in which we may
yet Uisnern tro Stars and oirips floa lng
Iroin yonder dorao, (Appluuso.)
Mr. Garnott of Virginia hastily arose
and cepreca'ed the spplause. He was
greeted with hisses, sod in a rage movtd
ths galleries be cleared.
Mr. Cochrane rosuiusd: "I deprecate,
wiih ali others these testimonials, either
of approbation or of censure, fiom the gal
lei tun or ilia floor of ihia House. Yet, an
an excuse niiirht be found in the charac
ter of i ho ihrme before uh, which appeals

or humble ihey may be in tho lbtpuMio.
ISut it is eminently proper that tho rules

cussod with the gravity its nature diinandi
and that the American Congress, even in
the pauga of dissoluiion, if it ia lo fall,
should iall decently, with its official robes
gaihored around it. I bad not intended

I appeal to him oil the grounds of common

n.emoi'ica of the past; I appeal to him by
ths prosperity and existeuoe of ths sove
reign State of Florida, to remain on the
committee. If tliese apeals are to be in
effectual, I further appeal to . those here

1 ho conservative members saw the dan
g r growing out of the existing excite
ment. They feared ihut other members
fiom the South would follow Mr. Haw
kin's I'Xmiple. Thy desired time. They
hoped by le ling things cool off by per
suasion and rehVoiion, that Mr, 11. might
be brought to waive his objection and aot

j iurned till Monday. '
Mundat, Dec. 10. Not muoli of inter
est transpired lo-dsy. The Sooiitt Stand
ing Committee of last year wus contin
ued. The llomestoad Bill passed its first
reading.
Powell's lesolation on Fodoral affairs
was lakeu up, eliciting some warm die
ousalon. The resolution on motion if Mr.
Collamer was amended by referring to a
special committee.
In the House Mr. Hawkins gavs sddi
liooal reaaons for asking lo bs exoused
from serving on the committee. He said be
regarded the oompoiieiitparts of the Com
mittee as peculiarly unfortunate. lie
orilicised the ooropositioo of the Qommit
lee, especially objecting lo Mr. Davis, of
Maryland, as not a fit representative ol
that Siate; that air who voted fcr Mr.
Pennington for Spesksr, were di!oy to
the rights of the South. , ,
Florida, was a small State, but, never
thelesi, was entitled to all the rights and
immunities of the other Slates. She can
not be forced to remain id the Union, and
ths Southern States are pledged to defend
her in the event of attempted coereioo.
He was satisfied of the unanimity per
vading that State to seek redress of its
grievances in its own way, and by means
of other than Congressional compromises,
which lattet have never accomplished a
successful purpose.
He regretted that the resolution for ths
appointment of the Committee, came from
one of the moM gifted sons of the South.
He gave fair warning that Mississippi,
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South
Carolina, were certain to secede, and to
be followed by Arkansas and Louisiana.
Mr. Vallandinghsm argued that Mr.
Elawkins should be excused, for the rea
son that the committee was raised with a
view to peace. We should not use coer
cion to make members serve.
Mr. McClernand remarked that a troub
lesome future opeaa up before us, but he
did not believe our Government can be
dissolved by the consent of any one of its
parts. There was more strergih in the
government than is geuerally believed
He was amaxed that the Democrats of the
North were excluded from the committee,
but was not willing to excuse Mr. Hawk
ins.
Mr. Siokles, in dispelling the prevalent
delusions, maintained that the Union can
be made perpetual by justice, but not so
instant by the application of force.- He
believed with the city of New Yoik, ihat
'.he power to deal with tbe pending politi
cal questions roBts on the Republican par
ty those who have control of the legis
lation of the Northern Stat- s. Let the
Legislatures be convened, that we may see
in what manner they ais prepared to deal
with the question. . ,
Mr. Shsrmnn, from the Committe on
Ways and Means, reported a bill author
izing the issue of ten million dollars worth
of treasury notes, of a denomination not
less than one hundred dallars. Ths faith
of the United States is pledged for their
redemption. Tbe money is authorized to
be boi rowed from time to lime, as is deem
ed expedient.
Tbe bill, after debate, was passed.
Without taking the question on Mr.
Haw kin's request, (be House adjourned.
Tuksdat, Deo. 11. To-days news are
full of interest, especially to such as love
the Union. The dark and alooiny pros-
preots of the nation are looking up to,
day. The friends of the oountry spoke
and its enemies were overwhelmed at
least so far as argument was concerned.
In the Senate many good things weie
said sud it is hoped muob good will re
sult. Mr. Dixon said "We can't shut our
eyee to the great truth thut nothing
less than the disruption or the Uovern
moot is the groat peril to whioh we are
now exposed. It is enough for us to
know that it wou d be not only a great
event, but in its effects on ths race of
mankind the great calamity ol the age.
Tho controversy on tbe subject of slave
ry had now reached a point where its
honorable, riirht ul adjustment, consented
to by the people of both sections, seems
indispsnsiole to the continuance of (be
Government in Its pressnt form.
Criminations and recriminations are
now useless, nay. dangerous. If possible
the first thing dune should be to restore
i he fraternal spirit which cnee existed.
How shsll this bs done?
By cheerfully and hooeatly assuring to
every seoiion its just Constitutional rights
no seoiion ougnt to ask more none
onclil to offer less. As to what are these
Constitutional rights, that is a suhjeot to
be eonsidersd in a spirit of confidence,
mutual good Will and devotion to the Un
ion, for the preservation or wbioh my eou
s ituents are ready lo make any sacrifice,
any reasonable man asks or any honorable
man can grant oonsislsatly with prinoi
pis. In this spirit I shall meet this great
question, and in doing so shall bs sus
tained by an immense majority of my oon
stiiuonts.
Mr. Uigler said he would go with any
party who would devote themselves to
the great work of ressuing tha oountry
from impending ruin. He was lor the
Union as made by our fathers-for the
Constitution and the Union. ' Mr. Iverson
ii is la at ft .
mowed mm in ins usual nre-eating
style. He said (Le South does not leai
tha operation of Personal Liberty Bills,
but - feared mob law the most.' He de
nounoed amendments to' the Constitution
as worthless.. , He thought emancipation
would ultimately result from Northern
success.
A general running debate ooourred in
lbs Senate between Iversun, Green, Pow
ell sad Mason on one side sod Douglas,
Pugh, Fitoh, and Wade on the other. It
will be gratifying for our roadsrs to learn
that Douglas, Pugh, and Fitoh gave the
lie to the contemptible oharges they them
solvss have so of en oiiculated, that the
fugitive slave law was readered inopera
live by reason of Northern opposltbo.
They eome up for ones manfully to the
support of the North and failed for onoo lo
misrepresent tha sots and iotereetsot their
constituents. Pugh said: "I oontradiot
that the fugitive slave law is trampled un
der foot." In reply to a ohsrge of Iver
son, '".hat in the single State of Virginia
100,000 worth of slave are lost aona
ally by their being fugitives," Mr, Pogh
said that he did not. believe all the States
have ever lost $100,000 hj their fugi.
tives." - , . .,.,.,.
We are glad to ao Mr. Pugh, who here
tofors has bten foremost in misrepresent
ing northern sentiment sad northern' in
stitutions, eome up to the work., It will
do him good now and hereafter,

We quote the essential portion of the com
muuioatioo: ......
Mb, Editor. Before this reaches you
the majority of your readers will have as
oertained that the "invasion' of the State
by Montgomery, which caused so mush
exititemeut, was, so far as the "invasion"
is conoernsd, the merest pieoa of Mun
obausenism, without any foundation in
train. How tho yarn that James Mont
gomery and hij gang of horse thieves had
"taken Fort Suott," oould cause any ex-
oitemcnt in the Stat of Missouri, is a
myalery; for every one knos that he has
had t ort Scott and all of southern Kan
sas for the last three yeara. You have,
perhaps, learned by this time that the
"thru hundred urmtd outturn who "in
vaded the State," "took Fort fccott," and
"broke up the United States District
Court," have dwindled down to eertain
threatt of Montgomery's and Jenoisoo's,
and about lixtetn vagabond Ab ilitionists
who lurked about fort Sooll for a few
days before the Court wai to havt been
held.
It is (run that Mon'fromery is an an
ti-slavery fanatio, of the John Brown
school and thalhe has been to the North
recently, and returned with - arms of
different kinds. It ia true that he has
distributed those arms to about two hun
dred of hit ragged followers, who scatter
to their dns at the approached of danger
and aro whistled together again like a
fiook of qujil. It is true that Mongom
ery is harboring a few fugitive alave,and
that Jenntson his made certain declara
tions of waging war "upon the curs of sla
very in Missouri,' and it is true that Jen
nison, Montgomery de Co , have recently
shot Moore and Bishop, and hung Harri
son, Hines and Stm. Scoit. And that is
all of it. Bad enough to be sure; but all
these outrages concern the Territory of
Kansas, and not Missouri. Why is it
that the Federal Government has not here
to'ore enforoed the fugitive slave law in
Kansas, and checked the court of the
outlaws there, are matter! I do not now
propose to discuss.
The prompt a tion of our Exeoutive, in
taking step to protect our Western front
ier cannot be too highly applauded or ap
preciated; but the idea of marohlng the
gallant St. Louis Brigade to the South
west, is, to one familiar with the state of
affairs on the border, very amusing. We
want no bt Louis soldiery lo protect us.
I feel great satisfaction in slating that the
militia of my district is fully adequate to
tbe defense of our State against all the
ragged, nigger-atea'ing outlaws that Jim
Montgomery may be able to inaroh against
us. All we ssk of the Governor is to
furnish us arms aud other munitions of
war.

Pront the Herald, Deo. 3d.
Would it not have been wise for the sa
pient Governor to bave beard what the
policy of Virginia would be in tbe coming
crisis, before he struck? .
''The introduction of slaves from the
'bordor States' must be prohibite J. Let
them keep their kIivs property in tbeir
own borders, and their only alternative
will be emancipation by their own aot, or
by the aotion of their own confederates."
Is this South Carolina doutnne, to be
applied to Virginia? From what quiver
came this venoinedslisfi? We remember
to have read in some speech of Borne dis
tinguished Black Republican some suoli
thought as this: "We will surround
lbs institution with a oordon of free States,
oonGue it wit) in its present limits, and
leave it like s scorpion to sting itself to
death."
In what consists the differeuceof senti
mont except that the one is more figura
tive, but not less insulting than the other
the one emena'es from an open enemy,
the other from a "natmal ally."
The qufstion forces itself upon us: is
this a foreshadowing uf tho treatment we
are to receive at tho bands of our natural
allies in South CUrl'iot? Is this the first
oourss of the feait in which we are in
vited to participate? . Is tins a specimen
of the unity and fra'urnity whi'ili beckons
us from the "ills we have, to fly to loose
we know not of?" If so, it is time for
Virginia to pause aud look well to hor
course.
