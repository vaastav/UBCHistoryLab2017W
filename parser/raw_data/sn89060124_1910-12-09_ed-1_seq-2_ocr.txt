MARYLAND’S BEST CROPS
The lecture train, otherwise
known as the Farmers’ Institute,
that is this week making a pro
gressive tour through the counties
of Southern Maryland, has been
attracting audiences of farmers
all along the route, says the
Baltimore American. The advice
that is being given is generally
based upon results that have been
actually accomplished. An agri
cultural theory is not generally
impressive, unless the man with
the theory can show that what
he says should be accomplished.
The lecturers accompanying the
“Institute on Wheels” seem tc
be of the kind that have been uf
against farming difficulties and
who are, therefore, competent
to talk of the farming situation
as it really is.
The advice is various when it
comes to pointing out the best
money-producing crop for the
Southern Maryland farmer tc
grow. In fact, there is no one
“best crop” for Southern Mary
land or any other section of the
state. Pretty much any one of
a dozen (different varieties of
farm industry may be made a
best money-yielder. There is
room for genius and special
aptitude in farming, as in every
- other art, trade or calling.
While Director Hill has been
showing that it is good for farm
ers of the section to stick to to
_■ bacco as the main crop, other
lecturers have demonstrated
that large profits can be obtained
from growing poultry, live stock,
fruits, garden vegetables and
other foodstuffs.
It seems to be generally agreed
that a greater variation in the
farming industry in the Southern
i Maryland counties is practicable
and would result in a higher
average of farming prosperity.
It is generally possible that a
half-dozen different kinds of
enterprise can be carried for
ward on a farm without inter
- ference one with another.
Farming operations, upon the
whole, however, will always be
in relative proportion to the
— — organizing ability and patient
energy of the man who is man
aging the enterprise. It is the
•man behind the business that
counts in farming as in every
thing else.
PRESIDENT TAFT’S MESSAGE.
Among the most important rec-
ommendations by President Taft
in his second message to Con
gress are these:
He declares it is time to stop
legislating with reference to re
gulation of corporations and to
- witness the effect of a vigorous
execution of the laws already on
the statute books. He believes
f * the activities of the Government
in addition to the enforcement of
the laws, should be directed to
ward economy of admistration,
the enlargement of opportunities
for foreign trade and the
strengthening of confidence of
capital in domestic investment.
He strongly recommends some
form of ship subsidy to increase
American shipping, especially,
to South America.
He urges commissions for
quasi-legislative work, suggest
ing commissions of experts to
aid Congress and the executive
in handling the tariff, rivers and
harbors, public buildings and
waterways.
He defends the Aldrich-Payne
tariff bill; says he will make no
recommendation of tariff legis
lation until the new Congress
convenes; urges that the Tariff
Board be made permanent,
vigorously opposes another gen
eral revision, suggesting that
future revision be made sched
ule by schedule.
The Panama canal should by
all means be fortified. An ap
propriation of $19,000,000 is re
commended for this purpose.
Toll of $1 per net ton should be
charged.
There must be no more “pork
barrel” methods in river and
harbor and public buildings bills.
In the past Congress has appro
priated too much for buildings
i
1 not needed and not enough for
| buildings badly needed.
’ Recommendations for anti-
and Federal incorpo
ration laws are renewed.
* It is proposed that second-class
mail rates shall be readjusted so
* as to charge magazines a much
higher rate on their advertising
i .
sections.
- There should be more officers
-for the army. The Engineer
•t Corps should be increased by 60.
Strong representations are
i- made for the establishment of a
0 new banking and currency
d
a system.
Two new battleships and
- several auxiliary vessels are
urged for the navy.
A Bureau of Health should be
established.
He urges the extension of the
s civil service principal to the diplo
matic and consular corps and the
’ acquisition by the Government
s of residences and offices for its
a diplomatic officers.
s That Congress give some fitting
e recognition of the polar dis
-3 coveries of Commander Robert
y E. Peary is recommended. The
n Secretary of the Navy suggests
i_ that Peary be made a rear ad
y miral and placed on the retired
1 list

[_ OUR WASHINGTON LETTER
® Washington, D. C., December 2,191 C
0 Mr. Editor:
P After a recess and an election event
d ful in American politics, the national
t legislature is again in session in Wash
n ington. It will be a full year, however,
before the result of the recent elections
can be fully felt in legislation, and by
t that time there may be such changes
t in commercial, industrial and political
e conditions that the intention of the
g voters as expressed a few weeks ago
will be modified or in some instances
® nullified. It is an unfortunate condi
* tion that twelve months must elapse
g and a session of Congress intervene
f before the will of the country as ex-
pressed at the polls can be carried in
to effect, and when it is remembered
1 that this condition is fixed in the Con-
S atitution, that fetish of the American
1 lawyer and statesman, it is difficult to
. see how reform mgr be effected.
It is expected that the present session
will address itself to routine business,
1 the passage of appropriation bills and
" necessary non-political measures. The
- President’s proclamation has recom
r mended as a mat'er of course important
j new legislation, but there is little pros
, pect of its being carried out. Nothing
1 much will ue done until after the
> Christmas holidays, and then barely
i two months of the Congressional
session will remain before this Congress,
i on the 4th of March, will be ex officio,
and, as has been said, the new Con
' gress just elected to do and undo so
1 much will not have its chance for twelve
2 months.
f Among the measures that will surely
have a hearing in the discussions under
the appropriation bills will be the sub
-1 ject of the fortification of the Panama
f Canal and there will be a confusion of
- party lines in the debate on this ques
. tion. Some Republicans and some
Democrats will oppose the military pro
gram proposed by the President, while
' other Republicans and Democrats will
* approve it. Mr. Tawney, Chairman of
) the Appropriations Committee, who
t failed of re-election, will urge that the
Canal shall be made a free waterway,
unguarded by fortresses or cannon,
■* while those of the Roosevelt and Taft
t school of politics will insist that a prop
- erty costing nearly half a billion of
dollars and essential to the defense of
our extensive western coast line shall
not be left without adequate military
protection, always, of course, “in the
interest of peace,” as Mr. Roosevelt
. would express it.
[. There is much comment in Washing
ton with regard to the almost oppres
sive silence of Roosvelt since the elec
tion. He has completely disappeared
) from the political firmament, and now
. instead of headlines and columns on the
j first pages of the daily papers, there
is not even a paragraph of a caricature.
1 The explanation is that he has probably
1 given a tip to his friends, reporters
I and caricaturists (for between him and
; them there has been a loyalty mutual
? and ideal) that they shall give him an
indefinite term of exclusive privacy. It
would not be bad for Mr. Roosevelt’s
political future if he should let his
I beard grow, take the Canadian route
i to Van Couver, sail on the Express of
? India line to Yokahoma, and spend the
next two years in Japan, China, the
Philippines, Java, Straits, Settlements
! and India., returning to this country in
I time to mix in the next Presidential
election, either as principal, or
assistant. Travel, -observation,
and meditation will be good for
even so well equipped a man as the
1 only ex-President of the United States,
i It is said that an effort will be made
i by the Postmaster General, backed by
the administration, to pass a bill re
ducing postage on sealed letters to one
cent and also to carry into effect the
long opposed parcels-post privileges
enjoyed by all foreign peoples, but
, through the influence of the express
companies withheld from the citizens
of the United States. The American
citizen living in Washington may send
a ten pound package by mail to London,
Paris, Berlin or Vienna, he cannot send
the sario peccage to Baltimore, only
one hour distant, or to Philadelphia or
New York, four and five hours distant.
If the package should weigh only four
pounds he can send it by mail for 64
cents to any of these cities, but the
I four pounds to the European destina
tion costs only 48 cents. The Post,
office Department is not responsible
for these outrages. They are the re
sult of the monopoly which the expiesi
companies through their influence in
the Senate and House have been ab’e
to maintain in the distrbution of pack
age by mail. In other words, the ex
press companies will not be able to
maks so much money if the people of
the United States shall insist upon
t
• having" as good a parcels-post service !
jbetween Phila ielphia and (. incinna'i, j
for example, as they have to Berlin or ,
Paris.
