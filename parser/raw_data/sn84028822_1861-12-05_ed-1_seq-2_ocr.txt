Morroir county. Deputy Marshtl IltiinKR, or Clti
cbnttl, In comptny with Mr. Redick nnd others
icnt to tlio residence of JaSIes IIammjnd to arrest
a F tef'ive Sfave, for whom they lud a warrant
lalllngtolind tlic negro there tlicyteU the House,
Word was soon spre.td over that negro and negro-
loving nelaUiwliood that jlavchutitrrs w, to nb-jtit,
nnd some 30 persons, among" whom was Gobdo.V,
cw,grcgatcd on the Railroad nheic milr.R and
Uroick were ovcrtatien by them. After tho Ab
olitlonlsts and nogrofj fi.td icmle putKlry llncaU
".'hanging, shooting, Ac. they rtilpped II. and It.
of most $f their clothing, nnd robbed them of all
their money and anu, and then tho negroes, tnl(
luf turns at them, whipped thorn nearly to death
with beech gads, and Gordon nnd others all the
nhlloaggcd the negroes on In Ihclr wicked woiV.
After this their heads were thaved, and thoy were
turned loose; but not until Gohijoi had adminis
tered them a Higher Law lecture, nml an obligation
to the effect that neither of them would ever again
attempt to executo tho Fugitive Slave Law or
vote a Democratic ticket. This, In biicf, was
Gordon's otlVnco.and tho punishment is generally
coofidered luadeqii.tto to It. Our extremely pat
riotic neighbor of tho Hcpulliean, who fatois
NiggrfoM prosecution of thu war, Is not satisfied
that Gordon should bo punUhed. Tftw llipiiliUciin
of tart week says
"Tho trill of Rcr. Goorgo Gordon fur re-dsling
the enforcement of tho fucitlvn sluvo law. tennl-
atcJftt Clovelatid an Monday Inst in a ttnlict of
guilty.
Wo hope the day is not f.ir distant when theio
will bo neither fugitive shit e law nor occasion for
ono In this countiy. 'flic ppeiit oio is so odious
tliat no mail with a grain of huinmnty could lefraiu
fiom leslstliig it when tha occnrlon ofl'tfis."
Our neighbor, like u majority of tlio Hepiiblicans
of this county, Ulkj like a rank ah)'.UIomt. Ilu
would illspciica with thu necessity for it fugitive
(lave law by abolishing slavery und Hooding the
North with negroes. The piesent law Is doubtless
odious to many persons, especially to those who
are engaged either directly or indirectly In steal
log1 negroes, but so long as i t is the law of the Inn
every loyal man, etciygood citizen, will rcfiuiu
from giving aid or comfort to ils resistance.
Two years ago our neighbor said through tho Ilr
publicum
"We bono tile Northern Republicans will re
main Aim, ant if tho IJniim inuU go, why, let her
oiiue.
Now ho says no mini with a grain of humanity
will refrain from lesisllug one of the laws of the
I'ultod State, passed by a Demoeratio Congress,
Hatiutlcncd-by a' Whig. I'lvoident, and which no
lllack Republican Congress h is not cr attempted
repeal. livery candid mat, must uieasuio tmr
neighbor's fidelity to tint tjotiui by tho conip.irallvn
V.iluu ho placed on itand tho lepublie.iu paity two
yuir.s age, and li.v Ills disrespect of thu laws at tho
present time. It is a deplorable fact that the Ad
ministration has uioro traitors to the country In
jsist olliccs than it has in tlio national piLsous.
Knights of the Golden Circle
On tho cvo of tho late election a terrible excite
men was raised by thu Republican tilc.kstcrs about
tho distance of a furmldnblo secret disunion or
ganization in Ohloi-Uiiown an tho Knights of thu
Golden Circle. The humbug was stalled in Matloii
county. Allidavlts weru made, on which many
men wcro invested and held lo answer at tho U.
S. Court under heavy bonds. Two men In Ma
rion comity testified, in tho pieliuiluary cxamtu.i-
rttion of tho licensed, to tho exlstanco and criminal
character of tho organization mid to tho connection
of prominent eltUens with It. Ouu of these wit-iiessca-shortly
after (jlt'hig this testimony beu mil
Insauu and H' continued until Iio died, and thu
other ono fled thu country. No doulit uxlsls
their hating been guilty of pcijury at the hulancu
of candidate for ollloe. On the first day of thu
present term of tho United .Stalls Com I tho men
arrested from Marion county wero dhchtrged.
Tho reason assigned for their dlschargu was that
thoro was no-oridtneo against Ihcui. A number
ofmeii wero nrrotted hi Morrow enmity) altera
thorough investigation by a number of persons
entrusted with that duty, it largo majority of them
being Republicans, It was unanimously concluded
that the facU did not sustain tho asserted eilii'inee
of that orany other treasonable teem oYgairfjalion.

I he Ingato Jwrara tried hard to
come, but her reception was too hot, and
shu bad to back out.
The only loss of life (hat we can loarn
of is (hat of a privato of the L msiaiia reg
ulars and the wife of a sargennt of tlio
Marino corps both killed by a bholl in
the Navy Yard.
Agieat many shot and shell fell in tho
navy yard, but did little damago to tho
buildings.
Our guns wero woiked all day and
must have told with terrible effect upon
the other bide. The gieatest damage
dono was to ono of thu t-hips which
ventured too near 0110 of our batteries.
The editor then proceeds wilh a tirade
of abuse agniiiil Yankees in general and
Col. Hi own in particular. Uo speaks
of the latter as follows: Hut tho inean-
jut nml col,iolllptijIo nct WM t)lu

diels, Harvey lirowu, that ho would not
lenpect hospitals.
Ouu m1is lyis ho well aimed at (bo
building that it wuut through but did
no damage. Tito baseness of this act
places this Imokgiiaid below tlio lowest
out-throat and vagabond ol'N.w Yolk.
