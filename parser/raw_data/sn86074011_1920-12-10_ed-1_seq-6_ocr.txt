Gongressman-elect John E. Ran
kin and Major J. L. Finley have
formed a partnership for the prac
tice of law in Tupelo.
Congress convened Monday and
it certainly is devoutly to be hoped
it will enact some legislation that
unfastens the lid on the strong box
of finance and allow the money
that is tied up in the Federal Re
serve banks of the country to trend
in normal channels. Tight money
makes "tight times." Relax the
money and times relax. Thus may
we all prosper together.

would experience as bewildering anj
awakening as Rip did when he
opened his eyes and found his dog
gone, his rifle rusted and his house
hold disintegrated. The evidences
of oil may be a fable, eo was Rip,
but fables point morals and truths.

section has the business of farming
presented less attraction to the
muscle and brawn of the country
than it does now. I he high price

most every character ot tarm pro
duction is discouraging indeed to
the army of workers who must earn
tneir bread by the sweat of their
brows. Optimists prophesy that
"better conditions will prevail when
the equilibrium of adjustment be
tween the money forces and the
labor forces of the world have been
established. It is difficult for the
average man to see it in that light.
He is a Doubting Thomas by na-
ture, because his doubts have been
realized so often heretofore. But
that is neither here nor there. The
man who controls the money must
unloose the medium that ties up

Mrs. Thweatt had washed the
family laundry Monday afternoon,
and on account of rain, not being
able to dry it outside, she hung the
garments in the kitchen, near an
oil stove, which "unwisely was left
burning when she and her husband
retired for the nieht. The theory is
that the stove exploded, igniting
the clothing and spreading the
flames over. the entire building.

- Mr. Thweatt, with his family had
just recently moved here from l
Kentucky. He contemplated buy
ing land in this county, but had
planned to rent next year in order
to become better acquainted with
the methods of farming in this ter
ritory. He had left his children in
Aberdeen and arranged for them to
attend the city public school, and
he and his wife were living alone
in the building that was burned,
The children were to join them so
soon as some necessary repairs on
the home were made.
Mrs. Thweatt's body was brought
to the undertaking parlor of Lann
& Carter in this city, and a post
mortem examination made, after
which it was laid away in Odd
Fellows' cemetery, funeral services
being conducted by Rev. M. F.
Harmon, of the Christian church.
A coroner's jury was impaneled
Wednesday morning and continued
its investigations until lbursday
evening and adjourned to reassem
ble before announcing a verdict.

were on the grounds all day with
the registration books, giving op
portunity for the women of that
section to register. Each of them
made an address in the afternoon.
expressing their ideas on the neces
sity and maintenance of the Red
Cross; also giving their views on
women yoting. strongly urging that
every woman should register and
yotef that it was a duty to our
country since the law was asking it;
also a Christian duty to themselves,
their children and the future South
land. Another feature of th9 afternoon
program was the reading of a poem,
"Woman Suffrage," composed and
read by Mrs. Stella Houston, a
former pupil of Rocky Bluff some
twenty years ago.
Last, but not least, was an ad
dress by E. B.. Carter on "The Su
preme Things of Life." Mr. Car
ter was not limited to time, and he
spoke one hour or longer, but every
thought he presented was very prac
tical and interesting. He surely
could never be called a pessimist.
Some were heard to say after lis
tening to his speech that "his talk
would knock out the blues, even
as conditions are now." Mr- Car
ter has made several educational
addresses to different schools this
year. The writer has heard him
more than once, and they were all
good.
The writer would like to ask one
question: Are fathers and mothers
going to turn" a deaf ear to such
facts and inspirations concerning
the making of men and women of
their children? Read Deut. xi, 19,
and put into practice what this
verse teaches that in the daily
pursuits of life act and teach the
principles of manhood and woman
hood.
WOMAN SUFFRAQE.
BY MRS. STELLA HOUSTON
This problem seemed a serious note
To give the women a right to yote:
8ome men, it seems, were not content
To give us a voice in government.
In Red Cross work we did our bit.
We never let opportunity slip:
Even crossing ocean's foamy brine.
We ventured near the firing line.
When our nation's honor was at stake
We helped to bear its coming fate;
Stood for right to conquor wrong.
And won. Our flag still is waying on.
When -bonds or bondage was the call,
We did not from our duty fall.
But pledged our all for country's sake

To save them from a threatened grave
Now. if we must the laws obey.
Should we not have a right to say
Who make the laws and plan the way.
The same as men wno live today.
I think it right that we should vote,
And help to steer the nation's boat.

We'll do our best for good goverment.
We do not think the ancient way
Is good enough for U9 today ;
Let's practice a new and wiser plan.

We'll not be bribed ; but firmly stand
For the best in our native land.
Then men. be glad and shout hurrah!

One Who Was Present.
A few days ago Mr. Thomas Blair
killed a hog that weighed 500
pounds. The hog was ,16 months
old. Mr. James Jaudon killed an
other that also weighed 500 pounds
and Mr. H. J. Easter killed three
hogs that weighed 400 pounds
each. These gentlemen are planters,
residing in the Bartahatchie river
section of Monroe county. How
is that for big hogs ?
We understand, and belieye it to
be true, that County Registrar W.
T. Ware will gladly have the regis
tration books at any public gather
ing composed chieflly of women, if
they will signify a desire to register.
and will notify him of the time and
place of th8 meeting. We under
stand Mr. Ware has done this here

there is no place to stand still.
To live is to go forward: to die is
the reverse. Don't die: live and
go forward.

LEASES WANTED.
a
We want leases on all the land from the Iron Bridge at
Aberdeen, to the Cockran bridge, south of the Grubb Springs
and Aberdeen road, between the Tombigbee and Butta
hatchie rivers.
We take this opportunity to say we feel that we are, in
a small wa3 responsible for the advance in land and other
developments of the east side. We have several thousand
acres of this land now under oil and gas lease, and with the
co operation of all the land owners in this section, we areHin
a position to get some oil and gas tests made in this territory
without any cost or speculation on your part, but if oil or
gas should be found in this territory would make it very
profitable indeed to the land owners.
When in Aberdeen come to see us within the next thirty
days ane we will fully explain our project and proposition to
you. Office Harrison Building, over Maier's Jewelry Store.
