i ue8")ay evening, decemeee 2.
Mr Harbison's message only corrobo?
rates the troth of what has been paid of htm
ever since be entered the White House?
thu he is not a national, bat a sectional and
p viisan President. The voters of the Norl h
not Ssnth aiike, and republicans as well as
de jccrat^, by a majority of over six huo
drei thousand, have recently declared
aga'nsl the urjust, unequal, injurious and
eec .ionai rceisurea proposed by him and hie
alvisors, but he insists that eaob. and a 1 o*
thos? measures shall be forced through Con
gr.ss by the prrs>nt small but arbitrary re?
publican majority ia that body. According
tobirn, no change must b-j made in the tariff,
no low rate interest bouda ba issued, and no
"let up" take p'sc? in pois on bills, but fuo
Bldies to ship owners mu;t be granted, and
th.9 Fore* an.1 ^apportionment bills must
bs paBSed?the latter upon a census knowD
of all men to be fa'so. Knowing that ho
ao possible cbance of rsnomination, Mr,
H-.rrisoals evidently trying to make the
repuVicin p*rty so uopopu:ar that nobody
it may nominate ran bn elpo'ed.
That the President not cn'y did not
write hie message, but did not even tak? the
I rouble to read the different parts of it writ
Ii n by other people, and put them in accord,
i' p'a:n to be seen by the fact that in the
paragraph ca siiver he eayp; ' The incre*s-?
of monfty in cironlation during the nineteen
months baa been ia the aggregate $93.866,
S13. or l1)'u; J1.50 per capita, and of thisic
or?.'.:::- culy $7,lO"\000 w&e due to the rec;u(
s. ver legislation;" while in that on the tai
if bo says : "The tnlargt mont of our cur?
rency by the silver bill undoubtedly give ao
u ?ward lern e icy to trade and had u mark?
ed ?lL-ct on ptiees ; but this natural and dc
eir.-d effect of tho silver legislation vrai by
m*py erroneously attributed to the tariff
ac .'' Such contrary statem?ats in the same
p*p r make the whole m??3*ge ridiculou-1,
but they only efford another glaring iuetance
of the slipshod wsy in which matters e:e
coiducted by the republican administration.
General Gkant odco said whenever the
i ubiicana were defeated the democrats
always came to th&ir relief, or words to that
? flecS, aod s&veral instances go to prove thai
h was right. Far the sake of the country,
find all parts of it, it Is hoped that it may
m: be po now. But it must be confessed n?.?
present indications point that way, for the
?oria! assaults mad-s by some detii.-.c a s
upon tho democratic organization tfX' w
Y :rk city upon which the vote of the State
of N w York depends, end upon 1(8 favorKe
tor the next P.csldency, are by no means
?nlculateJ to make Tammany enthusiastic
i i the scrport of the man whose cdmirere
p.re making these asEauits, if he bo the
nomine?.
PaisiDENT Hakeisjn Insists that a nn
j Tity shall rule ia the South as in the Norib,
igoorinp; the fact that no matter bow the
m j>rity shail be composed in the North,
ths rulers would be intelligent white men,
while in many counties and districts in the
South, and even in several of the southern
BtaSes, the mnjirity bring composed of ne
g'ces, tho rulers woo'd necessarily be ignor?
ant and vicious members of that raoe. But
Mr. Harri?oa is too narrow-minded, b'goted
and prejudiced to seo any but his own side
of eny question.
When President Harrison was inaugu?
rated be said be would appoint no man
P03tmfts!or in the South who was not a rep?
resentative of the more reputable people of
the vicinage. Ke says in his message that
postefficaa in the S.ub in charge of post
Eiisters o'j actionable to the people eervetl
with nr.il thereat thai! be olosed. Mr. Zia:
risoo. egraos with b's friend, Commissioner
Eiutn of the pension bureau, now under
rthargt-3 of bribery and corruption, that a
modern poliiic-ian can't afford to be ccns; -?
ent. _
Thr republican S.nators haviDg, by a
unaoitn-us vote in caucus, determined to
taks up at once and pu^b the immediate
passage cf the Fotc-o bill, even if to do so It
he nec2?sary tr> revolutionize the rules of the
boly of which th.-y are members, their
democaic csllengnea will be pot to their
tru-nps in order to defeat the dangerous and
injurious bii! referred to, and lively tlmst,
may soon bs ezpecied on the ? jor of the
Senate.
Themrmhkks ot th? Farmers' Allia:ce
ru^ht to kuow th?-ir own business best, but
other people ?i.d i bard tounders'and why
oome of the more promit eat men in the con
lion of that orgaoiz?ion now tilting in
Flcrid'i, were the open and avowe.l sup?
porters of Mr. Calboun, the railroad lawyer
and wrecker, for U. 6. Senator from Georgia,
against the gallant soldier and farmers' trut?
f.iecd, Gen, Gordon.
In 1SSD President Harrison made a speech,
in which he said : "I have taken pieasure in
knowing that the prospects of this harvest I
wil! aid us in preserving the country egainst J
the democratic party as the greatest enemy
th? country has." This is bad for the coun?
try, aa, according to the returns of the re?
cent election, it is in the bands of ita enemies
by more than six hundred thousand ma?
jority. _
President ?ar?ison, wnen he publicly
?'thacked God be wes not born in the
Sooth," evidently Lad in mind the con?
dition the South would be in under the
operation cf tbe Force bil', wbicb, be tnris?a,
most b3 passed during tbia arsdon of Con
:". 98, fo that it can. nof ba repealed until
:be dToocrais get pcs;65s!t>n of both branch?
es of that b dy.
Tkk recall of .11 r. M ziotr. the Arnericau
IV. A itr tu G uit^tuala, for the part be took
in the murder of Uoneral Barrundia, is not
the lese gratifying becau-e the country was
firs', informed ofit by tha President's message
yesterday, thereby showing that the admin?
istration can keep a Becrei wbon it wants
to do sc. _
Thzue were o^er twenty thousand women
voters in Boston in 1SSS, but less than eight
thou-atid ia 1S90. Representative Lodge
acd Senator iloar of Massachusetts should
formulate a bil!, and urge Kb passage by
Congress, to prevent the suppression of fe?
male it?rege in B >*ton.
The President and Secretary Blulue may
understand, ar;d therefore not like each
other, bLit tho former, in his message, took
ea.oecial care to endorse and approve tho
Uttei'd ideas cc the Pan American Congress
an I on reoiprocity with the countries south
of tho Uaittd H?tt a.
Mk bayabd says "tue democratic party
should send its demagogues to the rear."

Republican Senatorial Caucus
The republican Senators yesterday even?
ing held a csoru? to oorslder the order of
bceines?. The main topic of diacusaion was
tho national electees bill. The friecda of
the measure recalled to Ibcir fellow Senators
tfc e imp'le 1 pledge fjven ut tbe caucus last
eesaton?that the bill, if allowed to go over
until the renalemb'irg of Congress, wou!d be
teki n up a?.d prs?sa;i to a fical vote, wi'h
rut th? intervention of other business. Tboy
urged tbat tbe time* bad ccmo to redpem the
pledge sr.d that tbe Sfnate shtu d at once
proco! d to the cocridaraticn of the bill. C-. r
tain S.Tja-nra who have b?en in the cast eet
down as opponents of the elections bill, or
who, at ha-'f, were supposed to be lukewarm
in its suppor% objected, not to Ibe general
principle ef the bill itself, bot to 'be adop?
tion of a policy that, in their judgmen*,
wou'd probably result in blocking all other
important legislation during the remainder
of this Congress without guarantee of a suc?
cessful termination of the attempt to pasa
the elections bill. Several western Senators, j
j however, icsisUd that, wiih a proper spirit
I of determ'nfition on the part of the mejori
I ty, the bill ecu d be rasssd. After a lorg
discussion the caucus agreed tbat tbe elec?
tions bill ebnli bo teke-n up in tbe Senate to?
ri ty, with the ULderstanding tbat it shall be
kept before that body until finally acted
upon. Furthermore, to guard against ex?
pected oppositii n from the democratic mi
ncri'y iu the line of dilatory tactics, a com
ralttff- of tit-a Senaters was appointed to cc
opt-isfe with tbe repub:ican raemhera of the
committee on rules In the preparation of a
