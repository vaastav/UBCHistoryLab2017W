Republicans should not be discour
aged. The Democrats ate crow for
twenty-four years and see what
mighty strenghth it gave them.—De
troit Free Press.
A Traverse City man promised an
old maid of that town to find her a
husband in case of Cleveland’s elec
tion. If he wants to fulfill his prom
ise, he’ll probably have to take her
himself.
The New York Herald candidly
ays; “President Harrison has made
his message a very interesting and in
structive public document.” This is
In marked contrast with the sickly
whine of The World.
#
Democrats who expected that the
administration and the Republican
senate would jump in and help them
out of the lurch are disappointed in
the president’s message, and in the
attitude of Republican statesmen.
President Harrison’s message
says to protectionists everywhere:
Stand by your guns! The enemy will
be so demoralized by the rich fruits
of a temporary victory that he will
be easily overcome and routed in the
next fight.
is reported that Cleveland has
hired Muldoon. the wrestler and
trainer, not especially to teach him
tile manly art, bur to reduce his
avoirdupois. The former acquirement
however, may not come amiss when
the horde of office-seekers Urea k in
upon him after next Ith of March.
‘■‘What the people immediately de
sire,” says lae Boston Herald (Dem.)
is the repeal of the pernicious silver
bill passed by the first congress of
Harrison’s administration.” A bill
for its repeal was introduced by Con
gressman Lodgeof Massachussettsat
the last session, but the Democratic
majority refused to act on it. Will
they act differently this session?
Doubtful.
What will the Democratic party
do with the proprosition to admit
the three new free silver states, Ariz
ona, Utah and New Mexico? With
six senators from these states the
United States would be on a free
silver basis sure enough. Free coin
age would have an absolute two
thirds majority and then what would
become of Cleveland’s views if con
densed into a veto?
Cable reports from the tin making
town of Swansea, Wales, state that
if the American demand for tin plate
ever returns there will be prosperous
times in that town. The tin plate
liar should consider this. It means
that the American demand for tin
has left Swansea, and that it is now
being supplied by tin made in this
country. The tin plate liar must
either revise himself or run the risk
of a fatal encounter with the fool
killer. —New York Press.
The first diplomatic act of Arch
bishop Satolli, Papal arbitrator at
large to the United States, is the res
toration of Dr. Edward McGlynn to
bis faculties of a priest in good stand
ing. Dr. McGlynn was excommuni
cated in 1887 for refusing to go to
Rome after his suspension by Arch
bishop Corrigan. Monsigno Satolli, in
the settlement of difficulties between
priests and their bishops, has power
without appeal to Rome. In trying
every case he is to be assisted by
two priests of his own selection.
For cure of a sprained back a com
jplete success—Mr. Jerome M. Kaley,
Massillon, 0., says: “I have been us
ing Salvation Oil for my sprained back,
have found it a complete success, and
am perfectly satisfied with its results.”
From Montana, Wyoming and
Kansas come complaints that the
Republicans are trying to steal a sen
atorship in each state. There is no
proof that these complaints are well
founded. Indeed, they are probably
baseless. Republicans, however well
they would like a senatorship in
•this or that state, do not want a
majority in the senate. Of course
Republicans would never steal sena
torships. They are particularly un
likely to steal when they have no use
for the stolen goods.— Sentinel.
A Much Married Woman.
Mrs. Fowler, of this city, was mar
ried last January to her sixth husband,
and strange as it may seem, five of
them died exactly two years from their
marriage day. Her present husband
has been sick for the last four months
with chronic jaundice, and was given
up by four of our best physicians; as &
last resort he began using Sulphur Bit
ters, and yesterday told our reporter
that they had saved his life, smilingly
laying that he guessed Mrs. Fowler

BO YOU WANT TO ADOPT A BABY!
Maybe you think this Is anew business,
sending out babies on application; it has been
done before, however, but never have those
furnished been so near the original sample as
this one. Everyone will exclaim. " Well!
that’s the sweetest baby I ever saw I” This
little black-and-white engraving can give
you but a faint idea of the exquisite original,
" I’M A DAISY."
which we propose to send to you, transpor
tation paid. The little darling rests against
a pillow, and ia in the act of drawing off its
pink sock, the mate of which has been pulled
off and flung aside with a triumphant coo.
The flesh tints are perfect, and the eyes follow
you, no matter where you stand. The exqui
site reproductions of this greatest painting of
Ida Waugh (the most celebrated of modern
painters of baby life) are to be given to those
who subscribe to Demorest’s Family Maga
zine for 1893. The reproductions cannot be
told from the original, which cost S4OO. and
are the same size (17x23 inches). The baby is
life size, and absolutely lifelike. We have
%lso in preparation, to present to our sub
jeribers during 1893, other great pictures by
such artists as Percy Moran,Maud Humphrey,
Louis Deschamps, and others of world-wide
renown. Take only two examples of what
we did during the past year, “AYard of Pan
sies,” and “ A White House Orchid ” by tl’O
wife of President Harrison, and you will see
what our promises mean.
Those who subscribe for Dcmorest’s Family
Magazine for 1593 will possess a gallery oi ex
quisite works of art ot great value, besides a
Magazine that cannot be equaled by any in
the world for its beautiful illustrations and
subject matter, that will keep everyone post
ed on all the topics of the day, and all the
fads and different items of interest about the
household, besides furnishing interesting
reiding matter, both grave and gay, for the
whole family; and while Demorest’s is not
a fashion Magazine, its fashion pages arc per
fect, and we give you, fret of cost , all the pat
terns you wish to use during the year, and
In any size you choose. Send in your sub
scription at once, only $2. and you will really
get over $25 in value. Address the publisher.
