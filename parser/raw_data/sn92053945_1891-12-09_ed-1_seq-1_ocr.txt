Springer or Holman Likely to Hend the
Appropriation and Bland the Coinage
Speculations as to Other Chairman
ships The Question of Kales Demo
cratic National Committee to Meet
Jan. 21 Resume of Senate and House
Proceedings The Anti-Sub-Treasary
Men Official Notes.
Washington-, Dec. 9. As soon as the
speakership contest had been settled the
members began to speculate as to the
probable formation of the hoiice commit
tees by Speaker Crisp. As Mills was the
chief competitor of Crisp for the speaker
ship, the chairmanship of the ways and
means committee will probably be ajjain
offered to the Texas member, though if
s-me of the ardent supporters of the suc
cessful candidate could have their way it
is said they would recommend tbe.'appoint
ment of a northern man as the head of the
most important committee of the house.
The Other Southern Members.
It is generally conceded that McMillin
of Tennessee, Breckinridge of Arkansas,
"Wilson of West Virginia, and Turner of
Georgia, will be the southern men likeiy
to-in part compose the ways and means
committee, but it is possible that one of
these may be dropped should Mills be
come the chairman, and by virlue of the
position, leader of his party on the floor.
Tho first committee to be named by the
speaker will be that on rules. It is
thought that Springer of Illinois, or IIol
mau of Indiana, will I one of the mem
bers of this committee, Kither Mills or
McMillin will likely be another Demo
cratic member of the committee.
What the Kules Committee May Do.
It is conceded that ex-Speaker Reed
will be one of the Republican members of
the committee on rules and either Bur
rows of Michigan or Henderson of Iowa
will stand a fair chance of being named.
The speaker will of course be the other
member of the rules committee. The
talk as to changes in the rules is such that
at this early stage no one can say what
may be done. The prevailing sentiment
among Democrats is that tne party lead
ers will favor a return to a code some
thing like that which governed the body
when the Democrats were last in power.
Speculations as to Chairmanships.
There is some talk of either Springer or
Holman for the chairmanship of the ap
propriations committee. Other specula
tions include the following chairmanships
of leading house committees:
Agriculture, Hatch: postoflices and post-
roHds, Hlount of tleorsia; naval itffairs. Her
bert of Alabama; public lands, Holman of
Indiana, or McK.ic of Arknnsas; invalid jk-c-sions.
Martin of Indiana; fori ik" affair. Mc
creary of Kentucky, or t'hijunaii of Michigan;
libor, Tarsuey of Missouri, or Shivcly of ln-
linria.
The chairmanship of the committee on
coinage will be carefully considered, but
the talk is that the speaker will probably
again appoint Bland.
In Senate and House.

The Boyd-Thayer Case.
VTAsniXGTOS, Dec. 9. The Boyd-Thayer
case, involving the question of title to the
office of governor of Nebraska, and of citi
zenship on the part of Boyd, came up for
argument in the federal supreme court

Washington, Dec. 0. Senators Gorman
aud Faulkner were unanimously re elect
ed chairman and secretary respectively of

meeting of the Democratic senators yes

Washington, Dec. . A meeting of
Italians was to have been held here Mon
day night to take action rela'.ive to the
World's fair, but it did not take place.
Dr. Verdi said yesterday, in explanation
of the fact that the meeting was not held,
that it was considered the better course
for Italians to wait and find out the feel
ing of the president and congress about
the recent New Orleans trouble.
Secretary Foster's Condition,
Washington, Dec. 9 Secretary Foster
continued to improve during yesterday.
The symptoms of his case tended to indi
cate typhoid fever, but these have, in a

WAS A DEADLY CRASH.
ANTI-SUB TREASURY ALLIANCE.
Its National Convention Indefinitely
Postponed by Keiuest.
Washington, Djc. 9. W. S. McAllis
ter, of Mississippi, cnatrman ot tue na
tional executive committee of the ami
sub-treasury Alliance, who has been mak
ing a tour of the states where his party is
strongest, found awaiting him ujion his
return to Washington letters from his
fellow committeemen requesting him to
postpone the dat for a convention called
to meet at Memphis, Tcnn., Dec In. The
call was issued from Indianapolis after a
long debate upon the refusal of the
Alliance supreme council to receive the
protest of the anti-sub-treasury party. It
had previously been determined, in the
event of such action by the supreme conn
cil, to perfect a distinct organization with
e object of "restoring the rarmers Alii'
aca to its original state of fidelity to its
coustitution.
Waiting on the National Alliance.
The request was acted on by Chairman
McAllister, who last night issued a no
tice to members of the anti-sub-treasury
Alliances, informing them that "in obe
dience to urgent requests from many
members of the anti-mb-treasury Alii
ance. the convention called to meet at
Memphis, Tenn., Dec 6, is hereby post'
poned to a date to be hereafter deter
mined." The reasons given for this
action by Mr. McAllister are these
When the call was issued the supreme
council had taken no action on the third
party qnestion. Subsequently it an
pointed ten ty-flve delegates to the third
party conference set lor i-eb. J.1 at St.
Louis, Mo. Notwithstanding this action
the national Alliance leaders are denying
that it is their purpose to turn the farm
ers' Alliance into a political party. The
result of the St. Louis convention will de
termine their purpose in rtie premises
hence the propriety of postponing our na
tional convention."

was received at the military headquarters
here yesterday from Miles City, Mont.,
stating that troops had left Ft. Keogh
