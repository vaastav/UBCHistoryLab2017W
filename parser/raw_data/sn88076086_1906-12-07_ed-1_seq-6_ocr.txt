BUILDING A CITY.
A city cannot build itself. It
must be built by men, and by
those men alone who live in or
near it those who make their
homes within its borders or in
the neighborhood.
One man alone cannot build
a city, but one man who is a
leader can do a great deal with
the help of the rest. The people
of a village may possibly see it
grow to a city under favorable
conditions with very little effort
on their part, in spite of their
policy to let nature and the old
town take her course, but this
is a rare case. One good ener
getic leader in whom the citi
zens have confidence, support
ed by the other citizens and
their united effort, is the best
•way to build a city.
The first element is citizen
ship a class of business men
who are noted for their honesty
and high moral character, men
"whose tricks in trade are to tell
the truth men more noted for
their honesty than for the
money they have made, though
it is nothing against a man
that he has prospered.
The second is a true idea of
what builds a city, whether it
is paved streets or horse racing
a water supply or a ball team
a sewer system or a dog show
good roads or grand celebra
tions all cost money, and all
this money is solicited and con
tributed
4
'for the benefit of the
town."
Bottineau is noted for having
the first element, a class of
citizens and business men who
are thoroughly reliable, whose
warranty of all wool is as good
as a check on the bank. But
like most other towns it is
moie or less divided on the
idea of what is best for the
town, whether it is the spec
tacular three days celebration
with an awful good time, or
permanent public improve,
merit. Everybod}7 enjoys a
good time it is true, but when
indulged in too often as a pub
lic function it is liable to cost
so much the people will feel
too poor to pay for permanent
public improvements.
Bottineau should have a
water works and sewer system.
Every citizen admits this fact,
yet all apparently wonder why
44somebody"
don't make a
start. On the hills, only a
short distance away, at an ele
vation of three hundred feet,
are numerous springs that can
easily be brought into the city
in a water pipe, and the springs
are said to be able to furnish
an abundant supply of water
for a population of four to five
thousand people, and the best
spring water in the world, too.
This would furnish a fire pro
tection second to none in the
northwest. Should the popu
lation ever increase to more
than these springs will supply,
the main can easily be contin
ued to other lakes, and event
ually to Metigoshe, which has
has been estimated to be suffi
cient to supply a population of
from fifty to one hundred thous
and. Then too, we have a nat
ural outlet in the creek that
flows through town for a sewer
system. The town could not
be better situated naturally for
the best water and sewer sys
tem in the whole northwest
than it is. All that remains is
to build it.
There is something of a nat
ural antipathy to a private
corporation being given the
franchise, but as the debt limit
of the city is contracted within
the narrow limits precribed by
the constitution there may be
•no other way out of it. A sys
tem built owned and operated
by the city would be best, but
if that cannot be had we should
not necessarily reject the other.
A private company, operating
under a charter from the city,
if it furnished the necessary
water, will be better than none
at all.
This is a matter every citizen
who owns a lot is interested in.
The Courant would be pleased
-to have them express their
views, if they have any,through
its columns.
CAR SHORTAGE.
The question car shortage
has become an important one
in this state. So far we have
watched the daily press and
read the complaints that are
being made, but we are unable
to say what is the cause.
At Bottineau only one of the
six elevators are full. The
only cars the managers are
able to get are those that come
here with loads, and they load
them with wheat.
One statement has it that
railroads have plenty of cars,
but are unable to buy engines
enough to move them. It is
said one of the northwestern
railways placed an order for
120 new engines they just got
2( of them during the year,
and in that time they turned
15 old ones into the scrap pile,
leaving them with a net gain
of 11 engines for the year. It
is also claimed all the available
power is used in moving load
ed cars both ways, making it
next to impossible to move
empty cars for wheat ship
ments.
Whatever the cause, the ef
fect in most sections of the
state is disastrous, and the peo
ple want to know why. If the
roads are doing all that is pos
sible to be done there is certain
ly no cause to complain. If
the cause is manipulation by
those interested, something is
liable to happen that should
not happen.
It would seem there is due
the public from the railway
managers a statement as to
causes, and the prospect of re
lief.
TO SUBSCRIBERS.
This week the Courant sent
out bills for subscription to
those who were in arrears. We
trust every man who gets one
of these will give us prompt
response with the cash.
Your label should show at all
times the date to which you
have paid. Figure from this
date to January 1, 1907. These
labels are changed the first of
each month, and those who
pay during December need not
expect to find their date chang
ed until after the first of the
year.
w-
Anyone who pays duri*ig
December, and don't have his
label changed on the first issue
in January, may come in and
have the error corrected, and
also get his money back.
Pay the bill and watch the
label change.
THE MESSAGE.
The message of President
Roosevelt to congress, which
was read at the joint session
Monday, is given in full in this
issue of the Courant. The
message occupies over sixteen
columns of small type, and con
tains nearly twenty-eight thous
and words.
On the whole it is character
istic of the best citizenship in
all walks of life as typified by
the president himself. It is
well worth reading.
AN EXCHANGE has it figured
out that the insufgents are the
victors in the late state election
contest, and entitled to dictate
the terms of republican peace,
if that is what we are to have
in the presidential election two
years from now. Let us have
peace—and consider the terms
agreed to. A united republi
can effort will restore the old
republican majorities in the
state. To continue the factions
will elect more democrats.
ACCORDING to the Evening
Press of Grand Forks, the fu
ture platform of the North Da
kota democracy is to be John
Burke. The republicans had a
convention at Jamestown, and
ran lagely to personal platform.
The democrats have our con
sent to follow the same tictacs
if they want to, but republicans
can't get fat on that kind of
feed any longer.
That sagacious old bird, the
Bottineau Courant, says that
the state doesn't need any re
forming, that its affairs are ab
solutely alright. The same pa
per says that the democratic
party, as a party, has made no
gains in the state.—Evening
Press.
Well, no one has denied the
allegation up to date.

Pullman company it is claimed
will take over the Great North
ern sleeping and dining car
equipment, and as an evidence
that the change is certain it is
claimed that already many of
the Great Northern cars have
been painted from a green to
the dense black of the Pullman
service.
The question always comes
up: What is a gentlemen?
Some people say he is a man
with a silk hat, and others a
man with a smooth tongue.
But men connected with the
newspaper trade have a canon

Editoa Bailey of the Britt
(Iowa) Tribune, says he has in
vented a patent cow milker
that beats all former inventions
along this line. He says: "We
have just succeed in getting a
patent on an electric motor fas
tened on the rump of a cow,
the electricity being generated
by a small dynamo attached to
her tail. It strains the milk
and hangs up the pail and
strainer. A small phonograph
accomjpaneis the outfit which

Postage stamps of the issue
of 1907, put on sale at 6,000
presidential postoffices, will

reason for this innovation is
said at the postoffice depart
ment to be the belief that it
will help to do away with the
big postoffice robberies and
make it much easier to trace
i criminals. Another reason
I for the change is to enable the
postoffice department to deter

The business men of Mentone
are taking a unique way to get
even with the mail order housed
of Chicago.
They have been payiilg dray
men $40 a month to get the
names of those who were re
ceiving freight from these mail
order houses.
When one of these parties
went into a store to buy any
thing on credit he was refused,
no matter how good his finan
cial standing was. When they
had butter and eggs they were
told to sell their products to
Montgomery Ward & Co.
The result was that the town
was put on a cash basis, and
the people were forced to quit
trading with the mail order
liduses.
The Mandan Independent ex
plains why newspapers are sent
to subscribers after they are de
linquent and says:
4'Every
weekly newspaper in towns of
this size are forced to do this.
Should we stop subscription
when time expires nine times
out of ten the subscribers would
give a "calling down" for in
sinuating that his credit was
not good. Rather than to cast
a reflection against the honesty
of a subscriber to pay a small
debt, it next to a necessity for a
home paper to continue after
the time has expired. It is not
necessary for the city dailies or
weeklies to follow this rule, as
their subscribers live at a dis
tance and are not personal
friends as is the case with a
majority of our subscribers.
Our subscribers should deem it
an honor to know that we do
not doubt their integrity and
continue to send them the pap
er after the time has expired.
Should any desire their sub
scriptions discontinued they
should notify us and remit to
date if they have not already
done so."
Frequently tpyographical er
rors creep into newspapers, and
the result is often humorous,
bringing forth many a laugh,
even on serious subjects. The
Tribune has had more than its
share of these blunders of late.
Last week "we" got three
items "all balled up" in the
rush to get out the paper. The
effect was startling -and if the
Tribune would have been be
lieved the laws of nature would
have to suddenly be reversed.
It was all caused by transposing
a couple of lines of type. J. D.
Curry, one of our most respected
citizens, has been ill for some
time with rheumatism. The
Tribune made the startling
statement thas as the result of
his sickness he had given birth
to a twelve pound boy. As a
matter of fact, that boy be
longed over in the home of
Samuel Cox. In the item re
lating to the birth of Mr. and
Mrs. Cox's twelve pound boy
the Tribune said it happened
"while the whistle blew."
Now, of course, it is possible
that whistle was blowing at the
time, but we doubt it. That
line referring to the whistle
blowing should have been un
der the item about Rile^ carry
ing the dynamite,

IKE the city of New York, the American girl is a most intereat
V ing contradiction. She is regarded as the world's greatest rep
resentative of feminine freedom, who can go anywhere and do
anything without the irritating accompaniment of a chaperon.
And yet, at the root of her character she is the most prudish
of all girls. She makes the best friend for a man and yet his
worst lover. She cannot deny that she is a flirt, and yet she- is
at heart hard and selfish. She will do the most unconventional
things and yet in no part of the world is etiquette more insisted
on than in American society.
The upbringing of the American and the English girl is as far apart,
as New York and San Francisco. An English girl grows up to learn that
whatever else she may bi, she is merely a secondary figure. I remember
a clever English girl once saying that before she realized anything else, she
discovered for herself that whatever she wanted in life she had to get it
through the help of and with the consent of man. Across the Atlantic
it is the reverse. As the American girl reaches years of discretion, she
quickly learns that she is—to use American slang—"it." All the attention,
of the family is concentrated, not on the son, but on the daughter.. And
so, being thus in her youth impressed with her own importance, she insists,
not unnaturally, for the rest of her life on occupying the center of the
stage.
The chief characteristics of the American girl—tact, self-dependenee
and excitable energy—do not commend themselves to most English male
minds. To the American girl the Englishman, as a lover, is-too self
centered and inattentive. And it is another Yankee paradox that-the most
businesslike and powerful American magnate comes second in importance
to his own wife. He will work for a longer day period than any English
man in a corresponding profession, and he must expect but little encour
agement and sympathy from the American wife. True, the American man
jnakes the best of husbands, if by that is meant a ceaseless giving, of
jewelry and a continuous lap-dog kind of attention. She has no real affec
tion for him, if New York society is any test. She has indeed but little
time to see him, with her stupid culture societies, her literary clubs^. her
musical symphony matinees and her outrageous ideas of entertaining
The American woman is indeed adaptable and makes an original: if
sometimes vulgar, hostess. But she is always posing, either socially, intel
lectuially or otherwise. An Englishwoman desires dignified rest, an Amer
ican must have ostentatious notoriety. An American girl would rather
have a dollar box of chocolates from Huyler's on Broadway than a- three
dollar box from any other equally good "store." Her whole aim, is- to
attain rather than to be happy to conquer than to love. She cannot'get
away from the habit of valuing evevy pleasure in so many dollars. She- is
proud of her engagement because her ring cost $1,000, and carue from.
Tiffany's, on Fifth avenue. She is a lover of romance, and yet she is-not
really sentimental.
True, she knows how to jrat her clothes on and .how to hold herself
up. And yet, though she is always well dressed, she and her sisters are
absolute slaves to fashiorj. If the fashion for a red coat comes in, not a
few, but every American girl shopping on Fifth avenue* or Broadway,,wilL
literally paint the streets red.
Yes, there is something very attractive, quite repelling, infinitely
amusing, and never uninteresting, about this nervous, excitable, bright
being. One cannot ever deny that the American girl is a queen among:
women. She is, indeed but she is majestic in marble. She is admirable,,
she is adorable, but she is not lovable—except when distance lends
enchantment to the view.

self-supporting does so in order to relieve others of the burden of her
support she. works to,save others from working for her. And this gen
erous spirit of self-sacrifice cannot surely be called unwomanly! To say
that a woman is unwomanly because she supports herself is like saying:
that a man is unmanly because he refuses to strike his father.
No one believes that women should be idle, but there are those who
think that a woman who remains in her home and who embroiders doilies,
that are as useless to everyone else as they are to herself is "womanly,'*"
although she is as clearly wasting her time as if she were really unoccupied.
Women are individuals as well as men and they possess individual
talents, energies and capabilities. It is on the face of it absurd to assume
that because one-half of the human race are women, they must all do the
same thing. Some women are good cooks so are some men. But when,
a woman not only can't cook, but hasn't the wherewithal to get even a.
breakfast, it is almost too severe to condemn her as "unwomanly" for
doing something else. There are other parts of the world's work to be
done, and if they do the part they are best fitted for they should be praised
and not blamed.
There is something of degradation in the idea of dependence and
something of nobility in the idea of service. There is little work that
women can do in the homes these days that is economically useful. They
must choose between going out of the home and being independent, and
staying in the home and being a burden. In the one case she enters into
the world's service and becomes a "soldier of the common good in the
other case she is served—and probably by those who have already borne
their measure of the world's burden.
There was a day when it was manly for men to wear perfumed ring
lets, lace ruffles and satin knickerbockers there was a day when it was
"womanly" to be pale and anaemic, delicate and altogether useless. Those
days are gone. Womanliness now is measured by usefulness instead of
uselessness, and every woman is "womanly" in so far as she fulfills the
possibilities of service that are afforded her. Of the 2,000,000* women
in our factories, the great majority are there because it is the chance for
work that the world has offered them. The work is not easy and' it is not
always pleasant, but it brings with it the self-respect that is born of
independent self-support. If such work is unwomanly, then service is
unwomanly and womanliness is some
thing to be sconwrfL
Women are womaii^
as men are manly when
they realize the highest
ideals possible to the'in

by high standards ..of
truth and justice and!
righteousness.
