PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow-Citaent of the Senate
and Souse of Representative* :
Another year of health and of sufficiently
abundant harvests has passed. !"or these
and especially for the improved Condition
of our national affairs, our renewed and
profoond gratitude to God is due.. We
remain in peace and friendship witji foreign
powers. The efforts of disloyal citizens of
the United States lo involve us in foreign,
wars, to aid in iuexcosable Insurrection
bave'been unavailing. Her Britapic Ma
jestv's Government, as was justly expected,
have exercised their authority to prevent
the departure of new hostile expeditions
from British ports. TheEmperorofFrauce
has by a like proceeding promptly [indica
ted the neutrality which he proclaimed at
the begining of the contest.
Questions of great intricacy andjimpor
taoce have arisen out of the blockade and
other belligerent questions between the
Government and several of the maritime
powers, but they have been discussed, and
so far as was possible, accommodated in a
spirit of frankness, jastioe aad motuftl
good will. It is especially gratifying that
our prize courts, by the impartiality of
their adjudication, have commanded the
respect and confieence of maritime pow
ers. The supplemental treaty between the
United States and Great Britain, for the
Buppresaifcn.of the African slave trade,
made onlhe lTtb day of February last, has
been duly ratified aud carried into effect.
It is believed that so far as American
ports and American citizens are concerned,
that inhuman and barbarous tr?m?
been brought to an end. I shall snbmit
for the consideration of the Senate a] con
vention for the adjustment of possessory
claims in Washington Territory? arising
out of the treaty of the'15th of June, I846,
between the United States and Great Brit
ian, and which have been the source of
some disquiet among the citizens of'that,
now rapidly and improving [>art of the
country. A novel and important question
involving the extent of the Maritime juris
diction of Spain in the waters which sur
round the Island of Ouba, bas beeo de
bated without reaching an agreement, and
it is proposed in an amioable spirit, to re
fer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power.
A convention for that purpose will be
snbmitted to the Senate. I have thought
it proper to subject it to the approval 01
the Senate, to concur with the interested
commercial powers in an arrangement for
the liquidation of the Scheldt dues, npon
the principles which have been heretofore
adopted in rfgard-to llje imposts dpon
navigation ia the waters of Denmark. !
The lobg pending controversy between
this Government and that .of.Chili,* to urge
the seizure at Silana in Pern, by Chilian
officers, of a large amount in treasure be
longing to citizens of the United States,
has been brought to a close by the award
of His Majesty, the King of the Belgians,
? ? to ^vhQse arbitrament the question was
referred by the parties.
-This subject was thoroughly and patient
' lr examined by that justly respected Ma
jes^y, and although the sum awarded to
nfce claimants may not have been as large
as tbey expected, there ia no reason to dis
trust the wisdom of His Majesty's decision.
That deoision was promptly complied with '
by Chili when intelligence in regard to it ;
reaohed that country. The joint commis
sion under the act of the last session, Tor '
carrying into effect the convention with :
Pern on the subject of claims, has been or
ganized at Lima, and is engaged ia the
business entrusted to it.
Difficulties concerning inter-oceanio
transit through Nlcarauga, are in oonrse
of amicable adjustment in conformity with
principles set forth in my last annual mes
sage. I have received representatives from
' the United States of Colombiu, and have
credited a minister to that republic.
Incidents oocurring in the. progress of
' our civil war have forced upon my atten
tion the uncertain state of international
questions, touching the rights of foreigners
in this country and of United States citi
aena abroad.
In regard to some governments these
rights are at least partly defined by treaties.
Iu no instance, however, is it expressly
stipulated that on the Instance of civil war
a loreigner residing in this country, within
the lineB of the insurgents, is to be Ex
empted from the rule which olasses him as
a belligerent, in whose behalf the govern
ment of bis country cannot express any
privileges or immunities distinct from that
character.
I regret, to sitr, however, that such
claims have been pat forward, and, in some
>. instances, in behalf of foreigners who have
lived in the United States the greater part
of their lives. There is reason to believe
that many persons bom iu foreign coun
tries, who have declared their intention to
become citizens, or who have been fnlly
naturalized, have evaded the military .duty
required of them by denying the fact,
thereby throwing upon the Government the
burden of proof it has bfeen fonnd diffi
cult or impracticable to obtain,
This proor, from the want of guides to
the proper sources of information, might
be supplied by requiring the olerks of
courts where declarations of intention may
be made, or naturalization effected, to send
periodical lisU of the names of persons
naturalized, or declaring their Intention to
become citizen*, to Ibe Secretary of the
Interior, in whose department these names
must be arranged and printed for general
information.
There is also reason t# believe that for
eigners frequently become citizens' of the
United States, for the sole purpose of eva
ding the duties imposed by the laws of
their native country, to wbieh, in becom
ing naturalized here, they ,at oncej repair,
and though never returning to the United
States, they still claim the interposition of
the government as citikehs. Many alter
cations and great prejudice 'have hereto
fore arisen out of this abuse. It is there
fore submitted to your serloos considera
tion. It might be advisable to fix a limit
beyond which no citizen of the United
States, residing abroad, may claim the in
terposition of bis government.
The right of suffrage has often been as
sumed and exercised by aliens under pre*
k tence of naturalization which they have
'.disavowed when drafted into the military
B ' service. 1 submit the expediency of'such
an amendnfent nf the laws as will make
tbe fact of voting an estoppel against any
plea of exemption fiom military service or1
other oivil obligation on grounds of alien
age.
In common with other western powers,
our relations with Japan bavo been brooght
into serious jeopardy through the perverse;
policy of the Tyeoon, designed to tiring the
country into the society of nations. It' is '
hoped, aUbongh,not with, entire confidence,
that these 1difficulties may bfc -peacefully
overcome- I ask - your attention to the
i,ding. there, for the damages
in the destruction by fin of
the reai d?t<*U>B.tne 'fgauoti? ?eddo.
Satisfactory , arrangement* ha*?,.been
made with the Smperor of Russia'which, j
p* >...?? ? - 'Y
It Is believed, will remit In effecting a
continuous Ijpe of telegraph- through that
Empire from oar Pacific ooait. I recom
mend to your favorable consideration the
(abject of an international telegraph acron
the Atlantic Ocean, and also ot a telegraph
between this capital and the oatiooal torts
along the Atlantic seaboard and;the Gulf
of Mexico. Snob connections established
with any reasonable outlay would' be ecou*
omical,as well as effective aid tothe diplo
matic, military and naval ferrice.
The consular systems of the United
States, under the enactments of the last
Congress, begin to be self-sustaining, and
there is reason to hope ibat It may become
entirely so, with the increase of trade
which will eusue whenever peace is-re
stored.
Our iiioisters abroad have been faithful
in defending American rights. In pro
tecting our commercial interests, our Oou
suls have necessarily had to encou'nter
increased labors and responsibilities grow
ing out of the war. These they have, for
the most part, met and discharged with
zeal and efficiency.
This acknowledgement justly includes
those cosnuls who, residing in Morocco,
Egypt, China, and other central countries,
are charged with complications aad extra
ordinary powers.
The condition of the several organized
territories Is generally satisfactory, al
though the Indian disturbances in New
Mexico have not been entirely suppressed.
The mineral resources of Colorado, Ne
vada, Idaho, New Mexico and Arizona, are
growing far richer than heretofore under
stood,y I lay before you a communication
on this subject from tbe Governor of New
Mexico. I again submit to your-consider
ation the.expediency of establishing a sys
tem for tbe encouragement of immigra
tion. Although this source of national
wealth is again following with greater free
dom than for several vear? h?rn?- .u?i ?
aoneciiou occurred, there is still a great
deficiency of laborers in every field of
industry and especially in agriculture and
in our mines, as w.ell of iron aad oo'al as of
preoious metals, while demand for labor is
thus increased here.
Tens of thousands of persons destitute
ot remunerative occupation are thronging
our foreign consulates and offering to em
igrate to the D. S. if essentially aided, but
only cheap assistance cau be afforded them.
It is easy to see that undgr the sharp dis
cipline of civil war, the nation is beginning
a new life. This ooble effort demands tho
aid, and ought to receive the attention and
support of tbe government.
Injuries unforeseen by ibe Government,
and unintended, may iu some oases bave
been inflicted upon the subjects or citizens
of foreign countries, botji at sea and op
land, by persons in the service of tbe Unit
ed States. As this Government expecte
redress from other.{lowers, when similar
injuries are inflicted by persons in tbeir
service, upon artisans of the United States,
we must be prepared to do justice to for
eigners. If the existing judieial tribunals
are inadequate - to ibis purpose, a Special
court may be authorized with power to
bear and decide such olaims, of tbe char
acter referred to, as may baveprlsen under
treaties and publio law.
Conventions for adjusting claims by.your
commission bave been proposed to some
governments, but no definitive, answer to
tbe proposition has yet been received from
any. In tbe course of tbe session I shall
probably have occasion to request you to
provide indemnification to claimants. Tbe
decrees of restitution have been rendered
uid . damages .awarded by tbe admiralty
sourt, and in other cases where this gov
irnment may be acknowledged to be lia
ble in principle, and where tbe amount of
:bat liability - has been ascertained by an
informal arbitration.
The proper offioers of tbe Treasury bave
ieemed themselves required by the law of
the United States upon the subjeot, to de
mand a tax upon tbe iqcomes of foreign
Bonsuls In tttis country ; while such a de
mand may not be in accordance to instruc
tions, nor yet be an indioatioir' df publio
law or perhaps of any existing treaty be
tween tbe United States and. a foreign
country, tbe expediency of so far modify
ing the act as to exempt from tax tbe in
come of such consuls as are not citizens of
the United States, derived from the emol
uments of their office or from property not
sitnatedio ibe United States, is submitted
to your serious consideration.
I ntake this suggestion upon the ground
that a comity, which ought to be recipro
cated, exempts our consuls in all other
countries from taxation. To the extent
thus indicated the United States, I think,
ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to
international trade and commerce.
Tbe operations of the Treasury duriog
tbe last year have been successfully con
ducted. . The enactment by, Congress of a
national banking law has proved a valua
ble support of the publio credit, and the
general legislation in relation to loans has
fully answered the expectations or its
favorers. Some amendments may be re.
quired to perfect existing laws, but no
change'iu tbeir principles or general scope
is believed to :be needed.
8ince these measures have been in oper
ation,- all demands oh the Treasury, ioclnd
ing pay of thesrmy.and navy, have been
promptly mef and fully satisfied. No con
siderable body of. troops, it is believed,
were.ever more amply provided, more lib
erally aod punctually paid. And it may
ba added thaw by no people were the bur
dens inoident to a great war more cheer
fully borne.
The receipts during the year from all
sources, including loans, and the balance
ia the Treasury at its commencement, were
$901,125,674.86; tbe aggregatedisburse
ments, $805,796,680.65, leaving a balance
on tbe Tth of July, 1H8, of <$6,329,044.21.
Of the receipts, tbesa" were derived, froip
Customs, $69,059*,e'<i'40; from Internal
Revenue, $87,640, 767,95; from Direct
046,616.35 and from Joans, i $776,682,
361.87, making-tbe aggregatoor $901,126,.
664.86. Of the disbursements there were
.$599,298^600.83 for the Navy Department;
$6,324,106 27 for the payment of funded
ana temporary debt i making an aggregate
of .$895,766,630.56,.and. leaving a balance
of $6,829,044 21.
But the payment of the funded and temr
porary debt having been made from monies
borrowed daring; the year, must be regard:
ed as merely nominal payments, and the
monies borrowed to make tbem, as merely
nominal reoeipts, and tbeir anionnt, $181,
086,636,07, should therefore be deducted
both from the receipts and disbursements.

Tne extensive blockade has been con
stantly increasing In efficiency ai the nary
has expanded, yet on so long a line It bat
so far been Impossible to suppress lUtoR
trade. Prom the returns received at the
Navy Department, it appears that more
than one tboosand vessels have been-oap
tured since tbe blookade was instituted,
and that the value of the prixee already
sent In for adjudication, amount
$13,000,000. The naval forctof the united
States consists at this time of 588 vessels
completed and In tbe course of completion,
and of these 16 are iron claa armed Bteam
|l fiTB. :
The events of the war give an Increased
interest and Importance to the navy, which
will probably extend beyond the war It
self." The armored vW."> , ?"l' ,nay
completed aqU fn service, or which are un
der contract.and approaching completiqn,
are believed to exceed.la. numbers those oI
any other power- But, while these may b?
' relied upon foe - bnrbor defeucc and sea*
coast survey, Others if greater'strength
at.d capacity will beneetssary for oruisfufl
purposes and to maintain our rightful po
aition on the ocean.
Satisfactory and important as has been
the performances of the heroic men of tbe
navy at this period, tbey are scarcely more
wonderful than the services of our mechan
ics and artisans In tbe production of wai
vessels, which has created a new form ol
naval power. Onrcouutry has advantage!
1 superior to any other nation, tri our re
sources of iron and lumber, with inexhaust
ible quantities of fuel in the immediate
vicinity of both, and ail accessible and in
close proximity to navigable waters, with"
out the disadvantage of public risks.
The change that has taken place in naval
vessels and naval, warfare slnoe tbe intro
duction of steam as a motive power foi
ships of war; demands either a correspond
ing chauge in* some of our existing navy
yards, or the establishment ol. new ones
for the coustruotion and necessary repalt
of modern war vessels. No iooonsidemble
embarrassment,' delay, and public injury
have been experienced from the want o!
such government establishment*; l. -,
The necessity of such a navy yard to
furnished at some suitable place Upon the
Atlantic seabord, hits ou repeated occasions
been brought to the: attention of OoDgress
by the Navy Department, and is again pre
sented in the report of the SocreWry, which
accompaniea'tbil communication. I think
it my doty tos-jnvite. your special attention
to this sutijeel, aud also to that of estab
lishiog a yard and depot for oaval purpo
see upon one of the Western rivers. A naval
force has been ureated>ou these interior
water* and under many'disadvantages with
in little more than two years, exceeding in
oumbers~tbe whole nival force of the coun
try at the commencement of the present
administration. \ . ,

developed and its power displayed in tbe
construction of a navy of suoh magnitude,
which has at the very, period of Ita creation
rendered signal service to the Dnion. Thi
increase of the number of seajnen in th<
pubiio service from 7000 mpn in tbe spring
of 1861 to about 24,000, at tbe preseni
time, has been aooomplisbed without espe
cial legislation or extraordinary bountiei
to promote that exercise.
It baa been found, however, that tbe op
erations of the draft, with high bountiei
paid for army rtorultt, It beginning to ef;
loot injuriously the naval tervlce, and
will, If not corrected, be likely to Impall
ita efficiency by attracting seamen fron
their proper vocation aud inducing them
to enter the army. X therefore respectful
ly suggest that Congress might aid botl
the army and naval servloe by an adequate
provision ou this subject, which would
the same time be equitable to the commu
nities more especially intended.
I commend to your consideration tbe
suggestions of the Secretary of theNavyic
regard to the polioy of fostering and train
ing seamen for naval service. The Naval
Academy is rendering signal service in
preparing midshipmen for highly respon
sible duties, which, in afterlife, they will
be required to perform In order that thi
country should not be deprived of tb?
proper quota of eduoated officers, foi
which legal provision has been made at
tbe Naval School. Tbe vacancies caused
by tbe neglect or omission to make nomi

attempt to retract or modify the emancipa

slavery any peraon who la made free b
the terms of tbe proclamation or by an
act of Congress. For tbeee and othi

and reatoration of projected rights, wfclo

which be eball deem wlaeat for tbe pnblii

It>hould be observed alao, that tbia Dai
