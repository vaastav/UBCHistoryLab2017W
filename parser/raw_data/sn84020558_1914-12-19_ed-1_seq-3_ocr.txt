The diagram was made a part of
General Vod's last report to the
Secretary War. The subject of
the country's defenses was put be
fore Congress by President Wilson's
message Tuesday. Almost simul
taneously plans were discussed at a
meeting in New York city for the
formation of a national security

I. C G. DECISION
IV INFLUENCE
PHOENIX RATES
Five Per (Vnt 'Increase
(i ranted Eastern Roads
Shows That Railroads'
Claims Will Re (iiven
Careful Consideration
That the five per rent Increase in
freight rates granted eastern mads
indicates a disposition on the part
of the interstate commerce commis
sion to consider the claims of the
railroads more favorably, and may re
sult in an increase of rates from
Phoenix and the Southwest, is the
opinion of Corporation Commissioner
F. A. Jones.
"The decision shows the attitude of
mind of the commission,'1 said Com
missioner Jones when informed of
the increase by a Republican report
er last evening, "and indicates that
it is more disposed to Rive considera
tion to the claims of the carriers
than formerly.
"Any increase in rates on trunk
lines east of Chicago will in all prob
ability have the ultimate effect of
raising through rates from Phoenix
and Los Angeles to points in the ter
ritory affected. The through rate is
based on the rate from western
points to Chicago and the rate be
tween Chicago and New York, so
that raising the rate between the lat
ter cities will doubtless have its ef
fect on transcontinental tariffs, un
less the commission orders otherwise.
I do 'not know whether the commis
sion's action will have any effect on
the decision in the intermountaln rate
'ase."
For Minimum Charge
The Pacific Cias and Electric, com
pany yesterday filed application with
the corporation commission for ap
proval of (i minimum charge of $1.00
per kilowatt of connected load per
month to all lighting consumers
whose connected load is In cxeeess of
five kilowatts. The company's appli
cation will be heard at 10 a, m. on
January 12.
Lighting consumers affected by the
new rate include air big consumers.
Among the lighting consumers af
fected by the new rate are big hotels,
office buildings, photographers and
users of X-ray apparatus, who either
have lighting plants of their own or
who use but very little current in
proportion to the investment requir
ed. The company holds that a mini
mum charge in proportion to the fixed
charges should be in effect in Justice
to thcother consumers.
The commission desires consumers
who would .be affected by the new
charge to attend the hearing and of
fer suggestions as to the proposed
minimum rate.

GAHTATA IS
BIG SUCCESS
"Queen Esther" Presented
by First M. E. Church
Proves Splendid Produc
tion and Will Be Repeat
ed at an Earlv Date
A splendid production in every fea
ture was the cantata "Queen Esther,;'
presented at the high school audi
torium last evening under the aus
pices of the First M. E. church, and
one deserving fur better support
than it received. Although the ad
vance sale of tickets was exception-,
ally good, the inclement weather
served to keep many at home, and
the attendance was small, especially
so in view of the excellence of the
performance.
The elaborate production was car
ried out in a way that reflected cre
dit on all who had a part in its
preparation, and showed a high or
der of merit throughout. The work
of the principals in the cast was uni
formly of the best, the various num-
hers being given in a most pleasing
; manner. The members of the large
chorus of seventy-five were all in
attendance, and won high commenda
tion for the splendid showing made.
Too much credit cannot be given
Mrs. It. 11. Tafel, under whose direc
tion the cantata was staged and the
performers drilled, for the success of
the prodia tion. Arrangements have
been made to repeat the perform
ance during Christmas week, or soon
thereafter. Tuesday, December 2:1, be
ing mentioned as a probable date. .

If the sun shines, drag the baseball

For on Christmas Day, there will be
one baseball game a contest between
the Phoenix Outlaws and the Columbia
theater slurs. It was the astronomical
aggregation that started this thing.
Some of them offered to bet the price
of a good substantial turkey dinner
that they could liek any nine-man or
nine-boy outtit in Phoenix. The talk
was carried to the Outlaws, who have
been operating under difficulties and
lowering skies for the nonce, and the
result was an accepted challenge.
.Manager llenenato of the Outlaws
will call upon the theatrical team to
day and elicit some real information.
In the conference, it will be decided
whether or not the Badmen are
a-searcd of the possible leaguers in the
Columbia layout, or if the dramatic
athletes are in fear of the young Phoe
nicians. You know that occasionally a
real ball player goes on the stage, so
the advice is handed out free gratis for
nothing: Look a litle out, for there may

Com HARLAN AND
CLEMENTS DISSENT
Chairman Says the Needed
Income Could Have Been
More Easily Obtained by
Roads by More Scientific
and Reasonable Method
f ASSOCIATED PRESS D'SPATCHl
WASHINGTON. Dec. 18. A further
increase in freight rates was granted the
eastern railroads by the interstate com
merce commission, in a decision from
which Chairman Harlan anil Commis.
sionerd Clements dissented vigorously.
With the exception of lake and rail
traffic, coal, coke and iron ore and cer
tain other traffic, on which the com
mission heretofore fixed rates, adjudi
cated as "reasonable", all railroad sys
tems operating between the Atlantic
seaboard and the Mississippi, north of
the Potomac and Ohio rivers, are al
lowed a flat five per cent increase lor
which they have been asking the last
lour years. The roads hoped to get an
increase which would add to the an
nual revenue some $r,ii,(j(Mi,iH.ia. The"
commission's decision is expected to
give them an addition of approximate
ly $:i,o0(i,ooo.
The roads east of the north and south
line drawn through Buffalo, Pittsburg
and Charleston, V. Va.. won by the de
cision increases other than on the traf
lic excepted, which was denied them in
the commission's decision last August.
The roads west of this line, which got
partial advances in the August decision
received further advances, so that now
all the roads in what is described as
"official classification territory" will
enjoy uniform advances in both clars
and commodity rates.
In the decision a majority of Commis
sion held that the roads had estab
lished in the latest hearings a greater
need of additional net income than ever
before. This was due, in part, to the
exigencies which arose out of the war
in F.nrope and in part to already ex
isting necessity, in the judgment of the
commission, for additional revenues to
maintain their railroad properties.
Chairman Harlan, in his dissenting
opinion held that sufficient aid had
been given to the roads by the decision
of August I lasl, ami that the findings
of the majority are "morally wrong."
Commissioner Clements based his dis
sent on what he regarded as the ina
bility, in law of the commission to take
cognizance of anything in making rates
or their justice and reasonableness.
In administration circles, the outcome
of the case is welcomed as a develop
ment of vast importance which would
hasten, to support the expected general
business revival. President Wilson is
sues no formal statement, but the
White "House officials say he is greatly
pleased over the decision and expects
it to have an immediate effect on the
country's economic situation. The pres
ident had made- no secret of his belief
in the improvement of conditions gen
erallv and that it was dependent to
some extent at least, to additional rev
enue being provided in some way for
the railroads.
The traffic on which no increase is
allowed by the commission, represents
about fifty-five per cent of the entire
volume of freight handled by the roads.
Coal, coke, iron ore, however, are bulky
commodities, taking low rates and con-
semicntlv the amount of revenue de
rived from them is relatively small,
In the eastern district ten per cent
of the entire volume of freight is an
thracite; thirty-one per cent is bitum
inous coal; five per cent coke; and fife
per cent ores.
The coal roads, in the opinion of the
commission are already profitable.
Chairman Harlan, while agreeing,
that the roads established their need
of additional net "revenue, in even a
greater amount than that of fifty mil
lions which it carries, as indicated
would be the result of the five per cent
increase declares his entire "dissent
from the course now approved by the
commission of permitting carriers to
augment their revenues."
"The original record contained no
evidence tending to prove any of the
proposed increased rates as affecting
trunk lines or New England territories
as just, and reasonable." He said, "this
deficiency in the proof was not sup
plied on the further hearing. The rec
ord showed the financial condition of
the trunk line carriers generally to be
much more favorable.
"We pointed out, however, in our
original report the sources from which
the needed additional net income could
and should be obtained, namely by a
revision of the rates and the abandon
ment of the practices found to be un
remunerative or wasteful. The benefi
cient effect of intelligent revision of
rates is shown by the results obtained
in New Kngland while this proceed
ing was pending.
"The New England carriers sought
approval in this case to increase only
in rates the traffic moving between
that territory and other parts of the
official classification territory; hey did;
not propose a general five per cent in
crease in freight rates. In other words,
the New England lines voluntarily pur
sued the only rational and reasonable
course to augment their revenue, this
being the course urged upon the Cen
tra Freight association lines in our
original report.
'Ty following the suggestions made
in the original report the carriers could
undoubtedly secure a more additional

ern railroads, the stock: marKet was
dropping at a pace which strongly sng-

the publication of r summary of the

and were from 4 to 6 points under the
high level reached on Tuesday, when
open trading in the entire list was es

of minimum prices, seasoned issues de
