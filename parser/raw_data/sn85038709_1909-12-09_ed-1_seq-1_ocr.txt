A DEFICIT OF $73,075,600
Legislation Urged Against Injunctions Without
Notice.
Washington, Dec. 7. In his annu.il
message, read to congress, President
Taft said:
To the Senate and the House of Rep
resentatives: The relations of the United States
with all foreign governments have con
tinued upon the normal basis of amity
and good understanding and are very
generally satisfactory.
The American rights In the fisheries
on the north Atlantic coast under the
fisheries article of the treaty of ISIS
have been a cause of difference be
tween the United States and Great
Britain for nearly seventy years. The
interests Involved are of great Impor
tance to the American fishing Industry,
and the final settlement of the contro
versy I by the permanent court of ar
bitration at The HagueJ will remove
a source of constant irritation and com
plaint. This is the first case Involving
such great International questions
which has been submitted to the per
manent court of arbitration at The
Hague.
Negotiations for an international
conference to consider and reach an
arrangement providing for the preser
vation and protection of the fur seals
in the north Pacific are in progress
with the governments of Great Britain,
Japan and Russia. The attitude of
the governments interested leads me
to hope for a satisfactory settlement of
this question as the ultimate outcome
of the negotiations.
The Near East.
The quick transition of the govern
ment of the Ottoman empire from one
of retrograde tendencies to a consti
tutional government with a parlia
ment and with progressive modern y
policies of reform and public improve
ment Is one of the important phenome
na of our times. Constitutional gov
ernment seems also to have made
further advance in Persia. These
events have turned the eyes of the
world upon the near east. In that
quarter the prestige of the United
Btates has spread widely through the
peaceful Influence of American schools,
universities and missionaries. There
is every reason why we should obtain
a greater share of the commerce of the
near east since the conditions are
more favorable now than ever before.
Latin America.
One of the happiest events in recent
pan-American diplomacy was the pa
cific, independent settlement by the
governments of Bolivia and Peru of a
boundary difference between them,
which for some weeks threatened to
cause war and even to entrain im
bitterments affecting other republics
less directly concerned.
Our Citizens Abroad.
This administration, through the de
partment of state and the foreign serv
ice, is lending all proper support to
legitimate and beneficial American en
terprises in foreign countries, the de
gree of such support being measured
by the national advantages to be ex
pected. A citizen himself cannot by
contract or otherwise divest himself
of the right, nor can this government
escape the obligation, of his protec
tion in his personal and property
rights when these are unjustly in
fringed in a foreign country. To avoid
ceaseless vexations it is proper that in
considering whether American enter
prise should be encouraged or support
ed in a particular country the govern
ment should give full weight not only
to the national as opposed to the indi
vidual benefits to accrue, but also to
the fact whether or not the govern
ment of the country In question is in
Its administration and in its diplomacy
faithful to the principles of modera
tion, equity and Justice upon which
alone depends international credit in
diplomacy as well as in finance.
The Monroe Doctrine.
The pan-American policy of this
government has long been fixed In its
principles and remains unchanged.
With tho changed circumstances of the
United States and of the republics to
the south of us, most of which have
preat natural resources, stable govern.
and progressive Ideals. tft ap
prehension which gave rise to the
Monroe doctriue may be said to have
nearly disappeared, and neither the
doctrine as it exists nor any other doc
trine of .American .policy, should e
permuted to opera" Te for flke 'peTpelua
tion of irresponsible government, the
escape of just obligations or the insidi
ous allegation of dominating ambitions
on tho part of the United States.
My meeting with President Diaz and
the greeting exchanged on both Amer
ican and Mexican soil served, 1 hope,
to signalize the close and cordial rela
tions which so well bind together this
republic and the great republic imme
diately to the south, between which
there is so vast a network of material
interests.
I am happy to say that all but one
of the cases which for so long vexed
our relations with Venezuela have
been settled within the past few
months and that, under the enlight
ened regime now directing the govern
ment of Venezuela, provision has been
made for arbitration of the remaining
case before The Hague tribunal.
On July 30, 1909, the government of
Panama agreed, after considerable ne
gotiation, to Indemnify the rehuives of
the American officers and sailors who
were brutally treated, one of them
having. Indeed, been killed by the
Panaman police this year.
This government was obliged to In
tervene diplomatically to bring about
arbitration or settlement of the claim
of the Emery company against Nica
ragua, which It had long before been
agreed should be arbitrated. A settle
ment of this troublesome case was
reached by the signature of a protocol
on Sept. 18, 1909.
Many years ago diplomatic interven
tion became necessary to the protec
tion of the interests in tho American
claim of Alsop & Co. against the
government of Chile. The govern
ment of Chile had frequently admitted
obligation in the case and had prom
ised this government to settle it. There
had been two abortive attempts to do
so through arbitral commissions, which
failed through lack of Jurisdiction.
Now, happily, as the result of the re
cent diplomatic negotiations, the gov
ernments of the United States and of
Chile, actuated by the sincere desire
to free from any strain those cordial
and friendly relations upon which both
set such store, have agreed by a proto
col to submit the controversy to defin
itive settlement by his Britannic majes
ty Edward VII.
The Nicaraguan Trouble.
Since the Washington conventions of
1907 were communicated to the gov
ernment of the United States as a con
sulting and advising party this gov
ernment has been almost continuously
called upon by one or another and in
turn by all. of the five Central Amer
ican republics to exert Itself for the
maintenance of the conventions. Near
ly every complaint has been against
the Zelaya government of Nicaragua,
which has kept Central America in
constant tension or turmoil. The re
sponses made to the representations of
Central American republics as due
from the United States on account of
its relation to the Washington conven
tions have been at all times conserva
tive and have avoided, so far as possi
ble, any semblance of interference, al
though it is very apparent that the
considerations of geographic proximity
to the canal zone and of the very sub
stantial American interests in Central
America give to the United States a
special position in the zone of these
republics and the Caribbean sea.
I need not rehearse here the patient
efforts of this government to promote
peace and welfare among these re
publics, efforts which are fully appre
ciated by the majority of them who
are loyal to their true interests. It
would be no less unnecessary to re
hearse here the sad tale of unspeak
able barbarities and oppression alleged
to have been committed by the Zelaya'
government. Recently two Americans
were put to death by order of Presi
dent Zelaya himself. They were offi
cers in the organized forces of a rev
olution which had continued many
weeks aud was In control of about
half of the republic, and as such, ac
cording to tne modern enlightened
practice of civilized nations, they were
entitled to be dealt with as prisoners
of war.
At the date when this message Is
printed this government has termi
nated diplomatic relations with the
Zelaya government for reasons made

Is Intending to take such future steps
as may be found most consistent with
Its dignity, its duty to American in
terests and its moral obligations to
Central America and to civilization. It
may later bo necessary for me to bring
this subject to the attention of the
congress in a special message.
In the Far East.
In the far east this government pre
serves unchanged its policy of support
ing the principle of equality of oppor
tunity and scrupulous respect for the
Integrity of the Chinese empire, to
which policy are pledged tho interest
ed powers of botli east and west.
By the treaty of 1903 China has un
dertaken the abolition of likin with a
moderate and proportionate raising of
tho customs tariff along with currency
reform. These reforms being a mani
fest advantage to foreign commerce as
well as to the interests of China, this
government Is endeavoring to facili
tate these measures and the needful
acquiescence of the treaty powers.
When It appeared that Chinese likin
revenues were to be hypothecated to
foreign bankers In connection with a
great railway project it was obvious
that tho governments whose nationals
held this loan would have a certain
direct Interest In the question of the
carrying out by China of the reforms
in question. The administration deem
ed American participation to be of
great national interest. Happily, when
it was as a matter of broad policy ur
gent that this opportunity should not
be lost, the indispensable instrumental
ity presented itself when a group of
American bankers of International
reputation and great resources agreed
at once to share in the loan upon pre
cisely such terms as this government
should approve. The chief of those
terms wan that American railway ma
terial should be upon an exact equality
with that of the other nationals join
ing in the loan In the placing of or
ders for this whole railroad system.
After months of negotiation the equal
participation of Americans seems at
last assured.
in one of the Chinese-Japanese con
ventions of Sept. 1 of this year there
was a provision which caused consid
erable public apprehension In that
upon its face it was believed in some
quarters to seek to establish a monop
oly of mining privileges along the
South Manchurian and Antung-Muk-den
railroads and thus to exclude
Americans from a wide field of enter
prise, to take part in which they were
by treaty with China entitled.- After
a thorough examination of the conven
tions and of the several contextual
documents the secretary of state reach
ed the conclusion that no such monop
oly was Intended or accomplished.
This government made inquiry of the
imperial Chinese and Japanese gov
ernments and received from each offi
cial assurance that the provision had
no purpose Inconsistent with the poli
cy of equality of opportunity to which
tho signatories, in common with the
United States, are pledged.
Our traditional relations with the
Japanese empire continue cordial, as
usual. The arrangement of 1908 for
a co-operative control of the coming
of laborers to the United States has
proved to work satisfactorily. The
matter of a revision of the existing
treaty between the United States and
Japan which is terminable in 1912 Is
already receiving the study of both
countries.
The Department of State.
I earnestly recommend to the favor
able action of the congress the esti
mates submitted by the department of
state and most especially the legisla
tion suggested in the secretary of
state's letter of this date whereby It
will be possible to develop and make
permanent the reorganization of the
department upon modern lines in a
manner to make It a thoroughly ef
ficient instrument in the furtherance
of our foreign trade and of American
interests abroad.
Under a provision of the act of Aug.
5, 1909. I have appointed three officials
to assist the officers of the government
In collecting information necessary to
a wise administration of the tariff act
of Aug". 5. 1900. As to questions of
customs administration they are co
operating with the officials of the
trrasurv department aud as to matters
of the needs and the exigencies of our
manufacturers and exporters with the
department of commerce and labor In
its relation to the domestic aspect of
the subject of foreign commerce.
As a consequence of section 2 of tho
tariff act of Aug. 5, 1909, it becomes the
duty of the secretary of state to con
duct as diplomatic business all the
negotiations necessary to place him in
a position to advise me as to whether
or not a particular country unduly dis
criminates against the United States
In the sense of the statute referred to.
i
Government Expenditures and Rev
enuas. Perhaps the tuosj Important ques
tion presented to this administration
is that of economy in expenditures and
sufficiency of revenue;.
The report ot iht secretary shows
that the ordinary expenditures tor the
current liseal year j- ending June 3i,
1910. will exceed jhe estimated re
ceipts by 3 1.075.020; If to this deficit
are added the sum Co be disbursed for
the Panama canal, amounting to $3S,
0O(Uk0. and .Sl.000.0uu- to be paid on
tho public debt, the deficit of ordinary
receipts and expenditures will bo in
creased to a total deficit of 73.075.020.
This deficit the secretary proposes to
m.'et by the proceeds of bonds issued
to pay the eost of. constructing the
Panama canal. I itpprove this pro
posal. The Panama Canal.
Tho policy of paying for the con
struction of the Panama canal not
out of current revenue, but by bond
Issue, was adopted in the Spooner act
of 1902. and there seems to be no good
reason for departing from the princi
ple by which a part at least of the
burden of the cost of tho canal shall
fall upon our posterity, who are to
enjoy it, and there is all tho more rea
son for this view because the actual
cost to dato of the canal, which Is now
half done and which will bo completed
Jan. 1, 1915. shows that the cost of
engineering and construction will be
$297,700,000 instead of $139,705,200, as
originally estimated. In addition to
engineering and construction, the oth
er expenses, including sanitation and
government and the amount paid for
the properties, the franchise and the
privilege of building the canal, In
crease the cost by $75,133,000 to a
total of $375,201,000. The Increase In
tho cost of engineering and construc
tion is due to a substantial enlarge
ment of the plan of construction by
widening tho canal 100 feet In the Cu
lebra cut and by Increasing the di
mensions of the locks, to the under
estimate of the quantity of the work
to be done under the original plan and
to an underestimate of the cost of la
bor and materials, both of which have
greatly enhanced in price since the
original estimate was made.
Government Economy.
In order to avoid a deficit for the
ensuing fiscal year I directed the
heads of departments In the prepara
tion of their estimates to make them
as low as possible consistent with Im
perative governmental necessity. Tho
result has been, as I am advised by
the secretary of the treasury, that tho
estimates of the expenses of the gov
ernment for the fiscal year ending
June CO, Mil that is, for the next
fiscal year are less by $55,003,000
than the total of appropriations for
the current fiscal year and less by
$91,000,000 tlian the estimates for that
year. So far as the secretary of the
treasury Is able to form a judgment as
to future income, there will be no
deficit in the year ending June 30, 1911,
but a small surplus of $712,000.
In tho present estimates the needs
of the departments and of the gov
ernment have been cut to the quick.
For the purpose of securing informa
tion which may enable the executive
aud the legislative branches to unite
In a plan for the permanent reduction
ot the cost of governmental adminis
tration the treasury department has
instituted an Investigation by one of
the most skilled expert accountants in
the United States. The object of the
Investigation is to devise means to in
crease the average efficiency of each
employee. There is great room for im
provement toward this end, not only
by the reorganization of bureaus and
departments and In the avoidance of
duplication, but also in the treatment
of the individual employee.
Under the present system It constant
ly happens that two employees receive
the same salary when the work of one
is far more difficult and important and
exacting than that of the other. Su
perior ability is not rewarded or en
couraged. Civil Pensions.
As tho degree of efficiency in all the
departments Is much lessened by the re
tention of old employees who have out
lived their energy and usefulness it
Is indispensable to any proper system
of economy that provision be made so
that thelf separation from the service
shall be easy and inevitable. It is im
possible to make such provision unless
there is adopted a plan of civil pen
sions. We cannot. In view of the ad
vancing prices of living, hope to save
money by a reduction In the standard
of salaries paid. Indeed, if any change
is made in that regard an increase
rather than n decrease wjll be...neces.
sary, and Ihe only means '5V economy
will be in reducing the number of
employees and In obtaining a greater
average of efficiency from those re
tained lo the service.
Frauds In the Collection of Customs.
I regret to refer to the fact of the
discovery of extensive frauds In tho
collection of the customs revenue at
New York city, In which a number of
the subordinate employees in the
weighing and other departments were
directly concerned and In which the
beneficiaries were the American Sugar
Refining company and others. The
frauds consisted in the payment of du
ty on underweights of sugar. Tho gov
ernment has recovered from tho Amer
ican Sugar Refining company all that
It is shown to have been defrauded of.
The sum was received In full of the
amount due which might have been
recovered by civil action against the
beneficiary of tho fraud, but there was
an excess reservation in tho contract
of settlement by which the settlement
should not interfere with or prevent
tho criminal prosecution of every one
who was found to be subject to the
same.
Criminal prosecutions are now pro
ceeding against a number of the gov
ernment officers. The treasury de
partment and the department of jus
tice are exerting every effort to dis
cover all the wrongdoers. Including tho
officers and employees of the compa
nies who may have been privy to the
fraud. It would seem to me that an
Investigation of the frauds by con
gress at present, pending the probing
by the treasury department and tho
department of Justice, as proposed,
might by giving Immunity and other
wise prove an embarrassment in se
curing conviction of the guiity parties.
Maximum and Minimum Clause In
t Tariff Act.
Two features of the new tariff act
call for special reference. In order
that'the maximum duty shall be charg
ed against the Imports from a country
It is necessary that tho executive shall
find on the part of that country not
only discriminations In Its laws or the
practice' under them against the trade
of the United States, but that the dis
criminations found shall be undue
that is, without good and fair reason.
No one is seeking a tariff war or a con
dition in which the spirit of retaliation
shall be aroused.
Tariff Readjustment.
The new tariff law enables me to ap
polut a tariff board to assist me in con
nectlon with the department of state In
the administration of the minimum and
maximum clause of the act aud also to
assist officers of the government lu the
administration of the entire law. I be
lieve that the work of this board will
be of prime utility and Importance
whenever congress shall deem It wise
again to readjust tho customs duties.
If the facts secured by the tariff board
are of such a character as to show gen
erally that the rates of duties imposed
by the present tariff law are excessive
under the principles of protection as
described in the platform of the suc
cessful party at the late election I
shall not hesitate to Invite the atten
tion of congress to this fact and to the
necessity for action predicated there
on. Nothing, however, halts business
and Interferes with the course of pros
perity so much as the threatened revi
sion of the tariff, and until the facts
are nt hand, after careful and deliber
ate Investigation, upon which such re
vision can properly be undertaken, it
seems to me unwise to attempt it.
War Department.
In tho interest of Immediate econ
omy I have required a reduction in
the estimates of the war department
for the coming fiscal year which
brings the total estimates down to an
amount forty-five millions lex than
the corresponding estimates for last
year. This could be accomplished only
by cutting off new projects and sus
pending for the period of one year all
progress In military matters. For the
same reason I have directed that the
army shall not bo recruited up to Its
present authorized strength. These
measures can hardly be more than
temporary, for I am sure that the In
terests of the military establishment
are seriously in need of careful con
sideration by congress.
The secretary of war calls attention
to a number of needed changes in the
array, in all of whic h I concur, but the
point upon which 1 place most em
phasis is the need for an elimination
bill providing a method by which the
merits of officers shall have some ef
fect upon their advancement and by
which the advancement of all may be
accelerated by the effective elimination
of a definite proportion of the least
efficient.
The military and naval Joint board
have unanimously agreed that It would
le unwise to make the large expendi
tures which at one time were contem
plated In the establishment of a naval
base and station in the Philippine Is
lands and have expressed their Judg
ment. In which I. fully concur. In fa
vor of making an extensive naval base
at Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and
not In the Philippines.
The Navy.
The return of the .battleshirL,.fiet
from Its voyage around 'flfo" world Tn
more efficient condition than when it
i started was a noteworthy event of in
terest alike to our citizens and the
naval authorities of the world. Tho
marked success of the ships in steam
ing around the world in all weathers
on schedule time has increased respect
for our navy and has added to our na
tional prestige.
It Is a regrettable fact that the
higher officers are old for the respon
sibilities of the modern navy, and the
admirals do not arrive at flag rank
young enough to obtain adequate traiu-
ing in their duties as fiag officers.
I Owing to tho necessity for economy
! In expenditures, I have directed tho
curtailment of recommendations for
i naval appropriations so that they aro
I thirty-eight millions less than tho cor
' responding estimates of last year, and
the request for new naval construction
Is limited to two first class battleships
; and one repair vessel,
i The secretary of the navy has inau
' gurated a tentative plan involving ccr-
tain changes in the organization of tho
navy depart nieut. including the navy
yards, all of which have been found
hy the attorney general to be In ac
cordance with law. I have approved
tho execution of the plan proposed be
cause of tho greater efiicleney and
: economy It promises.
Department of Justice Expedition In
j Legal Procedure.
The deplorable delays in the admin
' istration of civil and criminal law have
received the attention of committees of
the American Bar association and of
many state bar associations as well as
, tho considered thought of judges and
jurists. In my judgment, a change in
public procedure, with a view to re
' ducing its expense to private litigants
i In civil cases and facilitating the dis
j patch of business and final decision In
both civil and criminal cases, consti
i tutes the greatest need in our Ameri
; can institutions. I do uot doubt for
; one moment that much of the lawless
i violence aud cruelty exhibited In lynch-
Ings are directly due to the uncertain
ties and Injustice growing out of the
delays in trials, Judgments and the exe
cutions thereof by our courts.
I therefore recommend legislation
providing for the appointment by the
president of a commission with author
ity to examine the law and equity
procedure of the federal courts of first
instance, the law of appeals from
those courts to the courts of appeals
and to tho supreme court and the costs'
Imposed In such procedure upon the
private litigants and upon the public
treasury and make recommendation
with a view to simplifying and ex
pediting the procedure as far as pos
sible and making it as inexpensive as
may be to the litigant of little means.
The platform of the successful party
in tho last election contained the fol
lowing: Injunctions Without Notice.
"We believe that the rules of proce
dure In tho federal courts with respect
to the Issuance of the writ of injunc
tion should .be more accurately defined
by statute aud that no Injunction or
temporary restraining order should be
Issued without notice, except where
Irreparable Injury would result from
delay. In which case a speedy hearing
j thereafter should be granted."
I recommend that In compliance with
the promise thus made appropriate leg
islation be adopted. Moreover, every
such Injunction or restraining order
Issued without previous notice and op
portunity by the defendant to be beard
should by force of the statute expire
and be of no effect after seven days
from the Issuance thereof or within
any time less than that period which
the court may fix unless within such
seven days or such less period the In
junction or order Is extended or re
newed after previous notice and op
portunity to be heard.
Anti-trust and Interstate Commerce
Laws.
Thf Jurisdiction of the general gov
ernment over Interstate commerce has
led to the passage of the so called
"Sherman anti-trust law" and the "in
terstate commerce law" and its
I amendments. The developments in tho
i operation of those laws call for a dis
cussion and some suggestions as to
amendments. These I prefer to em
body in a special message.
Postoffice Department - Second Class
Mail Matter.
The deficit every year in the post
office department Is largely caused by
the low rate of postage of 1 cent a
pound charged on second class mall
matter, which Includes not only news
papers, but magazines and miscella
neous periodicals. The actual loss grow
ing out of the transmission of this
second class mall matter at 1 cent a
pound amounts to about $03,000,000 a
year. The average cost of the trans
portation of this matter is more than
V cents a pound. The statistics of 1907
show that second class mall matter
constituted CJ.91 per cent of the
weight of all the mall and yielded '
only 5.19 per cent of the revenue.
The figures given are startling and
show the payment by the government
of an enormous subsidy to the news
papers, magazines and periodicals. A
J great saving 'might be made. amount
j ing to much more than half of the loss,
i by Imposing upon magazines and peri
j odlcals a higher rate of postage.
Postal Savings Banks.
I believe postal savings banks to be
necessary In order to offer a proper
Inducement to thrift and saving to a
great many people of small means who
do not now have banking facilities and
to whom such a system would offer an
opportunity for the accumulation of
capital. They will furnish it satisfactory
substitute, based on sound principle
and actual successful .trial In nearly
all the countries of tho world, for the
system of government guaranty of
deposits now being adopted In several
i western states which, with deference
to those who advocate it. seems to me
to have In It the seeds of demoraliza
tion to conservative banking and cer
tain financial disaster.
Ship Subsidy.
Following the course of my distin
guished predecessor, I earnestly rec
ommend to congress the consideration
ami passage of a ship subsidy bill.
Interior Department New Mexico and
Arizona.
The successful party in the last elec
tion in its national platform declared
in favor of the admisiun as separate
states of New Mexico and Arizona,
at:d I recommend that legislation ap
j propriate to this end be adopted.
j Alaska,
i With respect to the territory of Alas
ka, I recommend legislation which
: shall provide for the appointment by
! tho president of a governor and also
' of an executive council, the members
j of which shall during their term of
office reside in the territory and which
J shall have legislative powers sufficient
J to enable It to give to the territory lo
cal laws adapted to Its present growth.
I strongly deprecate legislation looking
to the election of a territorial legisla
ture in that vast district.
Conservation of Natural Resources.
In several departments there is pre
sented the necessity for legislation
looking to the further conservation of
our uational resources, and the sub
ject Is one of such importance as to
require a more detailed and extended
discussion than can be entered upon
in this communication. For that rea
son I shall take an early opportunity
to send a special message to congress.
The White Slave Trade.
There Is 'urgent necessity for addi
tional legislation and greater executive
activity to suppress the recruiting of
the ranks of prostitutes from the
streams of immigration into this coun
try an evil which, for want of a bet
ter name, has been called "the white
slave trade."
Bureau of Health.
There seems to be no reason why all
the bureaus and offices In the general
government which have to do with
the public health or subjects akin
thereto should not be united in a bu
reau to be called the "bureau of pub
lic health." ... . ..
Political Contributions. ,
I urgently recommend to congress
that a law be passed requiring that
candidates In elections of members of
the house of representatives and com
mittees In charge of their candidacy
and campaign file in a proper office of
the United States government a state
ment of the contributions received and
of the expenditures incurred in the
campaign for such elections and that
similar legislation be enacted in re
spect to all other elections which are
constitutionally within the control of
congress.
Conclusion. ,
Speaking generally, the country is
in a high state of prosperity. There is
every reason to believe that we are on
the eve of a substantial business ex
pansion, and we have Just garnered a
harvest unexampled in the market vab
ue of our agricultural products. The
high prices which such products bring
mean great prosperity for the farming
community; but. on the other hand,
they mean a very considerably Increas
ed burden upon those classes in the
community whose yearly compensation
docs not expand with the improvement
in business and the general prosperity.
Various reasons are given for the high
prices. The proportionate Increase in
the output of gold, which today is the
chief medium of exchange and Is in
some respects a measure of value, fur
nisles a substantial explanation of at
least part of the increase in prices.
The increase In population and the
more expensive mode of living of the
people, which have not been accom
panied by a proportionate Increase in
