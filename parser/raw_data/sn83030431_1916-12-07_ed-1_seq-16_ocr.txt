Mr. Astjulth.
Among the eminent British Premier
nnil lending statesmen of our time
must be Included Hebbxbt IL Ab
QtiTii, who relinquished his commis
sion on Tuesday from patriotic mo
tives. As on mora than one occasion
In the past when there were differ
ence. In Government councils and a
crisis nrose, be could have remained
In office by proposing a compromise, ho
great Is bis personal Influence among
bis colleagues, so strong la the.fnltn
of the country In bis ability, honesty
of punosc und self-control.
It bus been welt said of Mr. As
uitA that bo Is "a man whom tbo
emergency bus alwrrys found greater
than tbo occnslou." It was so In (be
Ulster crisis when be saved the Gov
ernment by nssiimlng the duties of
Secretary of State for War and steady
ing the House of Commons by proving
himself Its Intellectual master. It
was so 'when be formed tbo coalition
Cabinet to carry ou tbo war. Prob
olily no other man in England couKt
have brought together so many nsplr
I lie lKjlltlcliin and harmonized tlwlr
differences. The new Cabinet contained
explosive material and n brief life
was predicted for It. Yet Mr. As
qui th's exsmplo was so Inspiring and
his Influence so potent that be held
.his remarkable Cabinet together al
most to the end of the most tragic
year of England's existence.
Mr. A upturn wanted tbo Government
to present a front of union and
strength to the enemy to the end. ife
deprecated ll vIh! jui mid uncertainty.
Above all he regarded a general elec
tion as fraught with disaster. And
now to nvold It nnd to prove to the
world that England has not lost con
trol of her destiny be has made a
sacrifice for harmony mid unton.
In a critical hour Mr. Ahquith dis
dains to consider his personal for
tunes or to make n. test of his iwwer,
and be la npiln the statesman. Con
troversy for political advantage has.
always been alien to him. He Is es
sentially a mnii of conservative Judg
ment and dlslnlenxted putrose. The
welfare of England has always been
his sole concern. He has never culti
vated the iHilltlclan's art of popular
ity, and yet through two years of
stress nnd storm nnd upheaval his
leadership has never been seriously
challenged.
There could he no liner tribute to
the quality mt bis Intellect nnd tbo
fibre of bis character.
Mr. Asquitii tendered his resigna
tion not because his power hsd been
shaken nnd he must yield to the In
evitable, hut liecause he would not
engage In a controversy that threat
ened disaster to the. country If differ
ences were not soon composed. It Is
Inconceivable that u British Govern
ment could conduct the war without
the Judgment of Hkriiert Asquitii at
the council table, ami public opinion
will no doubt demand that ho be re
tained In the Government even If he
does not lend.
The Fall of Bucharest 'and the
Teutons In Rumania.
The Teutonic forces had pushed
their enveloping movements so far
that tho full tit the Rumanian capi
tal became Inevitable. On tho south
und west they hint their -batteries
within range of the city nnd they
victoriously advanced to cut off the
ralhTjiy connection with Bucharest on
the north. With the fall of Its cap!
till the conquest of the greater part
of the country Ik completed and the
"punishment" threatened Rumania
has been meted out.
Tho subjugation of Rumania car
ries wlili It the advantage to tho Cen
tral Towers of furnishing u wealth
of resources sorely needed In the pres
ent situation. But it brings to, them
no decislvo victory. It numbers
uinoiig their conquests another of the
smnll nations, and it places Rumania
in the list with Belgium, Serbia und
Montenegro; but It no more decides
'the war In their favor than did tho
overrunning of any one of tho other
wcid; Suites.
Tlio great gain to the Teutonic Tow
ers Is in tho resources that Rumania
will furnish. On account of tho re
ports of the destruction of their storo
by the Rumanians In their retreat it
would bo illillcult to nay how great
wll bo the ronuirnr'H share. But It
Is estimated that Rumania produces
about U.ooo.iMM tons of grain a yeur;
that her supply of nnimals for food
Is nl.oiit iUsHUMMi rattle. 0,000,000
sli'-fp mill almost L',000,000 hogs. Her
total production of petroleum Is put
lit I.StsiiNHi Ioih annually. Thin ren.
rescutu u great strengthening of the
Central Powers' ability to withstand
starvation and to tight successfully the
embargo upon supplies that the allied
nations have put upon them. But It
merely represents n strength thatwill
enable them to carry on tho war, that
will delay but not nvold the Allies'
success that now seems Inevitable.
Rumania will require n great nrmy
of occupation. Tho reasons that made
It so vulnerable to Teutonic attack,
its long stretch Vf frontier on both
the north and south, wilt make Its de
fence as difficult. Besides, Its only
sea front Is yet 0en to Russian
attack, and Bessarabia nnd southern
RuMla remain a field for the concen
tration of n great Russlnn army. For
the defence of such a front Germany
can III spare sufficient soldiers from
other fronts now hard pressed by
enemies.
This need of men must also deter
tho expeditions thnt It Is reimrted
are aimed at points on the Black Sea
and In the Balkans. With tho situa
tion In Greece cleprlng, with no longer
the fear of on aggressive enemy at
his back, General Rarbail's army is
In position to repel attacks In the Bal
kans. With this force augmented as
It will be he Is as ublo to carry the
war northward across Serbia as
Falxenhatn and Mackenskn are to
carry It south to Salonlcn. Rumania,
too, will be no longer n neutral power
bntan enemy's bulwnrk against which
the Allies can drive nnd through
which they can cross to effect the
original plan of a union with the Ital
ian forces for nn Invasion of Austrlu
from the south.
Rumania with Its demand for u
great army of occupation and with a
further extension of the wenkenlng
Teutonic line may become to the Cen
tral Powers not an asset but n seri
ous liability. ,.
Almare Sato.
To-night the Japan Society of New
York will welcome a new envoy from
the Empire not of the Rising but of
the Itlsen Sun. He stands accredited
not merely from the Foreign Oflltv In
Toklo, nor even from bis country as
swayed by party polities. Am a no
Sato is the direct persona! represen
tative of his sovereign, the Mlkadn.
His Majesty Yohiiiiiito Is tho con
stitutional ruler of over OAOOO.OOO
people. His nation Is the lender or
progress In Asia, the mother conti
nent. After' long diplomatic service. In
States as varied In form as England,
Russia, Germany, Mexico and our
own republic, Mr. Sato has by sheer
merit risen to the rank of Ambassa
dor. He holds therefore. a post as
high as the highest In the Diplomatic
Corps in Washington.
This modern Japanese gentleman Is
not a stranger to Americans and their
ways. He Is n graduate of an In
diana university. He wns In Wash
ington as Secretary of Legation In
1888 nnd sat In the treaty room at
Portsmouth In lOOTt. Born In tho
years between Commodore Tkmiy and
Townsend Harbis, his education lias
been In the world of to-day. He Ik
longs to tho newer school of .Tnptiuese
statesman. Would that Americans,
and especially our public men, knew
Japan ns thoroughly as tbo educated
men of Dal Nippon know us. Such
knowledge would Im a national asset
In the ilrst order of values. It would
be worth millions to our expanding
commerce In what are to be the rich
est markets of the world. It would
be potent In our future career, for the
tlmo Is drawing near whtn Hkwaro's
prophecy, made In the .Senate, shnll
1)0 common knowledge on the world's
housetops. The Pacific and the
Orient arc to be the chief fields of
political activity in the future, even
as the Far East has lieen for cen
turies the goal of commercial ambi
tion nnd the noblest theatre of the
nltrulstlc endeavors of Amerlcnns.
Aimaro Sato Is n man of the north.
He comes from that end of Japan's
main Island which Is nearer the olo
star than were the blrthplnces of
moat of his predecessors. In Awo
mori, bis native town, a thousand
years ago the Mikado's armies won
.their final victories over the aborigi
nal tribes. Then the culture of Kioto
replaced Ainu rudeness and the. gos
pel of Buddha softened manners and
sweetened life. Sato was a samurai.
Whatever that word connotes to the
mind of tho alien, especially iih fed
on stage spectacles, romnnees, carica
tures and car window studies of the
soul of Japan, the comprehensive as
sociation of Ideas at homo is summed
up In one word, service. "Samurai"
means servant. It tolls of n man .oukp.
crated In loyalty to Ids lord mid Em
peror. In nndern days, when feiiiliil
Ism is dead and pseiido-inlkndclsm Is
n fad sure to pass away, the nation
Is supreme, and the samurai knows
it. The old term now takes on In
crement of momilng. IWvini-v "life
grentens in these Inter years," the
ancient significance of the samurai :
intensified.
Certain It Is that a servant of
servnnts Sato has leeu, not only to
his brethren but a no to tho iillr-n
within Japan's gates. Ills adult life
began In drudgery at the Foreign
onice, followed by secretary's work
abroad; but when the Russlnn war
storm broke in 1001 lie was sum
moned home for labors much heavier
than those of legation routine. Even
to-dny a hundred thousand Russians
who wero prisoners In Japan call him
blessed. Educated In the American
way, knowing I.imoi.Vh spirit und
Grant's methods In victory, Japan set
her Hoosler son to surpass even the
American record by showing to tbo
worldjiow prisoners of war bhould be
treated.
Since nt this moment there are live
or six millions of able bodied men held
In prison camps In Europe, It may bu
well to look it llttlo at this point, ns
Illustrating the real temper amr polit
ical morality of Japan. These cap
tives In Europe are allowed nttle or
no communication with friends nt
home. Trlvato letters received this
very week from Great Britain tell of
anxious parents unable to learn any
thing concerning their sons picked up,
wounded or tnken prisoners, on bat
tle grounds nnd then Interned "some
where" xrhnps.
In Japan In 1004 an office for
speclnl correspondence during the war
with Rusjtlu wns at once established
and Mr. Sato placed at Its bead. The
Toklo Government detnlled native
Japanese priests, educated In Moscow
nn.'t tit. Petersburg, to teach Illiterate
subjects of the Czar how to write
their own language. These natlvo
Japanese administered spiritual con
solation according to the rites of tho
Greek Catholic or Russian church.
The Government kept n record of all
prlsouers, sick or well, wounded or
dead ; encouraged and nttended to nil
their corresH)iidence, whether sent or
received ; forwarded the effects of the
deceased, with full Information nnd
even1 sympathetic messages' to the
relatives, bestdes allowing their some
times too willing tieople to mitigate
the lot of the captives with petty
gifts and even luxuries. The eyes of
not a few Russian families at home
were opened In surprise when tak
ing tho missives from Japan to the
village priest to rend they saw nnd
heard written messages from their
sons or kinsmen who when they had
lft their homos were strangers to tt.e
pen. Such facts morn than anything
else 'explain why tho recent trenty
was made lielweei Russia nnd Japan.
The nevspiicrs of St. TetcrRburg de
clare that It Is easy for them to make
friends of the Japanese, twcutise they
tight and act llko gentlemen.
After his diplomatic service, since
1000, of nearly a decade In Hollnnd,
a neutral nation, Mr, Sato comes to
us familiar with all the traditions of
Internntlonnl friendship. These range
from I'ii.i.mork's initial enterprise of
1tsVt, In sending Tkrry'h peaceful ar
mada, to R(KnVKi.T's mediation ; and
from Taft'h Initiation of the prece
dent of sending n f.ecrctnry of State
to a Mikado's obsequies to President
Wilson's congratulations by win-less
to Japan's Enqieror. With faith In
the enlightened opinion nnd the real
Intent of the livst elements on both
sides of the Pacific, the task of the
new envoy from the leader of the na
tions of Asia should not be unreason
ably difllctilt.

The late Mr. Boi.dt did not Intro
duce good foods, good wines or good
service to Nc;W York, nor can It be
charged against III ni Hint he taught
a community of iienuy pinchers ex
travagance. There were admirable
restaurants In this town liefore 1803;
restaurants of character, numbers of
Them noted for specialties not now ob
tainable, with whose patrons the cost
of entertainment wns the last thing
to which thought wns glen. There
were spendthrifts when Delmonlco's
was downtown, and establishments In
which they had Iqiportunlly to In
dulge their weakness until their
purses were empty.
Perhaps Mr. Boi.iit's most Interest
ing contribution to hotel life In tills
town was the opportunity lie gave to
women to put themselves on exhibi
tion, to observe and be observed. Tre
vlous to his coming hotel corridors
wero almost exclusively patronized by
men. Women stayed In them as little
as they could. For them the apart
ment, usually nn the second floor,
known commonly as the "Ladles' Tar
lor"; dreary, dark and oppressive. Its
walls seemed to crush those con
demned to tarry within them; the
guests tnlked In whlsiers, as those
who await the opening sentences of
the burial service.
Mr. Boi.dt changed all this. Women
were extracted from the recesses of
the hotel under bis Ingenious and In
telligent auspices and put In the main
corridor. For them the bright and
glittering decorations, the expensive
rugs, the fine carpet. Who could have
dared to put an Oriental floor cover
ing In I he hotel "office", of nnother
day? Likewise, If Mr. Boi.dt did not
open the caffs to women, lie greatly
stimulated their paironngo thereof;
public drinking by women In New,
York Is a growth, desirable or unde
sirable, of the last quarter century.
Time wns when n woman ordering a
cocktail to be served In n public room
would have attracted unpleasant at
tention; she might not have been
served. To-day III hundreds of re
spectable hotels the bur Income from
respectable women Is highly Impor-.
tnnt. Tralmbly the cliiinge would havo
come regardless of .Mr. IIoi.dt'h ac
tivities; we have him to thiink, It may
be, that It came under decorous, amus
ing circumstances.
As an Innkeeper .Mr. Boi.dt bud
many Imitators; It Is not fair to say,
however, that all the capitalists and
hotel proprietors who, here and else
where, have put their money and
their efforts Into elaborate buildings
and decorations and Improved ser
vice slavishly followed him. The suc
cessful ones did not; they lind their
own ' Initiative, their own purpose,
their own conception of tho proper
sphere nnd possibilities of profit for
hotels. All of them learned from him ;
those who did things simply because
Mr, Boi.nr did them, without fully un
derstanding the Ideas that Inspired
lilm, enme to grief. The oxpeiHve
fillings, the costly furniture, the elab
orate apartments with which bis
bouse wns equipped wero not thought
lessly brought together. The details
of his hotel were carefully planned;
bo spent no money without knowing
why. Fortunes havo been lost hecauso
dull men saw that Mr. Boi.dt pros
sred among raro marbles, rich carv
Ingi, valuable works of art, and stu
pidly attributed his success to these
things. Mr. Botor's guests always
received what a' good hotel should
give Its patrons ; the trimmings never
were offered In the place of the sub
stantial things. v
Mr. Boldt opened his New York
house at the time when the tendency
of the New York public toward hotel
life was becoming n serious move
ment. The expense nnd difficulty of
housekeeping wero hnvlng their nat
ural effect. The servant problem
wns becoming more and more ncutc
for private families, large und small.
The possibilities of hotel Ufa for fami
lies were beginning to be understood.
It wns seen that It need not Imply
trnasltorlness; that It could he com
fortable nnd that Its cost could bo reg
ulated at least as easily as the cost
of keeping up a house. The Interest
ing family hotel life of New York to
day the adequate chronicler of which
has not yet arisen Is largely the
growth of comparatively few years.
Like alt worth while men, Mr. Boldt
took his calling seriously. He was In
terested not only In the Immediate
success of his own great enterprises
but In the welfare of his business
wherever an Inn wns maintained.
Lately he gave considerable thought
to tbo problems of country hotels,
which, because of the Immense motor
traffic of to-day, have assumed n new
Importance. He saw clearly what
they needed: cleanliness, good food,
good service. These were the funda
mental requirements he sought to Im
press on his colleagues who entertain
man and. Internal combustion engine
on and off Fifth nvenue.
It would be unfortunate If the Im
pression should be made that Mr.
Boldt's succeew resulted merely from
the fact that the prices el I urged in
his houses were at one time consid
ered high. It came from his knowl
edge of what people want and his
ability to supply It with u skill that
no hotel man has surpased.

Thomas Jeitkrson was a great
Democrat and he believed In demo
cratic simplicity and economy In the
matter of government, t
Yet we cannot conceive that eeu a

This does not seem vxactly the right
way to "return to that simplicity and

A business manager Is needed In the
Department of Education to save
money for the taxpayers by Introduc
ing a modern system of purchasing
supplies. At present there Is practi
cally no effort to coordinate the buy
ing activities of the various divisions
of the department, and the Board of
Estimate, after careful Inquiry, made
provision In the budget for 1017 for
this new'nnd potentially highly useful
officer.
The Aldermen have refused to In
dorse the Intelligent net of the Board
of Estimate, nnd us tho budget goes
to the Mayor for his signature the
paragraph has been stricken from It.
Fortunately, the Mayor has authority
to veto tha, changes made by the Al
dermen. Mr. Mitciim. knows as well
as, If not better than, anybody eNe
how heavy Is the drain on the public
treasury arising from unsystematic,
careless buying, and tho value of the
work the Aldermen do not want to
have done is apparent to him. He
can veto the cut made by the Al
dermen and restore the budget, In this
detail, to the form in which It left
the Board of Estlmnte, which pro
vides for u sensible and proper super
vision over the expenditures of the
Department of Education.

THE PRESIDENT AND THE
SHERMAN ACT.
Mr. George W. Perkins Sspports the I
VLaw That Tm AKaleia fthoala I
Be Clears! Away an a Bails
Gstaallsbed for Freeeosa of Trade.
Wlthoat Uarsgalatea Lleease.
To tub Editor or Tub sun sir: I
have read with deep Interest sad much
satisfaction your editorial artlAe la this
morning's Bun on President Wilson's
menage snd the Sherman act.
In his message to Congress yesterday
President Wilson spoke of ths necessity
ot building up our export trade. He
ssld there wss no time to lose I that we
should "clear swsy sll tegsl obstacles
and create aa basis of undoubted law
which will give freedom without permit
ting unregulated license."
A splendid statement: nothing could
sound better or be more directly to the
point. Uut how does this statement
square Itself with the statements made
by the President during the past year
to the effect that sit wss now welt with
business because his Administration hsd
given us the Clayton act and tho Fed
eral Trade Commission? If the Federal
Trade Commission and the Clayton act
have been cureslls, why Is the President
now saying thst ws hsve got to "clear
away all legsl obstacles"? The Presi
dent's ststemant yesterday Is a clesr
admission that ths Federal Trsde Com
mission act and the Clayton bill have
failed to "clear away all legal obstacles."
This of courss Is the exact situation.
All ths Clayton bills ethat csn be en
acted, all the Federal Trade Commis
sions that can be established, all tho
finely worded massages thst can be sd
dressed to Congress will avail us nothing
so long as the Sherman law remains on
our statute books In Ita present form
und Is used by our Government as Its
chief weapon to destroy large business
organisations It Is Impossible for us
to have large Industrial units with which
to compete for the business ot the world
so long ns the 8herman law remains on
the books In Its present form.
For years our business men have
been prosecuted under the clalln tbut
they were trying to evade It, and now
the Government Itself, through the Clay
ton bill and the Fedarnl Trade Commis
sion. Is actually trying to evade It. A
fine state ot things) We are acting ns
though the Sherman law were the
Eleventh Commandment. It Is high
time we stopped all this nonsensical pro
cedure and faced the trouble where It
really lies.
The sane thins for us to do, and do
with all posslbletderpatch. Is so to legis
late that we can hnve Federal Incorpora
tion of our large Interstate and Interna
tional Industrial units, with proper super
vlelon by the Federal Government und
with proper publicity. This should be
provided In such a way as to preserve
the economic Rood that unquestionably
exists through the employment of large
business machines, and eliminate the
evils of which the public have Justly
complained.
The Sherman law has been the politi
cian's greatest asset, the bu5lncsi man's
greatest liability, nnd the public's broken
reed. Okoroe V. Perkins.

NEW YORK'S FIGHT TO SAVE THE
PORT FROM DISUNION.
Why the Plea for Segrfgatlaa by the Ambitions but Short Sighted Cities
In New Jersey Is Not Jnstifled.
Complaint made to the Interstate Com
merce Commission by those cities on the
New Jersey side of New York harbor,
that shipments destined to or originat
ing within their territory should pay
lower rates than the rates now paid by
Orester New York, Is not In reality nn
appeal for relief from overburdening rates
snd consequent Increase In business In
ths favored territory. It has a deeper
Intent than thst.
The complaint differs frRn the usual
plea thst exorbitant rates stifle compe
tition, retard Industrial development and
deprive a community of the opportunity
of expansion and growth Its neighbors
enjoy.
The New Jersey section has grown and
expanded as Greater New York has
grown and expanded, and It has been due
both directly and Indirectly to the mar
vellous growth and expansion of Greater
New York that the complaining section
has prospered and developed. The Cham
ber of Commerce brief on behalf of
New York sets this forth clearly.
The complaint Is no more or less than
a veiled attempt lo take from Greater
Now York that which It has spent years
of painstaking efforts and millions ot
money to attain. It Is simply a care
fully laid plot to transplant what Is nor
mally Greater New York business, hank
ing, water nnd rail facilities nnd popu
lation to the northeastern shores of New
Jersey. The peculiar geographical location of
New Yorke makes It necessary for It to
have many of Its long hnut rail ends In
theso New Jersey cities Joined to" lis
rails In Greater New Yotk by car lloata
or lighters. In the ascertainment of
proper charges for the transportation of
commodities over great distances In the
Ufilted States tho zone rate system was
adopted. This In the application of the
same rate to nil territory within a certain
radius from a given centre. The com
plaining New Jersey cities are In what
Is known ns the New York sone; they
therefore pay the rates applying lo New
York. To make radical atlownncca
against this xone rate to nny particular
point in that 'zone would materially af
fect the rate structure In that sone. It
would nrfect rates of continuous sones
snd even tho rates between nil the zones
of the Fulled States.
The tendency of these allow ances ob
viously would be downward, or In other
wonls, u reduction of all tales. It would
therefore result In much financial loss
lo the curriers, who now are unable
pmpei ly to perform their function of
transporting freight and nt the same
time earn sufficient retain for the money
Invested by their owners.
The speclllc request of the New Jersey
cities Is that all freight destined to or
originating at these cities be charged
rates ns low or lower than the Greater
New York or zone rate, less the coet of
lighterage nnd other additional termi
nal costs necessary to deliver fi eight to
or carry freight from Greater New York.
In most instances these charges are
three cents n hundred pounds nnd foui
nnd one-fifth cents u hundred pounds.
An aJilltlon.il request Is that reran
slgnnient charges lo l (duced or elimi
nated ns a whole.
It has always been conceded that car
rlets hnve properly performed their orig
inal contract when they deliver the con
signment at the first point of destina
tion. Any additional service requested
by the owner of the shipment constitutes

The New Jersey cities making tliti

sou of being links In the chain between
United Stales shipping nnd reeclvlnr,
centres nnd foreign countries llirmias,
Orester NcwYork ns the point of trans,
shipment between railroads and .ur
carriers. Their rights arc those of links
and nothing more.
To disrupt this present system hi nu
allowances would be ruinous to hu.Mnri.

New York. It would so eonfune tha

to be taken lo obtain these betterment,
by Greater New York nnd Its zone a.,

continued toward disruption of do tone
freight rate structure, with Inevitable
confusion to the entire shipping mrld,
financial loss to all nnd n radical trad.
Justment of the traffic structure from
ocean to ocean and from lakes to gulf,
There U- a right way and n wron
way to eliminate any Inequities whleh
growth In traffic at great points of cor
centratlon may Involve: but the right
way Is not to magnify merely local ihf.
feienres. Wherever such dlfrrrrncf
have arisen In a large commercial com
munity they have arrested rather than
promoted n development of the whol.
The right way Is thnt which rei-ng
nlzes tha tendency of national nnd world
trade to develop under the form of great
organic units with such n division of
labor within them as will eerve on sub
rtnntlally equal terms all classes ot cur
riers and shippers In the ebb and (low of
traffic. Any attempt to dlslntcgrnte tht
meohanism of the rono functions for
the sake of local advantages must not
only defeat the purpose of correcting
minor defects but must work Incom
parably greater wrong by lowering the
efficiency of the world's foremost Instru
ment In the distribution of commodi
ties through channels of trade.
This Is not n new fight In tho history 1
commercial progress. It Is the eild cialm
of division by disintegration rather than
of growth by cooperation. The former
!s destined to fall here If ever tried,
