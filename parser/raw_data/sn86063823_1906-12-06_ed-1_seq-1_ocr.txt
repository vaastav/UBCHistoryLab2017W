Priaise President's Message.
Tokio, Japan, Dec. 6. Most of the
papers here highly eulogize Presi
dent Roosevelt's attitude towards the
Japanese, as expressed in his mes
sage. Ashi says: "By his firm atti
tude, prompted by a lofty sense of
justice, President Roosevelt has
added new lustre to his already
great fame. It is hoped that all tr-ie
Americans will unite in support of
his righteous policy."
Nochis psaises Mr. Roosevelt's at
titude as just and impartial and is
rejoiced to find it in perfect ajrd
with the views of the Japanese gov
ernment. Jiji is grateful that Roosevelt hhs
expressed exactly what the Japanese
would say.
The press is almost unanimous in
confidently predicting a satisfactory
solution of the San Francisco compli
cations. '-
' New Japanese Treaty.
i. Chicago, Dec. 6. A dispatch to
the Tribune from- Washingtonsays:
' Viscount AokL the Japanese ambas
sador, went to the White House yes
terday on invitation of the President.
They discussed the proposition to
negotiate an entirely new treaty, es
pecially recognizing the right of each
country to exclude the laborers of
the other. Such a provision as far as
the Japanese are concerned is em
braced In the present treaty, but both
' the President and the ambassador
thought it would satisfy the pride of
the Japanese if their right to treat
the - Americans as the Americans
treat them were recognized. Such a
treaty would please the people of
California and show them that the
President was prepared to go to the
extent of excluding the coolie Japa
nese if it should become necessary.
It was said yesterday that Secretary
Root, under the direction of the Pres
ident, is actually engaged in nego
tiating a new treaty ;with Japan,
which will specifically grant the
Japanese the same rights in the pub
lic schools as are granted European
aliens. The senate -would" kill such a
treaty, as the present sentiment in
dicates that not ten' per cent of the
Republicans and non-Democrats
would vote for a treaty which in any
way attempted to limit the rights of
a municipality to manage its own
school affairs. ' ,

PECOS VALLEY EXHIBIT.
Rev. A. Foltz Here From Friday Un
til Monday Showing the Won
derful Products of Roswell.
The Pecos Valley, New Mexico, ex
hibit car was side-tracked at the San
ta Fe station Friday, and Saturday
of last week proved a decided attrac
tion to many of our people. This is
the second trip of the Pecos Valley
exhibit car to St. John. The purpose
is to show the wonderful products
of that fertile valley. The car is un
der the management of Rev. A. Folta
formerly pastor of the First Baptist
Church of St. John. Much has been
said of the Pecos Valley country; but
nothing that will convey an accurate
conception of its many products
equal to the exhibit car.
The car is a bower of beauty to
those who admire the works of na
ture. The walls and ceiling were
hung with ripened grains of all kinds
Upon tables arranged on either side
were piled products of the garden
and truck farms, bushels of the
world-famed big red apples, which in
color and flavor command, the mark-
et'stop price. There were bushels of
grapes weighing from three to four
pounds. Samples of oats were shown
that yielded seventy-eight bushels to
the acre on sod land.
Five crops of alfalfa are' harvested
each year in the Pecos Valley, one
year's crop amounting to almost en
ough to pay for the land. ..
It is surely a most wonderful coun
try and the price of land is advanc
ing rapidly.
Rev. Foltz has made a great deal
of money out of Pecos Valley land
and says that land there is a "snap,"
no matter what price is asked for it.
The exhibit car is sent out under
the direction of the Commercial Club
of Roswell, Lakewood Artesia and
Hagerman.
BARGAINS
2 miles from Roswell. 20 acres

figure. Cheapest thing in Roswell vi
cinity. Good terms.

PRESBYTERIANS' NEW
PASTOR IS INSTALLED.
Before a large audience iffa.de up
of church people of all denomina
tions, Rev. Edwin Emerson Davis
was formally installed last night as
pastor of the Presbyterian church.
The service was held in the Presby
terian church. All the pastors of
Roswell , were invited to take part,
and as many of them as could possi
bly be present did so. Rev. C. E. Lu-
kens, the former pastor, presided
over the meeting.
The service was opened with a
prelude on the organ by Mrs. C. A.
Norvell, after which the congregation
sang a hymn. Then Rev. E. H. Ed
gar, of Hagerman, gave a brief ser
mon paying tribute to prayer and
its influence and appealing for its
use.
Mrs. Florence E. Kilgour "sang
"The Angels' Anthem" most beauti
fully, after which Rev. C. E. Lukens
propounded the constitutional ques
tions on the line set down by the
Presbyterian church, Rev. Mr. Davis
giving the responses. This was fol
lowed by the prayer of installation
by Rev. E. E. Mathes, of Artesia.
After an anthem by the choir, Mr.
Lukens gave the -charge to the new
pastor, telling him In minuteness of
detail the things that would be expec
ted of him and the things he should
expect to do. He defined the duties
of any pastor in this address. Rev.
Mr. Mathes gave the charge to the
people, . instructing them to aid the
new pastor in every way possible,
and especially by their contribution,
prayer and presence at church. This
was followed by a solo by L. R- Al
exander, which is declared to have
been one of the finest ever heard in
Roswell.
" Rev. H- 3P. . Vermillion, pastor of
the Baptist church, was 'the first out
side minister called upon, and he
gave a short talk showing Ms Joy at
the spirit of naton In 'all Christian
work ant showing how this spirit
has grown In the past few decades.
Rev. J. W. Smith, pastor of the
Southern M. E; church, spoke large
ly to the new pastor, telling that, a
a young man, he had many things to
learn and that he would x have to
adapt himself to the circumstances
and surroundings of a new country.
Rev. John Murray, the new pastor
of the First M. E. church, told of
once hearing Rev. Mr. Davis in New
York, and spoke in a general way
of the religious work all the minis
ters in Roswell have before them,
and bespeaking for all the greatest
of success.
All -the visiting pastors spoke in a
humorous vein part of the time, and
what they had to say was given in
evident good faith. Their remarks
served as a livening influence on
the program. After a fervent benedic
tion by Rev. Mr. Davis, Mrs. Norvell
played the postlude, and an informal
reception was held, at which Mrs.
Davis was presented to the members
of the audience.
