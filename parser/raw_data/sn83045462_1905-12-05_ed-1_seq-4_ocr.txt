THE ST AX ha a a regular and parmahent
Family Circulation much mora than the
combined circulation of the other Wash
ington dallies. Aa a News and Adver
tising Vadium It haa no competitor. .
C7Xn order to avoid delays on account of
personal abaence, latter* to TBI! STAB
ahould not be addressed to any individual
connected with the office, but simply to
TIE STAB, or to the EcUtoiial or Bual
naai Departments, according to tenor or
purpoae.
The message Is long. But the topics are
numerous, and public interest in all of them
is keen. For this reason the document will
he carefully read and fully digested, i?nd
much of It is certain of cordial approval.
There Is a familiar ring in the treatment
of certain issues, trot that does not deprive
them of their appeal. The President, now
as at all times, speaks for the peace which
comes from a preparedness for war, for
progress without bluster or land covetous
ness, for the maintenance of the "Monroe
doctrine upon the broad lines of its present
day meaning, for a navy as fit as a fiddle,
for publicity in the piatter of political cam
paign contributions and expenditures, and
for the early completion of the Panama
canal. I'pon all these heads he repeats
the sentiments of former deliverances, and
with an emphasis which shows, how deeply
he feels and how firmly he stands. It is
Roosevelt in every line.
Attention will be particularly fixed and
held by the treatment of these subjects:
(1) Railroad rate supervision and control
by the national government. This, the
President insists. Is necessary to all the
partie.-! in interest. It is necessary to the
people, because experience shows that, lett
unrestrained, the great railroad corpora
tions have abused their opportunities and
powers at the expense of the people. It is
necessary to the railroads, because as mat
ters have been heading it would not be dif
ficult in a short tim? to lay the foundation
for a vigorous campaign for public owner
ship?something the President most earnest
ly opposes He therefore asks for a na
tional tribunal, clothed with the power to
try and decide disputed questions of rates.
There is room left for debate as to methods
of procedure, but none as to the adv.sabil
Ity of some substantial action. Congress
confronts both a condition and a theory,
and cannot. If it would, run away. We
shall have a law on this subject at this
session.
(2) National supervision of insurance.
Insurance oompanies. like railroad com
panies. control enormous sums of money,
operate under .charters, and have been
abusing the Interests of their patrons and
the public. Impatience and indignation
with their methods have been aroused by
recent disclosures, and the President holds
that a sound public policy demands the es
tablishment of a check upon such corpora
tions in the Interests of all. As the two
propositions have much in common, the
railroad proposition, which is the stronger,
should carry the other through.
(S) Chinese exclusion. The Chinese, as
immigrants, are in a class to themselves.
Foreign immigration In general needs to be
more carefully regulated, but the President,
In ^apeaking of the Chinese, declares that
berth their skilled and unskilled laborers are
undesirable fn this country, and must be
ke>pt out. As for an improved inspection,
whereby the exempted classes may And
their entrance to the,country subject to no
delay or annoying hardship, the President
voices the general wish, and the means he
suggests should answer that end. If the In
spection is transferred to China, nnd the
American service there charged with it is
made In every way worthy of and com
petent for the duty, we shall hear no more
complaint on this subject. Friends of the
exclusion law have never had any other
desire than an enforcement of the law
within the fair scope of its meaning, and
this is what the President recommends.
Nothing else is reasonably to be read into
Iiis words.
(4) Tariff revision. The little boy,
munching his apple with great relish, said
to his wistful playmate standing near,
"There ain't goin' to be no core." Like
wise hereT There ain't goin' to be no tariff
revision. ? Tfce President's personal views
are his own, and as a separate proposition
standpatishi is probably not in favor with
him. But- he does not in his message, and
probably will not !n any other, ask for
revision by this Congress, and so the Issue
goes lr,to next year's congressional cam
paigns. and thence into the next presiden
tial campaign. Oet ready.
Some of the ladles among Jack London's
readers and auditors are showing a disposi
tion to make a fuss over him. Mr. London
should recall the embarrassments which
befell one Mr. Hobson and be wary.
It remains to be seen whether President
Roosevelt will get as much applause from
the democratic congressmen as he got from
the democratic audiences on his recent tour.
St. Petersburg would give a great deal to
experience the exhilaration that comes to
the capital of a great nation when Congress
assembles.
The President is entirely correct In his
recommendation, strongly expressed in his
message to Congress, that the District
should be freed from the smoke evil and
that to that end the- law on the subject
should be effectively enforced. No fcuw is
worth a picayune unless it Is applied and
works the end for which It Is framed.
And It Is on that very ground that the
District hopes to see the smoke law so
amended that Its enforcement is possible.
As It stands. It Is impracticable, uncertain
and uneven in Its bearing upon the com
munity. It is the worst possible law to at
tempt to enforce as the President suggests,
with heavier lines, with imprisonment for
repeated offenses and with Injunctions pro
hibiting the continuance of plants which
frequently fall under the ban.
On the other hand such a law as that
proposed in the bill which the President re
fused to sign last March wou'd be properly
subject to the radical methods of enforce
ment outlined In the terms of the message.
That bill offered to the business commun
ity relief from the uncertainties of the
present law, made certain the detection or
all violators, and at the same time per
mitted the furnace owners of Washington
i to operate their plants in a practical man
ner without paying heavy and often In
equitable penalties for technical violations
which they cun not possibly avoid.
The smoke law as It stands today is in
its own terms absolutely prohibitive of aii
dense smoke emissions. It Is utterly Im
practicable. Its enforcement to the letter
would close every power and beating plant
In the capital or else subject their owners
to constant prosecutions. No business man
would be safe from accusation at any hour.
The health officer, recognizing this result
of an absolute enforcement, has adminis
tratively and arbitrarily amended the law
to grant one-minute emissions without pen
alty. Experience has proved this margin
to be insufficient Save In rare Instances
It to Impossible to operate & furnace wltti
The Message.
Smoke.
out causing occasional emissions of more
than a minute. Other cities have passed
through the same course and have found
that to secure practicable and equitable
smoke regulation It Is necessary to grant
permissible smoking periods not to exceed
three minutes continuously, and they have
wisely limited the total number 6f such
periods during the day. The law whlcn
failed last spring was based upon a careful
analysis of all the existing working stat
utes In force in other cities. It was a rea
sonable. definite, equitable, smoke-limiting
measure, the nearest possible approach In
terms of business necessities to a smoke
preventing law.
Given such a law. there would be no rea
son to question the wisdom or Justice of
the President's recommendations. Apply
ing tliem, however, to the law as it stands,
and tliey threaten, if adopted and en
forced, to throw Into jail fully one-half of
the business men of Washington and per
manently to close two-thirds of the power
plants. Such a system of punishments, on
Jhe basis of even the health officer s gra
tuitous interpretation of the statute, would
paralyze the District. s
Let us be reasonable in all things, even in
smoke. Give the city an equitable law that
will work, and there will be no objection
to any degree of rigid enforcement, for then
the sincere believers in a practically
smoke-free Washington will be gratified to
see the real offenders given their deserts,
instead of escaping, as at present, in the
multitude of technical and Involuntary of
fenders. with whom the existing law con
fuses tl'.em.
District Finances.
The manifold details of municipal admin
istration are set forth In the District Com
missioners' report, submitted today to the
President and transmitted by him to Con
gress. If this report is read carefully by
every member of the two houses there will
be a clearer conception of the federal city
and its needs and opportunities than ob
tained before. The Commissioners show
that while much has been accomplished
toward making Washington an ideal capi
tal In point of municipal equipment, much
remains to be done to give it the flr9t-class
outfit and administrative machinery suit
able to Its station.
The financial difficulties which confront
the Commissioners are plainly set fosth,
and they explain that there Is no reason to
regard the local revenues as inadequate or
as unduly subject to demands for current
maintenance or permanent improvements.
Only because Congress has Insisted upon re
quiring the District to pay as it goes for
all Its great public works which in other
cities are financed upon a long-term basis,
are the local revenues Inadequate to meet
the annual appropriations. If Congress
would permit the District to follow the
example of all other cities and all business
corporations, and borrow on a long-term ar
rangement the money needed for the rail
road terminal Improvement charges, for
the large sewer constructions, for bridges,
for public buildings, for filtration and for
other projects which are intended for use
in the long course of years and for which
the users of another generation should be
required in some measure to pay, the local
income would amply suffice to meet all
needs.
The Commissioners wisely proceed on the
assumption that Congress intends to con
tinue to allow the District to spend more
annually than Its yearly Income at present,
and they have submitted estimates consid
erably higher than a sum double the esti
mated tax revenues of the municipality.
Any other course would both greatly crip
ple the administrative work and check the
progress on the permanent improvements.
The District, Indeed, could not be properly
managed on any smaller allowance of main
tenance money, and it certainly could not
advance at a proper rate In its construction |
of a suitable capital equipment if the funds
were all expended in the work of running
the machinery of the District. The entire
sum of the tax revenues is not urgently
needed at present for current maintenance.
Annual payments Into a sinking fund could
easily be made to provide for the extin
guishment in the course of twenty years of
a large debt Incurred In the execution of
an elaborate program of public works. That
is the rational, equitable method of financ
ing the national capital. The method In
vogu$ Is a make-shift, hand-to-mouth ar
rangement which does Justice to nobody
and crloples the District at every turn. It
Is to be hoped that the matter will be reme
died at this session of Congress by the
adoption of a paragraph In the appropria
tion bill refunding the present floating debt
to the federal treasury and opening a Dis
trict credit in the sum of a sufficient num
ber of millions to cover the cost of all the
permanent works now under construction or
Immediately In prospect.
Congress has some matters of extraor
dinary importance before It. but the usual
assurance may b^ extended that It will not
do anything precipitate.
Judge Alton B. Parker can stand a great
deal more in the way of political revelations
than he could when he first left the ideal
atmosphere of the bench.
President Roosevelt is a man of too much
foresight not to have figured on a certain
amount of red tape obstruction to be over
come in building the Panama canal.
Yesterday's adjournment showed that the
U. S. Senate can do some things quite
rapidly.
All the prominent members of Congress
are reported to be looking fresh and fit.
That careworn expression will come later.
Mr. Cannon was sure enough of the
speakership to be formally grateful for It
In advance on Thanksgiving day.
The Statehood Contest.
The President in his message recommends
two new states, Indian Territory and Okla
homa forming one and Arizona and New
Mexico the other, and the recommendation
should count for much In the statehood
contest. His knowledge of the situation ifi
thorough, and his sympathy with the peo
ple of those sections has repeatedly been
manifested. As a young man he roamed all
over the west and the southwest, as an
author he has studied and described their
development, and as the chief executive or j
the country he has spoken for the reclama
tion and enrichment of their arid lands, and
made their representative people particu
larly welcome at the White House. He car.
not; be accused, therefore, either of short
sightedness or unfriendliness In the stand
he takes for the settlement of a question
which long has vexed the country, and
which by delay seems to grow In difficulty
all the time.
It would be superfluous to go over the
grounds of the contests at this time. They
have repeatedly been stated, and have not
changed in the slightest since the latest
statement. The hot battle in the last Con
gress was fought on lines which still re
main, and. with the exception of Mr. Quay,
whom death meanwhile has taken, the old
commanders on either side are still in
charge of the forces. They know each
other's formations and tactics, and the vic
tors in this new struggle will earn what
they get. Nobody is likely to go to sleep
on hts watch.
Now, aa heretofore, the difficulty la in
Joining Arlsona and New Mexico in the holy j
bonds of statelock. There are interest* la
both territories which oppose the match
They are largely personal and financial,
but some are political. It Is useless to try
to keep polities oat of such * question. It
enters Into everything? with us, and con
trols many things absolutely. Ambitious
and able men. with their eyes on office, or
orj strengthening their party in Congress
by votes in the Senate, are busy now trying
to make tw/? states grow where one should
do, and they are not to be despised In the
equation.
But there are men?some of them in high
places?.whose attitude In the premises is
open to serious criticism. They are oppos
ing union and statehood on the score of
their pocketbooks. Their sole consideration
seems to b*> of tax rates and the value of
mining Investments, and some of them are
non-residents. If any such are members of
either house of Congress should they not
feel a delicacy In voting In a matter In
which they are thus financially interested?
Do they not stand somewhat In the relation
of a Judge or Juror In the case?
Watterson.
It so turns out that Mr. Watterson, who
for years has been a leader in the cause of j
tariff reform, and on more than one occa
sion the particular leader to prevent a
retrograde movement of his party on that
subject, has been In town revisiting the
glimpses of the political moon and looking
into matters present and prospective. He
finds his party friends few In number in
Congress, and the issue to which he has
given so much thought and language in
something of a pocket. The republicans,
for tactical and other reasons, are shy of
it, and the democrats not as united as men
should be to whom genuine and aggressive
reform must look for ultimate success. Mr.
\\}atterson himself yields nothing to time
or circumstances. He stands where he
stood years ago, in favor of a tariff for
revenue only, and as convinced that his
party has nothing to promise itself from
a halting or temporizing policy. Which
makes The Star's suggestion?although not
welcome to Mr. Watterson?of a seat In the
Senate for the distinguished Kentuckian
the more to the point, and the basis of
what would be hope for a tariff renalssancei
Mr. "Patterson's personal welcome in
W a9hington?participated in by men of
both parties and all parties, and even
b> men to whom politics makes no stirring
appeal-Is always of the heartiest. A native
of the city. and a resident during his prep
aration for the career which has been so
useful and distinguished, he Is on familiar
i?round here, and in the presence of activ
ities which he thoroughly understands, ana
among many public servants with whom
his relations are most cordial. He carries
his years as though he liked the weight,
and actually thrived under it.
Mr. harton of Illinois desired to know
the meaning of the phrase "congressional

Mr. w harton's personal appearance was in
itself a complete answer to the question.

The New Congress.
From the New York Tribune.
The Fifty-ninth Congress assembled yes
terday with a large republican majority, in
which It is Impossible not to take satisfac
tion as an evidence of the people's trust in
the party and Its policies, but which from
other points of view Is not without Its dis
advantages. Speaker Cannon's short ad
dress acknowledging his deserved re-elec
tion, after promising faithful and Impartial
performance of duty on his part. Justly en
forced upon the minds of the members their
duty to attend to business and make the
session a success.
It not infrequently happens in legislative"
bodies that a small majority Is really more
competent to transact business than a very
large one, bccause under u greater sense
of responsibility.

Christmas Cards, Booklets, Diaries and Calendars?Main Floor, G Street.
be ipeo^le's Cforietma
UR mammoth establishment, covering eight acres, is in complete and brilliant holiday array.
Ten spacious entrances frorn the four boundary streets, Tenth, Eleventh, F and G, open into more than a score of splendid de
partments on the main floor, and nine commodious and safe elevators carry the thousands of patrons to the seven upper floors.
The wide aisles are so perfectly arranged that, notwithstanding a multitude of people may be passing through them, there is no
crowding and no unpleasant jostling.
However, as the Christmas days approach, the tide of shoppers swells to overflowing proportions, and those who do not enjoy being in .1
crowd will find it less taxing to make their purchases without delay. These will be delivered at any time as directed, even up to and including
Christmas eve.
The thoughtful buyer will make an effort to shop during the morning hours, as the great masses often wait until the later hours of the
day. Necessarily stocks in every department are daily depleted. And, although new goods arrive every day, those who shop early have choice
of many rare and beautiful articles that cannot be duplicated.
In a number of departments are displayed unique creations that were made for us from our own designs, and they are not obtainable in
any other establishment.
Those who defer their shopping realize how impossible it is to duplicate goods made specially for us.
Our present holiday stock surpasses a*y we have heretofore offered, both in importations and American goods.
For many months our personal representatives searched the greatest markets and the most celebrated factories of the world to obtain a
supply sufficient in quality and quantity to meet the demands of our thousands of patrons. Their instructions were to buv freely and of the
best. Their refined taste, excellent judgment and unremitting efforts are abundantly evidenced in the rare and splendid collections displayed
throughout our vast emporium.
The entire establishment is in readiness for our patrons by eight o'clock every morning.
When you have more than two purchases to make use the shopping card. It is quicker and easier for you, saves much waiting for change,
easier for us and makes deliveries more prompt and certain.
Please take small parcels with you when practicable.
Above all, see that salespeople get your name and address correct.
