LENCTHY MESSAGE
One of the Most Voluminous Docu
ments Ever Handed Down From
White House Road In Congress
RECEIVED CLOSE ATTENTION
Lawmakers Gave Close Heed to the I
Recommendations of the President
tw
on the Many Topics That Are Now
Engaging the Nations Thought
Washington Doc 3 Both houses of
congress convened today to hear the
e
presidents message This proved one
of the most voluminous documents
over handed down from the White I
House but its reading was followed I
closely by the members who held I
printed copies of the same while th e I
reading was going on From the close I
attention paid to tho numerous sub
divisions of the message it was evi
dent that President Roosevelts sev
oral recommendations wore being
thoughtfully considered
Among tho suggestions contained in
that voluminous document are the fol
lowing
The founders of the constitution
provided that the national government
should have complete and sole control
of interstate commerce Only the na
tional government can in thorough
going fashion exercise the needed con
trol
trolThere
There should bo nn extension of
federal activity This is not advocat
ing centralization It is merely look
Ing fnota In the face There must be
no halt In the healthy constructive
course of action which this nation has
elected to pursue The federal court
mint decide ultimately what are the
respective spheres of state and nation
In connection with any law
In my Judgment there should now
be either a national Incorporation act
or Ii law licensing railway companies
to engage In interstate commerce upon
certain conditions There should be
additional legislation looking to the
proper control of the great business
concern engaged in interstate busi
ness Uxperlence has definitely shown
not merely the unwiadntn but the fu
tility of endeavoring to put a stop to
all buelting combinations Modern
industrial condition are such that
combination Is not only necessary but
Inevitable
The antl trust law should not be
repealed lint It shoul be made both
more efficient and more In harmony
with actual condltlona This snould
be accompanied by provision for the
compulsory publication of accounts
and the subjection of books and pa
pars lo the Inspection of government
ofilclnlB A combination should not be
tolerated If It alnme the power acquir
ed by combination to the public detri
ment Among the points to be aimed
at should be the prohibition of un
healthy competition such as by ren
dering s rvlcu at an actual loss for
tho purpose of crushing out competi
thin the prevention of Inflation of cap
ital and the prohibition of a corpora
tlonp making exclusive trade with
MtM a condition of having any trade
with Itself
In tho recent business crisis It is
noteworthy that the Institutions which
failed were Institutions which were not
under tho supervision and control of
tho national government Those
which were under national control
stood the test
Those who foar from any reason
the extension or federal activity will
do well to study the history not only
of the national banking act but of the
pure food law and notably the meat
Inspection law recently enacted
t Wo need a greater elasticity In our
currency provided of course that we
recognize the even greater need of a
safe and secure currency Provisions
should ho made for an emergency cur
rency
This country is definitely commit
ted to the protective system and any
effort to uproot It could not but cause
widespread Industrial disaster But In
n country of such phenomenal growth
as ours It Is probably well that every
dozen yoars or so the tariff laws
should co carefully scrutinized so as to
srl6 tint no exctHHlvo or Improper ban
eflts lire conferred thereby
When our tax laws are revised tho
question of an Income tax and an In
br rltanco tax should receive the care
t attention of our legislators In my
jurt niont both of those taxes should
b part of our system of federal taxa
tionTho
Tho conservation of our natural re
sroOH and their proper use const
t 3 the fundamental problem which
u lerllen almost every other problem
o our national life There should bo
n tariff on any forest product grown
in this country and In especial there
eould ho no tariff on wood pulp
I commend to the favorable consid
eratlon of congress a postal savings
I bank system as recommended by the
pbstmaator general and for an extan
sion 01 me parcel post especially on I
EI rural routes
I again recommend that tho rights
of citizenship be conferred upon tho
people of Porto Rico
The need for collecting largo cam
paign funds would vanish if congress
provided an appropriation for the
proper and legitimate expenses of each
of the great national parties
In foreign affairs this countrys
steady policy Is to behave toward oth
er nations as a strong and selfrespect
ing man should behave toward the
other man with whom he is brought
into contact

Georgetown Ky Dec 6The tfttor
leys for Caleb Powers in their cross

presence of the mob in Frankfort prior
to the shooting of Goebel could be ac
counted for by the fact that the con
tests were in progress in the legisla
ture but tho commonwealth drew at
tention to the fact that his crowd was
heavily armed The defense also
ought to show that the absence of the
mountain crowd from the capitol
grounds on the fatal day was due to
the cold and blustering weather but
senators and representatives on the
stand denied that this was the condi
tion of the weather

Hon Wm G Hunter Uses
Peruna As a Family
Medicine
WHEN a man of undoubted reputa

thing genuine to account for It
Hon W G Hunter of North Caro

throughout the Southern States says of
Poruna that he regards it as the greatest
family medicine ever discovered
He does not hesitate to say that
Peruna Invigorates and gives fresh
strength to mind and body
Such testimonials as this ought to
make Pornna popular
No advertising known to the arts of
man no commercial management could
ever raise Pornna to such a high stand

Mr Matthew OHare 145 William St
Fall River Mass writes
About four years ago I consulted a
physician to got relief from a cold
which had stopped up my head and also
settled on my lungs resulting In ca
tarrh and also throat difficulties
He gave mo some medicine but four
months faithful uso of the same did me
no good I then tried other doctors but
it was just the same
So I decided to try Poruna and after
using two bottles my lungs began to
heal I did not cough nearly so much
i and slept bettor
In sir months the cough catarrh
and throat difficulties wore all cured
I was pleased with tho result and
wish to write you of it Seven bottle

When I brough t the first bottle home

were both cured
I am willing to state that Pornna
