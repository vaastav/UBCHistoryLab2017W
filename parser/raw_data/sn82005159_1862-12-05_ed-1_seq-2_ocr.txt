Tlie Eise in Printing Paper.
We have been furnishing our subscribers the
Gazette, for the last five years, for $1.50 per
annum, if paid in advance, or £2.00 if paid
within tho year, adding 50 cents if payment
was delayed so long as to make it necessary for
D 3 to pay interest on the expense of publishing
the paper. All this while the paper on which
we printed cost us §7.00 per bundle, or $3.50
per ream. But a change, has come over the
spirit of the paper manufacturer's dreams. He
now demands of us $14.00 per bundle, or $7.00
per ream, just twice as much its hnttafore / Now,
dear reader, with this prospect before us, how
ere we to "keep the wolf from the door?" How
are wo to continue to print your paper and how
will you be able to pay us a price which would
give us the same nctt income as formerly'? There
is no way in which this can be accomplished,
for, if we were to double our rates, (as our ex
penses are doubled) then you could not well af
ford to continue your subscription. But we
ore willing to suffer two-thirds of the addition
al expense, if you will bear the remaining third.
And to do this, we need but bring back the
Gazette to the rate at which it was published
before it came into our hands, $2.00 per annum,
if paid within the year. We shall lose money
wen at this rate, and for less it would he im
possible to publish the paper lit all. We think
this a very liboral price, under the circumstan
ces; indeed, much more so than $1.50, when
printing paper was cheap; and shall look with
-confidence for the continued support of our pat
rons. We are determined to.publishthe Gazette
bntil the last greenback vanishes from our pock
ets; so, friends, you might as well stand by us
to the end.
The following is a schedule of our rates un

Another Abolition Plot.
The result of the recent elections indicates
that the lower house of the next Congress will
be Democratic by a good "working majority."
tint the Abolitionists are not without some hope
of being yet able to render nugatory the ex
pression of popular sentiment at the polls. We
observe that they intend to contest the scat of Mr.
Lascar, from the Greene district, on the ground
that the military vote was not counted. It is also
announced, by Forney, that Florida (a slate al
most wholly under the control of the Southern
Confederacy) will send a full Abolition delegation
to ask admission to seats in Congress. And
now, to cap the climax of their dark plot to
stifle the voice of the free people of the North
in Congress, the Pontifex Maximus of Aboli
tionism, the great father Abraham, at Wash
ington, issues instructions to his military satraps
la Tennessee to hold an election for members of
Congress, hoping that the Secessionists will aid
the Abolitionists (their co-conspirators in the
destruction of the Union) by permitting and
conniving at the election of some unprincipled
scoundrels, who for the sake of office and emol
ument, will be ready to do any thing to add fury
to the folly of secession, even if it be to assist
Su carrying through Congress the emancipation
scheme of our astute and sapient President.

EXECUTIVE MANSION, )
WASHINGTON, October 21, 13G2. }
Major General Grant, Governor Johnson and all
having Military, lYavul and Civil authority un
der the Umlcd States tnthin the State of Ten-
The bearer of this, Thomas li. Smith, a cit
iren of Tennessee, goes to that State, seeking
to hate such of the people thereof as desire to
avoid the unsatisfactory prospect before them, j
and to have peace again upon the old terms un-1
dor the constitution of the United States, to I
manifest such desire by elections of members to I
the (.ongreas of the United States particularly, i
and perhaps a Legislature, State olHcera and a <
jJnited States Senator friendly t„ their object.
I shall be glad for you and each of you to aid him
and all others acting for the object as much as
possible. In all available ways give the people
a chance to cipress .their wishes at those elec
tions. Follow law and form of Uiw as far as
VmvtnuM i but at all events get the emrcsmn of
the largest number of people possible. All see
how much will connect with and effeat the proc
lamation of September 22d. Of course; the
men elected should be gentlemen of character
twilijif to swear support to the Constitution as
uf ami known to be above reasonable us-
picion of duplicity. Your.-, Very respectfully,
A. LINCOLN.
Time was when the people chose their repre
i sentalives in Congress, without dictation frotn
any person or authority on earth, saving the
rules and regulations contained in their awn
state constitutious and laws. But President
Lincoln imagines himself an autocrat, and hence,
that Constitutions and laws ate inferior to his
dictum, and that the people must obey him nnd
not he the people. lie tells his shoulder strapped
minions in Tennessee "to follow law and
forms of law as far as convenient leaving then
to understand that when the law is not '•conve
nient," they can hold the election just as they
please. This would be an excellent arrange
ment for those peculiar admirers of free elec
tions, the Baltimore Plug Uglics, but hardly
comes up to the idea of the privilege to exer
cise the elective franchise, generally entertained
by decent white men. lie also tells his vice
gerents what kind of men should be elected.
They must be men of "character." If they
are in the habit of profane swearing (especial
ly at the doings of the Administration) or if
they tell vulgar anecdotes (of which the Presi
dent has the rightful monopoly ) or if they do
not believe in the gospel of John Brown, the
people must not be allowed to vote for thcin.—
(Glorious free America! Thy people can still
take part in elections !) —And, then, the persons
elected be "willing to swear to support the
Constitution as of old!" just as if any scoundrel
whodared refuse to take the oath to support the
Constitution, would be admitted to a seat iu Con
gress! Bui t'.io President, doubtless, mount by
Wearing "to support the Constitution, as of
old," what he and his Abolition compeers have
been doing from the beginning, v iz: swearing
to support the Constitution, with a rn ental res
ervation that when it is not "convenient" to
support it, to break it. But let not Abraham
vex himself. Let not his bosom be agitated,
lest those tender lambs, the office- holders, who
rest therein so snugly, be disturbed in their se
rene repose. The Democracy will take care of
the next Congress, and will sec that no man
who tells worse, anecdotes than the President,
or has greater distaste than lie for the oath to
support the Constitution, shall be honored with
a seat in the halls of the Nation.
Notice to Western Subscribers.
Wc have a number of subscribers scattered

who have never paid us a cent. We give no

and when a short distance on the way, he and
his wife and two little boys were surrounded
by one of those fierce and rapidly moving col
umns of fire which often sweep over the west
ern prairies, and were consumed, nothing hut a
few relics of their charred bodies being left by
the flames. Three of the children, who were
driving the cattle, succeeded in escaping.

The Diplomatic Correspondence on Medi
ation —France's Overtures to England
and Russia—Reply of Earl Russell.
The following is the despatch of tho French
Minister of Foreign Affairs addressed to the
eniliussadors of France at London and St. P.
tersburg: •
PARIS, October 30.
Europe watches with painful interest the
struggle which has been raging more thun a
year upon the American continent. Tho hos
tilities have provoked sacrifices and efforts cer
tainly of u nature to inspire tlte highest idea of
the perseverance and energy of the two popu
lations. llut this spectacle, which docs so much
honor to their courage, is only given at tl(e
price of numberless calamities and u prodigious
effusion of blood. To these results of civfl
war, which from the very first assumed vajl
proportions, there is still to be added the appre
hension of servile war, which would be tho cul
minating point of so many irreparable disaster}.
The suffering of a nation toward which wo lmyc
always professed a sincere friendship would
have sufficed to excite the sincere solitude if
the. emperor, even had we ourselves not suffer
ed by the counterblow of these events.
Under the influence of intimate relations
which extensive intercourse has multiplied be
tween the various regions of the globe, Europs
itself lias suffered from the consequences of tlte
crisis, which has dried up'one of the most fruit
ful sources of public wealth, and which bccomt,
for the great centres of labor, a cause of niot
sad trials.
I As you are aware, when the conflict conj
[ menced, wo held it our duty to observe tHa
most strict neutrality iu concert with the mat
at hue Powers, and the Washington Cabinet
has repeatedly acknowledged the honorable raai
! nor with which wc adhered to that line of col-
duct. Tlic sentiments dictated to us have u
dergone no change hut of a benevolent diame
ter. That neutrality, instead of imposing on
the Powers the attitude which might resemble
indifference ought rather to make them Of ser
vice to the two parties, by helping them out f
a position which seems to have no issue. From
the commencement of the war an armed foroe
was set on foot by the belligerents, which since
then has almost continually been kept up. Af
ter so much bloodshed, they arc now, in that
respect, nearly in the same position—nothing
authorizing the presumption that more decisive
military operations will shortly occur, nccor 4-
ingtothe last news received in Europe. The two
armies, on the contrary, were in a condition
that would not allow either party to hope, with
in a brief delay, for any decided advantage to
turn the balance and accelerate the conclusion
of a peace.
All these circumstances, taken together, point
to the opportunity of an armistice, to which,
moreover, under the present circumstances, no
strateg icul objection can he made. The favor
, able disposition towards peace, which are be
ginning to manifest themselves in the North,
us well as in the South, might, on the other
1 hand, second steps that might Is? made to rec
ommend the idea of truce. The Emperor has,
therefore, thought that the occasion has pre
sented itself of offering to the belligerents the
support of the good offices of tiie maratime
Powers; and his Majesty has charged mo to
make the proposition of this Government m
ot Russia. The three Cabinets would exert
their inHuonee at Washington, as well as with
tlie Confederates, to obtain an armistice for six
months, during which every act of war, direct
or indirect, should provision!)- cease on sea as
well as on land, and it might be, if necessary,
ulteriorly prolonged.
The overtures, I need not say, sic, would not
imply, on our part, and judgment on the origin
or issue of the struggle, nor any pressure upon
the negotiations which might, it is to he hoped,
ensue in favor of an armistice. Our task would
consist solely in smoothing down obstacles, and
in interfering only in a measure determined up
on by ttie two parties.
We should not, in fact, believe ourselves call
ed upon to decide, hut to prepare the solution
of difficulties which hitherto have opposed rec
onciliation between the belligerent parties.—
Would not, moreover, an agrcemenn between
the three courts respond sufficiently to their in
tentions? Would it not give to their step the
character of evident impartiabilily ? Acting in
concert, they would combine the conditions best
suited to inspire confidence.
The Government of the Emperor, by the con
stant tradition of French policy towards the -
nited States—England, by the community of
race—Russia, by the marks of friendship she
has never ceased to show to the Washington
Cabinet. Should the event not justify the hope
of the three Powers, and should the ardor of
the struggle overrule the wisdom of their coun
cils, this attempt would not he less honorable
for them. They would have fulfilled a duty of
humanity, more especially indicated in a war
which has excited passions which render al di
rect attempts at negotiation more difficult. It
is the mission which international law assigns
neutrals at the same time it prescribes to them
a strict impartiality, and they could never make
a nobler use of their influence than by endeav
oring to put an end to a struggle which causes
so much suffering, and compromises such great
interests throughout the whole world.
Finally, even without immediate results, these
overtures would not be entirely useless, for they
might encourage public opinion to views of con
ciliation, and thus contribute to hasten the mo
ment when the return of peace might booomc
possible.
I request you, sir, in the name of his Majes
ty, to submit these considerations to Lord Rus
sell or to Prince Gortchakoff, begging him to
state the views of the Government of her Bri
tanie Majesty or the Court of Russia.

EAUI. RUSSELL'S REPLY.
The following despatch was addressed by Earl
Russel to Earl Cowley, her Majesty's ambassa
dor at Puris:
FOREIGN OFFICE, Nov. 13.
My Lord: The Count do Flahault came to
the Foreign Office by appointment on Monday,
10th inst., and read to me a despatch from M.
Drouyn de L'Huys relating to the civil war in
in North America. [Earl Russell here goes on
to recapitulate the contents of tho French des
patch, and then says :]
Such is in substance the proposal of the Gov
ernment of the Emperor of the French, and I
need hardly say that it has attracted the seri
ous attention of her Majesty's Government
Her Majesty is desirous of acting in concurrence
with France upon the great questions now agi
tating the world, and upon none more than on
tho contingencies connected with the great
struggle now going on In North America.—
Neither her Majesty, the Quoen, nor tho Brit
isli will ever forget the noble and emphatic
manner in which the Emperor of the French
vindicated the laws of nations and assisted tho
cause of peace in the instance of the seizure of
the Confederate Commissioners on board the
Trent. Her Majesty's Government recognizes
with pleasure the design of arresting the prog
ress of war by friendly measures, the benevo
lent views and humane intentions of the Em
peror. They are also of the opinion that if the
steps proposed were to be taken, the concur
rence of Russia would be extremely desirable.
Her Majesty's Government have, however,
not been informed up to the present time that
the Russian Government have agreed to 00-op
crate with England and France on this occasion,
although that Government may support the en
deavors of England and France to obtain the
end proposed, lint is the end proposed attain
able at the present moment by the course sug
gested by the Government of France ! Such
is the question which has been and carefully ex
amined by her Majesty's Government. After
weighing all the information which has been
received from America, her Majesty's Govern
mctic are led to the conclusion that there is no
ground at the present moment to hope that the
Federal Government would accept the propo
sal suggested, and a refusal from Washington
at the present time would prevent any speedy
renewal of the offer. Her Majesty's Govern
ment think, therefore, that it would be better
to watch carefully the progress of opinion in A
mcrica, and if, as there appears reason to hope,
it may be found to have undergone, or may un
dergo hereafter, any change, the three courts
might then avail themselves of such change to
offer their friendly counsel with a greater pros
pect than now exists of its being accepted by
the two contending parties,
Her Majesty's Government will communicate
to that of France any intelligence they may re
ceive from Washington or Kichniund, bearing
011 this important subject.
Your Excellency may read this despatch to
M. Drouyn de L'Huys, and give him a copy of
it. [Signed] RUSSELL.

We come to thee, in our prayers, to he direct

that thy servants are met again in the Capitol,

we remember with the deepest reverence and
humiliation that it has not pleased Thee to ful

they stand in more than Jewish reverence, and
in more than Roman virtue before Thy people.
Remove far away from this body and the mem
bers of manners, all profanity and volubility of
speech and all unworthy motives and desires j
to give to them all wisdom and gravity, and
prosperity and influence with the people"
HOUSE. —The proceedings were opened with
prayer by the Rev. Mr. Stockton, Chaplain, in
the course of which he returned thanks for tho
brightening prospects of liberty for the slave,
and for our emancipation from a system which
lie said has involved us in so much sin, sorrow
and shame, and for a renewed Union with great
er- power, insuring tho enjoyment of every bles
sing and the prosperity of the nation.
The roll of the House was called by States,
and a quorum answered to their names.
A message was received from the Senate,
that a quorum of that body has assembled and
was ready to proceed to business.
On motion of Mr. Wnehbume, IU, a similar
message was sent to the Senate, and at his in
stance a committee wits ordered to be appointed
to act in conjunction with a similar one of the
Senate to wait upon the President and inform
him that they are ready to receive any commu
nication he may lie pleased to make.
Mr. Vallandigham, of Ohio, offered a reso
lution, which was adopted, that the Committee
| on the Judiciary be instructed to inquire and
j report to the House at an early day by what
i authority of the Constitution or law, if any,
the Postmaster General unlertakes to decido
what newspapers may and what shall not be
transmitted through the mails of the United
States.
Mr. Cox, of Ohio, offered the following:
Whereas , many citizens of the United States
have been seized by persons pretending to be
acting under the authority of the United States,
and have been carried out of the jurisdiction
of the States of their residence, and imprison
ed in the military prisons and camps of tho U
ten States, without any further charge being
preferred ngrttnst them, and without any op
portunity being allowed to learn or disprove the
charges made or alleged to be made against
them, and
• Whereas, Such arrests have been made in
States where there was no insurrection or re
bellion, or pretence thereto; and
Whereas, It is the sacred right of every citi
zen that he shall not be deprived of his liberty
without due process of law, and, when arrested,
shall have a speedy and public trial by an im
partial jury;
Therefore, Resolved, That the House of Rep
resentatives do hereby condemn all such arrests
and practises as unwarranted by the Constitu
tion and laws of tho United States, and is a
usurpation of power never given up by the peo
ple to their rulers, and do hereby demand that
all such arrests shall therefore cease, and that
all persons so arrested and yet hefd shall have
a prompt and public trial, according to the pro
visions of the Constitution.
On motion of Mr. Colfax of Indiana, tho pre
amble and resolution was tablod—yeas 80, nays

Mr. Richardson of Illinois, offered a resolu
tion, that the President be requested to inform
tho Houso what citizens of Illinois are now
confined in Forts Warren, Lafayette and Dela

forts and places of codfinement, and upon what
charges they were arrested and that tho Presi
dent inform the House the names of tho por

A Raid in Frederick County.
ROCKVILLE, ML, NOV. 27.
From gentlemen of undoubted veracity I
learn that a detachment of White's guerillas,
on Tuesday night last, visited the town of Ur
bana, in the lower part of Frederick county,
and seized the postmaster there (Mr. Thomas
Smith) and his clerk, (Frank Harris, Jr.,) with
the intention of conveying thorn, as prison
ers, to.Virginia. Mr. Smith succeeded in ma
king his escape, but young Harris, in attempt
ing to follow liiin, received a shot which took
effect in the region of the heart, and it is
thought that he can live but a few days.
Thanksgiving day is being generally observed
in this locality ; all business is suspended, and
there are services in most of the churches.

The Delay in the Advance of the Army.
The Washington correspondent of the X. Y.
Times say:—Very general disposition is mani
fested here to cast upon Gen. Meigs tho re
sponsibility for the failure of the Army of the
Potomac to make an advance. It is now sta
ted that when Gens. Halleck and Meigs visited
Gen. Ilnrnsidc, it was pomisad that certain ne
cessary articles should be at Falmouth on the
arrival of the army, and that the want of these
prevented the crossing of the river before the
reinforcement of the enemy. It is further sta
ted, on good authority, that notwithstanding
an abundance of supplies at Aquia Crock, the
tho army is actually in want of transportation
for its conveyance. For some reasons, many
divisions are again destitute of shoes and cloth

months—and has to borrow money from homo

Congress, well guarded in its provisions.
The President encloses his emancipation proc
lamation of .September, and says there is no
line, straight or crooked, suitable for a partial
boundary upon which to divide.
lie recommends the adoption of an amend*
mcnt to the Constitution, proposing thut every
State in which slavery exists shall abolish the sumo
therein before the Ist of January, 1900, and
the owners to be compensated by the United
y tales.
All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual free*
dom by the chances of the war at any time be
fore the end of the rebellion, shall bo forever
free, but all owners of such who have not been
disloyal, shall be compensated for them.
Congress may appropriate money for th.i
colonization of free colored persons with their
own consent at any place or places without the
United States.
The President treats the measure at sorno

slavery it could not contiuue.
Reflect Deeply—Judge Wisely.
War, Pestilence and Famine are luuked up
on as the most dire calamities to which human
ity is subject ; yet there is a silcut agent at work,
among us, slaying by night and by day, whose
victims are scarcely less numerous. The scourge
to which we refer is the mat-treatment of disease.
That thousands of human beings annually drug
themselves to death, or are drugged to death by
others, is a fact that no one will have the te
merity to deny. The question is cannot this e
vil be obviated? Are there not remedies in ex
istence competent to the cure of nearly all the
internal and superficial maladies to which our
bodies are liable ? Dr. Hoiaoway, certainly
one of the foremost physicians of our age, claims
to have originated two preparations, a Pill and
an Ointment, which strike directly at the germs
of disease in the blood and other animal fluids,
and obliterate them. How shall wo test the
truth of this claim? If we call for evidence,
we find that the witnesses in favor of the rem
edies are "a multitude that no man can num
ber." They are of all conutries and races.—
The Chinese, tho Malays, the South American
Indians, the reel men of our own territories,
join with tho civilized world inuccordiugto tbesu
medicines most extraordinary curative pro par
ties. We see not how such testimony can bo
considered other tiian conclusive, on any logic
al principle. The immense consumption of tho
Pills and Ointment in all parts of the world'
cannot be questioned. Wherever any products
of civilization are sold, t/iei/ are sold; and wher
ever they have been introduced, thoy have be
come a staple. Those are truths; we leave the
reader to make his own comments.— Plymouth:
