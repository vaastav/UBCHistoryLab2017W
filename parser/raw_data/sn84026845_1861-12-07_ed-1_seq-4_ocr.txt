jtyTHEin Names.?Wo stated yesterday
on the authority of a reliable man that the
two lieutenants recently captured near
Roroney, were Singleton and Jones. This
is a mistake. A letter was yesterday re
ceived from Col. Thoburn, stating that the
imprudent lieutenants were Hall, of Capt.
Melvin's company, and Freeman, of Capt.
Stephens' company. They were caphired
ul a place called French's, about nine miles
from Komney, whilst they were vainly en
deavoring to talk an old woman out of
souie butter.
for tiie Soldiers.?Capt.
Milhous, Co. C, 1st Va. Regiment, will
leave about the middle of next week for
Romney. His company is without mit
tens, of which they are very much in need.
He desires that the patriotic ladies of
Wheeling and Martinsville, who wish to
contribute to the comfort of the soldiers
in this respect, shall be notified. Mittens
mny be left at Rice's store in Martinsville,
or at the Government store house in this

gig-Tup. Campaign in Wkbtern Yik
oixia.?The telegerugh to-day announces
the arrival of General Rosecrans and staff"
at Wheeling, which be proposes making his
headquarters during the winter. This
means, of course, that tlie campaign is over
ill Western Virginia, and that winter quar
ters are the only matters to be attended to
at present. The enmpaigu there has been
a hard one, and our boys will doubtless be
able at the close rff the war, to look buck
upon those mountains as the scene of the
most trying experiences o< the war. Much
terrible marching and some f*ood fighting I
has been done over and about the Western
Virginia hills, but the rebels having given
up the field in disgust, our men can now
build their cabins and sit down to talk over
the events of the year.?Pitts. Chronicle.
8^"Roiibehy at the McLi.be House.?
Night before last, two or more of the nu
merous young thieves who infest the city,
went into tile McLure House and stole
ubout a hundred dollars worth of clothing
from the boarders. They raised the win
dows and tbrew the clothing into an alley I
back of the house, and their confederates
carried the articles away. The house was
full of people, and the robbery was perpe
trated at a very early hour in the evening.
flfajyNn More Cavalry.?The Govern
ment has now between sixty and seventy
thousand Cavalry,and the Secretary of War
has notified the Governors of the loyal
States, our own among the number, that 110
more Cavalry will be received. The in
complete Cavalry regiments, thereforej
must either be consolidated or mustered j
in as Infantry, or they will be disbanded.

Questions and Answers*
^ A great war] from Nonh'a Timeo and Messenger of
this week.
Question.?I am a youth of eighteen years,
have just completed my course nt the Pub
lic School, and am beginning to think at
tentively conceruing a business for life. I
have not chosen an avocation. But what
ever business I think of, I find will require
of me some knowledge that I have not,
and which ray school course neither inclu
ded nor inculcated. Wealth, of course, is
one of my^objecls, and I know it Is to be
acquired by Industry; bulla there not some
science of wealth, some fundamental rules, a
knowledge of which would aid me In my
labor? I sec men wasting their substance
iu law suits. 4 wish to learn the relation
between ordinary business transactions
and the laws of the country, that I may
ttvoid the violation of the latter, and so ci
cape litigation. Agaiu, iu our country,
?where batiks so numerous, whose Is
sues toaks most of the currency, it se*ms
to me that every business manoogbt to un
derstand the principle* of Banking and Cur
rency. Are tberc not also many valuable
maxims by men of wealth, in regard to
tbe act of acquiring and managing pro
perty ? Besides these subjucts, account
antship must be indispensable to every intel
j ligent business man, to say nothing of its
i being of itself equal to a trade or art by
' which to gain a livelihood. Can you, Mr.
Editor, direct me to the most eligible books
or other means of acquiring these various
branches of knowledge ?
Answer.?Vortunateiy it is in our power
to afford our correspondent the informa
tion he seeks. Mr. nitchcock, a gentle
man who possesses the treble advantage of
being at once a practical business mau, u
? thorough accountant, and an urbane and
skillful instructor, devotes his entire time
i to aiding young men in acquiring precise
t ly those kinds of knowledge which our cor
| respondent asks for, and to him we com
| mend all who are similarly deficient.

From Missouri.
1 Skdalia, Mo., Dec. 5.?Yesterday a p ir
ty of exasperated citizens, of all parties,
attacked a gang of returned rebels from
1 Price's army, under Capts. Young and
Wheatley, about 20 miles west of here,
j killing seven and wounding ten of them.
Among the killed was Capt Young. None
! of the citizens were killed or severely
; wounded. Three of the wounded rebels
i have since died.
Judge Birch, who has been a prisoner in
Price's camp for some time past, arrived !
here to-day, having been released on pa
role.
Rolla, Dec. 5.?Advices from the South
west say McCalloch ba9 gone into winter
quarters on Pea Ridge, near Bentousville,
Benton county, Ark., where he is putting
up barracks for his troops.
Nothing definite is known of Price's
movements.
Gen. McBride was at Springfield with
2,000 men on Sunday last.
St. Louis, Dec. 5.?Gen. Thos. L. Price,
commanding at Jeffetson City, will run for
Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the ;
expulsion of John \V. Keid.
Judge VVm. A Hall, member of the State
Convention, and M. 0. Hawkins, have been j
named for the race" in the district lately j
represented by John B Clark. Both are
understood to be strong Union men.
Kansas City, Dec. 5.?By order of Gen. i
Hunter, Col. Jennison's regiment moved U>
a point midway between Kansas City and '
Leaveuworth yesterday.
All communication between here and
Independen i3 cut off.
The rebel Hays, with 300 men, visited
Independence on Monday, and seized all
the horses belonging to the Pacific Stage
Company, and made a general confiscation
of all the property of Union citizen?.
St. Joski'ii. Dee. 5.?Gen. Prentiss made
a speech to a large crowd of citizens here
yesterday, in which he said, aAs God is
in}' judge, every secessionist in this city
shall take an oath of allegiance to the U.
S. Government and to support the Stars
and Stripes, or I will send them to work
on the trenches of Fort Smith, and all per
sons who are hereafter found expressing
secession sentiments shall take the oath." j
The speech caused great cousternation i
among the secessionists, and was received |
with applause by the loyal citizens.
Troops were sent down to Platte county j
last night to look after Sigordon's band of
rebels.
Sedalia, Dec. 5.?Our latest advices !
from the South are that Price has removed |
a part of his force from Oscela to a point
r> miles distant, where he has established
his headquarters,
Gen. Rains' command remained at Osce
ola.
A train of 50 wagons, from^ Lexington,
laden with supplies for Price's army pass
ed unmolested within 15 miles of this
pl?u-?- on Monday last.
There are four recruiting ottires op<*n
in Lexington, enlisting recruits lor Price's
army.
Meetings have been held in Lexington
and in Clay, Ray and other river counties,
urgiug a united effort in behalf of the reb
els, and subscriptions for money, clothing,
&c., are in circulation .
It is believed to lie a fact that the Coun
ty Court of Saline County (Claih Jackson's
residence) in July last authorized Commis
sioners to raise ?100,000, to i?o expended
foi the benefit o! Price's army. Other
counties along the Missouri are believed to
have done the same thii g.
It is stated on good authority that when
Price was beseiging Lexington a delega
tion of citizens was sent to him from Saline
comfy, with an urgent request that he
should not allow his army to enter that
county, which was complied with. The
reasoujor this request was the dread en
tertained bj' the inhabitants of the plun
dering propensities of Price's rebels.
The counties on the Missouri river west
of Jefferson City are the richest in the
State, and have furnished as many rneu
and as much means in behalf of the rebel
lion as the balance of the State, while they
have been almost entirely exempt tro in
marauders, and have been rarely visited by
Federal troops.
Lkavknwohtii, Dec. G.?Brig. Gen. J.
W. Denver has arrived, and has been as
signed to the command of all the Kansas
regiments.
A portion of Lane's brigade remains at
Fort Scott.
The Fourth regiment is ordered to
Wyandotte.
TheFirst Cavalry, known as Jennison's
regiment, is stationed at Johnny Leake in !
the Delaware Reservation, nearly opposite j
Parksville, Mo.
The Second regiment is nearly recruited,
and will occupy the village of Kic.ipoo, 10
miles above this city.
The river remains open, but trouble is
anticipated with marauding parties when
it freezes over.
Trains are again running on the Platte
County road, and our mail communications
east are re-established.

Disunion, of Owen county, offered a se- j
i-ics of resolutions, including a demand on
the I"filernl Government for the rytimi to
Kentucky of Ex-Governor Moorehead and
other political prisoners, and affirming
that the President's Message foreshadows
the impossibiiitj' of preserving or recon
structing the Federal Union. Referred to
the Committee on Federal Relations.
The Union members to-uight are hold
a caucus to agree upon the resolutions re- I
garditig the present stale of affairs, which
will probably be ottered to-morrow.
New Yoiik, Dec. G.?The Ship Yorkshire
from Liverpool, reports on the 28th Nov.,
in lat. 44? 14', long 60? 41', passed a
steamer, bark rigged,showing the rebel flag.
She appeared to have lost her bulwarks.
She had a spread Eagle on her stern and a
white wheelhouse. She wassteering South
East. The steamer Vanderbilt arrived
to-day, and will return to Port Roj'al im
mediately, with Quartermasters supplies.
The steamer Baltic sailed this morning for
Fort Pickens, with the 75th N. YorkReg

The French si eats frigates Pomore and

The steamer Bavaria has arrived from

The U. S. steam transport steamer Van

LoCisviLt.fi, Dec. 6.?The steamer Pink
Vsrble, from here with a cutton mill ma
chinery) proceeding to Nashville under a
permit from Secretary Chase, was seized

Gavoch, commander at Fort Donelson,
awaiting orders from Gen. Johnston. The
machinery was taken to Nashville.

From Washington
Washington, Dec. 6.?Lieut. Col. Rey
nolds lms been appointed resideut agent tU
ort Royal, under tbe general regulations
relative to seenring and disbursing of the
proper!}- found or brought within the ter
ritory now or hereafter occupied by the
U. S. forces ia the disloyal States. He has
been ordered to report to the Secretary of
the Treasury.
A bill will soon be introduced in Con
gress authorizing the organization of a
steam fire brigade, as a large amount ot
government property has recently been de
stroyed for want of some such organiza
tion. There can scarcely be a doubt ot
| the passage of the measure.
Tiler? are 46 persons from Maryland and
? irginia in tbe county jail, arrested by
constables on presumption that they are
fugitive slaves. A difficulty exists in the
WlM of their immediate discharge, from
the fact that it cannot yet be ascertained
whether they are all contraband and as
loyal citizens have the light to claim a
surrender of their propertv.
Philadelphia, Dec. 6.?Papers contain
extracts from documeuts accoiupanving the
Presidents Message relating to foreign af
fairs in the course of Secretary Seward's
instructions to Minister Adams. He says
the President neither looks lor nor expects
any actual and permanent dismemberment
of the American Union, especially by a line
of latitude. The improvement of our muny
channels ot intercourse and the perfection
of our scheme of inuernal exchanges, and
the incorporation of both of them into a
great system ot foreign commerce concur
ring with the gradual abatement of the
force of the only existing cause of aliena
tion, have carried us already beyond the
danger of disunion in that form. The so
called Confederate States, therefore in the
opinion of the President are attempting
what w*ill prove a physical impossibility-.
Necessarilv.they build the structureof their
government upon the sauie principal by
which they seek to destroy the Unioii,
namely, the right of each individual mem
ber of the Confederacy, to withdraw from
it at pleasure and in peace. Iu another part
the Secretary says : In short, all your ar
guments must belongto oneof three classes'
namely, first arguments drawn from the
principles of public law and natural justice
which regulate the intercourse of equal
states. Secondly, arguments which con
cern equally the honor, welfare and hap
piness of the whole Union. Thirdly, argu
ments which are equally conservative of
the rights and interests and ever sentiments
of the Uuited States, and just in their
bearing upon the rights, interests and sen
iments of Great Britain and all other na
tions. And again Secretary Seward says,
the President would regard it as inconsis
tent with his habitually high consideration
for the government and the people of Great
Britain to allow me to dwell longer on the
merely commercial aspect of the question
under discussion. Indeed he will not for
a moment believe that upon the considera
tion of merely financial gain, that the gov
ernment could be induced to lend ils aid
to a revolution designed to overthrow
the institutions of this country and involv
ivg ultimately llie destruction of the liber
tics of the American people.
The President will not dwell oil the
pleasant recollection that Great Britain,not
a year ago, manifested, by a marked atten
tion to the United States, her desire for a
cordial reunion, which, all ancient pre
judices and passions being buried, shall be
a pledge of mutual sympathy and interest
forever; therefore, the United Stotes are
not indifferent to the circumstances of a
common descent, language, customs and
religion, which recommend a closer sym
pathy between themselves and Great Brit
ain than either might expect in its inter
co-.rse with any other nation. The States
are one of many nations that have sprung
from Great Britain herself.
Tt has been thought by many who have
studied modern history profoundly that
the success of the nations thus deriving
their descent from Great Britain might,
through many ages, reflect back upon that
kingdom the proper glories of its own great
career.
The Government and people ol Great
Britain may mistake their commercial in
terests, but they cannot become either un
natural or indifferent to the impulse of an
undying ambition to be distinguished as
the leaders of the nations in the ways of
civilization and humanity.

Foktiiess Monroe, Dec. 5, via Balti
more, G.?A flag of truce arrived from
Norfolk to day, bringing several Charles
ton passengers, but no news of any kind
can be gleaned from them, except what is
contained in the Norfolk Dag Hook of to
day. It contains the message of Gov.
Letcher to the Rebel Legislature of Vir
ginia. One of themain points in it is the
regret that Fortress Monroe is not in the
possession of the Southern Confederacy.
The rebel Congress, at its session on the
3d inst., passed a resolution of thanks to
Gen. Sterling Price, for his active services
in Missouri during the campaign.
Gov. Letcher uiges a forward movement

fered with this dreadful disease. The
nrvuter part of this time I was unable to
work, and spent at least fifty dollars far
different medicines, but found no perma

friend:* insisted upon my trying Hairhave s
