such a withdrawal from uxe of the people'! cir

which waa quite latnly produced from the aama

al TreaHurv ahould ho few and simple, and
wbllo iti beat condition would be reached,
I believe, by lta entire diauoriuoctlon with pri

ly lubtraulnd from the chanuela of trada, there
aeoma to be reaaou for the claim that eoine
legitimate mean ahould ha devised by tha
(tovernment to ruatora in an amergeucy, with
out waate or extravagance, auch money to lta
place among the poopln.
If auoh an amergHiicy ariaei there now eilita
no clear and undoubted executive
iowk;i or rkmmit.
Heretofore the radninptlon of :i par cant bonda,
which were payable at tha option of the Gov
ernment, bat allordod a moans for the dlaburae
ineut of the exceaa of our revenue! ; but those
bouda have all been retired, and there aro no

have tha right to Inaiat upon, Tba contribution
to tha aiukUig fund wnicb furulahas tha ocoa
eion for expeudituro iu tha iiuruhaae of liouda
baa been already made for the current year, ao
that there la no outlet lu that direction.
In the praaaut atate of lagialation the only
preteme of any axlating executive power to
restore at tbia time any part of our aurplui to
tba people by ita eipenditure, conaiata in the
euppoelUoo that tbe becrotary of tbe Treaaury
may enter tbe market and purohaae the bond
of tha Government not yat due at a rata of pre
mium to be agreed upon,
Tha only provision of law from which auoh ft
power eoald ba derived Is fouud iu au approprU
atloa. bill passed a number of yean ago; and It
la aub)ect to the suspicion tbat It waa Intended
aa temporary, and limited iu Ita application, In
stead of conferring a continuing discretion and
.authority. Ho condition might to exist which
would Justify tbe gi nut ol oer to a single
official, upon bla Judgment of ita neceaalty, to
withhold from or raleaaa to the buaiueav
. of tba people, iu an unuaual manner,
money held in tha Treaaury, aud thus
affect, at his will, tba financial situation of the
.country; and if it Is deemed wiae to lodge in
tbe Hecratary of tbe Treaaury the authority In
tbe preeent Juncture to purchase bouda, it
ibould ha plainly vested, and provided, aa far
aa possible, with aucb obecks and llmiUtlona
aa will define tbia official a right aud discretion
and at tba easne time relieve him from undue
. responsibility.
In ooaelderlnf tha question of
i rOttCBASIMO BONDS
aa a meejia of restoring to circulation tha sur
plus money accumulating in the Treaaury, it
should beoorno in mind that pramiuma must,
of eourae, ba paid upon such purohaae, that
there may ba a large part of tbssa bonda held
aa Investments which cannot ba purchased at
any prise, and that combinations among hold
ers who are willing to sell may unreasonably

aneal It has bean suggested that the) present bonded
dM might ba refunded at a leas rwteof interest,
and tha dMfferenoe between the old and new
eenrtty paid In cash, thus finding uia for tha
surplus In the Treaaury. Tha success of this
plea, tt la apparent, muet depend upon tbe voll
tloxvof tha holders of the pre sent bonds ; and It
la not nttrely certain that tha Inducement

enhancement of it price to the farmer by

thus represent the increase! price of the
wool from twenty-live sheep, and . that
from the wool of filty abeep, and at
present values thla additiuu would amount to
about oue-thlrd of ita pl ica. If, upon it! aala,
tha farmer receives thla or a lee tariff profit,
tha wool leaves bis hauda charged with pre
cisely that sum, which, iu all lta changei, will
adhere to it until it n-acbea the consumer.
When manufactured into cloth and other goods
aud material for use, its coat ii not only increas

speaking of the iocaaued cost to the) apn-

from a duty laid upon knporatd articles of the
same deecasption, tlie fact Is not overlooked that
competition among aur domestic produoers
sometimes has the effect ofgVeoplng the price of
their protiucta below the highest limit allowed
by auch duty. Uut it is uowinoua inai sniacoiu

Schemes.

and If, with auoh reduced price, its manufao

that one thing ba In en discovered which
should be carefully scrutinized in an effort to
reduce taxation. .....
Tbe aocas.ity of combination to maintain tha
price of anv commodity to the tariff point fur
nuhea proof that soiuo ouo is willing to accept
lower pricea for auch commodity, and that such
pricea are remunerative, and lower prices pro
duced by competition prove tbe sums thing.
Ibus, where either of there conditions exist a
case would seem to bo presented for an easy re
duction of taxation.
The considerations which have been present

enforce an earnent recommendation thut the

and, at the same time, to empliaHlzo a sugges

Nor cuu tha presentation made of Such con
siderations be, with any degree of falraoss, re
garded aa evidences of unfriendliness toward
our manufacturing Interests, or of any leak of
appreciation of their value and importance.
These Interests count tuto a leading and most

financial pnuio and collapae, to which the pres

AN A1IUBKD AND 1HH1TATKD l'KOPLK,
heedless of thole who have resisted timely and
reasonuble relief, may insist upon a radical and
sweepiug rectification of their wrongs,
Tbe dillkiulty atteudlug a wlae ana fair re
vision of our tar ill laws Is not underestimated.
It will require on the part of our Congress great
labor and care, aud especially broad and na
tional contemplation of the subject, aud a patri
otic disregard of such local and selfish claims
as are unreasonable and reckless oi ciis weiiare
of tbe eutlre couutry.
Under our present law a more than four thou
sand articles are subject to duty. Many of
these do not In any way compete with our own
manufactures, aud many aro hardly worth at
tention as subjects of revenue. A considerahla
reduction can be made lu the aggregate by add
ing them to the free list. The taxation of lux
uries presents no feature of hardship, but the
ueoeasarlos of life used and oonsumed by all
the people, the duty upon which adds to the
cost of living in every home, should be greatly
cheapened,
Tbe radical reduction of the duties impoisd
on raw material used in manufactures, or its
free Importation, 1 of course an important far.
tor lu any effort to reduce the price of these
neceaaaiios: it would not only relieve them
from the increased coat caused by tbe tariff on i
auch material, hut the manufactured prodoet, ,
bo ug thua cbeaiHiued, that part of the tariff (
uow laid upou aucb produota as a compeusa-!
tion to our manufactuiera for tbe presnut price
of raw material could be accordingly
modified. Huvh reduction, or free Importa
tion, would aerve beside to largely re
duce the revenue. It is uot apparent how
aucb a change can have any Injurious effect
upon our mauufaoturera. On the contrary, It
wuuld appear to give them a better chance In
foreign markets with the manufacturers of oth
er countries who cheapen their wares by free
material. Thus our people might have the op
iwrtunltv of extending their tales beyond the
limits of boms consumption saving them from
tbe depression, Interrupt Ion In business, and
loss caused by a glutted doineetio market, and
affording their employes mora certain and
steady labor, with lu resulting quiet and sou

The failure of the Congross heretofore tu pro
vide agaiuit the dangers winch It was quite ev
ident the rery nature oi the difficulty must
neceaiarlly produce, enised a condition of
financial diatroaa and apprehension since your
last adjournment which taxed to the utmost
all the authority and etped. elite within execu
tive anntrol, and these appear now to be ex
hausted. If disaster results from tbe contin
ued inaction of (.'ongieaa, the responsibility
must rest where it belongs.
'1 hough the aituation thus fsr oonsidsred Is
fraugM with danger wliioh ibould be fully re
alised, and though it preaents features of
wrong to tba people as well as peril to ths coun
try, It is but a result growing out of
a perfectly palpable and apparent oaasa, eon
atantly produolug the same alarming oirsum
atanoss a congested National Treasury and a
depleted monetary condition in the business of
the country. It need hardly be stated that,
while the present aituation demands a remedy,
we can only be saved from a like predicenieut
in the future by the removal of ths eauss.
SI BKMB or TAXATION.
Our scheme of taxation, by means of which
this ussdleaa surplus is taken from tbe people
and put Into the publlo treasury consists of a
tariff or duty levied upon importations from
abroad, and internal-revenue taxes levied upon
the consumption of tobacco and spirituous and
malt liquor a. It must be conceded tbat none of
the things subjected to Internal-revenue taxa
tion are, strictly speaking, necessaries; there
apiears to be no Just complaint of this taxation
by the consumers of these articles, and there
seems to be nothing so well able to bear the
burden without hardship to any portion of the
people.
Mnt our ere sent tariff laws tha vleiout, In
equitable aud illegal source of unnecessary tax
ation ought to be at once revised and amend
ed. Theae laws, as their primary and plain
effect, raise the price to consumers of all articles
Imported and autiject to duty by precisely tha
sum paid for such tjhU'is. Thus the amount
of tha duty tusaauruS tbs tar paid by
those srha purchase for naa these imported
articles. If any of these things, how
ever, are raised or manufactured in
our own country, aud tbe duties now levisd up
on foreign grains sWid fjuroducte are oallsd pro
tection to wese DUiue masuiactures, Because
they render itpossfwlt for thoae of our people
who are marrfacturars to mATa tbess taxed ar
ticles and sill thJtn foTaTpruM equal to tbat
demanded (or tue imported goods tbat have
paid customs duty. Ho Tt liappena that
while comparatively a few use tbe imported
articlss, mulioua of out pantile, who never use
and never saw tiny of tlit Imported products,
purchase and use thna of he earns kind
made la thla country, and pay there
for nearly or quite the same enhaneed
price which tha duty adds to the imparted
articles. Those who buy leports pay tbe duty
charged thereou into the pubHo Treasury, but
ths great majority of our citlmus, who buy do
mestic artloteeof tueaanie glass, pay a sum at
leaat approximately equal to this) duty to the
horns manufacturer. Thai reference to ths op
eration of our tariff laws la not made by wxy of
restriction, S at in order that we maybe con
stantly reminded of the manner in which they
impose a burden npou those who cousums do
mestic products as well as those who consume
imported articles, and tUus create a tax upon
all our people.
It is uot proposod to entirely relieve the coun
try of this taxation. It must be extensively con
tinued as the source if the Government's in
oouie ; and iu a readjustment of our tariff the in
terests of American labor engaged in manufact
ure should bo carefully considered, as wallas
the preservation of our manufactures. It may
be called protection, or by any other name, but
relief from the hardships snd dangers of our
present tarifl laws ahould be devised with espe
cial precaution against imperiling the existence
of our manufacturing interests. Hut this
existence should not mean a eondition
which, without regard to the public
wulfare or a national exigency must al
ways insure the realization of immense
profits instead of moderately profitable returns.
As the volume ami diversities of our national
activities increase new recruits are added to
those who desiro a continuation of the advan
tages which thry conceive the present system
of tariif taxation directly alfords them. ho
stubbornly have all efforts to reform the pros
ent condition boon resisted by those of our
fellow-citizens thus eugngod that they can
can hardly complain of the suspicion, enter
tained to a certain extent, mai more exists an
OUOANIZKD COMBINATION
along the lino to maintain their advantage.
We are In the midst of centennial celebrations
aud with becoming pride ws rejoice in Ameri
can skill and ingenuity, In American energy
and enterprise, and in the wonderful natural
advantage! and resources developed by a cen
tury's national growth. Yet when an attempt
is made to Justify a scheme which permits a
tax to be laid upou every consumer In the land
for the benefit of out manufacturers, quite be
yond a reasomiblu demand for governmental
regard. It suits the purpose! of advocacy to call
our manufactures infant industries, still need
ing the highest and greatest degree of favor and
fostering care that van be wruug from Kcdoral
legislation.
THR WOKKINOMAN'S POSITION.
Tt Is also said tbat tho increase In the price of
domestic manufactures resulting from the
prestut tariff is necessary in order that higher
wages may be paid to our workingmsn em
ployed in manufactories than are paid for what
is called the pauper labor of Kurope. All will
acknowledge the force of an argument which
involves the welfare and liberal compen
sation of our laboring people, Our labor
Is honorable iu tbe eyes of every Amer
ican citireu, and aa it lies at the foun
dation of our development and progress,
it is entitled, without affectation or hy
pocrisy, to tbe utmost regard. The standard
of our laborers' life ahould not be measured
by that of auy other country less favorsd, and
they are entitled to their full share of all our
advantages.
by the last oensus it ii made to appear that of
the 17,3U3,0W of our population engaged in all
klndi of industries, 7,bIO,4'J3 are employed in
agriculture, 4,014, in professional and per
sonal sorvloe ('2,044,87a oi whom are domestic,
servants and laborers), while 1,810,856 are em
ployed in trade and transportation, and 8,837,
11 j are classed as employed lu manufacturing
and mining.
For present purposes, however, ths last num
ber given should be considerably reduced.
Without attempting to enumerate all, it will be
oonoeded that there should be deduoted from
those which It includes 373,143 carpenters and
Joiners, iiHS.tea milliuers, dressmakers and
seamsussaea, 17J,7'Jn blacksmiths, 133,750
tailors and tellorosees. VJ3.4T3 masons, 78,241
butchers, 41,309 bakers, 82,084 plasterers,
and 4,881 engaged In manufacturing agri
cultural Implements, amountlug in tbe ag
gregate to 1,314,083, leaving i.SAObV persons
employed In such mauufaoturing industries
as are claimed to be benefited by a high
tariff. To those tba appeal Is made to save
their employment aud maintain their wages by
resisting a change. There sbould be no dis
position to auswer such suggestions by the al
legation tbat ther are in a minority among
tbose who labor, and thereby sbould forego an
advantage. In tbe interest of low prices for tha
majority; their compensation, as it may be
affected by the operation of tariff law, should
at all thna ba acrupuloaslr kept in view;
and yet with slight refraction they will not over
look the fact that they are consumers with tne
rest; and tbey, too, have their wants and those
of their families to supply from thefr earning,
and that the prioe of the necessaries of life, aa
well as thttamonnt of their wages, will regulate
tba measure of tbelr welfare and comfort.
But tbe red notion of taiation demanded
ahould be so treasured as not to necessitate oi
Justify either tba loss of emplovmeat by the
workingman nor the lesssniug of bit wages ;
and the profits still remaining to tha
xnaamt eoturer after a oeceiiaay readjustment,
boald furnish no eieues for tba seertnee of the
Interests of bis employee either In tbelr oppor
tunity to work or In tbe dlntlnutlo oi their
aompensatioo. Nor can the weaker Ut tstann
f eslu res tail to underatand that, wbllo at high
tariff Is claimed to be necessary to allow the

results In a very laraw Increase in tha price

or. promised lta correction ; and neither (at
eltixsai nor as partisans are pur eonnUymen In
a mood to ooudonc the deliberate violation of
these pledges. , ,
Our progress toward a wise conclusion will
not be Improved by dwelling upon the theories of
preteotion and free trade. This savors too much
of bandying epithet. It ia a condition wbiob
confronts us, not a theory. Belief from this con
dition msy in vulva a slight reduction of the ad
vantages which ws award oar home prod actions ;
but the entire withdrawal of lueh advantages
should not ba eouteniplated. Tbe question of
free trspto Is absolutely Irrelavaat; and the
pertietasxtelaiin mads in certain quarters, that
all efforts to relieve the people from unjust and
unnsosasary taxation are schemes of so-oallsd
frse traders, is mischievous and far removed
from any consideration lor tha nubile good.
Tbe simple and plain duty which we owe tha
people is to redaee taxation to 0 necessary
sinenses of an economical administration of
tbs Government, and to restore to the businssa
of the country the ssoney which we bold In the
Treaaury tbroagh tbe perversion of govern
mental powers. These thiags can and should
be done with safsty to all oar industries, with
out danger to the opportunity far remunerative
labaw which oar workmen nssd. and with ben
efitto them and all our people, by cheapening
tbelr means of ssbiliteacs aud increasing the
measure of tbelr souiforts.

COMMENTS OS THE MESSAGE.
What Leading Journals Think of the
President' Address.
New York Times: Mr. Cleveland tuts done
an act of statesmanship in tha best sense.
Rerognizlng a great duty, he has performed
it with courage, with finances, and at the
right time. And he has performed It so tbat
every boneet man must see that it is an hon
est act. Judged by an ordinary standard of
political expediency the President's act is in
expedient. He has forced upon bis party an
issue aa to which tbe party is divided, and so
divided tbat unless tbe minority yield, it can
defeat the will of the majority. It places
Mr. Cleveland far above any of tbe leaders
to whom the Republican party has of late
lent a bearing, and above most of tbe leaders
of bis own party.
New York Sun: It is uot a commonplace
document, for it U simple, Intelligible, and
coherent. Mr. Cleveland has never before in
a public paper taken sides squarely upon this
tbe tariff question. Lie bus done so now in
a manner tbat leaves room for io misunder
standing. It is a bold tiling to do, and tbe
President deserves credit for tbe plainuess of
his speech. No one can accuse him of hedg
ing, or haggling, or juggling with words. Do
far does be go on the familiar lines of the free
trade speeches in Congress or elsewhere, that
we find him betrayed here and there, no
doubt unconsciously, into an exhibition of
slight irritation against American manufac
turers as a cla-ss, almost as though they were
conspirators and public enemies.
New York World: Tho admirable mes
sage of the President has given to the Demo
cratic party what it has long lacked an
issue and a leader. The issue is tax reform;
the leader is the President It can hardly be
that the President bos not at this juncture
influence enough to secure the union of tbe
Democrats in the Houj upon a measure of
revenue reduction and tariff reform.
Chicago Inter Ocean: The President has
issued a free-trade pamphlet in which no
argument is educod that has not been used
by all the Cobden Club organs till it has be
come stale and threadbare.
Chicago Tribune: The message is able and
statesmanlike; luminious in style; prespicu
ous in statement; clear in its reasoning; and
irrofutable in its conclusions. It is moderate
protection doctrine such as has been exempli
fied more than once in the public utterances
of botli the great political purties.
Chicago Times: The President's message to
the Fiftieth Congress is a new departure,
original and unique. It is the beginning of
tbe new and better method of inviting the
attention of Congress briefly to some sugges
tions on a single topic of leading importance
on which, in the judgment of the adminis
tration, legislative co-operation in a certain
directionjis necessary, or of high importance.
In electing this course, there is much ground
for the opinion that tbe timely and excellent
suggestions from the White House will not
be passed over with the customary legisla
tive disregard of suggestions from the consti
tutional bead of the Republic.
Chicago News: There is uo partisanship,
no free trade, no appeal to class prejudice,
no special hobby, in the President's message.
It is plain patriotic common sense from open
to close. lie has done well in confining it to
the one subject of tarifl reform. His action
must focus public attention upon the neces
sity of a systematic reduction of the tariff
without prejudice and without favor.
