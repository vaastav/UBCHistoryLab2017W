At Hie Mercy of Hie Itnllwny .
ThcIlKi : recently mentioned the fact
that the business men of Helena nnd
llutto City , Montana , were using the
old freight wagons wheiover practica
ble , claiming thill in this way they
could have goods sent from adjacent
towif nnd camps much cheaper than
the railroad company would do the
same work.
ThoimiH J. Price , of St Paul , was
recently interviewed by a St. Louis
paper , and his account of the nuages of
the railroads UIMJD the people of the
northwest furnishes ample food for re-
Ili'Ctlon. Tlio condition of allair ? in
Dakota is .equally an frightful as in
Montana. Mr. Price , after petsonal
observation , nays the following :
The farmers n.f Dakota uro , us usual , in n
very bad position as regards their crop.
Whutlicr the season Is pootV or bad inuUcs
ILttlu dlIeroncto ( thotn , us the rnllroml coin-
piinlcs huvo so arranged mattcis that they
reap whatever profit in to bo derived , leaving
the fanners withnbnio llvliife' . The condi
tion of affairs ut the present time Is a fair
sample of the manner In which the fanners
are bled. Fully-10,000,000 bushels of wheat
nro now harvested , and much of It sacked ,
but It cannot reach a market as there arc no
curs to haul it , ami no prospect of any being
obtainable. This refers to the land * along
the Manitoba load , with xvliich I am PUIHOII-
atly acquainted , but I understand tlio sumo
condition of affiilrH prevails elsowheif. The
farmers nru generally In debt and can not af
ford to carry their'crops until tninsiwrtr.tion
can bo obtained , and no ono wants to buy the
( . rain with this uncertainty hanging over
them. Here the railroad company , or rather
its directors , step In ami offer u low price for
thu wheat. The farmer Is obliged to sell ,
and when once the transfer of all thu wheat
In u certain district is made , It Is astonishing
how easy it becomes to obtain enough freight
cunt to handle the grain. Hill and H.van , the
rft. Paul mllllomihcs , mnlto hundreds of
thousands of dollars every year , undolhcis
nuiko smaller but still very considerable sums.
The plan is to pay the farmers just enough to
pi event them from abandoning their lands ,
and so hold out hopes that In future no lack
of transportation will occur. The plan works
admirably for the railroads , but is highly
disastrous to the farmers ,
The situation in Nebraska ib homo
different than.in Dakoka , yet there arc
many of our people who remember when
just such u programme was enacted
hero , yea'r after year. And it is not
much better yot. The remedy lies only
with tlio people. It takes years to ac
complish the desired end. Yet by elect
ing honest men legislators laws can and
finally will bo enacted , effectually check

and the highwaymen who manipulate
them.
Opinion.
If the London press , in commenting
upon the president's message , would give
fair and intelligent consideration , there
would bo no reason to apprehend any ill
effects from the discussion. The imws-
papers of London , however , have chosen
to talk of it as a free trade manifesto ,
nnd this.misroprcscnlation of the char
acter of the message is not only mislead
ing to the English public , about which
wo need feel no concern , but it is being
employed in this country to influence
popular opinion , and will undoubtedly
have great effect upon all that portion
of the population which is prompt to
array itself against anything tluvt re
ceives English approval.
It is very easy to understand the mo
tive of the London press in taking n
false view of the message. There is a
large and growing element in England
that is greatly dissatislied with the
pronont lineal system and is demanding
a change. If this discontented portion
of the English people c.an bo made to
believe that the president recommends
a policy for the United States that
would bo a material approach to that of
England it would do much to silence the
demand for a change in the English
policy , and all the feuding
papers of London desire that
thuru shall bo no change. It is
hardly possible , however , that the de
ception they arc practicing can bo
maintained , and so soon as it shall bo
exposed there is very likely to come n
reaction that will give the fair traders
a very vigorous boom.
The politicians in this country who
nro making use of this English opinion
are also likely to find .in duo time that
they are giving it a much greater value
than it really possesses. It will have
perhaps a lusting effect with some , bul
the great majority of the reading people
of this country form their own opinions
and such Will not ho persuaded that the
policy recommended by the president
means ireo trade or any material
approach to it. The message
explicitly declares that the tariff dntie-
cannot now bo wholly'dSsponsod with
but must bo maintained for many year :
in order to provide a part of the revenue
nuo of the government. Ho also insist :
that in any readjustment of the tarlt
reference must bo hud to the duty o
preserving the industries of the country
and , protecting labor in the enjoymon
of ample work and liberal remuneration
There is no possibility of any man of intelligence
telligenco ai\d candormisundorstnndin !
or misconstruing those sentiments
which clearly imply the continuance o
a reasonable protection. With a righ
understanding of the motive for th
misroprosuntntions of the London news
papers no ono ought to bo inlluonccd b
the expressions of English opinion 01
the president's message , or the mani
fest absurdity of associating Mr. Cleveland
land , as a champion of free trade in th
United States , with Cobden , the grcn
npoatlo of that policy in England.
A TronliloBomo I/oopholc.
The effort that will be made by th
representatives of the Pacillo coast i
congress to scc.uro additional legisljitio
for restricting Chincso immigration i
confronted by the troublesome fact tin
however drastic a measure might I
adopted it would be likely not to prov
ontircly effective in keeping out thool
jcetinnablo people so long as their con
ing to this continent receives the 01
connigomunt. of the Canadian govcri
mont. It is stated that Blnce the estnl
Hclimcnt of the Canadian line of stean
10 erri across the Pni'ifie , ChliiChO nip :
10n
n chants in Victoria have boon busily ci
it gaged in preparations to import Cliini

rs in\c.-ttd ) in tlio business. U ib alt
10 Mild that since the completion ' of tli
Canadian Pacific rullroud fully .fot
thousand Chinamen have found their
way from Victoria to the United States.
It Is understood that at the next sesrfton
of the Canadian parliament an effort-
will ho mndo to repeal the $50 tax now
levied on Chinamen entering the Ca
nadian domain , in the interest of the
Canadian Pacific railroad company ,
deferring to this phase of the situation ,
the San Fronolsron C/ironMfsays / :
Its fcrnvo featuie arises from the seeming
Inability of our government to cope wltli the
evil. The whole stretch of country fiom
Vancouver to Monti cal is available for the
Illicit transit of Chinamen Into the United
State's ; It Is Impossible to guard so long u
line. And when United States ofllcluls do
catch Chinamen In the act of smuggling
themselves Into this country , what are the.v
going to do about ill When thlsquchtloa
vvns put to the. government nt Washington In
tcfwenro to some Clilnntnen who hud sur
reptitiously crept Into Washington Tei rllory ,
nnd whom the Canadian authorities refused
to take back without the payment of f.10 head
money , the sapient reply came : "I'utthem
In Jail. " Nobody In the Interior department
was nwaio that such a doom would suit the
Chinese. It Is suggested that we tisk Canada
to adopt our exclusion act. We can ask , but
why should they comply ! The Dominion
parliament is not concerned about excluding
Chlncso ; It knows they will not stay In
Canada ; but It is very gravely concerned
about building up a Canadian Pacific line of
strainers and n greuit'Canadian seaport ut
Port Moody to rival San Francisco. Sir John
Mucdonnld would tell Mr. 1 Jayai d that Canada
will take care of her own Inteicsts , and will
leave the United States to take care of theirs.
The dilllculty presented by this feature
is obviously important and serious , and
it is not cniy to HOO how it may bo-
avoided.

The Shooting of Ferry.
The strong feeling of dislike and dis
trust entertained by the radical republi
cans of France towards Jules Ferry
found n not unusual expression in the
attempt to assassinate him. Whether
it shall be bhown that the act of Auber-
tin , was , as he claims , in pursuance of a
conspiracy , or was merely the concep
tion of a rash zealot , the incentive- must
btill be traced to the bitter hostility of
Iho radicals toward Ferry , whom they
fully believe to bo insincere in his pro
fessions of republicanism and inoro a
friend to Germany than to Franco.
Thcro is very likely no justice in this
view. Ferry prefers peace to war , nnd
his influence linn been-exerted to avoid
hostilities between Franco and Germany.
Ho has undoubtedly been willing to
muko some concessions in the interest of
peace , a thing extremely distasteful to
nourly all Frenchmen , and especially so
to tho"radicals. . His course in the
Tonquin matter was regarded as humil
iating to Franco , and it cost him a great
loss of popularity. But whether just or
otherwise the view of Furry held by the
radicals is doap-.seated , and the event of
Saturday shows that the threat of civil
war in case of the election of Ferry to
the presidency was not meaningless.
Jules Ferry is a very able man , and
undoubtedly patriotic and conscientious.
The assumption that his relations with
Bismarck gives the man of blood and
iron an undue influence over him is
doubtless without warrant. But being
largely hold , it has very greatly impaired
the usefulness of Ferry as a statesman ,
and it is not probable that ho will ever
reach any ollleial dignity outside of the
chamber of which he is a member. It
is thought that the attempt to n si -
sinalo him will diminish his unpopu
larity and undoubtedly there will bo
many to sympathize with him who have
boon his opponents. But the clement
that distrusts him is not likely to find
any reason for giving him its confidence
in the fact that the assassin did not ac
complish what ho intended. Ferry will
get well , and when ho resumes political
activity the hostility to him will bo
renewed with , perhaps , incronbod bit
terness. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Words Not KflVctive.
The Chicago JYcif.s continues to road
the riot act to "coal robbers'1 and "land
robbers" and "gas thieves. " Yet it is
to bo regretted that all these polished
gentlemen who prey upon the publio
continue to exNt and do business at the
old stand with their same charming can
dor. There was n time when it would
have been considered a trille out of
place to notice a cpmpany of men en
gaging in business that was deemed re
spectable , and refer to them as robbers ,
and thieves and conscienceless plunder
ers , but in these days when centralized
capital constitutes the motive power
that moves the world , no other terms
would properly describe them.
And the question i.s , shall custom
continue to tolerate daylight robbery ,
and must the poor always pay thoit
earnings to the rich and not got value
received ? What good result can come
from naming these men thieves unless
the theft bo proven and the violators ol
law made to pay the penalty of theii
crimes ? If it is not a crime for capita ]
to pool and prey upon wage-workers ant
the poorer classes , lot a law bo cnuctet
to make it such. If it is now a crime ,
then let the powers act and bring l <
justice the blood-sucking leeches wlu
grow more impudent as they grov
richer. Something must bo donooi
what might prove an undesirable re
action is inevitable.
PlllLADKLl'in.V has enjoyed a littli
boom on the leprosy scnro starting i
few weeks ago. Now ; comes the St
P.iul ( Jlolc and says that there seems ti
bo good reasons for believing "a form o
leprosy actually exists in certain portions
tions of the state. Though not the terrible
riblo discaso which has decimated th
population of the Hawaiian islands , i
is nevertheless allied to it , and shouli
receive as careful attention from th
authorities. The discaso exists exclusively
ivoly among those Scandinavian immi
grants who , at homo , were accustomo *
to an unvarying fish diet , and has notyc
boon obsarved , among those of that rac
who wore born in this country. " Th
GMic calls upon the state board c
hualth to investigate the matter fullj
and reminds that body , which seems t
bo but little interested , of the fact that i
ether countries where leprosy exists 1
.is regarded as distinctly contagion !
and the moment the disease appears th
unfortunate victim is at once isolate
from tlio rest of thu community.

ninur wants to look at. At the Ophir
'bloisom , " or croppings , just below their
auk , the lowest depression is attained.
The water works system of Virginia
mil of the mining companies runs north
mil south , with lateral lines , on the
.u'inoipul streets , and is crosscutted on
ill the cross streets. If the reader will
onsult a map of Virginia and follow
ho following description lie will see ex
ictly how she is a-wiggling : The
ivater-tanks are all situated on the firm
ivest country. From the Savage to the
Ophir the water-pipes all pull apart on
every street until they get to C'strect ,
and from there east they jam together.
This pulling and jamming is considera
le. Where the water mains leaves
auk ono and crosses the break noted
ibovu the pipe pulled apart nnd the
east side sunk two foot and traveled cast
icarly three foot. At the corner of
Flowery and D streets , where Chief
onnSson recently put a fire main , the
pipe was found jammed live inches. Tlio
Ophir company have had to put in
.Jeeves . above Carson street several
ime.s. On Sutton avenue , Union street
nnd Taylor street Chief Pcnnison has
lad to do the same- thing , and
, ho milling , company , which re
cently put a Iti-inch main down
Taylor street , 1ms already had to repair
three times on account of the frisky
inturo of the street. By the Choi'ar
Aorks the west country must bo much
'urther west than t is north'of it , for
.heir . water tank and their entire system ,
ib well as that of the city , is moving
east , so regularly and oven that there is
" > ut little ditliculty to keep things in re-
inir around there.
The pipes thn't run north and south
from the Savage to the Ophir on B nnd
C streets net just about alike. At the
junction of Flowery on C and a corresponding
spending point on B street the water
pipes jam righ together. Fourhnndred
loot north they pull apartf and at points
400 and 300 feet still north they again
pull apart and slccvos have to ro put in
to lengthen them. Opposite the Bank
of Nevada the pipes pull apart , and from
tcoro to Sutton avenue the movement
east is steady and slight. At Sutton
avenue they jam and crowd so much
that pieces have to be cut out to shorten
them. Once they jammed right into a
valve and a new valve had to bo put in.
From Sutton avenue north everything
lides smoothly with the country.
While things nro restless enough on
the surface there is genuine activity un
derneath. This is , in fact , so great that
it is almost inconceivable. Of course ,
all this disturbance is duo to the im
mense quantities of rock which have
boon taken out of the mines since the
first hoisting plant was set upon the
lode. It is impossible to account for
every movement on the surface by the
ebcavations that have been made un
derneath , but the greatest depressions
and longest slides visible on top arc in
variably opposite or in the neighbor
hood of paying mines mines in which
the largest slopes have boon made.
All tlio old maps which have been
made of the Consolidated Virginia and
California mines during bonanza days ,
to cite particular instances , which are
now only about ton years old , nro to-day
absolutely worthless , so far as they may
bo consulted for the purpose of making
connections or re-opening old drifts and
btopes. As the Irish man would say ,
"They tire not thoro. " They have
moved. How much have they moved ?
The map shows that from a certain wall
to another , giving two points that are
almost imi > Obsiblo to mistake , the dis
tance is 854 feet. Since the lire has
been extinguished the points have been
found ; the walls are there a plain and
as eyes over saw thorn , but they are
only 150 fect _ apart now. Ono can
scarcely believe it. A stopo which is
down on the map as having sixteen sots
of square timbers 1112 feet was found.
The timbers for the sixteen sets are all
there , but so jammed that the sixteon-
inch timbers are only four inches wide ,
and an entire stopo is not more than ten
fcot wide. And so it i& all through the
workings.
The reader could form a fair idea of
the immense pressure that is brought
upon stopo timbers only by seeing them ,
When a stopo is bulkheaded , timbers
are put in about as thick as they can
got , and everything titled neatly. !
On the 1,000 foot level of Consolidated
Virginia there is a drift , ono side ol
which Is under almost continual repair
for a distance of about 100 feet , and the
ether side does not move at all. The
moving side is planked. The rock is
taken away and the planks are sot six
teen inches from the timbers and wooden
pegs nro sot between the planks and the
timbers. The moving rocks press
against the planks and crunch the peg *
until they reach the timbers , when the
same work has to bo all done over.
Apparently solid walls that look as
smooth us a slate , and which snom im
movably llrm will sometimes commence
to crumble and crack. When tlio mine
was full of oxide gas the subtle fluid
came right out of wells of this kind , and
that is what mndo it so dangerous and
diltlcult to handle.
This agitation will doubtless go on a :
long as mining work is donuon the lode
but it will olways bo of the same .char
acter that it is now. There will bo nn
sudden downfall so long as the mining
is not done too near the surface , and sc
long as proper timbering Is done. So ,
timid people need lose no sloop on ac
count of our immense mining opera
tions.

which of itself is n curliKity in this eli
mate. A well-worn pathway is the onlv
passage that lends up to door of this
rude dwelling , where lives ono of the
most amusing and et'centrio characters
to bo found in Indiana.
The name of the person Is John Moon ,
and his age. to judge from appearance ,
Is about eighty your * . Ho Isot . strong ,
and in summer of ton makes "long jour
neys on foot , attending all the fairs ,
public sales and shows of all kinds for
many miles around , whore ho Is well
known by almost every man , woman
and child. Ho goes barefooted both
winter and miminor , and is fond of
boasting that his fcot never know a
covering. Of his early life but little Is
known , except what ho chooses to tell.
Ho came to this country manv years
ago , when the country was no'w , nnd
entered 100 acres of the richest farming
land , which ho yet retains. Ho was
never married , and is not known to
have any living relative. Up to a few
years ago ho worked industriously on
his farm , and must by his labors have
accumulated a small fortune , but
ho always asserts , when asked concern
ing his wealth , that ho is npoor'mnn.
It is .supposed that ho has his treas
ure buried , from the fact that the busi
ness men of this place are often called
upon to exchange gold coin for silver
and paper currency by him. Evil dis
posed persons have upon more than ono
occasion made nocturnal visits to his
farm and hunted for the money , but
with no success. This extremely pecu
liar individual claims that his boyhood
days and tlira of his early manhood
wore spent in the Rooky mountains , and
ho has considerable evidence in the way
of hunting relics to support his declara
tions. His lonely hut. which is onlv
occupied by himself , is a veritable curi
osity shop , and possesses great interest
for any person , who is so lucky as to
gain admittance thereto. "
A reporter recently happened in the
vicinity of Moon's premises , and de
termined to pay a visit to the abode ot
this strange character , both for the pur
pose of satisfying his own curiosity and
securing , if possible , a morsel for the
readers of his paper. The old hermit ,
or miser , was found in a small inelosuro
adjoining the hut feeding his poultry ,
numbering several hundred , wJiio'h
Hocked around him without fear. His
income from their sale alone must
uiuMint to considerable. Your corre
spondent , by playing the role of a hun
ter and complimenting the flourishing
condition of his poultry , finally suc
ceeded in gaining the confidence of the
old man , and upon expressing a desire
to view the interior of the mean hovel ,
was unceremoniously invited inside.
The rooms were almost entirely de
void of furniture. An old cupboardwith
a few pieces of old erockorjwind cooking
utciibils ; a broken-backed chair , and an
iron pot or two completed the list. Tlio
style and number of the decorations ,
however , wore astonishing. Over the
door , which was the single entrance to
the cabin , was the old flint-rock rifle ,
which , the old man said , was his con
stant companion in all of his hunting
exploits in the "Rockies. " No carpet
covers the rough-hewn board floor , but
instead there are thrown carelessly
around numerous bear , panther , buf
falo , and many other wild animals'
hides. With each specimen nn interest
ing tale of daring bravery is con
nected , which Moon , when in
the right mood , is very fond
of relating. Ho entertained your corre
spondent with a few of these'wonderons
stories , whjch , if space would permit ,
would make good rcaiding for those ad
venturously inclined. Ranged upon
bholvcs around on all sides of both
rooms wore the mementoes of his early
travels. A few were from Mexico ; where
ho claims to have spent a number of
yours ; but the greater part of the curi
osities were from what was then the
"wild and unsettled west. " They em-
bi'aco collections of Indian darts'toma ,
hawks , stone axes and various other
articles used in Indian warfare , besides
curious stones and nuggets of jrohl and
silver , kept us a rombrance of the Cali-
fordia gold excitement of ' ! ! ) , of which
Moon was an active participant.
It is surmised by borne that ho pros
pered there and has his fortune hidden
in some becuro ] ) lace upon his farm.
One of the curirsities that interested
your correspondent most was several
pairs of elks' horns of tremendous bi/.o ,
which ornamented tlio walls of the
rooms. Previous to the departure of his
attentive I ut somewhat inquisitive vis
itor the queer individual extended a
polite invitation to partake of a frugal
repast which ho had hastily prepared.
The bill of faro consisted of iuivd bis
cuits and fried squirm ; ! , well Seasoned ,
cooked over an old-fashionod firo-placo.
The meal was relished. .It was served
standing , there being noseats to occupy ,
in the simplest manner. Upon leaving
your correspondent was heartily en
joined to "call again. " Moon , like most
ether persons of his character , is con
sidered by the people of this section as
authority upon weather prophecy.
A Story of Stolen Diamonds.
Chicago Herald : Last winter social
circles wore startled by the publication
of a paragraph which announced that a
well-known Washington society ladj
had boon robbed of a set of diamonds
valued at $ L'0XK ( ) , the thief being naid to
be a well-known man in social circles.
In a few days names began to bo men
tioned in the ca o , the lady being iden
tified as Mrs. Scott-Townsoml , while the
culprit was wild to bo John Schuyloi
Crosby , a well-known man about town.
Mrs. Towns-end is the daughter ol
W. L , Scott , of Erie , Pa. , tlio mil
lionaire congressman , while Mr. Croibj
is of a prominent Now York fam
ily , and served for > mo time
in the war on General Sheridan's
staff. Ho was appointed by President
Arthur as governor of Montana terri
tory , and subsequently was made Ural
assistant postmaster general. Both ho
and Mrs. Town&ond denied the story
but it found many bollovors. It has
now boon discovered that the diamonds'
were stolen bv a servant In the employ
of Mrs. Townscnd , who , after the thuft ,
escaped to California and recently
opened nogotiiitionsthroughan attorney
for their return , his price being $ o,000
and a promise that ho should not bo
prosecuted. It is now understood that
Governor Crosby will prosecute the people

Atlanta Constitution : Not far 'from
the city of Montgomery , in the state of
Alabama , on ono of the roads running
from that city , lives a jolly landlord by
the name of Ford. In fair weather or
foul , in burs tfmos or boft , Ford would
have his joke whenever possible. Ono
bitter , stormy nightor rather morning ,
about two hours hoforo daybreak , ho
was aroused from his slumbers by loud
shouting and knocks at his door. Ho
turned out. but sorely against his will ,
and demanded what was the matter. It
was dark as tar , and as ho could see no
ono ho cried out :
' Who are you , there ? "
"Three lawyers from Montgomery , "
was the answer. "We are benighted
and want to stay all night. "
"Very sorry 1 can't accommodate you
so far , gentlemen. Do anything to
oblige you , but that's impossible. "
The lawyers , for they were three of
Iho smartest lawyers in the'state , and
'ready to drop with fatigue , held a con
sultation , and then , as they could do no
bolter and wore too tired to go another
stop , they asked :
"Well , " can't you stable our horses , and
give us eliulrs nnd a good tire until
morning ? "
"Oh , yes ; I can do that , gentlemen. "
Our learned and legal friends wore
soon drying their wet clothes by a
bright Uro as they composed themselves
to pass the few remaining hours in their
chairs , do/ing and nodding , and now
and then swearing a word or two of im
patience as they waited till daylight did
appear.
The longest night has a morning , and
at last the sun came along , and then in
due time a g < > od breakfast made its ap
pearance ; but to thomirpribo of the law
yers , who thought tlio house was
erowdad with guests , none but them
selves sat down to partake.
"Why , Ford , I thought your house
wasbo full you couldn't give UH a bud
last night ? " said ono of the travelers.
"I didn't say so , " Ford replied.
"You didn't ? What in the name of
thunder , then , did you say ? "
"You asked mo to let you May hero
all night , and I said it would bo impos
sible , for the night was night on to two-
thirds gone when you came. If you only
wanted beds why on carlli didn't you

The lawyers hud to give it up. Thrco

The anxiety to know whether this
