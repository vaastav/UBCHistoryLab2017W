the importance of autlioiizing the secretary of

ket value ot the silver dollar being uniformly
and largely less than tho marnet value f the
gold dollar, it i obviously impracticable to
maintain them at pnr .vith eaca othor if both
aro coined without limit. If the cheaper coin
is torced into circulation, it will, if coiued
without limit, soon oecoute the sole stand aid
of value, and thus defeat the desired object,
which is a currency of both gold and silver

aud which aro carried on under the superin

great advantage been establhhea as the con
ditioner admission lo almost eveiy official
place in tho subordinate administration of
that country and of British India. The com
pletion of the report, owi.-g to the extent of
the labor involved in its preparation, and the
omission of Congress to make any provision
either fort ho compensation or the expenses of
the commission, has been postponed until tho
present time. Jt is herewith'transmitted to
Congress. While the reform measures of an
other government are of no authority to us,
they aro entitleel to influence to the extent
to which their intrinsic
wisdom and their adaptation
to our constitutions and social life may com
mend them to our consideration. Tho views I
have heretofore expressed concerning the de
fects and abuses in our civil administration,
remain unchanged except in so far as an en
larged experience has deepened my sense of
the duty, both of officers and of the people
themselves, to co-operate for their removal.
The grave evils and perils of a partisan spoils
system of appointment to office, and of the of
fice tenure, are now generally recognized. In
the resolutions of %p great parties, in reports
of departments, in the debates and proceed
ings of Congress, the messages of executives,
the gravity the evils has been admitted. To
command the necessary support every measure
of reform must he based on common right and
justice, and roiiot be compatible with the
healthy existenco of great parties which are
inevitable and essential in a fiee Btate.
When people have approved a policy at a
national election, confidence in the officers they
have selected and the advisers who, in accord
ance with our political institutions should be
consulted as to the policies which it is their
duty to carry into effect, is unquestionable. It
is eminently proper they should explain to the
people, as well as illustrate its spirit in the
performance of their official duties. It hardly
need be pointed out that veiy different con
siderations apply to the greater number of
those who fill the subordinate places in the
civil service. Their responsibility is to their
superiors in official position. It "is their duty
to obey the legal instructions of those upon
whom that authority is devolved, and tbeir
public tervice consists in the discharge
of their functions irrespective of par
tisan politics. Their duties aro the
same whatever party is in power, and what
ever peilicy prevails. As a consecpience, it
follows that their terms of office should not
depend upon the prevalence of any policy or
the supremacy of any party, but should be de
termined by their capacity to servo the people
most usefully, quite irrespective of partisan
interests. The same considerations that should
govern the tenure, should also prevail in the
appointment, discipline and removol of those
subordinate. The antbority of appointment
and removal is not a perquisite which
may be nsed to aid a friend
or reward a partisan, but is
a trust to be exercised in the public inter
est. Tho only just ground of discrimination
is the measure of character and capacity he has
to make that service most useful to the peo
ple, except in cases when upon just and recog
nized principles, it is upon the theory of pen
sions, offices and promotion are bestowed as
rewards for past services. Their bestowal up
on any theory which^disregards personal met it
is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a
breech of that trust subject to which the ap
pointing power is held.
In the light of these principles, it becomes
of great importance to provide just and ade
quate means, especially for every department,
or a large administrative office where rjersona!

is not only to deny the opportunity of ascer
taining facts npon which the most righteous
claims to office depend, but of necessity to
discourage all worthy aspirants by
banding over appointments and removals
to mere influence and favoritism.
If fit is the right of tho worthiest claimant to
gain the appointment, and the interest of the
people to bestow it upon him, it would seem

MORM0NI9M.
The continued deliberate violation, by a large
number of prominent and idfl lential citizens of
the Territory of Utah, of the laws of the United
States^tor the prosecution and punibhmeut of
polygamy, merits the attention ot eveiy de
partment of the government. This Temtoiy
has a population sufficient to entitle it to ad
mission as a State. This important change
will not. however, bo approved by the countiy
while the citizens of Utah, in very considera
ble numbers, uphold a practice which is ccn
demned as a crime by the laws of all civilized
communities thionghnut the world. The law
for the suppression of this offense was enacted
with unanimity bjCongie-is more ihun seventeen
years ago, but has remained until leoemiy a
dead letter iu the Temtoiy of Utah because
of tlio peculiar difficulties attending its en
forcement. The opinion widely pievailtd
auioug citizens of Utah that the law was iu
contradiction of the constitutional guai..utee
of religious trttdom. This objection is now
removed. Tho supreme tvurt oi the
United Btstes has decided the
Uw to be within the legislative
pronation to personally ascertain the
merits of tho candidates. Parly managers of
methods had not then become powerful agen
cies of coercion, hostile to the free nod just
exercise of the appointing power.
A largo and responsible part of tho duty of
restoring tho civil service to the desiredpurity
and efficiency rests on the President, and it has
been my purpose to do what is in my power to
advance such prudent and gradual measures of
retoim as will moat surely bung about the rad
ical change of ejstem essential to make ourati
minisiiative methods satisfactory to a free and
intelligent people. By a proper exercise of au
thority it is in the power of the executive to do
much tv promote such a reform, and it cannot
be too clearly understood that nothing adequate
cau be accomplished without co-operation
ou the part of Congress, and
a consideiate and intelligent sup
port among the people. Reforms which
cba lenge the generally accepted theories of
pirtios, and demand changes iu methods of
departments, are not the work of a day. Their
permanent foundations must be laid in sound
prtrciples and in an experience which demon
strates then- wisdom, and exposes the errors of
their adversaries. Every vvoithy officer desires
to make his official action a gain and honor to
his country, but tho people themselves, far
more than their officers in public station, are
interested in a pure, economical und vigorous
administiation.
i$y laws enacted in 1S53 and 1855, and now
in substance incorporated in the revised stat
utes, the practice of arbitrary appointuieats to
the subordinate grades in the departments was
condemned, and examinations aa to capacity,
to be conducted by departmental boards of ex
aminers, were provided for and msde condi
tions of aiimisvion to the public service. These
statutes aio adeoieion by Congress that exam-
inaUons of some sort as to attainments and
capaeitj, are esseu'ial to the well being of the
public seiviee. ,The impoitant questions since
the enactment of these laws have been as to
tho chaiaeter of these examinations, and
whether ofncial favor and partisan influence, or
common right ami merit, were to control ac-
eebS to the examinations in practice. These
examination have not always been open to
worthy persons generally, who might wish to
be examined. Uih-_n-l favoritism and parti-an
influence, a3 a rule, appear to nave
dtsigiiated those who alone were
permitted to f.o before the examining board,
subjecting even the examiners to a pressure
fiom the irieDda of the candidates very difficult
to rt sist. As a em.sequence thc standard of ad
mission fe'i below that which the public inter
est demanded. mm also almost inevitable
that a nystem which provides for various boards
ot eximuiers with no common supervision or
umltum measure ot procedure should lesult in
coniusion and inadequate* tests of capacity
highly detrimental to the public interests A
further and more radical change was obviously
lequired.
In tho annual message of December, 1&70,
my predecessor declared that "there is no duty
which ho e:n!rirra=8ea the executive aud heads
of departments as that ot appointments, nor i
is there any such aiduons and thankless labors
imposed on Senators and Heprepentatives a
finding places for constituents. The present
system dees not secure the best men and often
does not lit mi-ii for public places. The eleva
tion and purification of the civil service of tne
government will bo haileu with approval bv
rhe whole peopie ot tlrs United States."
Congress accordingly passed the act ap
proved Karch 3, 1.V71, to regulate the civil ser
vice of tho United State- and promote tue ef
.rie'ency thereof, giving the necessary authori
a to the executive to lmiugmate a civil ser
vice reform. Acting nnder the statute, which
was interpreted as intending to secure a system
of just and effectual examinations under uni
form supei vision, a number of eminently com
petent personi were selected for the pur
pose, wtio cniered with zeal npon
the discharge of the duties pre
rcd, with an intelligent appreciation of the
requiretnetits of the seivice and regulations,
and v-ho, in their capacity as a board, have
b^on known its the Civil ser/ice commissioners.
Cougress tor tv.o ears appropriated the money
needed for the compensation and for the
expense of carrying on the woik
of tho commission. It appears from the re
port of tl.e .mruifisiem submi'ted to the Presi
dent in April, 1.S74, that examiLations had
boen held in various sections of the country,
and that an appropr ation of about 55^5,000
would bo required to meet the annual cx
pen-ee, including the salaries involved. The
report was transmitted to Congrebt. by special
me-iag on April lb, 1874, with the following
favoiable comment upon tne laboisof the com
mission:
If siiitain.e.d by Congress, I have
no doubt the rules can, after the experience
gained, be FO immoved and enfoiced as to still
moie materially benefit the public seryice and
relieve the executive, members of Congress and
the heads of departments from influences prej
udteid to gemd administration. The iuloi, as
they have hitherto been enforced, have result
eel beneficial!} as is shown by ths opinious of
tue meuibeiR of the cabinet and their subordi
nates in the departments, and in that opinion I
concur,"
And the annual message of December of
thc Miie jctr similar views aro expressed,
aud an appropriation *.r continuing tho work
of the commission again advifed. The appro
priation was riot made, and na a consequence
tl.e active work of the commissioners was sus
peadtd, leaving the commission itself in ex
istence without the means therefor of causing
qualifications to be tested in any systematic
manner, or ol seeming for the public service
the anvantagCH of competition upon any ex
tensive plan.
I recommended in my annual message of
December, 1-V77, the making of an appropria
tion for the ltsumplion of the work
of the commission. In the meantime,
however, competitive examinations under
many embarrassments, have been conducted
within limited spheres in the executive de
partments in Washington and in a number of
the custom houses and postoffices of the prin
cipal cities of the country, with a view to fur
ther test their effects, and in eveiy instance
have been found to be as sapitary as they are
stated to be under the administration of my
predecessor. 1 think the economy, purity and
efficiency of the public service would be
greatly promoted by their sstemati intro
duction, wherever practicable throughout the
entile civil seivice of the goverimieut, togeth
er with ample provision fe their general
supervision, order tofecure consistency and
nniform justice.
Keports from the secretaiy of the interior,
from the postmaster general, from the post
master in the city of New York, where puch
examinations have been for sometime on trial,
and also from the collector of the port, the na
val officers and the surveyor in that city, and
from the postmasters and collectors in several
of thc other large cities, sh JW that the competi
tive system, where applied, has in various
ways c.mtributcel to improve the pnbbc service.
Thc rrports show that the results have been
salutary in a marked degree,
and that a general application
of similar rules cannot fail to be a decided
benefit to thc seivice. The reports of the gov
ernment officers in the city ot New York es
pecially, bear decided testimony to the tnility
of open competitive examination in their re
spective offices, showing that these examina
tions and the excellent qnalficatioDS of those
submitted to the service through them have
had a marked effect upon the persons previ
oeisly in the service, and particularly npon
those aspiring to promotion. There has been
on the part of the latter au increased
interrat iu the woik and iv desire
to extend acquaintance with it beyond the par
ticular desk occupied, and thus the meirale of
he entire force has been raised. The examina
tion have been attended by many citizens, who
have bad an opportunity to thoroughly investi
gate the scope and character of the tests, and
the method of determining the results, and
those visitors have without exception approved
the methods employed, and several of them
have publicly attested their favorable opinion.
Upon such consideration I deem it my duty
to renew the recommendation contained in my
annual message December, 1877, requesting
Congress to make the necessary appropria
tions for the resumntion of the work of the
civil service commission. Economy will be
piomoted by authorizing a moderate compen
sstic to prrsons in the public service who
may perform extra labor upon or ander the
commission, as the executive may direct. 1
am convinced that if a just and adequate test
of merit is enfoiced for admission to the pub
lic service in making promotions, such abuses
as removals without good cause, and partisan
and official interference with the proper exer
cises of the appointing power, will in a large
measure disappear.
There aie otner administrative abases to
which the attention of (Dongress should be
asked in this connection. Mere partisan ap
pointments and the- constant peril of removal
without cause, very naturally lead to an ab
sorbing and misohevions political activity on
the part of those thus appointed, which nt
onlyinterferes with the due discharge oi official
duty, Dut is incompatible with the freedom of
elections. Not without warrant in the views of
several of my predecessors in the Presidential
office, and direetiy within the law of 1871 al

haps, be nooessary to define with precision the
proper limit of political action on the part of
federal officers, but whilo their right to hidd
and freely express their opinions can not be
questioned, it 18 very plain that they should
neither bo allowed to devote to other subjects
the time needed for tho proper discharge of
their official duties, nor to use the authority of
their office to enforce their own opinions or to
coerce the political action of those who bold
different opinions. Reasons of justice and
public polioy, quite analogous to those which
iorbid the uso of official power for the oppres
sion of the private citizen, impose upon th
government tho dnty of protecting its officers
and agen's from arbitrary exactions.
In whatever aspect considered, the practice
of making levies tor party purposes upon the
salaries of officers, is highly demoralizing to
the public service and discreditable to the
country Though an officer should be as free
as any other citizen from using his own money
in aid ot his opinion or his party, he should
ate, be as free as any other citizen to
refuse to make such gifts. If salaries
are but a fair compensation for time and labor
of the officers it is gross iaj uatice to levy a tax
upon them. I they are made excessive in or
der that tbey may bear a tax, the excess is in
direct robbery ot the public funds.
1 reccommend ttierefoie such a revision and
extension of the present statutes as shall se
cure to those in every grade oE official life or
public employment, the protection with which
a great and enlightened nati should guard I
those who are faithful in its service.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Our relations with foreign counties have con
tinued peaceful. With Gret Britain there are
still unsettled questions growing out of the
laws of the maritime pioviuoes, and the action
of provincial authorities, deemed to be iu dero
gation of rights ueouied by treaty to American
fishermen, the United States minister in Lon
don has been instructed to present a demand
for 10,580,602 in view of damages received by
American citizens at Fortune Bay on the 6th
day of January, 1878. The subject has been
taken into consideration by the British
government and an early reply is an
ticipated. Upon the completion of
the nece&sary preliminary examinations the sub
ject of our participation in the provincial fish
eries as regulated by treaty will at once be
brought to the attention of the British gov
ernment with a view to an early and permanent
settlement of the whole quebtion, which was
only temporarily adjusted by the treaty of
Washington.
Efforts have been made to obtain the remov
al of restrictions found injurious to the ex
portation of cattle to the United Kingdom.
Some correspondence has also occurred" with
regard to the rescue and saving of life and
property npon the lakes, which has resulted in
important modifications of the previous regu
lation of the dominion governmeut on this sub
ject in tho interest of humanity and commerce.
In accordance with the joint resolution of
the last session of Congress, commissioners
were appointed to represent the United States
at the two international exhibitions in Aus
tralia, one of which is now in progress at 8yd
ney and the other to be held next year in Mel
bourne, a desire has been expressed by mer
chants aud manufacturers intercstedjin the im
portant and growing t.-ade with Australia, that
an increased provision should be made by Con
gress for the repr&scetation of our Industrie? at
the Melbourne exhibition of next year, aud the
subject in respectfully submitted to your
favorable consideration.
The assent of the government has been given
to the landing on the coast of Hassuchvsetts of
a new and independent trans-Atlantic cable
between France, by way of the French island
St. Pierre, and this country, subject to any fu
tuie legislation of Congress on the subject.
The conditions imposed before allowing con
nection with our shores to be established, are
such as secure its competition with any exist
ing or future lines of marine cable,
anel preclude amalgamation therewith, and
provide for an entiie eciunlify of rights to our
government and people with those of Frar.ee iu
the use of the cable, and prevent any exclusive
possession of the privilege as accorded by
France to the disadvantage of aDy future cable
communication between France and the United
States which may be projected and accom
plished by our citizens.
An important reduction of the present
rates on cable communication with
Europe, which is felt to be too burdensome to
the interests of our commerce, must necessarily
flow from the establishment of this competing
line. The attention of Congress was drawn to
the propriety of some general regulation of
Congiess of the whole subject of transmarine
cables by my predecessor, in his message of
December 7, 1875, and I respectfully submit to
jour consideration tho importance of Con
gressional action in this matter.
The questions of grave importance with
Spain growing out of the ^eidents of the
Cuban insurrection, have been, for the most
pait. happily and honorably settled. It may
reasonably be anticipated that the commission
now sitting in Washington for the decision of
private ca?es in this connection, will soon be
able to bring its labors to a conclusion.
The lonj/ standing question of East Florida
claim6 has lately been renewed as a subject of
correspondence and may woBsibly require Con
giessional action for its final disposition.
A treaty with the Netherlands with respect
to consular righta aud privileges Bimilar to
those with ojther powers, has been signed and
ratified, and the ratifications were exchanged
on the 31st of July last. Negotiations for ex
tradition treaties with the Netherlands and with
Denmark are now pending. Some questions
with Switzerland iu regard to pauper and con
vict emigrants have arisen, but it is not doubt
ed that they will be arranged upon a just and
satisfactory basis. A question has also occur
red with respect to an asserted claim
by Swiss municipal authorities to exercise
tntilage over persons property of Swiss cit
izens, naturalized in this country. It is possi-*
ble this may require adjustment by treaty with
the German empire. Frequent questions arise
in connection with the subject of naturaliza
tion and expatriation but the imperial govern
ment has constantly manifested a desire to
strictly maintain and comply with all treaty
stipulations in regard to them.
In consequence of tbe omission of Congress
to provide for a diplomatic representative at
Athens, the legation to Greece has been with
drawn. There is now no channel of diplomatic
communication between the two countries and
the expediency of providing for one in some
form is submitted to Congress. The relations
with Austria, liusaia, Italy, Portugal, Turkey,
and Belgium continue amicable and marked by
no incident of especial importance, A change
of the personal bead of the government of
Egypt has taken place. No change, however,
has occurred in the relations between Egypt
and the United States. The action of the
Egyptian government in presenting to the city
of New York one of the ancient obelisks which
possess such historic interest, is highly appre
ciated as a generous mark of international re
gard. If prosperity should attend the enter
prise of its transportation across the Atlantic
its erection in a conspicuous position in
the chief commercial city of the nation, will
be soon accomplished.
JAPAN AS CHINA.
The treaty made between Japan and tbe
United States in regard to the revision of
former commercial treaties it is now believed
will be followed by similar action on the part
of other treaty powers. The attention of Con
gress ia again invited to the subject of the
indemnity funds received some years since
from Japan and Ghina, which, with the ac
cumulated interest, now amount to consider
able sums. If any part of the funds is
justlydue to American citizens they should re
ceive it promptly and whatever may have been
received by this government in excess of strictly
just demands, should in some form be returned
to the nations to whom it equitably belongs.
The government of China has signified its
willingness to consider the question of the emi
gration of its subjects to tho United States
with diplomatic fairness and to co-operate in
such measures as may tend to prevent inju
rious consequences to tbe United States. The
negotiations are still proceeding and will be
pressed with diligence.
A qnestion having arisen between China and
Japan about the Lew Chew islands, the United
States government has taken measures to in
form these powers ot its readiness to extend
its good offices for the maintenance of peace if
they shall mutually deem it desirable and find
it practicable to avail themselves of the
proffer.
BELATIONS WITH MEXICO.
It is a gratification to be able to announce
that through the judicious and energetic action
of the military commanders of the two nations
on each side of the Bio Grande, nnder the in
structions of their respective governments,
raids and depredations bave greatly decreased,
ana ixx the loealitfen where, formerly mos( de
structive have now almost wholly ceased. In
view of this resnlt, I entertain a confident ex
pectation that the continuance of this preva
lence of quiet on the border will soon become
so assured as to justify a modification of the
present orders to onr military commanders aa
to crossing the border, without encouraging
such disturbances as would endanger the peace
of the two countries.
The third installment of tbe award against
Mexico, nnder the claims commission of July
4, 1868, was dnly paid, and has been put In the
course of distribution in pursuance of the act
of Congress providing for the same. The sat
isfactory situation between the two countries
leads me to anticipate an expansion of onr
trade with mexico and an increased contribu-
1 *vI- i rjs"-
tion of capital and industry by our people to
the development of the great resources of that
country. I earnestly commend to the wisdom
of Congress the provision of suitable legisla
tion looking to this result.
UKTBBLIO OF COLUMBIA.
Diplomatic intero mrso with Columbia is
again fully restored by the arrival of a minister
from that country to the United States. This
is especially fortunate in view of the fact that
tbe question of an inter-oceanic canal has re
cently assumed anew and important aspect and
is now nnder discussion with the Central Amer
ican countries, through whose territory the
canal, by the Nicaragua route, would have to
pass. It is trusted that enlightened states
manship on their part will see that the early
prosecution of such a work will largely enuie
to the benefit not only of their own citizens
and thoBe of the United S'ates, but of the com
merce of the civilized world. It is not doubted
that should the work bo undertaken nnder the
pioteclive auspices of the United States, and
npon satisfactory concessions for the right of
way and security by the Central American
government, tha capital for its "completion
would be readily furnibhed from this country
and Europe, which might, such guarantees
failing, prove inaccessible.
SOUTH AMERICA.
Diplomatic -relations with Chili have also
.been strengthened by the reception of a minis
ter from that country. Tho war between Peru,
Bolivia and Chili still continues. The United
States have not deemed it proper to interpose
in the matter tatther than to convey to all the
governments concerned the evidence that the
friendly offices of the government of theUnited
States for the restoration of peace upon aa hon
orable basis will be extended in case the bellig
erents shall exhibit a readiness to accept them.
Cordial relations continue with Brazil and
jthe Argentiae republic, and trade with those
countries is improving. A provision for regu
lar and more frequent mail communication in
our own ships between the ports of this country
and tho nations of South America seems to mo
to deserve the attention of Gongress as an essen
tial precursor of an enlargement of our corn
mere* with them, and an cxtensitm of onr car
rying trade.
A recent revolution in Venezuela has been
followed by the establishment of a provisional
government. This government has not jet
been formally recogtiized, and it is deemeel de
sirable to await the proposed action of the
people, which is expected to give it the sanc
tien of constitutional forms.
A naval vessel has been sent to the Samoan
inlands to make surveys and take possession of
the privileges ceded to the United States by
Samoa in the harbor of Pago Pago. A coaling
station is to be established there which will be
convenient and useful to tho United States
vessels.
BOUMAKIA AND 8EBVIA.
The subject of opening diplomatic relations
with Ron mania and Servia, now become inde
pendent sovereignties, is at present under
consideration and is a subject of diplomatic
correspondence.
FoBEIGN TBADE.
There is a gratifying increase of trade with
nearly all European and American countries,
and it is believed that by judicious action in re
gard to its development it can and will be still
more enhanced, and that American products
and manufactuics will find new and expanding
markets. The reports of diplomatic and con
sular officers upon this subject under the sys
tem now adopted have resulted in obtaining
much valuable information which has been
and will continuo to be laid before Congress
and the public from time to time.
ALASKA.
The third article of the treaty with Russia of
March 30, 1S07, by which Alaska was ceded to
the United States, provides that the inhabi
taut6 of the ceded territory, with the exception
of uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted
to the enjoyment of all rights of citizens of
the Unittd States, and shall be maintained aud
protected in the free enjoy a ent of their lib
erty, prosperity and religion. The uncivilized
tribes are subject to such laws and regulations
as the United States may from time to time
adopt. In regard to the aboriginal tribes of
that country, both the obligations of the treaty
and the necessities of the people demand that
some organized form o% government over the
territory of Alaska be adopted. There appears
to be no law for the arrest of persons charged
with common law offenses, such as assault,
robbery and murder, and no magistrate author
ized to issue or execute process in such cases.
Serious difficulties^ bavo already arisen
from offenses of this charae'er, not only
among the original inhabitants but
among citizen* of the United Stiites and other
countries who have engaged in mining, fishing
and other business operations within the terri
tory. A bill authorizing the appointment of
justices of the peace and constables, and the
arrest and detection of persons charged with
criminal offenses and providing for an apeal to
United States courts for the district of Oregon
i suitable cases will at the proper time be sub
mitted to Congress.
THE TBEABXJBY.
The attention of Congress is called to the
annual report of the secretary of the treasury
on the condition of the public finances.
The ordinary revenues from all
sources for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, lS^ were $273,827,184 46
The ordinary expenditures for
the same period were 266,017,883 53
Leaving a surplus revenue for
-the year of 6,879,300 93
The receiptb for the present fiscal year ending
June 30, 18S0, actual and estimated, are as fol
lows:
Actual receipts for first quaiter
commencing July, 1879 $ 79,843,663 61
Estimated receipts for remain
ing three quarters of the year 208,156,334 39
Total receipts for the current
fiscal year, actual and esti
mated 288,000,000 00
The expenditures for the Raise peri-xi will
be, actual and estimated, as follows'.
For the quarter commencing
July 1, 1879, actual expendi
tures S 91,683,385 10
For the remaining three quar
ters of the year the expendi
tures are estimated at 172,316,614 90
Making tbe total expenditures. 264,000,000 00
Leaving an estimated surplus
of revenue for the year end
ing June 30, 1883. of. 24,000,000 00
The total receipts during the
next fiscal ending June 30,
1831, estimated according to
existing laws, will be 288,000,000 00
And tbe estimated ordinary
expenditures for the same
period will be 278,097,364 39
Leaving a surplus of $9,902,635.61 for that
year.
The large amount expended for the arrears
of pensions during the last and the present
fiscal year, amounting to $21,747,249.60, has
prevented tbe appropriation of the full amount
required by law to the sinking fund for the
current year, but these arrears having been
substantially paid, it is believed that the sink
ing fand can hereafter be maintained without
any change of the existing law.
THE WAB DEPABTMENT.
The secretary of warjreports that the warjde
partment estimates for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1881, are $40,380,428.93,' the same
being for a less sum of money than any annual
estimate rendered to Congress from that de
partment during a period of at least twelve
years. He concurs with the general of the
army in recommending such legislation as will
authorize the establishment of the full number
of 25,000 men for the line of the army, exclu
sive of 3,463 men required for detached duties,
and therefore not available tor service in the
field.
He also recommends that Congress be asked
to provide by law for the disposition of a
large Jnumber of abandoned military posts
and reservations which, though very valuable
in themselves, have been rendered useless
for military purposes by the advance of civili
zation and settlement.
He unites with the quartermaster general in
recommending that appropriations be made for
the construction of a cheap and perfectly fire
proof building for tbe safe storage of a vast
amount of money, accounts, vouchers, claims
and other valuable reportB now in tbe auarter
master general's office and exposed to great
risk and to total destruction by fire.
He also recommends, in conformity with the
views of the judge advocate general, some de
sultory legislation in reference to the military
statute of convictions as applied to the crime
of desertion.
In these several recommendations I concur.
The secretary of war further reports that tho"
work for the improvement of tEe south pass of
the Mississippi river, nnder contract with
Mr. James B. Eads, made in pursuance of an
act of Congress, has been prosecuted
during the past year with a greater measure of
success in tbe attainment of the results than
during any previous years. The channel
through the South Pass, which at the begin
ning of operations 'in June, 1875, had a depth
of only seven and one-half feet of water, had,
on the 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth of
twenty-six .feet, having a width of not less than
200 feet and a central depth of thirty feet.
Payments have been made in accordance with
the co .tract, as the work has pro ressed,
amounting in the aggregate to 84,250,000, and
farther payments will become due as provided
JM i_L
(Elnbe.
N*
by the statutes, in event of success in main
taining the ehannel now secured.
The reports of tbe general of tbe army and
bis subordinates present a full detailed ac
count of the military operations for the sup
pression of hostilities, and praises are justly
awarded the officers and troops engaged, for
the promptitude, skill and courage displayed.
The past year has been one of almost un
broken peace and quiet on the Mexican fron
tier, and there is reason to bolievo the efforts
of this government and of Mexico to maintain
order in that region will prove permanently
successful.
The department was enabled during the past
year to find temporary though crowded ac
commodation and safe depository for a portion
of its records in the completed east wing of
the building, designed for the state, war and
navy departments. Tho construction ot the
north wmg of the building, the part of the
structure intended for use of tho war depart
ment, is bejng carried forward with ull po-i
siblb dispatch, and the work should reeeive
from Congress such liberal appropriations as
will secure its speedy completion.
THE NAVY,
The report of the secretary of the navy shows
continued improvement in that branch of the
seivice. During the last fiscal year extensive
repairs have been made on vessels and two new
ships have been completed and made ready for
sea. The total expenditures,ended June 30,1879,
including specific appropriations not esti
mated for by the department, were $i,353,-
671 09. The expenses chargeable to the year,
after dedustiug the amount ot the specific ap
propriation, were $13,313,317.79. But this is
subject to a reduction of $283,725.99, that
amount having been drawn upon warrants, bat
not paid out dmicg the year. The amount of
appropriations applied to the bv fiscal year
was $14,538,646.17. There wa* therefore a bal
ance of 1,479,054.37 remaining unexpended
and to the credit of the department on June 30.
1879.
The estimates for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1881, are.gl4,864,147.93, which exceeds the
appropriations for tbe present fiscal year $30J,-
897.28. The reason for this increase is ex
plained in the secretary's report. The appro
priations uvailable tor the present fiscal year
are 14,502,250.67, which will, injthe opinion of
tbe secretary, answer all the ordinary demands
of the service. The amount drawn from the
treasury Horn July 1st to Nov. 14, 1879, was
$5,770,404.12, of which $1,095,440.33 has been
refunded, leaving as the expenditures for that
period .f4,674,963.79 If the expenditures of
the remaining two-thirds of the year do not
exceed tho proportion for these four months,
thre will remain unexpended at the end of
the year $477,359.30 of current appropriations.
The report of the Btcretary .shows the
gratifying fact that among all the disbursing
officers ot the pay corps ot the navy, there is
not one who is a defaulter to the extent of a
single dollar. I unite with him in recom
mending the removal of the Observatory to a
more healthful location. That institution re
flects credit upon the nation and has obtained
the approbation of scientific men iu ail parts
of the world. Its removal from its present lo
cation would not only bo conducive to the
health of its officers and professors, but would
greatly increase its usefulness.
DiPABTMENT OF JUSTICE.
The appropriation for ndicial expenses whioh
has heretofore beeu made for the department of
justice in gross was subdivided at the last ses
sion of Congress, and no appropriation what
ever was made for the payment of the fees of
marshals and their deputies, either in tho ser
vice of process or for the discharge of other du
ties, and since June 30 these officers have con
tinued the peiWmance of their duties without
compensation from the government, taking,
upon themselves the necessary incidental out
lays, as well as rendering their own services.
In only a few unavoidable instances has the
properexecutionof process of the United States
failed by reason of the absence of the requisite
appropriations. This couise of official conduct
on the part of theso officers, highly creditable
to their fidelity, was advised by the at
torney general, who informed them, how
ever, that they would necessarily have
to rely for their compensation upon the pros
pect of future legislation by Congress*. I
therefore especially i-eeommend that an imme
diate appropriation be made by Congress for
thh pnrptsse.
The act making the principal appropriation
f- the department of juHtice at previous ses
sions has uniformly contained the following
clause: "And for defraying the expenses which
may be incurred in the enforcement of the act
approved Feb. 28, 1870, entitled an act to
amend an act approved May 30, 1870, entitled
an act to enforce the right of citizens in the
United States to vote in tho several States of tho
United States, and for other purposes, or any
acts amendatory thereof or supplementary
thereto."
No appropriation was made for this purpose
for the current year. As no general election for
members of Congress occurred, the omission
was a matter of little practical importance.
Such elections will, however, take ploce during
the ensuing year, and the appropriation for tho
pay of marshals and deputies should be suffi
cient to embiace compensation for the services
they may be required to perform at such elec
tions.
THESOTaEMEOOCBT.
The business of the supreme court is at pres
ent largely in arrears. It cannot be expected
that more cases can be decided than are now
disposei f in the annuai session, or that by
any assiduity the distinguished magistrates
who compose the court can accomplish more
than is now done. In the
courts of many of tho circniti the business
has increased to such an extent
that the delay of justice will call the attention
of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is
believed all is done in each circuit which can
be fairly expected, and the evils arising from
delay are less heavily felt by the United States
than by private suitors, as its causes are ad
vanced by the courts when it is seen that they
involve the discussion of questions of a public
character.
The remedy suggested by the attorney gen
eral is the appointment of additional citcuit
judges and tbe creation of an intermediate
court of errors and appeals, which shall relieve
the supreme court of apart of its jurisdiction,
whilo a larger force is also obtained for the
performance of circuit dutieB. I recommend
this suggestion to the consideration of Con
gress. It would seem to afford a complete
remedy and would involve, if t.en additional
circuit judges are appointed, an expenditure at
the present rate of salaries of not more than
$60,000 a year, whioh would certainly be small
in comparison with the obj.'ots to be attained.
THE POSTOFFICE.
The report of the postmaster general bears
testimony to tho general revival in business
throughout the country. The receipts of
the poBtoffioe department for the fiscal year
ending Jnne 30, 1879, was $80,041,982.86, being
764,465.91 more than in the preceding year,
and $2,387,559.23 more than in 1877. The ex
pendituie1*
of the department were $33,449,-
899.45, of which the sum of $376,461.63 wa3
paid on liabilities incurred in preceeding years.
Tho expenditures during the year were $801,-
209.77 less than in the preceding year. This
reduction is to be attributed mainly to the ope
ration of the law passed on June 17, 1877,
changing the compensation of postmasters
from a commission on the value of stamps sold,
to a commission on tbe stamps cancelled.
The amount drawn from the treasury on ap
propriations, in addition to the revenues of
the department, was $303,454.96, being $2,-
276,197,86 less than in the preceeding year.
The expenditures of the fiscal year ending
Jnne 30,1881, are estimated at $39,920,900,
and the receipts from all sources at $32,210,-
000, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated for
out of the treasury of $7,710,900.
The relations of the department with the
railroad companies have been harmonized,
notwithstanding the general reduction by
Congress of their compensation by the appro
priation for general facilities, and the railway
postofKce lines have been greatly extended, es
pecially in the Southern States.
The interests of the railway mail service
would be greatly promoted and the expendi
tures cou be readily controlled by the classi
fication of the employes of the railway mail
as recommended by tho postmaster general.
The appropriations for services with respect to
which the maximum limit is already fixed by
law to bo made in gross.
The postmaster general recommends an
amendment to the law regulating an increase
of compensation for increased service and in
creased speed on Star routes so as to enable
him to advertise for proposals for such in
creased service and speed.
He also suggests the advantages to accme to
the commerce of tbe country from the enact
ment of a general law authorizing contracts
with American built pteamera carrying the
American flg for transporting the mail be
tween the United States and ports of the West
Indies and South America at a fixed maximum
per mile, the amount to be expended being
equalated by annnal appropriations in like
manner with the amount for the domestic Star
service.
The arrangement* made by the postmaster
general and the secretary of the treasury foi
the collection of duties upon books received in
the mail from foreign countries has
proved so satisfactory in its practical opera
tion that tbe recommendation is now made that
Congress now extend the provisions of the act
of March 3,1879, nnder whioh this arrange
ment was made, so as to apply to all other
V" *5 -^T"*?-"'?''-", vs
dutiable articles received in tbe mails from
foreign countries.
THE INDIANS.
The reports of the secretary of the interior
and of the commissioner of Indian affairs, set
ting forth the present state of our relations
with the Indian tribes and our territory, the
measures taken to advance their civilization
and prosperity, and the progress already
achieved by them, will be found of more than
ordinary interest. The general conduct of
our Innian population has been so satisfactory
that the occurrence of two disturbances which
resulted in bloodshed and destruction of prop
erty, is all the more to be lamented.
The history of the outbreak ou the White
Biver Ute reservation, Western Colorado, has
become so familiar by elaborate report in the
public press, that its remarkable incidents
need not be stated hero in detail. It is ex
pected that tbe settlement of this difficulty'
v. ill lead to such arrangements as will prevent
further hostile coi flicis between the Indians
and the border settlements in Western Col
oiado.
The other disturbances occurred at the Mes
celaro Agency in New Mexico, where Nielaud,
the head of a small band of marauders, alter
committing many atrocities, being vigorously
charged by a military force made his way
across the Mexican border and is no,v on a for
eign soil.
While these occurrences, in which compara
tively small numbers of Indians were engaged,
me most deplorable, a vast majority of our In
dian population have fully justified tbe expec
tation of those who behevo that by humane
and peaceful influences, the Indians
can be led to abandon the habits
of savage life, and to develop
a capacity for useful and civilized occupations.
What tbey have already accomplished is shown
in the pursuit of agricultural and mechanical
work. The remarkable BuccesB which has at
tended the experiment of employing as freight
ers a class of Indians hitherto counted among
the wildest and most intractable, and the gen
eral and urgent desire expressed by them for
the education of their children, may be taken
as sufficient proof that they will be found ca
pable of accomplishing much more if they con
tiute lo be wisely and fairly guided.
Tne Indian policy, sketched in the report of
the secretary of the interior, the object of
which is to meke liberal provisions for the
education of Ineian youths, to nettle the In
dians upon farm lots in i-everaity, and to give
them tide injfea on their farms inalienable
for a certain number of years, and when their
wants are thus provided, to dispose of by sale
of lands on their reservations, not occuvied
and used by them, al fund to be formed out
of the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians,
which will gradually relieve the government of
tbe expenses now provided for by annual
appropriations, must commend itself as just
and beneficial to the Indians and is calculated
to remove those obstructions which tho exist
ence ot large reservations presents to the set
tlement and development of the country.
I therefore earnestly recommend the en-ctment
of a law enabling the government lo give Indi
ana a title in fee, inalienable for twenty-five
years, to tho farm lands assigned to them by
allotment. I also lepeat tbe recommendation
in my first annual message that a law be passed
admitting Indians who can give
satisfactory proofs by their own
labor oi supporting their families for
a number of years, and who are willing to de
tach themselves from their tribal relations, to'
the benefit of the homestead act, and to grant
them patents containing the same provision of
inalienability for a certain period.
Tho experiment of sending a number of In
dian children of both sexes to the Hampton
normal and agricultural institute, in Virginia,
to receive an elemementary English education
and practical instruction in farming and other
industries, haB led to results so promibing that
it was thought expedient to turn over the cav
alry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to
the interior department tor the establishment
of an Indian school on a larger
scale. This school has now 158
pupils, selected from various tribes
and in full operation. Arrangements are ab
made for the education of a number of Indian
boys and guIs belonging totribeaort tbe Pacific
slope a similar manner at Feres Grove in
Oregon. These institutions will commend
themselves to the liberality of Congress t-ud to
the philanthropic munificence of the American
people.
Last spring information was received of the
organization of an extensive movement in the
Western States, the object of which was the
occupation by unauthorized persons of certain
lands in the Indian country ceded by the Chero
kees to the government for the purpose of set
tlement by other Indian tribes. On the
29th of April I issued a proclamation warning
all peiEons againBt participation in such an at
tempt and by tbe co-operation of a military
force the invasion was promptly checked. It
is my purpose to protect the rights of the In
dian inhabitants of that Territory to the full
extent of the executive, but it would be un
wise to ignore the fact that a Territory so
large, and with a population so sparce, and so
great a wealth unnsed resources, will be
found more exposed to the repetition of
snch attempt* as happened this
year, when the surrounding States are more
densely settled, and the westward movement
of our population look still more eagerly for
fresh lands to occupy. Under such circum
stances the difficulty of maintaining tho In
dian terrilory in its present Btate will greatly
increase, and thf Indian tribes inhabiting it
would do well to prepare for such a contin
gency. I therefore fully approve of tho advice
given to them by the secretary of the interior
on a recent occasion oto divide among them
selves in severalty as large a quantity of tbeir
lands as they can cultivate, to acquire
individual title in fee instead of the present
tribal ownership in common, and consider in
what manner the balance of their lands may
be disposed of by the government for their
benefit. By adopting such a policy they would
more certainly secure themselves in the value
of their possessions and at tbe same time pro
mote progress in civilization and prosperity,
than by endeavoring to perpetuate tbe present
state of things in the Territory.
The question whether a change in the control
of the Indian service should be made was in
the Forty-fifth Congress referred to a joint
committee of both Houses for inquiry and re
port. In my last annual message 1 expressed the
hope that a tlecision of that questior, then in
prospect, would arrest further agitation of
this subject, such asitatlon being apt to pro
duce a disturbing effect npon tho service as
well as tbe Indians themselves. Since then,
the committee having reported, the
questions have been decided in
the negative by a vote in the House
of Representatives. For the reason here Btated
and in view of the faet of further uncertainty
on this point, will be calculated to obstruct
other much needed legislation, to weaken the
discipline of the service and to unsettle salu
tary measures now in progress for the govern
ment and improvement of thc Indians.I respect
fully recommend that the decision arrived at
by Gongress at its last eession be permitted to
stand.
TIMBEB THEFTS.
The efforts made by the department of the
interior to arrest the depredations on the tim
ber lands of the United States have been con
tinned and have met with considerable success.
A large number of cases of trespass have been
prosecuted in the courts of the United States.
Others have been settled, the trespassers offer
ing to make payment to the government for
the value of timber taken by them. The pro
ceeds of prosecution and settlements, being
turned into the treasury, will exceed the
amount of the sums appropriated
by Congress for the purpose. A more im
portant result, however, consists in the fact
that the destruction of our public forests by
depredation, although such cases still occur,
has been greatly reduced in extent, and it is
possible if the present polie.y is vigorously
pursued and sufficient provision to that end
made by Congress,such trespasses, at least those
on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed
except in the Territories where timber for the
daily requirements of the population cannot
nnder the present state of the law be easily ob
tained. I therefore earnestly invite the atten
tion of Congress to the recommendation made
by the secretary of the interior that a law be
enacted enabling the government to sell tim
ber from the public lands without conveying
the fee, where snch lands are
principally valuable for the timber thereon,
such sales to be 6o regulated as to conform to
domestic wants and business requirements,
while at the same time guarding against a
sweeping rednotion of the forests. Tho enact
ment of such a law seems to become a more
pressing necessity every day.
THE AGIUCUI/HraAL BUBEAU. h"
My recommendations in former messages are
renewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of
the department of agriculture. Agriculture is
the leading interest and the permanent indus
try of onr people. It is to the abundance of
agricultural productions, as compared with
our home consumption, and the largely in
creased and highly profitable market abroad
which we have enjoyed in recent
years, that we are mainly indebted
for oar present prosperity as a people. We
must look to its continued maintenance for
substantial resource. There is no branch of
industry in which labor directed by scientific
knowledge yields such incroa^ed production in
comparison with unskilled labor, and no branch
of the public service to which the encourage
ment of liberal appropriations can be more

appropriately extended. Th#-ommission to
render snch aid is not a wise economy, but on
the contrary, undoubtedly results in the
losses of immense sums annually, that
might be saved through well-directed
efforts by the government to promote this vi
tal interest. The results already accom
plished with the very limited means heretofore
placed at the command of the department of
agriculture is an earnest of what may be ex
pected with increased appropriations for the
several purposes indicated in the report of the
commissioner. With a view to placing the
department upon a footing which will enable
it to prosecute more effectively
tho objects for which it is
established appropriations are needed
for a more complete laboratory for the estab
lishment of a veterinary division and a division
of forestry and for an increase of force. Tbe
requirements for these and other purposes in
dicated in the report of the commissioner, un
der the head of immediate necer-sities of the de
partment, will not involve any expenditure of
money that the country cannot with propriety
now undertake in tbe interest of agriculture.
EDUCATION.
It te gratifying to learn from the bureau of
education the extent to which educational
privileges throughout the United States bavo
been advanced during tbe year. No more fun
damental responsibility rests in Congress than
that of devising appropriate measures of finan
cial aid to education, fupplemental to local
action, in the States and Territories, and in
the District of Columbia. The wiso fore
thought of the founders of onr
government has not only furnished
tho basic for the support of the common school
systems of the newer States, but laid the foun
dations for the maintenance of their universi
ties, and of colleges of agriculture and me
chanic art. Measures in accordance with this
traditional policy for tho further benefit of all
these interests and the extension of some ad
van tageB to every portion of the country it is
hoped will receive your favorable considera
ble.
THE CAPITOL LIBEAJET.
To preserve and perpetuate the national
literature should be among the foremost cares
of the national legislature. The library
gathered at the capitol still remains unpro
vided with any suitable accommodations for
its rapidly increasing stores. The magnitude
and importance of the collection, increased as
it is by the deposits under the laws of copy
right, by domestic and foreign exchanges, and
by the scientific library of the Smithsonian
institution, call for building accommodations
which shall be at once adequate and fire proof.
Tbe location of such public bnilding3, which
bhould provide for the pressing necessities of
the present and for the vast increase of the
nation's books in the future, is a matter which
addresses ilselfto tbe discretion of Congress. It
is earnestly recommended as a measure which
should unite all suffrages and which Bhould so
longer be delayed.
WASHINGTON SIONUMEXT.
The joint commission, created by the act of
Congress of August 2nd, 1876, for the purpose
of supervising and directing tho completion of
the Washington national monument, of which
commission the President is a member, has
given careful attention to this subject, and al
ready the strengthening of the foundation
ha3 so far progressed as to '.insure
the entire success this part cf
the work. A massive layer of masonry -has
been introduced below the original foundation,
widening the base and increasing the stability
of the structure, rendering it possible to carry
the Fhaft to completion. It is earnestly rec
ommended that Mich farther appropriation be
mane for the continued prosecution of the
work as may be necessary for the completion
of this national monument at an early dav.
DIBTBICTOF COLUMBIA.
In former messages, impressed with the im
portance of the snbject. I have taken occasion
to recommend to Congress the adoption of a
generous policy toward the District of Colum
bia- The rep -rt of the commissioners of the
District, herewith transmitted, contain consid
erations and recommendations, to all of
which I earnestly invite careful attention.
I ask early and favorable consideration
of the views which they express as fo the nrgent
need of legislation for the reclamation of the
marshes of the Potomac and its eastern branch
within the limits of the city, and for the re
pair of the streets of the capital heretofore laid
with wooden blocks, and by delay rendered
almost impassable, and a soorce of imminent
danger to the health of its citizens. The
means at the disposal of the commissioners are
wholly inadequate for the accomplishment of
these important works, and should be supple
mented by timely appropriations from tbe
federal treasury.
The fillieg of the flats'n front of the city
will add to the adjacent lands and parks now
owned by the United States a large and valu
able domain, sufficient, it is thought, to reim
burse its entire cost, and will also, as an in
cidental result, secure the permanent improve
ment of tho riven1
for the purpose of naviga-
tion.
Tae constitution ha3 invested Congress with
supreme and exclusive jurisdiction over the
District of Columbia. Its citizens mast of
necessity look Congress alone for all needful
legislation affecting their interests and RS the
territory of this District is the common proper
ty of people of the United States who,
eq nelly with its resident citizens, are interest
ed in thc prosperity ot their capital, I can not
doubt that you will be amply sustained by tbe
general voice of the country in any measure
you may adopt for this purpose.
I also invite the favorable consideration of
Congress to the wants of the public schools of
this District, as exhibited in the report of the
commissioners. While the numberot the pu
pils is rapidly increasing, no adequate pro
vision exists for a corresponding
increase of school accommodation,
aud the commissioners are without
the means to meet this urgent need. A num
ber of the buildings now used for school pur
poses ate rented, and are in important particu
lars unsuited for the purpose. The cause
of popular education in the District of
Columbia is surely entitled to the
same consideration at the hands
of the national government as in the several
States and Territories, to which munificent
grants of the public lands have been made for
tbe endowment of schools and universities.

[Washington Special.]
Senator Thurmen arrived here this morn
ing in better health than he has been for
some time. He is exceedingly reticent ea to
what the Democratic policy is likely to be
daring the present Congress. When asked
what he thought about tbe length of the
present session, he said he did not sea why
it should be any shorter than the first regu
lar session of Congress is. The business,
he said, waa done at the extra
session, and really Congress has
as much to do as though the
extra session had not been held. He de
clined to express any opinion as to whether
or not there would be any abandonment of
the position assnmed by the Democratic
party at the extra session, and intimated that
a party caucus would be called at an early day
to decide that question. "What course he in
dividually would recommend he declined to
state. When asked if the issue raised by the
Democrats during the extra session af.
fected the resnlt iu Ohio, he declared emph
atically, "No!" "Ohio," said he, "is a Re
publican State whenever they get out a full
vote. Sometimes the Democrats carry it.
Massachusetts," said he, "went Democratic
in 1874, yet no one claims it as a Democra
tic State on that account. The Democrats
In Ohio," said he, "did well this year, and in
ordinary times' with such a vote we would
carry the State." He declined
to express any opinion npon the
Presidential prospects of next year, and
when asked about the Grant boom in his
State, said he Jpew nothing about it except
what he read tbe newspapers. He declined
to express any opinion in relation to the Ohio
Senatorship, and indeed expressed himself
as decidedly averse to talk about the political
action of either party. He declined abso
lutely to express himself in relation to the
prospects in 1880.
