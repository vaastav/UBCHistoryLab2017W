New Arrival of Cloaks.
Another laree lot of cloaks just received
by express last night. The popularity of
these fine-fitting garments and their ex
cellent values makes the selling an easy
matter. Hundreds of dollars worth of
our cloaks are worn by our citizens.
Thev say our prices are cheaper. Being
tiilor-made garments we think it is the
style, fit and finish that does the work.

A gentleman confined in the county

found this a. m. by the jailer bathed in
tears bitter, ealding tears, and greatly
troubled in mind and bemoaning the
lack of a friend. Said the good jailer
(very few good jailers), "I will help
vou ; tell me your trouble." The a-zon

countenance beaming with joy as he said :
"Can I trust you?" "Yes," says the
turnkey. "Well, draw near and let me

TWr'U Teetolar
"Take your pencil and make a calcu
lation for me,"' said one of the patients
in the club room at the Ketley Institute
at Greensboro the other day. "For thirty
years I have averaged a quart of whiskey
a day. Certainly I have destroyed that
much, and probably more, now how
much have I gotten on the outside of?"
The computation was easy. "A little
more than two thousand seven hundred
and thirty dollars," said the man with
the pencil. And yet the man who had
drunk this much of intoxicating liquors,
after a two week's treatment at the
Keelev Institute at Greensboro, was sit
ting there conttntedly, free from the de
sire for whiskey, and requiring only two
weeks more to disenthral him from his
greatest enemy forever. Such evidence
knocks skeptical arguments out on the
first round.

for the cession. Several important agree
ments for the cession of Indian lands ne
gotiated by the commissioner appointed
under the act of March 2, 1889, are
awaiting the action of congress. Per
haps the most important of these is the
cession of the Cherokee strip.
Government of Alaska.
The form of government provided by
congress on May 17, 1884, ior Alassa
was, in its frame ana purpose, tem
porary. The increase of population and
the development or some important
mining and commercial interests make it
imperative that the law snould be re
vised and oetter provision made ior tne
arrest and punishment of criminals.
The Indian Bureau.
The work in the Indian bureau in the
execution of the policy of recent legisla
tion has been largely directed to two
chief purposes: First, the allotment of
lands in severalty to the Indians and the
cession to the United States of the
surplus lands; and secondly to the work
of educating the Indian for his own pro
tection in his closer contact with the
white man and for the intelligent exer
cise of his new citizenship.
Commissioner of Pensions.
The report of the commissioner of pen
sions, to wnica extended nonce is given
by the secretary of the interior in his re
port, will attract much attention. Judged
by the aggregate amount of work done,
the last year has been the greatest in the
history of the office. I believe that the
re-organization of the office is elhcient
and that the woik has been done witn
fidelity. The passage of what is known
as the Disability bill has, as was fore
seen, very largely increased the annual
disbursements to the disabled vettrans
of the civil war. The estimate for this
fiscal year was $144,056,000 and that
amount was appropriated. A deficiency
amounting to $10,508,621 must be pro
vided for at this session. The es
timate for pensions for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1894, is $165, 000,
000. The commissioner of pensions be
lieves that if the present legislation and
methods are maintained and further ad
dition to the pension laws are not made,
the maximum expenditure for pensions
will be reached June 30, 1894, and will
be at the highest premium. I adhere to
the views expressed in previous messages
that the care of the disabled soldiers of
the war of the rebellion is a matter of na
tional concern and duty.
The parade on the 20th of September
last upon the streets of this capitol of
.. t j: .;o and nvp had under
consideration the subject of some
further extensions, but have not as yet
fully determined the lines upon which
extensions can most properly and use
fully be made.
Evil Election Methods.
I have in each of three annual mes
sages, which it has been my duty to sub
mit to congress, called attention to the
evils and dangers connected with our
election methods and practices as they
are related to the choice of
officers of the national government.
I cannot close this message without
again calling attention to these grave
and threatening evils. I had hope that
it was possible to secure a non partisan
enquiry by means of a commission into
ottiu the existence of which is known to
all and that out of this might Jgrow leg
islation from which no thought of par
tisan advantage should be enteTea
and only the higher thought

equality of the elector, without the
guarantee of which the government could
never have been formed and without the
continuance of which it cannot continue
to exist in peace and prosperity. It is
time that mutual charges of unfairness
and fraud between the two great parties
should cease and that the sincerity of
those who D.-ofess a desire for pure and
honest elections should be Drougnt io ine
test of their willingness to free our legis
lation and our election methods from
evervthiner that tends to impair the pub
lie confidence in the result. It
ia now time that we should come to
gether upon the high plane of patriotism
while we devise methods that shall se
cure the right of every man qualified by
law to cast a free ballot and erive to
every such ballot an equal value in cboos
ing our public officers and in directing
the policy of the government.

Union Paeific Ituilwaj-.
In my last annual message I called at
tention to the fact that sonn legislative
action was necessary in order to protect
the interest of the government in its re

I recommended in my last annual mes

deal with this question and I renew that
recommendation and suggest that the
commission be given full power.
Agricultural Department,
The report of the secretary of agricul
ture contains not only a most interesting
statement of the progressive and valuable
work done under the administration of
Secretary Rusk, but many suggestions
for the enlarged usefulness of this im-portaut-depsftiserit.-
AgricaltHTal.pro;
ducts constituted 73.1 per cent,
of our exports for the fiscal
years which closed June 30, 1892. The
total exports being $1,030,278,030 and
the value of the agricultural products
$rJ6, ll .bb, wnicn exceeds oy more
than 150,000,000, the shipment of agri
cultural products in any preuious year.
An interesting and promising work for
the benefit of the American farmers has
been begun through agents of the agri
cultural department in Europe, and con
sists in efforts to introduce the various
products of Indian corn as articles of
human food. The high price of rye of
fered a favorable opportunity for the ex
periment in Germany of combining corn
meal with rye to produce a cheaper
bread, a fair degree of success has been
attained and some mills for grinding corn
for food have been introduced.
The secretary is of the opinion that this
ne tt use of the products of corn has
already stimulated exportation and that
if diligently prosecuted large and impor
tant markets can presently be opened for
this great American product.

There is danger that with the coming of

liberal appropriation should be made at
this session to enable our quarantine and
port omcer8 to exclude the deadly
plague, but the most careful and strin
gent quarantine regulations may not be
sufficient absolutely to exclude the dis
ease. Ihe progress of medical and sani
tary science has been such, however that
if approved precautions are taken at
once to put all of our cities and towns in
tne best sanitary condition and provision
is made for isolating any sporadic causes
and for a thorough disinfection.

use upon freight trains, I do so with the
hope that this congress may take action
upon the subject "
Civil Service Reform.
The civil service commission ask for
an increased appropriation tor needed
clerical assistanse which I think should
be given. I extended the classified ser
vice March 1, 1892, to include physi
cians, superintendents, assistant super
intendents, school teachers and matrons
In Conclusion.
This exhibit of the work of the execu
tive departments is submitted to con
gress and to the public in the hope that
there will be found in it a due sense of
responsibility and an earnest purpose to
maintain the national honors, to pro
mote the happiness and prosperity of all
our people, and this brief exhibit of the
growth and prosperity oi tne country
will give us a level irom wnicn to
note the increase or decrease that new
legislative policies may bring to us.
There is no reason why the national in
fluence, power and prosperity should not
observe the same rates of increase that
have characterized the past thirty years.
We carry the great impulse and in-
f crease of these years into the f uture.There
is no reason why in many lines of pro
duction we should not surpass all other
nations as we have already done in some.
There are no near frontiers to our possi
ble development. Retrogression would
be a crime. Benjamin Harrison,

only question is as to whether it may

What They Think of It.
By Telegraph to State Chronicle.
Cafitol, Washington, Dec. 6. The
message of the president was treated by
the senators and representatives during
its reading in the senate and house with
that inattention wnicn is usually ac
corded similar communications. In the
senate perhaps the comments with ref
erence to the tariff were listened to with
some degree of interest, but beyond this
there appeared to be nothing attrac
tive in the document and most of those
on the floor in both house busied
themselves with other matter. A gentle
man who made close observation durin
the reading says only one member pai
any attention to what the President had
to say. As a consequence of the inatten
tion given the reading of the message a
large number of members found them
selves unqualified to make intelligent
comment, but expressions of opinion
were obtained by United Press reporters
from a large number of those who had
re&d the communication or who had lis
tened to some parts of the reading.
uocRery, of Missouri, one of the demo- 1
cratic leaders in the house said: I sin
cerely hope that the President is correct
n the view that there will be no defi
ciency for the current or coming fiscal
year.
Johnson (rep.) of Indiana: I was im
pressed throughout the reading of the
message with the idea that the President
of the United States was trying to sum
marize the prosperous condition of the
country under republican rule to the end
that it will in future be contrasted with
the results of a democratic administra
tion. I was very much pleased with
that portion which recommended that all
tariff legislation be left to the future
congress.
Bryan, of Nebraska, a democratic
member of the ways and means, said.
I had thought the President might recog
nize the popular demand for tariff reform
and advise his party to heed the demand.
but he prefers to allow the democrats to
do all the work and receive all the
credit.
Tracey (dem.) of New York said he
thought the message a very able docu
ment.
Oates, (dem ) of Alabama, said from
what tne rreBident has to say on the
tann, it is evident that he wants to go

is a document of great value, marking
as it does, a wonderful development of
tne country since tne republican party
commenced to up build the nation. It
is wise, courageous and thoroughly
American.
Pickler (rep), of South Dakota
said it 18 an able message and
shows the country to be in a prosperous
condition, it ia a very nttmg docu
ment for the close of President Harri

Said Mitchell (rep ) of Oregon

ment ana generally well expressed.
Cullom (rep.) of Illinois: I regard it
as an excellent message, giving a com
pact resume of the work of the Dartv and
a faithful picture of the prosperous con
dition in which it will be turned over
i'.t the hands of the enemy.
McPherson (dem.) of New Jersey : I
heard only that portion which concerns
the tariff, and I must say that it seemed to
me to be an entirely full, as well as a
very able presentation of their side of the
question.
Stewart (peo.) of Nevada: I think it
an overdrawn picture of the prosperity
of the country.
Hawley (rep.) of Connecticut: I am
exceedingly well pleased with the vigor
with which he maintains hia position on
mc question oi tne protective tariff
"1VW""U vuem.j saia: ine message
was very long and I was unable to hear
it in full, but I believe the only salient
points made were those regarding the
tariff and force bills. Mr. Harrison's
eulogy on the tariff would have been
more potent before the election than
since. The question of federal supervis
ion of elections is one on which the re
publican and democratic parties have al
ways differed.
O'Ferrell (dem.) of Virginia, said:
The President is still talking on the
same old line, and I think that the people
have already expressed their disagree
ment with his views.
Mr. Patterson (dem.) of New Jersey
I think the President's message is a good
campaign speech, but unfortunately it is
The Public Ledger Burned.
By Telegraph to State Chronicle.
Philadelphia, Pa., Dec. 6. The
Public Ledger building, a massive six
6tory brown stone front structure on the
southwest corner of Sixth and Chestnut,
was damaged by fire to-night to the ex
tent of $200,000, of which $150 000 is
sustained by the Ledger, and $50,000 by
tenants.
The Ledger's insurance aggregates
$240,000 $160,000 on building and
80,000 on contents. The other occu
pants are believed to be fully insured.
The collection of curios in the private
offices of Mr. Geo. W. Child, the Led
ger's owner and publisher, which
are inestimable in value, were saved.
The facilities of every printing office in
the city were offered to Mr. Cbilds, and
after Mr. Wm. M. Smgerly, president ot
the Record publishing company had per
sonally tendered the use of his plant, the
offer was accepted, and to morrow and
till further arrangements shall be made,
the Ledger wilt be issued from the
Record office.

Jay Gould Burled.
By Telegraph to State Chronicle.
New York, Dec. 6. The closing
scene in the remarkable history of Amer
ica's famous financier hai been enacted.
The body of Jay Gould rests beside that
of his wife in the marble mauseoleum in
Woodlawn cemetery. The funeral cor
tege left the Gould mansion at 10:30
this morning. Shortly after 12 o'clock
the hearse passed under the west entrance
to Wocdlawn cemetery and in a few min
utes the carriages were lined up facing
the Gould mansoleum.
The invocation "divine strength for the
afflicted ones" brought the simple cere
monies to an an end. The undertaker's
assistants hermetically sealed the sarco
phagus, and the remains were carried into
the mausoleum. The sarcophagus was
then placed in the crypt.
