' " TI19 third and Inst session of tlio Forty-
' Bret Congress commences at Washington to-
day. It promises to bo very lively nnd
interesting. Apart from the regular lcgls
, latlcn, tlio business of President-making
' i Kill clilefly be attended to ; and as tlio Forty-
' J lecond Congress meets on tlio day the
J Forty-first ends, tl.e intrigues for tlio
Spcakorehlp, which aro usually transacted
In tbo vacation, will also employ a great deal
, of tlmo and labor during the coming three
months.
Some prophets have given out that this
I ' will ho a veiy corrupt session, and that an
I? ' onusual number of Jobs will bo propounded
4r "id carriod through. There Is no ground
1. ! fur any such sntlclpallnn. The present Con-
t' gtesi) Is as honest and able as the avcragQ of
i Its predecessors, and wo sec no reason why
' It should suddenly become depraved,

Amendment to tho Constitution. In any
qvent. ho cannot bo admitted unless Ginrrntie
' shall, by a vote of two thirds of each House,
reuiovo his disabilities.
1 Whether or not tho two Howes will re-

If, In the judgment of two thirds of each

faith, and intends to abide by It during his
j Bcnatorlal term, then, Irrespective of his
acts and utterances during the rebellion and
Iho period of reconstruction, wo prcsumo his

( ' acts and utterances, and especially those of

The Progress of Gcrmnor.
The present year will long bo remember,
cd In history as marking a now era In tlio
annals of humanity, lu tho rlso of Germany
to tho firat place among tho powers of tho
world.
The Docline aud Fall of Franco bids fair
to becomo as enggestivo n themo for tho
historian as won tho Doclino and Fall of
Homo. Though tiino may bo rcqutrod to
comprehend tho extent of tho vicissitudes
which have overtaken a grcnt nation like
Franco, tho palpable fact of the preponder
ance of Germany must bo admitted, and
must commend Itself to tho consclenco and
judgment of mankind, however much the
svmpnthloa of generous hearts may bo ex
tended to tlo misfortunes of Franco. Tho
military triumph of Germany could never
have been gained, unaided by the Intelli
gence and honesty which pervado nil
branches of her public servlco and all claises
of her people. Thoro has boon scarcely a
blunder committed anywhere, slnco the
beginning of tho war. Tho wonderful
prccis'.on and perfection of the military
as well as of tho civil branches of
tho Gurman Government cau only bo ac
counted for upon the ground of Immense
preliminary labors expended In bringing
the standard of Intel) igeueo and integrity to
tho degree of cxcellonco which now chal
lenges the admiration of tho world.
It Is scarcely Just to assume that the vic
tory of tho house of Hoimyxou.Elt.v has
been achieved only in tho interest of mon
archy and military oligarchies. Tho Ger
man people, now conclotn of their power,
aro not likely to crouch forever at tho foot
of the throne, or remain tho vaesals of feudal
barons. The Germans will belio all tho tra
ditions of their liictory and of their reform
atory tendencies If they do not soon make
us j of their opportunity to overthrow the re
mains of monarchy nnd aristocracy among
them.

ture, making a total taiation of about 61 cents
per gallon, of which the special and capacity
tpxes, amounting to H cents per gallon, need not
bo paid until the last day of each month for the
business of the preceding month, The effect of
all thta la illustrated thus I
"A distiller comnencea business on Septem
ber 1, and Is capacitated at 700 bushots of grain
per day. For twcuty-lx days It would amount
to 1,000 bushels, making a tax of 1,420 1 and,
supposing he should draw offend rJoce in bonded
Vfarahiuse during eaitl time (7,000 gallons, the
tax would be 5,700i In all, 17,820. He continues

C10. Now, supposing the distiller has been sell
ing hla winca from day to day (as roost of them
have been doing), he ivould have $U,6t0 of the
Government money, and all they aak him to pay
is I7.S20 for the month of Hcptcmbcr, thereby
furnishing him ovor 17,000 in money to continue
running his dlstltlcfjr for another thirty days,
and so pn whllo h? runs. Tlio reason that high
wjtics are selling jo-day at 83) to Si cents, w'hijo
no distiller can make licm at less than 87 cents
per gallon, is an ' overstocked market,' caused
by Government furnishing the distillers with
money U manufacture them with j and they keep
running along on this money (or rather same of
them on the little of It they hive left and
have not tort), not being alio to close up
and sclllc with the Government, and like MiciW
ssa ' waiting (or something to lurn up.' "
Harvard University has rio reason to com
plain that hor interests are neglected by the
rich and liberal, A few years ago Mr. P. T.
Ham of Boston founded an Hpiscopal Theological
Hcmlnarr in connection with the University at a
cost of a hundred thousand dollars. To this
succeeded a splendid new dormitory, erected by
Mr. Nutuanul TiiATtn, tho rich banker of Bos
ton, at an expense of nearly one hundred thou
sand dollars ; and now it is announced that ilr.
Natua JlArrnaws and Mr, William F.
Wato. both of Boston or lu vicinity, arc each to
erect a hall for tho University which w ill cost as
much as Mr. TnAiia's. Tlio thrso last charities
will havo the cOVct of considerably reducing the
expenses of living to student", and will, it Is
hoped, save the University the necessity of again
raising the rato of tuition fees. When the new
dormitories aro completed, most if not all of tho
undergraduates can bo lodged within the college
crounds, which will doubtless prove more agreea
ble to the young men, and more conducive to the
preservation of discipline.
The farce of Bending Cnban Deputies to
the Cortes In Madrid 1, according to late ad
vices from Havana, to be carried out. Among
the candidates who seek the honor of represent
ing Havana arc Don Juan 1'oit, tho man who
some time since, nhen a member of the Common
Council of Havana, proposed a law under which
all Chinamen should bo branded with their
owner's mark, that they might bo more easily
recognised ; Colou Joan Luis Airo.vso, known
aa the Murqula of Montelo ; Olako, man of all
work to Ut RonAs; t'ondc de CaSjsgo, Manual
tis AnUAS, and Don GoxriLO Jauri. Kvory one
nf these men haa been prominent as a home
guard in Havana during tho war, nnd every one
of them owns slaves, and has spent his money in
volunteer organizations fur the perpetuation of
slavery.
Tho traitor Xatoixok Alt vnoo Is nald to
have left Havana partly because he knew that
Oen. Dc Uooas was about to resign, and that his
life would not be worth an hour's purchase un
der the volunteers, who are dissatisfied with the
results of his treason.
The Uticn, Herald allege that Tun HfN
abusi-a tlic l'rvaiili nt. Will tlio JftralJ have the
goodness to specify anjthiiiu that we have ever
said about the President that was not truer If
we hare ever done lilui any injustice, It shall cer
tainly be corrected; but telling the aluiple truth
is not abuse.

Tho resignation of tho post of Captain
General of the Island of Cuba, oiigtnally ten
dered by Gen. Da Uouas some two months ago,
has at last been accepted. He leaves Havana for
pa!o on tho COth instant, and to Gen. Valua
sum is intrustid the supremo command of tlio
island. Mob law is likely to reign supreme
in Havana under the administration nf this
faxirlte of the toluutcers. These lawless and
inMibordiuate men have now, fur the first time
siuco the deposition liy litem nf Gen. IKus,
completely untrammelled tbiuiacltes trom all
control.
The apparent occasion for the rutiremrnl of
Gin. Da Hons, who said a car ago tl.ut the
revolution was morally siippres.ed, is tho late
ai rival in Havana of (ieu. Cr.o, who since
January laat ban been in command of tho Span
iith forces iu Couiatrucy, iho central district of
Cuba. This officer, who lias been replaced bt
Gen. Zka, convinced Gen. V Itonss of the
utter absurdity of attempting to crush the revo
lution with any force less than fifty thousand
well armed veteran troops. De Itooaa, knowing
how hopeless It was to oxpect any auch
reinforcements from Hpain, insisted on turn
ing over the supreme command to Vamusciia.
This is the story circulated In Havana,
aud repeated hero even by Spanish agents ; and
it 1 plausible enough. Iho real reason, how
ever, for accepting the resignation of l)c Itonss
and conferring unlimited sway upon Valmasepa
that is, upon 'lie volunteers, whom Spotn has
ever regarded . - ,i,.'ta as Inimical to her iutcicsts
as tho Cuban pauii,u-'U very different,
Da- Hoiiah is called hums to help Pbuiuko In
any connict with Priu that may ;rotv out of the
accession of Aosta to the throne. That event
reduces Beiihiko fiom being vlri:uilly the
monarch of Spain to the position of a Fielu Mar
shal merely. Da Hopas U his frieud and Taw's j
enemy j and we ahall bo likely to hear of him as
such within the next few months.
Gen, Bn.umuaAitD was among tho pasucn
gcra by the Vllle de Paris, which left this port
fur Brest on tbo 28th ult. He goes abroad in
compliance with an invllutlon from the present
Trench Government. They havo oCTered him the
post of a General ofDitlsion in tlio Trench army.
He has accepted It, aud uow goes to euter upon
IU duties.
Tho EaBtcrn Department of Cuba, wIiobo
complete pacification Its Hpantah commander,
VAiHAStOA, has celebrated threa times by public
rejoicings, is still inhospitable to Spaniards. J.ate
letters from Santiago say that the panic in that
city is extreme j everybody who owns a slave is
forwarding him or her to Havana fur sale, plan
tations are abaudoucd, aud all Spaniards who can
get away aro quilting tho place, preferring to
eavo what little they can now rather than certain
ly lose all, and perhaps their lives, a few weeks
hence. The rate of exchange on Km ope 21 per
cent., and payable In gold at that proves tho
eagerness with which they seek to place any
propeity they have beyond the reach of the
Cuban forcci

IlARiroan, Dec. 8. Orer in East Hartford, just
across the Connecticut, In a brosd avenue, which In
summer time la beautiful, there nestlea under the
shadoT of tall elms, whose foliage arches two de
lightful drivel on either side of a centre row of
charming tree, a Gothic structure of atone a rare,
eoay Utile edldcepleuslng to the eye In lit outer
lines, and still more attractive within. Thta Is the
Church of fit. John, tl Is but a few yesrs since
the Bplscopsllaas of East Hertford bid sn organized
psrlsh. At first they began tbelr worship la a
tcbool bouse, till fLntll, lib the 'Oarnslde district,
one Ages Eaiton, an ardent churchman, erected at
hti own cost a comfortable chapel', where services
were hMd for several years j then Elm Hall, In East
Hartford street, was built, and' the church people
went there, the little chapel being turned Into a
dwelling-bouse and low, crowning all, Is Bt,

rag lgCTOB
of IhU church, the Iter. J. J, McCook, Ii a young man
who married rich t and It waa mainly through his
lnlrumenUllty that tbe chnrch edlflce was built.
He Is a good man, but a singular one. It la laid of
blm tbat when he waa a student In Trinity College,
then bearing the scar of Now England orlliodoiy
upon blm, ho was allowed, by special request, to
omit many ot tho forms of worship In the college
cbapal, where tho church srayer-beok It ef coure
osed. Especially did he object to bowing bis head
In he service when iho name pi the Holy Ooa was
mentioned. Dul time and habit orerpaiuo his preju
dices, and st last be was ordained to preach tbe
goapel. Called to Bt. John'a parlh, ha went; wst
the menna of having the chuich built, and when the
cousecritlon took place, there waa unuiutl pomp
and circmonr. rcw probably un'ers'ood nt that
time and tho date Is remote bytaiuar ortno
(bat this cousecratlon wai
rai sign or bjtcalisu
In Connecticut, but so It has proved. St. John's,
g'sdnslly growlne and Imerovlnr upon the forms of
tryiee uniformly adopted tn this diocese, has at
laat got to be one of the extrrmsat rllnallstlc
churches In the count' y. Tho processional, the
reeesslonnl, the Intoning, the surplice, tbe banners,
the ernot, Ihe candle. bunting, and all the para
nhernslli. Indeed, which dlatlnguls I tbo Itotnan
Catholic Church, ran here be sren on every flib
bath. Many people from thla city atterd worship
here nut cfcurlo.lty, snd in all religious circles
Ihere h been a lively crltlclm of Bt. John's, The
Key. lr. Ksrer, of New York, went there and
preaehod a " oneharlstla aermnrt" not many montba
sco. for which he waa called to account by liihp
Williams, snd forbidden I mm again preaching In
this dlocr unless he made a satisfactory etplana
Hon el aeetrln-.
Now, all these things have been eiccedlugly ills
tvatefnl to a crc.it majority of the Chnrch people of
Ilwtford. Here Is leeato I Ihe chief Kf l-copal Col

In crceja and morals and c. psclallv taught that
loy-iHy to the church and Its form Is the simplest

pertly, at least, by pretty eyes, aud partly proniDtod
TUC NOTgLTT Or BIII At.MM,
formed a lablt of attending Ht. John', and for
werk they went; but at hut the faeuitr. Mit'iout
making any reference wbatevor tn the Uist Hart
ford church, c.'died mrtlcillr ntlrntlon lo au old
rulo ef the college, that ti e stmttnt would not bo
rennUW to attend worship o il of t ut rtty. Presl
dent Jickioii, I am credibly Informed, ha felt
great anxiety on account ot this rlluillsltc Influence
brenbt so c esely to the doors of the college.
Meintinie a new churHi Hie Cbnreh of tlio Incur
