of liberty and equal rights, entitled them
to tho consideration and sympathy cf Con- ,
gresi. He thought the struggle of that
people lor lndependenc3 and equal rights,
challenged the bights', esteem, and that it
would be unbecoming an American Con

' Tho House weut to the reconsideration

A messase from tho President, transmit
ting the report ot the Secretary of State of
tiie States that have ratified the Fifteenth
Amendment. The report enumerates the
fiwlowing States as those from which olii
ciai BOtica ot Koch ratification had been
ieoi7-d opto Decembei : Missouri, defect
ive ; Kansas, defective; North Carolina,
West Virginia, Massachusetts, Wisconsin,
Maine, Louisiana, Michigan, South Caro
lina. rcuMsylvanlt, Arkansas. Connecti
cut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, New Yorp,
JS'cw Hampshire, Nevada, Vermont and
Virginia.
The Secretary States that in the ratifica
tion by Missouri, tue second section of the
Amendment Is omitted, and In the ratifi
cation by Kansas tbe phraseology of tbe
sr cor.d section is changed. 'Ihe message
and report were rsletrid to Hie Judiciary
Committee.
The Senate bill pessed December 0th, re
moving political disabilities from F. R.
Hawiius, ot North Carolina, Mowbray, of
Tamps, Fia , and O, H. McCall, of Union
Springs, Ala , was text In order.
Brooks said be had hoped the gentleman
from Massachusetts would have redeemed
the promise made to the last Congress, lo
briuM in a general bill removing all ibese
disabilities. He hoped to hear no more of
this peddling amnesty of theOovernmtnt.
but mat a general amnesty law would be
passed, worthy of the charllv and generos
ity of this great Oovernment, and that the
statute bo jk would be no longer incum
bered with these pardons in detail.
Bntler was bappv to inform the gentle
man Irom New iork that the considera
tion of the bill to provide for the removal
of disabilities from ttiose wbo had offend
ed t he country by their rebellion, was now
before the Commtttee, and he doubted not
that as soon as other and more pressing
duties could be attended to la that Com
mittee, such a bill will be repotted, at
least to knew It would be consideretf by
the Committee, This bin was put forward
pending the necessary d May in the con
sideration of such a general bill, and to
meet ihe exigencies of ihe case.
Cox said be had objected the other day
to this bill when the gentleman from Mas
sachusetts introduced it substantially iu
ills own mind. Although he did not press
fiom the same reason glveu by bis col
league (Brooks), it looked like small busi
ness to oe peddling out amnesty of Govern
ment in this sort of w?.v. He believed it
was recognized by ail parties: it had been
recognized always lu ail tree Oovernments
and in all ages, that when civil war was
over, amnesty should be given; anj! now,
after live years, siuce the conclusion of the
late civil war, mis Oovernment had still
their personal amnesties.
He give notice to the gtntleman from
Mississippi that hereafter, whenever a bill
came ou granting amnesties to personal
Individuals, he snould internose bis oh.
jectlou. He did not propose to do it on
this occasion, for the reason that ihe men
named in this bill had been oii'ertained to
necessarily Federal offices; it was neces
taiy they should have their pardon, in
order thai they miht fill their luncltous.
BuMer said he could not agree with the
gentleman from New York in saying this
was a small business. There una mnrn
Joy in Heaven over oue sinner that re
pented man over ninety-nine Just persons
who nte.l no repentance.
Cox remarked that be understood from
that that the sinners pardoned by this bill
belonged to the ltepubliean party. If they
were Democratic sinners they would not
be Included lu this amnesty, but the
Democrats would forgive them freely if
the gentlemen on tbe other side would
forgive them. Generally these amnesties
weie given as the consideration for treach
ery, and lor the purpose of adding recruits
to tbe Radical party, an! not out or that
abundant generosity of which the gentle
man from Massachusetts was himself so
brilliant an example. Laughter.
Mayuard asked tne gentleman from New
York if that was not a proper motive for
pardon to bring i ecru Us from tbe rebel
lauks into the ranxs ef loyalty.
Cox referred to ihe fact that the other
day Louis Napoleon, six weens after an
attempted insurrection, when men were
after his life, gave an amnesty to the
wtiole realm and made himself stroug by
the act. B
Butler desired to cay, once for all, that
he did not think a great Republic needed
to lake a lesson from au Emperor how to
m'-ike itself strong.
Tuobiil was passed and the House then
went into Committee of the Whole, with
Da-ves In the Chair, aud resumed the con
sideration of the Census bill.
Amendments offered by Judd and Co
burn, looking to au earlier appointment ot
Representatives tliau contemplated in the
bin. led to a long aud animated discussion.
With mt disposing or the question thus
raised, the Committee rose, and the llouso
adjou: ned at 4 o'clock.
