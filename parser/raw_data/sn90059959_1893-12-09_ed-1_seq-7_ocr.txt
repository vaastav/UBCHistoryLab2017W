WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. President
•Cleveland transmitted his message to
congress to-day. He begins by saying:
The constitutional duty which requires the
president from time to time to give to the con
gress information of the state of the union, and
recommend to their consideration such meas
ures as he shall judge necessary and expedient
its fittingly entered upon by commending to the
eongress a careful exam nation of the detailed
statements and well supported recommenda
tions contained in the reports of the heads of
departments, who are chiefly charged with the
executive work of the government.
Peaceful Foreign Relations.
While our foreign relations' have not at all
times during the past year been entirely free
from perplexity, no embarrassing situations
remain th will not yield to the spirit of fair
Bess and love of justice, which, joined with con
sistent firmness, characterize a truly American
foreign policy.
Chinese Registration.
The legislation of last year, known as the
Geary law. requiring the registration of all
Chinese laborers entitled to residence in the
TJnited States, and the deportation qf all not
complying with thj provisions of the act within
the time prescribed, met with much opposition
ldity, in good faith declined to apply for the
certificates required by its provisions.
A test case upon pro eeding by habeas
corpus was brought before the supreme court
ana on May 15, lt93, a decision was made by
that tribunal sustaining the law. It is believed
that under the recent amendment of the act
extending the time for registration the Chi4
aese laborers thereto entitled who desire tore
Side in this country will now avail themselves
of the renewed privilege thus afTorded of estab
lishing by lawful procedure their right to re
main, and that thereby the necessity of en
forced deportation may to a great degree be*
avoided.
The French Republic.
Our relations with the French republic con
tinue to be intimate and cordial. 1 sincerely
hope that the extradition treaty with" that
country, as sfenended by the senate, will soon be
operative.
Germauy-
While occasional questions, affecting our
naturalized citizens returning to the land of
their birth, have arisen in our intercourse with
Germany, our relations with tha* country con
tinue satisfactory.
Great Britain.
The questions affecting our relations with
GreafcBritain have been treated in a spirit at
friendliness. Negotiations are in progress be-
»gi
concurrent action as will make the award and
regulations agreed upon by the Behnng sea
tribunal of arbitration practically effective
and it is'not doubted that Great Britain will
cooperate freely with this country for
the accomplishment of that purpose. The
dispute growing out of the discriminat
ing tolls imposed in the Welland
canal, upon cargoes of cereals bound to
and from the lake ports of the United States,
was adjusted by the substitution of a more
equitable schedule of charges, and my prede
cessor thereupon suspended his proclamation
imposing discriminating tolls upon British
transit, through our canals. A request for ad
ditions to the list ox extraditable offenses cov
ered by tho existing treaty between the two
countries is under consideration.
Uondqran.
It is confidently anticipated that a satis
factory adjustment will soon be reached of the
questions arising out of the seizure and use of
American vessels by insurgents in Honduras
and the subsequent denial by the successful
government of commercial privileges to those
vessels on that account. I
Mexico.
Our relations with Mexico continue to be of that
close and friendly nature which should always
characterize the intercourse of two neighboring
republics. The work of re'ocating the monu
ments marking the boundary between the
countries from Paso del Norte to the Pacific is
now nearly completed. The commission re
cently Organized under the conventions of 1884
and 1889 it is expected will speei iy settle dis-
utes growing out of the shifting currents of
Rio Grande river east of El Paso,
Nicaragua and Guatemala.
Nicaragua has recently passed! through two
'revolutions, the party at first successful hav
jog in turn been displaced by another. Our
newly-appointed minister, by his timely good
offloes, aided In a peaceful adjustment of the
controversy involved in the first conflict The
large American Interests established in that
oountry in connection with the Nicaragua canal
were not molested. The canal company
has, unfortunately, beoome financially serlousl
embarrassed, bat a gOnerous treatment has
been extended to it by the government of Nic
aragua. The United' States are especially in
teres ted in the successful achievement of the
vast undertaking this company has In charge.
'"That it should be accomplished under distinc
tively American auspices, and its enjoyment
assured, not only to the vessels of this country
as a channel of communication bet ween our At
lantic and Paoific seaboards, but to the ships
of the world in the interests of civilization, is a
proposition which, in my judgment, does not
admit of question.
Guatemala has also been visited by the po
litical vicissitudes which have afflicted her
Central American neighbors, but the dissolu
tion of her legislature and the proclamation of
dictatorship have been unattended with civil
war.. v.:-
Extradition with Norway and Ruuia.

cently been proclaimed and exchanged.

March, 1887, and amended and confirmed by the

of our citizens for propei seized and confis

Spain agreeing to pay, unconditionally, as a
fair indemnity. 41,500,000. A respectful but
earnest note was recently addressed to the
Spanish government insisting upon prompt ful
fiilment of its long-neglected obligation. Other

4"~The Hawaiian Affair.,
it'is hardly necessary for me to state thatthe
QUQsttoiis jkrlsmg from out WUKIOM .-jftta.
Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment.
Just prior to the installation of-the present ad'
ministration the exls inggovernmentof Hawaii
bad been suddenly overthrown, and tt treaty or
annexation had been uegQtiated between the
provisional government of the islands and the
United States and submitted to the senate for
ratification. This treaty I withdrew for exam
ination,and dispatched Bon. James H. Blount,of
Georgia, to Honolulu as a special commissioner
to make an'impartial investigation of the cir
cumstances attending the change of govern
ment, ando* all the conditions bearing upon the
subject of the treaty. After a thorough and ex
haustive examination Mr Blount submitted to
me his report showing beyond all question
that the constitutional government of Hawaii
had been subverted with the active aid of our
representative to that government, and through
the intimidation caused by the presence of an
&rni6d u&viil forcc of th6 unitod Stfttw wliicn
was landed for that purpose at the in
stance of „onr minister,upon *«he facts
developed it seemed* to me the only honorable
course for our government to ptfraue was to

representing us and restore as far as prac
ticable the status exis. ling at the time of our

executive tiessage fuHy detailing all the facts
necessary to a complete understanding of the
case, and presenting a history of all tbe materi

Favorable to Arbitration.

senate February 14, 1890, and by the house of
repressntatives on the, 3d of April following, the

Our Circulation.
On the first day of November, 1893, the
amount of money of ail kinds in circulation, or
not included in treasury holdings, was $1,718,544,
682, an increase for tbeyear of *112,404,947. Es
timating our population at 67,426,000 at the time
mentioned the per capita circulation was $25.49.
On the same date there was in the treasury
gold bullion amounting to 496,657,273 and silver
bullion which was purchased at a cost of 126.
261.553.
Sliver Bullion Purchases.
The purchases of silver under the law of July
14, 1890, during the last fiscal year, aggregated
954,008,162.59 tine ounces, which cost 845,531,
374.53. The total amount of silver purchased
from the time that tax became operative until
the repeal of its purchasing clause, on the 1st
day of November, 1893, was 1168,674,
590.46 fine ounces, which cost $155,930,
940.84. Between the 1st day of March,
1873, and the 1st day of November,
the government purchased, under all laws, 503,
003,717 fine ounces of silver at a cost of 1516,622,
948. The silver dollars that have been coined
under the act of July 14,1890. number 36.087,285.
The seigniorage arising from such coinage was
16,977.098.39. leaving on hand in the mints 140,
099,760 fine ounces of silver, which.cost J1 i6,758,
218.
Coinage Statistics.
Our total coinage of all metals during the last
fiscal year consisted of 97,28J,875 pieces, valued
at 143,685,17a80, of which there was 830,038,140 in
.gold coin, $5,343,715 in silver dollars, (7,217,220.90
in subsidiary silver coins and 81,086,102.90 in
minor Coins. During the calendar year 1892
the production of precious metals in the United
States was estimated to be 1.596,375 fine
ounces of gold of the commercial and coinage
value of $33,000,010 and 58,000,000 mine ounces of
silver of the bullion or market value of $50,*
750,000 and of the coinage value of C74,989,900.'

New and Suspended Banks.
One hundred and nineteen national banks
were organized during the year ending October
31,1893, with a capital of 111,230,000. Forty-six
went into voluntary liquidation and 158 sus
pended. Sixty:five of the suspended banks
Were insolvent, eighty-six resumed business
.and seven remained in the hands of bank ex
faminerai, with prospects of speedy resumption
Of the new banks organized forty-four were
located in the eastern states, forty-one west of
the Mississippi river and thirty-four in the
central and southern states. The total number
of national banks in existence on the Slst day of
October, 1893. was 3,796. having an aggregate
capital of (605,558,120. Net increase in the, cir
culation of these banks during the year was
136,886,972.
Repeat of the Silver Purchasing Clause*
The recent repeal of the provisions of law
requiring the purchase of silver bullion by the
government as a feature of our monetary
scheme has made an entire change in the com
plexion of our currency affairs. I do not doubt
that the ultimate result of this action* will be
most salutary and far reaching- .In the nature
of things, however, it is impossible to know
at this time precisely what conditions will be
Vrought about by the change, or what, if any,
such conditions, appear to be essentia) or ex

performinti a service that will put in possession
of the government in time of war most valuable
information and at all times sierve a purpose of
great utility in keeping tbe army advised of the
world's progress in all matters pertaining to
the art of war.
The Judiciary Department.
The report of the attorney general contains the
usual summary of the affairs and proceedings
or the departmvt of justice for the past year,
together with Certain recommendations as to
-needed legislation on various subjects. I can
not too heartily indorse the proposition that the
fee system as applicable to the compensation
of United States attorneys, marshals, clerks
of federal coiftts and United States commis
sioners, should be abolished with as little de
lay as possible It is clearly in the interest of
tbe community that tbe business of the courts,
both civil and criminal, shall be as small and
as inexpensively transacted as the ends
of justice will allow. The system
is therefore thoroughly vicious which
makes the compensation ot court officials de
pend upon the volume of such business, and
thus creates a conflict be*.veen a proper execu
tion of the law and private gain, which cannot
fail to be dangerous to the rights and free
dom of citizens and irrisistible temp
tation to the unjustifiable expenditure
of public funds. If in addition to this re
form another was inaugurated which would
give to the United States commissioners
the final disposition of petty offenses within
the grade of misdemeanors, especially those
coming under the internal revenue laws, a
great advance would be made toward a more
decent administration of the criminal law.
In my first message to congress, dated De
cember 8, 1885, I strongly recommended these
change^ and referred somewhat at length to
the ey 3 of the preserft system. Since ihat
time the criminal business of ihe federal courts
and the expense attending it have enormously
increased. The number of criminal prosecu
tions pending in the circuit and district courts
of the United States on the 1st day of July,
1885, was 3,808, of which l,8-(4 were for vio
lations of the internal revenue laws,
while the number of such prosecutions pending
on the 1st day of July, 18i3, was 9, .0J, of which
4,20J were for violation of the internal reveuue
laws. The expense of the'United States courts,
exclusive of judges' salaries, for the year ending
July 1, 1885, was '2,874,733 11 and for the year
ending July 1, 1893, &4, b'^8,676 87. It is. there
fore, apparent that the reasons given in 1885 for
a change in the manner of enforcing the federal
criminal law have gained cogency and gained
strength in lapse of time.
indorses the Attorney General.
I also heartily join the attorney general in
recommending legislation fixing degrees of the
crime of murder within federal jurisdiction, as
has been, done in many of the states authoriz
ing writs of errors in behalf ot the government
in cases where final judgment is rendered
against the sufficiency of an in
dictment or against the government
upon any other question arising before
actual trial limiting me right ot ruview in
cases of felony punishable only by fine and im
prisonment to the circuit court of appeals, and
making speedy provision for the construction
of such prisons -and reformatories as may be
necessary for tne confinement of United States
convicts.
Postal Affairs.
The report of the postmaster general con
tains a detailed statement of the operations of
the post office department during the last fiscal
year and much interesting informal ion touch
ing this important branch of the public
service. The business of the mails
indicates with absolute certainty the conj
dition of the business of the country,
and depression in financial affairs inevitably
•and quickly reduces the postal revenues.
Therefore a larger discrepancy tuau usual be
tween the post office receipts and expenditures
is the expected and unavoidable result of the
distressing stringency which has prevailed
throughout the country during much of the
time covered by the postmaster general's re
port.
Enormous Deficiency.
At a date when better times were anticipated
it was estimated by his predecessor that the
deficiencv on the 30ih day of June, 1893, would
be but a little over !»l,o00,00ti. It amounted,
however, to more than 15,OUO.OOO. At the same
time, and under the influence of like anticipa
tions, estimates were made for the current
fiscal year ending June 3j, 1894, which exhibited
a surplus of revenue over expenditures of 4872,
245 71 but now, in view of the actual receipts
and expenditures during that part of the cur
rent fiscal year already expired, the present
1893, postmaster general estimates that at iis close
in
instead of a surplus there will be a deficiency
of nearly $8,000,000.
The post office receipts.for the last fiscal year
amounted to 75.896.93J.16, and its expenditures
to i81.074,004.9J. Tnis post office deficiency
would disappear or be immensely decreased if
less matter was carried free through the mails,
an item of which is upward of 300 tons of seeds
and grain from the agricultural department.
The total number of post offices in the United
States on the 30th day of June, 1893. was 68,
403, an increase of 1,284 over the preceding
year. Of these 3,360 were presidential, .an in
crease in that class of 204 over the preceding
year.
The Free Delivery System.
Forty-two free delivery offices were added
during the year to those already existing, mak
ing a total of 610 cities and towns provided
with free delivery on June 30, 1893. Ninety
three other cities and owns are now entitled
to this service under the law, but it has not
tv to the president io invite Other" natioM te value of oivil servtoe reform wfan, after an ex
•ndi a oonference at anv time when there perieneeithat rendes his judgment on tbe sub
should be a fair prospect of accomplishing an ject^alwolutely reliable, he expresses the
•aniehiatie^l -agreeqient on the subject of o|Anim that wiimrat the benefit of this system
funds to meet the expense of
its establishment. I am decidedly of the
opinion that the provisions of the present
law permit as general ah introduction of this
feature of mail service us is necessary or justi
fiable, and that it not be extended to smaller
communities than are now designated The
expense of free delivery for the fiscal year end
ing June & 1894. will be more than 211,000,000,
and under legislation now existing there must
be a constant Increase in this item of expendi
j.' ture.'
0 Money Order Business.
There were 6,401 additions to the domestic
money order offices during the last fiscal year,
being the largest increase in any year since the
inauguration of the sytem. The total number,
of these Offices at the close of the year was
18,434. There were 13,309,735 money orders is
sued from these offices, being an increase over
'tbe preceding year ot 1,240,293 and the
value of these orders amounted to $127,574,
433.66, an increase of 47,509,632 58. There were
also issued during the year postal notes
amounting to 112,903,076.73. During the year
1S6 international money-order offices were
added to those already provided, making a to
tal of 2,407 in operation on June 80 189a
The number of international money orders is
sued during the year was 1,055,99J, an increase
over the preceding year of 72,885. and their
.Value was (16,341,837.86, an increase of 11,221,
806.31. The number of orders paid was 300,917,
nn increase over the preoeding year of
»nd their value was S5,i£83,$7570. an increase of
94,094.83. From the foregoing statements it
appears that the total issue of money orders
andr postal notes for the yew amounted to
«I95 ra,34&2<.'
Tbe number of letters' and packages mailed
n$7,560 30, and the. messengers' fees paid for
50.
The Railway Service.
Tbe railway mail' service notonly adds to the
promptness of mail delivery at all offices, but
It 1s the especial instrumentality which puts
the smaller and way places in the service on an
equality in that regard with the larger and
terminal offices. This branoh of the postal
service has therefore received much attention
.. io8tmaster general, and, though it is
to knotr that it is in a condition of
grataf ying to I
high efficiency and great nsefulness, I am led
to agree with the postmaster general, that
there is soom for its further improvement.:

desire to commend as especially worthy
of prompt attention, the suggestions of the
postmaster general relating to a more sensible
and business-like organization and a better dis
tribution of responsibility in his department ffa
The Navy.
The report of the secretary of the navy con
tains, a history of tbe operations of his depart
ment during the past r, and exhibits a most
gratifying condition of the personnel
satisfac
of our
navy. He presents a satisfactory account of
tbe progress which has been made in the con
struction of vessels and makes a number of
recommendations to which attention is espe
cially invited.
Crnlsers Kept Busy.
During the past six months the demands for
cruising vessels have been ihany and urgent.
There have been revolutions felling for vessels
to protect American interests in Nicaragua,
Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras. Argentina
and Brazil, while the condition of affairs in Hono
lulu has required the constant presence of one or
more ships. With all tnese calls upon ,.our ,.
davyf it m?came necessary, in order to make np
a sufficient fleet to patrol the Behring sea un
«der tbe modus vivendi agreed' upon with Great
Britain, to detail to that service one vessel
from the .fish commission and three from the
revenue marine.
Progress in the construction of new vessels
has not been as rapid as was anticipated
There has been delay in the completion of un
armored vessels, but for the most part they
have been such as are constantly occurring
even in countries having the largest experience
in naval ship building. Tbe most serious de
lays, however, have been in the work upon
armored ships. The trouble bas been the fail
ure of contractors to deliver armor as agreed.
The difficulties seem now, however, to have
been all overcome, and armor is being delivered
with satisfactory promptness.
Our Reorganized Navy.
As a result of the experience acquired by
ship builuers and designers and material men,
it is.believed that the dates when vessels will
be completed can now be estimated with rea
sonable accuracy. Great gu is. rapid fire guns,
torpedoes and powder are being promptly sup
plied.
A Note of Warning.
Since 1886 congress has at each session
authorized the building of one or more vessels,
and the secretary of the navy presents an
earnest plea for the continuance of
this plan. He recommends the
zation of at least one battleship and
six torpedo boats. While 1 am dis
tinctly in favor of consistently pursuing the
policy we have inaugurated of building up a
thorough and efficient nJvy 1 cannot refrain
from the suggestion that the congress should
carefully take iuto accouht the number of un
finished vessels on our hands and the depleted
condition of our treasury in considering the
propriety of an appropriation at this time to
begin new work.
The method of employing mechanical labor
at navy yards through boards of labor, and
making efficiency the sole test by which labor
ers are employei and continued, is produc
ing the best results, and the secretary is
earnestly devoting himself to its development
Attention is invited to the statements of his
report in regard to tne workings of the system.
The Pension Rolls.
The secretary of the interior has the super
vision of so many important subjects that his
report is of especial value and interest. On the
30ih day of June. 1893, there were on the pen
sion nisls 96(1,012 names, an increase of 89,944
over the number on the rolls June 30, 189& Of
these there were 167 widows and daughters of
revolutionary soldiers, 86 survivors of the war
of 1812,5,425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,
518 survivors and widows of the Mexican war,
3,332 survivors and widows of Indian wars, 281
army nurses and 475,645 survivors and widows
and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of
the war of the rebellion The latter number
represents those pensioned on account of disa
bilities or death resulting from army and navy
service. The number of persons remaining on
the rolls June 30. 1893, who were pensioned un
der the act of June 27, 1890, which allows pen
sions oh account of death and disability not
chargeable to army service, was 459,155.
The number added to the rolls during the
year was 123,6S4 and the number dropped was
33,1690. The first payments on pensions al
lowed during the year amounted to $33,756,
549.98. This includes arrears, or the accumu
lation between the time from which the al
lowance of pension dates and the time of actual'
ly granting the-certificate.
Pensions for Disabilities.
Although the law of 18W permits pensions for
disabilities not related to military service, yet
as a requisite to its benefits a disability must
exist ••incapacitating applicants "from the per
formance of manual labor to such a degree as
to render them unable to earn a support." The
execution Of this Jaw in its early stages does
not seem to have been in accord
with its true intention but toward
the close of the last administration an
authoritative construction was given to the
statute and since that time this construction
nas been followed. This nas had the effect of
limiting the operation of the law to its intended
purpose. The discovery having been made that
many names had been put upon the pension
roll by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds,
the commissioner suspended payments upon
a number of pensions which seem«d to be
fraudulent or unauthorized pending a com
plete examination, giving notice to the pension
ers in order that they might have an opportun
ity to establish, if possible, the justice of their
claims notwithstanding apparent invalidity
Frauds Should Be Exposed.
This, I understand, is the practice which has
for a long time prevailed in the pension
bureau, but after entering upon these recent
investigations the commissioner modified this
rule so as not to allow, until after complete ex
amination, interference with the payment of a
pension apparently hot altogether void, but
which merely had been iixea at a rate higher
than authorized by law. I am unable
to understand why frauds in the pension
rolls should not be exposed and corrected with
thoroughness and vigor. Every name fraudu
lently put upon these rolls i® a wicked imposi
tion upon the kindly sentiment in which pen
sions have their origin. Every fraudulent pen
sioner has become a bad citizen: every false
oath in support of a pension has made perjury
more common, *nd false and undeserving pen
sioners rob the people not only of their
money but of the patriotic sentiment
.which the survivors of war. fought for
the preservation of the union, ought to in
spire. Thousands of neighborhoods have their
well-known fraudulent pensioners, and recent
developments by the bureau establish appall
ing conspiracies to accomplish pension frauds.
By no means the least wrong done is to brave
and deserving pensioners, who certainly ought
not to be condemned to such association. Those
who attempt in the line of duty to rectify-these
wrongs should not be accused of enmity or in
difference to the claims of honest veterans.
Enormous Expenditures.
The sum expended on account of pensions foi
the year ending June 3J, 1893, was #156,740,467.14.
Tbe commissioner estimates that 3165,OJO,OOC
will be required to pay pensions during the
year ending June 30,189*.
Indian Affairs.
The condition of the Indians and their ulti
mate fate are subjects which are related to a
sacred duty of the government and: which
strongly appeal to the sense of justice and the
sympathy of our people.
Our Indians number about 248,000. Most o£
them are located on 161' reservations, contain
ing 86,116,531 acres of land. Abdut 110,000 of
these Indians have, to a large degree, adopted
Civilized customs. Lands in severalty have
been allotted to many of them Such allott
ments have been made to
JO,000
ing the last fiscal
individuals dur­
year,
embracing about
1.000,000 acres. The number of Indian gov
ernment schools open during the year was
195, an increase of twelve over the preceding
year. Of this total 170 were on reservations,»of
which seventy-three Were boarding schools and
ninety^seven were toy schools. Twenty board
ing schools and five day schools supported by
the government were not located on reserva
tions. The total number of Indian children en
rolled during the year as attendants of all
schools was 21,138, an incresse of 1,231 over tbe
enrollment, for the previous year.
What Is Best for the Indian.
I am sure tbat secular education and moral
and religious teaching must be important fac
tors in an effort to salve the Indian and lead mm
to civilization. I believe, too, that the relink
quishment of tribal relations and the holdingof
land in severalty may, in favorable conditions,
aid this consummation. It seems to me,-how
ever, tbat allotment of land in severalty ought
to be made with great care and circumspection.
If hastily done before tbe Indian knows its mean
ing, while yet he has little or no idea of tilling
a farm and no conception of thrift, there is
great danger (bat a reservation life in tribal
relations may be exchanged for the pauperism
of civilization, instead, of its independence ana
elevation. *The solution of the Indian problem
depends very largely upon good administration.
The personal fitness of agents and their adapt
ability to the peculiar duty of cartng for $feir
wards are of theutmost importance: Y»-
Danger of Abuses.
-The law providing that, except in especial
cases, army officers shall be detailed as Indian
agents, it'is hoped will prove a successful
experiment. There is danger of great, abuses
creeping into the prosecution of claims for
Indian depredations, and I recommend tbat
every possible safeguard be provided against
the enforcement of unjust and fictitious, claims
Jt this description The appropriations on
account of the Indian bureau for tbe year

Private Control of Publte Lsafla
The rast area of land whicu, but a short time
ago, constituted the public domain is rapidly
fallittginto t^ivate hands. Iti8 certt$in that in
the transfer tbe beneficent Intention of the gov
ernment to supply from its 'domain homes to.
the industrious and worthy homeseekers is.
often frustrated. Though the speculator, who
stands with extortionate purposn between the
land office and those who, with their families,
are invited by the government to settle on the
public lands, is a despicable character who.
ought not to be tolerated* yet it is difflchlt to
thwart his schemes.
Opening of the Strip.
The recent opening' to settlement of the
lands in the Cherokee outlet, embracing an
area of 6,&J0,00 acres, notwithstanding the ut
most care in framing the regulations governing
the selection of locations and notwithstanding
the presence of United States troops, fur
nished an exhibition, though perhaps in a mod
ified degree, of the mad scramble, the violence
and the fraudulent occupation which have ac
companied previous openings of public land I
concur with the secretary in the belief that
these outrageous incidents cannot be
entirely^prevented without a change in the
laws on the subject, anil I hop©c his recom
mendations in tnat direction will be favorably
Considered
Preserve the Forests.
I especially commend to the attention of the
congress the statements contained in tbe secre
tary's report concerning forestry. The time
has come when efficient measures should be
taken for the preservation of our forests from
indiscriminate and remorseless destruc
tion. The report of the secretary of
agriculture wiil be found exceedingly in
teresting, especially to that large part of
our citizens intimately concerned in agri
cultural occupations. On the 7th ot March, 1893,
there were upon its payrolls 2,4JO employes.
This number has been reduced to 1,850 persons
In view of a depleted public treasury and the
imperative demand of the people for economy
in the administration of their government, the
secretary has entered upon the task ol rational
ly reducing expenditures by the elimination
from the payrolls of all persons not needed for
an efficient conduct of the affairs of the depart
ment
... V-'
Cutting Down Expenses.
During the first quarter of the present year
the expenses of the department aggregated
1345,876.76, as against 8402.012.42 for the corre
sponding period^ the fiscal year ending June
30,1893. The secretary makes apparent his in
tention to continue this rate of reduction by
authori submitting estimates for the next fiscal year
less by 4994,280 than those for the present year.
Among the heads of divisions in this depart
ment the changes have been exceedingly few.
Three vacancies occurring from death and res
ignations have been filled by the promotion of
assistants in the same divisions. These promo
tions of experienced and faithful assistants have
not only been in the interest of official
work, but have suggested to those in the de
partment who look for retention and promo
tion that merit and devotion to duty are their
best reliance.
The amount appropriated for the bureau of
animal industry for the current fiscal year Is
3850 000 the estimate for the ensuing year is
4700,000.
Contagious Diseases of Animals.
The'regulations of 1892 concerning Texas fever
have been enforced during the last year, and
the largest stock yards of the country have
been kept free from infection. Occasional local
outbreaks have been largely such ^s
could have been effectually guarded against by
the owners of the affected cattle. While con
tagious pleuro-pneumonia in cattle has been
eradicated, auimal tuberculosis, a disease
widespread and more ^dangerous to human life
than pieuro-pneumonia, is still prevalent In
vestigations have been made during the past
year as to the means of its communication and
the'method of its correct diagnosis. Much
progress bas been made in. this direction by
the studies of the division of animal pathology,
but work ought to be extended in cooperation
with local authorities until the danger to hu
man life arising from this cause is reduced to a
minimum.
The number of animals arrived from Canada
during the year and inspected by bureau offi
cers was 462,092, and the number from trans
Atlantic countries was 1,297. No contagious
diseases were found among the reported ani
mals. Tbe total number of inspections of cat
tle for export during the past fiscal year was
611,542.
Palling Off in Exports.
The exports show a falling off of about 25 per
cent, from the preceding year, the decrease oc
curring entirely in the last half of the year.
This suggests that, the falling off may have
been largely due to an increase in the price of
American export cattle. During the year end
ing June 30. 1893, exports of inspected pork ag
gregated 20,677,410 pounds, as against 38,152,874
pounds for the preceding year. The falling off
in this export was not confined, however, to in
spected pork, the total quantity exported in
1892 being 665,490,616 pounds, while in 1893 it was
only 527,308.693 pounds.
I join the secretary in recommending that
hereafter each applicant for the position of in
spector or assistant inspector in the bu
reau of animal industry be required, as
a condition precedent to his appointment,
to exhibit to the 'United States civil serv
ice commission his diploma from ah established,
regular and reputable veterinary college, and
that this be supplemented by such an examina
tion in veterinary science as the commission
may prescribe.
Exports of Agricultural Products.
The exports of agricultural products (Ton)
the United States for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1892, attained the enormous figure of
$600,000,030, in round numbers, being 78.7 per
cent of our total exports. In the last fiscal
year this aggregate was greatly reduced, but
nevertheless reached 86I5,00J,00J, being 75.1 per
cent, of all American commodities exported.
A review of our agricultural exports with
special reference to their desiination will show
that in almost every line the 'United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland absorbs by far the
largest proportion. Of cattle, the total exports
aggregated in value for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1893, 820,000,000, of which Great Britain
took considerably over $25,000,000. Of beef
products of all kinds our total exports were
128,000,000, of which Great Britain rook 824,000,
000.
Of pork producds the total exports were 884.
000,000, of which Great Britain took £58,000,000.
In breadstuffs, cotton and minor products like
proportions sent .to the same destination are
shown.
Service of Great. Value.
The work of the statistical division of the de
partment of agriculture deals with all that re
lates to the economies of farming. The main
purpose of its monthly reports is to keep the
farmers informed as fully as possible of all
matters having any influence upon the worid's
markets, in which the products find
,sale. Its publications relate especially
to the commercial side of farming. It is there
fore of profound importance and vital concern
to the farmers of the United States, who rep
resent nearly one-half of our population, and
also of direct interest to the whole country
that the work of this division be efficiently
performed and that- the Informaniou it has
gathered be promptly diffused.
It is a matter of congratulation to know that
the secretary will not spare any effort to make
this part of his work thoroughly usefuL, In tbe
year I838 the congress appfopriated $1,030 to.be
taken from the patent office funds for the pur
pose of collecting and distributing rare and lm
proved varieties of seeds and for prosecutii
agricultural investigations and procuring aft
cultural statistics. From this small beginning
the seed division of the department of agricul
ture has grown to its present unwieldy and un
justifiably extravagant proportions.
Dnring the last fiscal year the cost of seeds
purchased was §66,548.64-. The remainder of an
appropriation of $135,000 was expended in put
ting them up and distributing them. It surely
never coulf have, entered the minds of those,
who first sanctioned appropriations of public
money for the purchase of new and
improved varieties of seeds for gratuit
ous distribution that from this would
grow large appropriations for the purpose of
distribution by members of congress of or
dinary seeds, bulbs and cuttings, wbich are
common in all the states and territories and
everywhere easily obtained at low prices.
Wasteful Distribution of Seeds.
In-each state and territory an agricultural
experiment station bas been established. These
stations, by their very character and name, are
the proper agencies to experiment with and
te»tnew varieties of seeds: and yet this indis
criminate and wasteful distribution of legisla
tion and legislators continues, answering no
purpose unless it be to remind constituents that
theffrepresentafives are willing to remember
them with gratuities at public oost.
Under the sanction of existing legislation,
there was sent out from the agricultural depart
ment during the last fiscal year enough of cab
bage seed to plant 19,200 acres of land,- a suffi
cient quantity of beans to plant 4,000 acres,
beet seed enough to plant 2.500 acres,
sweet corn enough to plant 7.800 acres sufficient
cucumber seed to cover 2,205 acres with vines,
and enough muskmelon and-watermelon seeds
to plan -2,875 acres. The total quantity of flower
and vegetable seeds thus distributed was con
tainedln more than9,000,000 packages and they
were sufficient, if planted, to cover 89,596 acres
ofland.*
Should Be Abolished.

Workings of the Civil ^Service Law.
The oontlnued intelligent execution of the
civ 1 service law and the increasing approval of
the people of its operation are most gratifying.
Tne recent extension of its limitations and X'
regulations to the employes at free de-
livery post offices, which has been hon
estly and promptly accomplished by the
commission,' with the hearty cooperation of the
postmaster general, is an immensely important
advance in tbe usefulness of the system. Iam,
-if possible, more than ever convinced of the in
calculable benefits conferred by tbe civil serv
ice law. not only in its effect upon tbe publio
service, but also, what is even more important
in its effect in elevating the tone of political
life generally.
Popular Love of Right and Justice.
The course of civil service reform in this
country instructively and interestingly illus
trates how strong a hold a movement gains
upon our people which has underlying it a sen
timent of justice and right, and which at .the
same time promises better administration of
their government The law embodying
this reform found its way to our
statute book more from fear of the
popular sentiment existing its favor
than from any love for the reform
itself on the part of legislators and it has lived
ahd grown and flourished in spite of the covert
as well as open hostility of spoilsmen and not
withstanding the querulous impracticability of
many
self-constituted
guardians. Beneath all
the vagaries ana sublimated theories whichare
attracted to it there underlies this reform a
sturdy common-sense principle not only suited
to this mundane sphere, but whose application
our people are more and more recognizing to be
absolutely essential to the most successful op
eration of their government, if not to its per
petuity.
An Inconsistency Pointed Out.
It seems to me to be entirely inconsistent
with the character of this reform, as well as
with its best enforcement, to oblige the com
mission to rely for cler.cil assistance upon
clerks detailed from other departments. There
ought not to be such a condition in any depart
ment that clerks hired to do the wo'U there
can be spared to habitually work at another
place and it d. es not accord with a sensible
view of civil service reform that persons
should be employed on the theory that their
labor is necessary in one department when in
point of fact their services are devoted to en
tirely different work in another department. 1
earnestly urge that the clerks necessary to
carry on the work of the commission be regu
larly put upon its roster, and that the system
of obliging the commissioners to rely upon the
services of clerks belonging to other depart
ments be discontinued. This ought not to in
crease the expense to the government, while it
would certainly be more consistent and add,
greatly to the efficiency of the commission.
Economy Is Urged.
Economy in public expenditure is a duty
that cannot innocently be neglected by those
intrusted with the control of money drawn
from the people for public uses. It must be
confessed that our apparently endless re
sources, the familiarity of our people with im
mense accumulations of wealth, the growing
Sentiment among them that the expenditures
of public money should in some manner be
to their immediate and personal advantage, the
indirect and almost stealthy manner in which
a large part of our taxes are exacted, and a de
generated sense of official accountability have
led to growing extravagance in governmental
appropriations. At this time, when a depleted
public treasury confronts us, when many of our
people are engaged in a hard struggle for the
necessaries or life and when enforced economy is
pressing upon the great mass of our country
men, I desire to urge, with ail the earnestness
at my command, that congressional legislation
be so limited by strict economy as to exhibit an
appreciation of the condition of the treasury
and a sympathy with the strained circum
stances of our fellow citizens. The duty of
public economy is also of immense importance
in its intimate and necessary relation to the
task now in hand of providing revenue to meet
government expenditures and yet reducing the
people's burden of federal taxation.
Tariff Reform Before Us.
After a hard struggle tariff reform is directly
before us. Nothing so important claims ourat
tention and nothing so clearly presents itself as
both an opportunity and a duty—an oppor
tunity to deserve the gratitude of our fcllow
citizns and a duty imposed upon us by our oft
repeated professions and by the emphatic man
date of the people. After full discussion our
countrymen have spoken in favor of this re
form, and they have confided the work of its
accomplishment to the hands of those who are
solemnly pledged to it.
For Revenue Only.
If there is anything in the theory of a repre
sentation in public places of tbe people and
their desires, if public officers are really' the
servants of the people, and if political promises
and professions have any binding force, our
failure to give the relief so long awaited will be
sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to
distract our attention or disturb our efforts
until this reform is ac oinplished by wise and
careful legislation. While we should .stanchly
adhere to the principle that only the
necessity of revenue justifies the imposition of
tariff duties and other federal taxation, and
that they should be limited by strict economy,
we cannot close our eyes to the fact that condi
tions have grown up among us which in justice
and fairness call for discriminating care in the
distribution of such duties and taxation as the
emergencies of our government actually de
mand.
Reduction Must Be Substantial.
Manifestly, if we are to aid the people direct
ly through tariff reiorm, one of its most obvi
ous features should be a reduction in present
tariff charges upon the necessaries of life. The
benefits of such a reduction would be palpa
ble and substantial, seen and felt by thousands
who would be better fed and better clothed and
better sheltered. These gifts should be the will
ing benefactions of a government whose high
est function is the promotion of the wellare o£
the people.
Not less closely, related to our people pros
perity and well-being is the removal of restric
tions upon the importation of the raw materi
als necessary to our manufactures The world
should be open to our national ingenuity and
enterprise. This cannot be while federal legis
lation. through the imposition of high tariff,
forbids to American manufactures as cheap
materials as those used by their competitors.
It is quite obvious that the enhancement of the
price of our manufactured products resulting'
from this policy not only confines the market
for these products within our own borders, to the
direct disadvantage of our manufacturers, but
also increases their cost to oui citizens.
Labor's Interests Involved.
The interests of labor are certainly though
indirectly involved in this feature of our tariff
system The sharp competition and active
struggle among our manufacturers to supply
the limited demand for tbeir goods soon fill the
narrow market to which they are confined.
Then follows a suspension of work in mills and
factories, a discharge of employes, and distress
in the homes of our working me
a.
Even if the often disproved assertion could
be. made good that a lower rate of wages would
result from free raw materials and low tariff
duties, the intelligence of our workingmea
leads them quickly to discover that their
steady employment, permitted by free raw ma
terials, is the most important factor in their re
flation to tariff legislation.
The New Measure.
A measure has been prepared by the appro
prlate congressional committee embodying
tariff reform on the lines herein suggested.
which will be promptly submitted for legisla
tive actions It is the result of much patriotic
and unselfish work, and 1 believe it deals
with its subjects consistently and thor
oughly as existing conditions permit
am satisfied tbat the reduced tariff duties
provided. for in the proposed legislation
added to existing internal revenue taxation
will in the near future, though perhaps not im
mediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet
the'needs of the government The committee,
after full consideration, and to provide against
a temporary deficiency which may exist before
the business of the country adjusts itself to the
new tariff schedules, have wisely embraced iu
their plan a few additional internal revenue
taxes, including a small tax upon incomes de
rived from certain corporate investments
Will Not Disturb Business.
Must Subordinate Personal Deslr6s^"
In my great desire for thev success of this
measure I cannot restrain the suggestion that
its success can only be attained by means of
unselfish counsel on the part of the frieodsof
tariff reform and asa result of their willingness
to subordinate personal desires and aihbi ttons
to the general good The localinterestsaffecteA
by the proposed reform
are so numerous and So
varied that if all are insisted upon the legisla
tion embodying the reform must inevitably fan.
