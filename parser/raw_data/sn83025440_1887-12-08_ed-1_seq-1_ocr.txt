The above call is made in pursuance
of a call for a territorial convention,
which is signed by a certain number
from seventy three counties in the
territory. The call for the territorial
convention reads as follows:
To the voters of the territory of Dakota:—B-s
llevinK that the time has arrived whan the claims
of Dakota to statehood should bo presented to con
gress in a dignified, proper and respectful manner,
you are earnestly requested to assemble in county
convention at au early day and elect delegates to a
convention ot the people of Dakota, irresprctlve of
political parties or affiliation*, to be held iu the
city of Aberdeen on the 15th day of December,
1887, at noon of that day.
All persons who favor the admission or Dakota
as a whole and without further unnecessary delay
are invited to take part in this convention. We
believe that if Dakota's claims are fairly prosented
to the congress of the United Btitea ab^ut to as
semble, that an enabling act will be passed author
izing the holdiog of a constitutional couveution
for tbe whoto territory, and that an Boon ha the
labors of that convention fhall be ratified by the
people of the territory we will be admitted as a
state.
Whereas, the above petition has been circulated
and numerously signed by th'j voters* in all parts
of the territory and a deep interest in the question
of admission eilsts among all classes of citizens of
the territory, a convention of tbe people of Dakota,
entirely nonpartisan, is hereby called to meet in
the city of Aberdeen, on Thursday, the 15th day of
December. 1887, at twelve o'clock, noon, of that
day, for tbe purpose of preparing a memorial to
congress, praying for the passage of an enabling
act authorizing the holding of a constitutional
convention, aud the submission or that constitu
tion to a vote of the peoplo of Dakota for its ac
ceptance or rejection, preparatory to the admission
of Dakota into the Federal uniou, aud to take such
action as may be deemed wise, and for the best in
terests of the people of Dakota for tbe presenta
tion of such memorial to congress, aud to transaot
such other business as may properly come before
the convention, it is recommended that the people
assemble in mass convention at the county seats
of their respective counties on 8aturday tbe 10th
day of December, 1887, for such purpose.

Congress convened last Monday.
John G. Carlisle was elected speaker
of the house. Turpie, tha democratic
senator-elect from Indiana, was sworn
in without protest, which leaves the
senate a republican majority of two,
with Riddleberger, or a tie without his
vote. The only Dakota bill with a
chance of passage is the reservation,
bill, which stands a fair chance.' Hon.
John II. King, of Buffalo Gap, and
Hon. J. J. Kleiner, of Pierre, a former
Indiana democratic congressman, have
gone to Washington where they will
camp for the winter, in the interest of
the reservation bill, and they will be
followed shortly by Frank Pettigrew,
of Sioux Falls, and Commissioner of
Immigration McCIure, of Pierre.
These gentlemen, in company with
Delegate Gilford and the senators and
congressmen from the northwestern
states, constitute a strong lobby, and
the chances for the reservation open
ing are decidedly promising.
President Cleveland Tuesday sent
to the senate the names of Lucius Q.
C. Lamar, of Mississippi, for justice
of the supreme court Win. F. Vilas,
of Wisconsin, for secretary of the in
terior, to succeed Mr. Lamar, and
Dan M. Dickinson, of Michigan, for
postmaster general, to succed Mr.
Vilas. Jas. W. Hyatt, of Connecticut,
was nominated for treasurer. It is
not likely that the senate will confirm
the appointment of Lamar—his action
during the late war making him an
unsafe man to hold a position on the
court of last resort.
The delivery of the compiled laws
of Dakota to the territorial and
county officials has begun. It is not
believed, however, that the book will
come into practical use in the terri
tory, for several reasons. Firstly, it is
the practice in the several states to
have the laws carefully revised by a
committee of competent lawyers, and
then the legislature adopts or rejects
the work section by section. In this
case the work was entrusted to a com
mittee of two-one editor and one law
yer, who hastily made up a revision,
naturally putting their own construct
ion upon debatable points, and tbe
book is thus thrown upon the market
as the "Laws of Dakota." This little
by-play costs the territory some #20,
000, and the money is virtually thrown
away. The criticism does not apply
to the Messrs. Caldwell and Price, who
simply hare performed a routiue ser
vice for but njfon a legislature so
CANTON,
devoid of legal ability and practical
common sense. But the important
objection that will be made to the use
of the book lies in the fact that the
time for the publication of the laws
expired some twenty days before the
work was ready for delivery, which
invalidates the usefulness of the book
and makes a dead-letter of the law au
thorizing its publication. In the first
place the law that authorized the pub
lication was not good, and now that
the law itself lias not been complied
with, the work is utterly worthless
and useless.
The World prints prominently the
following Washington special: The
president's message, the first congress
of our second century as the United
States, will be unprecedented in the
long records of such communications.
For the first time in history the mes
sage to a new congress will discuss
but one question. The president will
say that, in view of the paramount
and even vital importance to the coun
try of a reduction of the tariff, he will
treat of that subject alone, and for the
present will refer congress, as to the
affairs of the different departments,
to the reports of the various cabinet
officers. The message will be mufeli
shorter than the public has been led to
expect. It is entirely in the hand
writing of the president, is full of his
characteristic expressions, and is said
to be of his own preparation with, of
course, suggestions from his advisers
in and out of the cabinet from the first
to the last. The president will take
radical ground upon the tariff ques
tion. lie will recommend that nearly
all raw materials to be used in the
manufactories shall be put upon the
fre list. He will recommend specifi
tally that iron ores, tin, plate, salt,
lumber, coal aud wool shall be put up
on the free list. He will not recom
mend that copper ores shall be placed
upon the free list. lie will not refer
at any great length to the discussion
as to the reduction of internal reve
nue duties, but will make it clear that
he altogether disapproves of that
proposition. He will refer specifi
cally to many articles upon which
there are now unduly high import du
ties, and Tecommend a proper reduc
tion of tbe tarilf upon them. There
will be nothing in his message akin to
the horizontal reduction scheme of tho
last Morrison bill. His recommen
dations are more in the line of the bill
offered by Abram S. Hewitt in the
Forty-seventh congress. The presi
dent's statistician estimates that the
reduction thus specifically recom
mended will amount to about $80,000,
000 per annum. The president in re
ferring to the surplus, will point out
with great vigor, the absolute, and
above all, the speedy necessity of the
passage of such a bill as will at the
earliest possible moment relieve the
country from this improper and really
illegal drain upon its resources.
The case of Ilawarden vs the Cal
liopr, Burlington and Northern rail
way company came up for trial in the
district court at Orange City last Tues
day. This is a suit wherein Ilawar
den seeks to annul the tax voted in aid
of the above-named road. The case,
however, was continued until the next
torn) of court (January 23, 1888), al
though the attorneys for the defense
done everything in their power to have
the case tried at this term of court. If
there had been any hope of Hawarden
winning the suit the case would not
have been continued. The truth of
the matter is, both the Milwaukee and
the Northwestern are fighting the
tax, and what is more, but a short
time since the attorneys for both roads
met and agreed to work hand in hand
to defeat the tax. Ilawarden well
knows the road will be built next
spring, and knowing, too, they would
be defeated in the tax suit, they now
crawl out of it with tbo faint hope of
stealing the road if they can.
The Minneapolis Tribune publishes
an interesting sketch relative to the
mariner }n which the admission move
ment first originated and finally be
came a fixed issue in the politics of
Dakota. The start was made when
congress seated Armstrong, democrat,
in 1872, by 78 majority. Fraud ran
rampant on all sides In the campaign,
whitih fiflsp Burleigh and Armstrong
$25,000 each and epjjik went broke
entirely. Besides a great many either
sharp dodges that were played after
election was the delay iu returning the
count from Pembina county, which
was an unknown quantity, and it
proved the first protoxt for division.
Continuing its strain of reminiscen
ces the Tribunes says:
The actual political and sectional
history of Dakota dates from the fall
of 1870. At that time there were on
ly nine organized counties, towit:
Union, Clay, Yankton, ItouIIomme,
Lincoln, Turner, Miunehaha, Pembina
and Charles Mix. To some of these
was attached unorganized territory
for voting purposes. The population
of the territory in 1870 was a trifle over
14,000, and occupied a large extent of
country.
The vote cast at Pembina bad to
comfe overland to St. Paul, thence by
railroad to Chicago, west to Dubuque,
Sioux City, and from the latter point
by stage to Yankton. It has always
been thought that the Pembina re
turning board furnished a precedent
for the Louisiana returning board.
Shortly after tbe returns were receiv
ed, Dr. Burleigh announced it as his
belief that "they can vote from one to
a million half-breeds at Pembina, un
der the leadership of Jud LaMoure
and old man Roulette." Pembina was
the general trading point for the
Manitobans and Minnesotianp of that
country, hence Burleigh's remark.
It was then determined to divide
the territory, and a bill was drawn up
and introduced in the senate by Sena
tor Hamsey, of Minnesota, una A du­

The Anotiorf Trial.
Sioux City Journal, 4: The most im
portant testimony introduced yester
day was that of W. E. Park, of Canton,
Dak., and J. II. Alger, of Oregon, Wis.
They both testified In substance that
Louis Ilagenois said iu the Harlan ho
tel at Canton last Sunday that on the
night of the murder Arensdorf came to
the Shepherd saloon about 9:30 that he
(Ilagenois) took Arensdoifs order for
two beefsteaks, delivered the order over
to the night cook, and then put on his
coat and
left the saloon and aid not see
Arensdorf again that nigwt. Hagenois
had testified that he saw Arensdorf, in
the saloon twice, having shaken dice
with him the last timfr for drinks.

of the Canton News, came in from

anything else. Let the ornate colonel

A I»cmoer»llc Move.
There is no denying the fact that the
Aberdeen one-state convention is a
democratic move—conspired in'demo
cratic headquarters in order to cap
ture a few republicans and create as
great a division in republican ranks as
possible. As the LaMoure Progress
and Chronicle remarks: L. G. John
son, who is chairman of the Aberdeen
committee, was "boss"
of the democrat
ic territorial committee
only a year ago,
and we knew him long before that, in
Illinois, as a bourbon "politician," and
very little else. Alex. McKenzie and
Maj. Edwards, and their partisans, are
confreres with Johnson in this scheme,
and they will pass for "politicians," in
Dakota or elsewhere. The Canton
Advocate-says: "In this city the
work is headed by Col. Boynton, a lead
iug democrat, and the move is intend
ed to disintegrate and break up the re
publican party in Dakota." Col. Boyn
ton Is not only a leading democrat but
he is a leading democratic office holder
of the territory, being a member of tbe
railroad commission appointed by Gov.
Church. Ex-Mayor Skillman, of Aber
deen, bas traveled all over North Dako
ta, working up delegates tp attend the
convention.

HAPPY HITS,
In the case of a woman who was tried for
killing her husband with a stone, the verdict
was rendered that the killing was accidental
on the ground that if she intentionally threw
the stone at him, it would have hit something
in an opposite direction.—The Epoch.
A citizen of Dallas, Tex., has invented an
electric Ashing line which kills a flsh the in
stant it seizes the hook and at the same time
rings a bell on shore to warn the fisherman
jvhq may be under a tree some yards distant
playing seven up with a brpther angjpf to de
cide which shall pay for the bait. An attach'
ment that would clean and dry the flsh before
they ore hauled out of the water would prove
a great boon to the fisherman and make the
inventor's fortune.— Norristown Herald.
The New York Commercial Advertiser says
a Buffalo man "dreamed that he had been
plected alderman, got up in his sleep, dressed
and went to a restaurant, where he treated
his dream world supporters tg &8Q worth 3*
drinks before he woke up." He dreamed, of
course, that he had been elected a Buffalo al

THE FUTURE MAN.
Sill Nye Kw»s«fi Bins (ram a Scientific
Standpoint.
ITHOITT wishing
to alarm the
it passing through a great era of change
even womankind is not built as she was a few
brief years ago. And is it not time, fellow
citizens, that we pause to consider what is to
be the future of the American?
Food itself has been the subject of change
both in the matter of material and prepara
tion. This must affect the consumer in such
a way as to some day bring about great
changes. Take, for instance, the oyster, one
of our comparatively modern food and game
fishes, aud watch the effects of science upon
him. At one time the oyster browsed around
and ate what he could find in Neptune's back
yard, and we had to take him as we found
him. Now we take a herd of oysters off the
trail, all run down, and feed them artificial
ly till they swell up to a fancy size and bring
a fancy price. Now, where will all this lead
at last? I ask as a careful scientist. Instead
of eating apples, as Adam did, we work the
fruit up into applejack and pie, while even
the simple oyster is perverted, and instead of
allowing him to fatten up in the fall on
acorns and ancient mariners, flesh is artifici
ally put on his bones by the artificial osmose
and dialysis of our advanced civilization.
How can you make an oyster stout or train
him down by making him jerk a health lift
so many hours every day, or cultivate his
body at the expense of his mind, without ul
timately not only impairing tbe future use
fulness of the oyster himself, but at the same
time affecting the ruture of the human race!
I only use the oyster as an illustration, and
I do not wish to cause alarm, but I say that
if we stimulate the oyster artificially and
swell him up by scientific means we not only
do so at the expense of bis better nature and
keep him away from his family^ but we are
making our mark on the future race of men.
Oyster fattening is now, of course, in its in
fancy. Only a few years ago an effort was
mode to fatten cove oysters at St. Louis
while in the can, but the system was not
wo!l understood and those who had it in charge
only succeeded in making the can itself more
plump. But now oysters are kept on ground
feed and given nothing to do for a few weeks,
and even the older and overworked sway
backed and rickety oysters of the dim and
murky past are made to fill out and many of
them liave to put a gore in the waistband of
their shells. I only speak of the oyster in
cidentally as one of the objects towards
which science has turned its attention, and I
assert with ihe utmost confidence that the
time will come, unless science should get a
set back, when the present hunting case oys
ter will give phv-e to the open face oyster,
grafted on toe octopu# and big enough to
feed a hotel. Further than that, the oyster
of the future will carry in a hip pocket a
Cask of vinegar, half a dozen lemons aud
two little Japanese bottles, one of which will

will be some way provided by which you can
tell which is which. But are we improving
tho oyster now? That is a question we may
wel ask ourselves. Is this a healthy fat
which we are putting on him or is it bloat!
And what will be the result in the home life
of the oyster? We take him from all home
influences whatever in order to make a swell
of liirn by our modern methods, but do we
improve his condition morally, and what is
to be the great final result on man?
The reader will see by the questions I ask
that I am a true scientist. Give me an over
coat pocket full of URter case interrogation
marks and a medical report to run to, and I
can speak on the matter of science and ad
vancement till Reason totters on her throne.
Sut food and oysters do not alone affect the
great, pregnant future. Our race is being
tampered with not only by means of adulter
ations, political combinations and cliraatio
changes, but even our methods of relaxation
ara productive of peculiar physicial condi
tions, malformations and some moro things
of that kind.
Cigarette smoking produces a flabby and
endogenous condition of the optic toerve, and
constant listening at a telephone and always
with the same ear gradually decreases the
power of the other ear till it finally just
stands around drawing its salary, but ac
tually refusing to hear anything. Carrying
an eight pound cane makes a man lopsided,
and the muscular and nervous strain that is
necessary to retain a single eyeglass and keep
it out of the soup, year after year, draws the
mental stimulus that should go to the thinker
itself, i)ntil at last tbp ntfnd wanders ftway
and forgets to come book, or becomes atro
phied, and the great mental strain incident
to the work of pounding sand or coming in
when it rains is more than it is equal to.
Football produces what may be called the
endogenous or ingrowing toe nail, string halt
aud mania. Copenhagen induces melancholy,
and the game of bean bags is unduly exciting.
Horse racing is too brief and transitory as an
outdoor game, requiring weeks and months
for preparation and lasting only long enough
for a quick person to ejaculate 'Scat!" The

We construct the Crystal Well. It
combines all the qualities of a first
class well. It is the only method of
tubing by which drainage of surface
water, cess pools, privies, barn yards,
etc., is successfully prevented from
running into the well. Its cement
tubing is tbe neatest, cheapest and
most lasting ever invented, and gives
no bad taste to the water. Get one
and you will never dispense with it.
