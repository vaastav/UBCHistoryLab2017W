Senator Penrose, so contemptuosly de
cried, has not yet been whipped into
line, as is indicated by his comments
on President Wilson's message to
Congress, which was in thorough ac
cord with the views of Mr. Johnson
and Senator Penrose.
"Notwithstanding the rude shock
which the war gave to the President's
pre-war, semi-free trade views rela
tive to tariff legislation," says Mr.
Mondell, "the reference to that sub
ject in his message curiously illus
trates the tenacity with which he ad
heres to the fallacy that in framing
! tariff Tonat tm c.o t
the RePubUcan leaders, js little give the foreigner abundant access to
..n. ui leam wore is visible when i our markets "
Senator Penrose of Penvlvania i
scoffed at the House Protect Tariff
Bill3 on optical glass, etc., i being
not only of the "pop-gun" viety but
"un-scientific" and requiring writing
before they were fit to be csidered
by the Senate.
"If we want to sell, we ust be
prepared to buy," said the .-'isident
in his message to Congress at the

oii economic life to a-hanged
cond.tion growing out of the'ict that
American business is full gr,vn and
that America is the greates-capital-ist
in the world."
In explaining the commesal sit
uation or the world today, t; Presi
dent said:
"Anything wh ch would toil to pre-
ve.t loieign co.ntries fron settling
uui exports by shinmontf nrfi
into this country could only lave the
oj. preventing them froi paying
tor our exports, and thercore of
preventing the exports froi being
made. The productive f
try, greatly stimulated by he war,
must find an outlet by extorts to
luieign countries, and any Measures
taken to prevent imports wjl inevit
ably curtail exports, force' curtail
ment of production, load thebanking
macninery of the country witl credits
to carry unsold products and.-jroduce
industrial stagnation and uri mploy
ment. One of the most virulent hijjh pro
tectionists cf the country for many
years was Alva B. Johnson of . Phila
delphia, former president of the
Baldwin Locomotive Works. But.'as
as he expressed it at a recent ban
quet in his home city, "the time must
come in the life of every growing
nation when it must realize that con
ditions have changed." Mr. Johnson
pointed out that 't'he United States
since the war has passed from beini;
a debtor nation to being a creditor
nation," and finally abandoned his
high tariff traditions by adding:
"But .a creditor nation cannot af
ford to build a Chinese wall around j
useir and exclude all debtor nations
Its advantage lies in the greatest ---change
of commodities, because for
eign trade, in the last ana'j-is, is
only an exchange of commodities.
1 hear echoes of .-v desire to re
establish protection for American in
dustries. Are we not listening to a
false suggestion? Jlas noi the time
come when the' res ourres of the Unit
ed States are v be found in the
greatest shipm ints of raw material
and manufai . ored goods, and the
;-!! latest it.-ivortation of foreign goods
which we, can consume?"
And Senator Penrose in a newspa
per in-.ervlew agreed with Mr. John
son'sy views, heretofore regarded in
yl P. circles as heretical. This
ov erview -differed materially from
;-. other that Senator Penrose gave,
prior to the opening of the extraor
dinary session of the present Con
gress last spring, when he promised
soecdy tariff revision upward.
"It is the general consenus of busi
ness men all over the United- States
that it is not practical or even de
sirable to begin general tariff revision
in the immediate future," said Pen
rose in commenting on the Johnson
speech. "American industries arr
booming or likely to begin to do so aX
a rapid rate. Most countries are so
depleted in materials and so urgently
in need of replacements that it would
seem that there is abundant pros
pect of commerce and trade for
all."

"pop-gun" bills that his party "boss,"

Thousands of Dollars
for Christmas Club Members
Now being distributed by
American Bank and Trust Co.
863 E. Main St., n3ar Barnum Ave.
Thousands of Dollars
representing the year's savings of the
Christmas Club Members is now being
distributed. This accumulation of
Half Dollars and Dollars represents
the savings of enough persons to peo
ple a small city. The money has been
deposited in a place where it has been
safe against a temptation to break over
a good resolution and spend it. Be
tween now and Christmas a large per
centage of this money will find its way
into the hands of the merchants of our
city.
L
Few Plans of Compulsory Saving
have met with a more ready response
than the Christmas Savings Club of
this bank. Thousands avail themselves
of the opportunity to lay away small
sums regularly. A year ago when it
was announced that the Christmas
Club plan would be continued, our
bank was fairly swamped with the
great number that desired to avail
themselves of the club membership, alt
day and in the evening our banking
rooms were thronged with peopJ
eager to join.
Best Savings Incentive
The Christmas Club Membership it
self proves that it is the very best in
centive to systematic saving, and the
small percentage that have dropped
out during the past year is really very
gratifying.
Should any reader regret that none
of this large accumulation of money
is his, he need not mourn over the
fact, but should realize that he has
another chance coming.
Our Christmas Club for 1920 will
soon be ready for membership, and
will be much larger than the one now
drawing to a close. The best of ac
commodations for handling the de
partment will be afforded during the
coming vear.
