To avoid misnnderstandiof. it may
beproper to say that this proclamation,
so far as it relates to State governments,
has no reference to the States wherein

And for tbe same reason, it may. be
proper to farther say that, whether mem-,

be admitted to their seats constitutionally
rests ' exclusively with "the respective

m
lite, County Scat Question.
We understand that there is a scheme
n foot, in some parts of tbe Connty, le
remove the Connty Seat from Troy to
Wathena. There was a law passed at
the last session of thTLeeisl store, nncfer
which an election for this purpose, 'might
be ordered ; bnt We are opposed. to .the
movement, -and we .think... that a large
majority of-the people of the County are
of the same opinion. A'few years ago.
the people of this, end of.tbe "Cqunty pe
titioned the Legislature , ttiem to
Brown Connty. r, One. of the. principal
reasons for this movement -was, thsV it
would be mr.ch more convenient to go
to the Comty Seat of Brown;. Owing
to tbe distance, and the character' of the
roads, it is impossible for' a person- in
this part 'of tbe Connty to go to Troy,
transact any necessary .business, 'and re
torn home the same day, without so har
rying his basiness'.as to frequently h.ive
it done bringlingly, or leaving some im
portant pert of it nndone, and then trav
elling a good part of .the, homeward jour
ney after night. The trip to Hiawatha
and back can be easily made in a day,
with plenty of'time to transact business.
BaUihe balance of the Connty protested
against the change, and tbe scheme failed.
Tbe size of our County is now lew than
the Constitutional limits, and the change
conld not be made if desired, which we
do not think is the case. .But the people
of this part of the Connty would certainly
be unanimously opposed'to removing the
Connty Seat to a point which would re
quire them to travel eight or nine miles
farther than they now do.
Another objection to the proposition is
the same tkat we nrged against the pro
posed vote on, a Railroad loan. To bold
an election, would cost tho County at
Ieast'8200, and nothing-would be accom
plished at last; for we have no doubt the
proposition would be defeated. Then
there wonld be the additional heavy ex
pense .of County buildings. True, our
present Coanty buildings Are a disgrace
to the County, and were put np at a cost
which will make the tax-payers swear
for a generation, yet to come-; bnt thty
can be made to.anstve.r tbe purpose until
tbe people are nore'able to pay for bet
ter ones. than-at present ; and when that
time does come, the Connty Seat qnes'
tion can bo submitted to them as well as
at this time.), So let the matter, rest for
the present. '" , "

Among tbe many schemes of retrench
ment proposed in onr State, is a reduc
tion of tbe number of members of tbe
Legislature. A reduction of 25 in the
number of members of tbe House is gen
erally proposed, so that it will consist of
50 instead of 75 members ; .while seme
are in favor cf a still greater reduction.
Now; ft will.be utterly impossible to pass
bill making tbe proposed reduction,
until the Constitution, is amended; We
cannot conceive what singular freak came
over the wise men who framed thai- in
strument ; bnt they provided that every
organized Connty should be entitled, to
altepresentatlve, and'tbit tbeTWprCsen
tativs Districts should bs.fefnglo.U
Connty .may organize whenever it con
tains 600 inhabitants.. .Now. what would
be-the effect 1 of redacing the number" of
lRSlsenteUesJo50X-,There.areJn.the
State something ner 40 organized-Conn-.
ties. That would take np 40 of the Rep-;
resentatires, leaving 10 to bo scrambled
for by the larger Counties., Leavenworth"
woold get probably fonr, and , Douglas,
Doniphan, Atchison,, and several pjber
of the larger .Counties, -perhaps 2 apiece.

from 600 trr 1,000 inhabitants, wonld
have half, as much representation as Dong-
las, Doniphan andi Atchison, with 1 their 1
8,000 to 10,000, and 'folly as'-mncb as
Jeffersoh, Johnson, and Mfamvwith their
.4";500"to 5,000." The popnlons. Counties
woqldbear the burdens of Jaxation,
wbile,tbose paying scarcely any" tax at
all wonld' hold the political .powe'r.'
Therefore, we say, it will, be impossible i.
to make tbe proposed redaction, as dong
as the Constitution is in its' present shape;
for tho Representatives of the large Coun
ties will never permit tbe passage of a
law which, while it leaves them the har
dens of taxation, will reduce their repre
sentation to an equality with the least
populous Counties. The demand for re
trenchment js not strong enough to in
duce them to submit to so great an in
justice. Amend that nnjnst and foolish
provision of the Constitntion, so that a
nnmber of the frontier Counties may be
anjtcd m one Representative District.
and population and taxation made, the
basis of Representation, then there will
be no difficulty in reducing the numbers
of the Legislature.

A friend of ours, in a temporary
"pet," not long since, made the flattering
remark that we were " getting to be a
fool on the subject of Jsyhawking."
That reminds ns of a little story.
A few years since, a young man, be
longing to one of tbe most honest and re
spectable families of Southern New York,
emigrated to Kansas? He located on ,a
farm, worked hard, and was a respected
citizen. Several years since, he waa olect
ed to the office of Assessor of Doniphan
Connty. When the war broke, out, ke,
like many others, wss led into the system
of Jayhawkiag, nnder the pretence of ta
kirigfths" property "bf UHloyaT'persont?
As a.mattcr of course, the practice, in
his cue, (being persisted in long after
public opinion Joad condemned it,) fonnd
its proper level, through the grade of pro-
miscapus.hqrje:stealingt.down to highway
robbery. About two weeks ago, .a man
living on Welf River, in Brown County,
took-some produce to- Atchison? wkicb
he sold'for the cash, and rctarned borne,
bnt-was' seen and followed" by the person
oftwhomjWe write, .in .company with
another .notorious thief." Tbey- entered
the man's house early one' evening, drew
their revolvers, and demanded his money
Twoother'men who were stopping there,
left.the house by another door, one arm
ed with a shot gun; and the other with a
revolver, and 'coming around to the front'
I door, rushed in and firedj apon the two
thieves, who immediately fled, bat no
donbt severely wounded,- as they left
marks of blood behind. The thieves left
tbeir hbrsev which fell into the bands, of
the persons they attempted to rob.' For
.some cause, .pursuit wsa.not. mode that
' night, and the, fellows escupsd
Perhaps, if there had been a few more
"fools upon tbe'subjec't of Jiyhawiing,"
this Uwlessness, horse thieving, and
highway robbery would not be 'so preva
lent in Kansas, nor so many once honest
and respectable raon be degraded te' tbe
level of bandits,
A Ksjocr Down Abocmest,, The
Lawrence 1 ribune, speaking of a petition
J in circulation, in that city, askin? the
Senate to reject Delahay's nomination io
the District Judgeship, holds up a fright
ful bnggaboo to prevent its being sent to
Washington. After boa&tingly declar
ing that no Senator can bo got to pre
sent the petition, it says that Delahay is
a particular friend of the President's, and
was his, own choice and appointment
that Lawrence will have some favors to
ask of the Administration ; and is that
the way Io obtain thera, by setting them
selves np against the President's wishes T
Wc thinlqthat if the President, in his
anxiety to give a snng lifo berth to an
incompetent friend," imposes' him upon
the people of Kansas, agains't their 'wish
es, they alipnld. raise, their yojeca, ngainst
it, whether it please or displease him
although we do not anticipate that Dela
hay's rejection wonld cause ihe President
any serious annoyance, unless it might
be from Delabay himself, who would be
siege, him far something, else. Perhaps
if Delahay "and his' friends would go" in a
body'before the Senate, get "down on
their .'knees, and bawl and blubber, it
would melt' the hearts of the. grave Sena
tors, and indnce them to confirm his
nomination. J' - ' l

We see it stated (Sam. Wood says it.
and he pretends te know everything and
the price of it) that our State Treasury
is again empty, and that State Scrip is
down to 65 cents. It was represented.
-sometime during the Summer, that tne
Treasury had been so well supplied by
"the esleof Bonds, that there was no dan
ger of. its again running low, and that
hereafter the State would pay cash in
stead of scrip. But we think it a very
good idea to empty ..the 'Treasury and
run down the scrip, jast abontthe time
tbe Legislature convenes. Many poor
ensses who are so unfortunate as to be
elected to tbVLegisla'ture,'s?a7t off with
barely sufficient funds to defray their.ex
penses to tbe Capital. At the com
mencement of each session, there is usu
ally an appropriation for tke members,
upon which they depsnd to pay their
board and washing bills. Tbey must
have money, and there are certain ones
banging aronad ready 'to buy their scrip
at' a heavy 'discount. These fellows
then.keep posted on the arrival .of Coun
ty Treasurers to settle with tbe State
Treasurer, andgenerally manage rto get
full valoe of their scrip in a very few
days after tbe purchase. How wonld it
- - -
answer for the Legislature to play sharp,
by passing a law, early, in the session,
prohibiting :the Treasurer from paying
ontrmoney,npbri scrip, until 'there was
enough to pay" the members and officers
of the Legislature in full? Aaother prac
tice of these leeches, is to get hold of
Connty Trcasnrers, immediatelyr upon
their arrival, and swap off their scrip to
them for cash, which scrip the Coanty
Treasurers can turn over to tbe State
Treasurer readily, as so ranch money.
That game might also be blocked.

PROSPECTUS FOR 1864.
NOW IS THE TIME TO SUBSCRIBE.
OUtt TERMS.
There is a great deal or talk among oar co
temporaries about the "great rise in the pries
of paper," and the necessity fora corresponding
rise in the price of newsoapers. TTe do not
agree with our friends as to tht last proposition.
It is true that paper has gone up frightfully
fifty per cent, at least, and is "still on iu way
up." But what of thatT Publishcis hava fnr
years had a pood time with low-priced paper.
auuui.iucicproui.'", ami now inai times have
changed they should pay the enhanced price "for
paper without whining, and without attempting
to get it back out of their subscribers. The in.
crease in the price of paper will make a differ
ence 01 tens or thousands or dollars to ns year
ly; but we f hall not increase the price of the
Lcdcxr. That will remain as it is. TTe can af
ford it. The retail price will continue to be fnnr
cents; and our club terms will remain as they
always have been. Onr subscribers hare stuck
to os when paper waa cheap; and we do not In
tend to increase our rates to them now when it
is dear. "Jt is a poor rule that won't work both
ways."
All ourold contributors hare been re-en-ran-cl
for the ensuing year; onr core will b an I.tr..
and will embrace such a varietv ofVminent
talent, that every department of literature will
receive Ihe particular attention of some one
competent to do it ample and special justice.
In fact, our contributors willrend us from week
to week much more matter than we can posii
bly use, so that we shall always hare a fresh and
superabundant supply from which to select thi
vear best. - ,lm
