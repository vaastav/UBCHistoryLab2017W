The Federal Building.
The members of congress repre
senting the district in which Rapid
City is contained, have taken the
initial steps toward securing an ap
propriation for a suitable public
building !o l)e erected in this city,
and about all we can do now is to
patiently .wait the fate of the appro
priation bill, or more particularly
those portions that apply to the much
desired improvement in this commun
ity Already the question of the
building's location has received a
certain amount oi serious consider
ation, which is not entierely out oi
place, with bills in both senate and
house and the prospects bright for
the bill covering internal improve
ments, forming one of the principal
topics for discussion during this ses
sion of the national deliberative body.
In the meanwhile the incoming
throngs will continue to do battle at
the door of the present postoilice,
•with those who have secured their
mail and are making a strenuous en
deavor to get out, the resultant, me
lee very closely resembling a foot
ball scrimmage.
It is safe to say that few of the
towns for whom federal building ap
propriations have been requested
stand more greatly In need of such a
Btructure than Rapid City, especially
when its size, population and ourisflh
1ng condition are taken into consid
eration with the present inadequate
arrangement for the housing of the
government institutions and now tin
means of securing the longed for bet
terment of conditions seems almost
at hand, it will in truth be an un
pleasant pill to swallow should the
present healthy prospects go askew,
'J thereby making the federal building

Tlic lllnck Mills 'Crude.
The rich trade of the Hla tlt Mills
country naturally belongs to Sioux
Falls. Aside from the fact that this
city is the metropolis of the stale
in'which tfle Hills arc- principally sit
uated, the distance between the two
points by rail, now thai dirc: lines
west from Pierre and Ch'tmherlain
have been put in operation, is much
less than the distance from the Mills
to any other important wholesale
city.
Kor many years traffic between this
city and the Hill towns lias been prac
tically impossible on account of the
lack of railway connections. There
was no way of shipping goods except
via Sioux City, Hut all that has been
changed by the railroad building of
the past, year, and there now should
lo nothing in the way of the Hlack
Hills trade coming to Sioux Kails.
Hut there is something in the way,
for the Hills trade is not coming this
way to any noticeable extent, anil no
doubt many are wondering why this
MBS®
st). A Hlack Hills mm has given
tho key. In a recent interview with a
ress reporter he said:
'Krom Sioux Falls to the BlacH
Hills b.v the way of Pierre is 2-10
iles shorter than from either Oma
a or Sioux City to the Hlack Hills.
et the merchants of the Hlack Hills
can go to Omaha without changing
ars and for less money than they
an come to Sioux Kails. To go to
the Hlack Hills at the present time
means 10 stop over one night in llu
o". a««J that adds several hours to nitrating' today
the journey. So long as the present
onditions prevail the merchants of'
the Black Hills will go to Omaha and
Sioux City to buy their goods. Re
uce the expense and the time neces
iiry to make the journey and tliev
will be found ready to buy their
goods in Sioux Falls."
Here is the situation in a nutshell.
With two direct lines of railroad con
necting this city with I lie Hills, and
with a decided advantage over Sioux
City and Omaha in tho way of dis
tance, the trade which of right be
longs to Sioux Falls is going to the
latter cities, simply because of lack of
equitable transportation rates and
train service.
Just why this is so is hard to figure
out, unless theie is a disposition on
the part of the railraod to favor the
Iowa and Nebraska cities. Hut what
ever the cause, the business men of
Sioux Falls should take immediate
tops towards having the defects in
our Hills communications remedied.
There is no valid reason why we
should not have good railway connec
tions with tho 'Hills, and at a cost
proportionate to that, required to
travel from the Hills to Omaha and
Sioux City, distance considered,
which would make the fare ronsid
erably 111 our favor. The Black Hills
trade belongs to Sioux Falls and Sioux
Falls should go after her own it such
vigorous fashion as to bring prompt
and permanent results.—Sioux Falls

Alpine Misadventure.
Among the many sports which in
recent years have been indulged in
only with Increasing peril lo life is
mountain climbing in the Ai.ts. Les
lie Stephen calls tho Alps the "play
ground of Europe," and no lover of
walking and climbing is content un
til he has adventured among them.
Nowhere else are there so many con
veniences for the climber, and no
where else are maps and guidebooks
detalnable In such detail.
Tho very conveniences and advan
tages for climbing, have however,
proved a source of temptation to per
sons with a moderate amount of ex
perience to essay difficult climbs with
out the aid of professional guides
and, Indeed, sometimes such attempts
are made by solitary individuals,
therein seems to lie one of the great
causes of the many accidents.
Official statistics show that this
past season there have been 75 ac
cidents in the Alps resulting in death
and 350 resulting in injuries serious
enough to be registered. The Swiss
and the German clim'bers have con
tributed most of the fatalities th?n
come the English and finally the
Italian. Flower-gathering, especial
ly the search Ifor Edelweiss, has
cauced many deaths, the number in
cluding at least four women who got
in dangerous situations before they
appreciated it and were unable to
make'their way out. Other accidents
have been due to heart failure, and
it is coming to be believed that fre
quent accidents accidents attribute*
to missteps are due to heartfailure
as the result of prolonged exertions
in rarefied air.
There have been two suggestions
made this year for the protection
life—one that Switzerland, France,
Italy. and Austria unite to prohibit
ascents- dangerous places without
the services of registered guides,' and
the other that, medical advice be
made available for climbers in some
of the most frequented regions, and
also at the terminal stations of fun
Icular railroads.
As with other sports that produce
many deaths, it is certain that much
of the danger-may be .removed with'
out materially' spoiling the sport it
self." Efforts to^i that end will con
tinue to be made until the annual
statistics of casuallttes show a change
for the better.-:—Record-Herald.

generations of men. But we think
this is certain: that some way will
be found or evolved for checking the
ravages of alcohol. And we can think
of but three ways.
First, of course, conies the possi
bility of evolving a race, through the
survival of the iiitt.est, which will be
proof against alcohol, as the negro
today is very nearly proof against
the germs of malaria and yellow fe
ver. Unfortunately, while this ,is
possible, it does not seem to us to
In' very probable. The modern worlu
is loo impatient, to wait the gener
'i.'r.s which this would take. We
have already gone about as far on
I hat road as we seem likely to do,
unless uil other means fail. The Eu
lopean peoples suffer very little from
alcohol compared to the ravages
aiming the Indian: and Asiatics.
S'con.il the gradual substitution of
milder alcoholic drinks for the strong
liquors bat are causing nineteen
Iwentieths of the trouble. This rem
edy promises well though it would
take much time. The most temper
ate people today are those of the
wine countries. Hut with the manu
facture of strong liquor so easy and
so cheap, it would take a very heavy
pleasure of public opinion to popular
ize the lighter drinks among people
to the manner born.
There remains the third way of
dealing with the dllliculty prohibi
tion. And it is clear to everyone
thai we are drifting straight In the
direction of this drastic remedy. The
wave motion of all social forces must
be reconed with, of course. Hut it
seems likely that the prohibition wave
will pretty nearly submerge the coun
try before its strength spent, and
v.ho shall say that, if will recede in
our lifetime? Ceiainiy not the

The Trusts arc Alwr.ys with Us.
There was a general agreement
among all the speakers at the recent
trust conference in Chicago that the
combines are hero to stay. This
conclusion is inevitable. Combina
tion is one of the laws of progress.
Wise statesmanship will not fight
combination, but will attempt to
bring it under, governmental surveil
lance. This is what the president
and the republican party arc trying
to do. Several trusts have been at
tacked under the Sherman law, but
this is because they have established
monopolies which are oppressive to
the people. A few combines have
been dissolved by the courts, through
the attacks made up on them by the
department of justice, but the prin
ciple of legitimate combination and
concentration has not been assailed.
In the forty-two years which have
issed since Appomatox the coun
try's entire industrial system has
been transformed. The 35,000 miles
railroad in operation in 1S65 have
increased to 125,000 in 1907. In
S67 steel production in the United
States began, when the country's en
tire production was 19,000 tons.
Along until that time our steel was
all imported. The 19,000 tons of
S67 grew to 569,000 tons in 1877,
to 3,339,000 in 1887, to 7,000,000
in 1897, and it will be in the neigh
borhood of 30,000,000 for 1907. In
907 we are producing about forty
two per cent of the steel output of
the entire world. And practically
half of the United States' product is
furnished by the United States Steel
Corporation.
This law which throws all sorts
of activities into great combinations
and consolidations operates all over
tho world, and legislators should at
tempt to regulate it and not to over
throw It. We have carried out the
principle of concentration a little far
ther than has any other country.
This is owing to our greater natural
resources, to our larger abundance
of capital, and to our recognition of
the fact that the principle, rightly
regulated, produces economies which
benefit the people. The republican
party's anti-trust statute and anti
trust crusade in the courts aim to
dtvest the trusts of their oppressive
features and bring them under the
surveillance of the law. In that en
deavor the republicans are meeting
with a fair amount of success.

Our Navy Stands Second.
Secretary Metcalfe's annual report
shows, what the country had learned
before from foreign sources, that the
Jnited States stands second in naval
power among the nations. This is
the relative rank of the nations as
Mr. Metcalfe puts it: Great Britain
the United States, France, Germany,
Japan, Russia, Italy, Austria. In
lonnage, however, the United States
having 611,000 as compared with
1,633,000 for Great Britain, we are
far below that country, although
standing nearest to it on the roll
pan, which is fifth in navai
strength, has a tonnage of 374,000
or considerably more than half oi
ours.
But the United States will soon
lose its present position unless we
build more vessels than are on our
present program. As soon as the
craft now building are completed
France will pass us and resume the
second place, which she held for
many years. Germany, too, will pull
up closer to us than she is now when
all our vessels and hers that are be
ing constructed are placed in com
mission. Likewise, Japan is making
hi£ efforts to take a step upward in
the scale, and she is likely to make
a hard contest for supremacy in the
Pacific in the coming few years. Mr.
Metcalfe calls congress' attention to
the necessity of building many more
.vessels, than it ordered in last win
ter's session. He presents a pro
gram of tj»e varioup sorts of fighting
craft which need to' be strengthened,
and his recommendations ought to
get some attention from congress.
An our big fleet will start, in a few
li.vs on its cruise down the Atlantic
and up the Pacific, this question of
an increase in the country's naval
!Kwer becomes
a
very live issue.
When fighting comes next for us it
is much more likely to be in t'ie'
Pacific than it is in the Atlan .]
Everything in our relations with Ja-I
pan is satisfactory at present, and I
is likely to continue so for a few
years more at least, but we need a
powerful fleet always in the Pacific,
and in order to get this we must
build many more vessels than iwe
have now- in commission. A large
part of the fleet which will start in
a few days on the cruise to the Pa
cific will remain there permanently.
The country will insist on this. The
naval committees of the senate and
house have some interesting work
cut out for them in the present ses
sion.— Globe-Democrat.

I!ef. re Hi vci' Went her Comes—It
Would Save $10,000 ill This
State.
The following letter from the state
fire marshal of South Dakota, warn
ing the people of the state against
defective chimneys, has been re
ceived by The Journal:
Pierre, S. D., Dec. 5.
In the agricultural states in whicn
records of all fire losses are kept
the loss from neglected flues is, in
the average year, $106,000 per mil
lion population. So the waste in
South Dakota from this cause is at
least $50,000 per annum.
If each householder should in
spect his chimneys before severe
weather arrives, and remedy defects
in them, that amount wo'uld lie re
duced at least $40,000. Why not
protect your property and its oc
cupants by devoting ten minutes'
time to this commonest of all fire
dangers?
Fires from defective chimneys
usually being in the attic, get a good
start, in the dryest of wood before
the alarm! is raised. Attics being
difficult of access one with a
water bucket, the fire is likely to
get beyond control.
Defects Possible.
The settling of its foundation may
open a crevice between the bricks or
stones so that sparks can escape.
Sometimes a new chimney In set
tling forms a crack because one side
of it is held by floor timbers.
A chimney built up from joists or
a bracket is always a source of dan
ger, because of the liability of cracks
from springing of the timbers. Chim
neys so built often have as their
base a plank whose only protection
from sparks and heat is a layer of
mortar on It. Many fires result
from this practice.
Salmon-tinted bricks disintegrate.
Poor mortar crumbles out, leaving
openings. Nails driven into brick
chimneys are likely to come out,
leaving holes. A joist end should
not rest in a chimney wall. Tile
chimneys of ail sorts are unsafe be
cause they are very likely to crack
ofT at the level of the roof where I
cold air strikes them. A hood should
make no offset to hold soot. The
chimney top should ije inspected aad
soot swept down and removed from
below.
The Stovepipe.
A stovepipe must be cleaned. Jar
ring the soot out is not enough a
scraper should be used inside it to
remove scales. Then it should be
inspected section by section for rust
holes which might permit sparks to
fly outward instead of upward,
There is a widespread impression
that the job gf stovepipe cleaning
hould be approached with calmness,
fortitude and resolution. But for
the fact that Job, the great exemplar
of patience, was a tent-dweller, one
might think he referred to stove
pipe cleaning when he said: "Yet
man is born unto trouble as the
sparks fly upwards." See that the
pipe when up is spark-tight through
out and is not pushed into the flue
so as to choke it.
The Elbow.
An elbow in a stovepipe lessens
the liability of particles of kindling
or fuel bfiirg drawu frum the ehiin
ney top and alighting still re I hit
on the shingles. If such sparks are
given elbow room they are lik^l/ to
bump in making the turn, and fall
harmless. While a fire is burning
the
Air
in a chimney travels up at
ihe rate of three to six feet a sec
ond, Unplugged and vag-lllled stove
pipe holes cause some fires.
A stovepipe should not pass where
it cannot be seen, as through a lain
and plaster partition, or through an
attic or unused room, because open
ings in it may occur from rust or
the parting of a seam or joint. And,
too, in such situation the stovepipe
becomes covered with a fluff whicu
is liable to Ignite. Neither should a
pipe pass through roof, window or
siding, even of a summer kitchen,'for
it is liable to become red-hot.
No flue should be smaller than
6 by 8 inches, which is the length
of a brick. If any green wood is
used it should be 8 by 12 inches,
a
fireplace chimney must have at least
one-tenth the area of the fireplace
it serves.
The effective way to deal with this
enormpus loss from defective flues
Is through a state building law simi
lar to that of North Carolina, whicn
controls the building of chimneys
and many other details of architec
ture. This would cure the evil in
fifty years. Frank A. Craft,
State Fire Marshal.
