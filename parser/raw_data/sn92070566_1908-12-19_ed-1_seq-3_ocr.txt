ment on the life of Mrs. Dille
who died here a few weeks ago.
In her youth she tiuited with

noble, her energies spent in de
ference and futherance of that
which is true and good. Her
sympathies were ever w ith the
poor and suffering humanity.
The exnerienced the highest,
purest happiness, by learning
Christ, in sick rooms, in rocking
nain und anxietv. amid trials
and distresses, and at the open
sr&vpB. until she became pas
siv in lir Father's hands, bav
ins tin nixnifo of her OWU. but
was willing to be used of God in
loving services.

Mr. Lincoln, because ho lacks
the balance, the equipoise, the
bigness of heart, the greatness
of soul which characterized Mr.
Lincoln: but nevertheless Mr.
Koosevelt has been, is now, and
will forever be regarded, one ot
