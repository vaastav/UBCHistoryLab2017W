THE PRESIDENT'S
ANNUAL MESSAGE.
It is Submitted to Both Houses of Con
? gress.
REYIEW OF EVENTS OF YEAR.
The Message Opens With a Congratulatory
Paragraph, And Is An Able Review of
Events That Have Transpired Dur
iug The Past Year in Which
Our (iovernment Is
Interested.
President McKinley's annual message,
pent to Congress on Monday, the 3rd ?net.,
is too long to admit of publication in our
columns. It is an able review o! all ques?
tions and ?vente that affect the interests
of this country that have occurred during
the past year. In part, it is as follows:
"l'o the Senate and House, of Represen?
tatives:
?'At the outgoing of the old and the in?
coming of the new century you begin the
last session of the Fifty-sixth Congress
with evidences on every hand of individ?
ual and national prosperity and with
proof of the growing strength and increas?
ing power for good of Republican institu?
tions. Your countrymen will join with
you in felicitation that American liberty
is more firmly established than ever be?
fore, and that love for it and the deter?
mination to preserve it are more univer?
sal than at any former perioi of our his?
tory.
"The republic was never so strong, be?
cause never so strongly intrenched in the
hearts of the people as now. The consti?
tution with few amendments, existe as it
lei t I ht hands of its authors. The addi?
tions which have been made to it proclaim
larger freedom and more extended citizen?
ship. Popular government has demon?
strated in its one hundred and twenty-four
years of trial here its stability and security
and its efficiency as the best instrument
of national development und the beet safe?
guard toTiuman rights.
When the Sixth OoagW assembled in
November, 1S00, the population of the
United States was 5,908,483. It is now
76,304,799. Then we had sixteen States.
Now we have forty-live. Then our terri?
tory consisted of 909,001) square miles. It
ie now 3,846,595 ?quera unies. Education,
religion, and morality have kept pace with
our advancement in other directions, and
while extending its power the government
has adhered to its Inundation principles,
abated none of them in dealing with our
new peoples and poraoarioM, "A nation
bo preserved and blessed gives reverent
thanks to God and invokes His guidance
and the continuance of 11 is care and fa?
vor.
INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.
Speaking on this subject the President
Bays :
"It is with satisfaction that I am able to
announce the formal notification at The
Hague, on September 4, of the deposit of
ratifications of the Convention of the Pa?
cific Settlement of International Disputes
by eixteen Powers, namely, the United
States, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Eng?
land, France, Germany, Italy, Persia,
Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Siam, Spain,
Sweden, and Norway, and the Nether?
lands. Japan has also since ratified the
Convention."
CHINESE PROBLEM.
The President say? that : "In our for?
eign intercourse the dominant question
has been the treatment of the Chinese
problem. Apart from this our relations
with the powers have been happy." He
then proceeds to give a lengthy detail of
the troubles in China, the cause of their
origin, how our Government has treated
the question, all the while working for a
policy of peace and the preservation of the
integrity of the Chinese Empire.
"The matter of indemnity for our
wronged citizens is-a question of grave
concern. Measured in money alone, a
sufficient reparation may prove to be be?
yond the ability of Chins, to meet. All
the powers concur in emphatic disclaimers
of any purpose of aggrandizement through
the dismemberment of the empire. I am
disposed to think that due compensation
may be made in part bv increased guaran?
tees of security for foreign rights and im?
munities, and, most important of all, by
the opening of China to the equal com?
merce of all the world. These views have
been and will be earnestly advocated by
our representatives."
NICARAtil'A i ANAL.
On this important question the President
says :
"The all-importaut matter of an inter
oceanic canal has assumed a new phase.
Adhering to its refusal to re-open the
question of the forfeiture of the contract of
the Maritime Canal Company, which was
terminated for ittege I no-nexecution in
October, 1899, the Qoverameat of Nica?
ragua has since supplemented that action
by declaring the so-styled Kyre-Cragin op?
tion void for nonpayment of the stipulated
advance. ? Protests in relation to these
acts have been tiled in the State Depar.
ment and are under co-isideration. Deem?
ing itself relieved from existing engage?
ments, the Nicaragir-'.n (iovernment shows
a disposition to deal fi eely with the canal
question either in the way of negotiations
with the United States or by taking meas?
ures to promote the waterway.
f "Overtures for a convention to effect the
building of a canal under the auspices of
the United States are umler consideration.
In the meantime, the views of the Con
gresE upon the general subject, in the light
of the report of the Commission appointed
to examine the comparative merits of the
various trans-Istbmian ship-canal projects,
may be awaited.
"I commend to the early attention of
the 8enate Hie Convention with Great
Btilain to facilitate th? construction of
auch a canal and to remove auy objection
which might arise out of the Conventio
o mmonly called the Clayton-Rubve
Treaty."
FINANCIAL ACT OK 1900.
On the financial qneetiou, the Pr?sider
in patt says :
"The beneficial effect of the financial ac
of WOO, so far as it relates to a modifica
tion of the national banking act, is airead
apparent. The provision for the incorpoi
ation of national banks with a capital?
not lo- than $25,000 in places not exceed
ins. three thousand inhabitants has result
ed in the extension of banking facilities t<
main small communities hitherto unabl
to provide themselves with banking insti
tutions under the national system. Ther
we.e organized from the enactment of tin
law up to and including November 30, 30!
national banks, of which 206 were will
capital less than $50,000, and 103 witl
capital of 150,000 or more.
"It is worthy of mention that the great
er number of banks being organized undei
the new law are in sections where the neec
of banking facilities has been most pro
nounced. Iowa stands first, with 30 banki
of the smaller class, while Texas, Okla
homa, Indian Territory, and the middle
and western sections of the country have
also availed themselves largely of the priv
ilegee under the new law.
"A large increase in national-bank-note
circulation has resulted from the provision
of the act which permite national banks to
issue circulating notes to the par value ol
the United States bonds deposited as se
entity instead of only 90 per cent, thereof,
as heretofore. The increaee in circulatinn
notes from March 14 to November 30 it
$77,889.570."
MERCHANT MARINE.
On this question he says:
"I am satisfied the judgment of the
country favors the policy of aid to our
merchant marine, which will broaden our
commerce and markets and upbuild our
sea-carrying capacity for the products of
agriculture and manufacture, which, with
the increase of our navy, mean more work
and wagea to our countrymen, as well as a
?aftguard to American interests in every
part of the world."
TRUSTS.
"In my last annual message to the Con
gn ss I called attention to the necessity
for early action to remedy such evils as
might be found to exist in connection with
combinations of capital organized into
trusts, and again invite attention to my
discussion of the subject at that time,
which concluded with these words:
'it is apparent that uniformity of legis?
lation upon this subject in the several
States is much to be desired. It is to be
hoped that such uniformity, founded in a
?rise and just discrimination between what
is injurious and what is useful and neces?
sary m business operations, may be ob?
tain"!, and that means may be found for
the v-mgress, within the limitations of
its constitutional power, so to supplement
an eil.t.ve code of State legislation as to
make a complete system of laws through?
out the United States adequate to compel
a genera! observance of the salutary rules
to winch I have referred.
"The whole question is so important
and far-reaching that I am sure no part
of it will be lightly considered, but every
phase of it will have the studied delibera?
tion of the Congress, resulting in wise and
judicious action."
"Restraint upon Euch combinations as
are injurious, and which are within Feder?
al jurisdiction, should be promptly ap?
plied by the Congress."
The President refers to the remarkable
growth of our trade with foreign countries,
stating that our exports were greater this
year than ever before, this obtained in
both manufactured articles and agricultur
al products.
THE PHILIPPINES.
The message treats the Philippine ques?
tion briefly but forcibly. He says that in
a former meiBPge "I 6tated my purpose
until Congress shall have made known the
formal expressions of its will, to use the
authority vested in me by the Constitution
and the statutes to uphold the sovereignty
of the United States in those distant
islands as in all other places where our
flag rightfully floats. * * * I have
steadfastly bo declared."
THE ARMY.
The President states that we require a
regular army of 60,000 men; and that dur?
ing the continuance of the troubles in
Cuba and the Philippines the President
should have authority to increase the pres?
ent force to 100,000, of which force 15,000
should be native troops raised in the PI il
ippines.
He recommends the laying of a cable
from the Pacific coast to Manila, via Ha?
waii.
lie approves of the recommendations of
the ft i-retary of the Navy for building
ne*, vessels and otherwise strengthening
our Navy.
He states Uiat "there has been marked
? in the educational, agricultural
and railroad development of the islands of
Hawaii."
Tiie message is an elaborate and clear
prest utatiea of all questions that required
notice at the hands of the President, and
i .ing very favorable notice frorx the
press and public.
20.C1 (I BRITISH TO WHIP 7000 BOERS.
Winston Churchill Thinks This Number
of Extra Regular Troops Is Needed
in Africa.
Queenslown, Dec. 2.?Winston Spencer
Churchill, who sailed from Liverpool yes?
terday fot New York, said in the com se
of an interview here that his sojourn in
the United States would be short, as be
must hurry back to his Parlirmentary
duties.
When questioned with regard to the
war in South Africa, he suid he agreed
with l>ord Roberts, that 20,000 more regu?
lars should be sent out, because any slack?
ening would only revive the spirits of the
Boers. He estimated the Boer forces at
present to be about 7000.

Berlin, December 4.?A dispatch from
Field Marshal Count Von Wahlersee.
dated Pekin, Monday, December 3, says
a considerable force of Chinese regulars
have taken up a position at Bang Chou,
ninety-five kilometres southward of Tien
Tsin and that two detachments of troops
from the Tien Tsin command, under Colo?
nel Lorscheldt and Major Falkenhayn,
are proceeding against the Chinese.
Dr. Mumm Von Schwartzenstein, the
German minister to China, cables that he
has received a-conciliatory dispatch from
Yuan Shi Kai [the military governor of
the province of Shan Tung], assuming full
responsibility for the safety of Bishop An
zei, who is about to proceed to Tsi Nan
Fu, to confer with Yuan Shi Kai.
London, December 4.?A special dis?
patch from Nan Kow Pas, dated Novem?
ber 30, says the Kalgan expedition was
ineffective, the Chinese evading all at?
tempts to engage them. The towns en
route were occupied unopposed, and some
tolls ot skins and silver were levied. The
cavalry captured the baggage of the re?
treating Chinese force at Swen Hwa Fu,
killed thirty of its guards and secured
20,000 taels.
Three mandarins who were instigators
of the massacre of oonvertB at Tsi Ming
and twenty-three Boxers were executed,
hut the Germans generally ignored evi?
dences of anti-foreign activity.
There are continuous disturbances in
the interior, where the dispatch adds a
had impr. ssion has been made by the ex?
cessive withdrawal of foreign troops and
the complacence of the allies. The mis?
sionaries anticipate a recurrence of the
outrages.
Ambassador Choate had a long conver?
sation with the Secretary of Foreign Af?
faire today, in which the proposed alter?
natives and amendments in Secretary
Hays recent note and the notes of the
other powers were fully discussed. Noth?
ing definite was arrived at. Lord Lans
downe showed the most friendly spirit.
Mr. Choate is notifying Secretary Hay of
Lord Lansdowne's views. Further con?
sultations will follow shortly.
Shanghai, December 4.?The Yang-tee
viceroyB, who are masters of the situation,
gave Vice-Admiral Seymour satisfactory
assurances of their future policy, on the
occasion of his recent visit to these offi?
cials.
Tien Tsin, Monday, December 3.?Tang
Wen Huan. the author of the outrages
upon the Pao Ting Fu missionaries, ar?
rived today and was paraded through the
Victoria road in a cart under a strong Ger?
man guard, previous to being handed over
to the provisional government for decapi
i tat ion.
Shanghai, December 4.?It is reported
in Tien Tsin that the Germans lost twenty
killed and many wounded west of Pao
Ting Fu, where they were attacked by
twenty-five hundred Boxers.

Milford, N. H., Dec. 2.?Mre. Mary A.
Lull, widow of Colonel Lull, of th's town,
left for Corsicana, Texas, today on her
errand to deliver to the United Daughters
of the Confederacy a flag, the distinguish?
ing mark of which is a lone star, captured
in the charge of the Eighth New Hamp?
shire Volunteers on Fort Hudson, La.,
May 27, 1863.
This is the regiment that Lieutenant
Colonel Lull commanded, and he sent the
flag home as a souvenir of that fight. He
later was killed*.
Recently Mrs. Lull wrote to the Texat
Division, United Daughters of the Con'
federacy, and offered to turn over to them
the flag for identification. The offer wat
accepted, and the invitation to attend 8
Reunion of the Daughters, at Corsicana,
December 4th was extended and accepted.

KRUGER WONT GO TO BERLIN.
He Abandons the Trip Because the Kais?
er's Plans Do Not Admit of His
Reception.
Berlin, Dec. 2.?Mr. Kruger has aban?
doned bis proposed visit to Berlin owing
to the receipt of an official intimation that
Emperor William regrets that in conee
quence of previous arrangements he will
be unable to receive him.
The Boer statesman will therefore pro?
ceed direct from Cologne to Holland. He
telegraphed to this effect this afternoon.
The Cologne "Gazette," in an inspired
article, says:?
"Mr. Kruger's visit is not agreeable to
Germany, his aim being to obtain inter?
vention in South Africa. It would be a
grave political mistake, it would be even
a great crime, to allow him to entertain
even a spark of hope that Germany will
render him any practical support."
This declaration is accompanied wih
reproaches, Mr. Kruger being charged
with "having encouraged a useless guer?
rilla warfare and having disregarded Be?
many's advice when he might still have
followed it." x
The press generally strikes the same
note.
Cologne, Dec. 2.?Thousands of people
waited today in the vicinity of the Ca?
thedral Hotel to catch a glimpse of Mr
Kruger, who, when replying to the depu
talion of Bonn etudente in the afternoon,
described the educational progress of the j
Transvaal, thanked the students for then
kind welcome and shook hands with each.
.' fterward he appeared upon the bal?
cony, where he was loudly cheered Irom
below.
Having rested for half an hour he went
into the vestibule of the hotel, which was
crowded with visitors.
It is expected that Mr. Kruger will n
main here until Wednesday.

Newport News Harbor Improvement
Plans Hailed With Joy
Newport News, Va., Dec. 3.?The an?
nouncement that the river and harbor
committee of the house has decided to in?
clude in its appropriation bill an item of
$225,000 for the dredging of Newport
News middle ground bar to a depth of
thirty feet at extreme low tide is received
with a great deal of satisfaction by the
shipping and shipbuilding interests here
Inside of the bar the harbor ranges in
depth from fifty to sixty-six feet.
This will be the first appropriation ever
made for work on Newport News harbor,
and it will result in material increase in
the port's business, as the largest ships
can then go out fully loaded day or night,
no matter what the tide. Norfolk gets an
appropriation of $195,000.

EITHER ROUTE
FOR CANAL OPEN.
Treaty Concluded With Nicaragua?
Exclnsive Right.

As Compensation Nicaragua is to Receive
a Certain Amount, Probably $5,000, ?

Same Rights Over the
Panama Route.
Washington, Dec. 1.?Secretary Hay
this morning, for the Government of the
United States, and Se?or Corea, the Nica
raguan minister for his own Government,
signed a treaty whereby the latter Gov?
ernment concedes to the Government of
the United States the necessary ridit? and
privileges within her bestowal for the con?
struction of the Nicaraguan canal.
This action is taken in anticipation of
Congressional action upon the pending
Nicaraguan bill and the Hay-Pauncefdrte
treaty. Pending the submission of the
document to the Senate, which body must
ratify the agreement, its terms will not be
made public.
EXCLUSIVE RIOIIT.
It is understood, however, that general?
ly Nicaragua grants to the United States
Government the exclusive right to con?
struct and operate the canal between the
Atlantic and Pacific across Nicaragua, in?
cluding the the free use of the San Juan
River and of Lake Managua, as part of
tha watercourse. Nicaragua ia also to rid
herself of any outstanding treaties that
would tend in any way to abridge the
privileges to be acquired by the United
States.
It is understood also that Nicaragua con?
cedes to the United States full authority
to police the canal.
THK t'ONl'ENSATION.
Nicaragua is to receive in compensation
a certain amount of the securities of the
canal construction company, and, although
it is not possible now to learn the figure
set down in the treaty, it is believed to
approximate $5,000,000.
The State Department Ihas already en?
tered into an agreement on similar lines
with the Republic of Copta Kica. This
was because Costa Rica has established a
claim to the right hank of the San Juan
River, which must of necessity form aboi t
a third of the length of the canal, should
tlit Nicaraguan route be selected and be
constructed on the unes which will be sug?
gested by the Walker Commission.
An understanding has been arrived at
with the United States of Colombia cov?
ering the same rights and privileges for
the Panama route as are conveyed by
Nicaragua and Costa Rica, in the caue of
the Nicaragua route. So the State Deoart
ment now has cleared the way for such
action as Congress may care to take in the
case of either of the (?nal routes which
have been found feasible.

Washington, Dec. 1.?The State De?
partment today sent instructions to United

on account of the'murder of Marcus E.
Zagui, a naturalized American citizen,
who whs killed in June, 1900.

that purpose, will convey the Consul from
Tangiers to Mazagan, which is the nearest
port to Fez the capital of Morocco.

The Machine Democrats have been
looking nervous since the exposure oftbat

do their duty the men who planned such

to the penitentiary.
The question now with the Virginia
Democracy is, what to do with their Con?

that the Machine is inclined to opposs re?
stricted suffrage. The Machine does not
want to fix suffrage so there will be no
votes to steal. That would leave it without
an occupation.
The Southern Democrats pretend to be
very confident that no successful tffort
will be made to cut down the representa?

is very plain where suffrage baa bean re?

It is authoritatively announced that
General Walker will make a contest for
the seat in Congress obtained by W. F.

his party was in the minority, and that
his election could not be secured, except
