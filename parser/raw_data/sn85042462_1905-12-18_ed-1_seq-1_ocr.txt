LITTLE WORK IN SENATE
Nothing of, Importance Expected Be-
fore Christmas Holidays
By Associated Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.— The senat*
will meet the wishes of the house for
an adjournment for the Christmas holi
days on Thursday next. Meantime
the senate will probably content itseli
with comparatively little work unless
there should be difficulty in agreeing
with the house on the terms of the
Panama canal emergency appropria
tion bill. That measure will go to a
conference committee early In tho week
and there will be united effort to reach
a conclusion before the holiday ad
journment. The action of the senate
in attempting to eliminate the bond
provision and make a separate law of
it will probably be the principal bone
of contention in the conference com
mittee.
The 'reorganization of the senate
committee will be announced Monday
or Tuesday. Senator Galllnger will
make an effort during the week to
have tho merchant marine bill made
the unfinished business, not with a
view of securing serious consideration
of it before Christmas, but . with the
end In view of having it in position to
be pressed when congress reconvenes.

ALLEGED FORGER FROM
SHANGHAI IS ARRESTED
ARRIVES IN SAN FRANCISCO ON
BTEAMER KOREA
Young Man Is Ernest F. Horwitz and
He Has Been Representing a Fili.

clares He Is Innocent of Crime
By Associated Press.
SAN FRANCISCO, Doc. 17.— When
the steamer Korea arrived from the
Orient today the police arrested one of
the passengers, a young man who had
been traveling under the name of
Charles Ferguson. He later admitted
that he was Ernest B. Horwltz, recently
of Shanghai.
The arrest was made on a cablegram
from American Consul Genornl Rodgers
at Shanghai, China, that Horwitz was
wanted there on a charge of forgery.
He was accused of forging a check for
9780 taels on the Hongkong and Shang
hai bank of Shanghai,
He denied having committed forgery,
but admits he did something to spite
his brother-in-law In Shanghai.
He would not say what this was, but
declared it was not forgery.
He said he had been promised a
cargo of goods from a Chinese mer
chant in Shanghai, which he was to
take to Russia, and his brother-in-law
had agreed to become his surety, but
at the last moment backed out and
destroyed his credit. He left Shanghai
about three months ago and had been
traveling in Japan, buying and selling
goods.

WITTE'S RESIGNATION NEAR
May Be Succeeded by Count Alexis
Ignatieff
By Associated Presn.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 17, 7:30 p.
m.— A report that Count "Wltte has re
signed is In circulation, but It is false.
It may,, however, become true at any
moment and Gen. Count Alexis Igna
tieff is being held in reserve.
A close friend of the premier tells the
Associated Press that Count Wltte had
no faith In the policy of Minister of the
Interior Durnovo and only consented to
it on condition that It should be con
fined to legal means. The same in
formant sayß that an official communi
cation declaring a resort to legal meas
ures to be the policy of tbe govern
ment will be Issued tomorrow. It is
the opinion of many Liberals as well
as revolutionaries that "with the first
discharge of cannon Count Wltte will
go." They say It matters little whether
the premier is or is not in sympathy
with, the policy of reaction, he cannot
shirk responsibility for it. A prominent
personage said to the Associated Press:
"The step toward reaction marks the
beginning of the end and the policy
which has been inaugurated is bound
to fail.
"The government's task will not be
merely the arreßt of a small group of
leaders, but that of the whole popula
tion, jrhe powers conferred on the
provincial authorities by the imperial
ukase is tantamount to a declaration of
martial law throughout the country and
the irresponsible repression which the
officers of the old regime will be sure
to commit when let loose can only serve
to fan the flames."
The Russ expects to come out tomor
row under its old franchise as the
Molva, meaning "Fame."
News from the interior tonight Is
very Berlous. The revolt in the Baltic
has ppread southward to the province
of Kovno, on the border of Poland
which belongs to the old kingdom of
Lithuania. The rebellion In Kursk is
beyond control and the government has
Information that a big uprising is in
course of preparation in the Ural re
gions.
An officer who has Just returned from
Manchuria told the Associated Press
that a spirit of mutiny prevailed among
a large portion of the army and that

saturated with revolutionary Ideas by
agitators during their captivity and
were ripe for open rebellion. >;

FRANCE TO HAVE
NEW PRESIDENT
SUCCESSOR TO LOUBET TO
BE CHOSEN SOON
There Are a Number of Candidates,
of Whom Fallleres, Doumer and
Bourgeois Are Most
Prominent
Special Cable to The Herald.
PARIS, Dec. 17.— 1n a little more than
a month the national assembly will
meet at Versailles to elect a successor
to Loubet an president of France, and
for the first time In the history of the
republic the spectacle will be offered of
two living presidents, one still In power
und the other duly elected to succeed
him and surrounded by all the prestige
to which his election entitles him.
Of candidates for this prominent of
fice, three arc foremost In public opin
ion — Falllercs, president of the senate;
Doumer. president of the lower cham
ber, and Leon Bourgeois, at one time
minister of finance.
Notwithstanding the boom started In
the foreign press in favor of Fallleres,
It Is tho general opinion here that
Doumer has the best chance. He Is
compared to Roosevelt as a statesman
and, like the American president, has
written a book of his experience while
governor general of Indo-Chlna and en-
Joys above all diversions a ride on
horseback.
DECLARES MUNICIPAL
OWNERSHIP A DREAM
SPEAKER SEES NO LIKELIHOOD
OF CONSUMMATION
Osborn Tells Hearers Carter Harrison
and Mayor Dunne Were Elected on
Impossible Platform and Says Vis.
ionaries Will Be Disappointed
"The collective ownership and opera
tion of all the materiul instruments of
production is what we want, and a
great many people tell us that this can
never be brought about," said J. B.
Osborn in addressing an audience
largely composed of Socialists in Metro
politan hall last night. "People claim
that there Is not money enough In the
world to buy these means of produc
tion, and that to take them without
paying for them would be unlawful,
unjust ami unconstitutional.' It FPoms
In me" that It would be quite Impossible
with the present money system for
society to acquire the means of pro
duction and pay for them. Take the
question of municipal ownership of pub
lic utilities and we will suppose that
Kan Francisco, New York, Boston, Chi
cago; St. Louis and other large cities
would at about the same time want to
sell municipal bonds for the purpose
of taking over from private ownership
the property of municipal corporations.
The amount of money would be so
enormous that It would be almost Im
possible to obtain it. And In no case
could it be obtained without the con
sent of the capitalist class, and they
would not consent unless they were
thoroughly satisfied that
ownership of public utilities was in
their interest and tho the interest of
capitalistic property.
"Seven years ago the city of Denver
issued $9,000,000 worth of bonds for the
purpose of acquiring the Denver Union
Water company's plant, but the capi
talists did not buy the bonds and the
water company is still private prop
erty.
"Carter Harrison was elected mayor
of Chicago on a municipal ownership
platform and at the end of his admin
istration that platform had not been
accomplished.
"Mayor Dunne was elected on the
same kind of a platform, and In my
opinion, at the close of his official ad
ministration, Chicago will not have
municipal ownership of the street rail
roads, etc.
"Property has only one value, and
that is Its profit earning or dividend
paying capacity, and no political party
representing the capitalist class is go
ing to enforce any law or program that
will destroy the value of capitalist prop
erty. Many state constitutions have this
language: 'The law of eminent domain
shall never be abridged or so construed
as to . prevent the legislature from
taking the property and franchises of
incorporated companies, and subjecting
them to public use.'
"Every state, according to law, has
a right to regulate the fares and
ft eights of railroad corporations, tele
phone, telegraph and express com
panies.
"But this principle of law Is not en
forced In any city or state in the Union.
I mi convinced, beyond all doubt, that
the law is today and has been through
all history, the rule of the dominant
class in society. What Is In the Interest
of tho ruling class is lawful, moral and
Just, and anything opposed to their in
terest is unlawful, immoral and uncon
stitutional."

tigatlon
By Associated Press.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 17.— The last
small gap of the wnter front facing
Sacrumento was closed today by a line
of track laid by a large force of Sun
day track builders employed by the Sac
ramento Southern railroad, a corpora
tion, connected with the Southern
Pacific company, in the face of the ob
struction in the shape of a feme and
the strenuous objections of F. A. Miller,
who claims the land upon which the
levee stand?. The Rap was 450 feet
wide, and Mr. Miller had been dicker
ing to sell his land to the Western
Pacific railroad for a freight depot on
the water front. He asserts that the
move was made by the Southern Pacific
company to prevent the Western Pa
cific from getting to the river in or near
this city.
The city officials knew nothing of the
building of the ne- • track until It was
finished, and as far ns any of them
know the railroad company had no
legal right to build upon the levee.
The land on which the track was
built Is outside the city limits and is
owned by private parties, who gave or
sold the city an casement for levee pur
poses.
It Is upon this easement that the
track was built. Clinton L. White, one
of the foremost lawyers in the city and
b. recognized authority on titles to water
front property, holds that the title to
the land Is vested In the owner and
that the city has a levee there by
sufferance only. . * . . ;; ■
Miller, owner of the property, built a
fouoe ."aerews • the levee,' which ■ was
butted down by tho construction engltio.
He laid a complaint with Division Su
perintendent T. R. Jones of the South
ern Pacific company, which was about
as successful as the fence.
It being Sunday and the court house
closed Miller did not apply for an in
junction, so the track was completed.
It Is likely that the city board of
trustees will Investigate the matter to
morrow night.
STEALS WATCH; MISSES $300
Man Falls Asleep on Grass Plot — Pick.
pockets Take Valuable Gift but
Fall to Find Treasure
While asleep on the lawn of tho Ar
cade depot lato yesterday afternoon,
Klton Pendleton of Santa Monica was
robbed of a valuable sold watch J but
the thief overlooked $300 In the man's
vest pocket just above the watch. Pen
dleton was partially awakened and
thought he felt his watch being taken.
Following behind an unidentified
man, Pendleton staggered for nearly a
half block crying in a thick voice that
the stranger had just relieved him of a
valuable . watch. Pendleton nnd the
stranger were arrested by Patrolman
Block and sent to the central station In
charge of Patrolman Craig for investi
gation.
Pendleton says he had been drugged
early in the day nn<i In a semi-conscious
condition had wandered to the Arcade
depot, where he fell oil the grans. Sev
eral hours later he was awakened b^
the stranger, who was bending over
him and extracting a watch from his
pocket. The Santa Monica man claimed
that he saw a stranger tuke the
watch and pass It to another man.
Think Pendleton Mistaken
Pendleton says that after the robber
had taken his watch and given it to a
companion the second party disap
peared nnd the robber coolly walked
away. It was then that the Santn
Monica man claims to have realized
what was taking place and at once be
gan to follow the accused man.
According to witnesses, a small crowd
whs soon attracted by tho orleß of the
man, whom they supposed to be Intoxi
cated, following a well dressed man nc
cuslng him of stealing a watch. The
supposed robber did not attempt to
flee, but walked toward a patrolman.
He submitted to arrest and later, when
questioned by the detectives, told n
story the officers were inclined to be
lieve. ...,.
' One of tho queer features of the case
was that Pendleton carried $300 In cur
rency in an outside vest pocket and the
money wns not taken. This added to
the fact that the supposed pickpocket
proved that he was In the employ of
a wholesale house, convinced the offi
cers that Pendleton was mistaken.

INSANE MURDERER
RAVES OF CRIME
THINKS HE STRUGGLES WITH
ASSASSINS
Man Who Killed Wilson Becomes Mad
From Effects of Liquor and Brood*
Ing— Threatens Violence
to Himself
Having mnrtly In hl« cell nt the city
Jail, George W. Kennedy, who shot and
killed A. L, Wilson In a Main street
saloon Friday morning, was found vio
lently Inmuie yesterday.
With his mind filled with scenes of
murders, suicide* and horrible reptiles
attacking him, the murderer threatens
violence to himself and all that ap
proaches him.
As the ilay progressed Kennedy be
came more violent and last evening his
condition was such that the Jail uuthor-
Ities found It necessary to remove him
from the upper "tanks" to the receiv
ing hospital. Despite the efforts of the
police surgeons the man's condition be
came such that they were forced to tie
him hand and foot in his bed In the
hospital.
Kennedy, H. Elmore and Wilson en
tered the sn loon shortly after midnight
nnd, according to bartender John Wil
liams, the men were much under the
Influence of Intoxicants. After taking
a drink they ordered another round, but
the bartender refused. Kennedy de
manded that Williams treat, but the
latter declined.
Maddened Man Shoots Companion
Angered, Kennedy drew n revolver
from his pocket, fired one "ihot at Wll
llmrm, but missed him. Then turning to
Wilson, with whom lie formerly hod
been on ill terms because of Rome mis
directed raring '.'tips," and without a
word Kennedy shot his companion
through the head. Wilson died the
next day.
Attracted by the shooting Patrolman
Daniels rushed to the scene of the af
fair and found Kennedy lying on tho
floor of the saloon apparently uncon
scious. In removinp him to the city
Jail Kennedy revived and attempted to
escape. Since thnt time he has been
confined to the city Jail.
Loud cries of a maniac reached the
Jailer yesterday afternoon. At first
no attention was paid to them, as the
Jailer thought they were the ravings
of a drunken man. Later a call from
the matron revealed that Kennedy was
giving utterance to his feelings. A
close watch revealed that the man was
suffering from mental delusions.
Sees Awful Sights
Wild screams, followed by moans
and curses, gnashing of teeth nnd hol
low laughter brouirh,. the keepers of the
prisoners on the run to Kennedy's cell
late in th> afternoon.- With hair dis
heveled and eyes distended, the mur
derer lay crouched in the darkest cor
ner.
"Shoot, rut. try, but by all the powers
of hell you can't kill me!" lie cried in
response to a query to what he was do-
Ing.
Then like a scene in an awful tragedy
the lnsune murderer enacted a struggle
with an imaginary victim. Again he
changed. His features, formerly an
ashen hue, turned white. He was be
ing attnrked by the most awful creat
ures of the Infernal regions— and so he
continued to rave.
In speaking of the case one of the
police surgeons paid last evening that
he thought the condition of Kennedy's
mind, was due to overindulgence in
liquor nnd the thoughts r>f his crime
combined. The doctor considered him
in. a serious condition, but believed he
would recover.

Legislation
By Associated Press.
ALBANY, N. V., Dec. 17.— The exec
utive committee of the "Association to
Prevent Corrupt Practices at Elec
tions," of which former Mayor Seth
Low of New York Is chairman, gave
out here tonight a letter which has
been sent to Gov. Higglns, suggesting
legislation for the purification of elec
tions which the committee regards as
desirable.
Attention is railed to the fact that
bribery Is alleged to be rampant at elec
tions in many parts of the state and
it is asserted that the explicit anti
bribery provisions of the penal code
are disregarded, "becnuse no person has
a motive for their enforcement suffi
cient to make him invoke the criminal
laws against one who may be a neigh
bor and v friend."

By Associated Press.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 17.— A shud
der of horror has convulsed Russia.
The government claims it has given .
battle only to the "red" revolutionists, -
but the populace generally believe .
that the "White Terror" hag returned. v
Already the leaders of the proletariat ,
agitation who escaped capture Satur
day night at the economic society and';
oven men of the rank of Prof. Mllukof t '
are In hiding from the police who are
hunting them down. The government;
evidently anticipates a battle royal and
has made its disposition accordingly. .
It fully understands that the < prole- !
tariat will give blow for blow in answer
to the wholesale arrests.
The Workmen's council and  the ,
League of Leagues Saturday night Is- i
sued a declaration of a general .strike ,

clothed with almost dictatorial pow- w .
ers, being authorized without consult
ing St, Petersburg to declare a state ot ■
siege and if. necessary even martial
law. As most of the provincial ' auth- 1

old • regime the advantage . they \ will .
take of such power to terrorize I the I
populace. can be easily imagined, they
being in a position to become petty -
tyrants and wage war each in his own I
particular fashion against the revo- c
lutionists.
The Novoe Vremya was the only
paper with tho exception of the, Of- ■
flcial Messenger to appear today, and,

from the Publishers' union and was
published under tho protection of the
police and Cossacks.
Editors Arrested .
The Slovo and the Novostl.two other,
papers that have not suspended pub

printers walked out in obedience to the '
order of the Council of Workmen ; be- ;■
cause these papers refused to print the

the proletariat organization attended;
the council today, the head of whom is
M. Letent, the owner of "New Life." :
The editors of tho newspapers sus- v ;
