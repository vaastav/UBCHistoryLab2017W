THE MONEYLESS MAN.
I there no secret place on the face of the earth.
Where charity dwelleth. wher virtue hath birth
W'here bosom in merry and kindneH will heave
And the poor and the wretched shall "ask and
receive "'
If there no place on earth where a knock from
the poor
Will brine a kind angel to open the door?
Ah. search the wide world wherever you can.
There is no open door for a moneyless mail.
Go look In yon hall, where the chandilier'a light
Drives off with its splendor the darkness of night!
Where the rich hanflrinft- velvet in Rhadowv fold.
Sweep gracefully down with its trimming of gold,
And the mirrors of silver take upand renew,
In long-lighted vistas the wildertng view
Go there, in yaur patches, and fiau if you can
A welcome of smiles for a moueyless man !
Go look in von church of a cloud-reachinz scire.
Which fives back to the sun his same look of
red fire;
Where the arches and columns are gorgeous
within.
And the wall seem aa cure as a soul without ain ;
Go down the loneaisle see the rich and the great.
xi. .11c puuip uii uie fjriue ui i"tii wvriuiy ea

Walk down In your patches, and find. If you can,
Who opens the pew to a moneyless maul
Go, look to yon judge, in his dark'flowin gown.
With thecaleKwh rein law weighethentiity down.
Where he frowns on the weak and smiles on the
strong.
And punishes right while he jsWHes wrong;
Where jurors their lips on the Bible have laid.
To render a verdict they've already made
Go there, in the court-room, and tiad, if you can,
Any law for the cause ef a moneyless man I
Go, look in the banks, where Mammon has told
Hi hundreds and thousands a.iritr and gold i
Where, safe from Hie bauds uf th starving and
poor.
Lies pile upon pile of the glittering ore;
Walk up to the ceunter ah, there you may stav.
Till your limb grow old and your hair turns gray.
And you'll find at the banks no one of the clan
With money to lend to a moneyless man!
Then go to your hovel; no raven has fed
The wife who has suffered too long for her bread ;
Kneel down by her pallet and kiss the death frost
From the lips of the angel your poverty lost ;
T'ien turn in youragony upward to God,
And blesH, while it nmitesyou thechasteningrod;
And you'll find at the end of vour life's Utile span;
There's a welcome above for a moneyless maul
Not onty above, but also on earth.
Is there one spot at leat where virtut hath birth
Where bosoms, in mercy and kindmm will heave.
And the noor and tho wretched ehall "ask and
receive."
It is Charity's Home, 'neaih the Mystical Arch,
Where Peace, Love and L'niiy constantly march.
Go there; give the Grand Hailing Sign if you can;
And welcome yon'll find though a moneyless
Not outward adornments; no ancestral name;
No money or bonds; no titular fame.
An entranee can gain to that sacred retreat.
Where, on true point of fellowship, brethren meet
On the common level tried bv the same plumb,
Are al who, within those precincts e'er come;
I ne and truly prepared, must all be ; nor can
The door remain closed 'gainst a moneyless man.
THE BEAUTIFUL.
Walk with the beautiful and with the grand;
Let nothing on earth thy feet deter.
Sorrow may lead the weeping by the hand.
But give not all thy bosom thought to her.
Walk with the beautiful !
I hear it say "The Beautiful!" what is It?
t. thou art darkly ignorant! Be -ure
'Tis no long weary road Its form to visit.
For thou cans't make it smile beside thy door.
Then love the Beautiful I
Ay, love it ; tis a sister that will bless
And teach thee patience when the heart is lonely.
Tbe angels love it, for they wear its dress,
And thou art made a little lower only.
Then love the Beautiful!
Some boast its presence In a Grecian face ;
Some, iu a favorite warbler of the skies.
But, be not fooled whate'r thine eye may trace.
Then seek it everywhere!
Thy bosom is its mint, the workmen are
Thy thoughts, and they must confer tho blessing.
The Beautiful exists in every star.
Thou mak'st it so, and art thyself deceiving,
11 omerwise my loitti.
Dot thou see Besuty in thy violet's cup?
I'll teach thee miracles I Walk on this heath,
And soy to the neglected flower: "Look up.
And be thou Beautiful." If thou hast faitu .
It will obey thy word-
One thing I warn thee bow no knee to gold ;
urnn luuucm, it mum Mie guueiees tongue.
It turn" the feeling prematurely old.
And they who keep their best artections young,
Best love tbe Beautiful !

THE LAND STEALERS.
An Exposure of Some of their Enormities,
and Consequent Criticism of
the Radical Congress — Bingham,
the Radical Congress — Bingham, Schenck and John Sherman Stand
Forth.
One of the land errand comnanie.
known as the Atlantic and Pacific, run
ning (or rather to run) from Springfield,
Missouri, to the Union Pacific, actually
sold out its land franchise, granted by the
Government, for tht turn of $300 000 to a
party of speculators. Thus we see Con
gress in tho attitude of making a gift en
terprise 01 me national domain, (which is
as legitimate a Dart of the National
Treasury as tbe money in it), to enable
one company of speculators, to sell out to
another, company of epecu)ator3, that
which belongs, not to Congress, bnt to
the whole people. If this franchise was
worth three hundred thousand dollars to
anybody (and it wa doubtless worth ten
limes tliat.) why was not the money put
into the Treasury of the Government
which granted the lands that gave it its
value?
But these things sink into comparitive
insignificance when we come to the enor
mous amount given away at the last ses
sion of Congress to the Northern Pacific
railway. This corporation, which under
takes to build a railway from Lake Supe
rior to the Pacific at Puget'a Bound, has
now secured no less than forty-seven mil
lion acres" of the public domain, with full
power to mortgage them to any extent,
and without any limitation whatever on
the price at which they may be sold. On
ly think of it ! Forty seven million acres,
equal to a Kingdom in Europe, larger
than many of our American States, given
away to a single private corporation,
whose sole object (whatever may be pre
tended) is to make money out of tneir
railroad enterprise. Thia dwarf into in
significance all former grants of land, for
whatever purpose, :n a single body. There
have been been granted for the noble ob
ject of education only 1,082,880 acres for
universities, and 67,983,914 acres in all for
public school purposes. For agricultural
colleges only 9,510,000 acres have been
distributed to the States, or about one-
nitn as mucn as nave gone to this one
railway company. In thre quarters of a
century we have only devoted the above
moderate amounts to educational purpo
ses It is true that in twenty years past.
Congress has voted 185,890.974 acreB to
corporations, chiefly to aid in the con
struction of railroads. But the first grant
made; in 1850, was to a State and the
three million acres thus granted to the Ill
inois Central Railway Company, have be
come, to a preponderant extent, together
with the railway itself the property of
loreign speculators, lms is a bad begin
ning, but worse, it is to be feared, remains
Deuina.
It is peculiarly scandalous.in this North
ern Pacific land grant business that the
Pouse of Representatives passed the bill
giving up this unheard-cf quantity of
public lands to private speculation, after
having at the very same session pledged
itself by a formal vote to tho following
resolution :
"Resolved, That in the judgment of this
House the policy of granting subsidies in
public lands to railroad and other corpor
ations ought to be discontinued; and that
every consideration of public policy and
equal justice to the whole people requires
that the public lands of the United States
should be held for the exclusive purpose of
securing homesteads to actual settlers un
der the homestead and pre-emption laws,
subject to reasonable appropriat" ns of
such lands for the purposes of edui. ,ion.''
The above passed the house of the 21st
of March, 1S70. It was offered by Mr.
Holman, of Indiana; (a Democrat,) who
has never failed to oppose vigorously eve
ry one of these measures of public plun-
uer. Ana yet the same House, three
months later, passed this prodigious
Northern Pacific land grab by a majority
of some twenty votes ! Truly, consistency
is a jewel, too rare to be sought in the
record of politicians. It is true some
Democratic members voted with the Re
publicans (only four or five Statesman.)
for this grab, but the overwhelming major
ity of the latter in both House and Senate
places the responsibility for the measure
unequivocally with the Republicans.
A SOLID SILVER ISLAND.
A Whole Island of Silver on the North
Shore of Lake Superior—Millions Being
Taken Out—The Most Remarkable
Discovery of the Age.
We have before alluded to the Silver Is
land of the north shore of Lake Superior,
in the British possessions just Delow
Thunder Cape, and some fifteen miles be
yond Ft. Willliam. The island is quite
small in dimensions say 100 feet by 40
and the most of it is submerged at high
water a small part at one end is is about
eight feet above the lake level. This is
land was entered by the Montreal Mining
Company as a tract embracing 108,000
acres, and was subsequently purchased of
them by Capt. W. B. Frew (formerly of
Portage lake, and superintendent of the
South Pewabic copper mine) for himself
and associates, including among them Ma
jor Sibley, of New . York, a brother, we
think, of Gen. Sibley of St. Paul.
The Montreal Mining Company first
made the discovery that the island con
tained silver, and by their agents sunk a
a shaft on the island, but they knew noth
ing about mining, and the water ccming
in upon them, further working of their
mine was abandoned as useless. It was
only last summer that Capt. F. and his
company completed their bargain with
the Montreal company for the island, and
ecured it by paying or agreeing to pay
$250,000 for the entire 108,000 tfcrea.
They went immediately to work at im
proving the mine. Their first step was to
surround the island with cribs of timber,
filled with stone, to serve asa breakwater
and ice-breaker, and within these cribs a
cofferdam was built, and filled with clay,
having the effect of making the whole in
terior of the island nearly water tight, at
least trom the intrusion of the lake. The
next step was to set up two large syphon
pumps worked by steam, by which the in
side was pumped dry, or nearly so, and it
has since been found that a very little
working of the pumps daily keeps the land
clear of water entirely.
Then they went to work laying bare the
vein, and now have exposed seventy feet
in length, and find it to be a true fissure
vein, of silver matrix being calcareous
epar with some little quartz intermixed.
The vent is eight feet wide, and eye-witnesses
from there state for one quarter pi
this width it will average seventy per
cent of pure silver. On the first trial, af
ter the water was gotten out, six men
took out $35,000 worth of Bilver in four
days, and up to the latest accounts the
working has continued at about this rate.
Already 123 barrels of native silver, said
to be worth 75 to $100,000, have been
shipped. The yield of the mine, compu
ted by the ton, is not less than a dollar to
the pound. The mine employs now about
forty men, and the company will increase
their force immediately.
The "royalty" paid on this to the Eng
lish government is quite small not ex
ceeding one-twentieth. Eye witnesses of
intelligence, judgment and experience re
port that Capt Frew will probably take
out of silver, up to the opening of navi
gation next spring, lrom 1 to $3,000,000
money value)
The steamer Meteor conveyed down
the lakes on her trip before last, sixty
two barrels of silver. This silver island is
no humbug, but an actual bona fide af
fair, in which the most wonderful results
have already been obtained, and all ' bids
fair to make it yield and richness the
most remakable mining discov
ery in this country for many years. Some
masses of silver went down i on
the Meteor larger than a man could lift.
A part of the island vein, say one of the
eight feet in width, is wonderfully rich,
and it is from this portion that the largo
silver masses are extracted. Other rich
mines of silver are reported as having
been found on the main north shore in the
ranee of the silver island, and CaDt. Hod-
son of Portage lake, has gone east to or
ganize a company 10 worK them. JJuluth

The Vanderpool-Field Murder—One of
the Suspected Assassins of Field is
Arrested and Hangs Himself.
Last week Officer Rowley arrested a
man named Sensly de Foreut, prowling
around his house in Frodonia. De Forest
bad been sleeping in barns, &c He was
placed in jail charged with vagrancy, and
in default of bail was sentenced to the
House of Correction for one year, where
he desired to go. He said that be bad
friends living in Flint, in this State, and
that a lawyer there had charged him' with
a great crime. He spoke of the Vander
pool trial as though he knew all about it.
He acted very strangely, and an ex-member
of Congress from Pennsylvania, who
saw him as he come into Rowley's bouse,
questioned him somewhat, and then gave
his opinion that De Forest was the mur
derer of Field. De Forest was placed in
jail, and this morning he was found in the
cell with a rope banging around bis neck
and tied to au iron bar, Bead. An inquest
was held, and a verdict rendered that he
came to his death by his own hands. A
mystery hangs around the man, and it is
said from his own statements that he im
plicated himself in the murder of Field,
and supposed he was arrested for some
such crime. No one here knows him.
The Kansas Tribune relates that two
persons passing out out of Lawrence on
the Galveston road were struck with the
beaty of the town.
"Whose place is that?" said one of
them.
"That is the lordly residence ef Major
George A. Reynolds. Cost thirtv thousand
dollars."
"What is his business."
"Indian agent."
"What is his salary, and how long has
he held o5ce ? "
"Two years, at fifteen hundred dollars a
year."
"What did the honest fellow do with
the rest of his salary ? "
Started his brother and two other hon
est men in business."
Tbbee young men recently entered a
house in Utica, New York, via. the cellar
window. The lady of the mansion quietly
pointed a revolver at them, when they had
got as far as the drawing room. Rather
than be shot they consented to crawl, one
by one, out of that cellar window again,
while the good lady looked on and com
mended their industry. After the last one
had crawled out be felt like "sassing" that
woman, and turned about to do so, butone
look down tbe barrel of that revolver wil
ted his determination. Such women as
that are "handy to have in the house."

HOUSE.
Messrs. F. MORAY, of Louisiana, C.
H. HOLMES, of New York, and U. P.
WOLFE, of Iowa, members elected to fill
vacancies, presented themselves and took
the oath.
The bill passed by the Senate at the last
session, extending the time lor the con
struction of a railroad from St. Croix river
or lake, to the west end of Lake Superior,
and to Bayfield, came up under the regu
lar order of business thia morning. .It ex
tends the terms of the grant for seven
years from the 1st of May, 1869, provided
that thirty miles be completed withim 18
months, and 30 miles every year thereaf
ter. The bill was explained and advocated
by Mr. Wikon of Minnesota.
The bill was further explained and ad
vocated by Mr. Washburn, of Wisconsin,
who stated, in reply to the questions of
Mr. Welker, that the length of the road
oriSmally was 350 miles. Nearly 200
miles were already completed and in run
ning order, the remainder was under con
tract, and that the quantity of land was
required to be about one million of acres.
Mr. WOOD opposed the bill, declaring
it to be but a continuation of the swind
ling system, Ly which tne public lands had
been given away to private corporations.
Mr. JULIAN desired to have the bill
amended as to exclude timber lands from
the grant.
Mr. LAWRENCE desired to have coal
and iron land excluded, and to require the
Railroad company to 6ell the land to actu
al settlers only, and in quantities not ex
ceeding a quarter section, and at not more
than $2,50 per acre.
Mr. WILSON agreed that it was now
admitted that the publis lands should go
to actual settlers. Congress should adopt
that policy which would prove most ad
vantageous to settlers, and that was the
opening of communications by railroads.
After further discussion th hill w lnirl

Science and Wrr.
It was believed by many eminent and
distinguished men, that as science increas
ed and that as education and intelligence
became general, that war as a mutual
eonsequence would decrease and utterly
disappear; but such is not the case.
hen we look at the desperate struggle
and sanguinary war now raging between
France and Prussia, or if we take a back
ward glance at our bloody four years
struggle it seem to us that the Science has
but little or nothing to do to piocrastirate
its carnage or to mutigate their cencomi
tant evils.
We claim to be the most enlightened,
educated and civilized nation on Gods foot
stool, yet our science and enlightment did
not prevent us from entering into a long
civil strife, the termination of which no
foresighted man could presume to deter
mine. Prussia is claimed and pronounced
by manv Americans to be the best educa
ted and the most intelligent nation in
Europe, the same is also claimed of the
leading people of France. Yet to-day the
two nations are engaged in one of the
most causeless and bloodiest wars on record,
with the implements of war rendered so
perlect by science and art that they great
ly increase instead of decreasing mortality.
Such is the experience which our own
country furnishes, and such is the experi
ence which the most enlightened nations
of Europe furnish, that science has but
little or no influence on war. Wars exis
ted from time immemorial and we believe
that they will exist as long as the world
stands, not that we would justify war or
disparage science. We all know that war
is the moat evil that afflicts us, it'is mur
ner and not anything but wholesale
slaughter.
And those that excite enmities and
kindle the fires ef war between nations for
ambition, and persona) causes, are butch
ers and should receive the execrations of
mankind. We believe that science has
done much and is still doing much for the
world, but men are always about the
same, the passions of men are not whit
more mild than a thousand years ago.
What is wanting is more genuine Christi
anity and brotherly love. There is no

Posteeitt. The greatest man is he
who trouble? himself the least about the
verdict that may be passed upon him by
his contemporaries or posterity, but who
finds in doing good honest wojk to the
best of his ability under existing condi
tions "its own exceeding great reward."
The Woeld. Seek not to please the
world, but your own conscience. The; man
who has a feeling within him that he has
done his duty upon every occasion is far
happier than he who hangs upon the
smiles of the great or the still .more fickle
favors of the multitude.
A Teue Fbiend. What is a . true
friend ? A true friend is he who not' onlv
shows himself so when the frowns of mis
fortune fall upon us, but even when we
treat him as a foe builds friendship's altar
higher and firmer with the very stones cast
against him by our folly or perVerseness.

Impeachment Merited.
A distinguished Maryland lawyer and
statetman in Washington, in speaking of
the result of the recent elections, and the
manner in which tbe President and his
subordinates interfered with them fpr po
litical, or rather partisan purposes, says
that the time was (and ought to be now)
when, if a President had been 'so corrupt
as to undertake to influence -the-public
vote of the country by the appliances
brought to bear by President Grant, he.
would be impeached. There is not prin
ciple or force enough in Congress to im
peach the President nor any of his parti
san officers, but there is a mora impeach
ment of the President by the people, nev
ertheless, on the following points :
1st. The use of tbe Federal military to
control State and municipal elections, aa
in the employment of U. St artillery and
U. S. encincers and marines to intimidate
the people at the ballot box, two weeks
since.
2d. The known and authorized use of
the salaries of Federal officers, in viola
tion of U. S. laws, as a corruption elec
tioneering fund to sustain tbe Federal ad
ministration. 3d. Executive interference in the State
pvlitics of Missouri, not alone by partisan
letters, but by the use of FederaTpatren-
4tn. Like interference in the elections of
Maryland and other States.
The President is defeated in New York
by a popular vote of 34,060, in Missouri
by a popular vote of 42,000. in Maryland,
even with 37,000 negro votes, by a unani
mous Democratic delegation in Congress ;
in Kentucky by a Democratic majority of
30,000, with negro votes for the President,
in Delaware which is a trnnror Tiomn-
cratic State than ever before; in Nevada
by a Democratic majority ; in Tennessee.

The President's endorsement- in Kansas
and Louisiana is email indeed compared
with the great gains and victories else
where, and herein is tbe impeachment of
the President of the United States, and if
not by the supreme law, as appointed in
the Constitution, then by the voice of the
people. Gen. Grant stands directly rebuked
lor executive interference in the elections
of the people, and in tbe States of N. York
Missouri and Maryland, the rebuke is of
that kind which no calumny can answer,
no argument remove, and no appeal set
aside. Springfield Transcript.
The Consequences.
A Californian fixed up some tempting
rat poison which proved efficacious. Some
hogs ate up the rats and died also. Then,
some Chinamen "utilized" the bogs car
casses, and they were very sick, but will
recover. Thus do the consequences of a
trivial act spread abroad.

first turn her bead one way and then tho.
other?"

peasant." "Yeare both Moslems," an
swered the fearless Omar, ."and in the
sight of God, who is no rtspector of per
sons, ye are equal."
