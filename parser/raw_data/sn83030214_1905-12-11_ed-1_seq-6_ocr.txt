! BLAME FOR THE PLAGUE.
A,few weeks ago a New-Orleans physician, Dr.
Holt, addressed to the public a letter regarding
thin year's epidemic of yellow fever iv Louisiana.
JCegli^enoe was imputed in the document to both
Dr. Soucboc, president of the State Board of
Healtii. and to Dr. Kebab*, >jio local health of
ficer of the Crescent City ; but the greater part
of the attack was directed against the latter of-
Bdal. It was epecincally charged that Dr.
Kohnke had denied tlie existence of yellow fever
In New-Orleans vrhen he must have been aware
of Its presence, had indulged in threatening lan
goage ween referring to reports which might be
made of genuine oases and had expressed an in
tention to defy the law. Dr. Kohnke has now
seen nt to take, notice of these accusations, and
repMes to Dr. Holt and other critics in a clrculai
Mrhich has been widely distributed. To one or
two charges the answer is that his utterances
have been wrongly interpreted. He reproduces
« letter from the doctor who is said to have been
threatened In which the matter Is treated as a
joke. Finally, Dr. Kobiike declares that after
much deliberation Dr. Holt signed a petition last
June for the reappointnsent cf tho present health
officer, who has held the position for several
years. Dr. Holt's attack is so effectually dis
credited by thefce facts that his statements may
!»«' disregarded.
Nevertheless, there is reason for attempting to
determine from other and less questionable testi
mony how far Dr. Kohnke deserves blame. In
Ihe first place, be njust be relieved of resiionsi
b!iiiy for the importation of the first cases from
*>ntrai America, because the health officer of
New-Orleans does not control the quarantine sta
tion near the moiuh of the Mississippi. That is
« state Institution. Again, he had no authority
to prevent the carrying of infection by refugees
from New-Orleans to other parts cf Louisiana
nnd to adjacent states. The law gives him no
power over the railroad companies, he says, and
his assertion may be accepted. A third plea in
f*el£defeni« !s advanced which is convincing. It
has been asserted that the mortality in the im
mediate Tidnity of the French Market for three
months prior to the first official recognition of
trouble, July 12, should have warned him that
something was wrong. Dr. Kohuke makes a sta
tistical cciapariwm between that period and the
corresponding one in 1904, and proves that there
was practically nothing in the vital statistics to
excite apprehension. Furthermore, according to
his story, the health officer displayed great dili
gence in tryin? to suppress tho disease when he
first detected it« presence. In spite of his ef
forts, however, it spread with startling rapid
ity. In lees than a month 68 oases were re
ported in twenty-tour hours, and two days later
the number jumped to 105, though this record
marked the turning point in the situation. Do
these figures show the exercise of that energy
and vigilance which New-Orleans had a right to
expect in so experienced an official as Dr.
Kohnke?
NIAGARA AND THE SOOr
One of the most important topics discussed by
the International Waterways Commission was
the diversion of water in the Niagara and the
St. Mary's rivers for power purposes. At the
"Soo" the practical effect is to threaten naviga
tion in the canal around the rapids, whereas at
Niagara there is danger of raining an almost
unique piece of natural scenery. So far as we
are aware, no anxiety has been felt regarding
the adequacy of the supply for the Welland
Canal. In one case, therefore, the objections are
commercial ar.d in the other aesthetic; but In
both they are so formidable as to deserve the
most respectful consideration by the authorities,
federal, state and provincial, to which the com
mission appeals.
Resolutions were adopted asking tJlat no more
franchises for power developments at Niagara
or Sault Sic. Marie be granted until an op
portunity had been horded for a careful inquiry
into the possible consequences of the privileges
already conceded. This is so reasonable a request
that disregard of it would provoke grave criti
cism. At present official responsibility on tha
American side of Niagara rests on the gov
ernment of New-York Sfate. It is for the
Legislature and Governor to gusrd against fur
ther concessions, and they am probnbly be
trusted to exercise the requisite vigilance, at least
for a short time. Still, there is a widespread
feeling tliat greater security would be insured
by turning the control of tbe matter over to the
federal authorities, which, since navigation 13
not Involved, have now no very distinct constitu
tional power. Tha object could probably be at
tained by ceding the Niagara reservation to the
national government. President Roosevelt doubt
less had in mind some such preliminary when In
his last message to Congress be alluded to tbe
desirability of the stace's turning the falis over
to the nation. Before the step is taken courtesy
and expediency would suggest deliberation over
the propriety of giving to tbe state commission
which is intrusted with the supervision of the
reservation much larger powers tbnn it now pos
sesses. In the mean time, since the falls can be
protected only by co-operation between tno au
thorities on both Fides of tho boundary. It is to
be hoped that the government of Ontario will for
the present discourage all applicants for new
franchises.
At Sault Ste. Marie an anomalous situation
exists. The canal belongs to the United States
government, whereas most, if not all, of the
power plants which consume water in that neigh
borhood aro on the Canadian side of the river.
It would probably i»e impracticable to rescind
any rights which have already been granted : but
for the prevention of fun her drafts on nature's
limited siippfy this country would evidently be
dependent on the courtesy of the Province of On
tario. By circuitous diplomatic routine it might
be feasible to exercise iho necessary persuasion,
but a resort thereto does not seem to be requisite.
The explicit recommendations of the Interna
tional Waterways Commission may prove equally
potent, and these have undoubtedly been trans
mitted already to Toronto.
BATHfO THE BISOX.
The organization of the American Bison so
ciety, which \v:is effected in this city lasr week
with Mr. Roosevelt as honorary president and
Mr. William T. Homaday as president, is cord
ially to be commended as the taking of a prac
tical step to prevent, though at the eleventh
hour, tho consummation of a great wrong. The
extinction of the bison, to which we have come
perilously near, would be a cause for extreme
regret. From tho sentimental point of view, it
would be disgraceful for us to permit the de
struction of that animal, which Is perhaps the
most distinctive and certainly the most impres
sive of ail the characteristic fauna of America.
From the utilitarian point of view it would be
foolish and profligate to inflict upon the world
the loss of a creature possessing such potential
ities of profit.
There should be maintained, then, on grounds
of historic sentiment and for the sake of stu
dents and lovers of natural history herds of
bison of purest blood, in conditions resembling
as closely as possible those of their ancient
habitut, and in numbers sufficient to preclude
any reasonable possibility of the stock's dying
out. In more than a few states of this Union
there are ample expanses of lanl well suited
for bison ranges, which could bo devoted to no
better purpose. It will be a worthy thing,
whether through public or private munificence,
there to maintain what will be perpetual re
minders of those innumerable herds that once
roamed the Western plain 3 and that were as
typical of American wild life as lions and ele
phants of Africa or tigers of Bengal.
In addition, it will be a profitable thing to
promote the propagation of the bison, either of
pure or, more probably, of mixed blood, for
their economic value. The worth of their hides,
dressed with the hair, as "buffalo robes," was
more familiar to the last generation than It is
to the present, and the same may be said of
their flesh as an article of food. For the sake
of these things, the bison is well worth preserr
inc. while the possibility of developi--\£ it—per
haps through some admixture of other strains—
into a working animal for agricultural labor
and a beast of burden may be worthy of care
ful consideration. The composition of the so
ciety which has just been formed gives promise
that all phases of this interesting question will
receive expert attention, from which we may
anticipate much satisfaction.
GERMAN FINANCES.
The nuances of the German Empire appear to
be, as tbe Imperial Chancellor frankly confessed
on Wednesday, in a far less gatisfactory condi
tion than rn'ght be desired or expected in the
case of so industrious and progressive a country.
A rapidly iucr easing public debt and a chronic
and increasing deficit In the yearly Budget are
not agreeable characteristics of a nation's
finances, especially when that nation is a com
posite empire whose individual states have also
their own individual debts, which in some cases
are very large and burdensome. Twenty-eight
years ago the imperial debt was only $18,050.
000. Now it is about $675,000,000. In addition
Prussia has a national debt of $1,700,000,000,
Baden of $100,000,000. Bavaria of $435,000,000,
Hesse of $80,000,000, Saxony of nearly $250,000,
000, Wurtemberg of $130,000,000 and 6O on down
to the principality of Selnvarzburg-Sondershau
een, whose 81,000 inhabitants owe collectively
some $1,390,000. We believe, however, that Reues,
of the elder line, has no dobt, while Anhalt —
happy duchy : — instead of a debt has a credit of
$1,410,000.
Besides this increase in debt, the German def
icit shows symptoms of increasing nnd of getting
back to or beyond its highwater mark of $20,
222,000 in 1901. It fell to $13,325,000 in 1902,
rose to $15,450,000 !n 1903, declined to 514.025,
000 In 1904 and this year rose again to about
$19,500,000. Those figures Indicate not only an
unsatisfactory contrast between revenues and ejt
penditures, but also, as Germans are themselves
freely declaring, an unsntisfaetory system of ad
ministering the fiscal affairs of the empire. It
is argued that it would be better to add what
ever might be necessary to tbe fixed tax burden
NEW-YORK DAILY TRIbCNE. MOXfeAY, DECEMBER 11. 1005.
of the empire bo as to make the Budget balance
than to have each year a deficit which must be
met in some special way.
It is now proposed to take some such step as
that With a now chronic deficit of nearly or
quite $20,000,000. and with large additional ex-
Benditures demanded for army, navy and other
purposes, it is planned to make an increase in the
regular inr-ome of the empire to the amount of
about $62,500,000 a year. That means another
dollar a year for, or from, every, inhabitant of
the empire. How to pecure It without overbur
dening the people is a serious problem. It Is
reckoned that a part of It will come from In
creased customs under the new tariff, but the
bulk of It must come from new internal taxes.
An increase of 63 per cent of the beer tax is pro
posed, which would produce $15,000,000 a year,
and an additional tax on foreign tobacco, which
would further protect the home industry, would
produce $10,000,000. Some additional stamp
taxes nnd death duties are also in view, and as
a final re«ort there is talk of calling for roatric
ular contributions from the states.
It is interesting to observe that, In the face
of this condition of affairs, there is, excepting
on the part of the Social Democrats, general
acquiescence in the new navy programme, which
contemplates the expenditure on the navy of
nearly $1,000,000,000 in the next twelve /oars.
That may be regarded as unwise, even as extrav
agant, but it is nevertheless to be reckoned with
as a fact by those European nations which meas
ure their own naval needs by the examples of
their neighbors. The German navy is now the
third in Europe, and is striving to become the
second in the near future, and ultimately first
At present, as the new bill shows, the empire is
pushing Its naval expansion somewhat more
vigorously than any of Its neighbors. But with
imperial finances in so unsatisfactory a state it
may be a question how long it can maintain the
present rate of expenditure on armaments.
TO BOYCOTT "WASHEE-WASHEE."
The ingenious suggestion Is made by Ameri
cans in China who have suffered from the boy
cott there, according to a Tribune correspond
ent at Hankow, that it would be an effective
thing for Americans at home to retaliate in
kind by boycotting the Chinese laundries. It
is represented that Hop Sing and Wun Lung
and all the rest of them who work all night
transforming our shirt collars into jig-saws are
employes of the Six Companies, which are
chiefly responsible for the boycotting of Ameri
can goods in China, and that if the business of
the laundries wer<* to follow the trail of Othel
lo's occupation there would quickly be a change
of policy at Canton.
Maybe. There can be no doubt that cessa
tion of American— including Irish, German.
Italian, Swedish. Polish, Bohemian, Russian et
al.— patronage to the Chinese laundries would
gravely affect the. business of those interesting
institutions. The rule has hitherto been "No
tickee. no shirtee!" enforced by John with in
flexible resolution; and we remember that on
one memorable occasion, when an obstreperous
patron insisted with force and arms upon secur
ing "shirtee" without a corresponding surrender
of "tickee," Jehu promptly tripped him prone
and began applying the hottest of smoothing
irons to various exposed parts of his anatomy
with amazing effect. But a natural corollary
of that nilo -would be "No shirtee. no waafaee!"'
and a sequel of that would be "No w.ishee, no
laundree'." And if no shirts were presented to
be washed, and there vras therefore no wash
ing and in turn, of course, no more laundries,
what would become of the Six Compnnies-al
ways supposing the Six Companies to be real,
live things and not, as some have suggested, a
mere solar myth?
We should be half inclined to take up this
suggestion as a grout national issue if it were
not for our reluctance to deprive a too indoleut
generation of the invariable object tessoi which
John presents In rekalsbminlng and burnishing
our linen at 3 o'clock a. m. With that example
of industry removed, we should have tears for
the future of America. Besides, we have an
idea that Hop Sing, Wun Lung and the rest
have already on various occasions been pretty
severely harried by the Hoodlum amcricamim,
and also that some most estimable mandarins
Lave failed to be treated in this country with
the courtesy which stamps the caste of \ ere de
Vere Suppose that instead o/f boycotting the
coolie John we treat the mandarin Li as a man
and a brother and not as a "blanked Chink.
yORTH VERSUS SOUTH JERSEY.
New-Tersey is not a large state, and yet it pre
sents some odd contrasts within its borders.
Dunn" this year's campaign the cry of In
dependence, the denunciation of bossisni and
of corporate interference in politics rang over
the land Nowhere, perhaps, was it stronger
than in the northern section of New-Jersey. In
deed Mr Everett Colby was stirring things up
in Essex County long before there was any sign
of excitement elsewhere in the country. Then,
in the adjoining county of Hudson. Mayor r agan
was conducting a magnificent tight for the
"square deal." But, somehow, through It all the
southern end of the state remained inseus.tive
Even when Philadelphia arose in its might and
stormed the citadel with a force and vehemence
never before known in the Quaker City those
New-Jersey communities across the Delaware
Iliver moved along at their usual gait, unstirred
and sluggish. Not a growl against bossism ; not
a howl about machines or anything else.
With South Jersey it was a case of "standing
pat ' Maybe the reasons which prompted peo
ple'elsewhere to join in the great reform move
ment were non-existent there. It is probably
true that the bosses In South Jersey are so easy
and gentle that only the velvet gloves of their
iron hands are felt. Then, too. the population
is so scattered in most counties that the people
are especially grateful for railroad and trolley
facilities and unwilling to hamper the transpor
tation companies. These facts probably explain
in some measure the seeming apathy of a large
section of New-Jersey while the remainder of it
was worked into fever heat on Issues that one
might expect to affect the whole state in pretty
much the same manner. Other explanations ma^
develop during the legislative session which be
gins a month hence, and it will be interesting to
note them.
MONET AXD BUSINESS.
In the face of the highest rate for call money
In over three years price* of securities made a
net gain last week to within about on© point of
the record established a few months ago. and
several stocks attained new maximum positions.
It Is almost unprecedented to see the market so
stubbornly supported during a period of finan
cial stringency, arid it emphasizes the statement
made in tills column some time ago that the
large operators were provided with money bor
rowed on time when the rate was low, so that
they have not felt the recent pressure. Un
doubtedly the eharp fall In sterling Indicated
that there were heavy offerings of finance bills,
which means that some traders In Wall Street
are borrowing from Europe to operate In this
market. Undoubtedly the President's message
was an agreeable surprise to the stock market,
the short account having been swelled in antici
pation of some radical suggestions regarding
railway rate regulation. Were it not for the
monetary complications and the fact that prices
are already abnormally high, some reason for
encouragement might be found in the latest
statements of railway earnings, particularly that
of the Union Pacific. But the market la not
normal and does not respond to natural Influ
ences.
Call loans have again risen above 20 per cent,
and bankers do not look for any return to easy
conditions before the middle of next month.
Fluctuations tn rates of domestic exchange In
dicate that Interior Institutions are desirous of
taking advantage of tne attractive terms pre*
vailing in the local money market, but the ac
tivity of general business and the handling of
the crops keeps most of the available supply
engaged at home. Some discrimination is noted
for the first time this season in lending on In
dustrial securities, and in all financial oper
ations evidences of conservatism Increase as
the situation becomes more complicated. Holi
day requirements will he beyond precedent, and
demands for small change are already taxing
Treasury facilities. The stringency is not due
to any reduction in thr total available amount
of money, for the per capita circulation on De
cember 1 was officially reported a a •*"! 7&,
which is nine cents higher than a month pre
vious, when all earlier records were surpassed.
Rates of foreign exchange declined sharply as
the money market advanced, until quotations
reached the point where gold imports were ar
ranged a few months ago; but in the mean time
the price of bar gold has advanced at London.
A heavy loss of cash carried the reserve of the
associated banks once more helov. th« l»gal
limit.
That the monetary stringency Is chiefly due
to speculative causes is clearly demonstrated by
the fact that commercial activity Is in no way
retarded and mercantile payments are satisfac
torily prompt in most sections of the country.
The closing month of the year promises to con
tinue the favorable comparisons made by Its
immediate predecessors, bank exchanges rising
far above those of 1904, omitting .this city,
wh^re speculative acttvlty renders it difficult to
secure an accurate measure of payments in com
mercial channels. While the weather has been
more favorable for retail trade in seasonable
merchandise. It has not yet seriously retarded
outdoor work, building operations being on a
phenomenal scale and prices of all materials
very firmly held. It is necessary to go back
twenty-two years to find a time when the gen
eral level of prices of all commodities was
higher than at present, and. even making a
moderate allowance for the effect of speculation
at the commodity exchanges, it is evident that
consumption mus' be beyond all records, since
the relations of demand and supply in the long
run determine cost.
Sensational developments followed the depart
ment's estimate off 1 a cotton crop of only 10.K57,
81S bales. Although a number of private au
thorities had predicted so low a total, there was
a general belief that the official figures would
be much larger, and the session immediately be
came one of great excitement. Before the close
of the market on Monday it was estimated that
1,500.000 bales had changed hands, and, in
stead of the usual market unit of 100 bales,
transactions were made in blocks of .'.OOO bales
or more. Evidently a very large short interest
existed, and before these contracts were closed
the price had risen about a cent a pound. In
stead of the reaction that usually follows such
a violent advance, prices continued rising on
subsequent days, until spot middling uplands at
this city sold £22 50 a bale higher than a year
ago, or about the same price that ruled at the
corresponding date in 1903. In commenting on
the official statement it was pointed out by ex
perts that the estimate last year was 1,.">00,000
bales too small and that Southern planters are
known to be holding back cotton for which they
hope to "receive 13 cents. Yet port receipts are
remarkably well maintained, and exports do not
show the decline from last year's figures that
might be expected.
Manufacturing plants in the leading indus
tries have so much business under contract for
future delivery that the usual stoppages for
stock taking and repairs will be restricted as far
as possible, and inventories promise to show a
remarkably good record for the year, although
during the opening months conditions were
quiet in many lines. Forwardings of footwear
from Boston are breaking all records, and pro
ducers find no opposition to f-o higher quota
tions, while still further advances cannot be
avoided if the markets for hides and leather are
maintained at their abnormal position. Hides
are sold for February delivery at current quo
tations, which is equivalent to another ad
vance, because the winter take-off will be of
pborer quality. Although some lines of cotton
goods are still quoted at former prices, the gen
eral tendency Is upward, as might be expected,
in view of the prices that spinners will be com
pelled to pay for future supplies of raw cotton,
unless a violent reaction occurs in that staple.
Woollens are well maintained, and the position
of raw wool was improved by results at the
sixth series of the London auction sale. New
business Is steadily offered to steel producers,
greatest activity coming from the requirements
of the railways.
A dozen men, lacking one, have already been
convicted or are in hiding in connection with
election frauds, and still Mayor McClellan's
counsel oppose an honest recount of the ballots.
rSoes the Mayor want the office whether honest
ly elected or not?
The nervousness exhibited by people in Suffolk
County over the proposition to establish a sana
torium for tuberculosis is natural, perhaps, but
unwarrantable. Those who aro most familiar
with the facts declare that nowhere else is there
such an assurance of Immunity as in the imme
diate neighborhood of an institution of this kind.
With the United States? sending macaroni
wheat to Europe and wines to France, the
proverb about sending coals to Newcastle seems
to be practically realized. It is not surprising,
however, that this country thus competes, in
various markets of the world, in products hither
to confined to exclusive and remote localities, for
the extent and variety of the American domain
are such as make it a practical epitome of the
whole world. There is scarcely a soil or a cli
mate, apart from the Arctic and Tropic ex

"Public affairs," said Machiavelli, "are easily
managed In a city where the body of the people
is not corrupt." An intimation that in our great
cities the body of the people was corrupt would
be properly resented as a calumny. Then why
should it be so difficult to manage their affairs?

For expert naval testimony commend to us
Admiral Rojeatvensky, who Is probably the best
qualified man in the world to tell how a modern
war fleet can be annihilated by the enemy.
Speaking with mature deliberation, long after
the battle of the Sea of Japan, he says the Jap
anese victory was won entirely by their guns.
None of the projectiles penetrated the Russian
ships, but the repeated shock of the projectiles
striking and bursting against them disjointed
their steel plates, sprung the rivets and set
them to leaking like cieves, so that the centre
of gravity was shifted and the vessel* sank.
This effect pf the firing, he says, was entirely
different from what had been expected. W«
must regard this tribute to the Japanese guns,
however, as applying equally to the men behind
the guns, for the Russian admiral says that had
the crews of the fleets been of equal value the
result would have been different. As it was, th«
Russian crews quickly became demoralized by
the awful fire of the Japanese, while the Jap
anese remained unaffected, continuing their fire
with composure and with mathematical preci
sion. That is about what ths observant world
concluded concerning the battle some time ago,
an:l it is giatifying to have its Judgment thus
confirmed by the unsurpassed authority of the
man behind tho target.

The Belgians once succeeded In getting- rut
rates on an operation from Sir Morel McKenzie.
He engaged to att^nl a case at Antwerp. When he
landed he was met by three men In mourning,
who informed him, according to "The Reader
Magazine," that the patient had died, but that
they would pay his full fee.
"And now." said the man. "since you are here,
what do you pay to viFifi:isr the city hospital and
sivlngr a clinic ror t!ie benefit of our local sur
geons? It is noi. often they have an opportunity
of benefiting by such science as yours."
Sir Morel said he would fladly comply. He went
to the hospital and performed many operations,
among which wero two of a similar nature to that
for wh!ch«he had been called over. "When he fin
ished, all thanked him profusely. On th* steamer
going home ho met a frirnd who liad a business
house in Antwerp.
"Pretty scurvy trick th n y played on you. Sir
Morel."
"What do you mean?" asked the surgeon.
"Told you the patient di?d before you arrived,
didn't they?"
"Yes."

The giving of a "character" to domestic servants
is one of the severest tests of tlio employers' char
acter. An Irish master, being called upon to write
a testimonial for a groom whom he was discharging 1
for drunkenness, gave htm a good character, but
omitted to mention o\\e trait. The groom returned
the letter, objecting that it did not say he was
sober. The muster added "sometimes sober,*" and
the man was content. The woman who had to rec
ommend the inefficient cook she had kept for seven
years only because she was afraid to give her
notice went one hotter. Sho had covered three
pages with undeserved comvnendatfons; she bad
placed it in an envelope and addressed it. and her
conscience pricked her badly. Then she had a
happy idea, and broke open the seal, adding to her
letter, as a postscript. "God ¥6rgivo me"' It sat
isfied her conscience, but hHrory does not relate if
it satisfied the other woman. &B '

A curious test of the atmeaphere was tried in
the French Senate recently. Billot com

in the apparatus. Recourse, was had to a "bird

The French schoolboy"! had recently to pass a
government examination at the close of the
primary course. The invention of balloons was
the aubject given. "Balloons wero invented."
wrote one boy, "by the Brothers Montgolfier. who
were paper makers. They took a large balloon
and filled It with paper. They then set light *o
the paper, and the bailoon went up." Another boy
included a treatise on ballast in his essay, with
disastrous consequences. "When th« aerostats
such being the name given to men who ride in
balloons— wish to come down, they fetch some
sand and gravel and put it In the balloon. The
latter Is thus rendered heavier and more elongat

places himself within the balloon, the basket being
used for provisions."

THE BRAVE DESERVE THE FARE.
From The Kansas City Times.
On a small branch railroad of Eastern Kansas
there Is run a mixed train of one passenger coach
and any number of freight and stock cars. Th«
conductor Is known to every one living alone the
line, and passengers seldom buy tickets. Some give
a pleasant smile in return for transportation, and
others pay whatever they please. The conductor
seldom looks at the -money, but convoys It at once
Into his pocket.
"How much money do you turn In to the com
pany, anyway?" a frienj once asked the conductor,
"Why. I throw It up Into the air and all that
sticks to the bell rope I turn In." was th* reply.
"But aren't you afraid the company will suspect
they are holding the sack?"
"I can't afford to be afraid. None but the bravo
deserve the fare, you know."
That settled It.

BAILIFFS IN POLITICS.
Who Cannot Afford to Sell Out
Their Rivals.
London. November 2&.
Lord Rosebcry's epigram has been r»irn«d
against himself. He had d*serib*<l Mr. Cham
berlain n* th*- bailiff In possf>«?ion of all th»
political asset? and ab!<- to sell out Mr. Balfour
at any moment. Mr. Austen Chamberlain, pos
sibly prompted by his father, has retorted tha^
the Irish bailiff is in control of the Liberal house
hold—a very persistent and strong: man. Th*r»
ir. no effective reply to th?» Chancellor of th*
Exchequer, for the divisions in the Liberal party
on the question of Home Rule are as sharp and
apparently as Irreconcilable as those on th*
Unionist side respecting fiscal policy. There is
indeed a close parallel between the two political
situations. Mr. Balfour and Sir Henry Camp
bfcll-Bannerman are the official leaders empow
ered to proclaim party policies; and Mr.~Cham
beriain and Lord Rosebery are the unofficial
leaders whose support and co-operation are- in
dispensable In an ag-gressive campaign. Theiv
must be an agreement between the Prime Min
ister and Mr. Chamberlain, If the Unionist
party is to be rallied for. a decisive struggle
There also must be harmony on the Liberal side
if the Opposition are to return from the country
with a majority so helming as to be inde
pendent of the Irish Nationalists. One compro
mise is as difficult as the other, but the Unionist
rivals have a marked superiority in tactical Bkl'.i.
and are more likely to agree than Lord Rosebery
and Sir Henry Campbell -Bannerman.
The bailiff in either instance is the strong
man whose hand controls the party organiza
tion. Mr. Chamberlain has the party workers*
the local leaders, the newspapers and the cam
paign subscriptions on his side. There is a for
midable minority which has not been convlnred
that any departure from the traditional (Me
trade policy is advisable; but the majority ac
cept him as a fighting leader, who knows That
he wants and does not spend his time in beat
ing the air. Whether bin view? of imperial
policy and tariff revision are sound or unsound,
he has been sincere, courageous and consistent
in upholding them, and these qualities com
mand respect and excite enthusiasm. The rank
and file want definite, positive leadership, vhlch
enables them to know what they are fightinsr
for; and this is what Mr. Chamberlain .<>■? to
his followers. Mr. Balfour. With al! his clever
ness and dexterity as a tactician in Parliament,
has not thr art of meeting the plain, untutored
men of his party on their own level and making
public questions clear and Intelligible. In his
anxiety to keep tho party together and to pre
vent desertions among free trade Unionists, he
has refined his phrases and concealed his mean
ing with such subtlety that nobody hat under
stood where he stood. II has been a brilliant
display of dexterity and resource at "West
minster, but for the workers In th« local or
ganization it has been blind and confteing
leadership; and in their bewilderment ttiey have
turned to Mr. Chamberlain an : have been rr
invigorated by the bracing effect of a positive,
clearly defined policy.
Sir Henry Campbell- Banner:. tan. we n
pc>orer tactician than Mr. Balfour an.l a less
magnetic leader than Mr. Chamberlain. Is the
bailiff in possession of the Liberal estate. Rid;
enfeebled in health and Indolent by nature, he
might be expected to have slight inclination
for undertaking the harassing tares of leader
ship and high office. He Is, however, a sturdy
Scotsman, and that explains everything. A
Scotsman is not disposed to jrrve up anything
that he has honorably earned. Sir Henry Camp
bell-Bannerman did not warn the Liberal lead
ership when it was forced upon him; but sine
he has done the work, brought upon himself
much criticism and abuse ami now has a. supe
rior claim to the succession to the Prime M!:.
lster's office, he is bent upon having- what be
longs to him. Since Lord Spencer has been dis
abled by Illness the Liberal leader in the Com
mons will inevitably receive the first summon?
to form a new Ministry, after Mr. Balfour's
resignation or defeat in the general elections.
His claims cannot bo contested without a dis
ruption of the party, and on this account the
workers accept him as the necessary leader.
He is the man In possession of the responsibil
ities of leadership; and sine-- Glads;on:an Home
Rule was the supremo issue in two general elec
tions, he has taken it up as one of th- ass?t?
of the Liberal party. He has done this, when
Lord Rosebery, Mr. Asquith, Sir Edward Grey
and other conspicuous Liberals have emphati
cally declared that Home Rule must be kept in
the background as a disturbing t^ii'- 1 . an«l that
nothing must be done to repel or discourage th»
return of Liberal-Unionists Id the Liberal fold.
It is not good tactics, for It has forced Lori
Rosebery to separate himself at once from th?
Home Rule revival, and has created a dangerous
dissension on the free trade aide. Vet tb 3
bailiff's will is law. if he be bent upon enforcing
it, and thereby inviting Irish support at the ri?!;
of alienating free traders and Liberal recruit*
on many questions of the day.
Lord Rosebery is not a bailiff in possession,
nor is he an absentee statesman in the lonely
furrow. He is a power in reserve, with oratori
cal gifts unrivalled in either political parly, with
an attractive personality and with th" prestige
of high character and independence of thought.
He has the power of discerning the trend of
public opinion and of saying with authority
what the countrty wants to hear. Poor tacti
cian as he is in comparison with Mr. Chamber
lain or Mr. Balfour, he has unique influence in
public life. Radicals distrust and dislike him.
yet ho can do more than any other political
leader to bring about the reform most urgently
needed — the restriction of the legislative, powers'
of the House of Lords something that, lies a?
the basis of all other reforms. While Tl Is
doubtful whether a stable ministry ran b*
formed by Sir Henry Campbell-BaM
without his acquiescence. It is certain that with
a unanimous summons to the leadership Lord
Rosebery can bring together a coalition of tal
ents which will command respect. His los3st
friends in politics consider his ultimate return
to the Premiership inevitable after Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman shall have served for a
short period; but they admit that he must first
bo prepared to make sacrifices and to take th*
Foreign Office under his rival; and then In due
time will come, they add. the Ministry of all th»
Talents, with Lord Cromer In the Foreign Office.
Lord Kitchener at the War Offlee. Sir Edward
Grey at the Colonial Office and the Duke of
Devonshire re-enrolled as a Liberal Minister.
Progressive Radicals, however, are not lookins
for a Whig Saturnalia of this sort, but will be
content with a less Influential Ministry under
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.. with Mr. Lloyd
George and Mr. John Burns on the front bench
and Mr. John Morley in charge of education.
There is the same urgent need of conciliation
on either side in view of the close approach of
the general elections. The bailiffs. if they are
wise, will explain away some of their sharply
accentuated utterances and Invite co-operation
on the lines of least resistance. Mr. Chamber
lain Is already opening the way for Mr. Bal
four's approach to the views of the majority of
the Unionist party on Colonial preference a»d
tariff reform. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannermao.
with Sir Edward Grey us an intermediary, may
soon succeed in convincing the Liberal party
that he and Lord Roaebery are not far apart
when each is correctly understood, and that
when he talks about Horn* Rule It la not tb«
thoroughgoing Gladstonian policy that &• has
la mind, but merely an Instslmant of reprs-
