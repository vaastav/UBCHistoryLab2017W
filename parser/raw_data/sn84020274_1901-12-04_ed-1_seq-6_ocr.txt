Among recent postal advances the suc

It Is Just that the great agricultural pop

the service. The number of rural routes
now in operation Is 6.003, practically all es
tablished within three years, and there are
6.000 applications awaiting action. It Is ex

FOREiGN COMMENT
British and German Politicians and Newspapers Consider It of In
ternational Importance Lord Rothschild Thinks It May
Lead to a British Protective Tariff.
London. Dec. 3. Practically all the morn
ing papers here publish a long summary of
President Roosevelt's message to Congress.
The Dally Xews. In an editorial on the sub
ject, says:
at shows a bold man struggling with the
devilfish of party intrigue, and is in re
freshing contrast to the spread-eagleism of
the early period of American jingoism.
President Roosevelt has set himself a very
high ideal of conduct in public life, and he
has no doubt he will rise to it."
Most of the afternoon papers prefer to
await the publication of the text of Presi
dent Roosevelt's message rather than com
ment on the abridgment, made public here.
The Pall Mall Gazette, however, thinks the
message will "win the praises of all except
the Fenian clubs, to which Mr. Redmonct
is spouting sedition." It says that the ideas
contained In it are those of a "wise heao.
firmly set on Its shoulders."
Comparisons Drawn.
The Tall Mall Gazette highly approves ot
the President's suggestions relative to rr
pressKe measures to prevent, as the paper
puts it. "America from becoming the dump
ing ground of tpe blockheads and starv
lings of Europe." and remarks that there is
a contrast between this advocacy of
strengthen'ns restrictive measures and the
callous Indifference of the British legisla
tors to flooding the east end of London with
Indigent aliens.
The 'Westminster Gazette considers that
the reference to trusts "spells a good deal
of uncertainty for the American market,"
and adds: "The high tariff of the United,
States has created an artificial position un
der which the trusts have prospered There
fore, their business must be regulated arti
ficially." The St. James Gazette says: "It is grati
fying to find that the statesmen of a coun
try like the United States are not afraid to
make 'proposals on the subject of anarch-.
Ism, which, on the surface, are open to tne
criticism that they are subversive .of per
sonal liberty. There is no surer sign of true
statesmanship than the Insight which real
izes when a good theory becomes mischiev
ous 'In practice."
Lord Rothschild's Views.
"President Roosevelt's first message to
Congress." said Lord Rothschild to a repre
sentative of the Associated Press, "certain
ly seems statesmanlike, and'should produce.
a good effect in England, and the rest or
Europe, where its careful, friendly refer
ences to the other Powers will be much ap
preciated. But his declaration that recipro
city must be treated as the handmaiden of
protection will raise a howl here in Eng
land for protective duties. If reciprocity is.
only to be a handmaiden, it will not do
Ensland much cood. This enunciation will
set on foot an unprecedented agitation for
the restoration of at least partial protec
tion here."
Expects Ensllsh His;- Tariff.
"Do you think it at all likely to succeed?"'
Lord Rothschild was asked.
"Tes," he replied, "in spite of the historic
fetish of free trade, I would not be at all
surprised to Me protection return to Eng
land. What can we do? We have, got lit?

During these troubles our Government has
unswervingly advocated moderation, and has
materially aided In hrlnging about an ad

I J"y predecessor communicated to the
Congress the fact. that. the Weil ani La.
Abra av;ards against Mexico haw; been
adjudged by the highest courts of our coun
try to have been obtained throught fraud
and prejury on the part of the claimants
and that in accordance with the acts of
the Congress the money remaining In the
hands of the Secretary of State on these
awards has been returned to Mexico. A
eonlsJerablo portion of the money received
from Mexico on these awards had been
paid by this Government to the claimants
before the decision of the courts was
rendered. My Judgment is that the Con
gress should return to Mexico an amount
equal to the sums thus already paid to
the claimants. . . ,
The death of Queen Victoria caused the
people of the United States- deep and heart
felt sorrow, to which the Government gave
full expression. When President McKinley
died, our nation, in turn . received from ev

sions of grief and sympathy no less sincere.
The death of the Empress Dowager

ON THE MESSAGE.
and especially In view of President Roose
velt's conception of reciprocity."
The advice in the message to not hamper
"the captains of industry" met with Lord
Rothschild's warm approval, but he doubted
the effect of public subversion of corpora
tion finances, apparently holding the belief
that the publication of the profits secured
by these bodies would merely inflame the
opposition against them.
MESSAGE HAS INFLUENCE
ON THE GERMAN MARKETS.
Berlin, Dec. 2. The message of Pres
ident Roosevelt caused a mild thrill In Ger
many. On the Boerse, where It was eagerly
awaited, the message was received with un
common interest, and the market was
slightly stimulated upon the posting ot a
bulletin containing President Roosevelt's
utterances about trusts. The snares of the
steamship companies fell one or two points
on account of the Immigration Inspection
paragraph, and the proposed development
of the merchant marine.
Several financial Journals aver that there
is no reason why the United States should
encourage shipbuilding. They say that If
the United States becomes possessed of a
commercial fleet, she will have to build it.
Inasmuch as the attempts to buy German
lines of steamers have been defeated.
Restriction of Immluratlon.
President Roosevelt's words concerning
the restriction of immigration contain an
unpleasant suggestion in the present time
of depression, when, as the Berliner Volks
Zeltung says, the hard times make an over
flow of the laboring population of Europe
necessary.
The free trade and Liberal newspapers
welcome the reciprocity recommendations,
but regret that President Roosevelt did not
recommend a specific tariff reduction.
The first Impression of the President's
message In German official circles. Is that
the repression cf anarchists by Interna
tional agreement, is much more likely to
be carried through upon the initiative of
the Unlteo States than by that of any other
Power. An anti-anarchist proposition from
Germany, along the same lines as that of
Pmident Roosevelt, is probably already on
Us way to the State Department at Wash
ington. "Feet In Imperialistic Path."
The Vosslsche Zeltung says: "The Pres
ident's message indicates that the feet of
the United States are well In the Impe
rialistic path, and that ventures abroad
seem to agree with them."
The National Zeltung alludes to the
strong and confident tone used by Presi
dent Roosevelt, and to his large purposes.
Taking the message altogether, it has
been favorably received, both, popularly and
officially. The references It contains to the
late Empress Frederick are especially ap
preciated. Sales at Jfew York.

GOLF CLUBS UNITE
TO PROMOTE GAME.
JTine Organizations Form Associa
tion to Foster Interclub and
Open Tournaments.
Representatives of the golf clubs of St.
Louis met at the office of Mr. J. G. McGee.
No. 919 Chestnut street yesterday and or
ganized the St. Louis Golf Association. This
body Is composed of nine golf clubs licatod
about the city .The following gentlemen were,
elected to serie as officers and directors. It
will be observed that each club in the as
sociation is represerted by a director.
OFFICERS.
John S. Carter, president: George S. Mc
Grew, vice president; Walter Gilliam, sec
retary and treasurer.
DIRECTORS.
J. S. Carter, St. Louis Field Club; Geor;e
S. McGrew, Glen Echo Club; W. Gilliam.
Normandy Park Club; Duncan Joy, St.
Louis Country Club; Walter McKittrick.

Carter, St. Louis Amateur Athletic Asso
ciation. J G. McGee. Fair Grounds Associa
tion; C. Norman Jones. Log Cabin Club;
Burt P. 3IcKlnnie, Algonquin Club.
An Executive Committee of three direc
tors will be appointed by the president, as
well as a Tournament Committee, also of
three directors. The annual dues of the
association will be HO for each club. The
most important point about the association
and the one which will work most good is
its announced object. The preamble sets
forth that the aim of the association
will be the regulation of all matters per
taining to interclub solf. the encouragement
of tho same and the promotion cf
friendly Intercourse and contests be
tween the members of the various clubs.
The constitution further specifies that it
shall hold each year such tournaments as
the directors may deem expedient, to do all
In Its power to promote the game of golf,
and. for the general good of the sport, at
tract to It such persons as may reflect
credit upen It.
The objects of the St. LouIS'Golf Assocla,
tlon are laudable indeed. The Pity is that
this association was not formed four years
ago. Had it been in existence during this
time the game of golf would be much
farther advanced than It is at present in
St. Louis.
For some years The Republic has been
steadfastly urging the formation of such an
association, it has been too painfully evi
dent that there was too much club selfish
ness, too much family playing about St.
Louis, and too little of the true golf con
test. A few small semi-private inter-club
matches, one general tournament, held in
a bad week during the Horse Show and
there you are. The golfers of St. Louis,
whether for shame of their game or innate
modesty, have despised publicity and
shunned anything save most private
matches. As a result, the game about St.
Louis became a quiet, family amusement
much In the same nature as a croquet party
on the lawn of a residence. There was no
competition of a public nature, and when
such a thing did come up It actually as
sumed the appearance of a family affair.
While golfers naturally love to pick up the
sharp or the pleasant individual match, and
whl.e no one wants to-be a slave to his club
captain and play club matches every Satur
day, two club matches a month, would not
kill any one; would improve the game of all
competitors and would promote the best In
terests of golf In many ways.
Then there Is the individual tournament
open to all comers, which is after all the
golf In Its highest phase. For no one need
play who does not desire to do so. and the
piay ot tne maiviauai snows to cetier ad
vantage than In team matches.
At present there is but one open tourney
held 1b St. Louis that for the championship
1 of The Republic Cup. While this tourna
I ment will always hold precedence over oth
I ers there is no reascn why there should not
be a couple of tournaments, open to all,
held during the spring and fall. Clubs can
secure certain cups open to competition, and
each year these cups can be played for over
tne same courses.

inaeea at tne nanas 01 tne association, in
the past they ha-e been far truer golfers
than their brothers, and, indeed, they havo
had slight assistance from the latter.
The new association will see that some
system, some formality, some Importance, Is
attached to matches, and that things are
done In a proper manner. It Is of belated
birth, but none the less welcome. It might
have been able to work a deal of good the
opportunity to do which is now gone. But
there is still a lot of chance to do good left,
and the association Is calculated to do it.

SECOXD DAY OF FIELD TRIALS.
Final Brace In Derby To-Day Point

REPUBLIC SPECIAL.
Glasgow, Mo., Dec. 3. The second day of
the Western Field Trials Association opened
cold and raw, but with good atendance, in
cluding a number of ladies on horseback.
who followed the dogs closely. The condi
tions were good for bird work, and some
excellent pointing was done. Birds were
scarce, owing to the cold weather, which
drove them to shelter, but each brace found
birds to work with.
The first series on the Derby was finished
this morning by running Prince Rodney
with Alpine Lad; Lady Maud Mannerlng
a bye.
The second series ran as follows: Sister's
Babe with Perclval Jingo'; Cuba. Jr., with
Verona B-: Alpine Lad with Ortiz King;
Prince Rodney with Pretty Sine. The point
work done was generally superior to that of
yesterday. Prince Rodney, who ran with
Alpine Lad, did more point work than any
dog yet in the field. Lady Maud Mannerlng
failed to do any point work. Sister's Babe
and Percival Jingo were perhaps the fastest
brace In the field. Jingo having a slight
lead in point work. Cuba. Jr., and Verina
B. were the next brace. Cuba doing all the
point work. Ortiz King and Alpine Lad
ran next, the latter having the advantage
in point work. . .
In range and speed they were fairly well
matched. If Alpine Lad keep3 up in point
work he will run for first money.
The final brace in the Derby will be tun
in the morning. ...,.
So far the pointers have the lad. The
drawing for the all-age contest to be run
to-morrow has not yet been held.

TROUBLE FOR NEW LEAGUE.
Opposition Expected to Show Hand
at Meeting at St. Joseph.
REPUBLIC SPECIAL. '
St. Joseph. Mo., Dec. 2. It Is not Improb
able that a movement toward the disrup
tion of the American Association will take
Place at the meeting of the Western League
magnates which will he held in this clty
Wedcesday atternoon.
W. T. Van Brunt, owr.er of the St. Joseph
franchise, refuses to discuss the situation.
but he Is known to have been sounding cer
tain western league magnates, with
sue magnates, with a "Of e to you tne precioas am ". Tfrin" oromi"'. but who possess no genu
, of setting them into of imitators and impostors who e n allurln pronu--- u i wh

mo n,..v un i.c us-uiuu. .hi .'""
movement, ne is tnougnt to rely to a con-
siderable extent upon the support of Rourke
of Omaha and Eurns of Colorado Springs.
It is generally believed here that Rourke
went Into the new association because ha
feared that Owner Van Brunt would not
fight for the retention of the old Western
League The stand taken by Owner Van
Brunt has been such as to reassure Presi
dent Rourke. and it can be stated on good
authority that he will vote in favor of
maintaining the Western League. Just what
stand Burns may take is not known, but it
is known that he will attend the meeting
here. Burns is a close friend of Van Brunt,
aa well as of Rourke. The trio will un
doubtedly work in harmony.
MAXY DESERTERS THIS YEAR.
Philadelphia and St. Louis Nationals
lilt Hardest.
The personnel of the American League
teams for 1501 only tend to give official
color to what has been known for a long
time concerning the wnoksale defection ot
National League players. The St: Louis
and Philadelphia National League clubs
have been stripped of nearly all the good
material. President Robison will make a
light to retain Jack Harper and still be
lieves that Wallace is not wholly lost to
him. But he has been hit hard in the
desertion of Burkett. Heidrick, Padden and
Powell. Manager Patsy Donovan Is mak
ing a game tlgnt against the odds, and has
already gathered a team that is te has tha
quantity, but time alone will tell whether
he has the quality.
The Philadelphia club is not recovering
from the mortal blow struck by Ed Dele
hanty. who. according to popular belief,
acted as the American League agent in ar
ranging for the desertion of Colonel Rogers'
best men. According to Tom Loftus. Dele
hanty will be a Wasnington suburbanite
next year. Harry Wolverton is slated for
an infield position on the same team. Lof
tus has also secured, if the reports be true,
the services of two of Shettsline's best
pitchers Orth and Townsend. The latter
thougn not yet of age made a good record
with the Quakers last season.
Connie Mack announces that some of the
better-known Quakers will perform nith
the Athletics next year. Among bis twirlers
he includes Duggleby. who was a Xational
Leaguer last year. In his Infield is Monte
Cross, the old St. Louis player, who will
do stunts with the otner ball tosser of his
own name Lave Cress. In the outfield
Elmer Flick will loom up as a power, be
tween the Washington and Philadelpnia
American League teams, the flower of
Colonel Rogers's brlsade of 1S01 seems about
evenly divided.
Charley Coraiskey also claims seeral or
last year's Xational League performers, in
cluding Eddie McFarland of Philadelphia.
Tom Daly at Brooklyn. George Davis ot
Xew York, Roger Denzer of New York and
Danny Green of Chicago. Comlskey Is con
fident that all these men will be with him
next serins, but Manaeer William Rourke
of the Omaha club says that Roger will per
form In Omaha next season, "lopsy" riart
sel Is another whose ultimate location is
still largely a matter of speculation.
Manager Donovan will be kept busy train
ing his new material, which looks promis
ing, but Is still a long way from seasoned.
Donovan will be the veteran of the team,
and In the outer garden will be associated
with Smoot and Barclay, two minor
leaguers. The Infield, with "Germany"
Hartman at third and Jack Farrell at sec
ond, will not be the weak comer 39 has
,been prophesied. Richardson can hardly be
said to possess major league exp.ritn.e, and
Kruger will have all he can no to fill tha
part which Wallace played last year. The
twirling staff is well supplied the quantity
Is there, but the quality remains to be
demonstrated. Murphy and Harper are the
only ones who have had a season's experi
ence In fast company, and of the latter
Donovan Is not sure. Wicker, Joyce and
Yerkes are still colts with a straggling bit
of work In the major league, wmle Alle
mang and Dunham are still unknown quan
tities, as it is not proved mat tcey nave Dig
league speed. Nichols and Ryan are as
good a pair of catchers behind the bat as
are needed, but neither is strong with the
willow. Young John O'Neill completes the
receiving end of the batteries.
Wiley Dunham, who has cast his lot with
the Cardinals, was signed by Manager Wil
liam Armour ot Dayton in 13C4, but did not
begin active work until last seaon. He has
the makeup of a natural athlete, and his
adroitness attracted general attention.
When Armour signed the youngster, nis
pitching was wild, but a season's rest
brought him back in snape. lie tnrows a
haru. fast ball. Dunham Is an Onto oov
and resides In a small town near Columbus.
