CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS.
Tjik Forty -seventh Congress convened .-it
noon on the 5th, Senator David Davis presid
ing. But few .Senators were present and tlio
proceedings of that body were devoid of es
pecial interest. A number of bills were in
troduced, among them the following: By Mr.
Sherman—To provide for the issue of three
per cent, bonds, to bo applied solelv to the
redemption of three and one-half per cent,
bonds ; by Mr. Garland—For the appointment
of a commissioner to investigate the ques
tions of the tariff and revenue laws; by Mr.
Beck—For retiring trade dollars and recoin
ing them into standard silver dollars ; by Mr.
Logan—To place (Jen. 17. S. Grant upon the
retired list of the army. Mr. Edmonds offered
a resolution to continue the committees as
they existed last session. Mr. Pug h
Moved an amendment, authorizing the
President of the Senate to decide
whether the committees shall be equally or
otherwise divided between the two political
parties. Laid over without action, and the
Senate adjourned The House was called
to order by Clerk Adams. The roll-call
showed 290 Representatives present, the ab
sentees being Morey, Scales, Mills and Deus
ter. Nominations for Speaker being in order,
Reifer was put in nomination by liobinson.
Randall by House, and Ford by Murch. Bur
rows of Michigan, Holman, McCook and
Ladd were appointed tellers. The roll was
called and the result was as follows: Whole
number of votes, 285; neeessarv for choice,
14:5. For Keifer Us, Randall 12 !i, Ford 8. None
of the candidates voted. Those voting for
Ford were: Brennan, Burrows of Michigan,
H. A. Hiizeltiue, James of Texas, Ladd of
Wisconsin, Grave and Murch of Missouri.
Fulkerson and l'aul of Virginia, Readjusters,
voted for Keifer. The result having been an
nounced, Keifer was escorted to the Speaker's
chair by Randall and Hiscock and took the
oath of office, which was administered by
Kclley of Pennsylvania, as the oldest member
in point of service. The swearing in of mem
bers then took place. Objections were mad«;
to several, who were compelled to stand
aside, but except in the cases of Chalmers of
Mississippi and Dibble of South Carolina, the
objections were subsequently withdrawn
Tin- other Republican caucus nominees'
were then duly elected and the House was
declared duly organized. After appointing
the usual committee to wait upon the Presi
dent, the House adjourned.
T he President's Message was delivered to
Congress on the Gtli. Among t lie bills intro
duced in the Senate were two for admission
of Dakota as a State. Senator Davis, vacating
the chair in favor of Mr. Harns, spoke at some
length in regard to his position as President
Ëro tem. The occasion was the calling up by
r. Edmunds of his resolution providing for
the continuance of committees as thev
existed at the close of last session.
In the course of his remarks Mr. Davis said:
" Last spring I took occasion to state
the reasons why mv voteä should
be given to sustain the exist
ing organization of the Senate.
Although circumstances have materially
changed since that time, the obligation which
I voluntarily assumed has not been altered;
hence I adhere to that declaration, always
reserving to myself the right of rejecting àn
offensive candidat«." This expression of Mr.
Davis's views is regarded as settling for
the next two years the status of the
Senate officers, unless death should make a
change, giving the Republican party apos
l'lvo m-ijority The proceedings of the
House were devoid of interest, the drawing of
seats occupying the greater part of the session.
The House adjourned till Friday.
Ox th* 7th, Senators Sherman, Pendletom
Davies, Lapham, Bayard and Morgan were
appointed a joint committee for the prepara
tion of a memorial upon the death oi the late
President .Garfield. Bills were introduced
and referred : For the admission of New
Mexico as a State; compensating railway
companies for transporting mails; establish
ing a Department of Agriculture and Com
merce; making trade dollars legal tender for
all debts except where otherwise stipulated.
Mr. Morrill's Tariff Commission was then de
clared in order, but that gentleman declined
to speak, and the Senate adjourned.
Senator Morrill addressed the Senate,
on the 8th, upon the Tariff Commission bill.
H© said our nearest approaches to free trade
had been seasons of national disaster, as were
the years 1833, '47 and '57, and the further we
had receded from free trade the better had
labor fared and the greater had been the ma
terial and educational advancement of the
country. At the conclusion of his remarks,
31r. Morrill moved a reference of the subject
to the Committee 011 Finance, but at the sug
gestion of Mr. Garland, who desired to be
heard on the subject, withdrew his motion.
The latter temporarily yielded the floor for
some general business, and the subject was
formally passed over for the present. The
1 resident pro tem. submitted a response bv
the Secretary of the Interior to the Senate
resolution, transmitting a list of the names of
officers, clerks and other employees 011 the
rolls of the department, with the salary, date
of appointment and grade of office, each State
to which charged, and indicating who served
m the Union and who in the Confederate
armies. Tabled and ordered printed. Among
bills introduced were the following: by Mr.
Vest—For a bridge across the Mississippi
River at the most acceptable point from five
to eight miles above St. Louis; by Mr. I11

CRIMES AND CASUALTIES.
Three lads were killed by the fall
ing of the floor of St. Mary's Church Sun
day-school building in New York City.
The floor had been previously weakened by
fire.
Warren Woodward , son of the late
Judge Warren J. Woodward, of Pennsyl
vania, committed suicide at Heading, Pa.,
by shooting himself through the head. He
was a young man of more than ordinary
ability, but of infirm health.
Wm. Allen, a negro, was lynched at
Norfolk, Va., for the murder of Wm.Sclater,
a white farmer.
A nitro-glycerine explosion at
Eagle Lake, on the Thunder Bay Division
of the Canada Pacific Railway, killed Dun
can McMillan and William Cornell. They
wer .3 blown to atoms.
Hiram and Valentine Mercer, broth
ers, shot and killed a deputy Sheriff and
wounded another officer, in Decatur Coun
tp, Iowa, on the 16th of November last.
They subsequently fled to Missouri, taking
up their residence with another brother)
who owns a farm near Eau de Vie, Christian
County. A reward of $1,200 was offered
forthe capture of these desperadoes. A
few days since an officer from Iowa, assist
ed by the Sheriff of Christian County and
a small posse, attempted their capture by
strategy. The plan succeeded so far as to
draw the desperadoes into an ambush pre
pared for them by the officers, but both re
fused to surrender and showed light,where
upon they were shot down, one being in
stantly killed and the other dying within a
few minutes.
MISCELLANEOUS.
A number of experts were called to
the stand in the Guiteau casa on the 5th.
Most of these were gentlemen who had
closely watched the prisoner as spectators
during the trial, and bad therefore had a
good opportunity of judging of his mental
ch*racteristics. Dr. Kennoti, editor of the
Chicago Medical Hevieio, gave his opinion
unequivocally that the prisoner was insane.
Witness based his judgment of Guiteau's
insanity upon the hereditary taint, upon the
impairment of Judgment, upon the exalta
tion of the emotions, and upon inspiration,
which also included the motive. Witness
admitted that when a man committed a
crime while acting under the delusion of
Divine inspiration and then conducted him
self precisely as a criminal would do, it
would be presumptive evidence against his
insanity. Dr. Charles H. Nicholas, of the
Bloomingdale Asylum, replied to a hypo
thetical question proposed by Scoville: "If
the evidence to which I have listened is cor
rect, I should say that the prisoner is in
sane." Dr. Folsom, of Boston, Dr. God
ding, of the Government Insane Asylum,
Washington, Dr. McBride, of Milwaukee,
and Dr. Cbanning, of Brookline, Mass.,
cöncurred substantially in the opinion
of Dr. Kennon. President Arthur, who
was subpoenaed by the defense, was not
called to the stand, but submitted his writ
ten answers to several interrogatories. The
substance of his replies was: He knows the
prisoner, havi B g seen him at least ten times,
possibly twice that number; bad neve-- eon
versed with him "excepting to return the
ordinary salutation oi the day, and once or
twice in answer to his request to be employ
the defense to produce a letter written by
the prisoner since his indictment; that let
ter was received by me in October last, and
was not preserved. I do not recollect its
ed in the campaign as a speaker by the Re
publican .State Committee, of which I was
Chairman." To the question: "What polit
ical service the prisoner had rendered the
Republican party during the last Presiden
tial campaign?" the answer is: "None that I
know of." To the question whether there was
anything in the prisoner's relations to him
self or Gen. Grant, or Senator Conkling, or
any of the others of the Republican party,
socially or politically, to furnish him with
any ground for supposing he would receive
any political preferment, the answer is
"No." Prisoner. "That is a matter of
opinion. " The last question was: "Did
you ever give him any reason to think that
he could have any political or personal in
fluence with you?" Answer: "I neverdid."
Prisoner. "He never had occasion to." The
President adds to his answers the following:
''I have been requested by counsel for
contents particularly, excepting that it con
tained some claim of his having rendered
some important services to the Republican
party during the Presidential campaign.
»»d an appeal for postponement of his trial
to give him time to prepare for defense."
Prisoner. "That is all there was to it."
The Ring Theater, the principal place
of amusement at Vienna, was consumed by
j tire on the evening of the Sth and a large
! number of persons perished in the tlimes or
were trampled to death in the frantic ef
forts of the audience to secure an exit. The
fire broke out on the stage just before the
time for the curtain to rise, and is said to
have been caused by the falling of a kerosene
lamp. lu a brief moment the curtain and
scenery were enveloped in flames and soon
after there was ail explosion of gas. The
audience were naturjilly panic-stricken and
the ordinary exits became blocked by a strug
gling mass of humanity. A large number
leaped from the windows to the pavements
below, where sheets were stretched to break
their fall. The number of lives lost is es
timated at from 150 to 200.
The great Wabash Railway bridge,
spanning the Missouri River at St. Charles,
again went down, on the evening of the 8th,
precipitating an eniire freight train of some
j thirty cars sixty-live feet into the river be
low. The engineer, .lack Kirksbv, fireman
Chamberlain, and one other employee took
! the terrible plunge, but strange to say two
| 0 f them escaped without serious injury.
j Engineer Kirksby was either killed by the
fall or drowned. His fireman came out of
! the cab to the surface and was rescued,
' Several stock men leaped from the
I caboose in time to save themselves
! as they saw the front of the
train plunging into the abyss. It was two
years ago 011 the Sth of November that a
similar disaster occurred. That time it was
the third span ; this time it was the first
span that succumbed. A month ago the
State Railroad Commissioners made a report
that the bridge was perfectly safe, and only
a day previous to the accident it is said one
of the Commissioners inspected the strue
ure and went away seemingly satisfied. It
was estimated by the officers of the road
that wou1l1 take a week or more to erect a
t(ira P orar y trestle-work to permit the pas

Report of tho Comptroller of the Cur
rency.
W ashington , December s.
The Comptroller of the Currency, in his
nnnual report, says the recent failure of the
Mechanics' Bank, Newark, has called the
attention of the public directly to the duties
of Bank Directors and of Examiners of Na
tional Banks. Sections of the Revised
Statutes and by-laws of the National Banks
are cited, and the report continues:
is i plainly defined, and, however innocent they
of j may be of any intention to wrong, thev are
responsible for the safety of the funds com
j an " of them e had C n r oti(e f oMl t legal be transac
j tions, it is a serious question whether thev
i are not legally bound to make good the

"The duty of a Board of Directors is
whether they are not also liable for losses
which may occur from neglect of duty,
even without notice. If this is nota just
and proper construction of the present law,
then it becomes a question for the consid
eration of Congress whether additional leg
islation upon this subject is not required.
The Examiner can have but limited knowl
edge of tlie habits and character of those
employed in a bank. If the Teller is mak
ing false entries, and daily abstracting the
funds of the bank: if a book-keeper is
keeping false accounts, and render
ing untrue statements; if the Cashier
is placing forged paper among the bills re
ceivable and upon the register-books, and
transmitting such paper to distant places
where it is purported to be payable, it is not
possible for the Examiner in a day or two
to unravel this evil work, which may have
continued for months, and obtain a correct
balance sheet. Examinations should be
periodically made by a competent commit
tee, selected from the Board of Directors.
They have the whole resources of the bank
at their command, and if they have anv rea
eon to suspect dishonesty or fraud, it is
their business to investigate thoroughly,
and they should employ experts to assist
them in so doing. The Directory must
continuou^y look after its own serv
ants. The Examiner looks after the
acts of the Directors. The report of
the Examiner is confidential. It is
for the use of the Comptroller's otiice only,
and is in no sense a certificate of the good
condition of a bank. In many instances the
capital stock of a bank has thus been found
to be impaired and the deficiency been made
good without the knowledge of' the general
public. In other instances banks have been
obliged to pass their usual dividends, using
their earning to liquidate all bad and doubt
ful debts. The number of banks passing
dividends the present vear is 175; in lsji)
230; in 1879, 304, and "in 1878, 343. Hun
dreds of instances occurred annually, and
many are occurring daily, wherein banks,
under the reports of Examiners, are notified
of violations of the act and are brought un
der discipline of the law. The records of
this office show only one among all the. Ex
aminers ever appointed who has been found
guilty of any wrong-doing."

Referring to the subject of the standardef

" I concur in the views of my predecessor,

were rejected, shows the standard is so ligh

Academic Board to permit the discontnu

course for the purpose of giving tim; for
others, the importance of which was appar

gested by this recommendation leads ne to
believe it would be best to extend the course
so as to cover five years. It is believei that
by so doing not only would the beneits of
the academy be more widely extended, but
that the graduates would be prepaid to
render better service to the country.'
The actual expenditures under tie War

$4,323,000; public buildings and gr>unds in

over expenditures should continue as during
the past year, its application to the payment of
the bonds can be made at the discretion of the
secretary, and to that extent the Government
will be relieved from the necessity of paving
any premium of consequent redemption of its
bonded debt."
Concerning future refunding measures the
report, while making 110 recommendations
declares that it fears short-term bonds bearing
a lower rate than 3' s per cent, cannot be mar

they be made not shorter than ten-year obliga
