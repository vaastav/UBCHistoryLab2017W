SOUTH AMERICAN NEWS.
Over One Hundred Ponple Killed In a
Riot In La Vox, Bolivia.
San Fbanoisco, Dee. 3. By the Panama
stevner which arrived at this port Sunday
advices came from Peru that the Indians in
the interior of that country are committing
dreadful outrages. A priest has been killed,
having been stoned to death, and bis mother,
who came to bis assistance, was killed and
her bead cut off. Another woman, who
tried to save ber, was stabbed to death. Tbe
three bodies were then thrown into the
river. '
; At La Paz at attempt to lead a movement
for Cornancho, the revolutionist leader, pre
cipitated a riot, resulting in tho killing of
110 men, women and children, besides
wounding fifty others. . N
. : Dead Id a Straw Stack. '
Lebanon, Ind.. Dec a A great deal of
excitement has been caused in this place and
. vicinity over the finding ot a dead human
body imbedded in a straw stack on John
Routhe's farm, four miles west of this city.
Tbe body when found was in a state of
putrefaction,, and when removed from its
resting place . the lower limbs and arms
r dropped off. From papers on the person of
the deceased the body was identified to be
that of Doe Montgomery, who has been min
ing: for tba last four ' or five weeks, but
' nothing had been thought of his long con
tinued abeenoe, owing to the fact that at the
time of bis first disappearance be had been on
drunken spree for several days and was in
the habit staying away from bis borne while
In an intoxicated condition. Upon his per
son was found an empty bottle labeled laud-,
anum, and it is probable- that to this drug
' can bo attributed bis death. The deceased
was about thirty-five years of age and leaves
m wife and small family.
