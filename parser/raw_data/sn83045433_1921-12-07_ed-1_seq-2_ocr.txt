Declaring that the law shall be
enforced as it Is conceived and writ
ten, and always without fear and
favor, Guy D. Goff, assistant to
he Attorney General, last night
pledged, in , an address-before the
:wentieth annual convention of the
\nti-Saloon League of America, at
the First Cqngregation Church,
Tenth and G streets northwest, that
'insofar as ft lies within the power
the Department of Justice to en
orce the law of the land there will

the mandate of the people."
"The law stands, proclaiming
Thou shalt not break.' and when
that commandment is broken the
nation should bend its efforts to see
that atonement is made," Mr. Goff
declared. "The quickest and surest
way of setting any law at naught is
to relax Its enforcement; while the
quickest and surest way to instill
respect for the law is to vigorously
press its enforcement."
