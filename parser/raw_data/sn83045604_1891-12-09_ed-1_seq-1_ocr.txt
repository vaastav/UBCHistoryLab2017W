THE HOUSE ORGANIZES.

Full Democratic Vote.
SIMPSON HAS A CANDIDATE.
Crisp Opposed to Free Silver, Though
He Will Not Declare Himself.
Senate Committees Thrown Into Disor-

Senatorial Caucus Elects Gorman
Chairman—Mugwumps Angry.
WASHINGTON CITY, Dec. B.—The excited
f?e!inirs so apparent throughout the speak
ership contest had no part in the proceed
ings of the House today. When MeMillin
appeare i many members who had not
been with him during the light rushed up
to shake hands and tell him he hail made
a good stand against the inevitable.
Springer had on his coat lapel a bright
scarlet pink, which had been the emblem
of his campaign. Having cast his vote
and influence to Crisp, he was in high fa
vor with the victors. When nominations
for speaker were made this morning that
of Reed was the only one greeted with ap
plause.
Jerry Simpson, for the Farmers' Al
liance party of nine, nominated Watson
of (ieorgia. and a smile spread over the
House. When Holnian placed Crisp in
nomination the Democrats reserved their
applause for the moment when he should
be declared elected and escorted into the
House, but at the name of Reed the
eighty-three Republicans made all the
noise consistent with their number, and
their votes were cast in peculiarly loud
voices, to show they were there.
During the rollcall Mills stood back be
hind the rail on the Democratic side, and
when his name was called voted with his
usual depth of voice and earnestness of
manner. Hoar and Williams, of Massa
chusetts, who were Mills' most active
workers, did not vote. The silence on the
Democratic side remained unbroken while
the tellers counted the vote: Crisp 238,
Reed 83, and Watson 8, but when the clerk
announced Crisp elected speaker a wild
burst of applause fiiled the House. As
Mills and Reed conducted the speaker to
the chair all the members stood in their
places, clapping their hands and cheering.
IN THE HOUSE.
Crisp Elected Speaker—Other Officers
Chosen—Eight Alliance Votes.
WASHINGTON CITY, Dec. B.—When the House
convened this morning there was a lartje crowd
present. At noon Clerk McPherson called that
body to order, and, on the motion of Holrnnn,
the election of speaker wns proceeded with.
Holmati pljcod in nomination Crisp of Georgia
Henderson of Illinois nominated Thomas B.
Reed. [Appiause on the Republican side.]
Jerry Simpson of Kansas ncmineted Thomas
U. Watson of Georgia. Tellers were appointed
and balloting commenced.
The roll call resulted: Crisp 228, Reed 83,
Watson 8. Mills and Sprineer were heartily ap
plauded when they recorded their votes for
Crisp.
The clerk, having anuounced the result, de
clared Crisp duly elected speaker, amid a storm
of applause. The clerk then appointed Mills
and Keed as a committee to escort the newly
elected speaker to the chair, an appointment
that was received with applause not unmixed
with laughter. In a few moments Crisp en
tered, with ilills and Heed supporting him ou
either arm, and his march dowu the aisle was a
perfect ovation. The Democrats in a mass rose
and save him cheer after cheer, and the Repub
lican members also rose. When quiet-was se
cured Cri«p said:
Gentlemen of tie. House of Reprfsrntatirei: For
the great honor you have conierred upon me I
return heartfelt thanks. 1 shall endeavor to
discharge the office of speaker with courtesy and
with firmness and with impartiality. [Ap
plause.] Let us unite :n the hope that our la
bors here may result in the advancement of the
prosperity, honor and glory of our beloved coun
try. [Avviause.] lam now ready to take the
oath of office.
The oath of office having been administered
by Holman ot Indiana, the work of swearing in
the members of the Fiity-secoDd congress then
betran. \Vhtti this had been concluded a resolu
tion for the appointment of Kerr for clerk,
Yoder for sergeant-at-arins. Turner for door
keeper and Daltun for postmaster were pre
sented. Henderson of Illinois offered a? a sub
stitute a resolution for tha appointment of the
present officers with the exception of chaplain,
for which office Charles B. Ramsdell was
named. Disagreed to.
llolman's resolution was agreed to, with an
amendment offered by Springer for the appoint
ment of William H. Millburn as chaplain. The
newly elected officers were then sworn in, and a
resolution was adopted directing the clerk to
iui rm the president of the election of speaker
and clerk. The sjKi.iker appointed Blount, Keed
and Breckinridge of Kentucky as a committee
to join a similar one from the Senate to inform
the president that congress was in session with
a quorum present, ihe clerk was directed to
ir.tortn the Senate that the House had elected
its speaker, and a quorum being present it was
now ready for the transaction of business.
A resolution was adopted directing the speaker
to appoint committees on rule", accounts, en
rolled bills and mileage, each to consist of the
same number of nieirberi as in the Fiftieth
congress, a d referring the rules of the last
c> • gress to the committee on rules.
It was ordered that the daily hour ot meeting
of the House shall be I'.' o'clock.
The House then proceeded to the drawing for
seats. A resolution, the effect ot which was
to oermit Heed, liolman and O'Neill of Penn
sylvania, to select their seats in advance, was
adopted. At the conclusion of the call the
House adjourned.

The Trial of Dr. Graves.
DENVER, Dec. B.—The trial of Dr. Graves,
charge 1 with the murder of Mrs. P.arnabv, was
resumed today. District Attorney Stevens made
the openiug address. He gave a graphic ac
count of Mrs. Barnaby's life from her marriage,
her friendship for Graves and final misunder
standing:, and the unfortunate trip West and
death in this city. He then proceeded to show
the jury upon what facts and circumstances he
relied for the conviction of defendant. He said:
It is a fact, which we will establish to your
satisfaction, that at the time Mrs. Baraaby
reached Denver on this last fatal trip it was
her intention to take from Dr. Graves ail her
property and money in his control and invest
it in business thoroughly, and that she was also
seriously thinking of changing her will end
cutting off Graves, who was n beneficiary to the
extent of fc!>.ooo. and also drawing an'annual
s».!ary from her of $">,000. We are prepared to
prove that the package containing the fatal bot
tle mailed in Boston was stamped with stamps
purchased in Providence, and it is evident
this was doue for the purpose of misleading the
recipient. The aduress and inscription on the
package were in a disguised handwrit
ing, which we are satisfied wo will
Vie able to prove to you is the hand of
Dr. Graves. We will show you, gentlemen, that
Dr. Graves is the only person in the word who
could have any motive for the destruction of
this lady. We will show by circumstantial evi
dence that this bottle of tiin foulest solution was
prepared and mailed by defendant. We propose
that this } rosecution will stand upon its merits
without regard to what the defense interpose*.
Solving a Chicago Murder Mystery.
CHICAOO. Dec. 8. —The mystery of the murder
of Mrs. Leggenhager and son two weeks ago,
was partly cleared up today, and Herman
Kraatz is under arrest, accused of being one of
the perpetrators of the double murder. The
police and the coroner have been at variance as
to whether the mother or son suicided after
slaying the other, or whether both were mur
dered by a thief or a desperate debtor.
Today, when the inquest was almost finished,
Kraatz betrayed nervousueas upon being ques
tioned about his financial relations w.th Mrs.
Leggeuhager, as well as his movements at the
time of btsr death. The probable method of
murder has been brought to light by the discov
ery of a robe in the room where the bodies lay.
It is believed the mother and son were smoth
ered to death. Kraatz is the husbind of the
dead woman's stepdaughter. The police are in
vestigate ng the whercaoouts of his two brothers,
neither of whom has an enviable record. A
curious fact is tnat Kraatz'H father and uncle
rears ago fought each other with knlrcs after a
quarrel. The uncle killed his man, went insane
and died in an asylum. What relation, if any,
Kraatz's wifo his to the murder of her -tup
mother and brother does n't appear, but it is
known that the rirl hal bitterly complained of
the dead woman's reysterions habits.

AU the Sea-Going Men-of-Wa* of the
American Navy Being Made Ready—
Hurrying Work on the San Fran-
Cisco.
WASHINGTON CITY. Dec. B.— The presi
dent's coming message to congress will
have one sensational feature. The Chil
ean chapter wiii be the most vigorous ut
terance that has been contained in an ex
ecutive message for a long while. It will
show that the seriousness of the situation
has at no time been underestimated
by the president and Secretary Blaine.
There will be no hint of recalling Min
ister Egan. If anything is to be said upon
that point it will be more likely a word of
praise than anything else. The question
on which the president wants to give con
gress the fullest information reir.tes to the
attack on the sailors of the Baltimore and
the unsatisfactory action taken by the Chil
ean government. The ditlerence between
that attack and the New Orleans lynching
will be fuily explained, and then a hint
will be given that it may yet become
necessary to present an ultimatum to the
Chilean government.
Every naval commandant of the United
States has received instructions to lit out
and get in commission all seagoing men
of-war lying in American waters, and the
result is two powerful ileets now have their
bows turned toward the south. Presi
dent Harrison will probably hint
to congress the steps which it
may be necessary for the United
States to take in order to insure repara
tion, the meaning of which is three-fold:
Indemnity for the outrage, punishment
of the ollenders and apologies to the ilag
insulted.
The cabinet met today as usual, but the
session was a short one, the state, war
and treasury departments not being repre
sented.

WASHINGTON CITY, Dec. B.—The departure of

other Indians have been very ugly. No actual
hostilities have yet occurred. A number of
