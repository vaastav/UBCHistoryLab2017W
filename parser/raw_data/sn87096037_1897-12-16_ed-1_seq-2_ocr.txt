John Wanamaker, of Philadelphia,
who i^tine of the heaviest and most un

his method is simple: "My plan for 20

There are many ways to advertise, but
Mr. Wanamaker sticks to one, and is
satisfied with It.
The old gold-brick game has just been,
played in Cleveland, only with varia
tions adapted to the times. A saloon
keeper of that enterprising city was in
duced to part with $12,000 of his good
money for 67 pounds of brass filings
and sand, palmed off on the poor fellow

According to the government report,
the number of money order offices iu
the country is 20,000, as against 9.382 re
ported in 1S90, and this does not include
the J,051 limited offices where orders
arc limited to sums not over five dollars.
The amount of orders issued last year
was $175,000,000. In this branch of
Uncle Sam's business there wasa profit
last fiscal year of $790,230, which is do
ing very well. Steps will be taken to
greatly increase the number of offices
and the business.
It appears that there is not a single
st ate nor territory in the union in which
there is not a trial for murder pending.
While it is a mooted point whether
legal punishment lias any deterrent ef
fect upon crime, there is ample evi
dence of too much professional cour
tesy at the expense of justice. There
is a feeling among the people, how
ever, that in the near future crime must
be punished more, and more effective
measures for the preservation of so
ciety's peace are to be made.
The Thanksgivingproclamtion of the
governor of Alaska is a unique paper.
Here it is: "On account of the wonder
ful discoveries of gold upon the Klon
dike we have been brought prominently
before the public, and many who have
decried Alaska as good for nothing now
are admitting that it has wonderful
possibilities. For this turn in the tide
of opinion let us give thanks. While the
cattle uponlthe hills are the Almighty's,
tljc. gold, copper and coal in the moun
tains and the fish in the sea are His
also."
No one who has kept track of the de
velopments in the Klondike region will
be surprised af the news that a famine
as imminent at Dawson City. All
through the fall men continued to
flock into thatdistrict, relying upon the
transportation companies to bring in
supplies of provisions for the winter.
They were warned by experienced Alas
kans against the danger that threat
ened them, but very few heeded the
warning. The result is that starvation
threatens every man'in the Klondike re
gion who failed to bring with him six
months' supplies.
Every little while reports come from
the great oceanic spaces of the orient
of elemental disturbance, sv.ch as
earthquakes, tidal waves and hurri
canes, that result in loss of life that,
make disasters on this continent seem
tame in comparison. The latest horror
is a typhoon that swept the Philippine
islands and left 0,000 dead1. Between
the Spanish besom and the typhoon's
sweep the Philippines are in a lamenta
ble condition. The awful strength of
one of these hurricanes in southern
seas is quite unimaginable by those
who have not had experience of these
disturbances.
The rapidity with which a wild ani
mal tnay be exterminated can be judged
from the fact that the Smithsonian in
stitution has recently tried in vain to
obtain a living specimen of the wild, or
tjassenger, pigeon which was formerly
found in this country in countless mil
lions. After tho offer of a liberal reward
and much correspondence it lias been
concluded that the American wild pi
geon is extinct. The seals arc going just
as fast. This year's catch In the North
Pacific is little more than half that of
last season. Three or four years more
will wipe out the seals unless their
slaughter is stopped or regulated.
With both the emperor of China and

it is evident that what Artemus Ward
called "the king business" is not an al

tribulations that ordinary humanity
exempt from. The theory that the

SAQASTA ON THE MESSAGE
Intimate* That President Doesn't
Mean All He Says.
Madrid, Dec. 9.—The. premier, Senor
Sagasta, in an interview regarding
President McKinlcy's message to con
gress, is quoted as saying lie thinks
tlie message satisfactory, "because the
threat to Intervene In Cuba was made
merely to give satisfaction to a portion
of American opinion, without the in
tention of executing it."
Continuing, the premier said that the
government would not make a declara
tion on the subject. He believed the
president's words would have influence
with the insurgents, and added+hat the
cortes would not be convened until the
government had ascertained the effect
of the message upon the United States
congress.
El Liberal, commenting on the presi
dent's message, saya: "It is more fa
vorable to Spain than President Cleve
land's, because it recognizes Spain's in
tention to enthusiastically labor to re
establish peace in Cuba." The minis
terial El Globo praised President Mc
Kinley's message, the sooialist repub
lican El Pais asserts that the message is
"shameful" as it "implied the moral
bankruptcy of the monarchy." The
republican Progresso takes the ground
that the message is a "great humilia
tion."
La Corrcspondencia de Espana, the
official organ, say3 that after reflection
Spanish opinion on President McKin
ley's message to congress Is less opti
mistic than at first. Tt proceeds to im
pugn tho sincerity of .the president's
protestation of friendship for Spain
and of respect for international obliga
tion, but itadmits t'hat the message was
"addressed to congress principally and
in language which, though not intend
ed to please Spain, will annoy jingoes
and filibusters."
RAPID TRANSIT.
Remarkable Time Made by L'nion Pa
cific Tralna.
Omaha, Neb., Dec. 0.—Celebrating
its new birth, the Union Pacific has
taken two more falls out of Father
Time, and has set- the pace for fast run
ning that will likely stand in the west
for some time. Saturday the fast
mail was late in Wyoming. It covcred
42 miles from Sidney to .Tulesburg in
38 minutes 81 miles from Julcsburg to
North Platte in 71 minutes 60 miles
from North Platte to Lexington in 60
minutes 35 miles from Lexington to
Kearney in 33 minutes, and a final dash
of 42 miles from Kearney to Grand
Island in 36 minutes, or 70 miles an
hour. The 261 miles from Sidney
to Grand Island were made in 23S min
utes, an average of 65.6 miles an hour.
From Grand Island to Omaliu the run
was ordinary, the lost time having
been made up. Sunday the Union Pa
cific brought a theatrical company on
a special train from Julcsburg to Coun
cil Bluffs, 294 miles, in 286 minutes.
From this roust be deducted five min
utes for changing engines at Grand
Island, four minutes' delay by a Mis
souri Pacific freight train on the cross
ing at Portal and the necessary slow
ing up through Omaha, a distance of
five miles, and a slow run over the Mis
souri river bridge. The actual running
time of the train was 275 minutes, an
average of 63.6 miles an hour.
Champion Billiard Player.
New York, Dec. p.—The final game of
the Madison Square billiard tourna
ment was the most exciting and bril
liant of the series. It was won by Slos
son, which also makes him the winner
of the tournament. Ives was defeated
-by only two points, Slosson running the
game out from 440in one of thefinest ex
hibitions of billiard playing and cool
ness ever seen in a like contest. The
final score was: Slosson, 500 Ives, 498.
Ives had been ahead and was making
a
run when he reached his 498th point.
The 499th shot was easy, but, whether
the champion was nervous or too confi
dent matters not, he missed it. Slos
son was in the 440th hole. lie seemed
not the least bit disconcerted. He
picked up his cue without the least, sign
of excitement and began to click off
the shots. Before he stopped he had
run out the game and won the battle
with Ives and the tournament. The
highest run made during the night was
93, also mada by Slosson. Had Ives won
the game, he, Slosson and Scliaefer
would have been in a tie for first money.
As it- is, Slosson wins first place,
Schaefer second, Ives third and Daly
fourth.
To Control Gold Ontpnt.
New York, Dec. 8.—A gold trust is the
latest novelty In Jersey City. The offi
cial name under which the concern is In
corporated is the Menlo Trading com
pany. The incorporators are Charles
N. King, Nelson R. Vanderhoof and Au
gustus C. Kellogg, all of Jersey City.

the bonanza kings, who will manage the
trust. The articles of incorporation
state that the object of the company Is

and establish factories for the treat
ment of ores. It was said Tuesday that

Bay State Election*.
Boston, Dec. 8.—Seventeen of the 32
cities of the commonwealth held their
municipal elections Tuesday. In the
majority of cases the republicans were
successful in electing their mayors aud
securing control of the city govern
ment, although the results show that
the idea of independent or non-partisan
control of municipalities is steadily
growing in favor. Seven of the 17
mayors chosen won upon other than
straight party nominations, although
nearly all had party indorsements.

A THORN IN HIS FLESH.
One Man Tells Honestly of His Polit
ical Experiences.
"I didn't have much luck in the legisla
ture," sighed an aspiring young man who
is now in the insurance business. "That
old Skinley from the Hawbush district kept
lipping me up every move I made. I want
ed to go at him hammer and tongs, but he
never appeared to know that there was such
a member as I. He never used my name
when speaking, never looked at me and
never openly opposed any of my bills. But
every time I bobbed up he knockcd it to
me. When I introduced my bill lo do away
with high hats in the theater, he offered
one making it a misdemeanor for a ivoman
of 15 years or upward to appear bare
headed in any place of public amusement.
The only way of keeping even was by drop
ping both of these proposed measures.
"Having a large prohibition constituen
cy, I offered a bill in which a penalty was
fixed for selling or drinking any malt or
spirituous liquors, except under certain re
strictions which would make it impossible
to maintain saloons. Old Skinley at once
prepared and presented a measure making
it a crime for any man, woman or child to
have or to indulge a thirst for anything
stronger than tea, coffee, water, milk or
what are commonly known as soft drinks. I
was laughed off the floor when I attempted
to urge my bill.
"When I offered a bill forbidding any per
son to marry before he or she had attained
the age of 21, Skinley was soon on deck
with another bill prohibiting any young
man or woman from falling in love without
first procuring a license from the county
clerk. That's the way the fellow squelched
me at every turn. You can read my legisla
tive record on a sheet of blank paper, and
that's why I'm out of politics. But if Skin
ley ever comes up again just watch my
smoke."—Detroit Free Press.
MADE HIM PROPOSE.
And It Will Kot Very Difficult Un
dertaking.
The diffident young man wanted to pro
pose to his girl, but for the life of liim he
did not know how to go about it. lie read
books on the subject, and sought informa
tion from men who had experience and
while the theories were admirable, in every
instance he found that the practice thereof
was a different thing. He was walking with
her one evening, thinking over these things,
when her shoe bccamc untied. She stuck
DUt her pretty little foot with a smile, and
looked down at it. He fell on his knees to
tie the lace. Then lie walked on with her.
The shoe became untied again. The third
time it happened he was ready as before.
"See if you can't tie a knot that won't
come undone," she said, as he worked away
at it.
He looked up at her tenderly.
"If I can't, I know a man who can," he
•aid.
"Do you want him to tic it?" she asked,
coquettishl.v.
"Yes," lie replied.
She jerked her foot away, lie smiled to
bimsclf.
"It's the parson," he said. And lie rose
to his feet and finished the proposal.—Tit

A NECKLACE OF PEARLS
Is a beautiful possession. If a woman owns
one, and if a single pearl drops off the string,
she makes haste to find and restore it.
Good health is a more valuable possession
than a necklace of the most beautiful pearls,
yet one by one the jewels of health slip away,
and women seem indifferent until it is almost
too late, and they cannot be restored.
To die before you are really old is to suffer
premature death, and that is a sin. It is a sin
because it is the result of repeated violations
of nature's laws.
Pain, lassitude and weariness, inability to
sleep, dreadful dreams, starting violently from
sleep, arc all symptoms of nerve trouble.
You cannot have nerve trouble and keep
your health. In ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred the
womb, the ovaries and the bladder
are affected. They are not vital organs, hence
they give out soonest.

Ken- Route to California.
A striking confirmation of the truth of
the saying: "It is an ill-wiud that blows
no one good" is found in the new routing
of the "Sunset Limited." Heretofore it has
started from New Orleans westward. This
season, on account of the prevalence of yel
low fever ill some parts of the south, Chica
go has been decided upon as the terminus,
the route being over Chicago & Alton,
Chicago to St. Louis St. Louis, Iron Moun
tain & Southern, St. Louis to Texarkana
Texas & Pacific, Texarkana to EI Paso
Southern Pacific Company, El Paso to Cali
fornia destination. The train runs twice a
week, leaving Chicago 1:30 p. m. every
Tuesday and Saturday, and St. Louis 10:20
p. in. same days. Eastbound the same
trains leave Sail Francisco 5:30 p. m. Mon
days and Thursdays, and Los Angeles 10:30
a. m. Tuesdays and Fridays.
"Sunset Limited" is a magnificent train,
completely vestibulcd and running through
solid, comprising a library and smoking car
for gentlemen with barbershop and bath
room a combination ladies' parlor and
compartment car, with well-stocked library,
and ladies' maid iu attendance two of the
finest sleeping-cars, and a dining-car, in
which perfect meals arc perfectly served.
The dining-car service is a la carte—pay for
what you older—and prices are reasonable.
A trip across the continent in this train
could not but be a delight at any time, but
during the winter months there will be spe
cial satisfaction in the certainty of a semi
tropical climate, picturesque and novel
scenery, fast time, and no snow blockades.
And best of all, no extra fare is charged for
transportation on "Sunset Limited, only
the regular Pullman rates prevailing for
sleeping-car accommodations.
