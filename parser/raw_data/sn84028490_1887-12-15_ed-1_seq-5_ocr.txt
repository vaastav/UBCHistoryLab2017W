THE STATE GRANGE.
Grand Reception by Mayor Blake
and the Citizens of Carton.
Congressman McKinley, the Orator for
the Occasionâ€”Hon. I. H. Brigham,
Master of the State Grange,
Made an Eloquent Speech.
The Daila Democrat of Tuesday,
had the following:
The Assembly Room of the City Hall
was comfortably filled this morning, it
being the time of opening the session
of the Stat Grange of the Patrons of
Husbandry, which will be held today,
tomorrow and Thursday. The Grange
is very well represented by delegates
from all parts of the State. The session
this' morning and afternoon were of a
private nature, and a watchman stood
Ji at the door armed with a bludgeon,
ready to annihilate, upon the spot,
any reporter who might presume to in
vade the hall in search of news. How
ever, the session this morning was
opened by music and prayer, after
which the entire time was taken up in
a discussion of matters pertaining to
the aggrandizement of the Grange and
the betterment of the condition of the
horn; -h vnded sons of toil. '
The Daily Democrat of Wednes
day contained the following:
Early last evening people were seen
wending their way toward the Opera
House to hear the proceedings of the
State Grange.. Long before the exer
cises commenced the building was filled
both above and below. People came in
from the country for miles around to
participate in the exercises.
The first thing on the program was a
piece of music by the Grand Army
Hand, but they were not present at the
the time, and a double'quartette favored
the audience with a choice piece of
vocal music. The hand then put in ap
pearance, and after it discoursed one of
its choice selections, Mayor Blake came
forward and delivered the welcome ad
dress. He said that it became his
pleasant duty to meet you one and all
in the city of Canton, when our peo
pie first heard that the Stf.te Grange, of
Ohio, was to meet m Canton, they con
sidered it such an honor that in order
to show their aT'TirfeiaHnri of the f-vnr
onferre' upon them; they have deco
rated this .m.l ung iur your oeiien.. jie
said that the State Grange was an or
ganization within the State, and it holds
a position in the fahricof State Granges
w lich is second to none in the United
States. He spoke about the
Grangers as being the real ii
stigators of the Interstate Com
merce law, which was the first step
towards cheap transportation. He
closed his remarks by commenting
upon Canton's manufacturing interests
and the near relation they bear to the
agricultural interests.
He then introduced S. H. Ellis, who
was chairman of the Executive Cora
mittee of the State Grange. Mr. Ellis
made a few appropriate remarks, htat
ht ing that Canton was the birth place of
the first Grange in Ohio, which was or
i ganized in the house of Mr. McDowell,
Miss Sarah Lavin then sang a solo
which was highly appreciated by the
audience.
. Maj. William." McKinley, Jr., was in
troduced as the orator of the evening.
His speech was attentively listened to
bv all. He stated that 1 millions
of the people in the United States were
ensraeed in agriculture. The value of
the agricultural products in this conn
try exceeded the agricultural products
of anv nation ' in the world. Russia
came next, which was followed by Ger
many, France and Austria. His speech
lasted about an hour, and it was a thor
ough compilation of statistics with re
card to the value of farm products rais
ed in the different countries upon the
globe.
The Major then branched off into
protective tariff argument, and discus
ed at length the advantages(?) attend
ant upon a war tariff system. He es-
pecially dwelt upon the wool question.
and bemoaned the fact that the value
of wool had decreased, and attributed
this fall in value to the fact that the
. old-time duty on wool had been reduc
ed. The Major is at home when dis
cussine his favorite hobby, and the
closing part of his address may be said
to have been an out-and-out protection
sneech.
Manager Schaeferthen favored the
audience with one of his humorous
SDeeches, by comparing Canton of to
day to Canton of fifty-eight years ago
Mr. Schaefer said: "Daniel .Webster
. always made special preparations when
he addressed assemblies of such impor
tance. In this respect I differ with him,
as I never reduce anything I have to
say on paper, but always speak off hand
from head and heart through the chan
nel of the voice to give utterance.
Here is the American continent, over
88 States and 11 Territories, vie greatest
country on the globe, the best govern
ment on earth; Ohio the greatest State
in the Union, Stark county the fore
most agricultural and mineral county
in the State; and Canton, its capital,
- the most prosperous and progressive
city of its class in the State. We have
here the mother and father of all the
reapers and mowers in the United
States; all others are offshoots and
swarms from our hive. We have the
most improved plow works, the largest
safe works in the country, and will have
" in successful running operation the
greatest and most beautiful watch case
and watch manufactory works in the
known world. The works are palatial.
We have the prettiest ladies in Ohio, a
State of which every citizen within its
limits can truly feel proud. Had I the
; choice of my birthplace and the
' time of my birth 1, should have
chosen Canton from its present stand
point and Christmas as the day of my
birth; which it is. Nevertheless I was
born near the banks of the blue Moselle
, and I am proud of it, as France is a
country and a nation of which no one
need feel ashamed. Nearly J0 years
ago, in 1830, I came to Stark county.
The happiest moment in my life was
when I first saw the shores of the
United States. He described the then
Mu;"'.ou of rnrs. Indian paths
from many farms to neighbors. He
spoke of the sickle, the cradle, the flail,
of log cabin building log rolling, clear
ing and grubbing, oi com nusK
ings, dancing and singing schools, !
of apple ''Biiitzlng, and woolen
cloth .kickings,' sugar1 making,
of our. then meeting nd school-
houses, compared them with the pres
ent costly ones. Many of our preachers
were paid.in oats, soap, boots and shoes,
and sausage?, and had to walk, on the
Sabbath day, several miles from one
meeting house to another, preaching
about once in two or three weeks at the
same place. The ladies might think
that I urn quite aged; they must, how
ever, remember 1 was quite young when
was born. (Major McKinley spoke
quite lengthy on the tariff and wool
question.) Mr. Schaefer then in an
swer said that the wool question had
been quite a troublesome one, dating
back to the Garden 6f Eden, when Cain
killed Abel on account of his jealousy
against Abel, because God thought
more of the wool man than
he did of fanner Cain. "He hoped that
the present Congress would finally set
tle this peace disturbing wool question,
and called on the Major to give it his
very great influence, and support. Ti e
Major quoted the views of W aslnngton,
Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe
and Jackson on the tariff question.
Schaefer said, give us the tariff of Jef
ferson, Washington, Adams and Jack
son, and turning around to McKinley,
said: 'Give us the tanftof either of the
distinguished statesmen named and I
vill shake hands with you, and when
ydu return to Washington get all the
different views of those eminent states
men, cull from them, and then get up a
tariff bill not to conflict with the vieAvs
of any of them,"
In conclusion he congratulated Can
ton for the honor conferred upon it by
holding the convention here; we feel
proud of it, and when ryou return to
your homes don't misrepresent us, tell
the whole truth and .Cantou will feel
complimented. "'.
Hon. J. II. Brigham, of Fulton coun
ty, who is mas'.Br of the
State Grange, was ' next intro
duced. He made an eloquent
address, speaking ot the magnitude of
the agricultural interests in the coun
try. He condemned the idea of letting
a class of people come to our shores
who entertained views-that were dan
gerous to American institutions.
Misses Cassidy, Harford, Dates, and
Messrs. Hill and Mcl'hail interluded
with a select piece of vocal music.
W.W. Claik, President of the Board
of Trade, was called upon and he res
ponded in a five minutes speech. The
exercises for the tvenhig concluded by
a piece sang by the double quartette
and music by the band.
The stage decorations were the ad
miration of all. Beautiful flowers and
wreaths of evergreen were displayed
on the stage, and so arranged as to
show to the best possible advantage
Clark Tonner, Esq., assisted by Florist
Brown and J. A. Palmer, had charge of
the decorations, and to them great
credit is due for the brilliant appear
auce of the stage.

How sensible the President talks in
his message, when he says that there is
no contest between free trade and pro
tection, but a financial problem stares
us in the face that must have immedi
ate attention, and he has the moral
courage to put upon paper his solution
of the problem. We must have reduc
tion in the revenues. The brakes must
be placed on the system that saps the
currency of the country and locks it up,
The monstrous idea that the govern
ment should collect more money than
is needed must be abandoned.
The cry that our infant industries
will not stand a reduction of the tariff
is absurd. It is simple nonsense to say
that Infant industries that give an iron
and steel proprietor an income of $10,000
a day cannot stand a reduced tariff in
the interests of the whole people.
The Chicago Tribune, an able Re
publican journal, approves and praises
the President's Message. It declares
that it "rises above party lines and
points a common basis of patriotic
statesmanship on which Republicans
and Democrats are bound by every con
sideration of public welfare and of pol
itical expediency to stand together."
If the Republican party resists tariff
reduction, says the Tribune, it is liable
to be "overwhelmed." The President's
Message bids fair to divide the Repub
