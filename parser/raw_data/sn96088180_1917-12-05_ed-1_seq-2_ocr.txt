THE MESSAGE
On first reading, the president's
message to congress brings out two
point with startling clearness:
There I to be no thought of peace
until an absolute victory Is won;
and the burden of the task is to rest
on the shoulder of the United
State.
This declaration will have the
. hearty support of the people of the
country, Irrespective of political
party. The president's ringing dec
larations are genuine American and
not partisan. There can be no two
opinions of that question.
But this brings one face to face
with the probable fact that the war
la far from an end. It indicates
years more of awful struggle. The
fact that it Is a struggle between
freedom and slavery only emphasizes
the fact that it Is a fight to the
death. The concensus of well-informed
opinion is that Germany
must be beaten into submission be
fore a world peace is possible, and
i that Is a consumation not yet in
sight, though its final arrival Is ab
solutely certain.
The president makes it plain that
the country should devote itself sole
ly and unreservedly to the business
of making war. He Is right. Any
action, any proposed policy, that can
In any way lessen the progress of
America' war preparations and war
prosecution, .should he shoved to one
side without hesitation. War is the
business of the hour, a statement
that is true of the Individual Ameri
can as much as it is of the country
as a whole.
PUMPS ARE NEEDED

Washington, Dec. 4. The follow
ing cablegram has just beenrecelved
from the Paris headquarters of the
American Red Cross:
" 'Send us pumps,' la an appeal
today from a Red Cross delegate In
the devastated area. The retreating
Germans left little untouched there
last spring. Spokea were cut from
wheels of farm carts, orchards were
felled, farmhouses wrecked. In
many case's pumps were destroyed,
wells filled with rubbish and pollut
ed. '

have managed to filter back to live
In the one good corner of their
wrecked buildings to clear the fields
of barbed wire and try to till them,

To these safe wells people tome

difficult life a little easier und to
make It poulble for more of them
to come back to their devastated
fields. all they have, as soon as
pumps can be bought, ten will be
sent to fill the need for them in this
district. It la a real, though slUht,
contribution to the giant task of re
construction." GOOD LAND CLEANERS
Goats Quite Efficient in Clearing
Up Brush Patch.
Many Farms Have Spots Where Ani
mal Could B Accommodated
and Provo Money-Matting
Proposition to Owner. ,
"A herd f (rout will do more good
la clearing- up a brush patch than half
dozen able-bodied men," remarked
livestock feeder recently when at a
market In quest of a lond of goat to
iblp to hi farm.
At his farm In Wisconsin, a few
year ago there were large patche of
weeds and other foreign growth that
be had tried In vain to clear. Muny
days of hard work were spent with
out success. Finally he conceived the
Idea that a flock of goats could do
the work and do It better thun human
hands and at the same time consume
what they cleared and return a profit
to the owner.
This Is an example that could be
practiced more generally. Many farm
have brush patches that could accom
modate a flock of goAta and prove a
money-making proposition to the own
er. The goat Is an unlmal that can
thrive on feeds that other animals
could not. It hHS been remarked that
goats could live on tin cans, but some
of the brash that they consume and
turn Into profit Is ntxiut as had. Burn
ing the brush Is a dead lots to the
farm owner, but when he turns a flock
Into that patch it doe not take long
to cut down the weed and Instead of
being a loaa It s a profit to the owner.
Here If a system practiced on many
farms a side line that farmers say
I the cheapest labor on the farm. In
stead of being an expense it I an
Investment, as the animals can be
taken from the patch and, without any
additional feed, shipped to market and
Mold at a profit. The murket for goats
habeen such llmt they nearly always
are worth what they cost In the start
and the milled weight is what iimkrx
the money. Int-nd of paying for
