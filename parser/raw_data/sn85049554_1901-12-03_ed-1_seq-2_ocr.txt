PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
[Continued from First Page.]
Our present immigration laws are
unsatisfactory. We need every nonest
and efficient immigrant fitted to become
"an American citizen every immigrant
1
who corties here to stay, who brings
here a strong body, a stout heart, a
.good head, and a resolute purpose to do
.his duty well la every way and to bring
,up his children as law abiding and God
fearing members of the community. But
•there should be a comprehensive law
enacted with the object of working a
.threefold improvement over our present
'system. First, we should aim to ex
elude absolutely notvon!y all persons
who are known to be believers in an
archletic principles or members .t an
archistic societies, but also all persons
••who are of low moral tendencey or of
-"unsavory reputation. This means that
"we should require 8, more thorough sys
tem of inspection abroad and a more
rigid system of examination it our lm
migration ports, the former being espe
cially necessary.
The second object of a proper im
migration law ought to be to-secure by
a careful and not merely perfunctory
-educational test some intelligent capac
ity to appreciate American institutions
and1 act sanely as American -citizens.:
This would riot keep out all anarchists,
for many of them belong to the intelli
gent criminal class. But it would do
•what is also in point, that is, tend to de
crease the sum of ignorance, BO jJotent
In producing envy, Suspicion, malig
nant passion, and hatred of order, out
of which anarchistic sentiment Inevit
ably springs. Finally, all persons should
be excluded' who are below a certain
standard of economic fitness to enter
our industrial field as competitors with
American labor. There should be prop
er proof of personal capacity to earn an
American living, and enough money to
insure a decent start under American
conditions. This would- stop the Influx
of cheap labor, and the resulting com
petition -which gives rise to so much
bitterness in American industrial life
and it wtould dry up the springs of the
pestilential social conditions in our
great cities, where anarchistic organiz
ations have their greatest possibility of
Tfrowth.
Both, the educational and economic
tests in a wise immigration law should
be designed to protect and elevate the
general body politic and social. A very
close supervision should be exercised
over the steamship companies which
mainly bring over the immigrants, and
they, should be held to a strict account
ability for any Infraction of the law.
The Tariff and Reciprocity.
There Is general acquiescence in our
present tariff system as a national poi
tlonal policy. The first requisite to oui
prosperity is the continuity and stabil
ity of this economic policy. Nothing
could be n^re unwise than to disturb
the business interests of the country
by any general tariff change at this
time. Dtoubt, apprehension, uncertainty
are exactly what we most wiei to avoid
in the interest of our commercial and
•j material well-being. Our experience in
the past has shown that sweeping revl
'slons of the tariff are apt to produce
conditions closely approacning pantc
vln
the business world. Yet it 1b not only
possible, but eminently desirable, to
combine with the stability of our econo
mic system a supplementary system of
reciprocal benefit and obligation with
other nations. Such reciprocity Is an
Incident and result of the firm estab
lishment and presveratlon of our pres
ent economic policy. It was specially
provided for in the present tariff law.
Reciprocity must be treated as the
handmaiden of protection. Our first
,duty is to see that the protection
granted by the tariff in every case where
tit is needed is maintained, and that reci
procity be sought for so far as it can
t-afely be done without injury to our
•Jome industries. Just how far this is
'must be determined according to the in
dividual case, remembering always that
every application of our tariff policy to
•meet our shifting national needs must
-be be conditioned upon the cardinal fact
"ihat th% duties must never be reduced
below the point that will cover the dif
ference between the labor cost here and
abroad. The well-being of the wage-
(worker
I? a prime consideration of our
entire policy of economic legislation.
Subjeot to this proviso of the proper
Irotectlon necessary to our Industrial
jwell-being at home, the principle of
.reciprocity muBt command our hearty
support. The phenomenal growth of our
export trade emphasizes the urgency of
tlje n^ed for wider markets and for a
liberal policy in dealing with foreign
nations. Whatever is merely petty and
vexatious in the way bt trade restric
tions should be avoided. The customers
•to whom we dispose of our surplus prod
ucts In the long run, directly or indi
rectly, purchase those surplus products
by giving us something In return. Their
ability to purchase our products should
as far as possible be secured by so ar
ranging our tariff as to enable us to
take from them those products which
we can use without harm to our own in
dustries and labor, or the use of which
will be of marked benefit to us.
It is most important that we should
maintain the high level of our present
prosperity. We have now reached the
point in the development of our inter
ests where we are not only able to sup
ply our own markets but to produce a
constantly growing surplus for which
we must find markets abroad. To se
cure these markets we can utilize ex
isting duties In any case where they are
no longer,needed for the purpose of pro
tection, or in any case where the article
is not produced here and the duty is no
longer necessary for revenue, RS giving
us something to offer in exchange for
what we ask. The cordial relations with
other nations which are so desirable will
iiaturally be promoted by the course
thus required by our own interests.
Chinese Exclusion.
"With the sole exception of the farming
Interest, no one matter is of such vital! policy of reciprocity will be in connec
moment to our whole people as the wel- tion with those of our productions which
*are of the wage-workers. If the farm- no longer require ail of the support once
er and the wage-worker are well off, it
is absolutely certain that all others will
be well off. too. It is therefore a matter
for hearty congratulation that on the
whole wages are higher today in the
United States than ever before in our
history, and far higher than in any oth
er country. The standard of living is al
so higher than ever before. Every ef
fort of legislator and administrator
should be bent to secure the permanen
cy of this condition of things and its
improvement wherever possible. Not
only must our labor be protected,by the
tariff, but it should also be protected so
far as it is possible from the presence
in to is county of any laborers brought
over by contract, or of those who, com
ing freely, yet represent a standard of
living so depressed that they can un
dersoil our men in the labor market and
drag them to a lower level. It regard
it as necessary, with this end in view,
to re-enact Immediately the law exclud
ing Chinese laborers and to strengthen
•wherever necessary In order to make its
enforcement entirely effective.
'Immigration Laws Needed..
The natural line of development for a
needed to establish them upon a sound
basis, and with those others where eith
er because of natural or of economic
causes we are beyond the reach of suc
cessful competition.
I ask the attention of the senate to the
reciprocity treaties laid before it by my
predecessor.
Rostore the Merchant Marine.
The condition of the American mer
chant marine is such as to call for im
mediate remedial action by the con
gress. It is discreditable to us as a na
tion that our merchant marine should
be utterly insignificant in comparison to
that of other nations which we overtop
in other forms of business. We should
rot longer submit to conditions under
which only a trifling portion of our great
commerce is carried in our own ships.
To remedy this state of things would
not merely serve to build up our ship
ping interests, but it would also result
in benefit to all who are interested in the
permaneht establishment of a wider
market for American products, and
would be provide an auxiliary force- for
the navy. Ships work for their own
countries just, as railroads work for
their terminal points. Shipping lines, if
established to the principal countries
with which we have dealings, would, be
of political as well as commercial bene
fit. From every standpoint it is unwise
for the United States to continue to rely.
upon the ships of competing nations for
the distribution of our goods. It should
be madie advantageous to carry Ameri
can goods in American-built ships.
At present American shipping Is un
der certain great disadvantages when
put in competition w'.th the shipping of
foreign countries. Many of the fast for
eign steamships, at a afre'ed of- fourteen
knots/or above,.are subsidized and.all
our ehipsj, sailing Vessels a'fid steamers
alikeJ.,£argo carrier^ of slow speed and
mall carriers of high spe$d(.Jv®ve to meet
the fajt that the original cost of build
ipg American ships is greater than is
the cise abroad that the wages paid
American officers and seamen are very
much'higher than those paid the officers
and seamen of foreign competing coun
tries and that the standard of living on
our ships is far superior to the standard
of living on the ships of our commerijial
rivals.'
Our^goyernment should take such ac
tion as will remedy these Inequalities.
The American merchant marine should
be restored, to the ocean.
Government Should Irrigate,
The forests alone cannot, however,
fully regulate and conserve the waters
of the arid region. Great storage
works are necessary to equalize the
flow of streams and to save the flood
waters. Their construction has been
conclusively shown to be an undertak
ing too vast for private effort. Nor
can it be best accomplished by the in
dividual states acting alone. Far
reaching interstate problems are in
volved and the resources of single
states would often be inadequate. It is
properly a national function, at least
in some of itB features. It is as right
for the national government to make
the streams and rivers of the arid re
gion useful by engineering works for
water storage as to make useful the
rivers and harbors of the humid region
by engineering works of another kind.
The storing of the floods in reservoirs
at the headwaters of our rivers is but
an enlargement of our present policy of
river control, under which levees are
built on the lower reaches 'of the samo
streams.
The government should construct and
maintain these reservoirs as it does
other public works. Where their pur
pose is to regulate the flow of streams,
the water should be turned freely into
the channels in the dry season to take
the same course under the game laws
as the natural flow. ..
The reclamation of the unsettled arid
public lands presents a different prob
Jem. Here it is not enough to regulate
the flow of streams. The object of the
government to dispose of the land to
settlers who will build homes upon It
To accomplish this object water must
be brought within their reach.
The pioneer settlers on the arid pub
lic domain chose their homes along
streams from which they could them
selves divert the water to reclaim their
holdings. Such opportunities are prac
tically gone. There remain, however,
vast areas of public land which can
be made available for homestead set
tlement, but only by reservoirs and
main-line canals impracticable for pri
vate enterprise. These irrigation works
should be built tfy the national govern
ment. The lands reclaimed by them
should be reserved by the government
for actual settlers, and the cost of con
struction should so far as possible bo
repaid by the land reclaimed. The dis
tribution of the water, the division of
the streams among Irrigators, should
be left to the settlers themselves ii
conformity with state .laws and with
out interference with those laws ,or
with vested rights. The policy of {ho
national government should be to air
Irrigation in the several states and ter
ritories in such manner as will enable
the people in the local communities to
help themselves, and as will stimulate
needed reforms In the state laws and
regulations governing Irrigation.
Whatever the nation does for the ex
tension of Irrigation should harmonize
with, and tend to improve, the condi
tion of those now living on irrigated
land. We are not at the starting point
of this development. Over two hun
dred millions of private capital has al
ready been expended in the construction
of irrigation works, and many million
acres of arid land reclaimed. A high
degree of enterprise and ability has
been shown in the work itself but
as much cannot be said in reference to
the laws relating thereto. The se
curity and value of the homes created
depend largely on the stability of titles
to water but the majority of these
rest on the uncertain foundation of
court decisions rendered in ordinary
suits at law. With a few creditable
exceptions, the arid states have failed
to provide for the certain and Just di
vision of streams in times of scarcity.
Lax and uncertain laws have made It
possible to establish rights to water in
excess of actual uses or necessities,
and many streams have already passed
into private ownership, or a control
equivalent to ownership.
Whoever controls a stream practic
ally controls the land It renders pro
ductive, and the doctrine of private
ownership of water apart from land can
not prevail without causing enduring
wrong. The recognition of such own
ership,
vwhich
has been permitted to
grow up in the arid regions, should
give wny to a more enlightened and
larger recognition of the rights of the
public In the control and disposal of the
public water supplies. Ijawrs founded
upon conditions obtaining it, have no
proper application in a dry country.
In the arid states the only light
to water which should be recognized is
that of use. In irrigation this right
should attach to the land reclaimed and
be inseparable therefrom. Granting
perpetual water rights to others than
users, without compensation to the
public, is open to all the objections
which apply to giving away perpetual
franchises to the public utilities of
{cities. A few of the western states
have always recognized this, and have
incorporated in their constitutions the
doctrine of perpetual state ownership of
water. ......
Hawaiian Land Laws.
In Hawaii our aim must be'to develop
the territory on the traditional Amerl
can lines.: We do not wish a region of
large estates tilled by cheap labor we
wish a healthy American community of
men who themselves till the farms they
own. All our legislation for the islands
I should be shaped with this end in view
the well-being of the average home
maker must afford the true test of the
healthy development of the islands. The
land policy should as nearly as possible
be modeled on our homestead system.
Porto Rico Thriving.
It is a pleasure to say that it is hardly
more necessary to report as to Porto Ri
co than to any state or territory within
our continental limits. The island is
thriving as never before, and it is being
administered efficiently and honestly.
Its people are now enjoying liberty and
order under the protection of the United
State?, and upon this fact we congratu
late them and ourselves. Their material
"welfare must be as carefully and jeal
ously considered as the welfare of any
other portion of our country. We have
given them the great gift of free access
for their products to the markets of the
United States. I ask the attention of the
congress to the need of legislation con
cerning the public lands of Porto Rico.
Cuban Tariffs.
In Cuba such progress has been made
toward putting the independent govern
ment of the island upon a firm footing
thatv before the present session of the
congress closes this will be an accom
plished fact. Cuba will then start as
her own mistress and to the beautiful
queen of the Antilles as she unfolds this
new page of her destiny, we extend our
heartiest greetings and good wishes.
Elsewhere I have dlscusesd the question
of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba,
however, there are weighty reasons of
morality and of national interest why
the policy should be held to have a pe
culiar application, and I most earnestly
ask your attention to the wisdom, in
deed to the vital need, of providing for
a substantial reduction in the tariff du
ties on Cuban imports Into the United
States. Cuba has In her constitution
affirmed what we desired, that she
should stand, in international matters,
in closer and more friendly relations
with us than with any other power and
we are bound by every consideration of
honor and expediency to pass commer
cial measures in the Interest of her ma
terial well-being.
Philippine Problem.
In the Philippines our problem is lar
ger. They are very rich tropical islands,
inhabited by many varying tribes, rep
resenting widely different stages of
progress toward civilization. Our earn
est effort is to help these people upward
along the stony and difficult path that
leads to self-government. We hope to
make our administration of the Islands
honorable to our nation by making It of
the highest benefit to the Filipinos
themselves and as an earnest of what
we Intend to do we point to what we
have done. Already a greater measure
of material prosperity and of govern
mental honesty and efficiency has been
attained In the Philippines than ever be
fore in thelj- history.
It is no light task for a nation to
achieve the temperamental qualities
without which the institutions of free
government are but an empty mockery.
Our people are now successfully govern
ing themselves, because for more than a
thousand years they have been slowly
fitting themselves, sometimes conseious
jy, sometimes unconsciously, toward
this end. What has taken us thirty gen
erations to achieve, we can not expect
to see another race accomplish out of
hand, especially when large portions of
that race start very far behind the point
which our anceseors had reached even
thirty generations ago. In dealing with
the Philippine people we must show
both patience and strength, forbear
ance and steadfast resolution. Our aim
is high. We do not desire to do for the
Islanders merely what has elsewhere
been done for tropic peoples by ev£n the
best foreign governments. We hope to
do for them what has never before been
done for any people of the tropics—to
make them fit for self-government after
the fashion of the really free nations.
History may safely be challenged to
show a single instance in which a mas
terful race such as ours, having been
forced by the exigencies of war to take
possession of an alien land, has behaved
to its inhabitants with the disinterested
zeal for their progress that our people
have shown in the Philippines. To leave
the 'slands at this time would mean
that they would fall into a welter of
murderous anarchy. Such desertion of
duty on our part would be a crime
against humanity. The character of
Governor Taft and of his associates and
subordinates is a proof, if such be need
ed. of the sincerity of our effort to give
the islanders a constantly increasing
measure of self-government, exactly as
fast as they show themselves fit to ex
ercise it. Since the civil government
was established not an appointment has
been made in the islands with any ref
erence to considerations of political in
fluence, or aught else save the fitness of
the man and the needs of the service.
The time has come when there snould
be additional legislation for the Philip
pines. Nothing better can be done for
the islands than to introduce Industrial
enterprises. Nothing would benefit them
so much as throwing them open to In
dustrial development. The connection
between idleness and mischief is pro
verbial, and the opportunity to uo re
nuinerative work is one of the surest
preventives of war. Of course no busi
ness man will go Into the Philippines
unless It is to his interest to do so and
it is immensely to the interest of the
islands that he should go In. It is
therefore necessary that congress
should pass laws by which the re
sources of the islands can be developed
so that franchises (for limited terms of
years) can be granted to companies do
ing business in them, and every en
couragement be given to the incoming
of business men. of every kind.
Not to permit this is to do a wrong to
the Philippines. The franchise must be
granted and the business permitted on
ly under regulations which will guaran
tee the islands against any kind of
improper exploitation. But the vast
natural wealth of the island* «m«t be
giwrntng Trm^-'RepuMinM, TOarslialltawr Tittsdag, gEtemto:
developed1, and the capital willing to de
velop it must be given tne opportunity.
The field must be thrown open to indi
vidual enterprise, which has been the
real factor In the development of every
region over which our flag has flown. It
it urgently necessary to enact suitable
laws dealing with general transporta
tion, mining, banking, currency, home
steads, and the use and ownership of
the lands and timber. These laws will
give free play to industrial enterprise
and the commercial development which
will surely follow will afford to the peo
ple of the islands the best proofs of the
sincerity of our desire to aid them.
Build the Pacific Cable.
I call your attention most earnestly
to the crying need of a cable to Hawaii
and the Philippines, to be continued
from the Philippines to points in Asia.
We should not defer a day longer than
necessary the construction of such
cable. It is demanded not merely for
commercial but for political and mili
tary considerations.
Either the congress should imme
diately provide for the construction of a
government cable, or elsee an arrange
ment should be made by which like ad
vantages to thope accruing from a gov
ernment cable may be secured to the
government by contract with a private
cable company.
Build the Canal.
No single great material work which
remains to be undertaken on this conti
nent is of such consequence ti the
American people as the building of a
canal across the Isthmus connecting
North and South America. It import
ance to the nation is by no means 11m
ited merely to Its material effects upon
our business prosperity and yet with
view to these effects alone it would be to
the last degree important ior us imme
diately to begin it. While its beneficial
effects would perhaps be most marked
upon the Pacific coast and the gulf of
the south Atlantic states, It would also
greatly benefit other sections. It is em
phatically a work which it 19 for the in
terest of the entire country to begin and
complete as soon a possible It Is one of
those great works which only a great
nation can undertake with prospects of
success and which when done are not
only permanent assets In the nation's
material Interests, but standing monu
ments to Its constructive ability.
I am glad to be able to announce to
you that our negotiations on this sub
ject with Great Britain, conducted on
both, s'.d'es in a spirit of friendliness and
mutual good will and respect, have re
suited In my £eing able to lay before the
senate a treaty which if ratified will en
able us to begin preparations for an
isthmian canal at any. time, and which
guarantees to this nation every right
that it has ever asked in connection
with the canal. In this treaty, the old
Clayton-Bulwer treaty, so long recog
nized as Inadequate to supply the base
for the constuctlon and maintenance of
a necessarily American ship canal, Is
abrogated. It specifically provides that
the United States alone shall do the
work of building and assume the re
sponsibility of safeguarding the canal
and shall regulate Its neutral use by au
nations on terms of equaiuy without
the guaranty or interference of any out
side nation from any quarter. The
signed treaty will at once be laid before
the senate, and if approved the congress
can then proceed to give effect to the
advantages It secures us by providing
for the building of the canal.
The Monroe Doctrine.
The true end of every great and free
people should be self-respecting peace
and this nation most earnestly djwlres
sincere andi cordial friendship with all
others. Over the entire world, of recent
years, wars between the great civilized
powers have become less and less fre
quent. Wars with barbarous or semi
barbarous peoples come in an entirely
different category, being merely a most
regrettable but necessary International
police duty which must be performed
for the sake of the welfare of man
kind. Peace can only be kept with cer
tainty where both sides wish to keep it
but more and more the civilized peoples
are realizing the wicked folly of war
and are attaining that condition, of just
and intelligent regard for the rights of
others which will In the end, as we hope
and believe, make world-wide peace
possible. The peace conference at The
Hague gave definite expression to this
hope and belief and marked a stride
toward their attainment.
This same peacc conference acquies
ced in our statement of the Monroe doc
trine as compatible with the purposes
and alms of the conference.
The Monroe doctrine should be the
cardinal feature of the foreign policy
of all nations of the two Americas, as
it is of the United States. Just seven
ty-eight years have passed since Pres
ident Monroe in his annual message an
nounced that "The American continents
are henceforth not to be considered as
subjects for future colonization by any
European power." In other words, the
Monroe doctrine Is a declaration that
there must be no territorial aggrandize
ment by any non-American power at
the expense of any American power on
American soil. It is in no wise intended
as hostile to any nation in the old
world. Still less Is It Intended to give
cover to any aggression by one new
world' power at the expense of any oth
er. It is simply a step, and a long step,
toward assuring the universal peace of
the world by securing the possibility of
permanent peace on this hemisphere.
During the past century other Influ
ences have established the permanence
and Independence of the smaller states
of Europe. Thru the Monroe doctrine
we hope to be able to safeguard like
independence and secure like perma
nence for the lesser among the new
world nations.
This doctrine has nothing to do with
the commercial relations of any Ameri
can power save that It in truth allows
each of them to form such as it desires.
In other words, it Is really a guaranty of
the commercial independence of the
Americas. We do not ask under this
doctrine for any exclusive commercial
dealings with any other American state.
We do not guarantee any state against
punishment if it misconducts Itself, pro
vided that punishment does not take the
form of the acquisition of territory by
any non-American power.
Our attitude in Cuba is a sufficient
guaranty of our own good faith. We
have not the slightest desire to secure
any territory at the expense of any of
our neighbors. We wish to work with
them hand in hand, so that all of us
may be uplifted together, and we rejoice
over the good fortune of any of them,
we gladly hail their material prosperity
and political stability, and are con
cerned and alarmed if any of them fall
Into Industrial or political chaos. We
do not wish to see any old world mili
tary power grow up on this continent, or
to be compelled to become a. military
power ourselves. The peoples of the
Americas can propser best If left to
work out their own salvation In their
own way.
Build Up the Navy.
The work of upbuilding the navy must
be steadily continued. No one point of
our policy, foreign or domestic, Is more
important than this to the honor and
material welfare, and above all to the
peace, of our nation in the future.
Whether we desire it or not, we must
henceforth recognize that we have in
ternational duties no less than Interna
tional rights. Even if our flag were
hauled down in the Philiplnes and Porto
Rico, even If we decided not to build the
Isthmian canal, we should need a thor
oughly trained navy of adequate size, or
else be prepared definitely and for all
time to abandon the idea that our na
tion is among those whose sons go down
to the sea in ships. Unless our commerce
is always to be carried In foreign bot
toms, we must have war craft to pro
tect It.
Inasmuch, however, as the American
people have no thought of abandoning
the path upon which they have entered,
and especially in view of the fact that
the building of the isthmian canal is
fast becoming one of the matters which
the whole people are united in demand
ing, It is imperative that our navy
should be put and kept In the highest
state of efficiency, and should be made
to answer to our growing needs. So far
from being in any way a provocation to
war, an adequate and highly trained
navy Is the best guaranty against war,
the cheapest and most effective peace
insurance. The cost of building and
maintaining such a navy represents the
very lightest premium for insuring
peace which this nation can possibly
pay.
Probably no other great nation in the
world is so anxious for peace as we are
There is not a single civilized power
which has anything whatever to fear
from aggressiveness on our part. All we
want Is peace and toward this end we
wish to be able to secure the s^me re
spect for our rights from others which
we are eager and anxious to extend to
their rights in return, to insure fair
treatment to us commercially, and to
guarantee the safety of the American
people.
Our people Intend to abide by the
Monroe doctrine and to Insist upon it as
the one sure means of securing the peace
of the western hemisphere. The navy
offers us the only means of making our
Insistence upon the Monroe doctrine
anything but a subject .of derision to
whatever nation chooses to disregard it.
We desire the peace which comes as of
right to the Just man armed not the
peace granted on terms of ignominy to
the craven and the weakling.
To send any warship against a com
petent enemy unless those aboard it
have been trained by years of actual sea
service, including incessant gunnery
practice, would be to Invite not merely
disaster, but the bitterest shame and
humiliation. Four thousand additional
seamen and one thousand additional
marines should be provided and an in
crease in the officers should be provided
by making a large addition to the class
es at Annapolis. There la one small
matter which should be mentioned in
connection with Annapolis. The preten
tious and unmeaning title of "naval ca
det" should be abolished the title of
"midshipman," full of historic associa
tion, should be restored.
Even in time of peace a warship
should be used until It wears out, for
only so can it be kept fit to respond to
any emergency. The officers and men
alike should be kept as much as possible
on blue water, for it is there only they
can learn their duties as they.should be
learned. The big vessels should be ma
neuvered in squadrons containing not
merely battleships, but the necessary
proportion of cruisers and scouts. The
torpedo boats should be handled by the
younger officers In such manner as will
best fit the latter to take responsibility
and meet the emergencies of actual
warfare.
But in addition we should at once pro
vide for a national navy reserve, organ
ized and trained under the direction of
the navy department, and subject to the
call of the chief executive whenever war
becomes imminent. It should be a real
auxiliary to the naval sea-going peace
establishment, and offer material to be
drawn on at once for manning our ships
in time of war. It should be composed
of graduates of the naval academy,
graduates of the naval militia, officers
and crews of coast-llne steamers, 'long
shore schooners, fishing vessels and
steam yachts, together with the coast
population about such centers as life
saving stations and light-houses.
The American people must either
build and maintain an adequate navy or
else make up their minds definitely to
accept a secondary position in interna
tional affairs, not merely In political,
but in commercial, matters. It has been
well said that there is no surer way of
courting national disaster than to be
"opulent, aggressive and unarmed."
Army Is Large Enough.
It is not necessary to Increase our
army beyond its present size at this
time. But it is necessary to keep it at
the highest point of efficiency. The ln
divdiual units who as officers and en
listed men compose this army are, we
have good reason to believe, at least as
efficient as those of any other army in
the entire world. It is our duty to see
that their training is of a kind to in
sure the highest possible expression of
power to these units when acting in
combination.
The conditions of modern war are
such as to make an Infinitely heavier
demand than ever before upon the indi
vidual character and capacity of the of
ficer and the enlisted man, and to make
it far more difficult for men to act to
gether with effect. At present the flght
irg must be done in extended order,
which means that each man must act
for himself and at the same time act in
combination with others with whom he
Is no longer In the old-fashioned elbow
to-elbow touch. Under such conditions
a few men of the highest excellence are
worth more than many men without the
special skill which is only found as the
result of special training applied to men
of exceptional physique and morale. But
nowadays the most valuable fighting
man and the most difficult to pferfect is
the rlflleman who is also a skillful and
daring rider.
The proportion of our cavalry regi
ments has wisely been increased. The
American cavalryman, trained to ma
neuver and fight with equal facility on
foot and on horseback, Is the best type
of soldier for general purposes now to
be found In the world. The ideal caval
ryman of the present day is a man who
can fight on foot as effectively as the
best infantryman, and who is in addi
tion unsurpassed in the care and man
agement of his horse and in his ability
to fight on horseback.
A general staff should be created. As
for the present staff and supply depart
ments, they should be filled by details
from the line, the men so detailed re
turning after a while to their line duties.
It is very undesirable to have the senior

grades of the army composed of men
who have come to fill the positions by
the mere fact of seniority. A system
should be adopted by which there shall
be an elimination grade by grade of
those who seem unfit to render the best
service in the next grade. Justice to the
veterans of the civil war who are still
In the army would seem to require that
in the matter of retirements they be
given by law the same privileges ac
corded to their comrades in the navy.
The process of elimination of the least
fit should be conducted In a manner that
would render it practically impossible to
apply political or social pressure on be
half of any candidate, so that each man
may be judged purely on his own merits.
Pressure for the promotion of civil offi
cials for political reasons Is bad enough,
but it is tenfold worse where applied on
behalf of officers of the army or navy.
Every promotion and every detail under
the war department must be made sole
ly with regard to the good of the serv
ice and to the capacity and merit of the
man himself. No pressure, political, so
cial or personal, of any kind will be per
mitted to exercise the least effect in any
question of promotion or detail and if
there Is reason to believe that such pres
cure is exercised at the instigation of the
officer concerned it will be held to mill
tate against him. In our army we can
not afford to have rewards or duties dis
tributed save on the simple ground that
those who by their own merits are en
titled to the rewards get them, and that
those who are peculiarly fit to do the
duties are chosen to perform them.
Our army 1B so small and so much
scattered that It Is very difficult to give
the higher officers (AB well as the lower
officers and the enlisted men) a chance
to practice maneuvers In mass and on a
comparatively large scale. In time of
need no amount of individual excellence
would avail against the paralyslB which
would follow inability to work as a co
herent whole, under skillful and daring
leadership. The congress should provide
means whereby It will be possible to
have field exercises by at least a divis
ion of regulars, and if possible also a
division of national guardsmen, once a
year. These exercises might take the
form of field maneuvers or, if on the
gulf coast or the Pacific or Atlantic sea
board, or in the region of the great
lakes, the army corps when assembled
could be marched from some inland
point to some point on the water, there
embarked, disembarked after a couple
of days' Journey at some other point,
and again marched inland. Only by act
ual handling and providing for men In
masses while they are marching, camp
Ing, embarking and disembarking will It
be possible to train the higher officers to
perform their duties well and smoothly.
Action should be taken In reference to
the militia and to the raising of volun
teer forces. Our mlldtia law is obsolete
and worthless. The organization and
armament of the national guard of the
several states, which are treated as mi
litia in the appropriations by the con
gress, should be made Identical with
those provided for the regular forces.
The obligations and duties of the guard
In time of war should be carefully de
fined, and a system established by law
under which the method: of procedure
raising volunteer forces should be pre
scribed in advance. It is utterly im
possible in the excitement and haste of
impending war to do this satisfactorily
if the arangements have not been made
long beforehand. Provision should be
made for utilizing in the first volunteei
organizations called out the training of
those citizens who have already had ex
perience under arms, and especially for
the selection in advance of the officers

That the army is not at all a mere in
strument of destruction has been shown
during the last three years. In the Phil
ippines, Cuba, and Porto Rico, it haE
proved itself a great constructive force,
a most potent implement for the up
building of a peaceful civilization.
The Merit System.
The merit system of making appoint
ments Is in its essence as democratic
and American as the common school
system Itself. It simply means that In
clerical and other positions wher.e the
duties are entirely non-polltlcal, all ap
plicants should have a fair field and no
favor, each standing on his merits as he
is able to show them by practical test.
Written competitive examinations offer
the only available means in many cases
for applying this system. In other cases,
as where laborers are employed, a sys
tem of registration undoubtedly can be
widely extended. There are, of course
places where the written, competitive
examination cannot be applied, and
others where it offers by no means an
ideal solution, but where under existlnt
political conditions it is, tho an imper
feet means, yet the best present means
of getting satisfactory resujts*
Wherever the conditions have permit
ted the applicationi of the merit system
in ita fullest and widest sense, the gain
to the government has been Immense.
The navy yards and postal service Illus
trate, probably better than any other
branches of the government, the great
gain In economy, efficiency, and. honesty
due to the enforcement of this principle.
I recommend the passage of a law
which will extend the classified service
to the District of Columbia, or will at
least enable the president to extend it.
In my Judgment all laws providing for
the temporary employment of clerks
should hereafter contain a provision
that they be selected under the civil
service law.
It 1B Important to have this system
obtain at home, but it is even more im
portant to have it applied rigidly to our
insular possessions. Not an office should
be filled in the Philippines or Porto Rico
with any regard to the man'a partisan
affiliations or services, with any regard
to the political, social, or personal in
fluence which he may have at his com
mand in short, heed should be paid to
absolutely nothing save the man's own
character and capacity and the needs of
the service.
The administration of these Islands
should be wholly free from the susmi
clon of partisan politics as (tie adminis
tration of the army and navy. All that
we ask from the public servant in the
Philippines or Porto RICo Is that he re
flect honor on his country by the way
In which he makes that country's rule a
benefit to the peoples who have come
under It. This Is all that we should ask,
and we cannot afford to be content with
less.
The merit system Is simply one meth
od of securing honest and efficient ad
ministration of the government and In
the long run the sole justification of
any type of government lies in its prov
ing itself both honest and efficient.
Consular 8ervice Needs Attention
The consular service is now organized
under the provisions of a law passed li
1856, which is entirely inadequate to ex
isting conditions. The interest shown
by so many commercial bodies thruout1
the country in the re-organization of the
service le heartily commended) to your
attention. Several bills providing for a
new consul&r service have in recent
years been'submitted to the congress.
They are based) upon the just principle
that appointments to the service should
be made only after a practical test of
the applicant's fitness, that promotions
should be governed by trustworthiness
adaptability, and zeal in the perform
ance of duty, and that the tenure of
office should be unaffected by partisan
considerations.
The guardianship and fostering of our
rapidly expanding foreign commerce,
the protection of American citizens re
sorting to foreign countries in lawful
pursuit of their affairs, and the mainte
nance of the dignity of the nation
abroad, combine to make It essential
that our consuls should be men of char
acter, knowledge, and enterprise. It is
true that the service is now, in the
main, efficient, but a standard of excel
lence cannot be permanently main
tained until the principles set forth In
the bills heretofore submitted to the
congress on this subject are enacted in
to law.
Public Library Movement.
Perhays the most characteristic edu
cational movement of the past fifty
years is that which has created the
modern public library and developed it
into broad and active service. There
are now over 5,000 public libraries in the
United States, the product of this peri
od. In addition to accumulating ma
terial, they are also striving by organ
ization, by improvement in method and
by co-operation, to give greater efficien
cy to the material they hold, to make It
more widely useful and by avoidance of
unnecessary duplication In process to
reduce the cost of its administration.

co-operative efforts for the diffusion of
knowledge and the advancement of
learning.
Census Office Should Remain.
For the sake of good administration,
sound economy and the advancement of
science, the census! office as now consti
tuted should be made a permanent gov
ernment bureau. This would Insure bet
ter, cheaper and more satisfactory work,
in the interest not only of our business,
but of statistic, economic and social
science.
Commends Rural Delivery.
The remarkable growth of the postal
service is shown in the fact that its
revenues have doubled and Its expen
ditures have nearly doubled within
twelve, years. Its progressive develop
ment compels constantly increasing out
lay, but in this period of business ener
gy and prosperity its receipts grow so
much faster than Its expenses that the
annual deficit has been steadily reduced
from $11,411,779 in 1897 to $3,923,727 in
1901. Among recent postal advances the
success of rural free delivery wherever
established has been so marked, and ac
tual experience has made its benefits so
plain, that the demand for its etxension
is general and urgent.
It Is just that the great agricultural
population should share in the improve
ment of the service. The number of
rural routes now in operation i9 6,009,
practically all established within three
Tears, and there are 6,000 applications
awaiting action. It is expected that the
number in operation at the close of the
current fiscal year will reach 8,600. The
mail will then be daily carried to the
doors of 5,700,000 of our people who have
heretofore been dependent upon distant
offices, and one-third of all that portion
of the country which Is adapted to it
wlll.be covered by this kind of service.
The full measure of postal progress
which might be realized has lonjr been
hampered and obstructed by the heavy
burden imposed on the government thru
the intrenched and well-understood
abuses which have grown up in connec
tion with second-class mail matter. The
extent of this burden appears when it is
stated that while the second-class mat
ter makes nearly three-fifths of the
weight of all the mail, it paid for the
last fiscal year only $4,294,445 of the ag
gregate postal revenue of $111,631,193. If

law, no just exception could be taken.
That expense would be the recognized

able end. But much of the matter which
enjoys the privileged rate is wholly out

its requirements or thru lax construc

Included matter is estimated by postal
experts to be one-half of the whole vol
ume of second-class mail. If it be only:
one-third or one-quarter, the magnitude
of the burden is apparent. The postof

remove th,e abuses so far as is possible
by a stricter application of the law and
it should be fiustained in its effort.
