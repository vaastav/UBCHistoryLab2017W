PRESIDENT WILSON HAS NO COMPROMISF "
TO OFFER ON DISPOSITION OF THE TREi
. ! ;
Announces That He Will Continue to Hold Republican Mem
bers of the Senate Responsible For Results and Condi
tions Attending Delay Debate About the White House
Statement Today Is Expected to Add Vigor to the Peace
Ratification Contest Senator Hitchcock Declares Demo
crats Will Never Consent to Ratification Without the
League of Nations, as Proposed By Senator Knox.
Washington, Dec. H. President
Wilson today intervened in the peace
treaty dilemma with an announce
ment that he had "no compromise or
concession of any kind in mind,
would make no move toward the
treaty's disposition, and would con
tinue to hold the republican members
of the senate responsible for results
and conditions attending delay.
The president's position. regarded
as peculiarly significant in view of
the recent discussion in the senate of
a compromise, was set forth in the
following statement issued today
from the White House:
"It was learned from the highest
authority at the executive offices to
day that the hope of the republican
leaders of U senate that the presi
dent wouid presently make some
move which will relieve the situation
with regard to tap treaty is entirely
without foundation he, has no com
promise or concess.on of any kind in
mind, but intends so far as he is con
cerned that the republican leaders of
the senate shall continue to bear the
undivided responsibility for the fate of
the treaty and the present condition of
the world in eonsequence of that fate."
The Wilts House statement appar
ently had no effeet in changing the
treaty situation. Democratic leaders,
indorsing the president's views, de
clared that it dd not preclude a sen
ale f-ompromiFe and that compromise
eTorts would proceed. Republican
IsAlfefl reiterated ihnl the president
wa responsible for the prevent status
; nd must make the first move towards
a solution. Senators hoping to kill
the treaty alone expressed satisfac
tion. ' 'n one point rnly, apparently, were
11 senate factions in harmony name
ly, that decisive action on the treaty
probably would be deferred until next
me-mh. after the proposed holiday re
cess of congress, planned to end Jan
uary r.. Senate debate, p.obably cen
tered about the White House state
ment, is expected to be reopened to
morrow with fresh vigor. The demo
cratic compromise campaign also is to
be pressed, according to Senator
llttchcx k of Nebraska, administra
tion leader.

rcs -i-. auons sinii ihat the senate and

M for ihi- senate. We are ready to ne
gotiate at any time and will continue
t'i seek a compromise between the
lxdge rest rvatlons and those I offered
last November. "
Senator Hitchcock declared posi
tively that the democrats never
would consent to ratification of the
treaty without the League of Nations
awl would not accept the plan offered
yesterday by Senator Knox, republi
cs, Pennsylvania, to ratify the peace
leim- and leave the league question
for decision by the voters.
Senator Lodge of. Massachusetts,
and othi r prominent republicans re
served public comment on the White
House statement..
Senator Borah of Idaho, republican
member of the foreign relations com
mittee, and prominent among the
treaty's implacable foes, in a state
ment tonight charged that large finan
cial interests were engaged in propa
ganda favoring a senate compromise
and also proposed to keep the treaty
and the league from being passed on
by the people during the ensuing pres
idential campaign.
To the president's contention that
the senate majority is responsible for
conditions resulting from delay, re
publican leaders pointed to the objec
tions yesterday of Senator Hitchcock
to the Knox resolution proposing; rati
fication of the treaty so far as it would
effect peace with Germany and post
ponement of action on the League of
Nations.
It is utterly out of the question, ab
solutely impossible, ' said Senator
Hitchcock of the Knox resolution, add
lng that the basis of compromise mus

he proposed as substitutes
Leaders of both major factions of
the senate arc hopeful that from the
London conferences of the British and
French premiers may come, possibly
in a tew days, some responsible ac
tion toward acceptance of senate res
ervations which might lead to the
treaty s ratification.
There appeared lessened hope to
night, however, that a solution might
be reached with the Knox resolution
as a basis. The agreement of Senator
Underwood, democrat, Alabama, to
support the Knox resolution gave rise
to this hope. The view was expressed
tonight, however, that opposition of
Senator Borah and probably others of
the "irreconcilables" to a compro
mised ratification, taken together with
the president's statement, had reduced
materially any prospect for such rati
fication. Effect of the president's statement
on the democratic leadership contest
between Senators Hitchcock and Un
derwood also was a subject of much
senatorial speculation tonight.

it is learned that in the note the
Gerfan reiterates its desire to have
ratification of the peace treaty effect
ed at the earliest possible date. It
gently hints that the entente is re
sponsible for the complications which
have delayed the exchange of ratifica

clares that Germany has not and is
not now making the final ratification

CONGRESS TO PROBE
OF GARFIELD'S RESIG1TI

Gradually Are Being Removed President Lewis of the
Miners Predicts That 95 Per Cent of the Miners Will Be
Back at Work By Monday Night
Washington. Dec. 14. While relax
ation of restrictions on the use of bi
tuminous coal continued today, indi
cating governmental belief that the
strike crisis, in the industry has pass
ed, congressional investigation began
to bear upon the active participants
in the settlement. The appearance last
night of Dr. Harry A. Garfield, whose
resignation as federal fuel adminis
trator was accepted yesterday by
President Wilson, before the senate
sub-committee investigating the ooal
situation was followed today by in
dications that Attorney General Pal
mer and other high officials would be
called on this week to explain why
plans of Dr. Garfield were set aside
and a compromise made with the
miners' union on a basis which the
former fuel administrator described as
"contrary to fundamental principles of
government."
Acting President John L. Levis of
the United Mine Workers of Aifjrica,
who is attending the labor recon
struction conference here, predicted
today that by Monday night 95 per
cent, of the miners would be back to
work.
Restrictions imposed on the use of
fuel during the strike gradually are
being removed under the discretionary
authority to rescind such orders given
the regional railroad directors.
Although most of the power to re
scind the various restrictions has been
placed in the hands of the regional di
rectors, the railroad administration, is
continuing to exercise a supervisory
control over bituminous coal and
coke. This has been made necessary
not alone by the resignation of Fuel
Administrator Garfield, but also by the
resignations of Cyrus Guernsey, Jr.,
assistant to Dr. Garfield, and John A.
Alport, chief engineer, both of whom
cam back to Washington to serve with
their chief when the fuel administra
tion was revived. These resignations
have practically put an end to the
reinstated activities of the adminis
tration. Appointment by President Wilson of
a commission to supercede the fuel ad
ministrator is expected this week. J?o
intimations of the personnel have been
given in official quarters, though the
basis decided upon will make its com
position include one mine worker, one
coal mine operator, and a represen
tative of the public. The three will
have power to readjust wage scalesj
above the present advance of 14 pe
cent, given the miners, if desired, and
also to advance the selling price of

Premier Nltti summed up the debate
on the reply in a speech of consider

to deny t.he report that the govern

ternational 'agreements creating fresh
responsibilities. The premier's refer

of Premiers Lloyd George and Cle

"The statement that a new tariff

VILLA HOLDS AN AMERICAN
RANCHMAN FOR RANSOM
London, Dec. 14. Nationals of
stricken European countries who re
side in the United States will soon be
able to supply their relatives and
friends with food at reasonable prices
through a plan that has been evolved
by the American Relief Administra
tion. Under the same plan persons
living in those countries and possess
ing the necessary funds may pur
chase essential foods, which in some
countries are extremely difficult to ob
tain. The plan already has the in
dorsements of the governments at
Vienna, Warsaw, Prague and Buda
pest, while the acquiescence of the
German government Is expected short
ly, it is declared.
The relief administration has organ
ized the "American Relief Warehouse
Corporation," which will undertake to
send at the. outset about $5,000,000
worth of foodstuffs to the five coun
tries mentioned. The governments
which will benefit by the plan have
agreed to forego the imposition of im
port duties and to transport the sup
plies from the docks where they are
delivered to warehouses which the
governments will provide. They have
also agreed not requisition the sup
plies under any contingency. The
foodstuffs will be sold on the dollar
basis at figures which will net the
corporation a profit. All the profits
will be used for extending the present
child relief activities of the adminis
tration in the countries in which the
profits accrue.
In detail the plan provides that a
person in the United States may go to
the financial representatives of the
corporation and pay in any amount
for the purchase of a food warrant for
a designated person abroad. Bv
