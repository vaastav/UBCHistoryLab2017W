CHILDHOOD'S PRAYER.
The fire upon the hearth is low,
And thevj is stillness everywhere;
Like troubled spirits, here and ,
there
The firelight shadows uuttering go.
And as the shadows round me creep, ,
A childish treble breaks the gloom j
And softly from a farther room
Come, "Now I lay me down to sleep." !
And, some how, with that little prayer '
And that sweet treble in my ears,
My thought goes back to distant ''
years !
And lingers with a dear one there. 1
And as I hear the child's amen.
My mother's faith comes back to '
me?
Crouched at her side I seem to be,
And mother holds my hands again.
un, ior an hour in that dear place i
Oh, for the peace of that dear time! :
Oh, for that childish trust sublime! |
Oh, for a glimpse of mother's face!
Yet, as the shadows round me creep i
I do not seem to be alone?
Magic of that treble tone?
And "Now I lay me down to sleep." j

President Wilson's message to con- i
gress, delivered Dec. 6, is a master- 1
piece. It is the expression of pri'n- '
ciples and ideals that are fundamental
in our Democracy. So impressed aro j
we with the message that we will pub- ,
lish the whole message in next week's ;
Times, thus giving every reader an i
opportunity to read it for himself,
.mil.. - '
You will see by our "S. O. S." colj
umn, published elsewhere in this issue (
of The Times, that many of our friends
have remembered us. There are yet
many more who could renew and not
1 jpflf;1 tto >"' ? ? We feel sure, many yill 1
*' do so during December. The united
little sums will make up a big sum,
and that will help us greatly.
The Herald and News, of Newberry, ,
is to be congratulated upon the splen- 1
did special edition which was gotten <
out last week. The paper contained
fifty-six pages, ar.d a worthy thing
about it was that the reading matter
was most excellent. It is a boost for
Newberry and Newberry county that
will have great influence. The edition
was in celebration of the fiftieth anni- i
versary of the life of the paper. Best
wisnes 10 you, gentlemen:
: On Tuesday evening of this week
; there was a membership meeting of ,
; the Chamber of Commerce. The meet- |
ing was large and developed great enthusiasm.
Plans for immediately beginning
the campaign for subscriptions
in membership fees were made. 1
On the two days following this campaign
has been pressed. And the results
have been most gratifying. Indeed,
it has been a sweeping victory
so far, and it may be said, with as!
surance, that the Union Chamber of ^
. Commerce is now about to be placed
upon a solid financial basis. We be- ,
lieve this is one of the best moves
Union's business men have made in ,
many years.
A WARNING.
We do not relish telling people of
their faults; in fact, we try to find
something good, rather than something
evil, to say always. We do not
now pose as a guardian of thoughtless
people, nor do we assume that '
everybody is an idiot who does not
follow our advice. But we speak a
word of warning to the reckless automobile
drivers, and we speak it in good
faith and with good will. There is en- *
tirely too much careless driving, too
muen reckless driving going on in and 1
outside of the corporate limits for the
public good. The public safety is 1
jeopardized by the fast drivers. The
danger is one that is increasing almost 1
daily, as the number of automobiles i
increases. We feel sure that nine out
of ten owners of cars are blameless;
they use due care, and they are quite
willing to corporate in any movement j
looking to the just regulation of speed.
Ft is the tenth man, the hair-brained. ]
wild man, indifferent to the rights of (
others, pt haps vicious enough to care i
nothing for others?he is the man i
causing the trouble. He is fast travelling
to his downfall, and if he be (
open to reason he will take warning. J
The public has reached its uttermost (
limit of patience in the treatment it is
receiving from him. j

CAPTAIN CHARLES 8
WESLEY BOYI), *
t
Of the 15th South Carolina Regiment, i
C. S. A. s
I
By Mrs. L. J. llames. t
Some years after the Civil war in v
speaking of the Confederate soldiers, i
Major General Hooker of the United r
States Army said: "Search the world
over, and you will find nothing like I
them." How true this is of the brave h
sons of Union county, particularly so I
of Captain Charles Boyd, husband of
our esteemed honorary member, Mrs.
Maria Boyd.
I shall not attempt to write an
article on this noble man, but read a s
beautiful tribute written hv Professor t
Means Davis, a classmate and friend v
of Captain Boyd. c
Charles Wesley Boyd was born at c
Walterboro, S. C., March 27th, 1835. c
His father, Dr. Robert Boyd, was a I
physician at the time, but afterwards r
rave up his practice to enter the min- <1
istry of the Methodist church, in s
which he spent many fruitful years; ^
being well known in various parts of *
the State as a preacher of force, and s
u man of weight in his church. N
The Boyds wore Scotch Irish, hav- *
ing come to this country from the I
north of Ireland, but originally from *
Kilmarnock, in Scotland, a branch of *
the family having once been in pos- ^
session of the castle of that name. c
Charles was a second son and one of v
a large family of children. He was r
sent to the preparatory school at c
Cokesbury, and from there entered the
South Carolina college. Here lie took s
high mark as a student from the 8
first. He became a member of the 8
Euphradian society, and in his junior
year took the medal in that society for 51
oratory. In his senior year he took a
medal given by the college for an es- ^
say on Sir James Mackintosh. He 0
graduated from the college. He then j,
went to Germany to the University of
Cottengeil, where he maintained a ?
ligh stand, graduating after two 8
years with the degree of doctor of f
laws.
Mr. James Lowndes, in an address 0
at an alumni banquet held In Charles- c
ton a year or two ago, spe .ks of him 8
as follows: "I cannot close these re- ^
marks without performing the pious *
office of bearing my witness to the remarkable
ability of Charles Boyd. I ^
shall always remember the attic nights \
in his little room in a far-away Ger- (1
man university town, where he daz- v
zled his companions by his learning "
and ability. It was an evil day when
le fell at Chancellorsville in the front 1
sf the battle." 1
He returned home in 1858 and stud- r
ied law at Union, in the office of Judge J"
Goudelock, whose second daughter,
Maria, he married.
He began the practice of law at
Union in partnership with Judge Williarn
Wallace, in conjunction with
whom he edited the "Union Times." c
In 18(50 he threw himself heart and
soul into the secession movement, and !
made political speeches throughout his :
?ounty. He went to the ^oast at the 1
opening of hostilities in 1861, was
made orderly sergeant, and was present
at the taking of Fort Sumter.
He went to Virginia with Gregg's 1
First regiment, and when it was disbanded,
returned to Union, where he ^
used a company, received a captain's
commission and joined the Fifteenth L
South Carolina regiment.
He was with his command through- *
out the campaign in Virginia until he '
was killed at the battle of Chancellorsville,
May 2nd, 1868.
When Colonel DeSaussure was in- 1
formed of his death he said: "Cover
him with the regimental flag, for his
are the shoulders that should have
borne it." t
General Kershaw said: "Our State (]
has sustained a great loss."
Thus passed away in the full tide l
and promise of his youth one of South
Carolina's most loyal sons.
In estimating a man's character it
is always illuminative to know the I ^
impression made by his presence upon |
his contemporaries. The impression
made by Captain Boyd on the fellow
college students and friends in afterlife
seems well expressed by the fa- (
mous phrase of Matthew Arnold, j
"Sweetness and light." He was a
born student, a lover of art and literature,
a brilliant conversationalist, -
and withal, so genial and urbane, so J
kindly and sincere that wherever he ]
came men, women and children were
at once his friends.
Under normal conditions he would .
never have chosen the career of a sol'ier.
War, with its hardships and tur- <
moil, its suffering and bloodshed, was abhorrent
to him. But he was endowed
with the highest order of cour ge,
and an unwavering devotion to ri
duty, and wherever duty called he
went without questiofi. He believed
firmly in the righteousness of the t
South's cause, and in the obligation 0
of each one of her sons to give him j
self freely for it. His was not the p
enthusiasm of the young and ambi- e
tious soldier who goes into battle to
m-iiieve name ano iame lor himself, I
but the heroism of a martyr, who leaving
wife and children behind, offers
himself upon the altar of his country's
need. j
There came to mind the heautifui, solemn
lines of a ballad in Faust: 'Blest
he who dies in battle's splen- f
lor," and the old adapre of the (1 reeks: I
'Those whom the gods )ove die younpr,"
and certainly there are worse fates
for a man than to be spared the inevi- (
.able disappointments and disillusion- #
ments of life, and to die a noble death
11 the full flush and priory of his youth. ^
But there is another side to the
question, in the lives of such men as I
''aptain Boyd, the South even more ^
han in her impoverishment and de"eat,
paid a fearful debt to destiny. I
The old order has passed away. It (
s hard for us now to realize the hopes *
ind fears, the wild enthusiasm of the
reneration which went forth to fight
he war of secession. But the herosm
of those who took part in that
truggle should never be forgotten.
'Jo prouder heritage is possible than
he South's memory of the men and
vomen who bore gladly and bravely
ts dangers and losses, and last and
nore than all its bereavements."

lung in the South Carolina university
