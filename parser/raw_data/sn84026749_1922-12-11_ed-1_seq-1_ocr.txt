today dentad application of George
("Buck") Weaver, crack third base

Weaver, considered one of the
greatest players of s decade, waa
involved In the 1919 world series
scandal in which th? Chicago White
Sox, of which Weaver was a mem
ber, "threw" th? eertea to th? Cin
cinnati Reda.
Weaver alwaya haa maintained
he waa innocent, and during tha
famous "Black Sox" trial the Judge
recommended that Weaver'? case be
nolle pro??d.
"In ?pile of peralatent rumor? ths
fall and winter of 191? that there
had been crooked work during the
serie?, and Weaver knew his club
officials were endeavoring to ascer
tain the facts, he kept still," Judge
Landls' decision ?aid.
"Weaver denied he had anything
to do with the ocnsplracy aa alleged
in th? confeMion? and In testimony
given in the trials. ' However, his
own admission prevents his rein
statement."
The -decision reviewed the entire
Weaver ease, detailing how Weaver
had admitted he was approached by
Pitcher Eddie Clcotte before the 191!)
world series, and again by a repre
sentatlve of Olcotte at the start of
tho 1920 ?eeson With proposition? to

eau?? of the trouble was th? in
