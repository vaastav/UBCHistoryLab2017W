Report of ihe Mecretarjr of tbe Treas
ury. A presentation of the general condition of
the treasury and the important statistics were
embodied in the President's message; and the
plan of Secretary Chase for maintaining the
credit of the Government, was also briefly
argued by the President.
Secretary Chase's report is very lengthy,
and our space will permit of our giving only
the following abstract : , ' -
ESTIMATES OF THE DEBT. ,
SSThe estimated wants of the treasury for the
year ending on the 30th of June, 1862, were
exceeded by the actual expenditures. They
were based on estimates for an army of 300,
000 men, and for a naval force quite inconsid
erable in comparison with that found after
ward indispensable. Congress increased the
army to 500,000, in addition to special corps
num benng over 50,000. In consequence
of this, the estimates for July required correc
tion in December. For the reason that the
President has callei an add tiona; force of
(500,000 men, the estimates for the current fis
cal year must "prove inadequate. Themcrease
of debt did not, however, exceed the Decem
ber citlnuie. Ou tlie contrary, while the esti
mate sntK"p!tH a public, debt on the 30th
June, 1832, of 317,372,802 93, Its actual
amount on tlmt tiay was -314,211,371 92.
But the estimate of the debt on the 1st of Jrly,
18G3, must now 1 advanced, in view of the
uiMjw.iMii inermn of expenditures, authoris
ed and incurred, or likely to be incurred, to
1,122,7,403 24; anion the supposition
Dial the war may be continued with, undimin
ished disbursements until the lt of July,
1804, the debt likely to have beta then in-
umddnust tie estimated at 5l,744,6315b0,-
80. . , .
RECEIPTS AMD EXPENDITURES,
The annual receipts for the fiscal Tear of
1862 from all sources, including the balance of
82,257 ,0G5 80 in the treasury from the pre
ceding year, were $583,8X5,247 06; and t'rt
aggregate expenditures $570,841,700 2Zy
leaving a balance in the treasury July 1st,
lcUi'J, of 813,013,540 81. From the rtuiptt
and expenditure should be deducted the
amounta received and disbursed iurmg tha
Tear on account of permanent and temporary
debt, amounting to $96,096,922 09; leaving
the total reeeipts not applied ife payment of
debt, 3-o,ic-o,.J:tt yi, ana tbe total or cur
rent disbursements 8474,744,778 16
Both the amount of debt and the amount of
expenditure for last year fall short of the esti
mates. .. : ' .:, .' . ' !' !
The receipU of the first quarter of 1803
were $37,208,529 02, for the remainder of
the year the estimated receipts are $148,286-
816 58; making a total or $180,495,345 60,
adding lUc amount already received from loans
and the amounts anticipated, and the aggre
gate amount tor the year is S511,646,2d'J 96.

THE CURRENCY HOT YET DEPRECIATED.
The secretary does not concur in thn onin
km entertaiued by some, that the aggregate
currency of the country, composed of United
States notes and notes of corporations.' ia at.
this moment greatly in excess of legitimate
aeraanas ior its employment. Much less does
he concur iu another opinion, that anv actual
excess is due to the issues of United States
notes already in circulation. The i ignorant
fear of foreign investors in national and state
bonds and other American securities, and the
timiu alarms oi numerous nervous individuals
ut our own country, prompted large sacrifices
upon evidences of public and corporate indHht-
edness in our markets, and large purchases of
com ior remittances abroad or hsardmg at
home. Taking advantage of these and other
circumstances tending to an advance of gold,
speculators employed all the arts of the mar
ket to stimulate that tendency and carry it up
to tne in truest mini. mis nnint. wax manharl
on the 15th flay of October. Gold sold in the
market at a premium of 37 5-8 per cent.
The cause of all the redundancy of curreucy,
ii any, mat exists is easily tound in the state
ments of the banking corporations. The cir
culation of corporate notes increased during
tne year ending on tne istot November, 1862.
irom i w,wu.wu to lo.UliU.UOU. Durine
the same time the volume of deposits, which
answer very many of the purposes of circula
tion, had swelled from $264,000,000. to $344.
000,000. The greater portion of this increase
took place within the last seven months. The
augmeutation of deposits always accompanies
increase of circulation. Together they stimu
late loans, and are, in turn, stimulated by the
desire oi -tne interest derived trom loans. As
might have been anticipated, loans increased,
though not equally, with the circulation and
deposits. From $007,000,000 on the 1st day
of November, 1861, they had grown to 677,-
on the 1st day of November, 1862.
Here is an obvious and sufficient explanation
of whatever undue expansion may have taken
place. , , -,- -'"!,
A GOVERNMENT CURRENCY PROPOSED.
While the secretary repeats the preference
he has hertofore expressed for a United States
note circulation, even when issued directly by
the government, and dependent upon the ac
tion of the government for regulation and final
redemption, over the note circulation of the
numerous and variously organized and various
ly responsible banks now existing in the coun
try ; aud while be now sets forth, more .fully
than heretofore, the grounds of that prefer
ence, he still adheres to the opinion expressed
in his last report that a circulation furnished
by the government, but issued by banking as
sociations, organized nuder a general act of
Congress, is to be preferred to either... Such
a circulation, unilorm iu general ..characteris
tics, and amply secured as to prompt conver
tibily by national bonds deposited in the treas
ury, by the associatiens receiving it,, would
u:i te, in his judgment, more elements of
soundness and utility than can be combined in
any other. A circulation composed exclusive
ly of nou-s issued directly by the government,
