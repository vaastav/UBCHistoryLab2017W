Cantov, Ohio, Deo. 1.. Every bus
Inoss houso, tlio schools, the court
lionso and nil city olllces wore closed
nt noon to-day in tribute of respect
for Mrs. Nancy Allison MeKlnlcy,
mother of tlio President. Inst services
for whom worn performed In tlio 1'ImI
Methodist church this aflenoon. Uiiln
fell heavily nil dny, but hundreds o!
people Slithered in mid about tlio
church mid thousnuds walled In the
storm for tho passage of tho funeral
procession.
At 2 o'clock tho paljbonrcrs carried
tho ooilln into the crowded church and
tho president and Immediate members
of tho finally, the nolnblo mourners
from Washington and clo'.o friends,
fol owed and took reserved seats In
tho front of the church.
'i'ho Nov. Dr. Manchester, who was
n comrade In arms of the President
during the war, was u member of tho
futnous Twenty-third Olilo volunteer
Infantry, nml who had been tho pas
tor of tho First Methodist Episcopal
church for some years, delivered tho
principal address.
Ho said in part: "I think tho first
feeling that comes to us nil to-day
one of personal berouvoment. She
who hns ((oiio from our midst was u
frioiuL Tho nation knows her as the
(lcstlnguishcd mother; wo, of the home
city, knew her as ono whose kindly
words and smile have been n cheer
and n benediction to many u heart and
home.
"It Is not given to many to have
Mich graco of life, such perfection of
character as crowned her whose going
out from among us wo mourn to-day.
If I were to Indulgo In an analysis of
her character, I think I would place
first of nil her glorious motherhood.
This was tho crowning glory of her
days. She was by divine right the
general mistress of her own house.
Always tender nml true In her loving
sympathies, self-poised and sturdy In
her personal uprightness, sho rilled
like n queen over hor own home. Tho
law of kindness was tho law of hor
life, and nono know her there but to
feel tho gentle Iniluonco of her pres
ence. Sho might have been u proud
mother, but I think no one heard her
say so. Her great loving heart
throbbed with tendercit anxieties for
those whom the kind father hud given
her, and 'her children urlso up and
call hor blessed '
O "Another characteristic of Mother
McKlnlcy was her unvarying ehoor
fulness. When her pastor suggested
to her once that tho way must bo
growlug brighter ns sho advanced to
ward her heavenly home, she re
marked that It had baen bright all
tho way. And yet therj hud been
niuny and soro bereavements. She
trod for many weary years' tho path
of widowhood, She laid away her
lovo.l ones ono after another, but hor
loving cheer was nuver abated. It
was as if the sunlight from the throno
of God played upon her soul and kept
it warm and bright. And after all,
that was the ttubllino secret of her
dally existence. .Shn might havu said
to a sordid, grasping world in the
words of the Mnster whom she loved:
'I have meat to cat that yo know
not of.'
"Her faith that Ood does all things
(vol I, that He makes no mistakes, was
tho ono creed of her Christian life, for
i.ho was a Christian indeed. Undem
onstrative and unobtruslvo, yet sho
was well known as ono of "the dis
ciples of Christ. Until tlio infirmities
uf Increasing years made it Impossible,
sho frequented tho prnyor service and,
when she could no longer do
thnt, kept her plaeo in tho morn
ing service on tho Lord's day whore
her strong but gcntlo face was n
constant Inspiration to pastor und
worshippers. Now, tho end crowns
the work. Mm has come down to her
grave llko tlio well ripened grain,
ready for thu harvest Sho grow old
beautifully because sho wnlked with
God. Tho influence of hor llfo will af
ford such strength as earthly com
munion could not give,
"Ono who filled to tho very brim the
measure of being as sho did needs no
fulsome eulogy. Works of charity
llvo beyond tho doing, kindness brings
the harvest of tho bowing. Love out
lives the past, tho present and tho fu
ture. Tongues shall fall, but llfo en
dureth forever. Tho highest meed ol
pralso that can bo given is that which
tho Savior gave to the faithful woman
when He said: 'Sho bus dono we.l
what sho could.'"
After singing "Nearer, My God, to
Thee," benediction was pronounced
by tho Rev. Dr. McAfee, pastor of the
Hrond Street Methodist church of Co
lumbus, wh oh the President attended
while he was governor of Ohio.
The lid of tho eotlln was then re
moved and the largo congregation, ns
well ns many who had been uuablo to
gain admission to tho church, filed
past to tnko a last look of all that was
mortal of Mother McKluley.
Then tho family and friends entered
tho carriages and. followed bv tlinn.

"Vnllins will novcr bo reappointed

Stephens this morning,
"That appointment mndo by tho

"It Is well understood in Kansas

thnt ho would bo rolnstnted at the re

"That may ha true," said Mr.
Stephens, "but I glvo you my word
that their resignations will bo forth
coming If they try It. Why, that is
tho wor-st appointment that could pos
sibly hnvo been made from a political
point of view. Every Democratic pa

demned it.
"Do you supposo thero U tiny incen

know that tho commissioners aro to

"Why, such an appointment as that
would kill our entire Democratic or
