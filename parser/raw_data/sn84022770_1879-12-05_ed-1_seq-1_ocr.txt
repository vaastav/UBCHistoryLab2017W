HAVES' MESSAGE.
/•'. Haw ritizrm of thr Semite anil Home of
irsnitiitirr*: Tno memhers of the forty sixth
congress have assembled in their llrst, regular
session under circumstances calling for mutu
al congratulations and grateful acknowledg
nient tot he (iiver of all good for the large and
unusual incisure of national prosperity which
w c now enjoy.
n \tion \NCEs.
The most important events which have oc
curred in our public affairs since my last an
imal message to congress are connected with
the llnaiiciul operations of the government, dl
rectlv affecting the business interests of the
country. I congratulate congress 011 the suc
cessful execution of t tie resumption act. At
tln- time llxed arid the manner contemplated
by law I'. S. notes began to be redeemed in
coin. Since the first of January l ist liny have
been promptly redeemed on presentation, and
in all business transactions, public and private,
in all p irts of the country they are received
and paid out as the equivalent of coin The
demand upon the treasury for gold and silver
in exchange for b. S. notes has been compa*a
ii\cly sin ill and the voluntary deposit of coin
and bullion in exchange lor notes has been
wry large. The excess of the precious metals
deposited or exchanged for I*. S. notes over
the amount of I S. notes redeemed Is about
£lo.ooi MMJ.
The resumption of specie payments has
been followed by a very great revival of busi
ness. With a currency equivalent in value to
the money of the commercial world, we are
enabled to enter upon an equal competition
with other nations in trade and production.
Th.i increasing foreign demand for our niuuu
jßl'urcs and agricultural products, has caused
iTurge balaice of trade in our favor, which
In been paid In gold from the Ist of July last
to November 15th, to the amount of about
f.y.UMi.W. Since the resumption of specie
p.»\incuts there has been a marked and grati
fying Improvement of the public credit. The
binds of the government bearing only four
per cent interest, hive been sold at or above
r> tr. sufficient in amount to pay otf t hat part of
the national debt which was redeemable under
present laws. The amount of Interest saved
annually by the process of refunding the debt
since Nfareh 1, 1877.1 a $14,207,177. The bond*
wt re largely in small sums and the numher of
our citizens now holdingthe public teeurliies
1> much greater than ever before.
The amount of the national debt which ma
tures wiiiiin less than two years is
of w lii> ii s'>uo.nuo,ono bears interest at the rate
of tho per cent. It is believed that tills part
of tli" public debt ran be refunded by tho is
sue oi four per eetit. bonds; and by the reduc
tion of interest which will thus effected, about
can lie annually saved to the treas
ury T » secure this important reduction of
interest to be paid by the l T niled States, fur
ther legislation is requited whlcli it is hoped
will i».» provided by congress during ;ts present
session.
The coinage of gold by the mints of tho
United States dur'ng tin* last fiscal year was
Tho coinage of silver dollars since
the passage of the act for that purpose up to
Nov. 1, IHP.I, was of which
il have been Issued from the treasury and are
now in circulation, and ST.* :iun,or,o are still in
the possession of tho government.
The pendency of t In* proposition for unity of
action between the United States and the
principal commercial nations of Kurope to ef
fect a permanent system for the equ i Ity «>f
gold an I silver as the recognized money of
the world, leads me to recommend that con
gress ref aiu from new legislation on t he gen
eral subject. The groat revival of trade, in
ternal and foreign, will supply during tho com
ing your Its own Instructions, which may well
be awaited before attempting further experi
mental measures with the coinage.
I would, however, strongly urge upon cong
ress the importance of authorizing the secre
tary of t lie treasury to suspend the coinage of
silver dollars upon the present legal ratio.
The market value of the silver dollar being
uniformly and largely less than the market
valu » of tho gold dollar, it is obviously Im
practicable to maintain them at ptr with each
other If both are coined without limit. If
the cheaper coin is forced Into circulation, it
wi I, it coined without limit, soon become the
standard of value, and thus defeat the de
nbjecr, which is the currency of both
g|V and silver which shall lie of equivalent
dollar for dollar, with tho universally
recognized money of tho world. The retire
numl Irom circulation of United States notes
with capacity of legal tender in private con
tracts is a step to be taken in cur orogress to
ward a safe and stable currency which should
hi- accepted as the policy and duty of the gov
ernment and ths interest and security of tho
people. It is my firm conviction that the issue
of legal tender paper money based wholly
up ui the authority and credit of the govern
ment. except, in extreme urgency, is without
warranty of the constitution and a violation
of s nind financial principles. The Isuie of
I lilted States notes during tlio late civil war,
uiili the rapacity of legal tender between pri
vate Indlv uiuaSs, was unauthorized except as a
means of rescuing the country front imminent
peril. The circulation of these notes as paper
money for any protracted period of time after
the accomplishment «»f this purpose was not
conti-mpUto i by the fruiters of the law under
which they were issued. They anticipated the
redemption and withdrawal of these notes at
the earliest practicable period const-ti in with
the attainment of tlieohjeet for which they
Were provided. The policy of the rnited Mates,
steadily adhered to from the adoption of the |
< institution, lias been to avoid the creation of (
national delit, and when, from necessity in the |
time of war. debts have been created they i
have been paid off on the return of peace as
' Mildly as possible. With tliis view and for
purpose it is recommended that the exi-t
--laws for accumulation of a sinking fund
inn-Unit t«. extinguish the public debt within
limited period be maintained If any • hange

the citizens of Utah, in very considerable
number, uphold a practice which is con

with great unanimity by congress more than
17 years ago, but has remained until recently a
dead letter In the territory of Utah, because
of the peculiar diffi -ulties attending Its en

THE ELECTION*.
The elections of the past year, though nrcii
pied only with state officers, have not failed
to elicit on the p ditieal discussions which at
tended them all over the country,|ncw and de
cisive evidence of the deep interest which the
great hotly of citizens take in the progress of
the cotintrv toward a more general and ' om
plete establishment, at whatever cost, of mn
veisal freedom and security In the exercise of
the elective franchise. Wnile many topics ot
political eoneern demand great attention from
otir people, hot!) in the sphere of national and
state authority I find no reason to qualify the
opinion 1 expressed in my last annual message
that no temporary or administrative Interests
of gi;yernm<'nt, however urgent or weighty,
will ever display the zeal of our people in the
defense of the' primary rights of crizensldp
and that the power of public opinion will over
ride all p.ill leal prejudices and all sectional
and state attachm ills. In demanding that, ail
over our wide territory the name and charuc- '
tor of citizen-of the I'nited States shall in an j
one and the same thing, and carry with them '
unchallenged security and respect I earnestly ;
appuil to the intelligence and patriotism of ail ■
good citizens of every part of the country, i
however much they may lie divided in opinions j
oi» ot her political sub j »cts to unite in com pel I- ;
lug ot» 'dience to existing laivs aimed at the |
protection of the right of suffrage. I respect
fully urge upon congress t«» siiptdv any defects
in these laws which experience Ins shown and
which it has with its power to remedy. I again
invoke e<> operations of cx«cuti\e and legisla
live authoritiesjof state- in t ids great purpose.
I am fully convinced that if the public mind
can beset at re t on tips pirauiotint ques-j
tion of popular rights, no serious objection i
will thwart or delay the complete pacification :
of the country or retard the general dlffu- I
sion of prosperity.
ItEKOUMINQ TltK CIVIL SEItVICE.
In a former message I invited the atttentlon
of congress to the subject of the civil service
of the government and «xpressed the inten
tion of transmitting to congress as early as
practicable a report upon tills subject by the
chairman of the civil scrvicacoiniuissioii. In
view of the fact that during a considerable
period the government of Ureat IMtain has
been dealing with administrative problems and
abuses in various particulars analogous to
those presented in this country, and that in
recent years the methods adopted were under
stood to have been effective and in every re-!
sped highly satisfactory, I thought it desira- [
tile to have fuller information up »n the sub
and accordingly requested the chairman j
of the cl\ll service commission to make a
thorough investigation for tlds purpose. The
result has been an elaborate and comprehen
sive report. The report sets forth the history
of the partisan spoils custom intbeat Britain,
and ot the rise and fall of the parliamentary
patronage and of official iuterferene » with the
freedom of elections. It shows that after long
trials of various kinds of examinations, those
which are competitive and open on equal
terms to all, and which are carried on under
the superintendence of a single commission
have with great a Ivantage been establlsed as ,
conditions, of aduilssi-ui to almost every of
ficial place in the subordinate i Imiulstration
of that country and of ItriM&u India. The
completion of the report, owing to the extent \
of the labor involved in its preparation and
the omission of congress to make any provis
ion, cither for compensation or the expense of
the commission, hits been postponed until the
present time. Jt Is herewith transmitted to
congress. While reform measures of another
government are of no authority for us, they
are entitled to influence to the extent to which
their intrinsic wisdom and their adaption to
our institutions and stcitllife may commend
them to our consideration-
COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS.
The views I have heretofore expressed con
cerning the defects and the abuses In our civil
administration remain unchanged, except in
so far as an enlarged experience lias opened
my sense of the duty both of officers and of
the people themselves to co-operate for their
removal. The grave evils and perils of a par
tisan spoils system of appointment to office i
are i.ow generally recognized in resolu- i
tions of the great parties, In the reports ol I
departments, in the debates and proceedings
of congress, ami in the messages of executives.
The gravity of these evils has been pointed
out, and the need of their reform has been
admitted. To command the necessary sup
port, every measure of reform must be based j
oil common right and justice andj must be
compatible with the healttiy existence of the I
great parties which are inevitable and essen- j
tial in free state. When the people have ap
pioved a policy at a national election confi
dence on the part of the officers they have
selected, and of the advisers who. in accord
ance with our political institutions, should be
consulted in the policy which is their duty to
carry into effect Is indispensable. It Is eni'-
iienlly proper that they should explain it be
fore the people, as well as illustrate its spirit
in the performance of their official duties. It
need hardly be pointed out that very different
considerations apply to the greater number of
those who till the subordinate places in the
civil service. Their responsibility is to their
superiors in official position. It is their duty
to <»bey tne legal instruction* of those upon
whom that authority is devolved, and their
best public service consists in the discharge of
their functions irrespective of partisan poll
tics. Their duties are tho same whatever party
is in power and whatever policy prevails. As
a consequence, it follows that their tenure of
office should not depend upon the prevalence
nl any policy or the supremacy of any part*
but should be determined by their capacity to
serve i In* peopiu iiiuot usefully* quite irreHppi *
live of partisan interests. The same consider
ation* that should govern the tenure i f office,
should al*n prevail in the appointment, di*ei
l>!liii* ami removal of t!i ♦*-*** subordinates. I lie

ments and removals to mere Influence and fa
i vorit.es. If it is the right of the woithiest
claimant to gain appointment and the interest
of the people to bestow it on him. It would
seem clear that a just and wisemeth «d of as
certaining the personal fitness for office must
need be an important and permanent function
of every just and wise government. It has
long since become impossible, in the great of
fices, for those having the duty of nomination
and appointment, to personally examine Into
i the individual qualifications of more than a
small proportion of those seeking office, and
! with the enlargement of the civil service that
j propottioii must continue to become less.
In the earlier years of the government thesu
! ordinate offices were so few in number that it
j was easy for those making appointments and
i promotions to personally ascertain the wants
!of the candidates. Party managers and meth
! ods had not then become powerful agencies of
! coercion, hostile to the free and just- exercise
iof the appointing power. A large and re
! sponsible part of the duty of restoring the
civil service to the desired puritvand efficiency
I rests upon tlje president, and it has been my
i purpose to do what is within my power to ad
vance such prudent and gradual measures of
reform as will most surely and rapidly bring
about that radical change of system essential
to make our administrative* methods sathfae
| tory to a fair and Intelligent people. Hy a
t proper exercise of authority It Is in the power
of the executive to do much to promote such
a reform, hut it cannot be too clearly uudcr
stood that nothing adequate can be accom
plished without co-operation on part of con
gress, and considerate and intelligent support
i among the people. Reforms which challenge
' the gcner.illv accented tliories of parties and
demand changes in tae methods of deparf-
I ments are not- the work of a day. Their per
| maticnt foundations must be laid in sound
! principles and i > an experience which uemon
; st rates their wisdom and exposes the errors of
the adversaries. Every worthy officer desires
j to make his official action a gain and an honor
i to ins country, but the people demand tar
more of tludr officers in public station. They
; are interested in a pure, economical and vigor
i oiis administration. Hy laws enacted In 185J
and lMa'i and now, In substance, Incorporated
in the revised statutes,the practice of arbitrary
appointment to the several subordinate grades
in the great departments was condemned, an<l
t xaminations as to the capacity to be con
ducted by departmental 'nurds of examin
ers, were provided for and made a condition
of admission to the public service. These
statutes are a decision by congress that exam
inations of some sort as to attainments and
capacity, are essential to the well being of the
public service. The im: ortant questions since
the cn .cioit'iit. of these laws have been as to »
the character of the examination, and u hetlier
official favor and partisan influence, or com
mon right and merit were to control exam
inations. In practice these examinations have
already been open to worthy persons generally
who might wish to lie examined official and
partisan favoritism as a rule appears to have
designated those who alone were permitted to
go before the examining hoards, subjecting
even the examiners to a pressure from the
friends of the candidates, a very great difficul
ty to resist. As a cor sequence the standard of
admi-sion fell below thai which the puidlc in
terest demanded. It was almost Inevitable
that a system which provided for various sep
arate boards of examiners with 110 common
supervision or uniform method of procedure
should result in confusion, inconsistency ami
Inadequate test of capacity highly detrimental
to the public interests. Further and more
radical change was absolutely required.
In the annual message of December, KO. my
predecessor declared that there Is no duty
which ;«o much embarasses the executive and
heads of departments as that of appointment;
nor is there any such arduous and thankless
labor imposed on senators and representatives
as that of find ng places for constituents. The
present system does not secure the best men
and often not even flt men for public places.
The elevation and purification of the civil ser
vice of the government will be hailed with ap
proval by the whole people of the United
State#. Congress, accordingly passed the act
approved March ;1, 1874. to regulate the civil
service of the United Kates and promote the
efficency thereof, giving tlie necessary author
ity to the executive to Institute a civil scrv ce
relorin. A ting under this statute which is
interpreted as intended to secure a system of
just and effectual examinations under super
vision; a number of eminently competent per
sons were selected for the purpose. They en
tered with zeal upon the discharge of their
duties, prepared with an intelligent apprecia
tion of the requirements of tlie service and
t lie regulations contemplated; and took charge
of the examinations. In their capacity as a
board they have been known as the "civil ser
vice commission." Congress, for two years,
appropriated the money needed for the com
pensation, and for the expense of carrying on
the work of tlie commissi »n. It appears from
the report of the commission, submitted to
the president in April, 1874, that examinations
had been held in various sections of trie coun
try, and that nil appropriation of about $25.-
t>o» would lie required to meet the annual ex
penses. including salaries involved, in dis
charging the duties of the commission. The
report was transmitted to congress by special
message of April 18, |S74. with the following
favorable comment upon the labors of the
commission: "If sustained by congress I
have no doubt the rules can, after the expe
rience gained, be so improved and enforced
as to still more materially benefit the public
service and relieve the executive, members of
congress and the heads of departments from
influence prejudicial to good administration.
The rules as they have hitherto been enforceu
have resulted benetlcally, as is shown by the
opinions of the members of the cabinet and
the subordinates in the departments, and in
that opinion 1 concur." In the annual mess
age of December of the same year, similar
v lews are expressed, and ail appropriation for
continuing the work of tlie commission again
advised.
The appropriation was not made, and as a
consequence the active work of the commis
sion was suspended, leaving the commission
itself still in existence without the means
therefor of causing qualifications to he tested
in a systematic manner «>r of securing fur the
public service the udvantages**of competition
upon any extensive plan. 1 recommended In
my annual message of December, ISTT. tlie
making of an appropriation for the re umption
of the work of the commission. In the mean
time, however, competitive examinations un
der many embarrassments have been conduct
ed within bunted sphere in the executive de
partments In Washington, and in a number of
ilie custom houses and post offices of the priti
< ipal cities of the country with a view ol fur
ther testing their effects. and they have been
found to lie as salutary us they are sttted to
have been under the administration of my
predecessor. 1 think the economy, purity and
etlleiency of the public service would be
greatly promoted l»y their systematic introduc
tion wherever practicable throughout tlte en
tire civil service of the government, together
with ample provision for their general super
vision in order to secure consistency and uni
form justice. Deports from the secretary of
tlie interior, from the postmaster general, from
the postmaster in the city of New York, where
such examinati »ns have been some time on
trial; and also from the e ilUvtor of the port
the naval officer and the surveyor in that city
and tlie postmasters and collectors in several
of the oilier large cities, show that the eoni
petit vo system wiiere applied has in vh
riott« way-contributed t » improve the public
service. The report shows that the results
have been *aiutarv in a marked degree, and
that the general application of similar rules
cannot fail to be of decided beiieflt totheser
vice I lie reports of the government officers in
the eit vof New York especially bear decided
te-» intoiiy to the efficiency of open coiiqK'titivc
c\iminatio s in their respective offices show
ing that these examinations and the excellent
«11> iltflcatioiis ot those admitted to the aervice
tiiroiigii tlieiu have had a marked incidental
effect upon the peraona previously in tin* ser
vice. and particularly upon those aspiring to
promotion. There has Ihmmi on the part « f
tin- litter an iinTetsed Interest In tlie w«»r*%
and a de-ire to « xteiid acquaintance with it
beyond n particulai desk, ami thus the moral
wf the entire force ha- been raised. The ex
annua'i- lis have been attended tiy inauv citi
i gens, who have had au opporiumiy to
thoroughly investigate the scone and char
acter of trie test, and the method of determin
ing tho results, and these visitors have, with
out exception, approved the methods employ
ed, and several of them have publicly extended
their favorable opinion. Upon such con
siderations 1 deem it my duty to renew tlie
recommendations contained in my annual
message of December. 1877, requesting con
! gross to make t ie necessary appropriation tor
tne resumption of tho work of the civil ser
vice commission. Economy will lie promoted
by authorizing a moderate compensation to
persons in the public service, who may per
form extra labor upon or under the commis
sion, as the executive may direct. 1 am con
vinced that It a just and definite test of merit
is enforced for admission to the public ser
vice and in making promotions, such ahum** as
removing without good cause, uud partisan
and oflici «1 interference with the pioper exer
cise of the appointing power, will In a large
measure disappear. 1 here are other adminis
trative abases to which the attention of con
gress should be asked in this connection.
Mere partisan appointment and tho constant
nerii of removal without cause, very naturally
lead to an absorbing and mischievous political
activity on the part of those appointed, which
not only interferes with the due discharge of
official duty, but it is incompatible witli tiie
freedom of elections and witnout warrant.—
in the view of several of mv predecessors in
the presidential office and directly in accord
ance with tho law of 1874, already cited.l en
deavored by the regulation made on the
*--' d of June, JB7B, to put some reasonable limits
to such abuses. It may not be easy, and may
never, perhaps, be necessary to dellne with
precision the proper limit of political action
on tho part of federal officers, Imt while their
ri lit to hold and freely express their opm- !
PUIS cannot lie questioned, it is very plain that ]
they should neither l»e allowed l«» devote to
oilier objects the lime needed lor the proper!
discharge of their official duties, nor to use
authority of their office to enforce their own
opinions, or to coerce tlie political action of
those who hold different opinions. Reason of
justice and public policy quite analagoiis to
which, forbid the use of official power f«r the
oppression of the private citizen to impose up
on tlie government the duty of protecting its
officers and agents from arbitrary exaction in
whatever aspect considered. The practice of
making levies for party purposes upon the
salaries of officers, is highly demoralizing to
the public service, and discreditable to the
country. Though an officer should be as free
as any other citizen to give his own money in
aid of his opinions or his party, he should also
be as free i»s any other citizen to refuse to
make such gifts, if salaries arc hut a fair com
pensation lor the time and labor of the officers
it is gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. If
they are made excess'vo In order flint they
in iy bear i.ve tax. the exc as »s an indirect
robbery of the public minis. i recommend,
the. oiore, such revision aiiu extension of the
present statute as shall secure to those in
every grade of official life or publei employment
the protection with which a great and enlight
ened nation should guard those who urc faith
ful in its service.
THE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.
Our relations with foreign countries have con
tinued peaceful. With Great Hritaiu there are
still unsettled questions growing out of the
local laws of tiie maritime provinces and the
actions of provincial authorities, deemed to
l>e in derogation of rights secured by Ameri
can fishermen. The United States minister in
Londou has been instructed to present a de
mand for •Mi"' ,305 02 in view of the damages
received merloan elevens at Fortune bay
in JanuttrfAJ ZB. The ' i Vet has been taken
into collator) nlon by tiA Hritish government,
and an early reply is anticipated upon the
completion of the necessary examinations.
The subject of our participation in the pro
vincial fisheries, is regulated by treaty, will at
once be brought to tne attention of the Ilrit
ish government with a view to an early and
permanent settlement of the whole question,
which wus only temporarily adjusted. Efforts
have been made to obtain tho removal of re
strictions lound Injurious to the exportation
of cattle to the United Kingdom. Some cor
respondence lias also occurred with regard to

INTEKNATION AL EX 111BITION8.
In accordance witli the joint resolutions of
the last session of congress, commissioners
were appointed to represent the United States
at the two international exhibitions in Aus
tralia. one of which is now in progress at
Sydney and the other to lie held next year at
Melbourne. A desire has been expressed by
our merchants and manufacturers
in the important and growing trade with Aus
tralia, thut an increased provision should be
made by congress for tlie representation of
our industries at the Melbourne exhibition of
next year, and the subject is respectfully sub
mitted to your favorable consideration.
THE NEW FRENCH CARLE.
The assent of the government has been given
to the landing, on the coast of Massachusetts,
of anew and independent transatlantic cable
between France, byway of the French island |
of M. Pierre, and this country, subject to any
future legislation of congress. On this sub
ject the conditions imposed before allowing
this connection with our shores to be estab
lished, are such as to secure Its competition
with any existing or future lines of marine
cable, and preclude amalgamation thei ewith; o
provide for the entire equality of rights to our
government and people with those of France
in the use of the cable and prevent any ex
clusive possession of the privileges as accorded
by Francs to the disadvantage of any future
cab e communication between France ami the
I'nited States, which msy be projected and
accomplished by our citizens, and un iuij ort
ant reduction. The present rate of communi
cation with Europe is felt to be too burden
some to the interests of our commerce that
must necessarily flow from the establishment
of this competing line. The attention of
congress was drawn to the propriety of
some general regulation by congress of the
whole subject ot trans-marine cables by my
pre leeessor in his mes. age of December 7.1875,
and I respectfully submit to your consideration
fhe importance of »ongressiotial action in this
matter.

A question of grave importance with Spain,
growing out of the incidents of the Cuban in
surrection. have been for the most part happi
ly ami honorably settled. It may be reason
ably anticipated that the commission now sit

eases in tills connection will soon be able to
bring its labors to a conclusion. The standing !
qu stioii of East Florida claims has lately been |
renewed as a subject of corresp utdence, and I
in tv possibly require congressional action for
its tinal disposition.

A change of the peisonal head of the gov
ernment of Egypt has taken place. No change,
howsver, lias occurred in the relations between
Egypt and the United States. The action of
the Egyptian government in presenting to the
city of New York one off the ancient obelisks
which possess such historical interest, is high
ly appreciated as a generous mark of interna
tional regard. I f prosperity should attend the

Tire treaty recently made between Japan and
the United States in regard to the revision of

billowed bv similar action on the part of other
treaty powers. Tho attention of congress is
again invited to the subject of the indemnity
funds received some years since from Japan and
China, which, with t heir accumulated interest,
now amount to considerable sums. If any
part of these funds is justly due to American
citizens they should receive it promptly; and
whatever may have been received by the gov- j
eminent In excess of strictly just demands ,

The government of China has signified its
willingness to consider tho question of the

injurious consequences to the United States.
The negotiations are still proceeding and will
be pressed witli diligence. A question having
arisen between, Japan and China about the Loo

STOPPING Tim 11DKDER RAIDS.
It. Is a gMtilUation to lie able o announce
that through the judicious and energetic ac
tion of the military commanders of the two
nations on each side of the Klo Grande, under
the instructions of their respective govern
ments raids and denredations have greatly
decreased, and In the localities where formerly
destructive have now almost ceased. In Mew
of this result, I entertain a confident expecta
tion of the continuance of tiie prevalence of
quiet.
On the modification of the two countries, the
third installment of the award against Mexi

18H8, was duly paid and lias been put in course
of distribution in pursuance of tho act of
congress providing for the same. The satis
factory situation between tho two countries
leads me to anticip ite an expansion of our
t**ade with Mexico and an increased coiitribur
tion of capital and industry by our people to
the development of the great resources of
that country. I earnestly commend to the
wisdom of congress the provision of suita
ble legislation looking to uiis result.
SOUTH AMERICAN RELATIONS.
Diplomatic Intercourse with Columbia Is
Hzain fully restored by the arrival of a minis
ter from that country to United States. This
Is especially fortunate, in view of the fact that
the question ol an inter-oceanic canal has re
cently assumed a new and important aspect
and is now under discussion with the Central
American countries through whoso territory
the canal by the Nicaragua route would haw
to pass Distrusted that enlightened states
manship on their part will sea that the early
prosecution of such a work will largely inure
to the beuellt. not only of their own citizens
and those of the United States, but of the
commerce of the civilized world. It. la not
doubted that should the work be undertaken
under the protective auspices of the United
States and U|H>n satisfactory concessions for
the right of way and its security lytlie Cen
tral American Governments, the capital for
its completion would readily be furnished
from tilts country and Kurope, which might,
failing such guarantees, prove inaccessible.
Diplomatic relations with China have also
been.strengthened bv the reception of a ill 'Tils
ter front that country.
The war between Tern, Bolivia and Chill
still continues. The United States have not
deemed it proper to mterposo in the matter,
further than to convey to ail the governments
concerted, the assurance that the fliundly of
fices of the government of the United States
for the restoration of petce upon an honora
ble basis will he extended, in case the belliger
ents shall exhibit a readiness to accept them.
Cordial relations continue with Brazil and
the Argtulinc Republic and trade with those
countries is improving. A provision for regu
lar and more frequent mail communication in
our own ships, between the ports of this coun
try ami t lie nations of South America, seems
to me to deserve the attention of congress as
an essential precursor of an enlargement of
our commerce with them and ail extension of
our carrying trade.
'Hie recent revolution in Venezuela has been

tion of constitutional forms.

There is gratifying increase of trade with
nearly all European ami American countries,
and it is believed that with judicious action in
regard to its development it can and will be
still more enhanced, and that American prod
ucts and manufactures will find new and ex
panding markets. The reports of diplomatic
and consular offices upon this subject under
the system now adopted have resulted in ob
taining much valuable information, which lias
been and will continue to bo laid before cong
ress and the public from time to time.
THE CONDITION OF ALASKA.
The third article of the treaty with Russia of
March 80, 1807, by which Alaska was ceded to
the United States, provides that tlie inhabi
tants of ceded territory with the exception of
the uncivilized native tribes shall be admitted
to the enjoyment of all rights of citizens of
tlie United Mates, and shall lie maintained and
protected in the free enjoyment of their lib
erty of propert> and religion. I lie unelvilized
tribes are subject to such laws and regulations
in the United Mates may from time to time
adopt in regard to the aboriginal tribes of that
country. Uoth the obligations ot this treaty
and the necessities of the people require that
some organized form of government over the
territory of Alaska he adopted. There ap- j
pears to be no law for the arrest of persons .
charged with common law offences—such as .
assault, robbery and murder, and no magistrate :
authorized to issue or execute process in sue i !
cases. Serious difficulties have already arisen i
from offenses of this character, not only i
among the original Inhabitants but among cit- ,
izens of the United states and other countries
who have engaged in mlnin+r, tldiing and other
business operation* within the territory. A

Ing three quarters of the year, the expenditures
are estimated at SI7E, Ilil.Bl I !10, making the to*
tal expenditures s2rt4.u»MK)», and leaving an es
timated surplus revenue for the year endlntr
June 30, 1880, of ♦Jt.OUO.IWO. The total receipts
during the next llseal year ending June 30, 1881.
estimated according to existing laws, will be
sSßß,uuU.i*K>, und the estimated ordinary expen
ditures for the same period will bo s~'rH,oSi7,3tV4-
3<l for that year. The large amount expended
for arrears of pensions during the last and the
present ttscal year, amounting to $21;747.24# t».
has prevented the application of the full
amount required by law to the sinking fund
for the eurrent year, but these arrears having
been substantially paid, it Is believed that the
sinking fund van hereafter be maintained
without any change of existing law.
THE AKMT AND SAW,
The secretar, of war reports that the war
department estimates for tae llseal year end
ing June 3d, 1881, are $40,380,4:28 id, the same be
ing for a less sum of money than any annual
estimates rendered to congress from that de
partment during a period of at least twelve
years. He concurs with the general of the
army In recommending such legislation as will
authorize the enlistment of the full number of
WOO men for the line of the army, exclusive
of the 3400 men required for detached duty,
and therefore not available for service In ths
Held. Heulso recommends that congress be
asked to provide by law for the disposition of
a large number of abandoned military posts
and icseivatlons which, though very valuable
ill themselves, have been rendered useless for
military purposes by the advance of civiliza
tion and, settlement. He unites with the quar
termaster general in recommending that an
appropriation be made for the construction of
a cheap and perfectly llreproof Imliding for
the safe storage of a vast amount of money,
accounts, vouchers, claims and other valuable
records now in tlie quartermaster general's
office and exposed to a great risk of total de
struction by lire. He also recommends. In
conformity with the views of tliu judge advo
cate general, some declaratory legislation In
reference to the military statute of limita
tions as applied to the crime of desertion. In
these several recommendations I concur.
The secretary of war further reports that the
work tor the Improvement of the south pasa
of the Mississippi river, under contract with
Mr. James H. Kads, made ill pursuance of an
act of congress, lias been prosecuted (luring
the pusl year with a greater measure of suc
cess In the attainment of results than during
any previous year. The channel through the
south pass, which at the beginning of June,
bad a depth of only seven unu one-half
feet of water, had on thesth of July, 1879, a
minimum depth of twenty-six feet, having a
width of not less than 200 feet and a central
depth of thirty feet. Payments have been
made ill accordance with tlie statute as the
work progressed, amounting 111 tlio aggregate
to sl,2~>o,uuu, and further payments will be
come due. as provided by the statute, in tha
event of success in maintaining the chauuel
now secured.
The reports of the general of the army and
of his subordinates, present a lull and detailed,
account of the military operations for tha
repression of hostilities among the Indians of
the Uteand Apache tribes, and praise is justly
awarded to the officers and troops engaged,
for promptness, skill and courage displayed.
The past year has been one of almost ue
broken peace and quiet on the Mexican fron
tier. and there is reason to believe that tbe ef
forts of this government and of Mexico to
maintain order la that region will prove per
manently succe-sfui. This department wan
enabled during tbe past year to liud temporary,
though crowded aououunodatton* and a safe
depository for a portion of Its records in the
complete east wing of the building designed
for the state, war and navy departments.
The construction of the north wing of tho
building, a part of structure intended lor tha
use of the wur department is being carried for
ward with all possible dispatch, and the worjt
should receive from congress such liberal ap
propriations as will secure its speedy comple
tion.
The report of the secretary of the navy shows
continued improvement in that brunch of the
service during the ilscul year. Extensive
repairs have been made upon vessels apd two
new ships have been completed and made ready
for sea. The total expenditure of the year ended
June .10, ls7t>, Including specific appropriations
not estimated for by the department were 913>-
555,710 00. The expenses chargeable to the year,
after dcductlug the amount of these specific ap-
Jiropriations, were 911.343,317 70 ; but this suh
eet to a reduction of 9088,735 00. that amount
having been drawn upon warrants but not paid
out during tho year. The amount of appropria
tions applicable to the last tlseal year was 94,-
538,040 17 1 there was, therefore, a baiapce oC
91,470,051 37 remaining unexpended and to tho
credit of the departmeut on June 30, 1870. Tho
estimates for tile fiscal year ending June 30, 1881,
are 914,804,138 15, which exceeds the appropria
tions lor the present fiscal year by $01,807 38.
'1 he reason for this iucrcase is explained in tho
secretary's report. The appropriation availa
ble lor the present fiscal year are 914,503,350 117,
which will, in the opinion of the. secretary,
answer all the ordinary demands of the service.
The amount drawn from the treasury from July
1 to November 1, 1870, was s\77o,4tu 17, of which
91.005.440 33 lias been refunded, leaving as tho
expenditure for that pciiod 54.074,003 70. If tlia
expenditures of the remaining two-thirds of the
year do not exceed the proportion for tilers, four
mouths, there will remain unexpended at the
end of the year 9477,350.30 of the current ap
propriation. I lie report of the secretary shows
the gratifying fact that among all the disbursing:
officers of the pay corps of the navy there is not
one who is a delimiter the extent of a single
dollar. I nnite with hint, iq recommending the
removal of the observatory to a more healthful
location, that iusti'utiou retlects credit upon
the ual ion and lias obtained the approbation of
scientific men in all part* of the world. Its re
mo\al from its presant, locality would not only ha
conducive to the health but to its usefulness.
JUPKTAL, KXPENBBS.
The appropriation bills for judicial, expenses.
Which have heretofore been made for the depart
ment of justice ip gross, was subdivided, st tlio
last session of congress, and no appropriation
whatever made was lor the payment of the fees
of marshals and their deputies, either in the ser
vice of process or for the discharge of oilier
duties, and sijice June 311 the oilieers have con
tinued the performance of their duties without
compensation from the government, taking upon
themselves the necessary incidental outlays as
well as rendering their own services. In only n
few unavoidable instances lufs the proper execn
tion of the process of the United States failed by
reason of the absence of tho requisite appropria
tion. This course of official conduct.on the part
of these officers, highly creditablo to their fidel
ity, wo* advised by the attorney general, who in
formed them, however, that they would necessa
rily have to rely for their compensation upon the
prospect of future legislation by congress. I
therefore especially rooouunend that immediate
appropriation be made by congress tor this pur
|HTlic act making the principal appropriation for
the departmeut of justice at previous sessions
