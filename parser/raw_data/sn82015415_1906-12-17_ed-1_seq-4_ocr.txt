Wireless
Telegraphy
Constant and decisive progress
in the range, reliability, ami utility
of wirelesi telegraphy is continu
ally being made. Some of the most
recent noteworthy advances have
been made on the Pacific Coast.
It was only a short time ago that
2t wa Kf.nvciI as a tat tarn., unequalled teat, that wireless message
kmi been exchanged between Mare Island navy yard ami the Brcmrr
Um rnorr yard. Now comes the announcement that message ha.
between the giwenunent wireless station at rmt
the futmnntnt wireless station at Pnget SjuiuI. 1200
away. Both the long distance exchanges were overland ami
aero the water- ot the x-ean, which makes them all the Minn
as dMkuittes in long distance transmission have been
that hare not been encountered in operations at sea.
these dificufties are is ohcore to the layman, and apparently
to the expert. Bnt constant effort is betns; made to find
they are awl to overcome them, and apparently with much
A large assortment now on exhibition.
JYactkaEv aB Atlantic liner of the first class arc equipped with
afforatas, and reports of slops keeping constantly in touch
1 the land tbroBgfaont the to age, first with one side and then with
the other, arc frequent, though it is not to be understood that this is
or common. Still reports are not infrequent. The feat of
from Pomt Loma to Puget's Sound, is almost equal in
ami overland at that, to the best that is done in communi-
with trans-Atiantic finer?.
3Tct with aD this progress there does not seem to be any worry
the owners ot swb-roanne cables that their expensive plants
aril! he rendered obsolete or valueless by the progress of wireless.
Htm hues oi sab-marine cable are constantly being projected and
laid, and extensions of fines already in existence, are being made.
It seems very probably that w hatever advances wireless telegraphy
may make, it wiB never entirely supersede submarine cables and land
systems of telegraph. It is quite probable that the two systems may
each find a place, complementing each other but not interfering with
each other, just as telegraph and telephone systems have done
There was a period in the early development of the telephone when
it was freely predicted that it would eventually and speedily supersede
the telegraph. Bnt it hasn't. Telegraph systems have constantly ami
sicaduy developed and expanded, and increased their business while
at the same time telephone lines have parallelled them between every
crty and town, ami almost every hamlet in the country, and parallelled
them a hundred iultl between important cities and towns, while the
wrboie United States is a net-work of cross country and neighborhood
systems of telephones.

Considerable light is being shed
on the President's utterances on
the Japanese question in his mes
sage to congress. Files of the
coast papers published since the
message was sent to congress, con
tain a good deal of information
that is pertment. The total effect of it all is to create the impression
that most of what the President said in his message on this subject,
was for diplomatic use and not for the purpose of influencing congres
sional action. It indicates that Roosevelt was not even "sparring
tor wind," as some thought he was, because of the supposed menacing
attitude of Japan.
As appears fully from an interview with the United States Attor
ney published in the Sart Francisco Gironicle, and republished in this
issue ot the Star, the Department of Justice is not nearly so cocksure
cither of the low state of civilization and morals in San Francisco, or
of the illegality of the action of the San Francisco Board of Educa
tion, as the President in his message is. There is nothing of the
jtooseveKian trucculence :n the attitude taken by the Department of . ?
jbmkc. ine aiutirae ot mat department is that it is a question for
the courts, Tiris has been the attitude of San Francisco and Califor
aD the time. From this it seems probable that Secretary Metcalf's
eport, which has not yet been allowed to see publicity, indicated that
JwobaMj neither California nor San Francisco had exceeded their
rts. Jnst at the time, this Has not what the President needed in his
dpkmiatic business, so the Secretary's report was suppressed, and the 1
ffmmnations of the message were given to congress and the country. I
Following the publication of the message come widelv published '
tlTf ""PMcncs indicating that the President has already pro-1 :V.V
ceeded far m bis negotiations with the Japanese government bv "which
iaborers from either country will be excluded frnm tl, ti,,. ' f-.. I:.?:?r
a America in general and American laborers are concerned the ex
clusion of American laborers from Japan will cut very little figure
tor the reason that few if any Americans ever go to Japan to labor!
An,e7C3,n hbortrs cannot stand the competition of Japanese labor
"'FLuI Zn coomr' what cbance would they have in Japan -
On the other hand, such an agreement would bc satisfactory to
the Japanese who have been insisting on their equality with Iiuro
peans Ifom the motive of race pride and national sensitiveness. They
nare insisted on the most favored nation clause. But the proposed
reement w mld put them on an equal footing, in the abstract with
.Americans, which ought to be satisfactory to anybody. At the same
t'!t 5 wi,h wat has been believed to be Japan's policy for her
people. Jpan has sought territorial opportunity for the expansion oi
er people. She sees that she is more likely to find this in Asia than
m America. Formosa is now hers. Korea is virtually hers, while
iTM Tn1- PPntfj only needs concentra
tion of effort to make Manchuria hers. She needs her people in For-
'Z1t"lt m i,and,ria- She doei not want then, to go

'hen tbey leave Japaii, to go where they can aid Japan's efforts and
