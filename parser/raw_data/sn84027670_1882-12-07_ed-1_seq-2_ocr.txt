issue with the Itcpuhlic-ins of Ohio
was to compel the liquor sellers to
help pay the taxes, and prevent thctn
from violating the Sabbnth. He
thinks the main issues to be, are the
tariff and Internal revenue questions.
One would suppose that the Demo
crats had elected members of Congress
enough, at the recent election, to sat
isfy any party. But It is not satis
fled. The Democrats are now going
to engage In the wholesale business
of contesting the elections of the few
Republicans who were chosen. They
rely upon the strong majority of their
party In the Route for theaccomplish
ruentof their nefarious schemes. In
tbe Judgement of the next House of
Representatives, It will no doubt be
considered a crime to bea Republican.
The Democratic party no sooner se
cures public confidence than It beglut
straightway to abue It. Its majority
will disappear as quickly as it ap
peared. Has any one observed the fact that
the slaughter of Republican candi
dates for County Attorney at the late
election, was well ulgh universal?
If the Republicans nominated a man
pledged to make unceasing war on
whiskey, he was, in nearly every In
stance, defeated by the antl-prohlbi-lion;
while, on the other band, if they
nominated a candidate not so com
mltted. he was defeated by the pro;
hibitionists. In both cases, tbe re-,
suit was the same an anti-prohllii-tion
.County Attorney, generally a
Democrat, was elected. After the
first of January, therefore, five-sixths
of the County Attorneys of .Kansas

The President's message hastnade
Its appearance. He speaks positively
upon all questions and Issaes which
are agitating tbe American people.
The following words show his posi
tion on tbe revenue question:
Upon tbe showing of our financial
condition, at tbe close of the last fis
cal year. I felt Justified In recommend
lar. that Conicresa abolish Internal
revenue taxes, except those upon to
baccos, in its various forms, and upon
distilled spirits and fermented liquors;
and except, also, tbe special tax upon
tbe manufacturers and dealers In such
articles. I venture now to suggest
tbat unless It shall be ascertained
that the nrobable exoenditures of the
government for tbe coming year have
tieen underestimated, all Internal
taxes, save those which relate to dis
tilled spirits, can be prudently abro
gated. Such a course. If accompa
nied by a simplification of tbe ma
chinery or collection, which would
then be easy of accomplishment.
might be reasonably expected to re
sult lu diminishing tbe cost of such
collection at least two and a half
millions of dollars, and in the re
tirement from office of from fifteen
hundred to two thousand persons.
He gives goo. I reasons why so
swieplng a mea-tire n the total
abolition of internal taxes, would for
the present Ik? an unwise step. He
declares in favor of the reduction of
letter postage. Referring to the star
route Irregularities, he "ays:
In my me-otage of December last, I
referred to pending criminal proceed
ings growing out of alleged frauds lu
what is known as the star-routo ser
vice of tbe pcxtoillce department, and
advised you that I liad enjoined upon
tbe attorney-general and associate
counsel, tu utioui the Interests of the
government were intrusted, tha u:
most vigor of the law ptn-ons who
might be found cbargable with those
offeose. A trial of one of these'oase
has since occurred. It occupied for
many weeks tbe attention of tbe Su
preme Court of this district and waa
conducted with great seal ami ability.
It resulted in a disagreement of the
Jury, but the cause has been again
placed upon the calendar and will
shortly be re-tried. If any guilty
persons shall finally escape punish
ment for their offenses it will not be
for the lack of diligent and earnest
efforts on the part of the prosecution.
President Arthur Is the first of our
chief executives to refer In a message
to the wafting of our American forests.
We hope these words will have the
effect of urging Congress to pass some
protective measures. This Is the Prs
ideut's language:
The condition of the forests of the
country, ami the wasteful manner in
which their destruction is takine
place give cause for serious apprelieu-I
sum mai lucir acuou in protecting
the earth's surface, In moderating the
extremes of climate, and In creating
and sustaining the flow of springs and
streams is uot well understood, and
their importance In relation to the
growth and prosperity of the country
cannot be safely disregarded. Forests
are fast disappearing before disastrous
fires and the legitimate requirements
of our increasing population, and their
total extinction cannot be long de
luded unless better methods than now
prevail shall be adopted for their pro
tection and cultivation.
The attention of Congress Is Invited
to the necessity of additional legisla
tion to secure the preservation of the
valuable forests still remaining on the
public dumalnespeclally in the ex
treme western states and territories,
where the necessity for their preser
vation is greater than In less moun
tainous' regions, and where tbe pre
vailing dangers of the climate renders
their restoration, If they are once de
stroyed, well nigh impossible.
The President hopes for adequate
legislation in the intorest of the pub
lic service, and speaks of political
assessments In the following words:
hi July last I authorised n publio
aiinoiinct-nieiit that the employes of
the government should regard them
selves as at liberty to exercise their
jiU-ssiiro in making wr refusing to
maku political contributions, and that
their action in that regard would lu
no manner affect their olllelsl status
In this announcement I acted upon
the view which I had always man
tallied, and still mantain, that a pub
lie nlllcer should be as absolutely free
as any other citizen to give or with
hold a contribution for the aid of the
political party ol ills choice It has,
however, been urged, and doubtless
not without fouudation lu fact, that
by solicitation of subscriptions, and
by other modes, such contributions
have at times ! n obtained from per
sons whose only motive for giving ha
been fear of wlfai might befall them if
they refuse to give It. Without say
Ink that these contributions are not
voluntary, in mv Judxmeul their col
lection OiO'iM Im- prohibited by law
A bill which will effectually suppre
them will reeelv-H my cordial ap
proval Tug CU.ilUitiuu orilitintlc Billis
iR'fore Congress a-t usu.il. if the old
soldier waiiU to know how much he is
entiled to receive under this bill. It Is
only necessary for him to multiply tin
number of months he was In service
by eight and one-third dollars and
subtract the amount of United States
bounty which he actually reclved.
The remainder will lie the amount due
hint. Three months men will be en
titled to $26, nine months men to $75,
and one year men to $100. This bill
Is one of tbe most Jut measures before
Congress. There are a large number
of'soldlers that have le.-eived no
bounties who woulJ be well provlled
forundertblsblll. But Unquestionable
whether tbe passage of tbe bill can be
effected so long as a Democratic Con
gress "rules the roojt" Yet the Deru
ocrats, Ifthey were wise (which they
ire not and never will be),could make
much capital for themselves by
becoming the champions of the bill
It would be very diflcult, no doubt, to
make the Southern wing of the Demo
cratic Congress subscribe very heartily
to a Union Soldier Bounty Bill. The
Johnuies would have to be well pea
stoned first.
If the Legislators will really do
something more than talk When they
assemble at the Abilene meeting, It
will be an exception to tbe general
rule in such assemblies. But we real
ly believe that the members nieau to
ocf this time. The committee have
heard from 86 members, and all ex
cept five, heartily endorse tbe move
ment. If the endorsing eighty-six
"stick to tbeipledge," we may surely
expect the relief we seek this winter.

ment In company with Johnstban Tink

Council Grove and spent Thanksgiv
ing In that City, in the valley of Neo
sho We found by personal inspection
that work on the grade for the first
ten miles west of Council Grove, on
the line of the Sallna and Western R.
It., was no idle fiction, as there were
employed by tbe contractors, Ken
nedy aud Stone, 120 teams and about
150 men on the grade, aud about 75
men aud teams on tbe stone culvert
work. The King Bridge company
also bad a gang of men setting up
derricks nud pile driver preparatory
to building tlie railroad bridge across
the Neosho river. They had eight
car loads of bridge timber on hand
rcadv for Immediate use, and more mi
the road. By the 12th of this month
tlie first fen miles of the road will be
ready for the ties ami iron. Tlie con
tractors say that if tlie bonds lu Dick
inson and Saline counties are revnted
they will sublet tlie whole grading
from that place to Sallna. as soon us
Kssihle, as Mr. Patterson bas money
to build tbe whole line at once.
Our party were courteously treated
by the Council Grove people, and to
Messrs. ShamleflVr aud Arnold, local
directors of the It. R-.we are specially
obliged for for favors shown us.
We came back to Gypsum Creek on
the proposed line of the road from
Council Grove to Saltna, and were
surprised to find it so well settled aud
prosperous. Farmers residing on the
tine or our proposed road, who are as
far as we were- able to learn willing
and ready to revote the subsidies that
had expired They alto informed our
party tbat they were tired of having
to haul their grain from twenty to
thirty miles to market, and as the best
market was at Council Grove or on
tbe M. K. & T. R. R. stations, netting
them rrom 10 to 12 eta per bushel more
than from tbe Santa Fe or U. P. R. R.
stations each side of them, they were
willing to revote the aid to hocuro this
one object, if nothing more. M.

Political excitement having sub
