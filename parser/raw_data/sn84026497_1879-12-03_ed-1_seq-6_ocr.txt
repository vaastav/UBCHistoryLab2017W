usually well.
Tracy, the murder of his cousin

Our venerable Postmaster is kept
busy these days trying to keep even
with the "wart-bog" on postage.
Mr. M. Ulrich, representing Lud
wig Mayer, of Oil City, stopped in
town a few hours last Wednesday.
Hunters will take notice that but
a dozen days yet remain of tho deer
season, and govern themselves accord
ingly. The young folks, and some not so
young as they used to be, had a very
pleasant party at Partridge's Hall
Thanksgiving evening.
, Thanksgiving passed off in this
place without a "squawk" from either
chicken or turkey that wo could learn.
While some had fowl ethers were
fowl less, and all gave thanks accord
ingly. Leander Berlin, a young man of
Whig Hill, cut his left foot quite se
verely oVe day last week, while scoring
timber. Our informant states that all
of the toes were nearly eevered from
the foot.
Mr. Einstein returned last Satur
day, having gathered together nearly
all of his "stove-up" lumber and run
it to Pittsburgh. His loss was uot as
great as at first reported. Go and ask
Morris "vat ho Sinks of the lumber
bissness."

discharged from further custody on a
writ of habeas corjms issued by Associ
ate Judge Dale.
Mrs. II. Shoemaker, accompanied
bv her three children and Miss Nora
Huliugs departed for Atchison, Kan
sas, on Monday. Mr. Shoemaker has
been at that place for several mouths,
and we understand has been doing
well. We wish them all happiness
and prosperity.
Jake Stitzinger, of the Mealy Set
dement, claims to have beaten our
deer Kory, ot last. week, lie and a
companion wero out hunting, when
two very nice deer came within ten
feet of them. They both shot but
neither one took effect. That beats
it, sure.
Derickson & Co.'s new mill at
Hunter's Station steamed up yesterday
morning. The boys in the woods have
a large number of bolts ahead aud
Mill probably keep this mill stocked
all winter. Mr. II. E. Moody has a
job of cutting bolts, which be is rush
ing through lively with tho help of
several men.
Mrs. Dean, of Whig Hill, widow
of the lato Geo. W. Dean, culled upon
us yesterday, and -settled her sub
scription. She said it was one of Mr
Dean's last requests that the Repub
lican be paid up promptly, and that
that ft as her mission to our saucum
May the live and keep her health
many years to enjoy reading it.
Several parties of hunters from the
big woods passed through town last
week on their way home, generally
6peaking, empty-handed. One party
had with it a horn, aud while passing
through the Btreets discoursed some
very nice strains. They were pre
pared to "blow their own horn," and
hud to do it, too.
Quito a number of deer passed in
their checks last week. Ad. Shriver
killed one; Geo. and Theo. Huddle
son, three in one day ; Daniel Black
three two at one shot, tome more
wero killed, hut we could not learn
who the lucky chaps were who slew
them. All these, except Blacks, were
killed within a radius of five or six
tnilcs of Tionesta.
Mr. Diflgman received his new
3-barrol breech-loading Baker gun
ycBterday. It has two shot barrels,
with rifle barrel underneath, the
latter of which shoots the ordinary
Winchester cartridge ; has a very
handsome walnut- pistol grip stock,
and altogether is the finest. g" n
town, and Mr. D. feels as happy over
it as a boy with a pair of new red-top
boots. Hope he'll initiate it on a ven
ison and not forget the printers.
Mrs. White, well known to our
older class of citizens as the widow of
the late Judge Wm. White, a former
citizen of this county, who removed to
Kansas several years ago, is at present
visiting her relatives and old acquaint
ances in this neighborhood. She is
said to be still hale and hearty, with
very little change In her appearance.
Mrs. White is a sister of Mrs. C. F.
Gillespie and Mrs. A. B. Root, and of
Adam and Henry Zuendel, all old resi
dents of our county.
President Hayes' third annual
message to Congress, which met on
Monday, will be found in Supplement
form in to-days paper. We have
been at a good deal of expense in giv
ing this interesting document to our
readers in this form, both as to prid
ing and additional postage, and we
hope they will appreciate our efforts
in this particular. It is an instrument
which every voter and tax payer
should read, as therein are laid down
the views of the President regarding
the administration of National affairs,
and there is no point of general or
particular interest to the government
but what is touched upon. It might
bo well to further remark that it is no
quack medicine circular.
Mr. N. S. Foreman met with
quite a severe and painful accident on
Friday last. He, in company with
Mr. J. S. Henderson, of East Hickory,
has a job of putting in logs near that
place, and while he was engaged ar
ranging some on the "skid way," his
leg was caught, and the outside bone
of his left leg was broken about three
inches above the nnklo. Ihe fracture
was reduced by Dr. Blaiue, and Mr.
Foreman was brought home on Satur
day evening. He received a wound
in the same leg in tho army, since
which time it has b,een stiff; lad it
not been for this he would probably
have heen able to escape tliU injury.
He is doing well, aud will be able to
be out in a couple of weeks.
The "Wait-Hog" insists that
because we have heretofore folded up
supplements in our paper, we shouldn't
find fault at him for doing likewise.
We wish to remark that there is a
vast difference in these cases: We
have frequently folded supplements in
our paper, but thoy were made up of
choice reading matter, and went in as
"Supp'eraents," which every publisher
has a right to do, provided he pays
the postage, and the postmasters books
will show that we have complied with
the law in every instance. We got no
return from them, but did it wholly
for the benefit of our readers. We
never enclosed a quack mediciue cir
cular in our paper for any purpose;
not even to defraud the government
out of postage, and until we do, we
shall continue to find fault with others
for doing so. In order to get the
benefit of this law, a supplement must
be part aud parcel of the paper, and
contain a certain amount of general
reading matter. But the bitterest and
most heart-rending wail is jvheie be
6ays we "try to injure his professional
reputation." S u f-f-e-r-i-n-g Invalids!
Think of it ! Trying to injure v'oburu's
professional reputation ! Why you
nearly take our breath away! Now,
we have frequently heard of persons
trying to spoil rotten egg9, but this is
the first instance, to our knowledge, of
anybody trying to injure Coburn's
professional reputation. Really;
didn't you intend that for a joke f

From tho Derrick's remarks on the
President's Message, we cull the fol
lowing: "The message of president
Hayes, submitted to Congress yester
day and laid before our readers hours
before those bodies received it, is by
far the ablest effort of his pen. As
usual, it is verbose and drawn out to
an unnecessary length, but each topic
is carefully analyzed and treated with
care. The opening portion is devoted o
finance, which subject is exhaustively
elaborated but does uot present any
new features, being but a repetition of
the report of the secretary of the
treasury. Llr. Hayes handles the
Mormons without gloves, and recom
mends heroic treatment in their case
by withdrawing their rights of citizen
ship unless they abandon polygamy.
On Indian affairs the president
comes out strongly and with some
very good suggestions. He takes hold
to that difficult subject without fear.
On the whole, it is a fiua paper but
would bo vastly improved by boiling
down."

Our Next Instituie.
The next session of the Forest
County Teachers' Institute will assem
ble in Tionesta, - Dec. 15, 1879, and
will remain in session until the Friday
following.
The prospects are very favorable
for a good attcudauce and interesting
and instructive exercises.
Supt. Geo. R. Dixon of Elk county,
who was with us last year, aud who
gave such general satisfaction, has, at
the solicitation of a number of teachers,
been re-engaged, and will give in
etruction at each session on such sub
jects as may be deemed advisable, or
as the teachers may desire.
Prof. A. G. Langley, of the Edia
boro Normal School, will be with us
the first part of the week ; and Supt.
A. J. Davis, of Clarion Co., will be
present from Wednesday to the close
of the Institute. We have the condi
tional promise of other prominent ed
ucators to be present, and lroru
present indications we think our ap
proaching Institute will be ono of uue-
qualed interest and profit. We there
fore earnestly invite and solicit the '
attendance of every teacher in the
County ; also of all who expect to
teach next year. We cordially invite
all friends of education throughout the
County to be .present and unite with
us in making this the most successful

DIED.
ADAMSs. In Bradford. Pa., Do?. 1st,
1S79, at 10 o'clock, P. M. of typhoid fever,
Harlem D. Adams, aged 19 years and 11
days.
The above news will be sadly re
ceived by the many friends of the
young man, particular among his
younger associates, with whom he has
always been a great favorite. , Some
thing over a year ago he accepted a
position as book-keeper iu the estab
lishment of Bovard & Sefang, promi
nent dealers iu oil well supplies, of
Bradford, since which time he had
been stopping there. About six weeks
ago he came home with what he sup
posed to be no more than a severe bil
ious attack, and remained a few days,
but being anxious to return to his
post he returned not yet fully recov
ered. He nas taken worse and obliged
to take his bed, from which time on
he continued to fail, although at times
he seemed to improve. Harlem was
a bright young man of more than ordi
nary promise, and would uo doubt
have made his mark in the world had
be been spared. His taking od'justat
the approach of manhood is deeply
mourned by all our citizens, whose
sincere sympathies go out to the
stricken parents and relatives in tbeir
sad bereavement.
His remains were brought home on
the 8:29 traiu last night, and the
funeral will take place this afternoon
&l three o'clock.
