Mrs. Bradley Transferred to House of
Detention.
PATIENT'S DAUGHTEB AEEIYES
Police Making Investigation With
View of. Obtaining All Possible
Evidence?-Legal Action.
The indications are, according to
the surgeons at the Emergency
Hospital, that former Senator Ar
i r> _i a. 1 i c* a. i i
uiur Drown, snui last oaiuruay uy
Mrs. Annie Bradley, will recover.
The defendant is at the house of detention
in a nervous condition. A
daughter of the patient has arrived
here from Columbus, Ohio, and was
at his bedside today. Letters
taken from Mrs. Bradley are expected
to figure prominently in the
case.
"Senator Brown has more than an even
ch&nre to recover," Dr. William P. Carr
stated at the Emergency Hospital about
noon touay. i wouia not use 10 say mm
1)0 Is entirely out of danger, but he has certainly
a good chance to recover."
Dr. Chasfes E. White, superintendent of
the hospital, who Is also one of the attending
surgeons, was present and he coincided
with the views of Dr. Carr.
Mrs. Annie M. Bradley, who shot the exsenator,
is beiijg cared for at the house of
detention today. The strain of being per
mltted to see and converse with scores of
persons all Saturday night and part of yesterday,
it is stated, came near causing a
nervous breakdown. Bhe was able to take
a little nourishment yesterday, and this
morning seemed to enjoy breakfast. The
prisoner feared the patient would die and
that. It is believed, caused nervousness on
her part. When Bhe was told by Dr. I* H.
Taylor, resident physician of the George
Washington Unlrersity Hospital, today that
there had been a decided change for the
better In the condition of the wounded man
there occurred a noted Improvement in her
condition.
Sa vs She Teela Relieved.
"I feel relieved." sh? remarked, after she
heard the encouraging news.
Dr. Taylor prescribed .or the prisoner to
quiet her nerves and produce sleep. Shortly
fh? nhvatatfl-n d^nertMl rHa mild sh?
did not care to see callers other than her
counsel and Senator Sutherland and soon
fell asleeip. Orders had been given earlier
In the day that no callers be admitted.
The order was given by MaJ. Sylvester, It
?u stated, because he had been requested
to do so by counsel (or the prisoner.
Now that the police are reasonably, satls ed
that Mr. Brown will recover they are
continuing their investigation with the view
of obtaining all the evidence possible to
present to the grand.Jury. The authorities
seem to be convinced that the letters ad
tfre&aed to the ex-senator, found In the
Cjaesslon of Mrs. Bradley, trill play an
portant part In the case. It was suggested
yt-sterday that the woman must
have been in the room of the ex-senator
la the Raleigh Hotel for a much longer
time than she stated. She had letters In
her possession that had been mailed to Mr.
Brown only about three days before the
booting occurred, and as she had been in
the city only since Saturday morning it
was suggested she must have obtained them
to me room.
Possession of Letters.
According to the police. Mrs. Bradley did
Dot have time to obtain possession of the
letters after the shooting, and her statement
of the circumstances under which
the wound was Inflicted, It was believed,
aust have been incorrect. Mr. Brown's
Account, given at the hospital, contradicted
Mrs. Bradley's version of the shooting.
Mrs Bradlev said that when she went to
the room and knocked on the door she was
admitted by Mr. Brown, and that she was
Is there only a short time?she could not

The wounded man says that he was not In
the room when the woman arrived there.
"She was In there when I returned to the
room." he Btates. "and she was looking
through my papers when I entered."
The explanation is the Brat as to bow
Mrs Bradley obtained possession of the letters.
some of which were signed "Annie."
Il Is stated that the writer of the letters Is
Mrs. Annie Adams, mother of Maud
Adams. The latter, It is stated, is In New
York, and th? further statement is made
that the former senator haW an engagement
In New York to see her after the conclusion
of his argument before the SuDreme
Court of the United States.
Mix. Bradley makes the statement that
mbf learned of the engagenffcnt In question
and that was why she came here. In addition
to the letters she obtained from the
room at the Raleigh Saturday the oolloe
found several letters addressed to Brown
la the trunk of the Drlsoner when it waa
arched at the first precinct atation yesterday.
Waa Greatly Surprised.
Former Senator Brown says that when
h* found the woman in his room at the
fcote! Saturday afternoon he was greatly
srprised.
"She demanded that I marry her imme
Olately," l?> added, "and said she would
ki!! me if 1 did not do so."
Tie patient continued that he thought
be waH merely joking, and that If he had
U(|?'i'ted she was going to shoot htm he
would have prevented the occurrence. It
la (aid that only once since he was shot
bai the patient had any idea that he would

Mr* Bradley wan opposed to discussing the
qmsiIoii of letiera. or how she happened to
g*< possession of them. Reference to them
Md*- her appear more nervous than at
?thrr times, and she expressed the hope
that nothing would be aatd about them or
IMr contents. Upon the floor of the room
to which the shooting occurred were found
craps of torn letters, and the police think
?J?e> were torn by Mrs. Bradley. Mrs. |

Assertions by Defendant.
rveral years mo. Mrs. Bradley Mates,
tn. Ada ins was at Salt Lake, and while
mtu wax there the former senator figured
la an exciting episode. Mrs. Bradley says
he knew later that he corresponded with
Mn. Adams, and she came bare after she

Interested In Patient's Condition.
i
Ever since she reached the police station
Saturday afternoon Mrs. Bradley has bean ]
deeply Interested in the condition of the
patient.
*'I hope he will get well," ahe has stated
a number of Use*. "I lore the ground he j
walks on."
After she was taken to the House of Detentlon,
and when she thought the wounded
man was likely to die, Mrs. Bradley remarked:
"If I had known he was so badly
wounded I would have shot myself."
It was about 2 o'clock Sunday morning
when Attorney Leckle first called to see
the prisoner and Informed her that he had
been retained to defend her. He reached
the station after the woman had been conversing
with reporters and others for nearly
twelve hours and he found her nervous
and tired. Mrs. Bradley made no complaint
about the number of callers she had
reoeiveu, nowever. una aiier ner counsel
left the station she was still willing to receive
visitors, the company making the
nlgrht seein shorter. Her counsel yesterday
morning requested that nobody except a
few personal friends be permitted to see
her. A number of persons called upon the
police today and expressed a desire to see

Efforts to Secure Statement.
Capt. Williams of the first precinct made
two efforts to secure a statement from Mrs.
Bradley and have her sign it, but she refused
The captain advised her of her
rights in the matter, and she said she preferred
not to give any written statement.
Her second refusal was made yesterday a
short time before _she was taken to the
house of detention.
It was stated at the hospital today that
a number of persons had called there to
Inquire about the condition of the wounded
man, some of the curious ones thinking
they might get a look at him.
Because of the Improvement shown in the
condition of the patient it has not been
necessary for the United States attorney to
take his statement of the circumstances of.
the shooting.
When it was reported Saturday night
that the patient wbuld probably die Inspector
Boardman communicated with tba
United States attorney, and made arrangements
to have one of his assistants on
hand the moment a change for the worse
should be noted. Such a contingency aid
not arise, however.
Received Very Few Callers.
Mrs. Bradley today received very few
callers, as a result of action of her counsel.
The defendant, however, was willing
to disregard the advice of her attorneys
respecting visitors, but only those who were
bar near friends were admitted. The secretary
to Senator Sutherland, Mr. Hanson,
called yesterday and saw her, it being the
first time he had seen her In four years.
A Salvation Army worker also called yea

however, and seat in a message of
sympathy.
During her conversations today Mrs. Bradley
did not enter Into any lengthy discussion
of the shooting. She continues to Insist
that she was justified in shooting Mr.
Brown, although she could not satisfy herself
that she had done Just the proper thing.
A number of times she expressed the hope
that the wounded man would recover and
she also referred to the letters that had

Adams. Mrs. Bradley told of repeated promises
of marriage made by Brown and of
the efforts she had made to change her
method of living.
"Upon one occasion," she stated. "I had
made arrangements to reside with the family
of a Unitarian minister in Denver, hoping
I would thereby be able to hide myself,
and another time I was to go to Chicago,
but each time Brown said something about
my deserting him, so I didn't go."
It was because Mr. Brown. complained
about her leaving him, Mrs. Bradley assert-'
ed, that she remained in Salt City.
She also stated today that she expected
Mrs. Adams would come oh "from New
York, and she expressed the belief that Mrs.
Adams would call at the house of detention
to see her.
Condition This Afternoon.
It was stated at the Emergency Hospital
at a late hour this afternoon that there
had been no change in the condition of
the patient since morning. At the house
of detention It was learned that there had
been no further need of the services of a
physician since morning, when Dr. Taylor
called and gave Mrs. Bradley medicine to
quiet her nerves and induce sleep.
Capt. Williams this afternoon visited police
headquarters and turned over to Inspector
Boardman all the letters he had
obtained from Mrs. Bradley and her trunk.
They are the letters referred to In the foregoing,
and were addressed to Mr. Brown.
.Capt. Williams told a Star reporter that
he had Intended sending Mrs. Bradley to
the Police Court this morning and have
her committed to jail, but as he thought
the natient mleht die within a dav or two
he changed lils mind.
It was the Idea of Capt. Williams this afternoon
to have Mrs. Bradley taken to court
tomorrow morning and charged with assault
with Intent to kill. Attorney Cox. of
the firm of Leckle, Fulton & Cox, stated
this afternoon that he knew of no method
of procedure having been determined on
by his associates, who are handling the case
at present. He was unable to say If application
will be made tomorrow for the release
of Mrs. Bradley on bond. Nothing has
yet been determined upon the matter of
what line of defense will be pursued, but
the police think tht defense will set up a
plea of emotional Insanity.
Women and Conviviality.
"Women and conviviality," friends of the
wounded man say, "were the means of hie
undoing."
The shooting has been the means of
bringing to light several episodes in the
life of the man who once represented hie
state in the United States Senate. His two
marriages and troubles with women to
whom he wag not married seem to have
man; rAviLiug cuayicrD in niS Hie.
His first wife, as stated In The Sunday Star,
he met and married at Kalamazoo. Mloh.
She Is still living, her home being in Columbus.
Ohio.
"We have suffered enough because of
him," she Is quoted as having stated when
informed of the shooting.
It is said that Brown was introduced to
Mrs. Bradley by his second wife, the introduction
taking place while the parties
were at the St. Louis convention. Since the
death of the second Mrs. Brown, about a
year ago, It is declared, trouble has been
experienced by the couple because of the
refusal on the part of the man to make
good his alleged promise of marrlage.

former Senator Arthur Brown no specific
charge wu Hied against Aunte Bradley in
tba Police Court today, and she in at the

When a Star reoorUr called at the Bbbltt
House- today Min Brown at first begged
to be excused from an Interview, but ah*
subsequently stated her desire to answer
aa allegation contained in one of the dispatches
from Salt Lake City to the effect
that her mother, shortly before separation
from Senator Brown, had threatened his
life and had drawn a revolver on him.
"That is absolutely not true," Miss
Brown said, "for my mother is not that
kind of a woman. She never made an attempt
on my father's life nor did she make
such a threat. Neither is ahe teaching
school, as hu been Intimated in some of
the dispatches, but is living quietly at
h*me with me in Columbus. My mpther

most of the time since then in Ohl<v"
Declined to Discuss Shooting.
About Mrs. Bradley, Miss Brown said
he knew nothing, and she declined to discuss
the shooting or any of the events leading
up te It.
From an Intimate friend of former Senator
Brown It was learned today that the
latter came here about five weeks ago to
prepare for the presentation of one or mora
cases before the Supreme Court.
"He told me that be would have to return
to Utah before the cases came up,
and I presume he did so, because I did not
see him again until a few days ago at the
Raleigh. Mrs. Bradley baa long been kneedeep
In politics In Utah, and she Is, or was
until recently, secretary of the republican
state central committee. When "Brown left
Rait T.nice the last time. I am informed
that Mrs. Bradley told him that she wanted
to go away from the city for good, and
Brown gave money to his secretary for her,
with the understanding that she would go
to San Francisco. She did buy a ticket for
the California city, and her trunks were
put on the train and checked through, but
she must have suddenly changed her mind
and sold the ticket, and, switching her baggage,
followed Brown to Washington."
What Atorney Says.
Attorney L>eckie, after a conference with
his client at the house of detention, to
day, declared tnat a report mat ne wuum
proceed upon th? theory that Mrs. Bradley
Is mentally Irresponsible Is not true.
"Mrs. Bradley was emotional and in a
highly nervous state during our interview,"
Mr. Leckie said, "and it Is Impossible for
me to get at the full statement of facta. I
do not believe that Mrs. Bradley will be
taken into Police Court until it is fully
known what the outcome of Senator
Brown's condition may be. We have not
decided what her plea shall be, and it will
be impossible to do so until we know all

GUARANTY BONDS.
Corporation Counsel Disapproves
Them in Certain Cases.
In an opinion submitted to the commissioner*
this morning, Corporation Counsel
Thomas holds that the District will not
be sufficiently protected In accepting an
annual guaranty bond from prospective
bidders for District contraot work In the
olace of cash and certified checks, as has
been the custom in the past. The commissioners
were recently impressed by a number
ol prominent contractors who frequently
bid for District work that it would
be more satisfactory for them to furnish
a guaranty bond instead of tile cash and
certified checks, and it was in view of this
that the commissioners aked the corpora
tion counsel for his optonlon regarding the
legality In tbe matter.
When the question of a guaranty bond
was first placed before commissioners
they were of the opinion Tat It would aet
as a goo a suDsinuaon, out a rew flays later
the Title Guaranty and Surety Company
suggested to them that prospective bidder*
be allowed to submit during the rear an
annual guaranty bond covering any or all
proposal* submitted by the applicant, as Is

OVER SIXTEEN MUXION PUPILS, tl
cl
Report of tlie Commissioner of Edu- ?
cation. s<
Elmer Ellsworth Brown, United States
commissioner of education. In his annual e,
report to the Secretary of the Interior, d
says that during the year 190& 20.3 par cent
?t the total'^population of the'United States M
was In the' common schools, or, in other :r
words, 10,400,007 pupil*. __ J
"It the estimates of totals population are tl
correct," says Commissioner Brown, "this is
percentage has been slightly declining
within the past Ave years. It should be 91
noted that even the slight apparent decrease
of the past five years relates only to
the ratio of school enrollment to total dod
ulation. The Actual enrollment in the n,
schools has steadily advanced. In 1870 it u:
was 6.8H.522. In 1900 It had reached 15,503,110,
and there has been a substantial
increase each year since then, up to the
total for 191.5. as given above." bo
The average daily attendance, too, and pi
the percentage of total number enrolled th
who are In average daily attendance have
both continued to advance. The average
number of days attended by each pupil en- P(
rolled was 104.7. The average length of sh
the school term was 150.3 days. Thia is the pc
first time that this item has passed the 150 n(
mark, the longest average term previously
reported having been that of the year 84
IPO4, which Was 146.7. el
The entire value of school property increased
from $342,531,791 in 1890 to $730.- S'
>.14,300 in 1906. w
The rapid increase in the number of stu- u|
dents receiving secondary Instruction is tli
also maintained, the increase of such stu- a
dents in public institutions being still tax
in excess of the increase for the same year re
In private Institutions. Seventy-eight per cc
cent of the entire number of secondary tv
students were enrolled In public high ie
schools, an Increase over the year 1904 of i,
a. fraction above 1 mr cent. Secondarv
tudents now number a little more than 1 rz
per cent of the entire population. The sum- r,
ber of student* studying Latin In public
high schools increased in the year from
323,028 to 341.348. The percentage of students
studying Latin to the whole number
enrolled shows a fractional decrease, but _
is still over one-half of that total, being **
50.21.
The number of students studying Greek
in public high schools declined from 11,158
in 1904 to 10,002 In 1905. The value of the S?
school property of the high schools of the pi
United States showed an increase in the n(
same year of nearly $16,000,000, reaching .
the sum of $174,000,000. That of private at
schnnla of the a,am ft erade advanced from VC
about $70,000,000 to about $72,000,000. wi
The usual Increase in the number of both ot
men and women In universities and other
Institutions of higher education was maintalned.
The value of property owned by In
the universities, colleges and technological at
schools of the country was reported at
$514,840,412, an Increase of nearly $50,- P!
000.000. r*
A great advance is noted in the number

The Optimist. ci
From the Prorldence Tribnne. le,
Addressing himself to a body of so-called la
educators assembled last week in Boston, a st
social philosopher who has made a name for ...
himself described an optimist as "a man
who expects to find two heads on every y!
penny." The disposition to say the smart 1,
thing at the expense of the trutb or regardiess
of truth U not new, but of late it
seems to be becoming more and more a
habit with people of education who presume
to enlighten and instruct others. The
optimist may be thoroughly impractical, but J
he is not necessarily so; certainly, he does nu
not always expect to find two heads on th
every penny, even In the figurative sense. fa
As a rule, he Is rather indifferent to pen*
niM a.r\A details of All kinds. Hat. for thd I
most part, he Is a useful member of so- bo
ciety and whether, measured by average "V
standards, he Is a success or a failure, the
Influence he wields Is, on the whole, an Influence
for good and not to bo despised.

THE CHILD LABOR QUESTION
jrresiaent tukm With Persons Prominently
Identified With Variotn
Phases of This Subject.
Senator McCumber is one of the chief
opponents of Judge Wlckersham. the Alaska
Jurist, whose nomination has been before
the Senate at eiverjr session for several
years and who has received seven recess
appointments and nominations br the
President. When the Senate adjourned last
June without action on this case Senator
tticv umDer went to the President and asked
that he order a reinvestigation of the Wickersham
case, and District Attorney Hoyt
of Nome was appointed to go over to Judge
Wickersham's district and receive testimony
in regard to the Judge's official and
personal conduct Mr. McCumber said he
did not discuss the Wickersham case with
the President today for the reason that the
report of Mr. Hoyt has not yet been received.
Judge Wickersham was appointed from
T&roma, Wash., In 1900. and after serving
four years was nominated for a second
term. Charges of various sorts were niefl
atailist him hi* friends rlalmin* that thosn
were Inspired chiefly by enmities made by v
the Judge when he was holding court outside
his own district, and that disappointed
litigants were the leading opponents of hJ
reappointment. Since lUOi Judge Wicker-'
sham's nomination has been sent In at
every session of the Senate, and that body
has failed to vote either for or against confirmation.
The President Is a strong supporter
of the judge, and has said that he
will continue to nominate him as long aa
the Senate falls to act.
