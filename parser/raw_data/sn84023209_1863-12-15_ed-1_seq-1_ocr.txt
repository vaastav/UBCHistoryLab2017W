It bss appeared impossible to make a valuable
summary ul this report, except such st would be
too extended for thu place, and hence 1 tontent
iniysclf by asking your careful attention to lbs re
port itself.
The duties devolving on the nuval branch of
the servine during the year, and throughout the
whole of tti i a tinlia ipy contest, have been dis
charged with fidelity and eminent nuccess. The
t-x'euwve blockade has been constantly increasing
in efficiency.
It the Navy has expanded, yet on io long a
line it has so far been impossible to entirely sup
press illicit trade. From the returns received at
ihe Navy Department, it appears that more than
one thousand Teasels have been captured 'nce
the blockade was instituted, and that the value
of prizes ulready sent in for adjucalion amouuts
to over thirteen millions of dollari.
The natal force of the United Sutes consists
at ti.is time of fiH!) esls completed and in the
course of completion and of these 75 are iron
clad, or armored steamers. The events ol the
war give an increased interest and importance to
the navy, which will probabiy extend beyood the
war itself.
The armored vessels completed and in servioe
or which are under contract and approaching
completion are believed to exceed in number,
those of any other Power but while these may
be relied upon for harbor defence and coast
service, others of greater strength and enpaoity
wiil be necessary lor cruising purpose and to
maintain our rightful position on the ocean.
T he change that has taken place in naval war
fare since the introduction nf steam as a motive
power for ships ot war demand, either a corres
ponding change iu some of our enstug navy
i nds, ur the tiljiisl, limit of new ones Iur the
ci nsiruction and necessary repairs of modern na
val vessels. Mo inconsiderable embarassment,
delay and public injury h te been experienced
Ifoin the want ol such Lioveruaient estibl.sh
uivrHS. The necessity of such a navy yard, so luiniehcU,
at some suitable plane upon the Atlautio sea
board, has, on repeated occasions, been brought
to tin; attention ol tyongress by the Navy Depart
rami, and is auaio uresented in the re nor t of
llie Secretary, which accompanies '.tin communica
lion.
i think it inv duty to Invite your special atten
lion to this subject, and alto to that ot establishing
a )ard and depul for nautical purposes upon one of
tne Wtsleru rivers. A naval force has been crea
ted on those interisr waters, and under many d ia
advantages, wit:, m little more lb in two years, ex
ceeduig in numbers the whole naval force of the
country at the commencement of the present ad
Diinistraiion.
.Sttt-iiClury nud important as have been the
performances of the heroic men of the navy at this
interesting period, they are icsreely more won
derlnl limn ihe success of our niechsuici and ar
tinans in the production of war Vessels which has
crea ed a new furm of naval power.
Our country has advitiiagei superior to any
"thtr nation iu our resources of iron and limber,
with inexhaustible quantities of fuel in the nume
diale vicinity of both, and all available and in close
proximity lo navigable waters. Without the ad
vantage of public works, the resources of the na
tion have been devel 'ped and its power displayed
in the construction of a navy of such magnitude,
which has, ul the very peritd of its creation, ren
dered signal service to the Union.
The increase of the number of seamen in the
public service from seven thousand fire huudred
u.ni iu llie spring of ISO 1 to about thir'y-lour
thousand at the picssnt lime, has beeu accom
plished without special legislation or extraordina
ry haunt;, s to pruinote that increase.
It has been found, however, that the operation
ol, the drall with the higls bounties paid fur army
recruits is beginning lo atl'tct seriously the naval
service, and will, if not carret tid. be likelv In im.
,,dLl tit tllieieccy by delachinir aeanieo from their
,r, per vocation and inducing Iheui to enter the
jrUiv. 1 therefore reanectiullv auwirnt that C.n.
gre.ss might aid both the Army and Naval servicet
by a dt finite provision on this subject, which would,
a', the same uiuo, be equitable to llie communities
nior- e-ptcialiy initresitd.
1 t'joHiieud tu your consideration tbe tugges
lions of the becrelary of the Navy in regard to
the poncy ol fostering and training seamen and
also the educaliuu ot otlicers aud engineers for
the l-iv1 service,
d ue Naval Academy is rendering signal service
iu preparing midshipmen fur the highly responsi
ble duties which in alter life I hey will be required
to periurm. In order .at the country should
nut be deprived of the prop r quota of educated
oiln't-rs, Iur winch legal provision bat been made
at the Naval School, the vacancies caused by the
neglect or oruosion to make nominations from tbe
Stales in insurrection have been tilled by the Seo
retary ol the Navy, f he school is now more full
and cou:ilie than at any former lieriod. and in
every respect entitled to the favorable conndera
lion ol i onirress
Hurnig ibe last fiscal year the financial condi
tion of the 1'ost I Hice Department bss been one
of increasing prosperity, aud 1 am gratified in be
ing able to state that the actual postal revenues
have nearly equalled the expenditure, the latter
iiiii.'uniinu lo ilt.dl l,20li,,Sl, and the former In
$ 11, ,.G;l,7S,J,5y, leaving adeticiency nf but $150,
H7,l!5.
In lStid, the year immediately preceding the
rebellion, the delicuncy amounted to fl5,05(t,7ll5
111, ll.e postal itceipls of that year being ('2,(i45,
7L"J,l!t less than those of 1803. Tl.e decrease
since lis. id in (he annual amount of transportation
Ins been only about 25 per cent., but the annual
expenditure on account of the aunie, has been re
duced li5 per ceut,
It is manifest, therefore, that the l'ost Oflice
Deparlment may become self-sustaining in a few
jears, even with the restoration of the whole ser
vice. T he international Conference of postal delegates
from the principal coun ries of Kurope and Amr
ici, which was called at the suggestion of the l'ost
amur General, met st l'aris on the eleventh of,
Mtiy last and concluded Its deliberations on the
eighth uf June.
t he piinciples established by the conference si
best adapted lo facilitate post intercourse between
nations, and as the basis of future postal eonven
lions, inauguiate a general system of uniform n
ternntioual charges at reduced rates of postage
anu cannot fail 10 produce ueueficial results.
lri ftr joulothe report of the Secretary of
the Interior, which is herewith laid before you,
;nr useful at d varied inlurmatinn in relation to
the public l.uds, lndiau allairs, Talents, l'ensions,
and other matters uf public coucein pertaining
to his Dep rtincht,
'' nnesste and Arkansas have been substan
tial1)' Cleared of insurgents and influential citixene
iu each. Owners ol .laves and advocates ol slav
ery at ihe beginning uf the rebellion, now dictate
openly I'm emancipation iu their respective Stale.
Of those Stutes not included In the emancipa
tion proclamation, Maryland and Missouri, neither
of which three 'ears ago would tolerate any re
straint upon the extension of slavery into new
territories, only dispute bo ss to the best mude
ol removing it within their own limits.
Tbe quantity of land disposed of during lbs
last and ursl quarter of the present fiscal year,
was 1), HH.OTJ acres, of which 101,1)1 1 seres were
suid fur cash.
One million four hundrtd and fifty-six thousand
live bindred and louiteen acres ware taken up un
der ihe homestead law, aud the residue disposed
ul under laws granting lands Iur mililury bounties,
foi railroad and other purposes. It anpesrs I list
ll.e sa'e ol public lai ds is Isrgely on lilt incre.se.
ll has long been a cherished opiuion of some of
uur wisest statesmen thsl tns people of the Unit
ed Slates bad a higher and more endearing inter
est in the esrly settlement sod substantial ciltivt
lion of the pul.lio lands, thso in the amount of di
rect revenue to be uerivsu Irom tns sal. or Hit u.
This opiuion bss bad a controlling influence in
shaping legislation upon lb. suhji-ct of our nation
al domain. I may cite as evidence of this, the lib
era! means adopted in refer., ic to solus! seltleis
tl.e grant lo lbs Slates of the overflowed lands
within their limits io ordsr to their being reclaimed
and rendered tit for cultivation ; and the grants to
railway companies of alternate sections of land up
on ihe contemplated lines of their roads, which
when coinpletotl will so largely multiply the facil
flies for reaching our distant possessions.
This policy has received its most signal and ben
elicenl illustrnt on m the recent enactment irrant
ing a homestead to actual settlers since the 1st
of January last.
The before mentioned quantity o,' T,4oli,5U
acres of land have been taken up under Its pro
visions. This fact and the amount of salss fur
nish gratifying evidencs of increasing settlements
upon the public hods, notwithstanding the great
struggle, in which the energies of the nation have
been engaged and which has required so large a
withdrawal uf our citizens from their accustomed
pursuits.
1 cordially concur iu the recommendation of
the Secretary of the Interior, suggesting a modi
fication of the set io favor of those engaged in the
military and naval service nf the United States. I
doubt not that Congress will cheerfully adopt such
measures aa will, without essentially changing the
general features of the system, secure to the great
est practicable extent its benefits to those who
have left their homes in tho defense of the coun
try in this crisis.
1 invite )our attention to the views of the Sec
retary as to the propriety of raising hy appropri
ate legislation a revenue from the mineral lands
of the United .States.
i he measures provided al your last session for
the removal of certain Indian tribes have been

When Congress assembled a yesr ago, the war
bad already lasted nearly twenty months, and
there had been many conflicts on both land and
mis with varying re.-ulia. The rebel, ion h d been
pushed back mtu reduced limits, yit the tone of
public opinion al home and abroad was nol satis
factory. Wi.b other signs, the popular elections
then just past, indicated uneasiness Among our
selves, while, amid much thai was cold snd men
acing the kindest words coming from Uurope
were uttered in accents of pity that we Were loo
blind lo surrender a hopeless cause.
Our commerce was suffering j-reatly by a few
armed vessels, built upon snd luriiiibed from for
eign shores, and were threatened with such addi
tions from the same quarters as would sweep our
trade trom tne sea and raise our blockade. V) e
had fai'ed to elicit from Kurojean Governments,
nj thing hopelul on this subject.
Tbe preliminsry emancipation proclsmstim is
sued in September was running its assigned peri
od lo the beginning ol the new year. A month
later the final proclamation came, mclu'linir the
announcement that colnr:d men of suitable condi
tion, w mid b received into the warseivice. ' The
policy of eniaucipition and of employing black
soldiers g.ve lo tb. future a new aspect, about
hub hope and tear c intended in uncertain con
A ct. According to our political system, as a
matter of civil admiuistration, the general govern
ment had no luwlul power to effect emancipation
in any Slate, and for a longtime il had been
hoped that Ibe rebellion could be suppressed with
out lesorling to it aa a military iiia-ure. It was
all ihe while deemrd possible tht the necessity
Iur it mignt come, anu mat II It should ihe crisis
of tbe contest would then be presented. It came.
and, as was anticipated, it was ft llowed b,
dark and doubtful da) a.
hleven months having now passed we are per
mitt, d tu take another review. Th. rebel bor
ders are pressed still further back, and b, tb.
complete opeuing ol the Mississippi tbe country
dominated by the rebellion is divided into distinct
parts, with no practicable communication between
them. Tennessee snd Arkansas have bvn sub
stantially cleared of insurgents' central, aud influ
ential citizens in each, owners or slaves snd sdvo
catts of slavery at the beginuing of the rebell
ion, now deolare openly for emancipition In their
respective States. Ol tbe Stales not included in
ihe eu.ancipaliou proclamation, Maryland snd
Mi.ssouri, neither ct which ttuee years sgo would
tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slave
ry into new territories, only dispute now aa to the
best mode of runioving il within their own lim
its.
Of those who were slaves al tht beginning of
the rsMlion full one hundred thousand are now
in the United Slates milita-y service, sbout one
hall of which number sctuall, beur arms in the
ranks, thus giving the double advantage ol taking
so much labor from the insurgent ouuse, aud sup
plying the places which otherwise most be filled
by so many white men. So far as tested it is dif
ficult to say they sr. not as good soldiers at an,.
No servile insuirecuon or tendency to oruelty has
marked the measures of emancipation end arm
ing th. blacks. These measures have been much
discus d in loreign countries, and contemporary
with such discussion th. ton. of public sentiment
there is much improved. At bom. tbe same
measures bav. been full, discussed, supported,
criticised and denounced, and the annual elections
following are highly encouraging to those wboet
official dut, it is lo bear the c mntr, through this
great trial. 'Thus we bavft lb. near reckoning.
Ih. crisis which tbreatued to divide the friends
of th Union is pist.
Looking now o (ht present and future and
wilh relerenc lu a resumption of tbs national au
thority within the Stales wherein Ibat authority
bas been suspended, 1 have thought Ml tl issue
a proelam ition, a copy of which is herewith trans
mitted. On txsminaliun of ibis proclamation il
will appear ,as is bclieved.lbat nothing it stumpt
ed beyond whst is justified b, tbe Constitution.
True, tht form of an oath is given, but no man It
coeroed to tatt iu Tht man is only promised a
pardon in oast bt voluntarily lakes tbt oath. Tht
constitution authorizes the executive to grant or
witthhuld tht pardon at bit own tbtolut. discrt
tioo, and tbit includes tht powor to grant on
terms, ss is fully established by judicial snd other
authorities, It is also provided that if, In any of
the States, named, a State government shall be in
the modo prescribed set up, such government
shall be recognized snd guaranteed b, the United
States, and that under it the Stat shall, on tht
constitutional conditions, be protected against in
vasion and domestic violence. Tht con.titutional
obligation of tbe United (Hates to guarantee to
every State In the Union t republican form of gov
ernment snd to protect the State in tb case sta
led, is explicit and full.
Hut why tender the benefits of this provision
only to a Stste government set up in this particu
lar way f This section ot the constitution contem
plates a case wherein tbe element witbin a State
favorable to republican government in the Union
may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile ele
ment external to or even wiihin th Stat, and
uch are precisely the cases with which we tr
now dealing. An attempt to guarantee and pro
tect a revived State governme-.t, constructed In
whole or in preponderating hart from tb very
element against whose hostility tod violence it is
to be protected, ii simply absurd. There must be
a test b, which to separate tr.e opposing Hsu en Is
io aa to Duild only from the sound, and that test
is a sufficiently liberal on which accepts st sound
whoever will make a sworn reBintation of his for
mer unsoundness I but if it he proper to require
as a test ot admission to the political body sn ottb
of allegiance to the Constitution of the United
Slates and to tbe Union under it, wb, alter tb
sws and proclamations in regard to Slavery f
These laws and proclamations were enacted and
put forth for tbe purpose ot aiding in the suppres
sion of the rebellion To give tliem their fullest
effect there had to be a pledge for their msinte
D iiice. In my judgment the, have aided snd will
further aid the cause for which ibe, were intend
ed. To now abandon them would not only be to
relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a
cruel snd astounding ore icb of faith.
I ma, add st this point tbat while I remain in
tr.y present position, 1 shall not attempt to lelract
or modify th emancipa'lon proclamation,' nor
sba'l I return to Slavery an, person who It fret
by the term! of that proclamation, or b, an, of
tho acts of Congress. For these and other res
ions, it Is thought best lhat the support of theia
measures ihall be Included in the oath, and it it
believed the execulivt ma, lawfully claim it n re-'
turn fur pardon and restoration of forfeited,
rights, which be has clear constitutional powe to
withhold altogether or grant upon the terms h
shall deem wisest for the publlo interest. It
should be observed also that this psrt of the oalh
is subject lo the modifying and abrogating power
of legislation and supreme judicial decision.
The proposed acquiescence of tbt national ex'
ecutrve in any reasonable temorar, slat ar
rangement for the freed people, is made wilh the
view of possibly modifying tht confusion and des
'itutlon which must at beat attend all classes b, a
total revolution of labor throughout whole
Slates. It it hoped tbat tht already deeply af
flie'rd people In those Slates may be somewhat
more ready to give up the cause of their affliction ,
if to Ibis extent this vital matter be left lo them-,
selves, while no power of the national executive
to prevent in sbuse It abridged b, the propoai-'
tion.
The suggestion in the proclamation as to main
taining ihe political frame work of ths Slates on
what is called reconstruction, is made in tbe hop
lhat It may do good without danger of barm, (t t
will save labor and avoid great confusioo. But
why any proclamation now upon tbit subject 7 ,
This question is beset wilh conflicting views tbat
ihe step might be delayed or tsken too soon. Io
some Slates the elements for resumption art
ready for action, but remain inactive apparent',
for want rf a rallying point or plan of action.'

ow cart tbey know but that ibe general govern
ment here will rncct their plan ? By the pro
clamation a plan it prcsmted, which may be ac
cepted by them at a rallying point, and which
tiny are assured in tdvai ce will not be rejected
here, , 'Ibis may bring them to act sooner than
they otherwise would. The objections to a pre
mature proclamation of a plan b, lha national
xrcutive, coosistt in the danger of committals io
points could be more safely left to future dev.l
opements. Care has been taken to to sliape tb announce
ment ss to avoid embarrassment from this souroe,
saying that in certa n terms certain classes will
he pardoned, with rights restored, ll is not said
that other classes or other lerms will never be in
cluded. Saying tbal reconstruction will b accept ,
ed If presented in a specified Way, il is Do' said lhat ,
they wiP never be accepted in an, otner way. (
The governments b, Stale ac'ion for emanciptioo
in several of the dtates not included io tht emio
clpatioo procltmstion, sre mailers of profbuod j
gruulation, and while I do not repeal iu detail ,t
what I have heretofore ao earnestly urged upon,
this subject, my genersl views and leelings remain
unchanged, snd I trust Congress will omit no
fair opportunity of aiding these importaut slept
to the great consummation! in ihe midst of olbtr
cam however important.
Wa must not lose tight of the fact that th war
power is still our malu reliance. To lhat power .
alone can we lea k for a time lo give oonfideuc to ,
people in the contested regions tbat the insurgent ,
H.wer will not again overrun them. Until lhat o
c iDtldence shall be established, Unit can ba dont
tnywhere for what is called reconstruction. Hence
our chiefest care must still be directed to the trm,
tnd navy, who have thus far born their harder
part to noblv tod to well, tad il ma, bt eaieed
