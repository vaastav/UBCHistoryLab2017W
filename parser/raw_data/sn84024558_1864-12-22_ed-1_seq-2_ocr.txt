THE CONDITIO* OF OCR COUNTRY.
Besides the noble stand taken by the
President in bis message to Congress, that
there would be no backward steps taken
i l on the question of slavery, there are other
significant facts disclosed, in this document,
i which are of no less value to the cause of
the country ; and one of these is, that there
is really no diminuation <>f strength, or, 110
sign of exhaustion on the part of the govern
ment. Inasmuch as we could only call the
reader's attention to this wonderful—for
such in truth it is—disclosure in our last
, issue, we propose now to refer more par
ticularly to it. That there should be 110
visible exhaustion in the country, as well
in resources generally, as of men, after
such a stupendous war as we have sus
tained during the last four eventful years,
is marvelous indeed ; and yet the election
returns show a gain of not less than 250,-
000 votes over the election returns of l8t0.
If there had not been a full vote four
years ago, it might account for the present
• increase : but if is patent to all. that that
election was more warmly contested, was
more acrimonious, and consequently, more
1 xciting than the one just passed. So that
with all the losses incident to the great
war, we have to-day mrk men than we had
when the war began. It seentshardly pos
sible, that the maturation of our young |
men. and the naturalization of foreign cit
izens, should account for this great increase, j
and yet it must be so. We thought we had
an idea of the rapid growth of our nation,
but this far surpasses any thing we dreamed :
of, and is beyond all measure thejnost hope
ful sign of our vast power, and sure tri-;
unmh. Taking into account, also, the fact, I
• i
that our other material war resources, are j
now more complete, and abundant, than at
any time before, it does appear that the na
tion is growing in strength as her energies
are called into requisition. Perhaps, in
nothing i this more manifest to the people
th. inselves. than in the unbounded prosper
ity f lite five states. Tlie enhanced value
•f products of every description has re
newed the hopes and consequent exertions
of the despondent, and begotten enterprise
* such a degree, that almost all are now
• ither out of debt, or in a fair way of be
c tiling so ; and thousands upon thousands,
who before the war seemed hopelessly in*
voiced, are now free with surplus iunds to ,
invest in government securities. A govern
ment is strong when her people are strong,
and weak when they are weak. When this i
war began, tlie government could not bur.
row money tit a high rate of interest, to
meet ordinary wants. Now she is receiv
ing all she needs for the extraordinary de
mands of this gigantic war. Before tlie
war the people, in a great measure, were
restless, and unproductive, and moving
from state to state, looking for remunera
tion for labor. Now this has come to every
man's door ; and as a sequence, thrift and
advancement is the order of the day. Here
tofore the wonderful progress of our nation
in all the elements of greatness, lias ever
been a matter of amazement to the reliect.
ing people of the old world ; and yet, with-,
in the last three years, we have more than
doubled in this respect, any six years of our
previous history.
THE WAR NEWS.
Gen. Sherman announces, under bis own
signature, bis arrival on the coast. The
capture of Fort McAllister on the 13th,
completed bis communication with the tleet.
Previously to that he had destroyed all the
railroads and invested the city. His march
was " agreeable," the weather fine, supplies
abundant. It is remarkable that we hear
nothing of those astounding ravages which
the Rebel Gen. Wheeler lias all along been
reported by the Richmond papers to have
made on Sherman's forces. But Gen. Sher
man says he lias not been "at all molested
by guerrillas." Not a wagon lost on the
trip. He lias utterly destroyed over two
hundred miles of rails. And he "regards
Savannah as already gained." Nothing
could be more perfect than the whole con
duct of this expedition, as nothing will be
more glorious than its filial result.
From Gen. Thomas we continue to receive
accounts of the enemy's defeat and flight.
Our forces were eight miles bevuud Frank
lin—twenty-six south of Nashville—on Sat
urday ; continually capturing prisoners,
trophies, and guns. Best of all. General
Thomas announces his purpose to keep on,
j and evidently means to clear Tennessee of
Rebels before he stops. Hood has but two
lines of retrect; one to Florence, Ala.; tlie
other to Corinth, Miss.
The deutli of Fort Pillow Forrest is re
ported. A more active, resolute, and blood
thirsty scoundrel did not exist in the Con
federacy.
We publish on our outside an excel
lent reply from Mr. Groat to some of the
inconsistencies and misstatements of the
editor of the Argus. \\ Idle we have 110 in
tention, as a general rule, to fill our columns
with controversial articles, this is written
in such a temper and style, and is so con
! elusive and satisfactory in its arguments,
thae for once we relax our rule. It will well
repay perusal.

CORRESPONDENCE\
Washington, Dec. 10,
I One week of the Second Session of the
j 38th Congress, is now past. In order to
; give the respective Committees time to act
upon bills in their hands, both houses have
adjourned over from Thursday last to Mon
day next.
The appointment and confirmation of Mr.
Chase as Chief Justice, in place of Judge
Taney, deceased, gives general satisfaction
among the friends of the Administration.—
As the court is now constituted, the coun
try may feel assured that we shall have no
more Dred Scott decisions.
The appointment of Mr. Speed, of Ken
i tucky, as Attorney General, in the place of
Mr. Bates, resigned, lias not yet been con
tinued by the Senate. Mr. Speed is said to
: be an able lawyer, but has until recently,
; acted with the Conservative elements in
, Kentucky politics, co-operating with the
Louisville Journal. He, however, left that
party this fall and came out acting in sup
r port of Mr. Lincoln, and now stands with
the radical anti slavery element in Ken-'
i tucky. His appointment will no doubt be
confirmed.
Several important measures have already
been proposed in Congress. On the very
, first day ol the session, Mr. Washburn re
vived the whisky tax question in the House,
by offering a resolution instructing the
Committee of Ways and Means to inquire
into the expediency of reporting a bill tax
ing whisky in the hands of holders. The
: Committee, I have 110 doubt, will report a
bill proposing to tax liquors in the hands
; of such holders as purchased before any tax
was imposed, and are still holding it for
speculative purposes, but it is hardly prob
able that they will impose a further tax up.
on liquors purchased since the tax of one
dollar and fifty cents per gallon was im
poses!.
1 deem the government tax on liquors
the best temperance law the people have |
ever had, and am decidedly in favor of tax
ing it to the highest point it will bear, based
upon principles of justice and equality.
When the Message of the President was
read by the clerk in the House, on Tuesday
last, the galleries were crowded to their ut
most capacity, yet the most perfect quiet
and order was maintained by the vast con
course, except when the closing passages
of the message relating to the restoration
of the 1 nion was read, there was an oc
casioned outburst of applause,and when the
clerk pronounced the following paragraph
in the message, viz : "I repeat tin; decla
ration made a year ago, that while I re
main in my present position, I shall not at
tempt to retract or modify the emancipation
proclamation, nor shall 1 return to slavery
any person who is free by the terms of that
proclamation, or by a 113- of the acts of Con
gress. If the people should, by whatever
mode or means, make it an Executive duty
to re-enslave such persons, another, and
not 1, must be their instrument to perform
it," there seemed to come an involuntary
outburst of joy, which was manifested by
the general clapping of hands by the vast
multitude, and which was heartily joined in
by thi' 1 nion Members on the Jloor of the
House.
By the action of the House 011 Monday
last, Mr. Stevens' bill proposing to declare
the government money "of equal value for
all purposes as gold and silver coin of like
denominations," etc., etc., was laid 011 the
table, by a vote of 73 yeas to 52 nays. The
friends of Col. John W. Forney, are presen
ting his name in connection with a Cabinet
appointment. The old Keystone should
most certainly be represented in the Cab-'
iuet, and I know of no man in Peiinsylvana
better quallified for such a position, nor one
who has rendered more service in bringing
about the re-election of Mr. Lincoln, and
whose appointment would be more satisfac
tory to the people than would Mr. Forney's.
Yours, truly, COMM.
HAiuusßt'iifs, l>tc. 15, 1864.
There lias been in this city a military
court in session for some weeks, before
which those Columbia county conspirators
have been tried, as well as other military
culprits that may have been so unfortunate
as to have been caught. For some time
past, this court has been engaged in the
trial of several rebel spies who were ar
rested upon the cars 011 the Cumberland
\ alley Kail Road.
A day or two since, a very singular cir
cumstance occurred in the progress of the
trial of two of the prisoners, who gave
their names as Thompson and Williams.—
Thompson pretended that he was well ac
quainted with a man Jin New York by whom
he could prove his innocence. This New
Worker was sent for, and came on with his
wife, and he proved to be a police detective
by the name of Klishu Wildey. When he
saw Thompson he denied ever having seen
him, although Thompson tried to be very
familiar and recall old recollections. But
when Wildey saw the prisoner Williams, he
recognized him as his son who had been
gone from home four years. At first Wil
liams refused to recognize Widley as his
father, but he soon however, shook hands
with him, and kissed Mrs. Wildey, saying,
" Oh, mother, you did not expect to see me
here, did you ?" The father says his son is
deranged, and was when he left home. Wil
dey and his wife came here thinking that
by a bare possibility Thompson might be
their son, at least so they allege.
There is still a great mystery in this
whole transaction. This man Wildey at the
time of his arrival here, had in his possess
ion the original charges given to William
son, another one of the spies, 011 the day of
his trial. How came he by that paper?
Surely this war is provicg that truth is
stranger than fiction.
A man was arrested here to day who had
a large amount of confederate money with
him, and bundles of matches secreted about
his clothing ; he is undoubtedly a spy sent
here to fire the city.
Our Presidential electors did a noble act
at the close of their session which should I
be spoken of to their praise throughout the
land. By a unanimous vote of the college,
j they appropriated their fees, or wages, to
the Christian Commission. This for each
one was but a small sum, still in the aggre
gate it amounted to eight hundred dollars,
as 1 was told by one of their number.—
; Surely this was praiseworthy.
I have just heard from the Bradford Ar
gun, a fact that 1 think if it becomes known
at the capitol of the nation, will materially
effect our government if not change its
whole course. It is most sincerely to be
hoped that the astounding information wilL
not be communicated to Mr. Lincoln. The
editor announces to his numerous readers,
♦that he has not read all the Message. This
could have been borne by the President had
he not added that, M we deem it hardly
worth while to read Mr. Lincoln's Message."
If the poor man in the White House should
hear this, how could he ever have the heart
to write another. Only think of it, the edi
tor of the Argue not deeming it worth
while to read a document that was prepared
for his special reading, and then to spread
that fact before all of the readers of that
widely circulated paper. How can the
President bear such neglect from the liter
ati of th > nation ? Should not some of his
friends buy up and destroy all the issues of
the Argue which contain this announcement,
lest the fact get to him and lie be ruined bv
such cruel neglect. X.
I®* The President of the Tinted States
having disapproved of that portion of (Jen.
Dix's recent order which instructs all mili
tary authorities on the frontier, in certain
cases, to cross the boundary line between
the 1 nited States and Canada, (Jen. Dix ,on
Saturday, issued an order revoking those
instructions, and directing, in case of future
marauding expeditions into our territory
from Canada, that the military commander
on the frontier report t his headquarters
in this eity r for orders.

the honor to report that the enemy has
been pressed at all points to-day in his
line of retreat to the Brentwood Hills.
"Brigadier-General Hatch, of Wilson's

enemy's left, and captured a large num
ber of prisoners, the number not vet re

"Major-General Schofield's Corps, next
un the left of cavalry, carried several hills,
raptured many prisoners and six pieces of
artillery.
"Brevet Major-General Siuith, next on
the left of Major-General Seholield, carried
the salient point of the enemy's line with
McMilan's brigade of MeArthur's division,
capturing sixteen pieces of artillery, two
brigadier-generals and about two thousand
prisoners.
"Brigadier-General Garrard's division, of

inents. capturing all the artillery and troops
of the enemy on the line.
"Brigadier-General Wood's troops on

something over six hundred prisoners, and
drove the enemy within one mile of the
Brentwood Hill pass.
"Major-General Steednian, commanding
detachments of the different armies of the
Military Division of the Mississippi, most
nobly supported General Y\ ood's left, and
bore a most honorable part in the opera

the troops are very much fatigued. The

Croxton's command, I know they have
made a large number. lam slso glml to

"The woods, fields and intreneliments are '

SECOND DESPATCH.
NASHVILLE, Teun., 9 p. M., Dec. IG.
" During last night Hood withdrew his
right from the river, and took a position
covering Hilshoro, Granny White and
Franklin pikes, which line had been care
fully prepared for just this contingency.
He was driven from the first line easily,
but the second was very stubbornly defen
ded, and at last heavily assaulted three
times before succeeding.
"It was carried, however, and twenty i
pieces of artillery, two thousand men, in- :
eluding General Jackson, with the remnant ;
of his division, were taken, the enemy i
fo cod back two miles, and his army bro- ;
ken in two parts,one on the White pike and i i
the other on the Franklin, with range of
bluffy I.ills between them, Steednian and
Wood pressing down the latter, A. J. Smith
Schotield and the cavalry down the former.
Small arms lay as thick on the contested
line as the rebels had stood there. Hood
can't make another such day's tight, while
Thomas is in good condition to press him.
Caught more wagons ; can't say the num
ber. Everybody, white and black, did
splendidly."

Official dispatches from (ten. Cauby have
been received to-day, showing the com

him from Vicksburg to cooperate with Hen.
Sherman's operations, and cut Ilood's com
munications with Mobile.
(Jen. Canby also reports the probable
success of another expedition from Baton
Rouge, under command of Gen. Davidson,
the details and object of which it is not
proper now to disclose. When last heard
from Davidson was reported as having
caused quite a panic in Mobile, and to be
devasting the country generally. Lieut.-
Col. Earl, commanding a special party,was
severely wounded, and fell into the hands
of the enemy at Fayette, Miss.
The Richmond papers of to-day conlirm
the reported capture of Bristol by sin expe
dition supposed to be under the command
of Steneman and Burbridge.
Also the surprise and capture of Glade
Spring depot, on the railroad thirteen miles
south of Abington, Va.
They also contain Gen. Hood's official
report of the battle of Franklin, in which
he acknowledges the loss of many gallant
officers and brave men, anion c whom he

down.

\\ e have not lost a wagon on the trip,
but have gathered in a large supply of ne
groes, mules, horses, tc., and our teams
are in far better condition than when we
started.
My first duty will be to clear the army
of surplus negroes, mules and horses.—
We have utterly destroyed over two hun
dred miles of rails, and consumed stores
and provisions that were essential to Lee's
and Hood's armies. The quick work made
with McAllister, and the opening of com
munication with our fleet, and the conse
quent independence for supplies, dissipates
all their boasted threats to head me off and
starve the army.
I regard Savannah as already gained.

'the official vote of this State for President is
now returned, and taking the highest vote for
i Electors on each ticket, shows a majority for Liu
j coin of 20,081. There were a few scattering votes
for Electors, in consequence of the misprint of a
portion of the Union tickets, but not enough to
I effect any results. Aaron Mull received 2,631 votes
by mistake. He was on the Union Electoral ticket
originally, but died during the summer and Wm.
Taylor was substituted. Mr. Taylor's majority is
therefore 2.000 less than the other Union Electors,
but he has still enough and to spare. The follow
