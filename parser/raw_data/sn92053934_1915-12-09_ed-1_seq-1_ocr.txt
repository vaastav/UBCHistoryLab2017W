represent the United States during the
reconstruction period in Mexico par
ticularly because of hlS"latniliarity
with Latin-American affairs and the
marked success of his mission in
Chile. He has long been in the Amer
ican diplomatic service, working his
way up from the lower grades. He is
a republican, lives in Chambersburg,
Pa., is 4.1 years old, and unmarried.
Generally Recognized.
Practically all the principal powers
of the world, with the exception of
Japan, now have followed the lead of
the Pan-American nations and recog
nized General Carranza'a government.

matic representatives in Mexico City
through the transition period and
many of them probably will remain.

and It Is believed that before the end
of the month he will be in Mexico City.
His selection of an ambassador to the
United States is the first of the long

Wilson Plan
is Attacked
onFordShip
New York, Dec. 9. A wireless mes
sage from the steamer Oscar II, sign
ed and prepaid by Henry Ford, was
received here today. The message gave
a summary of a speech delivered on
board last night by Judge Ben Lindsey
of Denver, in which he declared that
the spirit of love would be more effec
tive in international politics than mil
itary force.
Judge Lindsey told the peace advo
cates of his experience during 18 years
on the bench, drawing the conclusion
that criminals responded more quickly
to trust than to shackles and force. He
argued against the "preparedness pol
icy," basing a part of his contention
on the assertion that fire arms are un
known in the reform prison camps in
Colorado, except when they are needed
to protect the convicts from persons
living near the camps. He compared
"militaristic elements" with the "third
degree policeman" and deprecated the
efforts of force in either case.

ed from Alexandria, Egypt, for New
York on Dec. S, according to an an
nouncement by Lloyds.
The first report that the Communi
paw had be.en sunk was received on
Dec. 7. It would appear, therefore,
that the tanker has been confused with
some other vessel which was sunk.
Prior to this there have been con
flicting reports concerning the identity
of the steamer which was torpedoed.

Into effect a similar system hero.
Hugo Alvine, Thirty-ninth street and Seventh avenue, Rock Island,
special agent for the Rock Island lines at the Silvis yards, was found dead
with a bullet hole in his head at 2:15 o'clock this afternoon at Carbon
Cliff.
A discharged employe of the Rock Island road is suspected of having
murdered him. The body was lying near some willow bushes a short dis
tance from the tracks.
Mr. Alvine was a middle-aged man and leaves a family. He was deputy
sheriff and turnkey under Sheriff O. L Bruner, and was seriously injured
in the jail delivery which was enginesred by Clyde Stratton.
The position in which the body was lying indicated that the former
deputy sheriff had been shot from ambush. A 38 calibre bullet entered
the forehead almost directly over the nose, according to statements made
by the switchman who found the body.
It is understood that a man who had been discharged from employment
by reason of investigations made by Mr. Alvine had made threats against
him and that he was being sought by authorities.
Details were very meager this afternoon and it is not known who was
with the special agent last.
Chief Detective Duffin of the Rock Island lines, left his offices in Dav
enport immediately when notified of the murder and went to Silvis. He
assumed charge of the case and directed activities of a force of special
agents employed by the company in this community. County officials
aided in the search and police headquarters in cities within a large radius
from Silvis have been notified.
State's Attorney Floyd Thompson stated that a thorough investigation
of the circumstances surrounding the shooting would be made and it is
possible that the grand jury will be recalled.
SEE AMERICA
IN WAR WITH
THE TEUTONS
Paris, Dec. 9, (4:40 a. ru.) Under
the caption, "Gulliver Wakes Up," M.
Reinach, the political writer, in an arti
cle in the Figaro comments at length
pjuExesidant. Wilson's message-to con
gress. He declares that the message
was animated by righteous anger. It
is evident, says M. Reinach. that the
president was moved to the deepest
indignation by the revelations in the
trial of the directors and several em
ployes of the Hamburg-American
Steamship line on a charge of conspir
ing to defraud the government.
"The more one reflects," says M.
Reinach, "the more one is convinced
that the economic and political absorp.
tion of America is one of the great
secret designs of the Germanic em
pire and that consequently nothing is
more inevitable than an eventual con
flict between Germany and the United
States. Such a war is written in the
great book of destiny. None can ef
face the writing. Human nature is not
absolute. It is changed by logic of
things. It is for America to decide
whether to let Germany choose the
hour or choose it herself."
Most of the other newspapers refer
to the message wltn approval.

Cattle and

in New York
New York, Dec. 9. Battery Park and
the mouth of the Hudson river off the

regular western roundup of cattle,
sheep and calves as the result of a col
lision between the steamship North
Star, leaving for Portland, Maine, and
a barge loaded with livestock bound
frora ersey;-lo'ah-abbatOir 'on the East
river shore. A, great hole was torn in
the side of the barge by the bow of the
steamer and many of the hundreds of
cattle and sheep drifted-out through it
and swam frantically about the stone
wall around Battery Park in a vain ef
fort to reach safety.
Between 100 and 200 of the animals i
were drowned and their bodies today
are drifting about the harbor. A few,
captured by policemen and firemen,
were imprisoned in a temporary corral
formed by arranging park seats in a
circle in Battery Park and were kept
there until today.
Search was made today for scores
of sheep and calves captured by citi
zens in the confusion which followed
the collision.
THE WAR TODAY
Germany will listen to peace
proposals if they are such as she
considers reasonable, but will not
herself propose peace, was the es
sence of a statement on the snb
ject made by Dr. von Betbmann
Hollweg.lhe Imperial chancellor,
In the reiehstag today.
With public opinion in the allied
nations misguided, as he declared
it to be. It would be folly for Ger
many to ad Tance terms of peace,
the chancellor declared. She would
discuss peace proposals, if they
were compatible with Germany's
dignity and safety.
With consciousness of her mili
tary successes, Germany declined
responsibility for further continu
ation of the war, said the chancel
lor. But the war could be ter
minated "only by a peace which
will give a certitude that war will
not return."
Germany was not fighting for
the subjugation of other nations,
but for the protection of her na
tional life, as she had fought from
the beginning, said the chancellor.
He declared her food supplies
were ample and decried the idea
that she could be starved out
Although the Bulgarians have
been vigorously attacking the new
lines established by the French in
southern Serbia, they haTe made

ALBANIANSIN
PENATTACK
ON REFUGEES
Berlin, (via London, Dec. 9, 4:51 a.
m.) The outstanding feature of the
situation on the Serbian front as
shown by information received here Is
that the Albanian tribesmen, partic
ularly the Arnauts, have risen against
the fragments of Serbian forces which
have crossed the frontier into the Al
banian mountains. Military writers
here express the belief that the Ser
bians have little mercy to expect from
the Albanians who still maintain the
blood feud declared after the Serbian
"assimilation" of the tribesmen in the
parts of Albania occupied by them dur
ing and after the Balkan war with
Turkey.
With the exception of a small band
of Serbians, the remnant of the Mon
astir army north of Ochrida lake, no
part of the Serbian armies remains on
Serbian soil, it is stated. The fugi
tives, without artillery or transport
trains and with only such supplies
as they can carry on their backs, are
struggling not only with the pursuing
Bulgars, Austro-Germans and hostile
Albanians but with the rigors of full
winter in the pathless Albanian moun
tains. Military men here express the
belief that not even a fragment will
succeed in crossing Albania to the sea.
The Montenegrin army, with such
Serbians as were able to retreat in
conjunction with it, is said to be in
slightly better plight. The Monteneg
rins have been driven from their
strong mountain positions along the
crest of the Suhodof range, 3,500 feet
high, on the northeastern frontier. The
Austrians stormed these positions at
the point of the bayonet after sufficient
artillery preliminaries. The Monteneg -
rins were badly defeated, it is report-! safeguard the interests of the Anglo

IS OPINION OF CIIANCELLO
Offers to be
an American
for His Wife
San Francisco, Dec 9. Mrs. Ethel
Cooper McKenzie, born in California,
whose right of suffrage was taken
from her by the supreme court of the
United States on the ground that she
is the wife of a British citizen, Gordon
McKenzie (known professionally as a
singer by the name of McKenzie Gor
don), Is to have the vote after all.
Gordon McKenzie, it is announced
today, -will, for his wife's sake, re
nounce his British citizenship and
take out papers leading to his loom
ing a citizen of the United Statist of
America.
Mrs. McKenzie's fight for suffrage
forms an interesting chapter in the
legal annals of the United States. She
contended that as American born she
was entitled to the vote. The courts
held that as the wife of a British sub
ject she was not. She carried her
fight to the court of last resort, the
supreme court of the United States,
which this week ruled that her citi
zenship went with that of her husband.
The case acquired added importance
in that it was looked on as a test
case.

London, Dec. 9, (11:55 a. m.) tier

revelation of the stand she expects to
take should the arena of hostilities be
transferred to her soil.

j presses fear that he is not authorized

GIVES KAISER STAND
Grounds for Ending the War
Must Be Compatible With
Dignity and Safety.
Berlin, Dec. 9, (by wireless to Say-
ville). -"If our enemies make peaca ;
proposals compatible with Germany's
dignity and safety, then we shall al
ways be ready to discuss them," said
the Imperial chancellor. Dr. Beth-mann-HoIlweg,
in addressing thai
reiehstag today. The chancellor
made it clear that In his opinion It
would be folly for Germany to pro
pose peace "as long aa in the conn- ...
tries of our enemies the euilt and Ig
norance of statesmen are entangled
with confusion of public opinion."
Conscious of her military successes.
the chancellor said, Germany declines
responsibility for a further continua
tion of the war. Germany, he declar
ed, could not be charged with the pur-
pose of fighting on to make further f
conquests. I
"The war can be terminated only
by a peace which will give the certi

chancellor declared. "We all agree
about that"
He asserted Germany's food supplies
were sufficient and that her immense

Hollweg, which had been awaited with
extraordinary interest, was made In
response to the socialist interpella
tion: "Is the imperial chancellor Teady to
give information as to the condition
under which he will be willing to n
ter into peace negotiations?"
In his reply he said:
"As long as in the countries of our
enemies the guilt and ignorance of
statesmen are entangled with confu
sion of public opinion, it would be fol
ly for Germany to make peace pro
posals, which would not shorten, but
would lengthen the duration of the
war. First, the masks must be torn
from their faces.
"At present they speak of a war of
annihilation against us. We have to
take this fact into account. Theoreti
cal arguments for peace or proposals
of peace will not advance us, will not
bring the end nearer.
"If our enemies make peace pro
posals compatible with Germany's
dignity and safety, then we shall al
ways be ready to discuss them. Fully
conscious of our unshaken military
successes, we decline responsibility
for continuation of the misery which
now fills Europe and the whole world.
No one can say that we continue th
war because we still desire to con
quer this or that country as a guar
antee." Is Heartily Cheered.
In these words the chancellor, with
impassioned force, stated the position
of the German government on the
question of peace. His remarks were
cheered with great enthusiasm.
When Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg
rose to reply to the interpellation, pre-.
sented by Dr. Scheidemann, socialist
leader, silence fell over the house, but
was soon broken by manifestations of
approval. Several times the deputies
Interrupted him with cheers.
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg began
by saying that In the countries at war
with Germany there had been much
discussion of the socialist interpella
tion and that the knowledge that
peace was to be discussed in the reich
stag had been a source of satisfaction
to these countries. This was incosa
prehensibie, in view of the success
won in the campaign against Serbia,
which opened the road to Germany's
Turkish allies and threatened the most
vulnerable points of the British em
pire. So Overtnres Made.
Although this situation would ex
plain a desire for peace on the part
of Germany's enemies, he declared,
none of them had made overtures. In
stead, they were clinging to the lnten-.
tions which they had announced pub
licly "with naive brutality" at the be
ginning of the war.
The chancellor then reviewed recent
utterances concerning conditions of
peace made in countries opposed to
Germany, such as the handing over ot
Alsace and Lorraine to France, the an
