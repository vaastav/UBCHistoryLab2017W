The writer adds that the wort feature
of the affair Is that hlle the chief

tested against Zekki Pasha's lawless
cruelty, was dismissed from Hi ofn.ee,
Zekkl Pasha was rcnardeJ with an Im

The Times, In a leader, admits that
there Is no longer any possible doubt
that there Is a substantial bails of fact
in the reports, and adds that It has rea
son to believe that unimpeachable evi
dence Is forthcoming that will fully
Justify Great Britain's protest.
Already there Is enough evidence to
show that heavy responsibility rests
with the Torte for rewarding Instead of
punishing the offenders. Great Britain.
Tho Times declares, ought not to be left
alone In her protest. It Is fortunate
that the Itusso-Brltlsh entente renden
any divergent treatment of the question
by Russia Impossible.
In conclusion Tho Times says. "Wo do
not doubt tho humanity of the Hultiiu.
but he has been misled by the reports
of officials. The Porto cannot nffoid to
ignore foreign opinion such as Is repre
sented by tho Washington Senate. If
the powers were united they could soon

"President Cleveland reiterates his

until tho Democrats return to power

"America Is going to bid for the su

The Olobc this afternoon, commenting
on the sumo subject, remarks:

rilLO.N, Colombln, Nov 2T. Tho ports
on the Isthmus of Panama have been
"free" for a number of jears under
a. treaty, but the Leglslntmn lately
hurried throtirh a U1 to levy a It) per
cent, ad valorem duty on all Imports,
beginning Jan. 1, 1895.
This Impost was lo take the place
of the tax now collected from merchants
under the head of "monthly contribu
tions," which have been bitterly com
plained of as unequal and unjust.
As soon a", the new bill passed Im
porters ordered goods from abroad In
such quantities as to practically render
tho measure Inoperative for two jcars
at least The warehouses are tilled with
goods to their capacity. Moreover, the
Isthmus courts have decided that the
nd valorem Import duty cannot bo
legally collected In the face of the
treaty, but the Government doubtless
will submit the question to tho Supreme
Court In Bogota.
After a short strike of laborers on the

vicinity raised the prices of articles of

It has been suggested that tho canal
people should, as they did cars ago,
bring fodd Into tho country an feed
their employees. This would give groc
ers no chance of benefiting by the woik

Lively Six-Round Go.
Dick Connors Succumbs to Eddie
Connell After n GuiiieUnttlc.
About MO sp-rts paid ?2 eacti last night
to witness two prize-lights In the gym
natrium ot an uptown club. The princi
pals were Joe Hopkins, ot this city, and
Alexander Stocks, formerly of Staten
Island, both colore!, nnd Dick Connors,
of this city, nnd Eddie Connell, of the
Scottish American Athletic Club, cf Jer
sey City. Both pairs were offered $125,
the winner lo recelvo $100 and the loser
$23. It was nearly midnight when Hop
kins and Stocks entered the ring.
Stocks weighed m pounds and Hopkins
127 pounds. Stocks was looked after by
Jimmy Atiearn, while Hopkins was at
tended by Charley Burns. Martin
Don ling, backer of Billy Pllmmer, was
time-keeper, and Jerry Murphy referee.
In the first round Stocks feinted for
Hopkins's stomach and missed. Hop
kins rushed at Stocks and landed a hard
left on the stomach and a heavy right
on the Jaw. Stocks fell like a log.
Everybody thought that Stocks was
knocked out, hut he struggled to his
feet, ani Hopkins Hhce more tried to
knock him out. but Stocks clinched, and
the call of time saved him.
In the second round Stocks came up
fresh, and the fight became a slugging
affair, Stocks's right ese being badly
discolored and his cheek being cut open.
Hopkins continued to Inflict the severe
punishment, but In the fifth round Stocks
must havo gotten his second wind, and
with heavy left-hand body punches and
swings or. the Jaw he had Hopkins
In the sixth round both started to end
the fight, and after two minutes of ter
rinc lighting both were too weak to de
liver a knockout. The referee awarded
tho fight to Hopkins
Dick Connors and Uidle Connell next
entered the ring. Connell weighed 111
pounds and was attended by Charley
Roder and Andy Currnn. Connan
weighed 122 pounds nnd was looked after
by Jim Brown and Jimmy Ahearn. This
fight proved the prettiest seen In a long
time. From the call of time both fought
hard, Connors resorting to right-hand
swings and Connell to straight left-hand
Jabs and heavy body punches. Tlie first
and second rounds were even, but In the
third round Connell rushed Connors all
over thirlng, smashing him In the face
and stomach. Connors was very weak,
and his noe was bleeding profusely.
In the fourth round Connell recognized
Connors's miserable condition and start
ed to finish him. He had landed a heavy
left on the stomach, and with a right
hand swing on the Jaw, knocked Connors
down, where he lay for seven seconds.
He struggled to his feet, and Connell
again swung on his Jaw, dropping him
to the floor again. The plucky fighter
gained his feet again, only to be knocked
down fjr the third time.
Connors got on his feet again, and
Connell, with a left-hand upper cut
on the Jaw, knocked tilm down for the
fourth time. Connors would surely have
been counted out but for the call of
time.
When time was called for the fifth
round, Connors staggered to the centre
of the ring, and Connell again landed
heavily on his Jaw, knocking him down.
Connors waited eight seconds and stag
gered to his feet, and Connell again
knocked him down with a heavy right
hand swing on the stomach. Connors
tried again to get up. but rolled over -on
his back and was counted out.

the Lehigh Valley Railroad at Ke
shanlc about i o'clock this morning. A
coal train drawn by engine '12 stopped
to take water at the tank. No flagman
was sent back to give notice of danger.
Soon a deafening crash was heard,
and No. 380, drawing a heavily loaded
coal train running at the rate of forty
miles an hour, was seen running head
long Into the rear end of the first train.
Twenty cars and the locomotive were
piled In a tangled mass. Coal was
strewn, along the track for about one
eighth of a mile and traffic was de
layed five hours.
Francis W. Stecket, a brakeman, who
was sitting In the caboose of the first
train, was thrown down a steep em

moned, and the Injured man was soon
taken to St. Luke's Hospital. Bethlehem.
He received Internal Injuries.
