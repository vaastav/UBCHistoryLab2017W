AT THE VLAY LAST NIGHT.
The presentation of "Henry VIII" at
the Crawford last night with Louis
James as "Cardinal Wolsey" and Mad
am Helen Modjeska as "Queen Kather
ine," from all standpoints was the most
notable dramatic event of the season.
The company includes the names of
several of the best known actors of the
country, the stage settings were elab
orate and technically correct, the cos
tuming was done with a lavish hand
and still the audience was the smallest
that has greeted Madam Modj'eska in
Topeka. There were many seats vacant
on the first floor and the boxes were but
partly filled.
Madam Modjeska's abilities are given
excellent opportunities in the part of
"Queen Katherine" and the great Polish
actress appears to far better advantaga
in that role than she did in either the
part of "Mary Stuart" or in "King
John" a year ago. Age has necessarily
forced certain limitations upon Madam
Modjeska which have been painfully
apparent before but as the divorced
wife of the King of England she met
every requirement with less evidence
of age. Madam Modjeska's pronunci
ation is of course peculiar but perhaps
not distasteful. Madam Modjeska was
especially pleasing in the trial scene
and in the interview with "Wolsey" and
"Campelus."
Louis James as "Cardinal Wrolsey"
received the largest share of the ap
plause after the scene of the fall of the
mighty cardinal. Mr. James was last
seen here two years ago in "The School
For Scandal" and from the jolly, rol
licking" part of the Sheridan play to the
sedate and all powerful character in the
Shakespearian drama is a decided
change, but surprising as it may seem
Mr. James was as perfect in one .part
as the other. It was a decided surprise
to see him in the comedy part in "The
School for Scandal" after his years in
Shakespearian and kindred plays but as
surprising as it was he handled the part
with a lightness that was remarkable.
Then he was deviating from his usunl
path and last night he was again seen
in one of his favorite roles.
As the cunning churchman Mr. James
was at his best. He was decidedly
more in favor with the audience than
Madam Modjeska as the two curtain
calls after the farewell to all his future
greatness would indicate. From the
dancing scene in Wolsey Hall where
the cardinal watched the minuet in si
lent approbation to the stormy inter
view with the king. Mr. James was the
perfect master of the part.
Norman Hackett made a kingly
"King of England." He possessed all
the pomp and swagger due the charac
ter and made it sufficiently execrable.
Several times the audience awarded Mr.
Hackett their approval by applause.
Thomas Coffin Cooke as "Duke of Buck
ingham" received a curtain call after
the execution scene. Wadsworth Har
ris as "Duke of Norfolk," made up a

trio of well known Shakespearian ac
tors that materially strengthened the
supporting company. Miss Aphie
James made a charming "Anne Boleyn"
and captivated the audience as well as
the king.
The staging of the play was magnificent
but the Crawford stage would not hold all
the scenery carried by the company and
the regular settings for several scenes
were not used and the settings for other
scenes were pressed into service to save
completely blockading the stage with the
two carloads of scenery carried by the
company. The council chamber In the
palace, Wolsey's hall and the queen's
apartments were magnificent and by far
the most elaborate stage settings seen
here this season.
In the third act showing the queen's
apartments a Kansas girl held the center
of the stage for a time. She was Louise
Gale, a lady of the court, and sang the
song at the request of "Queen Kather
ine." Of all the company of players with Mod
jeska this year. Louise Gale is said to be
the favorite. The affectionate looks and
smiles which Modjeska bestows on Miss
Gale during the play are not all "stage
business." Madame Modjeska has invited
Miss Gale to spend six weeks with her at
her own home in San Francisco when the
company reaches there. The costume
which Miss Gale wore last night In the
ball room scene was designed especially
for Miss Gale by Madame Modjeska her
self. How old is Miss Gale? Well, of course,
that's a secret, but on good authority it
is stated that she is the youngest by sev
eral years of any other actress in the
play. Twenty years would not be far
from a correct guess. She has been on the
stage only two years, both seasons with
Modjeska. Last year she played in To
peka the part of Arthur in King John,
and played it well. Kut she was only an
understudy for the part and played here
because her principal, Odette Tyler, was
sick.
For two years prior to going onto the
stage Miss Gale studied with teachers in
Chicago and New York. Her work was
largely in music as it was and is her am
bition to sing in opera. That she has an
admirable voice for operatic work was
demonstrated by her little song last night.
Miss Gale enjoys her work thoroughly
and speaks of Madame Modjeska in most
endearing terms. She admitted last night
that she was considerably excited because
of the fact that her mother and a num
ber of Council Grove friends had come to
Topeka to see her, and was more or less
worried for fear that she would not please
them with her acting. She received sev
eral immense boxes of roses from friends
during the performancee.
Miss Gale's mother does not travel with
her. but expects to accompany her from
Topeka as far west as Salt Lake City.
Mr. Gale is a well-to-do lawyer in Coun
cil Grove.
A BUKGLAB SCARE.
How Mrs. Diggs Mat a Severe
Disappointment.
A few nights ago in the stillness of
the wee sma' hours mysterious sounds
were heard in the house occupied by
Mrs. Annie L. Diggs, state librarian,
and her daughter, Miss Mabel Diggs,
and Miss McLallin. They were alone in
the house at the time.
The strange sounds awoke one of the
trio and she awakened the other two.
They listened a few moments and then
heard sounds which indicated that some
one was moving about in the kitchen.
Naturally they hesitated about tackling
a burglar unarmed, and their first
thought was to summon a policeman.
No one of them wished to go for an
officer alone, and if either two went the
third one did not wish to stay alone in
the house with the burglar, so all three
hurriedly dressed and started to find
a policeman.
The house stands on Twelfth street,
west of the car barns and not far fro-n
them. It was hastily decided to go to
the street car barns and telephone from
there for an officer, but before they had
gone far they met two men.
"Is there a police station at the car
barns?" gasped Mrs. Diggs excitedly.
"She means is there a telephone
there," corrected Miss Mabel.
"We've got burglars in our house,"
said Miss McLalllin.
The men offered to go back with the
trio and reconnoitre the premises. The
offer was gratefully accepted. They
marched boldly into the house, expect
ing to scare the burglars out, but no
burglars scared. They listened a mo
ment, but not a sound could be heard.
At length there were sounds again as
of some one moving about in the
kitchen. A light was secured and the
men broke into the kitcher, while the
women held their breath expectantly.
The room was empty, but a search re
vealed a rat.
At least this is the story that is told
by the two men.

Submarine Boat Fnlton Sinks at
Her Pier
And Resists Efforts to Bring
Her to the Surface.
DUE TO AS ACCIDENT.
Hatchway Was Left Open by
Some Workmen.
Water Got Inside and Took
Her to the Bottom.
Workmen Succeeded in Getting
Her Up With Little Damage.
New York, Dec. 11. The submarine
torpedo boat Fulton, which sank at her
dock at New Suffolk, L. I., on Monday
was raised today. The only damage
done the boat was by the water that
poured into her through the open for
ward hatch. Her bottom was not dam
aged. After her machinery has been
overhauled and cleaned, the vessel will
be as good as ever.
The boat went down almost at the
same spot where she underwent her fifteen-hours'
test under water about two
weeks ago.
The accident happened while her com
mander, Captain Cable, was in New
York on account of the illness of his
wife. In order to repair an exhaust
valve, the crew raised the stern of the
Fulton under a derrick is the air. One
of the forward hatches had been left
open, and as the stern was raised and
the bow was submerged the craft filled
with water. By the time the stern was
lowered the boat sank in about fif
teen feet of water.
At the offices of Isaac L. Rice, presi
dent of the company it is stated that in
view of the fact that the work of re
floating the boat was begun so soon, it
is thought that the damage from salt
water to the delicate iron and steel ma
chinery will not amount to anything,
owing to the short duration of the ex
posure of the machinery to water. A
force of twenty men will be put to work
on the Fulton to clean and oil her parts
as soon as she is afloat and put her in
shape for her sea trip to Washington
in company witn a convoy of the com
pany's vessels.
In the event of any part of the Ful
ton having been irreparably damaged,
the company will use a duplicate part
from the Adder, her sister ship, now be
ing built for the government. Her elec
tric battery, with which she is propelled,
will probably have to be replaced. As
soon as Captain Cable reaches New
Suffolk it will probably be known how
soon the boat will be able to go to
Washington.
EXPECTED NEXT WEEK.
Leland's Nomination Will Go to
the Senate.
It is understood that the nomination
Of Cyrus Leland to the Topeka pension
agency 'will be one of the first that will
be sent to the senate for confirmation
the coming week by President Roose
velt. In fact it may be looked for al
most any time between now and De
cember 19. If for any reason, it should
be delayed beyond that time it will go
over until after the holidays, as con
gress has set Dec. 19 as the dat on
which the holiday recess shall com
mence. The Burton faction is now claiming
that the president has determined to
leave the appointment to whoever a
majority of the Kansas delegation in
congress shall agree upon, but it is un
derstood that Mr. Leland would get it
even if this should be done, for he is
said to have at least a clear majority
of the Kansas congressmen on his side.
CANNIBALISM APPEARS.

TODAI'S MARKET REPORT.
Chicago, Dec 11. WHEAT An easy
tone prevailed in wheat shortly after the
opening today as the result of offerings
greatly in excess of the demand. Cables
were rather firm to start with and May
options opened rac higher to a Bhade
lower, at 82&8lc. At once the heavy
stream of long stuff began to come out
and a sag in prices followed. May quick
ly sold off to &c. Receipts were fairly
liberal, especially in the northwest. Out
side markets reported fair advances and
this, with liberal covering by shorts,
brought a reaction . to 81?ic. Local re
ceipts were 315 cars: Minneapolis and Du
luth reported 690 cars, making a total for
the three points of S05 cars, against 7K8
cars last week and 945 cars a year ago.
The slight early reaction in wheat lasted
but a short time. Holders of long wheat
and bulls in general were tired of the
game and the stream that poured into the
pit broke May to 7bTo. The close was
weak and lc down, at SO'.sSOVic
CORN Corn held steady, influenced by
wheat and firmer cables. May opened sc
higher to c lower, at 67fi67?sc. Trade
was light. Shippers were moderate buy
ers, but considerable long corn came out
again and prices sagged to 67c. There
was an easy reaction, however, at the end
of the first hour, May holding about at
yesterday's close. Receipts were 123 cars.
Selling by both longs and shorts and
the wheat weakness depressed May corn
to 66o. It closed weak and lo down, at
67 Vic
OATS Oats opened somewhat easier.
May starting unchanged to c lower, at
4tiV46c. There was a fair cash demand
and some liberal selling by commission
houses. May early sold off to 45Jc, and
steadied around that figure. Receipts were
126 cars.
PROVISIONS Provisions opened easier
on liberal hog receipts and lower prices
at the yards. Pork was offered freely for
the outside account, but January held
well up on a small demand; January pork
opened 5o higher, at $16.85; January lard

was great irregularity In opening price
changes on the stock exchange todav.
Changes were confined to fractions with
the exception of losses of a point in Man
hattan and Lackawanna. - Amalgamated

and then rose as much above last night
on large dealings.
The whole market weakened on the en
gagement of $500,000 gold for export.
ihere were losses of a point or over in
Tvew York Central, Baltimore and Ohio,
Delaware and Hudson, Iowa Central.
Pressed Steel Car preferred. Smelting and
Consolidated Gas and of a sharp fraction
in the U. S. Steel stocks, the Eriea and
the Readings.
Recoveries ran to a point In some in
stances and the market became dull and
irregular when Amalgamated Copper re
acted to near 70.
There was less dofng In the general
market, operators preferring to deal light
ly pending a more settled course in Amal
gamated Copper. Prices generally were
above the lowest. Amalgamated Copper

where. The Readings. Pennsylvania and

to 72. T

mensely dull and yielded somewhat.
A rapid fall in Amalgamated Copper to

nental stocks enlivened trading somewhat.

clined to 1596 and the Pacifies were alsj
at the lowest. Baltimore and Ohio de
clined 2 points to pax. New York Cen
tral, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Hudson
