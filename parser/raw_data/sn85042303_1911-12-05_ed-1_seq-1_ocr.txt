COULDWT QUIT
My customers and friends were sorry when I told you in No
vember that I would quit the credit business on December 1st. I
tried and couldn't do it, but I will swear that I had more people
than ever wanting credit Some wanted to pay l down and some
half down; others wanted the full bill of goods with nothing down.
For this reason I am going to continue the easy-payment plan
until January 1st. But please don't ask me to loan you any cash.
The first payment makes you and I partners. I am overstocked and
owe my creditors for several carloads of new goods. Walking is
good on our paved Caddo street, so come up and see our goods and
prices. No trade, no harm. No rents to pay, so I sell the cheap
est New and secondhand goods of all kinds.

night of September 30h, 1910, at 5: 45
o'clock. I placed in the Times building,
a suit case, containing sixteen sticks
of dynamite, set to explode at 1
o'clock the next morning. It was my
intention to Injure the building and
scare the owners. I did not Intend to
take the life of any one. I Blncerely
regret that those i:nfortunate men lost
their, lives. If the giving of my life
would firing them back, I would gladly
give it. In pleading guilty to first de
gree murder, I have placed my life in
the hands of the state.
