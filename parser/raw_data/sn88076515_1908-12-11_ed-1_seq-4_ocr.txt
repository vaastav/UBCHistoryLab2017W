On the other hand with a reduction
of the tariff on wheat to auy great ex
tent the product of the farmers of the
great northwest would be thrown on
an open market in competition with
the products of Canada, Russia and
Argentina, and instead of the home
consumption all being taken from the
products of the United States we
would be on an equal footing with
these other countries, and the price of
the farmer's product would not only
be regulated by what the crop was and
the consumption of our own country,
but we would also have to consider
the other wheat raising countries.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
On another page we print the last
message of President Roosevelt to
congress. As usual it is full of good,
sound suggestions. He treats on cor
porations, and states that in his opin
ion it is not best to entirely do away
with corporations, but to so regulate
I them that only those that work for
good shall continue, and that intelli
gence should receive the reward

Duell was urged to be a candidate for
this office by many of his friends in
the county, most prominent among
whom were numerous members of the
bar, it being their impressiou that he
was just the proper man for the posi

support of these people that he con

elected by a handsome vote, he has
the people behind him and it is con

than ever before.

The Hero of Flint Hill.
[Copyright, 1908, by T. C. McClure.]
Jed Parker had been courting Mary
Stevens for a year when he went to
her father to ask the usual question.
Jed was a young aifd worthy farmer
living at the top of Golden hill, and
Jim StevenSj as ho was familiarly call
ed, lived iu the village at the foot of
the hill and was a contractor. His
work was in the country around more
than in the village. He was well
liked, but people said he had some odd
ideas. Jed Parker bumped up against
one of those odd ideas as soon as he
had stated his case to the father.
"Look here, Jed," was the reply. "Of
{Course I know that you have been
hanging around here a good deal, and
I reasoned It out that Mary was the
attraction. You are spoken of as a
fine young man, and I have no objec
tion to you as a son-in-law. I cannot
say yes, however, until you have done
Bomething to distinguish yourself. I
had killed a mad dog, shot at a horse
thief and licked a lightning rod man
before I was your age. I like you,
Jed, but I want a hero for a son-in
law, and the sooner you toe the mark
the sooner you and Mary earn get mar
ried."
Jed didn't kick over the traces and
raise a row, but came to the house as
usual. Things were In statu quo when
December and the snow and Ice came.
Golden hill was a pretty steep hill, and
the road winding up was half a mile
long. In winter, when the road was
slippery, teams went a mile around
rather than go up or down. Such of
the village boys as had the ambition
to drag their sleds to the top came
down with such momentum that they
were carried through the village and
to the foot of a hill on the other side.
Mr. Stevens had In bis employ as
contractor a gang of Italians. As win
ter came on they were just finishing up
grading the highway three miles away.
There was some misunderstanding
about the pay for overwork. They
mad* threats, but the contractor re
fused to be bulldozed They bung
about the village, muttering and men
acing, and finally decided to take the
law into their own hands. At o'clock
one evening a deputation called a* Ste
vens' house and captured trim before
ha knew what was up. He was taken
oat on the street and told that be must
either pay or hang. The villagers gath
ered. but they were not strong enough
to interfere It was then that Mary
sent a boy sjieeding up the long bin to
bear the news to Jed.
"Go as fast as you can," she said.
"Tell Jed that they are going to hang
father. Tell him to come to the res
cue. Tell him that I sent you. Tell
him it's his chance to be a hero. Run
as you never ran before, and 111 give
you a dollar."
"What's a hero?"
"Never mind, but fly!"
The road was packed with snow and
Ice on top of that, but the boy got
there.
"By gosh!" was Jed's only reply, and
he began to hustle.
He had been drawing up wood that
afternoon, and the bobsleds were in
front of the house. He got his oven
coat and fur cap and the family din
ner horn, and as he dragged the sled
down to the highway be said to the
boy:
"Jim, we are going down the hill
a-kiting. You sit in front and begin
blowing the horn as soon as we start
Blow, blow, blow!. Hang on and blow.
1*11 sit behind and steer. Now, then,
we're ofT."
The contractor was a man with
•and.. Even when he saw the ropes In
the hands of the excited and determin
ed gang he would not give In. They
led him over the bridge to the foot of
the hill, and as he was still obstinate
they prepared to hang him to a handy
Kmb. In fact, they did hang him.
There were thirty In the gang, and
while some kept hack the villager*
with their knives the others pulled on
the rope and made It fast. Just as
there was every prospect that the
lynching business would' be an un
qualified success the blare of a born
was heard up the hill, accompanied by
acreeches and yells. Jed and the boy
•fid the bobsleds were coming. They
came like a runaway locomotive. The
crowd hadn't time to take ln the situa
tion when the sled was upos them.
It plowed through them like a Bhovel
through flour. It ran over some it
flung others twenty feet away It sent
otters sky high. There was scarcely
man left on his feet when the sled
bad passed, and this was the moment
when Mary and a citizen or two came
np and lowered the wriggling body.
Over the bridge and through the vil
lage and half a mile beyond went the
runaway. and by the time Jed got
hack to the bridge on foot the con
tractor had been carried to his own
boose and a doctor was working over
bin.
As for the gang, no one was killed,
bot there were broken legs and arms
and bruises galore, and the town was
ttttle better than a hospital for the
•ext month. There were two doctors
In the town, and they had twenty-six
patients to look after. Four days
after th» hanging Mr. Stevens sent foi
Jed and took him by the hand and
•iked:
