Story of Fanaticism and Supersti
tion Told by One of the Dupes of ]
the Holly Rollers.
Kansas City, Dec. 11.?"I am not
soing to die. I am going to get well
and live to kill a few more r;olice
men."
That Is the assertion of Louis
Pratt, self-styled "Adam God," the
religious fanatic, who is lying in the
.general hospital, seriously wounded
in a battle between his followers an t
the police Tuesday night.
As a result of the fight Pratt's
13-year-old daughter, Lula. and
Policeman Alber O. Dalbow are dead
and two other policemen are in a
?critical condition.
James Sharp, known! as "Elijah
' II," and who was the real leader of
the little band of religious enthusi- j
asts, is still at large.
Shortly after the shooting Tues
day he walked into a saloon, laid
?down his revolver with the remar<,
?'I am satisfied; I give up."
As there was no policeman present
and no one seemed inclined to take
him into custody, Sharp waited a
moment, then picked up the weapon,
reloaded it and walked out. He has
not been seen since.
Airs. Pratt, with two of her young
daughters, spent Tuesday night in
the matron's room at police head
?quarters, but Mrs. Sharp, who fireu
two of the shots that struck Police
man Michael Mullane, was confined
in the city jail.
"I've been in trouble before," said
"Mrs. Pratt, and If I can be killed
for righteousness sake I shall bej
eternally happy." . ?
Mrs. Pratt bemoaned the death of |
"her other daughter, Lula, aged 13,
Tvbo was shot during the second
stage of Tuesday's battle when the
woman and her children pulled off
in a rowboat in the Mississippi river
and attempted to escape.
' At the hospital it was said that
Patrolman Mullane had small
chance of recovery, but that Ser
geant Patrick Clark's condition was
slightly improved. A. J. Selsor, the
hy-stander, who was hit by a stray
"bullet, also is expected to get well.
Mary Pratt, the little 11-year-old
sister of the dead girl, displayed the
same remarkable coolness shown by
he:: leaders when questioned by the
police. She did not cry when told
of her sister's death.
Mrs. Pratt, in a statement to the
assistant prosecutor, told of the
hand's work. "Mr. and Mrs. Sharp,
our leaders," said Mrs. Pratt, "were
"known to us as Adam and Eve and
?we believed their teachings; It was
revealed to Mr. Sharp last summer
that our meetings were not to be
interfered with again. We armed
ourselves. 'If the police attempt to
arrest you, shoot,' our leader said.
They cannot kill me. I'll live for
ever.' The first I heard of the
"trouble Tuesday was when Lulu and
"Mary came running down to the boat
and told me that the shooting was
going on.
"Then the officers came and want
ed to take us away. I got my rifle
down off the wall, told Lulu to get
a gun, and we all got Into a skiff
that was tied to the houseboat. I
sat in the bow with my gun in m^
hand. I was not going to shoot un- j
less I had to, because I had no
chance to ask either Adam or Eve
what to do. I'm sorry I did not re
sist. I'm afraid I have lost my
ternal life because I think Adam
would have advised me to shoot.
"Lulu got into the back of the
skiff, which was covered, and Mary
took the oars and we started across
the river. The officers began shoot
ing at the boat. We drifted up to
the bank and when I saw blood o<>
Lulu's ear I knew she was shot.
Then Mary and I go out and hung
on the side of the boat until thev
captured us."
Mrs. Melissa Sharp, a slender wo
man of middle age, whose statement
was taken by another officer, detailed
the occurrences leading up to Tues
day's fight and then told of the
wanderings of the band.
"I was born.in Mount Grove, Mo,
3 7 years ago. on a farm," said Mrs.
Sharp. 'T married Sharp, a farme.-.
twenty years ago and we went to
Arkansas. Later, we went to Okla
homa and took up a claim. We had
no religion then. About six years
ago my husband came home one
night and said he did not think we

"He had had a revelation of the

ROOSEVELT THREATENS TO SUE
THE NEWSPAPERS.
He Says "If They Can be Reached
For Criminal Libel, I will Try m
Have Them Reached.''
Washington, Dec, 10.?"If they
can be reached for criminal ?be!.
I shall (try to have them reached"
said President Roosevelt In speaking
this afternoon about "those Ameri
cans who have been guilty of infa
mous falsehood concerning the ac
quisition of the property and th:
construction of the Panama Canal
itself."
It was to the committee of one
hundred of the Lakes-to-the-Go.f |
Deep Waterway Association, headed
by Governor Deneen, of Illinois, who
were received by the President in
the East room of the White Hous?,
that he made this declaration.
Governor Deneen had presented a
copy of resolutions adopted by the
Association, and made a few remarks
to which the President replied as
fellows':
"I have felt, as the Governor has
well put it, that no more Important
service could be rendered to this
country than the building of <.~e
Panama Canal between the Atlantic
and the Pacific, and one thing I am
proud of in connection with the
building of that canal is that there
has not been legitimate cause for
the breath of scandal connected with
any feature of +.he proceeding. We
have cause to be ashamed of only
one set of Americans who have been
guilty of infamous falsehood con
cerning the acquisition of the prop
erty and thte construction of the
canal Itself: If they can be reached
for criminal libel, I shall try to have
them reached. If not, at any rate
all the facts-we know or ever have
known are at the disposal of e&ph
and every one of you here, and ot
any one in Congress or of all Con
gress if they wish to see them.
"Next only in Importance from
physical standpoint to building the
Panama Canal comes the question of ]
developing the use of our own water- |
ways. That must be done by the
policy of irrigation at the headwa
ters up in the arid regions; and
where you come from, gentlemen, ii
is to be done by making our coast
take a big loop in from the Gulf ?.
Mexico to the Great Lakes, and we
wili see that the work is done; and
no work could have been dbne from
beginning to end more honestly]
or more efficiently."

"We have been going armed for

DRAGGED SICK YOUNG LADY
FROM HER BED
After Shooting Several Times in
Her Room?Trailed by Dogs and
Caught and Was Lost.
Valdosta, Ga., Dec. 12.?Parties
who earne r here last night from
Statenyille, In Echols county,
brought some rather meager detail
of the exciting experience which the
family of Mr. Fisher Belote had an
the hands of a negro desperado who
ran amuck during the previous night
and bolted into tne house where the
members of the family were sleep
ing.
The negro was evidently one who
had had some trouble with Mr. Be
lote and, after becoming drunk at
a negro frolic, later went to the
white man's home for trouble.
The negro first broke open the
door of his home and rushed into
the room where the wife and sick
daughter were sleeping, exclaiming:
"I want old Fisher Belote," and
firing three shots from his revolver
into the roof. Mrs. Belote, who kept
her nerve remarkably well, told the
negro that Mr.' Belote was not ?a
the room.
The negro then stumbled to the
bed where the sick daughter was
lying,, catching her by the foot and
saying: "Here he is," and at the
same time firing two shots into the
bead of the bed.
By that time, Mrs. Belote had
gotton out of the bed and secured
the rifle and was calling her. hus
band from- the adjoining room to
come and shoot the negro. A young
er son, Harper, in the meantime, ran
in with his little single-barrel gun
and fired once at the negro, but In
his excitement the shot went wild,
crashing through a bureau mirror.
The negro then left the place and
fled from the scene.
Messengers were sent to the con
vict camps at Tarver for the track
dogs and they were put on his track,
following the negro for manj* miles.
He was trailed along the Georgia
Southern road toward Valdosta, but
disappeared in Grand bay, where
the pursuers follewed him. They
were close upon his heels when they
entered the bay.
After several hours in there, the
pursuers came out without the negro.
They stated, however, that he would
not make any more midnight raids.
They did not say so, but it is the
general belief that the negro either
resisted arrest and was killed, or ho
was given a speedy courtmartial and
received the verdict of death.
The affair happened in a section
that does not believe much in bur
dening court dockets with such cas
es when the right man can hi
caught. "

Big Explosions of Dynamite in
Panama Canal Cut
Ten Laborers Are Killed and Fifty
Are Wounded by the Premature
Explosion of a Giant Blast of
Dynamite, Which Set Off Twenty
Tons Stored Near by.
Colon, Dec. 12.?A giant blast of
dynamite, already prepared for fir
ing, was prematurely exploded in the
workings at Bas Obispo today. Ten
men were killed and fifty injured.
It may be that others have beea
killed, for debris is piled up In all.
directions.
Bas Obispo cut is' about thirty
miles from Colon, and the shock of
the explosion was distinctly felt
here, as In addition to that in the
blast twenty-two tons of dynamite
was exploded. All the killed were
Spaniards except two, who were
Americans.
Numerous reports are current as
to the cause of the accident, but.
the official version from Culebra,
which gives an estimate of ten
killed and fifty wounded, states that
during the loading of the last hole
of the blast the dynamite in this
cutting was discharged and the re
maining twenty-two tones were ex
ploded by concussion.
The" holes had not been connect
ed electrically as the discharge of
the blast was set for 5 o'clock in
the afternoon. The last hole was
being loaded under the supervision
of one of the most efficient powder
men in the employe of the commis
sion.
Relief trains were sent to the
scene of the disaster and one which
returned here several hours later
brought back the report that 45
of the injured had been sent to
Ancon hospital. The officials on the
train stated that eleven dead had
been found, while many others in
the gang of a hundred and twenty
two who were employed In the cut
were missing.
It was also reported by the train
men that the explosion was due to
a passing steam shovel, which hook
ed the wire leading to the Immense
charge of dynamite. Whether or not
this was the cause of the accident, a
steam shovel and crew which hap
pened to be on the scene were prac
tically burled under the mass ot
rocks and earth thrown up.
Gangs were soon searching for
the dead and assisting the wounded.
Electric lights were sent up, and to
night steam shovels were at work
removing the tons upon tons of de
bris. Many of the men have been
Beriously injured, some. of them
probably fatally. Tradition has it
that the Panama Railroad coBt one
human life for every tie, and with
accidents, insurrections and disease
?the construction of the canal has not
gone along without exacting its toll.
There have been a number of ac
cidents in the last two years, chief
among which was the premature ex
plosion of dynamite at Pedro Miguel
in June, 1907, which resulted In the
jleath of seven men and the injury
of a hundred. ?

HAD NO RIGHT TO TEAR DOWN
BUILDING.
Col. Brownwell Claims He Cited Fact
of Lack of Authority, Roosevelt
Giving Direct Order, Anyhow.
Washington, Dec. 11.?Attention
was called today to the fact that the
utterances of the President in re
gard to the action of Congress in
limiting the use of the secret service
force is not the only action of the
executive that is considered by mem
bers as objectionable.
It became, known today that the
sub-committee of the committee on
appropriations, having in charge the
preparation of the legislative, execu
tive and judicial appropriation bill,
has been Investigating the raising
of the old Pennsylvania station that
was located on the Mall until the
President had it torn down.
That the committee failed to ex
punge Its inquiries about this action
from the printed hearings is taken
to Indicate the temper of that com
mittee toward the executive.
When Col. Bromwell, military aide
to the President, and superintendent
of public buildings and grounds, ap
peared before the committee Reprc
sentatlveBurleson, of Texas, asked
him if he had not requested an ap
propriation last year for a watch
man for the old depot.
"I think so," replied Col Brom
well, "but I have not had any oc
cation to use it, because I have torn
down the railroad station."
"What? Torn down the railroad
station!" exclaimed the Texas mem
ber.
Col. Bromwell explained that he
tore down the building on the writ
ten order from the President of the
United States.
'Do you know of any law on the
statute books that authorizes any
executive officer to sell any of the
property of the United States of
that character, real estate?" inquir
ed Chairman Tawney, of Minnesota
"No, sir," replied the President's
aide. "1 called the attention of the
higher authorities to that fact, and
I received the order to tear the
building down."
Replying further to the chairman
Col. Bromwell said that he knew of
no immediate necessity for its re
moval.
The committee also went into an
examination of the government of
ficials to ascertain what right the
commission on country life appoint
ed by the President, had to use the
franking privilege, as it claimed was
being done. Members of the com
mittee referred to the qbmmision
as "one created without authority
of law." *

MAD WITH TEDDY
Committee Will Consider Roose
velt's Criticism of
ACTION OF CONGRESS
Statements in the Annual Message
Relating to the Secret Serviec will
Receive Careful Attention and the
Committee will Recommend What
Course to Pursue.
Washington, Dec. 11.?The indig
nation of the members of the Hou?e
of Representatives over the para
graph of the President's annual
message relating to the secret ser-.
vice found expression today in a res
olution offered by Mr. Perkins, Re
publican, of New York, providing for
the appointment of a committee of
five to consider the subject and re
port what action should be taken In
connection with the matter. The
resolution was as follows:
"Whereas, there was contained in
the sundry civil appropriation bill,
which passed Congress at its last
session and became a law, a provis
ion in reference to the employment
of secret service in the treasury de
partment; and,
"Whereas, in the message of the
President of the United States to
the two houses of Congress Is was
stated in reference to that provision,
'it is not too much to say that this
amendment has been of benefit only,
and could be of benefit only to the
criminal classes,' and it was further
stated the 'chief argument in favor
of the provision was that the Con
gressmen did not themselves wish
to be investigated by secret service
men,' and it was further stated,
'but If this is not considered desir
able a special exception could be
made in the law, prohibiting the use
of the secret service force in in
vestigating members of Congress. It
would be far better to do this than
to do what actually was done, and
strive to prevent or at least to hamp
er effective action against criminals
by the executive branch of the gov
ernment.' Now, therefore, be it
