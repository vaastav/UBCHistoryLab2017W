ROME, Dee. 1. Thousands of demon
strator friendly to France and of antl-
Vatlcan tendencies gathered tonight in tne
piazza, adjoining the Faranese pelade, the
seat of the French embassy. In an endeavor
, to express their pleasure at France
ctton toward the church.
The whole garrison a Rome was era
ployed to fsce the demonstrators and pro
tect the Vatican, which Is surrounded by
cuvalry, and the bridges leading to the
apostolic palace are barred by troops. All
the streets leading to the Palace Faraneso
are protected by soldiers with fixed bay
onets. The demonstrators, led by a dosen radical
socialists and republican members of the
Chamber of Deputies, Including Prince Bor
gherem, after vainly attempting to break
the cordon, provided themselves with
caudles and, formed Into a mock proces
sion, Intoning the "Mlscre" as an Indica
tion of the death of clericalism, amidst
cries of "Long live France!" "Long live
Clemenceau!" and "Down with the Vati
can!" Deputies Costa and De Felloe tried to
harangue the people, but the police In
terfered. The demonstration occurred near the
monument to Giordano Bruno, the monk
philosopher, who was burned alive, a vic
tim of religious Intolerance.
Deputy Costa finally made himself heard.
He said:
"Before this monument to Bruno, of free
thought, let us send our applause . to
France for this great fceople continuing the
traditional obstinate struggle hgainst the
moth eaten clericalism."
Fresh attempts were then made to beat
back the cordon and the cavalry charged
the ' demonstrators, a few of whom were
l slightly Injured and several were arrested.
Amld roars and shouts and the singing of
the "Marseillaise' the ferment continued
until late In the evening.
A commission of the demonstrators was
' received by M. Barrer., the French ambas
sador, who expressed his appreciation for
the ayrapmirfy t. tee Soman people.
The government endeavored by all means
to prevent the demonstration. The stand
that the government Is taking Is that al
though Italy la friendly to France, It does
not wish to take sides In the dispute, espe
cially when Its relations with the 'church
are better now than they have been since
1K70.
America Pope's Consolation.
Pope Plus today received In private audi
ence Mrs. Daniel Lament and h -r
daughters. They were presented by Mgr.
Kennedy, rector of the American college.
To them the pope exclaimed: "My greatest
consolation now comes from America."
According to reports here the Spanish
government has signified Its displeasure to
MarquH OJeda, the Spanish ambassador
accredited to the Vatican, for his action in
communicating with the Spanish ambes-

the nunciature there, which Is considered aa
compromising the neutrality that Madrid
desires to maintain In the conflict between
France and the Vatican. It Is expected
here that Marquis OJeda will be recalled,
Pope, Plus today had a long conference
with Cardinal Ferratla, the formor papal
nuncio at Paris, to whom he expressed deep
regret at the position Of Cardinal Richard
who is threatened with expulsion, saying:
"Theyare using altogether unnecessary vio
lence against a nonogenatian."

Farley Discusses Isaacs.
NEW TORK, Dec. It Archbishop John
M. Farley of New York today gave out th
following statement on the church and s'ato
controversy In France:
Here In America, where there Is no at
tempt mad by th state to Interfere with
the various religious denominations, the
people at largo are naturally disposed to
condemn clergymen who by declining to
comply with the behests of the govern
ment expose themselves to a charge of re
bellion against the authorities of the land
But In order to understand the refusal
of the Roman Catholic clergy of Franc
to fultill the requirements of the new law
of separation, it must be explained that
the provisions of the statute in question
demand the consent of the church and of
Its mlniatcis to the alienation of all the
property that has been bequeathed and
donated, to be held In trust for rellglou
and philanthropic purposes. It 1 property
which they do not derive from the govern
ment, but from the munificence f the
pious and of which they are merely 'he
trustees.
The situation created by th new law of
sejiaratton. which is t tin cause of the pres
ent crista In France, is as if, for instance,
the legialHtura of New York were to enact
laws compelling the truates of the Trinity
church corporation, under th penalty of
connaoailon. to g!v their consent to the
alienation of ail Its vnt pnerty to other
uses man rrioae lor wmcn It was intended
and to transfur Ha administration and con-
trol to people who n.lsiit either beluns to
rival denominations ur even profets athe
ism. It is as if the legislature ot New
York were to enact a statute requiring th
Cstho'lc church, under the penalty ft run-flst-atlon
of its property of on kind or
another, to consent to the transfer of tho
management and control of Ita sacred
edifices, seminaries, rectories, hospitals,
protectories and other educational and
charltabl limitation to asoclatton In
which nut merely avowed foes of Catholi
cism among the Protestant denominations, j
but also agnostic and scheming politicians.

HOUSE HAS MUCH WoriK LAID OUT FOR IT
Honee? flea Dlatrlct of Colombia a ad
Indian RHIa on Calendar aad
Senate Has' Deficiency
Hill.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 16.-Both houses of
"ren win aajourn on inurwir ior
Christma. holiday unless the senate
uiu tnajige wie program auopieu i, i..
house, which Is not probable. The reso-
'ull adjournment, wnicn was aem
over by the house, has not been taken up
in the senate, but It probably will receive
a mention there tomorrow. A meeting of
the senate committee on appropriations has
been called for tomorrow morning and
there Is little doubt that the resolution will
be reported back and acted upon by the
senate early in the day. The house reso
lution calls for the reconvening of the two
bodies Thursday, January 3. There Is some
disposition In the senate to extend the
time until the following Monday, but It
does not appear probable that this mill be
dune.
The house has laid out a somewhat ex
tended prop-ram for the time before the
lioitday adjournment, but little attention
has been given to any arrangement of
business for the senate. In the house Mon
day will be devoted te the consideration of
bills under an order providing for the sus-
pension of the rules and the rest of the
week win be given to legislation pertaining
to the District of Columbia and to the
bill making appropriations for the conduct
of Indian affairs. There are twenty or
thirty hills on the district calendar, which
Mr. Babcock, chairman of the district com
mittee, is very anxious to have passed, and
the committee on rules has promised him
sufficient time for their consideration.
There will also be a strenuous effort to
secure action on the Indian appropriation
bill and Chairman Sherman of the Indian
committee is hopeful of success. If there
should be time left the omnibus claims
bill will be taken up. 1
Deflrlency BUI la Senate.
The urgent deficiency appropriation bill,
which passed the house Saturday, is ex
pected to receive the sanction of the sen
ate before the holiday adjournment. It
will be sent to committee on Its receipt by
the senate Monday and a prompt reotu is
expected. The provision In the bill looking
to the carrying Into effect of th pure food
law Is regarded by both the senate and
the house as really urgent and It la not
only expected that the senate will pass it,
but that It will dispose of It early enough
In the week to return It to the house In
time to permit that body to take action
before the adjournment on Thursday on
any amendments which the senate may
make.
It la possible that the provision In the
deficiency bill to meet the expenses of the
intervention of this country In Cubs will
provok some debate, but otherwise the
bill Is expected t pass after very brief
consideration.
There is also a possibility of speeches by
Senators Klttredge and Flint on their re
spective resolutions providing for an In
vestigation of the Lumber trust and an
inquiry into the Japa'nese situation, but
while It Is known thnt while both senators
are preparing to discuss their resolutions
it seems possible that they will postpone
their remarks until after tho holidays. ' In
deed, there Is a general disposition In the
senate to defer any further consideration
of Important questions until January. Tho
Smoot question, the negro troops question
i un1 a11 other general lglslatlon. with the
exceptions noted, will thus be postponed.
Much Interest attaches In both' houses to
the various presidential messages which
It Is understood will be sent to congress
-during the week. The Fanaina message,
detailing the president's observations on his
recent visit to the canal sone and outlining
his recommendations concerning the work
there, Is expected today, but for the present
will receive no attention beyond its formal
reading. The same may be said of the
four or five other communications which
the president has promised for the week.
The trial of the McAndrews & Forbes
company of New York and the J. S. Youn
Tobacco company of Baltimore, both sub
sidiaries of the American Tobacco com
pany, and both charged wtlh violating the
Sherman anti-trust law In restraint ot
trade, will be begun In the United States
court In New York next Tuesday. It Is
alleged that the two companies controlled
the output of licorice paste, used In making
plug tobacco, aad that under an agreement
they divided the trade between them, forc
ing prices up exorbitantly.

KAIIMKR'8 HOGS M YSTEniOl SLY DIE
Skunk Who Kat of the Carcasses
Also Die.
CALLAWAY. Neb., Dec. 16. (Special.)
E. S. Woodruff, one of the most substan
tial farmers and stockmen residing south
west of this city, has had the misfor
tune to lose about 160 head of hogs the last
tew weeks from a peculiar disease. A
,ew week a the animals commenced
dying off, and although everything was
done that could be thought of to keep
them from dying, about 150 of them were
hauled out and buried before the disease
was gotten under control. During the
cold snap of a few week ago some of the
dead animals were hauled out and left
lying on the prairie until the weither mod
erated so that they could be buried. After
th weather warmed up Mr. Woodruff
went out to bury the dead, and upon reach
ing the plac was surprised to find fifteen
dead skunks lying within a few feet from
where they had been eating the carcasses
of the dead hogs, and the question now
arises, what did the hogs die with that
the flesh should be o poisonous to the
skunks?
Mr. Woodruff states that he was sure
at all times that the hogs did not die from
the effects of cholera, but that It had the
appeurance of being a kind of lung trouble,

CHANGES IN BRITISH CABINET
J. K. Kills, Parliamentary Secretary
to the Indian Office, to Step
Down and Oat.
LONDON, Dec. 17.-The first of the Im
pending changes In the cabinet to be an
nounced Is the resignation of J. K. Kl.is,
I'ariiamentai y eecietary to the Ino.an
other. He Is leaving on account of ill
health and Is going abroad to recuperate.
It Is understood Walter Runcmnn, Parlia
mentary secretary to the local government
board, will succeed him.
Nothing is definitely known conce.ninjc
other changes, but It is stated that Ihe
marquis of Hlpon, lord Tiivy seal, and Sir
II. Fowler, chuncellor of tho duchy of Lan
caster, will resign, and It Is rumoted that
Herbert Glauaiotie will leave the Home
office. Sir lleiuy Campbell BanneriiVAn,
however, acci rdinx to the latest p.illtli.ai
gossip has deciued to remain In the House
of Commons in view of a liberal atta k t. at
Is about to bo made on the upper home.
Everything, however, appears to hinge on
James Biyce's acceptance of the post of
ambassador to the United States.
The British ptess is now beginning to re
gard Mr. Bryee'B acceptance as a forgone
conclusion. The Tribune today, ref erring to
the subject, points out that the post of
ambassador to Washington might easily be
come the most exalted In the diplomatic
service, despite contentions to the con
trary. Tho paper adds that the possib.l.ty
of Mr. Bryce's acceptance Pf the post meets
with general approval both In England and
In the United States.
"President Roosevelt, It Is aid," the
Tribune continue, "has allowed it to be
known that he would cordially welcome Mr.
Bryce's appointment. On this side of the
Atlantic It Is recognized that a post so
attractive, influential and distinguished
would be a fitting climax to Mr. Bryee'a
long public career."
Among tho notatfle rumors concerning
cabinet changes Is one pointing to John
Burns for promotion. He Is even named as
the successor of Mr. Bryce as chief secre
tary for Ireland. In any case he has been
so successful In his present place as pres
ident of the local government board that he
Is regarded as In no way unlikIy to be pro
moted. BANISHMENT ALL FOR KEPLER
Authorities Unable to Connect Hi in
vrltb the Death of HI
Wife.
SHFRIDAN. Wyo.. Dec. 18. (8neclal.)
Followlng a clue by which the Sheridan
authorities hoped to convict W. J. Kepler
for the willful murder of his wife here
In November, the fruitless effort ended to
day by Kepler's appearance before the
police Judge, who assessed a heavy fine for
a trumped up charge and suspended pay
ment on condition that the man leave town
within six hours, never to return.
Kepler was the alleged husband of Josie,
daughter of Joel J. Hurt of Omaha. On
the night of October 30 physicians found
the woman writhing In the agonies of
death from a doso of chloroform supposed
to have been self-admlnlstered. She left
a note explaining her act as voluntary.
Similarity of the handwriting In the note
left by the dead woman and that of a
lewd woman with whom Kepler is said to
have been associating since his wife's
death served to confirm general opinion
that the man may have known more of
the tragedy than he divulged.
Kepler left Sheridan on a freight train
within an hour after sentence was pro
nounced. RAILROAD SURVEYORS BUSY

Line West Toward

8HOSHONI, Wyo., Dec. 16. (Special.)
Authoritative Information has been given
out here that Chief Engineer Haines of t!i
Northwestern railroad has been ordered
Into the field with a large party of sur-
veyors to run a line west from this point
on an extension to the Pacific coast.
The party will be the largest which has
ever been sent out on a railroad survey
and have order to push the work forward
as rapidly as possible. This action on the
part of the Northwestern Is inspired by
1 the building of the Western Pacific from
f Salt Lake to the coast, as well a the ex
i tension of the Milwaukee & St. Paul, which
j ha already commenced work on Its ex
i tension Into the northwest territory.

PAPERS COMPLIMEuTtD FOR FAIRNESS
Before the Close of the KvenlnaT
Meetlnar It I Announced That the
Money to Pay All Expenses
Had Been Collected.
With the Inaplring strains of that solemn
hymn, "God lie With You Till We Meet
Again," voicing the sentiments of thou
sands of persons, the Torrey mission wa
brought to a close with n big meeting for
men in the Auditorium Sunday evening.
It was a day of big meetings. The Audi
torium was crowded with women In the
afternoon and loti arose nnd signified their
ntentlon to lead a Christian lifo. Before
his sermon at this meeting Dr. Torrey
answered a question sent him by a woman
who said she was a member of the Episco
pal church. She stated that she undr-
stood that he had declared that no one
could dance und play cards and go to
iven. She stated thnt she was an at
tendant of the Episcopal church, and that
her church lelleved that these things could
be Indulged In by Christians. Dr. Torrey
said he had never declared thnt playing
cards and dancing were a sure bar to
heaven, but only that when Christians did
these things the Influence on others was
bad.
The Lyric theater was crowded In the
afternoon with men, to whom Rev. Mr.
Jacoby delivered a powerful sermon, nn a
result of which twenty men signified thefr
desire to lead the Christian life.
'This Is an age when people demand to
be convinced." said Rev. Mr. Jacoby. "A
man said to me that he would believe ln
Jesus If he could see Him walk on the
water as He did In the ,1 v old. But
he wouldn't. He would I t" And som"-
thlng on His feet that kept lum from sink
ing.
The worldly life has pleasures. It I
no use to tell men that It ha not. I know.
I hnd pleasure IA that life,- pleasure of a
certain kind, but I want to tell you that
I hnd more real Joy ln one minute of my
Christian life than In all the years I spent
In sin.
"The foundation of the Christian life Is
faith. One must simply take God' word
and believe It. Now, if a man come to me
and wants to know the way of life, admits
that he Is a sinner and believe that Christ
died for him. then I point, out to tolrn God
promises, and' be cilia on God f5rsalvm-
tiort, do you think that when he come to
the gates of heaven God will turn him
away? No. He will not. That man Has,
to the beat of his knowledge, compiled with
the conditions which God has laid down In
the Bible and his salvation is sure."
The women's meeting last evening was
held In the First Presbyterian church,
where Miss Parker addressed a crowded
house. .
Biggest Meeting: of Series.
The Auditorium was flllcd with men In
the evening and there was a rousing meet
ing which resulted ln the largest number
of conversions secured nt nny single meet
ing. 103 coming forward and promising to
begin the Christian life. The choir over
flowed the seats provided for It upon the
platform and 260 were seated In the nelgh
Borlng galleries. Several band of singer
went about the streets and Into ome of
the hotels before the meeting, singing and
distributing circulars.
When Rev. J. Randolph . Smith, In an
nouncing tho collection, said that th
women at the afternoon meeting had con
tributed more than tw there was a ripple
of applause. He stated that practically all
of the $7,000 which the mission hae cost
has been raised. On Fridny the comrnlttea
found It needed $1,150. The collection Fri
day evening was $400. This, with the money
received Sunday afternoon and evening;
was sufne'tent to make up the sum needed
to pay all bills.
Rev. Mr. Smith also spoke words of com
mendation for Dr. Torrey and his assist
ants. The work of the newspapers of Omaha In
the mission was commended moat warmly
by Dr. Torrey before he preached.
"We owe much of the success of these
meetings to the two morning newspaper
of Omaha," said Dr. Torrey. "I don't know
of a word that lias appeared In either of
these papers that has not been a help to
our mission. The same Is true of the even
ing editions of these papers."
He also commended the faithful atten
tion and co-operation of the ministers of
the city ln the work.
Now Is the Accepted Tim.
"Today and Tomorrow" was the subject
of Dr. Torrey concluding sermon. He
took as hla text two verse of the Bible,
"The Holy Ghost saith today," and "Boasl
not theyself of tomorrow."
"Today Is the wise man's day," said Dr.
Torrey; "Tomorrow Is the fool's day. There
Is no greater secret of success than to do
a thing as quickly as It Is seen. Those
who fall in business or politics are those
who procrastinate. It is the same in things
ettrnal. There are thousands of people in
Om-iha who Intend to liecoine Christians
some day, but they are putting It off.
"Even people who are of the world know
that Christians have a Joy of which they
know nothing. Why go without th! Joy
when you may have It now?
"The sooner a man accepts Christ, the
sooner he escapes the wretchedness of a
worldly life, the torture of the conscious
ness that he la unsaved, the punishment
of moral bondage, whether it be intem
perance, Impurity or any of the other sins
of the worldly. The man who come to
Christ escis the dread of death which
constantly pursuts those In the world. All
must think of death every day, It Is present
In everything. The shadow of death falls
tight athwart our gayest pleasures. But
there is no fear of death to the Christian.
Christ has taken away death and brought
In its place life snd Immortality.
"By coming to Christ a man escape tha
dread of future Judgment. He may try to
laugh away the thought of the dread day,
but down ln his heart he has the fear of
the Judgment.
L 'The sooner a man acspt. Christ, th
more he can do for Him. A man who
claim, to be a Christian and does not try
to spread the Joys of his religion, la not
a true Christian.
"A man's eternity will be richer If ha
1 saved early. W. ar saved by falta,
t
