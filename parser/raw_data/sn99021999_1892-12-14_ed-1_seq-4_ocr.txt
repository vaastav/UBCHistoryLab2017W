It In probable that the ropubllennn
will rolalu control of th" United Slntoa
ir > niito hut the democrat * will spare no
effort to prevent this and to thnt end
: ire making a most determined fight to
control the legislatures of Montana ,
Wyoming , North Dakota , Idaho and
California. The democratic national
commit too hni taken n hand in the mat *
tcr and will provide both Influence and
monov In order to capture the legis
latures of thcso BtntCd. There waaji
gathering of democratic loaders In No\v
York last Saturday with particular re
ference to this conical , and It is under

to reopen the dotnoorntlo hsadquarters
If It should bo doomed necessary to glvo
proper support to the democrats In the
states whore there Is u conlllut. Mean
time tbo republicans in thu states named
are active and dolormlnod to maintain
tholr riffhtH by ovary lawful moans at
their command ,
Tlio greatest interest centers upon
Wyoming and fnntlum , and It must bo
confessed that the situation in these
stntes is seriously complicated. The
claim thnt the legislature of the former
s'ntn ' is republican on a fair and square
vole 6coii8 | to bo well founded , but It
cannot bo said that thcro Is no ground
for controversy. The domouratlc posi
tion there has bron weakened by the
usurping action of Osborno , the candi
date of that party for governo'1 nt
the last election , and which the
party of course endorses. The In
stallation of a governor-elect should
take place in January , butOaborno took
possession of the olllcc in the state hntiso
by force and Issued a proclamation as
governor , his purpose being to control
the action of the canvassing board.
This proceeding illustrates the desper
ate determination of tlio democracy of
that state. In Montana the contest
rests upon the fact that the democratic
canvassers throw out one district on tlio
ground of alleged bribery of voters ,
action which It is claimed
they had no right whatever to lake.
Tlio courts have been appealed to , but
hero ngain there Is a conllict regarding
jurisdiction. As to North Dakota the
republicans claim n. safe majority on
joint ballot. The democratic managers
are also taking an interest in the Kan
sas and Nebraska legislatures , though it
is comparatively slight. The fact
that n democratic national ad
ministration is coming into power
gives the democracy an advantage
whore legislators may bo bought. It is
charged that republican mombors-oloct
of the North Dakota legislature have
been olTered olllces under Cleveland if
hey would desert their party , and it is
iy no moans improbable that this has
icon or will bo tried elsewhere. It is
) ossible , also , that it will not ovory-
vhoro bo unsuccessful. At any rate the
omocrats will stop at nothing that
iromiscs to give them control of the
United States senate after March 4 next.

A communication from the Chamber
of Commerce of Duluth to the Board ol
Trade of Omaha has "been referred tc
ho transportation committee of the
alter organization. It relates to the
dcop water convention soon to bo hold
n Washington at the call of the Du-
uth Chamber of Commerce , and asks
the co-operation of Omaha.
The thought may occur to some thai
Duluth is a small city to swing so largo an
enterprise , but it is to be remembered
hat it is a great grain-shipping point ,
and furthermore that Duluth does nol
iroposo to manage the undertaking
ilone. It is expected that a general in

tanco.
The question of the cheap transpor

of the utmost importance. II is nov

in which state the in to rest in Iho null

posed dcop water convention Iho project

increasing public Interest in it am
reaching some conclusion as to the bo *
methods to bo employed to carry it out
It is eminently proper that Omnh

possible encouragement. Few subject

Under Iho laws of Nebraska fnilin
debtors nro not allowed to prefer orei
itoi'H , but by a skillful use ofitho ehalU
mortgage liiis wise provision of the 1m
is rendered migalory. Instead of mnli
ing an nssiiriiment and selling out th
names of creditors preferred , the hanli
rupt now makes chattel mortgage
to his preferred cieditors an
thus Iho unforluimlos .who ar
not favored are cheated ou
of Ihoir dues onliroly. It may bo in
possflilo to duviso r. bankrupt law whic
fhall bo ontlrnly equitable until congro !
shall adopt a measure providing for un
form collection laxvs and the sever ;
Btntos shall approve it. But thuro shoul
ho some action tnkon at the coming se
slon of Iho Nebraska leglslaluro 1
strengthen Iho rights of creditors m :
prevent fraud.
One of the malingers of ono of tl
mercantile agencies In his weekly r
view of the trade culls attention to tl
frauds recently perpetrated in this cil
by falling concerns which have pr
ferrcd relatives in their chattel mor
gages and defrauded their Icgillma
merchandise , creditors in a shnuiof
manner. In one instance the dobti
gives u bill of gale , takes u clmtt
mortgage brick nntl nnslgna U to his
wife. Jn another the father rocolvos a
chattel mortgage for enough loshut out
all ether claimants. In a third enso ,
after taking oaro of the bank two rola-
tlvo become the hanollclartos and noth
ing whatever Is left to others , In two
cnsos brothers are glvon an ndv.xntago
over all others , and In a very recent
ciso every cent in sight Is undo over lo
sister.- " , uncles and brothers-in-law , and
not a single merchandise creditor is
protected.
Within eighteen months Omaha has
scon Hourly a round dozen of as rotten
failures as over disgraced a business
community. Out in the state the eatno
styles of fr.uid have boon prevalent. It
Is time for law makers to abandon the
old theory , which was perhaps excusable -
able when Iho state was young , that Iho
debtor must bo given every chance to
escape his obligations and the creditor
bo treated as a monster with no rights
debtors are bound to respect. The laws
should bo amended so that , while they
protected debtors from the avarleo of
creditors , they do not afford so many
opportunities for rank fraud and con-
scioncolcss disregard of sacred business
obligations ,
irmr/i KLIMKX-V : invo
On the question of revising the larllT
there is a radical element In the demo
cratic party which demands that the
protective policy shall bo swept away ,
and there U a conservative clement
which advocates a' modornto course ,
preserving something of the principle )
of protection. It Is a question at tins
lime , and a very important ono , aa to
which of these elements will control Iho
course of tlio part.y. The indications are
that the struggle for mnstnry between
them will bo a very earnest and vigor
ous ono. The intimations of this have
already appeared , and nowhere more
forcefully than at the Reform club ban
quet last wool : in Now York , where
Mr. Cleveland spoke and a number ol
prominent democrats discussed the
tariff , and where Hpoakor Crisp was de
liberately snubbed.
Among those who epoko on this occa
sion was Congressman Johnson of Ohio ,
a pronounced frco trader and ad
vocate of Iho single tax theory.
Portions of his ronnrks were very
significant. Uo declared that what the
masses demand of the democratic party
Is that it shall confirm practice to pro
fession that its action shall bo as rad
ical as its platform. It is not the people
ple , said Johnson , but the loaders-who
eed education on the tariff question ,
nd he threw down liio gaunllol of the
ilcmont ho represents in this doclara-
ion : "What a congress can do is con-
roiled by its organization. The will of
ho people will be thwarted and the
ext congress paralyzed if wo again pul
r.ilf-hcarlcd men In the load. The man
.vliom the democratic party has to four
n its councils is the sugar-coated pro-
.ectionist. " Others who addressed Iho
2lub were less outspoken than the Ohio
congressman , but Senator Mills said it
ivns the duty of Ihc democratic party to
show tlio people that It was sincere
ivhen it said "taxes should not bo 16vied
'or the purpose of protecting anybody
igninst competition , " which of course
meant that the protection principle
hould be abandoned. Unquestionably
the element of the democracy which
akes this position is logict'.lly
n accord with the platform of the
> arty. That declared proteclion to bo
i fraud nrd n robbery and a policy
maintained without constilulionnl au-
thority. Democrats like Seimlor Mills
ind Congressman Johnson , who believe
that the verdict of tlio people in Novem
ber was an approval of this position ,
: iow simply demand that -tho party
shall bo faithful to its platform ultcr-
: mce , and in this they show moro
honesty nnd courage , if loss discretion ,
than the conservatives. The probability
is , however , that the latter will control
the course of tlio party. This is in
ferred from tbo public utterances of Mr.
Cleveland , who has not shown any sym
pathy with the tariff extremists of his
party. Tlio president-elect luis on every
occasion since tbo election manifested ti
full sense of the responsibility which
success has devolved upon his party ,
Uo said in his latesl utterance that Ihe
mission of Iho democracy does not
involve a destructive discrimina
tion between American interests , and
it is a reasonable conclusion from all
that ho has said Unit ho does nol intend
to permit the party to go to any such
length in dealing with the tariff ns il
would bo carried by a logical compliance
with its platform. And it is not to b (
doubted that the policy which Mr.
Cleveland shall formulate for the partj
will DO acccpled by it.
TIIK fourth statislical report of tin

tlio importance of legislation compelling

TIIK hue and cl'y that has recently
boon raised by the governor of Nevada
about the recent llielino ot the mlulng
Industries In thq Sljvor stale Is a down
right ImposuraTho state of Nevada
has boon on the decline for the last
twenty years. Nevada had Ii0,000 popu
lation when she waa admitted Into the
union In 1801. By 189U hoc population
had dwindled down to10,000 , and Iho
great governor of Nevada governs fewer
pcopto limn the mayors ol Irtlf a dozen
Iowa towns. The silver mines of Nevada
wore nearly all exploited when Hie
Comstock mines were found lo bo
worked out when the Floods and the
Miickays had packed up their millions
and left the \\oov \ miners to scratch
gravel for themselves. The besl proof
that Iho rcconl decline in Iho price of
silver hns not dopopulnlod Nevada is
UK-fact that the silver mines in Mon
tana and Colorado tire yielding enor
mous profits In spite of the low price of
silver and an enormously increased pro
duction.
IK SlJN'ATOR TUI.LBK Voices tllO views
of Iho silver men Ihe act requiring the
purchase of1,500,1)01) ) ) ounces of silver
monthly will not bo repealed by the
present congress. The Colorado sena
tor ways that the repaal of tlio law

of silver nnd It will bo opposed by the
fi'iends of that metal until something
better for silver shall bo offered them.
The outlook for the advocates of Iho
frco and unlimited coinage ot silver is
justnt present extremely discouraging
and 11 doaa not scorn likely to improve
within the next four yours.
BISHOP SII.VNLKV of the Catholic
church in North Dalcota declares that
prohibition in that stito is a farce ,
which is really no news. "I assort , " ho
says , "that 'prohibition is a flat failure
in North Dakota. If the people want
prohibition lot them insist upon its en
forcement ; if they do nol want it lot
them have the courage to say so and do
away with it , and in It3 place give us
some means of regulating the trnlllc in

TIIK statement made by Chancellor
Caprivi lo Iho Rolclislag as to the posi

St. Paul Olobe : With the annexation of
Canada our American capital would llnd a
broader Held for operations ; the great Can
adian northwest would afford a wealth of
mine and soil for our development. The
advantages we would gain bv annexation
are so apparent that it seems useless to call
attention to any feature of them. The ad
vantages Canada would derive by it are
inestimable. Everything the country would
ho lo us il would be to thojn. and in addition
they would soon be relieved of the burden of
their enormous debt. The United States
might hesitate to assume their debt ; but
should that country become a part of the
republic , the rapid inllow of people induced
by the union would diminish the per capita
rate of the debt , and the bunion would soon
bo wiped out of existence. At any rate , wo
should be ono people from lhe < ! ulf of Mexico

Thu TximUm dispatch announcing tliat the
Continental Steamship association would.
after New Yew , carry only saloon nnd second
cabin passengers together with tlio com
ments of tlio agents of the various lines
which are member * of this assoelation. ejiused
no little indignation among members of con
gress today. The action of tills association , of
which very few people not engaged in the
bringing of paupers at so much per head
nto the t'nlted States had ever heard of , i
ecoptod here as being a kind of incorporated
ilackmall upon the government of this coun-
ry. Congressman stump , who is chairman
f the immigration committee In the house ,
aid today thnt the Immigration committees
f both branches of congress would hold
olnt sessions tomorrow and Friday and that
he representatives of th > 3 steamship compa-
ilci engaged in the Immigrant trade had
icon invited to appear before the committees
t their Friday mooting.
As for tlio threat of the Continental
Bteamship association , ho dismissed it as
die "blulf" to which the committees in both
irancnes of eongi-css wntiul pay no heed.
V s iniltir threat , hu s.iid , had been made
some time ago by the companies thnt they
votlld dhor , their trade to Canada. lie
ould say lint there was a determination to
vstrlet if nol totally to suspend immigration
n spite of all the opposition of the steam
ship companies.
TH Itchtrlct ImmlKr.illmi.
Senator Chandler today introduce ! his bill
luthori/.ing the president to suspend himil-
jration at his discretion. The Imini-
trallon bill now upon the speaker's
able in the house aims simply to eu-
'oii'o a rigid Inspection of intending
mmlgrants at the port of debarkation liv
the captain and n surgeon of the steamer ,
who must then make aftldnvils before the
American consul at that purl that there are
m board no objectionable immigrants. Mr.
Stump thinks that the immigrant commit
tees will so amend this bill that when it is
ml on its llmil passage it will prohibit imiui-
rration. Senator Chandler does not fear an
nvaslon of immigrants by way of Canada ,
uir lines ho look for any serious objection
from European countries to prohibitory im
migration laws.
Measures are now pending in several
European legislatures restricting immigra
tion of Iho better classes to the United
States , and Senator Chandler thinks that
the efforts of this country to prohibit the
lopavturo of their subjects will bo heartily
fa.vored by the Kuropc.au governments. Dur
ing its investigation tlio senate immigration
ommitteo learned that Canada would
Heartily welcome such laws since the statis
tics of the Dominion show that all the immi
grants whom Canada could induce to settleon
tier lands remained hardly six months in
Canada before they crossed the border into
the northwestern states , and that , in spite
of the most liberal immigration laws , the
result of all ( inducements to foreigners was
almost nothing. As for the threat of the
steamship companies to divert immigrant
traUle to Canadian points Senator Chandler
is assured that in such a ease the Canadian
inivernmunt will impose ciuarantino regula
tions and take other sanitary precautions
against cholera quito as effective as these
which the steamship companies now seek to
evade.

Harris-oil's Vein.
Tomorrow will witness the interesting
event ot'n republican senate acting upon the
veto of a republican president. Pi-esident
Harrison's having returning without his ap
proval the famous McGarrahan claim , it will
be called up at l'JHO. : and it is the conll-
dent prediction of McGarrahan and his
friends that the necosssury two-thirds
of the senate will vote in favor of the reso
lution and that the bill will become a law
notwithstanding the president's objection.
They base their conlldcnco upon the fact
that the bill passed the senate by a practi
cally unanimous vote and that therefore
there will bo fifty-nine senators who will
again vote in its favor. The democratic
liouso they add will have much pleasure in
gassing the bill over a republican executive's
veto. Should the bill bo passed over the
veto it will bo the lirst instance of the kind
during President Harrison's administration.
The president has not hesitated to with
hold his approval of other measures. So far
ho has sent in fifteen vetoes. Among thorn
was the bill creating the new circuit court
of appeals , which bo vetoed because of its
defective legal construction. The bill was
tbo work of Senator Kvarts , who was much
disgruntled to learn from the president's
message that the bill as drawn by him
would practically have wiped out tlio supreme
premo court of the United States. As reintroduced -
troduced , with the objectionable features
corrected , the hill passed , and ns a number
of other bills which President Harrison
vetoed simply because of their legal faults
was approved by him when corrected. The
other bills which did not admit of modltica-
lloii were reform ! to HIP committee from
which thcj ciimo nnd were never hoard of
again.
