Ingtlm condition nf tlie country and Its
onus of icrvV'e, and nmfclng; such stmirri
tions at the executive ol the country think
congress should attend to. The inesuKe,
theoretically, li valuable as RllimlinR tlie
lcirlslatori authentic information ns to the
state of allilrs In thu country generally, so
that they may know better how to uct. In
fact, the chief Interest in the document den
tors in the president's views on public qtl"t
tions as contained in his recommendations.
So prosperous nro the United Stnles at
present that the president, In tho nicssape
Bent in yesterday, congratulates the peo
ple warmly upon the fact. He then dwells
upon our relations to other nations. Wo
are at peace with every peoplo and sustain
with them the most cordial re
lations. In our dealings with Great
llritain, France, Germany, Russia,
Stilly, and in fact all the
countries, hut Spain, and possibly Turkey,
' any requests made by us lately have been
at once complied with, and courtesies have
been cheerfully and mutually extended.
With reference to Spain the president com
plains that our demands upon her In most
instances have not been met with a disposi
tion to accede as promptly and cheerfully
thereto as ought to have been, and
speaks of the heavy fines imposed
in Spanish ports upon American
vessels and the excessive tees charged upon
American importations. He details the
fact that Germany has invited us to one or
her exhibitions in '83 and asks that provision
be made to comply with tho request; that
Italy has been very profuse in its expres
sions of regret over the death of Minister
Marsh; that the scope of the extradition
treaty with Belgium has been enlarged; that
tha Swiss government lias ceaseu
to cive countenance to tho ship
ment .of its paupers and criminals
to America; recommends' the continu
ance with modifications of the reciprocity
treat v with the 8ndwich Islands, and
dwells upon the part played by our state
department with reference to tho Llnli
Teruvian troubles. In commenting on
foreign affairs, the president shows th.it he
baa the correct American idea of letting
other people's business alone, and is very
moderate. In view of the growing disposi
tion among the nations to settlo important
questions by conference and arbi
tration, he very sensibly sug
gests that greater powers should
be conferred upon the president with refer
- enca to the appointment of delegates to
those international conventions. There is
no special foreign policy indicated by Mn.
Aetudb's remarks on our foreign relations,
nor nothing new or startling to tell. As to
home affairs, be dwells at length and sta
tistically upon the financial and industrial
condition of the Union. The show
ing throughout is an admirable
one, and denotes that within,
our affairs - are as prosperous
and as satisfactory as aro our relations with
the outside world. Upon the great subject
of interest now in America, the revision or
abolition of the tarifr, the president is just
where his party stands, lie wants the in
ternal revenue taxes reduced, but by the
obolitionof the tax on articles other than
whisky and tobacco. In this respect ho
and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
stand upon the same platfoam. Tho
president unfortunitcly oilers tho coun
try no new views, no startling sug
gestions, no broad and progressive
statesmanship in his treatment of the tariff
or financial problems of the government.
He thir.ks with his party that there should
be protection, but that our present system
needs corrections to the extent of equaliz
iag duties and taxation. With reference
to tlm war and navy departments he is
in accord with the secretaries of those
arms, and approves of the recommenda
tions made bv tbem in their reports. He
thinks, of course, that the bill passed
throngh the influence of Jlongeow Bnd
K ei rim, by t.ie last session of congress, for
the Improvement of old and construction
ol Dew vessels is calculated to put that
arm of defence on a substantial footing,
and proceeds to moxe suggestions as to tne
merchant marine, whose decadence he
laments. He very rightly and sensibly ap
proves of a more thorough system
ot coast' defences. In his remarks about
the post-office department the president
tpVes itmns and nnder Hie latest, develop,
merit's, 'T sensible and proper grounds
for the reduction of postage. We have cer
tainly reached that point where this depart
ment can be run more economically and
with less cost to the people. rswiPtxT

THE TOSTAL DEPARTMENT,
The report of the postmastor-general
gives evidence of the satiafaciory condition
of that department and contains many val
uable dita and accompanying suggestions
which cannot fail to be of interest, the in
formation that it affords, that tho receipts
fur the liscal year have ex
pu.fli.H iho exnenditures, must be
ln Ilia nlitturVitt llin
nbilit-vof changing the present basis for
fixing salaries mid ullowauces, of extending
the monev-order system, of enlarging the
lunctions'of tlie postal establishnieiils, to
place under its control the telegraph sys
tem of tho country, though from this last
and most important recommeudution I
must withhold my concurrence.
At the last session of congress several
bills were introduced into the house of rep
resentatives fur t he reduction of letter post
ace to the rate of two cents per half-ounce.
I have given much study and reflection to
this, and am thoroughly convinced that
such action would be ior the beat interests
of the public. It has been the policy ot the
government from its foundation to
defray as far as possible the
expense of carrying the mails by a direct
tax iu tho form of a postage. It has never
been claimed, however, that this soryico
ought to bo productive of the requisite
amount of revenue.. As has been stated
alre-uiv, thereport of tho postmaster-general
shows that there is now a very consid
erable surplus in his department, aud that
henceforth the receipts are likejy to increase
at a much greater ratio than the
expenditure. Unless some change
is made in the existing laws
the prollts ol the po-tal service will in
a very lew years swell tho revenues of the
Kcvernnieut manv millions ot dollars. The
time seems ou.ioitis for some reduction
in the rates of pos'. -e. In what shall that
reduct ion consist? a review of the legislation
which has been bad upon t'uij subject dur
in : the last thirty years discl es that do
mestic letters constitute the only class of
mail matters which has never
been invored by a substantial
reduction of rates. I am convinced that
the burden of maintaining the service falls
most unequally upon that class, and that
more than ay other it is entitled to present,
rcliel; that such relief may bo extended
without doubt to other public interests,
will be discovered upon reviewing the re.
Hilts of former deductions. Immediately
prior to tho act of 1H15 the postage upon a
letter composed of a single sheet was as
10 milts or less, li
cents; between SO and 80 miles, 10 cents;
between 80 and 150 miles, 12J cents; be
tween l.W and 400 miles. i(;
over vm niueii, , '-j
ant of 1815 the postage upon a single letter
cimveved for any distance under M0 miles
V.i ,t R pints, mill for any creator dis
tance at. 10 cents, lly the act of 1851 it was
.,,,, i ,! i.ht a tingle letter, if prepaid,
ii i.i .o xnrridit any distance not to ex
ceed 3,000 miles for 3 cents, anil any greater
distance for u cents, ll win "o uuuiw
.....i. .,r h.ou iwrinetloni were of a radical
character and relatively quite as important
as that which is now proposed. J n each
case there ensued a temporary loss of rev
enue, but there was a sudden
and large influx of business,
which substantially recovered that
loss within three years. Unless the experi
ence of past legislation In this country and
elsewhere eocs for naught, it may be safely
predicted that the stimulus of jo pel tcuUm
reduction in tax for carriage would at once
Incrcuse t he number of letters consigned to
tbe msils. Tho advantages of secrecy
would lesd to a very general substitution
of sealed packets for postal cards and
open, irregular and divers other
wav and the volume of li rat class
matter would be enormous y
auirment'd. finch Increase amounted in
Knifland in the first year or the adoption of
penny postage to more than lia per cent.
As a result of carelul estimates, the dei n.
of which cannot be submitted. I iu con
vinced that the deficiency for the flnt year,
her the proposed reduction, would not ex-
.i i - .,1 r thu exnenditures. or ).-
UW.ttO, w hile the deliciency after the reduc
tion of IMS was more uiau i i.i
after that of 1KU, was 27 per cent.
Another interesting comnanson is af
forded by statiMics furnished me by
the post office department. The act of
113 was pa---d in the face of the Uct that
thrre existed a deficiency of more than
i.lof. that of 1KM was encouraged by the
Iiight surplus of 132.M). It congress
should approve theee mirgcstions it may
be deemed d-irai le to supply to some ex
tent the deliciency which must for a lime
result by i-creaii.g Uie charge for raiTTing

Aiming oilier important subjects which
are included within the secretary's report
and which will doubtless furnish occasion
for congressional attention, may bo men
tioned tlie neglect of the railroad compan
ies to which la'ge grants nf land wero uiailo
by tho ucts of 1NI2 and lit, to take title
thereto, and their consequent exemption
from local taxation.
No survey of our material condition can
fail to suggest inquiries as to the moral and
intellectual progress of the people. The
ccnsiiB returns disclose an alariningstate ol
illiteracy in certain portions of the
country where the provision for schools Is
grossly inadequate. It is a momentous
question for the decision of congress wheth
er immediate, substantial aid should be ex
tended by the general government for sup
plimenting the efforts of private bene
ficence, and of state and territorial legisla
tion, in behalf of cducubion.
The regulation of inter-state com'" "
has already been the subj'eatof you : ' ..u
or.itinnu. One of the incnk-:,!'iui the mar
velous extension ol the railway system of
the country lias been the adop
tion of such measures - by
tbe corporation which own or
control the roads as has tendered to impair
the advantages of healthful competition,
nnd make hurtful discriminations in the
advancement of freights. These incqiiali.
ties have been corrected in several ot the
states by appropriate legislation, the effect
of which is necessarily restricted to the
limits of tlieir own territory. So far as
such mischiefs affect commerce between
il-n diniPK nr between anvone of the states
nnd a foreign country they aro subjects of
concern, and congress aioue cau aiioru
relief.
rOLYGAMY.
The results which have thus far attended
tho enforcement of the recent statute fur
the suppression oi polygamy :n uie lernio
ries uro reported by the secretary of the in
terior. It is not probable that any addi
tional lenislation in this regard will be
deemed desirable until the effect of existing
laws shall be more clearly observed and
studied. I congratulate you that the com
missioners . under whose supervision
theso laws have been put in
operation ffre encouraged to be
that the evil at which
they are aiming may be suppressed with
out resort to sucn rauicai measures as in
some quarters have been thought indispen
sable for success.
The close relation of the general govern
ment to the territories preparing to be great
states may well engage your special atten
tion. It is there that the Indian disturb
ances mainly occur and that polygamy has
found room for its growth. I cannot doubt
that a carelul ourvey of territorial legisla
tion would be of the highest utility, and
property would become more secure, the
liability of outbreaks between Indians and
uriiitP9 nrniilil hn lessened, the nublicdomaiu
would be more securely guarded, and better
progress be made in tne instruction oi ine
young.
ALASKA

ment. If means were provided for the ed

TIIK REPORT Or THE COMMISSIONER OF AOlil-
CPLTURE
presents a:i account of the labor of that de
partment during the past year, and in
cludes information of much interest to tho
general public.
The condition of the forests of tho coun
try and the destruction that is taking pl-ice
gives cause fbrserious apprehension. Their
action in protecting the earth's surface, iu
modifying the extremes of climate and rcg
ulatinc and sustaining the flow of springs
and streams is not well understood, and
their importance in relation to the growdi
and prosperity of tbe country cannot be
safely disregarded. They are fust disap
pearing tefore destructive rires, and the le
gitimate requirement of our increasing
population, und their total extinction can
not be lonu dolayed unless bet
ter methods than now prevail
shall be adopted for their
nrntertinn and cultivation. The attention
of congress is invited to the necessity ol ad
ditional legislation to secure the preserva
tion oi the valuable forests still remaining
on the public domain, especially in tne ex
treme western states and territories, where
the necessity fir their preservation is great
er than iu lets moontainous regions and
where the prevailing dryness of the climate
renders their restoration, if they are once
destroyed, well nigh impossible.
CIVIL 8EKVICK.
The communication which I made to con
gress at its first session in December last
contained a somewhat full statement of my
sentiments in relation to the principles
and rules which ought to govern appoint
ments to public service. Referring to the
various plans which had therefore been
the subject of discussion in the national
legislature, plana which in the main were
modeled upon me nysuiiu ahiuh-uoiaiub iu
Great llritain, but which lacked certain of
the promineut features whereby that sys
tem isdistinguishrd.I felt bound to intimate
my tbouKhts, whether they or any ol them
would afford an adequato remedy for the
evils which they aimed to correct. I de
clared, nevertheless, th-t if the pro)osed
measures should prove acceptable to con
gress, they would receive the unhesitating
support of the executive. Since tbe sug
geuior.s were submitted for vourconsidera
t inn ihnr hat Wn no lcii.-latinn udoii the
subject to which they relate, but there has,
meantime, b;en an increase in tbe pub ic
Interest on that subject, and the
people of tlie country, apparently with
out distinction of party, have it. various
ways, and upon frequent occasions given
expression to their esrnest wish for prompt
and definite action. In my judgment such
action elided no longer be postponed. I
may add that my own sense of its pressing
importance bas been c,uickened byobserva
tion in tbe practical phases of the service,
to which attention has more than once been
called by predecessor. The civil list now
comprises about loO .000 persona, the large
part of whom, musl, under the terms of
the constitution, be selected by the
president, either directly or tbrongh
bis own appo. riled apenta. in
the early years of the administration ol
the roremmeiit tbe pronal directioa of
appointments to tbe civil service msy not
bare been an irksome task f -r the execu
tive, but now that Hit boiden bas increaMd
fully a boidred-li'd.;ii has become greater
than be ongl.t to b- ar, and it necessarily
detracts his time and attention from the
proper dieebarire of other dalles, no b-ss
delicate and responsible, and which in tbe
very nature ot tb'ng cannot be delegated
to other bands, la tbe judgment ot not a
lew who hare riven study aud reflection to
this mattrr, tbe nation bas outgrown
tbe provisions which the conMitntion
bss established fft rilling tbe minor orlices
in the public servic. but whatever may be
thoncht of tbe wisdom or expediency of
changing tbe fundamental law in this re
rani, it is certain much relief msy be af

Irri'lat'on. Ibev would be protected in a

the Incumbent of an ofllco and appointed

edly alleged that he has in this particular
signally departed from the course which
had been pursued under recent administra

follows: Tho whole number of executive
anno intnients during the four years Inline
diatelv nrjeeding Mr. (larlicld's accession
to thn nresidencv was 2 (Ml : of this number
211. or U per cout., involved the removal of
previous incumbents. Tbe rates of ronewtls
to tho number ot appointments, wis mucu
the same during each of those four years.
In the first year, with 790 appointments,
there were 71 removals, or u if-io per cent
in the second, with 017 appointments,
there were 80 removals, or 8 510 percent.;
in the third, with 480 appointments, there
were 48 removals, or 10 per cent.; in the
fourth, with 42!) appointments, there were

.ntlis oi President (iarfield's administra
tion there were 390 appointments and 80 re
movals, or 22 7-10 per cent. Precisely the
same number ot removal Ml, nave
taken place in the fourteen months
which linve since elapsed
but they constitute only j pur cent of the
whole number of appointments; li within
that period aud less than 2-t of the entire
list of officials, 3,4o0, exclusive ot the army
and navy, which are tilled by presidential
appointment.
I desire to exoress my approval of such
leoislation as may be found necessary for
supplementing' the existing provisions of
law in relation io political assessments. xn
July last I authorized a public announce
ment that their action in that regard would
in no manner affect their official status. In
this announcement I acted upon the view
which I had always maintained and still
maintain, thut a public oflicer should be
absolutely free as any other citizen to give
or withhold a contribution for the aid of
the political party of his choice. It bos,
however, been urged, and doubtless not
without foundation in tact, that, Dy sonci
iminn nf snneriors and by other methods,
such contributions have at tunes bean ob-
tained from persons whose only motive for
giving nas neen tear oi wuab 111101
befall them it they refused
to give it. without saying that such
contributions are not voluntary, and in my
udgment their collection snotiia oe pro
lihlled hv law. A hill which wili effectu
ally suppress them will receive my cordial
approval.
DllSTniCT OP COLUMDIA.
I hope that however numerous and urgent
may be the demands upon your attention,
the interests of this district will not be
forgotten. The denial to its residents of the
great right of sulirage in all its relation to
national, state and municipal action, im
poses on congress tbe duty of affording them
tne nest auminisiraiiou wuiuu it, van uooau.
The report of the district commissioners
iniltpatea certain measures whoso adoption
would seem to b very desirable. I instance
iu particular those which relate to arrears

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,
Among the questions which have been

fers from inability to discharge the powers
and duties ot msomce.
PERORATION.
I trust that no embarrassment may remit
from the failure to determine these ques
tions before an another national election
The closing year has been replete with

Goods our reverent acknowledgment, for
uninterrupted harmony 01 our foreign rela
tions, for the decay of sectional annlmosi
ties. for the exuberance 01 our
harvests and the tnumpus 01 our
makinir nnd manufacturing industries.
for the prevalence of health, the Bnread of
intelltg nce anil ine conservators 01 uie puu
lic.credit. for the growth of the country in
all elements of national greatness for these
and countless other blessings, we should
rejoice and be glad. I trust that under the
insniration of this great prosperity our
councils may bo harmonious, and the dic
tates tf prudence, patriotism, justice and
economy may be seen in the adoption of

Synopsis of Opinions of the Court of Ap
peals, Tflor Term, 1883.
Green Lawsonvs. the State; from Eusk
county. Conviction for theft. The defense
was an alibi, the only evidence of iden'ity
was that of Mrs. Coleman. Before going to
trial defendant moved for a continuance on
the ground that material witnesses were
ubsent. The motion was overruled. Tho
motion does not show want of diligence nor
does it disclose failure of materiality in the
testimony desired, or want ol its probable
truthfulness. IUld, the motion should
have been granted. Keversed and re
manded. White, p. j.
Galloway vs. Baldwin; from Harris coun
ty. A verbal promise to pay a debt hy a
bankrupt when such debt is discharged by
bankruptcy and barred by limitation, win
not revive it as to tbe bar of limitation, but
gives a right of action to the creditor if not
barred, ine statute is not suspended irom
the time of the administration in bank
ruptcy until the promise to pay, but if
Diaintm men his claim wun tue register
and prosecuted his suit in bankruptcy, and
it been remanded to the state courts, 1 lie
statute of limitation would have been sus
pended during Its pendency. Keversed
ami remanded. Hurt,!.
Munson vs. Metz; from Grayson county.
The evidence clearly shims that the mouth
of the sewer, for obstructing which Ibis suit
wrs brought, was larger than at an angle
further down, and that more water could
pass in where the obstruction was placed
than could pass out at the lower angle. The
court therefore erred in reiusiog to charge
that the damage alleged to have been
caused would have accrued to appellee if
the obstruction had not been placed there,
that appellee could not recover, lteversed
and remanded. White, p j.
Hanks vs. the State: from Travis county.

Wane vs. tue oiate; irom uuuerisuu
county. Tho opinion ot medical men, who
are shown to be exports, as to the instru
ment which would produce ueatu, and the
nature and consequences of wounds made
by sucn instruments are competent evi
dence. Flight and its attendant circum
stances are admissible to their guilt in con
nection with other evidence. Tlie fact 1 hat
the homicide was committed by a prisoner
attempting to escape is iu justification. The
written coniessious 01 appeuaui wuue a
prisoner, not being objected to, are admissi

Brawles vs. the State: from Smith county.
On tbe trial a witness testified that he was
well acauainted with both defendant and
deceased; had lived with them in tbe neigh
borhood ior years, ai waa tueu osaeu
what was the general character of tbe par
ties for peace or violence. Objected to and
sustained. He'd, not having qualitied
himself to speak on the subject, the court
did not err. A witness must speak from
his Vnnwledins nf their ireneral character
and not from bis Individual opinion. The
inquiry must be linked to the reputation of
the person in the neighborhood wher he
lived or where he is best known. Atlirtued.
Willson, J.
W Bite vs. the State; from Navarro county .
If a tierson intentionally inflict peraoual
initirv on another, which results in death,
although the intent to kill did not exist, if
the act was pronipte i oy maiice tue taw
holds the assailant guilty of murder. Th
intent must b- proven as a matter ol fact to
be determined from alK the facts and cir
cumstances. To constitute an assault
with intent to murder, two things must
concur: 1. An assault. 2. A spedtla In
tent to kill. Without simultaneous con
currence of both there can be no assault
with intent to murder. No other Intent
save tbe speclfio one to kill is sufficient.
The intent may be to kill under circum
l ances which. If death ensned, would not
be murder, such intent wonld not consti
tute the specific Intent necessary to consti
tute an assault with intent to murder.
Reversed and remanded. Hurt. j.

charge in limiting the rigtt of self-defense
to extreme necessity and leavng the jury
to understand that appellant could only

trine is staled thus : 1. If the slayer pro

sary or tloiiiir him treat bodily
harm, the killing will be murder
no raalter to what extent or extrem
ity he, the sleyor, may be reduced in tbe

ous intent, intending for Instance, only an

of Waito vs the State. Held, further,
statements made by a prisoner in jail,
wben made before the commtrsion of tbe
offense, are not confessions of murder com
mitted, but are statements concerning a
crime to be comuiiued, and are-admissible,
as the rule governing the aumissinn in evi
dence ol confessions does not I'ply. The
evidence supports the verdict after the ex
