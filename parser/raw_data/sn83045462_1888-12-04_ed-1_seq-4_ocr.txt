District affair* are not neglected in the Prsa
dent * message. Attention is called to the urgent
need of a revision or codification of District
law*. After commending to careful consider
ation proposed legislation concerning the
liquor traffic. the proper assessment and col
lection of taxes. Ac., the President *???:
"I again call attention to the preeent incon
venience and the daoger to life and property
attending the operation of steam railroads
through apd across the pablic street* and roads
of the District. Tne propriety of rach legisla
tion as will properly guard the use of these
railroads and better secure the convenience
and safety of <*itizsns is manifest." The Dis
trict s'-cerely hopee that the propriety and
neceaaity of this corrective legislation, so mani
fest to a President who uses his eye*, will also
be clearly aeen by Congress. The legislative
body might also be encouraged to provide ad
ditional legislation concerning the railroads,
by a more vigilant enforoement of existing
law* by the Commissioner* and the United
States district attorney.
The President also refer* to the neglect to
provide for the erection of a po*t-offlc* build
ing at the national capital, the propriety and
neceaaity of which are not disputed, while
?core* of public buildings have been erected
where their necessity for public purpose* is
not apparent That shot hits the center of the
target. There are no resident voter* here to
cause the erection of this building to become
a matter of personal or partisan interest to a
single member of the national legislature. K
broad, public-spirited, statesmanlike view of
proposed legislation is required to raise advo
cates for such measures. Consequently the
necessary legislation is lacking, and the post
office of the national capital continues to occupy
unhealthfnl. tumble-down, rented quarters.
A truly royal way is that is which King
Milan, of Servia. goes about the task of getting
rid of a queen who no longer amuses him; and
in truly a woman'* way doea she contest his
movement, step by step, refusing to recognise
the authority by which he thrusts her aside.
Bis latest stroke is to publish her as henceforth
plain Mme. Natalie de Keczko.and make a de
posit in the bank for her benefit, after the
fashion of a grand seigneur pensioning off a
companion who has wearied hln. but whom,
for association's sake, he is unwilling to caat
adrift utterly. It may not be so easy to dis
pose of a woman of Natalie's tenacity. It is a
queen she means to be. not a private female
subject of the king with two hundred thousand
dollars to live on. It is possible that the only
way he can end the troublesome business will
be to trump up a charge of high treason, or
something of thut sort, and chop off her head.
That may be a distressing necessity, but king*
have been driven to it before.
The Bfconl asks. "Why not eat corn?" Be
cause. esteemed contemporary, in this land of
protection wages are high ehoOMi for every
body to have iour.?PhUadrlphdP Prtu.
Just so; but wouldn't a good many people be
as well or better off if they should use more
corn than they do, and apply the difference be
tween the cost of wheat flour and corn meal to
the procurement of other comforts of life, or
-ay it by for a rainy day? Wheat flour i* cer
tainly a very good thing, but it isn't an abso
lute necessity to anybody.
Why are not the White Caps of Ohio bronght
to justice and punished? That is the question
with which a large part of the northern press
would ring if the scene of the outrages were
transferred to the other side of the Ohio river,
und the victims were black instead of white.
Gov. Foraker has now an excellent opportunity
of exemplifying some of the principles which
he has often urged upon the chief magistrates
of Southern states, and cleansing his splendid
commonwealth of the stain which such lawless
proceedings alway* fasten upon the communi
ty where they occur. And if Mr. Foraker will
not move in the matter, what is to prevent Mr.
Chandler from offering a resolution in the Sen
ate for the appointment of a committee with
full powers to investigate and report?
President Cleveland will do well to go slow
in the matter of criticising the occupancy of
the streets and reservation* of Washington by
steam railroad tracks, or he may find the "usual
courtesies" of the Pennsylvania syitem with
drawn for the remainder of hi* term. These
big corporations are not in the habit of per
mitting free di*cus*ion of matter* affecting
their relation* with the public.
If the police are really '-shadowing'' Dr
Tumblety in New York, they are taking a very
certain way of letting him know it by publish
ing the fact in the newspapers.
Evidently the President still view* civfl serv
ice reform as an accomplished fact, concerning
which no farther discussion on hi* part is nec
eesary. His failure to consider this subject in
the previous message, and to make pledges in
respect to it in his letter accepting the second
presidential nomination, were explained on the
theory that no more words were required. He
?eems to adhere to that theory. Thi* absti
nence is specially remarkable, since political
history teaches very clearly that elaborate dis
cussion of civil service reform with profuse as
surances in respect to it is characteristic of an
outgoing administration, as well as of candi
date* in the doubtfnl state before election, and
that extreme reticence on the subject is to be
expected only from the luccessful party and
candid.te. who are soon to be called upon to
keep their promise*.
Some complaint i* heard that the President'*
message is too long. But it must not be for
gotten that he had a two year*' review of the
state of the nation to write. In 1887 he had
nothing to *ay on any subject except the tariff.
Waahington'* new morning newspaper, the
Prt*?. issued by the Messrs. Fox, is well printed
and newsy in appearance. It declare* itself
devoted to republican principle* and policies,
including protection to home Industrie*, and to
th* elective franchise in every part of the re
public.
If the Canadian question is settled in favor of
annexation, where will the political boodlers
and defaulting bank-cashiers and delinquent
trustees skip to? It is safe to say on which
aid* the vote of that element mar be counted,
if the matter ever has to be decided by the
popular voice north of the border.
It is unwise on the part of the friends of vs
rious statesmen who aspire to places in the next
Cabinet to suggest that this one or that would,
by ssch elevation, be enabled to get into train
ing for the Presidential race of 1892. It would
be more than human to expect Gen. Harrison
wittingly to invite men of eminence to occupy
chairs in his council chambeV, whence they
covld make preparations for the defeat of any
aatiition he may have now, or acquire later, to
socc*ed himself.

IIEADQUARTERS Fob H.ANDKERCH1EFS.
The Palais Royal is "Head quarters" for several rea
aoi.s. First, by virtue of a variety as large as any
other three stores combined. Second, because of re
liability. While fmany /merchants may offer handker
chiefs strictly all linen they also keep cotton hand
kerchiefs, and since "no man can serve two matteri"
are not as reliable AS WE, who serve but one.
WE HAVE NO COTTON handkerchiefs.
Third, because we five better values for the price
than ia usual?we quote prices that would be Impos
sible if we did a credit business.
