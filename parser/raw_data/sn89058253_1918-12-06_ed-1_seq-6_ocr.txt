' President Wilson, addressing congress

be in close touch by cable and wireless
and that congress- will know all that
he does on the other side.
Declaring he had no "private thought
or purpose" in going to France, but
that he regarded It as his highest duty,
the president added:
"It la now my duty to play my full
part in making good what they (Amer.
