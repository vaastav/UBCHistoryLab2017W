footing in Havana, With
, : Fatal Results.
THREE KILLED, MANY WOUNDED
The Trouble Waa Canoed by an Effort
to Close the Theaters on Account
. of Garoia's Death. .
Havana, Dec. 14. After the news of
General Garcla's death spread through.
Havana early yesterday afternoon, the
Cubans wished to have all the places of
amusement closed. They suceeded in
dosing ' two places frequented by
Cubans, but the management of, the
Tacori theater, where there were many
Spanish officers among the audience,
refused to close the house. Thereupon
Allegretto, a former captain of the
Cuban troops, got into an excited argu
ment with the manager of the theater,
and was escorted to the sidewalk by
the police on duty. There Allegretto
entered into a heated discussion with a
Spanish officer, who struck him across
the faoe with the fiat of his sword.
Then there was a collision between the
Cubans and Spanish military men,
more blows were struok on both sides,
and many persons from the cafes and
park cheered for Spain and. brought
orowds of people to the spot from ad
jacent streets and squares.
Suddenly a shot was fired, whether
by a Cuban or by a Spaniard, inten
tionally or accidentally, cannot be said,
and the Cubans retieated into the Ho
tel Ingleterra. More shots were filed:
on both sides, and Arturo, a French
citizen, born in Havana, was Bhot and
seriously wounded while sitting at a
table. . .
More shots were fired, and Cubans
ran through the hotel office and made
their way upstairs. '' Jesus Solongo, a
Cuban, fell wounded on the stairs, and
another wounded man broke into the
room occupied by Lieutenant Fitzhugh
Lee, son of the famous general, and the
former consul-general here, demanding
protection. General Greene and sev
eral members of his staff, who had been
out on a balcony watching the crowd,
heard the uproar in the hotel, and went
into the corridor. So soon as the Span
ish offioers saw General Greene, who
was in uniform, they stopped the pur
suit of the Cubans, saluted and retired.
. In the meantime, Eastaqnino Lemus
had been fatally wounded in the street,
and Pedro Blesa and Senor Jiininez had
been killed. , .
Shortly after the Spanish guards on
duty swarmed in from the neighboring
streets, and order wasi restored.
At the time the Cubans and pursuing
Spaniards -ran through the Hotel Ingle
terra, General Humphreys was in the
lobby, talking to Majoi Martin, of Gen
eral Greene's. sMff, and other gentle
men. A bullet shattered a mirror near
which they stood, and two others
splintered the stairoase. '
R: S. How-land, editor of the Provi
dence Journal and Mr. W. L. Reilly, a
New York contractor, were jostlod by
the sudden rush of shouting and fight
ing men. General Julio Sanguilly was
sitting at a table in the lobby. The
violent scenes in the office and on the
stairs lasted, however, for only a few
minutes. On the outside the Spanish
soldiers were clearing the great square
and streets in the vicinity. The hotel
was full of American officers and civil
ians, and some of them with their
wives were standing on the balconies at
the imminent risk of being hit by bul
lets fired at an upward angle to scare
the crowds. From that point they
watched the spectacle in the electric
lighted square. ;
. It is reported that in addition to
.those killed and wounded who have
heen previously mentioned, 14 are be
ing oared for in private houses. Three
arrests were made. . A few minutes
after the shooting in the hotel fright
ened patrons and Cubans gathered
around General Greene asking if he
would protect them. He assured them
he believed they were, safe, but the only
recognized authority in Havana was
the Spanish executive. He then I sent
Captain Cole and Lieutenant' Stevens
to General Castellanos to inquire what
was being done to preserve order. ' The
latter replied that .the cafes had been
ordered closed, and the streets oleared,
while troops in sufficient numbers to
keep the peace had been poBted in the
squares and thoroughfares.' Two of
the aids of General Castellanos called
upon General Greene and gave him
further personal assuranoes.
Telephone messages describing the
occurrence were sent to General Wade
in Elvedado, aad General Greene
cabled to Washington a brief statement
of the facts. What was taking place in
the city was all unknown to the Amer
ican warships and transports in "the
harbor, nor did the news reaoh there
until this morning. .
The United States evacuation com
missioners and General' Greene sent
General Clous and . Captain Hart at
noon today to exchange views with the
Spanish commissioners. It was ar
ranged that all the Cuban offioers and
soldiers, including General Julio San
guilly and Jose Lacret, should go to
the oamp near Mariano and remain out
of the city until the Spanish forces were
withdrawn
Senator! Test and Hoar Desire No
' . Philippines. -t ;
Washington, Dec' 14. Disoussion of
two questions, each of importance and
interest at this session, was begun by
the senate at its session to3ay.' Terri
torial expansion and the construction of
the Nicaragua oanal occupied the atten
tion of the body duiing the 'greater part
of the afternoon.
As soon as the routine morning busi
ness had been disposed of. Mr. Vest
I (Dem. Mo.) called up his resolution
offered last week, deolaring it to be un
constituional for this government to
acquire foreign territory except for coal
ing stations or some like purpose, un
less its intention was to confer state
hood upon the territory and oitizen
ship upon its inhabitants. Mr. Vest
declared it was a basio principle of this
government "that the powers of the
government were derived from the' con
sent of the governed," and maintained
that the federal government had no
authority either in morals or in the
constitution to go beyond that princi
ple. He held that the principle had
been sustained by the supreme court in
various decisions, and that no publio
man of prominence and no, recognized
tribunal had ever been reckless enough
to'controvert it.' ;;. , i
Mr. Morgan opened the debate on the
oanal bill with a three hours' appeal
for action at this session. The whole
oountry, he said, would be disappoint
ed if congress did not act. He was
willing to take any measure whioh
would result in the building of the
canal. In the course of his remarks,
he agreed to accept an amendment spe
cifically exoepting the canal from neu
trality with regards to any country
with which the United States might
be at war.
TO RELIEVE VOLUNTEERS.
Six Regiments Designated for Service
at Manila.
Washington, Deo. 14. The" war de
partment has begun in earnest the re
lief of the volunteer troops now sta
tioned at Manila by regulars. " This

volunteers in Manila will be retried in
the order in whioh they reached that
city. .

Manila, Deo. 13. According to re
liable advices reoeived from Iloilo,
capital of the island of Panay, in the
Visayas group, the insurgents attaoked
Iloilo the night of December 1 and cap
tured all the Spanish trenches, except
one. : They then notified General Rios
to remove the women and children,
and threatened to renew the attack on
the following night. 1 --:
When these advices left Iloilo, Gen
eral Rios was expecting reinforcements
andj field guns, and. the plan was for
the Sparfish gunboats to shell, if the
insurgents effeoted an entranoe. The
foreign residents were greatly alarmed,
and all merchantmen have been ordered
outside the harbor.
v Meanwhile the -Spanish authorities

FILES HER PROTEST.
Spain Accepts the Consequences 111
Naturedly. . ' . .
Madrid,-Dec. 18. The government
entirely approves the memorandum of
protest against the action of the United
States commissioners, filed by Senor
Montero Rios, at Paris.
The memorandum protests against
the refusal of the Americans to surren
der the securities deposited in the treas
uries of Cuba and Porto Rico by private
Spaniards,- remarking that:"never has
a civilized nation committed such an
aot of violence." '
Secondly, it'protests against the ulti
matum demanding the Philippines.
Thirdly, it protests against the posi
tion in which those Spaniards are
placed who desire to remain in Cuba.
. . Fourthly, it protests against the ref
erence to the destruction of the Maine
in President MoKinley's message to
congress. ' On this point the memoran
dum says:
"Spain haB proposed arbitration, but
the United States has refused to give
her the right which is granted to a
criminal; namely, the right of defend
ing herself. The Spanish commission
ers leave the care of fixing the responsi
bility for tha' explosion to'-, the entire
world, whicli will say whether those
are responsible who desire the truth, or
those refusing to seek it."
The newspapers generally express re
lief at the signing of the treaty.' The
independent organs, most of the provin
cial papers and the Carlist and repub
lican journals attack both political par
ties, conservative and liberal, reproach
ing them equally with having brought
the country to the present pass. . : ;
El Imparcial alone publishes the
contents of the treaty, which produces
a less unfavorable impression than had
been expected, owing to the commercial
and other concessions to Spain.
El Liberal says: "The Paris negotia
tions offer a far sadder spectacle than
the ships which are bringing back our
repatriated soldiers, deplorable as the
oondition of the latter is." ' .-;"'.
'.',: Several members of the United States
commission were inclined at first tq
publish the text of the treaty, but Sen
ator Frye made a strong plea yesterday
for the' observance of ooortesy toward
the United States senate, and bis ar
guments prevailed. i
learned as to the wording of the treaty,
which provides , that Cuba is to be re
linquished and that Porto Rico and the
Philippines are to be ceded. The
Americans are to pay for the repatria
tion Of the Spanish troops from all the
colonies. . The Spaniards are to return
all prisoners held by them. They are
to retain possession , of all military
stores, and munitions of war in the
Philippines, and of such ships as have
not been captured. The commercial
treaties between the two nations, which i
the war ruptured, are to be lenewed at
the convenience of the two nations.

The Cuban Patriot ' a Victim ef the
Northern Climate :
Washington, Deo. 18. General Cal
ixto Garcia, the distinguished Cuban
warrior and leader, and the head of the
sommission elected by the Cuban as
sembly to .visit this country, died here
this morning, shortly after 10 o'olock,
at the Hotel Raleigh, where the com
mission has its headquarters. ' "
' The sudden change from the warm
jlimate of Cuba, with the hardships
he had there endured, to the wintry
weather of New York and Washington,
Is responsible . for ' the pneumonia
which resulted in his demise. He con
tracted a slight cold ill New York,
which did not assume an alarming
stage until early the part of last week.
Last Tuesday night,. General Garcia,
in company with the other members of
the commission, attended a . dinner
given in his honor by General Miles,
and it. was a result of the exposure that
culminated in his death. ,
During the 12 hours or more preced
ing dissolution. General Garcia was
unoonscous most of thetirrje. At in
tervals he recognized one or more of
those about him. In his dying mo
ments, as all through his busy and ao
tive life, his thoughts were for his be
loved country and ' its people, and,
among his last words, were irrational
mutterings, in which he gave orders to
his son. who is on his staff, for the bat
tle which he supposed was to occur to
morrow, and in which he understood
there were only 400 Spaniards to com
bat. Just before he died he embraced
his son. -
Rev. Father Magee, of St. Patrick's
church, was called in during . the day,
and was with General Garcia until the
end, administeriug the last rites of the
Catholic church. Other members of
the commission and Mr. Rubens, their
counsel in this country, 1 were also in
the bed-chamber when the end oame.
The remains were immediately pre
pared for burial, and were placed on a
bierwin the room in which he died. A
large Cuban flag served as a covering,
and the head rested on one of smaller
dimensions. -The faoe and bust were
left exposed to public view. The fea
tures had a remarkable lifelike appear
ance, and gave no : indication of the
suffering whioh the deceased had
borne. Just above the head rested a
magnificent : floral piece of red and
white ribbon. s By direotion of Major
General Miles a detachment of soldiers
from battery E, Sixth artillery, under
command of Lieutenant Cox, was de
tailed as a body guard for the remains.
General Garcia, whose name will
ever be linked with those of other pa
triots who have fought against unequal
odds for the freedom of his country,
has had a most active and varied life,
most of whioh has been spent in fight
ing for the cause of Cuban liberty,
whioh he had the satisfaction of seeing
accomplished so shorta time before his
death. He was a man of cultuie and
refinement, of splendid education, and
came from a distinguished family of
Jaiquani.ol Santiago de Cuba province..
He was born. in Cogquin, October 14,
