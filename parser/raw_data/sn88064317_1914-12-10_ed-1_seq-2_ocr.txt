The Presides Message.
On Tuesday at noon following
his custom, President Wilson ap
peared in person before a joint
session of both houses of Convrrss
and read his second message, a
message that treated principally of
peace, industry and commerce.
A brief synopsis of this message
is a follows:
Sixty-third Congress will long
be remembered for the great body
of thoughtful and conservative
work done in response to needs of
the country.
Markets ol Central and South
America can be turned to the
United States and what interests
us now is our duty and oppor
tunity.
We have grossly erred in the
way in v\ hich we hâve stunted and
hindered the development of our
merchant marine. The time and
circumstances are extraordinary
and so must our efforts be also.
Safeguard the resources of the
national domain and encourage the
use of the navigable waters outside
that domain for the generation of
power.
A larger measure of self-gov
ernment to the people of the
Philippines.
The passage of this bill will
nobly crown the record of these
two years of memorable labor
Open the gates of trade to the
United States by passage of the
shipping bill pending in both
houses. It is not a question of
the government monopolizing the
field, but one of providing means
of gaining trade.
Show good faith in adopting
the rural credits bill, already rati
fied by Great Britain and Ger
many.
Provide means for charting
and surveying the coasts of the
United States and Alaska, thereby
conserving lives and shipping.
Provide for economy in public
expenditures. The duty is mani
fest and imperative.
As to national d fjnse, the
policy of the United States is set
tied against a large standing army.
A nation of ppace has no need to
be alarmed by sensationalists. We
shall not turn America into a mili
larv camp Congress should en
co llage military training ' in
flftti
ened. The country has been mis
informed as to the matter of the
nation's defenses. The United
States has not been negligent.
Great tasks of and duties of
peace challenge our best powers
and invite us to build what will
last with all the finest gifts of con
structive wisdom we possess."
Prosperity is Coming.
There is a distinct and unmis
takable feeling of hopefulness
throughout the country 'bver the
splendid pros^cts for an early
and unparaleled revival of busi
ness. Thh almost universal opti
mistie feeling is based upon the
condit ion of the crops in the wheat
and corn belt, and the cotton belt,
and the bright outlook for prema
nent peace in Mexico. The saw
mills in some of the coast towns
have already determined to in
crease their output in anticipation
of the revival of trade not only in
the United States but in Mexico
and other f jreign countries. It is
very gratifying, indeed, to know
that the bûsmess world is taking a
more hopeful view of conditions.
Sentiment is decidedly better than
it was a month ago. This is par
in the bank

the United States. Other encour
aging indications are to be found
in the re-employment of men by
the railroads and steel miHs.
Transportation authorities are
sending in reports to the effect
that the number of idle cars is
stéadlv decreasing, and that the
number is likely to grow smaller
as the demands for crop-moving
tacilitie8 increase«

GRAND JURY REPORT
To the "Hon. W. T. Cunningham,
Judge of the 11th District Court sitting
in and for the Parish of Natchitoches.
We, your Graud Jurors duly elected,
empanelled and sworn in and for the
December term of the District Court
in and for the Parish of Natchitoches,
beg leave to submit this our final report
for the term.
We have examined into 176 cases and
have found 67 true bills and 90 no bills
and have passed 19 cases for want of
sufficient evidence.
We have labored earnestly and hon
estly to look into all of the affairs of
the parish of Natchitoches Parish, and
to follow out to the best of our ability
the mandates and prohibitions of our
oath, and although the job has been a
tedious one, we feel that we have done
our full duty to the citizens of the par
ish of Natchitoches.
We are glad to state that crime in
the parish of Natchitoches for the pasc
six months has been on the decrease
that while we have investigated a num
ber of cases, the offenses for the most
part have been misdemeanors and lots
of them without merit.
It has been called to our attention
that during the last election held in
this parish, a great deal of intoxicating
liquors were used at the elections. We
took up this complaint and examined
into it and tried hard to get at the bot
tom of it, and while we find that there
wa3 good grounds for the complaint in
many instances, we have been unable
from the unsatisfactory evidence pro
duced before us to fix the responsibility
on any person, and have therefore
failed to indict. But this is a practice,
which we believe can not be too strong
ly condemned, we are heartily in sym
pathy with the law that prohibits such
practice and hope that all violators of
the same hereafter will ba properly
punished.
We have also had complaints about
what are commonly called "Cider
Joints, ' and while we have failed to
get any evidence that might connect'
them directly with the sale of anything
intoxicating, we find"that they do give
trouble by allowing persons wno are
intoxicated to lie around their places
of business and to get boisterous, and
thereby bring suspicion on them. We
wish to caution the proprietors of these
places about allowing such practices
and to warn them that if such is con
tinued that they the proprietors will be
the sufferers therefor.
We are glad to report that from our
investigation we find that the crime of
retailing spirituous liquors which has
* n the P ast S^ ven Grand Juries so much
trou bi e j s greatly on the decrease, e
nave at this term found only a few in
dictaient» for that crime, and have had
very little complaint from the parish
as a whole about the violation of this
läW.
We hs*t examinedfch& Sheriff's oC
«!,* *n*. Ultr ËOOftd
(books âS8 the office fn good shape.
We note the new benches which were
built by the sheriff and put in the halls
and corridors of the court house, and
think that they are a great improve
ment and add greatly to the comfort
an( j convenience of the citizens who
visit the court house and have business
there.
We have examined the Assessor's
record and office and find the same in
good shape, and his roll for this year
nearly gotten up.
We have visited and examined the
Gerk's office and find everthing therein
in good shape, the books being all up
to date with the recording work and in
dexing also all up.
We find that both the assessor's -of
fice and the clerk's office are entirely
too smail for the amount of work that
has to be carried on in them, and not
properly equipped for the work.
We know that this is not a very
propitious time tor spending money by
the Police Jury, but we recommenu
and urgently request that as soon as
conditions will permit that they build
additions to both of these offices and
give them proper equipment to carry
on the work.
We have examined the jail and find
the same clean and in good sanitary
condition, and all the inmates therein
well treated ,
We have examined the books of the
Parish Treasurer and find the same
well and neatly kept.
But we find that the guttering on the
badly dilapida
outside of the jail is in badly
ted condition and leaking, and recom
mend that the Police Jury have the
same fixed at once.
We visited the State Normal School
and were taken all around the build
ings and grounds aod find everything
ih good condition and the work well
carried on.
In conclusion we wish to thank all of
the officers of the court for the assist-j
ance given us by them and the prompt
ness with wliich they attended to our
man y calls on them, and to specially
thank our faithful door keeper for his
good and patient service.
Having con oleted our labors, we res
pectfully ask »hat we be discharged for
the term, *

Farming ' is now a business.
The successful farmer is the man
who make* a study of the particu
lar soil which he expects to culti
vate, the crops he will grow, the
met'i'*ds of cultivation and harvest;
and the markets he « ill seek.
It is now realized there is no
business that requires a higher;
order of trained intelligence, a
closer application tp work, ami a
mote careful analysis of conditions
than successful farmiu.'.
The younger generations are
securing the fundamentals of sue
cessfnl farming in the public
schools, and in the agriculture
college ot the Htate university.
But the farmer himself cau't enter
the public schools or spend a ses :
sion at the university.
For his needs, the short course
has been organized, and in this
short course some of the tilings
he should know are brought to his
knowledge by lectures nnd demod
The most prominent; agiictil-j

Dec. 1 >th, Friday, Dec. lltli, and
Saturday, Dec. 12th, to hold a,
Farmer's Short Course. The Nat
chitoches Commercial Association
lias done extensive advertising ia
order to reach every farmer of the
arish. I lie farmers are marii-jgf
testing great interest in such a
meeting as thev are anxious to get j
information on crops which this j
section has poLheretofore --grown.
Those participating ir< this meet
ing are Dr. W. R. Dodson on hogs :
and forage crops, C. II. Staples < n
dairying and silo construction. Dr.
C. E Nelson on tick eradication
and dipping vats, R. VV. Keiserjfj
on beef and cattle, A. F Rolf on j
poultry, A. R. Moist on horsesjf
and mules.
Practical demonstration will be
given during each day and illus

The f irmer of today, land-poor

to consij^r the wisdom of the;IS
agricultural schools as toojmich
folly, pure and simple, and the j
teachings of such institutions as!
theoretical, quite untried and pro-i
babl.v unpractical. The man who '
comes to such conclusions has for
gotten, or he never knew, the
history of the tSoutli in ante-bellum
days. 1 hen no planter confined
himself to one crop. He may
have clone so for a money crop, as
many commodities which he raised
iu abundance, it was impracticable

homegrown On the plantation !
there was the greatest diversifica

The greater the diversification, the
ampler the iiotue life, the larger
