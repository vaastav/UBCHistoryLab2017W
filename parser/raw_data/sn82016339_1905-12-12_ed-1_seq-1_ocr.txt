One of the largest gatherings that ever attended a mass meeting in
Hilo was present at Fireman's Hall Thursday night to express to Super
intendent of Public Instruction W. H. Babbitt tlleir views regarding n
higli school site and other school matters. The atmosphere of the halt
was fairly charged with incipient trouble, which later broke into a slorm
of words anil bitterness. At times tho debate grew almost personal, but
through the clever tact of J W. Mason, who was in the chair, all personal
feelings were subdued, and at the close of the meeting the contestants
shook hands, the losers in the controversy acquiescing in the will of the
majority.
J. W. Mason was selected ns chairman of the meeting, R. A. Lyman,
Jr., Secretary, and J. L. Kaulakou, Interpreter. At the request of the
Chairman, Superintendent Babbitt was called upon to state the purpose
of the meeting, which he did briefly and concisely:
"I have come here to listen and not to talk," said Mr. Babbitt in
opening his remarks. "The Governor has decided to reopen the discus
sion of the proposed location of the high school site. The Governor
and the Department of Education, whom I represent, desire to secure
the views of the Hilo public, who are interested in the location of a high
school site and other school matters. There are two things which have
come to my attention which I wish to mention. The first is the impres
sion prevailing among some that the reopening of the question of the
high school and other sites here is a moe simply to delay the building
of a high school. I want to say that that impression is entirely erro
neous. The legislature passed an appropriation of $20,000 for a Hilo
High School, and Hilo is going to have its high school just as soon as
it is possible to build it. (Applause.)
"In some quarters, there is another itnprcssiou, much more limited,
however, that an attempt is being made to railroad through a proposition
for the acquirement of certain property by the government, which cer
tain parties are endeavoring to dispose of. I know this is not so, so far
as the Department of Education is concerned, and that there will he
exchange of lands which is not advantageous to the Territory and in
which every citizen is not interested..,. The Department has no funds
for the purchase of school sites, but if de-rable property can be secured
for school purposes by an equal exchange for other lands in the hands of
the department, we are willing to consider such propositions. A num
ber of gentlemen have talked with me regarding available sites, but I
have committed myself to none of the propositions made I hope every
individual here will feel free to express his views, which may be helpful
to the Department. (Applause).
"In a word. I am here not to subserve the interest of any single
political party or parties, no single individual or association, but on be
half of the Department of Education and in the interest of public educa
tion." (Applause).
Chairman. Mason called for expressions of opinion upon the subject
under discussion. There was a dead silee for an interval, when L.
A. Andrews started the ball rolling, by stating there wero two things
upon which there was a unanimity of sentiment in Hilo. The first was
the necessity for a high school in Hilo and the second the selection of
the Riverside lot as the high school site. T. J. Ryan offered a resalu
tion, which passed without opposition, stating that it wasthesense of the
meeting that the high school should be erected on the Riversede lot.
At this juncture J. A. Scott, upon whose face there was seen early in
the meeting a look of determination, arose and demanded to know of
Superintendent Babbitt if he believed the Riverside lot could accommo
date the high school and the present Riverside school?
"For present needs," said Mr. Babbitt, "yes; for future education in
Hilo, no."
Scott asked another question, which was where it was proposed to
place the Riverside school if the present lot was used for high school
purposes?
This, Mr. Babbitt replied, was the very subject upon which he was
seeking information. He had pictured the high school's growth and the
establishment of an observatory, a commercial, a manual training and
agricultural departments, all of which would eventually need the entire
space within the present Riverside lot and possibly more.
Mr. Scott sought to draw from Superintendent Babbitt whether offers
had not been made for the exchange of land on the opposite side of the
street for the use of the Riverside school. There arose a chorus of
voices from the rear of the hall, crying "Question, question." The
Chairman loudly rapped for order, and as "an American citizen and tax
payer," Mr. Scott insisted upon securing the information asked for.
Mr. Babbitt said he had received numerous offers, which he then pro
ceeded quietly and in an orderly manner to lay before the meeting, illus
trating the various proposed exchanges by means of a map.
It appears that the Masonic lot, about which there has been so much
discussion, will not alone accommodate the Riverside school building,
and it becomes necessary to secure adjoining property if the offer of the
Masonic Hall Association is to be considered. There are tvvo lots,
owned respectively by Chas. Hitchcock and Harry Wicks, on the mauka
side of the Masonic lot, which are for sale, but the Department has no
funds for the purchase of land. There is another lot known as the Loe
benstein property, on School street, adjacent to the Union School, which
it was desired to add to the grounds of the latter school. Mr. Babbitt
read an option, received from D. A. Loebcustcin, in which the latter ex
pressed his willingness to accept government land, soon to be opened up,
of commensurate value with his own property, which he valued at
$1,700. Mr. Babbitt said the Masons sought in exchange for their
property and the Hitchcock property, which they would buy, a propor
tionate valuation in a corner lot at Waianuenue and Bridge streets, being
a portion of Block C. He had not committed himself to any of the
propositions named, but desired an expression of public opinion regard
ing the various offers.
Scott said he would advance the cash for the purchase of the Hitch
cock lot, and when asked by Mr. Babbitt if he would buy both lots, he
demurred. Mr. Babbitt added that neither lot singly was sufficient for
the purposes of the Riverside school Mr. Scott declared the govern
ment had pledged itself not to dispose of any portion of Block C, which
had been reserved as a site for a federal building. He thereupon pro
ceeded to read a letter from Assistant Secretary of the Treasury II. A.
Taylor, in which it was stated that the Acting Governor on August 30,
1005, had promised to reserve the lot in question for federal purposes.
Scott said that there had been a remarkable change in the attitude of
one of the local press, and he desired to have read extracts from the files
of the Herald three years ago and of today. This proposal was met
with a chorus of "No, no, no," "Out of order." Amid the shouts of
"Sit down," Scott replied that he did not wish to stoop to personalities,
but that the editorial in the morning paper was "dictated by a whipper
snapper." Editor Stacker jumped to his feet to deny the accusation,
and for a minute or two it appeared the meeting might break up in dis
order. Chairman Mason called for order, and when quiet was restored
the motion to read the Herald articles was voted down.
L. A. Andrews then presented a resolution in elfect endorsing the
suggestion of Superintendent Babbitt that the government secure upon
the best terms possible the Masonic, the Hitchcock, the Wicks and the
Loebenstein lots. Scott desired to amend providing that under no cir
cumstances should an exchange be made of any portion of Block C,
which had been reserved for a federal building. The amendment was
promptly voted down ami the motiou carried with little op'positiou,
S3ott then moved that in affecting an exchange with the Masonic
Hall Association, the latter should be required to give a guaranty that
they would erect a $30,000 building within twelve or twenty-four
months. In explaining the purposes of his motion, he staled that he
had been informed by v high Mason that the Association had no present
intention of building, and he did not care to see a repetition of the farce,
of the "gold shovel" enacted three years ago. Campbell demanded
to know what particular Mason had made such a statement and when
Scott refused to divuhe the party's name, said, "He didn't know what
he was talking about.', A hearty laugh at Campbell's expense was
caused by Scott's quick retort "He knows better what you are talking
about than you do."
T. J. Ryan delivered a speech on the question, advocating that the
Riverside school be destroyed if necessary, to make room for the high
school building. By a rising vote Scott's motion to require a guaranty
was snowed under, and the meeting adjourned in fairly amicable spirits
among the majority.

Washington, Dec. 5. President Roosevelt's message today urges im

I twenty years, seventy-five per cent of the internal revenue and the
customs receipts from Hawaii, to be used as a fund for education, pub
1 lie buildings, military and naval defenses.
1 he President holds that the nation must develop the Territory on
American lines and no laws permitted admitting Chinese or a servile
class. The country cannot concede the admission to Hawaii of a class
denied admission to other States and Territories. Hawaii shall never'
become a Territory in which a governing class of rich planters exists
by means of coolie labor. The Territory must have the same basis for
stable citizenship as the continent.
