TIlE WAR ON THE SIORUONS
The report of the secretary of tho in
terior Mr KOULE in speaking of Utah
contains the following from the report of
the Utah commission to the secretary If
the Mormon church would declare against
polygamy there is little doubt but that the
people would generally accept the declara
tion as binding upon them but insteaa of
doing this every effort of the government
to suppress the crime is denounced as per
secution
This was written by the Utah commis
sion just before the issuance of the anti
polygamy manifesto and was accompanied I
by a recommendation for additional legisla
tion The commission based their claim
for the necessity of additional legislation
OH their belief that fortyone male per
sons have contracted plural marriages since
Tune 1S
The Mormon church has declared against
polygamy and there has been no evidence
forthcoming as to the fortyone male per
sons whom the commissioners said they be
lieved had contracted plural marriages
Secretary NOBLE has this to say of Utah
affairs The present laws should not
however be changed on these professions
alone These can be unmade by the same
body that has made them The revela
tion sanctioning polygamy remains un
changed The Mormons by their works
must prove their declarations to be made in
good faith t
The Mormons would not ask more
than this They desire a chance to prove
their sincerity Polygamy included there
has been less lawbreakingamong the Mor
mons than among any other western com
munity of the same sizeBut the government
has decreed that polygamy should cease
anO the Mormons after the prosecutions
for polygamy had almost ceased for sheer
want of material to work upon came for
ward in a very unambiguous manner and
declared their intention to obey the law
They dd not do this in the first place be
cause they thought they should show their
loyalty to a principle of their religion and
suffer for it if necessary After practic
ally all violators of the law had been pun
ished for their acts then and not till then
did the Mormons pronounce against poly
gamy To have yielded earlier than they
did would have looked like cowardice in
refusing to take the consequences of their
acts To have held out longer would have
shown that they were not good citizens and
not willing to obey any law that did
not suit them In no other way
could the Mormons have been absolutely
loyal to their religion and at the same
time absolutely loyal to the government
The government has seen fit to require
of the Mormons that they be better in
every respect than the people of any other
section The Mormons agree to the condi
tions imposed and ask leave to be per
mitted to attempt the gauntlet They
agree and will endeavor to live up to that
agreement that in the future they will not
only as they have in the past live better
lives on the whole than those not of their
faith but they agree further to do away
with the only conspicuous species of law
breaking that has ever characterized them
the practice of polygamy This we
think should be all that need be required
of them We say to the nation If you
will require that the Mormons live stricter
lives than any other denomina
tion on the continent at least
give them a chance to carry out your be
hests Do not now punish them for what
5 ou imagine they may do They ask that
they ba judged by their actions
It is with only a natural surprise and
pain therefore that many of the people
here detect in the Presidents message a
suggestion that the people of Utah be still
further afflicted by some sort of degrada
thin that will punish them in advance for
actions it is supposed they may be guilty
of in the future
AFTEU Tan endorsement of the force bill

IT OUT not be generally known that in
Utah elections are conducted by the Utah
commission much after the manner pro

PRICES GO UP
The firm of S SANFO U Sons carpet
manufacturers of Amsterdam X Y oue
of whose members the Hon JOHX SAJT
lOKD has probably been reelected to the
next Congress issued a circular during the
campaign from which the following is an
extract
It is being industriously eheulated that prices
of carpets fonc gone up 25 per cent since the
passage of the McKiNLEy bill We desire to
say that this statement is untrue The con
sinner can purchase todar the various kinds of
capetings manufactured by us at the prices
prevailing previous to the passage of the Mc
KIMKY bill
This letter published in the variOUs
high tariff organs was the basis of the nu
merous editorials of Republican
newspa
pers during the campaign which were in
tended to create the impression that the
talk about higher prices for carpets was
misleading
Notwithstanding this assertion of S SAX
FORD Sons some of the truth about the
advnncean the price of carpets is now com
ing out
The Boston Commercfal Bulletin says that
Mr SiXFOHD makes tapestry carpets
which contain comparatively little
carpet
wool the cost of which has been directly
and sharplyraised by the MCKINLEY bill
Brussels carpets require over twice as
a
V
V
much wool as tapestry Brussels and 40 per
cent more than even tapestry velvet The
tapestry makers now have the additional
advantage under the new tariff of free
jute which is not used in Brussels car
pets In spite of free jute however and
in spIte of the comparatively small quanti
ty of carpet wool used as stated SAXFORD
S SONS hate raised prices as the following
table shows
The first list is taken from the reports of
the Carpet and Upholstery Trade Review of
October 1 page 59 and the second from
the Dry Goods Chronicle of November 22
page 24 where it is preceded by the words
S SANroKD Sons have mado the fol
lowing quotations for their goods The
latter list ispublished by the Chronicle with
the new lists made by other manufacturers

We give the following table so that con
sumers will understand just exactly how
much tax they will be paying tho govern
ment for each box of tin plates consumed
afterJuly lV ISIK Thou comes a table
giving the extra cost of each box of tin the
highest tax on four different sizes being
S17i J o OO 68S and 5 > 873 respectively
This circular concludes with these words
By deducting this excessive tax from the
cost of your plates you can ascertain what
you would pay if tin plates were admitted
free as a rate material
SHORT AS the present session of Con
gress will be it may be far too long for the
good of the country
WE FAXCV that Congress will not have
much time to devote to Utah at this session
THE CHICAGO Times though treating on
another subject argues the case for the
Mormons in this pointed way All at
tempts uppn the part of the state to inter
fere with individual rights are inimical to
that personal liberty which the republic
engaged to protect and without which it
would be the veriest mockery When an
American shall not have the legal right to
follow without wronging his neighbor his
own bent observe his own customs do
what ho will with his day of rest worship
according to the dictates of his conscience
or if he so incline worship not at all and
direct the education of his children he will
be in no better plight than a subject of the
Czar of all the Russias Such a day will

THE MONEY IN CIKC ORATION
Not long since the Tribune roundly l abused
us lor publishing in answer to some of its
assertions the official figures of the in
crease qf our circulating currency as com
pared with our increase of population The
Tribune asserted that by the demonetiza I
tion of silver the circulating currency had
been reduced about 30 per cent as com
pared with the increased population As
the official figures we published did not
bear out the truth of this statement the
organ flew into a rage and quoted some re
marks trom the St Louis GlobeDemocrat to i
prove its assertion as against us and the
official figures We studied this quotation
and were unable to see in what way it i
strengthened the Tribune theory except
in a few words attributed to some one else
But now comes the GlobeDemocrat the
silver and monetary authority of the Triii
unc to which it flew in hot haste when cor
nered by the official figure vith the fol
lowing editorial statement on this matter
The Atlanta Constitnion declares that the
currency of the country has been steadily con
tract d ror a quarter of a century The Con
ttf niton is the Pue of the southern section of
the country In the past dozen years the ratio
of the growth in the currency has been more
than twice as great as that In population
It will be seen that the position of the
GlobeDemocrat is utterly at variance with
that of the Tribune The latter will not
quote the former again to show that the
currency has shrunk 150 per cent through
the demonetization of silver
Now neighbor do let us hear from you
in regard to this matter
STILL THE question is what is the in
I
port of the lresidents reference to Utah I
CLEAn AXU able in other respects the
reference to Utah is decidedly ambiguous I
WILL GAG law be adopted in the Senate I
There will be a line opportunity for Demo I
cratic oratory and patriotism to manifest
itself on the motion to adopt rules by which V
debate can be cut off
HL IS INNOCEM
Public sympathy will go out to exCon
ductor CUtw now that it appears there
is little or no evidence against him and a
general feeling of regret will result that
charges of so serious a nature were mado
against him openly without reservation or
qualification and given to the public
papers as an assured fact when they were
only mere suspicions
How meagre must have been the ov
dene against him is indicated by the fact
that he was not even held to answer after
the preliminary examination
A workingmans reputation is his stock
intrade as well as his guarantee of recog
nition by honorable people and to injure
his reputation by serious charges unsup
ported by evidence is a wrong of more than
ordinary gravity We trust that the in
jured man will as quickly recover among
strangers the vantage ground of honorable
prestige as he already has among his
I friends
TIll DnKVER JVcics has a story that the
Mormons in the vicinity of Eagle Rock are
making desperate efforts to prevent Gen
tile capatalists from makin land entries
in that section the country The des
perate efforts according to tho story
consist in a statement said to have been
made by the Mormons that some of thc
land entries were fraudulent
SENATOR EDMUNDS recently remarked
that he was thankful the Senate is still a
deliberative body How deep his thank
fulness was will presently appear The
vote to adopt REEDS rules for the Senate
will probably soon be taken
TUE LOCAL Republican organ does not
agree with the Presidents recommenda
tion for the passage of the force bill
IT SEEMS very difficult says the New
I York Times to get into the minds of busi
ness menat least of those whom admir
I ing neighbors send to Congress the fact
J that the great mass of business in this
country is done not with money but with
credit based directly on commodities or
I on securities which in their turn owe their
I origin to commodities There is a preva
lent idea that finds hospitality in some
brains that ought to be absolutely inac
cessible to it that more money will
raise prices stimulate business and pro
mote prosperity Yet we have had strik
ing instances within a very few years in
our own country of great changes in tte
activity of business in the course of
prices and in general prosperity changes
great in one direction and then in the op
posite without any material change in the
amount of money in birculatiou or available
for circulation Tho Times evidently hafe
neighbors as dense as our morning contemporary
