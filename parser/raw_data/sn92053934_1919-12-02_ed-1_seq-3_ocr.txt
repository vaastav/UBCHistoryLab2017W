GOAL RATION text of; , the president's message to congress
A clearing house for all coal
orders la another plan that officials
believe necessary to inaugurate in
order to better handle the coal sit
uation in Rock Island and the plan
may be placed in effect tomorrow.
The plan contemplates the sale of
only one week's supply to a cus
tomer. H. A. Clevenstlne, chairman of
the executive committee in charge
of the coal situation, called on
Mayor Harry M. Schrtver at the
city hall shortly before noon today
and said that he had. obtained in
formation that a number of resi
dents In the city are attempting to
duplicate orders for coal, and that
this practice should be stopped by
forming a clearing house through
which all orders shall go before
any coal is delivered by dealers. ;
The clearing house idea is also
considered necessary to avert a
possible panic due to the coal
ahortage.
It is claimed that some cititens
order coal from one dealer and
when the clal is delivered they im
mediately duplicate the order with
another dealer, and In some cases
. success has been had In obtaining
a double supply In this manner.
On the other hand, It is claimed
by Mr. Clevenstlne that a panic can
be started by such methods. He
explained that some of the dealers
have small supplies of coal and
their customers can only purchase
an amount that will not prove am
ple, and when the customer goes
to another dealer the latter be
comes suspicious of the objects of
the prospective coal purchaser and
refuses to make a sale for fear that
' the person Is attempting to hoard
a supply while the other persons
suffer..
Mayor Favors Flan.
' Mayor Schrtver declared that he
favors the plan and that be would
appoint some one to take charge
of such a clearing house In case ar-
rangements could be made with the
dealers in a way that will, eliminate
confusion. : ,
, . Can Confiscate CeaL
Mayor Schrtver asserted that in
case the situation demands, the city
' can confiscate coal from persons
attempting to board supplies. How
over, he said that this would not
affect snppUea In homes that have
.already laid In winter supply, but
fould affect all future sales. The
mayor declared that the city has
power to confiscate coal for its own
use. He cited the large amount of
coal used at the water works, an
absolutely essential plant, and said
that in like cases' the city could
commandeer coal. However, he
-aid that the situation was not so
critical that such steps are now
necessary. The water works has
coal to laat a month or six weeks
longer and has several cars coming.
The instance was pointed out by
the mayor as one In which the city
could exercise powers of confisca
tion. : Dealers Keet Tonight
: Neat Mikesell, chairman of the
T?V Ilnl anil Hffnlfn va 1 jao1.
, era' association, has notified the
dealers of a meeting to be held at
the Rock Island club tonight and
Mr. Clevensne told Mayor Schrtv
er that he would see that the clear
ing house proposition is presented
to them. In this way all persons
ordering coal will order through
the clearing house and no oppor
tunity will be open for any one to
cheat by duplicating coal orders. -
Mr. Clevenstlne said that the
matter will also be taken up in
Molina. It was also said that the
other cities in this community
might inaugurate the plan.
, Police powers of cities, it is said,
will furnish the authority to take
necessary drastic action, in the
present emergency. The state laws
provide exceptional authority in
cases of emergency through police
powers. However, the whole plan
is looked forward to as a means of
only retarding the activities of
boarders so that every Citizen can
be given equal shares of the coal
at hand.

Washington, Dee. I. President
Wilson's message to congress, de
livered at noon today, was as fol
lows: :.' -
To the Senate and House of Rep
resentatives: I sincerely regret that I can not
be present at the opening of this
session of the congress. I am thus
prevented from presenting in as
direct a way as I could wish the
many questions that are pressing
for solution at this time. Happily,
I have had the advantage of the
advice of the heads of the several
executive departments- who. have
kept In close touch with affairs In
their detail and whose, thoughtful
recommendations I earnestly sec
In the matter of the railroads
and the readjustment of their af
fairs growing out of federal con
trol, I shall take the liberty at a
later day of addressing you.
' Need for Badget , ,
I hope that congress will bring
to a conclusion at this session leg
islation looking to the establish
ment of a budget system. That
there should be one single author
ity responsible for the making of
all appropriations and that appro
priations should be made not in
dependently of each other, but with
reference to one 'single compre
hensive plan of expenditure prop
erly related to the nation's income,
there can be no doubt I believe
the burden, of preparing the budget
must in the nature of the case, it
the work is to be properly done,
and responsibility concentrated in
stead of divided, rest upon tne ex
ecutive. The budget so proposed
should be submitted to and ap
proved or amended by a single
committee of each house of con
gress, and no single appropriation
should be made by congress, ex-4
cept such as may have been Includ
ed in the budget prepared by the
executive or added by the particu
lar committee of congress charged
with the budget accomplishment. .
Another and not less important
aspect of the problem is the ascer
tainment of the economy and effi
ciency with which the moneys ap
propriated are expended. Under
existing law, the only audit is for
the purpose of ascertaining wheth
er expenditures have been lawful
ly made within tne appropriations.
No one i authorised or equipped
to ascertain whether the money
has been spent wisely, economical
ly and effectively. The auditors
should be trained officials with per
manent tenure in the treasury de
partment, free of obligations to or
motives of consideration for this
or any subsequent administration,
and authorized and empowered to
examine into and make report upon
the methods employed and the re
sults obtained by the executive de
partments of the government Their
reports should be made to the con
gress and to the secretary of the
treasury.
Future Taxation.
I trust that the congress will
give its immediate consideration to
the problem of future taxation.
Simplification of the income and of
the profit taxes has become an im
mediate necessity. These taxes per
formed indispensable service dur
ing the war. They must however,
be simplified, 'not only to save the
tax payer Inconvenience and ex
pense, but in order that his liabil
ity may be made certain and definite.
With reference to the details of
the revenue law. the secretary of
the treasury and the commissioner
of Internal revenue will lay Deiore.
you for your consideration certain
amendments' necessary or desirable
in connection with the administra
tion of the law recommendations
which have my approval and sup
port It Is of the utmost impor
tance that in dealing with this mat
ter the present law should not be
disturbed so far as regards taxes
for the calendar year 1920. payable
in the calendar year 1921. The
congress might well consider
whether the higher rates of income
and profits taxes can in peace
times be effectively productive of
revenue and' whether they may not
on the contrary, be destructive of
business activity and productive of
waste and inefficiency. There is a
point at which in peace times high
rates of Income and profits taxes
discourage energy, remove the in
centive to new enterprises, encour
age extravagant expenditures and
produce industrial stagnation with
consequent unemployment and
other attendant evils.
Hew Tariff Heeds.
The problem Is not an easy one.
A fundamental change has taken
place with reference to the position
of America In the world's affairs.
The prejudice and passions engen
dered by decades of controversy
between two schools of -political
and economic thought the one. be
lievers In protection of American
industries, the other believers in
tariff for revenue only must be
subordinated to the single consid
eration of the public interest in.
the light of utterly changed condi
tions. .
Before the war America was
heavily the debtor of the rest of the
world and the Interest payments
she had to make to foreign, coun
tries noon American securities held
abroad, the expenditures of Amer
ican travelers abroad, and the ocean
freiaht charxea she had to pay to
others, about balanced the value
of her ore-war favorable balance of
trade. During the war America's
exports have been greatly stimu
lated and increased prices nave in
creased their value. On the other
hand she has purchased a large
proportion of the American securi
ties previously new aoroaa, nss
loaned some 11,000.000,000 to for
eign governments, and has built
her own ships. Our favorable bal
ance of trade has thus been greatly
Increased and Europe has been de
prived of the means of meeting It
heretofore existing.
Europe can have only three ways
of meeting the favorable balance
ot trade in peace times: by Imports
into this country of gold or ot
goods, or by establishment of new
credits.-. Europe. is in no position
at the present time, to ship gold to
us nor could wo contemplate large
further imports of gold into this
country without concern. -
The time has nearly passed for
international . governmental loans
and it will take time to develop la
this country a market for foreign !
securities. Anything, therefore.
which would tend to prevent for
eign countries from settling lor our
exports by shipments of goods Into
this country could only nave tne ei
fect of preventing them from pay
tng for our exports and therefore
of preventing the exports from be
ing made. The productivity oi ue
country, greatly stimulated by the
war. must fad an outlet by exports
to foreign countries and any meas
ures taken to prevent imports win
inevitably curtail exports, force
curtailment of production, load the
banking, machinery , of the country
with credits to carry unsold prod
ucts and produce industrial stag
nation and unemployment If we
want to sell, we must be prepared
to buy. , . -
Whatever, therefore, may have
been our views during the period of
growth of American business con
cerning tariff legislation, we must
now adjust our own economic life
to a changed condition growing out
of the fact that American business
is full grown and that America is
the greatest capitalist in the world.
No policy of Isolation will satisfy
the growing needs and opportuni
ties of America.- The provincial
standards and policies of the past,
which Have held American business
as if in a straight Jacket must yield1
and give way to the needs and ex
igencies oi tne new aar in wnicn
we Jive, a day full of hope and
promise, for American business, if
we will but take advantage of the
opportunities that are for -the ask
ing. The recent war has ended
our isolation and thrown upon us a
great duty and responsibility. The
Umted States must snare the ex
panding world market The United
States desires for itself only equal
opportunity with the other, nations
of the world, and that through only
equal opportunity with the other
nation of the world, and that
through the process of friendly co
operation and fair competition the
legitimate interests of the nations
concerned may be Successfully and
equitably adjusted, i
Belief for Soldiers.
There are other matters of Im
portance upon which I urged ac
tion at the last session ot congress,
which are still pressing for- solu
tion. I am sure it is not necessary
for me again to remind you that
there is one immediate and very
practicable question resulting from
the war which we should meet in
the most liberal spirit It is a mat
ter of recognition and relief to our
velop our forest resources, espe
cially through the practice ot bet
ter forestry methods on private
noidings and the extension of the
publicly owned forests; better sup
port foe country echols and the
more definite direction of their
courses or study along lines re
lated to rural problems; and fuller
provision for sanitation in rural
districts and the building up of
needed hospital and medical facul
ties in these localities. Perhaos
the way mght be cleared for many
ot these desirable reforms by a
fresh, comprehensive survey made
of rural conditions by a conference
composes of representatives of the
farmers and the agricultural agen
cies responsible for leadership.
Cause of Unrest
I would call your attention to the
widespread condition of political
restleesness ini our body politic.
The causes of this unrest while
various -and complicated, are sup
erficial rather than deep seated.
Broadly, they arise from or arc
connected with the failure on the
part of our government to arrive
speedily at a Just and permanent
peace permitting jreturn to normal
conditions, from the transfusion of
radical theories from seething
European centers pending such de
lay, from heartless profiteering re
sulting in the Increase of the cost
of living, and lastly, from the
machinations of -passionate and
malevolent agitators. - With the
return to normal 'conditions, this
unrest will rapidly disappear.
In the meantime, "it does much
evil. It seems to me that in deal
ing with this situation congress
should not be Impatient or drastic
but should seek rather to remove
the causes. It -should fendeavcr
to bring our country back speed
ily to a peace basis, with ameliorated-living
conditions under the
minimum of restrictions upon per
sonal liberty that is consistent
with our reconstruction problems.
And it should arm the federal gov
ernment with power to deal in its
criminal courts with those persons
who by violent methods would
abrogate our time tested institu
tions. With the free expression ot opin
ion and with the advocacy of or
derly - political change, however
fundamental, there must be no in
terference, but. towards passion
and malevolence tending to incite
crime- and insurrection under
guise of political evolution there
should he no leniency.. Legislation
to this end has been recommended
by the attorney general and should
aoMini-H t mn An no hpttpr than i be enacted. In this direct connec-
to quote from my last message urg-1 tion, I would call your attention to
ing this very action
"We must see to it that our re
turning soldiers are assisted in
every practicable way to find the
places for which they are fitted in
the daily work ot the country. This
cad.be done by developing and
maintaining upon an adequate
scale the admirable organization
created by the department of labor
for placing men seeking work; and
it can also be doneln at least one
very great field, by creating new
opportunities for individual enter
prises.
. The secretary ot the Interior has
pointed out the way by which re
turning soldiers may be helped to
find and take up land in the hither
ton undeveloped regions of the
country which the federal govern
ment has already prepared or can
readily prepare for cultivation, and
also on many ot tne cut-over or
neglected areas which lie within
the limits of the older states; and
I once more take the liberty of
recommending very urgently that
his plans shall receive the immed
iate and substantial support of the
congress."
, Protect Dye Industry.
In the matter of tariff legislation,
I beg to call your attention to the
statements contained in my last
message, urging legislation with
reference to the establishment of a
chemical and dyestuff Industry la
America.
"Among the industries to which
special consideration should te
given Is that ot the manufacture ot
dyesjtuffs and related chemicals.
our complete dependence -upon
Germany supplies before the war
made the Interruption of trade a
cause oi exceptional economic ais
turbance. The close relation be
tween the manufacturer of dye-
stuff.! on the one hand, and ot ex
plosives and poisonous gases, on the
other, moreover, has given the in
dustry an exceptional significance
and value. Although the United
States will gladly and unhestatini;-
ly Join in the program of interna
tional disarmament it will never
theless, be a policy of obvious prud
ence to make certain of the essen
tial maintenance ot many strong
and well equipped chemical plants.
The German chemical Industry,
with which we will be brought into
competition, was and may well be
again thoroughly knit moaopoly
capable of exercising a competition
of a peculiarly insidious and dan
gerous kind."
Reward for Fanner.
During the war, the farmer per
formed a vital and willing service
to the nation. By materially in
creasing the production of his land,
he supplied America and the allies
with the increased amounts of food
necessary to keep their .immense
armies in the field. He indispens
ably helped to win the war. But
there is now scarcely less need ot
increasing the production in food
and the necessaries of life. I ask
the congress to consider means of
encouraging effort along 'these
lines. The Importance of doing
everything possible to promott pro
duction along economical lints, to
Improve marketing, and to make
rural life more attractive! and
healthful, is obvious. I would
urge approval of the plans already
proposed to the congress by the
secretary of agriculture, to secure
the essential facts required for the
proper study of this question,
through the proposed enlarged pro
grams for farm management Stud
ies and crop estimates.
I would urge, also, the conflnv
anc ot federal participation in, the
building of good roads, under the
terms of existing law and unW
the direction of present agencfes:
the need of further action on (fee
part of the states and the federal
government to preserve ana fe
rny recommendations on . Aug. 8,
pointing out legislative measures
which would be effective in con
trolling' and bringing down the
present cost of living, which 'con
tributes so largely to this unrest
On only one of these recommenda
tions has the congress acted. If
the government's campaign is to be
effective' it is necessary, that the
other steps . suggested snould ' be
acted on at once.
; Food Central. U
I renew and strongly urge the
necessity of the extension of. the
present food control act as to the
period of time In which It shall
remain in operation. The attorney
general has submitted a bill pro
viding for an extension, of this act
for a period of six months. As It
now stands it la limited In opera
tion to th period of the war and
becomes Inoperative upon, the for
mal proclamation of peace. It is
Imperative .that it should be ex
tended at once. The department ot,
Justice has built up effective ma
chinery for the enforctng of - Its
provisions; all - of which- must be
abandoned noon the conclusion of
peace unless the provisions ot this
act are extended. ; ,
During this period, the congress
will have an opportunity to make
similar permanent provisions and
regulations with regard to all
goods destined for Interstate com
merce and to exclude them from in
terstate shipment, it the require
ments ot the law. are not complied
with. Some such regulation is im
peratively necessary. - The abuses
that have grown up in the manipu
lation of prices by the withholding
ot foodstuffs and other necessaries
of life can dot otherwise be effec
tively prevented. There can be no
doubt of either the necessity or the
legitimacy ot such measures.
As I pointed out In my last mes
sage, publicity can accomplish a
great deal in this campaign. - The
aims of the government must be
clearly brought to the attention of
the consuming public, civic organi
sations and state officials, who are
in a position to lend their assist
ance to our efforts. You have made
available funds with which to
carry on this campaign but there
is ho provision in the law author
izing their expenditure for the
making ot the public Informed
about the efforts ot the govern
ment Specific recommendation
has been made by the attorney gen
eral in this regard. I - would
strongly urge upon you its immed
iate adoption, as it constitutes one
of the preliminary steps to this
campaign.
. Cold Storage.
I also renew my recommenda
tion that the congress pass a law
regulating cold storage as it is
regulated, for example, by the laws
of the state ot New Jersey, which
limit the time during which goods
may be kept in storage,: prescribe
the method of disposing of them
if kept beyond the permitted per
iod and require goods that are re
leased from storage shall in all
cases bear the date of : their re
ceipt It would materially add to
the serviceability of the law, for
the purpose we now have in view,
if it were also prescribed that all
goods released from storage for in
terstate shipment should have
plainly marked upon each pack
age the selling or market price at
which they went into storage. By
this means the purchaser would
always be able to learn what prof
its stood between him and the pro
ducer or the wholesale dealer.
I would also renew my recom
mendation- that all goods destined
tor interstate commerce should in
every case.' where their form
package' makes it', possible, - be
plainly marked with the price at
which they left the hands of the
producer. .
Competitive Selling.
We should formulate a law re
quiring a federal license of all cor
porations engaged in interstate
commerce -sad embodying in the
license, or in the condition under
which it is to be issued, specific
regulations designed to secure
competitive selling and prevent
unconscionable profits in the meth
ods oi marketing. Such a law
would afford a welcome oport un
ity to effect other such needed re
forms in the business ot interstate
shipment and in the methods of
corporations which are engaged in
It; but tor the moment I confine
my recommendations to the objec
tion immediately in hand, which is
to lower, the . cost of living.
Labor Conditions.
No one who has observed the
march of events in the last year
can tail to note the absolute need
of a' definite program to bring
about an improvement in the con
dition ot labor. There can be no
settled conditions leading to in
creased production and a reduction
in the cost of living if labor and
capital are to be antagonistic in
stead ot being partners.
Sound thinking and an honest
desire to serve the interests of the
whole nation, as distinguished
from the interests of a class, must
be applied to the solution of this
great and pressing problem. The
failure ot other nations to consider
this matter In a vigorous way has
produced bitterness and Jealousies
and antagonism, the food ot radi
calism. ... .
The only way to keep men from
agitating against grievances is to
remove the grievances. An unwill
ingness even to discuss these mat
ters produces only dissatisfaction
and gives comfort to the extreme
elements in our country which en
deavors to stir up disturbances in
order to provoke governments to
embark upon a course ot retalia
tion and repression. The seed of
revolution is repression. The
remedy for these things must not
be negative In character. It must
be constructive. It must compre
hend the general interest The real
antidote for the unrest which mani
festo itself is not suppression but
a deep consideration of the wrongs
that beset our national life and
the application ot a remedy.
congress has already shown its
willingness to deal with these in
dustrial wrongs by establishing the
eignt nour day as the standard in
every field of labor. It has sought
to find a way to prevent child
labor. It has served the whole
country by leading the way in de
veloping the means of preserving
ana sate guarding lives and health
in dangerous industries. It must
now help In the difficult task of
finding a method that will brina-
about genuine demoralization ot
industry, based upon the full rec
ognition ot the right of those who
work, to whatever rank, to partici
pate in some organic way in every
decision which discreetly affects
their welfare. It Is with this pur
pose in nuna mat i called a con
ference to meet in Washington cn
Dec 1. to consider these pro blurs
in all their broad aspects, with the
idea of bringing about a better un
derstanding between these two in
terests. -
i The great unrest throughout the
World, out of which has emerged a
demand for an immediate consid
eration of the difficulties between
capital and labor, bids us put our
own house in order. Frankly,
there can - be no permanent and
lasting settlements between capital
and labor 'which do not recognize
the fundamental concepts for
which labor has been struggling
throughout the years. The whole
world gave its recognition and en
dorsement to . these fundamental
purposes in the League ot Nations.
'The statesmen gathered at Ver
sailles recognized the tact that
world stability could not be had by
reverting to industrial standards
aad conditions against which the
average workman ot the world had
revolted. It is. therefore, the tank
ot the statesmen of this new day ot
change and readjustment to recoc
nize world conditions and to seek
to bring about through legisla
tion conditions that will mean the
ending of age long antagonisms be
tween capital and- labor and that
will hopefully lead to the building
up or a comradeship which will re.
suit not only in greater content
ment among the mass of workmen
but also bring about a greater pro
duction and a greater prosperity to
business itself.
To analyze the particulars in the
demands of labor Is to admit the
Justice of their complaint in many
matters that lie at their basis. The
workman demands an adequate
wage, sufficient to permit him to
live in comfort unhampered by the
fear of poverty and want in his old
age. He demands the right to live
and the right to work amidst sani
tary surroundings, both in home
and in workshop, surroundings
that develop and do not retard his
own health and well being, and the
right to provide for his children's
wants in the matter of health and
education. In other words it is his
desire to make the conditions ot his
life and the lives of those dear to
him tolerable and easy to bear.
The establishment of principles
regarding labor laid down in the
covenant of the League of Nations
offered us the way to industrial
peace and conciliation.. No other
road lies open to us. Not to pur
sue this. one is longer to invite
enmities, bitterness and antagon
isms, which in the end only lead
to industrial and social disaster.
The unwilling workman is not a
profitable servant
An employe whose Industrial
life is hedged, about by hard and
unjust conditions, wnicn ne did not
create and over which he has no
control, lacks that fine spirit of en
thusiasm and volunteer effort
which are the necessary ingred
ients of a great producing entity.
Let us be frank about this solemn
matter. The evidences of world
wide unrest which manifest them
selves In violence throughout the
world bids us pause and consider
the means to be found to stop the
spread of this contagious thing be
fore ti saps the very vitality of the
nation itself. Do we gain strength
by withholding the remedy? Is it
not the business -of the 'Statesmen
to treat these manifestations of un
rest which Is on every hand with
evidences with an economic disor-1
der and apply constructive methods
wherever necessary, being sure
