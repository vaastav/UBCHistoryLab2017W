"The 14th of December will
be the one hundredth anniver
sary of the death of Washington.
For one hundred years the
republic has had the priceless ad
vantage of the lofty standard of
character and conduct which he
bequeathed to the American peo
ple. It is an inheritance which
time, instead of wasting, continu
ally increases and enriches. We
may justly hope that in the years
to come the benignant influence of
the father of his country may be
even more potent for good than in
the century which is drawing to a
close. I have been glad to learn
that in many parts of the country
the people will fittinlgy observe
this historic anniversary." Presi
dent McKinley's Message.
Elsewhere in this issue is printed a
copious extract of Hon. Wendell P.
Stafford's address on the Philippines
at Bellows Falls on Dec. 2. It is full
of patriotic utterances and com
manded the closest attention during
its delivery. The St. Albans Messen
ger and the Rutland News, and pos
sibly some other papers, have inti
mated that oratory and eloquence
do not count in Congress, but the
average Vermonter knows better
and as a sample of the style and
patriotism of Mr. Stafford we sub
mit the resume of his recent
Bellows Falls address. It has been
many a year since Vermont has had
a congressional candidate so eloquent
in address, so scholarly in thought,
and so learned in our national
history and it is no wonder that his
candidacy is attracting wide atten
tion and growing in strength.

An Error of Judgment.
Our friend Editor Ropes of the
Watchman is getting excited early in
the campaign. He is evidently much
disturbed over our comments last
week on the senatorial situation,
and among other extravagant things
intimates that the article in last
week's Caledonian was written by
Gen. Grout. We had not supposed
m .....
it so able as to warrant that sus-
picion, but the green eyes of the
Montpelier editor see Gen. Grout in
..
everything
This naoer is not edited from
Washington and the only Washing
ton correspondent we have signs ini
tials to the letters. The editorials
that appear in this paper are the
creations of the editor's brain and
the imaginations of our contempo
rary are somewhat amusing as well
as flattering.
Out of his imagination, also, he
magnifies Mr. Prouty's candidacy,
which he gravely tells his readers
threaten's Gen. Grout's lines in the
northeast. Everyone in this part of
the state knows that this is all
moonshine, but the visionary editor
of the Watchman thinks it is true or
he would not say so. We cannot
better dismiss this vagary than by
saying, "Wait and see."

This is the first time in thenation's
history that this high position, now
universally considered the second
office in power under our govern
ment, has cone to a state west of
the Mississippi, and the fact is sig
nificant of the crowing influence of
the region tributary to that great
river valley in the rule of the United
States. New York Evening Post.
It is interesting to observe that
among the distinguished counsel
engaged in fighting the war tax on
inheritances in the United States
supreme court are John G. Carlisle
and Thomas B. Keed. These ex-
speakers are looking out for them
selves and their clients now, instead
of for the government. Probably
they are better paid for it. Boston

The message of the President is a

and temperate narrative of

requirement of the constitution that
he "give to the Congres informa
tion of the state of the Union," and
its recommendations are likewise

A failure on the part of England
to win the war with the Boers
would mark the first falsjty of a

the battles are fought and the sieges
maintained must in the end be the
loser Cincinnati Times Star.
Among the list of prospective can
didates mentioned for congressional
honors in the Second district is the
name of Porter II. Dale, of Island
Pond. Just how Mr. Dale looks
upon the question of his candidacy
is only a matter of conjecture, as he
has never expressed himself publicly
upon this subject, so far as we can
discover. That he would balance
equally well in the scales with the
other candidates for this office there
is but little room to doubt. A bitter
fight will be waged against Col.
Haskins from certain counties in the
district, and the same bitter fight
will be waged against Wendell P.
Stafford from other counties. The
counties of Essex and Orleans are
liable to oscillate between the two.
Should Porter II Dale with his
numerousfnends throughout the dis-
trict, and against whom no flaw can
be found, consent to be a candidate
for second district congressional
honors, we believe he would not only
be heartily endorsed by his own
countv and that of Orleans, but
would receive a strong following in
the other counties. The question for
Mr. Dale to answer is, "Are you in

(From our regular correspondent.)
Congress opened with an unusual
ly large concourse of people in atten
dance; it was thought that there
were over 20,000 people in and out
side of the Capitol seeking entrance
upon Monday, Dec. 4. A large pro-
portion were women, who felt that
the cause of woman and home were
at stake in the Bngham Robert s
case, and they were eager to obtain
entrance to the House but all of the
seats were reserved for the first two
days for members and their friends,
hence the public at large wereexclud
ed, which raised a storm of criticism
among the people who wondered if
Consress was intended onlv for re.
presentatives, their families and
friends. The question was asked.
have the tax-payers of the country
any rights and privileges or are we
drifting on to monarchy. Two
years ago a southern member
brought in eleven women, including
his wife, for reserved seats in the
gallery, and he was not a Mormon
Several such infringements of mem
hers' rights led them to divide the
seats equally among the members.
The door-keeper reported that each
representative received this year
only three seats.
The Robert's case has been referred
to a special committee, with Chair
man Taylor who represents the re
publicans, and Representative Rich
ardson, the leader of the minority
(democrats) to bring out the two
sides of the case. Roberts is a very
persistent, obstinate man and in
tends to fight it out to the bitter
end. Immense rolls of anti-Roberts'
petitions were brought into Con-
grtss, which Koberts ridiculed a9
those of Sunday schools and thinks
his case should go to the judiciary
cotnruittee He accused the Presi-
, r . . ,

were charged with polygamy, to life

pointedly asked, "Were they guilty ?"

income of $13,000,000 per year; a
poor man when he went west and in
vested in lands which have proved
to have invaluable mines. Senator
Frye filled the late Vice President's
chair. The House has been deluged
with bills of all descriptions. A bill
for a Trans-Pacific Cable has been
introduced by Representative Corliss
of Michigan to be built to Hawaii,
Japan and China and the Philippines
by the government at a cost of $,-
000,000. Senator Chandler of New
Hampshire wishes to have free trade
between the islands of Porto Rico
and Cuba in 1900.
Dr. S. H. Green of the Calvary
Baptist church, received a handsome
den d him by his church and congre-
gation on tne twentietn anniversary.
He came here from Northern Ver
mont a vounc. fresh, theological stu
dent to a church burdened by debt
and his success has been most phe
nominal, in building up a great
church and he has the largest Sun
day school in the city and one that
interests many to visit. He richly
deserved the many encomiums of
praise received. The 50th anniver
sary of the pastorate of Dr. J. G.
Butler of the Luther Memorial church
was held at the Arlington hotel,
when '250 guests consisting of sena
tors, representatives and prominent
citizens- participated. The church
has a very five statue of Martin
Luther in front of it.
Justice Brewer of the Supreme
Court who is something of a wit did
not know why the Supreme Court
never had had a chaplain, whether
it was because they were too good
or too bad but all united in pro
claiming Dr. Butler a power for good
in restraining evil in his six years as
a chaplain in the House and nearly
that in the Senate. The Masons will
celebrate the death of George
Washington on Dec. 14 at Mt.
Vernon, when 50 lodges will
probably take part and President
McKinley is expected to make the
address, as the 25th successor in
office. The Great Council of Red
Men of the United States not to con
flict with the other organization will
observe the lOOtanniversary in the
anernoon when a wreath ot oak and
evergreen sent from Yorkshire, Eng
land, by the Earl of Londesborough
Park, will be placed on the tomb of
Washington, John Washington, the
founder of the family having come
from that vicinity. A poem also
will be read, written by the rector of
the Earl, and the Prince of Wales,
Master Mason in England has sent
a letter of regrets to the other so
ciety. Chauncey Depew has been in
vited to deliver the oration in the
evening in Convention Hall and Con
gress is expected to be largely repre
sented. The marine band and the
Abyon Society will furnish music.
The different chapters of the D. A
R. society of Washington gave a two
days' entertainment at Rauscher's
upon Thursday and Friday after
noon and evening for the Memorial
Hall fund. Manv 01 the ladies were
dressed in colonial costumes and
there was an interesting loan collec
tion of historic articles. The tickets
were one dollar for each session.
Miss Pierce, of Boston, niece of Mrs
J. liiien roster, and others sang
charmingly. Miss Pierce sang by
request, the well-known song ' The
Pilgrim Fathers," which was highly
appreciated. There were six tab
leaux, "She was justly proud of her
ancestors," "Ancient and Modern
Courtesy" and "The New Woman."
The latter was quite effective. A
young girl mounted on her bicycle
while the old courtiers of George
Washington's time looked on with
astonishment and holy horror.
The first of the two lectures to be
given on "The Philippines and the
tar bast," before the National ueo
graphic Society attracted a large
andience because the lecturer, Hon.
John Barrett, had been the United
States minister to Siam four years
and had also traveled extensively in
China, Japan, Siberia, Borneo, Java,
Uurman and visited tbe Philippines
when Admiral Dewey was there, all
of which made his opinions and ideas
exceedingly interesting. He consid
ered it from a practical material
standpoint. He visited those coun
tries and studied the question to
learn what opportunities they af
forded for American trade. He con
sidered Manila a location ot great
importance and an ideal center for a
new Oriental capital, for Hong Kong
only 630 miles distant, has an an
nual trade of $250,000. He had
consulted experts and agents of
steam and mail ships and he felt that
it was destined to become an "Asia
tic terminal." He enlarged upon its
strategetic importance. He thought
that tbe $20,000,000 paid for those
islands a small amount if we develop
its resources. Supposing that we
should build 1500 to 2000 miles of
railway at a cost of 75 million of dol
lars these figures now seem some
what optimistic but be thought
that our trade with the Orient had
increased since we have become pro
minent in these possessions. He con-
siders that Aguinaldo ha9 some exe
cutive ability but lacks stability of
character. lie advocates permanent
sovereignty over the Philippines.
The second lecture is to be given by
Prof. Dean C. Worcester of "I be
Philippine Commission." He is a
native of Vermont and the son of Dr.
Ezra Worcester of Thetford, and his
lecture will be anticipated with
pleasure. A. M. C.

A notable feature of the Outlook
for December 2d is an article called
"Through Filipino Eyes." This is
an authorized interview with the
President of the Filipino Junta at
Hong Kong, obtained by Phelps

Springfield Republican
All Independent JNeWSpaper
FOR AMERICAN PRINCIPLES
OPPOSED TO IMPERIALISM
FAITHFUL TO THE PEOPLE'S INTERESTS
AN ABLE, INTERESTING JOURNAL.
ESTABLISHED IN 1824 BY SAnUEL BOWLES
The Republican was established 75 years ago
to publish the news fully, fairly, truthfully,
and to sustain and extend democratic prin
ciples. It is still faithful to its original
high mission.
The Republican gives the news of opinion as
well as of fact in a broad and catholic
spirit. It presents all of its news in attrac
tive, convenient and Interesting form. It
carefully studies and conscientiously serves
the interests of its readers.
The Republican firmly believes in the Amer
ican principles of government and society.
It docs not doubt that through democracy
are the people to attain the largest practi
cable measure of happiness and well-being;
not alone the people of the United States,
but gradually, ultimately all the peoples of
the earth. It is opposed to imperialism
and militarism, to the domination of
wealth and aristocracy. It sees in the pur
chase and conquest of the Philippine is
lands new evidence of the unceasing effort
of incorporated and syndicated wealth to
conduct national affairs in the selfish inter
est of a class at the expense of the great
body of the people.
ine KepuQiican nas proiouna taitti that a
larger prosperity, a greater power and
wider influence are to be attained for the
United States by a strict adherence to our
traditional principles in the home govern
ment and in foreign relations, than by an
imitation of the policies and methods of
the European monarchies. It believes in
the expansion of our commerce everywhere,
and of our domain over contiguous tcrri
...
tory, Dy peacetul and natural processes.
To the advancement of these ideas The Re
publican dedicates itself anew in this time
of the republic's peril from misguided foes
in its own household.
The general features of The Republican are
interesting and valuable. Its editorial
page is strong, progressive and comprehen
sive. Liberal attention is given to litera
ture. The special correspondence Is of a
high character. The Sunday Republican is
especially rich .in fiction, instructive
sketches, poetry, special articles and mis
cellaneous reading of excellent quality. It
is in effect a first clnss weekly magazine as
well as a superior newspaper. The Weekly
Republican is an admirable news, political
and family paper combined. It is carefully
edited and arranged and furnishes the best
editorials and general features from the
Daily and Sunday issues, with a full review
of the current news. It is especially valu
able for New Bnglanders at home or
abroad who cannot take the Daily.
