MESSA
As Read Before Congress at
Hie Opening Session.
SUMMARY OF SALIENT POINTS
Document Deals at CJrcat Length
With the Situation In China,
The Philippines and Cuba.
Vital Questions Fully
Considered.
The message of William McKinley,
president of the United States of
America, delivered to the last session
of the fifty-sixth congrets Monday,
contains more than 20,000 words and
deals with questions of vital impor
tance to 'the present administration
and to the American people It is a
document tersely written, full of de
tail and emphatic in suggestion.
The message deals principally with
the Chinese situation, the future
policy in the Philippines, the govern
ment of Cuba, the building of the
Nicaragua canal, a construction of a
cable to Hawaii and Manila, the basis
of a standing army, the extension of
commercial relations with foreign
countries, a suggestion to overthrow
the trusts and a positive but liberal
policy at home.
Mr. McKinley urges the construc
tion of better cable connection with
foreign countries, better postal facili
ties at home and abroad. lie roasts
lynching and declares that punish
ment to the guilty must be imposod
by the courts and not by mobs. lie
is opposed to the liquor trade in coun
tries where the inhabitants are unciv
ilized. He asks that sufficient protec
tion be given alien citizens in the
United States and that an indemnity
be paid for the lynching of live Ital
ians in Louisiana and the lynchers be
punished, and that federal jurisdiction
be given in such matters bo as to in
sure the punishment of offenders
against liberty and life and for the
protection of foreigners sojourning
within our borders.
The message fully reviews the Chi
nese muddle, giving a graphic ac
count of the siege of the legation in
Fekin and their memorable defense.
He applauds the heroism of the Amer
ican relieving force and reiterates
that the United States is not at war
with China and never has been. In
dealing with the Chinese situation he
suggests that the open door policy
should figure and that sufficient guar
antee of personal safety should be ex
tended Americans in China.
A considerable portion of the mes
sage ia devoted to the Paris exposition
and the good results accruing from
the exhibits made by this country at
the fair.
The president is delighted that not
withstanding the intricacies of the
South African war, the friendship with
Great Britain has never become es
tranged and the United States and
England are still enjoying the most
cordial relations, with a future replete
with promised continuance.
The inter-ocean canal project meets
with his hearty aonroval and h m.
views the present situation in Nicara-'
gua witn pleasure.
Our relations with Spain, despite
the late war, are cordial, and the
president urges that the
to it that peace and good will between !
me iwo countries is maintained in the
future. Certain indemnities are rec
ommended to be paid Spain.
The government of the United States
is still waiting for. the Saltan of Tur
key to make adequate reparation for
the Armenian outrages and the re
building of the college at narpoot.
The piesident is assured of the good
will of Turkey, notwithstanding the
present complications.
The Buffalo exposition and the
Mexican congress are given attention,
and the general plan of displaying the
resources of the government meets
with the president's approval and en
dorsement. Quite a portion of the message is de-!
voieu io me expenses of the army and
navy and figures are given showing a
more economical administration of af
fairs in these departments'.
The refunding act, the president de
clares, has greatly benefited the cir
culation of our government.
The imports and exports have ex
ceeded by millions the records of the
past.
The president suggests the reduction
of the war revenue and the upbuilding
of American shipping.
More attention is giveu to tho Phil
ippine situation than any other subject
" I'voiutui iuhj uuuijius ma

forcement of tho United states. Tho
Filipinos are to select their municipal
and executive fileors, but they mtmt
be loyul to the wirdies sad lawn of thii
country. He suggests an extension of
the nchool fncilini-s, with" free primary
institutes and the lnption of a uni

guage. Tho law are to bo conserva
tive, just and equitable; taxes nro not
to be t xeoHsive an 1 no burdens are to
bo indicted upon tho people which can
bo avoided. The trcitty of Paris as to
property rights taunt be upheld.
In other word?, the policy ns out
lined for the people of the Philippines
will secure to tho nation tho advant
ages of tho government of the United
States, with all the rights and privi
leges of Relf-govorumerit, just as soon
as tho natives show themselves capa
ble of governing themselves.
The president's idea is that tho
islands have been pacified, save for
the guerilla warfare, aud he believes
that an army of 13,000 natives will in
a short time bring peace in all the
group, w ill insure oafety to lives and
property and will secure a vast increase
in business.
Until the islands are thoroughly
pacified the military governor is the
highest authority, acting under tho
orders and jurisdiction of the Taft
commission, but when peace is finally
brought about a civil government must
be administered.
The message reviews at considera
ble length the progresss that has been
made in Cuba towards bringing about
a self-government for the people.
The president cites many instances
to show that we are at peaoe with all
tho world and that annually our corn
men a 1 and our social relations are
iucrettsiug in cordiality.
Gradually the commerce of the
United States with our South Ameri
can neighbors is improving asd the
future is replete with promies.
An army of 00,000 men is recom
mended, the president to be empowered
to increase to 100,000 if emergency
should demand.
Within the last four years, GO,000,
000 have been paid for improved coast
defenses, requiring an army of 26,000
men for garrison "duty. Tho message
reviews the improving along this line
and gives many interesting details of
what has been accomplished.
The progress made in the extension
of the rural mail system aud the bet
tering of the postal system meets with
the approval of the president and he
urges the congress not to neglect this
important branch of the government.
A civil service is promised the Fili
pinos, under the Taft commission.
A recommendation is made that all
the heroic acts in both army and navy
should be regarded and that tho ap
preciation of the government should
be shown individual members of the
army and navy who have done valiant
service; especially, to the volunteers
who remained in the Philippine ser
vice after their term of enlistment had
expired.
Pensions, too, are talked about, and
the president expresses the desire that
aged, maimed and infirm soldiers and
seamen shall be supported liberally.
Reference is made to the great
strides Hawaii has- recently made and
the president declares that peace and
prosperity reigns on the island. He
recommends the building of a cable to
Hawaii, which, in time, is to be ex
tended to Manila and to be owned and
controlled exclusively by the United
States.
Attention is paid" the compilation of
the United States census and liberal
applause is given the census bureau
for its faithful work.
The agricultural statistics show a
remarkable progress throughout the
entire country.
In closing the message, the presi
dent urges that in this era of pros
perity, we Bhould not become ex
travagant, but should administer the
affairs of the country economically
and conservatively, cutting expendi
tures wherever possible, but not to the
detriment of the public good.
OFFICIAL VOTE OF TEXAS.
The Certainty of Bryan' Victory In the
Stat Caused Apathy.
A special from Austin says: The
secretary of state has completed the
task of counting the votes cast in
Texas for the presidential electors on
November Cth and finds results for the
three leading tickets as follows: Dem
cratic votes 207,432 ; Republican 121,
173; Populists 21,100. The vote falls
110,270 short of the one cast four years
ago, due to the fact that it was conce
ded that the state was going for Bryan
and little interest was manifested in
the election.
NICHOLAS SHOWS IMPROVEMENT.
Kulerof the Ilumtlam Simula Good Chance

A special from Sr. Petersburg says:
Information received through private
sources fully confirms the recent fa
vorable bulletins regarding the czar's
health. His majesty has made such
genuine improvement that his condi
tion seems to promise certain recovery.

The ordinary every-day lifo of most of our women is a
ceaselesa treadmill of work. , .
How much, harder the daily tasks become when pome
derangement of the female organs makes every movement
painful and keeps the nervous system all unstrung I
One day she is wretched and utterly miserable ; in a day
or two sho is better and laughs at her fears, thinking there
is nothing much the matter after all ; but before night the
deadly backache reappears, the limbs tremble, the lips twitch
it seems as though all the imps of Satan were clutching
her vitals ; 6he goes to pieces and is flat on her back.
No woman ought to arrive at this terrible state of
misery, because these symptoms are a sure forerunner of
womb troubles. She must remember that Lydia E. Pink
ham's Vegetable Compound is almost an infallible cure
for all female ills, such as irregularity of periods, which cause
weak stomach,. sick headache, etc.. displacements and in
flammation of the womb, or any ol the multitudes of ill
nesses which beset the female organism.

inflammation, congestion and falling of the womb,
and inflammation of the ovaries. I underwent local

two months, the doctor gave me permission to go
back to work. I went back, but in less than a week
was compelled to give up and go to bed. On break
