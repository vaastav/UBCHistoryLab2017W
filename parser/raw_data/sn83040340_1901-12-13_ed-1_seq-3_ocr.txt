When a Kcduetlon in Made Clialt'ee
Thinks it Shonld Consist of a
Concentration
Washington, Dec. 0, The war de
partment toduy made public the Urst
annul report of Major General Adna
It. Chaffee, military governor of tho
Phtllipplne Islands. General Chaffee
sinus up the situation in the Philip
pines from a military point of view by
stating that tho provlncoi of Batnn
gas and Lacuna, In Luzon, and tho
Iwlands of Snmar, Mlndoro, Cobu and
Hohol constitute tho urea now dis
turbed by any embodied forco of in
surgents, lie says that to tho physi
cal character of tho country, to tho
naturo of tho wolfaro of tho robols,
who aro amlngo and foe In tho self

trooops, which Is taken ndvantago of
hy tho robols and tho Inhabitants who
sympathize with them, und to tho fear
f assassination on tho nart of friend'
ly disposed or uutlYes, if they givo profits
information to tho American forces, money
in uuo tno prolongation or the guerilla
warfare.
Commonting upon tho plan of gradu
ally replacing military with civil
administration, General Chatleo
says:
"The withdrawal of Interference
with cWll affairs does not contemplate
withdrawal of tho troops from tholr
stations to any considerable extent:
u tho contrary, this should not be
dono hastily, and when undertaken
should bo gradually and more In tho
iiaturo of concentration than reduction
of forco or abandonment of any con
siderable area of territory."
ire, therefore, recommends that
there be no further material reduction
of troops beforo Jununry, 1903. Tho
civil governments which ure being
organised provincial and munlcl
pal Goneral Chtffeo says, aro both
new and untried, and thero Is but one
rortaln and rellablo method of ascer
taining tho progress of the Filipinos
self-government, nntnoly, observation
by tho army.JjJOn tho subject of tho
military government of tho city of
Manila, General Chaffee says:
"In tho government of Manila for
throo yoars, iftho mllltay have done
Bothing more, it is everywheie appar
ent that an excellent foundation has
been laid and a turbulent and hostile
community brought to observe tho
laws, andjjlndividually bo orderly;
this has been Idone without unduo
harshness or sovorlty of treatment of
tho Inhabitants."
A FLUB It Y IN GRAIN
Corn and Wheat aro lloth Goto up
up Rapidly
Kansas City, Deo. 0. The wovo of
speculation in grnln reached a new
high mark yesterday, and prices ad
vanced all around. Corn In Kansas
City sold for soventy cents a bushel,
both for cur lots on track and for
May delivery. Oats sold for fifty
oonts. Theso extraordinary prices
uioun that there is a much greater defi
ciency of feeding stulfs In the south
west than tho average board of trade
man has any idoa of. Tho new corn
movoment is under way, but lnstcud
of coming to market in largo enough
quantities to cuuso a drop in prices
tho market goes on advancing with
country speculators still buying it and
feeders of live stock grabbing for it as
if each day's receipts were the last
they would get a chance to buy. Corn
advunced nearly two cents In Kunsus
City yesterday, und held a cent of the
gain. Thero was a rise of oho nnd a
half cent In the Chicago market, half
of which was held at tho clone.
Tho scarcity and high price of corn
has prompted tho country traders to
buy wheut becuuse It is relatively so
much choupor thnn corn, ami because
tho farmers In the winter wheat states
are using many million bushels of
wheat in pluco of corn to feed live
stock. Many farmers raised wheat
but produced no corn, and it Is the
natural thing for them to do, to feed
tho wheut instead of paying extrava
gant prices for corn. So extensive
has this practice becomo that compar
atively little winter wheat Is moving to
market, though tho crop was one of
tho largest over produced.
Tho avcrngo country speculator
thinks wheat, as well as corn, will sell
at very high prices, and ho is theie
foro buying wheat In tho speculative
market.
Many traders who have taken largo
In corn, are putting their
In wheat. The big spring
wneat crop, and the recent indilTcient
export demand have kept muny bourd
of trado men on the bear sido of the
market, but tho professional traders
are getting around to the country
man's view, now that the spring wheat
movement has begun to full off.

AGAINST AGREEMENT
Ofllcers of All the Kouda Not in Sym
pathy With Movement
Kansas City, Dec. (I.- it Is possible
that tho anti-puss agreement lof tho
unti-puss agreement of the roads east
of Chicago and St. Louis may bo
abrogated on account of the tefusnl
of somo of tho roads to be bound by
its provisions.
Olllcers of the Clover Leaf and or
tho Cluclunutl, Hamilton .V Dayton
havo given notice that tholr companies
will not becomo parties to the compact
which ilenltis exchange pusses to olll
cers und agents of other lines. It Is
reported that tho Erio enmnany also
will not boa party to the ugiecincnt.
President Norton of the Clover
Leaf has sent a circular to all roads
In the country requesting passes for
olllcers and representatives of his
system und requesting oxecutivo otll-
corn of other linen to send him lists of
names of ollloials und ugents of their
linos for whom passes for 1!)02 uro
wanted.
Tho unll-pass agreement was largely
brought about by tho Vundorbilt und
Pennsylvania intorosts. Tho manage
ments of these systems have been
working for yoars for tho abolition of
all pass privileges. Olllcers of the

Leavenworth, Kas. Doc. 7 Warden
Jewott of the Kansas penitentiary,
Warden Woolfer of tho Minnesota
penitentiary, tho warden of tho South
Dakota penitentiary and Mr. Klllot,
president of tho bourd of directors of
tho Kansas penitentiary, left hero sun
duy for Yucatan to buy sfsul for tho
three binding twlno plants of the re
spective institutions they represent.
The binding twine combine, or trust,
crowded tho penitentiary twlno pluuts
last year und tho prison wurdens have
found It nccessnry to form a sort of a
secret organization to prevent tho
twine combine from crushing them
out.
I ho olllcers of tho Knusus pen I ten
tlury had a costly experience with tho
twine combine lust year. Whllo J. 13.
Tomlinson was wurden ho sent an of
lieer to tho sisal district to purchase a
supply for tho prison plant. State
ments tolling of the pluns and unuoitn-
coing tho departure of tho purchasing
olllcial wero irlven out. Those wore
noted by tho twlno combine olliclals
and they lost no time In cabling to
Yucatan and other ports of tho slsul
districts oilers of two cents a pound
advanco on tho price of materlul.
The cablegrams stated that tho price
of sisal had advunced In tho United
States and contained olfers to pur
chase all that could be secured at tho
new price.
Tho Kansas olliciul wus astounded
when ho arrived In Yucatan to llnd
that sisal had taken a sudden jump of
two cents and could hardly bo pur
chased at any prlco. Ho contructed
for a small amount and returned
nomo. Not long after bis return It
leaked out that tho trust combine of
iiciuls hud played a trick on him. It
Is said that tho olliclals of tho Minn
esota penitentiary had un experience
somewhat similar to this.
The wnrdens of tho penitentiaries
decided to take charge of the purchas
ing of slsul In person this year, und
to keep evcr.vthin; connected with
their plans us secret as possible
Tho governors of threo states, along
with tho penitentiary directors, wero
tho only persons consulted. Gover
nor Stnnloy of Kansas came to Lim
bing and met tho wardens for a final
conference boforo tholr dopnrturo u
week ago.
Tho wardens loft hero- propared to
buy sisal on an cxtonsivo scale. It Is
said that they had over a half a mill
ion dollars for this purpose. Tho
wurden of the Minnesota penitentiary
had tho largest port of tho sura, tho
warden of tho Kansas penitentiary
second nnd tho warden of the South
Dakota penitentiary tho smallest
amount. If they find the price und
conditions favorable thoy will invest
ull of this money. They l.avo bcon in
tho sisal district for tho last three
days, nnd It Is expected that they havo
ubout completed tholr purchases.
Thoy aro expected buck enrly this
week. So far as can bo learned tho
combine olllclnls had no Intimation of
tholr movements und wero unuble to
advanco prices this time. When tho
wardens left thoy had letters from tho
Secretary of State, Mr. Hay, to tho
United States consuls In Yucatan and
Mexico InstrfflJtlng those olliclals to
aid tho penitentlury olllcers.
If Warden Jewott can buy a big
supply of sisal tho Kansas peniten
tlury twlno will start next week and It
will run until July. Should tho wheat
