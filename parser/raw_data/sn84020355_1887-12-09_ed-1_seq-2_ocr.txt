COUNTY OFFICIAL PAPER.
THE HEMAOE.

The Republican party claims to be
the especial cliauipiou of Protection,
nud prominent representatives of that
party are now vigorously denoauoing
she President's message ua a Free Trade
document, notwitliMtandiug that it advo
cates the HStue principles laid down by
the Bcpablioun party a few years ago;
that is to ssy the principles tnuueiuted
by the party of Protection iu 1883 and
1884 beoouie essentially Free Trade
doctrine when endorsed by a Democratic
President iu 1887. The troth of the
matter is that the President, in his dis
cussion of this paramount question, has
struck a popular chord whose vibrations
will And an appreciative response in the
hearts of the Amerioau people, and as a
natural and inevitable seqnenoe the
managers of the Bepablioau party are
stricken with sadden fear and tremb
ling at the probable resnlt. Iu oom
meuting on the recommendations em
bodied in the message the Examiner
suys:
There are already signs of a Repabli
can combination to resist these moderate#
reooramendatious, although the Presi
dent's doctrine wuh good enough Repub
lican doctrine three years ago, when the
crisis wus immeasurably less aoate than
it is now. The Bepnblican National
Convention which nominated Mr.
lil.iiue in 1884, adopted t? platform with
this explicit declaration, falsified by
every act of the party since: "The Re
publican party pledges itself to correct
the iuequ lilies of the tariff and to re
duce the aarplus, by snoh methods as
will relieve the taxpayer without injur
ing the laborer or the great productive
interests of the country."
That is precisely what President
, Clevi land proposes.
The Rtpoblicnu Secretary of the
Treasury of the last Republican Prt-si
dent, in hiB report advising the appoint
ment of a Tariff Commission, proposed
"that the existing duties npon raw ma
terials, which are to be used iu manu
facture, should be removed," and "that
the duties upou the articles used or con
sumed by those who are the least able to
bear the burden of taxation, should be
reduced." Those pr< p isnls of Presi
dent Cleveland, whioh will be the tar
gets for the fieroest Republioau o iti
cisniH in 1887, are identical iu substauoe,
ilnost identioul iu langu ig?', with the
advice of tbs highest Republican author
ity in 1883.
Mr. Cleveland has p'aced the issue
iu a light that forbids the possibility of
mistake. There will be no ohance of
evas oo; the sarpl is will be rudaoed or
it wi I not, and the party that shirks iis
duty is lust.

The Seoretury of Ihe Treasury, in bin
aunnil report submitted to Congress to
, *ay. nay* that the torul ordinary re
ceipts ot the government during the
y.mr ending Jane 30, 1087, were 987l?
403,000, and that the total ordtua y ex
peud lures were #315,835,000, leaving,
with the amount drawn from tbo oash
balance in tbe treasury of 934,455,000,
u total surplus of 980,023^000, wbioh
was offered for tl*e redeuipt'on ot bonds.
T]te itoetida for the year show an in
crease of 931,053,000 over the yeur be
fore, and the expenditures show an in
crrase of 935,410,000.
For the present year Ihe revenues are
estimated at 333,000,000, end the expen
ditures at 9310,817,000, leaving an esti
mated surplus of 968,182,000 on Jane
30, 1R88.
The See etavy estimates the surplus
for IU? year 188 f5V-?,000. Thu
8eoNtoij Mjn lb* argM?y of tka ques
tion of the surploa revenues h ad great
tbot it ehoiil.l demand the attentive of
both executive branches of the govern
meat.
The Secretary mentions the following
ways in which the receipts aad ex
penditarea oi the government may be
equalized:
First. The purchase of the interest
bearing debt of the gore ra me at.
Second. Larger expenditures by the
government for other purposes than
the purchase of bonds, so (hat they
shall each year equal the taxes of that
year.,
Third. A reduction of the revenue
irom taxation to the amount actually
required to meet the neeeasary expens
es.
All of these expedients have in com
mon the one merit of p; eventing a de
rangement to business which must fol
low the hoarding or locking up in the
Ti-easury of the circulating medium of
the people.

The t>nmm heart revolts over the
exhibitions of depruvily frequently en
countered among society's outcasts, bat
it is doubtful if anything in the lower
strata sr"pusses in loathsomeness the
dis.fusliug revelajioos that often oome
from the higher social oircles. Here
comes Dr. James 0. Shatter, who. in
bis efforts to obtain a divorce from his
wife, oharges her with criminal intei
oonrse with himself before their mar
riage. The depths of depravity fail to
reveal aoything more cowardly, oon
temptible aud revolting. The beast
who would make a harlot of a git 1,
marry her and then bold his own crime
aud her weakness np to the g:'ze of the
woild, is far too low for the subtleties
of denunciation to reaoh. -[Saoramento
