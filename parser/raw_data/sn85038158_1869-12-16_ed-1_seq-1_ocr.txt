can commerce was almost dri von from '
the s,as, the industry of one half
the country had been taken from the
control of the capitalists, and placed
where all labor rightfully belongs in
the keeping of the laborer.
The work of restoring State Gov
ernments loyal to the Union, of pro
tecting and fostering free labor, and
providing for paying the interest on
the public debt, has received ample at
tention of Congress. Although these
measures have not met with the suc
cess in all particulars that ought to
have been deserved, yet on the whole
they have been more successful than
could have been reasonably antici
pated. Seven Statps which passed ordin
ances of secession have been fully re
stored to tht'ir places in the Union.
The eighth, Georgia, held an election
at which she ratified her Constitution,
Republican in form, fleeted a Gov
ernor, members of Congress, a State
Legislature, and all other officers re
quired. The Governor was duly in
stul!d, and the Legislature met and
performed all the acts then required of
them by the Reconstruction Act of
Congress.
Subsequently, however, in violation
of the Constitution which they had
rutihert, as since decided by the
Supreme Court of the State, they un
seated the colored members 'if the Leg
islature, and RrimiMed to seats some
members who are. disqualified by the
third clause of the fourteenth amend
ment to the Constitution, an article
which they themselves had contribu
ted to ratify.
Under these circumstances, I would
submit to you whether it would not
be wise, without delay, to enact a law
authorizing the Governor of Georgia
to convene the members originally
elected to the Legislature, requiring
each member to take the oath present
ed by the Reconstruction Act, and
none to be admitted who are ineligible
under the third clause of the Four
teenth Amendment.
The freedmen, under the protection
which they have received, are making
rapid progress in learning, and no
complaints are heard of lack of indus
try on their part, when they receive
fair enumeration for their labor.
The means provided for paying the
interest on the public debt, with all
other expenses of the Government, are
more than ample.
The loss of our commerce is the
only result of the late rebellion which
has not received sufficient attention
from you. To this subject I cull your
attention. I will not now suggest
plans by which this object may be ef
fected, but will, if necessary, make it
the subject of a special message during
the session of Congress.
At the March term, Congress, by a
joint resolution, athorized the Execu
tive to order elections in the States of
Virginia, Mississippi and Texas to
submit to them the Constitutions
which each had previously in Conven
tion framed, and submit the Constitu
tion, either entire or in separate parts,
be voted on at the direction of the
Executive. i
Under this authority, elections were
called. In Virginia the election took
place on the 6th of July, 1869. The
Governor and Lieutenant Governor
elected have been installed; the Leg
islature met and did all required by
this resolution, and by all the recon
struction acts of Congress, and abstain
ed from all doubtful authority. I rec
ommend that her Senators and Repre
sentatives be admitted to seats, and
that the State he fully restored to its
plae in the family of States.
Elections were called in Mississippi
and Texas, to commence on the 30th
of November, 1869, and to last two
days in Mississippi and four days in
Texas. The elections have taken
place, but the result is not known. It
to he hoped that the acts of the Leg
islatures of these States, when they
meet, will be such as to receive your
approbation, aud thus close the work
of reconstruction.

rate of six per cent, and five per cent.
respectively. It is optional with the
Government to pay their bonds at any
period after the expiration of the least
time mentioned upon their face. The
time has already expired when a great
part of them may be taken up, and
the time is rapidly approaching when
all may be. It is believed that all
which are now due may be replaced
by bonds bearing a rate of interest not
exceeding four and one-half per cent.;
and as rapidly as the remainder be
come due, that they may be replaced
in the same way. To accomplish this
it may be necessary to authorize the
interest to be paid at either of three or
four of the money centres of Europe,
or by any Assistant Treasurer of the
United States, at the option of the
holder of the bonds. I suggest this,
subject for the consideration of Co
gress; also, simultaneous with this
the propriety of redeeming our cur
r.-ncy as before suggested, at its mar
ket value at the time the law goes in
to effect, increasing the rate at
which currency will be bought and
sold from day to day, or week to week,
at the same rate of interest as Govern
ment pays upon its bonds.
The subject of tariff and internal
taxation will necessarily receive your
attention. The revenues of the coun
try are greater than the requirements,
and may, with safety, be reduced.
But as the funding of the debt in a
four or a four and a half per cent, loan
would reduce the annual current ex
penses largely, thus, after funding,
justifying a greater reduction of taxa
tion than would be now expedient, I
suggest a postponement of this ques
tion uutil the next meeting of Con
gress. It may be advisable to modify taxa
tion and the tariff in instance where
unjust or burdensome discriminations
are made by the present laws; but a
general revision of the laws regulating
this subject I recommend the post
ponement of for the present.
I also suggest the renewal of the
tax on incomes, but at a reduced rate
-say three per cent. aud this tax to
expire in three years.
With the funding of the national
debt us here suggested, I feel safe in
saying the taxes and revenue from im
ports may be reduced, safely, from
sixty to eighty millions per annum,
at once, Hnd be still further reduced
from year to year, as the resources of
the country are developed.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury shows the receipts of the
Government for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1869, to be 5370,943,747,
and the expenditures, including inter
est, bounties, etc., to be S321,490,5!)7.
The estimates for the ensuing year are
more favorable to the Government,
and will, no doubt, show a large de
crease of public debt. The receipts
into the Treasury, beyond expendi
tures, have exceeded the amount nec
essary to place to the credit of the
Sinking Fund, as provided by law.
To lock up the surplus in the Treas
ury, and withhold it from circulation,
would lead to such contraction of the
currency as to cripple trade, and seri
ously affect the prosperity of the coun
try. Under these circumstances the
Secretary of the Treasury and myself
heartily concurred in the propriety ol
using all the surplus currency in the
Treasury i.i the purchase of Govern
ment bonds, thus reducing the interest
bearing debt of the country, and o!
submitting to Congress the question ol
the disposition to be made of the
bonds so purchased. The bonds now
held by the Treasury amount to about
175,000,000, including those belong
ing to the Sinking fund. I recom
mend that the whole be placed to the
credit of the Sinking Fund.
Your attention is respectfully invited
to the recommendations of the Secre
tary of the Treasury for the creation of
the officer of Commissioner of Customs
Revenue ; for the increase of salarv to
a
certain classes of officials, and the sub
stitution of increased National Bank
circulation, to replace the outstanding
tnree percent, certificates, and most es
pecially to his recommendation for the
repeal of laws allowing shares of fines,
penalties, forfeitures, etc., to officers of
tne government, or to informers.

ask for it, therefore, such legislation
as, in your ludginent,. will.plaee the
office on a footing of dignity commen
surate with, its importance, and with
the character and qualifications of the
class of men required to fill it prop
erly. As the United States is the freest of
all nations, so, too, its people sympa
thize with all people struggling for
liberty and self government. But
while so sympathizing, it is due to our
honor that wo should abstain from en
forcing our views upon unwillins na
tions, and from taking an interested
part, without invitation, in the quar
rels between different nations, or be
tween Governments and their sub
jects. Our course should always bo
n conformity with strict iustiee and
law, international and local. Such
has been the policy of the Adminis
tion in dealing with these questions.
For more than a year a valuable
province of Spain, and a near neigh
bor of ours, in whom all our people
can out teel a deep interest, has been
struggling for independence and free
dom. The people and Government
of the United States entertain the
same warm feelings and sympathies
tor the people of Cuba, in their pond-
ng struggle, that they manifested
throughout the previous struggles be
tween Spain and her former colonies,
n behalf of the latter. But the con
test at no time assumed the conditions
which amount to a war. in the sense
of international law, or which would
show the existence of a fie facto nolit-
cal organization of the insurgents suf
ficient to justify a recognition of bel-
gereney. lhe principle is main
tained, however, that this nation is
ts own jud.'e when to accord the
rights of belligerency, either to a peo
ple struggling to free themselves from
a government they believe to be op
pressive, or to independent nations at
war with each other. The United
States has no disposition to interfero
with the existing relations of Spain to
her colonial possessions on this conti
nent. I hey believe in due time Snain
rid other European Powers will find
their interest in terminating these re-!
alions and establishing their present
eptnaencies as independent powers
members of the families of nations.
fho dependencies are no longer re
garded its subject to transfer from one
European Power to another. When
the present relations of colonies cease
they are to become independent pow
ers, exercising the right of choice and
of self control in the determination of
their futuro condition and relations
with other powers.
The United States, in order to put
stop to bloodshed in Cuba, and in
the interest of a neighboring poople,
proposed their good offices to bring
the existing contest to a termination.
The offer not being accepted by Spain
on a basis which wo believed could bo
received by Cuba, was withdrawn. It
is hoped that the good offices of the
United States may yet provo advan
tageous for the settlement of the un
happy strife.
Mean while a number of illegal ex
peditions against Cuba have been brok
en up. It has been tho endeavor of
the administration to execute the neu
trality laws in good faith, no matter
how unpleasant the task, made so by
the suffering we ha-e endured from
lack of like good faith toward us by
other nations.
Thd United States Bi-hooner Lizzie
Major was arrested on the high seas
by a Spanish frigate, and two passen
gers taken from it, and carried as pris
oners to Cuba. Representations of
these facts were made to the Spanish
Government as soon as official infor
mation of them reached Washington.
The two passengers wore set at liber
tv, and the Spanish Government as-
sured the United States that the cap-j
tain ot the frigate, in making the cap- j
had acted without law; that heltained.
had been reprimanded for the irregn-
of his conduct, and that the
Spanish authoritcs in Cuba would not
sanction any act that could violate tho
rights or treat with disrespici the sov
ereignty of this nation.
The question of the seizure of the
brig Alary Lowell, at one of the IJaha-
ma Islands, by tho Spanish authori-
ties, is now the subject of correspen-1
dence between this Government and j the
that of Spain and Great Britain. Theithe
General ot Cuba, about Maj'tiou
last, issued a proclamation authorizing! to
search to be made of vessels on the I
high seas. Immediate remonstrance
was made againstthis, whereupon the!
Captain Goneral issued a new procla
mation, limiting the right of search
of vessels of the United States so fnr'ences,
as authorized under the treaty of 1795
lhis proclamation, however, was im
mediately withdrawn.

A grant has been made to Europe

lhe Minister of Peru having made
representations that there was a state

that Spain was constructing, in and

which might be used by Spain in such
way as to relieve tho naval foree at
Cuba, so as to operate against Peru,
orders were given to prevent their de
parture. No further steps having
been taken by the representative ot
the Peruvian Government to prevent
the departure of these vessels, and I,
not feeling authorized to detain the
property of a natiou with which we
are at peace, on a mere Executive or

Toward the close of the last Admin
istration, a Convention was signed at
London for tho settlement of all out
standing claims, between Great Brit
ain and the United States, which fail
ed to receive the advice and consent
the Senate to its ratification. The
time and the circumstances attending
the negotiation of the treaty were un
favorable to its acceptance by tho peo
ple of the United Slates, and its pro
visions were wholly inadequate foi
the settlement of the grave wrongs
that had been sustained by this Gov
as well as by its citiz ms.
The injuries resulting to the United
States bv reason of the course adopt
by Great Britain during the late
civil war, in increased rates of insur
ance; in the diminution of exports and
imports, and other obstructions to do
mestic industry and production; in its
effoct upon tho foreign commerce of
countrj-; in the decrease and trans
to Great Britain of our commer
cial murine; in the prolongation of
war, and the increased cost, both
treasure and lives, of its suppres
sion, could not be adjusted and satis
fied as ordinary commercial claims
which continually arise between com
mercial nations; and yet the Conven
tion treated them simply as such ordi
nary claims, from which they differ
more widely in the gravity of their
character than in tho magnitude of
their amount, great even as is that
uinerence. jnoi a word was lounu in
treaty, and not an inference could
drawn from it, to remove the sense
the unfriendliness of the course of
Great Britain in our struggle for exis
tenee, which had so deeply and uni
versally impressed itself on the people
this country. Believing that a con
vention thus misconceived in its
scope, and inadequate in its provis
ions, would not have produced the
heaity, cordial settlement of pending
questions which alone is consistent
with the relations which I desire to
have established between the United
States and Grtat Britain, I r garded
action of the Senate in rejecting
treaty to have been wisely taken,
the interest of peace, and as a nec
essary step in the direction of a per.
and cordial friendship between
two countries. Sensitive people.
conscious of their power, are more at
under a great wrong wholly un
atoned, than under the restraint of a
settlement which satisfies neither
their ideas of justice nor their grave
both sides which I thought not favor
to an immediate attempt at re
newed negotiations. I accordingly so
instructed the Minister of the United
States to Gi'ut Britain, and found
my views in this regard were
plaint in the past, but to lay the foun-
dation of a broad principle of public
law, which will prevent future differ
peace and friendship. This is now
only grave question which the
United States have with any foreign
nation.
The question of a treaty for re
been tiMd.i, and all rights and titles of
the company on the territory of the
United States have been extinguished.
Deeds for the property of the compa

In conformity with the recommen

with the objectionable feature of sub
jecting all messages conveyed thereby
to me sovereignty and the control of
the French Government. I caused
the French and British lea-ations at
Washington to be made acquainted
w.th the probable policy of Congress
on the subject, as foreshadowed by the
Hill which passed the Senate in March
last. This drew from the repnsenta
tives of the company an agreement to
accept as the basis of their operations
the provisions of the bill, or of such
other enactment on the subject as might
be passed during the approaching ses
sion of Congress; also, to use their influ
ence to secure from the French Gov
ernment a modification of their conces
sion, so as to permit the landing upon
French soil of any cable belonging to
any company incorporated by the au
thority of the United States, or of any
State in the Union, and on their part
not to oppose the establishment of any
such cable. In consideration of this
agreement, I directed the withdrawal
of all oposition by the New York au
thorities to the landing of ths cable,
and to the working of it, until tha
meeting of Congress. I regret to say
that there has been no modification
made in the company's concession; nor,
as far as I can learn, have they attempt
ed to secure one. Their concession
excludes the capital and the citizens
of the United States from competition
upon the shores of France. I recom
mend legislation to protect the rights
of citizpns of the United States, a3 well
as tne dignity and sovereignty of the
nation, against such an assumption.
I shall also endeavor to secure, by
negotation, an abandonment of the
principle of monopolies iu ocean ttla-
griphing cables.
Copies of this correspondence ar
herewith furnished.
The unsettled political condition of
other countries less fortunate than our
own, sometimes induces their citizens
to come to the United States for the
sole purpose of becoming naturalized.
Having secured this, they return to
their native country and reside therer
without disclosing their change of al
legiance. They occupy official post
tions or positions of trust cr honor,
which can only be held by citiz ns of
their native land. They journey un
der passports describing them as such
citizens; and it is only when civil dis
cord, after, perhaps, years of quiet,
threatens them. or threatens their per
sons or their property, or their native
State drafts them into its military ser
vice, that the fact of their change of
allegiance is made known. They re
side permanently away from the Uni
ted States; they contribute nothing to
its revenues; they avoid the duties of
citizenship, and they only make them
selves known by a claim of protection.
I have directed diplomatic and consu
lar officers of the United States to scru
tinize carefuly ull such claims for pro
tection. The citizen of the United States,
whether native or adopted, who dis
charges his duty to his country, is en
titled to its complete protection.
While I have a voice in the direction
of affairs, I shall not consent to impair
the sacred right by conferring it upon
fictitious and fraudulent claimants.
On the accession of the present Ad
ministration, it was fonnd that the
Minister tor North Germany had made
propositions ror the negotiation ofa con

been given. It was -concluded that,
to be effectual, all the maritime Pow
ers engaged in the trade should join in
such a measure. Invitations have
been extended to tho Cabinets of Lon
don, Paris, Florence, Berlin, Brussels,
The Hague, Copenhagen and Stock
holm, to empower their representa
tives at Washington to simultaneo-ly
enter into negotiations, and to con
clude with the United States conven
tions, identical in form, making uni

or tne parts of vessels to be devoted
to the use of emigrant passengers, s
to the quality and quantity of food, ss
to the medical treatment ofthesiik.
