' LEG A LIZE TH EPR IMA KIES.
We understand that strong efforts
are being made to defeat the proposed
legislation to legalize the primaries.
One of the subtifuges being used is
that no law can be passed which
would be constitutional. Another
argument is, that the cumbersome
methods would entail too much ex
pense. As an answer to the first argu
ment we can only say that it is simply
ridiculous to say that there can be no
constitutional law enacted to control
this important branch of our election
.machinery. Section 43 of Article 3of
the constitution expressly says that,
“The General Assembly shall pass
Laws necessary for the preservation
of the purity of Elections.” This
should forever put to rest any argu
ments about such technicalities.
Speaking of technicalities, we should
like to digress for a moment and call
attention to the fact that whenever a
person is fairly beaten in any encoun
ter he will always attempt to entangle
himself by resorting to technicalities.
It is the expiring death wail of the
worsted combatant.
In regard to the expense of a legal
primary, we would say that it is for
the purpose of saving money for the
candidates, that the passage of the
act is urged. If bribery and corruption
is prohibited it will then be possible
for a poor man to be an aspirant for
political honors. The only expense
he would be subjected to would be to
pay his pro-rata of the cost of judges,
clerks, etc. Now the way things are
run, he must be a man of means to
stand all the levies which are put
upon him. It has indeed gotten so
bad in many cases that more than the
salary of the office sought has to be
expended to gain the prize.
There has not as yet, been one
single convincing argument advanced
against legalizing the primaries. The
people want it, and are going to have
it, and if anyone sets himself up
against the will of the people and
favors illegal primaries he will have to
take the consequences.
THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
On Tuesday Presideut McKinley
sent to Congress his annual message.
It is a much mbre elaborate oue than
many of its predecessors, containing
as it does over 25,000 words. It touch
es very fully upon almost every im
portant public event. Its leading
features are the recommendations for
the of the gold standard
and the regulation of trusts, the dis
cussion of the situation in the Philip
pines and Cub-., the proposed plan of
government for Puerto Rico, the ne
cessity of legislation for Hawaii and
Alaska, the exposition of our policy in
China, which, though brief, is perti
nently stated, and the President’s de
fense of his order amending Ihe civil
service act.
In opening his message, Mr. Mc-
Kinley dwells upon the prosperity of
the United States, showing that the
combined exports and imports for 1899
are the largest in our history. The
exports of agricultural products
amount to to $784,770,142, while Die
aggregate of manufactured products
is $339,593 140. The receipts of the
Government, in the opinion of the
Secretary of the Treasury, will exceed
the expenditures for the liscnl year,
which will end on June, 30,1900, and a
surplus of $40,000,000 is anticipated.
The Treasury is in good condition and
on December 1 held $239,744,905 in
gold coin and bullion. In fact, as the
President points out, confidence pre
vails, there is increased activity in in
dustry and the present seems to be a
good time for Congress to enact finan
cial legislation.
“Our receipts,” says the President,
“now equaj our expenditures, and de
ficient revenues no longer create
alarm. Let us remove the only re
maining cause by conferring the full
and necessary power on the Secretary
of the Treasury, and impose upon him
the duty to uphold the present gold
standard and preserve the coins of the
two metals on a parity with each
other, which is the repeatedly declar
ed policy of the United States.” The
President recommends that to "sup
port the existing gold standard 9 * *
the Secretary of the Treasury be given
additional power and charged with
the duty to sell United States bonds
* * *on long and short time, as the
conditions mav require.” The Presi
deut further recommends such
changes in the national banking act
as will make it more effective in pro
viding needful additions to the circu
lation iu time of emergency. Larger
agricultural production, ho declares,
calls for an increased volume of money
supply.
The President defends his position
in the Philippines iu strong terms. He
says :
“The islands were ceded by the
Government of Spain, which had been
in undisputed possession of them for
centuries. They were accepted not
merely by our authorized commission
ers in Paris, under the direction of
the Executive, but by the constitu
tional and well-considered action of
the representatives of the people of
the United States iu both houses of
Congress. I had e very reason to be
lieve, and I still believe, that this
transfer of sovereignty was in accord
ance with the wishes and aspirations
of the great mass of the Filipino peo
ple.” From the earliest moment, de
clares the President, no opportunity
was lost of assuring the people of tbe
islands "of our ardent desire for their
welfare and of the intention of this
Government to do everything possi
ble to advance their interests.” It is
claimed that the “sinister ambition of
a few Filipino leaders created a situa
tion full of embarassment to ns and
most grievous in its consequences to
them.”
There can now be no doubt as to
what the conclusion of the President
is in regard to these islands. He un
doubtedly wants to hold them per
manently.
“The future government of the
Philippines rests with Congress,” he
asserts. “Few graver responsibilities
have ever been confided to us. If we
accept them in a spirit worthy of our
race and traditions, a great oppor
tunity comes with them, The islands
lie under the shelter of our flag, and
are ours byfevery title of law and
equity. They cannot be abandoned.
If we desert them we leave them at
once to anarchy and finally to barbar
ism. We fling them, a golden apple
of discord, among the rival powers.
Their rich plains and valleys would
be the scenes of endless strife and bar
barism.” Mr. McKinley scorns the
“uggestion that we renounce our
authority over the islands and give
them independence, maintaining a
oro'ectorate over them. “Our flag,”
he says, “has never waved over any
community but in blessing.” The
Filipinos will soon recognize the fact
that it "has not lost its gift of bene
diction in its world-wide journey to
their shores.”
in regard to Cuba, the Preside t
declares that the pledge of independ
ence made by Congress is of the high
est honorable obligation and must be
sacredly kept. “Our mission, to ac
complish which we took up the wager
of battle, is not to be fulfilled,” how
ever, “by turning adrift any loosely
framed commonwealth to face the vi
cissitudes which too often attend
weaker States, whose natural wealth
and abundant resources are offset by
the incongruities of their political
organization and the recurring oc
casions for internal rivalries to sap
their strength and dissipate their
energies.” The policy of the Admin
istration is to fit the Cubans “for a
regenerated existence by enforcing
the supremacy of Jaw and justice,”
and to “take every rational step to
aid the people of Cuba to attain to
that plane of self-conscious respect
and self-reliant unity which fits an
enlightened community for self-gov
ernment.” There is a remote sugges
tion of annexation in the President’s
remark that the “destinies of Cuba
are iu some rightful form and manner
irrevocably linked with our own,
whether those ties shall be organic or
conventional.”
Possibly the lamest portion of the
message is the condemnation of the
trusts. Every right-thinking man
knows that they are mere creatures of
the Republican party, fostered by
legislation of their own contrivance.
We think that if we had been sincere
he should have frankly upheld them
as Senator Hanna did iu his cam
paign speeches in Ohio this fall.
After recommending a system of
government for Puerto Rico along the
lines of Secretary Root’s report, the
President says: “The markets of the
United States should be opened up to
the island’s products. Our plain
duty is to abolish all customs tariffs
betweeu the United States aaid Puerto
Rico, and give the latter’s products
free access to our markets.”
The President declares that his civil
service order was justifiable and has
strengthened the merit system. He
commends the Nicaragua canal
scheme; deprecates lynchings iu the
United States; speaks favorably of the
Paris Exposition; suggests certain
changes, for the benefit of widows, in
rhe pension laws: advocates early leg
islation for Hawaii and Alaska; re
commends liberal appropriations for
the maintenance and improvement of
the navy; commends the work of the
Peace Conference at The Hague;
points out certain matters which mav
cause friction between the United
States and 'turkey, and refers to the
good relations between the United
States, G rmany and Great Britain.
In regal'd to the lynching of abens
in the United S'ates he says "thecon
tingency has arisen for action by Con
gress iu the direction of conferring
upon the Federal courts juris
diction iu this class of international
cases where the ultimate responsi
bility of the Federal Government may
be involved.”
SCHLEY’S COURT MARTIAL.
From a well-informeJ correspon
dent we obtain the following: Imme
diately on Secretary Long’s return
from the West on November 19 he
was called on by Admiral Crownin
shield, who insisted that a court of
inquiry or court-martial should be
ordered for Admiral Schley before he
left this country. Mr. Long was in
formed by the chief of the Bureau of
Navigation that the Admiral's orders
had been purposely held up until the
Secretary returned, and it was assert
ed that recent newspaper attacks on
the Administration had been inspired
and encouraged by Schley, and es
pecially those directed against the
Secretary and the Department. Par
ticular attention was drawn to Gen
eral Agnus’s recent letter. Other in
stances were shown where, as was al
leged, Admiral Schley had been using
his influence to prompt criticism of
the Administration. Secretary Long
at first was inclined to heed the ad
vice, and was, we are told, about to
proceed to the President with a
suggestion that a court be ordered for
Schley. He was persuaded by As
sistant Secretary Allen that the better
policy would be to permit Admiral
Schley to leave. It was shown that
political reasons must be considered;
that Schley was very strong with the
public; that a court now would arouse
his friends and make trouble for the
President and result in a discussion
before Congress that would briug the
Navy into an unpleasant position.
There is no doubt that ali this trans
pired. Wo are reliably informed
that no charges are yet on file at the
Department against Admiral Schley.
We are told, however, that Capt.
liobley D. Evans has drawn charges
against him and has held them
for some time, but so far has not pre
sented them to the Secretary, though
they have been shown to sympathi
zers in the attack on Admiral Schley.
It remains to be seen whether they
will be presented to the Department.

Washington Letter.
From our Regular Correspondent.
Washington, Dec., 4.—Hon. J. D. Richard
son, of Tennessee, who received the Democra
tic nomination for Speaker, after one of the
longest caucuses ever hold, got the vote of
every Democratic memberof the House today.
He was not, of course, elected; the Republicans
having the most votes, elected Representative
Henderson Speaker, adopted the oid Reed
rules, but Mr. Richardson will be the Demo
cratic floor-icndcr of the House during: the life
of the Fifty-Sixth Congress. There may be
more showy and brilliant men on the Demo
cratic side of the House, but that be will make
a shrewd and safe leader is conceedcd by all.
His shrewdness would have beeu shown by
the manner in which be conducted bis cam
paign for the nomination of Speaker, had it
not been well established long ago. He re
ceived no warmer congratulations on his suc
cess than those extended by bis throe rivals for
the honor.
Leaving Roberts and bis polygamy entirely
out of the question, the position taken by the
Democrats in the first scrap of the session,
which occurred when objection was raised to
the swearing in of Roberts, that the House
had no right Co go behind the official returns
and deny a man a seat, when ho presents
proper credent! als, whs right, but right can’t
win when a majority is determined tp do the
other thing, it Roberts cannot clear himself
of the ohargo of having violated the law, there
wiil be few if any, objections on the Demo
cratic side, to his being denied a seat, but it is
wrong to declare him guilty before bis case is
fairly investigated.
Mr. McKinley’s long message, —one of the
longest over sent to Congrcs—was. not sent in
today, owing to the early adjournment of both
Senate and House as a mark of respect to the
late Vice-President Hobart. It will go In to
morrow, and then the real business of the
session of Congress will begin. The Demo
crats were never in a more aggress.ve mood,
and “hot times’’ are ahead for tho Republican
majority in both Senate and House.
The attention of Senators is being called to
tho fact that Gov. Stone had no constitutional
right to appoint Mr. Quay to the Senate, after
tho legislature adjourned, without electing his
successor. The State Constitution of Pennsyl
vania. expressly provides that vacancies in
the United States Senate Khali only be Ailed by
the Legislature. A number ol inlluontial
Pennsylvanians ere in Washington, working
against tho seating of Quay on personal
grounds, against both precedent and law. One
ot those is ex-Representative Sowden, who
said on the subject: “The question should not
be made a partisan one but each Senator, re
gardless of his politic* or bis perso ial friend
ship for Mr. Quay, should vote a< a conscien
tious, impartial and unright Judge, and de
cide it according to its merits and the dictates
of his own conscience, under bis official oath.
I f this be done, there can be no question of the I
result. Gov. Stone’s unlawful appointment
has not a single merit to support it.” 1
That our pension laws arc in need of revision.
everybody knows, but when they will get It,
or whether the revision will make them better
or worse, la a house of another color. The
.Secretary and Assistant Secretary of the In
terior, and the Commissioner and Assistant
Commissioner of Pension*, have testified be
lore a sub-committee, or lbeSena to Committee
on Pensions, that a revision of the laws should
be made. and ed that it be done by
a commission. A National Com
mis.-ion that is rea.ly non partisan, wop •! be p
rarity, indeed, although there are mu**}’ so

Regular Army, and it leaked out. There was
a flood of protest from the friends of the line

who objected to having them jumped by a
staff surgeon, with tho rank of Captain. Mr.
McKinley then tried to satisfy Gen. Wood with
something else, but he have it that
way, preferring to stand pat on the original
promise. This was the principal reason for
Gen. Wood being ordered to Washington at
this time, and not the withdrawal of troops
from his District in Cuba, as announced.
