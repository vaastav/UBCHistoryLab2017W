'COUNCIL OF WAR' YESTERDAY
Forty Thousand Employes of Shirt
Waist Industry in New York
Complain of Injustice.
NEW YORK, December 20.?Hailed as
leaders of the 40,000 girls who are on
strike In the shirt waist industry, Mrs.
O. H. P. Belmont, mistress of millions
and a militant suffragette, a^d Miss Anne
Morgan, daughter of J. Pierpont Morgan,
accepted yesterday at a conference of la
bor leaders the responsibility of direct
ing the strike.
Forthwith these two newly appointed
generals outlined a campaign which vet
eran labor leaders described as both bril
liant and daring. It provides for a show
down, fight with the police department on
the issue of bow far the police may go
into strikers' territory. It further pro
vides for recruiting from the ranks of
Barnard and Vassar college girls.
Mrs. Belmont and iMss Morgan took
the field in accordance with well ma
tured plans. Those in the army of work
ers who shared in the secret of their new
generals kept it well.
Council of War Held.
The council of war was held in the
headquarters of the Women's Trade
Union, at No. 43 East 22d street. Mrs.
Belmont and Miss Morgan arrived, and
the council, which had awaited them be
fore beginning its deliberations, got to
work. Mrs. Belmont's first pronounce
ment disclosed to her labor lieutenants
that she was a "fighting general."
She expressed herself as indignant over
the acts of injustice on the part of the
police and some of the magistrates. Miss
Morgan proved herself a resourceful
army organizer by proposing a call for
volunteers. These are the most striking
plans made by Mrs. Belmont and Miss
Morgan for the forthcoming campaign.
First, that a corps of lawyers be de
tailed by the three police courts and the
night court in Manhattan, and in the
Brooklyn police court, to watch proceed'
ings in the shirt waist strike cases and
defend the girls arraigned. To appeal to
the supreme court for a review of each
case If necessary.
College Girls Requested to Aid.
Second, that a corps of Vassar girls
and students from Columbia University
and Barnard College act as watchers in
the neighborhood of the strike shops,
their duty being to keep their eyes on
the girl pickets and see that they ar^
not arrested for doing picket duty, which
they have a right to perform under the
law as long as they do not misbehave.
Third, to guard against the sending ot
girls to the workhouse as vagrants with
out proper and legal evidence.
A "demonstration"?always considered
effectual by the be?t teachers?has been
arranged for this morning, when five gill
strikers are released- from the work
house. At the conclusion of the council
of war yesterday the following statement
was issued: ^ _ .
"A conference between the business
manager of the Shirt Waist Makers' Union
and representative of the Women s Trade
Union League was held at the latter
headquarters, 43 East 22d street, at 3:30
p.m. Sunday, at which the attorneys who
are to take charge of the defense of the
pickets of the strikers were present, as
well as Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont, Miss Anne
Morgan and other invited guests. The
object of the conference was to consider
means of providing adequate legal de
fense and ball when required for repre
sentatives of the union who are prose
cuted In the magistrates' courts.
Alleged Unfair Methods.
"It was reported by attorneys who have
investigated the conditions before the
magistrates that in many cases no wit
nesses were present for the defense ex
cept the persons charged with the offense,
while the employers always see that wit
nesses for the prosecution are abundant.
"Under these circumstances great
abuses are safely practiced by the em
ployers and their hired thug guards and
there is virtually no recourse as well as
no possibility of effective defense against
fa-A committee of ladles was formed to
deal with this matter, composed of Mrs.
O. H. P. Belmont, Miss Anne Morgan,
Miss Helen Marot, Mrs. Frank H. Coth
Ven. Miss Mary E. Drier, Miss Violet
Pike Miss Woerishofter and Mrs. Eva
McDonald Valesh. who have sent out a
call for volunteer watchers to keep in the
neighborhood of the pickets of the Shirt
Waist Makers' Union, to report
upon the facts concerning unlaw
ful and unwarranted arrests. ,
Mrs. Belmont on Bond.
At 2:29 a.m. by the Jefferson Market
police court clock, at a ck from Po
liceman Foley and a nod irom Policeman
Callahan, Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont passed
through the wicket gate and stood before
the ^ar facing Magistrate Butts of the
night court yesterday morning.
"Your name, ma'am?" asked the magis
trate.
"Mrs. O. H. Belmont."
"Your occupation."
"I have so many of them I hardly know
what to answer," she said with a trace of
a laugh, and turning to an attorney at i
her elbow, asked: 4*Might I saj that I am
favorablv known as a sufTragist?"
She emphasized the "favorably." The
magistrate didn't give any indication that
he thought she had identified herself, so
she said:
?"I am president of the Equal Suffrage
League, with offices at No. 305 5th ave
nue."
"Do you wish to go on the-bond ox
these girls who are held for trial Mon
day night?"
Mansion as Security.
The girls were four shirt waist strik
ers who had been arrested at 5 o'clock
Saturday evening, in front of the shop of
E. A. Jackson, No. 105 5th avenue, on
a charge of interfering with the strike
breakers. Mrs. Belmont did not say she
had been sitting In the court for over five
hours to keep the girls from spending two
days in jail. She looked at the magis
trate for a moment and said:
"Yes. I will go on the girls' bond "
She gave the Belmont mansion at 51st
street and Madison avenue as security.
"Are you prepared to swear that you
are worth |800 over and above your just
debts?"
Mrs. Belmont didn't smile; she assured
the magistrate that she was. .
"Have you the deed for your property?"
was his next question.
She looked about In dismay. Were the
girls to go to jail after ail ??? cause she
hadn't the. deed with her? The magis
trate's heart must have softened.
"Never mind, madam. I will take your
word for It. You may step down."
Special Mission Meeting.
The Woman's Home and Foreign Mis
sionary Society of the Metropolitan A. M.
E. Z. Church, D street betwen 2d and

MATTERS TO BE TAKEN UP
State Department's Attitude Toward
Zelaya Causes Concern, Lest a
Precedent in Interference
Be Made.
BY WILLIAM E. CURTIS.
Written for The Star and the Chicago Bet-ord
Herald.
It is very important that Congress
should make an appropriation for the
representation of the United States at
the fourth international American con
ference as soon as possible. The meet
ins begins on the 9th of July naxt at
Buenos Aires, and the delegates who were
appointed to represent this government
Bhould have an opportunity to study the
several Important questions which are'to
be discussed.
In his annual message to Congress
President Taft said that this conference
"will have a -special meaning to all the
hearts of all Americans because around
its date are clustered the anniversaries
of the independence of so many of the
American republics. It is not necessary
for me to remind the Congress of the
political, social and commercial Impor
tance of these gatherings. You are asked
to make liberal appropriations for our
participation. If this be granted It is my
purpose to appoint a distinguished and
representative delegation, qualified fitting
ly to represent this country and to deal
with the problems of Intercontinental in
terest which will there be discussed."
Secretary Knox has asked an appro
priation of $75,000 to meet the expenses
of the delegates and their assistants, and
requests particularly that It be included
in the urgent deficiency bill, which is
usually passed at the beginning of every
session to supply funds for objects which
were overlooked or did not receive a
sufficient supply of money in the regular
appropriations at the previous session.
Secretary Knox calls attention to the fact
that a similar amount was appropriated
to pay the expense of the representation
of the United States at the third-inter
national conference, which was held at
Rio in 190G.
The Coming Conference.
Everybody will remember the first in
ternational conference, which was orig
inally proposed by President Arthur and
was held at Washington during the Har
rison administration under the distin
guished leadership of Mr. Blaine. The
second conference was held five vears
later, at Mexico, and the third at Rio de
Janeiro, in 1906. The fourth conference
was appointed at Buenos Abes in July,
19lO, after a shorter interval than usual,
because, as Secretary Knox suggests,
that is the anniversary year of the be
ginning of the struggle for Argentine In
dependence.
The conference is to be one'of a series
of international events, which includes
three distinct expositions, one for art, one
for agriculture and a third for transpor
tation facilities of all kinds.
These expositions will be very largely
attended by Europeans, but it is feared
that the representation of the I'nited
States will be insignificant. Several
manufacturers of agricultural Implements,
j railway rolling stock, street cars and
I automobiles and other things have al
ready obtained space, so that visitors to
the exposition will be at least reminded
that such o country as the United States
of America exists, but our government
will not be officially represented, because
Congress has neglected to make an ap
propriation.
The Xorth American citizens residing
in Buenos Aires have raised funds for
the erection of a statue to George Wash
ington in that city and it will be pre
sented to the Argentine people upon the
centennial anniversary of the first declara
tion of Independence in 1910. It is hoped
that sooner or later a statue of Gen. j
San Martin, the liberator of the southern
half of South America, who gained much
of his inspiration from the career of 1
Washington, may be erected in Washing
ton. There is a statue of Simon Bolivar,
liberator of the northern republics of
South America, in Central Park of New
York, which was presented to that city
by Guzman Blanco when he was Presi
dent of Venezuela.
Argentine Republic Delegates.
So far as we know here, the Argentine
Republic is the only government thus for
to-appoint its delegates to the internation
al conference, and it has set an example
which ought to be followed by other gov
ernments by electing its most eminent
men. Among them are Dr. Antonio Ber
mejo, chief justice of the federa' supreme
court: Dr. Eduardo I,. Bidau, professor
of International law in the national uni
versity; Dr. Luis Maria Drago an emi
nent jurist, author of "The Drago Doc
trine " in international law. a member of
The Hague conference, and at present
sitting as an arbitrator in the north At
lantic filsherles dispute.
Another eminent scholar is Dr. Estanis
lao S. Zeba'Ios, who has twice been min
ister of foreign afTairs, was minister to
the United States, is proprietor of Ea
Prensa, the leading- liberal newspaper of
Buenos Aires, and a voluminous writer
upon international law. Dr. Zeba'Ios is
an ardent admirer of the United States
and has written a book about the coun
try.
Dr. Saenz-Pena. Argentine minister to
Italy, and formerly minister to Uruguay
and Spain, was a delegate to the first
conference at Washington, in 1889, and
by his great ability and oratorical tal
ents made a distinct impression here. He
is the leading rand'date for President jt
the Argentine Republic.
Dr. Carlos Rodrigues-I^arreta was for
merly* min'ster of foreign affairs, is one
of the leaders of the Argentine bar, an
orator of treat distinction, and. with Drs.
Drago, Zebellos and Saenz-Pena. has
been designated by his government as a
member of the permanent court of arbi
tration at Th?> Hague.
Another'delegate is Dr. Montes de Oca
an eminent jurist, formerly minister of
the interior, and now professor of con
stitutional lav at the National Univer
sity. He we ; recently counsel for the
Argentine rr->ublic during the arbitration
of the bou- .lary dispute with Chile by
Kins- Edw d of England.
Other d legates are Dr. Jose A. Terry,
who has be?n minister of- finance, and is
now professor of finance in the National
University, and Dr. Ep'fanio Portela, at
present Argentine minister to Washing
ton, whose ability and charming person
ality have made him very influential
among the diplomatic corps of Washing
ton and popular in society.
There has been no intimation from
either the White House or the Depart
ment of State as to th? personnel of the
delegation to be sent to Buenos Aires by
this government, because no authority
for its appointment has been granted by
Congress. But these who are in the con
fidence of the President and Secretary
Knox know that they have several dis
tinguished gentlemen in their minds who
w'll b** asked to serve as soon as an ap
propriation is made, and, as Secretary
Knox has suggested in his letter, "it Is
extremely important that authority be
granted at once, because of the great
distance to be traveled and the necessity
of preparing for the consideration of the
questions that will be raised."
The program was prepared in 1908 by
the governing board of the bureau of
American republics here, which cons'sts
of the Secretary of State and half a
dozen of the ministers from Central and
8outh America. It Jias been approved by
most of the governments which will par
ticipate in the conference. This early
announcement was for the purposf of
giving the delegates plenty of time to
prepare for the discussions, and the gov

mini;
ernments interested to frame their in
structions. The actions of the confer-'
ences are not final. The conclusions take1
the form of recommendations to the sev
eral American republics upon questions
which interest them all. and the aproach
ing conference will be of unusual im- j
portance, both from a diplomatic and
commercial standpoint.
Disturbed by Secretary Knox.
The governments of the other American !
republics have been very much disturbed !
by the energetic policy which Secretary j
Knox has adopted in his treatment of
Chile and Nicaragua. It is something
entirely new in diplomatic intercourse,
and they do not understand it. For ex
ample, he recently gave the government
of Chile nptlce that unless it compiled
with his demands in the Alsop case in ten
days, lie would Rive the Chilean min
ister here his passports. The penial Mr.
Cruz, who represents the republic of
Chilo at Washington, believing that his
government would not yield, began to
pack his lares and penates in order to be
abls to leave the country immediately
when the time was up, and he spent
several sleepless nights trying to devise
some means of conciliating the United
States. But, finally, his government
yielded to the demands of Secretary Konx
and the Alsop cla m has been referred to
Klnj? Edward VII for arbitration.
The policy of this administration
toward Nicaragua is also giving the pood
people of the other American republics
a great deal of concern, and after an
exchange of cablegrams between nearly
all the capitals of America, Mr. Creel
wis sent here from Mexico to persuade
Secretary Knox not to create any radical
precedents which might disturb the har
mony of the hemisphere and come up to
plague us hereafter.
Mexico and all the other American
republics are exceedingly anxious that
tho United States will not set an example
of assisting or even encouraging a
revolution against constitutional author
ity, as we are now doing in Nicaragua,
because they cannot tell when they may
be in a similar situation. They are
very anxious that the government of the
United States shall not establish a pre
cedent of landing military forces upon the
soil of another nation without a formal
declaration of war. They consider it a
violation of sovereignty, and If it ta done
*
in Nicaragua it may be done elsewhere,
and we may acquire the habit.
They are also anxious that the govern
ment shall not establish a precedent by
interfering with the course of justice to
ward an executive of an American repub
lic. Secretary Knox has declared that
the I'nited States whl not stop until
President Zelaya has been punished for!
his barbarity In executing two American
citizens, but, while there is no sympathy
for Zelaya personally, there is an im
portant principle at stake, and the gov
ernments of the other American republics
do not concede the light of the Cnited
States to butt into purely local afTaiis.
Nor do they believe either that the I'nit
ed States has any right to dictate to the
people of Nicaragua whom they shall
choose for their president.
Tracle With South America.
All these questions are likely to come
up at the next conference, and it will
therefore be recognised that we ought
to appoint our wisest and ablest men
to represent this government there. The
commercial situation is encouraging. Al
though the volume of trade between the
LAtin-Ainerican countries and Kuro|>e has
fallen off considerably during the last
few years, the share of the I'nited States
is gradually increasing, and both im-,
ports and exports for the year l'JUl will
probably surpass all previous records.
The total trade will probably reach
000,000 for the year, as against $??{,000,
000 in 1908 and $1 ?<,000,000 ten years ago,
in the year 18WJ.
I'nfortunately, however, $175,OUO.OOO of
the S'Jfln.OOO.OOO consists of imports and
lees than half as much, $8."?.000.000. is ex
ports of merchandise from this country,
leaving a balance of $00.000,00O against us.
The imports, hQwever, consist of food
products and raw material* which do not
grow in this country and which are nec
essary for our prosperity. We must have
them; it is a good deal better to get
them from our American neighbor? than
from any other part of the world: and
the great increase not only shows the im
proved purchasing power of this country,
but the healthy condition of our trade.
Coffee is the largest item, and during
the ten months of the calendar year end
ing October SI the imports from South
America?chiefly from Brasll?have been
valued at $54,000,000. against $45,000.0110 In
the same months of the preceding year.
The imports of india rubber. a Iso chiefly
(from Bra7.ll, have l>een 132,000.000. as

| We are the greatest coffee drinkers 111
tiie world. The best qualities of the l?erry
i are sent to Euroi>e and the rest of th>*
crop, good, bad and indifferent, is dump
ed on our docks from every coffee-gro* -
lng country. W? use an average of about
twelve pounds per capita a year for every
: man, woman and child in our |>opulatlon.
During the ten months ending October
1 31. 11*19. we paid f?>4.fto0,Uftft for K45.ft0ft??ft
pounds of coffee, and had two months
more to com-plete our annual supply. Of
this amount, 049.4100,000 pounds came from
Brazil.
The other figures of trade sound stu
pendous. We have bought 73.001 uiftO
pounds of rubber this year thus far; i?v
(MMMNM) pounds of goat skins, ?jftK.nuft.ft'*>
pounds of hides, ^71.<?ft0.ftUft pounds of wool
and enormous quantities of other raw ma
terials to eat or for our factories to work
up into fluished products.
While the exports of American protects
to the neighboring countries are improv
ing. we have only a slight share of the
trade, and the total for the last ten
months Is 987.riUO.OOU. This represents re
fined petroleum, lumber, agricultural im
plements, railway supplies, and hardware,
wire and other articles of Iron and steel,
furniture, leather goods, lard and other
provisions, electrical machinery, type
writers and various otiier necessaries of
life.
