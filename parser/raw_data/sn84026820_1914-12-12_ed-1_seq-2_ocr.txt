patches say that fighting has taken
place near Ilow and north of Lodz and
at Piotrkow to the south. This would
indicate that the Germans have gained
almost thirty miles on both flanks be

Rivers. > '
Germany has repaired her terrible
losses between the Warthe and the
Vistula, has withdrawn battered ar
mies from the very jaws of the Rus
sian trap, has hurried vast reinforce

France, has solidified a battle line
which stretches from Miava, on the
frontier of East Prussia and Poland,
to Cracow, and is ready and deter

has had good health despite his curi
