Outflank the Anglo

Are Quite Clear, But Apparently

lies to Demirkapou Has Led to Re
port That They Intend to Abandon
Balkan Enterprise Entirely, But
They Continue to Land Troops.
LONDON, Dec. 8—(10:15 p. m.)—
The situation in the Balkans is devel
oping rapidly. The German and Bul
garian divisions have reached Kenali,
on the Greek border, 10 miles south of
Monastir, thus threatening to outflank
the Anglo-French forces, while the
Bulgars who are also supposed to be
supported by Germans, have attacked
the allies' extreme right wing near
Strumltsa.
Under this pressure the French
have withdrawn from the Krivnisk
salient and at last accounts had taken
up a position at Demirkapou, in a
deep gorge about 20 miles from the
Greek frontier, through which the Sa
loniki railway runs. Here they were
attacked by the Bulgarians, who, ac
cording to the French reports, were
repulsed.
The plans of neither the allies nor
ttye Germans are quite clear, but ap
parently the Germans are determined
on crushing the little force which went
to the assistance of the Serbians and
which has been and still is being re
inforced. The retirement of the allies
to Demirkapou has led to the report
that they intended to abandon the
Balkan enterprise entirely, but the
continued landing of troops at Salon
ika would seem to deny any such in
tention, while there is a very strong
military opinion here that Saloniki
should be held as a base for future
operations in the Near East.
There is little news from the other
fronts. The Germans have scored a
minor success in Champagne, where
they; captured about 500 yards of a
French trench, part of which, how
ever, has been regained: the British
have received reinforcements at Kut
El-Amara, where they are making
their stand after the retreat from Cte
siphon, and the Italians who, for the
last two weeks, have been on the of
fensive, are now engaged in meeting
the Austrian counter attacks.
The expected offensive of the allies
in Gallipoli apparently did not mater
ialise, while throughout Russia the
wintry weather has put a stop to all
but small ventures.

ENIN TO SI. LOUIS
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7—The demo
cratic national convention of 1916 will
be held at St. Louis beginning Wed
nesday, June 14, at noon. Tlie demo
cratic national committee tonight
named the convention city and adopt
ed resolutions calling for the renom
ination and re-election of Woodrow
W. Wilson as "the trusted leader of
national democracy."
Chicago and Dallas contested with
St. Louis for tlie honor of the conven
tion, but St. Louis easily led from the
start, and won on the second ballot.
When the trend of the voting was
seen,' Texas moved that the choice of
St. Louis be made unanimous. Dallas
held second place on the first ballot,
but was displaced by Chicago on the
second roll call.
The result of the first ballot was:
St. Louis, 25; Dallas, 14: Chicago, 13.
On the second ballot the vote was:
St. Louis, 28; Chicago, 15: Dallas, 9.
The majority for St. Louis was gained
on this ballot, when John T. McGraw
arose near the end of the call and
changed West Virginia's vote from
Chicago to the Missouri city. Then
the choice was made unanimous.
It has been customary heretofore for
national conventions to begin work on
Tuesday. The fact that Tuesday fell
on the thirteenth next year may or
may not have had something to do
with the determination of the com
mittee to begin the proceedings a day
later. The official explanation, how
ever, was to the effect that the conven
tion would not require more than
three or four days to complete its
work, and it would not be too late in
the week to start on Wednesday.
Political leaders in Washington to
night regarded it as practically cer
tain that Chicago would be selected for
the republican convention when the
national committee of that party
J. M. STAFFORD APPOINTED BY
JUDGE ROY AYERS TO ACT
AS FOREMAN.
CHARGE VERY COMPREHENSIVE ONE
The members of the grand jury
were selected in the district court
Tuesday morning and J. M. Stafford
was chosen as foreman, the person
nel of tlie body being F. R. Munkers,
Kendall: J. M. Cooper, Lewistown;
James Lodeman, Moore; H. W. Fish
er, Stanford; Fred A. Hortop, Hilger;
J. M. Stafford, Christina; A. L. Haw
kins, Lewistown.
John Biglen was appointed as bailiff
for tlie grand jury and tlie inquisitors
immediately took up their work, occu
pying tlie large examination room of
the county superintendent, which had
been fitted up for them. During the
day the jury visited tlie poor farm,
and in the afternoon it became quite
apparent that tlie Dunbar club, an or
ganization of colored men, was under
investigation. It was at this club that
"Rabbit" met Ills downfall a short time
ago. He had been sent to the bank
by his employer, Paul Schulz, with a
deposit and claims that lie was in
duced to engage in a game of chance
at this club, with the result that the
bank deposit dwindled slightly and
"Rabbit" wound up in the county jail.
The Charge.
Judge Roy Ayers' charge to the jury 1
was rather more elaborate than those \
usually given, and seems to cover j
quite fully all matters that the body ,
might be Instructed upon. Following ;
the general statement that the jury
was called to inquire into all violations
of law, but no evidence other than :
such as is given hv witnesses or fur- j
nislied by legal documentary evidence,!
or by exhibits was to be considered, j
Evidence for a defendant might be!
heard ns the judgment of tlie jury
dictated.
The jury was further instructed that
it must inquire into the case of every
person held in the county jail on a 1
criminal charge, or against whom an
information lias been Tiled; into the
management of all jails in the coun
ty; into any wilful or corrupt miscon
duct in office of public officers of ev- j
ery sort within the county. An accu-l
sation against any district, county, I
township or municipal officer for wil
ful or corrupt misconduct or malfeas-l
ance in office, or for charging and!
collecting illegal fees for services ren
dered or to he rendered in his office
or his refusal or neglect to perform i
the official duties pertaining to his
office might he presented by the grand
jury within which the officer accused
is elected nr appointed. The jury is
charged that it may at all reasonable
times ask the advice of the court or

meets next Tuesday. The date for
this convention probably will be late
in June.
Each of tlie three cities contesting
for the democratic convention put in a
bid of $100,000. St. Louis placed in
the bands of the chairman New York
irafts for that amount. Dallas offer
ed a certified check, while Chicago
presented a pledge front tlie Associa
tion of Commerce to contribute $100,
000 on call of the treasurer of the
democratic committee.
The advocates of St. Louis supple
mented their financial inducements by
a warning to the committee that the
convention was needed in Missouri to
keep the 18 electoral votes of that
state in the democratic column. The
delegation from Dallas pleaded with
the committee to reward tlie loyal de
mocracy of the soutli by sending the
convention next year to a southern
state. Tlie Texas speakers were
greeted with enthusiastic cheers by
the members of their delegation and i
the "rebel yell" several times inter- j
rupted the proceedings.
Chicago based its appeal largely on ]
its climate and its known ability to!
take care of convention crowds. The j
national committee was in session al- j
most continuously from 11:30 a. m. |
until late tonight, completing details 1
of convention arrangements .discuss-,
ing financial ways and means for the j
coming campaign and debating vari
ous subjects of party interest. The I
opening of the session was given tlie
atmosphere of a love feast when T. J.;
Pence of North Carolina, a protege |
of Secretary of tlie Navy Daniels, was
elected secretary, and in a speech of
acceptance declared reports of differ
ences between himself and National
Chairman W. F. McCombs had no

ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS EVER
DELIVERED TO THE CONGRESS OF UNITED STATES
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—President
Wilson in his annual address to con
gress today, dealing mainly with na-!
-
tional defense, proclaimed an advanced
Pan-Americanism growing from the
guardianship of the Monroe doctrine to
"the full and honorable association"
of all the Americans.
Although in the longest address he
lms yet delivered to congress, the
uuo J'-t uuncii.il til uiugl ron, llic
president touched upon a variety of
subjects; the predominating note was
tlie necessity of a policy of military
preparedness to meet the readjust
ments of the next generation as they
will affect the American continent.
He emphasized his point by saying:
"Unless you take it within your
\

,

j

j

i
, , .... .. „ . ...
view and permit the lull significance
ot it to command your thought, I
cannot find the right light in which
to set forth the particular matter that
lies at the very front of my whole
thought as i address you today. 1
menu national defense."
The point was not overshadowed
when the president, in the most un
measured terms he over has employed
before congress, denounced naturalized
Americans who, by their sympathies
for the European belligerents, have
endangered American neutrality,
While congress cheered him loudly, he
referred to them as having "poured
the poison of disloyalty into the very
arteries of our national life," and as
those who would "turn in malign re
action against the government and the
people who had welcomed and nur
tured them." With evidences of deep
feeling, the president expressed "the
even deeper humiliation and scorn
which every self-possessed and
thoughtful patriotic American must
feel when he thinks of them, and of
the discredit they are daily bringing
upon us."
While the president's outline of the
administration plan for tlie army and
navy passed without a ripple of ap-1
plause, and his references to Pan
Americanisms were only punctuated '
with evidences of approval, republi-1
cans and democrats alike joined in |
in enthusiastic demonstration at his
words of condemnation for those he
assailed so unreservedly.
The Message in Full.
Gentlemen of the Congress: Since
T last had the privilege of addressing
you on the state of tlie Union, the war
of nations on tlie other side of the
sea, which had then only begun to
disclose its portentous proportions,
has extended its threatening and sin
ister scone until it lias swept within
its flames some portion of every
quarter of the globe, not excepting
our own hemisphere, has altered the
whole face of international affairs
and now presents a prospect of re
organization and reconstruction such
as statesmen and peoples have never
been called upon to attempt. before.
Neutral in World War.
We have stood apart, studiously neu
tral. It was our manifest duty to do
Not only did we have no pait or
interest in the policies which seem to
have brought the conflict on; it. was
necessary, if a universal catastrophe
was to be avoided, that a limit should ,
he set to the sweep of destructive war
and that some part of tlie great fnm-!
ilv of nations should keep processes of [
j
peace alive, if only to prevent col
lective economic ruin and the break
down throughout tlie world of the in
dustries by which its populations are
fed and sustained. It was manifestly
the duty of the self-governed nations
of this hemisphere to redress, if pos
sible, the balance of economic loss
and confusion in the other, if they
could do nothing more, in tlie day
of readjustment and recuperation we
earnestly hope and believe that they
can he of infinite service.
In this neutrality, to which they
were bidden not only by their sep
arate life and their habitual detach
ment from tlie politics of Europe but.
also by a clear perception of interna
tional duty, the states of America!
have become conscious of a new and
more vital community of interest and
moral partnership in affairs, more
clearly conscious of the many com
mon sympathies and interests and
duties which hid them stand together.
There was a time in the early days
of our own great nation and of the
republics fighting their way to inde
pendence in Central and South Amer
ica when the government of the Uni
ted States looked upon itself as in
some sort tlie guardian of tlie reput
|
.ics to the soutli of her as against any I
encroachments or efforts at political
control from tlie other side of tlie
water; felt it its duty to play tlie part
even without invitation from them;
end I think that we can claim that
the task was undertaken with a true
and disinterested enthusiasm for the
freedom of the Americas and the un
molested self government of her inde
pendent peoples. But it was always
difficult to maintain such a role with
out offense to the pride of the peo

deuce and prosperity of the states of
Central and South America is not al

that has inspired us throughout the
whole life of our government and
which was so frankly put into words
by President Monroe. We still mean
ahvay8 to make a oolnnion ,, ause of
national independence and of political
liberty in America. Hut that purpose
is „ow better understood so fur ns It
concerns ourselves. It is known not
to lie a selfish purpose. It is known
to have in it no thought of taking ad

PRESIDENT EARLING WITNESSES
TRIAL ON FIRST UNIT OF
ELECTRIFICATION LINE.
BUTTE, Dec. 8.—Final tests were
made on the Chicago, Milwaukee &
St. Paul railroad today in connection
with tlie electrical transportation of
trains over tlie heavy grades of tlie
Rocky mountains. Today's trial was
a pulling contest on tlie Piedmont
grade east of Butte and was conduct
ed in the presence of a half-hundred
persons, Including A. J. Earling, presi
dent of the company, and his directors,
officials of the Anaconda Copper com
pany, several New York financiers
and a large delegation of Butte busi
ness men. In tlie presence of tlie di
rectors, a trailing train load of 2,200
tons was pulled by three of the heav
iest freight locomotives of tlie Mallet
type in the service of the St. Paul
system; then a trailing load of 3,000
.tons w a g drawn over the same grade
), v two of t j ie ] arge electric freight
locomotives. Tlie increased ease with
which the electric locomotives pulled
the heavier load, stopping on the
grades and then picking up their
speed, called fortli much satisfactions
from tlie observers. Tlie electric loco
motives apparently were not extended
and. according to the engineers, easily
could tiave hauled a much heavier
load. Tlie steam locomotives fairly
labored up tlie grade, groaning and
puffing under their load.

or abolish it. in such manner as siiall

applied that tieroie principle to the
case of Mexico, and now hopefully
await the rebirth of the troubled re
public, which liuii so much of which
lo purge itself and so little sympathy
from any outside quarter in the radi
cal hut necessary process. We will
aid and befriend Mexico, hut we will
not coerce her; and our course with
regard to her ought to he sufficient
proof to all America that we seek no
political suzerainty or selfish control.
The moral Is, that the states or
America are not hostile rivals but co
operating friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community of interest,
alike in matters political and in limi
ters economic, is likely to give them
a new significance as factors in lu
lernational affairs and in tlie political
history of the world. It presents them
as in a very deep and true sense a
unit in world affairs, spiritual part
ners, standing together because think
ing together, quick with common sym
pathies and common ideals. Sepa
rated they are subject to all the cross
currents of the confused polities of
a world of hostile rivalries; united in
spirit and purpose they cannot lie dls
appointed of their peaceful destiny.
This is Pan-Americanism. it has
none of the spirit of empire in it. If
is the embodiment., tile effectual em
bodiment, of the spirit of law and in
dependence and liberty and niiitiml
service.
Drawing the Americas Together.
A very noialile body of men recent
ly met in the city of Washington, nt
tlie invitation mid as tlie guests of
this government, wnose deliberations
are likely to he looked hack to as
marking a memorable turning point
in th history of America. They were
representative spokesmen of the sev
eral independent states of tliis hemis
phere and were assembled to discuss
the financial and commercial relations
of the republics of the two continents
which nature and political fortune
have so intimately linked together. I
earnestly recommend to your perusal
• lie reports of their proceedings and
of the actions of their committees.
You will get from them, I think, a
fresh concept ion of the ease and in
t- lligenee and advantage with which
'merlciins of both continents may
draw together In practical co-opera
tinn and of what the material foiln
datlons of this hopeful partnership of
Interest must consist of how we
hetlUi build them and of how neces
sary it Is that we should hasten their
building.
Tie re is, I venture to point out, an
i lee'al significance Just now attach
ing to this whole matter of drawing
I lie Americas together in bonds of
bnwunil le partnership and mutual ml
vantage hecnin'e of the economic read
be Uncnts which (he world iiuisl In
o' italilv witness within tlie next gen
"ration, when pence "111111 have al last
resumed its healthful tasks. In the
"orformnilee of these tasks I believe
• lie Americas to lie d"st'ned to idav
D'oir parts together. I am Interested
to fix your attention on tills prospect
now because unless you take It with
in your view and permit the full sig
nifietmee of it to command your
thought. I cannot find the right iighl
in which to set forth the particular
matter that lies at tlie very front of
my whole thought as ! address you to
day. I mean national defense.
Americans' Passion Is For Peace.
No one who really comprehends tlie
spirit of tlie great people for whom
we are appointed to speak can fail to
perceive that their passion Is for
peace, their genius best displayed in
the practice of the arts of peace. Great
democracies are not belligerent. They
do not seek or desire war. Their
thought is of individual liberty and
nf the free labour that supports Ilf"
and tlie uncensored thought that
quickens it. Conquest and dominion
are not in our reckoning, or agreenlile
to our principles. But just because
we demand unmolested development
anil the undisturbed government of
our lives upon our own prlncples of
right and liberty, we resent, from
whatever quarter it may come, the ag
gression we ourselves will not prac
tice. We insist upon security in prose
outing our self-chosen lines of na
tional development. We do more than
that. We demand it also for others.
We do not confine our enthusiasm for
individual liberty and free national de
velopment to the incidents and move
ments of affairs which affect only our
selves. We feel it wherever there ts
a people that tries to walk in these
difficult paths of Independence and
right. From the first we have made
common cause with all partisans of
liberty on Ibis side of tlie sea, and
have deemed it ns important that, our
neighbors should he free from nil out
side domination as that we ourselves
should he; have set America aside as

SERVICES HELD
The annual memorial services of
the Elks Sunday afternoon were
even more interesting than usual,
which is saying a good deal, lie
cause these exercises are always
of a very interesting character.
Tile exercises wen held at the Pres
byterian church, which was filled, and,
under the direction of Exalted Ruler
A. H. Stephenson, tlie program moved
along smoothly from beginning to end.
The altar was beautifully decorated
with flowers, plants and the Elk colors.
Directly in front of the pulpit stood
the new bronze memorial tablet, on
which is inscribed the names of the
departed brothers. On the pulpit
were the candles, which were lighted
and extinguished, one by one, as tho
names of the absent ones were called
by Secretary Leopold Beck.
Music Is Fine.
Tlie musical program Sunday was
especially fine. The orchestra, com
posed of Mrs. Emil W. Saxl, violin;
Mrs. T. P. Haller, 'cello; Mr. S. D.
Johnson, flute, and T. P. Haller, or
ganist, gave the Nieblunger march as
Uie Elks filed in. The "Angels' Ser
enade" was exquisitely done and tlie
final number was also fine. Mrs. G.
('. Appleton was the vocalist and gave
two numbers, first Bartlett's "Oh,
Lord, Be Merciful" and "Crossing the
Bur." A large number who had never
heard her before were surprised that
there was such a soprano in the city.
Both her numbers were beautifully
given.
The invocation was offered by Rev.
\V. N. Stevenson, while the benedic
tion was pronounced by Rev. George
Hirst.

Membera of the Democratic National

at White House—Kltchin Has Con
ference With Secretary McAdoo and
Announces That Bill Will Be Put
Through Before Christmas Holiday,
Continuing the Emergency Law,
Which Is Estimated Will Raise $80,
000,000 Annually.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.—President
Wilson told moinberH of tlie democratic
notional committee al u luncheon In
tlie stale (lining room at the White
House today that the republicans hud
no Issue for the next campaign ex
cept the tariff and that democracy
was certain to win.
"Our constructive work 1ms started
an Irresistible movement which can
not lie Htopped," he declared. "Any
one who lolls you otherwise is talking
through his hat."
Mr. Wilson suid nothing to Indicate
whether lie would uguln he a candidate
for the presidency.
Throughout the entire talk, which
dealt with subjects ranging from demo
cratic chances of victory to features
of the "life of the chief executive,"
the president was informal. Taking
his place at the head of the tuble, he
thrust Ills hands Into his trousers'
pockets, cast aside what he termed IBs
dress parade language, and talked
