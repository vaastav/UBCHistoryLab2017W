- LAND FRAUDS7
The offlcttt of tUcKov'Jmnjct Wn Joubt
leu Inform us that . a none or our butl"
ne, but Tor all that wc itg Icave t0 nquirc
what the eovpVumeot hopca to accomplish
In tbli fraudulent land entry hutlneat Tbe
cuauccn are that If a quarUr hectiou of
lana nan been fraudulently entered, tbe
party who practiced tbe fraud sold tbe land
to Innocent parties as toon as lie could get
rid of It. Does tbe government propose to
ueciare mis land forfeited and thus rob an
Innocent purchaser of his borne t When
wc comedown to a strict coiibtructlon of
the law there are, no doubt, hundreds and
nunureas 01 claim In tbls country that
Lave been Illegally enUrcd. Eldorado 7.V
pfllitau. Last winter there were four special land
agents appointed from Kansas, by the gen
eral government, Al. Green, Geo. Orncr,
luos. James and Tom Cavauaugb. Their
duties have taken them all over the United
Ssates, where public lands arc to be found
In view of tbe recent fraudulent entries of
lands unearthed in the Wichita district, It
may bo interesting to know what work Is
being done by these agents. Commissioner
Jlcrarlaud, of the general land ofiice, was
icisrviewed by a ctv York Trilunt report
er, wutn tie said, In answer to the question,
"Uow Is the system of special agents work-
ingj"
"The special agents have hem In the Held
about air months, and reports from some
of them are received every day. I have
examined and acted upon about 800 Illegal
unu irauuuicnt entries reported by them.
Those entries cow red about 128,000 acres,
of which the government would have been
deprived except for tho new service."
'In eighty cases only, out of the 600 ex
amined under this system, have objections
been oficrcd to the proposed cancellation
of the entries."
A very large per cent, of these lands have
been pre-empted by cowboys from the Tex
as anil Indian Territory ranges, and the
money for proving up has been furnlsbej
by ranchmen and cattle companies. The
lands were selected lying along the streams
reaching for miles and miles, said streams
were Immediately enclosed in wire leiico,
and In this way the poor settler coming In
to the country with a family and a half a
dozen bead of cattle was crowded out both
for the want ol water and land, as the best
land In tboe counties, in fact the only land
that Is stiseeptlblc of cultivation, is em
braced In tho valleys along the streams.
And tiulcss tlie.e fraudulent entries arc
cancelled and the land thrown open for set
tlement, us it ought to be, it will remain a
herding ground with only here and there a
settler when eery quarter section ought to
have a settler upon IL Senator Ingalls'
bill, just introduced, will defeat nil further
fraudulent entries. It proposes to amend
the homestead act by prohibiting commu
tation thereunder until two years have
elapsed from the dale of settlement, one
year of which must bo of record In the land
otllco. It also repeals the provision law un
der which local land ofllrcrs arc authorized
to receive relinquishments and Immediately
throw the claims relinquished open to en
try. In effect, It requires all relinquish
ments to bo forwarded to the commissioner
ol the gedcral land otllce and approved by
blm before the land In question is thrown
open to entry.
It is expected that the inauguration of
tbe measures proposed by these three bills
will result in limiting the amount or public
land a single Individual can securo under
government title to 100 acres. To secure
land under these bills, two years actual res
idence will bo necessary, with the payment
of ?1.U5 per acre. Five years actual resi
dence will secure 100 acres without tho
payment of money.
Stafford county people arc all torn up
about a railroad from Denver to Jlcmphis,
and propose to vote bonds to the amount of
three thousand dollars per mile for each
mile the road runs through the county,
which is a bad break for tbe Stafford coun
ty folks to make at this time. There will
be plenty of time to vote bonds to a railroad
company after the road has been built up
to, or near the county line, or at least after
Cii somo ol tbe road Is constructed, and not all
ijli.n paper. If the county tics herself up In
bonds to some company wbo perhaps do
not own a foot of railroad, but who pro
pose to build one beginning no place and

ongbtfore the time expires for building
the road for which the bonds arc voted, an
actual, live, lure enough road will appeir

by taking some other route.,AValt gentle

business-like, mattcr-of-lact paper. He re

lation existing between our government
and the Mexican republic, of the opening

Ing of a commission, with necessary power

postal telegraph system, but thinks the gov
ernment ought to exercise a supervision
over tbe telegraph business. Tho treasury
exhibit shows tho astonishing prosperity
and wealth of the country. For tho fiscal
year ending June SO, ?1.H,178,7.V or tbo
public dent was paid off, and there were
about ?400,O0O,000 IcR in the treasury. The
president thinks that National taxes can be
still further cut down, hut docs not advo
cate any sweeping reduction of tho reve
nues. The treasury department recom
mends that the tariff on sugar be taken off.
Senator Ingalls will soon Introduce a bill,
providing that any person who encloses an
area of public lands to which be has no ti
tle shall be liable to a fine of ?100 a dsy ror
the time such enclosure is maintained, and
any person who obstructs the passage of
another over or through the public domain
shall, lor every offense, pay the aggrieved
person 300.
Also a bill authorizing the rcsurvcy ol
townships erroneously surveyed or in
which monuments marking tbe boundaries
have been obliterated or removed.
Also a measure providing for annexation
to one of the Kansas laud districts and for
judicial purposes to the district of Kansas

and the Indian Territory, and authorizing
tho completion or Its survey.

WOY SHIRT AND SHOT GUN.
llr. Carlisle was elected speaker of tbe
lower bouse of Congress. He was backed
by a wild aouth and won. Wichita Eagle.
Why didn't tbe Eagle publish the ballot
taken la tbo Democratlccaucusf That bal
lot shows tbe statement or the Eagle to be
false. We give a portion or the ballot else
where in our columns, from which it will
be seen that Carlisle was backed as much
by a solid West and Xortb-west as by a sol
Id South. Tbe cry of "solid South," "con
federate brigadiers," "shot-gun policy of
tbe South," etc, etc., has been tbe stock
In trade of the Uepubllcon party lor years.
We do not believe, however, that it will
ever again be able to rfde Into power by an
appeal to tbe prejudices merely of one sec
tion of the country. Wellington iJemocrat.
' Well, let us see where the Carlisle vote
came Irom. In the Democratic caucus for
the nomination of a speaker, IBS votes were
cast, of which 83 were from the Southern
States. Or these, 72 were cast ror Carlisle,
19 for Ilandall aud 4 for Cox. In other
words, three-fourths of the "olld South"
went for Carlisle, and he received In addi
tion, only 33 votes. North or the l'otiniac
and cast or the Allegbantes he received but
one vote, that or Morse, or Massachusetts.
Or Ilandall's OS votes, only 33 were cast by
Northern members, aud or Cox's, 28 or the
32 were cast by Northern members. Thus
it will be seen that more than two-thirds of
the Northern votes were cast against Car
lisle, while three-fourths of the Southern
votes were cast for him. The "solid South"
had a majority ol only two votes in the
caucus, but It carried off four or the six
offices to be filled.
Mr. Carlisle, In a speech In 1S7G, during
bis canvass ror Congress, said :
"I deny that tbe United States is a Na
tion. It Is a vicious system that has de
stroyed sovereign States and oppressed
nine millions or people in the South, if a
State has no right of secessions, she cer
tainly has the right or revolution. The
ltepublicau party wants another amend
ment to the constitution. Why do they
want it? Is it not that the government
shall take the school fund into Its own
bands, and appoint a commissioner who
shall select the teachers and series ol books
to be used In the schools, and your ehild
and my child be denied the right to learn
the alphabet except In such a book a shall
learn them to lorget Wnshingtnn, Jackson,
Jefferson and the statesmen of Virginia
and the South"
We don't know what you would call sol
id if 72 out of llj is not solid. So lar as the
shot-gun policy and bloody shirt is concern
ed, allow us to call jour attention to the
late massacre at Danville, Virginia; but
then there were only seven killed aud they
were Ncgars, And when the States were
called, by the clerk of the house, fur leprc
sentatives to come lorward and be qualified
ninety of them could not swear that
they had never borne arms against the Uni
ted Stales, or furnished aid to her enemies.
"Do jou hear the rebel yell J" said one
ltandall Democrat to auoth.tr, when the
Democratic caucus bad nominated Carlisle
and his friends were cheering. The selec
tion or a Mlssotirian for chief clerk, Mr.
Clark, who was a brigadier-genera! of the
confederacy; a Texan Tor door-keeper,
three of the best places in the gift of the
house, means a "solid .South" ir it means
anything. And it mean that the country
is destined to hear the rebel yell a number
of times before the present scf sion of Con
gress adjourns. lu the language or Major
Edwards, Democrat, to bis paper In St.Joc,
"The Southern confederacy is again in the
saddle, and is pushing things."
INGALLS' LAND LAWS.
The three bills relating to public lauds
Introduced by Senator Ingalls, arc design
cd to materially simplify the operations of
the general land oflice,and change iu sever
al important particulars the method of ac
quiring title to public lands.
The first provides for the repeal of the
pre-emption laws, but authorizes a second
homestead entry by persons who, having
made one homestead entry, have, for any
reason (ailed to perfect title and who, at
the same time, never made filiug under the
pre-emption aet.
The second repeals the limber culture
law, but permits title to be perfected In ac
cordance with the provisions of that law
upon all claims entered before the passage
of tbe repealing act.
The third and last of the scries proposes
to amend tbe homestead act by prohibiting
commutation thereunder until two years
bavo (lapsed from date of settlement, one
year or which must be or record in tho
land office. It also repeals tho provision
of the law under which local land officers
are authorized to receive relinquishments
and immediately throw claims relinquished
open to entry. In efl'cct it requires all re
linquishments to be forwarded to the com
missioner of the general land office and ap
proved by him bcrorc the land in question
Is thrown open to entry.
Tbe eflect of this series or measures If
they became laws will be to limit the
amount of public land, a single individual
can secure to one claim 100 acres. Land
may be secured after two years' actual res
idence thereon by paying fcl.2 per acre, or
after five years' residence, for nothing.
The provision in respect to relinquish
ments Is designed to put a stop to the prac
tice or filing entries upon public lands and
holding them for the purpose of selling the
relinquishments to incoming settlers. Un
der tbe existing laws a citizen may obtain
three claims one each under the home
stead, pre-emption and timber culture laws.
He secures the timber culture claim with
out residence, aud maup purchase prc-emi-tlon
and homestead claim after six months'
actual residence.
FOR EX-SOLDIERS.
Representative Hill will Introduce a bill
at the earliest opportunity providing that
surviving soldiers or the late war including
privates, non-commissioned and commiss
ioned officers, shall be entitled to public
lands iu allotments graded according to
length of service, and widows and minor
children of deceased soldiers shall be enti
tled to the amount which would bo under
tbis law allotted to the husband or father.
Allotments of land shall be divided as fol
lows: To those wbo enlisted for three years
or during the war and served twelvemonths
or were honorably discharged after shorter
service lor disabilities received in the ser
vice, 100 acres ; to those wbo enlisted for
twelvo months and actually served nine
months, or were discharged after a shorter
period for disabilities Incurred In tbe line
or duty, SO acres; to those who enlisted Tor
three mouths, served three months or were
honorably discharged before the expiration
of their term or service, forty acres.
BELFORD'S RAILWAY BILL.
The bill introduced by Mr. liclford to
regulate railway traffic between tbe States
and Territories provides ror tbe establish
ment In the department or the interior a
bureau to consist or three commissioners
appointed by tbe president to receive a (al
ary of 910,000 each with the necessary and
proper expenses. Within ninety days after
tbe appointment or the beard, railway com
panies are required to forward a statement
of tbe franchises and present condition of
the roads. Power is conferred on tbe com
missioners to examine tbe books and records
or any person or company operating any
railroad. Tbey ore also empowered to pre
scribe tbe maximum rates to be exacted,
and make regulations touching tbe pack
ing and transporting of freight and tbe ac
commodation of passengers.
The Salt Lake AVsh (Mormon) has this to
say of the president's message:
The message will be nallca by mo Hire
ling clergy with pleasure, and will receive
an amount of 'popular support. It Is not
shown In what way the destruction of our
local government would effect the question
of polygamy. The plural marriages of the
MormoM are eot recognized by the terri
torial laws and could not be dissolved by
commissi, by edicts, by armies or other
earthly power. They are ecclesiastical,
perpetual aad eternal. Until the Mormons

STRAINING AT A GNAT.
The Constitution or tbls State provides
that no Justice of the supreme court or
judge or a district court' of Kansas "shall
bold any other ofllco of trust or profit un
der tbe authority of the State or United
States, during the term ot office for which
raid justices and judges shall be elected."
No law to enforce this constitutional
provision was ever enacted until last win
ter. The purpose of this constitutional pro
vision was to prevent judicial officers from
holding or seeking other civil places.
There is grave doubt, however, whether,
without legislation to enforce it, tbe pro
vision has any binding effect. A constitu
tional enactment docs not enforce itself.
It is doubtful, also, whether a State can
prescribe any qualification for a Represen
tative in Congress that is not prescribed by
the constitution and laws of the United
Stales, ir a Kansas judge was elected to
any State or county office during bis judic
ial term, he would undoubtedly be ineligi
ble, liut tbe position or Representative In
Congress is a United States, not a State of
fice, and the constitution and laws or the
United States specifically define the only
qualifications necessary to constitute eligi
bility to Congress.
Judge S. It. l'cters was elected a Repre
sentative in Congress from this State, in
November, 1882, by a majority or 10,502.
His term or office as judge had not expired.
An attempt was made to obtain an injunc
tion restraining the State Hoard ol Canvass
ers from canvassing his vote and granting
him a certificate of election. The courts
refused to issue such an injunction.
Now it appears Governor Click "aud
other State officers" have scut Mr. Spring
er, of Illinois, u protest against the admis
sion ol Judge l'cters, "on tbe ground that
under the constitution and laws of Kansas,
he is ineligible to bold office." There was,
however, no law of the State on this sub
ject until some months after Judge l'eters
was elected and had resigned his position
as judge.
The governor appears to be much dis
tressed over the awful results that might
follow this doubtful infraction of the con
stitution. Nearly one hundred thousand
legal voters ol Kansas a majority of 10,j02
of all tbe votes oast elected Judge l'cters
to represent them, llut the governor and
his adjutant-general wbo constitutes, no
doubt, the "other State officers" mention
edarc so distressed in mind and tortured
in spirit about it that they have sent to
Washington a foraial protest.
As the governor and his adjutant-general
appear to have developed a very ardent de
votion to the constitution and laws of the
State, aud aie sitting up nights devising
ways and means to prevent Congiess from
countenancing any infraction of them, it
may not be out of place to direct their at
tention to tho following section of the con
stitution of Kansas:
"The manufacture and sale of intoxicat
ing liquors shall be forever prohibited iu
this State, except for medical, scientific
and mechanical purposes."
This constitutional provision was supple
mented by the enactment of a stringent
law, providing penalties lor its violation.
The governor and his 'other State officers""
meaning his adjutant-general, for no oth
er State officer signed that "protest" took
a solemn oath to respect and support tho
constitution and laws of Kansa. It would
be much more creditable to them if they
would devote some of their time, energy
and influence to the duty of cntorclngthese
provisions of our constitution and laws
which are entirely within their jurisdiction
rather than to destress themselves over a
technical and doubtful Infraction of a con
stitutional provision by the action of Con.
grcss. The governor ami his "olhcrSlatc
officer," while straining at a gnat arc swal
lowing a very large camel. They are at
tempting to defeat by a quibble the will of
the people, fairly expressed In the election
of Judge l'eters, while at the same time
they arc neglecting a plain duty near at
hand. They are distressing themselves
about a shadowy infraction of the consti
tution away off at Washington, while ig
noring and encouraging the substance or
constitution-smashing and law-breaking at
home. Champion.
UNA ABROAD.
Chicago, December 7th, 1SS3.
To the Editor of the Eaglt.
Never 111 the experience of your corres
pondent, which extends over a period of
well, it doesn't matter bow many years,
women generally arc indefinite as to figures
which betray their age have the streets of
this great, enterprising city seemed more
full of lifo and activity. Turn which way
wc will, there arc throngs ol people rush
ing in every direction, at almost any hour
of tho day, aud naturally, tbe query arises,
"where do all these people come Irom?"
State street, the liroadway of Chicago, Is
like a vast panorama, and n few days ago,
securing a good post or observation, at the
imminent I isk or being jostled out or my
position, 1 determined to enjoy the"show"
In a leisurely manner. Though lacking the
charm of novelty, these street scenes can
never cease to attract mc. Matinees in
stifling halls, where God's glorious sun
light Is carefully excluded the "subdued"
light from gas being preferred may have
their devotees, but give mc a drama in the
opou air a little smoky though it may be
where natural characters arc unconscious
ly playing their part. A rcslle9s, sway
ing, surging sea of humanity, ah! what a
study. Stately matrons, elegantly attired,
pass up the marble steps of a "first class"
dry-goods store. They are or the "crcme
do la crcme." A little further down tbe
street, an immense stock r goods or every
variety draws patrons from all ranks and
classes. Silvery-haired and feeble grand
pas pass Into the basement, where are
found all manner of toys and trinkets dear
to tho hearts of the little folks. On the up
per floors, mothers and grandmas probably
find pretty things to combine the useful
and ornamental iu the toilets of the girls,
and if I cau read aright, many oftlicru coin
ing out with great parcels will be glad to
be rid ol the bore or "shopping," and pass
It to tho girls afore mentioned. Of course,
rrom my ccrner, I can't sec what purchases
are made, but cau do n good deal of guess
ing. Somo of the young men going Into a
large jewelry store opposite, look to the
right, then to the left, as if fearful of being
pursued. It is easy to guess their errand
and the cause of their embarrassment.
Young ladles seem to like going alono to
make their purchases, tbclr motive Is quite
apparent. There 1 a pretty blonde has
dropped her parcel.aud the paper has burst,
displaying a yes, it js a smoking cap.
Weil, I hope It is ror somebody who is old
and too confirmed a lover or tho weed to
mend. It would be too bad to give that cap
to a young man. It is so pretty he'd want
to wear it all tho time, and 'twould make
him bald, ror It is so warm.
How some ol the men dodge through the
crowd! I vvoudcr if they have learucd
that some women have sharp elbows? Men
and women, Utile and big, pretty and plain
the women, I mean, who ever heard of a
pretty" man? all trying to get there first.
Only tbe young folks can afford to take
time to look about tbem. Dainty misses in
"Mother Hubbard" cloaks, with fair young
faces peeping out from under the brims or
those guant fancies called "Kate Greena
way" bonnets, almost make one wish to be
young again. Tiny midgets of misses, in
zephyr hoods unit fleecy cloaks, prattling
merrily and "blppety-hopplng" along,
throw out a temptation to kidnap, but a
wholesome fear or the law Is a restraining
power.
What food ror reflection one can gather
In a few minutes spent In watching pass
ers-by. How the expression of a face will
linger in the memory, and tbe tone of some
strange voice sound in the ear for many
days.
My next study will be In some ol the es
tablishments that are calling out tbe
crowds, of whom I've been writing. II in
the rush, I am cot wholly extinguished, I
may tie heard from again. Uka.

BOOMING WICHITA ITS INSTITUTIONS
RAILROADS, PARK, ETC.
Wichita, Decembers, 1883.
Ta the Editor of tt ConmovieeaUJk .-
You go over Kansas In all its parts, tbls
glorious year ol 1SS3, and each locality you
visit seems to be exceptionally prosperous ;
each town with a boom of its i-wn. Yet
there arc few, If any places la Kansas,
which exhibit so largely tbls feature as
does Wichita. Its streets are crowded
with loaded wagons, and wheat and corn
overcrowd the capacity of Its many eleva
tors. Tbe bridge over tbe Arkansas river
Is crossed by a thousand teams a day ; one
day lately a count Was made, aud the num
ber reached thirteen hundred. Its hun
dred restaurants show rrom tbe streets ta
bles filled with eating farmers. Its old
time frame rows of one-story buildings are
everywhere broken in upon by new brick
blocks, or two and three stories. Its hotels
arc crowded full. Its sidewalks on Doug
las avenue and Main street are thronged.
Its ftreet railway, two miles Iongand more,
seems to have a profitable patronage. Ky
tbe way, Mr. Uartzell tells me tbat an ex
tension or little more than another mile
will be made In tbe spring. This will take
the track to his park, which is a truly beau
tiful spot. It lies, almost surrounded by
water, at the junction of tbe Little River
with tbe Arkansas. Along one tide ol the
park, the first-named forms a sheet or wa
ter not equaled Iu the State. A mile stretch,
straight, deep and wide; such another
place tor boating is not to be round in the
Wot. Tbe park has a fine track ror speed
ing. Mr. Uartzell showed mc its qualities
behind his black pacing stallion,.Sam Haz
ard, record, 2:18.
The amount of freight received over the
three railroads coming into Wichita from
the cast is away beyond the capacity of a
tender foot to realize even to believe.
Forty to filty carloads of merchandise, coal
and lumber arc received and unloaded
daily ; nor do the cars return empty, for
the grain men want them all.
The city has settled down to a satlslac
tory daily use ol lis water works and of
its street railway, but has not yet become
accustomed to its latest Institution thegas
works. The gas has now been in use but a
few days, and the gaslitters and plumbers
arc raising Ned everywhere putting it into
buildings.
Prosperity, push, boom on all hands; no
small part or it due to the work going on
in extending railroads beyond. The A.,T.
.t S. F. extension has track laid fourteen
miles west, with prospect of regular train
to Kingman by February. The Fort Scott
t Wichita has bridge material on the hank
of the Arkansas, and about ten dajs hence
Will be pushing it line towards Anthony.
All this Is one side of the picture. New
comers will see the oilier side as well, but
it is so familiar to periodical visitors like
mc as to fall out or mind. Wichita has no
natural beauty. It lies spread out on fiat
sand, skirted on the river side with some
natural growth limber. Industry and taste
have added shade H ees, fruit trees, slirun
bcry, very line residences, etc, still the
foundation alwavi. will tie Hal sand. Its
churches arc many, some of them very
line; the same 1. true of its saloons.
A POOR AUTHORITY.
It appears from an iutcrview with Rev.
D. N. Utter, published ill the Chicago Trib
une, that he obtained ino-t of bis alleged
faets he embodied in his article on "Old
Osawatomie ltrown" Irom George W
Itrown, who publMied the Lawrence Jlir
ald of Freedom many years ago. Dr. Utter
quotes a very poor authority. George W
ltrown was known in Kansas as a man of
violent prejudices, given lo drawing facts
Irom his hates. He hated old John llrown
lutcnscly. "Old Osawatomie" was a man
of extraordinary courage ; George W. was
known as a man or equally extraordinary
cowardice. Old John was a radical; Geo.
W. was a constitutional conservative. Old
John was an enthusiast and fanatic; Geo.
W. was cautious, timid, insincere anil cal
culating. Tho tno men entertained a cor
dial distrust ami dislike for each other, and
Geo. W's. bitterness was such that he
would believe aud circulate as true any
story be ever heard to the discredit of "Old
Osawatomie.' Dr. Uttet could not have
quoted a more prejudiced and untrust
worthy authority concerning old John
llrown than George W .Champion.
PETITION FOR A SOLDIERS' HOME.
The petition previously mentioned iu tho
dispatches as being prepared asking Con
gress to establish u Soldiers' Home in Kan
sas, has been completed and was forwarded
to Senator Plumb. It contains 20,000 names
and is handsomely bound, making n book
as largo as Webster's dictionary.
Public l'rintcr Hounds and his foreman
set all the type for the president's message,
read all the proof, and took the number of
copies required in advance on a prool press.
All this was done at tbe Soldiers' Home
with the purpose or preventing the news
paper men from stealing the message. Mr.
Hounds had not set type since he was a
boy, but he did the job like a veteran.
At it again. Just as soon as the Democ
racy gets a show of regaining control of
the government they begin to show their
hand. Some of tho-cx-'lavc holders ol Tex
as are preparing to make a demand on the
government for the value of their emanci
pated slaves.
Tho men who murdered McMillcan at
Emporia, a short time since, have been dis
covered in the peron of J. E. Tierce. A
lad about fifteen years old named Elmer
Heed, vvhasc home is in Emporia, tells the
whole story. They are both iu jail.
President Arthur advises Congress to
abolish legislative governmcut in Utah and
to establish a commission authorized to ad
minister justice and enforce whatever leg
islation Congress may itself provide for the
government or that territory.
Wc have no grudge against Alrica, and
TCt we cannot lnrhcar the sweet hope that
Dave Payne will give special attention to
that portion of the president's message
which sets forth the alluring features of the
Congo valley. Emporia Sent.

"The Old Reliable"
It is jjo longer necessary to speak iu unccttain terms of the capabilities
of Kansas. She stands pre-eminent among tho agricultural States of the West
lite acknowledged queen. Aud
States the region comprising tho lower Arkansas and Ninnescali Valleys is
to Kansas the garden spot of the State.
The last ten years have demonstrated beyond question that Southern
Kansas is more genial iu climate, more bountiful aud certain iu productions,
than any other portion of tho West. Nowhere else in all our broad land do
these conditions Tiuite in such hannouy to make possible the establishment
of the ideal fanner's home. Many such arc springing up into living pictures
and adorn the landscape on every hand.
Tho projection of two lines of railroad from Wichita west and south'
wot through the county and beyond opens tip a hitherto practically undevel
oped country, where lands are still cheap, and than which there is nothing
better in the State. Tho ricks of wheat and dark green Holds of com over
laden with heavy ears sccu on every
lands.
We have taken pains to extend
our books many thousand acres not
priced lands in the Arkansas Valley mid adjacent thereto but equally rich
lands farllicr west and south, at prices accommodated equally to the p'clhorie
purse of the speculator and the more
