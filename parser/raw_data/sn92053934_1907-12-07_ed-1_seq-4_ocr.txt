Bryan Sounds Keynote.
On the occasion of one of the largest
and most representative gatherings of
democrats ever assembled in nortncni ;
Illinois, at Freeport yesterday, W. J.
Bryan sounded the keynote of demo
cratic success in the national cam
paign to be waged next year. The great
commoner spoke to three immense
crowds, a banquet in the evening, at
which COO sat down, being the culmin
ating event of a day, in which the
honors accorded Bryan were shared by
J.. Hamilton Lewis of Chicago, candi
date for the Illinois democratic guber
natorial nomination.
Tariff and currency reform, compul
sory labor arbitration, and stringent
regulation of the trusts were the is
sues Mr. Bryan presented in his char
acteristic forcible style. Such a meas
ure of success as the party in power
has enjoyed, and such popular policies
and reforms as the present president
has attempted to inaugurate, Mr. Bry
an asserted with correctness and em
phasis, involve the adoption and ap
plication of democratic principles.
The Nebraskan also spoke for har
mony within the ranks of the demo
cratic party, the wiping out of internal
political differences, the putting away
of personal grievances, and the union
of all forces whose object is the ad
vancement and enforcement of true
democratic principles.
It was a sound and logical position

his ideas from
An Utile as Possible.
The congress that has just assciu
! bled in Washington will have a great
many important matters presented for
its consideration, but probably will
take definite action on. but few. It is
the "time-honored" policy of the re
publican party to do as little as pos
sible at the session of congress imme
diately preceding a presidential elec
tion. This leaves so much less for the
party to be criticised for. The repub
lican party prefers a general mdict
ment for sins of omission rather than
a bill of particulars for sins of com
mission. But the demands of the country may
be so important that the G"th congress
will have to overthrow precedent and
actually do something. Stjwng efforts
may be made, even within the ranks
of the party itself, to bring about a
revision of the tariff, but the advocates
of tariff reform are not listeuing to
the delusive whispers of hone and Ihev
really expect nothing along this line.
The republican lawmakers who as
sembled in Washington this week win
try and "mark time'' instead of re
sponding to the desire of the people
for a "forward march."
Beatrice thrilled with excitement as
the low buildings oii the river's edge
came into sight. To lier the dlngy-Mi-tranc-e

She wished that Ben might be there
to see the company start, but Itatsey,
the ferret eyed little stage manager,
had announced that none of the chorus
girls might be accompanied to the
train by friends or relatives under
penalty t of a five dollar fine. He was
nervously pacing the cobblestones in
front of the entrance every minute to
make certain that the rule would not
be broken.
On the block above the ferry house
leave takings were plentiful, but the
"house Itself was free of a crowd of
weeping relatives nnd mournful "gen
tlemen friends." '
' "You are Miss Faber?" asked Ratsej
In bis quick, tense tones as Beatrice
came up. "You bunk with, Miss Stil
liugs; berth 0, car 2. Better get right
over and go to led before the train
pulls out."
"I thought I might be able to get a
berth by myself," protested Beatrice
"I am willing to pay the difference."
"I have no time to make a chang?,"
said ItatsVy impatiently. "After the
opening night you may, do as you
please, but the management pays to
the opening town, nnd you will kindly
permit us to arrange matters. Miss
Stilliiiffs has gone over already. You
will timl her there." ,

would oppose Postmaster General
Meyer's scheme for a parcel post.
The country merchant sees clearly
what a parcels post would do to him.
He would be unable to compete with
great- mail-order houses in the big
cities when the government delivered
their goods at almost no expense to
them. Nothing then would be left for
him but bankruptcy and ruin.
Therefore the Association of Com
iueice. wnich is an organization of
merchants, city and country, has de
clared itself against the postmaster
general s project. The association has
adopted resolutions to that effect, bas-
ng the action on the facts that the
pioposed parcels Post law would be
class legislation, tending, toward so
cialism; that it would cause discrim
ination among different classes of citt
zens and that there is no demand for
it except among government officials.
The postoffice department now Is
run at a loss and taxpayers are un
willing to add to the deficit by allow
ing the department to act as a parcel
delivery and express company for
few city merchants, at the expense of
a large and valuable section of the
population of the entire state outside
of Chicago.

ii'.iout the'other's shoulders.
"It's this way." explained Miss Stil

Beatrice. "I studied for the profession

Mrs. Purroy quieted down soon, bnt
Beatrice lay awake thinking of her
words.
This was all very different from
what she had anticipated. Her par
ents were not rich, but she was used
to living well, and the whole reality
wns very different from her anticipa
tion. It seemed that she had. only
fallen asleep- when a pillow banged
against her head and a voice announc

The dressing rooms at either end of
the car were filled by the early birds,
and there was a long wait before
Beatrice could get to the washstand,
and then her toilet was accomplished
under difficulties because of the
laughing, pushing mob of girls that
filled the place to overflowing.
She was sick and tired when tho
train pulled Into Washington, and tho
girls were hustled across the street for

was distinctly bad, and as Beatrice
