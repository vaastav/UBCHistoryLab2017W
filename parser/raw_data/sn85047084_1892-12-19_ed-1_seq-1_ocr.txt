THE MESSAGE IN BRIEF.
This is the President's message
boiled down for busy men:
President Harrison begins his mes
sage to Congress with an array of ng
ures from the eleventh census, which
show that the commercial and indus
trial conditions of the country are
crood. Since I860 the wealth of the
DeoDle has increased 287 per cent, and
the mileage of railways has increased
448 per cent. Since 1880 the capital
invested in manufacturing has been
increased by over six hundred million
dollars, and in all branches of enter
prise there is general prosperity.
A paragraph is devoted to tin plate,
in which it is stated that thirty-two
companies are manufacturing that
article -at the rate of over forty million
pounds a vear. Labor Commissioner
Peck is Quoted to demonstrate the
growth of manufacturing in New
York, and Massachusetts is cited as
an example of industrial progression
The President reviews the production
of iron and steel and foreign tratle,
and makes comparisons of the present
volume of exports and imports with
the annual average of the past ten
years. The value of exports during
1892 is shown to be 34 per cent.
in excess of the average for the
ten years prior to 1891, and
the imports during 1892 have exceeded
the annual average for me same ten
years by $135,000,000. The growth of
internal commerce, savings banks ae
posits and bank clearances are also re-
counted as lurtner evidence or me
countrv's development.
Work has been abundant and wages
have been high, "whether measured
by the currency in which they are
paid or by their power to supply the
necessaries and comforts of life." The
farmers have been prosperous in spite
of the fact that the prices of wheat
and cotton have been low. The total
value of farm products has increased
by 230 per cent since 1860, and the dis
contented are admonished to remem
ber that conditions which seem hard
would be acceptable in any other
country.
The President expresses his belief
that the protective system has been a
mighty instrument for the develop
ment of the national wealth and that
it has been a blessing to the working
men. He concludes that it cannot be
a perversion of the Constitution to
legislate on their behalf, but he does
not directly renew the argument in
favor of a protective tariff.
The result of the election is accepted
bv the President as proof that the
American people desire a change of
policy on the tariff. He declares that
the contest has not been merely for
a change in the tariff schedules, but
for a change of policy, and the first
direct recommendation of the rnes
sage is that the whole subject of tariff'
revision be left to the incoming Con
gress, although the work must be de
layed three months with the country
in a state of uncertainty in tue mean
time.
President Harrison is not, however,
disposed to take a pessimistic view of
the situation. While declaring his
own conviction that a lower tariff
will be disastrous, he observes that
those who have advocated a protec
five tariff" can well afford to have
their forecast of a change of policy
disappointed. If the Republican
party is proved to have been mistaken
then the promoters ot a tan it lor rev
enue only will be entitled to the
highest praise. Nevertheless, the
President does not refrain from dwell
ing upon the contrast between a rev
enue and a protective tariff from the
Republican standpoint, and states his
belief that under a low tariff the
American workman will not be able
to compete with his foreign rival.
Referring to the Homestead and
other labor troubles, President Har
rison thinks they have been unfavor
able to a calm consideration of protec
turn's real effect upon wages.
The attention of the countrv is in
vited to the work of the Administra
tion and the results that have been
achieved. All public business has
been transacted with fidelity and
public revenues to the amount of
$1,414,079,292.28 have been collected
and disbursed without loss or irregu
larity. Our relations with all foreign coun
tries are pleasant. The Samoan diffi
culty with Germany, the trouble with
England about the Behring sea and
the Chilean affair have all been ad
justed. Reciprocity has been estab
lished with many of the Central and
South American countries. This
promises a great increase in the vol-
umeof business. The establishment
of American steamsbip lines would
secure fully one-third of tbe South
American tw.de.
Referring again to the seal question
in the liennug, tne message recom
mends that no power be given to the
President by proclamation to prohibit
the taking ot seals in tne ionura-
cific by American vessels. The stat
utes do not restrain united states cit
izens from taking seals in the Paeihc
Ocean, and should not until the prohi
bition can be extenueu to tne citizens
of other nations. A treaty with Orreat
Rritain concluded last February pro
vided that the dispute should be sub
mitted to arbitration, and it was also
agreed that pending the result pelagic
sealing should be prohibited. It is
believed that during tins last season
the catch by poachers in the uehnng
amounted to less than 500 seals, al
though over 35,000 were taken in the,
North Pacific while the herds were on
their way to the Aleutian Islands.
In the matter of trade relations witn
Canada a conference between Mr.
Blaine and the British Minister, at
the latter's invitation, had resulted in
nothiug toward extension for the rea
son that the Canadian government,
through three Commissioners at the
conference, was prepared to offer the
United States only the admission of
natural products in return for the con
cessions asked. It was considered that
the benefits of an exchange of natural
products would be almost wholly with
Canada. The conference did result in
the making of a convention for the
examination of the Alaskan boundary.
The President then reports his action
concerning the question of the canal
tolls, wherein our treaty rights nau
been disregarded, and discusses the
successful competition of the Cana
dian transcontinental railway in se
curing business that has its origin in
the United States. tie recommenus
a radical revision of our trade rela
tions with the Dominion and the con
struction of an American canal around
the falls of Niagara to open commun
ication between the great laices anu
the sea.
Our relations with Hawaii have
been such as to attract an increased
interest, and must continue to do so.
I deem it of great importance tnat
the nroiected submarine cable, a sur
vey for which has been made, should
be promoted both lor naval ana com
mercial uses. We should nave quick
i . i
communication. We should before this
have availed ourselves of the conces
sions made manv vears ago to this
Government for a harbor and naval
station at Pearl River and the many
evidences of the friendliness of the
Hawaiian Government that have
been given in t'iie past, and it is grati-
fying to believe tnat tne auvaniage
and necessity of a continuance of very
close relations is appreciated.
The President's previous recom
mendations of better support to the
Nicaragua canal are repeated. " It is
impossible," he says, "to overstate the
value from every standpoint of this
great enterprise." He hopes Congress
will give it an impetus tnat win in
sure its early completion and secure
it to the United States.
After speaking of the Monetary
Conference now in session, the Presi
dent savs that the free coinage of
SHi
silver upon an agreed internat
ratio would promote the interests
our people. The message then recites
the saliant points in the reports oi
the departments and recommends the
repeal of the sinking fund law. It is
urged that subsidies be granted to
build up the merchant marine, that
the policy of enlarging the navy be
' continued, and that some of the Indian
appropriations be increased, lhe Pen
sion Office is declared to have been
conducted with fidelity. The message
then touches upon quarantine regula
tions, the Columbian air, recom
mends legislation for the better pro
tection of railroad employees and a
Congressional inquiry into election
methods. It is severe upon the lynch
ing of colored people in the South and
closes with favorable comment upon
the nation's progreso. San Francisco
