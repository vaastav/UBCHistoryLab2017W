THE OFFICIAL RETURNS.
THE NEW GOVERNMENT.
[From the National Republican.]
The Returning Officers yesterday
morning published the official count
Com-1 for Presiden tial Electors, Governor,
Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of
I State, Auditor, Attorney General
the and Superintendent of Public Edu
cation. They had previously offi
cially announced the names of the
also gentlemen who compose both
houses of the General Assembly,
the It is a gratifying fact to the Repub
the licans that the returns were placed
in the hands of a man of the known
the honesty of Senator Lynch, of the
of I fidelity * of Geo. E. Bovee, of the
clear and trained legal intellect of
Jacob Hawkins, and of the unflinch
of ing courage of General James Long
street.
TIie following is the vote cast for
Governor : Kellogg, 72,$00; Mc
the Enery, 54,029.
For Lieut. Governor— C. C. An
toine, 70,127; D. B. Penn, 56,340.
For Secretary of State P. G. Des
the onde, 71,511; S. Armstead, 54,294
For Auditor—Chas. Clinton, 71,'

For Attorney General-A. P. Field

I For Superintendent of Public
Education— W. G. Brown, 70,075;
R. M. Lusher, 56,715.
in Governor Kellogg will bring to
the his aid as the chief magistrate of
this State not only a large expe
rience in the Senate of the United
States, a ripe scholarship and a
! perfect knowledge of law, but an I
{acquaintance with the needs of the
State, which few men in our midst
posses. His services to North Lou
isiana. are well known and appre
ciated.

State of his adoption from Congress
[than all his predecessors combined;
I ^ representing, as he does, men I
I of a11 political opinion^ we know

be such as to elicit the admiration

clamor against his return.

I C1 ty» that, as the presiding officer of I
the State Senate, he will.discharge
I C. C. Antoine, as à representative
I black man, will enter upon his du- 1
as Lieutenant Governor with a I
J knowledge of them. Being in I
the State Senate almost since the
I Free State party came into power
a here, he is thoroughly familiar with
aU thelaws passed; and we know,
Jfrom the able manner in which

ment by the strong sections of the

j The new Secretary of State, Mr.
I Deslonde, is also one of the wards
of the nation. He possesses that ®
class of ability which qualifies him
to fill the post of Secretary of State j
to advantage. TTi« large majority I®
lover ,his opponent shows clearly '
that the people knew what they.
I were about in choosing him. j S
I Chas. Clinton is a merchant of |

I that the people knew what they
j this city, of known p^pbity. He is a J
leadi ng church member, and though] not
I many may scofif at this being urged 1 of
J M a qualification, we feel convinced but
(that those who know Mr. Clinton
personally, recognize in him the
J sincere Christian, who follows the J or
[teachings of his Master in humility I
j •
and in truth. Mr. ' Clinton is the
Assistant Treasurer of the United
States for this district, and the
money of the General Government,
having been entrusted to his keep
I ing, it is safe to infer that the State
I can repose full confidence in his
honesty to administer the office of
of Auditor honestly, and to the best
interest of the whole people of the
State.
A. P. Field won his election by
I hard and assiduous labor. He
fnade the campaign in person;
marching over the State and brav
ing the Democracy in its stronghold.
As a lawyer, A. P. Field has long
stood at the head of his profession,
having a practice here as a crimi
nal lawyer which made him famil
liar with the laws. We know the
Colonel to be a man of large heart, I
and he brings to his office an experi
ence which runs back nearly half a
century.
W. G*Brown, Esq., theSuperin
tendent of Public Education, is a I
man of color. For a long time edi-1
tor of the L ouisianian —a paper
published by his race and exercising
a wide influence—his scholarly ar
tides have attracted the attention of
the leading journals of the country,
We have no doubt Mr. Brown will
I l«>k closely to the interest of those
who atténd the the public schools,
His majority over his competitor, I
Mr. Lusher, is some 13,000, which
in itself is good evidence of his I
popularity. I
The Presidential Electors are all J
men who are respected in this cum
munity. Dr. M. F. Bonzano has
I devoted a long and useful life to I
scientific pursuits, and we unhesi
tatiugly say that even his political
enemies cannot breathe a word of
reproach against a reputation which
is noted for high and lofty results,
Dr. L. C. Roudanez, who has
been selected to cast the vote of the
State for Grant, is a remarkable
I man. Loving freedom, he at his I
own expense published in this city I
I a Republican newspaper for a long !
time, when the party was in its in
fancy here. As a practicing physi
cian he haa few equals and no
» - - — '
superiors in our midst, and nothing
1 but a love of principal and a feolingl
I of duty could prompt him to leave I
his home for the capital. > I
The other gentlement are too I
well known to require any more
extended notice.
On the whole we are proud of
our new State Government and we
know the people will give it a hearty
support upon its inauguration.

In the Senate, however, there was
ar- better representation.

The Comptroller of the currenoy
has published his annual report in
which, among other important
items, is presented the fact that
since the Organization of the Na
tional bank system, in 1863, only
21 National banks have failed of
their aggregate circulation—$2,942,
793. The Treasury has reduced
$2,441,430, and stands ready to
redeem the balance as soon as pre
sented. The holders of these notes
however, are in no hurry. Very
likely but few of them are aware
that the banks have failed. Not
one man in a hundred looks at the
name of the bank issuing the note.
Every body knows that there is
provided a fund ample for the re
demption. When we compare the
present liability of our circ ulating
medium with the wild cat eras of
the past we realize something af the
magnificent character of Republican

point of stability has been readied.
Within the true limits of the system
it is how proposed to introduce
