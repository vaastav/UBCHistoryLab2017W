CONCERNING CELERY.
Principal I'opnlnr Vnrletles—lJleoeh
lull nntl Winter Stornjje.
At the lthode Island station a study
has been made of the principal varieties
of celery in cultivation in this country
during the past fifty years. The prin
cipal modifications that the celery plant
has undergone in the last half century
are found to be the greater localization
of the fleshy growth in the center of the
plant, self blanching tendencies and
earlier maturity. According to Profess
or Kinney, the varieties that have been
recognized by growers as having spe
eial merit are Sandringliam (Incompar
able Dwarf). Boston Market. Golden
Heart, White Plume, Rose. Paris Gold
en and Giant Pascal. The Paris Gold
en or Golden Self Blanching celery is
the variety generally grown iu the local
market garden of Rhode Islaud.
Summarizing for the different sta
tions. success has been oftenest report
ed with White Plume. Paris Golden
and Giant Pascal. The Paris Golden
is preferred, according to the Rhode
Island station, by marketmen because
It never has the strong, bitter flavor
sometimes present In White Plume not
properly blanched. White Plume seems
to be more resistant to the black heart
disease than the Paris Golden. Giant
Puscal Is one of the largest varieties
grown.
Blanching: 'With Earth or Boards.
At the Pennsylvania station a test ,
was made on the relative merits of ■
blanching with earth and with boards. 1
In some cases celery blanched with
boards was ready for market earlier
than that blanched with soil, but the
celery so blanched was decidedly In
ferior and, as a rule, was long, slender,
pithy and bitter, while that blanched
with soil was exceedingly large, crisp
and tender.
Planting For Winter lie.
C. R Waldron of the North Dakota
station advises that celery for winter
use planted In boxes, cellars or pits
should have the roots pruned back to
two Inches in length, and the bunches
should also receive considerable top
pruning, but the outer stalks should
not be stripped off. White Plume Is
the best variety so far for general eul
ture.
Gronn In Shade.
The New Jersey station reports ex
perlments iu shading young celery.
Six varieties were tested in this way,
and all grew to more than double-the
size of other plants of the same lot
that were In the full sun. but later lu
the season, with shorter days and less
light, the exposed plants overtook aud
surpassed the shaded ones.
rtnble American Women.
Mrs. Alec Queedu, a prominent Eng
lish woman, who visited the United
Btates last winter, says
"There in no doubt about it. English
though I am, I candidly admit that
American women, taken en masse, are j
more affable iu manner and generally
better educated than the average Eng
lish woman. They are eonstantly strir

I faticv that if questioned most peo
ple would :i, tiun ;i sheet ~(■ paper
•would not float for any h'tigth of tine*
on Wat. r .mil ecituinly would not bear
any weight. But experiment proves
the contrary. Indeed the number of
things that can In- done with floating
paper will not only surprise old people,
but will furnish amusement for chil
dren. A sle-et of ordinary writing pa
per, if properly adjusted, will float for
an apparently indefinite period. Four

a test were dry on the upper surface

But what surpri -ed me most of all

was experimenting with them. 1 rather
j carelessly placed a large wooden spool

j course, to see the paper goto the bot

| however, and my aroused curiosity
I prompted me to add greater weight.
Recklessly 1 laid my four bladed pen

Sen rolling For u Soul,
Before th" astouished eyes of a num
ber of Paiisians a singular funeral cer
emony took place the other day.
A resident property owner in the Rue
Malte-Brun had just died. On the even
ing of liis death, when darkness had
fallen, his relations, five or six in uunv
ber. each provided with a lantern,
slowly made the circuit of the garden,
as if they weie searching for something
in the walks. When they came to a
large heap of stones, they turned each i
one of them over and then re-entered
the house.
This curious procession is an old Nor
man custom. The dead person was a
native of the country near Glsora. Be
fore Interring the dead It Is necessary,
according to the tradition, to investi
gate and see that the soul of the de
ceased Is not concealed in a corner of
his property or under some rubbish.

She heard him rummaging around In

tones came drifting down the stairs.
"Where In thunderation," he growled.
"Is that last summer's fedora shaped
straw hat o' mine?"
"The time has come," she murmured j
hoarsely to herself, and then she:
donned a fedora shaped straw hat that ■
was hidden behind the piano. It was j
wrapped around with liberty silk, aud
it looked bully on her fluffy hair.
"Here it Is," she said when she got to
the top of the attic stairs. "I cleaned
it with lemon Juice and fixed it for j
myself. Saved you $17.35 for n sum

Then the man was unreasonable and
churlish enough to storm and to de
mand of her when she intended to j
begin wearing his shoes and smoking
his pipes.

The \Vil«l Stvnn.
Every morning at sunrise the swan i
lifts himself laboriously from the water j
and files straight Into the very eye of j
the sun. I suppose he is a sun wor
shiper, and that is his way of paying
his morning devotion to his god. For a
mile or two he tiles straight for the
great golden orb as it rises out of the
sea; then he grows discouraged—for all
his devotion he seems to come no
nearer heaven; so he makes a wide
circle, embracing sea and land in a
three mile radius—you can hear him a
mile away beating the air with splen
did measured strokes that carry him
at a marvelous speed through space;
then he describes a smaller circle, and
when he has finished his second round
you may see that he has fixed his eyes
once more upon the little pond which Is
his home; for his long heck—how ab
surdly long it seems when stretched
straight out as now—inclines slightly
downward as though he would, if he
could stop himself, settle at once. But
apparently that settling business is not
so easily accomplished, for lie must
circle twice or thrice aroun'l the pond
before, with a long downward swoop,
he comes with a great splash into his
domain.—Longman's Magazine.
"Pussy."
The origin of the name "pussy" Is ex
plained by Our Boys and Girls as fol
lows:
Many years ago the people of Egypt
worshiped the cat. They thought that
she was like the moon because she was
more active at night and because her
eyes changed, just as the moon
changes, which is sometimes full and
sometimes only a little bright crescent
or half moon.
So these people made an idol with
the cat's head and named it Paslit, the
same name which they gave to the
moon, for the word means the "face
of the moon."
That word has been changed to
"pas." or "pus," and has come at last
to be "puss." the name which almost
every one gives to the cat.
