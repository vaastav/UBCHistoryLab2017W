WHO SHE WAS
SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF LYDIA E PINKHAM
And a True Story of How the Vegetable Compound
Had Its Birth and How the Panic of 73 Caused
it to be Offered for Public Sale in Drug Stores
This remarkable woman whose
maiden name was Estes was born in
inLynn
familyFor
For some years she taught school and
became known as a woman of an alert
L3 1
and investigating mind an earnest
seeker after knowledge and above
all possessed of a wonderfully sympa
sympathetlo
thetic nature
In 1843 she married Isaac Pinkhara
a builder and real estate operator and
their early married life was marked by
prosperity and happiness They had
four children three sons and a
daughter
In those good old fashioned days it
was common for mothers to mal e
their own home medicines from roots
and herbs natures own remedies
calling in a physician only in specially
urgent cases By tradition and ex
perience many of them gained a won
derful knowledge of the curative prop
erties of the various roots and herbs
Mrs Pinkham took a great interest
In the study of roots and herbs their
characteristics and power over disease
She maintained that just as nature so
bountifully provides in the harvest
fields and orchards vegetable foods of
all kinds so if we but take the pains
to find them in the roots and herbs
of the field there are remedies ex
pressly designed to cure the various
ills and weaknesses of the body and
it was her pleasure to search these out
and prepare simple and effective medi
cines for her own family and friends
Chief of these was a tare combina
tion of the choicest medicinal roots
and herbs found best adapted for the
cure of the ills and weaknesses pecu
liar to the female sex and Lydia E Pink
hams friends and neighbors learned
that her compound relieved and cured
and it became quite popular among
amongthem I
themAll this so far was done freely with
out money and without price as a
labor of love
But in 1873 the financial crisis struck
Lynn Its length and severity were too
much for the large real estate interests
of the Pinkham family as this class
of business suffered most from
fearful depression so fond theCenten
nial year dawned it found their prop
erty swept away Some other source
of income had to be found
At this point Lydia E Plnkhams
Vegetable Compound was made known
to the world
The three sons and the daughter
with their mother combined forces to
Ike I Adairs N ill
The will of Ike C Adair who died at
Fordsville recently leaves most of his
property to his wife and daughter This
statement is given out by members of
the family the will not yet having been
offered for probate He leaves 1000
to his mother Mrs Sarah Adair The
electric light plant at Hawesville is be
queathed to his sistersMrs Mary Whit
worth and Miss Dood Adair He left
100 each to the Methodist and Baptist
churches of Fordsville and the Catholic

No Printers In Penitentiary
Until a short time ago an ably con
ducted and quite well edited little paper
was published within the walls of the
Ohio penitentiary It had an assured
circulation and to all appearances was
destined to live long and prosper But
it disappeared without warning and
inquiry as to the cause developed the
restore the family fortune They
argued that the medicine which was
so good for their woman friends and
neighbors was equally good for the
women of the whole world
The Pinkhams had no money and
little credit Their first laboratory
was the kitchen where roots and
herbs were steeped on the stove
gradually filling a gross of bottles
Then came the question of selling
it for always before they had given
It away freely They hired a Job
printer to run off some pamphlets
setting forth the merits of the medi
cine now called Lydia E Pinkham
Vegetable Compound and these were
distributed by the Pinkham sons In
Boston New York and Brooklyn
The wonderful curative properties of
the medicine were to a great extent
selfadvertising for whoever used it
recommended it to others and the de
mand gradually increased
In 1877 by combined efforts the fame
ily had saved enough money to com
mence newspaper advertising and from
that time the growth and success 01
the enterprise were assured until to
day Lydia E Pinkham and her Vege
table Compound have become house
hold words everywhere and many
tons of roots and herbs are used annu
ally in Its manufacture
Lydia E Pinkham herself did not
live to see the great success of this
work She passed to her reward years
ago but not till she had provided
means for continuing her work as
effectively as she could have done it 1
herself During her long and eventful expe I
rience she was ever methodical in her
work and she was always careful to pre
serve a record of every case that came to
her attention The case of every sick
woman who applied to her for advice
and there were thousandsreceived
careful study and the details includ
ing symptoms treatment and results
were recorded for future reference and
today these records together with
hundreds of thousands made since are
available to sick women the world
over and represent a vast collabora
tion of information regarding the
treatment of womans ills which for
authenticity and accuracy can hardly
be equaled in any library in the
worldWith
With Lydia E Pinkham worked her
daughterinlaw the present Mrs
Pinkham She was carefully instructed
in all her hardwon knowledge and
for years she assisted her in her vast
correspondenceTo
To her hands naturally fell the
direction of the work when its origina
tor passed away For nearly twenty
five years she has continued it and
nothing in the work shows when the
first Lydia E Pinkham dropped her
pen and the present Mrs Pinkham
now the mother of a large family took
it up With women assistants some as
capable as herself the present Mrs
Pinkham continues this great workand
probably from the office of no other
person have so many women been ad >
vised how to regain health Sick wo
men this advice is Yours for Health 1
freely given if you only write to ask
for it
Such is the history of Lydia E Pink
hams Vegetable Compound made
from simple roots and herbs the one
great medicine for womens ailments
and the fitting monument to the noble
woman whose name it bear
fact that there was not a single convict
convictI I
in the institution who could handle
type The last printer in the pen
had served his time and secured em
ployment in Cincinnati where they
made him superintendent and there
was none to take his job in Columbus
Nor has there been since although
there is plenty of other talent to be
had For instance there are enough
bankers there more than twenty and
several on the way to start a clearing
house and enough lawyers to take care
of all the business the frenzied financi
ers can bring them to say nothing of
doctors brokers and other eminently
respectable citizens gone wrong

stand by its decision to confine the
Japanese school children to the orien

message to congress will not affect
their position according to President
Altmann of the board who announced
that the board will do all in Its power
I to correct the impression given out
by the presidents message which
says that the Japanese are excluded
from San Francisco public schools
Washington Dec 5 President
Roosevelts discussion of the San
Francisco school situation in the rues
sage was received with great dissat
isfaction by the California delegation
in the house The members of the
delegation from that state are unani
mous in their declaration that no
treaty rights have been violated In ex
eluding Japanese from public schools
attended by whites The suggestion
in President Roosevelts message that
naturalization bo extended to Jap
anese Is extremely distasteful to the
California delegation In the house
West and South find themselves in
sympathy on two propositions Ono
Is the race issue the other is the sug
gestion of federal Intervention to en
force the terms of the treaty with
Japan It was the suggestion of using
all the forces civil and military of
the United States that touched the
spot with tho Californians They had
not expected at so early a stage of
the discussion to have the adminis
tration suggest using military power
against them
In the senate Mr Rayner of Mary
land Introduced the following resolu
tion on the Japanese question Re
solved that In the opinion of the son
ate this government has no right to
outer into any controversy with any
foreign government relative to tho
public school system of any of the
states In the Union resolved further
that It is the opinion of the senate
that there Is no provision In the treaty
between tho United States and tho
government of Japan that relates in
any manner to this subject or In any
way Interferes with the right of the
state of California to conduct and ad
minister its system of public schools
In accordance with Its own legisla
tion and resolved further that It Is
tho duty of tho president of the Unit
ed States to notify the government of
Japan and to notify any foreign gov
ernment with which the question may i
arise that the public educational in
stitutions of the state are not within
the Jurisdiction of tho United States
and that the United States has no
power to regulate or supervise thcl
administration
Resent Administrations Stand
San Francisco Dec GThe feeling
In San Francisco Is nigh The city and
parts of the state are openly bitterly
and resentfully opposed to the admin
istrations stand in regard to the
school question in San Francisco The
people believe the Japs are seeking to
find a cause for a quarrel with the
United States and have chosen the
San Francisco school situation as the
bone over which to pick a quarrel and
start a war If California Is to ra
main one of the United States de
clared the commissioner of labor for
California then It must stop invasion
and settle the question Tho Japanese
are swarming Into California at tho

the antiAmerican feeling is beginning

taken place is the burning of the
splendid Grant memorial erected on
tho visit of the distinguished general
