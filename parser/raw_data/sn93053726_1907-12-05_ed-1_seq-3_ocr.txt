FISHER TELLS STORY
Never "Qualified" as Engineer
! Between Here and Ansonia.
The story of the accident on the
railroad near the acid works March
2, last, about 1 o'clock iu the mflrn
ing, was told to-day by the man
charged with responsibility for it,
William Edward Fisher, the engineer
of the train which was carrying Gov
ernor Woodruff and staff and the New
Haven Grays to New Haven. Three
men were killed iu that accident,
Fisher's fireman, E. G. Ericksou, and
the engine crew of the other train,
Carpenter and Norton. I'receding
Fisher's story, John J- Reiley, car
Inspector testified that he inspected
Fisher's train before it started on the
return trip from Waterbury and he
found it all right. Matthew Kenny,
yard foreman, testified m a similar
strain and then-Fisher was recalled
to the stand.
He testified that during the year
preceding the date of the collision he
made about fifty trips to and from
Waterbury and New Haven, mostly
as an engineer of freight trains. Then
he stated that he had never qualified
as engineer to travel between An
sonia and Waterbury. Qualified meant
accustomed to the landmarks along
the way. To qualify, he said, an en
irinppr 'rides with another engineer.
who shows him the landmarks and
switches and everything that he is
supposed to know about the road. He
was never given oruers iu uuhihj i
travel between Ansouia and Water-
bluT- ' . . ..
It was about 4 oc-locK on tne artei-
noon of March 1 that he got orders
about bringing the Grays back to New
Haven. He reported for auty at i
o'clock and he was given his engine.
and he immediately ascertained if it
was all right for the trip. He, found
everything in good shape and at 9:30
o'clock he started off with his crew
and reached Waterbury at lv:20
o'clock. Before starting from New
Haven he timed his watch with the
clock In the dispatchers omce. tie
found the tracks in the Waterbury
vard full of freight and they were
slinnerv and ley. for it was drizzling
and it froze as it fell. The time he
passed in Waterbury waiting for his
train to take the Grays and Governor
Woodruff back, he occupied arouud
his engine and in the telegraph op
erator's office. His orders were to
leave here at 12:30, but he did not
start until 12:42, as the Grays were
not ready.
Before leaving here he read the
orders about the return trip to d.o
fireman, who was a new man making
his first trip that night. Erickson
heard and evidently understood every
word of the orders. Fisher consider
ed Ericksou too zealous iu his work
and he helped him make his fires.
As the train was passing inrougu
the yard Fisher saw a switch open
and ' though the Bignalman, Fitzsim
mons, whose duty it was to see that
the switches were all right, was on
the cab with him, he was about to get
off the cab to close the switch when
Fitzsimmons Jumped off and closed
It. There was no light on the cab
save the light that shines on the
steam gage. Passing the Holmes,
Booth and Haydens shop the train
was traveling at fifteen miles an
hour. Fisher said he was looking for
switches all the way out, leading to
what he called ''long branch,' a tech
nical name for a part of the track.
Another part Is known as "Coney Is
land," and both are below the Wash
ington avenue crossing. Fisher did
not see the bridge near the factory,
but he felt it and recognized he was
passing over It because of the souud
underneath. Further on lu his testi
mony Fisher stated that qualifying
for a road meant to become acquaint
ed with the sounds that are heard on
it, such as come from wooden cross
ings, steep grades, rough and smooth
parts, and that In fact on dark night
such as March 1 and 2 was. trains are
engineered as much by sound coming
from the roadbed as by the sight and
sense of the engineer.
Resuming his testimony Fisher said
there was no natural light lu the sky
that night and be could not see the
landmarks along the track. The
headlight ou the engine was ioor,
owlug to the rain freezing on it as It
fell. In fact the purpose or tne ueao
light is not to assist lu ruuuln the ; recommendation that congress appro
val u. but for the protection of life nrit mmnalim funds for political
on running over grade crossings in the
night time.
After passing the simps of the
Holmes. Booth and Hayden firm
Fiaher put up steam till he came to
S hiring .VS,
hour. He hw
a switch light on Ins
right. His head was out on th sul
window and all his attention was dim-ted
towsrd locating Hill's siding.
The light lie aw Indicated to him

dazed and I walked along hard!
knowing where I was going. But t
knew there must be a farm bouse
somewhere and I found one. I asked
the folks if there was not a trolley;
line near by somewhere and ' they,
said there was, and told me bow to
reach it. I saw a trolley come along;
and I went to New Haven. There I
got lost again. I don't know what
happened until the next day I found
myself in the house of a friend, Mc
Higgins."
Taking him back to the ' railroad
track again, h counsel asked him If.
there was any change in the track
after Hill's siding had been extended
and he said that part of the siding
had beeu put lu the main line. He
denied getting any signal from Con
ductor EatoR'at any time an said
that if the conductor had operated the
air whistle he could not have failed
to hear it. Fisher said he was In
good condition physically and mental-
ly that night and that he is not given
to periods of abstractedness or absent
niindedness.
"I did not run past the siding In
tentionally," he said. '1 don't know
how I did it except that my judgment
was at fault between the rate of
speed of a freight and the rate of
speed of a passenger train. I .was
more accustomed to the former."
He was certain that he shut off the
steam before the crash came and that
naturally he decreased the rate of
speed the moment he saw the head
light of the other engine.
