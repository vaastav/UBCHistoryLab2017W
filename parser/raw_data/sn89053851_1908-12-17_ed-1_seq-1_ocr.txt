plies and haul passengers.
Last week Paradise entertained a

The hoisting plant of the Juco
mine, at Chloride in Mohave county,
was last week destroyed by fire. The
upper set of timbers in the shaft was
burned out and it is feared that the
boiler and machinery have fallen in
to the shaft. The loss will aggregate
several thousand dollars.
Miles Archibald assumed charge of
the affairs of the United States cus
tom house at Yuma last week on ad
vices fiom Washington, pending the
arrival of the man who is to take the
place formerly held by Pat J. Sulli
van. As this is a civil service posi

ness.
Henry Aiken and W. J. Buford, who
went as repsesentatives of a party of
Bisbee people, to inspect certain lands
in Oxaca which were being offered
for sale by a Kansas City syndicate

proposition as a fraud in the strong
est possible terms. They state that
the land is worth about twelve and a
half cents per acre.
Bisbee is threatened with an
epidemic of scarlet fever, and it is
said that the disease is springing up
all over the city. Up to the latter
part of last week fourteen cases were
known to exist and parents were ask
ing permission of the school trustees
to keep their children at home from
school until the trouble is over.

concussion of the brain, the lesult of
a fall in which fourteen other boys
who were with him on a hand car had
a mi-iaculous escape from death.

its fifteen young riders, to the rocks
eighteen feet below. Six of the tMys
were badly bruised and lacerated,
but Stewart was the only one serious
ly injured. His young companions,
seeing him lie so still, concluded that
he was dead and hastened to call as

Excelsior Pushing Work on Tunnels.
I). M. Clark arrived last week from
the Excelsior group of mines in the
Walnut Grove district, where he and
his partner, John Brady, finished two
new camp buildings. He is arrang
ing to start sinking a new shaft and
resume work on one of the tunnels
now in 100 feet.
Clark is very jubilant over the pros
pect of opening a large ore body in
the tunnel. The pa vstreak is six feet
thick in the face, carrying fair
values in gold, s
The property is situated nine
miles southeast of Kirkland, three
miles northwest of the Monica mine
and a mile south of Moore's spring.
It was discovered and located by
Brady six years ago. Clark's pur
chase of an interest followed a thor
ough examination made of the ledges
covered by the locations last year.
There is "HO feet of development on
the group in shafts and tunnels, with
promising ore showings in every
opening.
A new position has been created in

Million Dollar Deal.
The Globe Belt reports that the In
spiration properties have been option
ed to New York parties. It is re
ported that the deal called for the
payment, by December 8, of $250,000
for development work, and the
further payment for development
work and equipment, within two
years, of 1750, 000.
The plan for reorganization con
templates the is-uauce of one million
shares at $10 par value. Four hun
dred thousand of these shares are to
go to the purchases, 300,000 to the
stockholders of the old company, and
300.00.) into the treasury, with the
purchasers holding a two-year option
upon them at par.
The plan of distribution to the old
stockholders will be one share for ten.
The deal is the achievement of
Thomas Kavanaugh, of Tucson, who
recentlv visited the property with
Henry Krumb. a well known mining
engineer.
The property owned by the Inspira
tion Mining company, of which J. D.
Copien is president and general man
ager: J. B. Copien, superintendent,
and E. F. Wilder, of Kansas City,
secretary, was located by Bud Wood
son, William Beard and Charles Holz-
man, who sold it to J. D. Copien, Mr.
Copien organizing the company of
which he became the head.
The Inspiration, situate about eight
miles west of Globe and adjoining the
Miami and Keystone properties, is
considered one of the most valuable
groups in the Globe district, its ores
being of much the same character as
those of the Miami, which has 12,000,
000 tons of 3 per cent, sulphide ore in
sight.
The acreage of the Inspiration is
larger than that of the Miami, and
both mines are on the same great
ore deposit.
The Inspiration has about 1500 feet
of development work, principally in
tunnels, which has brought into sight
1,500,000 tons of sulphide of about the
sime grade as the Miami ore. Re
cently, the Mercer tunnel, the deep
est working on the I ispiration, has
been driven 20 I feet in sulphide ore.
The or- deposit, as far as pros
pected on the Inspiration. i 1200 feet
wide.
With the New York capitalists to
whom reference is made in the dis
patch to the Silver Belt, it is under
stood that W. H. Tho npson, of Bos

were addressed to James McCormick
by a man who had just arrived in the
city and who was then negotiating
for the purchase of one of McCr.r

McCormick was lost on tle Mojave
desert. He did not return to the

A searching party was organized,
this man being one of the members.
"After combing the desert for a
time they came across the mummified
remains of a man. The features
were distorted out of all recognition,
but it was thought the corpse was
that ot McCormick. It was buried on
the spot, and no one suspected for a
long time that the remains interred
were not really those of "Old Jim."
Lter. however, news came that
McCormick had been seen at another
point. alie and well. This morning
when a member of the searching
party called upon Marshal Moore and
asked him if one of the men in the
citf i til did not have a burro for sale,
he dnl not expect to meet the man
he once thought he buried.
The well known legal firm of Strick
ler ft Stanford of Bisbe-; has dissolved
partnership and the members will
henceforth engage in practice under
their individual names, and while
they expected to be associated in
practice in the futare, it will not be
as partners.
News from Prescott is to the effect
that the new owners of the Humboldt
-melter, who recently purchased it at
receiver's sale, are making arrange
ments to resume the reduction of ore
in the near future. The new owners
are said to have set aside a fund of
1 1.000,000 for the purchase of ores.
The report comes from Douglas that

President Roosevelt's Last Message.
We give herewith some of the
more important extracts from
President Roosevelt's last message to
congress.
It is worse than folly to attempt to
prohibit all combinations as is done
by the Sherman anti-trust law: its en
forcement works almost as much hard
ship as good.
I strongly advocate a law which
shall expressly permit combinations
which are in the interest of the
public, with the government exercis
ing full power of control and super
vision. Power to make combinations and
perfect agreements should be ex
plicitly couferred upon the railroads,
the permission of the interstate com
merce commission being first gained,
and the combination or agreement
being published in all its details.
Telegraph and telephone companie s
engaged in interstate business should
be put under the jurisdiction of the
interstate commerce commission.
There should be regulation by the .
national government of the great in
terstate combinations, including al
simple method of account keeping, j
publicity, supervision of the ise of '
securities, abolition ot rebates and of j
special privileges.
There should be short tiu.e fran- j
chises for all corporations engaged in
public business.
Corporate finances must be super
vised so as to make it far safer than
at present for i he man of small means '
to invest his money in stocks.
There should be a progressive in
heritance tax on large fortunes. So
far as possible we should lighten the
burden of taxation on the small man.
It is eminently right that the nation
should fix the terms upon which great
fortunes are inherited. They rarely
do good and thev often do harm to
those who inherit them in their
I ent irety .
The power of injunction is a great
equitable remedy which should on no
account be destroyed, but safeguards
should be erected against its abuse.
Provision should be made that no
injunction or temporary restraining
order issue ot herwise than on notice
except where irreparable injury would
otherwise result.
No reference is made to the tariff.
The complete message contains a
trifle over 20.000 word.
Two soldiers from Fort Hnaeliuca
are under arrest at loinostone,
charged with stealnr and killing a
voung beef on the range of the Green
Catte company near Hereford. They
do not deny killing the steer, but say
it was accidental and they used the
meat rather than let it go to waste.
I They will have a hearing at Hereford

in a few days
Recently the Tom Reed mill sent
out auother of those $50,000 bricks
for which it has become famous the
past year. The clean-ups are getting
bigger and better as work in the
mine progresses and U will soon be
necessary to haul out the big chunks
of gold with a four-horse team. It is
said that the works on the lower
levels of the mine show better ore
than above and that everywhere an
opening has been made good ore is
shown up.
This Is Worth Reading.
Leo F. Zelinski, of (X Gibson St.,
Buffalo, N. Y., says: "1 cured the
