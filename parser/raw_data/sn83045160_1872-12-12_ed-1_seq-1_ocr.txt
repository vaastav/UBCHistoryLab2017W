New York, December 11. The Are
at the fifth Avenue Hotel last night
broke out shortly after seven o'clock, on
the second floor of the hotel. The stair
case upon which the Are started, was
one at the back of the house, leading
trotn tbe laundry in the tiaaement to the
servants' rooms on the attic floor. The
flames ran rapidly up the stairway. It
was as a chimney, their being no open
ings from it but at the top and bottom.
They ate up the staircase, and charred its
surroundings, reaching the open space
into which the rooms of the servants
opened, where they hurst into their fullest
strength. The flames in their passage
did little or no damage until they
reaehed the corridor at the top. the
draught driving through the narrow pas-saee-way,
carrving tbe flames quicker,
and making them more destructive as
they went on. They spread over the en

The flames spread so rapidly that the

of the staircase, were overtake u before
tanee could reach them. They
won completely shut off from the main
building. The Bremen, who had pi the
meantime arrived, were too late for as
sistance, as by this time tbe aiuirtments
of the KXr creatures were enveloped in
flames. Shortly alter one o'clock it was
found that a number of persons were

by means of an iror. ladder to the room
where the people were supposed to be.
They there found the charred, burned

and furniture were strewn about the
rooms, while

lay at different places, from which the
poor people had tried to find means of
egress. Some had endeavored to escape
through windows; others, in their en
deavor to Snd air, had fallen at the bend
the staircase. the bodies of rv
women were found half concealed under
a bed in a

i outer room, where they had
tried to shelter themselves
from the blinding, suffocating smoke
and scathing flames. When the firemen
and police got into the whig tbe floors
of this room were sound, but some of
the timbers were burned and had fallen
upon the floor in a confused mass upon
the bodies. The water which had been
thrown from the hose was several inches
deep upon the floor, and was filtering
through to the ground. Heavy beams
of tbe roof had fallen upon the burned
boilies, severing tbe limbs and mutilat
ing the remains horribly. The bodies
were speedily removed to the Bellevue
Hospital, from whence they will to-day I

confusion and excitement tbe names of
tbe victims could nt be ascertained.
Up to twenty minutes past two o'clock
TWENTY-TWO DEAD BODIES
had been recovered, sixteen in one room
and six in another, which is probably all.
The alarm was first given by one of tbe
female servants, who shrieked "fire!"
through the hallways, awakening the
iruests, of whom there were about five
hundred in the hotel. Many of the
guests went to the office and inquired as
to the excitement, but were informed by
the clerks that there was only a little
fire iu the laundry. Their attempts to
keep the tire quiet to avoid a panic,
helped to bring about the terrible result

men were making their way to rescue
them. Large crowds had iu tbe mean-

little effort made to save the unfortunate
The whole subject will, no doubt,
be thoroughly investigated. The losses
are estimated at from one hundred and
thirty to one hundred and fifty thousand
iollars.
OKKlIX OF THE FIRE.
There are various statements a to the
origin of the fire. One says it was
caused by the bursting of the steam-pipe
in tbe laundry. Some seventy or eighty
servauls altogether were awakened on
the top floor and hurried down stairs.
Their clothing was utterly rained.
A fireman named Deeny was seriously
injured by falling through the crevice to
the pavement.
The bote; furniture was worth about
four hundred thousand dollars; fully
one-fourth of this was utterly rt'ined.
The house is owned by A. R. Eno, but
is leased to Darling, G'riswold A Oi.
Just before tbe alarm, a guest was as
signed a room, which, on reaching, he
discovered to be on fire. He returned
to the clerk, and was informed that
there was no other room vacant. The
fire was not known at this time In the
Among the most prominent guests
were General Burnside, General Horace
Porter, and G. M. Pullman, of Chicago.
Several of the lady guests were accom
modated In the neighboring hotels and
houses. Miss Nilason, tbe actress, was
a guest.
The building was so slightly construct
ed that the water went through the floors
af a sieve.

There is great confusion at the Fifth
Avenue Hotel to-day. The proprietor
denies that there was any delay in giv

most to a crisp. These two are Mary
McCabe and Mary Logan, both ser
vants. Mary Harney, one of the ser

that when the alarm was given she

approval of the pressure now being ex

has been hitherto proved, can only re

tute a compact majority in the Assem

The House resumed the consideration
of the Soldiers' Bounty Bill up yester
day. Mr. Dunnell (Minnesota! opposed the
bill, being unable, he said, to conceive of
a bill more mischievous m its tendencies
and effects. Did Congress propose to
satisff the claim of the soldiers for an
equalization of bounties by giving boun
ty land warrants, which would not sell
iii market for twenty dollars? The bill
would benefit only those who never
smelled gunpowder in the defense of
their country.
Mr. Townsend ( Pennsylvania) opposed
the bill, and said that the soldiers of
Pennsylvania were opposed to it; aiid
that the Grand Army of the Republic, at
its session In Eastou in February, '72,
bad expressed in resolutions its disap
probation of the provisions ami princi
ples embraced in the bill.
Mr. Hawley alsoopjiosed the bill, and
showed how unfairly ami injudiciously
the bounty land system hail worked, as
applied to the soldiers of the Mexican
war. Mr. Hawley calculated that those
soldiers got thirty-six millions from the
sale of their land warrants, and that the
actual settlers had paid a hundred and
fifty millions fcr it, the difference going
into the pockets of the land speculators.
The pending measure would work in
finitely more unfairly than that one, be
cause uow any one could settle ou the
lands, under the homestead and pre
emption laws, ann under this bill two
million" persons would be entitled to
land scrip. If only oue-tenth of them
applied in the year, that would throw
ou the market thirty-two million acres,
and scrip would only hold good for a
year. The effect would lie that the sol
dier who spent at least ten dollars get
ting his warrant, could not sell in the
market for five dollars. The measure
would, therefore, prove to be practical
ly a fraud on the soldier. He held most
rigidly io the policy of preserving the
public lauds for actual settlers.
The bill was defended by Messrs.
Dounan and Speer. When Pennsylvania
lolitics were brought into the discus
sion, Mr. Speer asserting, relative to the
resolutions of the Grand Army of the
Hepuulic, presented by Mr. Townsend,
of Pennsylvania, and signed by Gov-srnor-eleet
Hartranft, that the organi
zation did not represent the honest sol
diers of the country, but the political
soldiers and officers who were controlled
by railroad companies and monopolies.
He Speer had been repeatedly called a
liar by the Republican press for stating
that Hartranft signed those resolutions
which did not represent the soldiers of
Pennsylvania. He asked his colleague
to furnish the resolutions of a soldiers'
convention, or the letter of a single sol
dier of Pennsylvania who carried a mus
ket, in opposition to this MIL They are
the political soldiers, put forward by
jKiliticians to win the campaign for
Uittiu.
Mr. Townsend replied that the con
vention was composed of delegates
chosen by the soldiers, and some of
whom were wivate soldiers who carried
a musket and knapsack during the war.
.Mr. Bpeer again asserted that the
Grand Army of the Republic wasasemi
political organization, run in the Inter
pol iticians ana railroad corporation.
Mr. Townsend reolied that it was a
semi-political organization because it
was composed of men who were sol
diers; the soldiers of the war were Re
publicans while those of the rebellion
were Democrats. Excitement ou the
Democratic side, Randall saying "That's
not so."
Mr. Speer denounced Towusend's
statement as false in fact and disgrace
ful to the representative from Pennsyl
vania. Mr. Townsend, in conclusion, asserted
that the rebellion was gotten up by the
Democratic party of the South, assisted
by the moral influence of their coadju
tors of the Democratic party of the
North, and that nine-tenths of the sol
diers of the war were Republicans.
After some further debate of a conver
sational nature, the bill went over at
tbe expiration of the morning hour till
to-morrow.
The French spoliation bill was postpon
ed, and the House wentinto aCommutee

them, took place, and was participated
in by Messrs. Sargent, Garfield, Beck,

in which he alluded to the objects of the

wisdom of action, he introduced Mayor
Brown, who delivered a brief welcoming
address. Mr. Thomas Allen then made
rather an elaborate introductory address,
after which the convention proceeded
to appointment of Committees on Cre

only fifteen States were present, but
telegrams were received stating that
several delegations had leen delayed
