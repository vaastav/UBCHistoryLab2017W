PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT was depicted in
a speech by Senator Rayner yesterday as a self
constituted dictator attempting to fill the role of a
great regulator of the universe, this caustic criticism
being voiced in Rayner s strong attack on the Presi
dent's views on the Japanese question.
Shows Roosevelt
as Yankee Czar
Senator Rayner
Flays Stand on
the Japanese
WASHIXGTO.Y, Doc. 12. — Much Inter
est wa» manifested in the Senate to
day- when Sennlor Itaynrr delivered a
*P*~"eh on the Japanese qnention. He
«-ontended th^t the inherent rfsrhi* of a j
>tate r-ould not be violated by treaty!
any more than they could be violated
by Conereas. To support thin he cited
many cases adjudicated by the ' Su
preme Court and arrayed long line* of
eminent authorities.
Rayner also gave the cases and au
thorities on the other side to the propo
sition. I He was interrupted many times
in his argument by Senators who
wished to bring out specific points.
II* 1 spoke for more than an hour.
Caustic criticisms of President Roose
velt's position on the Japanese ques
tion prefaced Rayner"s discussion of
the constitutional questions involved. If
the military and civil forces of the
Federal Government were to be used
by the President. Rayner said, it be
rame very important to know the exact
power of. the President in the matter.
Continuing, he said:
It Ik quite a »eriou» matter, in view
of the sreai calamity that has lately
befallen the city of >an Franci«co.
for the Prcxtdrnt to contemplate the
bombarding: of the city at this time and
to declare war agrainst the Board of
County School Trustees of San Fran
cisco If there la no Justification or ore
text upon which such ferocious pro
.\u25a0'recdlnErs can be undertaken,
r The President is exercising a great
[ "isny functions — legislative, executive^
and judicial, lawful and, unlawful, cen
ptitutional and unconstitutional. If he
is possessed of the idea that he is su
pervisor of all the public schools of the
various States of the Union — and he
seems to be Impressed with this idea,
because in the very last paragraph of
his message he recommends the estab
lishment of shooting galleries in. all
of the large public schools of the coun
try — we must either disabuse his mind
of this fancy or we must lft him know
that we agree as to the omnipotence
of his jurisdiction.
If he can take possession of the pub
lic schools of California and coinpcl
the State to ndmlt to them Japanese
Mtidrnt* contrary to tbc laws of Cali
fornia, he could with equal propriety
Kcsd us an amendment to the Santo
Dominj^o treaty and demand the admis
sion of the necro children of Saato
Domineo Into the white schools of
South Carolina or any other State of
the Union.
Of course if the people have come to
the conclusion that everything that
rh«? President recommends Is right,
then there is hardly any use in con-,
testing any of bis propositions, and In
stead of conferring upon him the powpr
to give Congress information of the
s-tete of the -nion we might confer
upon him the function of furnishing
his own peculiar views upon the entire
state of the universe and recommend
ing any improvements or changes in
the general plan of creation that he
may deem expedient from the cradle
to th* grave.
In fact, the President, upon page
twenty-nine of his message, antici
- at*s the cradle and makes a re.com
\ : :«-.ndation upon 1 the state of the Union
* . hat tends to place fh his hands the
-stablishment of the birth rate of the
•o en try. -Now if we can only supple
•nt this function by giving him com
• t^> jurisdiction over the death. rate
.. •' vrUl hay« a rule on which his
übiquity is uncircumscribed and whose
unlimited possibilities are beyond the
rrarh of human contemplation.
Rayner coincided with what the
President had said in his message in
praise of the Japanese. His sym
pathies had. h« said, been with them
during the war with Russia, and he
thought it a great shame that Japan
should have been overpowered in the
conference room when she had been
victorious .on the battlefield. Rayner
proposed, he said, to discuss the pres
ent question entirely outside of the
particular circumstances and plant
himself on these two propositions:
I— That there Is no provision what
ever In the treaty with Japan that con
fers the rfgrht that the President speaks
of or gives to the Government of Japan
the privilege* It claims In connection
v itli the, public school system of Cali
fornia or of any other State.
2—lf2 — If .there should be such a nrovl
slon In this treaty or any other treaty
conferring this right the treaty would
be void and without any authority upon
the part of the United States to make
it and fn violation of the constitution
and treaty making power of the Gov
ernment. /
The precise point Involved is the
tenth article of the constitution, that
powers not delegated to the United
States by the constitution nor prohib
ited by it. to the States are reserved to
the States respectively or to the.peo
ple. The power of a State to regulate
it* public school system is clearly
among its reserved powers. .

LOS ANGELES, Dec 12. — According
to a dispatch from .San' Luis • Obispo
the Bank of Ban LTuis Oblspo has filed
a complaint against Herman Silver, N.

bank commissioners, to recover dam
ages of $100,000 in connection with the
enforced closing of that institution on
January 24, 1906.: .
302 " Salesmen Sell Over $11,000,000
Worth of , Shoes
An average of over $108,000 for, each
salesman, and 17 of them only. traveled
the last three months of the year!
That 5s , the record of the salesmen
of the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company,
and if is the greatest record ever made
by. any body of shoe salesmen in the
world.
That one shoe house could ship over
$11,000,000 worth of shoes in: a- single
year is iniltself an interesting fact. It
becomes doubly interesting/ when it is
known that only one shoe house in the
world has ever been able to do it. _ y : -
That house is: the XHamllton-Brown
Shoe Company, located . at St. Louis,

over €50 feet from the ground to \u25a0 the top
