Next November.
The record of the present session will
enter largely Into the contests for con
trol of the next House. What will the
record be?
Tn considering existing divisions in the
two parties and current calculations
based upon them, we may safely discount
all talk of the tall variety from what
ever source it comes. The republicans
are not already beaten. It is not a
question merely of counting the votes.
There could be nothing more absurd
than the claim that the democrats will
elect the next Speaker by a majority
of a hundred. Those who make it are
either enthusiasts, whose views have no
value, or managing politicians making a
preliminary play for the attention of the
groundings.
Equally worthless, too, is the asser
tion that the democrats cannot win;
that they could not be lifted in with
a derrick; that the country is still in
such a state of disgust with and dis
trust of that party, success for it is
Impossible. It is held in some quarters
that the republicans could not, if they
would, throw the next House away.
There is going to be a fight. But
the warmth and nature of the struggle
we must all wait to see. It cannot be
waged upon one issue. The country is
not so much engaged upon any subject
as that all others are thrown into the
shade.
For more than a dozen years the repub
licans have won. They elected a House
in 1894 on the tariff issue, the democrats
having made ducks and drakes of their
campaign promises by enacting the Gor
man-Wilson law. They elected a Presi
dent and a House in 1896 on the silver
issue, taking as they did the gold side,
and again utilizing protection as a policy.
They elected a President and a House
in 1900 partly on the money Issue and the
tariff, and partly on that ridiculous issue
of anti-imperialism, raised by Mr. Bryan
in the face of his own record in the
Spanish war matter. And they elected a
President and a House both in 1901 and
last year on the competency they had
shown in office in dealing with public!
affairs generally.
Is the country prepared, or preparing.I
to reverse itself on any of these ques- j
tlons. Has the Payne law turned it;
against protection? Has discussion of;
currency reform taken on anywhere a
silver tinge? Is there the slightest rea
son to believe that we shall soon vote to
give up the Philippines, Hawaii and
Porto Rico? If these questions are an
swered in the negative?and why not??
the importance of the record Congress is
now to make becomes apparent In all j
forecasts about next year. There is
much unrest of a general nature. Can j
the republicans allay it? Or will the
democrats be able to keep it alive and
capitalize It at the polls?
Pure Milk for the District.
Secretary Wilson's Intention to insure j
pure milk for every man, woman and
child in the District of Columbia, as ex
pressed in an Interview printed in The
Star yesterday, is an assurance that as j
far as the laws permit the menace of
milk infection will be fought by the fed- '
eral authorities, co-operating with those
of the District. But with the best inten- ;
tions In the world this work cannot be
carripd to completion in the present state j
of the laws. There is no federal statute
providing tor the testing of cows for
tuberculosis outside of the immediate ju
risdiction of the national government,
even though their milk is shipped in in
terstate trade. The Secretary urges the
enactment of a bill now pending author
izing the federal government to test any
cow in the 1'nited states, with particular
application to Virginia. As far as the
people ot' the state itself are concerned
it is now within the province of the
United States to institute protective
measures. But here in this District are
nearly 3u0,000 people, dependent for their
milk supply almost exclusively upon the
dairy herds in Maryland and Virginia.
Between them and the transmission of
disease through the milk stands on'y an
agreement voluntarily entered into by
some of the dairymen of the adjacent
states to submit their herds to the tuber
culin test. The health officer of the Dis
trict may prohibit the importation of the
milk if he can by some means convince
himself of Its dangerous character, but
the fact of the importation does not. as it
should, give him or the Department of
Agriculture the right to go into the state
of origin and inspect the milk supply at
the source by applying the recognized
tests to the herds themselves. If the
pending measure is enacted this fault
will be corrected and the dangerous de
ficiency supplied.
The retirement of Admiral Togo from
the Japanese navy Impresses Russia
merely as a |^|M incident.
There would b# awe tangible prospects
of personal encounters if pugilists were
is temperamental a# poets.
Benjamin F. Shively.
The democrats of the Ser.ate have
solved the question of their leadership
with a look ahead. In Mr. Money
they have a competent man. familiar
with the questions now before the coun
try, and in line with his pp.rty on all
of them so far as a line may be drawn
on an organization somew.-.at disor
ganized. He was for silver when silver
was the issue, is for a tariff for revenue
only, and opposed to trusts, of course.
He knows his field of operations, and
Is a ready debater. The selection is a j
good one.
The look aiiead was taken In the selec
tion of Mr. Shiveley for vice chairman,
which insures his advancement to first
place when Mr. Money retires. As the
senator from Mississippi closes his pub
lic service March 4. 1911, this will bring
Mr Shively forward on the eve of the
next presidential election. He is a new
senator, but not a new man to political
life. Twenty-odd years ago he was a
member of the House, and after retiring
from that fi?ld continued his prominence
and activity at home. He has been a
candidate for governor, been mentioned
for \ ice President, and was an easy
victor in a strong field last winter for
senator, lie should measure up withoutj
difficulty, therefore, to this new poet
In the Senate.
If there Is opportunity in this selection
for Mr. Shlvely, encouragement is like
wise held out to all democrats north of
Mason and Dixon's line. There, for
years, the party has been weak, and
constantly growing weaker. The repub
licans have been sweeping things. Dem
ocratic senators had been disappearing
from the scene until not one from that
quarter remained when Mr. Shively pre
sented himself to take the oath.
Democratic control in national affairs
cannot be regained without the material
growth of that party In the middle states
and in the east. The south, except on
the border, is solid, and will remain so.
Mr. Taft's charming good nature, while
greatly appreciated by that section, will
have no more effect politically than did
the charming good nature and overtures
of Mr. McKlnley, or the picturesque per
sonality. half southern, of Mr. Roosevelt.
But. solid as the south Is. the south
must have assistance. Alone, she is pow
erless. Unless Indiana and New York,
as formerly, and a few other states
across the line, co-operate with her, she
will continue, as for years, to be a mere
looker-on in the national field. And says
the south now In this compliment to Mr.
Shlvely?for the south paid the compli
ment?"Tou democrats, east, and west,
and in the middle states, look alive. I
want your help, and want to help you."
As for Gov. Harmon, and Gov. Mar
shall. and Judge Gaynor, all more or
less in the national limelight, they would
do well to keep an eye on Benjamin F.
Shlvely of Indiana. If Mr. Shlvely leads
the minority in the Senate well, he may
leaJ the party?If Mr. Bryan falls?In the
next national contest.
The Jail Conditions.
In his urgent recommendation to Con
gress that a sufficient appropriation be
made to effect the thorough remodeling of
the District jail without delay. Presi
dent Taft speaks with full au
thority not only In behalf of the
District of Columbia. but for the
United States. The Jail here is designed
for the imprisonment of those who have
been found guilty of offenses against the
federal laws. It is not a local Institution.
Its inmates are the prisoners of ?...e Unit
ed States, convicted in federal courts and
pardonable only by the President.
The spectacle offered at the Jail ist in
deed, as the President says, "a reproach
to the national government." The build
ing is In truth "destitute of the ordinary
decent appliances to cleanliness and
sanitary conditions." Many years ago it
was outgrown. Even If enlarged it would
not, in Its present arrangement, be suit
able for the proper treatment of prisoners.
It is a mere packing box for condemned
humanity, inhumane in its lack of pro
visions for the moral and physical well
being of Its occupants.
Provisions have been made already for
the establishment of a reformatory and
workhouse on land near the District, an
enterprise seriously delayed and urgently
needed In the interest of the proper en
forcement of the laws and the protection
of the community. The prison commis
sion. consisting of Justice Stafford, Mr.
Edson and Mr. La Dow, upon whose
recommendation this action was taken,
headed its report with the proposal that
there should be .in the District "a Jail,
to be used only as a house of detention,
never as a place of confinement for those
under sentence." The President's recom
mendation should be read in the light of ;
this proposal, which Is based upon a
thorough examination of the prisons of
the country and a careful study of peno
logical conditions.
The prison commission suggested that
the present Jail, with certain changes
in the interior, would adequately serve
as the proposed house of detention. All
the recommendations of this commission
were based upon a strict separation of
offenders into four classes, those deserv
ing of prison punishment, to be confined
In a federal prison or penitentiary; those
whose offenses are of a minor character,
but who are In need of correction and
not worthy of reformatory treatment;
those who must be confined, but who can
be, with reasonable hope of Improvement,
giver the benefit of reformatory treat
ment, and finally those who, In the Judg
ment of the court or of the Institution j
officials, can be liberated on probation or
on parole.
The President's recommendation for jail
improvements should cause ttie comple
tion of the work started last year with
the grant of an appropriation for a re
formatory and workhouse establishment.
Two items remain?the correction of
the intolerable jail conditions and the
enactment of a probation and parole law.
j Surely, In the light of the widely known
I conditions that exist at the Jail, Congress
will not longer hesitate to put this mat
ter in the way of final enactment.

Judge Gaynor says he wants to find
honest and experienced men to serve as
officials in New York. The Diogenes of
Manhattan has a harder job than the
classic original.
The New York man whose wife com
plains in divorce proceedings that he
made her drink ginger ale instead of
champagne may have been trying to
follow J. J. Hill's advice to eoonomize.
The New York scientist who says that
wiener wurst Is dangerous to health has
no1 respect for the feelings of the real
epicures of the American metropolis.
A Boston publication suggests a club
for poets. Really, this Is carrying an old
joke a little too far.
The case of Dr. Cook Is complicated by
people strangely ambitious to figure as
! first assistant fabricators.
Bouquets have been getting steadily
scarcer for Dr. Cook since his admirers
presented him with a garland of roses.
Judge Parker Again.
Judge Parker for governor, as the can
didate of the so-called democratic league
r?f New York? The nomination would at
least be appropriate. He helped form
the league, knows and represents its pur
poses. and would poll Its full strength.
He would have to secure votes from
other sources to be elected, and in that
fact would lie his difficulty.
In 11?04 one of Judge Parker's claims to
consideration at St. Louis was the fact
that when a candidate for the bench
some years before he had carried New
i York by a large majority. Another claim
was that, before that race, he had as a
lieutenant of David B. Hill demonstrated
! rapacity for practical politics. And still
! another claim was that he had remained
| on close terms with Mr. Hill, and that
j his nomination would bring the latter
with all of his friends actively into the
campaign
Alas! Judge Parker as a vote-getter
had lost his power in New York. As a
practical politician he had lost his cun
i ning. He permitted his campaign to be
! managed, at least in name, by a ward
j politician from Indianapolis. His inti
macy with David B. Hill counted for
nothing. New York gave Theodore
Roosevelt an enormous vote. Judge Par
ker's defeat was overwhelming.
Then, as we ull know. Judge Parker
moved to Greuter New York and estab
lished himself In the practice of law.
His eminence in the profession brought
him clients of the capitalist classes. It
was supposed he had left the political
field forever.
- One question raised by t ils rumor is,
would Mr. Hearst support Judge Parker
for governor? He supported him only
languidly for President, and shed no tears
in printer'** ink when the election re
turns came In. He has not cottoned to
him since. He looked askance at the
Saratoga meeting where the democratic
league was born, as a movement of
the trusts through the agency of promi
nent lawyers in their pay. He may have
been surprised, as many others were,
at the tone of the platform adopted,
which was somewhat Bryanesque, but it
did not bring him around to an accept
ance of the league as a bona fide effort
to revive true democracy In the state of
New York.
Mr. Hearst's favor is now sought. It
is conceded in democratic circles that
he has a following which is essential
to the party's success. As he was able
to poll a hundred and fifty thousand
votes in a democratic city, end with their
aid help defeat a democratic ticket all
but the head, what might he not do in
a state race in which he was disaffected
toward the democratic ticket? Will Mr.
Hearst O. K. Judge Parker? And if
not, will the democratic league make
the nomination in defiance of him?
After all, John Early should consider
himself lucky that the medical disagree
ment in his case did not result in a need
leas removal of his vermiform appendix.
Senator Aldrich was favorably impressed
with the west. Now the question is
whether the west can see its way to re

SHOOTING STAES.
BY PHILANDER JOHNSON.
Trying to Make Life Unpleasant.
"No," said Mr. Sirius Barker. "I don't
like those neighbors of mine."
"Then why do you buy their children
drums and tin whistles and accordions
for Christmas?"
"Because I don't like them."
A Yearning for Home.
"Were you ever homesick?" asked the
statesman who has been abroad.
"Frequently," replied the blunt col
league. "I feel that way every time you
pass out one of those long speeches.''
Not a Model Family.
"Your father doesn't think you have
been especially well behaved," said the
small boy's uncle.
"I know that," answered the precocious
juvenile. "But things I have heard
mother say make me think he isn't any
great judge of high-class deportment."
A Man's Terror.
"Where are you going, my pretty inald?"
"I'm going a shopping, sir," she said?
"Won't you come with me?" He shook
his head,
And then, base coward, he turned and
fled:
The Brutal Friend.
"What do you think of my latest
novel?"
"You should have made it your earliest
instead of your latest," said the brutal
friend. "As a first effort there might
have been some excuse for it."
Winter Song.
Sing a song of winter
Air so crisp and clear!
Sunshine in the distance
And joy bells ringing near:
Snowflakes lightly failing
To warm the buds asleep.
Then a thaw and next a tramp
Through mud that's two feet deep!
Sing a song of winter
When the frost is white
And the tonsilltis germ
Seeks you day and night!
When the wind Is sighing
Sadly through the trees;
"Your furnace isn't working.
And the water pipes will freeze!"
Sing a song or winter
Sing it aiijway;
You've gut to ha\e your troubles.
There are debts that life must pay.
So set 'em to a Jingle
As you laugh at fate perverse.
Sing a song of winter
And be glad it isn't worse!
Foot Ball in Safe Hands.
From tlir York Times.
What passed between President Hadley
of Yule, President Lowell of Harvard and
Mr. Walter Camp, the "father of Ameri
can foot ball," at their conference at
Cambridge the other day will probably
never be divulged. But the meeting was
an acknowledgment by the two uni
versity presidents that they would feel a
certain responsibility for fatalities if pro
duced by muss plays in future games of
foot ball between their institutions. They
may have told Mr. Camp that the cham
pionship game at Cambridge this fall was
not cleanly played; that there wap "slug
ging" in the close formations, and un
warrantable roughness that might have
resulted in a broken neck or a fractured
skull They may have remarked that
they had been warned beforehand that,
if the game should have this fatal out
come, public opinion would not hold them
blameless. They may have reminded Mr.
Cami-. also, of his own published obser
vations to the effect that the game, at
its present stage of development, could
not afford to lose through accidents men
whose skill and long training were es
sential to the execution of "winning
plays." And they may have declared
peremptorily that it was now a question
of effecting a thorough reform In foot
ball or of abolishing it.
The White House.
From the Boston Transcript.
It is still the "White House" from
which President Taft sends his annual
message, instead of the "Executive
Mansion." by which it had been formally
designated before Roosevelt's day. But
even that stilted title lacks the support
of long usftge. Tne early Presidents de
scr bed it as the "President's House," or
the "President's Mansion.'' according to
personal tastes. In Hip earliest plotting
of Washington the Capitol and the White
House wfre designated by names which
would hardly l>e understood by the news
boys of that city today. It called one
"Congress House" and the other the
"President's House." The White House
Is the commonsense designation, because
specific and in accord with popular
usage.

One thing seems pretty sure about the

thai the peers lose whether they win or
