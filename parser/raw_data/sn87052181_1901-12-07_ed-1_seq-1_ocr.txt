0L0N AMU PANAMA QVWT.
Ill I'nrllen Seem to Accept Present
Condition an lne liable
and Permanent.
Colon, Dec. 1. Yesterday and to
day passed uneventfully at Colon and
Panama. ISoth liberals and conserva
tives are gradually resuming their
customary intercourse and fraterniz
ing the one with the other. Thc-c is
no undue boasting on the part of the
present victors nor ill-concealed ha
tred on the part of those who sympa
thize with the vanquished. Conse
quently there have been no disturb
ances or unseemly behavior.
Itecent events, however, are the
only topic of conversation. Many lib
erals allege that all blame for the
final turn of events is primarily due
to Helisario Porras, who is also said
to be responsible for the blow sus
tained by the liberal cause last year.
Porras, it is generally known, caused
a split a few months ago in the lib
eral headquarters at Charrea, over
a question of precedence, and senior
ity of rank between himself and Gen.
Domingo Diaz. Porras refused to rec
ognize the authority of Gen. Diaz as
civil and military chief of the liberal
nrmy. He subsequently effected the
withdrawal of many men with their
nrms to certain mountain fastnesses
in another direction, Where they are
still supposed to be.
The vicinity of Charrea (where the
liberals had their headquarters be
fore the attack on Colon) offers many
facilities for insurgent campaigns, as
cattle and other food requisites are
there plentiful. ,
A few dead bodies still remninalon
the railroad line. These bodies are
being burned.
The Kritish cruiser Tribune sailed
from Colon this afternoon for Ilocas
del Toro (70 miles west of Colon),
where it is surmised the liberal
forces are rising, being ignorant of
the recapture of Colon. The Colom
bian gunboat Gen. Pinzon will also
shortly sail for llocas del Toro.
Owing to the loss, last week, of
the United Fruit Co.'s steamer Sun
rise, communication between Colon
and Hocas did Toro is discontinued.
PHILIPPINES FINANCES.
The
(tnevlinn of MnlntnlnlnK the
Parity of fluid and Silver
(aitlriK t'lincern.
.Manila, Dee. 2. The financial situa
tion in the Philippine islands is caus
ing considerable alarm. Jn an inter
view published in Manila. Henry C.
Ide, chief of the department of
finance and justice, referred to the
probable enforcement of an altera
tion in the immediate future of the
present government parity of two
Mexican dollars for one gold dollar.
The United States Dost office here
now refuses, except to government
employes, to issue nnmcy orders in
exchange for Mexican silver. The
banks of Manila have been making
from six to eight per cent, on ex
change. Merchants and others are
forced to carry their accounts in
Mexican silver. The commercial
community has relied upon the Unit
ed States Philippine commission to
continue the situation of two Mexi
can dollars for one gold dollar, which
the commission itself created.
The commissi.;:: is unable to act in
tlic matter without the authority of
congress. This authorization ba:v
been requested. Charles A. Conant,
special commissioner of the war de
partment to investigate the state of
coinage and banking in the Philip
pines, and report to the secretary of
war recommendations for remedial
legislation, who is now in Washing
ton, was the bearer of the commis
sions views on this mutter. The
stores of Manila are complied to ac
cept two Mexican dollars for one gold
do:lar, while Chinese speculators are
paving as uign us six per cent, pre
lum in American paper money fur
American gold.
Local bankers say that if the sal
arie.s of all insular employes were
pant in I lie local or .Mexican currency
independently of the Duet nations of
this currency, and if the government
hac". not attempted to enforce a rate
of exchange, the present financial
situation would never have arisen.

The Tresis.
lie deals with the trust problem at con
ol.lcmlile lpnmh. rltins: both the advan
tages and disadvantages of these great
enrnnrnttons to the nation. He does not
attribute their rise to the existence of a
protective tariff, but to natural causes
that operate in other countries as well as
our own.
He claims that to them the nation owes
much nf its nresent degree of prosperity
and commercial and Industrial advance
ment: that it Is the grrat corporations
who have- driven the railroads across the
continent, and made us a world power in
the markets of the world.
He ask for legislation that will control
and regulate them, hut at the same tims
counsels congress lo act wun cauuon in
ei.acilr.ir such legislation, ar.d' afslgr.s a
number of reasons for the necessity for
caution, and of tnls problem ne says:
"The process has aroused much antago
nism, a great part of which is wholly
without warrant. It is r.ot true that as
th. rich have crown richer the Door have
grown poorer. On the contrary, never be-
lure lias ir.e averse nian, wic nasc
worker, the farmer, the small trader,
been so well off as In this country and
:it the nresent t!m. There have been
abuses corrected with the accumulation
of wealth, yet It remains true that a tor
ture accumulated In legitimate business
can he accumulated by the person spe-ci-illy
benef.ted only on condition of con
ferring immense incidental benelits upon
other?. Successful enterprise of the tpe
which her.etits all mankind can only ex
ist if the conditions are such as to offer
great prizes as tne rewarcs or rucces.
Among his reasons for caution he em
phasizes the fact that in whatever legis
lation is enacted it should not. any fur
ther than can be avoided, hamper the
strong and forceful men upon whom the
success or riusmess operations lr.eviiauiy
rtsts.
Another of his reasons for caution is
to be found In the International commercial
conditions of to-day as the same Business
conditions which have produced the great
aggregations ot corporate and individual
wealth have made them very potent fac
tors in international commercial compe
tition. As we have only just begjin to as
sume that commanding position m the in
ternational business world which we be
lieve will be more and- more ours. It is of
the utmost importance that this position
be not Jeopardized at tne piesent time.
"Pnder such corditlons It would be most
unwise to cramp or fetter the youthful
strength ot tne nation.
Hut while he recognizes these conditions
as reasons for caution In enacting trust
legislation, he believes there are evils
which need be remedied, and believes, also.
that remedies may be applied which will
not natnper our present position.
Of the evils he considers overcanital-
lzatlon the worst, and of the remedy for
tnese evils ne says:
"The first essential In determining how
to tieai wun tne great industrial com
binations is knowledge of the facts
publicity. In the Interest of the public
the government should have the right to
Inspect nnd examine the workings of
the great corporations engaged In Inter
state business. Publicity Is the only sure
remedy which we can now invoke. What
further remedies are needed in the way
of governmental regulation or taxation
can only be determined after publicity
has been obtained by process of law and
In the course of administration. The first
requisite ts knowledge, full and complete
knowledge which may be made public
to the world.
"The large corporations, commonly
called trusts, though organized in one
state, always do business in many states,
often doing very little business in the
state where they are incorporated. There
Is utter lack of uniformity In the state
laws about them, and as no state has
any exclusive interest In or power over
their nets It has in practice proved im
possible to get adequate regulation
through state action. Therefore In the
interest of the whole people the nation
should, without interfering with the pow
er of the states In the matter Itself, also
assume power of supervision and regula
tion over all corporations doing an inter
state business. This Is esaecially true
where the corporation derives a portion
of its wealth from the existence of some
monopolistic element or tendency In Its
business. There would be no hardship in
such supervision. Banks are subject to
it. and in their case It Is now accepted
as a simple matter of courre. Indeed It
Is probable that supervision of corpora
tions by the national government need
not go so far as Is now the case with the
supervision exercised over them bv sa I
conservative a state as Massachusetts In
order to produce excellent results."
The president believes that it wilt ho
possible to secure the needed remedies
for the trust evil under thj constitution
as it now exists, but If conrress thinks
otherwise he reommends tht a onstltu
t"nal amendment be subm tted tnat will
coi fer the po .vi? necessary.
In connection with the trusts he rec
ommends legislation crcatlnr a cabinet of
ficer, to b: keowa r.3 secietary of :rru
nc.ct, whoM ill ties woul l be to deal
with all quvtinns concern' g commerce,
later and th tnt 'chant matme.
Chinese Kxeloalon Necessary.
He recommends the Immediate reen
nctment of the Chinese exclusion act as a
necessary protection for American work
men, and in the same connection recom
mends such amendments to the Interstate
commerce law as will enable the various
states to protect their laborers from the )
competition of prison labor of another
state, and also that the government aid
the movement for the bettering of the
vvorklngmen's condition by not permitting
women or children to work excessive
hours or at night upon goods made for
government use.
He asks for amendments to the immi
gration laws that will prevent the land
ing of undesirable Immigrants, and such
as will enable the immigrant officials to
9rly severer tests bth mentally moral
ly and physically to those who seek
landing upon our shores.
The Tariff.
He counsels against any change In tha
present tariff laws, but urge3 -the adop
tion of the reciprocity idea as a means
of opening the doors of the world to our
commerce. In this connection he says:
"Subject to this proviso of the proin-r
protection necessary to our industrial
well being at home the principle of reci
procity must command our hearty sup
port. The phenomenal growth of our
export trade emphasizes the urgency of
the need for wider markets and for a lib
eral policy in dealing with foreign na
tions. Whatever is merely petty and vex
atious in the way of trade restrictions
should be avoided. The customers to
whom we dispose of our surplus products
In the long run directly or indirectly pur
chase those surrlus products by giving uj
something in return. Their ability to pur
chase our products should as far as pos
sible be secured by so arranging our tar
iff as to enable us to take from them
those products which we can use without
harm to our own Industries and labor or
the use of which will be of marked benefit
to us.
He urges the adoption of a policy that
will result in the upbuilding of our mer
chant marine to meet the demands of uur
expanding commerce, but refrains from
making ar.y definite recommendations as
to what this policy shall be.
He also urges the enactment of such
financial legislation as will letter safe
guard against the deranging influences of
commercial crises and financial panlcsv and
such as will make the currency of tho
country more responsive to the demands
of domestic trade and commerce. Ho
points out the fact that the receipts from
duties on exports ar.d internal taxes far
exceed the government's expenditures, hut
counsels against a reduction that will causo
a delicit, and in the same connection urges
a strict economy in expenditures so far
as our rational needs will permit.
Interstate Commerce.
He comments upon the complaints en
tered against the management ot the rail
ways for their alleged diserimlnatipn In
the matter of freight rates against the
small shippers and certain localities, and
says:
"The act should be amended. The rail
way is a public servant. Its rates should
be just to and open to all shippers alike.
The government should see to it that
within its jurisdiction this is so ami
should provide a speedy. Inexpensive and
effective remedy to that end. At the same
time It must not be forgotten that our
railways are the arteries throuqh which
the commercial llfeblood of this nation
flows. Nothing could be more foolish than
the enactment of legislation which would
unnecessarily Interfere with the develop
ment and operation of theu commercial
agencies."
Irrigation.
A considerable portion of the message Is
given to the subject of irrigation for tha
aridlandsof the west, and he urges govern
ment assistance in perfecting a system ot
irrigation that will reclaim these waste
lands ar.d make them habitable for set
tlers. He believes the government should
virtually control the water rights of the
streams affording the water for Irrigation
purposes, and should construct reservoirs
for this purpose. Of this he says:
"The government should construct and
maintain these reservoirs as it does other
public works. Where their purpose Is to
regulate tho flow of streams the water
should be turned freely Into the channels
in the dry season to take the same course
under the same laws as the natural flow.
The Colonies.
He advocates reciprocal trade relations
for Cuba that will afford that Island a
market for her products, and urges this
on the grounds of morality and national
interest.
For the Philippines he recommends
much in the way of legislation, but again
counsels caution In the enactment ot il.
He savs we cannot leave the islands al
tne present time, but that it is our duty ta
give to the Filipinos such an administra
tion as will fit them for self-government
in the future. He desires such legisla
tion as will permit of the granting ol
franchises In the islands and so develop
the natural resources of the group, at.d
says of this necessity for development:
JNot to permit this Is to co a wrong tc
the PhilInDir.es. The franchises must he
granted and the business permitted only
under regulations which will guarantee in:
islands against any kind of improper ex
Dloitation. But the vast natural wealth
of the Islands must be developed, and the
capital willing to develop It matt Le given
the opportunity. The held must be throv.u
open to individual enterpri-fe. which has
been the real factor In the development of
every region over which our flag has rtovvn.
It is urgently necessary to enact suitable
law dealing with general transportttiun.
mining, banking, currency, homesteaas anli
the use and ownership of the lands ar.d
timber. These laws wilt give free p;ay to
industrial enterprise, ar.d the commercial
development which will surely follow will
afford to the people of the islands the
best proofs of the sincerity of our desire
to aid them."
He also urges the immediate construc
tion of a Pacific cable lo connect Hawaii
and the Philippines with this country as
a commercial, political and military ne
cessity. The Isthmian uanal.
He comments upon the necessity for
the immediate construction of an Isth
mian waterway, and says the way has
been prepared for its construction by the
conclusion of a new treaty with Kngland
on th subject.
Of the new treaty recently concluded
with Kngland he says: "1 am glad to he
able to announce to you that our negotia
tions on this subject with (Ireat Britain.
conducted on notn sices in a spirit ot
friendliness and mutual good will and re
spect, have resulted In my being able to.
lay before tne senate a treaty wmcn it
ratified' will enable us to begin preparations
for an Isthmian canal at any time and
which guarantees to this nation every right
that it has ever asked in connection with
the canal. In this treaty the old Clayton-
Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as in
adequate to supply the base for the con
struction ann maintenance ot a necessarily
American ship canal, is abrogated. It spe
cially provides that the United States
alone shall do the work of building and
assume the responsibility of safeguarding
tne canai ana snail regulate its neutral use
by all nations on terms, of equality
without the guarantee or Interference
of any outside nation from any quar
ter. The signed treaty will at once
be laid before the senate, and if ap
proved the congress can then proceed to
give effect to the advantages it secures
us by providing for the building of tho
canal.
The Army ansl aavry.
For the navy he recommends a con
tinued Increase in ships as in keeping
with our nlace as a first class nower
among the nations of the world. He also
recommends an increase In th" officers
and men of the navy, that tho ships now
building may be placed In commission as
soon as completed, without retiring any
of the old ones. He urges this as a
means of performing our International
auties as well asi a saieguara for our in
ternational rights. He believes that all of
our ships should be kept In commission as
a means of trainlna officers ar.d men for
times of emergency.
or the army ne says there is- no need
of an Increase, but recommends the es
tablishment of a staff department and a
system by which there may be in elim
ination, grade by grade, of thoie who seem
unBt to render efficient service In the next
grade. He also recommends the reduction
of the "paper work" of the army, known
commonly as army "red tape." and espe
cially for the army In the field'. In the
same connection he recommends the adop
tion of new militia laws which will rec
ognize the national guard of the several
state? and place them upon an equal foot
ing with the army when called Into the
government service, by which the obliga
tions and duties of both shall be the same,
as well as the equipment and discipline.
Clrll Service.
He asks for such legislation as will place
the employes of the District of Columbia In
the classified service, and also the em
ployes in the Insular service.
Among other recomrcerdations Is one
asking for legislation that will Improve the
consular service; one that will cease to
recognize the Indian as- a member of a
tribe but as an Individual, and a distribu
tion of the tribal funds. For the Indiar.si
he also asks for the establishment nf In
dustrial schools and the stopping of the
issue of rations. He asks a liberal appro
priation for the "Louisiana Purchase expo
sition and an appropriation to cover the
expense of transferring the government
exhibits at Buffalo to the exposition nt
Charleston, which the Charleston exposi
tion has paid.
Another recommendation Is for a per
manent census bureau, which, he savs,
would Insure better, cheaper and more
satisfactory work lo that department.
