EntKKKI) AT THE POST-OFFICE
AT SCOTLAND 'KCK, X. C, AS I
si-:roxi) O.AS3 Matter.
NOT SO HERE.
Rarely if ever before in the history of
the c ount, v, has there been a time when
the proceeds of one day's labor, or the
r .reduction of one farmed acre would
purchase so large an amount of those
t h , r. rr s that enter into the living of the
inn-'-es of the people. President's Mes
sage. Tli 1'resiiltni: in his message to
Congre.-s dis-cusses the tariff law
and the effects of the McKinley bill,
liinl reaches the couchisiou which
ve tin tj I. from Lis message above.
V.ut the laboring classes can
hardly see it as President Harrison
ha.,- ut it- If they do, why is there
.so much complaint fiom so many
thousands of sources about bard
timcfc? Why do the day laborers all
over this land say in all earnest
iie.-stliat they can scarcely live and
aic really unable to pay their taxefc?
Why do they say that they are com
pelled to live harder and hauler
every year in order to be able to
make their hard-earned wages pay
for the scanty meals they give then
pooily clad families? These con
stant complaints do not indicate
that the "proceeds of one days
labor" will purchase any fair supply
of "those things that enter into the
living of the masses of the people"
Then, why do farmers of every
grade throughout the land say that
they aie compelled to curtail ex
penses and reduce home luxuries,
cvi-n wheu their lands produce most
abundantly? Why does the large
land owner say that he will be com-
pHled to lessen his force and let
part of his land grow up, or rent it
out? Why does the small farmer
who does must of his work himself
say that be will have to sell his
stock and enter into some other
business? Why does the renter
s iy that he mut not rent any rnoie,
bat give up his .-lock and tools and
work for monthly wages?
These things do not look like
".he product of one farmed' icre"
would pu: chase such an abu nt
Hnpply of "those things that enter
into the liviDg ol the masses of the
pi'opie."
Surely the President has not
heard the cry of hard times that
h is been so common amongst all
:hsos of laborers and farmers for
s ine two or thue years, or longer;
an 1 if lie Las heard it, to be sure In
h ts atuibut d it to the wrong cause.
Vvaik out among the people in a
di -guise, Mr. President, and try the
world as a common laborer or
iu I'ij-har.tied farmer a few weeks,
and we think you will modify your
srateiiient.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President's message to the
2nd Congress wis quite long said
to contain 10,000 words. We read
it is nd learned some things that we
either did net know before, or had
escaped our notice.
There was nothing remarkable in
tin- paper, as we could see, either
of particular wtakucss or special
ability.
Ali the papers do cot say as
rnuci". Republican papers feel call
ed upon, no doubt, to praise the
President's message unstintedly
simply because the President is a
lepuidiciL; and democratic papers
in ike prominent the fact of the
want of ability displayed iu the
rn.'s-age simply because the Presi
dent is a republican.
While we agree with him in many
things we disagree in manv others.
Important Meeting Dec. 29th.
I.ditoh DiiMoc hat : At a meet
irgof the Sctlar:d Neck Alliance
on Nuy. '27 h, lk'Jl, the following
resolution tvas passed :
jh;n(l, That our President ap
pfiir.t some day during the month of
December, as a special day for all
persons friendly tu the Alliance to
me f, and discuss the various tub
Etitutes for cotton.
The president appointed Dec. 29,
an i U;e meeting will be held n Pitt
man il-.dl at 10 o'clock, a. m. All
pcr.-oos friendly to the Alliance are

The Cause of Rheumatism.
An acid whu-h exi.-t in sour milk and
' "h-. :.-:. ! l;u-:i: acid, is believed by
pnvician t j be the cause of rheumatism.
-;r-"'Miiatiii; in the blood, it attacks
t!ic u'nod.-- ti-sues in the joint., and
,. '"-!-s aoTi z:i,g pains. V hat is needed
i- a u nudy tu neutralize the acid, and to
m imooiate the kidneys and liver that
all waste wiil e carried olf. Hood's
Nusapuulhi is heartily recommended by
many whom it hs cured of rheumatism,
it s,-i'ses j ist the desired qualities,

SHALL COTTON BE KING?
It will be seen from the meeting!
called by the .Scotland Neck Alliance
and announced in tbla issue, for the
23Lh of this montb, that the farmers
of this community are seriously
considering the question as to wheth
er or not cotton shall still be king.
So senoosly are they considering it
that tbty propose to meet in open
hall and discuss the question in all
its bearing opon their interesta and
the interests of all others
Toe Alliance of this place have
wisely determined to look into the
question and see what substitutes
can be found for cottcn, and they
have generously invited verybody
who is friendly to their interest to
meet with them and help them get
at the true solution of the problem.
The Democrat has lost no oppor
tunity through a number of years to
advise the farmer?, long before ttey
had any Alliance, to break away
from the chains of cotton slavery
and be independent at tome, in the
matter of meat and oread at least.
We commend, in the first place,
the action of our Alliance friends in
determining to do better for them
selves than raise cotton at a loas;
and In the second place, for their
generous invitation to all who l'eel
an interest in the question, regardless
of vocation or profession, to tweet
them and consider the interests of
all together. W bet is for the interest
of one is for the interest ot all.
Unity of thought and action can
and will accomplish much in any
thing that is worth the united effort
of all classes. Let ns hate a true
solution of tho problem,
RICE CULTURE
The Democrat suggests to the
farmers and others who will meet
here on 29th to consider substitutes
for cottoD, that they consider rice
as one of the substitutes. There
are large areas of land in this sec
tion that will produce rice, aud
doubtless farmers would find it
profitable to cultivate it. Rice
mills could be established at Scot
land Keck, which would work to a
two-fold advantage. They would
furnish the farmers who might
cultivate rice a convenience, for
putting it on the market in good
shape, and at the same time it
would be an added industry to the
town that would give employment
to more laborers here.
We see no reason why farmers
may not realize as much from rica
cultnre here as do those who raise
it in other places.
Let our farmers take this particu
lar crop iuto consideration and see
if they can not gather some
statistics by the 29th that will
help get at the profit there is in the
crop.
The Democrat has no statistics
at hand on the subject, Out we are
satisfied that it is worth the consid
eration of our farmers.
DEATH OF EDITOR MURRILL.
John F. Murrill, Esq , late editor
of the Hickory Press s Carotin iav,
is dead. He was one of the truest
and best men ou the state press.
He was an uncompromising dem
ocrat, a strong advocate of temper
ance, aud a Christian gentleman of
high-toned character. Ho despised
everything mean and ugly, and said
so. He loved everything good aud
noble in men, and said so. He was
a strong and learned lawyer and
bad been an active member in the
legislative counc.ls of the State.
It had been our pleasure to spend
only a lew days with himjas n broth
creditor, but weadmirod 1 i j lor his
pronounced views on moral ques
tious especially, and we feel the
loss of a personal friend iu his
death. There are lew editors like
him aud none nobler.
He was sixty oue years old.
AN ADDRESS.
The address to the Democratic
party, arranged for by special com
mittee some time ago has beeu sent
out, sigued by every member of the
committee txcept Mr. J. S. Beli,
one of the Alliance lecturers of the
state.
The address is long aud so was
crowded out of our columns last
week, but we print it in fall on our
first page this week. It is worth
the careful reading of every demo
crat in the state, whether tie be a
member of the Alliance or not. WTe
make no apology for giving much
of our space to it, for we think our
readers will appreciate it.

How nicely Hood's Sarsapanlli hits the
needs of people who feel "all tired out''
or "run down," from any cause. It
seems to oil up the whole mechanism of
the body so that all moves smoothly and
work becomes a positive delight. I3e
sure to get Hood's.
Hood's Pills act especially upon the
liver, rousing it from torpidity to its
duties, cure constipation and asi t digestion,

Murfreesboro Index: The stock

Tbe Sanford Express tella how a

a box car at Norfolk to steal a ride.
He nan locked op and when the car
was opened here he had been there
three days eating raw fish and rais
ins into which he had broken. He
had co water all this time.
Tbe Tarboro Southerner sayB :
Sheriff Knight says that if the pay
ing of taxes is indicative of hard
times they are hard indeed ; that, Le
has never known the people to be so
alow, thoae who are liable for only
poll tax are ysp-icully slow, and if
he were to make bi9 visitations with
a view to closing up the poll tax list
he could return half of the list insol

Thi3 is the season for printing hog
news. The Gold Leaf says: "Some
good sized hogs have been killed in
Henderson recently. Mr. Geo. II.
Rowland killed one thai weighed
290 pound ; Mr. J. R. Clark had one
that beat him one pound , and Mr.
W. II. Amerson had one to pall down
the Fcales to 340. Mr. Theo. Sel
lings killed one Monday that wts
too hfayy to weigh on any ordinary
scale?. He did not care to go to the
trouble of taking him to Vo thress'
coal yard platform scr les, and so his
bogship was carted off to the smoke
bouse Lis weightiness to go unbonor

Diversified farming will character
ize the work In Eastern Carolina
more than ever. Tae Goldshoro Ar
gus says: "The ttock trad i on thi
market is holding its owp, and from
the number of mules nd norscs that
are being sold to the farmer round
about it would 8eem that there is
life in tbeidd land jet nnd, and that
our farmer friends, arn by no means
discouraged ver tb: low price of
cotton as to tL ur jmrposes f r ar.

lly anderttood amung the farmer.,
lowever, that diversified cropj wilj
be more extensively indulged in than
ever before. Tbi is as it should be
This is as ougnt t .uave been years
ago."
The following from the Kinston
Free Press givea us ru idea of farm
ing in Lenoir county : "Mr. J. H.
Sugg told us the other day that one
of his tenants, Mr. B F. Rouse, has
made wenty-oae five-hundred pound
bales of cotton on twenty acre?,
103 bushels of sweet potatoes arc.
thirty-three barrels of Irish potatoes
this year, all of which he tendprl
miu ue luuit?. luis is a snienoiii
viefd and we tioubt if it can te beat
in the JState. The land on which this
was grown lies near Kinston."
i I
EXPELL TIIF INTRUDER, That
disease is propagated by the innumerable
microbes, germs, etc,, which till the air
we breathe and tbe water we drink, there
can be no question. These microbes
attack the human body and breed poison
in many shapes. Recent experiments
read before the congress of surgeons at
Berlin leave no doubt that the way to
elsar the system of these serms js l0
force them out through the pores of the
skin. S. S. S. does this in the most
eflicient way. It cleans them out ens
tirely and the poison as well.
Mr. F. Z. Nelson, a prominent and
wealthy citizen of Fremont, Nebraska,
suli'ertd for years with Scrofula, anJ it
continued to grow worse in spite of all
treatment. Finally four bottles of
Swifi's Specific cured him, He writes:

Speaker Crisp may have made

some
as Speaker few men ever occupied
the portion who had not done mi m
their canvass for votes, but he ha
made few. if any, promisej since hi :

lemocratic members of tbe Hi'
will be pleased. If those who erj.n j
his confidence mav be relied upon.!
he will devote himself principally toj
rltlr of makin- an eoui'abie !
distribution of tbe chairmanhip
and places upon the important com
mittees between the various sections
of the country, believing tuat no i
Representative will allow his per u ld t trv u 4 i; e yu ctl-rt h
sonal disappointment to make him j bere last Sun lay. Though a lay
angry when he sees that his section j hjs eXj,an,il3g ,)f liie Script
is fully iei)reFented. It is now
almost certain that the lists of com
mittees will not be announced until
after Christmas recess, and it is ex
pected that Speaker Crisp will, af
ter all the members have been
given a chance to be heard, retire
to his his home in Georgia, or ?o
some other place, where he can
devote his tirn?i during tbe recess to
making np the committees.
All soits of gossip ab'jut the
chairman-ships and the make-up ol
the important committees may be
heard, but about the only thing
tbat everybody seems to be agreed
upon is that the Ways and Means
committee, which deals with tariff
matters, will be dominated by
Northern and Western ruembeis,
whoever its chairman may be. The
general opinion is that Mr. Mil s
can have the chairmanship of ths
committee if he wishes if, but some
of his close friends sav that he will
not take the place, several reasons
being given why he will not; one ol
them being that if tbere is an extra
session of the Texas Legislautre in
the Spring he will be a candif:te
for the nnexpned Iciru iu tLej
Senate of ex-senator Reagan now
temporarily being filled be Senator i
Chilton aud tbat if he is eiec:tdj
he will at once resign his seat in ;
the House. But theie are those!
who think that that is just the)
reasou why he should take the!
chairmanship. They argue that j
for Mr. Crisp to tender this impor
tant place to Mr. Mills and for him
to accept it would show that uo bad
blood was left by the hot fight for
the nomination, and that, the fom -
. . , , , ,
mucee couiu oe so maie up mat
the next democrat on the commiitte ;
could fiom the first take up j
the hard work of the chairman and j
that in the event of the election, ol I
air. Mills to the Senate this giote-i
man might be made chairman. j
Resolutions providing tor an iu-j
vetigation of the Pension Office;
will shortly be oilVivd in the House:
by Kepiesentativ'es Coope of
