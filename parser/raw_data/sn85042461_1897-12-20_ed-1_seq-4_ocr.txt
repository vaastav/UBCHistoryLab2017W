THE TRUST-MADE TARIFF
The failure of the Dlngley tariff bill to
produce sufficient revenue for the legiti
mate requirements of the government is
about the only phase of the subject tha:
provokes general attention at this time.
Its author ami sponsors generally as-
Bume a confidence, whether they possess
it or not, that ln time it will accomplish
that object and produce a surplus for
the gradual extinction of the public debt.
This, however, belongs exclusively to the
realm of conjecture, and in that field one
man's guess comes pretty near being
as good as his neighbor's. But there is
another phase of the question that ap
peals more directly and vitally to the
concern of the individual citizen, and
that Is the influence of .this new tariff
law upon the prices of the necessaries o!'
life, and by that we do not mean simply
bread and meat and homespun gar
ments.
As the new law has not been in force a
sufficient length of time to meet tho ex
pectations of its friends as a revenue
producer, so has its full Influence upon
the prices of commodities to consumers
not yet been fully felt But the effects
nrc manifesting themselves in many di
rections, and there is scarcely a house
hold in the lar.il that has not already felt
them to a greater or less extent. The
advance in prices, however, has only
Just begun, because most of the mer
chants throughout the country are still
selling goods purchased before the new
law went Into effect. But wholesalers
declare that the future advance will be
something very serious.
In the matter of woolen goods alone it
is estimated thnt ihe advance In the
prices of all classes will approximate 40
to fiO per cent. Laces and embroideries
have gone up about 7 per cent, and gloves
15. Woolen socks that sold for 50 cents
now command 65 to 60. The commoner
grades of crockery and china have also
experienced an advance. Underwear has
gone up fully 20 per cent. Garments that
sold las! spring for $5 are today quoted at
IS. All flannel goods have advanced &* per
cent. The finer grades of linen have
advanced 15 per cent and the coarser
grades 25. Gloves that sold for $1.50
now command $1.75. The new tariff
does not affect the finer grades of sllk.
but all the lower grades of Japanese sIIK
have materially advanced. Foreign
gloves cost six cents more per pair, and
foreign hosiery 2 cents. Fine woolen
dress goods have advanced from $1 to
$1.35 and $1.50 Velvets have gone fron
51.50 to $1.75. Clothing has not yet felt
the full force of the new conditions, but
wholesalers estimate that ln the spring
prices will appreciate fully 25 per cent,
with a possibility of reaohing 40 per
cent by fall. Business suits now costing
$10 will then command $15; overcoats
that now cost $15 will be advanced to
$22.50. Children's suits that now cost
$2.50 and $3 will be advanced to $5. Lin
ings, trimmings and buttons have gone
up relatively with woolen fabrics. In
neckwear, prices have advanced already
from 25 to 50 per cent. Hats, under the j
revised tariff, have gone up from 15 j
to" 25 per cent; 95-cent hats cost
$1.50. Every grade of carpet manufac
tured in this country has advanced in
price—tapestry Brussels and velvet car
pets 5 cents a yard, all-wool Ingrains 5
to 7>£ cents, and the best grades of Wil
tons 10 cents. Blankets that cost 40
cents a pound before the new tariff went
into effect now cost 00 cents. Flannels
have gone up from 4 to 6 cents an ounce.
All piece goods In which wool is the chief
factor have advanced from 30 to 50 per
cent, and In some instances, where fine
| woolen yarn Is used, the advance has
reached 100 per cent. All knit goods
show an appreciation of 30 to 50 per cent.
Woolen dress goods that go to the masses
cost 11 cents a square yard more than
they did before the new tariff went into
effect. Goods of anything like fair
weight will cost IS cents a yard
more than formerly. Serge or cash
mere that sold for 25 cents a
yard now commands 31% centa. The
increase In china and crockery will range
from 15 to 25 per cent; 68 cents is asked
for a wash basin formerly costing 50;
a dozen plates formerly costing $1 will
now command $1.17, and a dozen cups
and saucers will cost 25 cents more than
before. Crude rubber has advanced 50
per cent within the last thirty days, and
rubber belting will, of course, be In
creased proportionately to meet the ad
vance. In millinery the advance in
prices is striking. Imported hats that
last year sold for $25 and $40 will this
year cost $45 and $50. Ostrich feathers
have advanced from $2.30 to $3.50 and S4. I
The Increase in velvet goods is from 25 I
to 30 per cent. Velvet that last year sold j
for $2 a yard will this year cost $2.25 to |i
$2.35. j
There has been some advar.eo in the
luxuries of life—such as velvets, laces
and imported millinery, cigars and the
like, articles which may not be abso
lutely essential to the working man or
woman—but the new schedules bear
most heavily upon the prime necessities
of the poor and of the great middle class,
which depend upon the usufruct of daily
toil to supply their requirements.
Tv'ere warel to advance in proportion
to the enhanced cost of living, the bur
dens imposed by the new tariff would lie
minimized, but, as everyone knows,
there has been no such proportionate
advance, and no advance at all except In
a few selected industries, whereas there
have been material and grievous reduc
tions in other branches of industry af
fecting hundreds of thousands of labor
ers. Nor would the situation and
prospects be nearly so discouraging and
disheartening to the poorer classes If the
enhancement in prices related only to
foreign commodities, and were confined
to such as are made the subject of tariff
restriction. But, unfortunately for all
concerned, the sympathetic influence of
the upward movement is felt inotherdi
rectlons. The retail price of meat In
this market, our readers need not be told,
ha 3 been twice advanced within the past
few months, and if the price of bread has
not gone up, the weight of the loaf has
shrunk, so that the net result is the same.
Each community has Its peculiar bur
dens to bear, and none are exempt. The
poor will eat less meat, wheaten flour
will In time become to them a luxury,
cotton will usurp the- place of wool In the
domestic economy, and shoddy will
everywhere have an Inning.
The prospect is certainly not very In
spiring for the bread-winners of the
United States. Between the Scylla of
a trust-made protective tariff and a gold
standard, and the Charybdls of Indus
trial stagnation and lower wages their
condition, as a whole, gives little prom
ise of improvement. Their only hope
lies in a correction at the ballot box of
the evils which only vicious legislation
could bring upon a country rich and re
sourceful beyond compare. May we not
hope that tbe object lesson compre
hended in every parcel purchased for the
larder or the wardrobe will bear abund
ant fruit in the congressional elections
of next year and the presidential cam
paign to follow?
IS GAGE QUALIFIED?
A person engaged in trado and com
merce is not eligible to the office of sec
retary of the treasury. Such is the law,
and congress at its next session ought
to extend that law so as to disqualify
for that oflice any person connected in
any way with national banks. The
glaring impropriety of a national bank
officer or stockholder occupying that
position is well illustrated by the pres
ent incumbent. Mr. Gage Is all wrapped
up In that interest. He has, nearly all
his life, been engaged in the banking
business and at the time of his nomi
nation to the treasury department was
president of the leading national bank
of Chicago. He has even been president
of tho American Bankers' association.
Every utterance of his shows that his
whole mind is bent on the perpetuation
and promotion of the national bank sys
tem. His energy is directed toward
augmenting that power when, in fact, it
has grown to be much too powerful a
factor in the government already. Mr.
Gage's own nomination to the secre
taryship of the treasury is most con
vincing proof of this fact.
If there is reason why one engaged in
commerce should not hold the place of
secretary of the treasury the reasons
are a thousand times stronger why a
national bank man should be disquali
fied for it, and congress should lake
cognizance of this fact without delay.
Mr. A. T. Stewart, the great New York
LOS ANGELES HERALDt MONDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 20, 1897
merchant, was nominated by President
Grant for that position, but his name
was speedily withdrawn because he was
lan importer of merchandise, and ques
tions relating to such Importations were
I liable to come before him for settlement.
I But questions relating to national bank 3
| come before the secretary every day,
and Mr. Gage, a national bank man all
over, has to decide them.
Thore is now sitting ln Washington
!a currency commission, so-called (the
j pet and nestling of Mr. Gage) to devise
| and recommend a revision of the cur
iiency, the sole aim of which is, when
stripped of all disguises, to enlarge the
powers and promote the Interests of the
national banks. This commission sits
at the elbow of Mr. Gage and will carry
out his views to the letter. It is highly
presumable, ln fact, that Its members
were appointed at his dictation. The
aim of the movement is to get rid en
tirely of the greenbacks and to replace
them with national bank circulation.
Greenbacks, like silver, have too much
the character of the people's money to
■be popular with such men as Lyman
I Gage; hence they must be got out of the
j way. Gold and bank notes will bo easier
;to manipulate in Wall street, with both
silver and greenbacks retired from clr-
i culatlon.
j This is another currency contracting
I scheme and is intended to give the
I money power a firmer hold upon the
I throat of industry. Mr. Gage was pro
| moted to the post of chief financier of
j this great nation because of his peculiar,
j partial and purblind notions about
I money. The Impropriety of making
i such a man secretary of the United
; States treasury cannot be expressed In
j words. But Mr. McKinley could not
' help himself. The same power that made
| him made' Gage. The great question
; before the people now Is: How long can
|we stand this sort of thing?
M'KINLEY ON FINANCES
President McKinley's plnn for the re
tirement of the greenbacks is not quite
clear to anybody, including the presi
dent himself. In bis message to con
gress he says that they should be re
deemed, set apart and only paid out for
gold. Now, since the gold is in the
pockets of speculators In government
bonds and In the vaults of the bankers
who replenish the public treasury with
gold "for revenue only," It will be in
order for the president, or anybody else,
to explain by what process he expects
to touch the hearts of these men and of
these soulless Institutions, without at
the same time tickling their pockets.
From a gold-bug standpoint the ordi
nary citizen would have a right to be
lieve that the present financial system
iis an ideal one. The parties and plat
forms which, in the last campaign, con
demned It and pointed out its iniquities,
were ridiculed and called bad names.
And now comes the president of the
United States, the chief defender and
upholder, during said campaign, of this
same system, and says:
The failure of the present (financial)
system is found In the great cost to the
government of maintaining the parity
of our differoi.it forms of money—that
Is. keepir.6 all of them at par with
gold. We surely cartnot be longer
heedless cS the burden this Imposes
upon the people, even under fairly pros
perous conditions, while the past four
years have demonstrated that it is not
on.'v an expensive charge upon the
government, but a dangerous menace
to the national credit.
President McKinley has evidently
been studying some of Mr. Bryan's
speeches.
In the same message the president
says that the government is obliged
to redeem demand obligations (by
which It may be surmised ho means
greenbacks and treasury notes) ln gold.
The fallacy of this statement has so
often been pointed out that there is no
excuse for its repetition by the president
of the United Status. There is not a de
mand obligation, or any other obliga
tion of the United States (except a few
gold certificates), that is payable in
gold. This political Joke, like Its brother,
"the foreigner pays the tax," needs a
much deserved rest; it Is stale. The
president has, however, built his whole
currency reform system upon It. The
funny papers are missing a rare oppor
tunity.
If the demand obligations are not
payable in gold, then according to
President McKinley's ideas, whatever
they may be, the reform of the present
financial system is not necessary. But
every school boy knows that the de
mand obligations are payable in "coin,"
and that "coin" is either gold or silver.
If President McKinley had instructed
his gold-bug secretary of the treasury
to redeem the demand obligations In
silver, or had recommended to congress
the enactment of a law which would
compel the secretary of the treasury to
redeem these obligations ln silver,
whenever the gold reserve should fall
below the amount established by law,
the whole question would have been
solved, so far as the evils complained
of in the president's message are con
cerned, and he would need have no
anxiety about a future issue and sale of
bonds, except for the purpose of meet
ing the deficit caused by tho Dlngley
bill.
COST OF THE GOLD STANDARD
Now that the administration has com
mitted Itself to the gold standard, It will
be in order to ascertain how much that
gold standard will cost tho people If
such a law Is enacted. History affords
the data. The Cleveland administration
was conducted on a gold standard, and
during that period $2112,015,400 of bonds
were issued and sold for the sole purpose
of maintaining the gold standard.
Under the plan of Secretary Gage he
asks permission to Issue $200,000,000 morn
of gold bonds for the same purpose. But
this is not all. Secretary Gage also asks
permission to refund the old bonds and
to re-issue them, to extend the time of
payment ten years, and to make them
payable ln gold coin. Neither Secretary
Gage, nor any other member of the pres
ent administration, has told the people
what his gold standard plan will cost;
they will have to figure It out for them
selves. This Is a simple process. If it
will require, under the proposed plan,
an Issue of $50,000,000 of gold bonds each
year, and If it did-require an Issue of
$65,000,000 of bonds each year under the
Cleveland administration, how long will
It be before the bond holders will own
the whole United States?
SALOON LAW VIOLATIONS
The Los Angeles Cnpltal sizes up the
saloon situation in this city as follows:
There are certain saloons In Los An
geles where whisky Is sold all day on
ali Sundays. There are others which
are closely watched and are kept her
metically scaled on Sunday*. These
facts are certainly known to the police
commissioners, and the average citi
zen wonders why It Is that one saloon
man should be favored ovor another.
This la no insinuation, but a plain
statement, and the names of the saloon
men who arc violating thu Sunday law
can be furnished.
The Herald has been arslduoualy
pointing out this disgraceful condition of
affairs for several weeks past. For
some ocoult reason the police depart
ment seems disposed to Ignore or evade
the subject. There ought to be no tri
fling with the law, no playing of favorlter.
ln the saloon buslners.
If the Sunday saloon and tho all-night
saloon are permitted to those with a
"pull," let us have the locks undone and
give the remainder of the saloon keepers
the same privileges. Let us no longer
degrade the law by allowing it to be
come a farce and a dead letter on the
one hand, and an instrument of discrim
ination on the other.
The saloon laws should be enforced.
If they ennot be enforced, if the people
do not want them enforced, they should
be repealed.
Senator Chandler evidently is not in
accord with the powers that be on the
money question. The other day he
stoutly denied that the administration
was committed to the gold standard, at
the same time that the secretary of the
treasury was advocating before the
banking and currency committee of the
house his bill for refunding all the gov
ernment bonds, which provides for
leaving out "payable in coin," and sub
stituting therefor "payable in gold coin
of the United States or gold bullion."
Chandler is astute, and his denial was a
joke, intended to convey tha impression
that he was not in the confidence of the
president, and that he Is opposed to
the gold standard. It was not Intended to
be in conflict with what he said to the
Washington Post.
The United States would seem to have
a stronger case against Hayti than had
Germany, and, whereas every citizen ol
this country will expect the government
to be firm ln its demands for reparation
uf the Campbell outrage, a gun play will
be honored as a last rather than a first
resort. Albeit Hayti shows the proper
disposition ln offering to submit the
matter to arbitration.
The banking and currency committee,
in a laudable endeavor to get Its reform
bill at the foot of the calendar, will de
lay its report until after the holiday
recess.
The crime of '73 wasn't a circumstance

THE BOLD YOUNG HIGHWAYMAN
Did you ever meet a robber with a pistol
and a knife,
Whoso prompt and cordial greeting was,
"Your money or your life;"
Who, while you stood a-trembling, with
your hands above your head,
Took your gold, most grimly offering to re
pay you In cold lead?
i
Well. I once met a robber; I was going
homo to tea;
The way was rather lonely, though not
too dark to see
That the sturdy rogue who stopped me
there was very fully armed-
Hut I'm honest In maintaining that I didn't
feel alarmed.
IHe was panting hard from running, so I,
being still undaunted,
Very boldly faced the rascal and demanded
what he wanted;
I was quite «s big aa he was, and I was
not out of breath;
So I didn't fear his shooting mo or stab
bing me to death.
In answer to my questions the highway
man raised an arm
And pointed It straight at me, though I
still felt no alarm;
He, did not ask for money, but what he
said was this;
"You cannot pass, papa, unless you give
your boy a klas!"

The Administration's Financial Flan
To the Editor of the Los Angeles
Herald: The financial plan of the admin
istration has been laid before the coun
try. Sir, Onge, secretary of the treasury,
asks congress to pass a law to take the
government out of the banking business
and to confer additional powers upon na
tional banks. The president, in his mes
sage, favors all the essential features
of Mr. Gage's plan, but touches the sub
ject gingerly. He ventures, however, to
suggest that the bunks be allowed to
issue their own notes, as money, up to
the full face of the bunds they have de
posited, and that they be exempted
from half of the tax now paid by them on
their circulation; also that more banks
be established. All this, and more, is to
be done to maintain the single gold
standard and to carry out tho absurd
and exploded theory that "gold only is
honest money." These recommendations
are ostensibly made in the interest of tho
whole people, but are really intended for
the benefit of the banks, and have been
demanded by a late bankers' conven
tion. Gage is a national banker, and
his whole scheme would, if adopted,
make the burdens lighter for the banks
and their profits much larger, while It
would put heavier burdens on the peo
ple. Ought any more favors to be show
ered on the banks? Let us take a hasty
look at the banking system. They In
vest $100,000 ln government bonds, bear-
Ing Interest payable semi-annually; the
government then issues to them $90,000
in bank notes, which they loan to tho
people. In this way they get two Inter
ests on one Investment; they harvest
two crops where they plant but one. But
that Is not all. They receive individual
deposits of vast sums of money which
they loan out, for which they give the
depositor no security. When panics
come, as they do come, often under out
very defective banking system, tho de
positors loss millions, thousands of men
are bankrupted, business is prostrated
and widespread ruin ensues. Why do
Mr. Gage and the president not suggest
something ln the interest of the people,
Instead of "talking turkey" all of the
time to the banks, and • buzzard" all of
the time to the people? Why do they not
recommend that the banks be taxed a
nominal sum, say 1 per cent on their cir
culation, the money thus raised to go
into a sinking fund (kept In the United
States treasury), out of which depositors
in suspended banks should be paid In full
for losses sustained by banks closing
their doors? If such a law were enacted
millions of money now hid away because
banks afford no security whatever to
depositors would come out of their hid
ing places and be deposited in banks, or
go into circulation, and all "runs" on
national banks would be at an end, for
every depositor would know that his
money was in a safe place, for "Uncle
Sam" would guarantee its safety. But
who expects such efficient and badly
needed legislation in the interests of
the masses so long as tbe banks are in
the government business?
A government postal savings bank
would be of Incalculable benefit to the
masses, but who has a spark of hope that
the banks will allow such a movement
In the Interest of the people to succeed?
Thomas efferson said:
Bank paper must be suppressed and the
Issue of the circulating medium restored
to the nation to whom it belongs. Banking
establishments are more dangerous than
standing armies.
The president, Lyman Gage, Mark
Hanna. and the single gold standard
people, disagree with Jefferson and all
the leading statesmen since his time.
They say the banks must issue all the
paper money and the government must
go out of the banking business. Never
has the Issue between banks and the
people been so clearly defined as now.
The issue? of the next campaign are be
ing made up; they are, indeed, already
weil known. The Republican party will
stand for the theory that banks shall be
giver, the power to control the monetary
system of this great, nation, and issue
all the paper money, based on a perma
nent bonded debt of tha government,
and that "cola" shall be held to mean
gold only.
The true Democratic party, with the
Populists, the Silver Republicans and
reformers generally, will contend for the
right and duty of tha government to is
sue the paper money, and they will in
sist that •'coin" means both gold and
silver. They will contend for bimetal
lism and claim that so long as metal is
used as money it shall consist of both
gold and silver at an agreed ratio, with
free coinage of both, as provided by the
constitution, and that both shall be legal
tender for all debts They will contend
that wiiile they are not enemies of bank
ers personally, yet they will resist all
attempts to enlarge the privileges of
banks and oppose the proposed reduc
tion of tuxes now levied on banks. With
bimetallism as the basis of the financial
system of the country, a stable cur
rency can be maintained, for when gold
Is scarce the debtor can pay in silver and
when silver is scarce he can pay in gold.
With this as the custom and the law,
neither creditor nor debtor would be
wronged, for the system would be just
to both, and the power of the unscrupu
lous money monopolist to oppress the
debtor would be greatly curtailed, if noi
prevented altogether.
From Washington to John Sherman,
both gold and silver were "honest mon
ey," and were called "coin." I ask when
and why did "coin" become "honest
gold" and "dishonest silver?" Observ
ing people are beginning to llnd out when
and why. Whoever heard that "gold only
Is honest money" till after the money
loaning classes had possessed them
selves of hundreds of millions of dollars
of bonds and mortgages? These debts
were contracted when sliver was "hon
est money" too. It was clever financier
ing to make all these debts payable in
gold only, but Who will say the trick was
an honest one? If Farmer A should
go In debt to Mr. I! for $1000, to be paid
ln "grain" (or In wheat or corn), It
would be "smart" for 13 to secure tho
passage of a law defining "grain" to
mean wheat only, thus enhancing tho
price of wheat and compelling A to pay
the debt in wheat; but would that us
honest on B's part?
The Republican gold standard states
men who are proposing to get the gov
ernment out of the banking business,
and tho banks Into the government bus
iness, for the purpose of fastening per
manently the single gold standard on
the country, are making a halter that
will hang their party in IDOO "higher than
Hainan." There Is prosperity and safe

The Bar Association of Los Angelos
To the Editor of the Los Angeles
Herald: Is the Los Angeles Bar asso
ciation dead or alive? That Is the ques
tion. If It Is alive, it certainly has no
excuse for living any longer; and If it
is dead, recent events demand that an
other one shall be born right away.
It has always been supposed that an
active and vigorous bar association is
necessary for the protection of tho mem
bers of the bar and of the Judges of the
courts. The history of the bar of Los
Angeles for the last eight years has
vindicated this supposition. During that
time we have seen practicing at the bar
of our courts criminals and Importers,
not to mention the mushroom pettifog
gers who peddle their wares as kindred
quacks peddle pills and plasters, and
the mountebanks who advertise to fur
nish their nostrums free.
The profession of the law Is as old as
civilization and Is ono of the most hon
orable. Like every other profession,
there creep Into It undesirable classes,
who, under the guise of Its good name
and under color of the privileges
to it by law, insinuate themselves Into
the confidence of the public and practice
their cunning at the expense of the re
putation of every lawyer at the bar and
of the courts.
It is said that a drop of aniline placed
in a pall of water will perceptibly color
the water In the pail. So It is with the
few scoundrels at the bar, who are per
mitted to aHsume and suffered to retain
the title of lawyers. They color the
character of every member of the bar.
It is not an inviting task to give names
and facts, but the most unobserving cit
izen can readily point out the office or
offices where criminals can buy ready
made acquittals.
Every lawyer ln the county of Los
Angeles is responsible, and directly re
sponsible, for this Inexcusable condition
of affairs, and the members and officers
of our Rip Van Winkle bar association
should be cited before our courts to an
swer upon a charge of contempt.
A bar association, with active, ener
getic officers and with proper commit
tees, who would discharge their duties,
would soon rid the profession of these
undesirable classes.
The remedy is not wanting, and if the
older members of the bar, who are usu
ally elected to the offices of the bar
association, and thereafter do nothing,
do not wake up or resign, the younger
members should take hold of this matter
and, for the purpose of protecting their
integrity, organize a new bar associa
tion. J.

Mental Pabulum for Women
To the Editor of the Los Angeles
Herald: I wish to thank you for the ar
ticle that appeared in your paper a day
or two since, under tha caption of "In
Woman's Sphere." For yearn, like every
other sensible woman, I have been dis
gusted with the kind of mental pabulum
that Is constantly being served up to
the intelligent women of the country by
a class of writers who seem to have never
experienced an earnest thought in their
lives on any of the vital subjects that
are enlisting the attention of the earnest
women of the day.
As Mrs. Chapin truly says, the bulk of
the intellectual development of the day
is largMy among the women of leisure,
and It needs only some one to
awaken those who are ' not In
terested In such matters to a realiza
tion of the fact that there is a world out
side of the fashionable foibles and con
ventionalities of society. Mrs. Chapln's
earnest, concise way of putting things
is very refreshing, and I trust we shall
have foine more of the same kind.
MRS. B. A. BARR.

Logic and Sophistry
To the Editor of the Los Angeles
Herald: Owing to a difference of opin
ion on a point ln the science of logic,
will you kindly answer through the col
urons of your valuable paper the fol
lowing questions?
First—Can logic, based on a false
premise, be considered correct logic,
merely becuuse the deductions are on
the line of exact reasoning?
Second—lf the basis be wrong, are
not the inferences also wrong, and
therefore the whole logic Incorrect and
untrustworthy?
CHARLES JOHNSON.
Los Angeles, December 19.
(First—Certainly not. Second—As-
suredly yes. The argument with false
premises ceases to be logic and becomes
sophistry.—Ed.)
American Crews on the Torpedo Boats
One notable and commendable feature
about the torpedo fleet now ln this har
bor la the fact that the crews are made
up of Americans. There is scarcely a
foreign countenance to be seen, and
good, expressive "United States" Is the
language of the fleet. The men are big,
strong, healthy young fellows, with
ruddy cheeks and clear eyes. They are
the kind of men that a good Judge would
pick to do dangerous work in defense of
their country, and there is doubt that
these men—the "men behind the guns,"
upon whom depends the honor and ef
fectiveness of the craft—would be found
equal to the occasion should an emer
gency arise. It Is to be hoped that it
will not be long before Assistant Sec
retary Roosevelt will have the crews of
the greater ships of the navy "Ameri
canized" up to the standard of the tor
pedo lleet. —Savannah, Ga., News.
Reflections of a Bachelor
The average parents are a great im
provement on their children.
No girl over 27 can possibly be as old
and as innocent as she thinks she looks.
Probably whenever Robinson Crusoe
looked at his parrot he thought of his
wife.
As soon as a moth tastes a sex-prob

at camphor balls.
Every man when he prays for a thing
has a sneaking inclination to tell the
Lord that he would do as much for him.
Most women that have husbands go
through life with the Idea that a bach
elor needs reforming Just because he Is.
