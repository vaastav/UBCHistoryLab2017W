' KITCHEN ECONOMY" EXPLAINED.
In answer to the article ' denominated
" Kitchen Economy," which has recently ap
peared in the New York Tribune, and vari
ous other papers, and to Batisfy the public
that our Baking Powder is what we represent
it to be, we directed Prof. Henry Morton,
President of Stevens Institute, Hoboken, N.
J., to purchase in the . open market and anal
yze samples of ' Koyai" and " Becker's Per
fect Baking Powder," and his report is as fol
lows: "I find the ' -
HECKER'S
Perfect Baking Powder
to consist essentially of Cream of Tartar and
Bi-oarbonate of Soda, or, in other words,
Is a 'Pure Cream Tartar
Baking: Powder,
free from alum, terra alba, or any other in"
jurions substances. I find the " Royal"-Ba
king Powder to consist of Cream Tartar and
Bi-carbonate of Soda, with the addition of
sesqui -carbonate of ammonia. As regards
the carbonic acid .gas, which I believe to be
the only efficient constituent in the use of
these powders, I find it to be developed in
practically identical amounts in each. The
ammoniacal gas (better known to the public
as it is found in - hartshorn or in smelling
salts) obtained by the introduction of sesqui
carbonate of
AMMOKIA
" ROYAL" BAKING POWDER,
I do not find in practice to produce any good
effect in raising the bread, and I should not
therefore, consider its presence as desirable.
If, then, we accept Dr. Love's standard of
commercial value, these two powders are both
worth 50 cents, with the additional advantage
of purity, or freedom from ammonia, on the
part of ' Hooker's Perfect Baking Powder."
We feel called upon, in justice to ourselve
nd the public to give the above facts, as the
article denominated "Kitchen Economy" was
published apparently as disinterested infor
mation, intended for the public good, where
as in fact it was an advertisement of the Boy
al Baking Powder Company. -

THE BLKCTION 1K8TBRUAY.
It is not necessary to say much, about the
result of yesterday's election. In accordance
with everybody's expectation the Democrats
made a clean sweep on the town ticket, and
"license" was carried by 1868 majority.
In the election of Aldermen and Council
men there were some surprises, and the
Republicans were the ones surprised. They lost
an Alderman in the First ward and also "in
the Ninth, and there was a tie in the
Eleventh. They lost two Councilman
the Second ward, one in the Ninth and one
in the Eleventh. The. Council last year
stood 17 Republicans to 19 Democrats. This
year it will stand 13 Republicans to 23 Demo
crats. The Board of Aldermen last year
stood 10 Republicans to 14 Democrats. This
year it will sjband, if the Republicans finally
succeed -in carrying' the Eleventh ward, 8
Republicans p 16 Democrats.

; The worst thing about tbe President's mes
sage is its length ; bnt those who are in the
habit of reading Presidents' messages will
not be deterred by the length of this one
from wading through it, and those who are
not will get all the information they want
about it from a brief summary of it.
After referring in appropriate words to the
death of his predecessor in office the Presi
dent takes up the subject of foreign affairs,
and gives a very complete account of oar re
lations with other countries. This part of
the Message contains nothing especially fresh
or interesting.
The next subjeot considered is the finances,
and here the President makes some impor
tant recommendations. He advises that pro
vision be made for the early retirement of
the silver certificates And that the act re
quiring their issue be repealed, as they form
an unnecessary addition to the paper curren
cy. Among his other recommendations ore :
That the very objectionable provision for
the coinage of a fixed amount of silver dol
lars each month be repealed, and that here
after only so many be coined ad shall be nec-
ry to supply the demand ; that the Na
tional banks be forbidden by law to retire
their currency except upon reasonable notice
to do so ; that all internal revenue taxes ex
cept those upon tobacco in its various forms
and upon distilled spirits and fermented li
quors, and except also the special fax upon
the manufacturers of and dealers in such ar
ticles be abolished ; that the law imposing a
stamp tax upon matches, proprietary arti
cles, playing cards, checks and drafts be re
pealed, and the law also by which banks and
bankers are assessed upon their capital and
deposits. All these recommendations will be
approved by a large majority of the people.
In what he says concerning the navy the
President is emphatic. He believes that ev
ery consideration of national safety, econo
my and honor demand a thorough rehabilita
tion of our navy, and he- calls the especial
attention of Congress to the report recently
made by the advisory board concerning the
number and character of vessels necessary to
place the navy on a footing commensurate
with the necessities of the government.
.The Star Route eases are notioed and the
President says he has enjoined upon the offi
cials who are charged with the cenduot of the
eases on the part of the gootjmient and up.
on the eminent counsel, who, before his ac
cession to the Presidency, were called to
their assistance, the duty of prosecuting
with the utmost vigor of the law all persons
who may be found chargeable with frauds
upon the postal service.
During the past year in the Territory of
Arizona a band of desperadoes known as
"cow-boys" have been engaged in committing
acts of lawlessness and brutality which the
local authorities have been unable to re
press. Their depredations have even extend
ed into Mexico. There is lack of authority
which would enable United States forces to
help the Arizona authorities against these
rascals, and the President suggests that Ter
ritories should be offered the same protec
tion which is accorded to States by the Con
stitution. It seems to him too, that what
ever views may prevail as to the policy of
recent legislation by which the army has
ceased to be a part of tbe potse comitatus, an
exception might well be made for permitting
the military to assist the civil Territorial au
thorities in enforcing the laws of the United
States. This use of the army would not
seem to be within the alleged evil against
which that legislation was aimed.
The "Indian problem," which has figured
in so'many Presidents' messages, is treated in
this one with vigor and directness. The re
commendations made will please all who de
sire to see the condition and standing of the
Indians improved. It is recommended that
the Indian be given the protection of the law
and allowed to maintain in court his rights of
person and property ; that a law be enacted
which shall permit the allotment in severalty,
to such Indians, at least, as desire it, of a
reasonable quantity of land secured to them
by patent, and for their protection made ina
lienable for twenty or twenty-five years ; and
that liberal appropriations be made for Indi
an schools. If these three things could be
done a long step toward the solution of a
very troublesome problem would be taken.
President Arthur will not be much more
popular in Salt Lake City than some other
Presidents have been. He thinks it time for
Congress and the. Executive to use against
the barbarous system of polygamy all the
power which, under .the Constitution and
laws, they can wield for its destruction. He
recommends modifying the law of evidence
so that a wife will be competent to testify
against her husband ; the passage of an act
providing that in the Territories of the Uni
ted States the fact that a woman has been
married to a person charged with bigamy
shall not disqualify her as a witness upon his
trial for that offence, and legislation by whioh
any person solemnizing a ' marriage in any of
the territories shall be required, under strin
gent penalties for neglect or refusal, to file a
certificate of snch marriage in the Supreme
Court of the territory. These recommenda
tions should be acted upon without unneces
sary delay, - .
What the President nas to say about civil
service reform is well considered and care
fully expressed. Be evidently does not be
lieve that the civil service reformers are on
the only road there isjto bettering the civi
service, nor does he think that service is in
the bad condition that some think. This
part of the Message is very interesting and it
is also very cautious. . .
After the consideration of several other
matters the subject of Presidential disability,
so, sharply and sadly brought to public at
tention by the long illness of President Gar
field, is touched upos,. and some questions
concerning what constitutes it and how it is
to be determined are suggested. The Mes
sage ends with some well chosen words ex
pressing the President's sense of the respon
sibility resting upon him and his desire and
purpose to do his duty well.

The President's Message.
To the Senate and House of Repretentativet
!. or vie urn tea state :
An appalling calamity has befallen the
American people since the chosen represent
atives last met in the nails where yon are now
assembled. We might else recall, with un
alloyed content,' the prosperity with which
throughout the year the nation has been
blessed. Its harvests have been plenteous ;
its varied interests have thriven ; the hearth
of its people has been preserved; it has
maintained with, foreign governments the
undisturbed relations of amity and peace.
For these manifestations of his favor we owe
to Him who holds our destiny in his hands
the tribute of our sratitude and devotion.
To that mysterious exercise of his will which
has taken from us the loved and illustrious
citizen who was but lately the head of the
nation, weJbow in sorrow and submission.
The memory of his exalted character, of his
noble achievements, and of his patriotic life
will be treasured forever as a sacred posses
sion of the whole people. The announce
ment of his death drew from foreign govern
ments and peoples tributes of sympathy and
sorrow which posterity will record as signal
tokens of the kinship of nations, and the
federation of mankind. The feeling of good
win between our own government and that of
Great Britain was' never more marked than
at present. In recognition of this pleasing
fact I directed, on the occasion of the late
centennial celebration at Yorktown, that a
salute be given to the .British flag.
' rOKEION AFFAIBS.
Save .the correspondence to which I shall
refer hereafter in relation to the proposed
oanal across the Isthmus of Panama, little
has occurred worthy of mention in diplo
matic relations; larly in the year the .For
tune 'Bay claims were satisfactorily settled
by the British government paying in full the
sum of ,15,000, most of which has been
already distributed. As the terms of the
settlement included compensation for injuries
Buffered by our fishermen at Assize Bay
there has been retained from the gross
award a sum which seemed adequate for
these claims. The participation of Ameri
cans m the exhibitions at Melbourne and
Sydney will be approvingly mentioned in the
report of the two exhibitions, soon to be
presented to Congress. They will disclose
the readiness of our countrymen to make
successful competition, in distant fields of
enterprise. Negotiations for an internation
al copyright convention are in hopeful
progress.
lhe surrender of bitting Bull and his
forces upon the Canadian frontier has al
layed apprehension, although bodies of Brit
ish Indians still cross . the border in quest of
sustenance. Upon this subject a correspond
ence has been opened which promises an
adequate understanding. Our troops have
orders to avoid all collisions with alien Indi
ans.
The presence at the Yorktown celebration
of representatives of Lafayette and of his
gallant compatriots, who were our allies in
the revolution, has served to strengthen the
spirit of good will which has always existed
between the two nations.
You will be furnished with the proceed
ings of the bi-metallio conference held dur-:
ing the summer at the city of Paris. No
accord was reached, but a valuable, inter
change of views was held. The conference
will next year be renewed.
At the electrical exhibition and consress.
held at Paris, the country was creditably
represented by eminent specialists, who in
the absence of an appropriation generously
lent their aid, at the instance of the State
department. While our exhibitors in this
almost distinctively American field of achieve
ment have won several valuable awards, I
recommend that Congress provide for the re
payment of the personal expenses incurred on
the public interest by the honorary commis
sioners and delegates.
Ho new questions respecting the status of
our naturalized citizens in Germany have
arisen during tfte year, and the causes of
complaint, especially in Alsace and Lorraine,
have practically ceased, through the liberal
action of the Imperial government in accept
ing our otten pressed views on the subject.
The application of the treaty of . 1868 to the
lately acquired Rhenish provinces has receiv
ed very earnest attention. A definite and
lasting agreement on this point is confidently
expected, rue participation of the descend
ants of Boron Yon Steuben at the Yorktown
festivities, and their subsequent reception
by their American kinsmen, strikingly
evinced the ties and good will which unite
tne lierman people.
Our intercourse with Spain has been friend
ly. Ah agreement, concluded in February
last, nxes a term lor tne labors of the Span
ish and American claims commission. The
Spanish government has been requested to
pay the late awards of that commission and
will, it is believed, accede to the request as
promptly and courteously as on former
occasions. By recent legislation onerous
fines have been imposed upon American ship
ping in Spanish and colonial ports for slight
irregularities in manifests. No case of hard
ship is specially worthy of attention. The
bark "Masonic," bound for Japan, entered
Manilla in distress and there sought to be
confiscated under Spanish revenue laws for
an alleged shortage in her transhipped cargo.
Although efforts for ner relief have thus far
proved unavailing, it is expected that the
whole will be adjusted in a friendly spirit. -The
Senate resolutions -of condolence on
the assassinnation of the Czar, Alexander IL,
were appropriately eommuicated to the
Russian government, which in turn has ex
pressed its sympathy in our late national be
reavement. It is desirable that oar cordial
relations with Russia should be strengthened
by proper engagements assuring to peaceable
Americans who visit the Empire the consider
ation of which is due to them as citizens of a
friendly State. This is especially needful
with respect to American Israelites, whose
classification with the native Hebrews has
evoked energetic remonstrances from this
government.
A supplementary consular agreement with
Italy has been sanctioned and proclaimed,
which put at rest the conflict of jurisdiction
in the case of crimes on shipboard. Several
important international conferences have
been held in Italy during the year. At the
geographical Congress of Venice, the benficent
Congress of Milan and the Hygienic Congress
of Turin, this country was represented by
delegates from branches of the public ser
vice or by private citizens duly accredited in
honorary capacity. It is hoped that Con
gress will give such prominence to the result
of the participation as they may seem to de
serve. : ,
The abolition of all discriminating duties
against sucn colonial productions of the
East Indies as are imported hither from Hol
land has been already considered by Con
gress. I trust that at the present session the
matter may be favorably concluded.
The insecurity of life and propertv in
many parts of Turkey has given rise to cor
respondence with the Porte looking particu
larly to the better protection of American
missionaries in the empire. The condemned
murderer of the eminent missionary. Dr. Jus
tin A. Parsons, has not yet been executed, al
though this government has repeatedly de
manded that exemplary justice be done.
Tne bwiss government nas solicited the
good offices of onr diplomatic and consular
agents for the protection of its citizens in
countries where it is not itself represented.
This request has, within proper limits, been
granted. Onr agents in Switzerland have
been instructed to protest against the conduct
of the authorities of certain communes in
permitting the emigration to this country of
criminals and other objectionable persons.
several such persons through tbe co-operation
of the Commissioners of Emigration at
New York have been sent back by the steam
ers which brought them. A continuance of
this course may prove a more effective reme
dy than diplomatic remonstrance.
Treaties of commerce and navigation and
for. the regulation of consular privileges have
been concluded with Roumama and Servia,
since their admission into the family of Euro
pean States. ' -
Aa Is natural with continguous states hav
ing like institutions and like aims of advance
ment and development, the friendship of the
united states ana Mexico nas Deen constant
ly maintained. : This government has lost
no occasion of encouraging tne Mexican gov
ernment to a beneficial realization of the mu
tual advantages which will result from more
intimate commercial intercourse and from the
opening of the rich interior of Mexico to
railway enterprise. I deem it important that
means be provided to restrain the lawlessness
unfortunately so common on the frontier,
and to suppress the forays of the reservation
Indians on either side of the Rio Grande. "
The neighboring States of Central America
have preserved interests and peace, and their
outward relations toward us have been those
of in'imate friendship. There are encour
aging signs of this growing disposition to
subordinate their local interests to those
which are common to them by reason of their
geographical relations. The boundary dis
pute between Guatemala and Mexico has af
forded this government an opportunity to
exercise its good offices for preventing rup
ture between those States, and for procuring
a peaceful solution of the question. I cherish
a stronghope that, in view of our relations of
amity with both countries, our friendly coun
sels may be well received. . . .
The Costa Rican government lately IrUmed
an engagement with Colombia, settling by ar
bitration the boundary question between
those countries, providing the post of arbi
trator should be offered successively to the
King of the Belgians, the King Of Spain and the
President of the Argentine Confederation.
The King of the Belgians has declined to act,
but I am as yet not advised of the action of
the King of Spain. As we have certain inter
ests in the disputed territory, which are pro
tected by our treaty engagements with one
of tne parties, it is important that the arbi
tration should not proceed without our consent
and this government has accordingly thought
proper to make its views known to the par
ties to the agreement, as well as to intimate
them to the Belgian and the Spanish govern
ments.
The questions growing out of the proposed
interoceanic waterway, across the Isthmus of
Panama are of grave national importance.
This government has not been unmindful of
the solemn obligations imposed upon it by
its compact of 1846 with Colombia, as the
independent and sovereign mistress of the
territory orossed by the canal, and has sought
to render them effective by fresh engage
ments with the Colombian government look
ing to their practical execution. The nego
tiations to this end, after they had reached
what appeared to be a mutually satisfactory
solution here, were met in Colombia by a dis
avowal of the powers which it nover had as
sumed, and by a proposal for renewed nego
tiation on a modified basis. Meanwhile this
government learned that Colombia had pro
posed to European powers to join in a guar
antee of neutrality of the proposed. Panama
CanaL which would be in direct contraven
tion of our obligation, as the sole guarantee
of the integrity of tne uoiomman territory,
and of the neutrality of the canal itself. My
lamented predecessor felt it his duty to place
before the .European powers reasons .which
make the piior guarantee of the United
States indispensable, and for which
the interjection- of any foreign guar
antee - might be regarded as a
superfluous and unfriendly act. The
probable reliance . of the British govern
ment on the provisions of the uiayton-uui-wer
treaty of 1850, as affording room for a
share of the guarantees which the United
States covenanted with Colombia for years
before. I have not hesitated to supplement
the action of my predecessor by propossing
to Her Majesty's government the modifica
tion of that instrument and the abrogation of
such clauses thereof as do not comport with
the obligations of the United States towards
Colombia, or with the vital needs of the two
friendly parties to the compact.
This government sees with great concern
the continuance of the hostile station be
tween Chili, Bolivia and Peru. An early peace
between these republics is much to be desir
ed, not only that they may themselves be
spared further misery and - bloodshed, but
because their continued antagonism threat
ens consequences which are in my judgment
dangerous to the interests of republican gov
ernments on this continent, and calculated to
destroy the best elements of our free- and
peaceful civilization. As in the present ex
cited condition of popular feeling in these
countries there has been a serious misap
prehension of the position of the United
States, and as separate diplomatic-intercourse
with each, through independent ministers, is
sometimes subject, owing to the want of
prompt reciprocal communication, to tempo
rary misunderstanding, I have deemed it ju
dicious at the present time to send a special
envoy, accredited to all and each of them and
furnished with general instructions, which
will, I trust, bring these powers into friendly
relations.
The government of Venezuela maintains
its attitude of warm friendship and continues
with great regularity the payment of the
monthly quota of the diplomatic debt. With
out suggesting the direction in which Con
gress should act I ask its attention to the
pending questions affecting the distribution
of the sums thus far received. The relations
between Venezuela and France, growing out
of the same debt, have been for some time
past in an unsatisfactory state, and this gov
ernment, as the neighbor and one of the
largest creditors of Venezuela, has interposed
itself with the French government, with the
view of producing a friendly and honorable
adjustment.
I regret that the commercial interests be
tween the United States and Brazil, from
which great advantages were hoped a year
ago, have suffered from the withdrawal of
American lines of communication between
the Brazilian ports and our own.
Through the efforts of our minister resi
dent at Buenos Ayres and the United States
Minister at Santiago, a treaty has been con
cluded between the Argentine republic and
Chili, disposing of the long pending Pata
gonian boundary question. It is a matter of
congratulation that our government has been
afforded an opportunity of successfully ex
erting its good influence for the prevention
of disagreement between these republics of
the American continent.
I am glad to inform you that the treaties
lately negotiated with Uhina nave been duly
ratified on both sides and the exchange made
at fekin." Legislation is necessary to carry
its provisions into effect. The prompt and
friendly spirit with which the Chinese gov
ernment, at the request of the United States,
conceded the modification of existing treaties,
should secure a careful regard for the inter
ests and susceptibilities of that government
in the enactment of any laws relating to Chi
nese immigration. Those clauses of the
treaties which forbid the participation of
citizens on vessels of the United States in the
opium trade will doubtless receive your ap
proval. They will attest the sincere interest
which our people and government feel in the
commendable efforts of the Chinese govern
ment to put a stop to the demoralizing and
destructive traffic. In relation both to China
and Japan some changes are desirable in our
present system of consular jurisdiction. I
hope at some future time to lay before you a
scheme for its improvement.
The intimacy between our country and
Japan, the most advanced of the Eastern
nations, continues to be cordial. I am ad
vised that the Emperor contemplates the es
tablishment of full constitutional govern
ment and that he has already summoned a
parliamentary congress for the purpose of
effecting the change. Such a remarkable
step toward - complete assimilation with the
Western system cannot fail to bring Japan
into closer and more beneficial relationship
with ourselves, as the chief . Pacifio power.
A question has arisen in relation to the ex
ercise in that country of the judicial func
tions conferred upon our ministers and con
suls. The indictment, trial and conviction in
the consular court at Yokohama of .John
Ross, a merchant seaman on an American
vessel, have made it necessary for the gov
ernment to institute a careful examination
into the nature and method of this jurisdic
tion. It appeared that Ross was regularly
shipped under the flag of the United States,
but was by birth a British subject. My prei
decessor felt it bis duty to maintain the posi
tion that during his service as a regularly
shipped seaman on board an American mer
chant vessel Ross was subject to the laws of
that service and to the jurisdiction of the
United States consul and authorities. I re-
new the recommendation, which has been
heretofore urged by the Executive, upon the
attention of Congress, that after the return
of such amount as may be found due Ameri
can citizens, the balance of the indemnity
funds heretofore obtained from China and
Japan, and which are now in the hands of
the State department, be returned to the gov
ernments of those countries.
The King of Hawaii, in the course of his
homeward return, after a journey around the
world has lately visited this country. While
our relations with that kingdom are friendly,
the government has viewed with concern the
efforts to seek replenishment of the dimin
ishing population of the islands from out
ward sources, to a degree which may impair
the native sovereignty and independence, in
which the United States was among the first
to testify a lively interest.
Relations of unimpaired amity have been
maintained throughout the year with the re
spective governments of Austria, Hungary,
Belgium, Denmark, Hayti, Paraguay and
Uruguay, Portugal, and Sweden and Nor way.
This may also be said of Greece and Ecua
dor, although our relations with those States
have for some years been severed by the
withdrawal of the appropriations for diplo
matic representatives at Athens' and Quito.
It seems expedient to restore those missions,
even on a reduced scale,' and I decidedly rec
ommend such a course with respect to Ecua
dor, which is likely, within the near future,
to play an important part among the nations
of the Southern Pacific
At its last extra session the senate called
for the text of the Geneva Convention for
the relief of the wounded in war. I trust
that this action foreshadows such interest in
the subject as will result in the adhesion of
the United states to mat numane ana com
mendable engagement.
I invite your attention to the propriety of
adopting the new code of international rules
for the prevention of "collisions on the high
seas, and of conforming the domestic legisla
tion of the United States thereto, so that no
confusion may arise from the application of j
different nationalities meeting in tidal waters, j
These international rules dijfer but siigntiy
from our own, and they have been adopted
by the Navy department for the government j
of the war ships of the United States on the 1
high seas and in foreign waters, and,through 1
the fcction of the State department in dissem
inating the rules and in acquainting ship
masters of the option of conforming to them
without the jurisdictional waters of the
United States, they are now very generally
known and obeyed. ;.-.
The State department still continues to
publish to the country the trade and manu
facturing reports received from its officers
abroad. The success of this course warrants
its continuance and such appropriation as
may be required to meet the rapidly increas
ing demand for these publications. With
special reference to -the Atlanta Cotton Ex
position, the October number of the reports
was devoted to a valuable collection of pa
pers on the cotton goods trade of the world.
The International Sanitary Conference, for
which, in 1879, Congress made provision, re
assembled in this city early in January last,
and its sessions were prolonged until March.
Although it reached no specific conclusions
affecting the future action of the participant
powers, the interchange of views proved to
be most valuable. The full protocols of the
sessions have been already presented to the
Senate. As pertinent to this general subject
I call your attention to the operations of the
National Board of Health, established by act
of Congress, approved March 3d, 1879. Its
sphere of duty was enlarged by the act of
June 2d in the same year, tsj the last named
act the Board was required to institute such
measures as might be deemed necessary for
preventing the introduction of contagious or
infectious diseases from foreign countries
into the United States, or from one State
into another. The execution of the rules
and regulations prepared by the board, and
approved by my predecessor, has done much
to arrest the progress of epidemic disease
and has thus established service to tne nation.
The International Sanitary Conference, -to
which I have referred, adopted a form of
bill of health to be used by all vessels seek
ing to enter the ports of countries whose re
presentatives parucipaitHi ui itn ututmunuun
This form has since been prescribed by the
National Board of Health and incorporated
with its rules and regulations, which have
been approved by me m pursuance of law.
The health of the people is of supreme im
portance and all measures looking to their
protection against the spread or contagious
diseases, and to increase our sanitary
knowledge for such purposes, deserve the at
tention ot uongress.
THE FINANCES.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
represents in detail a nigniy sausiactory ex
hibit of the state of the finances and the con
dition of the various branches of the public

The requirements of the sinking fund for the
year amounted to $90,786,064.02, which sum
included a balance of $49,817,128.78 not pro
vided for during the present fiscal year. The
sum of $74,480,201.05 was applied to this
fund, which left a deficit of $16,305,873.47.
The increase of the revenues for 1881 over
those of the previous year was $29,352,901.
10. It is estimated that the receipts during
the present Steal year will reach $400,000,
000, and the expenditures $270,000,000, leav
ing a surplus of $130,000,000, " applicable to
the sinking fund and the redemption of the
DUbhc debt.
I approve the recommendation of the Sec
retary of the Treasury, that provision be
made for the early retirement of silver cer
tificates and that the act requiring their is
sue be' repealed. They were issued in pur
suance of the policy of the government to
maintain silver at or near tne gold stanaara,
and were accordingly made receivable for all
customs, taxes and public dues. About
$66,000,000 of them are now outstanding.
They form an unnecessary addition -to the
paper currencv, a sufficient amount of wnicn
may be readily supplied by the national
banks.
In accordance with the Act of February
28. 1878. the Treasury nepartment has
monthly caused at least $2,000,000 in value
of silver bullion to be cornea into standard
silver dollars. 110,000,000 of these dollars
have been already coined, while only about
4534.000,000 are in circulation. For the rea
sons which he specifies, I concur in the Sec
retary's recommendation that the provision
for coinage of a fixed amount each month be
repealed, and that hereafter only so much be
coined as shall be necessary to supply the de
mand. . The Secretary advises that the issue
of gold certificates should not for the present
be resumed, and suggests that the national
banks may properly be forbidden by Jaw to
retire their currency, except upon reasonable
notice of their intention so to do. Such leg
islation would seem to be justified by the re
cent action of certain banks on the occasion
referred to in the Secretary's report of the
$15,000,000 of fractional currency still out
standing, only about $80,000 has been ra.
deemed the past year. The suggestion that
this amount may properly be dropped from
future statements of the publio debt seems
worthv of approval. So also does the sug
gestion of the Secretary as to the advisability
of relieving the calendar of the United States
courts in the' southern district of New York,
by tbe transfer to another tribunal of the
numerous suits there pending against collec
tors.
The revenue from customs for the past fis
cal year was $198,159,676.02, an increase of
$11,637,611.42 over that of the year preced
ing. $138,098,562.89 of this amount was
collected at the port of New York, leaving
$50,251,113.63 as the amount collected at all
the other ports of the country. Of this sum
$47,977,137.63 was collected on sugar, mela
do and molasses ; $27,285,624.78 on wool and
its manufactures; $21,462,534.34 on iron and
steel, and manufactures thereof; 19,038,
665.81 on manufactures of silk ; $10,825,
115.21 on manufactures "of cotton and $6,-
469,643.04 on wines and spirits, making a
total revenue from these sources of $133,
059,720. The expenses for collection during
the past year were $6,419,345.20, an increase
ovr the preceding year of $387,410.
04. Notwithstanding the increase in
the revenue from customs over the
preceding year, the gross value pf the imports,
including tree goods, aecreasea over 9zo,uuu,-
000. The most marKed decrease was in the
valne of unmanufactured wool, $114,023,
682, and that of scrap and pig iron,$12,810,
67L The value of imported sugar on the
other hand showed an increase of $7,457,
474, of steel rails $4,345,521, of barley $2,-
154,204, of steel in bars, ingots, etc, ti,-
620,046. Contrasted with the imports dur
ing the last fiscal year the exports were as
follows: Domestic merchandise, $883,925,
947 ; foreign merchandise, $18,451,399 ;
total, $902,377,346 ; imports of merchan
dise, $642,664,628 ; excess of exports
over imports of merchandise, $269,712,718 ;
aggregate of exports and imports . $1,545,
041,974. Compared with the previous year
there was an increase of $66,738,688 in the
value of exports of merchandise, and a de.
crease of $25,290,118 in the value of imports.
The annual average of the imports of mer
chandise over exports thereof - for ten
years previous to June 30, 1873, was $104,
806,922, but for the last six years there has
been an -excess of exports over imports of
merchandise amounting to $1,180, 668,103,an
annual average of $196,778,017. . The special
value of the exports of domestic merchandise
was $376,616,474 in 1BVU ana )00i,ZD,( in
1881, an increase of $507,309,374 or 13S per
cent. The value of imports was $43o,Uo8,
408 in 1870 and $642,664,628 in 1881. an in
crease of $20,678,220. or 47 per cent. Dur
ing each year, from 1862 to 1879 inclusive, j
the exports of specie exceeded the imports.
The largest excess of such exports over im
ports was reached during the year 1864,
when it amounted to $92,280,929 ; but dur
ing the year ended June 30, 1880, the imports
of coin and bullion exceeded the export a by
$75,891,391, and during the last fiscal year
the excess of imports over exports was $91.
168,650. In the last annual report of the Secretary
of the Treasury, the attention of Congress
was called to the fact that $469,651,050 in
five per cent, bonds, and $203,573,750 in six
per cent, bonds would become redeemable
during the year, and Congress was asked to
authorize the refunding of these bonds at a
lower rate of interest. The bill for such re
funding having failed to become a law, the
Secretary of the Treasury in April last noti
fied the holders of the $199,690,400 six per
oent. bonds, then outstanding, that
the bonds would be paid at par on the 1st
day of July following, or that they might
be "continued" at the pleasure of the gov
ernment to bear interest at the rate of three
and one-half per cent, per annum. Under
this notice $178,055,150 of the six per cent,
bonds were continued at the lower rate, and
$17,635,250 were redeemed. In May a like
notice was given respecting the redemption
or continuance of the $439,841,350 of five
per cent, bonds then outstanding, and of
these $401,504,900 were continued at three
and one-half per cent, per annum, and $38,
336,450 redeemed. The six per cent, bonds
of the loan of February 8, 1861, and of the
Oregon war debt, amounting together to
$14,125,800, having matured during the
year, the Secretary of the Treasury gave
notice of his intention to redeem
the same, and such as have been pre
sented have been paid from the surplus
revenues. There have also been redeemed at
par $16,179,100 of the three and a half per
cent. -continued" bonds, making a total of
bonds redeemed, or which hanro ceased to
bear interest, during the year of $123,969.
650. The reduction of the annual interest
on the public dobt through these transac
tions is as follows : By reduction of inter
est to three and one half per cent., $10,473,
952.25; by redemption of bonds, $6,352,
240 ; total, $16,826,292.25.
The three and one-half per cent, bonds,
being payable at the pleasure of the govern
ment, are available for the investment of
surplus revenue without the payment of premiums.-
Unless these bonds can be funded
at a much lower rate of interest than they
now bear, I agree with the Secretary of the
Treasury that no legislation respecting them
is desirable.
It is a matter for congratulation that the
business of the county has been so prosper
ous during the past year as to yield by taxa
tion a large surplus of income to the govern
ment. If the revenue laws remain unchang
ed this surplus must year by year increase,
on account of the reduction of the publio
debt and its burden of interest, and because
of the rapid increase of our population. In
I860, just prior to the institution of our in
ternal revenue system, our population ex
ceeded 30,000,000. By the census of 1880, it
is now found to exceed 50,000,000. It is es
timated that even if the annual receipts and
expenditures should continue as at present,
the entire debt would be paid in ten years.
In view, however, of the heavy load of taxa
tion which our people have already borne, we
may well consider whether it is not the part
of wisdom to reduce the revenues, even if we
delay a little the payment of the debt. It
seems to me the time has arrived when the
people may justly demand some relief from
their present onerous burden, and that by
due economy in the various branches of the
publio service this may readily be afforded.
I therefore concur with the Secretary in rec
ommending the abolition of all internal rev
enue taxes, except those upon tobacco in its
various forms, and upon distilled spirits and
fermented liquors, and except also the spe
cial tax upon the manufacturers of and deal
ers in such articles. The retention of the lat
ter is desirable, affording the officers of the
government a proper supervision of the arti
cles for the prevention of fraud.
1 agree with the secretary of the Treasury
that the law imposing a stamp tax upon
matches, proprietary articles, plaving cards.
checks and drafts may with propriety be re
pealed, and the law also by which banks and
bankers are assessed upon their capital and
deposits. There seems to be a general senti
ment in favor of this course. In the present
condition of our revenues the tax upon de
posits is -especially- ma just. It war never im
posed in this country until it was demanded
by tbe necessities of war and was never ex
acted, I believe, in any other country even in
its greatest exigencies. Banks are required
to secure their circulation by pledging with
the Treasurer of the United States bonds of
the general government. The interest upon
these bonds, which at tbe time the tax was
imposed was Six per cent., is now, in most
instances, three and one-half percent. Be
sides, the entire circulation was originally
limited by law and no increase was allowa
ble. W hen the existing banks had practically
a monopoly of the business there was force
in the suggestion that for the franchise to
the favored grantees the government might
very properly exact a tax on the circulation,
but for years the system has been free and
the amount of circulation regulated by the
public demand. The retention of this law
has been suggested as a means of reimburs
ing the government for the expense of print
ing and furnishing the circulating notes. If
the tax should be repealed it would certainly
seem proper to require the national banks to
pay the amount of such expense to the
Comptroller of the Currency.
It is perhaps doubtful whether the imme
diate reduction of the rate of taxation upon
liquors and tobacco is advisable, especially in
view of the drain upon the Treasury which
must attend the payment of -arrears of pen
sions.
A comparison, however, of the amount of
the taxes collected under the varying rates of
taxation which have at different times pre
vailed suggests the intimation that some re
duction may be made soon without a mate
rial diminution of the revenue. The tariff
laws also need revision, but that a due regard
may be paid to the conflicting interests of
our citizens important changes should be
made with caution. If a careful revision
cannot be made at this session a commission,
such as was lately approved by the Senate
and is now recommended by the Secretary of
the Treasury, would doubtless lighten the
labors of Congress whenever this subject
shall be brought to its consideration.
THE WAS DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of War will
make known the operations of that depart
ment for the past year. He suggests meas
ures for promoting the., efficiency of the ar
my without adding to the number of its offi-
cers, and recommends the legislation neces
sary to increase the number of enlisted men
to 30,000, the maximum allowed by law.
This he deems necessary to maintain quiet
ness on our ever shifting frontier, to pre- -serve
peace and suppress disorder and ma-
rauding in new settlements, to protect set
tlersand their property against the Indians
and the Indians against the encroachments
of intruders, and honorable, peaceful immi
grants to establish homes in the most remote
parts of our country. The army is now
necessarily scattered over such a vast extent
of territory that whenever an outbreak oc
curs reinforcements must be sent from many
quarters over great distances, and always at
heavy cost for transportation of men.horses,
wagons and supplies. I concur in the recom
mendations of the Secretary for increasing the
army to the strength of 30,000 enlisted men.
It appears by the Secretary's report that in
the absence of disturbances on the frontier
the troops have been actively employed in
collecting Indians hitherto hostile and loca
ting them on their proper reservation; that'
Sitting Bull and his adherents are now pris
oners at Fort Randall, that Utes have been
moved to their new reservation in Utah, that
during recent outbreaks of the Apaches it
was necessary to re-enforoe the garrisons in
Arizona by troops withdrawn from New Mex
ico, and that some of the Apaches are now -
held prisoners for trial, while some have es
caped and the majority of the tribe are now
on their reservation. There is need of legis
lation to prevent trespass upon, the lands set
apart tor tne Indians. A large military force
at great expense is now required to patrol
the boundary line between Kansas and the
Indian Territory. The only punishment
that can at present be inflicted is the forcible"
removal of the intruders and the imposition
of a pecuniary fine which in most cases it is-
lmpossible to collect There should be a
penalty by imprisonment in such cases. -
The separate organization of the signal
service is urged by the Secretary of War, and
full statement of the advantage of such
permanent organization is presented in the
report of the chief signal officer. A detailed
account of the useful work performed by the
signal corps and weather bureau is also giv
en in the report. I ask attention, to the
statements of the Secretary of War regard
ing requisitions frequently made by the In
dian bureau upon the subsistence depart
ment of the army for the casual support of
bands and tribes of Indians whose appropri- -ations
are exhausted. The War department .
should not be left by - reason of inadequate
provision for the Indian bureau to contribute
for thar maintenance of the Indians. : ?
