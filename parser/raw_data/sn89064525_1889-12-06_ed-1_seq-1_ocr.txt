President Harrison's First Corn,
munlcation a Very Compre­
hensive Document.
Reduction of Surplus by a Low
er Tariff Needod—Indian
Policy Approved.
Congressional Control of Elections
Territorial Government for Okla­
homa—Civil Service Eeform.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—The president's
message was read at the joint session of
HE»3E and senate. The document con­
tained over 14,000 words and its reading
occupied an hour and fifteen minutes.
Good will and cordiality, Mr. Harrison
says, characterizes our relations with
all foreign countries. The international
convention, now in session at Washing­
ton, affords opportunities of still further
extending relations with South Ameri­
can states, and congress is
asked to give
its co-operation in furthering such a re­
sult. The maritime conference is also
expected to bring the United States into
closer relations with European countries.
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.
In regard to diplomatic relations the
president recommends that our repre­
sentatives in. South America be advanced
to a rank corresponding
to that
of the
representatives from those countries.
The failure of the negotiation of a Chi­
nese treaty has left questions open which
congress should settle, especially the ex­
clusion of labor immigration. Samoan
affairs are in a satisfactory state. Ques­
tions between the United States and
Great Britain are in an encouraging way
to adjustment. The fisheries dispute
with Canada has been during the past
year marked by temperate action on both
sides. Questions regarding citizenship
of foreign born subjects naturalized in
America, continue to arise, notably in
France, Italy, kussia and Turkey.
Special conventions to settle for­
ever all such difficulties are recom­
mended. Water boundary between the
United States and Canada should be
definitely fixed. Extraditable offense
list should be enlarged.
THE BRAZILIAN REVOLUTION.
The recent revolt in Brazil has not
interrupted friendly relations with that
country. Our minister there has been
instructed to fully recognize the republic
when a majority of tne citizens have
voted for such a form of government
REGARDING THE SURPLCS.
Report of the secretary of the treasury
shows receipts for 1889 exceed expendi­
tures §57.470,129.59, for current year
$43,678,983.01, for 1891, estimated, $48,
569,522.30. Existence of so large an
actual and anticipated surplus should
have immediate attention of congress, to
reduce receipts of government to the ex­
penditures. Buying bonds at premium
is a questionable expedient, but one
which is the only resort under present
conditions. Placing government funds
in national banks without interest is a
dangerous expedient for getting the
money in circulation and should be im­
mediately stopped.
LOWER PROTECTIVE TARIFF.
Revision of the tariff law I9 recom­
mended. The irregularities of the law
should be adjusted but the protective
principle should be retained and applied
to farm products as well as manufac
turns. Tne free list can safely be ex­
tended by removal of internal revenue
tax on tobacco, and, if safeguards
against fraud can be secured, the re­
moval of the tax on spirits used in the
arts would be desirable.
SILVER COINAGE.
The net increase of money in circula­
tion in the last decade has been $5FK),234,
193. The total coinage of silver dollars
Nov. 1. 1889, was $343,638,001, of which
$283,539,521 are in the treasury vaults.
Silver certificates for §227,319,044 of the
amount in vault are outstanding. No sec­
retary of the treasury has deemed it ex­
pedient to increase the monthly purchase
of bullion from the §2,000,000 directed by
law to the $4,000,000 allowable. The
value of bullion used in a silver dollar
has fallen in the past ten years from 93
cents to 72 cents. If silver is to be used
a,s a monetary medium the relative value
of gold and silver bullion must be ex­
pected to be taken into consideration in
commercial transactions. Such a result
would be discreditable to our financial
management and business interests. We
should not tread on such dangerous
ground.
COAST DEFENSE.
We are practically without coast de­
fense. Our forts and other structures,
while good enough for the arms of the
day in which they were made, would be
worse than no protection for the modern
guns now under construction for harbor
use. An appropriation for new works
at the most important points should be
made at once.
RIVERS AND HARBORS.
Improvement of our important rivers
and harbors should not lie allowed to
cease. A more systematic plan should
be adopted and the work pushed more
rapidly.
OUR COURTS.
The need of better protection for jur­
ists is shown in the Terry shooting case.
Business of the supreme courts would
be expedited by the establishment of
an appellate court having final jurisdic-'
Hon in certain classes of cases. The BU- I
preme court recommends this.
TRUSTS.
Congress should take such action as 1
they find they Can to crush out monopolies I
commonly called trusts. The enactment!
of a national bankrupt law would be de­
sirable. Naturalization laws should be
revised. No emigrant should be given
citizenship who is an enemy of social
order or who has taken oaths at variance
with our laws.
POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT.
Suggestions of the postmaster general
are approved, especially the plan of di­
viding the service into districts that
shall include include instructions and
suggestions, and a rating of efficiency of
postmasters.
THE NAVY.
The report of the secretary of the navy
shows rapid improvement* but no in­
crease
in the number
of naval vessels as
the same number have been condemned
or lost as have been added. The country
needs more cruisers and congress should
make appropriations for them.
INDIAN QUESTION.
Substantial progress has been made in
Indian education and
in allotment
lands. Such a course is an incentive to
thrift and is contributing to settling the
problem of what shall be done with the
red man. Negotiations for opening a
portion of the Sioux reservation and the
allotment in severalty of the remainder
have been successful. Its ratification by
congress is asked. The work of the
Cherokee commission has not yet
reached a conclusion.
OKLAHOMA AND ALASKA.
Oklahoma' has how a population of
60,000. The City of Guthiie has 8,000.
Oklahoma City 5,000. There are several
other important cities and towns. These
have no GOVERNMENT bnt martial law.
Congress should create a territorial gov­
ernment.
Provisions should be made for acquisi­
tion- of titles to real estate is Alaska.
Xand laws should be extended to that
section and the power given to levy
taxes. An appropriation for education
•hoold be pade. THE population Is so
badly, scattered as to offer

snips and arduous duties
of our
most
bloody campaigns are now disabl&L from
diseases which had a real, though not
traceable, origin in the service. The
pension roll is already large, but this
should not deter the government from
giving such veterans full justice. There
are irregularities in the present law
which should be remedied, but not in
the line of reduction.
SIGNAL SERVICE AND WORLD'S FAIR.
The signal service should be taken
from the war department and made a
bureau in the agricultural department.
Such legislation as is necessary is recom­
mended for the opening of a world's
fair in some one of our cities to com­
memorate the 400th anniversary of Co­
lumbus' landing.
LAND LAWS.
The policy which has been in force in
land department has worked big damage
to settlers. This has been greatly
changed by this administration. The
land laws should be interpreted as fa­
vorably as possible for the settlers, but
safeguards sliould be erected to prevent
the acquiring of large tracts of timber or
other lands DY individuals or companies
through frauds. When discovered such
frauds should be punished to the full ex­
tent of the law.
CIVIL SERVICE.
The civil service commission force is
inadequate and should be enlarged.
Heretofore the book of eligibles in the
various departments has been closed to
the public. This has caused charges of
fraud. The books have been opened to
the public.- The purpose of the civil ser­
vice law was to exclude political consid­
erations in connection with appoint­
ments. Some recent congressional
investigations have shaken public faith
in its efficacy. Reform of civil service
will make no progress
till the law and its
enforcement are well established. If
some of its provisions have been fraudu­
lently evaded our resentment should not
suggest a repeal of the law, but its re­
form.
EDUCATION.
Grants for education have heretofore
been in lands. The time has come when
this resource is nearly exhausted. Ap­
propriations in cash are f6r the future
recommended.
TEE NEGEO PROBLEM.
The colored people did not intrude
themselves upon us. They were brought
here and held for years in chains. Hap­
pily for both races, they are now free.
Since EMANCIPATION they HA^E made
GREAT progress education and acquisi
sition of property. They have gained
honor and respect on the battlefield and
in the sho{) and farm. But, notwith­
standing this, in parts of the country
where the colored population is large,
they are yet deprived of their rights, po­
litical and civil. This wrong effects not
only their own community but every
part of the nation. It is a 6hame
on our civilization that this is so,
and this generation should courageously
face these grave questions and work
their solution. The power of congress
to take the whole direction and control
of congressional elections is clearly de­
fined. The present, law for a partial
supervision of such elections should be
strengthened and extended by taking all
the processes of such elections under
federal control.
MERCHANT MARINE.
Subsidies should be granted for the es­
tablishment: of lines of commercial
steamers, notably to South and Central
America, Mexico, China, Japan and
Australia. Provisions could also well be
made for a naval reserve of such vessels
in our merchant marine as were fitted
for war use.
These and such other measures as the
peace and honor of our country suggest
are recommended to the serious consid­
eration of this congress.
WHERE IS PARNELL?
Xlie Great Irish I'atr.ot lias Not Been
Seen Tar Several Weeks.
LONDON, Dec. 3.—The St. James Ga­
zette says that Mr. Parnell disappeared
several weeks ago, and since then he had
not been heard from. His whereabouts
is a mystery and his prolonged absence
causes much trouble to his adherents.
The Gazette says that though it has BEEN
Mr. Parnell'S custom occasionally to se­
clude himself, hi: eriod of retirement
has this time bet-I longer than usual.
He has even failei!
to keep a
number of
important engagements, among which
w-as one to meet Mr. Gladstone.
LATEST FROM STANLEY.
He Expccts to 15o at Uogoiuayo Wednes­
day and at Zanzibar Thursday.
LONDON, Dec. 2.—The Herald's Zanzi
bar special says: Stanley, writing from
Wikessi, Nov. 26, states that all the
party are well and enjoying Capt. Wis
mann's luxuries. He complains that his
mail has been lost or stolen. In a post­
script dated the 27th he announces that
he has received the English consul's let­
ters and expects to arrive at Bogamoyo
on Wednesday, Dec. 4, and at Zanzibar
Thursday.

This Session.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.—The house of
representatives was called to order one
minute after noon
by John B. Clark, the
clerk of the house in the Fiftieth con­
gress. Long before that hour the corri­
dors of the Capitol were thronged with
women and children. The doors of the
house galleries were closed against them
for a time, because of the Democratic
caucus in progress, and the first tendency
of the throng was to turn in the direc­
tion of the senate chamber, where the
galleries and floors were both empty.
But the greater interest centered in the
house, and a crowd gradually assembled
about its doors that packed the hallways
and made progress through them matter
of difficulty. When the doors were
thrown open not only the galleries, but
the floor of the house, quickly filled with
strangers. A great many of the new Re­
publican members were at hand early.
In the vacant space surrounding the
members' seats were a number of ladies,
and several ladies sat in the members'
seats. The galleries were crowded
to the
doors. Mrs. Reed and Mrs. Carlisle sat
in the members' gallery. The president's
gallery was filled but no familiar faces
from the executive mansion were there.
Several members of the Pan-American
congress and the marine conference oc­
cupied seats in the diplomatic and execu­
tive galleries. Sir Julian Pauncefote,
who sat in the diplomatic gallery, was
an appreciative looker-on. On the floor
many familiar faces were to be seen.
Thomas B. Reed, who came in almost on
the stroke of noon, occupied his old ac­
customed seat in the rear of the house.
The election of officers of the house
was delayed
by
an effort to break the
caucus action on chaplain and substitute
the name of Dr. Milburn the old chap­
lain for that of Dr. Ramsdell, the caucus
nominee. A great part of the afternoon
was spent
in calling the roll. The house
elected all the officers chosen by the cau­
cus Saturday excepting Dr. Ramsdell,
the caucus nominee for chaplain. Dr.
Milburn, the blind preacher, was re­
elected chaplain.
Messrs. McKinley, Cannon and Car­
lisle were made a committee to inform
the president that the house was in ses­
sion.
A resolution was agreed to providing
that ex-Speakers Banks, Randall and
Carlisle and Mr. Kelly be permitted to
choose their seats and that the remain­
ing seats be apportioned by lot.
At the conclusion of the lottery of
seats, a resolution was adopted authoriz­
ing the speaker to appoint committees on
rules, niileage, enrolled bills and ac­
counts to consist of the same number as
did the committees in the last house and
referring the rules of the Fiftieth con­
gress to the committee on rules.
At 4:30 p. m. the house adjourned.

senate proceeedings was much less than
was felt in the proceedings of the house.

assemblage to order at noon. Many
of the senators occupied seats on the
floor some time before the noon hour.
Six new desks had been placed on the
Republican side of the chamber and five
of them were occupied by the senators
from the new Western states. Senator

oath of office to Senators Chandler, of
New Hampshire, and Nathan Dixon, of
Rhode Island. Th« credentials of Sen­
ators Moody and PiHagnw, of South
Dakota, and Allan and Squire, of Wash­
ington, were presented, and the new sen­
ators, being escorted to the clerks desk,
took the oath of office.
Under a resolution adopted Senators
Edmunds and Harris were appointed a
committee to join a committee of the

FIFTY-FIRST CONGRESS.
Some of the Matters Which Will be Con­
sidered
at
1
Jails Craiiscnut
This Session.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.—There are
many questions to be considered by
this congress which cannot be settled on
party lines. The principal topics to come
before it for discussion are the tariff, the
silver question, federal control of na­
tional elections, a proposition to repeal
the civil service law and the appropria­
tion of money for rivers and harbors and
other local objects and enterprises. The
tariff question
was the chief issue in
the
last congress. It will divide interest this
term with
The Silver Question.
The question of silver coinage has been
much agitated of late months and
Mr. Leech, the director of the
mint, has expressed the belief that con­
gress will increase the coinage Of silver.
The only doubt that exists is whether
the extremists in both houses of con­
gress will not prevent legislation by re­
fusing to accede to any proposition for
moderate legislation.
Tariff and Internal Bevenue.
Two correlative questions which agi­
tated the last congress will come up be­
fore the Fifty-first congress for a
deal
of discussion.
An effort will be
made to amend the tariff laws and*
strong influence will be brought to bear
to have THE internal revenue laws re­
pealed. It is generally understood that
the Republican majority in the house
and senate will make an. effort to have a
bill on the line of the Allison tariff bill of
last year pot through both houses and
sent to the president. The discussion, of
this question may be postponed for
sev­
eral months. It is bound to absorb a
it
deal of the attention
duce a bill to
Abolish Civil Service Examinations.
He
has discussed
the matter with the
president and told him what he proposes
to do. He denounces the law as a me­
nace to good .government. Representa­
tive Chandler, of Georgia, will also in­
troduce a bill to repeal the civil service
law.
The question of the relations between
the United States and Canada, and of
the effect
of competition of the Caniidian
Pacific railroad and its connections with
the railroads of this country will come
up for discussion in the senate under the
reports to bo presented by special com­
mittees which have been investigating
the subject during the past summer.
To Organize Oklahoma.
Congress will be asked at an early day
to provide a form of government for
Oklahoma. A bill for this purpose is
now being prepared under the supervis­
ion of the secretary of the interior. The
national pension committee of the Grand
Army of the Republic has formulated a
number of pension bills which will be
offered for consideration. Principal
among these is the per diem allowance
pension bill, and the total disability pen­
sion bill.
The World's Fair location.
One of the early cjue.stions to !e con­
sidered by congress is the location of the
world's fair of 1893. The claims of New
York, Washington, St. Louis and Chi­
cago will be warmly pressed in the
beginning of the session, find the ques­
tion will likely not be disposed of until
January or February.
