FLECTS EUROPEAN OPINION.
FATHERS FAITH FORSAKEN
Friends of America, He Writes, Wring
Their Hands in Despair Over What
They Consider the Fall of the
United States in Seeking Territorial
Expansion—Europe Envious.
London, Nov. 24. —William T. Stead,
writing from Rome, under date of Nov.
21st. says;
“The answer to the question, what
does the old world think of the new
world, has never been made with
greater emphasis than in the eternal
city. The oldest old world regards the
newest new with feelings of anger, dis
gust and alarm almost too great
for words. The sentiment of indigna
tion differs in intensity. But it is uni
versal. There is no sympathy for the
United States either among the whites
or blacks. In fact, dislike of the
American seizure of the Philippines,
taken as a mere mask assumed in or
der to facilitate conquest, is almost the
only sentiment shared in common by
the rival camps of the quirinal and
the Vatican. With the kings of men
the sentiment is comparatively mild.
They do not believe in the disinterest
edness of the American war of lib
eration. Tae American declarations
were almost universally derided as hid
eous examples of w-orse than English
hypocrisy. Friends of America wring
their hands over the fall of the United
States under the temptation of lust of
territorial expansion. Her enemies
shoot out their lip and shriek in de
rision over what they regard as an un
mistakable demonstration which the
demand for the Philippines afford:
American cupidity, American bad faith
and American ambition. Americans
will do well to recognize some
such statement as the foregoing
represents the current opinion of al
most everyone In Europe who pays
even customary attention to
what Is going on abroad.
When I listened, as I have
been listening most of the past, to the
alternate taunts and lamentations of
the oes and friends of America, the
babei of voices seem at last to merge
into one scornful chorus of welcome to
Uncle Sam. A bright hope for the hu
man race was extinguished when one
non-military great power which
eschewed all schemes of aggression
and annexation enrolled itself among
the common people. The annexation
of the Philippine islands may seem
but a small thing, but it is decisive.
When Eve ate the apple it w T as but an
act of a moment, but it barred against
her forever the gates of paradise.
What tbe old world says is that the
new has now eaten the forbidden fruit
and the flaming sword, which turned
her away, will prevent her return to
the peaceful traditions of the fathers
of the public.
“Immediately after the war brokt
out, a diplomatic representative of the
powers communicated to the Americar
minister at an European court ir
plain and unmistakable terms the dis
pleasure of the powers and their desire
to express displeasure publicly and
forcibly. There were communcations
sufficiently serious for the contingency
of the allied forces of European na
tions for coercion of the United State?
to he frankly discussed between these
two diplomats. The result of the dis
cussion was to put aside all non-
European intervention.
“ Tf you intervene,' said the Ameri
can minister, ’it means war.’
“ ‘Yes,’ rejoined the visitor, ‘and the
forces of the great European powers
acting in alliance would overwhelm
any opposition America could offer.’
No doubt,’ said the American,
‘but you would have to bring your
forces across the Atlantic and keep
them there the rest of our natural life.
For the new world is not going to sub
mit to the old world any more. Not
any more than it submitted a century
since, when the odds were far worse.
And remember,’ he added, ‘that when
you are bringing your armies and na
vies across 3,000 miles of sea to fight
America, you would have to count
with England, she Is certainly not
friendly to your enterprise.’
“This put an extinguisher on the
proposal. These facts were told me
by a person most immediately con
cerned. The relations between the
embassies of Britain and America at
Constantinople and Rome could hard
ly be closer and more cordial. If
things go on as now', every English
speaking man will feel that he has not
one embassador, but two, in every
capitol in Europe and that behind him
wherever he goes, he is shielded by the
night, not of one empire, but of two,
a combination beneath whose shadow
the whole world may yet learn to rest
in peace.”

A JUDICIAL SCANDAL
CORRUPT OHIO JUDGE AND
LAWYER.
SENATOR BURKE DISBARRED
Cleveland Attorney Found Guilty of
Gross Violation of Professional
Ethics —Judge Bellenbaugh May Be
Impeached ‘by the Buckeye Legisla
ture —Question as to Jurisdiction.
Cleveland, Dec. 4. —The report of the
trial committee of the Bar association
on the disbarment proceedings against
Senator Vernon H. Burke, was pre
sented at a special meeting of the as
sociation Saturday. The report says in
part:
“We find Judge Bellenbaugh, while
acting as judge of said court intro
duced and sent to Burke, Mrs. Edith
Manning; that Burke performed serv
ices for her in connection with the set
tlement of a claim instituted by her
against a woman for alienating the af
fections of her husband in connection
with the preparation and hearing of
the divorce case against her husband
and that Burke received from Mrs.
Manning for these services about
$3,500.”
The committee also made the follow
ing recommendations:
“First —That Vernon H. Burke be ex
pelled from the Cleveland Bar associ
ation.
“Second —That the secretary of the
association be directed to present a
copy of these findings to the committee
on investigation, to he treated as a
complaint in writing authorizing such
proceedings against Judge Frank E.
Dellenbaugh as they may deem proper
“Third —That the secretary of the as
sociation be directed to present a copy
of this report to the circuit court of
Cuyahoga county for such action in the
premises as the court may deem
proper.”
It is regarded as doubtful whether
anything can be done with Judge
Dellensbaugh. He can only be re
moved from the bench by impeachment
proceedings before a higher court and
inasmuch as the acts charged against
him were committed, if at all, while he
was serving as judge by appointment,
and inasmuch as there was an interim
between that erra and the one for
which he was elected and is now serv
ing, the legislature, it is claimed,
would have no jurisdiction.

VIEWS ON MESSAGE
REPUBLICANS COMMEND AND
DEMOCRATS CONDEMN IT.
BUT MEMBERS SAY LITTLE
Many Senators Excuse Themselves
from Expression of Opinion on the
Ground That They Haven't Had
Sufficient Time to Carefully Read
the Document —Members Talk.
Washington, Dec. 6. —Many senators
excused themselves from expressions
of opinions at length upon the presi
dent’s message to congress on the
ground .hat htey had not been able to
give careful attention to all of its de
tails. The republican senators were,
however, willing to express themselves
in a few words of commendation.
Senator Cullom regarded it as “a
painstaking, entertaining and accurate
historical review,” Senator Platt
commended the expression of determ
ination to increase the standing army
and maintain order in Cuba until the
Cubans can take care of themselves.
Senator Wolcott said that it was an
admirable document. Senator Lodge
said that it was “able and excellent.”
Senator Foraker said: “It is a pres
entation of the facts generally, but a
little indefinite on the question of Cu
ban independence.” Senator Proc
tor said: “It is a good American pa
per.” Senator Perkins said: “It is
an able resume of the situation and
facts leading up to war.”
The democrats were even more
averse than the republicans to discuss
the paper. Senator Jones (Ark.) said
the message in several points did not
accord with his views. He also ques
tioned the president’s right to hold the
volunteers in service beyond the time
of the signing of the peace treaty, say
ing, “there is no nation in existence
where law requires such a condition.”
Senator Jones interpreted the presi
dent’s expression upon the finances as
a pronouncement for ,a gold standard
and the retirement of greenbacks, and
he does not believe the majority of
the American people will endorse him
in this respect. The senator expressed
the opinion that the president was in
clined to go farther in the matter of
the government of Cuba than the reso
lution of intervention called for. He
also expressed surprise at the absence
of any recommendation concerning the
Philippines.
Senator Teller said there would be
disappointment over the president’s
reference to the Philippines. “In the
recommendations regarding the cur
rency,” Mr. Teller said “the friends of
bimetallism will find no encourage
ment from anything the president
says. No reference is made to inter
national bimetallism, but the presi
dent in a most emphatic way indicates
his intention to maintain a gold stand
ard. The so-called silver republican
party is friendly to silver and will flncl
no encouragement in the president’s
message, and it will strike all as sing
ular that if the republican party, as it
is claimed, is in favor of international
bimetallism, the president should
make no reference to it.”
Representative Hitt, (rep., 111.) said:
“The president nas summarized and
solved in an ab.e and felicitous man
ner the questions touching the im
mense and rapidly succeeding recent
events, and the situation in which the
nation finds itself. His simple propo
sition to let our new possessions alone,
under just firm governments by the
military arm which conquered them,
gives us time for preparations for their
permanent government.”
Representative Grosvenor (rep., O.)
said: “The views of the president
upon currency reform will meet the in
telligent sanction of the sound money
element of all parties.” Mr. McMillin
(dera., Tenn.) said: “On the most im
portant question confronting the na
tion —what shall we do with the newly
acquired possessions—the president’s
message reminds me of the caption of
the last chapter of Johnson's Rasselas.
‘The conclusion in which nothing : s
concluded.’ ”
Mr. Cummings (dem.. N. V.) said;
“It is a concise statement of facts,
without suggestion or recommenda
tion. I have an idea the real message
will be sent in hereafter.”
Mr. Dingley( rep.. Me.) said; "It Is
to be noted that the president states
that our revenue laws are working well
with no suggestion of needed modifi
cation.”
Mr. Richardson (dem.. Tenn) said:
"It is disappointing that the president
failed to tell us what we are to do with
the new possessions. Banking and
currency and all financial reform leg
islation premised in 1896 get no men
tion.”
Mr. Bailey, the democratic floor lead
er. was called from the house by the
illness of his son, and asked to be ex
cused from expressing his views.
SOLD STOLEN PASSES
Two Chicago Ticket Brokers Arrestcu
on Serious Charge.
Chicago, Dec. 6. —After an investiga
tion covering almost ttvo weeks, secret
service officials of the Chicago &
Northwestern railway caused the arrest
of Louis Stine and Frank L. Rice, tick
et brokers, 200 Clark street, who, it is
charged, had been selling passes, tick
ets, and mileage of the company that,
the officials alleged, had been stolen
from the general offices. Officials of
the company were unable to state just
how much money the ticket brokers
had received through the sale of tick
ets, but the loss is estimated all the
way from SI,BOO to $2,000. Many of
the passes, it is said, were found in the
possession of Stine and Rice. The
man who sold the tickets to the 'brok
ers has not been arrested. The passes
were signed by the superintendent of
the dining car department and were is
sued to the department in book form
for the use of its employes. Officials
of the company did not notice the ex
cessive use of these passes until scores
of them had been used. The brokers,
it is said, had sold them for long trips
and it was estimated that a revenue of
from SI,OOO to $1,200 had been diverted
through the sales. The fact that one
pass was frequently made to read good
for two or three passengers first drew
the attention of the general ticket
auditor of the company, and on his re
port an investigation was set on foot.
It was then discovered that two books
of passes had been stolen from the of
fice of General Superintendent Shear
son of the dining car department, and
that hundreds of dollars worth of the
passes had been sold and used.
CONGRESS OF FARMERS.

mendations are non-partisan in na
ture. The governors of the different
states and territories have selected 12.-

ing the flower of the union’s agricul
tural class. The congress has a fine
program for discussion and the topics

City, Pittsburg & Gulf railway, will be
on hand, the assistant secretary of ag
riculture of Canada will give an ad
dress, and Booker T. Washington will

usual public interest. The same con
gress, six months ago, declared war
against Spain and now, with the war
fought and won, it came together again
for the first legislative consideration
of the questions developed by the
eventful months just past. Congress
convened promptly at noon. The gal

There was a good attendance of sena

Exactly at noon Speaker Reed’s gavel
came down with a sharp crack, the
great ebony mace entwined with sr

lifted into place upon its green marble
pedestal, the spreading folds of Amer

about the brilliant stained glass ceiling
and the house of representatives en
tered upon the closing session of the
memorable war congress. The scene
within the great hall was animated,
brilliant and picturesque.
Mr. Diugley, the floor leader of the
majority, and Mr. Bailey, the minority
leader, came in from the lobbies on the
respective sides. Mr. Bailey went im
mediately to his seat and Mr. Dingley
