IT IS reasonable to believe that W.

part of the president's message that
has started another quake in Califor

to elect President Roosevelt, before
the law prohibiting- corporations from

THE "WIDER STREET" MOVEMENT.
The proposed widening of Calumet
avene from eighty to 100 feet is a
timely suggestion that should be acted
upon at once.
Every progressive city In the coun
try has been confronted by the prob
lem of narrow thoroughfares as soon
as it has reached proportions where
congestion in which the average width
of streets becomes a possibility.
In majority of instances, however,
the necessity if ignored or fought
over until the expense of widening
makes the undertaking a serious prop
osition. If not impossible, it at least,
when Improved with many buildings.
Is attended by such great expense as
to work a hardship on many of those
who are obliged to bear the burden
of the improvement.
The widening of State street in Chi
cago, a quarter of century ago, was
ncconiplished only after the most bit
ter jopposltlon of property owners
whose buildings fronting that
thoroughfare had either to be moved
at great expense or torn down and re
built. Chicago right now is In the throes
of an agitation to widen Halsted street,
and Hammond will do well to take
warning from the rich heritage of ex
perience in this connection dearly
bouerht by other municipalities the
country over.
Calumet avenue is in the trend of the
encroachment of business, which is
bound to be eastward henceforth, and
while the widening of the street might
worts a Temporary narusnip upon a
few property owners right now, it will
He a iHT.ei.t in tne long run both to
the land holders and the city as a
whole.
WITH THE EDITORS.
To Change the Ballot Law.
Louis Ludlow, writing from Washing
ton to the Indianapolis Star, states
that there is a good deal of talk
among members of congress from In
diana of a movement to separate the
congressman's name from the county
ballot in future elections. It is prob
able that the republican members of
the Indiana delegation will hold a cau
cus on the subject soon and outline
plans for bringing this reform before
the state legislature at its coming ses
sion in Indianapolis. An act of the
legislature would be required to re
move the congressman's name from
the county ballot.
The recent elections In Indiana furn
ished many Illustrations of how con-
gressional candidates suffer by hav
ing their names appear on the county
ballot in each county of their respec
tive districts. This plan draws them
into the vortex of every local factional
light. The congressman often loses
heavily, not because there is any op
position within the party ranks to hiia.
but because of the local dissensions
directed against the county candidates.
Many men are afraid of losing their
votes if they "scratch" and therefore
they vote the entire county ballot of the
opposing party, at the same time vot
ing the state ballot of their own par
try. Others who undertake to scratch
thoir county ballots make a botch of
it and their votes are thrown out.
WHO ARE IIOOSIRItS.
Because a reader in the Indianapolis
Star lias suggested the name of Capt.
Eads for Indiana's niche in the Statu
ary hall, the Washington Herald is in
clined to treat this with levity, for the
reason that Capt. Eads has not lived
in this state all his life. In answer
the Star says:
"The Washington Herald waxes merry
over the fact that Capt. Eads is claim
ed as a Hoosier by some of the Star
voters, which it thinks "will doubtless
surprise many persons, who know that
this great engineer achieved all of his
fame only after he had left Indiana.'"
It stat-s that 'there is a good old prin
ciple in Indiana which lays down tho
rule 'that once a Hoosier always a
Hoosier,' and it is probably on this
principle that Eads is being considered.'
"And pray, why not? A Hoosier is
either a native or a resident of Indiana,
according to all the dictionaries and
ancient usage. A man once born in
Indiana can never be born anywhere
else. Ho is a Hoosier per sc. If a man
who has the misfortune to be born
elsewhere realizes hla unhappy lot and
comes to this state,
his repentance and
Indiana accepts
he becomes u
Hoosier by adoption.
"But the Herald ia rather late with
its theory. If it were applied now
there would have to be some removals
from Statuary hall. For example,
Pennsylvania has a statue of Robert
Fulton, and her claim to Fulton Is not
as strong as Indiana's claim to Eads.
Eads was not only born in Indiana
but also received all the schooling he
ever had In Indiana, and had shown
his taste for mechanical invention be
fore he left the state. Fulton left
Pennsylvania as a youth to study art
in England, and was turned to me
chanical pursuits later. Ho never re
turned to Pennsylvania to- reside, but
settled in New York, and died there.
"New Hampshire has given n statue
of Daniel "Webster as one of its sons,
but Webster's fame was made after he
had removed to Massachusetts. But
New Hampshire is entitled to him be
cause his early life and education form
ed his character and developed his
ability. Mere birth may be considered
an Incident,' but so may mere resi
dence. What locality is entitled to a
credit for a man's greatness, the one
that produced him, or the one where
he happens to locate? Rhode Island
sends a statue of Roger Williams,
but It did not make Roger Williams,
though he did something toward mak
ing Rhode Island after he came over
from Wales. John Wlnthrop was 42
years old when he came to Massa
chusetts, but Massachusetts sends in
his statue.
"If the Herald will look a little deep
er it may find cause for surprise in
Statuary hall. The law calls for stat
ues 'of deceased persons who have
been citizens thereof (the several states)
and are illustrious for their heroic re
nown, or from distinguished civic or
military service.' New Jersey has a
statue of Phil Kearny, who was born
in New York, and was a citizen of the
world. He was never a citizen of New
Jersey, but commanded the First Bri
gade of New Jersey troops in the civil
war until he was killed at Chantilly In
1S82. Wisconsin has a statue of Fath
er Marquette, who was never a citizen
of that state. Its only claim to him
is that he passed through the region
where the state is with Joliet, and
spent a winter at the mission on Green
Bay, because he was sick and could
not get away. Indiana has as much
claim to La Salle or Abraham Lincoln
as Wisconsin has to Marquette."
The Justice Shopa.
Speaking of justice
Chicago and Indiana
Journal says:
shops in both
the Lafayettt:
"The people of Chicago are rejoicing
over the abolition of the justice shops,
with their agents, the constables. By
act of the legislature the business of
the Justice courts henceforth will be
determined by a municipal court. There
Is a chief Justice and twenty-nine as
sociates composing the tribunal. Un
der the new law the municipal courts
and the agents of the law serve on
salaries, the fee feature being elimin
ated. Chicago has seen the fee system,
as it pertains to courts in its very
worst phase. Under the old law black
mail was common and Justice was rare.
The new order marks a great reform
and the people have reason for felicita
tion. The situation in Chicago should
suggest to the people of Indiana the
advisability of abolishing the anti
quated system now followed in this
state. The Indiana method at pres
ent is bad. Monetary reward is made
the premium for the enforcement and
prosecution of the law. The system
is pernicious, being an insult to the
law. Interpretation and prosecution
of the law should be divorced from
fees In Indiana. The coming session of
the legislature has an opportunity to
register a real reform on this question.
GETS NEW FEDERAL BUILDING.

Profanity On the Singe.
The use of profanity on the stage is
becoming so common that the average
audience is no longer shocked by lan
guage that ought not to be tolerated
either in the home or in public. Even
that sterling comedian Frank Danlel3
exclaims "good God," and the hardened
theater-goers overlook It. And he Is
one of the least of the offenders. We
do not beleive that the public wants
coarse plays or coarse language. They
expect at the variety theaters shocking
and vulgar expressions, and for the
most part accordingly stay away, or at
least keep the members of their
families whose Innocence they wish to
protect away from such places. But
they are not free from offenses at the
so-called best theaters. To hear
language in public that does not shock
"good society" is taken by the young
and Innocent to give license for the
use of such language everywhere. As
a rule, the best plays are free from
offenses in this particular. The public
knows a good, clean show as well, if
not better than the playwright knows
it. When the theatrical managers are
made to feel through the box-office
that profanity and vulgarity will not
be tolerated by a decent public they
will purge their plays of vulgar lan
guage and vulgar actions. Indianapo

Iii - Is Inadequate.
At Chicago a civil service postoffice
examination where it was hoped there
would be 600 applicants had thirty
nine. The cause is not the high stand
ard, but the low pay, says the Chi
cago Record-IIerld, which adds:
The pay offered is entirely Inade
uuate. In some branches of the serv
ice it is just what it was thirty years
ago, despite the great increase in the
cost of living. Postoffice clerks begin
ut $400 and increase slowly. The posi
tions that pay above $1,000 are few,
and are really in the executive staff
rather than in the staff of clerks. Let
ter carriers in large cities begin at
$600, and may reach $1,000. Railway
postal clerks receive from $S00 to $1,
500, but hundreds of them with excep
tionally short runs receive less than
the minimum of the schedule If rail
ways and manufacturing corporations
see the need at this time of increasing
the pay by 10 per cent,, surely the gov
ernment can do the same, especially
since there is more reason for the gov
ernment doing it under present condi
tions than there is for the railways do
ing it. It will be good economy for
congress to heed the postmaster-general's
recommendations on this point
and be liberal with the clerks.

A certain man who resides in a
neighboring city naa trounie witn a
mouse recently. The little rodent had
gnawed his way into the bath room and
was using that apartment for his
daily frolics. As a consequence the
man's wife and daughters were afraid
to use the room.
Means of extermination, such as
traps and poison were brought into
play, but the mouse could not see them
at all. Eventually, growing tired of
hearing the complaints that the women
folks were making, the man of the
house went Into the bath room and laid
for the little beast. The animal put
In appearance and was landed into th
bath tub, which served as a prison un

A NEW SLEEPING CAR STORY.

yesterday was A. F. Miller, egneral
passenger agent of the Chicago, Mil
waukee & St. Paul railway. He visit
ed all of the general offices in town and
at the Hollenden Hotel yesterday told a
story of one of the sleeping car porters
who was recently found asleep while
on duty. This is contrary to the rules
of the St. Paul road, and the negro man
was in trouble when found by the in
specter on the Pioneer Limited. He
had his wits about him, however, and
in response to the inspector's inquiry
as to what he was doing asleep, he
said:
"I'll
tell
you

how It was, boss,
with the company z
before coming here '.
such and such a rail
was so rough that
short time and
was working on

could not get any sleep. Since I have
been working for the St. Paul the road
has been so smooth that I just could
not keep awake."

of Caruso, the tenor, raised his hands
high above his head as he pushed his
way through the crowd.
"No one shall accuse me," he shouted,
with his hands In the air.
The crowd laughed and McCardell
was pleased.
When he reached his car he dis
covered that his watch, his week's
salary and everything else of value he
ad In his pocket had been stolen.

WHALING AS A MODERN BUSINESS.
Whaling is a small enterprise com
pared with the great industry of long
ago. The old lure oil is scarcely
thought of today, the vegetable world
having so completely supplanted the
leviafhan in the arts. The bone's the
thing. It has never been higher in
price, some $6.50 a pound today, and
a "right" whale will average more than
25,000 pounds of bone. Two whales
will yield a ship dividend; live are the
average catch. It costs about $15,000
including advances to the personnel,
later deducted from their catch per
centage, to outilt a ship for a summer
in the Arctic. Often the catch is worth
$120,000, of which about $25,000 goes
to the skipper. There s money in
whaling, often more than in mining
and salmon canning, the north admits,
and so even greater lawlessness ex
ists than in those pursuits. lAirper's

TAPEWORM IX RABBITS.
Rushvllle, Ind., Dec. 4. Several hunt
ers have reported finding tapeworms in
rabbits killed in this county. Hugo
Schmalzel, In preparing a rabbit, found
a tapeworm measuring more than thir
ty feet in length. John Powers and
Frank T. Lawrence also found worms
measuring more than twenty foet.
A member or the local board of
health has warned people to be careful
in eating rabbits, declaring that they
are unhealthy, and should be eaten
only after a most careful examination
has been made.
CPIDER BOUND ITS CAPTIVE.
Had Fly
Safely Tied Up
tacking It.
Before At-
"One morning, when busy In my
workshop," says a naturalist, "a large
fly, double the size of a bluebottle,
was caught in a spider's web in the
window close to where I was at work.
It was held by two of its legs only,
and for some time the spider, which
was about the size of the fly's head,
proceeded to strengthen its hold by
attaching numerous extra lines to the
two captive limbs, carefully keeping
out of reach of the others, which were
letting out in all directions in frantic
efforts to escape.
"During a short respite in the cap
tive's struggles the spider cautiously
approached, and with its hind legs
got several turns of its tiny rope
round one of the limbs that were free.
These tactics were carried on till all
the legs were firmly bound. It then
injected poison into one of the legs.
This soon showed itself, for its dead
ening effects reduced the victim's
struggles in a marked degree. The
poison paralyzes but does not kill.
"Shortly after a second bite resist
ance ceased, and the victor settled
down to suck the juices of its fallen
prey. The struggles lasted quite an
hour. Next morning the fly was alive,
and the spider was still sucking out
its life blood."
Strenuous Treatment of Children.
A Milwaukee physician, Dr. John E,
Worden, has adopted this strenuous
treatment to prepare his babies for
the rigors of life, and up to the pres
ent his methods have been abundantly
justified by their success, says an ar
tide in Good Health for October. His
little daughters, Shirley and Jane,
aged respectively eight and three
years, are two of the firmest and
healthiest bits of humanity, to whom
disease of all kinds is unknown. Dur
ing the cold weather these children
mav be seen barefooted and bare
headed, clad only in their cotton gar
rnents, thoroughly enjoying the romp
in the snowdrifts, and without a goose
pimple on their skin.

"this turkey is unusually tough. May

"Certainly," returned Mrs. Grouch,
sweetly. "I purchased it at a station

from the butcher-shop?"
"No, Indeed," replied Mr. Grouch,

hard flesh of the bird. "I have been

NEW YORK LETTER
I
New York, Dec. 5. With call loan
rates ruling as high as 3o per cent.
the stock market started feverish and
lower. The high rates for money dur
ing the past ten days, causes a hesi
tancy on the part of bull operators to
make much of bullish demonstrations.
The tendency of the entire market
was reactionary in tone. , St. Paul sold
off from 182 down to ISO1-'.; I'nion
Pacific from 1ST to 1S5SS; Sugar from
137 to 135-4. and Copper from 113;
to 118. The selling in all of the
active stocks was on a liberal scale.
i large portion of it was ascribed to
bear operators, who will be compelled
to cover on any ease in the money
market.
New York Central again demonstrat
ed itself as a leader in the market,
opening around 136, a point higher
than last night's close, and continued
firm, notwithstanding the general
weakness in the balance of the mar
ket. The directors in this company
meet in the near future. It is the
ruling comment in the street that the
dividend rate will be increased to at
ast 6 per cent. If the directors take
such action the advance of ten points
In the past week has discounted in a
measure this bullish factor.
Two of the strongest features of tho
day were Reading and Colorado Fuel,
both of which scored advances of about
two points after an earlv decline.
Tho market closed Irregular and
spotty, with indications for a feverish
market tomorrow.

CHICAGO LETTER.
Chlcasro, Tec. 5. Wheat Dull sn1
unlnterestlner market after the little
excitement of yesterday. Prices, how
ever, had a hardening tendency. The
stock of contract what here decreased
somewhat. This Induced quito a little
buying by shorts. Reports from the
Argentine Republic were unfavorable,
hail storms being reported. The
strength in both Minneapolis and Du
!uth also were bullish factors. The
buying of the December option was one
of the features of the day. One large
elevator concern boucrht over a million
bushels, presumably covering short con
tracts. The market eloped steady with
very little change from yesterday. .
Corn Trade In the corn market was
very dull, prices were a little firmer on
the wet weather throughout the west,
put the trade entirely in hands of pro
fessionals. Cash sales to exporters
were small, being only 40,000 bushels.
The market closed steady to firm.
Oats A little buying In the May
option was the feature of the day. Al
though the fluctuations were not wide,
the undertone of the market continues
firm. Cash demana excellent. Cash
sales to exporters 125.000 bushels.
The market closed tteady.
SOUTH WATER STREET MARKET.
Caieago. Dec. 5. The butter mar
ket displayed considerable activity and
strength at the recently advanced
prices. The consumptive demand is
taking care of all the fresh arrivals
and of late the under grades are be
K.nning to move more freely, acting
as a substitute for the better grades
owing to the high prices prevailing
for the latter. Supplies of fresh eggs
are light and the demand is sufficient
to take them orf the market.

CLAY EQUAL TO EMERGENCY.
How
"Great Commoner" Satlsf.ed
Disgruntled Constituent.
One of the best stories told of Hen
ry Clay relates to his dealing with
an old Kentucky mountaineer who ac
costed tho "great commoner" after
one of his spoeche3 and said: "Well,
Henry, I have always voted for you
before, but I can't do it this tino.'
"Why, now, what's tho trouble?" ask
ed Clay. "I don't like your vote on
tho bank till," replied Tom. "Id tfiat
all; I have suited you generally, havo
I not?" "Oh. yes. always but that time,
but I don't like that vote." "You
think I was honest in giving it, don't
you?" "Yes, but you mado a mistake
"Say, Tom, you are a hunter, and
sometimes your gun misses fire; what
do you do then throw it away." "No,
I just pick the flint and try It
again." "Of course you do, Tom, and
all I ask of you ia to treat mo aa well
as you do your old gun. Will you not
do it?" "Yes, by thunder, Henry, I
will! I'll try you again."
DOG PROVED ITSELF HERO.
Gave Up
Life In Attempt
Runaway Team.
to Stop
Near Pltteford a dog was killed in
a determined and intelligent effort to
stop a runaway team. Conrad Hoo
nick, a farmer, left his team standing
near a railroad track. Two little
boys were In the wagon. Tho horses
wero frightened by a passing train
and ran away with the lads. Ono of
the boys was thrown out and severely
injured. The other remained In tho
wagon, and while the speed of tho
frightened team increased every sec
ond he made frantic efforts to reach
the lines and stop them.
As tho horses passed Frank Tous
ley's place the latter's dog, which car
ried tho mail and did many littlo
tasks about the farm and had almost
human Intelligence, ran out, and
seeing the predicament of the boy,
attempted to catch hold of tho dang
ling lines. Like a human being tho
animal, without a sound, ranged him
self Into lino to seize the reins, and,
in his anxiety to do bo, was struck by
the wheel and instantly killed. Tho
boy managed to get hold of ono rein,
and with it he turned the horses and
stopped them. Warren Mirror.
What Makes the Heart Weak.
Two important causes of heart
trouble aro underwork and overwork,
but chiefly underwork, says Outing.
Where due to overwork it has been
physical, not mental. The hearts of
long-dlstanco runners and bicyclists
sometimes become hypertrophled,
while hearts of children sometimes
succumb to too arduous play. With
children, however, it is usually due to
a predisposition In that direction from
their parents, whoso hearts have been
weakened by prolonged under exercise
rather than to overexerciso on their
part.
As the result of a recent examina
tion of nearly 10,000 school children In
the primary grades by tho board of
health, it was found that 50 per cent
were suffering from physical defects,
among which predominated defectivo
vision, insufficient nutrition, pulmon
ary and heart ailments a startling
condition of our boasted civilization.
Uniforms of Chinese Students. "
The establishment of government
schools in China and the equipment
of students In uniforms Is furnishing
a market for military clothing.
According to tho British consul al
Wuchow, 60 of these schools hava
been opened In that prefecture alone.
The uniform consists of a coat anJ
trousers of foreign cut, with bras
buttons and peak caps, and shoes oi
foreign patern.
In the strictly military school
khaki is worn. All tho uniforms seeq
appear to bo of British cloth, but
there is a rule, which is evidently lg
nored, that only native material be
used. Caps, buttons and braid all
come from Japan.
The shoes are said to be of IIong
kong manufacture, but a very Inferior
kind is made locally of native leatheiw
Stunner for ths Manager.
When Manager Henderson was la
possession of a certain metropolitan
theater a would-be patron, obviously
well bred, but rather too well primed
by stimulant, called at the box office
and demanded an orchestra seaL Hi3
wish was regretfully declined. But
he wanted a more precise reason,
which was not forthcoming, and at
last Manager Henderson wa3 sum
moned. Pressed for the reason of hia
refusal, the latter finally said: "Well,
if you must know, it is because you
aro drunk 1" Unabashed, the visitor
replied: "Why, of course I'm drunk t
D'ye think I'd hie come to your
hie blessed theater it I wasn't
drunk?"
Athlete's Odd Mishap.
A Brooklyn athlete, who has beea
successfully looping tho loop on a
bicycl for several years and wha
never sustained tho slightest acci
dent, nearly broke his neck whila
wheeling his baby In tho perambula
tor. He slipped on a banana peeling
on the sidewalk ia front of his nome.
