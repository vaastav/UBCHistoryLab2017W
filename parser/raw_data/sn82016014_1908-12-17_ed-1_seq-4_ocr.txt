OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.
The State Journal is member of the
Associated Press and receives the full dsy
teleirraph report of that (Treat news or
ganization for the exclusive afternoon
publication In Topeka.
The news Is received In The State Jour
nal building over wires for this sole pur
rv. Tt is not yet too late to do Christmas
hopping early but It soon will be.
A real brave individual can get a
good realization of trie meaning of
the phrase-"mingllng with the masses"
by making a tour these days of the
places where Christmas gifts are on
eale.
Some special order will have to be
created for the benefit of Joseph
Pulitzer, editor of the New York
World. His recent castigation at the
hands of President Roosevelt elevates
him to a place far and beyond the
National Ananias club. He's in a
class all by himself in the presidential
mind.
Many United States senators are
credited with having laughed during
the reading of the most recent mes
sage -from President Roosevelt on the
Brownsville affair. That's the way
with some folks. When ' they get a
solar plexus Jolt they endeavor to hide
their distress by simulating merri
ment. - -l
The yield of the farms of the United
States for the past year is placed at
$7,778,000,000, a staggering figure to
say the least. They furnish particu
larly substantial food for the assimila
tion of the pessimists who prate that
this country can enjoy anything but
posperity. Surely is the United States
most favored among the nations of the
world.
Rumors are afloat in Germany that
Kaiser Wilhelm is threatened with
softening of the brain. What's the
matter with old "lese majeste" aver
there these days? In times passed
the circulators of such a rumor would
have been huddled into jail in short
order. And now not a. hand is raised
against them. Verily',' the times do
change.
John D. Archbold must be paving
the way for an Increase In the price
of the oil which is marketed by the
Ftandard Oil company, At the hear
ing concerning the affairs of this cor
poration which Is still beingcontlnued
In New Tork he took occasion recently
to proffer the Information that the
supply of oil in the United States Is
decreasing.
President Roosevelt, it is said, has
not saved up any money from his sal
ary during his two presidential terms.
Well, with the prospect of his getting
2 a word for all he cares to write
about his African hunt and a Job as
associate editor of The Outlook at a
alary of $30,000 a year, there ha
eurely been no need for him to skimp
himself and lay up a bit for a rainy
day.
One thing which may be of value
to the city councllmen themselves
was accomplished at the recent meet
ing of these gentlemen which was at
tended by their wives. It demon
strated to the women the reason why
their husbands are out so late on the
nights when the municipal assembly
gathers. The event ' was probably
, notable In another respect. The coun
cllmen had a chance to do some talk
ing In the presence of their better
' halves.
A local sporting authority estimates
.that between thirty and thirty-five
thousand quail were killed in Shaw
nee county during the season which
ended at midnight on Tuesday. This
la on the theory that every one of the
three thousand persons who took out
a hunter's license In this county killed
ten or more quail each. This theory
may be set down as being a trifle
fanciful. From the bags brought
home by any number of men who
went out after quail It was evident
that they had to content themselves
with a rabbit or two.
Who is the champion runner of the
world at the Marathon distance?
This is now a perplexing question.
Hayes, the American, won this
original classic at the Olympic 'games
last summer in London. Dorando,
the Italian, who was beaten for the
honor on this occasion came to New
York and in a repetition of the race
defeated Hayes. Now, Tom Long
boat, the Indian and a native of
America, has beaten Dorando. Long
boat was In the Olympic Marathon
and was defeated by Hayes and
Torando. Thua is the situation mud
dled. Why not have a race between
Dorando, Longboat and Hayes?
The guns on the forts along . the
Venezuelan coast are evidently as use
less as were those of Spain around
the harbor of Manila. The Dutch
Srarablpa appear to . experience no
difficulty in sailing right up under
their noses and copping out a Castro
man of war. As a matter of fact the
naval engagements between Holland
and Venezuela so far would lead one
to believe that the fighting ships of
both nations are not men of war but
ladies of war. Certainly nothing
more ladylike has ever happened In
the history of naval engagements than
the recent encounters between the
vessels flying the Dutch and
Venezuelan flags.
' THE PANAMA FUSS. - w
"Who got the money?" This has
been a pertinent question for some
time with certain newspapers con
cerning the $40,000,000 which the
United States paid for the effects of
the Panama canal company and its
possessions on the Isthmus of Pana
ma. The allegations have been made
that a considerable portion of this
fund filtered back to prominent Amer
icans who were admitted to the inside
of the deal. The matter has been re
sponsible for a few fiery letters to in
dividuals and messages to congress
from the president of the nation and
from the last one he has seen fit to
send in it is quite evident that the
question "Who got the money?" is a
trifle more impertinent than anything
else.
That some of this money found its
way back to America through banks
which held Panama securities is a
fact but this sum in its aggregate is so
small that it is hardly worth bother
ing about. Anyhow, there can be no
scandal attached to its receipt by
these banks, nor does there appear to
be slightest chance that there is any
kind of a scandal mixed up in the
whole transaction. Certain it is that
rro American gentlemen as individuals,
as has been alleged, profited greatly,
or even to a small extent by the deal
unless it is William Nelson Cromwell,
the attorney who attended to all the
negotiations for it. He received a fee
of $220,000 for his work but this was
passed upon as being a fair one by
the French courts. As a friend of the
administration put it in the favorite
words of Mr. Roosevelt, the entire
transaction was "as clean as a hound's
tooth."
A resolution is pending In congress
for the appointment of a special com
mittee to investigate this "Panama
scandal" and the introducer of it In
sists that he is going to press its con
sideration regardless of the last mes
sage from Mr. Roosevelt on the sub
ject which shows exactly where the
$40,000,000 went. It would seem to be
folly to go ahead with such an in
vestigation when it is apparent that
none is needed. There can be only one
point now. There is but one question
that might be disturbing. Did the
United States pay more for the canal
rights and properties than they were
worth? If so, it was cheated, of course.
But an. investigation which, might de
velop this fact would be of little value.
The bargain has been made and-settled
for some time and any determin
ation that the government had been
buncoed would avail nothing except to
make the people feel a trifle sore that
the -government officials who looked
after the transaction were of the "easy
mark" variety. But there really does
not appear to be any evidence that the
United States made a bad bargain in
this deal. The mere privilege of build
ing the canal on the territory travers
ed by it ought to be worth $40,000,000.
CORPORATE SUPERVISION.
Suggestions have been made repeated
ly in the various messages of President
Roosevelt for the regulation through
supervision by the federal government
of all corporations doing an interstate
business. In his last regular message
he argued strongly that regulations of
this sort were not a usurpation of
state authority by the national govern
ment and that corporations with ex
tensive business ramifications could
only be handled with efficacy by the
federal government.
A most Important measure along
these lines has been introduced in the
senate recently by Senator Charles
Curtis of this state. Whether this bill
meets with the approval of President
Roosevelt and the administration is not
known but it is certainly stringent
enough in Its many provisions to de
ntand the approval of the most radical
ly inclined on this proposition. Briefly,
it proposes that every corporation, com
pany, or association organized in one
state shall not be permitted to do busi
ness in any other portion of the Uni
ted States until it has taken out a fed
eral charter which will place its af
fairs under the direct supervision of
the department of commerce and labor.
All corporations, companies, or as
sociations which do a particle of Inter
state business are required under its
terms to file applications for a permit
to do business with the secretary of
commerce and labor wlfo shall pass
upon its eligibility to engage in busi
ness and thereupon issue or deny it a
permit to do so.
Applications for these permits must
be accompanied with the articles of
agreement of the corporation or com
pany, a full statement of the business
intended to be carried on and the ob
jects of the organization. Companies
organizing under the act and offering
shares of stock for sale must give full
particulars as to the amount of stock
sold, the price received, the amount in
tended to be sold, the price asked, the
cost of the organization, the buildings
owned or Intended to be erected, the
improvements to be made and all oth
er matters connected with Its business.
If any statements of this sort contain
false representations the promoters or
agents shall be liable to a minimum
fine of $100 and a jail sentence of 30
days for each offense. They shall also
be liable to subscribers of stock for
damages and loss sustained by them
through false representation. If the
full amount to the stock reauired bv
the company to do business is not sold j
and the purchase price "aid in 0 days,
then all moneys received from pur
chase of stock shall be returned. Lists
of the stockholders are to be filed
with the secretary of commerce and
labor as well as a list of the officers
and all persons employed by the com
pany and the amount of salary paid
to each of them.
To the secretary of commerce " and
labor is given the privilege of causing
an examination of the books of any, or
ganization doing business under the act
at any time. The voting powers of
stockholders is fixed, each shareholder
up to ten shares having one vote, an
additional vote for every three shares
beyond the first ten and up to a hun
dred and an additional , vote for every
25 shares beyond the first 100. The
holders of one-tenth of the capital
stock have a right to call a special
meeting of the stockholders at any time.
Any corporation, company or organiza
tion attempting to do an interstate bus
iness without securing the federal per
mit as provided shall be guilty of a
felony and upon conviction punishable
by a fine of not, less than $10,000. Any
officer who shall attempt to conceal the
actual condition of a company Is liable
to from $1,000 to $10,000 fine and im
prisonment for a period of not less
than 30 days or more than a year. Com
panies must make annual reports and
any failure on the part of any of them
to comply with the various provisions
of the act shall forfeit Its charter.
Stock "watering" Is specificallv prohib
ited and any officers or stockholder or
agent who shall aid in the violation of
this provision is liable to a fine of not
less than $1,000 and imprisonment of
not less than 30 or more than 90 days
This detailing of the provisions of
the measure is sufficient to show Its
great scope. Some such legislation is
doubtless needed to cope with the large
corporations of the country which have
developed into trusts but it would seem
that it would work considerable and
unnecessary hardship" on smaller cor
porations, companies that do not care
to be dignified by that title and other
business organizations whose interstate
business Is not exceedingly extensive.
Still it would be hard to tell where to
draw the line If the federal government
Is to indulge in supervision over cor
porations doing an interstate business.

He is now on the road traveling for a

A man was killed in Coolidge re

the morbidly curious swarmed to the
place where the body lay, to look at
It. "He has a widow and five chil

if these morbidly curious really care so
much to see a dead man, they will be
willing to pay for it." So he charged
10 cents each to all who stood at the
door and looked In; 25 cents a head to
all who stood near the body, and 35
cents to all who touched it. In the
twelve hours the body lay waiting the
coroner, he took in enough to pay the
deceased's funeral expenses. Coolidge
is not so slow in this great race across
the reform field, after all.

things, but there was an Emporia
about 2,500 years ago, and it would
not be in good taste to claim the in
vention of that name. The semi-barbarous
people who Inhabited that part
of Gaul which Is now Marseilles and
vicinity, five or six centuries before the
Christian era, were of a bold and en
terprising nature, so they extended
their trade as far as the coast of Spain,
and established several towns, one of
them called -Emporlae, and it sur
vives to this day in Cataloina, bearing
the corrupted name Ampurias. There
is also a town named Emporia In
Greensville county, Virginia."

KANSAS COMMENT
THE FRANKING PRIVILEGE.
The annual report of the postmas
ter general tells of a deficit in the post
office department of about $17,000,000.
The expenditures of the year were $208,
000,000, the receipts $191,000,000. For the
fiscal year ending with July next a like
deficit is expected.
The third assistant postmaster gen
eral, in his annual report, shows that
departmental penalty matter and that
sent under congressional frank cost the
government over $12,544,000. At first
thought that outlay seems enormous,
particularly when it Is compared with
the statement of total receipts and ex
penditures of the postofflce department.
The franking privilege has been criti
cised freely ever since it came into use.
It Is often the case that questionable
use of it by members of congress has
aroused fresh opposition. It is start
ling, at least, to find an outlay for free
transmission through the United States
mails aggregating an amount equal to
more than one-fifth of the total ex
penditures of the postofflce department.
It might be a good thing if some in
quiry were made to discover what
abuses, if any, exist.
The report on franked mail is ac
companied by a statement of outlay of
$57,000,000 for uncompensated service in
the handling and transporting of second
class matter of publishers of newspa
pers and periodicals. The rate on such
matter Is low because it Is counted of
distinct value to the people. The same
thing is true of tons of mail sent out
from Washington. The distribution
through the department of agriculture
for example, must be heavy. But the
educational value to the country at
large of the reports and documents
given wide circulation Is undoubted.
The probability is that the investi
gation of abuses would yield little.
There may be some congressmen who
use the frank too freely. But the larg
er part of the outlays, considered from
the standpoint of the diffusion or know
ledge among the people, would be re
garded as desirable- Hutchinson News.

EQUALIZATION OF OPPORTUNITY.
A proposition will come before the
incoming Kansas legislature to author
ize the superintendent of public In
struction and the state school fund
commissioners to aid country school
districts which are themselves too poor
to maintain Instruction for more than
three or four months in the year. We
do not know, definitely, what the plan
is, but on general principles we hope
that some such action will be taken.

or diminish its influence in the nation.

Kansas does not owe one of her chil

She cannot, in "Justice, give one child
a seven months school term and an
other a three months' term. She must
give them equal opportunity in all

than another 'the state should equalize
the-m from the school fund, which is
now, and has beeri,,tor years, teeming
with prosperity Tbie is how the equal

A WORD FOR THE MEN.
A Paris woman has confided to a
friend that she has never had cause to
distrust a dog and-, she has found all
men gay deceivers. The woman is
wrong. There are Just as many men
who ring true as there are dogs. In
fact dogs are lovable creatures but they
are not very reliable. There are mighty
few of them who will not steal. There
are fewer still who will not take up with
a new master and love him in a month
Just as dearly as they loved the old. We
are growing to overestimate the affec
tions of dogs. Lawrence Journal.
FROM OTHER PENS
INDIANS AND CIVILIZATION.
It is only within the last few decades
that a considerable . proportion of the
Indians in North America have become
civilized. Progress in the direction of
teaching the remaining unreconstruct
ed aborigines to exchange the blanket
for the less picturesque garments of
the paleface and to give up the wig
wam of canvas or skins for the tight
built cottage, and the freedom of the
trail for habits of industry and thrift
has been encouraging recently. We
have begun civilizing a body of red
men. if the government figures of a few
years ago are correct, little smaller or
no smaller- than the number that
roamed the forests in scattered bands
when the first white settlers greatly
overestimated the population ot North
America. Throughout the four cen
turies of warfare and the gradual re
duction of the Indian to the condition
of a reservation resident of what wa3
formerly his continent, the race dis
played virility unequaled in the history
of any conquered people. A curiously
tragical "passing of the Indian" will be
chronicled if it develops that civiliza
tion is to prove deadlier to him than
four centuries of relentless war waged
by white races making common cause
against him for the acquirement of
territory. Louisville Courier-Journal.
CARELESSNESS EXEMPLIFIED.
Every year the dead-letter office In
Washington holds a sale of articles
that have been misdirected and which
bear no clue to the sender. This year
the number of packages to be disposed
of thus to the highest bidder Is 87.844.
Allowing a wide margin for those that
might have been originally addressed
correctly, but which failed to reach the
addressee before he had moved to some
other address, let us say that 8,000 per
sons misdirected packages during the
last year. And please remember that
this does not include the misdirected
parcels which bear a return card and
which go back to the sender. Isn't
that a monument, and a pretty big one,
to our carelessness?
The postofflce department is a good
deal of a scapegoat. It is obliged to
bear many burdens that do not belong
to it, and for which the haste and lack
of foresight of the general public are
responsible. It takes the brunt of thou
sands of false accusations and crimina
tions, but it has its day at the annual
sale. The sale of mlssent packages
will always be an incriminating ar
raignment of the public's heedlessness
and neglect of its own interests. Since
we are all so fallible, let us not kick
about the fallibility of the postofflce,
but endeavor to employ more care in
our own affairs. Pittsburg Post.

Inventor or Shirt Waist.
Josef a Osborn is dead, and if the
women of the nation, of the whole
world for the matter of that, only
knew their unpayable indebtedness to
her they would wear mourning bands
on their arms for thirty days and get
extra allowances from their husbands
and fathers and brothers to raise a
glorious monument over her bones.
All the women's clubs, too, from
ZanesyilJe to Zanzibar would drape
their halls and put suitable resolutions
of their great loss on their minutes.
Mrs. Osborn invented the feminine
.shirt waist.
According to the consensus of femi
nine opinion no single article of femi
nine wear and feminine decoration has
ever equaled the shirt waist. It is at
once the most comfortable, the most
becoming, and the most adaptable
article in my lady's wardrobe. It is
capable of being drawn out to any ex
tent like an accordion. It is formal
and It's informal, and everything that
lies between. It is suitable for any
thing from a seance with the cooking

xls genesis was simple. Mrs. Osborn
saw her husband's soft shirts and en
vied them. Fr,om that, as one who
has a surface knowledge of the sex
will testify, it was but a step to an
nexation. Mrs. Osborn went to the
man who supplied her husband and
told him that she wished a half
dozen shirts built on the regulation
masculine working plans save slight
ui.cLsciitica nere ana mere ana witn
a decided curtailment in their length.
He demurred; she insisted, and she
won.
She wore them herself: she gave
them to her patrons, for she was the
most famous dressmaker In New York,
and from them sprung the millions of
shirt waists that have covered and
made attractive the vwomen of the
world.
Mrs. Osborn was a wonderful wo
man in many ways. With no experi
ence and only the necessity for action
to inspire her, she left the ranks of
New York's Four Hundred and with
only $3,600 to start with built up a
business that took an entire building,
employed- 850 persons, and enabled
her to leave an estate of fullv half a
million.
This was her material reward, but
the shirt waist, to shift it from its
proper place for a moment, was her
crown of glory. Cleveland Leader.
Kept Busy Dodging Death.
So busy is Jerry Byrnes bf River
head. Long Island, in escaping death
that he has little time to do anything
else. If anything is sent flying through
the air It seems to be the rule that
it keeps right on until it fiuds the
Byrnes boy and hits him. Last year it
was a lS-pound shot, this year it is
a pistol bullet. Between times he has
been struck so many times that he
dodges instinctively even when a spar
row or a pigeon files in his direction.
To demonstrate to what lengths
projectiles will go in an effort to reach
young Byrnes, it Is only necessary to
mention the circumstances leading up
to his latest mishap. Frank Hunter,
employed in Nugents' livery stable,
has -a pistol. He was trying to sell it
yesterday. The prospective purchaser
wanted to see It tried before he
bought it. Hunter cocked the weapon,
aimed it in the air, and pulled the
trigger. The bullet struck the side of
a small office building near the stable,
passed through the weatherboarding,
bored a hole through a 2-inch stud
ding, and struck young Byrnes in the
forehead. Deflected by the bone, the
bullet passed between the skull and
the scalp and finally stopped in the
back part of the head. Hunter was
arrested, but was discharged by Justice
of the Peace Hildreth.
In April, 1907, a classmate of young
Byrnes was putting a 16-pound shot.
It struck Byrnes on the back of the
head and caved in his skull. The
pressure on the brain was' relieved by
Dr. Paul Pilcher of Brooklyn, who re
moved part of the skull. Byrnes could
not talk and his recovery was slow.
He was just emerging from his period
of dumbness when Hunter's bullet
struck him. New York Press.
Numbering: the Presidents.
Will William H. Taft be the twenty
sixth or twenty-seventh president of
the United States? is a question inter
esting to some idle minds, as it has
every time a new president has been
elected since the administration of
Benjamin Harrison. Cleveland at his
first election was the twenty-second
president. All are agreed as to this.
Was he the twenty-fourth president on
his second election, after an interval
of one term? If so, then Mr. Taft will
be the twenty-seventh president; if
not, then he will be the twenty-sixth.
But if George Washington was the
first president, even through his sec
ond term, why should Mr. Cleveland be
the twenty-fourth president in his sec
ond term when he was the twenty
second president In his first term? Let
the idle ones pass on to some other
equally harmless post-electon subject.
Mr. Taft will be the twenty-sixth
president. Springfield Republican.

THE EVENING STORY
Covell's Joke.
(By William Morris, Jr.)
All Balmoral, with the exception of
Dan Betterley and his sister, thought
Col. CovelJ's joke a good one. Tne
Betterleys were excepted because the
Joke was on Dan, and the talk across
the bar of the Brindle Pup saloon was
hushed on those rare occasions when
Betterley favored the place with his
company. At other times men slap
ped eacn other on the nack and roared
as Covell detailed the progress of
events.
The joke had sprung from a care
less remark made by Rob Henders
when Julie Betterley had refused to
marry Howard Wetton on the grounds
that she did not want to leave Dan
alone to keep house in bachelor dis
comfort. "Some one would do Wetton a per
sonal favor by marrying off Dan,"
suggested Henders, and the rest of the
crowd shouted with delight at the idea
of the silent Benjamin marrying.
"But he wouldn't know how to ask
a girl," suggested Col. Covell. "Some
one would have to pop the question
for him. By John Rogers," he added,
"I think I'll do it for him! I've a maid
en aunt back East who's been crazy
to get married for more years than
I've lived. Her name's Adora Ded
rick, and she must be about sixty now.
"She's got a little money and she
may think that he's marrying her for
that, but she'll take him. We'll carry
along the game until we ve proposed
for him, and then we'll let Dan get the
answer,- or else we'll bring the old lady
on and let him fight it out with her."
""That would be great," declared
Henders, approvingly. "Let her walk
right up to him and put her arms
around his neck and say 'Darling!' I'll
bet that will scare him Into talking."
"I'll be one to help pay the old
lady's traveling expenses on this here
excursion,' broke in Denver Bill, who
dealt bank. "What will It cost?"
" "Say $400,' suggested Covell as he
took off his hat and threw in $20
In a few minutes more than the need
ed sum had been realized, and call
ing for pens and paper Covell wrote
the first letter, while the rest of the
crowd looked on..
Betterley was not disliked in Bal
moral, but his taciturn ways and his
refusal to make one of the crowd that
nightly thronged the Brindle Pup
marked him a man apart , from the
rest.. Hence the crowd was willing to
pay. for the pleasure of seeing his
amazement when his undesirable
bride-elect should appear.
Unmindful -of all postal regulations,
the postmaster agreed to let Covell
have the letters addressed to Dan Bet
terley, should any come from the little
New England town where Miss Adora
Dedrick lived. Presently it came,- a
heavy letter in which Miss Dedrick ex
pressed a willingness to correspond
with a man so well recommended by
Cousin Covell. - ..: - .-- - . .
"I guess she's forgotten you. Col,"
suggested Henders when this line was
reached, but Covell merely grinned
appreciatively and continued to read.
There was little to laugh at in the
letter; indeed more than one in the
crowd wished there was some one
back east who would write letters like
that to him, but Covell's vivid descrlp
lon of Miss Dedrick's overripe charms,
and the thought of what Dan would
say when she arrived kept the joke
alive during the correspondence that
followed. Finally when Miss Dedrick
wrote that she was sending her pic
ture, and the accompanying photo
graph proved to be that of a comely
girl. scarcely, out of her teens. Covell
rolled on the floor in his delight.
"Cousin Adora was that old before
they knew how to take pictures," he
insisted. "She must have begged this
of a photographer. I think that it's
time to spring the joke now. We'll
send her the money to come on with
and ask her to start at once. Dan will
see this picture, and wnen Cousin
Adora comes reckon he'll be some
surprised."
Covell laboriously indited 'a lengthy
letter, in which he declared Dan's in
ability to wait longer for his bride and
begging her to come West at once.
A few days later a telegram tele
phoned from the railroad town to
camp announced her start, and when
they had learned the sense of the mes
sage the plotters allowed it to be de
livered, while at the same time Miss
Adora's last letter and her picture, in
closed in the original letter, were plac
ed back in the postoffice and delivered
to Dan that evening.
The Brindle Pup kept open until
4 o'clock in the morning that the ear
liest news might be learned, but Dan
gave no sign that he was disturbed. A
scout reported that his shack was in
darkness,
"I don't think I'd lose sleep my
self," admitted Henders with regret.
"I suppose It took him rather sudden
that some one's done his courting for
him, but he's willing to make good
for his unknown friend with the orig
inal of that photograph."
"Wait until he sees what he draws,"
reminded Covell. "He'll go some shy
of sleep when Cousin Adora gets after
him with all those letters. She'll never
believe that he didn't write them."
The thought cheered the disappoint
ed ones, and even when Dan went
quietly to his claim on the morrow
and did not even ask the postmaster
about the letter, they chuckled as they
thought of the awakening that was in
store for him.
Every man In the camp was on
hand when the stage came over from
Buxton three days later.
Far down the trail the driver waved
his hat three times as a signal that
the bride had arrived, and they were
all lined up about the front of the
hotel where they could watch Ben
and his sister without being so near
that he might suspect something.
There was a tense moment when
the veiled figure descended from the
interior of the stage, but a murmur
of disappointment followed when it
was seen that a heavy automobile veil
was impenetrable.
Dan came forward and the arrival
turned to him. He led her up to his
sister and the three climbed Into the
Betterley buckboard and were off to
Dan's shack before the camp fairly
realized that it was being robbed of its
fun.
"It's going to be curious when she
takes off that there veil," said Hen
ders with a sigh, "but it's darned mean
that we can't declare in on the deal.
I sort of feel that I've been cheated."
"Same here." chimed another voice,
and though Covell urged that there
still would be plenty of fun, he was
decidedly unpopular for the moment.
In an effort to change the humor of
the crowd he invited them over to the
Brindle Pup, and they were still hav
ing drinks at his expense when Dan
Betterley strode in and drew Covell
to one side.
"Look here," he said quietly, but
with a ring of determination in his
voice, "Dora has been asking for
Cousin Covell,' and I suppose that
means you. If it does, you are at the
bottom of this trick. I want to know
what it all means."
"It was a sort of Joke," explained
Covell, who did not appear to be
greatly enjoying 'the "Joke." "Some i
of the boys thought that you ought t
be married, eo's Julie could marry
Howard Wetton, and I remembered
that I had a cousin Adora back East
who's been wanting to be married for
the last fifty years, so I thought I'd
make the whole lot of -you happy
and
"And you did the writing," con
cluded Dan. "From what Dora saya
I gather that there were a number of
letters I never saw. I want them."
From the saloon safe Covell extract
the package of letters and silently
turned them over to Betterley.
"I suppose you know what the pun
ishment is for illegal use of tha
mails?" he asked, raising his volea.
"The first hint from any one that
reaches my wife's eara to the effect
that she was the victim of a damned
rotten practical Joke will bring a pos
tal inspector here who will see that
you get what's coming to you!"
"Your wife!" gasped Covell, "You
don't mean to say that you're going to
marry that mummy!"
"Doesn't the fact that you are still
alive argue that?" asked Betterley.
"The joke appears to be en you, Cov
ell. I fell in love with her photograph
just as Dora did with mine, and I was
content to make tha match you so
amiably planned."
"She looks like that photograph?"
asked Covell gaspingly.
"It doesn't half do her Justice," de
clared Betterley fondly. "The Adora
Dedrick you were correspond
ing with became Mrs. Henry
Sprague some ten years ago. This
Adora Dedrick. is her mece; her broth
er's child, named after her. She was
the only Miss Adora Dedrick, and she
received the letters. She wants to see
her cousin, and if you dare hint any
thing when you come up, I'll "
"Tou won't have to," said Covell
humbly. "I've acted like a hound pup
py. Dan. You needn't be afraid. I'm
only too glad the joke's switched."
"Same here," said Betterley. more
contentedly. "You fellows come up
tonight. There's going to be a dou
ble wedding, for now Julie can marry
Wetton. You're a. pretty good Joker,
colonel!"
"I ain't no joker," declared Covell
with more emphasis than grammar.
"I'm one of them pretty pink Cupids
that they have on valentines and I'm
rather good at the Job. too." (Copy
