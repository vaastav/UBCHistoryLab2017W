LOCAL AFFAIRS.
A good saving institution — The Bee Hive.
The best for the money is a maxim that
all maintain who have ever purchased goods
at Levis’. .
Furs. —Sable, Squirrel, Fitch, Astracan,
&c., at the Empire Store, Zion, as cheap
as can be had elsewhere.
Steel & Jackson, Port Deposit, have the
genuine Jouvin Kid Glove; and also the
La Bello Kid Glove, #1.25 a pair.
Christmas.— Only two weeks off. Already
Foud, at Zion, is preparing the good and
pretty things. Tho first callers get the
first choice.
Gentlemen attending Court, who want
cheap and lino Clothes, cut and made in
the best city fashion, should visit Janney,
in the Odd Fellows’ Hall.
The Bee Hire sells no goods on credit.
Its prices are too low.
A Valuable Farm.— Mr. S. R. Carson, of
Port Deposit, advertises a valuable farm at
public sale, on the 20th inst., located near
that town. This farm is one of the most
desirable in tho county.
Wilson, at the B. M. House, has a fine
assortment of Goods that ho is selling
cheaper than can be bought elsewhere. No
exceptions. It is with pleasure that Wilson
and his clerks show goods.
The Jury. —We are authorized by the
proper authority to state that petit jurors
need not attend Court till Tuesday morn
ing, at 9j o’clock, as the petit jury is never
wanted on the first day of Court.
Worth Knowing. —lt is a fact worth
knowing, that any book can be had at
Hinciilikke’s at publisher’s prices, and
any of the magazines may be hail, also, by
persons ordering and paying monthly.
Temperance.—The Lodge of Good Temp
lars, of Chesapeake City, propose holding
a meeting at that place, on Monday evening
next, 12th inst., at their lodge room, which
will be open to tho public at 8 o’clock.
The Elkton Star Led lire Course.—Mr.
George Vaudenhoff, will ojicn the course
on Tuesday evening, 20th inst., at the
Odd Fellows’ Hall. This celebrated reader
has no superior, and few, if any, equals in
his chosen line of eloquence.
Paris is besieged by an innumerable host
and will probably fall into the hands of the
Prussians. For some few weeks to come,
Ai .men's Jewelry Store will doubtless be
besieged by a great throng of customers,
and those beautiful watches, bracelets,
pencils, sleeve buttons, etc., and silver-plate
will fall into their hands.
The Singing Pilgrim.—Mr. Philip Phil
lips, the celebrated “Singing Pilgrim,”
whose fame has preceded his advent here,
will hold a Concert, on Monday evening
next, as has been previously advertised, in
the Odd Fellows’ Hall, in this town, for
the benefit of the Sabbath-School Union.
Mr. Phillips is so famed as a vocalist that
few, we apprehend, will let the opportunity
pass without hearing him exercise his won
derful powers in sacred song.
Any persons desiring a lock stitch sewing
machine, would do well to remember that
they can procure one equal to any other for
family use, of Benj. E. Lodore, who also
has for sale, the Grover & Baker elastic
stitch sewing machine, which is superior to
any other for family work. Mr. Lodore is
now prepared to deliver machines to cus
tomers at their residences on as favorable
terms as can be procured elsewhere. The
machines can be seen at his residence, in
Church street, Elkton. Orders by mail
promptly attented to. Any kind of sewing
machines repaired and adjusted by him.
Local Miscellany. —Mr. Morter, tenant
on the farm of tho late Dr. Cunnigham,
Grove Point, in Sassafras Neck, recently
lost two fine horses; and Mr. Hicks, who
runs a saw-mill on the same farm, lost two
horses and a mule. Cause supposed to be
feeding the stock on damaged corn.
Mr. Fischer, the celebrated singer, will
five a concert in the M. P. Church, at
lowlandsvillc, on Wednesday evening next.
W. J. Jones, Trustee, sold at public sale,
on Wednesday last, the farm of Ambrose
B. Owens, near Zion, containing 102 acres,
for $6,000. Henry P. Chandlee, purchaser.
The Elktou Building Society meets to
night.
Public Schools. —ln our statement last
week of school statistics, we gave $2,380.76
as the amount paid fur books to furnish
the schools for the last quarter. This was
an error and it should have read “receipts
on account of books,” composed of the
dollar fee which pupils are required to pay
" for admission to the schools. The Demo
crat more fortunate than ourselves, had a
•‘chile among them taking notes," among
which we find that the Board resolved to
raise the salary of the Secretary, Treasurer
and Examiner—all combined in one man—
to fifteen bundled dollars. This office
commenced with SBOO or S9OO, was raised
to SIOOO, and finally to the sum above
named. It ought to afford a residence at
tho county scat in future, for this impor
tant office; and will be quite an object
among politicians, who will soon begin to
show their teeth at each other, and thirst
like wolves for the present incumbent’s
blood. He will henceforth be required to
fight valliantly in the great Democratic
army, or be compelled to succumb to the
“claims” of some little whipper-snapper
whose Democratic record is unassailable as
his brains.
A New Church. —The grounds have been
laid out and Trustees appointed for build
ing a church on tho Nottingham road,
about four miles west of Elktou. Meet
ings of much interest have been hold for
sometime past at the house of Mrs. Ann
Boulden, by Mr. Charles S. Grant, of North
East, and the building of a church deter
mined on.
There is a considerable district lying
between the Nottingham road and the rail
road, commonly known as the Barrens,
that has never enjoyed much church privi
leges, and the location of a comfortable
house of worship in that neighborhood
may prove a groat blessing. It may be
objected on the ground that they will not
be able to pay a preacher, but there are
local preachers who will willingly gi- o their
services without pay, and there is a charm
and a force in such service, remindin'' us
of primitive times.- It is very pleasant
now-a-days to hear the religious services
closed, and be allowed to depart without
having their solemnity marred out by an
appeal for money, which has become so
common, and particularly on the Sabbath
day, when men in secular business suspend
their collections.
Courts. —The December term of the
Circuit Court will commence on Monday
next; and on Tuesday the Orphans’ Court
and County Commissioners will be in ses
sion.
A number of persons from all parts of
the county will visit Elkton next week,
and we hope many will avail themselves of
the opportunity to pay up for subscription
and other bills. Many of our subscribers
T’i url"* s considerably in arrears with
2 tie "b‘g, by deferring payment; and bills
insignificant, when paid annually, by being
a lowed to run u„ pa i tl , sweU to considera
ble amounts, making it a matter of some
inconvenient tomeel them oftimes.
*cHnHnn Ua T lo! * a groat deal on sub
i f?nouly contemplate mak
!?£ in advance,
the paper to stop when the time for which
it was paid has expired. Hundreds of our
best and most reliable subscribers have
taken The Whig years before it came into
our hands, and who have been in the habit
of paying their subscriptions when it was
convenient, at intervals,-long or short, as
the case might lie—but always pavimr
Deference alone to this class prevents us
from adopting the plan of invariable me
payment. We believe on the whole) it
would tie advantageous to them, for having
the money in advance, we could afford"
probably, to reduce the price of subscrip
tion somewhat, and by that means add to
our list of subscribers. There are doubt
less many who would prefer this mode to
the old custom. With such wo wvuld bo
glad to cuter into the arrangement.
Floaida.—Mr. IT. L. Headley, who lately
closed out his business at B. M. House
where he had for several years very suc
' ccssfully prosecuted carriage manufactur
ing, has gone to Florida to seek health in
that sunny clime and balmy atmosphere.
We received a note from him this week
i announcing the arrival of self and lady at
j Jacksonville, on the fot. John s River, after
one week’s travel by sea and land. Mr. H.
appears to bo well pleased with Florida and
gives his first impressions in the following
quotation which we publish from his letter:
“ The climate is deleghtful here, and
warm (December 3) as any September day
in Cecil. I’eas are yet in blossom. The
residents here are preparing to make gar
den again for early vegetables, which they
plant this month. Orange trees are now
tilled with ripe fruit which looks delicious
and tempting.”
We hope that Mr. Headley will remem
ber that a letter conveying the impressions
of a visitor from Cecil, of the climate, pro
ductions, etc., etc., of a region so interest
ing as Florida, will be perused with avidity
by the readers of The Whig, and that he
will devote a spare hour occasionally in
concocting a letter for our columns.
Land-Marks. —lt is a wise precaution for
every land owner to have all his boundaries
well and permanently fixed, as the neglect
to do so frequently causes ill-will and
wranglings among neighbors, where har
mony and kind feelings are so indispcnsible
to their happiness.
Boundaries may lie easily adjusted now,
that after a few years more, will become
difficult and hard to settle, as the evidence
of their former locations is gradually disap
pearing. There is not in general, much
difficulty in arriving at correct conclusions
in regard to the proper location of divisional
lines. The experienced surveyor on com
pairing the little papers and making a
trial, can generally adjust the lines to the
satisfaction of the parties, unless they be
very unreasonable.
Parents having land intended for their
children, may save them much trouble by
fixing permanent boundaries at every cor
ner—it is easily done now, it may bo much
more troublesome after awhile.
The Americans arc said to be a land
loving people, and there is no subject that
causes more bitterness of feeling, than con
troversies about land. Fix up your boun
daries in your life time, and do not leave it
for those who follow you.
Billing Twine, approved by Jacob Clay,
for sale at the Bee Hive.
A Prize Fight. —Elkton, on Tuesday
morning last, was the appointed rendezvous
for one of those beastly exhibitions called
prize lights, between two Philadelphia
bruisers. The principals came down on
the Monday evening 6 o’clock train, one
stopping off at Newark, Del., and the
other coming on to Klkton. The train
reaching Klkton at 1 j o’clock on Tuesday
morning brought the main body of roughs
who always accompany a prize light.—
Information had, however, preceded their
arrival and a party of police had been
telegraphed to Baltimore for, who,
under a Deputy Marshal reached Elkton by
the 9j train on Monday night, and who
being in readiness arrested all they could
lay hands on, who got out of the cars from
Philadelphia, using the depot as a jail
where they guarded the captured till morn
ing. Some, however, managed to escape,
among the number the referee. Those
who succeeded in eluding the police, pro
cured lodgings at safe places in the town,
the principal here being secreted by some
of the native fancy; and about daylight
the party started for Delaware, taking the
road over Red Hill. The ground had been
selected the day before, on the Maryland
side of the line, but the interference of the
Police caused the managers to shift their
position to the Delaware side, where the
coast appeared to be clear. The place
finally selected was on the farm of Mr.
Stephen Ott, who, though much opposed
to the brutal exhibition, was compelled to
witness the “sport” on his premises. The
ring was formed about midway between
Newark and Elkton, and the “engagement
took place ” between nine and ten o'clock.
Twenty-two rounds were fought, when a
foul blow was struck by one of the com
batants, which ended the fight in favor of
the one receiving the blow. Not ranch
damage was done to either of the roughs,
nor have we learned of any depredations
committed on citizens by the ruffians in
attendance, owing, doubtless, to the Police
having penned the majority of the worst
characters in the depot till morning, when
they were released, and who, like a thick of
frightened birds, which the hawk has been
among, scattered and made for home by the
first train ar.iving| after their release; hav
ing missed the fignt, and spent an uncom
fortable night in limbo. We heard of one
poor fellow, on his way home to North East
or Charlestown, who got out at Elkton,
and was immediately nabbed by the Police
and detained with the roughs till morning.
Being a stranger among them, they used
him badly, hustling him about and kicking
him around for amusement.
We hope Congress will pass a general
act fur the prevention and entire suppres
sion of this beastly sport.
Communicated.
Mb. EniTon: —In your comments upon
the School Board in your last issue you
intimate that its proceedings are kept
secret from the public, and that no facili
ties are afforded reporters to make them
public. I beg permission to ask if you or
any other member of the press have ever
been refused permission to hear and report
the proceedings of the School board?—
They do not sit with closed doors, and if
my memory is not at fault, you have on
several occasions had a seat at their table,
and free access to the minutes of the Sec
retary.
It is true the expense of school books
and stationery is enormous but I fail to
see how an increase in teachers salaries, as
you suggest is to remedy the evil. If
teaching is a mere bread and butter affair
with those who make it a profession, a few
dollars more or less per term will not make
them realize their true position and higher
responsibilities. The trouble is, that our
teachers are not dependent upon public
patronage, and do not take a fiersonal
interest in the efficient administration of
rules. The children are suffered to destroy
books and waste stationery ad libitum, and
neither parents nor teachers seem to care a
groat. They appear to think the book
fee covers all expenses, and give themselves
no further concern about the matter.
The school Board of this county petitioned
the last Legislature to amend the School
Law, so that the parents would be com
jielled to purchase books and stationery
instead of paying a book fee, (the poor to
go free as now) but no attention was given
to this petition, and hence the Board is
powerless to remedy the evil. The Legis
lature seemed to think that the creation of
a State Hoard, and a little more complica
tion and contradiction in the School Law
would be an efficient panacea fur all its
defects.
The State Board with its adjuncts in the
shape of conventions, and reports is the
grand birth of the Annapolis Mountain,
and if it turns out to be an expensive, as
well as rediculous muss, our School Boards
are hardly to blame. They do not make
the law—but administer it to the best of
their abilities. One of a Uoaiid.
Remarks of The Whig. —Our correspon
dent has construed our remarks in last
week’s issue, differently from what we
intended, which were certainly not meant
to convey the inq cession that the Board
sat with closed doors, or denied a reporter
the privilege of taking notes from the
minutes, if he ean. These are somewhat
of the hieroglyphic order, like the first
sketches of most minutes are, and our cor
respondent need not be told that it is some
thing of an undertaking to do so. It is
not always practicable for us to spend the
greater part of the time that the School
Board is in session for the purpose of get
ting a report of the proceedings, and unless
we do so, wo have always failed to procure
one. The Secretary having the minutes in
his possession, and residing eighteen or
twenty miles from Elkton, unless a hasty
report can be snatched while the Board is
in session, the only opportunity is lost.
Wo did not intend to reflect upon the
Board, or Secretary, or any one connected
with the Fublic Schools. The annoyance
arises out of the peculiar circumstances
which environ the business. The books |
containing all proceedings and matter rela
tive to the Public Schools, should like
all the other public office records of the
county, he kept at the central office,
accessible with pioper restriction at all
times and to all persons; anil further, it is
one of the duties of the ISoard to have it so.
The public interest demands it.
North East Items.
•
Mure Improeemenls. —Carpenters are at
work constructing a porch across the
entire front of the residence of Mr. Wm.
Beatty, of this town, and inclosing the
yard with a neat new fence.
The Finishing Touches. —The workmen
are putting the finishing strokes on the
new house of Mr. George McCullough, on
I Main street.
Concert and Exhibition. —The Sunday
school of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
in this place, are rehearsing for a concert
and exhibition, for the benefit of their
library. The entertainment is to transpire
somewhere about Christmas.
The Magic Lantern Exhibition. —Mr.
Win. R. Hunter gave his entertainment, as
announced, in the M. E. Church, on Fri
day evening, the 2d instant. It was only
tolerably well attended, and gave entire
satisfaction to those who witnessed it.
A Eeic Church. —An effort is being made
by a number of earnest gentlemen, to have
a church built in the neighborhood of Mrs.
Bouldcu's, on the Nottingham road, about
three miles from Elkton. An interesting
revival is still in progress at the residence
of the aforenamed lady, who has presented
a lot of ground for a house of worship.—
The deed is secured, trustees appointed,
and every reasonable promise given of a
speedy consummation of the commendable
enterprise.
Alarm of Fire. —We bad an alarm of lire
in our quiet town on Monday morning last.
It proceeded from the public school house,
and was occasioned by the exit of au
uncommon volume of smoke through the
interst ices of weatberboarding and shingles,
on account of a defective flue. No dam
age was done beyond a tempoary fright,
and the tearing away of portions of the
building to discover the origin of tho sup
posed lire.
Another Neie House. —Dr. Stepheu E.
Ford has just had a new tenant house built
on Cemetery street, not far from his own
residence, which has also been enlarged
and improved.
ISably Scalded. —William H. Kline was
badly scalded internally one day last week,
at tho McCullough Co’s Rolling Mills. He
was inside a large boiler, which was being
repaired at the time, when, from another
boiler in proximity to that one, a volume
of steam was discharged, entering by the
only means of egress where the young man
was at work. His cries attracted the
workmen, who came to his rescue, and
when they had delivered him from his per
ilous situation, Dr. Worrall was sent for,
and, on arriving found that he (Kline) had
breathed the Scalding steam, till his throat
and lungs were seriously burned. He is
recovering.
Practical Kindness. —The Pastor and his |
wife, of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
in this place, have recently been substan
tially remembered by some of their kind
friends in the way of donations of coal,
beef, fresh pork, groceries, fowls and dry
goods. Such tokens of kindness, beyond
their intrinsic value, are occasions of good
cheer and pleasure to the donees, who, in
this instance at least, seem to be greatly
delighted at the reception of such friendly
testimonials.
Injuries from an Accident. —Rev. Joseph
Dare, of Charlestown, was greatly jarred
and bruised by being thrown from his
sulky, in one of the streets of North East
two weeks ago. He was confined to his j
house until Tuesday last.
Ziou Items.
Even while I write, I find myself vaguely
wondering if any other person in our trim
little village, will summon up courage suf
ficient to address you, thereby giving you
the exquisite pleasure (?) of having to

has not visited us in this pleasant autumn ;
weather, bringing sorrow and mourning to 1
any of our happy family circles, but instead,
God’s grace has been bountifully showered
down upon many of those most highly
esteemed in our midst, during the revival
still in progress in one of our churches.
All is quiet and peaceful among us; no
liquor-vender “nifties the stillness of our
dreams,” by his contaminating influence.
Our moral community, as yet, have never
felt the breath of misery from this curse,
which is ruining and degrading so many of
our fair sister villages,—although a being
of the male persuasion, whom not to deal
in pensonalities, I shall call “ Count Bis
marck,” pronounces it anything but “char
mant,” because cur village boasts not
this “one thing needful” to assist in
degenerating mankind. We may conclude
a la Douglass Jcrrold, that the worthy
Count is “ fonder of his toddy than of his
wife,” (in prospectus?)
Our two churches unite in the one effort
of contributing their might (not mite) to

The M. E. Parsonage in proces of erec

We have our prophet among us, who
prognosticates earthquakes, sees invisible
comets, says “I told you so”! to the
announcement of tidal waves, volcanic
eruptions, etc., and sometimes, I rejoice to
say, sadly misses the mark in our wretch
edly non-appreciative community, thereby
verifying the sentiment, that “a prophet
is not without honor, save in his own
country.”
Another celebrity is our Knight of the
shears, who holds recherche oyster suppers
in his diminutive accommodations, and
who finds the chairs, stools, “elbow room,”
Ac., of his miniature saloon, after the day's
routine is over, tilled with spectators, as
well as participators in euchre, old sledge,
and seven up, all as eager and anxious as
the scores of Bill’s and Toni's who nightly
crowd the billiard-room in the rear of the
Continental.
Mr. Ford’s model store, I need not men
tion, ’tis too well sought, and widely appre
ciated to need my feeble praise.
Last but not by any means least, I come
to the educational part of my communica
tion. We have two schools in our vicinity,
Churchside Academy with its efficient
teacher. Miss Jennie Kinser, and the Grove,
under the management of Miss Ida Cameron,
assisted by Miss McVey, each eminently
successful in her different department, and
by their assiduity and attention, winning
the approval of all those interested in the
cause of popular education. Just here
seems an apropos time for me to unburden
my mind of several ideas regarding our
school system, with which it has been
oppressed for some time. Don’t think I’m
trying, in vulgar parlance, to kill two birds
with one stone, or to interfere with those who
i cere not born great, but have had greatness
thrust upon them, as our old bard Shake
speare tells us. Schools crowded with
pupils, are given to one teacher, who clings
to her situation as the one means of sup
port ejien to her. conscious that her reputa
tion will suffer, from tho fact that her time
and strength are neither sufficient to do
her pupils justice. Her plea for assistance
usually elicits the one response: really we
must ecogonize! Economize forsooth! In
what way? Is it economy to tone down a
teacher’s list of incidentals, thereby taking
from her hard-earned pittance, depreciating
her labor, positively crushing her under
the wheels of this modern Juggernaut,
while one in a little higher office, figura
tively pulls a wire and finds his already
liberal salary increased for staying at home
in pleasant and stormy weather. Verily
consistency is a jewel! A mechanic can
strike for more advantageous bargains, and
’tis a certainty that his employers dread
such a movement, but no such an avenue
is open to the scores of teachers who,
many of them, might fitly be ranked among
the Les Miserablet of our land. Civilization,
refinement and our social elevation, demand
that tho teache s should bo encouraged.
Visit them in their school rooms; let them
know that their efforts are appreciated by
some few, at least, and I for one, fancy the
good work will not be lost.
Winter is creeping on apace, dispelling

Seventh District Items.
Wheat looks well and bids fair for a large crop. Some
complaints are heard among the farmers who sowed very
early, of an insect that cuts the stock off just beneath
the ground, leaving the plants of a faded yellow color;
those who have examined the insect say it resembles an
ant in every particular, except that it has wings; but its
ravages only extend to some fields, the most of the
wheal looks well.
Schools in our District are very well attended, showing
that our people have adopted the spirit of education :
but we have one regret, however, and that is our teach
ers’ salaries, which in most crises sire insufficient to defray
necessary expenses. This subjects us often to great
inconvenience. When we succeed in getting good ami
competent teachers, we too often have to part with
them for the simple reason that the salaries will not
justify them in staying. Can not something be done in
this matter?
Churches are being built and others repaired in
our District, which indicates that we are a church-going
people ; and approve of places of worship.
Improvements. —Considerable building is going on
around ns. Mr. Enoch Noyee is putting up a splendid
resilience, (West & Vannort, contractors,) which when
finished will doubtless reflect credit on those gentlemen.
Mr. Wm. Kerr has also erected upon his farm a beauti
ful building, which much improves the neighborhood.
Mr. Joseph Haines has also erected at Mechanics Grove,
a store-house, blacksmith and wheelwright shops. Mr.
James Knight has also built himself a store-house, a
short distance from Mechanics Grove. It will be re
membered that this is the gentleman who lost all his
shirk by fire last winter, Pbcouix-lika, raises a new store
house from the ashes.

Communicated.
Mr. E. E. Ewing— Sir: —Being in your
town a few Jays since, I fell in conversation
with a young lady, when the subject of!
Temperance was introduced. I remarked
that it was strange there wore not more
belonged to the Lodge of Good Templars
in Elkton, —for He that is above all knows
there is a great work for Good Templars
to do in that town—when the young lady
remarked: “ They are of such an inferior
set of persons that first class persons don’t
care to associate with them.”
I visited the Temperance Convention,
held in Elkton Dec. Cth, and from the
conversation with the young lady, I fully
expected to see men dressed in “home-spun”
and women in “domestic.” But instead, I
met with a body of well dressed ladies and
gentleman. To be sure they had not quite
so much false hair, powder, paint, aud
sham jewelry, on their persons as our lady
friend, hut I did not see any person inferior
to the young lady. And I can assure you
that she did nut gain a friend iu me, for
thus speaking of Good Templars for she
was iu conversation with
A Good Templar.
A Liberal Offer.
To any lady or gentleman in either of
the Districts (except the Third) of the
county, who will furnish us with one short
letter each week, wo will pay $25 a year
in cash and give them two copies of The
Whig, to be sent to any address they may
name. The matter to be as truthful as
possible aud contain nothing of personal
character, aud be composed wholly of local
items, not verses, essays or articles on
politics or other subjects. Here is a
chaucc for young ladies or gentlemen to
improve themselves in writing, and at the
same time get enough at least to pay
fir paper and stamps. You need not be
afraid to write—we will put the matter in
proper shape. The following are some of
the subjects to write upon. Give us all
the neighborhood news. Tell us who dies,
who gets married, who conies into the
neighborhood, who moves away, who sells
or purchases a farm, what new business
starts, fires, accidents, fights, and in short,
anything that one neighbor would tell
another as news. And if you have nothing
better to write about, give us your opinion
of the weather, the condition of the roads
or anything else you choose. The Editor,
of course, reserves to himself the right to
publish the correspondence entire, in part,
or to withhold it altogether; and corres
pondents may feel safe in trusting him—he
will try to do what is right. If in any Dis
trict there may be more than one person
applying, the Editor will make selection,
but no one will ever know that there was
more than one applicant. The above pro
position will remain open until the 31st day
of December, and any one desiring the
position, will address the Editor over pro
per signature, with District and post office
address, with a speciman letter for publi
cation if they thiuk proper, and as soon as
the time expires, successful applicants will
be notified. Where there are not items
sufficient to furnish a letter weekly-, 50 cts.
a letter will be paid for all received that
are accepted.
To Cur© a Cough, to relieve all irritation of the
throat, to restore perfect soundness and health to the
most delicate organizations of the human frame—the
Lillies —use Dr. Hwfnr'* Balsam of WHd Cherry, which
is still prepared with the same care in the selection and
compounding of its various ingredients as when it was
introduced to the public by Dr. Wistar, over forty yean*
since.
