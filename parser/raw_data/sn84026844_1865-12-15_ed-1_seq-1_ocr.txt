Skating is not an American sport ex
clusively. It has the age of centuries
to recommend it. The people of all the
higher latitudes have held it in high es
teem from time immemorial... In Greece
it was a'diverttte'meilt d&ftfid only, to
the Olympian games, and .enormous
sums" in the large cities were expended
in the preparation andembelishmentrOf
tho natural and artificial lakes desi?h>
ed for this purpose.: Prizesvwere coirt
peted for, and the successful candidate
Was awarded the flattering distinction,
of having his name, with the date and
particulars of bis achievement, inscribe
ed in the-marketand'other places?fin
example whiclfnjay,.sooner or later,
imitated in our own country. ?? i I *
Among the Hollanders, skating is an
he" .'easier and more rapid progress j
>iaade bs their aid i^i traveling along
the canaiffand-riTora-oP-thex'omitry.'-?,
In moat countries, however,-where Bicai^
ing is practiced, it Is.lndiiljMdjid ttain
ly as an amusemehft-ahd- healthful ex
ereise. In theKdda it is mentioned?
tho God Uller being represented as dis-'
tinguished for his be^t^l^S^^ows and
skates. The Icelanders-artery fond of
the exercise, and history records the.
fact that in the olden Vipjo they .made
their skutes "of the shank-bone of a deeri
or sheep, about a foot long, which
they , greased because they
should not bo . . .stoppefl , by
drops upou them." .In' the description
of the ancient customs of London by
Fitzstephen. that author ..remarks:
"Some tye bones toJ their'lieelea, and
shoving themselves by .a little picked
stalfe,. do - alida-aS'simply.'as 'a bird,
flyeth in the.air,_pr ,nnr arrow from a
cross-bow." In Edinburgh" tho amuse
ment 'was'-"known Home1 centuries ago,
and the yonng .folks''flfa "very much'
f;iven tolt." In the'"Sp6r(s anil Pas
inies of the People of 'England" the
wttter uays'44he has se^n upoii the Ser
pentine Kiv6t four gentlemen dance a
double minuet in skates,:with as much
ease .and more elegance-thi<ti in a ball
room jM while Hono in his **fiv<iry day
Jlook", remarks "that the oleganco of
skatesx>n that sheet' of water Ls chletlj^
exhibited, in quadrilles, I which hoiuc
parties got through with, ui beauty
scarcely imaginable t/y'thbsb who have
not seen graceful skating."
. Therefore, let. it bo understood that
skatinc'i6 peculiar to no particular na
tion.1 1 It is1 too good a thing xti b$ en
joyed by, only cu^e. people, and hence
the reason why it is esteemed so highly
by all clans, cliques, and setk of-peo
ple who live where water freezes. ?
Tbe reoent dash of cold weather has'
elevated the spirits of the skaters to an
exb ill a rating degree. There has been a
geueral brushingup and burnishing
of steel shoes, and all ttie pece&sory gear
has been put in order;1 ' For who
knoweth what a day Or an hour inay

"It consfetfe of Mrs. Howell, Miss
Howell and Willy Davis. Margaret
Davis is lit tho Sacred Heart convent,
and young Jeff. Davi* is at the college
nt Lenoxville. Owing to the sudden
fall to nothing of tho rebel paper money
the family found themselves five thou
sand dollars less in funds than they ex
pected to be, and were in consequence
very- much straitened in meanB?so
much so that they had to leave a bouse
"where the charge for living was small,
to go into another one whore it was still
smaller. Master William Davis is a
fine boy of fonr of more years of aee.
He looks a little like his fatherf, the
nose promising to be aquiline. His
forehend is a very good ono. Or Miss
Margaret Divis ana Master Jefferson
very little is seen in this city. They
are both described as fine children, the
girl being nine years of age and the
boy about seven, thr latter resembling
his father in some features. As may
be imagined, the family are very warm
on the matters of the fate rebel cause.
The yrfnng lady is particularly so: and
the twoboys, witn boyish boldness,
speak very freely, and now and then
indulge in little ebullitions of anger;
saying TPhat they would do If they
were mexvdcc. regard to this, Wil
ly one day placed arow of apples on a
table, and with a violent sweep of his
hand sent them all roiling on the floor,
shouting at the same time, 4That is -the
way I.would make the Yankees fly.
All the family attend the Episcopal
church, going to the cathedral, tho
fashionable church here."
