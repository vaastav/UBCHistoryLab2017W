THE HOBilAL SCHOOL.
jWe dirKt particular attention to the
report oi me jrr.Qcipi oi iu ouhai
tnilJ&bool on the outside this week, And
to lha report of ibe Board of Visitors od

made of education general! will be glad

-. THE VEXED Q UESTIOIT.
jVTe see that the vexed question of "ne
gro suffrage' is again to be brought be
fore the' Legislature of this State at its
next' session. Meeting bare been held
bj. 'the colored pepple in some of our
principal cities, where this class "most
do congregate," and steps taken to bring
the psalter before the Legislature. These
effort bare been made before the last
three sessions, and made ably, too. All
who listened to the arguments of the col
ored man (we forget bie name) wbor ad
dressed tbe Legislature last winter,' ac
knowledged them to be convincing. ' But
many of tbe members were not yet ready
to f'do justice." Tbe matter consumed
aeveral days of discussion and was de-'
feated.""-But "things is workin," aid a
'cbapge bas come o'er the -dreams" of
maoyj people within the past year, wbo
have always been most hostile to the ex
tension of tbe right of suffrage to tbe
colored rac, and we find many of its bit
terest fo'irrcr enemies now favoring the
proposition. .
People may talk as they please, but
Ibia is a subject whioh demands tbe at
tention of all. It is to be met by all, and
met in tbe spirit wbicb its importance
demands. The day of "dodging" and
"eubsterfuges" end "buncombe speecb-
Xes" iapast, and earnestness is demanded.
I we did on th is matter three years ago.
that oar Legislature ought, in justice, to
submit an . amendment to oar constitu
tion.to a vole of tbe pe'ple proposing to
' strike tbe word "white" irom the suffrage
. clause of tbat'documeot. We base our
argument for this position 6imply upon
justice. We hold no one bas any right,
whatever, to withhold from any man
wbicb God bas created any of tbe privil
eges of citizenship or self-defense. We
bope, then, tbe next Legislature will sub
mit this matter to tbe people, and let tbe
"vexed question" be at once and forever
settled. Tbe people are ready for it. In
fact tbey are getting anxious about it,
eepeoially our Democratic brethren wbo
follow tbe lead of sucb organs as tbe
Chicago. Times.

This gentleman seems to be gaining
ground in the Senatorial contest, from
what we bear. ' Many bitter things have!
beeoaod are being said about. bim, but
tbey tend to sdd to bis strength more than
they detract. Wholesale denunciation
does. not hurt the man at whom it is hurl
ed. The facts that Leavenworth bas
strong claims on the Senatorship aud that
be is tbe man that can unite more strength
there than any one else, are patent to all.
JJia record as a public man i good, if we
except tbe Senatorial election, and he was
not so mucb to b!me for that as his
friends. He made a good Governor, and
bee ever beeu the true friead of the m--
Uriel interests of Kansas. The White
Cloud Chief and perhaps some other pa
pers rather doubt bis political record.
Since' Govercor Carney entered publio
life we believe be bas b:en a consistent
and ardent' Republican.' It is charged
that he did opt array himself against the
Preeident quite quick enough. We know
that Governor Carney had strong hopes
of retaining Mr. Johnson, and prevent
ing tlie rupture between Cjngress and
the President, after many of us bad giv
. cn no all bona of such results. Mr. Car-
i
ney certainly occupied no worse position
in tb'nr matter than Governor Ci aw ford,
whom the people btve jut endorsed eo
handsomely. , Tbe editor of the Chief
bimself voted against the Ekridge reso
lution? eeasaring' the President in the

Tbe fight over the Senatorship in - tbe
north part of the State is not particularly
' ours,' end we feel like letting them man
age th matter up that way, but it does
teem 14 ns that a live ana wbo jives in
tbe State, aid baa all bis means invested
ta Kanras, and who has worked for ber
end given thousands of dollais for ber
up-building'. Is preferable to a man who
does not live in the State, andwho will,,
if elected, not reside in Kiaeas six months
of the tci m all put togethe r. We don't go
a great deal" on not resident Senators or
Bepreeentatives so . hug as we have an
abundance of - borne talent to-fill -such
poiitions.'-' j
Of course we are for our Neosho Val
ley iatsrests aboya those of any body else,
and went t tee our man puo;eed, who
ever ay ? picked upon ae the candidate.
Do aot oar interests lie as much with
Leaves worth aa with 'Atchison? 'We are

We copy the following saggestios from
the Topeka Record. We trust the
Legislature will do something to relieve
tbe people of some of their taxes. No
man baa looked over tbe long string of
bids allowed for court expenses without
a shudder. The s nicest ion io relation to
making those who bring their little petty
quarrels into court, pay the expenses, is
one we hope to see adopted. It will save
much litigation and trouble:
There is work for the Legislature, the
coming session, cesides electing U. a.
Senators: Among other things to be
done fs an amendment of the criminal
code, giving Justices of the Peace juris
diction io cases of petit larceny. - 'Io ma
ny States sucb jurisdiction is given io all
cases where the eum, alleged stolen is less
loan 925 00. In this State all cases, let
the amount be ever eo small, are taken to
the District Court. Tbe result is, a great
expense to the. county. Last week there
was a trial of a man in the Shawnee couo-"
ly District Court for stealing five pounds
of nails, which cost tbe county ten times
as much as it would if tbe man could
have been tried before a justice. No good
reason can be given for not changing the
code iu thie respect and we trust that it
may, be done. Another thing that re
quires overhauling is the Civil Code. . In
other Stales tbe whole cost in civil cases
arc taxed up to the part ha. In thie 8iate
tee countiee pay the jury fees. Why
should the people be taxed to pay expens
es of parties litigating? Will Meters.
SpDci, Plumb, Riggs, Price and the
Otter lawyers in the Legislature attend to
ibis ? -.borne measures should be taken
to is duce tbe county expenses. We
are nol. prepared to say what those meas
ures should be, but believe that legisla
tion is absolutely demanded to 6ave tbe
enormous expenses of most of the coun
ties in the State. About ten thousand
dollars will be raised in Sbawnee county
tbe present fiscal year to pay the court
upeces. It is getting to be an evil too
great to be borne patiently. Tbe same
complaint comes up from nearly every
county in tbe State.

to be witnesses accessible by the Govern
ment to -whom he has not only 'confessed
his guilt in connection with tbe assassi
nation, but also that it was planned at

:,; It may be eaid'witb reference to the
Chicago Times' Springfield dispatch stat
ing that Hon . B. Washburne will be a
candidate for the Senate against Judge
Tiumbull, that Mr. Wathburoe author
iaes its direct and emphatic denial.
It is reported that the nomination of
Gen. Dix, as Minister to France, will be
rejected by the Senate, on tbs ground of
bie participation in the Philadelphia Con
vention. A bill has been introduced ia the South
Caroltaa Legislature to call a convention
of the State to consider the welfare of the
People. The bill, re-salies the usury
iawa naa passea Dota Houses. .
The military commitu do Dot expect
very eenoua business at this session, ex-
opt on the questions ' of an increas of
oScera' pay and tbe equalisation of 01
diers bounties. The equalisation ques
tion has already been brought before the
House, Gen. Schenck having introduced
bis bill of tbe last session.
Last May the government learned of
Jno. H. Surratfs whereabouts through
one of his former associates, who will be
on band if wanted when Surratt's trial
takes place. He reports that Surratt fre
quently said the assassination conspiracy
was known beforehand in Richmond.
Gen. W, D. Whipple. Chief, of Gen.
Thomas's staff, has , returned ; to Louis

and reports the feeling against the North
and Northerners daily growinv worse.
Gen. and Mrs. McCl'ellan are at the
Water Cure establishment at Mariix Swit
zerland. The lady's health is improving.
The War Department bas published an
other Roll of Honor, embracing the names
of soldiers who died io defense of the
American Union, and interred in the
States of Arkansas, California', Indiana,
Michigan, Minnesota, and Nevada, and
the Territories of Arizona, Colorado, Ida
ho, New Nexico, and Washingtou. Tbe
pamphlet contains at least 7,000 names.
Tbe correspondence in reference to tbe
arrest of Surratt, when sent into Con
gress, will ehow that the Government
has known of bis whereabouts and move
ments nearly all tbe time since be fled to
LEurope, There will be no trouble. in
procuring evidence to cenvict him, for
his own confessions in Italy to his fellow-soldiers
are ample, if any means ate
taken to, bring them over.
President Jobnson is said to be very
much exercised by the action of Congress
in appointing special committees to in
vestigate his conduct in connection with
the New Orleans riot and other matters.
He will probably be more exercised by
their reports after the investigations have
been concluded.
COHGRESSIOHAL ITEMS. ..
The reception by the Soldiers Union
League of Washington to the radical
members of Congress was a grand affsir
and a complete success, according to tbe
telegraph.
In the senate, Mr. Sherman and Mr.
Williams, and in tbe House, Mr. Stevens
and Mr. Boutwell have introduced bills
restricting the President's power over
office holders, and several other members
are preparing bills on the same subject.
Tbe empbalia and overwhelming Re
publican majority of 111 to 29, by which
the House of Representatives voted to re
peal tbe President's power to pardon be
fore conviction, and to grant amnesty to
rebels, sets at rest any fear that may.
have been entertaining on the question
whether the republican party would cot
divide part favoring and part opposing
amnesty to rebels. As parlies are tend
ing, tbere will soon be no parly opposed
to impartial suffrage, and none in favor of
amnesty to rebels.
After the adoption by Coogress of the
! suffrage bill for tbe District of Columbia
the city charter will be taken away,
and tbe city governed by a board of four
commissioners to be appointed by, the
President. These commissioners; wil)
absorb tbe functions of the city govern
ments of Washington and Georgetown.
A long bill on this subject has been
prepared for presentation to Congress.
The President, to the inquiry of the
House about the occupation cf the Terri
tory of Mexico, replied - that be had no
information but the telegrams which bad
been published. 7 1
: He also eent a voluminous . report on
the subject of the capture of J. H 'Sur
ratt, which was not read. ':
The Leavenworth Conservative thinks
the following will be tbe programme of
Congress at it present session.
1st. Tke limitation of ' tbs pardoning
power to the extent provided by the Con
stitution. A bill to this effect has already
passed the House, and will doubtless be
concurred in by tbs Senate at ' ad early
day. - ' - " " ';
'Id. A thorough investigation of the
President's official conduct, including bis
connection with tbe New Orlens massacre:

Tc thj Hoh. Isaac T. Goodhow.
' . -Superintendent 'of fullic Instruction
Tbe undersigned, the Board of Visitors
of the State Normal School, at Emporia,
for the year VI 865,. respectfully submit
tne following report, which is made in
compliance with section 10 of the act of
1864, entitled, "An act to Organize the
State Normal School;" j -j.
We visited the school on Tuesday and
Wednesday, the 4th and 5ib of Decem
ber, 1866.. We preferred tor inspect the
daily drill and routine of' school - work
rather than the closing ' examination, as
giving a better insight into the-, actual
process of Normal traioing. No change
fd the usual programme was made on our
account. . .
According to the provisions of the sec
tion abovs referred to, it. is our duty to
Examine thoroughly into tbe: affairs of
the school,' and report to you our "views
in regard to its condition, success, and
usefulness." -
One of your. Committee bas visited the
school on previous occasions, and can
speak from actual observation when as
serting that it is in better condition now
thas at any former time. The number of
pap'da enrolled for the , present term is
aeventy.-five. , Now, as heretofore, be
order and discipline of the school was
above all criticism. Tbe utmost quiet
and decorum prevailed thioucrhcut.
... . i .. o "
Teachers and pupils appeared thoroughly
in earnest. All things moved with abso
lute mechanical precision. There was no
visible trace of tbe spirit of mischief, dis
order and indolence, which so mars and
belittles the great majority of our educa
tional institutions. Rejarded merely as
a modbl for ibe other schools of the State,
a means for inciting other teachers to like
triumphs in order, and educational excel
lence, our Normal School is worth ten
times ever all that it bas cost us. Tbe
school is now approaching tbe comple
tion of its second year. Many of tbepu
pile have been in attendance during tbe
greater part of this time, and the effect of
these years of traioing is sbown in a
steady development of all the elements of
eohotarly excellence. There was a great
er r freedom pf speech than formerly, a
keener and subtler , appreciation of ob
ecure and difficult topics; more vigorous
and origioal thought; and a belter mas
tery cf eye , and band in all the depart
ment of graphical illustration. . .
-The following classes recited during
our visit: .
Arithmetic, Sections A, B, and C.
Grammar, Section A. . i . . .s .
Geography, Section A, and B.
Reading, Sections A. aLd. B. ;
Ancient History. ... ( ;
' Geology. , , .
, Vocal Music. - -0 . ;
Nat. Philosophy.: . ! . ;
In speaking of these exercises, it is but
fair to premie that almost all of tbe Nor
mal students have been for some time
residents of this State, where they had
grown up with sadly limited -means, of
education. Their previous training had
at the best, been confined to such ecanty
instruction as they might gain from a few
months spent in the school houses of the
border, r Tbey were almost totally desti
tute of the discipline which children ac
quire at' an early age, , in the graded
schools of the East. - The Faculty, were
obliged to cox me nee at the very founda
tions. : .. ,!.:'
One of the most immediately noticeable
points was tbe rigid persistence -with
which Ihe topical system of--recitation
was enforced. - The .old stereotyped sys
tem of 'questions and answers", was ut
terly, discarded., , Topics, oftener than
other. whe ponsisiiog cf. a single jword,
.were aaaigced; to. ibe pupils,, and. each ,
without' the elighlejt reference s to, text
bocks or memoranda, was required to
rise and develop the. leading points of it
in his owp language, and ,in proper con
secutive order, with constant aqd copi
ous blackboard illustrations. . Thus, the
topic assigned to a pupil might be The
Andes." He was required to sketch up
on the board a complete map of that sys
tem of mountains, with all their .impor
tant ramiScations, the . valleys, plateaux
and lakeathey inclose, and the rivers Ajw
log from them;, to describe the bight of
all the .different., chains, uand principal
peaks, Jolgire the local names, .latitude
and longitude, altitude, climate, and spe
cial cbara&terisltc! of all the different
points of the map.'- When all this bas
been dqoe-the topogr phy of the region
in question' is fixed in bold indelible re
lief, uponthe m,iAd of: the'pupil: - la lite
mannerk be pupils in Physical Geogra
phy we'rV'required 'to illustrate and "de
scribe :tbi 'ocean1 currents, the winds,
volcanio and tidal action; those in History
to. draw maps of important " historic
regions and : battle-fields';"' those ' in
Geology drew' sections' of strata, 'and
sketches of fossils j and in "Grammar,
Crosby's novel method of wrilten analy
sis was used. 'Witnessing one recitation
in Arithmetic would certainly "excite in
tbe most inveterata old fogy" a supreme
diaguat "at the aimless and worthless
ciphering" of our distrtct schools. ' In
Reading, tbe difference was, if possible,
still more striking. : In ths elementary
class, the phonic analysis of sounds -was
taught, accompanied by remarkably neat
and tasteful phenetio. printing of entire;
lessons upon tbe boardi ''.Tbe result of'
this is, that Normal graduates will un-.
derstaed the procunciaton of English
wordsl The utmost, deliberation, 'dis--i
tinotaess, and volume-of kUeraace; was
decanded. Ia ibe dare adraeeed cUsa,

Under Prof. Kfellogg's direction, the en
lire school performed astonishfogly rapid
combinations of Lumbers, and Prof. Nor
ton discussed and . elucidated "the impor
tant political and. scientific news of, the
day.
Physical exercises occur (daily. These
consist of certaiu gymnastics specially
adapted to develop the cheat and lunge,
and very valuable ia promoting tb health
of the students. They are performed in
perfect time by all tha. pupils and teach
ers, and the general effect is very pleas
ing. These exercises are rapidly grow
ing in the popular estimation, and' , num.
berless cases of weak lungs hare been cur
ed by them, under the direction of Dr.
Dio Lewis and bis followers. Nothiog but
good can result from their introduction
into all the schools of oar Suite.
We were also glad to notice the con
stant reference which w3 made by tbe
Faculty to tbe best methods of teaching
the various subjects under consideration.
This is . what distinctively marks a Nor
mal School. , Not merely to learn the
lesson of the day, but to learri Aow 'o
teach it to others, is the object definitely j
aimed at. , lne .theory and Art of aeacp--.
ing is a prominent study, occupying the
second and third terms of. each school
year. The plan of tbs institution also in
cludes a Model School, which will be "or
ganized as soon as possible, and in which
all the Normal students will have .actual
practice in teaching, under the eye of
tbeir own experienced instructors.
So much for the actual class exercises.
We feel . justified in saying that both
instructors and pupils are doing strong,
intense work, and that our Normal School
is training up such a generation of teach
ers as will inestimably bless our young
State.
Tbe school will leave its present tem
porary quarters for its permanent abode
at the opening of the next term, Jan. 2d,
1867. The new building, though not
entirely finished, will still give the school
better accommodations than its present
ones.
This new building is located on a
sightly eminence adjoining the" town site
on the north, about half a mile from tbe
centre of the corporation. t It is forty
feet by eixty, two stories high, beside the
basement, arid crowned by a lofty cupola.
The upper story is occupied. by the main'
assembly -room, a high, well lighted ball,
capable of sealing comfortably, at desks,
perhaps 120 pupils. It is finished sub
stantially and elegantly. On the ' first
floor are four spacious rooms, . three of
which are intended for Normal recita
tion rooms, and one for the Model School.
Only two of these rooms are as yet fin
ished. . Tbe dressing rooms are in the
basement, also unfinished. The building
was constructed by John Hammond, of
Emporia, accordiog to plans and specifi
cations furnished by T. H. Lsscher of
Lawrence,; ,- :!. '
We also, visited the Normal Boarding
honse, now in process of construction.
Its walls are nearly fioished. It is a large
stone building, intended to accommodate
fifty boarders. These building,. iben
completed, will amply meet the wants of
the school for years to come. , .. r )
' We are iuformed that Miss A. G, Ho
mer, of the We si field (Mass.) Normal
School, has been, added to the Faculty
for tbe coming year an addition urgently
demanded by the steady growth of the
school and the present; overworked con
dition of its teachers. Miss Homer has
received a training almost -identical .with
that . of .the present teachers, and ber ex
perience and ability will doubtless speak
emphatic words as to the fitness of ber api
pointment. , -j ,
, , Kansas needs to cherish her . Normal
School.. From ,811 parts 5of; tbe State,
comes up the Macedonian cry, wbicb co
other agency can answer end satisfy.' J In
the name of the children of tbe State,, tbe.
men and womeq of the - coming genera
tion, we feel justified in asking for it a
liberal, hearty, earnest co-operation ; and
SUppOrt. Il .It. -
We therefore ask yoar influence in be
half of the following recommendation:
That our Legislature, at its next session,
appropriate a sufficient sum to finish the
building,. to properly fence and . embel
lish its grounds, to : provide all , needful
furniture, chemical and philosophical
apparatus, books of reference and. a. cabi
net organ, and to eupport its enlarged
Faculty for the coming year. . ,,.;..';
In: a3king this, we feel that we are not
venturing . upon, untried ground. -The
experience of America and Europe dur
ing the last half century, bas fully abo wn
the value and. economy, of the Normal
Schools supported by the State., la this
country, particularly, the progress of this
eytem of, instruction has bsen truly won
derful, culminating at last in , the great
Illinois Normal University at Blooming
ton, with its buildioga erecd and fur
nished at a cost of $225,000,00, and its.
annual appropriation of nearly ,9 1 3,000. -00.
.In wealth and population, Kansas
is far below Illinois, but she should sure
ly make exertions proportionably great.,
in snca a cause,;- ,A R . . r -
a We would also desire to call the atten
tion of riends of educatioa, throughout
the Stats, to the advanUges, which - this
school offers. c -hot quite half the coun
ties' jn tbe Slate are thus far represented.
Tbe .school was esiablished for the; bene -fit
of all . parts ; of the , State .equally
Hundreds of young mea and women are
every year sent away to seminaries and

- Sherman is pobably on bis way to

; A special telegram from Vera Crua,
dated Dec. 4th via Mobile, 10th, contains
news of importance. - Tbe Susquehanna,
with Lieut. Gen. Sherman and Lewis
Campbell, arrived Thursday at noon.
Tbey came ashore, and the courtesies of
the French commander were declined..
: On" Monday night, 3d inst., the vessel
failed. jorUrazoa, woere it arrived on
Fridav last. Gen. Shermao and Minister
Campbell wete to leave for Monterey, via
Matamorae. Cotemporaoeously with the
arrival pf the Susquehanna at Vera Crux,
a proclamation was issued, declariog tbat
Maximilian would not leave the country,
but wovtd resume the reins of government.
In the meantime, the. Emperor's baggage
is being sniped for Austria and tbe r rench
troops are concentrating preparatory to
leaving.
Gen. Sheridan arrived at Brownsville
on tbe 6tb, and placed Gen. Sedgwick un
der arrest. Healsoorderd tbe release
of Ortega and r Escubado, - and ordered
Canelles to Monterey to take "a command
in the force operating againet Sin Luis,
and ordered Cor tinas to report io Chihua
hua under arrest for-depredations com
mitted. . .
The New Tork" Prew on tke Mesage.
The World commenting on the Message
eays: Toe Jr resident adheres to bis for
mer views with resolute and indomitable
steadiness, but with the calmness, of con
scious strength. He refrains from dis
cussing '6V'euff8tinf any uew conditions
of - the admission of, tbe southern mem
bers, because be recognizines no authority
on the part of Congress to impose any.
Both the tone and argument on this lead
ing point are excellent.
On the other hand, the Tribune says it
bas no heart to dwell on this dreary, life
less document. There is nothing that
any loyal man can read witn comtort or
hope. Andrew Jobnson . is as much ol
an enemy how as when he menaced the
nation from the White House ten mooths
ago. The ttuiy devolving" upon Congress
now becomes more solemn and responsi
ble, and we loot to Congress with infinite
yearning;. . ' "
. Tbe HeraM thinks the -Message ai' ar
gument to le court after the jury had
rendered their, t verdict. Tbe President
talks of ancient landmarks as If, none of
them bad' been swept away by tbe late
Southern -dejuge of fire acd blood; as if
the fire bad changed nothing, and as if tbe
recent elections bad decided nothing.
The Times finde cause for regret that
the Presides t has neither modified his
views nor given any -indication of a read
iness to concede anghtof principle or pul
ley to, tbadeniaods cof - the governing
States and Congress. '
