Stories Concerning Folks and Things
Some of Which You Know and
Some You Don't Know?Condensed
for Quick Reading.
i? nnitn a ohanere in the at
titude of York county jurors and people
generally toward the railroads and
railroad employes in matters pertaining
to damage suits as compared with
several years ago," said a young railroad
man who was in Yorkville last
/ week as a witness in a railway damage
suit case in the court of common pleas.
"I have heard Jurors say right here in
York county that they wouldn't believe
the testimony of a railroad employe
who wsb in the witness chair because
he wus paid to lie for the railroad
anyhow and it has made me fighting
mad a many a time. But now they appear
to regard railroad men as human
and truthful and just as reliable citizens
as anybody else."
> People Paying Taxes.
"This is about the first trip I have
made to Yorkville in a year," said Mr.
Ross Parrish, well known citizen of
the Clover Mill village at Clover who
came to Yorkville Saturday to pay his
taxes. Several of us came down today
to pay our taxes," said Mr. Parrish.
Almost Got Away With It.
"Speaking of having cotton stolen
from the field," said a York county
farmer Saturday, "I came near losing
750 pounds that way this morning. I
was moseying around the place and in
a selected spot I found 750 pounds
carefully hidden away. The thief evidently
expected to get away with it to-1
night or maybe Sunday. But he won't
because I took It away from there
right quick. I'll say I did."
Didn't Like the Job.
"Sitting on the Jury is almost as
mean a job as standing at attention in
the army," said C. O. Castles, well
known young man of Smyrna, who was
in Yorkville all last week as a juror
attendant upon court of common pleas.
"This is my first jury experience," said
Mr. Castles, "and I didn't miss service
og qoany cases tripd. You've heard
about a continuous seat not padded
making corns, haVen't you? Well I
almost got 'em."
/ Few Apple Wagons Will Come.
"There will be comparatively few
apple wagons from the mountains of
** ^ ~ <^Aurn qo fa r OH
IX or in uaiuium w 6CI Uvn.<
York county this winter," said an automobile
dealer from Boone, Wautauga
county, N. C., who was in Yorkvllle the
other day. "The North Carolina apple
crop is as good this year as usual, if
not a little better, and the apples are
bringing a fancy price. The apple
wagons have been going out in as
large numbers this year as usual; but
the demand for apples has been unusually
heavy and their supplies have
been purchased by people in towns
closer to the mountains that Yo. k
county towns. It will probably continue
that way until all are gone."
Where the Mules Go.
"York county horse and mule dealers
are selling so many animals this fall
that one wonders where in the world
they are going to be used and where
those animals whom they succeed will
go," remarked a prominent York
county farmer Saturday afternoon.
"Oh, that is easily explained," said
another farmer who was in the party.
"If you'll just take a look around the
back lots in Yorkvllle and Rock Hill
and Clover and Sharon and Fort Mill
on any trading day anu see the old
plugs that are offered for any kind of
price, and are then carried 10 tuner
counties you'll see where they go. And
then lots of York county horses, like
York county people die every year."
(
Used Karo to Make Booze.
"We've known for some time," said
Horace Johnson, state liquor constable
that the moonshiners in York county
were using homemade molasses in the
manufacture of liquor as well as sugar
or almost anything; but I found twenty
empty cans that had contained the
well known "Karo" brand of corn
syrup at a distillery which George
Sparrow and I tore up on Mr. Galloway
* Crawford's place in King's Mountain
township Thursday. Along with the i
empty syrup cans we found a quantity
of Jugs and other containers which had 1
evidently been placed there in anticipation
of a big run. We broke up'
the distillery and poured about 1,000
gallons of mash, which was nearly
right for making liquor, into the
* fm.na nnhnHv nresent
Dranuu. i? c ivuuu ^ a__
when we discovered the plant."
Potatoes Destroyed.
"I had expected to have plenty of
sweet potatoes to feed the inmates of
the county home on this winter," said
Superintendent I. P. Boyd of the York
county home a few days ago; "but I
had the misfortune to lose about seventy-five
bushels by fire several days
ago and that will reduce the supply a
I greut deal. I made a special house to
keep the potatoes in, you know, and I
have been having the best of luck with
them for quite a while, keeping the
house at temperature of about SO
degrees. A spark from the heater
caught the boards of the house some
days ago and the whole thing was
turned. However, we still have some
potatoes. Population of the county
home is now about as low as it ever
gets," Mr. Boyd went on to say. "We
have about twenty-five persons in the
home at present and they are all getting
along nicely. All are looking forward
to Christmas. People are mighty
good to them at that season, especially
ladies of the First Presbyterian church
of Yorkville who always bring them
baskets of good things to eat and little
articles of clothing and other comforts
at that season."
Beautiful Sentiment is This.
"You know," said a Yorkville man
yesterday, "as the holiday season approaches
almost everybody is so busy
I amid the hustle and bustle of it all that
I few stop to think about the real meaning
of Christmas and its significance.
Of course everybody knows the origin
( of Christmas and art about the festival.
But they are just too busy it seems. 1
ran across a little piece of poetry the
other day, captioned "Bethlehem," ar.d
written by Wilber Underwood, that is
[not oniy Deauuiui in us siiupuuuy um
| is a most correct interpretation of the
occasion that we are about to celebrate.
Here It is:
Cold was the earth and all the stars.
But Mary Mother smiled
Where in the manger of an inn
Lay warm the Holy Child
The ox was host upon that night
Unto the King of all;
He gave for incense meadowy breath,
For shelter his rude stall. j
Not all the cold of earth and man
Can pierce the heaven mind,
Where warm against her leaping heart ,
A Mother clasps Her Child.
i
O miracle of utmost love, ,
How God grew greater when
He stooped to be a helpless babe
Beside the hearts of men.
Long ages since?and still in joy, I
In loneliness and tears.
We kneel unto a Little Boy
Who smiles down through the years.

tax of such proportions will be im- j

said Saturday that there had been
some discussion of the matter among j
members of the council and that ir. j
all'probability*an
tax for non-resident horse and mule t
dealers who would do business ir. 0
Sharon will likely be passed within the (
next few days. t
Sharon merchants are beginning tc
feel the pressure of the Christmas E
trade which may be said to have fair- r
ly. opened up last Saturday. The f
crowd in town Saturday was not quite ^
as large as has been the average Sat- (
urday crowd for the past sixty days r
but still there were many peeople here r
and they bought much holiday goods t
Most of the Sharon merchants have j
special Christmas offerings and now a
have these goods on display. The> c
are anticipating a good business anc* t
in fact most of them are worried because
they have not been able to got ;
larger stocks of holiday goods thar c
they have been able to get.
It is estimated that 4,000- hales of (
cotton or better have been ginned this c
season which is about nearing its end. This
is the largest amount of cotton
a\-ar p-innerl in Sharon perhaps, and
local ginners are well pleased with Hitseason's
output- There are two gin- .
nerles within the town and despite th< s
fact that both of them have had inort t
or less serious setbacks because of
trouble with their respective plants, j
still they are well pleased with th< j
season's work. ^
Pupils of the Sharon school are ,
looking forward with keen interest to
the closing of school on account of j
the Christmas holidays.. It has rot
been definitely agreed upon 41 x yet; but
very likely the school will be closed
for two weeks on account of the Yuletide
season to the extreme joy and satisfaction
of every pupil of the school
to sa> the least.

Misses Garrison and Saunders Have
More Information About York County
People Than Law Required?
Young Lady Official Tells of Her
Work.
If Uncle Sam's eighty odd thousand
enumerators who are to take the
decennial census of the country next
year do anything like as complete u
job as havo Misses Relva Saunders c
and Alice Garrison, York count)' [
school attendance officers who have
just completed Iheir census of the 3
school chikn-en of the rural districts j
of York county, the county generally j
will have all the information thai n
could possibly be desired in regard to s
its population. Misses Saunders and b
Garrison in their exhaustive survey j
of the county's school children, have tl
not only gotten all the information i,
about those children that the Com- j]
pulsory sahool laws of 'the state re- a
quired them to get; but at the sug- ^
gesfion of the Co inty Superintendent ^
of Education John E. Carroll, they w
have gone further and gotten much ],
information about people who are not a
yf school age and which makes an in- 8I
valuable record. Incidentally, the y
York county school attendance officers w
ire the only officials in the state who 0
nave done this additional work. tl
People Gladly Aided. t<
"We have completed out task of
:aklng the school census in the rural
Jlstricts," said Miss Ajice Garrison, C]
county attendance officer, "and the 8(
vork has been accomplished without S)
i great deal of trouble. We have ir
'ound a tendency on the part of peo- 3j
)le throughout the county both white
md black to give us all the informa- j |r
,lon required by the Compulsory at- 81
endance law promptly and accurately ^
o the best of their respective abilities, e;
md they have heartily co-operated 8(
vith us in getting the facts that we a,
lought about people generally in ad- ai
lition to that information which the ty
ict requires. w
"The information required/by the CJ
ompulsory School Attendance law
nduded: color, full name, date of >v
>irth,. including the year, month and m
lay; age on last birthday*sex; scUdd!
Lttended last year and grade; nanu g)
if parent or guardian; postofflce ad- fj.
Iress and the number of the school
listrict in which the child resides. fc,
"Our inquiry, however, has developd
many additional facts including the
noider. name of the mother of every
amlly, the birthday of both parents,
he dale of marriage, the names of all
hildren ^ind the birthday of all childen
regardless of whether or not they
ire of school age or over or under;
he names of hubsands of those in
-- if
laugniers or a lainuy who uip uiarucu i
ind the names of wives of those son.' ?'
?f a family who are married and their 3'
hildren.
"The census as we have taken It," "
diss Garrison continued, "also in- "
'ludes the information as to whether ^
very family both white 'and black
?wn the premises on which it resides 31
>r whether or not it is rented and if
he family are tenants we have the
lame of the landowner and his address. C(
Physical Statistics.
"We have also paid careful atten- ni
ion to th^ matter of collecting phy- ^
:ical statistics not only in regard to
he children of school age; but all
nembers of every rural family. We ^
rave information that is almost entire- ^
y accurate as to the number of blind 0l
hat there are in York county both "(
imong whites and negroes- We have a
ecrod of the number of epileptics of
joth races and a bit of the history of
ach individual case. There are other p
ecords of this kind that rfre of value. "
"We have not yet had time to compile Ci
ill of this information as we expect to
lo. It is a great task, you know, and 81
considerable time will be necessary to 01
complete it in detail. Still, from more
>r less careful perusal of the records 01
ve have been able to form a fairly a
jood idea as to the number of illiter- lr
ites in the county, the number of phy- "
hcally defective and other information. "
The number of defectives?physically
defective, by the way, is surprisingly< s'
Tew, the great population of the coun- ?
ty being taken into consideration.
"Now since we have completed our b
;ensus," said Miss Garrison, "Miss ^
Saunders and I are devoting a corisid- "
erublc portion of our time to inspec- ?r
ting the various schools of I he county v
and seeing to it that the pupils are ri
living up to the terms of the ,com- ?
pulsory attendance act which requi
res that till children between tlie
ages of S and 11 attend school eighty c
consecutive school days each year.
Few Violations.
"The law is being strictly obeyed 11
throughout the county and so far very
few violations have been reported to
us. There have been no prosecutions. 1
There has been some misunderstanding
about various sections of the law. hut
all the kinks are being rapidly P
straightened out. For instance, a few 11'
weeks ago in the southern section of j
the county I came across a school IP
trustee engaged in picking cotton inia
one of his fields. One of his children v
of school age was picking with him. I b
inquired why the child was heir.g kept ti
out of school and the father informed t;
me that it was absolutely necessary tojir
keep him at home that day becaus<
his services were needed in the field.'
dnce it was impossible to Jure cottor
flickers.
'I then inquired of the trustee il
he was hot aware that he was violatng
the terms of the statue in so doing
ind his reply was that he was nol
iware of any such violation becauw
Ma understanding was^ that the law onl>
required that the child attend foi
>ighty days of the year. Then I ln'ormed
him that the law said the child
nust go eighty consecutive school
lays. He immediately saw the dlffer>nco
and he gave nic assurance that
he law would be strictly complied
vith hereafter. Thus the Incident was
Must Mind the llaby"I
came across a rather pathetic
:ase some time ago. A mother works
n a York county fiottoi mill. She

that they work- in '.he mill also

called her attention to the fact that
his boy should go school and she
nmediately informed me that It was
mpossible because |ome one had to
ttend the baby while she worked and
here was nobody ayallalde save the
oy. The 1 .w exerigrts children of
ddow s whose livelihood hi in whole or
l part dependent upofc those children,

uch cases. It occurred to me that the
ttle lad's work of minding the baby
'as certainly necessary to the suppprt
f the mother and other members of
le family. Therefore he will not go
i school?not this year at least.
The Reason Why.
"I came across another interesting
ase recently," said the York county
2hool atendance officer. 'In a certain
action of the county- thare l:ves .a
Lan w ho is reputed to be. rather headlong
and quick tempered. I was

IF YOUNG AGAIN.
ow Would You Make Your Life Different
from What It Is.
The Philadelphia Public Ledger re ntly
sent inquiries to several promcnt
men as to what they would do
they were young again. Very few
' the men replied that thoy would
fain engage in the sane line of cnjavor
in which they are now engaged,
early all of them' thought of someling
else they would undertake if
ley were to start over, and this
espite the fact that all of them ar<
iccessful men.

for it leaves no doubt as
> the desirability of entering
Lany lines of endeavor. Had all of
tern been of one opinion as to a vocaon,
it would have indicated that
>ung man's opportunities are limited,
ut here we find many learned men
iving it as their opinion that any one
f a dozen occupations is the most
usirable, if that is the way to exress
it.
The truth is it doesn't make a great
sal of difference what business or
rofession a young man engages in.
he is successful in his chosen voltion,
that is all that is essential
or success in one line is as good as
lccess in any other line, providing
rtly that the line ii respectable.
Further, it doesn't seem to mattei
laterially what a young fellow thinks
bout it; he is likely to find himself
i later life engaged in something he
ever dreamed of engaging in in the
rginning. That is to say, the average
lan doesn't select a career for himslf
and follow it to the end. Most
f the men of today have literally been J
need into the occupations they are
in-suing:. The boy gets the first job

else, often to many things, and

? WANTS PRESENT TARIFF' REVISE
Would Have Congress Extend the Wj

I * of Railroad" Problem Reserved fc
Another Message?No Discussion (
the Treaty.
[ Washington, Dec. 2.?A diversifle
i legislative program to restore a peace
time business status, revise the ta
system, curb unrest, reduce the cos
of living and rectify labor and farm
ing conditions was recommended b
President Wilson today in his messag
to the new session of congress.
The president asked for new tarll
laws based on the nation's change
relation to the rest of the world, sug
gested that the income and exces
profits tax schedules be simplified, ad
vocated steps to improve rural con
ditions and promote production, am
declared for a "genuine Democratize
tion of industry" to protect both labo
and capital.
The railroad problem he reserve<
for a future message, and he mad(
no statement of his intentions re
garding the peace treaty or Mexico
Many of his recommendations wen
the same as those submitted to th<
special session last spring and severe
of them are embraced in legislatioi
already being formulated In the tw<
houses.
To Meet Cost of Living.
To meet the cost of living the president
asked extension of the war-tlm<
food control bill, federal regulatior
of cold storage, readjustment of foot
transportation, and establishment of :
system of federal licensing for all corporations
engaged in Interstate commerce.
He declared the causes of unreal
to be superficial and temporary, and
made his only reference to the senate's
failure to ratify the peace treat}
in saying that restlessness was dur
largely to the nation's hesitation in
determining its peace policy. The
federal government, he declared
I should be armed with Jfull authority
to deal in the criminal courts with
those who promote violence.
In an extended discussion of laboi
discussions he declared the workers
had just right for complaint in many
matters, and that there should be 0
"full recognition of the rlgh\ of those
who work in whatever rank, to participate
in some organic way in every
drjijion that directly affects then
welta're." He asserted that the right
of individuals to strike must bo held
inviolate, but added that there must
he ft firm stand against "the attempt
by any (Mass to usurp a power that
only government itself has a report
to exercise as a protection to all."
Finally he suggested the establishment
of a tribunal for peaceful decision
of industrial disputes.
For a Budget System.
He renewed his recommendation
for a budget system of national finances,
asking for spapial protection
to promote the dyestufis and chemical
industries, and declared the administration
bill providing farms for
soldiers should be passed without delay.
The message, about 5,000 words in
length, was transmitted to the capitoi
by messenger, the president expressing
regret that his health would not
permit his delivery of it in person.
It was read separately in senate and
house where u arew mixeu expressions
of approbation and disappointment.
The Democrats generally praised
it as setting forth decisively a
practical program of rerorm, while
on the Republican side there were
many complaints that it lacked definiteness
and omitted mention of important
problems.
In all of the private discussions
among members and in some public
expressions regarding it, there was
much speculation as to what extent
the president's illness had handicaplied
him in its actual preparation.
Democrats declared that Mr. Wilson's
vigorous beliefs on public questions
were shown by the language of
the message to be unimpaired by his
long confinement and weakness, while
in Republican cloak-room gossip there
was evident a disposition to speculate
on how far his advisers had gone in
framing the details.
Senators Compient.
This disposition was manifest in a
public statement by Senator Frelinghuysen,
Republican, New Jersey, declaring
the document failed to take
up some important public problems.
"The message," said Senator Frelinghuysen,
"reflects the views of Attorney
General Palmer, Secretary of
I,abor Wilson, and Samuel Gompers,
and undoubtedly they assisted in its
prepuraiiuii.
Senator Edge, Republican, New Jersey,
said in a statement that it was
rather academic and "certainly lacks
j the usual Wilson punch."
It was characterized as "a genuine
unadulterated Wilson message," by
'Senator McKeller, Democrat, Tennessee,
and Senator Underwood, Demo!
crat, Alabama, declared it "up to the
president's One standard." Senatoi
Hitchcock, of Nebraska, the a' 'ins
! Democratic leader of the senate, said
I that "few messages had pointed the
way to more enlightened remedies for
I existing evils."
I Senator Lodge of Massachusetts, the
Republican senate leader, had no cotp
ment to make, but Representatlv
Mondell, of Wyoming:, R publica
leader of the house, issued i state
1* ment saying that while the incssag
"contains much that we can approv<
it does not make any marked con
tribution toward the settlement c
0 the preplexing questions of the day."
|r DRESS HURTS JEWS.
n They Place Creed before Customs o
ir' Poland and Poles Resent It.
While I'oland is not engaged In th
slaughter of Jews, and in spite of th
d treaty protecting Jewish minorit
i- rights, the Jews will probably hav
x anything but an ideal existence i
it Roland for a long time to come.
That summarizes the opinions o
y most of the Poles, Jews and America!
c and British observers here.
The Jews are not living in fear o
Cf their lives. At the same time the;
d are subjected to annoyances and then
- is almost universal prejudice agains
a them.
As for pogroms, it' all depends 01
- the definition of pogroms. If pog
d gronis means simply killing then then
- have been pogromrf, just as there hav<
r been pogroms of negroes in th<
United States under that definition,
d But if pogroms means wholesali
e slaughter for policical purposes, 01
. slaughter condoned, plotted or counte
>. nanced by the government, then then
e have been no pogromsp
The Jews of oland do not dress like
1 the Poles. They wear lorrg blacl
i robes, long bushy whiskers and rounc
3 black skull caps. That prejudices th<
Poles against them to begin with. The
majority of them liv? in the "Jewish
. quarters" of the towns. The poles say
; that if they would dress and Mve like
i other people the prejudice would di
1 rcinish greatly.
i But their dress is part of their creed,
Another factor in the dislike of Jews
. by the Poles is the fact that the Jews
own much property; they are in many
[ cases the hated landlords.
I ' The Poles also charge that the Jews
were too friendly with the Germans
when the Germans were in Poland, and
? that they kept aloof fpom all things
i Polish, though citizens of Poland, and
did not join the army.
And so on.
' The most common Polish cHtlcism
i of tfie Jewish minority treaty Is that it
gives the Jews separate schools supported
from public funds; they claim
i a parallel case would he support .of
the Catholic parochial schools in America
ffon) public funds.
A Pole and an orthodox Jew are
never seen walking down the street together,
or chatting together, as in
America it is rare to see a white man
and a colored man fraternizing.
The Jews form about 14 per cent
of the population of PolandThe
American and British investl;
gations, by the Morgenthau and Samuels
missions, were resented by the
majority of Poles, principally because
both were headed by Jews.
These Investigations seem to have
spurred the responsible Poles to a determination
to do everything possible
to prevent trouble in which Jews
might be killed; to have brought home
the realization that the other nations
tv-ill nnf r-nnntena nee killines and to
have increased the general prejudices
of the Poles against the Jews.

in Finland is the number of women engaged
in almost every field of employment.
In England during the war one
became accustomed to the sight of women
performing various kinds of work
in which previously only men were
engaged. But in Finland the visitor
gets the impression that the women
are doing everything. They even serve
as porters on sleeping cars.
Not only are they at heavy manual
i work in fields and factories, but they
' have become skilled as mechanics and
have invaded business offices to an
extent that is probably undreamed of
in any other country.
In bands, the proportion of women
employes to' men appears to be about
10 to 1. In the biggest financial institutions
in Helsingfors, women hold
1 positions involving great responsibilij
ty and calling for exceptional abill
ty.
At the Finnish foreign office, The
Associated Press correspondent noticed
that women were holding offices that
would be entirely beyond the aspirations
of their sisters in the state department
at Washington of the British
foreign office.
This change has come about almost
| overnight. Finland's man-power has
j been greatly depleted, and a large
part "f what is left is required for
j military service.
j The Finnish business woman is re1
Imarkably Keen and intelligent. She
has a kind of masculine interest and
absorption in her work that seems to
' admit of no margin for sentiment or
I frivolity. She dresses simply and
1 smartly, as do the majority of the
II city-bred women of this country. 1 An
American walking through the principal
streets of Helsingfors might well
I believe, judging from the costumes and
1 brisk walk of the Finnish women, that
| he was in the heart of Chicago.

e The boll weevil Is now . In every
n Important cotton growing state, having
this fall established itself in the
t Oarolinas. Moreover, in nearly all sec;1
tions where the weevil has been present
this year, the damage has been exf
ceptionally heavy, In some cases runy
ning as high as 80 or even 80 per cent
e Damage has been severe in Texas,
t where the weevil haB been for many
years and where the seasons are favor1
able for the weevil It appears that the
pest will always be on hand to take a
, goodly share of the cotton crop. In
? other words, the weevil.is with us aps
parently for an indefinite stay, and if
we would make cotton, the sootier we
, iearn the essentials in doing1 id"the
r better for us. The following recommendations
are based on ten years'
; study of this pest, plus years of acutal
cotton growing under weevil conditions.
5 We pl^ce these esentlais in the order of
j their importance:
I 1?Plant on Rich Land, or Fertilise
5 Liberally.
Beyond all question, rich land is tot
i first importance in making cotton dea.
pite the weevil. Our rich valley and
. river lands are usually strong enough
to make good cotton despite the weevil,
if they are well drained. But even
9n these richer soils, fifty to seventvflve
pounds per acre of nitrate of soda
: at planting time to push the crop off
rapidly will generally pay well
On our thinner lands, fertilizers ,
should be used heavily If cotton is to
do gro\yn at a pront. un sucn tnui
lands,J# they have a good clay sabi
soil, we would recommend 200 pounds
per acre-of nitrate of soda and. 300 to
400 poimdrper acre of add phosphate
all applied at planting time. On soils
with a good clay subsoil, potash probably
will not be needed, and the tight
subsoil, prevents any material leach-.
ing out of the nitrate. On deep sandy
soils, 100 to 150 pounds per acre of
kainit or Its equivalent should be us4d
to supply the potash needed, and shift ^ 1
leaching is likely on such soils. It will
be best to use one-third or on?-hal?
the nitrate at planting time,'using'the
remainder as a side application the
latter part of May or early in June. N .
Where it can be had at a less cost pejr
pound Of. nitrogen, sulphate of ammonia
may be used in place of nitrate
of soda. .... ...?
The applications recommended may
appear somewhat heavy, but on our
average thin sandy and loamy soils we
have good evidence that they are highly
profitable.

The object of the heavy fertilization
above recommended, of course, Is to ..
push the cotton so that it "will rialcfc'ft*-*
fair crop ahead of the weevil; .
it is to be pushed to its utmost, rapid,
shallow cultivation is scarcely less important
than liberal fertilization, ft is
hard to lay down any set rules for cultivating
any crop, because methods
must be varied to suit seasonal conditions.
But the aim should be to stir
the soil early in the season, so as to , .
; l Iff |
kill all grass and weeds before they'
get a hold. Later cultivations should
be frequent and shallow, and grass
and weeds should at all times be kept
down. Ordinarily the clean, welh oot-? J <
ton Held has a good chance to make a
crop despite the weevil.

than useless. Experiments all the way
from Texais to Georgia, on pretty nearly
every kind and grade of soil, have
proved that close spacing uniformly
gets the biggest yields. Generally,
rows three feet wide and the cotton a
hoe's width in the drill will be best.
We doubt if under any conditions rows
should be wider than three and one
| half feet. This may seem like close
spacing, but we have abundant evi- '
dence to prove that it results in bigger
yields of cotton. Poor stands of cot-f '
ton, in our opinion, are very' largely
responsible for our low yields per acre.
Let "three-foot rows and a hoe's wKMh '
in the drill" be the aim.
The three points named above wd
consider of vital importance in mak-'*
ing cotton despite the weevil, coming"
far ahead of the matter of varieties;''"
picking weevils and squares, or poisoning.
