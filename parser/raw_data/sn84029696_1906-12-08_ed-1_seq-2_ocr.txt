An Odd Cure.
Are yoa a sufferer from Indigestion?
Here Is a curious remedy. Rev. John
Spencer of Duluth has brought back
with him from Ceylon one of the most
curious presents in the world. "Riding
on an elephant," he said the other day,
"behind a native prince on a hunting
expedition, the conversation chanced
to turn on indigestion, to which I said
I was subject. The prince at once
pulled out a black leather button kind
of thing, which he was "wearing on a
string round his neck, under his
clothes. 'What's that? said I. 'A hy
ena's snout,' was the startling reply.
'What for?' 'To cure indigestion.' 'How
can it do this?' 'It Is very simple. A
hyena gets its living by digging up and
crunching old bones. Now, it pos
sesses in Its snout this peculiar virtue,
that when its nose approaches any
thing hard, such as bones, those tough
substances instantly grow soft, and
enable the animal to eat them with
comfort and benefit. So you will find
If you keep this charm hanging round
your nock the proximity of the hyena's
nose, though dried up and lifeless, will
soften your food, however indigestible,
to such an extent that you will never
again suffer from indigestion.' "
Educating Newsboys.
Boston has an association of news
boys which has begun to establish a
fund for educating at Harvard one or
more among them, and has raised al
ready $2,003 toward the necessary
amount. This lively association, says
Collier's Weekly, has already been ad
dressed by President Eliot more than
once, and its latest step shows how
full of high ambition these boys are.
There could be, we gratefully believe,
no more sterling proof of opportunity
and of character in America than
these self-supporting youths now give.
In what other nation would a boy born
in poverty, earning each day his food
and bed, set out cheerfuly to pass the
examinations of a great seat of learn
ing, and, once in, to master to the full
its manifold weapons for adding to the
conquests of his life? Criticise it how
we will, and should, we may well glow
always for our land of the free. Now,
as ever, since the pioneer's ax fought
Its battle with the wilderness, is it the
home of Opportunity and of her naugh
ter, Hope.
An ambassador of a well-known Eu
ropean monarch was riding in the
streets of Constantinople when one of
the sultan's carriages rolled by. See
ing it was guarded, his curiosity got
the better of him, and when the car
riage readied him he was daring
enough to peep in at the passenger,
lie was surprised and pained to re
celvo a blow in the face from an at
tendant In charge. Mad with rage, he
demanded audience of the sultan. The
sultan listened attentively, and for
a moment appeared lost in thought.
At last he spoke: "My dear , I
have gone carefully into the case, and
see exactly how it stands. You are,
of course, a gentleman, therefore you
would never have committed such a
breach of good manners as you allege
to have taken place. Therefore iio
attendant could possibly have struck
you. The whole .affair seems to be a
product of your fancy. Let us dis
miss it."
An engineer from Sunderland was
spending a few days in London with a
friend, and after a busy morning sight
seeing the Londoner chose a large res
taurant for luncheon, thinking it would
be a novel experience for the man
from the north. The visitor appeared
to enjoy his luncheon, but kept look
lng in the direction of the door. "What

rather annoyed. "Well," was the quiet
reply, "A's keepin' an eye on ma top

said the other, "you don't see mo

guileless engineer, "thee has no call

fHE PRESIDENT'S
M1JESSAGE
Recommends Legislation on
New and Important
Subjects.
NCOME - INHERITANCE TAX
He Believes Such Laws Would Curb
Growth of Fortunes to Dan
gerous Proportions.
His Views on Negro Question Asks
for Currency Reform, and Shipping
Bill Would Make Citizens of Japs
Many Other Important Subjects
Discussed.
Washington, Dec. 3. The notable fea-
ures of President Roosevelt's annual
message to congress are his appeal for
he enactment Into law of several bins
ntroducetl into congress last winter and
pring; his views on the negro problem;
he scoring he gives those whom he
terms "preachers of discontent;" the
tand he takes for the control or corpor
ations by the federal government under
the interstate commerce clause of the
constitution, and his recommendation for
an inheritance and income tax law.
Many other subjects common to mes
sages of the chief executive are touched
upon, but the ones mentioned are by
far of the greatest importance. lie es
pecially urges the passage of the bill
prohibiting corporations from contribut-
ng to campaign tunas, and also that one
which would give the government the
right of appeal in criminal cases. Of
this he says:
"Another bill which has just past one
house of the congress and which is ur
gently necessary should be enacted into
aw is that conferring upon the govern
ment the right of appeal in criminal
cases on questions of law. This right
exists in many of the states; it exists in
the District of Columbia by act or the
congress, it 13 or course not propo.sea
that in any case a verdict for the de
fendant on the merits should be set
aside. Recently in one district where
the government had indicted certain per
sons for conspiracy in connection with
cbates. the court sustained the aeterm-
int's demurrer: while in another juris
diction an indictment for conspiracy to
obtain rebates has been sustained by
the court, convictions obtained under it.
and two defendants sentenced to impris
onment. The two cases referred to may
not be in ro:il conflict with each other.
ut it is unfortunate that there should
even be an .apparent conflict. At pres-
nt there is no way by which the gov
ernment can cause such a conflict, when
t occurs, to be solved by an appeal to
a higher court; and the wheels of justice
are blocked without any real decision of
he (luestioti. 1 can not too strongly
urge the passage of the bill in question.
A failure to pass will result in seriously
tampering ttie government in its errori
obtain justice. especially against
wealthy individuals or corporations who
do wronsr: and may also prevent the
government from obtaining justice for
wageworkers who are not themselves
vble eflectively to contest a case where
the judgment of an inferior court has
been against them. 1 have specifically
n view a recent i.ecision by a district

out remedy lor violation of a certain so
called labor .statute. It seems an absurd
ly to permit a single district judge.
against what may be the judgment of
the immense majority or his colleagues
on the biicii, to declare a law solemnly
enacted by the congress to be 'uncon
stitutional." :ind then to deny to the
jrovernment the right to have the su
preme court definitely decide the ques
tion.
Injunctions.
On the subject of the abolition of In
junction.-- in labor disputes, he says: -
In my last message i suggested the en
actment of a law in connection with the
issuance of injunctions, attention hav
ing been sharply drawn to the matter
by the demand that the rignt of apply
ing injunctions in labor cases should be
wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful
whether a law abolishing altogether the
use of injunctions in such cases would
stand the test of the courts; in which
case of course the legislation would be
ineffective. Moreover, 1 believe it would
be wrong altogether to prohibit the use
of Injunctions. It is criminal to permit
sympathy with criminals to weaken our
hands in upholding the law; and If men
seek to destroy life or property by mob
violence there should be no impairment
of the power of the courts to deal with
them In the most summary ana enective
way possible. But so far as possible the
(buse or the power snouu be provided
against by some such law as I advocated
last year.
The Negro Problem.
The negro problem is given considera
ble attention, after calling attention to
the fact that no section of the country
is free from faults, and that no section
lms occasion to Jeer at the shortcomings
of any other section, he turns to the sub
ject of lynchings. and especially as ap
plied to the negro of the sputh. lie says
the greatest existing cause for mob law
Is the perpetration by the blacks of the
crime of rape, a crime which he terms
even worse than murder. He quotes the
admonitions to the white people spoken
by Gov. Candler, of Georgia, some years
ago, and by Gov. Jelks, of Alabama, re
cently, and then says:
"Every colored man should realize
that the worst enemy of his race is the
negro criminal, and above all the"ne
gro criminal who commits the dread
ful crime of rape; and it should be felt
as in the highest degree an offense
against the whole country, and against
the colored race in particular, for a
colored man to f:il to help the officers
of the law in hunting down with all
possible earnestness and zeal every
such infamous offender. Moreover, in
my judgment, the crime of rape should
always be punished with death, ns is
the case with murder; assault with in
tent to commit rape should be made J
capital crime, at least in the discretion
of the court: and provision should be
made by which the punishment may
follow iimiu'diatcly upon the heels of
the offence; while the trial should be
-o conducted that the victim need not
be wantonly shamed while giving tes
timony, and that the least possible
publicity shall be given to the details.
The members of the white race n
the other hand should understand that
every lynching' represents by Just so
much a loosening of the bands of civ
ilization; that the spirit of lynching
inevitably throws Into prominence in
the community r.ll the foul and evil
creatures who dwtll therein. No man
can lakf pari In the torture of a hu
man being without having his own
moral nature permanently lowered.
Kvcry lynchins: means just so much
moral deterioration in all the children
who have any knowledg-e of - it. and
therefore just so .much additional
trouble fi:- the next generation of
America ns.
"Let justice be both sure and swirt;
but lot it be .ustioe under the law.
and not the-wild and crooked savagery
of a mob.
Capital and Labor.
On the subject of capital and labor
ti.e president takes the agitators of class
hatred to task arsd says "to preach
i.atred to the rich man, as such, . . .
to seek to mislead and inflame to mad
ness honest men whose lives are hard
arid wiio have not the kind of mental
training which will permit them to ap
preciate the danger in the doctrines
preached is to commit a crime against"
the body politic and to be false to every
worthy rr.r.viple and tradition of Amer
ican national life." Continuing on this
subject he says:
"The p'.uin people who think the
mechanics, farmers, merchants, work
ers with head or hard, the men t
whom American traditions are dear,
who love their country and try to act
Iec-r.ily by their neighbors owe it to
themselves to remember that the most
damaging blow that can be given pop
ular government is to elect an un
worthy and sinister agitator on - a
platform of violence and hypoer'sy.
Whenever such an issue is raised in
this country nothing can be ffained by
flinching from it. for in such case dem
ocracy is itself on trial, popular eelf
irovenuncni under republican forms Is
itself on trial. Thes triumph of th
mob Is just as evil a thing as the tri
umph of the plutocracy, and to have
escaped one danger avails notnins
whatever if we suouumb to the other.
In the end the honest man.whethcr rich
or poor, who earns his own living and
trie to deal Justly by his fellows, has
as much to fear from the insincere
and unworthy de-nagog. promising
much and ptrforruinc not'is. or eise
performing nothing but evil.
would set on the mob to plunder tue
rich, as from the crafty corruptionist.
who, for his own ends, would permit
the common people to be exploited by
the very wealthy. If we ever let this
government fall into the hands of men
of either of these two classes, we shall
show ourselves false to America's past."
Moreover, the demagog and corrup
tionist often work hand in hand. There
are at this moment wealthy reaction
aries of such obtuse morality that they
regard the public servant who prose
cutes them when they violate the law.
or who seeks to-malt?-them bear their
proper share of the public burdens, as
being even more objectionable than
the violent agitator who hounds on
the mob to plunder the rich. There is
nothing to choose between such a re
actionary and such an agitator; funda
mentally they are alike in their selfish
disregard of the rights of others; and
it is natural that they should join in
opposition to any movement of which
the aim is fearlessly to do exact and
even justice to all."
Railroad Employees Hours.
He asks for the passing of the bill lim
iting the number of hours of
employment of railroad employes, and
classes the measure as a very moderate
one. He says the aim of all should be
to steadily reduce the number of hours
of labor, with as a goal the general in
troduction of an eight-hour day, but in
sists that on the Isthmus of Panama the
conditions are so different from what
they are here that the introduction of an
eight-hour day on the canal would be
absurd, and continues, "just about as ab
surd as it is. so far as the isthmus is
concerned, where white labor cannot be
employed, to bother as to whether the
work is done by alien black men or alien
yellow men."
He urges the enactment of a drastic
child labor law for the District of Co
lumbia and the territories, and a federal
investigation of the subject of child and
female labor throughout the country.
He reviews the work of the commission
appointed to investigate labor conditions
in the coal fields of Pennsylvania in 1902,
and refers to the wish of the commission
"that the state and federal governments
should provide the machinery for what
may be called the compulsory, investiga
tion of controversies between employers
and employes when they arise."
"In this age of great corporate and la
bor combinations, neither employers nor
employees should be left completely at
the mercy of the stronger party to a dis
pute, regardless of the righteousness of
their respective claims. The proposed
measure would be in the line of securing
recognition of the fact that in many
strikes the public has itself an interest
which cannot wisely be disregarded; an
interest not merely of general conven
ience, for the question of a just and
proper public policy must also be con
sidered. In all legislation of this kind
it is well to advance cautiously, testing
each step by the actual results; the step
proposed can surely be safely taken, for
the decisions of the commission would
not bind the parties in legal fashion, and
yet would give a chance for public opin
ion to exert its full force for the right."
Control of Corporations.
A considerable portion of the message
is devoted to the subject of federal con
trol of corporations in what he refers to
the passage at the last session of the
rate, meat inspection and food laws, and
says that all of these have already justi
fied their enactment, but recommends
the amendment of the meat inspection
law so as to put dates on the labels of
meat products, and also to place the
cost of inspection on the packers rather
than on the government. Continuing on
this subject of the control of corporations
by 'the federal government he says:
"It cannot too often be repeated that ex
perience has conclusively shown the im
possibility of securing by the actions of
nearly half a hundred different state
legislatures anything but ineffective
chaos in the way of dealing with the
great corporations which do not operate
exclusively within the limits of any one
state. In some method, whether by a
national license law or in -other fashion,
we must exercise, and that at an early
date, a far more complete control than
at present over these great corpora
tionsa control that will among other
things prevent the evils of excessive
overcapitalization, and that will compel
the disclosures by each big corporation
of its stockholders and of its properties
and business, whether owned directly or
thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations.
This will tend to puc a stop to the secur
ing of inordinate profits by favored
individuals at the expense whether of
the general public, the stockholders, or
the wageworkers. Our effort should be
not so much to prevent consolidation as
such, but so to supervise and control it
as to see that it results In no harm to
the people. The reactionary or" ultracon
sorvative apologists- for the misuse of
wealth assail the effort to secure such
control as a step toward socialism. As a
matter of fact it is these reactionaries
and ultraconservatives who are them
selves most potent in increasing socialis
tic feeling. One of the most efficient
methods of averting the consequences of
a dangerous agitation, which is SO per
cent, wrong, is to remedy the 20 per cent,
of evil as to which the agitation is well
founded. The best way to avert the very
undesirable move for ! the governmental
ownership of railways is to secure by
the government on behalf of the people
as . a whole such adequate control and
regulation of the groat interstate com
mon carriers as will do away wun me
evils which give rise to the agitation
against them. So the proper antidote
to the dangerous and wicked agitation
against the men of wealth as such is to
secure by proper legislation and execu
tive action the abolition of the grave
abuses which actually do obtain In con
nection with the business use of wealth
under our present system or rather no
svstem of failure to exercise any ade
quate control at all. Some persons speak
as if the exercise of such governmental
control would do away with the freedom
of individual initiative and dwarf indi
vidual effort. This is ' not a fact. It
would be a veritable calamity to fail to
put a premium upon individual initiative,
individual capacity and effort: upon the
energy, character and foresight which
it is so important to encourage in the
individual. But as a matter of fact the
deadening and degrading effect of pure
socialism, and especially of its extreme
form communism, and the desf iction of
individual character which th.v would
bring about, are in part achieved by the
wholly unregulated competition which
results in a singla individual or corpor
ation rising at the expense of all others
until his or its rise effectually checks all
competition and reduces former competi
tors to a position of utter inferiority and
subordination.
Inheritance and Income Tax.
It was expected that the president
would refer in some way to his belief
in the necessity tor the curbing of enor
mous fortunes, and he has done so by
recommending legislation for both in
come and an inheritance tax. He be
lieves the government should impose a
graduated inheritance t x, and. if possi
ble, a graduated income tax. He says:
"I am well aware that such a subject
as this needs long and careful study in
order that the people may become famil
iar with what is proposed to be done,
may clearly sec the necessity of proceed
ing with wisdom and self-restraint, and
may make up their minds just how far
they are willing to go in the matter;
while only trained legislators can work
out the project in necessary detail. But
1 feel that in the near future our "nation
al legislators should enact a law provid
ing for a graduated inheritance tax by
which a steadily increasing rate of duty
should be put upon all moneys or other
valuables coming by gift. lequest, or
devise to -any individual or corporation.
It may be well to make the tax heavy
in proportion as the individual benefited
is remote of kin. In any event, in my
judgment the pro rata of the tax should
increase very heavily with the increase
of the amount left to any or.e individual
after a certain point ' has been reached.
It is most desirable to encourage thrift
and ambition, and a potent source of
thrift and ambition is the desire on the
part of the breadwinner to leave his chil
dren well off. This object can be attained
by making the tax very small on moder
ate amounts of property left; because
the prime, object should be to put a con
stantly increasing burden on the inher
itance tf those swollen fortunes which
it is certainly of no benefit to this coun
try to perpetuate.
There can be no question of the eth
ical propriety of the government thus de
termining the conditions upon which any
gift or inheritance should be received.
Kxactly how far the inheritance tax
would, as an incident, have the effact of
limiting the transmission by dsvisis or
gift of the enormous fortunes in question
it is not necessary at present to discuss.
It is wise that progress in this direction
should be gradual. At first a nermar.ent
national inheritance tax. while it might
be more substantial than any such tax
has hitherto been, need not approximate,
either in amount or in the extent of the
increase by graduation, to what such a
tax should ultimately be.
Agricultural Interests.
He appeals for every encouragement
that the congress can give to the agri
cultural interests of the country. He
points to the good that is being done by
the various forms of grange organiza
tions, and says:
"Several factors must cooperate in the
improvement of the farmer's condition.
He must have the chance to be educated
in th widest possible sense in the sonse
which keeps ever in view the intimate
relationship between the theory r-f edu
cation and the facts of lie. in ail
education we should wiGea our aims. . It
is a good thing to produce a certain num
ber of trained scholar And studtuts;
but the education 'superintended by tti9
state must seek rather to produce a hun-
dred good citizens than merely one j
scholar, and it must be turned now and
then from the class book to the study
of the great book of nature itself. Tiia
is especially true of the farmer, as xias
been pointed out again and again by all
observers mosx competent to pass prac
tical judgment on the problems of eur
country life. All students now realize
that education must seek to train th
executive powers of young people and to
confer more real significance upon the
phrase "dignity of labor," and to pre
pare the pupils so that in addition to
each developing in the highest degree
his individual capacity for work, the
may together help create a right public
opinion, and show in many ways social
and cooperative spirit. Organization has
become necessary in the business world;
and it has accomplished much for good1
in the world of labor. It is no less neces
sary for farmers. Suoh a movement as
the grange movement is good in itself
and is capable of a well-nigh infinite fur
ther extension for good so long as it is
kept to its own legitimate business. The
benefits to be derived by the association
of farmers for mutual advantage are
partly economic and partly sociological.
Marriage and Divorce.
As a means of bringing about national
regulation of marriage and divorce he
suggests a constitutional amendment, and
says it is not safe to leave these ques
tions to be dealt with by the various
states. Continuing on this subject he
says:
When home ties are loosened: when
ryn and women cease to regard a
worthy family life, with all its duties
fully performed, and all its responsi
bilities lived up to, as the life best
worth living; then evil days for the
commonwealth are at hand. There are
regions in our land, and classes of our
population, where the birth rate has
sunk below the death rate. Surely it
should need no demonstration to show
that wilful sterility is. from the
standpoint of the nation. from me
standpoint of the human race, the one
sin for which the penalty is national
death, race death; a sin for which
there is no atonement: a sin which is
the more dreadful exactly in propor
tion as the men and . women guilty
thereof are in other respects, in char
acter, and bodily and mental powers,
those whom for the sake of the state
it would be well to see the fathers
and mothers of many healthy children,
well brought up in homes made happy
by their presence. No man. no woman,
can shirk the primary duties of life,
whether for love of ease and pleasure,
or for any other cause, and retain his
or her self-respect.
The president asks for the enactment
into law of a shipping bill that will place
American interests on the seas on a par
with those of other countries, and urges
especially that something be done that
will establish direct steamship commu
nication with South American ports.
Currency Reform.
Amendments to the present currency
laws are asked for, and after showing1
that present laws are inadequate because
of the wide fluctuation of interest
charges, lie says:
"The mers statement of these facts
shows that our present system is seri
ously defective. There is need of a
change. Unfortunately, however, manv
of the proposed changes must be ruled
from consideration because they are
complicated, are not easy of compre
hension, and tend to disturb existing
rights and interests. We must also
rule out any plan which would ma
terially impair the value of the United
States two per cent, bonds now pledged
to secure circulation, the Jssue ot
which was made under conditions pe
culiarly creditable to the treasury. I
do not press any special plan. Various
plans have recently been proposed by
expert committees or bankers. Amon
the plans which are possibly feasible
and which certainly should receiv
your consideration is that repeatedly
brought to your attention by the pres
ent secretary of the treasury, the cs
sential features of which have been
approved by many prominent banker
and business men. According to thia
plan national banks should be per
mitted to issue a specified proportion
of their capital in notes of a given
kind, the issue to be taxed at so high
a rate as to drive the notes back when
not wanted in legitimate trade. This
plan would not permit the issue o"
currency to give banks additional
profits, but to meet the emergency pre
rented by times of stringency.
He again asks for free trade with this
country for the Philippines and in tht
same connection reviews the work done
by this country in the islands, and say
"if we have erred in the Philippines it
has been in proceeding too rapidly in
the direction of granting a large meas
ure of self-government.''
Naturalization of Japs. j
President Roosevelt scores San Fran- 1
Cisco and other Pacific coast cities for
their treatment of the Japanese, and
makes the following recommendations:
"I recommend to the congress that
an act be passed sicifically provding for
the naturalization of Japanese who come
here intending to become American cit
izens. One of the great embarrassments
attending the performance of our in
ternational obligations is the fact that
the statutes of the United States gov
ernment are entirely inadequate. They
fail to give to the national government
suiiiciently ample power, through United
States courts and by the use of the
army and navy, to protect aliens in the
rights secured to them under solemn
treaties which are the law of the land.
I therefore earnestly recommend that
the criminal and civil statutes of the
United States be so amended and ad 'led
to as to enable the president, acting to?
the United States government, which is
responsible in our international rela
tions, to enforce the rights of aliens un
der treaties. Even as the law now is
something can be done by the federal
government toward this end. and in the
matter now before me affecting the Jap.
anese, everything that it is in my power
to do will be done, and all of the forces,
military and civil, of the United States
which I may lawfully employ will be
so employed. There should, however, be
no particle of doubt as to tho power of
the national government completely to
perforin and enforce its own obligations
to other nations. The mob of a single
city may at any time perform acts 'of
lawless violence against aome class of
foreigners which would plunge us into
war. The city by itself would be power
less to make defense against the for
eign pov.er thus assaulted, and if inde
pendent of this government it woiiid
never venture to perform or permit tho
performance of the acts complained :.
The entire power and the whole duty ta
protect the offending city or the offend
ing community lies in the hands of tiia
fnited States government. It is un
thinkable that we should continue a pol
icy under which a given locality may be
allowed to commit a crime against a
friendly nation, and the United States
government limited, not to preventing
the commission of the crime, but. in th
last resort, to defending the people who
have committed it against the conse
quences of their own wrongdoing."
American citizenship should 'be re-,
ferred on the citizens of Porto Ri- .
The harbor of San Juan in Porto P'
should bo dredged and improved. T ?
expenses of the federal court of Po .
Rico should be met from the fede
treasury. The administration of the ji -fairs
of Forto Rico, together with tho-
of tho Philippines. Hawaii and our otlie
Insular possessions, should all bo direct
ed under one executive department; bv
preference the department of state or tha
department of war.
Cuban Intervention.
The rebellion in Cuba and the inc'
dents leading up to the establishment ot
the provisional government is reviewed.
andthe president says:
"v hen the election lias been held and
the new government inausrtirateI in
peaceful and orderly fashion of tiie provi
sional government will come to an end.
I take this opportunity of expressing
upon behalf of the American people,
with all possible solemnity, our most
earnest hope that the people of Cuba
will realize the imperative nted of pre
serving jiislicfi and keeping order in the
Island. The United States wishes noth
ing of Cuba except that it shall prosper
moral! y and materially, and wishes noth
ing of the Cubans save ti.at tiiev shall
be able to preserve order among them
selves and therefore to preserve their
independence. If the elections become a
farce, and if the insurrectionary habit
becomes confirmed in the island, it is ab
solutely out of the question that th
island should continue independent; and
the United States, which has assumed
the rporsorship before the civilized worlrt
for Cuba's career as a nation, woule
again have to intervene and to see thai
the government was managed in sucN
orderly fashion as to secure the safety
of life and property. The path to be
trodden by those who exercise self-government
is always hard, and we should
have every charity and patience with the
Cubans as they tread this difficult parth.
I - have the utmost sympathy with, and
regard for, them; but I most earnestly
aajure them solemnly to weigh their re
sponsibilities and to see that when their
new government is started '"t shall run
smootMy, and- with freedom from fla
grant denial of right on the one hand,
and fiom insurrectionary disturbances ot
the"" other."

fineries in the midcontinent oil field,
the Standard's plant at Neodesha and
the Wfebster refinery at Humboldt.
Now there are eighteen, five of which
are not yet completed. Probably this
record was never before made in any
field. The plants now in operation and
as near as possible to classify them
in order of size are: Standard, Sugar
Creek, 8,000 barrels; Standard, Neode

more than $1,307,088 greater than the
returns from the crop of 1905, which
heretofore had the distinction of be
ing the greatest income bringer. Of
this year's yield 2,130. 5GG bushels

the company owns several thousand
acres of leases in that vicinity.

THE FARMER IN WESTERN
CANADA.
The Quality of No. 1 Hard Wheat
Cannot Be Beaten.
The Canadian Vest in the past fiv&
or ten years has given a set back to
the theory that large cities are the
backbone of a country and a nation's
best asset. Here we have a country
where no city exceeds 100,000, and,1
where only one comes within easy
distance of that figure according to
the census just taken and where no-,
other city reaches a population ex
ceeding 15,000. The places with a.
population over 5,000 can be counted
upon the fingers of one hand, and yet
the prosperity "that prevails Is some
thing unprecedented in 'the history of
all countries past or present.
The reason for this marvelous
prosperity is not hard to seek. Tfce
3arge majority of the 810,000 people
who inhabit Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta, have gone on to the farm,.
and have betaken themselves to the
task of not only feeding "and clothing,
themselves, but of raising food for
others less happily circumstanced.
The crop of 1906, although not ab
normal, is an eye-opener to many who
previously had given little thought to
the subject. Ninety million bushels or
wheat at 70 cents per bushel $63,000,
000; 76,000,000 bushels of oats at 30
cents per bushel $22,800,000; 17,000,
000 bushels of barley at 40 cents per
bushel $6,800,000; makes a total or
$92,600,000. This is altogether outside
the root products; dairy produce, and
the returns from the cattle trade; the
beet sugar industry and the various
other by-products of mixed farming.
When such returns are obtainable
from the soil It is not to be wondered
ut Uiii many aru leaving iiitj tuugtai-
ed districts of the eayst, to take upon
themselves the life of the prairie farm,
and the labor of the housbandman.
With the construction of additionar
railroads new avenues, for agricultur
al enterprise are opening up, and im
proved opportunities are offered to the
settler who understands prairie farm
ing, and is willing to do his part in
building up the new country.
This is the theme that Mr. J. J. HI1L
the veteran railroad builder in the
West, has laid before the people in a
series of addresses which ho has
given at various points during tho
past few months, and, having been
for so long identified with the devel
opment of the West, there are few
men better qualified than he to ex
press an opinion upon it. Take care
of the country, says he, and the cities
will take care of themselves.
The farmers of the Western States
and the Canadian West, are more
prosperous than ever before, and
when it comes to measuring up re
sults, the Canadian appears to have
somewhat the better of it. Ills land
is cheaper in fact, the government
continues to giye free homesteads 'to
settlers, and the returns per acre are
heavier when the crop is harvested.
Farming land in the Western States
runs from $60 to $150 an acre and up,
whereas equally good soil may be pur
chased in Canada for $8 to $15 per
acre, within easy reach of a shipping
point, and much of this is available

the Canadian No. 1 hard wheat can
not be beaten, and the returns to the
acre are several bushels better than
on this side of the line; the soil and
climate of that country being peculiar
ly adapted to wheat growing.
The fact Is evidently appreciated
by the large number of American
farmers who have in the past two or
three years settled in the Canadian
West. The agents of the Canadian
Government, whose address will be
found elsewhere, advise us that for
the fiscal year 1904-5, the records
show that 43,543 Americans settled in
Canada, and in 1905-6 the number
reached 57,796. From all of which, it
appears that at present, there Is a
good thing in farming in Western
Canada, and that the American farm
er is not slow to avail himself of it.

It is doubtful if any royal consort Is
more loved by her people than Is the
empress of Japan. Educated accord
ing to feudal ideas and skilled in all
the accomplishments befitting one of
her social eminence, her majesty
strongly favors the broadness of the
new education for women and from
her private purse gives large sums
toward the maintenance of women's
schools and universities. During the
war with Russia the empress visited
the hospitals many times and every
day passed hours making bandages.
