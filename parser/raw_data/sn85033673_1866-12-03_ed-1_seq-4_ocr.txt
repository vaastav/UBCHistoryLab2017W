For the Public Ledgor.
TO JOHff.
Ported-io thei ltten teU me, ,
Coming back again to-day ; ;
Hard it u to scorn, repol the. J
Cast thee and thy love away.
Not expected not doserving, ' '
Come thii blow from me to thee ; " j
Tat, though hard and to unnerving,
I bar dealt it falteringly.
Severed and thy dream li broken i
Parted and the work was mine. f
And the lipa whose rash word spoken (
Meted out my fate and thine.
Are pleading now to be forgiven,
With the heart that wean their blight.
Long in trial bad I striven
To bo guided by the right. .
'Twere better thus to undeceive thee,
Ere the heart-ties grew too strong ;
I This is all that ean retrieve me t
' When you'll doubtless deem me wrong.
Awakened'i every tender feeling :
Pride immovable before
Bends before theo, loud appealing
For the peace ploe must restore.
' And wilt thou in wrath return me
Wrong for wrong in equal part?
I, though cruel, would not spurn theo
When I gave tuee oaca my nean.
let ns not part now forever
With shadowed memories of each.
But let this peaceful, kind endeavor
To both a future lesson teach.
Now, I plead, do not regret m.
Unworthy even of a sigh
Is (he who can ne'er forget thee
As the golden years rell by.
Parteil follows thee my blessing
That thy dreams of future bliss,
la their tender heart carewing.
Banish every thought of this.

MIDNIGHT DISPATCHES
LATEST FROM ALL QUARTERS
New York, December 2. The Repub
lican members of Congress, so far as their
.views have been ascertained, are almost
unanimously in favor of a law requiring
the fortieth Congress to meet on the 5th
of March next, with a view to continuing
the session until the regular day of as
sembling next December. At the caucus
last night this proposition was discussed
among others, and met with a general
acceptance. There is little doubt such a
law will tie passed to continue tne session
until the regular day of assembling next
December.
The present impression is that the
President's message will not be delivered
to Congress to-morrow, owing to adjourn,
ment for the purpose of responding to
the Radical mass welcome.
The following card was received to day
by the agent of the Associated Press:
Washington Dec. 3. L. A.Gobrighi:

of the New York Associated Press, that

GOTTSCHALK.
"I oonsider Chickering Jc Sons' Pianos su
perior to any in tne world.
"They are unrivaled for their tineinr nual
ties and for the harmonious roundness of thcirl
tone. 1 here is a perlevt homogeneity tbrouxh
out all the registers. The upper notes are re
markable for a clearness and Dnritv whirb I 1
not find in anyother instrument, while Fhabune
is distinguistiea lor power without barsliuess,
and for a magnificent sonority."
WEHLI.
' " Your Pianos are superior to any I have ever!
aeon in'this country or in Kurnna.
" I have never heard a tone so perfect; Itl
yields every expression mat is needed in uiumc,
and its aualitv is eanable of chanira u iik.i
every sentiment. This is a rare power, and is
derived from the perfect purily of its tone, to-l
aether witn its syuipatnctiu, elastio and woll-l

" During the past eight years I have con
