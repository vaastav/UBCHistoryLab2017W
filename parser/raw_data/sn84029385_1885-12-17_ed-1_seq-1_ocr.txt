The President's Message.
In the President's first annual mes
sage, which we gave to our readers last
week in supplement form, he has given
new proof of the fact that he is an in
defatigable worker. Ilis was a gigantic
task. For a quarter of a century the
president's message had been presented
to Congress by Bepublican executives.
Democratic opinion was suppressed
Democracy had no voice in the direc
tion of national affairs. This fact ren
dered it imperative that President
Cleveland should, in his first annual
message, make an exhaustive review of
every question that concerns the wel
fare of the country. This he has done.
Not in a pompous, flowery, bombastic
manner, but in the quiet, earnest, sim
ple, dignified and business-like way
which always characterizes his actions.
His are the profound yet conservative
views of a political student and states
man. He suggests but does not insist.
He has views, but they are not the
views of a dictator of one who says
to Congress,
"You must do as say."
The message is remarkable in many
respects. Every public question has
been considered. Among the most im
portant recommendations are those
which bear upon our much-abused nat
uralization laws; the coinage of silver;
the reduction of the tariff duties on im
ported necessaries of life; the immediate
passage of a law to give effect to our
commercial treaty with Mexico; the In
dian question in all its relations; the
improvement of the navy, and the in
sufficiency of our coast defenses; re
form in the diplomatic and consular
service; prompt action on the Chinese
immigration question; the subjection
of Mormonism to the laws of the nation
and proper legislation regulating the
presidential succsssion.
Upon civil service reform the Presi
dent takes a decided stand. The act
receives his approval and the principles
involved enlist his hearty support. He
is opposed to the distribution of public
positions as rewards for mere partizan
service, and thinks it doubtful if the
government coald survive a continua
tion of that system." This portion of
the message affords little comfort to
that large army of politicians who be
lieve that "to the victor belongs the
spoils;" and it is also a cruel reflection
on the time-honoredpolicy of Mr. Cleve
land's predecessors.
The President's desire to avoid all
complications with foreign powers, is
very marked. His suggestions relative
to the Nicaraguan ship canal, are very
explicit, and will command unqualified
admiration from all sources of public
opinion. It is the most admirably writ
ten portion of the message. He does
not "favor a policy of acquisition of
new and distant territory, or the incor
poration of remote interests with our
own."
It' is very evident that the President
has views upon every important ques
tion, and that he does not attempt to
conceal them. He is master of his own
mind, and that mind has been kept
steadily at work. His statements are
frank and clear, his deductions honest,
and his recommendations all bear the
stamp of sincerity. He occupies the
broad ground that he is president of a
nation, not of a party, and it is this
evident good faith toward the country,
regardless of politics, that is bound to
instill confidence into all the channels
of trade and commerce, and win for
President Cleveland's administration

Dead despite the accumulated treas

their heads and be sad at heart; but
the great world, whose heart beat and
throbbed with poignant regret over the

will utter no sob and speak no regret
for Vanderbilt. Only a day before the
Messenger called him he was telling a
friend that his income was twenty
millions a year, yet the next day he
was a beggar in the court of Almighty
God.
