PRESIDENTS MISSAGE,
SAlenbt Peatures of the Ofeial commu-1
gncation Made to.Congress by Presl
dent Roosevelt I set Monday.
[New Orleans Times-Democrat.]
The message opens with a reassur
lng expression as to the sound fun
damental business condition of the
country and a warning is issued
against the boarding of money. The
president states that the business of
our people is, as a rule, conducted
with hone-y and probity, although
there are some dishonest persons and
some dishonest practices. He reiter
ates his opinions regarding the neces
sity for the punishment of men in high
places who may have been guilty of:
dishonesty. He quotes from his mes
sage to congress of Dec. 5, 1905, re
garding the punishment of the guilty,
and the regulation of big corpora
tions.
Interstate commerce is dealt with,
the president emphasizing remarks on
the same subject made on former oc
casions. The founders of the con
stitution provided, he said, that the na
tional government. should have the
fullest control of interstate commerce.
He says that interstate railroad com
merce can be but partially regulated
by the various states and thus it be
comes the duty of the federal govern
ment to assume charge. Only the na
tional government, he says, can in
thorough fashion exercise the needed
control. An extension of federal ac
tivity is advocated, as the president
says the federal government has the
necessary power. He disclaims, how
ever, that this is an advocacy for cen
tralization. He suggests that there
should either be a national incorpo
ration act or a law licensing railroads
jto engage in interstate commerce upon
certain conditions. The message con
tends that until the federal gevernment
assumes full charge of the railway
situation, full justice can be neither
exacted from nor dealt to the railways.
The courts will determine the limits
within which the federal authority can
exercise it, and there will still remain
ample work within each state for the
railway commission of the state, says
the message, with the national inter
state commerce commission working in
CORPORATION CONTROL.
SDealing with the control of corpo
rations, the message says that modern
industrial conditions are Ruch that
combination is not only necessary,
but inevitable. The president adv,
cates additional legislation dealing
with the question of control. He
quotes a former message to congress
along these lines. The anti-trust law,
he says, should not prohibit combi
nations that do no injustice to the
public, still less those the existence of
which is on the whole beneficial to the
public. He also complains of the de
lays incident to the operation of the
present law, which works so that even
when the government may gain a
victory it is likely to be a barren one.
It is recommended that a general law
b3 enacted under the provisions of
which existing, corporations could
take out federal charters and new
federal corporations could be created.
An essential provision of such ameas
ure should be a method of predeter
mining by some federal board or com
mission whether the applicant for a
federal charter was an association or
combination within the restrictions of
the federal law. The supervision thus
suggested would be analagous to that
exercised over national banks. The
president thinks that such legislation
would benefit the big combines as it
has benefitted national banks. The
message says that those who fear,
from any reason, the extension of
federal activity will do well to study
the history, not only of the national
banking act, but of the pure food law,
and notably the meat inspection law
recently enacted. The co-operation
between the state and federal authori
ties in connection with the enforcement
of the pure food law is called atten
tion to.
CURRENCY QUESTION.
Taking up the currency question the
president quotes from his message to
congress a year ago, in which he
pointed out that the present system of
currency is seriously defective. In his
message at that time he recommended
for consideration the plan that na
tional banks be permitted to issue a
specified proportion of their capital in
notes of a given kind, the issue to be
taxed at so high a rate as to drive the
notes back when not wanted in legiti
mate trade. Coming down to present
conditions the message urgeaghe need
of greater elasticity of the currency,
provided that the even greater need of
a safe and secure currency is recog
nized.
The most rigid examination by the
national authorities is advocated and
provision should also be made for an
emergency currency based on adequate
securities approved by the government
and issued under a heavy tax. It is
also recommended that trust com
panies be subject to the same super
vision as banks. No legislation, how
ever, can guarantee the business com
munity against the result of specula
tive folly, says the message, and no
individual can be guaranteed against
the results of his own folly.
The income account of the nation is
reported in a satisfactory condition.
Dealing briefly with the tariff, the
president is opposed to any action the
year before a presidential election.
He says that the country is definitely
committed to a protective tariff and
any effort t) uproot it would cause
widespread industrial disaster. On
account of the rapid growth of the in
dustries of the country it is pointed
out that every dozen years or so the
tariff should be carefully gone over
go a to aOartfltai that no ,iroeio6
or improper benefits are conferred
.thereby.
When the tax laws are revised it is
recommended that the question of an
income tax and an Inheritance tax be
given careful attention. Both of these
taxes, the president thinks, should
be part of the system of federal taxa
tion. He refers to the systems in
other countries, especially Germany
and Great Britain.
A few years ago, the message says,
there was loud complaint that the law
could not be invoked against wealthy
offenders, but now, it is asserted,
there is no such complaint. It is
stated that the course of the depart
ment of justice during the past few
years has been such as to make it
evident that no man stands above the
law, and that no corporation is too
wealthy to be held to account. The
laws need strengthening, and should
be made more definite.
LABOR QUESTION.
Instances of injustice in the matter
of the granting of injunctions in labor
disputes are dealt with. Much of the
attack on the process of injunction is
said to be unwarranted. The matter
is commended to the attention of con
gress so that some way may be de
vised which will limit the abuse of in
junctions and protect the rights which
from time to time this power of in
junction invades.
Attention is called to the loss of life
and limb on the railroads of the
country, and it is suggested that the
federal govern.nout take some steps
providing for,'au inspection of this
feature of the railroads.
It is recommended that the national
government should be a model em
ployer, and to this end congress
should adopt legislation providing
limited but definite compensation for
accidents to all workmen within the
scope of the federal power. It is also
recommended that the law be made
such that the payment for accident by
the employer should be automatic in
stead of being a matter for lawsuits.
The message advocates that the prin
ciples of the eight hour law be as
rapidly and as far as possible ex
tended to the entire work carried on
by the government.
It is recommended that congress
take up the matter of creating the
machinery for compulsory investiga
. tion of such industrial controversies
as are of sufilclent magnitude and of
sufficient concern to the people of the
country as 's whole to warrant the
- federal government in taking action.
The telegraphers' strike of the past
summer is cited as an instance where
such action on the part of the govern
ment would have proven of benefi to
all concerned.
The capital and labor problem most
be solved partly by those directly con
B cerned and partly by the enactment
and enforcement of good laws, says
Sthe message. "It is idle to hold that
without good laws, evils such as child
3 labor, as the overworking of women,
as the failure to protect employees
' from loss of life and limb, can be ef
f fectively reached, any more than the
evils of rebates and stock watering
can be reached without good laws."
It is recommended that the appropria
- tion made for the investigation of the
overworking of women and child la
bor in the District of Columbia and
the territories be renewed.
The work of the departments of ag
riculture and of commerce and labor
are commended, and the importance
t of the farmer and the mechanic In the
life of the nation touched on. A na
tional system of inspection and grad
ing of grain in suggested.
GREAT RIVER HIGHWAYS.
Much space is devoted to the conser
vation of our natural resources and
their proper use. Our great river
highways, says the message, should
be developed as national highways,
the Mississippi, with its tributaries,
coming first in importance. From the
great lakes to the mouth of the Miss
issippi there should be a deep water
way with deep waterways leading from
it to the east and the west. As an in
cident to creating this deep waterway,
it is suggested that the government
build along its entire lower length
levees, which, taken together with the
control of the head waters, will at
once and forever put a stop to all
threat of flood in the immensely fertile
Delta country. The territory lying
adjacent to the Mississippi along its
lower course will thereby become one
of the most prosperous and populous,
as it is already one of the most fertile
farming regions in all the world.
A further extension of the irrigation
system, in connection with the reclama.
tion of swamp lands and the preserva
tion of the forestry, is advocated.
The question of public lands is takes
up and several recommendations of
the public land commissioner dealt
with. Considerable space is Riven to
the preservation of the forests and the
importance of the work. The message
says: "There should be no tariff on
any forest product grown In this
country; and, in especial, there should
be no tariff on wood pulp; due notice
of the change being given to those en
gaged in the business, so as to enable
them to readjust themselves to the
new conditions. The repeal of the
duty on wood pulp should, if possible,
be accompanied by an agreement with
Canada that there shall be no export
duty on Canadian pulp wood." The
question of the government mineral
lands is also discussed.
A report on the work on the Panama
Canal goes into detail as to what is
being accomplished.
Regarding postal affairs, it is ree
ommended that a postal savings baan
b established and that the postal par,
eels system be extended in accoardnoe
with recommendations of the pest
master general.
itegardtal preeild4ettal oampalgcl
the message says it is well to provide
for the publication of campaign contri
butions and to provide thatc orpora
lions shall not be allowed to contrib
ute to such funds. It is also recom
mended that a national gallery of art
be established in Washington. The
work of the biological survey is fa
vorably commented on, and attention
is called to the unsatisfactory work.
inlogs of the ocean mail service.
Discussing the needs of the army, it
is recommended that the'medical corps
be made larger, also that the pay of
offcers and enlisted men be increased.
Other recommendations looking to
making the army more attractive to
enlisted men are made.
In regard to the needs of the navy,
it is recommended that four new bat
tleships should be provided for this
year, together with plenty of torpedo
boats and destroyers, and both on the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts fortifica
tions of the best type should be pro
vided. The importance of properly
defending harbors so that the navy
can be footloose in case of war is
dealt on with emphasis. It is recom
mended that the fleet be shifted from
one seacoast to the other every year
or two. Minor matters oonnected
with the Naval Academy and the pro
motion of officers are treated of.
Taking up the question of foreign
affairs, the message deals with The
Hague conference and what was ac
complished by it. Brief attention is
given to our relations with Cuba and
the question of our tariff relations
with that country are gone into. The
relations with other countries and
Secretary Root's visit to Mexico are
lightly touched on in concluding the
report.
Addreu to Csttee Owsers.
Paul M. Potts, president of the
Louisiana division of the Southern
Cotton Association, has issued the
following address to the cotton own
ers of the state:
"About three weeks ago when things
looked their worst in cotton market
affairs I issued a circular letter ask
ing the people to stand together and
make the fight to a finish for fifteen
cent cotton. Today I want to renew
that request, and now call on every
man who owns a bale of cotton to
hold on to it tighter than he ever has
held and his reward will surely be_ fit
teen cents for his cotton.
"The more persistently that cotton
is held the sooner will the price reach
fifteen cents and the sooner will the
cotton producers realize that they have
won the greatest victory in the history
of the world.
"Common sense will convince any
man that cotton will bring just what
the owners of cotton will make it
bring. You cannot get $100 for a horse
if you will sell it for $75, and you can
not get 15 cents for your cotton if you
will sell it for 11, 12, 13 or 14 cents.
"Pay no attention to the bearish ar
guments that will appear from time to
time in the newspapers who are un
friendly to 15-cent cotton. Sit steady
in the boat and victory will surely be
yours."
Ferry's Free Seed Bk.
For half a century thousands and
thousands of farmers and gardeners
haveregardied "Ferry's Seed Annual"
as the best guide not only for the buy
ing of seeds, but for their planting
and care. Daily reference to its text
and illustrations proves it to be the
actual beginning of a successful sea
son. The new edition for 1908 is now
ready for free mailing to all who write
to the publishers for a copy.
It is a high tribute to the house of
D. M. Ferry & Co. that two geners.
tions have planted Ferry's Seeds, each
succeeding year adding to the confi
dence that "seed trouble" will never
arise when Ferry's seeds are plated
as "Ferry's Seed Annual" says they
should be.
Another remarkable feature devel
oped by the house of Ferry is ethe
methqd of distributing seeds to dealers
throughout the country so that the
planters everywhere can secure at their
home store exactly what they want
when they want it, with the absolute
assurance that It is fresh and fertile.
Send to D. M. Ferry & Co., Detroit,
Mich., for the 1908 edition of "Ferry's
Seed Annual."
