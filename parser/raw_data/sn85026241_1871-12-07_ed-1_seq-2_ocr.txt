A REMARKABLE LETTER.
A Democratic Editor Declares
that the Party is Dead and Must
be Buried.
or the Democrat or Davenport, lowa,
has addressed the following letter to
the Chicago Timet, which appears is
that journal this morning.
."Havingfaithfully served as a mem
ber of the Democratic organization for
over twenty years, and still having the
fullest eon naence in tne carainai prin
ciples of that party, I am impelled to
declare my conviction that the organi
sation has outlived its nsefulness, and
that it is the duty of Democrats to
openly acknowledge that the Demo
cratic party is dead. All efforts at de
partures and galvanizing it into life
have proved a failure. The prestige ol
its general policy, or rather the lack of
yxiiu.y, uunug tne tate war wui viiag
to it and prevents Its success no matter
cow much we may become punned by
a change of heart. The result of the
recent elections is sufficient proof of
this fact, we can organize by forming
some integral part of a new party, and
probably resurrect our principles; but
the body must be buried and the stench
of its putrid remains removed from
the public nostrils. The present is the
proper emergency to test the patriotism
of the members of the Democratic par
ty If we love ou r country better than
ive do our party abandon the organzia
lion and unite wit i patriots, disregard
ing political antecedents, and we may
reasonably hope for a change or aamin
istratinn in-1872 that will protect and
guarantee equal rights to all sections of
our common country. Centralized
power will vanish, the war will soon
he forgotten, and our country again
will be peaceful, prosperous and happy.

THE YEAR'S CALAMITIES.
The past -year has,: under a wise
Providence; been one of general pros
perity to tne nation, it nas, however,
been attended with more than usual
chastisements In the loas of life and
property by storm and fire: : These dis
asters have served to call forth the best
elements of human nature in our coun
try, and to develop a friendship for us
on the 'part' of foreign nations which
goes far towards alleviating the distress
occasioned by-the calamities. The be
nevolent who have so generously shared
their means with the victims of these
misfortunes will reap their reward In
the consciousness of having performed
a noble act, and In receiving the grate
ful thahfcB of men. women and children,
whose sufferings they have relieved.

THE ANGLO-AMERICAN TREATY.
The year has been an eventful one In
witnessing two great nations, speaking
one language and having one lineage,
settling by peaceful arbitration disputes
of long standing, and liable at any time
to bring those nations into bloody and
bnntilp conflicts. An example has been
thus set which, if successful in- Its final

copy of the protocol and of the confer
ence oi tne commissioners ey wiiom it
was negotiated. This treaty provides
methods for adlusting the queeuons

SLAP AT CATACAZY.
i The Inexcusable course of the Rus
sian Minister at Washington rendered
it necessary to ask his recall, and to de
cline to longer receive that functionary
as a diplomatic representative. It was
Impossible, with self-respect or a Just
regard for the dignity of the country,
to permit bit. uuacazy to continue to
hold intercourse with this Government
after bis abuse of the Government offi
cials and during h persistent inter
ference, through various means, with
the relations between the United States
and other powers. In accordance with
my wishes, this uovemmenx nas oeen
relieved of further- intercourse with
Mr. Catacazv. and the management of
the affairs ot the imperial lieganon nas
nassed into the hands of a gentlemen
entirely nnoDjeeKonawe.
IAPANESE RELATIONS.
With Japan we continue to maintain
intimate relations. The cabinet of toe
Mikado has. since the close cf the last
session of Congress, selected citizens of
the United States to serve la omces lm
portant in aeveral departments of the
government. I have reason to think
that this selection is due to an appreci
atiou of the ; disinterestedness of. the
oolicv which the United States have
pursued towards Japan. ', -
CHINA AND COREA.
It is our desire to continue to main
tain this disinterested and just policy
with China, as Japan. The correspond
ence transmitted herewith, shows that
there is no disposition on - the part of
this government to swerve from its es
tablished course. ' Prompted by the
desire to put an end to the barbarous
treatment of our 'shipwrecked sailors
at the Corean coast, I instructed our
Minister at xtektu to endeavor to con
elude a convention with Corea for se
curing the safety and . humane; treat
ment of 1 such mariners. Admiral
Rogers was instructed to accompany
him, with a sufficient force to protect
him, in ease of need. A small survey
ing party was sent out, and on reaching
the coast was treacherously attacked at
a disadvantage. . Am pie - opportunity
was given for an explanation and apol
ogy for the result. Neither cume. : A
force was then landed, and after an ar
duous march over a rugged and difficult
country, the forts from which the out
rages had been committed .were gal-
laniiy assaulted ana aesiroyea. ::
- Having thus punished the criminal.
and having vindicated the .honor of the
flag, the expedition returned. Finding
it impracticable under the drcumstan-
. . i .i j i . . :
ces to conclude tne uhhihu couveauuu.
I respectfully refer to the correspondence
relatincr thereto, herewith submitted.
and leave the subject for such action as
Congress may see at to take.
THE NATIONAL DEBT.
: The national debt has been reduced to
the extent of 86.0d7,12G,80 during the
year, and by the negotiation of the na
tional Donas at a lower rate oi interest
the Interest on the oublicdebt has been
so far diminished that now the sum to
be raised for the Interest account is
nearly seventeen million dollars less
than at the 1st of March,869. It was
highly desirable that this rapid dimin
ution should take place both to strength
en the credit of the country and to con
vince its citizens of their entire ability
to meet every dollar or liability with'
out bankrupting them: but in view of
the accomplishment of these . desirable
ends, of the rapid developement of the
resources of the country, its increasing
ability to meet larger demands and tne
amount already paid, it is not desira
ble that the present resources of the
country should continue to be taxed in
order to continue this rapid payment
I therefore recommend a modification
of both the tariff and internal tax laws.
ABOLITION OF INTERNAL TAXES ADVISED.
' ' VISED, s. -.; '.; ,-i:V.'
'I recommend that all taxes from in
ternal sources be abolished, except
those on spirituous, vinous and wait
liquors, tobacco in various .forms and
from stamps. ' ,
AND MODIFICATION OF THE TARIFF.
In readjusticg . 'tha tariff. I suggest
that a careful estimate be made or the
amount of surplus revenue collected
under the present laws, after provid
ing for the current expenses of theGov-
ernment the interest account and a
stating fandy and that this wirplusbe
reduced in such manner as to a nor a
the greatest relief to tae greatest bum.
Der. There are many articles not
produced at home,; such as medicines
compounds, te from which very little
revenue is derived, out wmcn enter
into general u-e. Ail such articles I
recommend to be placed on the free
list, and should a further reduction
prove advisable, i would then recom
mend that it be made upon those ar
ticles which can bear it without dis
turbing home production or reducing
the wages oi American la Dor. i nave
not entered into figures ' beeose - to do
so would be to repeat all that islaid be

The present laws for collecting reve
nues piy collectors - oi customs small

General for. improvements in the de
partment presided over by hn: are
earnestly recommended to youf special
attention, especially the documents
favorable to the consideration oi tne
plan for uniting the telegraph system.
It is believed that by such a course the.
cost of telegraphing could be much re
duced and the service as well if not
better rendered. It would secure the
future advantage: by -introducing the
telegraph ' through portions of the
country where private enterprise will
not construct it. Commercey trade,
and, above all, the efforts to bring the
people widely - separated into - com
munity of Interests, - are always bene
fitted by rapid communication. Edu
cation1, the groundwork of- Republican
institutions, is encouraged by increas
ing the faculties to get : with more
speed to and from all parts of the coun
try ' The desire to reap the benefits of
such improvements will stimulate edu

the Postmaster General for full details
of the operations ! of last year, . and for
comparative statements iof the results

KU-KLUX MEASURES.
There has been imposed - upon the
Executive branch of the government
the execution of the act of Congress,
approved April 20, 1871, and common
ly known as the Ku-Klux law. -In
a portion of the State of South
Carolina, the necessity of - the : course
pursued will be demonstrated by the
report of of the committee' to. invest!
eate-the Southern eutragesJ - Under
the provisions of tha above act. I issued
a proclamation calling the attention of
the people of the United States to the
same, and declaring my reluctance to
execute any of the extraordinary pow
era thereby eonrerea upon me unless
in case of imperative necessity, but
making known my purpose to exercise
such powers whenever . it should be-;
come necessary to do so for the ! pur
pose of securing to all citizens or the
United States the peaceful enjoyment
of the rights guaranteed to them by
the Constitution and the: laws. After
the passage of this law, ' information
was received from time to time that
combinations of the character refered
to in this law existed and were power,
ful in many parts of the Southern
States, particularly in certain counties
in the State of South Carolina. . Careful
investigation was mide and it was as
certained that in nine counties in that
State such combinations were active
and powerful, embracing sufficient
portion of the citizens to control the
loyal authority, and . having, among
other things.the object of depriving the
emancipated class of the substantial
benefits of freedom and of preventing
the free political action ; ot those citi
zens who did not sympatize with their
own views. Among' tne uepuoiicans
there were frequent scourgings and oc
casional assassinations. These were
generally perpetrated at night by . dis
guised persons, tne victims iu uiuet tux
cases being citizens of different political
sentiments from' their own,' or freed
persons who had shown a disposition
to claim equal rights with other citi
zens." Thousands ot lnocent and : iuoi-
fensive citizens were sufferers by this
lawless violence. - Thereupon on the
30th day of October, 1871, a proclama
uon was issued in terms., ot tna taw.
calling upon the members of the com
binations to disperse witnin nve oays,
and to deliver to the marshal orminta
ry officers of the United States all arms,
ammunitions, uniforms, disguises and
other means and implements used by
them ior carrying out their unlawful
purposes. - This warning not having
been heeded, on the . 17th of, October
another proclamation was issued, sus
pending the writ of habeas corpus . in
nine counties in that State.' Direction
was given that within the counties so
designated persons supposed, upon re
liable information, to be members , of
such unlawful combinations, should be
arrested by the military forces, of the
United States and , delivered to the
Marshal to be dealt with according to
law. . In two of said counties York
and Spartanburg many arrests" have
been made. At the last account the
number of persons thus arrested was
one hundred and sixty-eight; several
hundred whose criminality was ascer
tained to be of au inferior degree, were
released ior tne present. xnes! nave
generally made confessions of their
guilt. Great caution hase been exer
cised in , making these arrests, and
notwithstanding the large number,
it is lelieved that no innocent person
is now in custody. The prisoners will
be held for regular trial before the - ju
dicial tribunals of the Unit d States.
As soon as It appeared that the author
ities of the United elates were about
to take vigorous measures to enforce
the law. many persons absconded, and
there Is good ground for supposing that
all such persons have violated the law.
A . run report or wnnt nas oeen done
under this law will be ' submitted to
Congress by the Attorney General. -

THE INDIAN PROBLEM. THE PUBLIC LANDS.
I renew my recommendatioti that
the public lands be regarded as a herit
age to our children, to be disposed of
only as required for occupation, and to
actual settlers. " Those already granted
have been in great part disposed of in
such a way as to secure, access to- the
balance by the hardy settler who will
avail . himself of them, but caution
should be exercised even in attaining so
desirable an object. " Educational inter
ests may well be served by the grant
of proceeds of sales of public land? to
settlers. I do not wish to be under
stood as recommending in the least de
gree a curtailment of what Is . bei ng
done by the general Government for the
encouragement of education, . ;
AMNESTY FOR THE SOUTH.
More than six years having elapsed
siuce the last hostile gun was fired be
tween the armies then arrayed against
each other for the perpetuation or for
the destruction of the .Union, : it may
well be considered whether it ia ; not
now time that the disabilities imposed
by the Fourteenth Amendment should
be removed. -That (Amendment does
not exclude the balloU.- but ' onlv-r re
quires the disability to hold office "of
certain classes. When the purity of
the ballot is secure, majorities are sure
to elect officers reflecting the views of.
the majority. - I do not see the advan
tage or propriety of excluding men
from office merely because - they were
men before the Rebellion of standing
and character sufficient to be elected to
positions requiring them to take an
oath to support the Constitution, and
admitting to eligibility those enter-,
taining precisely the same views, : but
of less standing in the community. ' It
may be said that the former violated
an oath, while the latter did not. The
latter did not have it in their power to
do so.' ' If they had taken 1 this oath,
it cannot be doubted that they -would
have broken it, as did the former class.
If there are any criminals distinguish
ed above all others in the part they
took in opposition to the Government
they might, in the judgment of Con
gress, be excluded, from iSuch an am-'
nesty, : , This subject is subm itted for
your careful consideration , The con
dition of the Southern States is, unhap
pily, not such as all true patriotic citi
zens would like to see. Social ostra
cism for. opinion's sake, personal vio
lence, or threats toward persons enter
taining . political . views , opposed to
those entertained ,' by the majority of
the old eitizens, prevents immigration
and the flow of - much needed capital
into the States lately in Rebellion. It
will be a happy condition of the coun
try when the old citizens of these
States will take an : interest in public
affairs, promulgate their ideas, honest
ly entertained, vote for meq represent
ing their views, and permit the same
freedom of expression in those enter?
taining different political convictions. '
THE CIVIL SERVICE.
It has been tne aim of the adminis
tration to enforce huueety and -eOlcieucy
in all public offices.- Every .public ser
vant who has violated the trust placed
in him has been proceeded' against With
all (he vigor of the law." If bad' men
have secured places It has been the fault
of the system established by luW and
custom for making appointments, or the
fault of those who recommend for gov
ernment positions persons hot KUfflcienU
ly well known to ibem persona. ly, tot
who give letter en lorsiiigtlie-cbaraccier
of office-seekers -without a proper sense
of the grave responsibilities which such
a course devolves upou tbem. . A civii
service reform which can correct this
abuse is much desired. In mercantile
pursuits, tha business meq who give a
tetter of reoouimendatiqu to n frjeud to
enable him to obtain credit from a stran
ger, 'is regarded as morally . responsible
for the integrity of his friend and his
ability to meet his obligation.' 'A, re
formatory law which would enforce this
principle against alt endorsers of per
sons for public plucv would insure great
caution iu making recommendations.
A salutary lesson lias- been taught the
carelesraud the dishonest -servant iu
the great number of prosecution and
convictions of the last two years. . .

The Open Polar Sea.
While the Artie exploring expedi
tion by way of the Pacific, and that of
Captain Hall by the "overland" route
have been pushing their " way 'toward
the open Polar Sea,-and engaging', th e
attention a tne seienune wonu, a ' re
port reaches the public that ' Lieuten
ant Julius Payer has found his way t
ward tnis sea Dy,tnB route ' suggested
first we believe by the distinguished
German t geographer, Dr; ' Peterman.
LKjngago he reported that beyond ; the
Northern limit to' which' expeditions
nau saued on tne route oetween Bpiti
bergen and Nova ZembliV'a vast' sea
stretched away still, add that by- fol
lowing the trend of :the 'Gutf Stream
a passage into- the open Polar Sea
might be found; T his route has been
followed, and without any flourish ' of
trumpets or costly preperaUons. Lieut.
P. has sailed into this;seaand;rettirnsto
tell as modestly how the result was
attained. - lathe first' place, : without
fitting out a costly expedition or invit
ing-tne attention oi manKinu to his en
terprise, he chartered a small' Norwe
gian Bailing vessel for the trip and sail
ed as far North as -79 north latitude,
nearly four degrees further than CnpL
Koldeay reached in his steamer. . How
he succeeded 6(J much better than 'for
mer expeditions'lie tolls ua ; with great
modesty.'! Nearly all the- former ex
peditions r-.e'isayaji entered and ' left
too Bobu being 'apprehensive of being
cauirht by the ieeA He found, howev
er, that the most ' favorable time - for
pavigating-thiascaisin the fall. "He
sides, other njivigators hugged either
the coast of Ncrva Zembla or of Spitz
bergen too cl6selyiwhile he took, the
strip of water between 40 and 42 long
itude, and found: fair Balling. There
seems to be no doubt that, he merely
followed the Gulf Stream and if he had
had supplies : for a further journey
might nave discovered , some or the
wonderful secret which are nupposed
to be locked up in the ice of these arctic
regions.; Having ascertained,', howev
er, the exaet channel to follow and the
season at which to follow it, it-only re
mains for future navigators to sail ' in
to this sea withe their fleets an l grati
fy the curiosity of the scientific World.
' This, is another triumph for, the Ger
mans, who of recent years; have been
so fruitful of triumphs, and settles the
dispute between Dr.; Peteriqan and the
English geographers. ; The t old route
and the one which Captain Hall is 1 now
pursuing, , is by: way of . Raffin'sBay
and Smith's land. This, .Dr. Petermann
held, was not the best route, since , that
which the Gulf Stream t takes oetween
Nova Zembla and Spitsbergen promis
ed to be the warmest and most, free of
ice.. Tne route followed is almost pre
cisely Umt which he indicated a year
